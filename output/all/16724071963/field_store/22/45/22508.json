Did you see him at Camp Jackson--was he hurt?\"  \"I think not, sir,\" Stephen answered, with clear eyes.  \"I saw him walking southward after the firing was all over.\"  \"Thank God,\" exclaimed Mr. Brinsmade, fervently. \"If you will excuse me, madam, I shall hurry to tell my wife and daughter. I have been able to find no one who saw him.\"  As he went out he glanced at Stephen's forehead. But for once in his life, Mr. Brinsmade was too much agitated to inquire about the pain of another.  \"Stephen, you did not tell me that you saw John,\" said his mother, when the door was closed.     CHAPTER XX  IN THE ARSENAL  There was a dismal tea at Colonel Carvel's house in Locust Street that evening Virginia did not touch a mouthful, and the Colonel merely made a pretence of eating. About six o'clock Mrs. Addison Colfax had driven in from Bellegarde, nor could it rain fast enough or hard enough to wash the foam from her panting horses. She did not wait for Jackson to come out with an umbrella, but rushed through the wet from the carriage to the door in her haste to urge the Colonel to go to the Arsenal and demand Clarence's release. It was in vain that Mr. Carvel assured her it would do no good, in vain that he told her of a more important matter that claimed him. Could there be a more important matter than his own nephew kept in durance, and in danger of being murdered by Dutch butchers in the frenzy of their victory? Mrs. Colfax shut herself up in her room, and through the door Virginia heard her sobs as she went down to tea.  The Colonel made no secret of his uneasiness. With his hat on his head, and his hands in his pockets, he paced up and down the room. He let his cigar go out,--a more serious sign still. Finally he stood with his face to the black window, against which the big drops were beating in a fury.  Virginia sat expressionless at the head of the table, still in that gown of white and crimson, which she had worn in honor of the defenders of the state. Expressionless, save for a glance of solicitation at her father's back. If resolve were feminine, Virginia might have sat for that portrait. There was a light in her dark blue eyes. Underneath there were traces of the day's fatigue. When she spoke, there was little life in her voice.  \"Aren't you going to the Planters' House, Pa The Colonel turned, and tried to smile.  \"I reckon not to-night, Jinny. Why?\"  \"To find out what they are going to do with Clarence,\" she said indignantly.  \"I reckon they don't know at the Planters' House,\" he said.  \"Then--\" began Virginia, and stopped.  \"Then what?\" he asked, stroking her hair.  \"Then why not go to the Barracks? Order the carriage, and I will go with you.\"  His smile faded. He stood looking down at her fixedly, as was sometimes his habit. Grave tenderness was in his tone.  \"Jinny,\" he said slowly, \"Jinny, do you mean to marry Clarence?\"  The suddenness of the question took her breath. But she answered steadily:  \"Yes.\"  \"Do you love him?  \"Yes,\" she answered. But her lashes fell.  Still he stood, and it seemed to her that her father's gaze pierced to her secret soul.  \"Come here, my dear,\" he said.  He held out his arms, and she fluttered into them. The tears were come at last. It was not the first time she had cried out her troubles against that great heart which had ever been her strong refuge. From childhood she had been comforted there. Had she broken her doll, had Mammy Easter been cross, had lessons gone wrong at school, was she ill, or weary with that heaviness of spirit which is woman's inevitable lot,--this was her sanctuary. But now! This burden God Himself had sent, and none save her Heavenly Father might cure it. Through his great love for her it was given to Colonel Carvel to divine it--only vaguely.  Many times he strove to speak, and could not. But presently, as if ashamed of her tears, she drew back from him and took her old seat on the arm of his chair.  By the light of his intuition, the Colonel chose tins words well. What he had to speak of was another sorrow, yet a healing one.  \"You must not think of marriage now, my dear, when the bread we eat may fail us. Jinny, we are not as rich as we used to be. Our trade was in the South and West, and now the South and West cannot pay. I had a conference with Mr. Hopper yesterday, and he tells me that we must be prepared.\"  She laid her hand upon his.  \"And did you think I would care, dear?\" she asked gently. \"I can bear with poverty and rags, to win this war.\"  \"His own eyes were dim, but pride shone in them. Jackson came in on tiptoe, and hesitated. At the Colonel's motion he took away the china and the silver, and removed the white cloth, and turned low the lights in the chandelier. He went out softly, and closed the door.  \"Pa,\" said Virginia, presently, \"do you trust Mr. Hopper?\"  The Colonel gave a start.  \"Why, yes, Jinny. He improved the business greatly before this trouble came. And even now we are not in such straits as some other houses.\"  \"Captain Lige doesn't like him.\"  \"Lige has prejudices.\"  \"So have I,\" said Virginia. \"Eliphalet Hopper will serve you so long as he serves himself. No longer.\"  \"I think you do him an injustice, my dear,\" answered the Colonel. But uneasiness was in his voice. \"Hopper is hard working, scrupulous to a cent. He owns two slaves now who are running the river. He keeps out of politics, and he has none of the Yankee faults.\"  \"I wish he had,\" said Virginia.  The Colonel made no answer to this. Getting up, he went over to the bell-cord at the door and pulled it. Jackson came in hurriedly.  \"Is my bag packed?\"  \"Yes, Marsa.\"  \"Where are you going?\" cried Virginia, in alarm.  \"To Jefferson City, dear, to see the Governor. I got word this afternoon.\"  \"In the rain?\"  He smiled, and stooped to kiss her.  \"Yes,\" he answered, \"in the rain as far as the depot, I can trust you, Jinny. And Lige's boat will be back from New Orleans to-morrow or Sunday.\"  The next morning the city awoke benumbed, her heart beating but feebly. Her commerce had nearly ceased to flow. A long line of boats lay idle, with noses to the levee. Men stood on the street corners in the rain, reading of the capture of Camp Jackson, and of the riot, and thousands lifted up their voices to execrate the Foreign City below Market Street. A vague terror, maliciously born, subtly spread. The Dutch had broken up the camp, a peaceable state institution, they had shot down innocent women and children. What might they not do to the defenceless city under their victorious hand, whose citizens were nobly loyal to the South? Sack it? Yes, and burn, and loot it. Ladies who ventured out that day crossed the street to avoid Union gentlemen of their acquaintance.  It was early when Mammy Easter brought the news paper to her mistress. Virginia read the news, and ran joyfully to her aunt's room. Three times she knocked, and then she heard a cry within. Then the key was turned and the bolt cautiously withdrawn, and a crack of six inches disclosed her aunt.  \"Oh, how you frightened me, Jinny!\" she cried. \"I thought it was the Dutch coming to murder us all, What have they done to Clarence?\"  \"We shall see him to-day, Aunt Lillian,\" was the joyful answer. \"The newspaper says that all the Camp Jackson prisoners are to be set free to-day, on parole. Oh, I knew they would not dare to hold them. The whole state would have risen to their rescue.\"  Mrs. Colfax did not receive these tidings with transports. She permitted her niece to come into her room, and then: sank into a chair before the mirror of her dressing-table, and scanned her face there.  \"I could not sleep a wink, Jinny, all night long. I look wretchedly. I am afraid I am going to have another of my attacks. How it is raining! What does the newspaper say?\"  \"I'll get it for you,\" said Virginia, used to her aunt's vagaries.  \"No, no, tell me. I am much too nervous to read it.\"  \"It says that they will be paroled to-day, and that they passed a comfortable night.\"  \"It must be a Yankee lie,\" said the lady. \"Oh, what a night! I saw them torturing him in a thousand ways the barbarians! I know he had to sleep on a dirty floor with low-down trash.\"  \"But we shall have him here to-night, Aunt Lillian!\" cried Virginia. \"Mammy, tell Uncle Ben that Mr. Clarence will be here for tea. We must have a feast for him. Pa said that they could not hold them.\"  \"Where is Comyn?\" inquired Mrs. Colfax. \"Has he gone down to see Clarence?\"  \"He went to Jefferson City last night,\" replied Virginia. \"The Governor sent for him.\"  Mrs. Colfax exclaimed in horror at this news.  \"Do you mean that he has deserted us?\" she cried. \"That he has left us here defenceless,--at the mercy of the Dutch, that they may wreak their vengeance upon us women? How can you sit still, Virginia? If I were your age and able to drag myself to the street, I should be at the Arsenal now. I should be on my knees before that detestable Captain Lyon, even if he is a Yankee.\" Virginia kept her temper.  \"I do not go on my knees to any man,\" she said. \"Rosetta, tell Ned I wish the carriage at once.\"  Her aunt seized her convulsively by the arm.  \"Where are you going, Jinny?\" she demanded. \"Your Pa would never forgive me if anything happened to you.\"  A smile, half pity, crossed the girl's anxious face.  \"I am afraid that I must risk adding to your misfortune, Aunt Lillian,\" she said, and left the room.  Virginia drove to Mr. Brinsmade's. His was one of the Union houses which she might visit and not lose her self respect. Like many Southerners, when it became a question of go or stay, Mr. Brinsmade's unfaltering love for the Union had kept him in. He had voted for Mr. Bell, and later had presided at Crittenden Compromise meetings. In short, as a man of peace, he would have been willing to sacrifice much for peace. And now that it was to be "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5392"],["title","The Crisis — Volume 05 (#8)"],["body","war, and he had taken his stand uncompromisingly with the Union, the neighbors whom he had befriended for so many years could not bring themselves to regard him as an enemy. He never hurt their feelings; and almost as soon as the war began he set about that work which has been done by self-denying Christians of all ages,--the relief of suffering. He visited with comfort the widow and the fatherless, and many a night in the hospital he sat through beside the dying, Yankee and Rebel alike, and wrote their last letters home.  And Yankee and Rebel alike sought his help and counsel in time of perplexity or trouble, rather than hotheaded advice from their own leaders.  Mr. Brinsmade's own carriage was drawn up at his door; and that gentleman himself standing on the threshold. He came down his steps bareheaded in the wet to hand Virginia from her carriage.  Courteous and kind as ever, he asked for her father and her aunt as he led her into the house. However such men may try to hide their own trials under a cheerful mien, they do not succeed with spirits of a kindred nature. With the others, who are less generous, it matters not. Virginia was not so thoughtless nor so selfish that she could not perceive that a trouble had come to this good man. Absorbed as she was in her own affairs, she forgot some of them in his presence. The fire left her tongue, and to him she could not have spoken harshly even of an enemy. Such was her state of mind, when she was led into the drawing-room. From the corner of it Anne arose and came forward to throw her arms around her friend.  \"Jinny, it was so good of you to come. You don't, hate me?\"  \"Hate you, Anne dear!\"  \"Because we are Union,\" said honest Anne, wishing to have no shadow of doubt.  Virginia was touched. \"Anne,\" she cried, \"if you were German, I believe I should love you.\"  \"How good of you to come. I should not have dared go to your house, because I know that you feel so deeply. You--you heard?\"  \"Heard what?\" asked Virginia, alarmed.  \"That Jack has run away--has gone South, we think. Perhaps,\" she cried, \"perhaps he may be dead.\"  And tears came into the girl's eyes.  It was then that Virginia forgot Clarence. She drew Anne to the sofa and kissed her.  \"No, he is not dead,\" she said gently, but with a confidence in her voice of rare quality. \"He is not dead, Anne dear, or you would have heard.\"  Had she glanced up, she would have seen Mr. Brinsmade's eye upon her. He looked kindly at all people, but this expression he reserved for those whom he honored. A life of service to others had made him guess that, in the absence of her father, this girl had come to him for help of some kind.  \"Virginia is right, Anne,\" he said. \"John has gone to fight for his principles, as every gentleman who is free should; we must remember that this is his home, and that we must not quarrel with him, because we think differently.\" He paused, and came over to Virginia. \"There is something I can do for you, my dear?\" said he.  She rose. \"Oh, no, Mr. Brinsmade,\" she cried. And yet her honesty was as great as Anne's. She would not have it thought that she came for other reasons. \"My aunt is in such a state of worry over Clarence that I came to ask you if you thought the news true, that the prisoners are to be paroled. She thinks it is a--\" Virginia flushed, and bit a rebellious tongue. \"She does not believe it.\"  Even good Mr. Brinsmade smiled at the slip she had nearly made. He understood the girl, and admired her. He also understood Mrs. Colfax.  \"I'll drive to the Arsenal with you, Jinny,\" he answered. \"I know Captain Lyon, and we shall find out certainly.\"  \"You will do nothing of the kind, sir,\" said Virginia, with emphasis.\" Had I known this--about John, I should not have come.\"  He checked her with a gesture. What a gentleman of the old school he was, with his white ruffled shirt and his black stock and his eye kindling with charity.  \"My dear,\" he answered, \"Nicodemus is waiting. I was just going myself to ask Captain Lyon about John.\" Virginia's further objections were cut short by the violent clanging of the door-bell, and the entrance of a tall, energetic gentleman, whom Virginia had introduced to her as Major Sherman, late of the army, and now president of the Fifth Street Railroad. The Major bowed and shook hands. He then proceeded, as was evidently his habit, directly to the business on which he was come.  \"Mr. Brinsmade,\" he said, \"I heard, accidentally, half an hour ago that you were seeking news of your son. I regret to say, sir, that the news I have will not lead to a knowledge of his whereabouts. But in justice to a young gentleman of this city I think I ought to tell you what happened at Camp Jackson.\"  \"I shall be most grateful, Major. Sit down, sir.\"  But the Major did not sit down. He stood in the middle of the room. With some gesticulation which added greatly to the force of the story, he gave a most terse and vivid account of Mr. John's arrival at the embankment by the grove--of his charging a whole regiment of Union volunteers. Here was honesty again. Mr. Sherman did not believe in mincing matters even to a father and sister.  \"And, sir,\" said he, \"you may thank the young man who lives next door to you--Mr. Brice, I believe--for saving your son's life.\"  \"Stephen Brice!\" exclaimed Mr, Brinsmade, in astonishment.  Virginia felt Anne's hand tighten But her own was limp. A hot wave swept over her, Was she never to hear the end of this man.  \"Yes, sir, Stephen Brice,\" answered Mr. Sherman. \"And I never in my life saw a finer thing done, in the Mexican War or out of it.\"  Mr. Brinsmade grew a little excited. \"Are you sure that you know him?\"  \"As sure as I know you,\" said the Major, with excessive conviction.  \"But,\" said Mr. Brinsmade, \"I was in there last night, I knew the young man had been at the camp. I asked him if he had seen Jack. He told me that he had, by the embankment. But he never mentioned a word about saving his life.\"  \"He didn't,\" cried the Major. \"By glory, but he's even better than I thought him, Did you see a black powder mark on his face?\"  \"Why, yes, sir, I saw a bad burn of some kind on his forehead.\"  \"Well, sir, if one of the Dutchmen who shot at Jack had known enough to put a ball in his musket, he would have killed Mr. Brice, who was only ten feet away, standing before your son.\"  Anne gave a little cry--Virginia was silent--Her lips were parted. Though she realized it not, she was thirsting %a hear the whole of the story.  The Major told it, soldier fashion, but well. How John rushed up to the line. How he (Mr. Sherman) had seen Brice throw the woman down and had cried to him to lie down himself how the fire was darting down the regiment, and how men and women were falling all about them; and how Stephen had flung Jack and covered him with his body.  It was all vividly before Virginia's eyes. Had she any right to treat such a man with contempt? She remembered hour he had looked, at her when he stood on the corner by the Catherwoods' house. And, worst of all, she remembered many spiteful remarks she had made, even to Anne, the gist of which had been that Mr. Brice was better at preaching than at fighting. She knew now--and she had known in her heart before--that this was the greatest injustice she could have done him.  \"But Jack? What did Jack do?\"  It was Anne who tremblingly asked the Major. But Mr. Sherman, apparently, was not the man to say that Jack would have shot Stephen had he not interfered. That was the ugly part of the story. John would have shot the man who saved his life. To the day of his death neither Mr. Brinsmade nor his wife knew this. But while Mr. Brinsmade and Anne had gone upstairs to the sickbed, these were the tidings the Major told Virginia, who kept it in her heart. The reason he told her was because she had guessed a part of it.  Nevertheless Mr. Brinsmade drove to the Arsenal with her that Saturday, in his own carriage. Forgetful of his own grief, long habit came to him to talk cheerily with her. He told her many little anecdotes of his travel, but not one of them did she hear. Again, at the moment when she thought her belief in Clarence and her love for him at last secure, she found herself drawing searching comparisons between him and the quieter young Bostonian. In spite of herself she had to admit that Stephen's deed was splendid. Was this disloyal? She flushed at the thought. Clarence had been capable of the deed,--even to the rescue of an enemy. But--alas, that she should carry it out to a remorseless end--would Clarence have been equal to keeping silence when Mr. Brinsmade came to him? Stephen Brice had not even told his mother, so Mr. Brinsmade believed.  As if to aggravate her torture, Mr. Brinsmade's talk drifted to the subject of young Mr. Brice. This was but natural. He told her of the brave struggle Stephen had made, and how he had earned luxuries, and often necessities, for his mother by writing for the newspapers.  \"Often,\" said Mr. Brinsmade, \"often I have been unable to sleep, and have seen the light in Stephen's room until the small hours of the morning.\"  \"Oh, Mr. Brinsmade,\" cried Virginia. \"Can't you tell me something bad about him? Just once.\"  The good gentleman started, and looked searchingly at the girl by his side, flushed and confused. Perhaps he thought--but how can we tell what he thought? How can we guess that our teachers laugh at our pranks after they have caned us for them? We do not remember that our parents have once been young themselves, and that some word or look of our own brings a part of their past vividly before them. Mr. Brinsmade was silent, but he looked out of the carriage window, away from Virginia. And presently, as they splashed through the mud near the Arsenal, they met a knot of gentlemen in state uniforms on their way to the city. Nicodemus stopped at his master's signal. Here was George Catherwood, and his father was with him.  \"They have released us on parole,\" said"]]]
