That must make you happy, father.--But tell us, pray tell us where the wound hurts that the murderer gave you?\"  \"Children,  children,\"  murmured  the  anchorite, and a happy smile parted his lips.  \"The gracious gods are merciful in permitting me to see that--aye, merciful to me, and to effect that end I would have died twenty deaths.\"  Klea pressed his now cold hand to her lips as he spoke and again asked, though hardly able to control her voice for tears:  \"But the wound, father--where is the wound?\"  \"Let be, let be,\" replied Serapion.  \"It is acrid poison, not a dagger or dart that has undone my strength.  And I can depart in peace, for I am no longer needed for anything.  You, Publius, must now take my place with this child, and will do it better than I.  Klea, the wife of Publius Scipio!  I indeed have dreamt that such a thing might come to pass, and I always knew, and have said to myself a thousand times that I now say to you my son: This girl here, this Klea is of a good sort, and worthy only of the noblest.  I give her to you, my son Publius, and now join your hands before me here --for I have always been like a father to her.\"  That you have indeed,\" sobbed Klea.  \"And it was no doubt for my sake, and to protect me, that you quitted your retreat, and have met your death.\"  \"It was fate, it was fate,\" stammered the old man.  \"The assassins were in ambush for me,\" cried Publius, seizing Serapion's hand, \"the murderers who fell on you instead of me.  Once more, where is your wound?\"  \"My destiny fulfils itself,\" replied the recluse.  \"No locked-up cell, no physician, no healing herb can avail against the degrees of Fate. I am dying of a serpent's sting as it was foretold at my birth; and if I had not gone out to seek Klea a serpent would have slipped into my cage, and have ended my life there.  Give me your hands, my children, for a deadly chill is creeping over me, and its cold hand already touches my heart.\"  For a few minutes his voice failed him, and then he said softly:  \"One thing I would fain ask of you.  My little possessions, which were intended for you and Irene, you will now use to bury me.  I do not wish to be burnt, as they did with my father--no, I should wish to be finely embalmed, and my mummy to be placed with my mother's.  If indeed we may meet again after death--and I believe we shall--I would rather see her once more than any one, for she loved me so much--and I feel now as if I were a child again, and could throw my arms round her neck.  In another life, perhaps, I may not be the child of misfortune that I have been in this--in another life--now it grips my heart--in another----Children whatever joys have smiled on me in this, children, it was to you I have owed it--Klea, to you--and there is my little Irene too----\"  These were the last words of Serapion the recluse; he fell back with a deep sigh and was dead.  Klea and Publius tenderly closed his faithful eyes.     CHAPTER XXIII.  The unwonted tumult that had broken the stillness of the night had not been unobserved in the Greek Serapeum any more than in the Egyptian temple adjoining the Apis-tombs; but perfect silence once more reigned in the Necropolis, when at last the great gate of the sanctuary of Osiris- Apis was thrown open, and a little troop of priests arranged in a procession came out from it with a vanguard of temple servants, who had been armed with sacrificial knives and axes.  Publius and Klea, who were keeping faithful watch by the body of their dead friend, saw them approaching, and the Roman said:  \"It would have been even less right in such a night as this to let you proceed to one of the temples with out my escort than to have let our poor friend remain unwatched.\"  \"Once more I assure you,\" said Klea eagerly \"that we should have thrown away every chance of fulfilling Serapion's last wish as he intended, if during our absence a jackal or a hyena had mutilated his body, and I am happy to be able at least to prove to my friend, now he is dead, how grateful I am for all the kindness he showed us while he lived.  We ought to be grateful even to the departed, for how still and blissful has this hour been while guarding his body.  Storm and strife brought us together--\"  \"And here,\" interrupted Publius, \"we have concluded a happy and permanent treaty of peace for the rest of our lives.\"  \"I accept it willingly,\" replied Klea, looking down, \"for I am the vanquished party.\"  \"But you have already confessed,\" said Publius, \"that you were never so unhappy as when you thought you had asserted your strength against mine, and I can tell you that you never seemed to me so great and yet so lovable as when in the midst of your triumph, you gave up the battle for lost.  Such an hour as that, a man experiences but once in his lifetime. I have a good memory, but if ever I should forget it, and be angry and passionate--as is sometimes my way--remind me of this spot, or of this our dead friend, and my hard mood will melt, and I shall remember that you once were ready to give your life for mine.  I will make it easy for you, for in honor of this man, who sacrificed his life for yours and who was actually murdered in my stead, I promise to add his name of Serapion to my own, and I will confirm this vow in Rome.  He has behaved to us as a father, and it behoves me to reverence his memory as though I had been his son.  An obligation was always unendurable to me, and how I shall ever make full restitution to you for what you have done for me this night I do not yet know--and yet I should be ready and willing every day and every hour to accept from you some new gift of love.  'A debtor,' says the proverb, 'is half a prisoner,' and so I must entreat you to deal mercifully with your conquerer.\"  He took her hand, stroked back the hair from her forehead, and touched it lightly with his lips.  Then he went on:  \"Come with me now that we may commit the dead into the hands of these priests.\"  Klea once more bent over the remains of the anchorite, she hung the amulet he had given her for her journey round his neck, and then silently obeyed her lover.  When they came up with the little procession Publius informed the chief priest how he had found Serapion, and requested him to fetch away the corpse, and to cause it to be prepared for interment in the costliest manner in the embalming house attached to their temple. Some of the temple-servants took their places to keep watch over the body, and after many questions addressed to Publius, and after examining too the body of the assassin who had been slain, the priests returned to the temple.  As soon as the two lovers were left alone again Klea seized the Roman's hand, and said passionately: \"You have spoken many tender words to me, and I thank you for them; but I am wont always to be honest, and less than any one could I deceive you.  Whatever your love bestows upon me will always be a free gift, since you owe me nothing at all and I owe you infinitely much; for I know now that you have snatched my sister from the clutches of the mightiest in the land while I, when I heard that Irene had gone away with you, and that murder threatened your life, believed implicitly that on the contrary you had lured the child away to become your sweetheart, and then--then I hated you, and then--I must confess it\\ --in my horrible distraction I wished you dead!\"  \"And you think that wish can offend me or hurt me?\"  said Publius.  \"No, my child; it only proves to me that you love me as I could wish to be loved.  Such rage under such circumstances is but the dark shadow cast by love, and is as inseparable from love as from any tangible body.  Where it is absent there is no such thing as real love present--only an airy vision, a phantom, a mockery.  Such an one as Klea does not love nor hate by halves; but there are mysterious workings in your soul as in that of every other woman.  How did the wish that you could see me dead turn into the fearful resolve to let yourself be killed in my stead?\"  \"I saw the murderers,\" answered Klea, \"and I was overwhelmed with horror of them and of their schemes, and of all that had to do with them; I would not destroy Irene's happiness, and I loved you even more deeply than I hated you; and then--but let us not speak of it.\"  \"Nay-tell me all.\"  \"Then there was a moment--\"  \"Well, Klea?\"  \"Then--in these last hours, while we have been sitting hand in hand by the body of poor Serapion, and hardly speaking, I have felt it all over again--then the midnight hymn of the priests fell upon my heart, and as I lifted up my soul in prayer at their pious chant I felt as if all my inmost heart had been frozen and hardened, and was reviving again to new life and tenderness and warmth.  I could not help thinking of all that is good and right, and I made up my mind to sacrifice myself for you and for Irene's happiness far more quickly and easily than I could give it up afterwards.  My father was one of the followers of Zeno--\"  \"And you,\" interrupted Publius, \"thought you were acting in accordance with the doctrine of the Stoa.  I also am familiar with it, but I do not know the man who is so virtuous and wise that he can live and act, as that teaching prescribes, in the heat of the struggle of life, or who is the living representative in flesh and blood of the whole code of ethics, not sinning against one of its laws and embodying it in himself.  Did you ever hear of the peace of mind, the lofty indifference and equanimity of the Stoic sages?  You look as if the question offended you, but you did not by any means know how to attain that magnanimity, for I have seen you fail in it; indeed it is contrary to the very nature of woman, and-- the gods be thanked--you are not a Stoic in woman's dress, but a woman --a true woman, as you should be.  You have learned nothing from Zeno and Chrysippus but what any peasant girl might"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5465"],["title","The Sisters — Volume 5 (#3)"],["body","from an honest father, to be true I mean and to love virtue.  Be content with that; I am more than satisfied.\"  \"Oh, Publius,\" exclaimed the girl, grasping her friend's hand. \"I understand you, and I know that you are right.  A woman must be miserable so long as she fancies herself strong, and imagines and feels that she needs no other support than her own firm will and determination, no other counsel than some wise doctrines which she accepts and adheres to.  Before I could call you mine, and went on my own way, proud of my own virtue, I was--I cannot bear to think of it--but half a soul, and took it for a whole; but now--if now fate were to snatch you from me, I should still know where to seek the support on which I might lean in need and despair.  Not in the Stoa, not in herself can a woman find such a stay, but in pious dependence on the help of the gods.\"  \"I am a man,\" interrupted Publius, \"and yet I sacrifice to them and yield ready obedience to their decrees.\"  \"But,\" cried Klea, \"I saw yesterday in the temple of Serapis the meanest things done by his ministers, and it pained me and disgusted me, and I lost my hold on the divinity; but the extremest anguish and deepest love have led me to find it again.  I can no longer conceive of the power that upholds the universe as without love nor of the love that makes men happy as other than divine.  Any one who has once prayed for a being they love as I prayed for you in the desert can never again forget how to pray. Such prayers indeed are not in vain.  Even if no god can hear them there is a strengthening virtue in such prayer itself.  \"Now I will go contentedly back to our temple till you fetch me, for I know that the discreetest, wisest, and kindest Beings will watch over our love.\"  \"You will not accompany me to Apollodorus and Irene?\"  asked Publius in surprise.  \"No,\" answered Klea firmly.  \"Rather take me back to the Serapeum.  I have not yet been released from the duties I undertook there, and it will be more worthy of us both that Asclepiodorus should give you the daughter of Philotas as your wife than that you should be married to a runaway serving-maid of Serapis.\"  Publius considered for a moment, and then he said eagerly:  \"Still I would rather you should come with me.  You must be dreadfully tired, but I could take you on my mule to Apollodorus.  I care little for what men say of me when I am sure I am doing right, and I shall know how to protect you against Euergetes whether you wish to be readmitted to the temple or accompany me to the sculptor.  But do come--it will be hard on me to part from you again.  The victor does not lay aside the crown when he has just won it in hard fight.\"  \"Still I entreat you to take me back to the Serapeum,\" said Klea, laying her hand in that of Publius.  \"Is the way to Memphis too long, are you utterly tired out?\"  \"I am much wearied by agitation and terror, by anxiety and happiness, still I could very well bear the ride; but I beg of you to take me back to the temple,\"  \"What--although you feel strong enough to remain with me, and in spite of my desire to conduct you at once to Apollodorus and Irene?\"  asked Publius astonished, and he withdrew his hand.  \"The mule is waiting out there.  Lean on my arm.  Come and do as I request you.\"  \"No, Publius, no.  You are my lord and master, and I will always obey you unresistingly.  In one thing only let me have my own way, now and in the future.  As to what becomes a woman I know better than you, it is a thing that none but a woman can decide.\"  Publius made no reply to these words, but he kissed her, and threw his arm round her; and so, clasped in each other's embrace, they reached the gate of the Serapeum, there to part for a few hours.  Klea was let into the temple, and as soon as she had learned that little Philo was much better, she threw herself on her humble bed.  How lonely her room seemed, how intolerably empty without Irene.  In obedience to a hasty impulse she quitted her own bed, lay herself down on her sister's, as if that brought her nearer to the absent girl, and closed her eyes; but she was too much excited and too much exhausted to sleep soundly.  Swiftly-changing visions broke in again and again on her sincerely devotional thoughts and her restless half-sleep, painting to her fancy now wondrously bright images, and now most horrible ones--now pictures of exquisite happiness, and again others of dismal melancholy. And all the time she imagined she heard distant music and was being rocked up and down by unseen hands.  Still the image of the Roman overpowered all the rest.  At last a refreshing sleep sealed her eyes more closely, and in her dream she saw her lover's house in Rolne, his stately father, his noble mother --who seemed to her to bear a likeness to her own mother--and the figures of a number of tall and dignified senators.  She felt herself much embarrassed among all these strangers, who looked enquiringly at her, and then kindly held out their hands to her.  Even the dignified matron came to meet her with effusion, and clasped her to her breast; but just as Publius had opened his to her and she flew to his heart, and she fancied she could feel his lips pressed to hers, the woman, who called her every morning, knocked at her door and awoke her.  This time she had been happy in her dream and would willingly have slept again; but she forced herself to rise from her bed, and before the sun was quite risen she was standing by the Well of the Sun and, not to neglect her duty, she filled both the jars for the altar of the god.  Tired and half-overcome by sleep, she set the golden vessels in their place, and sat down to rest at the foot of a pillar, while a priest poured out the water she had brought, as a drink-offering on the ground.  It was now broad daylight as she looked out into the forecourt through the many-pillared hall of the temple; the early sunlight played round the columns, and its slanting rays, at this hour, fell through the tall doorway far into the great hall which usually lay in twilight gloom.  The sacred spot looked very solemn in her eyes, sublime, and as it were reconsecrated, and obeying an irresistible impulse she leaned against a column, and lifting up her arms, and raising her eyes, she uttered her thankfulness to the god for his loving kindness, and found but one thing to pray for, namely that he would preserve Publius and Irene, and all mankind, from sorrow and anxiety and deception.  She felt as if her heart had till now been benighted and dark, and had just disclosed some latent light--as if it had been withered and dry, and was now blossoming in fresh verdure and brightly-colored flowers.  To act virtuously is granted even to those who, relying on themselves. earnestlv strive to lead moral, just and honest lives; but the happy union of virtue and pure inner happiness is solemnized only in the heart which is able to seek and find a God--be it Serapis or Jehovah.  At the door of the forecourt Klea was met by Asclepiodorus, who desired her to follow him.  The high-priest had learned that she had secretly quitted the temple: when she was alone with him in a quiet room he asked her gravely and severely, why she had broken the laws and left the sanctuary without his permission.  Klea told him, that terror for her sister had driven her to Memphis, and that she there had heard that Publics Cornelius Scipio, the Roman who had taken up her father's cause, had saved Irene from king Euergetes, and placed her in safety, and that then she had set out on her way home in the middle of the night.  The high-priest seemed pleased at her news, and when she proceeded to inform him that Serapion had forsaken his cell out of anxiety for her, and had met his death in the desert, he said:  \"I knew all that, my child.  May the gods forgive the recluse, and may Serapis show him mercy in the other world in spite of his broken oath! His destiny had to be fulfilled.  You, child, were born under happier stars than he, and it is within my power to let you go unpunished.  This I  do willingly; and  Klea, if my daughter Andromeda grows up, I can only wish that she may resemble you; this is the highest praise that a father can bestow on another man's daughter.  As head of this temple I command you to fill your jars to-day, as usual, till one who is worthy of you comes to me, and asks you for his wife.  I suspect he will not be long to wait for.\"  \"How do you know, father,--\" asked Klea, coloring.  \"I can read it in your eyes,\" said Asclepiodorus, and he gazed kindly after her as, at a sign from him, she quitted the room.  As soon as he was alone he sent for his secretary and said:  \"King Philometor has commanded that his brother Euergetes' birthday shall be kept to-day in Memphis.  Let all the standards be hoisted, and the garlands of flowers which will presently arrive from Arsinoe be fastened up on the pylons; have the animals brought in for sacrifice, and arrange a procession for the afternoon.  All the dwellers in the temple must be carefully attired.  But there is another thing; Komanus has been here, and has promised us great things in Euergetes' name, and declares that he intends to punish his brother Philometor for having abducted a girl-- Irene--attached to our temple.  At the same time he requests me to send Klea the water-bearer, the sister of the girl who was carried off, to Memphis to be examined--but this may be deferred.  For to-day we will close the temple gates, solemnize the festival among ourselves, and allow no one to enter our precincts for sacrifice and prayer till the fate of the sisters is made certain.  If the kings themselves make their appearance, and want to bring their troops in, we will receive them respectfully as becomes us, but we will not give up Klea, but consign her to the holy of holies, which even Euergetes dare not enter without me; for in giving up the girl we sacrifice our dignity, and with that ourselves.\" "]]]
