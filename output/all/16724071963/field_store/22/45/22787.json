Since the day he rode towards us at Kanopus and offered me the first bouquet, with his sunny glance wooing my love, his image has stood before my soul as the embodiment of the virile strength which conquers everything, and the bright, undimmed joy which renders the whole world happy.  And now--now?  Do you remember the dull dreamer whom we left ere he set forth for Paraetonium?  But no, no, a thousand times no, he must not remain so!  Not with bowed head, but erect as in the days of happiness, must he cross the threshold of Hades, hand in hand with her whom he loved.  And he does love me still.  Else would he have followed me hither, though no magic goblet drew him after me?  And I?  The heart which, in the breast of the child, gave him its first young love, is still his, and will be forever.  Might I not go to the harbour and await him there?  Look me in the face, Charmian, and answer me as fearlessly as a mirror: did Olympus really succeed in effacing the wrinkles?\"  \"They were scarcely visible before,\" was the reply, \"and even the keenest eye could no longer discover them.  I have brought the pomade, too, and the prescription Olympus gave me for--\"  \"Hush, hush!\" interrupted Cleopatra softly.  \"There are many living creatures in this garden, and they say that even the birds are good listeners.\"  A roguish smile deepened the dimples in her cheeks as she spoke, and delight in her bewitching grace forced from Charmian's lips the exclamation:  \"If Mark Antony could only see you now!\"  \"Flatterer!\" replied the Queen with a grateful smile.  But Charmian felt that the time had now come to plead once more for Barine, and she began eagerly:  \"No, I certainly do not flatter.  No one in Alexandria, no matter what name she bears, could venture to vie even remotely with your charms.  So cease the persecution of the unfortunate woman whom you confided to my care.  It is an insult to Cleopatra--\"  But here an indignant \"Again!\"  interrupted her.  Cleopatra's face, which during the conversation had mirrored every emotion of a woman's soul, from the deepest sorrow to the most mischievous mirth, assumed an expression of repellent harshness, and, with the curt remark, \"You are forgetting what I had good reason to forbid--I must go to my work,\" she turned her back upon the companion of her youth.

D.W.]      CLEOPATRA  By Georg Ebers  Volume 7.    CHAPTER XV.  Charmain went towards her own apartments.  How often she had had a similar experience!  In the midst of the warmest admiration for this rare woman's depth of feeling, masculine strength of intellect, tireless industry, watchful care for her native land, steadfast loyalty, and maternal devotion, she had been sobered in the most pitiable way.  She had been forced to see Cleopatra, for the sake of realizing a childish dream, and impressing her lover, squander vast sums, which diminished the prosperity of her subjects; place great and important matters below the vain, punctilious care of her own person; forget, in petty jealousy, the justice and kindness which were marked traits in her character; and, though the most kindly and womanly of sovereigns, suffer herself to be urged by angry excitement to inflict outrage on a subject whose acts had awakened her displeasure.  The lofty ambition which had inspired her noblest and most praiseworthy deeds had more than once been the source of acts which she herself regretted.  When a child, she could not endure to be surpassed in difficult tasks, and still deemed it a necessity to be first and peerless.  Hence the unfortunate circumstance that Antony had given Barine the counterpart of an armlet which she herself wore as a gift from her lover, was perhaps the principal cause of her bitter resentment against the hapless woman.  Charmian had seen Cleopatra forgive freely and generously many a wrong, nay, many an affront, inflicted upon her; but to see herself placed by her husband on the same plane as a Barine, even in the most trivial matter, might easily seem to her an unbearable insult; and the mishap which had befallen Caesarion, in consequence of his foolish passion for the young beauty, gave her a right to punish her rival.  Deeply anxious concerning the fate of the woman in her care--greatly agitated, moreover, and exhausted physically and mentally--Charmian sought her own apartments.  Here she hoped to find solace in Barine's cheerful and equable nature; here the helpful hands of her dark-skinned maid and confidante awaited her.  The sun was low in the western horizon when she entered the anteroom. The members of the body-guard who were on duty told her that nothing unusual had occurred, and with a sigh of relief she passed into the sitting-room.  But the Ethiopian, who usually came to meet her with words of welcome, took her veil and wraps, and removed her shoes, was absent.  Today no one greeted her.  Not until she entered the second room, which she had assigned to her guest, did she find Barine, who was weeping bitterly.  During Charmian's absence the latter had received a letter from Alexas, in which he informed her that he was ordered by the Queen to subject her to an examination the next morning.  Her cause looked dark but, if she did not render his duty harder by the harshness which had formerly caused him much pain, he would do his utmost to protect her from imprisonment, forced labour in the mines, or even worse misfortunes.  The imprudent game which she had played with King Caesarion had unfortunately roused the people against her.  The depth of their indignation was shown by the fury with which they had assailed the house of her grandfather, Didymus. Nothing could save Dion, who had audaciously attacked the illustrious son of their beloved Queen, from the rage of the populace.  He, Alexas, knew that in this Dion she would lose a friend and protector, but he would be disposed to take his place if her conduct did not render it impossible for him to unite mercy with justice.  This shameful letter, which promised Barine clemency in return for her favour without unmasking him in his character of judge, explained to Charmian the agitation in which she found her friend's daughter.  It was doubtless a little relief to Barine to express her loathing and abhorrence of Alexas as eagerly as her gentle nature would permit, but fear, grief, and indignation continued to struggle for the mastery in her oppressed soul.  It would have been expected that the keen-witted woman would have eagerly inquired what Charmian had accomplished with the Queen and Archibius, and what new events had happened to affect Cleopatra, the state, and the city; but she questioned her with far deeper interest concerning the welfare of her lover, desiring information in regard to many things of which her friend could give no tidings.  In her brief visit to Dion's couch she had not learned how he bore his own misfortunes and Barine's, what view he took of the future, or what he expected from the woman he loved.  Charmian's ignorance and silence in regard to these very matters increased the anxiety of the endangered woman, who saw not only her own life, but those dearest to her, seriously threatened.  So she entreated her hostess to relieve her from the uncertainty which was harder to endure than the most terrible reality; but the latter either could not or would not give her any further details of Cleopatra's intentions, or the fate and present abode of her grandparents and Helena.  This increased her anxiety, for if Alexas's information was correct, her family must be homeless.  When Charmian at last admitted that she had seen Dion only a few minutes, the tortured Barine's power of quiet endurance gave way.  She, whose nature was so hopeful that, when the glow of the sunset faded, she already anticipated with delight the rosy dawn of the next day, now beheld in Cleopatra's hand the reed which was to sign the death-sentence of Dion and herself.  Her mental vision conjured up her relatives wounded by the falling house or bleeding under the stones hurled by the raging populace.  She heard Alexas command the executioner to subject her to the rack, and fancied that Anukis had not returned because she had failed to find Dion.  The Queen's soldiers had probably carried him to prison, loaded with chains, if Philostratus had not already instigated the mob to drag him through the streets.  With feverish impetuosity, which alarmed Charmian the more because it was so unlike her old friend's daughter, Barine described all the spectres with which her imagination--agitated by terror, longing, love, and loathing--terrified her; but the former exerted all the power of eloquence she possessed, by turns reproving her and loading her with caresses, in order to soothe her and rouse her from her despair.  But nothing availed.  At last she succeeded in persuading the unhappy woman to go with her to the window, which afforded a most beautiful view. Westward, beyond the Heptastadium, the sun was sinking below the forests of masts in the harbour of the Eunostus; and Charmian, who had learned from her intercourse with the royal children how to soothe a troubled young heart, to divert Barine's thoughts, directed her attention to the crimson glow in the western sky, and told her how her father, the artist, had showed her the superb brilliancy which colours gained at this hour of the day, even when the west was less radiant than now.  But Barine, who usually could never gaze her fill at such a spectacle, did not thank her, for this sunset reminded her of another which she had lately watched at Dion's side, and she again broke into convulsive sobs.  Charmian, not knowing what to do, passed her arm around her.  Just at that moment the door was hurriedly thrown open, and Anukis, the Nubian, entered.  Her mistress knew that something unusual must have happened to detain her so long from her post at Barine's side, and her appearance showed that she had been attending to important matters which had severely taxed her strength.  Her shining dark skin looked ashen grey, her high forehead, surrounded by tangled woolly locks, was dripping with perspiration, and her thick lips were pale.  Although she must have undergone great fatigue, she did not seem in need of rest; for, after greeting the ladies, apologizing for her long absence, and telling Barine that this time Dion had seemed to her half on the way to recovery, a rapid side glance at her mistress conveyed an entreaty that she would follow her into the next room.  But the language of the Nubian's eyes had not escaped the suspicious watchfulness of the anxious Barine and, overwhelmed with fresh terror, she begged that she might hear all.  Charmian ordered her maid to speak openly; but Anukis, ere she began, assured them that she had received the news she brought from a most trustworthy source--only it would make a heavy demand upon the resolution and courage of Barine, whom she had hoped to find in a very different mood.  There was no time to lose.  She was expected at the appointed place an hour after sunset.  Here Charmian interrupted the maid with the exclamation \"Impossible!\" and reminded her of the guards which Alexas, aided by Iras, who was thoroughly familiar with the palace, had stationed the day before in the anteroom, at all the doors--nay, even beneath the windows.  The Nubian replied that everything had been considered; but, to gain time, she must beg Barine to let her colour her skin and curl her hair while she was talking.  The surprise visible in the young beauty's face caused her to exclaim: \"Only act with entire confidence.  You shall learn everything directly. There is so much to tell!  On the way here I had planned how to relate the whole story in regular order, but it can't be done now.  No, no! Whoever wants to save a flock of sheep from a burning shed must lead out the bell-wether first--the main thing, I mean--so I will begin with that, though it really comes last.  The explanation of how all this--\"  Here, like a cry of joy, Barine's exclamation interrupted her:  \"I "]]]
