Katuti quailed before him, and drew back, but he followed her, seized her arm, and said huskily:  \"What did he say?\"  \"Paaker!\"  cried the widow in pain and indignation.  \"Let me go.  It is better for you that I should not repeat the words with which Rameses sought to turn Nefert's heart from you.  Let me go, and remember to whom you are speaking.\"  But Paaker gripped her elbow the tighter, and urgently repeated his question.  \"Shame upon you!\"  cried Katuti, \"you are hurting me; let me go!  You will not till you have heard what he said?  Have your own way then, but the words are forced from me!  He said that if he did not know your mother Setchem for an honest woman, he never would have believed you were your father's son--for you were no more like him than an owl to an eagle.\"  Paaker took his hand from Katuti's arm.  \"And so--and so--\" he muttered with pale lips.  \"Nefert took your part, and I too, but in vain.  Do not take the words too hardly.  Your father was a man without an equal, and Rameses cannot forget that we are related to the old royal house.  His grandfather, his father, and himself are usurpers, and there is one now living who has a better right to the throne than he has.\"  \"The Regent Ani!\"  exclaimed Paaker decisively.  Katuti nodded, she went up to the pioneer and said in a whisper:  \"I put myself in your hands, though I know they may be raised against me. But you are my natural ally, for that same act of Rameses that disgraced and injured you, made me a partner in the designs of Ani.  The king robbed you of your bride, me of my daughter.  He filled your soul with hatred for your arrogant rival, and mine with passionate regret for the lost happiness of my child.  I feel the blood of Hatasu in my veins, and my spirit is high enough to govern men.  It was I who roused the sleeping ambition of the Regent--I who directed his gaze to the throne to which he was destined by the Gods.  The ministers of the Gods, the priests, are favorably disposed to us; we have--\"  At this moment there was a commotion in the garden, and a breathless slave rushed in exclaiming \"The Regent is at the gate!\"  Paaker stood in stupid perplexity, but he collected himself with an effort and would have gone, but Katuti detained him.  \"I will go forward to meet Ani,\" she said.  \"He will be rejoiced to see you, for he esteems you highly and was a friend of your father's.\"  As soon as Katuti had left the hall, the dwarf Nemu crept out of his hiding-place, placed himself in front of Paaker, and asked boldly:  \"Well?  Did I give thee good advice yesterday, or no?\"  Put Paaker did not answer him, he pushed him aside with his foot, and walked up and down in deep thought.  Katuti met the Regent half way down the garden.  He held a manuscript roll in his hand, and greeted her from afar with a friendly wave of his hand.  The widow looked at him with astonishment.  It seemed to her that he had grown taller and younger since the last time she had seen him.  \"Hail to your highness!\"  she cried, half in joke half reverently, and she raised her hands in supplication, as if he already wore the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt.  \"Have the nine Gods met you?  have the Hathors kissed you in your slumbers?  This is a white day--a lucky day-- I read it in your face!\"  \"That is reading a cipher!\"  said Ani gaily, but with dignity.  \"Read this despatch.\"  Katuti took the roll from his hand, read it through, and then returned it.  \"The troops you equipped have conquered the allied armies of the Ethiopians,\" she said gravely, \"and are bringing their prince in fetters to Thebes, with endless treasure, and ten thousand prisoners!  The Gods be praised!\"  \"And above all things I thank the Gods that my general Scheschenk--my foster-brother and friend--is returning well and unwounded from the war. I think, Katuti, that the figures in our dreams are this day taking forms of flesh and blood!\"  \"They are growing to the stature of heroes!\"  cried the widow.  \"And you yourself, my lord, have been stirred by the breath of the Divinity.  You walk like the worthy son of Ra, the Courage of Menth beams in your eyes, and you smile like the victorious Horus.\"  \"Patience, patience my friend,\" said Ani, moderating the eagerness of the widow; \"now, more than ever, we must cling to my principle of over- estimating the strength of our opponents, and underrating our own. Nothing has succeeded on which I had counted, and on the contrary many things have justified my fears that they would fail.  The beginning of the end is hardly dawning on us.\"  \"But successes, like misfortunes, never come singly,\" replied Katuti.  \"I agree with you,\" said Ani.  \"The events of life seem to me to fall in groups.  Every misfortune brings its fellow with it--like every piece of luck.  Can you tell me of a second success?\"  \"Women win no battles,\" said the widow smiling. \"But they win allies, and I have gained a powerful one.\"  \"A God or an army?\"  asked Ani.  \"Something between the two,\" she replied.  \"Paaker, the king's chief pioneer, has joined us;\" and she briefly related to Ani the history of her nephew's love and hatred.  Ani listened in silence; then he said with an expression of much disquiet and anxiety:  \"This man is a follower of Rameses, and must shortly return to him.  Many may guess at our projects, but every additional person who knows them may be come a traitor.  You are urging me, forcing me, forward too soon.  A thousand well-prepared enemies are less dangerous than one untrustworthy ally--\"  \"Paaker is secured to us,\" replied Katuti positively.  \"Who will answer for him?\"  asked Ani.  \"His life shall be in your hand,\" replied Katuti gravely.  \"My shrewd little dwarf Nemu knows that he has committed some secret crime, which the law punishes by death.\"  The Regent's countenance cleared.  That alters the matter,\" he said with satisfaction.  \"Has he committed a murder?\"  \"No,\" said Katuti, \"but Nemu has sworn to reveal to you alone all that he knows.  He is wholly devoted to us.\"  \"Well and good,\" said Ani thoughtfully, but he too is imprudent--much too imprudent.  You are like a rider, who to win a wager urges his horse to leap over spears.  If he falls on the points, it is he that suffers; you let him lie there, and go on your way.\"  \"Or are impaled at the same time as the noble horse,\" said Katuti gravely.  \"You have more to win, and at the same time more to lose than we; but the meanest clings to life; and I must tell you, Ani, that I work for you, not to win any thing through your success, but because you are as dear to me as a brother, and because I see in you the embodiment of my father's claims which have been trampled on.\"  Ani gave her his hand and asked:  \"Did you also as my friend speak to Bent-Anat?  Do I interpret your silence rightly?\"  Katuti sadly shook her head; but Ani went on: \"Yesterday that would have decided me to give her up; but to-day my courage has risen, and if the Hathors be my friends I may yet win her.\"  With these words he went in advance of the widow into the hall, where Paaker was still walking uneasily up and down.  The pioneer bowed low before the Regent, who returned the greeting with a half-haughty, half-familiar wave of the hand, and when he had seated himself in an arm-chair politely addressed Paaker as the son of a friend, and a relation of his family.  \"All the world,\" he said, \"speaks of your reckless courage.  Men like you are rare; I have none such attached to me.  I wish you stood nearer to me; but Rameses will not part with you, although--although--In point of fact your office has two aspects; it requires the daring of a soldier, and the dexterity of a scribe.  No one denies that you have the first, but the second--the sword and the reed-pen are very different weapons, one requires supple fingers, the other a sturdy fist.  The king used to complain of your reports--is be better satisfied with them now?\"  \"I hope so,\" replied the Mohar; \"my brother Horus is a practised writer, and accompanies me in my journeys.\"  \"That is well,\" said Ani.  \"If I had the management of affairs I should treble your staff, and give you four--five--six scribes under you, who should be entirely at your command, and to whom you could give the materials for the reports to be sent out.  Your office demands that you should be both brave and circumspect; these characteristics are rarely united; but there are scriveners by hundreds in the temples.\"  \"So it seems to me,\" said Paaker.  Ani looked down meditatively, and continued--Rameses is fond of comparing you with your father.  That is unfair, for he--who is now with the justified--was without an equal; at once the bravest of heroes and the most skilful of scribes.  You are judged unjustly; and it grieves me all the more that you belong, through your mother, to my poor but royal house.  We will see whether I cannot succeed in putting you in the right place.  For the present you are required in Syria almost as soon as you have got home.  You have shown that you are a man who does not fear death, and who can render good service, and you might now enjoy your wealth in peace with your wife.\"  \"I am alone,\" said Paaker.  \"Then, if you come home again, let Katuti seek you out the prettiest wife in Egypt,\" said the Regent smiling.  \"She sees herself every day in her mirror, and must be a connoisseur in the charms of women.\"  Ani rose with these words, bowed to Paaker with studied friendliness, gave his hand to Katuti, and said as he left the hall:  \"Send me to-day the--the handkerchief--by the dwarf Nemu.\"  When he was already in the garden, he turned once more and said to Paaker  \"Some friends are supping with me to-day; pray let me see you too.\"  The pioneer bowed; he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5442"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 04 (#8)"],["body","perceived that he was entangled in invisible toils.  Up to the present moment he had been proud of his devotion to his calling, of his duties as Mohar; and now he had discovered that the king, whose chain of honor hung round his neck, undervalued him, and perhaps only suffered him to fill his arduous and dangerous post for the sake of his father, while he, notwithstanding the temptations offered him in Thebes by his wealth, had accepted it willingly and disinterestedly. He knew that his skill with the pen was small, but that was no reason why he should be despised; often had he wished that he could reconstitute his office exactly as Ani had suggested, but his petition to be allowed a secretary had been rejected by Rameses.  What he spied out, he was told was to be kept secret, and no one could be responsible for the secrecy of another.  As his brother Horus grew up, he had followed him as his obedient assistant, even after he had married a wife, who, with her child, remained in Thebes under the care of Setchem.  He was now filling Paaker's place in Syria during his absence; badly enough, as the pioneer thought, and yet not without credit; for the fellow knew how to write smooth words with a graceful pen.  Paaker, accustomed to solitude, became absorbed in thought, forgetting everything that surrounded him; even the widow herself, who had sunk on to a couch, and was observing him in silence.  He gazed into vacancy, while a crowd of sensations rushed confusedly through his brain.  He thought himself cruelly ill-used, and he felt too that it was incumbent on him to become the instrument of a terrible fate to some other person.  All was dim 'and chaotic in his mind, his love merged in his hatred; only one thing was clear and unclouded by doubt, and that was his strong conviction that Nefert would be his.  The Gods indeed were in deep disgrace with him.  How much he had expended upon them--and with what a grudging hand they had rewarded him; he knew of but one indemnification for his wasted life, and in that he believed so firmly that he counted on it as if it were capital which he had invested in sound securities.  But at this moment his resentful feelings embittered the sweet dream of hope, and he strove in vain for calmness and clear-sightedness; when such cross-roads as these met, no amulet, no divining rod could guide him; here he must think for himself, and beat his own road before he could walk in it; and yet he could think out no plan, and arrive at no decision.  He grasped his burning forehead in his hands, and started from his brooding reverie, to remember where he was, to recall his conversation with the mother of the woman he loved, and her saying that she was capable of guiding men.  \"She perhaps may be able to think for me,\" he muttered to himself. \"Action suits me better.\"  He slowly went up to her and said:  \"So it is settled then--we are confederates.\"  \"Against Rameses, and for Ani,\" she replied, giving him her slender hand.  \"In a few days I start for Syria, meanwhile you can make up your mind what commissions you have to give me.  The money for your son shall be conveyed to you to-day before sunset.  May I not pay my respects to Nefert?\"  \"Not now, she is praying in the temple.\"  \"But to-morrow?\"  \"Willingly, my dear friend.  She will be delighted to see you, and to thank you.\"  \"Farewell, Katuti.\"  \"Call me mother,\" said the widow, and she waved her veil to him as a last farewell.     CHAPTER XIX.  As soon as Paaker had disappeared behind the shrubs, Katuti struck a little sheet of metal, a slave appeared, and Katuti asked her whether Nefert had returned from the temple.  \"Her litter is just now at the side gate,\" was the answer.  \"I await her here,\" said the widow.  The slave went away, and a few minutes later Nefert entered the hall.  \"You want me?\"  she said; and after kissing her mother she sank upon her couch.  \"I am tired,\" she exclaimed, \"Nemu, take a fan and keep the flies off me.\"  The dwarf sat down on a cushion by her couch, and began to wave the semi- circular fan of ostrich-feathers; but Katuti put him aside and said:  \"You can leave us for the present; we want to speak to each other in private.\"  The dwarf shrugged his shoulders and got up, but Nefert looked at her mother with an irresistible appeal.  \"Let him stay,\" she said, as pathetically as if her whole happiness depended upon it.  \"The flies torment me so, and Nemu always holds his tongue.\"  She patted the dwarf's big head as if he were a lap-dog, and called the white cat, which with a graceful leap sprang on to her shoulder and stood there with its back arched, to be stroked by her slender fingers.  Nemu looked enquiringly at his mistress, but Katuti turned to her daughter, and said in a warning voice:  \"I have very serious things to discuss with you.\"  \"Indeed?\"  said her daughter, \"but I cannot be stung by the flies all the same.  Of course, if you wish it--\"  \"Nemu may stay then,\" said Katuti, and her voice had the tone of that of a nurse who gives way to a naughty child.  \"Besides, he knows what I have to talk about.\"  \"There now!\"  said Nefert, kissing the head of the white cat, and she gave the fan back to the dwarf.  The widow looked at her daughter with sincere compassion, she went up to her and looked for the thousandth time in admiration at her pretty face.  \"Poor child,\" she sighed, \"how willingly I would spare you the frightful news which sooner or later you must hear--must bear.  Leave off your foolish play with the cat, I have things of the most hideous gravity to tell you.\"  \"Speak on,\" replied Nefert.  \"To-day I cannot fear the worst.  Mena's star, the haruspex told me, stands under the sign of happiness, and I enquired of the oracle in the temple of Besa, and heard that my husband is prospering.  I have prayed in the temple till I am quite content. Only speak!--I know my brother's letter from the camp had no good news in it; the evening before last I saw you had been crying, and yesterday you did not look well; even the pomegranate flowers in your hair did not suit you.\"  \"Your brother,\" sighed Katuti, \"has occasioned me great trouble, and we might through him have suffered deep dishonor--\"  \"We-dishonor?\"  exclaimed Nefert, and she nervously clutched at the cat.  \"Your brother lost enormous sums at play; to recover them he pledged the mummy of your father--\"  \"Horrible!\"  cried  Nefert.  \"We must appeal at once to the king;--I will write to him myself; for Mena's sake he will hear me.  Rameses is great and noble, and will not let a house that is faithfully devoted to him fall into disgrace through the reckless folly of a boy.  Certainly I will write to him.\"  She said this in a voice of most childlike confidence, and desired Nemu to wave the fan more gently, as if this concern were settled.  In Katuti's heart surprise and indignation at the unnatural indifference of her daughter were struggling together; but she withheld all blame, and said carelessly:  \"We are already released, for my nephew Paaker, as soon as he heard what threatened us, offered me his help; freely and unprompted, from pure goodness of heart and attachment.\"  \"How good of Paaker!\"  cried Nefert.  \"He was so fond of me, and you know, mother, I always stood up for him.  No doubt it was for my sake that he behaved so generously!\"  The young wife laughed, and pulling the cat's face close to her own, held her nose to its cool little nose, stared into its green eyes, and said, imitating childish talk:  \"There now, pussy--how kind people are to your little mistress.\"  Katuti was vexed daughter's childish impulses.  \"It seems to me,\" she said, \"that you might leave off playing and trifling when I am talking of such serious matters.  I have long since observed that the fate of the house to which your father and mother belong is a matter of perfect indifference to you; and yet you would have to seek shelter and protection under its roof if your husband--\"  \"Well, mother?\"  asked Nefert breathing more quickly.  As soon as Katuti perceived her daughter's agitation she regretted that she had not more gently led up to the news she had to break to her; for she loved her daughter, and knew that it would give her keen pain.  So she went on more sympathetically:  \"You boasted in joke that people are good to you, and it is true; you win hearts by your mere being--by only being what you are.  And Mena too loved you tenderly; but 'absence,' says the proverb, 'is the one real enemy,' and Mena--\"  \"What has Mena done?\"  Once more Nefert interrupted her mother, and her nostrils quivered.  \"Mena,\" said Katuti, decidedly, \"has violated the truth and esteem which he owes you--he has trodden them under foot, and--\"  \"Mena?\"  exclaimed the young wife with flashing eyes; she flung the cat on the floor, and sprang from her couch.  \"Yes--Mena,\" said Katuti firmly.  \"Your brother writes that he would have neither silver nor gold for his spoil, but took the fair daughter of the prince of the Danaids into his tent.  The ignoble wretch!\"  \"Ignoble wretch!\"  cried Nefert, and two or three times she repeated her mother's last words.  Katuti drew back in horror, for her gentle, docile, childlike daughter stood before her absolutely transfigured beyond all recognition.  She looked like a beautiful demon of revenge; her eyes sparkled, her breath came quickly, her limbs quivered, and with extraordinary strength and rapidity she seized the dwarf by the hand, led him to the door of one of the rooms which opened out of the hall, threw it open, pushed the little man over the threshold, and closed it sharply upon him; then with white lips she came up to her mother.  \"An ignoble wretch did you call him?\"  she cried out with a hoarse husky voice, \"an ignoble wretch!  Take back your words, mother, take back your words, or--\"  Katuti turned paler and paler, and said soothingly:  \"The words may sound hard, but he has broken faith with you, and openly dishonored you.\"  \"And shall I"]]]
