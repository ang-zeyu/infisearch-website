Look what a half-abandoned spot my house is!  Which is the lonelier do you think, you or I?\"  \"I,\" said Nefert.  \"For no one is so lonely as a wife parted from the husband her heart longs after.\"  \"But you trust Mena's love for you?\"  asked Bent-Anat.  Nefert pressed her hand to her heart and nodded assent:  \"And he will return, and with him your happiness.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Nefert softly.  \"And he who hopes,\" said Bent Anat, \"possesses already the joys of the future.  Tell me, would you have changed places with the Gods so long as Mena was with you?  No!  Then you are most fortunate, for blissful memories--the joys of the past--are yours at any rate.  What is the present?  I speak of it, and it is no more.  Now, I ask you, what joys can I look forward to, and what certain happiness am I justified in hoping for?  \"Thou dost not love any one,\" replied Nefert.  \"Thou dost follow thy own course, calm and undeviating as the moon above us.  The highest joys are unknown to thee, but for the same reason thou dost not know the bitterest pain.\"  \"What pain?\"  asked the princess.  \"The torment of a heart consumed by the fires of Sechet,\" replied Nefert.  The princess looked thoughtfully at the ground, then she turned her eyes eagerly on her friend.  \"You are mistaken,\" she said; \"I know what love and longing are.  But you need only wait till a feast day to wear the jewel that is your own, while my treasure is no more mine than a pearl that I see gleaming at the bottom of the sea.\"  \"Thou canst love!\"  exclaimed Nefert with joyful excitement.  \"Oh! I thank Hathor that at last she has touched thy heart.  The daughter of Rameses need not even send for the diver to fetch the jewel out of the sea; at a sign from her the pearl will rise of itself, and lie on the sand at her slender feet.\"  Bent-Anat smiled and kissed Nefert's brow.  \"How it excites you,\" she said, \"and stirs your heart and tongue!  If two strings are tuned in harmony, and one is struck, the other sounds, my music master tells me.  I believe you would listen to me till morning if I only talked to you about my love.  But it was not for that that we came out on the balcony.  Now listen!  I am as lonely as you, I love less happily than you, the House of Seti threatens me with evil times--and yet I can preserve my full confidence in life and my joy in existence.  How can you explain this?\"  \"We are so very different,\" said Nefert.  \"True,\" replied Bent-Anat, \"but we are both young, both women, and both wish to do right.  My mother died, and I have had no one to guide me, for I who for the most part need some one to lead me can already command, and be obeyed.  You had a mother to bring you up, who, when you were still a child, was proud of her pretty little daughter, and let her--as it became her so well-dream and play, without warning her against the dangerous propensity.  Then Mena courted you.  You love him truly, and in four long years he has been with you but a month or two; your mother remained with you, and you hardly observed that she was managing your own house for you, and took all the trouble of the household.  You had a great pastime of your own--your thoughts of Mena, and scope for a thousand dreams in your distant love.  I know it, Nefert; all that you have seen and heard and felt in these twenty months has centred in him and him alone.  Nor is it wrong in itself.  The rose tree here, which clings to my balcony, delights us both; but if the gardener did not frequently prune it and tie it with palm-bast, in this soil, which forces everything to rapid growth, it would soon shoot up so high that it would cover door and window, and I should sit in darkness.  Throw this handkerchief over your shoulders, for the dew falls as it grows cooler, and listen to me a little longer!--The beautiful passion of love and fidelity has grown unchecked in your dreamy nature to such a height, that it darkens your spirit and your judgment. Love, a true love, it seems to me, should be a noble fruit-tree, and not a rank weed.  I do not blame you, for she who should have been the gardener did not heed--and would not heed--what was happening.  Look, Nefert, so long as I wore the lock of youth, I too did what I fancied-- I never found any pleasure in dreaming, but in wild games with my brothers, in horses and in falconry; they often said I had the spirit of a boy, and indeed I would willingly have been a boy.\"  \"Not I--never!\"  said Nefert.  \"You are just a rose--my dearest,\" said Bent-Anat.  \"Well! when I was fifteen I was so discontented, so insubordinate and full of all sorts of wild behavior, so dissatisfied in spite of all the kindness and love that surrounded me--but I will tell you what happened.  It is four years ago, shortly before your wedding with Mena; my father called me to play draughts.       [At Medinet Habu a picture represents Rameses the Third, not Rameses      the Second, playing at draughts with his daughter.]  You know how certainly he could beat the most skilful antagonist; but that day his thoughts were wandering, and I won the game twice following. Full of insolent delight, I jumped up and kissed his great handsome forehead, and cried 'The sublime God, the hero, under whose feet the strange nations writhe, to whom the priests and the people pray--is beaten by a girl!'  He smiled gently, and answered 'The Lords of Heaven are often outdone by the Ladies, and Necheb, the lady of victory, is a woman.  Then he grew graver, and said: 'You call me a God, my child, but in this only do I feel truly godlike, that at every moment I strive to the utmost to prove myself useful by my labors; here restraining, there promoting, as is needful.  Godlike I can never be but by doing or producing something great!  These words, Nefert, fell like seeds in my soul.  At last I knew what it was that was wanting to me; and when, a few weeks later, my father and your husband took the field with a hundred thousand fighting men, I resolved to be worthy of my godlike father, and in my little circle to be of use too!  You do not know all that is done in the houses behind there, under my direction.  Three hundred girls spin pure flax, and weave it into bands of linen for the wounds of the soldiers; numbers of children, and old women, gather plants on the mountains, and others sort them according to the instructions of a physician; in the kitchens no banquets are prepared, but fruits are preserved in sugar for the loved ones, and the sick in the camp.  Joints of meat are salted, dried, and smoked for the army on its march through the desert.  The butler no longer thinks of drinking-bouts, but brings me wine in great stone jars; we pour it into well-closed skins for the soldiers, and the best sorts we put into strong flasks, carefully sealed with pitch, that they may perform the journey uninjured, and warm and rejoice the hearts of our heroes.  All that, and much more, I manage and arrange, and my days pass in hard work.  The Gods send me no bright visions in the night, for after utter fatigue--I sleep soundly.  But I know that I am of use.  I can hold my head proudly, because in some degree I resemble my great father; and if the king thinks of me at all I know he can rejoice in the doings of his child.  That is the end of it, Nefert--and I only say, Come and join me, work with me, prove yourself of use, and compel Mena to think of his wife, not with affection only, but with pride.\"  Nefert let her head sink slowly on Bent-Anat's bosom, threw her arms round her neck, and wept like a child.  At last she composed herself and said humbly:  \"Take me to school, and teach me to be useful.\"  \"I knew,\" said the princess smiling, \"that you only needed a guiding hand.  Believe me, you will soon learn to couple content and longing.  But now hear this!  At present go home to your mother, for it is late; and meet her lovingly, for that is the will of the Gods.  To-morrow morning I will go to see you, and beg Katuti to let you come to me as companion in the place of my lost friend.  The day after to-morrow you will come to me in the palace. You can live in the rooms of my departed friend and begin, as she had done, to help me in my work.  May these hours be blest to you!\"     CHAPTER XXII.  At the time of this conversation the leech Nebsecht still lingered in front of the hovel of the paraschites, and waited with growing impatience for the old man's return.  At first he trembled for him; then he entirely forgot the danger into which he had thrown him, and only hoped for the fulfilment of his desires, and for wonderful revelations through his investigations of the human heart.  For some minutes he gave himself up to scientific considerations; but he became more and more agitated by anxiety for the paraschites, and by the exciting vicinity of Uarda.  For hours he had been alone with her, for her father and grandmother could no longer stop away from their occupations.  The former must go to escort prisoners of war to Hermonthis, and the old woman, since her granddaughter had been old enough to undertake the small duties of the household, had been one of the wailing-women, who, with hair all dishevelled, accompanied the corpse on its way to the grave, weeping, and lamenting, and casting Nile-mud on their forehead and breast.  Uarda still lay, when the sun was sinking, in front of the hut.  She looked weary and pale.  Her long hair had come undone, and once more got entangled with the straw of her humble couch.  If Nebsecht went near her to feel her pulse or to speak to her she carefully turned her face from him.  Nevertheless when the sun disappeared behind the rocks he bent over her once more, and said:  \"It is growing cool; shall I carry you indoors?\"  \"Let me alone,\" she said crossly.  \"I am hot, keep farther away.  I am no longer ill, and could go indoors by myself if I wished; but grandmother will be here directly.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5443"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 05 (#4)"],["body","rose, and sat down on a hen-coop that was some paces from Uarda, and asked stammering, \"Shall I go farther off?\"  \"Do as you please,\" she answered.  \"You are not kind,\" he said sadly.  \"You sit looking at me,\" said Uarda, \"I cannot bear it; and I am uneasy --for grandfather was quite different this morning from his usual self, and talked strangely about dying, and about the great price that was asked of him for curing me.  Then he begged me never to forget him, and was so excited and so strange.  He is so long away; I wish he were here, with me.\"  And with these words Uarda began to cry silently.  A nameless anxiety for the paraschites seized Nebsecht, and it struck him to the heart that he had demanded a human life in return for the mere fulfilment of a duty. He knew the law well enough, and knew that the old man would be compelled without respite or delay to empty the cup of poison if he were found guilty of the theft of a human heart.  It was dark:  Uarda ceased weeping and said to the surgeon:  \"Can it be possible that he has gone into the city to borrow the great sum of money that thou--or thy temple--demanded for thy medicine?  But there is the princess's golden bracelet, and half of father's prize, and in the chest two years' wages that grandmother had earned by wailing lie untouched.  Is all that not enough?\"  The girl's last question was full of resentment and reproach, and Nebsecht, whose perfect sincerity was part of his very being, was silent, as he would not venture to say yes.  He had asked more in return for his help than gold or silver.  Now he remembered Pentaur's warning, and when the jackals began to bark he took up the fire-stick,       [The hieroglyphic sign Sam seems to me to represent the wooden stick      used to produce fire (as among some savage tribes) by rapid friction      in a hollow piece of wood.]  and lighted some fuel that was lying ready.  Then he asked himself what Uarda's fate would be without her grandparents, and a strange plan which had floated vaguely before him for some hours, began now to take a distinct outline and intelligible form.  He determined if the old man did not return to ask the kolchytes or embalmers to admit him into their guild--and for the sake of his adroitness they were not likely to refuse him--then he would make Uarda his wife, and live apart from the world, for her, for his studies, and for his new calling, in which he hoped to learn a great deal.  What did he care for comfort and proprieties, for recognition from his fellow-men, and a superior position!  He could hope to advance more quickly along the new stony path than on the old beaten track.  The impulse to communicate his acquired knowledge to others he did not feel.  Knowledge in itself amply satisfied him, and be thought no more of his ties to the House of Seti.  For three whole days he had not changed his garments, no razor had touched his chin or his scalp, not a drop of water had wetted his hands or his feet.  He felt half bewildered and almost as if he had already become an embalmer, nay even a paraschites, one of the most despised of human beings.  This self- degradation had an infinite charm, for it brought him down to the level of Uarda, and she, lying near him, sick and anxious, with her dishevelled hair, exactly suited the future which he painted to himself.  \"Do you hear nothing?\"  Uarda asked suddenly.  He listened.  In the valley there was a barking of dogs, and soon the paraschites and his wife appeared, and, at the door of their hut, took leave of old Hekt, who had met them on her return from Thebes.  \"You have been gone a long time,\" cried Uarda, when her grandmother once more stood before her.  \"I have been so frightened.\"  \"The doctor was with you,\" said the old woman going into the house to prepare their simple meal, while the paraschites knelt down by his granddaughter, and caressed her tenderly, but yet with respect, as if he were her faithful servant rather than her blood-relation.  Then he rose, and gave to Nebsecht, who was trembling with excitement, the bag of coarse linen which he was in the habit of carrying tied to him by a narrow belt.  \"The heart is in that,\" he whispered to the leech; \"take it out, and give me back the bag, for my knife is in it, and I want it.\"  Nebsecht took the heart out of the covering with trembling hands and laid it carefully down.  Then he felt in the breast of his dress, and going up to the paraschites he whispered:  \"Here, take the writing, hang it round your neck, and when you die I will have the book of scripture wrapped up in your mummy cloths like a great man.  But that is not enough.  The property that I inherited is in the hands of my brother, who is a good man of business, and I have not touched the interest for ten years.  I will send it to you, and you and your wife shall enjoy an old age free from care.\"  \"The paraschites had taken the little bag with the strip of papyrus, and heard the leech to the end.  Then he turned from him saying: \"Keep thy money; we are quits.  That is if the child gets well,\" he added humbly.  \"She is already half cured,\" stammered Nebsecht.  \"But why will you--why won't you accept--\"  \"Because till to day I have never begged nor borrowed,\" said the paraschites, \"and I will not begin in my old age.  Life for life.  But what I have done this day not Rameses with all his treasure could repay.\"  Nebsecht looked down, and knew not how to answer the old man.  His wife now came out; she set a bowl of lentils that she had hastily warmed before the two men, with radishes and onions,       [Radishes, onions, and garlic were the hors-d'oeuvre of an Egyptian      dinner.  1600 talents worth were consumed, according to Herodotus.      during the building of the pyramid of Cheops--L360,000 (in 1881.)]  then she helped Uarda, who did not need to be carried, into the house, and invited Nebsecht to share their meal.  He accepted her invitation, for he had eaten nothing since the previous evening.  When the old woman had once more disappeared indoors, he asked the paraschites:  \"Whose heart is it that you have brought me, and how did it come into your hands?\"  \"Tell me first,\" said the other, \"why thou hast laid such a heavy sin upon my soul?\"  \"Because I want to investigate the structure of the human heart,\" said Nebsecht, \"so that, when I meet with diseased hearts, I may be able to cure them.\"  The paraschites looked for a long time at the ground in silence; then he said:  \"Art thou speaking the truth?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the leech with convincing emphasis.  \"I am glad,\" said the old man, \"for thou givest help to the poor.\"  \"As willingly as to the rich!\"  exclaimed Nebsecht.  \"But tell me now where you got the heart.\"  \"I went into the house of the embalmer,\" said the old man, after he had selected a few large flints, to which, with crafty blows, he gave the shape of knives, \"and there I found three bodies in which I had to make the eight prescribed incisions with my flint-knife.  When the dead lie there undressed on the wooden bench they all look alike, and the begger lies as still as the favorite son of a king.  But I knew very well who lay before me.  The strong old body in the middle of the table was the corpse of the Superior of the temple of Hatasu, and beyond, close by each other, were laid a stone-mason of the Necropolis, and a poor girl from the strangers' quarter, who had died of consumption--two miserable wasted figures.  I had known the Prophet well, for I had met him a hundred times in his gilt litter, and we always called him Rui, the rich.  I did my duty by all three, I was driven away with the usual stoning, and then I arranged the inward parts of the bodies with my mates.  Those of the Prophet are to be preserved later in an alabaster canopus,       [This vase was called canopus at a later date.  There were four of      them for each mummy.]  those of the mason and the girl were put back in their bodies.  \"Then I went up to the three bodies, and I asked myself, to which I should do such a wrong as to rob him of his heart.  I turned to the two poor ones, and I hastily went up to the sinning girl.  Then I heard the voice of the demon that cried out in my heart 'The girl was poor and despised like you while she walked on Seb,       [Seb is the earth; Plutarch calls Seb Chronos.  He is often spoken      of as the \"father of the gods\" on the monuments.  He is the god of      time, and as the Egyptians regarded matter as eternal, it is not by      accident that the sign which represented the earth was also used for      eternity.]  perhaps she may find compensation and peace in the other world if you do not mutilate her; and when I turned to the mason's lean corpse, and looked at his hands, which were harder and rougher than my own, the demon whispered the same.  Then I stood before the strong, stout corpse of the prophet Rui, who died of apoplexy, and I remembered the honor and the riches that he had enjoyed on earth, and that he at least for a time had known happiness and ease.  And as soon as I was alone, I slipped my hand into the bag, and changed the sheep's heart for his.  \"Perhaps I am doubly guilty for playing such an accursed trick with the heart of a high-priest; but Rui's body will be hung round with a hundred amulets, Scarabaei       [Imitations of the sacred beetle Scarabaeus made of various      materials were frequently put into the mummies in the place of the      heart.  Large specimens have often the 26th, 30th, and 64th chapters      of the Book of the Dead engraved on them, as they treat of the      heart.  will be placed over his heart, and holy oil and sacred sentences will preserve him from all the fiends on his road to Amenti,--[Underworld]-- while no one will devote helping talismans to the poor.  And then! thou hast sworn, in that world, in the hall of judgment, to take my guilt on thyself.\"  Nebsecht gave the old man his hand.  \"That I will,\" said he, \"and I should have"]]]
