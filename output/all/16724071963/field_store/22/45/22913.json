At her house he had met her husband's brother, a jovial old fellow named Chrysippus; and when the conversation turned on the tapestry, and the Mukaukas' purpose of dedicating this work of art with all the gems worked into it, to the Church, the old man had clasped his hands, fully sharing Orion's disapproval, and had exclaimed laughing \"What, you the son, and is not even a part of the precious stones to fall to your share?  Why Katharina?  Just a little diamond, a tiny opal might well add to the earthly happiness of the young, though the old must lay up treasure in heaven.--Do not be a fool!  The Church's maw is full enough, and really a mouthful is your due.\"  And then they drank a good deal of fine wine, till at last the older man had accompanied Orion home, to stretch his limbs in the cool night air. A litter was carried behind him for him to return in, and all the way he had continued to persuade the youth to induce his father not to fling the whole treasure into the jaws of the Church, but to spare him a few stones at least for a more pleasing use.  They had laughed over it a good deal, and Orion in his heart had thought Chrysippus very right, and had remembered Heliodora, and her love of large, handsome gems, and the keepsake he owed her.  But that neither his father nor his mother would remove a single stone, and that the whole hanging would be dedicated, was beyond a doubt; at the same time, some of this superfluous splendor was in fact his due as their son, and a prettier gift to Heliodora than the large emerald could not be imagined.  Yes--and she should have it!  How delighted she would be!  He even thought of the chief idea for the verses to accompany the gift.  He had the key of the tablinum, in which the work was lying, about his person; and when, on his return, he found the servants still sitting round the fire, he shut the door of the out-buildings while a feeling came over him which he remembered having experienced last on occasions when he and his brothers had robbed a forbidden fruit-tree.  He was on the point of giving up his mad project; and when, in the tablinum itself, a horrible inward tremor again came over him he had actually turned to retreat--but he remembered old Chrysippus and his prompts.  To turn and fly now would be cowardice.  Heliodora must have the large emerald, and with his verses; his father might give away all the rest as he pleased. When he was kneeling in front of the work with his knife in his hand, that sickening terror had come over him for the third time; if the large emerald had not come off into his hand at the first effort he would certainly have rolled the bale up again and have left the tablinum clean- handed.  But the evil demon had been at his elbow, had thrust the gem into his hand, as it were, so that two cuts with the knife had sufficed to displace it from its setting.  It rolled into his hand and he felt its noble weight; he cast aside all care, and had thought no more with anything but pleasure of this splendid trick, which he would relate to-morrow to old Chrysippus--of course under seal of secrecy.  But now, in the sober light of day, how different did this mad, rash deed appear; how heavily had he already been punished; what consequences might it not entail?  His hatred of Paula grew every minute: she had certainly seen all that had happened and would not hesitate to betray him--that she had shown last night.  War, as it were, was declared between them, and he vowed to himself, with fire in his eyes, that he would not shirk it!  At the same time he could not deny that she had never looked handsomer than when she stood, with hair half undone, confronting him--threatening him. \"It is to be love or hate between us.\"  he muttered to himself. \"No half-measures: and she has chosen hate!  Good!  Hitherto I have only had to fight against men; but this bold, hard, and scornful maiden, who rejects every gentle feeling, is no despicable foe.  She has me at bay. If she does her worst by me I will return it in kind!--And who is the owner of the shoes?  I have taken all possible means to find him. Shameful, shameful! that I cannot hold up my head to look boldly at my own face in the glass.  Heliodora is a sweet creature, an angel of kindness.  She loved me truly; but this--this--Ah; even for her, this is too great a sacrifice!\"  He pressed his hand to his brow and flung himself on a divan.  He might well be weary, for he had not closed his eyes for more than thirty hours and had already done much business that morning.  He had given orders to Sebek the house-steward and to the captain of the Egyptian guard to hunt out the owner of the sandals by the aid of the dogs, and to cast him into prison; next he had of his own accord--since his father generally did not fall asleep till the morning and had not yet left his room--tried to pacify the Arab merchant with regard to the mishap that had befallen his head man under the governor's roof; but with small success.  Finally the young man had indulged his desire to compose a few lines addressed to the fair Heliodora--for there was no form of physical or mental effort to which he was not trained.  He had not lost the idea that had occurred to him yesterday before his theft in the tablinum, and to put it into verse was in his present mood an easy task.  He wrote as follows:       \"'Like liketh like' saith the saw; and like to like is but fitting.      Yet, in the hardest of gems thy soft nature rejoices?      Nay, but if noble and rare, if its beauty is priceless,      Then, Heliodora, the stone is like thee--akin to thy beauty.      Thus let this emerald please thee;--and know that the fire      That fills it with light burns more fierce in the heart of thy                                                             Friend.\"  He penned the lines rapidly; and as he did so he felt, he knew not why, an excited thrill, as though every word he threw off was a blow aimed at Paula.  Last night he had intended to send the costly jewel to the handsome widow in a suitable setting; but now it would be madly imprudent to order such a thing.  He must send it away at once; he had hastened to pack it up with the verses, with his own hand, and entrusted it to Chusar, a horsedealer's groom from Constantinople, who had brought his Pannonian steeds to Memphis.  He had himself seen off this trustworthy messenger, who could speak no Egyptian and very little Greek, and when his horse was lost to sight in the dust of the road leading to Alexandria he had returned home in a calmer mood.  Ships were constantly putting to sea from that port for Constantinople, and Chusar was enjoined to sail by the first that should be leaving.  At least the odious deed should not have been committed in vain; and yet he would have given a year of his life if now he could but know that it had never been done.  \"Impossible!\"  and \"Curse it!\"  were the words he had most frequently repeated in the course of his retrospect during the past night and morning.  How he had had to rush and hurry under the broiling sun! and the sense of being compelled to do so for mere concealment's sake seemed to him--who had never in his life before done anything that he could not justify in the eyes of honest men--so humiliating, that it brought the sweat to his burning brow.  He--Orion--to dread discovery as a thief! It was inconceivable, and he was afraid, positively afraid for the first time since his boyhood.  His fortunate star, which in the Capital had shone on him so brightly and benevolently, seemed to have proved faithless in this ruinous hole!  What had that Persian girl taken into her crazy head that she must rush upon him like some furious beast of prey?  He had been bound to her once, no doubt, by a transient passion-- and what youth of his age was blind to the charms of a pretty slave-girl? She had been a lovely child, and it was a vexation, nay a grief to him, that she should have been so shamefully punished.  If she should recover, and he could have prayed that she might, it would of course be his part to provide for her--of course.  To be just, he could not but confess that she indeed had good reason to hate him: but Paula?  He had shown her nothing but kindness and yet how unhesitatingly, how openly she had displayed her enmity.  He could see her now with the name \"murderer\" on her quivering lips; the word had stung him like a lance-thrust.  What a hideous, degrading and unjust accusation lay in that exclamation!  Should he submit to it unrevenged?  Was she as innocent as she was haughty and cold?  What was she doing in the viridarium at midnight?--For she must have been there before that ill-starred dog flew at Mandane.  An assignation with the owner of the shoes his mother had found was out of the question, for they belonged to some man about the stables.  Love, thought he, for a wonder had nothing to do with it; but as he came in he had noticed a man crossing the court- yard who looked like Paula's freedman, Hiram the trainer.  Probably she had arranged a meeting with her stammering friend in order--in order?-- Well, there was but one thing that seemed likely: She was plotting to fly from his parents' house and needed this man's assistance.  He had seen within a few hours of his return that his mother did not make life sweet to the girl, and yet his father had very possibly opposed her wish to seek another home.  But why should she avoid and hate him?  In that expedition on the river and on their way home he could have sworn that she loved him, and the remembrance of those hours brought her near to him again, and wiped out his schemes of vengeance against her, of punishment to be visited on her.  Then he thought of little Katharina whom his mother intended him to marry, and at the thought he laughed softly to himself.

D.W.]      THE BRIDE OF THE NILE  By Georg Ebers  Volume 3.    CHAPTER X.  After the great excitement of the night Paula had thrown herself on her bed with throbbing pulses.  Sleep would not come to her, and so at rather more than two hours after sunrise she went to the window to close the shutters.  As she did so she looked out, and she saw Hiram leap into a boat and push the light bark from the shore.  She dared neither signal nor call to him; but when the faithful soul had reached open water he looked back at her window, recognized her in her white morning dress and flourished the oar high in the air.  This could only mean that he had fulfilled his commission and sold her jewel.  Now he was going to the other side to engage the Nabathaean.  When she had closed the shutters and darkened the room she again lay down.  Youth asserted its rights the weary girl fell into deep, dreamless slumbers.  When she woke, with the heat drops on her forehead, the sun was nearly at the meridian, only an hour till the Ariston would be served, the Greek breakfast, the first meal in the morning, which the family eat together as they also did the principal meal later in the clay.  She had never yet failed to appear, and her absence would excite remark.  The governor's household, like that of every Egyptian of rank, was conducted more on the Greek than the Egyptian plan; and this was the case not merely as regarded the meals but in many other things, and especially the language spoken.  From the Mukaukas himself down to the youngest member of the family, all spoke Greek among themselves, and Coptic, the old native dialect, only to the servants.  Nay, many borrowed and foreign words had already crept into use in the Coptic.  The governor's granddaughter, pretty little Mary, had learnt to speak Greek fluently and correctly before she spoke Coptic, but when Paula had first arrived she could not as yet write the beautiful language of Greece with due accuracy.  Paula loved children; she longed for some occupation, and she had therefore volunteered to instruct the little girl in the art. At first her hosts had seemed pleased that she should render this service, but ere long the relation between the Lady Neforis and her husband's niece had taken the unpleasant aspect which it was destined to retain.  She had put a stop to the lessons, and the reason she had assigned for this insulting step was that Paula had dictated to her pupil long sentences out of her Orthodox Greek prayerbook.  This, it was true, she had done; but without the smallest concealment; and the passages she had chosen had contained nothing but what must elevate the soul of every Christian, of whatever confession.  The child had wept bitterly over her grandmother's fiat, though Paula had always taken the lessons quite seriously, for Mary loved her older companion with all the enthusiasm of a half-grown girl--as a child of ten really is in Egypt; her passionate little heart worshipped the beautiful maiden who was in every respect so far above her, and Paula's arms had opened wide to embrace the child who brought sunshine into the gloomy, chill atmosphere she breathed in her uncle's house.  But Neforis regarded the child's ardent love for her Melchite relation as exaggerated and morbid, imperilling perhaps her religious faith; and she fancied that under Paula's influence Mary had transferred her affections from her to the younger woman with added warmth.  Nor was this idea wholly fanciful; the child's strong sense of justice could not bear to see her friend misunderstood and slighted, often simply and entirely misjudged and hardly blamed, so Mary felt it her duty, as far as in her lay, to make up for her grandmother's delinquencies in regard to the guest who in the child's eyes was perfection.  But Neforis was not the woman to put up with this demeanor in a child. Mary was her granddaughter, the only child of her lost son, and no one should come between them.  So she forbid the little girl to go to Paula's room without an express message, and when a Greek teacher was engaged for her, her instructions were that she should keep her pupil as much as possible out of the Syrian damsel's way.  All this only fanned the child's vehement affection; and tenderly as her grandmother would sometimes caress her--while Mary on her part never failed in dutiful obedience--neither of them ever felt a true and steady warmth of heart towards the other; and for this Paula was no doubt to blame, though against her will and by her mere existence.  Often, indeed, and by a hundred covert hints Dame Neforis gave Paula to understand that she it was who had alienated her grandchild; there was nothing for it but to keep the child for whom she yearned, at a distance, and only rarely reveal to her the abundance of her love.  At last her life was so full of grievance that she was hardly able to be innocent with the innocent--a child with the child; Mary was not slow to note this, and ascribed Paula's altered manner to the suffering caused by her grandmother's severity.  Mary's most frequent opportunities of speaking to her friend were just before meals; for at that time no one was watching her, and her grandmother had not forbidden her calling Paula to table.  A visit to her room was the child's greatest delight--partly because it was forbidden-- but no less because Paula, up in her own room, was quite different from what she seemed with the others, and because they could there look at each other and kiss without interference, and say what ever they pleased. There Mary could tell her as much as she dared of the events in their little circle, but the lively and sometimes hoydenish little girl was often withheld from confessing a misdemeanor, or even an inoffensive piece of childishness, by sheer admiration for one who to her appeared nobler, greater and loftier than other beings.  Just as Paula had finished putting up her hair, Mary, who would rush like a whirlwind even into her grandmother's presence, knocked humbly at the door.  She did not fly into Paula's arms as she did into those of Susannah or her daughter Katharina, but only kissed her white arm with fervent devotion, and colored with happiness when Paula bent down to her, pressed her lips to her brow and hair, and wiped her wet, glowing cheeks. Then she took Mary's head fondly between her hands and said:  \"What is wrong with you, madcap?\"  In fact the sweet little face was crimson, and her eyes swelled as if she had been crying violently.  \"It is so fearfully hot,\" said Mary.  \"Eudoxia\"--her Greek governess-- \"says that Egypt in summer is a fiery furnace, a hell upon earth.  She is quite ill with the heat, and lies like a fish on the sand; the only good thing about it is.  .  .\"  \"That she lets you run off and gives you no lessons?\"  Mary nodded, but as no lecture followed the confession she put her head on one side and looked up into Paula's face with large roguish eyes.  \"And yet you have been crying!--a great girl like you?\"  \"I--I crying?\"  \"Yes, crying.  I can see it in your eyes.  Now confess: what has happened?\"  \"You will not scold me?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  \"Well then.  At first it was fun, such fun you cannot think, and I do not mind the heat; but when the great hunt had gone by I wanted to go to my grand mother and I was not allowed.  Do you know, something very particular had been going on in the fountain-room; and as they all came out again I crept behind Orion into the tablinum--there are such wonderful things there, and I wanted just to frighten him a little; we have often played games together before.  At first he did not see me, and as he was bending over the hanging, from which the gem was stolen--I believe he was counting the stones in the faded old thing--I just jumped on to his shoulder, and he was so frightened--I can tell you, awfully frightened!  And he turned upon me like a fighting-cock and--and he gave me a box on the ear; such a slap, it is burning now--and all sorts of colors danced before my eyes.  He always used to be so nice and kind to me, and to you, too, and so I used to be fond of him--he is my uncle too --but a box on the ears, a slap such as the cook might give to the turnspit--I am too big for that; that I will certainly not put up with it!  Since my last birthday all the slaves and upper servants, too, have had to treat me as a lady and to bow down to me!  And now!--it was just here.--How dare he?\"  She began to cry again and sobbed out: \"But that was not all.  He locked me into the dark tablinum and left--left me....\" her tears flowed faster and faster, \"left me sitting there!  It was so horrible; and I might have been there now if I had not found a gold plate; I seized my great-grandfather--I mean the silver image of Menas, and hammered on it, and screamed Fire!  Then Sebek heard me and fetched Orion, and he let me out, and made such a fuss over me and kissed me. But what is the good of that; my grandfather will be angry, for in my terror I beat his father's nose quite flat on the plate.\"  Paula had listened, now amused and now grave, to the little girl's story; when she ceased, she once more wiped her eyes and said:  \"Your uncle is a man, and you must not play with him as if he were a child like yourself.  The reminder you got was rather a hard one, no doubt, but Orion tried to make up for it.--But the great hunt, what was that?\"  At this question Mary's eyes suddenly sparkled again.  In an instant all her woes were forgotten, even her ancestor's flattened nose, and with a merry, hearty laugh she exclaimed:  \"Oh! you should have seen it!  You would have been amused too.  They wanted to catch the bad man who cut the emerald out of the hanging.  He had left his shoes and they"]]]
