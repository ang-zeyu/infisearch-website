The modes specified are, however,   those most commonly resorted to, and enable provident servants to   make from five to thirty dollars apiece. The corn is of a different   sort from that which I cultivate, and is all bought by me. A great   many fowls are raised; I have this year known ten dollars worth sold   by one man at one time. One of the chief sources of profit is the   fur of the muskrat; for the purpose of catching which the marshes on   the estate have been parcelled out and appropriated from time   immemorial, and are held by a tenure little short of fee-simple. The   negroes are indebted to Nat Turner[1] and Tappan for a curtailment   of some of their privileges. As a sincere friend to the blacks, I   have much regretted the reckless interference of these persons, on   account of the restrictions it has become, or been thought,   necessary to impose. Since the exploit of the former hero, they have   been forbidden to preach, except to their fellow-slaves, the   property of the same owner; to have public funerals, unless a white   person officiates; or to be taught to read and write. Their funerals   formerly gave them great satisfaction, and it was customary here to   furnish the relations of the deceased with bacon, spirit, flour,   sugar and butter, with which a grand entertainment, in their way,   was got up. We were once much amused by a hearty fellow requesting   his mistress to let him have his funeral during his lifetime, when   it would do him some good. The waggish request was granted; and I   venture to say there never was a funeral the subject of which   enjoyed it so much. When permitted, some of our negroes preached   with great fluency. I was present, a few years since, when an   Episcopal minister addressed the people, by appointment. On the   conclusion of an excellent sermon, a negro preacher rose and thanked   the gentleman kindly for his discourse, but frankly told him the   congregation “did not understand his _lingo_.” He then proceeded   himself, with great vehemence and volubility, coining words where   they had not been made to his hand, or rather his tongue, and   impressing his hearers, doubtless, with a decided opinion of his   superiority over his white co-laborer in the field of grace. My   brother and I, who own contiguous estates, have lately erected a   chapel on the line between them, and have employed an acceptable   minister of the Baptist persuasion, to which the negroes almost   exclusively belong, to afford them religious instruction. Except as   a preparatory step to emancipation, I consider it exceedingly   impolitic, even as regards the slaves themselves, to permit them to   read and write: “Where ignorance is bliss, ‘tis folly to be wise.”   And it is certainly impolitic as regards their masters, on the   principle that “knowledge is power.” My servants have not as long   holidays as those of most other persons. I allow three days at   Christmas, and a day at each of three other periods, besides a   little time to work their patches; or, if very busy, I sometimes   prefer to work them myself. Most of the ancient pastimes have been   lost in this neighborhood, and religion, mock or real, has succeeded   them. The banjo, their national instrument, is known but in name, or   in a few of the tunes which have survived. Some of the younger   negroes sing and dance, but the evenings and holidays are usually   occupied in working, in visiting, and in praying and singing hymns.   The primitive customs and sports are, I believe, better preserved   further south, where slaves were brought from Africa long after they   ceased to come here.    6th. “The provision usually made for their food and clothing,—for   those who are too young or too old to labor.”—My men receive twelve   quarts of Indian meal (the abundant and universal allowance in this   state), seven salted herrings, and two pounds of smoked bacon or   three pounds of pork, a week; the other hands proportionally less.   But, generally speaking, their food is issued daily, with the   exception of meal, and consists of fish or bacon for breakfast, and   meat, fresh or salted, with vegetables whenever we can provide them,   for dinner; or, for a month or two in the spring, fresh fish cooked   with a little bacon. This mode is rather more expensive to me than   that of weekly rations, but more comfortable to the servants.   Superannuated or invalid slaves draw their provisions regularly once   a week; and the moment a child ceases to be nourished by its mother,   it receives eight quarts of meal (more than it can consume), and one   half-pound of lard. Besides the food furnished by me, nearly all the   servants are able to make some addition from their private stores;   and there is among the adults hardly an instance of one so   improvident as not to do it. He must be an unthrifty fellow, indeed,   who cannot realize the wish of the famous Henry IV. in regard to the   French peasantry, and enjoy his fowl on Sunday. I always keep on   hand, for the use of the negroes, sugar, molasses, &c., which,   though not regularly issued, are applied for on the slightest   pretexts, and frequently no pretext at all, and are never refused,   except in cases of misconduct. In regard to clothing:—the men and   boys receive a winter coat and trousers of strong cloth, three   shirts, a stout pair of shoes and socks, and a pair of summer   pantaloons, every year; a hat about every second year, and a   great-coat and blanket every third year. Instead of great-coats and   hats, the women have large capes to protect the bust in bad weather,   and handkerchiefs for the head. The articles furnished are good and   serviceable; and, with their own acquisitions, make their appearance   decent and respectable. On Sunday they are even fine. The aged and   invalid are clad as regularly as the rest, but less substantially.   Mothers receive a little raw cotton, in proportion to the number of   children, with the privilege of having the yarn, when spun, woven at   my expense. I provide them with blankets. Orphans are put with   careful women, and treated with tenderness. I am attached to the   little slaves, and encourage familiarity among them. Sometimes, when   I ride near the quarters, they come running after me with the most   whimsical requests, and are rendered happy by the distribution of   some little donation. The clothing described is that which is given   to the crop hands. Home-servants, a numerous class in Virginia, are   of course clad in a different and very superior manner. I neglected   to mention, in the proper place, that there are on each of my   plantations a kitchen, an oven, and one or more cooks; and that each   hand is furnished with a tin bucket for his food, which is carried   into the field by little negroes, who also supply the laborers with   water.    7th. “Their treatment when sick.”—My negroes go, or are carried, as   soon as they are attacked, to a spacious and well-ventilated   hospital, near the mansion-house. They are there received by an   attentive nurse, who has an assortment of medicine, additional   bed-clothing, and the command of as much light food as she may   require, either from the table or the store-room of the proprietor.   Wine, sago, rice, and other little comforts appertaining to such an   establishment, are always kept on hand. The condition of the sick is   much better than that of the poor whites or free colored people in   the neighborhood.    8th. “Their rewards and punishments.”—I occasionally bestow little   gratuities for good conduct, and particularly after harvest; and   hardly ever refuse a favor asked by those who faithfully perform   their duty. Vicious and idle servants are punished with stripes,   moderately inflicted; to which, in the case of theft, is added   privation of meat, a severe punishment to those who are never   suffered to be without it on any other account. From my limited   observation, I think that servants to the North work much harder   than our slaves. I was educated at a college in one of the free   states, and, on my return to Virginia, was struck with the contrast.   I was astonished at the number of idle domestics, and actually   worried my mother, much to my contrition since, to reduce the   establishment. I say to my contrition, because, after eighteen   years’ residence in the good Old Dominion, I find myself surrounded   by a troop of servants about as numerous as that against which I   formerly so loudly exclaimed. While on this subject it may not be   amiss to state a case of manumission which occurred about three   years since. My nearest neighbor, a man of immense wealth, owned a   favorite servant, a fine fellow, with polished manners and excellent   disposition, who reads and writes, and is thoroughly versed in the   duties of a butler and housekeeper, in the performance of which he   was trusted without limit. This man was, on the death of his master,   emancipated with a legacy of six thousand dollars, besides about two   thousand dollars more which he had been permitted to accumulate, and   had deposited with his master, who had given him credit for it. The   use that this man, apparently so well qualified for freedom, and who   has had an opportunity of travelling and of judging for himself,   makes of his money and his time, is somewhat remarkable. In   consequence of his exemplary conduct, he has been permitted to   reside in the state, and for very moderate wages occupies the same   situation he did in the old establishment, and will probably   continue to occupy it as long as he lives. He has no children of his   own, but has put a little girl, a relation of his, to school. Except   in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54812"],["title","A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (#4)"],["body","instance, and in the purchase of a few plain articles of   furniture, his freedom and his money seem not much to have benefited   him. A servant of mine, who is intimate with him, thinks he is not   as happy as he was before his liberation. Several other servants   were freed at the same time, with smaller legacies, but I do not   know what has become of them.    I do not regard negro-slavery, however mitigated, as a Utopian   system, and have not intended so to delineate it. But it exists, and   the difficulty of removing it is felt and acknowledged by all, save   the fanatics, who, like “fools, rush in where angels dare not   tread.” It is pleasing to know that its burdens are not too heavy to   be borne. That the treatment of slaves in this state is humane, and   even indulgent, may be inferred from the fact of their rapid   increase and great longevity. I believe that, constituted as they   are, morally and physically, they are as happy as any peasantry in   the world; and I venture to affirm, as the result of my reading and   inquiry, that in no country are the laborers so liberally and   invariably supplied with bread and meat as are the negro slaves of   the United States. However great the dearth of provisions, famine   never reaches them.    P. S.—It might have been stated above that on this estate there are   about one hundred and sixty blacks. With the exception of infants,   there has been, in eighteen months, but one death that I   remember,—that of a man fully sixty-five years of age. The bill for   medical attendance, from the second day of last November, comprising   upwards of a year, is less than forty dollars.  The following accounts are taken from “Ingraham’s Travels in the South-west,” a work which seems to have been written as much to show the beauties of slavery as anything else. Speaking of the state of things on some Southern plantations, he gives the following pictures, which are presented without note or comment:    The little candidates for “field honors” are useless articles on a   plantation during the first five or six years of their existence.   They are then to take their first lesson in the elementary part of   their education. When they have learned their manual alphabet   tolerably well, they are placed in the field to take a spell at   cotton-picking. The first day in the field is their proudest day.   The young negroes look forward to it with as much restlessness and   impatience as school-boys to a vacation. Black children are not put   to work so young as many children of poor parents in the North. It   is often the case that the children of the domestic servants become   pets in the house, and the playmates of the white children of the   family. No scene can be livelier or more interesting to a   Northerner, than that which the negro quarters of a well-regulated   plantation present on a Sabbath morning, just before church-hours.   In every cabin the men are shaving and dressing; the women, arrayed   in their gay muslins, are arranging their frizzly hair,—in which   they take no little pride,—or investigating the condition of their   children; the old people, neatly clothed, are quietly conversing or   smoking about the doors; and those of the younger portion who are   not undergoing the infliction of the wash-tub are enjoying   themselves in the shade of the trees, or around some little pond,   with as much zest as though slavery and freedom were synonymous   terms. When all are dressed, and the hour arrives for worship, they   lock up their cabins, and the whole population of the little village   proceeds to the chapel, where divine service is performed, sometimes   by an officiating clergyman, and often by the planter himself, if a   church-member. The whole plantation is also frequently formed into a   Sabbath class, which is instructed by the planter, or some member of   his family; and often, such is the anxiety of the master that they   should perfectly understand what they are taught,—a hard matter in   the present state of their intellect,—that no means calculated to   advance their progress are left untried. I was not long since shown   a manuscript catechism, drawn up with great care and judgment by a   distinguished planter, on a plan admirably adapted to the   comprehension of the negroes.    It is now popular to treat slaves with kindness; and those planters   who are known to be inhumanly rigorous to their slaves are scarcely   countenanced by the more intelligent and humane portion of the   community. Such instances, however, are very rare; but there are   unprincipled men everywhere, who will give vent to their ill   feelings and bad passions, not with less good will upon the back of   an indented apprentice, than upon that of a purchased slave. Private   chapels are now introduced upon most of the plantations of the more   wealthy, which are far from any church; Sabbath-schools are   instituted for the black children, and Bible-classes for the   parents, which are superintended by the planter, a chaplain, or some   of the female members of the family.    Nor are planters indifferent to the comfort of their gray-headed   slaves. I have been much affected at beholding many exhibitions of   their kindly feeling towards them. They always address them in a   mild and pleasant manner, as “Uncle,” or “Aunty,”—titles as peculiar   to the old negro and negress as “boy” and “girl” to all under forty   years of age. Some old Africans are allowed to spend their last   years in their houses, without doing any kind of labor; these, if   not too infirm, cultivate little patches of ground, on which they   raise a few vegetables,—for vegetables grow nearly all the year   round in this climate,—and make a little money to purchase a few   extra comforts. They are also always receiving presents from their   masters and mistresses, and the negroes on the estate, the latter of   whom are extremely desirous of seeing the old people comfortable. A   relation of the extra comforts which some planters allow their   slaves would hardly obtain credit at the North. But you must   recollect that Southern planters are men, and men of feeling,   generous and high-minded, and possessing as much of the “milk of   human kindness” as the sons of colder climes—although they may have   been educated to regard that as right which a different education   has led Northerners to consider wrong.  With regard to the character of Mrs. Shelby the writer must say a few words. While travelling in Kentucky, a few years since, some pious ladies expressed to her the same sentiments with regard to slavery which the reader has heard expressed by Mrs. Shelby.  There are many whose natural sense of justice cannot be made to tolerate the enormities of the system, even though they hear it defended by clergymen from the pulpit, and see it countenanced by all that is most honorable in rank and wealth.  A pious lady said to the author, with regard to instructing her slaves, “I am ashamed to teach them what is right; I know that they know as well as I do that it is wrong to hold them as slaves, and I am ashamed to look them in the face.” Pointing to an intelligent mulatto woman who passed through the room, she continued, “Now, there’s B——. She is as intelligent and capable as any white woman I ever knew, and as well able to have her liberty and take care of herself; and she knows it isn’t right to keep her as we do, and I know it too; and yet I cannot get my husband to think as I do, or I should be glad to set them free.”  A venerable friend of the writer, a lady born and educated a slave-holder, used to the writer the very words attributed to Mrs. Shelby:—“I never thought it was right to hold slaves. I always thought it was wrong when I was a girl, and I thought so still more when I came to join the church.” An incident related by this friend of her examination for the church shows in a striking manner what a difference may often exist between theoretical and practical benevolence.  A certain class of theologians in America have advocated the doctrine of disinterested benevolence with such zeal as to make it an imperative article of belief that every individual ought to be willing to endure everlasting misery, if by doing so they could, on the whole, produce a greater amount of general good in the universe; and the inquiry was sometimes made of candidates for church-membership whether they could bring themselves to this point, as a test of their sincerity. The clergyman who was to examine this lady was particularly interested in these speculations. When he came to inquire of her with regard to her views as to the obligations of Christianity, she informed him decidedly that she had brought her mind to the point of emancipating all her slaves, of whom she had a large number. The clergyman seemed rather to consider this as an excess of zeal, and recommended that she should take time to reflect upon it. He was, however, very urgent to know whether, if it should appear for the greatest good of the universe, she would be willing to be damned. Entirely unaccustomed to theological speculations, the good woman answered, with some vehemence, that “she was sure she was not;” adding, naturally enough, that if that had been her purpose she need not have come to join the church. The good lady, however, was admitted, and proved her devotion to the general good by the more tangible method of setting all her slaves at liberty, and carefully watching over their education and interests after they were liberated.  Mrs. Shelby is a fair type of the very best class of Southern women; and while the evils of the institution are felt and deplored, and while the world looks with just indignation on the national support and patronage which is given to it, and on the men who, knowing its nature, deliberately make efforts to perpetuate and extend it, it is but justice that it should bear in mind the virtues of such persons.
