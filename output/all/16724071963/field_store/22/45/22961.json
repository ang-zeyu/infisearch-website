Thus the terrible days and nights of anguish passed by; and the captives whom the girl's sins had brought to prison were happier than she, in spite of the doom that threatened them.  The fate of his betrothed tortured Orion more than a hundred aching wounds.  Paula's terrible end was fast approaching, and his brain burned at the mere thought.  Now, as he was told by the warder, by the bishop, and by Justinus, the day after to-morrow was fixed for the bridal of his betrothed.  In two days the bride, decked by base and mocking hands for an atrocious and accursed farce, would be wreathed and wedded, not to him, the bridegroom whom she loved, but to the Nile--the insensible, death-dealing element.  He rushed up and down his cell like a madman, and tore his lute-strings when he tried to soothe his soul with music; but then a calm, well-intentioned voice would come from the adjoining room, exhorting him not to lose hope, to trust in God, not to forget his duty and the task before him.  And Orion would control himself resolutely, pull himself together, and throw himself into his work again.  Day and night were alike to him.  The senator had provided him with a lamp and oil.  When he was wearied out, he allowed himself no longer sleep on his hard couch than human nature imperatively demanded; and as soon as he had shaken it off he again became absorbed in maps and lists, plied his pen, thought, sketched, calculated, and reflected.  Then, if a doubt arose in his mind or he could not trust his own memory and judgment, he knocked at the wall, and his shrewd and experienced friend was at all times ready to help him to the best of his knowledge and opinion.  The senator went to Arsinoe for him, to gain information as to the seaboard from the archives preserved there; and so the work went forward, approaching its end, strengthening and raising his sinking spirit, bringing him the pleasures of success, and enabling him not unfrequently to forget for hours that which otherwise might have brought the bravest to despair.  The warder, the senator or his worthy wife, Dame Joanna or Eudoxia--who twice had the pleasure of accompanying her--each time they visited him had some message or note to carry to Paula, telling her how far his work had progressed; and to her it was a consolation and heartfelt joy to be able to follow him in his labors.  And many a token of his love, esteem, and admiration gave her courage, when even her brave heart began to quail.  Ah!  It was not alone her terror of a horrible death that tortured her soul.  Her father, whom she considered it her greatest joy in life to have found again, was fading beyond all hope under her loving hands. His poor wounded lungs refused its service.  It was with great difficulty that he could swallow a few drops of wine and mouthfuls of food; and in these last days his clear mind had lain as it were under a shroud-- perhaps it was happier so, as she told herself and as her friends said to comfort her.  He, too, had heard the cries of: \"Hail to the Bride of the Nile!\"  \"Bring out the Bride!\"  \"Away with the Bride of the Nile!\"  Though he had no suspicion of their meaning, they had haunted his thoughts incessantly during the last few days; and the terrible, strange words had seemed to charm his fancy, for to Paula's distress he would murmur them to himself tenderly or thoughtfully as the case might be.  Many times the idea occurred to her that she might put an end to her life before the worst should befall, before she became a spectacle for a whole nation, to be jeered at and made a delightful and exciting show to rouse their cruelty or their compassion.  But dared she do it?  Dared she defy the Most High, the Lord in whom she put her trust, into whose hand she commended herself in a thousand dumb but fervent prayers.  No.  To the very last she would trust and hope.  And wonderful to say! Each time she had reached the very limits of her powers of endurance, feeling she could certainly bear no more and must succumb, something came to her to revive her faith or her courage: a message would be brought her from Orion, or Dame Joanna or Pulcheria came to see her; the bishop sought an interview, or her father's mind rallied and he could speak to her in beautiful and stimulating words.  Often the warder would announce the senator and his wife, and their vigorous and healthy minds always hit on the very thing she needed.  Martina, particularly, with her subtle motherly instinct, always understood whatever was agitating her; and once she showed her a letter from Heliodora, in which she spoke of the calmness she had won through nursing their dear invalid, and said how thankful she was to see the reward of her care and toil.  Narses was already quite another man, and she could know no higher task than that of reconciling the hapless man to life, nay, of making it dear to him again. She no longer thought of Orion but as she might of a beautiful song she once had heard in a delightful hour.  Thus time passed, even for the imprisoned maiden, till only two nights remained before St. Serapis' day when the fearful marriage was to be solemnized.  It was evening when the bishop came to visit Paula.  He regarded it as his duty to tell her that the execution of her sentence was fixed for the day after to-morrow.  He should hope and believe till the last, but his own power over the misguided mob was gone from him.  In any case, and if the worst should befall, he would be at her side to protect her by the dignity of his office.  He had come now, so as to give her time to prepare her self in every respect.  The care of her noble father till his last hour on earth he would take upon himself as a dear and sacred duty.  Though she had believed herself surely prepared long since for the worst, this news fell on her like a thunderbolt.  What lay before her seemed so monstrous, so unexampled, that it was impossible that she ever could look forward to it firmly and calmly.  For a long time she could not help clinging desperately to her faithful Betta, and it was only by degrees that she so far recovered herself as to be able to speak to the bishop, and thank him.  He, however, could only lament his inability to earn her fullest gratitude, for the patriarch's reply to his complaint of those who promised rescue to the people by the instrumentality of a heathen abomination--a document on which he had founded his highest hopes for her--had had a different result from that which he had expected.  The patriarch, to be sure, condemned the abominable sacrifice, but he did it in a way which lacked the force necessary to terrify and discourage the misled mob.  However, he would try what effect it might have on the people, and a number of scribes were at work to make copies of it in the course of the night.  These would be sent to the Senators next morning, posted up in the market-place and public buildings, and distributed to the people; but he feared all this would have no effect.  \"Then help me to prepare for death,\" said Paula gloomily.  \"You are not a priest of my confession, but no church has a more worthy minister. If you can absolve me in the name of your Redeemer, mine will pardon me. We look at Him, it is true, with different eyes, but He is the Saviour of us both, nevertheless.\"  A contradictory reply struggled for utterance in the strict Jacobite's mind, but at such a moment he felt he must repress it; he only answered:  \"Speak, daughter, I am listening.\"  And she poured forth all her soul, as though he had been a priest of her own creed, and his eyes grew moist as he heard this confession of a pure and loving heart, yearning for all that was highest and best.  He promised her the mercy of the Redeemer, and when he had ended with \"Amen,\" and blessed her, he looked down at the ground for some minutes and presently said, \"Follow me, Child.\"  \"Whither?\"  she asked in surprise; for she thought that her last hour had already come, and that he was about to lead her away to the place of execution, or to her watery, ever-flowing tomb; but he smiled as he replied: \"No, child.  To-day I have only the pleasing duty of blessing your betrothal before God; if only you will promise not to estrange your husband from the faith of his fathers--for what will not a man sacrifice to win the love of a woman.--You promise?  Then I will take you to your Orion.\"  He rapped on the door of the cell, and when the warder had opened it he whispered his orders; Paula followed him silently and with blushing cheeks, and in a few minutes she was clasped to her lover's breast while, for the first time--and perhaps the last--their lips met in a kiss.  The prelate gave them a few minutes together; when he had blessed them both and solemnized their betrothal, he led her back to her cell. However, she had hardly time to thank him out of the fulness of her overflowing heart, when a town-watchman came to fetch him to see Susannah; her last hour was at hand, if not already past.  John at once went with the messenger, and Paula drew a deep breath as she saw him depart.  Then she threw herself on to her nurse's shoulders, crying:  \"Now, come what may!  Nothing can divide us; not even death!\"     CHAPTER XXIV.  The bishop was too late.  He found the widow Susannah a corpse; standing at the head of the bed was little Katharina, as pale as death, speechless, tearless, utterly annihilated.  He kindly tried to cheer her, and to speak words of comfort; but she pushed him away, tore herself from him, and before he could stop her, she had fled out of the room.  Poor child!  He had seen many a loving daughter mourning for her mother, but never such grief as this.  Here, thought he, were two human souls all in all to each other, and hence this overwhelming sorrow.  Katharina had escaped to her own room, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5528"],["title","The Bride of the Nile â€” Volume 12 (#6)"],["body","thrown herself on the couch --cowering so close that no one entering the room would have taken the undistinguishable heap for a human being, a grown up, passionately suffering girl.  It was very hot, and yet a cold shiver ran through her slender frame. Was she now attacked by the pestilence?  No; it would be too merciful of Fate to take such pity on her woes.  The mother was dead, dragged to the grave by her own daughter.  The disease had first shown itself on her lips; and how many times had the physician expressed his surprise at the plague having broken out in this healthy quarter of the town, and in a house kept so scrupulously clean. She knew at whose bidding the avenging angel had entered there, and whose criminal guile had trifled with him.  The words \"murdered your mother\" haunted her, and she remembered the law of the ancients which refused to prescribe a punishment for the killing of parents, because they considered such a monstrous deed impossible.  A scornful smile curled her lip.  Laws!  Principles!  Was there one that she had not defied?  She had contemned God, meddled with magic, borne false witness, committed murder--and as to the one law with promise, which, if Philippus was right, was exactly the same in the code of her forefathers as on the tables of Moses, how had she kept that?  Her own mother was no more, and by her act!  All through this frightful retrospect she had never ceased to shiver and, as this was becoming unendurable, she took to walking up and down and seeking excuses for her sinful doings: It was not her mother, but Heliodora whom she had wished to kill; why had malicious Fate....?  Here she was interrupted, for the young widow, who had heard the sad news, sought her out to comfort her and offer her services.  She spoke to the girl with real affection;  but her sweet, low tones reminded Katharina of that evening after the old bishop's death; and when Heliodora put out her arm to draw her to her, she shrank from her, begging her in a dry, hoarse voice, not to touch her for her clothes were infected.  She wanted no comfort; all she asked was to be left alone-- quite alone--nothing more.  The words were hard and unkind, and as the door closed on the young woman Katharina's eyes glared after her.  Why had this doom passed over Heliodora's head and demanded the sacrifice of one whose loss she could never cease to mourn?  This brought her mother vividly to her mind.  She flew back to her death- bed and fell on her knees--but even there she could not bear to stay long, so she wandered into the garden and visited every spot where she and her mother had been together.  But there were such strange crackings in the shrubs, and the trees and bushes cast such uncanny shadows that she hailed daybreak as a deliverance.  She was on her way back to the house when her foster-brother Anubis came limping to meet her.  Poor fellow!  She had made a cripple of him, too, and his mother had died through her fault.  The lad spoke to her, giving expression to his sympathy, and she accepted it; but she said such strange things, and answered him so utterly at random, that he began to fear that grief had turned her brain.  She went on to ask him point-blank how much money she now had, and as he happened to know approximately, he could tell her; she clasped her hands, for how could any one human being who was not a king possess such enormous wealth!  Finally she enquired whether he knew how a will should be drawn up, and that, too, he answered affirmatively.  She made him describe it all, and then he added that the signature must be made valid by those of two witnesses; but she, he added, was too young to be thinking of making her will.  \"Why?\"  said she.  \"Is Paula much older than I am?\"  \"And the day after to-morrow,\" the boy went on, \"she is to be cast into the Nile.  All the people call her the Bride of the Nile.\"  At this that hideous, malignant smile again curled her lips, but she hastily suppressed it and walked straight on into the house.  At the door he timidly asked her whether he might once more look on his mistress; but she was obliged to forbid it for fear of infection.  However, he proudly replied: \"What you do not fear, has no terrors for me,\" and he followed her to the side of the bed where the corpse now lay washed and in fine array; and when he saw Katharina kiss the dead woman's hand he, too, as soon as she looked away, pressed his lips on the place hers had touched. Then he sat down by the bed and remained there till she sent him away.  Before noon the bishop arrived to perform the last rites.  He found the body surrounded by beautiful flowers.  Katharina had been out in the garden again and had cut all the rarest and finest; and though she had allowed the gardener to carry the basket for her, she would not have him help her in gathering them.  The feeling that she was doing something for her mother had been a comfort to her; still, by day everything about her seemed even more intolerable than by night.  Everything looked so large, so coarse, so insistent, so menacing, and reminded her at every step of some injustice or some deed of which she was ashamed.  Every eye, she fancied, must see through her; and now and then it seemed as though the pillars of the great banqueting-hall, where her mother still lay, were tottering, and the ceiling about to fall in and crush her.  She answered the bishop's questions absently and often quite at random, and the old man supposed that she was stunned by her great sorrow; so to give her thoughts a new direction he began telling her about Paula, and believing that Katharina was fond of her, he confided to her that he had taken Paula, the day before, to Orion's cell, and consecrated their betrothal.  At this her face was convulsed in a manner that alarmed the bishop; a fearful tumult raged in her soul, her bosom rose and fell spasmodically, and all she could utter was the question: \"But they will sacrifice her all the same?\"  The bishop thought he understood.  She was horror stricken by the idea of the sudden, cruel end that hung over the young bride, and he replied sadly; \"I shall not be able to restrain the wretches; still, no means shall remain untried.  The patriarch's rescript, condemning this mad crime, shall be made public to-day, and I will read and expound it at the Curia, and try to give it keener emphasis.--Would you like to read it?\"  As she eagerly assented, the prelate signed to the acolyte who had waited on him with the holy vessels, and he produced from a packet a written sheet which he handed to Katharina.  As soon as she was alone she read the patriarch's epistle; at first superficially, then more carefully, and at last in deep attention and growing interest, stirred by it to strange thoughts, till at length her eyes flashed and her breath came fast, as though this paper referred to herself, and could seal her fate for life.  When the bearers came in to fetch away the body she was still sitting there, gazing as if spell-bound at the papyrus; but she sprang up, shook herself, and then bid farewell to the cold rigid form of the mother on whose warm heart she had so often rested, and to whom she had been the dearest thing on earth--and even then the solace of tears was denied her.  She no longer suffered the deep remorse that had tormented her; for she felt now that her intercourse with her last mother had not been put an end to by death; that after a short parting they would meet again--soon perhaps, perhaps even to-morrow--meet for a fulness of speech, an outpouring of the heart, a revelation of all the past more open and unreserved than could ever be between mortal beings, even between mother and daughter.  And when she who was sleeping there, blind, deaf, and senseless, should awake again, up there, with eyes clearer than those of men below, and the ears and senses of a spiritual being to see and hear and judge all she had known and done, all she had felt and made others feel--then, she told herself, her mother might perhaps blame her and punish her more than she had ever done on earth, but she would also clasp her more closely to her heart and comfort her more earnestly.  She whispered gently in her ear as if she were still alive: \"Wait awhile, only wait: I shall come soon and tell you everything!\"  And then she kissed her so passionately and recklessly that the nuns were shocked and dragged her away, ordering the bearers to close the coffin. They obeyed, and when the wooden lid fell over the sleeping form, shutting it in with a slam, and hiding it from the girl's sight, the barrier gave way which had hitherto restrained her tears and she began to weep bitterly; now, too, the feeling that she had indeed lost her mother took complete possession of her--the sense of being an orphan and alone, quite alone in the wide world.  She saw and heard no more of what took place round the beloved dead; for when she took her hands from her face streaming with tears, the house of the rich widow no longer sheltered its mistress; her remains had been borne away to the nearest mortuary.  The law forbade its being any longer kept within doors, but did not allow of its being buried till night fell. The child might not follow her own mother to the cemetery.  With a drooping head Katharina withdrew to her room and there stood looking out into the garden.  It all was hers now; she was mistress of it all and of much besides, as free and unfettered to command as hitherto she had been over the birds, her little dog, or the jewels that lay on her toilet-table.  She could make hundreds happy with a word, a wave of the hand--but not herself.  She had never felt so grown-up, independent, womanly, nay powerful, and at the same time so unutterably wretched and helpless as she felt in this hour.  What did she care for all these vanities?  They could not suffice to check one sigh of disappointed yearning.  She had parted from her mother with a promise; the"]]]
