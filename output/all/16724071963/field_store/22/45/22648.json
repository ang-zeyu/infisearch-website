Thus a widow's sorrow may bring blessing to millions of human beings.\"  The woman had listened to her attentively, and when Nefert ceased speaking she said:  \"But I have still three little brats of my son's to feed, for his wife, who was a washerwoman, was eaten by a crocodile while she was at work. Poor folks must work for themselves, and not for others.  If the princess did not pay us, I could not think of the wounds of the soldiers, who do not belong to me.  I am no longer strong, and four mouths to fill--\"  Nefert was shocked--as she often was in the course of her new duties--and begged Bent-Gnat to raise the wages of the woman.  \"Willingly,\" said the princess.  \"How could I beat down such an assistant.  Come now with me into the kitchen.  I am having some fruit packed for my father and brothers; there must be a box for Mena too.\" Nefert followed her royal friend, found them packing in one case the golden dates of the oasis of Amon, and in another the dark dates of Nubia, the king's favorite sort.  \"Let me pack them!\"  cried Nefert; she made the servants empty the box again, and re-arranged the various- colored dates in graceful patterns, with other fruits preserved in sugar.  Bent-Anat looked on, and when she had finished she took her hand. \"Whatever your fingers have touched,\" she exclaimed, \"takes some pretty aspect.  Give me that scrap of papyrus; I shall put it in the case, and write upon it:  \"'These were packed for king Rameses by his daughter's clever helpmate, the wife of Mena.'\"  After the mid-day rest the princess was called away, and Nefert remained for some hours alone with the work-women.  When the sun went down, and the busy crowd were about to leave, Nefert detained them, and said: \"The Sun-bark is sinking behind the western hills; come, let us pray together for the king and for those we love in the field.  Each of you think of her own: you children of your fathers, you women of your sons, and we wives of our distant husbands, and let us entreat Amon that they may return to us as certainly as the sun, which now leaves us, will rise again to-morrow morning.\"  Nefert knelt down, and with her the women and the children.  When they rose, a little girl went up to Nefert, and said, pulling her dress: \"Thou madest us kneel here yesterday, and already my mother is better, because I prayed for her.\"  \"No doubt,\" said Nefert, stroking the child's black hair.  She found Bent-Anat on the terrace meditatively gazing across to the Necropolis, which was fading into darkness before her eyes.  She started when she heard the light footsteps of her friend.  \"I am  disturbing thee,\"  said  Nefert, about  to retire.  \"No, stay,\" said Bent-Anat.  \"I thank the Gods that I have you, for my heart is sad--pitifully sad.\"  \"I know where your thoughts were,\" said Nefert softly.  \"Well?\" asked the princess.  \"With Pentaur.\"  \"I think of him--always of him,\" replied the princess, \"and nothing else occupies my heart.  I am no longer myself.  What I think I ought not to think, what I feel I ought not to feel, and yet, I cannot command it, and I think my heart would bleed to death if I tried to cut out those thoughts and feelings.  I have behaved strangely, nay unbecomingly, and now that which is hard to endure is hanging over me, something strange- which will perhaps drive you from me back to your mother.\"  \"I will share everything with you,\" cried Nefert.  \"What is going to happen?  Are you then no longer the daughter of Rameses?\"  \"I showed myself to the people as a woman of the people,\" answered Bent- Anat, \"and I must take the consequences.  Bek en Chunsu, the high-priest of Amon, has been with me, and I have had a long conversation with him. The worthy man is good to me, I know, and my father ordered me to follow his advice before any one's.  He showed me that I have erred deeply.  In a state of uncleanness I went into one of the temples of the Necropolis, and after I had once been into the paraschites' house and incurred Ameni's displeasure, I did it a second time.  They know over there all that took place at the festival.  Now I must undergo purification, either with great solemnity at the hands of Ameni himself, before all the priests and nobles in the House of Seti, or by performing a pilgrimage to the Emerald-Hathor, under whose influence the precious stones are hewn from the rocks, metals dug out, and purified by fire.  The Goddess shall purge me from my uncleanness as metal is purged from the dross.  At a day's journey and more from the mines, an abundant stream flows from the holy mountain-Sinai,\" as it is called by the Mentut--and near it stands the sanctuary of the Goddess, in which priests grant purification.  The journey is a long one, through the desert, and over the sea; But Bek en Chunsu advises me to venture it.  Ameni, he says, is not amiably disposed towards me, because I infringed the ordinance which he values above all others.  I must submit to double severity, he says, because the people look first to those of the highest rank; and if I went unpunished for contempt of the sacred institutions there might be imitators among the crowd.  He speaks in the name of the Gods, and they measure hearts with an equal measure.  The ell-measure is the symbol of the Goddess of Truth. I feel that it is all not unjust; and yet I find it hard to submit to the priest's decree, for I am the daughter of Rameses!\"  \"Aye, indeed!\"  exclaimed Nefert, \"and he is himself a God!\"  \"But he taught me to respect the laws!\" interrupted the princess. \"I discussed another thing with Bek en Chunsu.  You know I rejected the suit of the Regent.  He must secretly be much vexed with me.  That indeed would not alarm me, but he is the guardian and protector appointed over me by my father, and yet can I turn to him in confidence for counsel, and help?  No! I am still a woman, and Rameses' daughter!  Sooner will I travel through a thousand deserts than humiliate my father through his child.  By to-morrow I shall have decided; but, indeed, I have already decided to make the journey, hard as it is to leave much that is here. Do not fear, dear!  but you are too tender for such a journey, and to such a distance; I might--\"  \"No, no,\" cried Nefert.  \"I am going, too, if you were going to the four pillars of heaven, at the limits of the earth.  You have given me a new life, and the little sprout that is green within me would wither again if I had to return to my mother.  Only she or I can be in our house, and I will re-enter it only with Mena.\"  \"It is settled--I must go,\" said the princess.  \"Oh! if only my father were not so far off, and that I could consult him!\"  \"Yes! the war, and always the war!\"  sighed Nefert.  \"Why do not men rest content with what they have, and prefer the quiet peace, which makes life lovely, to idle fame?\"  \"Would they be men? should we love them?\"  cried Bent-Anat eagerly. \"Is not the mind of the Gods, too, bent on war?  Did you ever see a more sublime sight than Pentaur, on that evening when he brandished the stake he had pulled up, and exposed his life to protect an innocent girl who was in danger?\"  \"I dared not once look down into the court,\" said Nefert.  \"I was in such an agony of mind.  But his loud cry still rings in my ears.\"  \"So rings the war cry of heroes before whom the enemy quails!\"  exclaimed Bent-Anat.  \"Aye, truly so rings the war cry!\"  said prince Rameri, who had entered his sister's half-dark room unperceived by the two women.  The princess turned to the boy.  \"How you frightened me!\"  she said.  \"You!\"  said Rameri astonished.  \"Yes, me.  I used to have a stout heart, but since that evening I frequently tremble, and an agony of terror comes over me, I do not know why.  I believe some demon commands me.\"  \"You command, wherever you go; and no one commands you,\" cried Rameri. \"The excitement and tumult in the valley, and on the quay, still agitate you.  I grind my teeth myself when I remember how they turned me out of the school, and how Paaker set the dog at us.  I have gone through a great deal today too.\"  \"Where were you so long?\"  asked Bent-Anat.  \"My uncle Ani commanded that you should not leave the palace.\"  \"I shall be eighteen years old next month,\" said the prince, \"and need no tutor.\"  \"But your father--\" said Bent-Anat.  \"My father\"--interrupted the boy, \"he little knows the Regent.  But I shall write to him what I have today heard said by different people. They were to have sworn allegiance to Ani at that very feast in the valley, and it is quite openly said that Ani is aiming at the throne, and intends to depose the king.  You are right, it is madness--but there must be something behind it all.\"  Nefert turned pale, and Bent-Anat asked for particulars.  The prince repeated all he had gathered, and added laughing: \"Ani depose my father! It is as if I tried to snatch the star of Isis from the sky to light the lamps--which are much wanted here.\"  \"It is more comfortable in the dark,\" said Nefert.  \"No, let us have lights,\" said Bent-Anat.  \"It is better to talk when we can see each other face to face.  I have no belief in the foolish talk of the people; but you are right--we must bring it to my fathers knowledge.\"  \"I heard the wildest gossip in the City of the Dead,\" said Rameri.  \"You ventured over there?  How very wrong!\"  \"I disguised myself a little, and I have good news for you.  Pretty Uarda is much better.  She received your present, and they have a house of their own again.  Close to the one that was burnt down, there was a tumbled-down hovel, which her father soon put together again; he is a bearded soldier, who is as much like her as a hedgehog is like a white dove.  I offered her to work in the palace for you with the other girls, for good wages, but she would not; for she has to wait on her sick grandmother, and she is proud, and will not serve any one.\"  \"It seems you were a long time with the paraschites' people,\" said Bent- Anat"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5445"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 07 (#8)"],["body","ovingly.  \"I should have thought that what has happened to me might have served you as a warning.\"  \"I will not be better than you!\"  cried the boy.  \"Besides, the paraschites is dead, and Uarda's father is a respectable soldier, who can defile no one.  I kept a long way from the old woman.  To-morrow I am going again.  I promised her.\"  \"Promised who?\"  asked his sister.  \"Who but Uarda?  She loves flowers, and since the rose which you gave her she has not seen one.  I have ordered the gardener to cut me a basket full of roses to-morrow morning, and shall take them to her myself.\"  \"That you will not!\"  cried Bent-Anat.  \"You are still but half a child-- and, for the girl's sake too, you must give it up.\"  \"We only gossip together,\" said the prince coloring, \"and no one shall recognize me.  But certainly, if you mean that, I will leave the basket of roses, and go to her alone.  No--sister, I will not be forbidden this; she is so charming, so white, so gentle, and her voice is so soft and sweet!  And she has little feet, as small as--what shall I say?--as small and graceful as Nefert's hand.  We talked most about Pentaur.  She knows his father, who is a gardener, and knows a great deal about him.  Only think! she says the poet cannot be the son of his parents, but a good spirit that has come down on earth--perhaps a God.  At first she was very timid, but when I spoke of Pentaur she grew eager; her reverence for him is almost idolatry--and that vexed me.\"  \"You would rather she should reverence you so,\" said Nefert smiling.  \"Not at all,\" cried Rameri.  \"But I helped to save her, and I am so happy when I am sitting with her, that to-morrow, I am resolved, I will put a flower in her hair.  It is red certainly, but as thick as yours, Bent- Anat, and it must be delightful to unfasten it and stroke it.\"  The ladies exchanged a glance of intelligence, and the princess said decidedly:  \"You will not go to the City of the Dead to-morrow, my little son!\"  \"That we will see, my little mother!\"  He answered laughing; then he turned grave.  \"I saw my school-friend Anana too,\" he said.  \"Injustice reigns in the House of Seti!  Pentaur is in prison, and yesterday evening they sat in judgment upon him.  My uncle was present, and would have pounced upon the poet, but Ameni took him under his protection.  What was finally decided, the pupils could not learn, but it must have been something bad, for the son of the Treasurer heard Ameni saying, after the sitting, to old Gagabu: 'Punishment he deserves, but I will not let him be overwhelmed;' and he can have meant no one but Pentaur.  To-morrow I will go over, and learn more; something frightful, I am afraid--several years of imprisonment is the least that will happen to him.\"  Bent-Anat had turned very pale.  \"And whatever they do to him,\" she cried, \"he will suffer for my sake! Oh, ye omnipotent Gods, help him--help me, be merciful to us both!\"  She covered her face with her hands, and left the room.  Rameri asked Nefert:  What can have come to my sister? she seems quite strange to me; and you too are not the same as you used to be.\"  \"We both have to find our way in new circumstances.\"  \"What are they?\"  \"That I cannot explain to you!--but it appears to me that you soon may experience something of the same kind.  Rumeri, do not go again to the paraschites.\"    CHAPTER XXXII.  Early on the following clay the dwarf Nemu went past the restored hut of Uarda's father--in which he had formerly lived with his wife--with a man in a long coarse robe, the steward of some noble family.  They went towards old Hekt's cave-dwelling.  \"I would beg thee to wait down here a moment, noble lord,\" said the dwarf, \"while I announce thee to my mother.\"  \"That sounds very grand,\" said the other.  \"However, so be it.  But stay! The old woman is not to call me by my name or by my title.  She is to call me 'steward'--that no one may know.  But, indeed, no one would recognize me in this dress.\"  Nemu hastened to the cave, but before he reached his mother she called out: \"Do not keep my lord waiting--I know him well.\"  Nemu laid his finger to his lips.  \"You are to call him steward,\" said he.  \"Good,\" muttered the old woman.  \"The ostrich puts his head under his feathers when he does not want to be seen.\"  \"Was the young prince long with Uarda yesterday?\"  \"No, you fool,\" laughed the witch, \"the children play together.  Rameri is a kid without horns, but who fancies he knows where they ought to grow.  Pentaur is a more dangerous rival with the red-headed girl.  Make haste, now; these stewards must not be kept waiting!\"  The old woman gave the dwarf a push, and he hurried back to Ani, while she carried the child, tied to his board, into the cave, and threw the sack over him.  A few minutes later the Regent stood before her.  She bowed before him with a demeanor that was more like the singer Beki than the sorceress Hekt, and begged him to take the only seat she possessed.  When, with a wave of his hand, he declined to sit down, she said:  \"Yes--yes--be seated!  then thou wilt not be seen from the valley, but be screened by the rocks close by.  Why hast thou chosen this hour for thy visit?\"  \"Because the matter presses of which I wish to speak,\" answered Ani; \"and in the evening I might easily be challenged by the watch.  My disguise is good.  Under this robe I wear my usual dress.  From this I shall go to the tomb of my father, where I shall take off this coarse thing, and these other disfigurements, and shall wait for my chariot, which is already ordered.  I shall tell people I had made a vow to visit the grave humbly, and on foot, which I have now fulfilled.\"  \"Well planned,\" muttered the old woman.  Ani pointed to the dwarf, and said politely: \"Your pupil.\"  Since her narrative the sorceress was no longer a mere witch in his eyes. The old woman understood this, and saluted him with a curtsey of such courtly formality, that a tame raven at her feet opened his black beak wide, and uttered a loud scream.  She threw a bit of cheese within the cave, and the bird hopped after it, flapping his clipped wings, and was silent.  \"I have to speak to you about Pentaur,\" said Ani.  The old woman's eyes flashed, and she eagerly asked, \"What of him?\"  \"I have reasons,\" answered the Regent, \"for regarding him as dangerous to me.  He stands in my way.  He has committed many crimes, even murder; but he is in favor at the House of Seti, and they would willingly let him go unpunished.  They have the right of sitting in judgment on each other, and I cannot interfere with their decisions; the day before yesterday they pronounced their sentence.  They would send him to the quarries of Chennu.       [Chennu is now Gebel Silsileh; the quarries there are of enormous      extent, and almost all the sandstone used for building the temples      of Upper Egypt was brought from thence.  The Nile is narrower there      than above, and large stela, were erected there by Rameses II.  his      successor Mernephtah, on which were inscribed beautiful hymns to the      Nile, and lists of the sacrifices to be offered at the Nile-      festivals.  These inscriptions can be restored by comparison, and my      friend Stern and I had the satisfaction of doing this on the spot      (Zeitschrift fur Agyptishe Sprache, 1873, p.  129.)]  \"All my objections were disregarded, and now Nemu, go over to the grave of Anienophis, and wait there for me--I wish to speak to your mother alone.\"  Nemu bowed, and then went down the slope, disappointed, it is true, but sure of learning later what the two had discussed together.  When the little man had disappeared, Ani asked:  \"Have you still a heart true to the old royal house, to which your parents were so faithfully attached?\"  The old woman nodded.  \"Then you will not refuse your help towards its restoration.  You understand how necessary the priesthood is to me, and I have sworn not to make any attempt on Pentaur's life; but, I repeat it, he stands in my way.  I have my spies in the House of Seti, and I know through them what the sending of the poet to Chennu really means.  For a time they will let him hew sandstone, and that will only improve his health, for he is as sturdy as a tree.  In Chennu, as you know, besides the quarries there is the great college of priests, which is in close alliance with the temple of Seti.  When the flood begins to rise, and they hold the great Nile- festival in Chennu, the priests there have the right of taking three of the criminals who are working in the quarries into their house as servants.  Naturally they will, next year, choose Pentaur, set him at liberty--and I shall be laughed at.\"  \"Well considered!\"  said aid Hekt.  \"I have taken counsel with myself, with Katuti, and even with Nemu,\" continued Ani, \"but all that they have suggested, though certainly practicable, was unadvisable, and at any rate must have led to conjectures which I must now avoid.  What is your opinion?\"  \"Assa's race must be exterminated!\" muttered the old woman hoarsely.  She gazed at the ground, reflecting.  \"Let the boat be scuttled,\" she said at last, \"and sink with the chained prisoners before it reaches Chennu.\"  \"No-no; I thought of that myself, and Nemu too advised it,\" cried Ani. \"That has been done a hundred times, and Ameni will regard me as a perjurer, for I have sworn not to attempt Pentaur's life.\"  \"To be sure, thou hast sworn that, and men keep their word--to each other.  Wait a moment, how would this do?  Let the ship reach Chennu with the prisoners, but, by a secret order to the captain, pass the quarries in the night, and hasten on as fast as possible as far as Ethiopia.  From Suan,--[The modem Assuan at the first cataract.]--the prisoners may be conducted through the desert to the gold workings.  Four weeks or even eight may pass before it is known here what has happened.  If Ameni attacks thee about it, thou wilt be very angry at this oversight, and canst swear by all the Gods"]]]
