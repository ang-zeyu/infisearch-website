He began to feel like a man who, in wading through a bog, has gained firm ground with one foot, and all these feelings gave him energy to walk up to the anchorite with a self-control, of which he was not generally master, excepting when on duty at the head of his soldiers.  He approached the Alexandrian with an assumption of dignity and a demeanor which testified to his formerly having taken part in the representations of tragedies in the theatres of great cities.  Paulus, on his part, did not retreat by a single step, but looked at him with a smile that alarmed Petrus and the rest of the bystanders.  The law put the anchorite absolutely into the power of the outraged husband, but Phoebicius did not seem disposed to avail himself of his rights, and nothing but contempt and loathing were perceptible in his tone, as he said:  \"A man who takes hold of a mangy dog in order to punish him, only dirties his hand.  The woman who betrayed me for your sake, and you--you dirty beggar--are worthy of each other.  I could crush you like a fly that can be destroyed by a blow of my hand if I chose, but my sword is Caesar's, and shall never be soiled by such foul blood as yours; however, the beast shall not have cast off his skin for nothing, it is thick, and so you have only spared me the trouble of tearing it off you before giving you your due.  You shall find no lack of blows.  Confess where your sweetheart has fled to and they shall be few, but if you are slow to answer they will be many.  Lend me that thing there, fellow!\"  With these words he took a whip of hippopotamus hide out of a camel- driver's band, went close up to the Alexandrian, and asked: \"Where is Sirona?\"  \"Nay, you may beat me,\" said Paulus.  \"However hard your whip may fall on me, it cannot be heavy enough for my sins; but as to where your wife is hiding, that I really cannot tell you--not even if you were to tear my limbs with pincers instead of stroking me with that wretched thing.\"  There was something so genuinely honest in Paulus' voice and tone, that the centurion was inclined to believe him; but it was not his way to let a threatened punishment fail of execution, and this strange beggar should learn by experience that when his hand intended to hit hard, it was far from \"stroking.\"  And Paulus did experience it, without uttering a cry, and without stirring from the spot where he stood.  When at last Phoebicius dropped his weary arm and breathlessly repeated his question, the ill-used man replied, \"I told you before I do not know, and therefore I cannot reveal it.\"  Up to this moment Petrus, though he had felt strongly impelled to rush to the rescue of his severely handled fellow-believer, had nevertheless allowed the injured husband to have his way, for he seemed disposed to act with unusual mildness, and the Alexandrian to be worthy of all punishment; but at this point Dorothea's request would not have been needed to prompt him to interfere.  He went up to the centurion, and said to him in an undertone, \"You have given the evil-doer his due, and if you desire that he should undergo a severer punishment than you can inflict, carry the matter--I say once more--before the bishop.  You will gain nothing more here.  Take my word for it, I know the man and his fellow-men; he actually knows nothing of where your wife is hiding, and you are only wasting the time and strength which you would do better to save, in order to search for Sirona. I fancy she will have tried to reach the sea, and to get to Egypt or possibly to Alexandria; and there--you know what the Greek city is--she will fall into utter ruin.\"  \"And so,\" laughed the Gaul, \"find what she seeks--variety, and every kind of pleasure.  For a young thing like that, who loves amusement, there is no pleasant occupation but vice.  But I will spoil her game; you are right, it is not well to give her too long a start.  If she has found the road to the sea, she may already--Hey, here Talib!\"  He beckoned to Polykarp's Amalekite messenger.  \"You have just come from Raithu; did you meet a flying woman on the way, with yellow hair and a white face?\"  The Amalekite, a free man with sharp eyes, who was highly esteemed in the senator's house, and even by Phoebicius himself, as a trustworthy and steady man, had expected this question, and eagerly replied:  \"At two stadia beyond el Heswe I met a large caravan from Petra, which rested yesterday in the oasis here; a woman, such as you describe, was running with it.  When I heard what had happened here I wanted to speak, but who listens to a cricket while it thunders?\"  \"Had she a lame greyhound with her?\"  asked Phoebicius, full of expectation.  \"She carried something in her arms,\" answered the Amalekite.  \"In the moonlight I took it for a baby.  My brother, who was escorting the caravan, told me the lady was no doubt running away, for she had paid the charge for the escort not in ready money, but with a gold signet-ring.\"  The Gaul remembered a certain gold ring with a finely carved onyx, which long years ago he had taken from Glycera's finger, for she had another one like it, and which he had given to Sirona on the day of their marriage.  \"It is strange!\"  thought he,  \"what we give to women to bind them to us they use as weapons to turn against us, be it to please some other man, or to smooth the path by which they escape from us.  It was with a bracelet of Glycera's that I paid the captain of the ship that brought us to Alexandria; but the soft-hearted fool, whose dove flew after me, and I are men of a different stamp; I will follow my flown bird, and catch it again.\"  He spoke the last words aloud, and then desired one of the senator's slaves to give his mule a good feed and drink, for his own groom, and the superior decurion who during his absence must take his place, were also worshippers of Mithras, and had not yet returned from the mountain.  Phoebicius did not doubt that the woman who had joined the caravan--which he himself had seen yesterday--was his fugitive wife, and he knew that his delay might have reduced his earnest wish to overtake her and punish her to the remotest probability; but he was a Roman soldier, and would rather have laid violent hands on himself than have left his post without a deputy.  When at last his fellow-worshippers came from their sacrifice and worship of the rising sun, his preparations for his long journey were completed.  Phoebicius carefully impressed on the decurion all he had to do during his absence, and how he was to conduct himself; then he delivered the key of his house into Petrus' keeping as well as the black slave-woman, who wept loudly and passionately over the flight of her mistress; he requested the senator to bring the anchorite's misdeed to the knowledge of the bishop, and then, guided by the Amalekite Talib, who rode before him on his dromedary, he trotted hastily away in pursuit of the caravan, so as to reach the sea, if possible, before its embarkation.  As the hoofs of the mule sounded fainter and fainter in the distance, Paulus also quitted the senator's courtyard; Dorothea pointed after him as he walked towards the mountain.  \"In truth, husband,\" said she, \"this has been a strange morning; everything that has occurred looks as clear as day, and yet I cannot understand it all.  My heart aches when I think what may happen to the wretched Sirona if her enraged husband overtakes her.  It seems to me that there are two sorts of marriage; one was instituted by the most loving of the angels, nay, by the All-merciful Himself, but the other it is not to be thought of!  How can those two live together for the future?  And that under our roof!  Their closed house looks to me as though ruined and burnt-out, and we have already seen the nettles spring up which grow everywhere among the ruins of human dwellings.\"     CHAPTER XII.  The path of every star is fixed and limited, every plant bears flowers and fruit which in form and color exactly resemble their kind, and in all the fundamental characteristics of their qualities and dispositions, of their instinctive bent and external impulse, all animals of the same species resemble each other; thus, the hunter who knows the red-deer in his father's forest, may know in every forest on earth how the stag will behave in any given case.  The better a genus is fitted for variability in the conformation of its individuals, the higher is the rank it is entitled to hold in the graduated series of creatures capable of development; and it is precisely that wonderful many-sidedness of his inner life, and of its outward manifestation, which assigns to man his superiority over all other animated beings.  Some few of our qualities and activities can be fitly symbolized in allegorical fashion by animals; thus, courage finds an emblem in the lion, gentleness in the dove, but the perfect human form has satisfied a thousand generations, and will satisfy a thousand more, when we desire to reduce the divinity to a sensible image, for, in truth, our heart is as surely capable of comprehending \"God in us,\"--that is in our feelings-- as our intellect is capable of comprehending His outward manifestation in the universe.  Every characteristic of every finite being is to be found again in man, and no characteristic that we can attribute to the Most High is foreign to our own soul, which, in like manner, is infinite and immeasurable, for it can extend its investigating feelers to the very utmost boundary of space and time.  Hence, the roads which are open to the soul, are numberless as those of the divinity.  Often they seem strange, but the initiated very well know that these roads are in accordance to fixed laws, and that even the most exceptional emotions of the soul may be traced back to causes which were capable of giving rise to them and to no others."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5496"],["title","Homo Sum — Volume 03 (#5)"],["body"," hurt, disgrace is a burden, and unjust punishment embitters the heart, but Paulus' soul had sought and found a way to which these simple propositions did not apply.  He had been ill-used and contemned, and, though perfectly innocent, ere he left the oasis he was condemned to the severest penance.  As soon as the bishop had heard from Petrus of all that had happened in his house, he had sent for Paulus, and as he could answer nothing to the accusation, he had expelled him from his flock--to which the anchorites belonged-- forbidden him to visit the church on week-days, and declared that this his sentence should be publicly proclaimed before the assembled congregation of the believers.  And how did this affect Paulus as he climbed the mountain, lonely and proscribed?  A fisherman from the little seaport of Pharan, who met him half-way and exchanged a greeting with him, thought to himself as he looked after him, \"The great graybeard looks as happy as if he had found a treasure.\"  Then he walked on into the valley with his scaly wares, reminded, as he went, of his son's expression of face when his wife bore him his first little one.  Near the watch-tower at the edge of the defile, a party of anchorites were piling some stones together.  They had already heard of the bishop's sentence on Paulus, the sinner, and they gave him no greeting.  He observed it and was silent, but when they could no longer see him he laughed to himself and muttered, while he rubbed a weal that the centurion's whip had left upon his back, \"If they think that a Gaul's cudgel has a pleasant flavor they are mistaken, however I would not exchange it for a skin of Anthyllan wine; and if they could only know that at least one of the stripes which torments me is due to each one of themselves, they would be surprised!  But away with pride!  How they spat on Thee, Jesus my Lord, and who am I, and how mildly have they dealt with me, when I for once have taken on my back another's stripes.  Not a drop of blood was drawn!  I wish the old man had hit harder!\"  He walked cheerfully forward, and his mind recurred to the centurion's speech that he could if he list, \"tread him down like a worm,\" and he laughed again softly, for he was quite aware that he was ten times as strong as Phoebicius, and formerly he had overthrown the braggart Arkesilaos of Kyrene and his cousin, the tall Xenophanes, both at once in the sand of the Palaestra.  Then he thought of Hermas, of his sweet dead mother, and of his father, and--which was the most comforting thought of all--of how he had spared the old man this bitter sorrow.  On his path there grew a little plant with a reddish blossom.  In years he had never looked at a flower or, at any rate, had never wished to possess one; to-day he stooped down over the blossom that graced the rock, meaning to pluck it.  But he did not carry out his intention, for before he had laid his hand upon it, he reflected:  \"To whom could I offer it?  And perhaps the flowers themselves rejoice in the light, and in the silent life that is in their roots.  How tightly it clings to the rock.  Farther away from the road flowers of even greater beauty blow, seen by no mortal eye; they deck themselves in beauty for no one but for their Creator, and because they rejoice in themselves.  I too will withdraw from the highways of mankind; let them accuse me!  So long as I live at peace with myself and my God I ask nothing of any one.  He that abases himself--aye, he that abases himself!--My hour too shall come, and above and beyond this life I shall see them all once more; Petrus and Dorothea, Agapitus and the brethren who now refuse to receive me, and then, when my Saviour himself beckons me to Him, they will see me as I am, and hasten to me and greet me with double kindness.\"  He looked up, proud and rejoicing as he thought thus, and painted to himself the joys of Paradise, to which this day he had earned an assured claim.  He never took longer and swifter steps than when his mind was occupied with such meditations, and when he reached Stephanus' cave he thought the way from the oasis to the heights had been shorter than usual.  He found the sick man in great anxiety, for he had waited until now for his son in vain, and feared that Hermas had met with some accident--or had abandoned him, and fled out into the world.  Paulus soothed him with gentle words, and told him of the errand on which he had sent the lad to the farther coast of the sea.  We are never better disposed to be satisfied with even bad news than when we have expected it to be much worse; so Stephanus listened to his friend's explanation quite calmly, and with signs of approval.  He could no longer conceal from himself that Hermas was not ripe for the life of an anchorite, and since he had learned that his unhappy wife--whom he had so long given up for lost--had died a Christian, he found that he could reconcile his thoughts to relinquishing the boy to the world.  He had devoted himself and his son to a life of penance, hoping and striving that so Glycera's soul might be snatched from damnation, and now he knew that she herself had earned her title to Heaven.  \"When will he come home again?\"  he asked Paulus.  \"In five or six days,\" was the answer.  \"Ali, the fisherman--out of whose foot I took a thorn some time since--informed me secretly, as I was going to church yesterday, that the Blemmyes are gathering behind the sulphur- mountains; when they have withdrawn, it will be high time to send Hermas to Alexandria.  My brother is still alive, and for my sake he will receive him as a blood-relation, for he too has been baptized.\"  \"He may attend the school of catechumens in the metropolis, and if he-- if he--\"  \"That we shall see,\" interrupted Paulus.  \"For the present it comes to this, we must let him go from hence, and leave him to seek out his own way.  You fancy that there may be in heaven a place of glory for such as have never been overcome, and you would fain have seen Hermas among them. It reminds me of the physician of Corinth, who boasted that he was cleverer than any of his colleagues, for that not one of his patients had ever died.  And the man was right, for neither man nor beast had ever trusted to his healing arts.  Let Hermas try his young strength, and even if he be no priest, but a valiant warrior like his forefathers, even so he may honestly serve God.  But it will be a long time before all this comes to pass.  So long as he is away I will attend on you--you still have some water in your jar?\"  \"It has twice been filled for me,\" said the old man.  \"The brown shepherdess, who so often waters her goats at our spring, came to me the first thing in the morning and again about two hours ago; she asked after Hermas, and then offered of her own accord to fetch water for me so long as he was away.  She is as timid as a bird, and flew off as soon as she had set down the jug.\"  \"She belongs to Petrus and cannot leave her goats for long,\" said Paulus. \"Now I will go and find you some herbs for a relish; there will be no more wine in the first place.  Look me in the face--for how great a sinner now do you take me?  Think the very worst of me, and yet perhaps you will hear worse said of me.  But here come two men.  Stay! one is Hilarion, one of the bishop's acolytes, and the other is Pachomius the Memphite, who lately came to the mountain.  They are coming up here, and the Egyptian is carrying a small jar.  I would it might hold some more wine to keep up your strength.\"  The two friends had not long to remain in ignorance of their visitor's purpose.  So soon as they reached Stephanus' cave, both turned their backs on Paulus with conspicuously marked intention; nay the acolyte signed his brow with the cross, as if he thought it necessary to protect himself against evil influences.  The Alexandrian understood; he drew back and was silent, while Hilarion explained to the sick man that Paulus was guilty of grave sins, and that, until he had done full penance, he must remain excluded as a rotten sheep from the bishop's flock, as well as interdicted from waiting on a pious Christian.  \"We know from Petrus,\" the speaker went on, \"that your son, father, has been sent across the sea, and as you still need waiting on, Agapitus sends you by me his blessing and this strengthening wine; this youth too will stay by you, and provide you with all necessaries until Hermas comes home.\"  With these words he gave the wine-jar to the old man, who looked in astonishment from him to Paulus, who felt indeed cut to the heart when the bishop's messenger turned to him for an instant, and with the cry, \"Get thee out from among us!\" disappeared.  How many kindly ties, how many services willingly rendered and affectionately accepted were swept away by these words--but Paulus obeyed at once.  He went up to his sick friend, their eyes met and each could see that the eyes of the other were dimmed with tears.  \"Paulus!\" cried the old man, stretching out both his hands to his departing friend, whom he felt he could forgive whatever his guilt; but the Alexandrian did not take them, but turned away, and, without looking back, hastily went up the mountain to a pathless spot, and then on towards the valley--onwards and still onwards, till he was brought to a pause by the steep declivity of the hollow way which led southwards from the mountains into the oasis.  The sun stood high and it was burning hot.  Streaming with sweat and panting for breath he leaned against the glowing porphyry wall behind him, hid his face in his hands and strove to collect himself, to think, to pray--for a long time in vain; for instead of joy in the suffering which he had taken upon himself, the grief of isolation weighed upon his heart, and the lamentable cry of the old man had left a warning echo in his soul, and roused doubts of the righteousness of a deed, by which even the best and purest had been deceived, and led into injustice towards"]]]
