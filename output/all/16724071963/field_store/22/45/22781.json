Charmian, too, was the Queen's confidante; and if the manner of Iras and Alexas had alarmed her, Charmian's might well inspire confidence.  All these thoughts darted through her brain with the speed of lightning. Only a brief time for consideration remained; for, even as she bowed her head on the bosom of her friend, the \"introducer\" entered the room, crying, \"Her illustrious Majesty will expect those whom she summoned in a few minutes!\"  Soon after a chamberlain appeared, waving a fan of ostrich feathers and, preceded by the court official, they passed through several brilliantly lighted, richly furnished rooms.  Barine again breathed freely and moved with head erect; and when the wide, lofty folding doors of ebony, against whose deep black surface the inlaid figures of Tritons, mermaids, shells, fish, and sea monsters were sharply relieved, she beheld a glittering, magnificent scene, for the hall which Cleopatra had chosen for her reception was completely covered with various marine forms, from the shells to coral and starfish.  A wide, lofty structure, composed of masses of stalactites and unhewn blocks of stone, formed a deep grotto at the end of the hall, whence peered the gigantic head of a monster whose open jaws formed the fireplace of the chimney.  Logs of fragrant Arabian wood were blazing brightly on the hearth, and the dragon's ruby glass eyes diffused a red light through the apartment which, blended with the rays of the white and pink lamps in the shape of lotus flowers fastened among gold and silver tendrils and groups of sedges on the walls and ceiling, filling the spacious apartment with the soft light whose roseate hue was specially becoming to Cleopatra's waxen complexion.  Several stewards and cup-bearers, the master of the hunt, chamberlains, female attendants, eunuchs, and other court officials were awaiting the Queen, and pages who belonged to the Macedonian cadet corps of royal boys stood sleepily, with drooping heads, around the small throne of gold, coral, and amber which, placed opposite to the chimney, awaited the sovereign.  Barine had already seen this magnificent hall, and others still more beautiful in the Sebasteum, and the splendour therefore neither excited nor abashed her; only she would fain have avoided the numerous train of courtiers.  Could it be Cleopatra's intention to question her before the eyes of all these men, women, and boys?  She no longer felt afraid, but her heart still throbbed quickly.  It had beat in the same way in her girlhood, when she was asked to sing in the presence of strangers.  At last she heard doors open, and an invisible hand parted the heavy curtains at her right.  She expected to see the Regent, the Keeper of the Seal, and the whole brilliantly adorned train of attendants who always surrounded the Queen on formal occasions, enter the magnificent hall. Else why had it been selected as the scene of this nocturnal trial?  But what was this?  While she was still recalling the display at the Adonis festival, the curtains began to close again.  The courtiers around the throne straightened their bowed figures, the pages forgot their fatigue, and all joined in the Greek salutation of welcome, and the \"Life! happiness! health!\" with which the Egyptians greeted their sovereign.  The woman of middle height who now appeared before the curtain, and who, as she crossed the wide hall alone and unattended, seemed to Barine even smaller than when surrounded by the gay throng at the Adonis festival, must be the Queen.  Ay, it was she!  Iras was already standing by her side, and Charmian was approaching with the \"introducer.\"  The women rendered her various little services thus Iras took from her shoulders the purple mantle, with its embroidery of black and gold dragons.  What an exquisite masterpiece of the loom it must be!  All the dangers against which she must defend herself flashed swiftly through Barine's mind; yet, for an instant, she felt the foolish feminine desire to see and handle the costly mantle.  But Iras had already laid it on the arm of one of the waiting maids, and Cleopatra now glanced around her, and with a youthful, elastic step approached the throne.  Once more the feeling of timidity which she had had in her girlhood overpowered Barine, but with it came the memory of the garden of Epicurus, and Archibius's assurance that she, too, would have left the Queen with her heart overflowing with warm enthusiasm had not a disturbing influence interposed between them.  Yet, had this disturbing influence really existed?  No.  It was created solely by Cleopatra's jealous imagination.  If she would only permit her to speak freely now, she should hear that Antony cared as little for her as she, Barine, for the boy Caesarion.  What prevented her from confessing that her heart was another's?  Iras had no one to blame save herself if she spoke the truth pitilessly in her presence.  Cleopatra now turned to the \"introducer,\" waving her hand towards the throne and those who surrounded it.  Ay, she was indeed beautiful.  How bright and clear was the light of her large eyes, in spite of the harassing days through which she had passed and the present night of watching!  Cleopatra's heart was still elated by the reception of her bold idea of escape, and she approached Barine with gentler feelings and intentions. She had chosen a pleasanter room for the interview than the one Iras had selected.  She desired a special environment to suit each mood, and as soon as she saw the group of courtiers who surrounded the throne she ordered their dismissal.  The \"introducer,\" to carry out the usual ceremonial, had commanded their presence in the audience chamber, but their attendance had given the meeting a form which was now distasteful to the Queen.  She wished to question, not to condemn.  At so happy an hour it was a necessity of her nature to be gracious. Perhaps she had been unduly anxious concerning this singer.  It even seemed probable; for a man who loved her like Antony could scarcely yearn for the favour of another woman.  This view had been freshly confirmed by a brief conversation with the chief Inspector of Sacrifices, an estimable old man, who, after hearing how Antony had hurried in pursuit of her at Actium, raised his eyes and hands as if transported with rapture, exclaiming: \"Unhappy Queen!  Yet happiest of women!  No one was ever so ardently beloved; and when the tale is told of the noble Trojan who endured such sore sufferings for a woman's sake, future generations will laud the woman whose resistless spell constrained the greatest man of his day, the hero of heroes, to cast aside victory, fame, and the hope of the world's sovereignty, as mere worthless rubbish.\"  Posterity, whose verdict she dreaded--this wise old reader of the future was right--must extol her as the most fervently beloved, the most desirable of women.  And Mark Antony?  Even had the magic power of Nektanebus's goblet forced him to follow her and to leave the battle, there still remained his will, a copy of which--received from Rome--Zeno, the Keeper of the Seal, had showed to her at the close of the council.  \"Wherever he might die,\" so ran the words, \"he desired to be buried by the side of Cleopatra.\" Octavianus had wrested it from the Vestal Virgins, to whose care it had been entrusted, in order to fill the hearts of Roman citizens and matrons with indignation against his foe.  The plot had succeeded, but the document had reminded Cleopatra that her heart had given this man the first of its flowers, that love for him had been the sunshine of her life.  So, with head erect, she had crossed the threshold where she was to meet the woman who had ventured to sow tares in her garden.  She intended to devote only a short time to the interview, which she anticipated with the satisfaction of the strong who are confident of victory.  As she approached the throne, her train left the hall; the only persons who remained were Charmian, Iras, Zeno, the Keeper of the Seal, and the \"introducer.\"  Cleopatra cast a rapid glance at the throne, to which an obsequious gesture of the courtier's hand invited her; but she remained standing, gazing keenly at Barine.  Was it the coloured rays from the ruby eyes of the dragon in the fireplace which shed the roseate glow on Cleopatra's cheeks?  It certainly enhanced the beauty of a face now only too frequently pallid and colourless, when rouge did not lend its aid; but Barine understood Archibius's ardent admiration for this rare woman, when Cleopatra, with a faint smile, requested her to approach.  Nothing more winning could be imagined than the frank kindness, wholly untinged by condescending pride, of this powerful sovereign.  The less Barine had expected such a reception the more deeply it moved her; nay, her eyes grew dim with grateful emotion, which lent them so beautiful a lustre, she looked so lovely in her glad surprise, that Cleopatra thought the months which had elapsed since her first meeting with the singer had enhanced her charms.  And how young she was!  The Queen swiftly computed the years which Barine must have lived as the wife of Philostratus, and afterwards as the attractive mistress of a hospitable house, and found it difficult to reconcile the appearance of this blooming young creature with the result of the calculation.  She was surprised, too, to note the aristocratic bearing whose possession no one could deny the artist's daughter.  This was apparent even in her dress, yet Iras had roused her in the middle of the night, and certainly had given her no time for personal adornment.  She had expected lack of refinement and boldness, in the woman who was said to have attracted so many men, but even the most bitter prejudice could have detected no trace of it.  On the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5477"],["title","Cleopatra â€” Volume 05 (#3)"],["body","ontrary, the embarrassment which she could not yet wholly subdue lent her an air of girlish timidity.  All in all, Barine was a charming creature, who bewitched men by her vivacity, her grace, and her exquisite voice, not by coquetry and pertness.  That she possessed unusual mental endowments Cleopatra did not believe.  Barine had only one advantage over her--youth.  Time had not yet robbed the former of a single charm, while from the Queen he had wrested many; their number was known only to herself and her confidantes, but at this hour she did not miss them.  Barine, with a low, modest bow, advanced towards the Queen, who commenced the conversation by graciously apologizing for the late hour at which she had summoned her.  \"But,\" she added, \"you belong to the ranks of the nightingales, who during the night most readily and exquisitely reveal to us what stirs their hearts--\"  Barine gazed silently at the floor a moment, and when she raised her eyes her voice was faint and timid.  \"I sing, it is true, your Majesty, but I have nothing else in common with the birds.  The wings which, when a child, bore me wherever I desired, have lost their strength.  They do not wholly refuse their service, but they now require favourable hours to move.\"  \"I should not have expected that in the time of your youth, your most beautiful possession,\" replied the Queen.  \"Yet it is well.  I too--how long ago it seems!--was a child, and my imagination outstripped even the flight of the eagle.  It could dare the risk unpunished.  Now----Whoever has reached mature life is wise to let these wings remain idle.  The mortal who ventures to use them may easily approach too near the sun, and, like Icarus, the wax will melt from his pinions.  Let me tell you this: To the child the gift of imagination is nourishing bread.  In later years we need it only as salt, as spice, as stimulating wine.  Doubtless it points out many paths, and shows us their end; but, of a hundred rambles to which it summons him, scarcely one pleases the mature man.  No troublesome parasite is more persistently and sharply rebuffed.  Who can blame the ill-treated friend if it is less ready to serve us as the years go on?  The wise man will keep his ears ever open, but rarely lend it his active hand.  To banish it from life is to deprive the plant of blossoms, the rose of its fragrance, the sky of its stars.\"  \"I have often said the same things to myself, though in a less clear and beautiful form, when life has been darkened,\" replied Barine, with a faint blush; for she felt that these words were doubtless intended to warn her against cherishing too aspiring wishes.  \"But, your Majesty, here also the gods place you, the great Queen, far above us.  We should often find existence bare indeed but for the fancy which endows us with imaginary possessions.  You have the power to secure a thousand things which to us common mortals only the gift of imagination pictures as attainable.\"  \"You believe that happiness is like wealth, and that the happiest person is the one who receives the largest number of the gifts of fortune,\" answered the Queen.  \"The contrary, I think, can be easily proved.  The maxim that the more we have the less we need desire, is also false, though in this world there are only a certain number of desirable things. He who already possesses one of ten solidi which are to be divided, ought really to desire only nine, and therefore would be poorer by a wish than another who has none.  True, it cannot be denied that the gods have burdened or endowed me with a greater number of perishable gifts than you and many others.  You seem to set a high value upon them.  Doubtless there may be one or another which you could appropriate only by the aid of the imagination.  May I ask which seems to you the most desirable?\"  \"Spare me the choice, I beseech you,\" replied Barine in an embarrassed tone.  \"I need nothing from your treasures, and, as for the other possessions  I lack many things; but it is uncertain how the noblest and highest gifts in the possession of the marvellously endowed favourite of the gods would suit the small, commonplace ones I call mine, and I know not--\"  \"A sensible doubt!\" interrupted the Queen.  \"The lame man, who desired a horse, obtained one, and on his first ride broke his neck.  The only blessing--the highest of all--which surely bestows happiness can neither be given away nor transferred from one to another.  He who has gained it may be robbed of it the next moment.\"  The last sentence had fallen from the Queen's lips slowly and thoughtfully, but Barine, remembering Archibius's tale, said modestly, \"You are thinking of the chief good mentioned by Epicurus--perfect peace of mind.\"  Cleopatra's eyes sparkled with a brighter light as she asked eagerly, \"Do you, the granddaughter of a philosopher, know the system of the master?\"  \"Very superficially, your Majesty.  My intellect is far inferior to yours.  It is difficult for me thoroughly to comprehend all the details of any system of philosophy.\"  \"Yet you have attempted it?\"  \"Others endeavoured to introduce me into the doctrines of the Stoics. I have forgotten most of what I learned; only one thing lingered in my memory, and I know why--because it pleased me.\"  \"And that?\"  \"Was the wise law of living according to the dictates of our own natures. The command to shun everything contradictory to the simple fundamental traits of our own characters pleased me, and wherever I saw affectation, artificiality, and mannerism I was repelled, while from my grandfather's teaching I drew the principle that I could do nothing better than to remain, so far as life would permit, what I had been as a child ere I had heard the first word of philosophy, or felt the constraint which society and its forms impose.\"  \"So the system of the Stoics leads to this end also!\" cried the Queen gaily, and, turning to the companion of her own studies, she added: \"Did you hear, Charmian?  If we had only succeeded in perceiving the wisdom and calm, purposeful order of existence which the Stoics, amid so much that is perverse, unhealthy, and provocative of contradiction, nevertheless set above everything else!  How can I, in order to live wisely, imitate Nature, when in her being and action I encounter so much that is contradictory to my human reason, which is a part of the divine?\"  Here she hesitated, and the expression of her face suddenly changed.  She had advanced close to Barine and, while standing directly in front of her, her eyes had rested on the gem which adorned her arm above the elbow.  Was it this which agitated Cleopatra so violently that her voice lost its bewitching melody, as she went on in a harsh, angry tone?--\"So that is the source of all this misfortune.  Even as a child I detested that sort of arbitrary judgment which passes under the mask of stern morality. There is an example!  Do you hear the howling of the storm?  In human nature, as well as in the material world, there are tempests and volcanoes which bring destruction, and, if the original character of any individual is full of such devastating forces, like the neighbourhood of Vesuvius or Etna, the goal to which his impulses would lead him is clearly visible.  Ay, the Stoic is not allowed to destroy the harmony and order of things in existence, any more than to disturb those which are established by the state.  But to follow our natural impulses wherever they lead us is so perilous a venture, that whoever has the power to fix a limit to it betimes is in duty bound to do so.  This power is mine, and I will use it!\"  Then, with iron severity, she asked: \"As it seems to be one of the demands of your nature, woman, to allure and kindle the hearts of all who bear the name of man, even though they have not yet donned the garb of the Ephebi, so, too, you seem to appear to delight in idle ornaments. Or,\" and as she spoke she touched Barine's shoulder\"--or why should you wear, during the hours of slumber, that circlet on your arm?\"  Barine had watched with increasing anxiety the marked change in the manner and language of the Queen.  She now beheld a repetition of what she had experienced at the Adonis festival, but this time she knew what had roused Cleopatra's jealousy.  She, Barine, wore on her arm a gift from Antony.  With pallid face she strove to find a fitting answer, but ere she could do so Iras advanced to the side of the incensed Queen, saying: \"That circlet is the counterpart of the one your august husband bestowed upon you.  The singer's must also be a gift from Mark Antony. Like every one else in the world, she deems the noble Imperator the greatest man of his day.  Who can blame her for prizing it so highly that she does not remove it even while she sleeps?\"  Again Barine felt as if a thorn had pierced her; but though the resentment which she had previously experienced once more surged hotly within her heart, she forced herself to maintain seemly external composure, and struggled for some word in answer; but she found none suitable, and remained silent.  She had told the truth.  From early youth she had followed the impulses of her own nature without heeding the opinion of mortals, as the teachings of the Stoics directed, and she had been allowed to do so because this nature was pure, truthful, alive to the beautiful, and, moreover, free from those unbridled, volcanic impulses to which the Queen alluded.  The cheerful patience of her soul had found ample satisfaction in the cultivation of her art, and in social intercourse with men who permitted her to share their own intellectual life.  Today she had learned that the first great passion of her heart had met with a response.  Now she was bound to her lover, and knew herself to be pure and guiltless, far better entitled to demand respect from sterner judges of morality than the woman who condemned her, or the spiteful Iras, who had not ceased to offer her love to Dion.
