Then, turning half to the young Rameri and half to his sister, she said:  \"The chief of the House of Seti, Ameni, was in his youth such a man as thou paintest, Bent-Anat.  Tell us, thou son of Rameses, that art growing up under the young sycamores, which shall some day over-shadow the land- whom dost thou esteem the highest among thy companions?  Is there one among them, who is conspicuous above them all for a lofty spirit and strength of intellect?\"  The young Rameri looked gaily at the speaker, and said laughing: \"We are all much alike, and do more or less willingly what we are compelled, and by preference every thing that we ought not.\"  \"A mighty soul--a youth, who promises to be a second Snefru, a Thotmes, or even an Amem?  Dost thou know none such in the House of Seti?\"  asked the widow.  \"Oh yes!\"  cried Rameri with eager certainty.  \"And he is--?\"  asked Katuti.  \"Pentaur, the poet,\" exclaimed the youth.  Bent-Anat's face glowed with scarlet color, while her, brother went on to explain.  \"He is noble and of a lofty soul, and all the Gods dwell in him when he speaks.  Formerly we used to go to sleep in the lecture-hall; but his words carry us away, and if we do not take in the full meaning of his thoughts, yet we feel that they are genuine and noble.\"  Bent-Anat breathed quicker at these words, and her eyes hung on the boy's lips.  \"You know him, Bent-Anat,\" continued Rameri.  \"He was with you at the paraschites' house, and in the temple-court when Ameni pronounced you unclean.  He is as tall and handsome as the God Mentli, and I feel that he is one of those whom we can never forget when once we have seen them. Yesterday, after you had left the temple, he spoke as he never spoke before; he poured fire into our souls.  Do not laugh, Katuti, I feel it burning still.  This morning we were informed that he had been sent from the temple, who knows where--and had left us a message of farewell.  It was not thought at all necessary to communicate the reason to us; but we know more than the masters think.  He did not reprove you strongly enough, Bent-Anat, and therefore he is driven out of the House of Seti. We have agreed to combine to ask for him to be recalled; Anana is drawing up a letter to the chief priest, which we shall all subscribe.  It would turn out badly for one alone, but they cannot be at all of us at once. Very likely they will have the sense to recall him.  If not, we shall all complain to our fathers, and they are not the meanest in the land.\"  \"It is a complete rebellion,\" cried Katuti.  \"Take care, you lordlings; Ameni and the other prophets are not to be trifled with.\"  \"Nor we either,\" said Rameri laughing,  \"If Pentaur is kept in banishment, I shall appeal to my father to place me at the school at Heliopolis or Chennu, and the others will follow me.  Come, Bent-Anat, I must be back in the trap before sunset.  Excuse me, Katuti, so we call the school.  Here comes your little Nemu.\"  The brother and sister left the garden.  As soon as the ladies, who accompanied them, had turned their backs, Bent-Anat grasped her brother's hand with unaccustomed warmth, and said:  \"Avoid all imprudence; but your demand is just, and I will help you with all my heart.\"     CHAPTER XI.  As soon as Bent-Anat had quitted Mena's domain, the dwarf Nemu entered the garden with a letter, and briefly related his adventures; but in such a comical fashion that both the ladies laughed, and Katuti, with a lively gaiety, which was usually foreign to her, while she warned him, at the same time praised his acuteness.  She looked at the seal of the letter and said:  \"This is a lucky day; it has brought us great things, and the promise of greater things in the future.\"  Nefert came close up to her and said imploringly: \"Open the letter, and see if there is nothing in it from him.\"  Katuti unfastened the wax, looked through the letter with a hasty glance, stroked the cheek of her child, and said:  \"Perhaps your brother has written for him; I see no line in his handwriting.\"  Nefert on her side glanced at the letter, but not to read it, only to seek some trace of the well-known handwriting of her husband.  Like all the Egyptian women of good family she could read, and during the first two years of her married life she had often--very often--had the opportunity of puzzling, and yet rejoicing, over the feeble signs which the iron hand of the charioteer had scrawled on the papyrus for her whose slender fingers could guide the reed pen with firmness and decision.  She examined the letter, and at last said, with tears in her eyes:  \"Nothing!  I will go to my room, mother.\"  Katuti kissed her and said, \"Hear first what your brother writes.\"  But Nefert shook her head, turned away in silence, and disappeared into the house.  Katuti was not very friendly to her son-in-law, but her heart clung to her handsome, reckless son, the very image of her lost husband, the favorite of women, and the gayest youth among the young nobles who composed the chariot-guard of the king.  How fully he had written to-day--he who weilded the reed-pen so laboriously.  This really was a letter; while, usually, he only asked in the fewest words for fresh funds for the gratification of his extravagant tastes.  This time she might look for thanks, for not long since he must have received a considerable supply, which she had abstracted from the income of the possessions entrusted to her by her son-in-law.  She began to read.  The cheerfulness, with which she had met the dwarf, was insincere, and had resembled the brilliant colors of the rainbow, which gleam over the stagnant waters of a bog.  A stone falls into the pool, the colors vanish, dim mists rise up, and it becomes foul and clouded.  The news which her son's letter contained fell, indeed, like a block of stone on Katuti's soul.  Our deepest sorrows always flow from the same source as might have filled us with joy, and those wounds burn the fiercest which are inflicted by a hand we love.  The farther Katuti went in the lamentably incorrect epistle--which she could only decipher with difficulty--which her darling had written to her, the paler grew her face, which she several times covered with her trembling hands, from which the letter dropped.  Nemu squatted on the earth near her, and followed all her movements.  When she sprang forward with a heart-piercing scream, and pressed her forehead to a rough palmtrunk, he crept up to her, kissed her feet, and exclaimed with a depth of feeling that overcame even Katuti, who was accustomed to hear only gay or bitter speeches from the lips of her jester--  \"Mistress! lady!  what has happened?\"  Katuti collected herself, turned to him, and tried to speak; but her pale lips remained closed, and her eyes gazed dimly into vacancy as though a catalepsy had seized her.  \"Mistress!  Mistress!\"  cried the dwarf again, with growing agitation. \"What is the matter? shall I call thy daughter?\"  Katuti made a sign with her hand, and cried feebly: \"The wretches! the reprobates!\"  Her breath began to come quickly, the blood mounted to her cheeks and her flashing eyes; she trod upon the letter, and wept so loud and passionately, that the dwarf, who had never before seen tears in her eyes, raised himself timidly, and said in mild reproach: \"Katuti!\"  She laughed bitterly, and said with a trembling voice:  \"Why do you call my name so loud! it is disgraced and degraded.  How the nobles and the ladies will rejoice!  Now envy can point at us with spiteful joy--and a minute ago I was praising this day!  They say one should exhibit one's happiness in the streets, and conceal one's misery; on the contrary, on the contrary!  Even the Gods should not know of one's hopes and joys, for they too are envious and spiteful!\"  Again she leaned her head against the palm-tree.  \"Thou speakest of shame, and not of death,\" said Nemu, \"and I learned from thee that one should give nothing up for lost excepting the dead.\"  These words had a powerful effect on the agitated woman.  Quickly and vehemently she turned upon the dwarf saying.  \"You are clever, and faithful too, so listen!  but if you were Amon himself there is nothing to be done--\"  \"We must try,\" said Nemu, and his sharp eyes met those of his mistress.  \"Speak,\" he said, \"and trust me.  Perhaps I can be of no use; but that I can be silent thou knowest.\"  \"Before long the children in the streets will  talk of what this tells me,\" said Katuti, laughing with bitterness, \"only Nefert must know nothing of what has happened--nothing, mind; what is that? the Regent coming! quick, fly; tell him I am suddenly taken ill, very ill; I cannot see him, not now!  No one is to be admitted--no one, do you hear?\"  The dwarf went.  When he came back after he had fulfilled his errand, he found his mistress still in a fever of excitement.  \"Listen,\" she said; \"first the smaller matter, then the frightful, the unspeakable.  Rameses loads Mena with marks of his favor.  It came to a division of the spoils of war for the year; a great heap of treasure lay ready for each of his followers, and the charioteer had to choose before all the others.\"  \"Well?\"  said the dwarf.  \"Well!\"  echoed Katuti.  \"Well! how did the worthy householder care for his belongings at home, how did he seek to relieve his indebted estate? It is disgraceful, hideous!  He passed by the silver, the gold, the jewels, with a laugh; and took the captive daughter of the Danaid princes, and led her into his tent.\"  \"Shameful!\"  muttered the dwarf.  \"Poor, poor Nefert!\"  cried Katuti, covering her face with her hands.  \"And what more?\"  asked Nemu hastily.  \"That,\" said Katuti, \"that is--but I will keep calm--quite calm and quiet.  You know my son.  He is heedless, but he loves me and his sister more than anything in the world.  I, fool as I was, to persuade him to economy, had vividly described our evil plight, and after"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5441"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt — Volume 03 (#5)"],["body","disgraceful conduct of Mena he thought of us and of our anxieties.  His share of the booty was small, and could not help us.  His comrades threw dice for the shares they had obtained--he staked his to win more for us. He lost--all--all--and at last against an enormous sum, still thinking of us, and only of us, he staked the mummy of his dead father.       [It was a king of the fourth dynasty, named Asychis by Herodotus,      who it is admitted was the first to pledge the mummies of his      ancestors.  \"He who stakes this pledge and fails to redeem the debt      shall, after his death, rest neither in his father's tomb nor in any      other, and sepulture shall be denied to his descendants.\"  Herod.      11. 136.]  He lost.  If he does not redeem the pledge before the expiration of the third month, he will fall into infamy, the mummy will belong to the winner, and disgrace and ignominy will be my lot and his.\"  Katuti pressed her hands on her face, the dwarf muttered to himself, \"The gambler and hypocrite!\"  When his mistress had grown calmer, he said:  \"It is horrible, yet all is not lost.  How much is the debt?\"  It sounded like a heavy curse, when Katuti replied, \"Thirty Babylonian talents.\"--[L7000 sterling in 1881.]  The dwarf cried out, as if an asp had stung him.  \"Who dared to bid against such a mad stake?\"  \"The Lady Hathor's son, Antef,\" answered Katuti, \"who has already gambled away the inheritance of his fathers, in Thebes.\"  \"He will not remit one grain of wheat of his claim,\" cried the dwarf. \"And Mena?\"  \"How could my son turn to him after what had happened?  The poor child implores me to ask the assistance of the Regent.\"  \"Of the Regent?\"  said the dwarf, shaking his big head.  \"Impossible!\"  \"I know, as matters now stand; but his place, his name.\"  \"Mistress,\" said the dwarf, and deep purpose rang in the words, \"do not spoil the future for the sake of the present.  If thy son loses his honor under King Rameses, the future King, Ani, may restore it to him.  If the Regent now renders you all an important service, he will regard you as amply paid when our efforts have succeeded, and he sits on the throne. He lets himself be led by thee now because thou hast no need of his help, and dost seem to work only for his sake, and for his elevation.  As soon as thou hast appealed to him, and he has assisted thee, all thy confidence and freedom will be gone, and the more difficult he finds it to raise so large a sum of money at once, the angrier he will be to think that thou art making use of him.  Thou knowest his circumstances.\"  \"He is in debt,\" said Katuti.  \"I know that.\"  \"Thou should'st know it,\" cried the dwarf, \"for thou thyself hast forced him to enormous expenses.  He has won the people of Thebes with dazzling festive displays; as guardian of Apis       [When Apis (the sacred bull) died under Ptolemy I.  Soter, his      keepers spent not only the money which they had received for his      maintenance, in his obsequies but borrowed 50 talents of silver from      the king.  In the time of Diodurus 100 talents were spent for the      same purpose.]  he gave a large donation to Memphis; he bestowed thousands on the leaders of the troops sent into Ethiopia, which were equipped by him; what his spies cost him at, the camp of the king, thou knowest.  He has borrowed sums of money from most of the rich men in the country, and that is well, for so many creditors are so many allies.  The Regent is a bad debtor; but the king Ani, they reckon, will be a grateful payer.\"  Katuti looked at the dwarf in astonishment.  \"You know men!\"  she said.  \"To my sorrow!\"  replied Nemu.  \"Do not apply to the Regent, and before thou dost sacrifice the labor of years, and thy future greatness, and that of those near to thee, sacrifice thy son's honor.\"  \"And my husband's, and my own?\"  exclaimed Katuti.  \"How can you know what that is!  Honor is a word that the slave may utter, but whose meaning he can never comprehend; you rub the weals that are raised on you by blows; to me every finger pointed at me in scorn makes a wound like an ashwood lance with a poisoned tip of brass.  Oh ye holy Gods!  who can help us?\"  The miserable woman pressed her hands over her eyes, as if to shut out the sight of her own disgrace.  The dwarf looked at her compassionately, and said in a changed tone:  \"Dost thou remember the diamond which fell out of Nefert's handsomest ring?  We hunted for it, and could not find it.  Next day, as I was going through the room, I trod on something hard; I stooped down and found the stone.  What the noble organ of sight, the eye, overlooked, the callous despised sole of the foot found; and perhaps the small slave, Nemu, who knows nothing of honor, may succeed in finding a mode of escape which is not revealed to the lofty soul of his mistress!\"  \"What are you thinking of?\"  asked Katuti.  \"Escape,\" answered the dwarf.  \"Is it true that thy sister Setchem has visited thee, and that you are reconciled?\"  \"She offered me her hand, and I took it?\"  \"Then go to her.  Men are never more helpful than after a reconciliation. The enmity they have driven out, seems to leave as it were a freshly- healed wound which must be touched with caution; and Setchem is of thy own blood, and kind-hearted.\"  \"She is not rich,\" replied Katuti.  \"Every palm in her garden comes from her husband, and belongs to her children.\"  \"Paaker, too, was with you?\"  \"Certainly only by the entreaty of his mother--he hates my son-in-law.\"  \"I know it,\" muttered the dwarf, \"but if Nefert would ask him?\"  The widow drew herself up indignantly.  She felt that she had allowed the dwarf too much freedom, and ordered him to leave her alone.  Nemu kissed her robe and asked timidly:  \"Shall I forget that thou hast trusted me, or am I permitted to consider further as to thy son's safety?\"  Katuti stood for a moment undecided, then she said:  \"You were clever enough to find what I carelessly dropped; perhaps some God may show you what I ought to do.  Now leave me.\"  \"Wilt thou want me early to-morrow?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then I will go to the Necropolis, and offer a sacrifice.\"  \"Go!\"  said Katuti, and went towards the house with the fatal letter in her hand.  Nemu stayed behind alone; he looked thoughtfully at the ground, murmuring to himself.  \"She must not lose her honor; not at present, or indeed all will be lost.  What is this honor?  We all come into the world without it, and most of us go to the grave without knowing it, and very good folks notwithstanding.  Only a few who are rich and idle weave it in with the homely stuff of their souls, as the Kuschites do their hair with grease and oils, till it forms a cap of which, though it disfigures them, they are so proud that they would rather have their ears cut off than the monstrous thing.  I see, I see--but before I open my mouth I will go to my mother.  She knows more than twenty prophets.\"     CHAPTER XII.  Before the sun had risen the next morning, Nemu got himself ferried over the Nile, with the small white ass which Mena's deceased father had given him many years before.  He availed himself of the cool hour which precedes the rising of the sun for his ride through the Necropolis.  Well acquainted as he was with every stock and stone, he avoided the high roads which led to the goal of his expedition, and trotted towards the hill which divides the valley of the royal tombs from the plain of the Nile.  Before him opened a noble amphitheatre of lofty lime-stone peaks, the background of the stately terrace-temple which the proud ancestress of two kings of the fallen family, the great Hatasu, had erected to their memory, and to the Goddess Hathor.  Nemu left the sanctuary to his left, and rode up the steep hill-path which was the nearest way from the plain to the valley of the tombs.  Below him lay a bird's eye view of the terrace-building of Hatasu, and before him, still slumbering in cool dawn, was the Necropolis with its houses and temples and colossal statues, the broad Nile glistening with white sails under the morning mist; and, in the distant east, rosy with the coming sun, stood Thebes and her gigantic temples.  But the dwarf saw nothing of the glorious panorama that lay at his feet; absorbed in thought, and stooping over the neck of his ass, he let the panting beast climb and rest at its pleasure.  When he had reached half the height of the hill, he perceived the sound of footsteps coming nearer and nearer to him.  The vigorous walker had soon reached him, and bid him good morning, which he civilly returned.  The hill-path was narrow, and when Nemu observed that the man who followed him was a priest, he drew up his donkey on a level spot, and said reverently:  \"Pass on, holy father; for thy two feet carry thee quicker than my four.\"  \"A sufferer needs my help,\" replied the leech Nebsecht, Pentaur's friend, whom we have already seen in the House of Seti, and by the bed of the paraschites' daughter; and he hastened on so as to gain on the slow pace of the rider.  Then rose the glowing disk of the sun above the eastern horizon, and from the sanctuaries below the travellers rose up the pious many-voiced chant of praise.  Nemu slipped off his ass, and assumed an attitude of prayer; the priest did the same; but while the dwarf devoutly fixed his eyes on the new birth of the Sun-God from the eastern range, the priest's eyes wandered to the earth, and his raised hand fell to pick up a rare fossil shell which lay on the path.  In a few minutes Nebsecht rose, and Nemu followed him.  \"It is a fine morning,\" said the dwarf; \"the holy fathers down there seem more cheerful to-day than usual.\"  The surgeon laughed assent.  \"Do you belong to the Necropolis?\"  he said. \"Who here keeps dwarfs?\"  \"No one,\" answered the little man.  \"But I will ask thee a question. Who that lives here behind the hill is of so much importance, that a leech from the House of Seti sacrifices his night's rest for him?\"  \"The one I visit is "]]]
