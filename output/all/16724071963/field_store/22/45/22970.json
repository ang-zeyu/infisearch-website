After taking stock of himself and finding that he still had his pistol and ammunition, some matches, a little tobacco, a canteen full of water and a razor, Bradley made himself comfortable upon the mat and was soon asleep, knowing that an attempted escape in the darkness without knowledge of his surroundings would be predoomed to failure.  When he awoke, it was broad daylight, and the sight that met his eyes made him rub them again and again to assure himself that they were really open and that he was not dreaming.  A broad shaft of morning light poured through the open doorway in the ceiling of the room which was about thirty feet square, or roughly square, being irregular in shape, one side curving outward, another being indented by what might have been the corner of another building jutting into it, another alcoved by three sides of an octagon, while the fourth was serpentine in contour.  Two windows let in more daylight, while two doors evidently gave ingress to other rooms.  The walls were partially ceiled with thin strips of wood, nicely fitted and finished, partially plastered and the rest covered with a fine, woven cloth.  Figures of reptiles and beasts were painted without regard to any uniform scheme here and there upon the walls.  A striking feature of the decorations consisted of several engaged columns set into the walls at no regular intervals, the capitals of each supporting a human skull the cranium of which touched the ceiling, as though the latter was supported by these grim reminders either of departed relatives or of some hideous tribal rite--Bradley could not but wonder which.  Yet it was none of these things that filled him with greatest wonder--no, it was the figures of the two creatures that had captured him and brought him hither.  At one end of the room a stout pole about two inches in diameter ran horizontally from wall to wall some six or seven feet from the floor, its ends securely set in two of the columns. Hanging by their knees from this perch, their heads downward and their bodies wrapped in their huge wings, slept the creatures of the night before--like two great, horrid bats they hung, asleep.  As Bradley gazed upon them in wide-eyed astonishment, he saw plainly that all his intelligence, all his acquired knowledge through years of observation and experience were set at naught by the simple evidence of the fact that stood out glaringly before his eyes--the creatures' wings were not mechanical devices but as natural appendages, growing from their shoulderblades, as were their arms and legs.  He saw, too, that except for their wings the pair bore a strong resemblance to human beings, though fashioned in a most grotesque mold.  As he sat gazing at them, one of the two awoke, separated his wings to release his arms that had been folded across his breast, placed his hands upon the floor, dropped his feet and stood erect.  For a moment he stretched his great wings slowly, solemnly blinking his large round eyes.  Then his gaze fell upon Bradley.  The thin lips drew back tightly against yellow teeth in a grimace that was nothing but hideous. It could not have been termed a smile, and what emotion it registered the Englishman was at a loss to guess.  No expression whatever altered the steady gaze of those large, round eyes; there was no color upon the pasty, sunken cheeks.  A death's head grimaced as though a man long dead raised his parchment-covered skull from an old grave.  The creature stood about the height of an average man but appeared much taller from the fact that the joints of his long wings rose fully a foot above his hairless head.  The bare arms were long and sinewy, ending in strong, bony hands with clawlike fingers--almost talonlike in their suggestiveness.  The white robe was separated in front, revealing skinny legs and the further fact that the thing wore but the single garment, which was of fine, woven cloth.  From crown to sole the portions of the body exposed were entirely hairless, and as he noted this, Bradley also noted for the first time the cause of much of the seeming expressionlessness of the creature's countenance--it had neither eye-brows or lashes.  The ears were small and rested flat against the skull, which was noticeably round, though the face was quite flat.  The creature had small feet, beautifully arched and plump, but so out of keeping with every other physical attribute it possessed as to appear ridiculous.  After eyeing Bradley for a moment the thing approached him.  \"Where from?\" it asked.  \"England,\" replied Bradley, as briefly.  \"Where is England and what?\" pursued the questioner.  \"It is a country far from here,\" answered the Englishman.  \"Are your people cor-sva-jo or cos-ata-lu?\"  \"I do not understand you,\" said Bradley; \"and now suppose you answer a few questions.  Who are you?  What country is this?  Why did you bring me here?\"  Again the sepulchral grimace.  \"We are Wieroos--Luata is our father. Caspak is ours.  This, our country, is called Oo-oh.  We brought you here for (literally) Him Who Speaks for Luata to gaze upon and question.  He would know from whence you came and why; but principally if you be cos-ata-lu.\"  \"And if I am not cos--whatever you call the bloomin' beast--what of it?\"  The Wieroo raised his wings in a very human shrug and waved his bony claws toward the human skulls supporting the ceiling.  His gesture was eloquent; but he embellished it by remarking, \"And possibly if you are.\"  \"I'm hungry,\" snapped Bradley.  The Wieroo motioned him to one of the doors which he threw open, permitting Bradley to pass out onto another roof on a level lower than that upon which they had landed earlier in the morning.  By daylight the city appeared even more remarkable than in the moonlight, though less weird and unreal.  The houses of all shapes and sizes were piled about as a child might pile blocks of various forms and colors.  He saw now that there were what might be called streets or alleys, but they ran in baffling turns and twists, nor ever reached a destination, always ending in a dead wall where some Wieroo had built a house across them.  Upon each house was a slender column supporting a human skull. Sometimes the columns were at one corner of the roof, sometimes at another, or again they rose from the center or near the center, and the columns were of varying heights, from that of a man to those which rose twenty feet above their roofs.  The skulls were, as a rule, painted--blue or white, or in combinations of both colors.  The most effective were painted blue with the teeth white and the eye-sockets rimmed with white.  There were other skulls--thousands of them--tens, hundreds of thousands.  They rimmed the eaves of every house, they were set in the plaster of the outer walls and at no great distance from where Bradley stood rose a round tower built entirely of human skulls.  And the city extended in every direction as far as the Englishman could see.  All about him Wieroos were moving across the roofs or winging through the air.  The sad sound of their flapping wings rose and fell like a solemn dirge.  Most of them were appareled all in white, like his captors; but others had markings of red or blue or yellow slashed across the front of their robes.  His guide pointed toward a doorway in an alley below them.  \"Go there and eat,\" he commanded, \"and then come back.  You cannot escape.  If any question you, say that you belong to Fosh-bal-soj.  There is the way.\"  And this time he pointed to the top of a ladder which protruded above the eaves of the roof near-by.  Then he turned and reentered the house.  Bradley looked about him.  No, he could not escape--that seemed evident.  The city appeared interminable, and beyond the city, if not a savage wilderness filled with wild beasts, there was the broad inland sea infested with horrid monsters.  No wonder his captor felt safe in turning him loose in Oo-oh--he wondered if that was the name of the country or the city and if there were other cities like this upon the island.  Slowly he descended the ladder to the seemingly deserted alley which was paved with what appeared to be large, round cobblestones.  He looked again at the smooth, worn pavement, and a rueful grin crossed his features--the alley was paved with skulls.  \"The City of Human Skulls,\" mused Bradley.  \"They must have been collectin' 'em since Adam,\" he thought, and then he crossed and entered the building through the doorway that had been pointed out to him.  Inside he found a large room in which were many Wieroos seated before pedestals the tops of which were hollowed out so that they resembled the ordinary bird drinking- and bathing-fonts so commonly seen on suburban lawns.  A seat protruded from each of the four sides of the pedestals--just a flat board with a support running from its outer end diagonally to the base of the pedestal.  As Bradley entered, some of the Wieroos espied him, and a dismal wail arose.  Whether it was a greeting or a threat, Bradley did not know. Suddenly from a dark alcove another Wieroo rushed out toward him.  \"Who are you?\" he cried.  \"What do you want?\"  \"Fosh-bal-soj sent me here to eat,\" replied Bradley.  \"Do you belong to Fosh-bal-soj?\" asked the other.  \"That appears to be what he thinks,\" answered the Englishman.  \"Are you cos-ata-lu?\" demanded the Wieroo.  \"Give me something to eat or I'll be all of that,\" replied Bradley.  The Wieroo looked puzzled.  \"Sit here, jaal-lu,\" he snapped, and Bradley sat down unconscious of the fact that he had been insulted by being called a hyena-man, an appellation of contempt in Caspak.  The Wieroo had seated him at a pedestal by himself, and as he sat waiting for what was next to transpire, he looked about him at the Wieroo in his immediate vicinity.  He saw that in each font was a quantity of food, and that each Wieroo was armed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/553"],["title","Out of Time's Abyss (#6)"],["body","a wooden skewer, sharpened at one end; with which they carried solid portions of food to their mouths.  At the other end of the skewer was fastened a small clam-shell.  This was used to scoop up the smaller and softer portions of the repast into which all four of the occupants of each table dipped impartially.  The Wieroo leaned far over their food, scooping it up rapidly and with much noise, and so great was their haste that a part of each mouthful always fell back into the common dish; and when they choked, by reason of the rapidity with which they attempted to bolt their food, they often lost it all.  Bradley was glad that he had a pedestal all to himself.  Soon the keeper of the place returned with a wooden bowl filled with food.  This he dumped into Bradley's \"trough,\" as he already thought of it.  The Englishman was glad that he could not see into the dark alcove or know what were all the ingredients that constituted the mess before him, for he was very hungry.  After the first mouthful he cared even less to investigate the antecedents of the dish, for he found it peculiarly palatable.  It seemed to consist of a combination of meat, fruits, vegetables, small fish and other undistinguishable articles of food all seasoned to produce a gastronomic effect that was at once baffling and delicious.  When he had finished, his trough was empty, and then he commenced to wonder who was to settle for his meal.  As he waited for the proprietor to return, he fell to examining the dish from which he had eaten and the pedestal upon which it rested.  The font was of stone worn smooth by long-continued use, the four outer edges hollowed and polished by the contact of the countless Wieroo bodies that had leaned against them for how long a period of time Bradley could not even guess.  Everything about the place carried the impression of hoary age.  The carved pedestals were black with use, the wooden seats were worn hollow, the floor of stone slabs was polished by the contact of possibly millions of naked feet and worn away in the aisles between the pedestals so that the latter rested upon little mounds of stone several inches above the general level of the floor.  Finally, seeing that no one came to collect, Bradley arose and started for the doorway.  He had covered half the distance when he heard the voice of mine host calling to him:  \"Come back, jaal-lu,\" screamed the Wieroo; and Bradley did as he was bid.  As he approached the creature which stood now behind a large, flat-topped pedestal beside the alcove, he saw lying upon the smooth surface something that almost elicited a gasp of astonishment from him--a simple, common thing it was, or would have been almost anywhere in the world but Caspak--a square bit of paper!  And on it, in a fine hand, written compactly, were many strange hieroglyphics!  These remarkable creatures, then, had a written as well as a spoken language and besides the art of weaving cloth possessed that of paper-making.  Could it be that such grotesque beings represented the high culture of the human race within the boundaries of Caspak?  Had natural selection produced during the countless ages of Caspakian life a winged monstrosity that represented the earthly pinnacle of man's evolution?  Bradley had noted something of the obvious indications of a gradual evolution from ape to spearman as exemplified by the several overlapping races of Alalus, club-men and hatchet-men that formed the connecting links between the two extremes with which he, had come in contact.  He had heard of the Krolus and the Galus--reputed to be still higher in the plane of evolution--and now he had indisputable evidence of a race possessing refinements of civilization eons in advance of the spear-men.  The conjectures awakened by even a momentary consideration of the possibilities involved became at once as wildly bizarre as the insane imaginings of a drug addict.  As these thoughts flashed through his mind, the Wieroo held out a pen of bone fixed to a wooden holder and at the same time made a sign that Bradley was to write upon the paper.  It was difficult to judge from the expressionless features of the Wieroo what was passing in the creature's mind, but Bradley could not but feel that the thing cast a supercilious glance upon him as much as to say, \"Of course you do not know how to write, you poor, low creature; but you can make your mark.\"  Bradley seized the pen and in a clear, bold hand wrote:  \"John Bradley, England.\"  The Wieroo showed evidences of consternation as it seized the piece of paper and examined the writing with every mark of incredulity and surprise.  Of course it could make nothing of the strange characters; but it evidently accepted them as proof that Bradley possessed knowledge of a written language of his own, for following the Englishman's entry it made a few characters of its own.  \"You will come here again just before Lua hides his face behind the great cliff,\" announced the creature, \"unless before that you are summoned by Him Who Speaks for Luata, in which case you will not have to eat any more.\"  \"Reassuring cuss,\" thought Bradley as he turned and left the building.  Outside were several Wieroos that had been eating at the pedestals within.  They immediately surrounded him, asking all sorts of questions, plucking at his garments, his ammunition-belt and his pistol.  Their demeanor was entirely different from what it had been within the eating-place and Bradley was to learn that a house of food was sanctuary for him, since the stern laws of the Wieroos forbade altercations within such walls.  Now they were rough and threatening, as with wings half spread they hovered about him in menacing attitudes, barring his way to the ladder leading to the roof from whence he had descended; but the Englishman was not one to brook interference for long.  He attempted at first to push his way past them, and then when one seized his arm and jerked him roughly back, Bradley swung upon the creature and with a heavy blow to the jaw felled it.  Instantly pandemonium reigned.  Loud wails arose, great wings opened and closed with a loud, beating noise and many clawlike hands reached forth to clutch him.  Bradley struck to right and left.  He dared not use his pistol for fear that once they discovered its power he would be overcome by weight of numbers and relieved of possession of what he considered his trump card, to be reserved until the last moment that it might be used to aid in his escape, for already the Englishman was planning, though almost hopelessly, such an attempt.  A few blows convinced Bradley that the Wieroos were arrant cowards and that they bore no weapons, for after two or three had fallen beneath his fists the others formed a circle about him, but at a safe distance and contented themselves with threatening and blustering, while those whom he had felled lay upon the pavement without trying to arise, the while they moaned and wailed in lugubrious chorus.  Again Bradley strode toward the ladder, and this time the circle parted before him; but no sooner had he ascended a few rungs than he was seized by one foot and an effort made to drag him down.  With a quick backward glance the Englishman, clinging firmly to the ladder with both hands, drew up his free foot and with all the strength of a powerful leg, planted a heavy shoe squarely in the flat face of the Wieroo that held him.  Shrieking horribly, the creature clapped both hands to its face and sank to the ground while Bradley clambered quickly the remaining distance to the roof, though no sooner did he reach the top of the ladder than a great flapping of wings beneath him warned him that the Wieroos were rising after him.  A moment later they swarmed about his head as he ran for the apartment in which he had spent the early hours of the morning after his arrival.  It was but a short distance from the top of the ladder to the doorway, and Bradley had almost reached his goal when the door flew open and Fosh-bal-soj stepped out.  Immediately the pursuing Wieroos demanded punishment of the jaal-lu who had so grievously maltreated them. Fosh-bal-soj listened to their complaints and then with a sudden sweep of his right hand seized Bradley by the scruff of the neck and hurled him sprawling through the doorway upon the floor of the chamber.  So sudden was the assault and so surprising the strength of the Wieroo that the Englishman was taken completely off his guard.  When he arose, the door was closed, and Fosh-bal-soj was standing over him, his hideous face contorted into an expression of rage and hatred.  \"Hyena, snake, lizard!\" he screamed.  \"You would dare lay your low, vile, profaning hands upon even the lowliest of the Wieroos--the sacred chosen of Luata!\"  Bradley was mad, and so he spoke in a very low, calm voice while a half-smile played across his lips but his cold, gray eyes were unsmiling.  \"What you did to me just now,\" he said, \"--I am going to kill you for that,\" and even as he spoke, he launched himself at the throat of Fosh-bal-soj.  The other Wieroo that had been asleep when Bradley left the chamber had departed, and the two were alone.  Fosh-bal-soj displayed little of the cowardice of those that had attacked Bradley in the alleyway, but that may have been because he had so slight opportunity, for Bradley had him by the throat before he could utter a cry and with his right hand struck him heavily and repeatedly upon his face and over his heart--ugly, smashing, short-arm jabs of the sort that take the fight out of a man in quick time.  But Fosh-bal-soj was of no mind to die passively.  He clawed and struck at Bradley while with his great wings he attempted to shield himself from the merciless rain of blows, at the same time searching for a hold upon his antagonist's throat.  Presently he succeeded in tripping the Englishman, and together the two fell heavily to the floor, Bradley underneath, and at the same instant the Wieroo fastened"]]]
