You may remember that the Judge was a close friend of her father's before the war. And--well, they quarrelled, sir. The Colonel went South, you know.\"  \"When--when was the Judge taken ill, Mr. Brinsmade?\" Stephen asked. The thought of Virginia and his mother caring for him together was strangely sweet.  \"Two days before I left, sir, Dr. Polk had warned him not to do so much. But the Doctor tells me that he can see no dangerous symptoms.\"  Stephen inquired now of Mr. Brinsmade how long he was to be with them.  \"I am going on to the other camps this afternoon,\" said he. \"But I should like a glimpse of your quarters, Stephen, if you will invite me. Your mother would like a careful account of you, and Mr. Whipple, and--your many friends in St. Louis.\"  \"You will find my tent a little wet, air,\" replied Stephen, touched.  Here the General, who had been sitting by watching them with a very curious expression, spoke up.  \"That's hospitality for you, Brinsmade!\"  Stephen and Mr. Brinsmade made their way across plank and bridge to Stephen's tent, and his mess servant arrived in due time with the package from home. But presently, while they sat talking of many things, the canvas of the fly was thrust back with a quick movement, and who should come stooping in but General Sherman himself. He sat down on a cracker box. Stephen rose confusedly.  \"Well, well, Brice,\" said the General, winking at Mr. Brinsmade, \"I think you might have invited me to the feast. Where are those cigars Mr. Brinsmade was talking about?\"  Stephen opened the box with alacrity. The General chose one and lighted it.  \"Don't smoke, eh?\" he inquired. \"Why, yes, sir, when I can.\"  \"Then light up, sir,\" said the General, \"and sit down, I've been thinking lately of court-martialing you, but I decided to come 'round and talk it over with you first. That isn't strictly according to the rules of the service. Look here, Mr. Brice, why did you leave St. Louis?\"  \"They began to draft, sir, and I couldn't stand it any longer.\"  \"But you wouldn't have been drafted. You were in the Home Guards, if I remember right. And Mr. Brinsmade tells me you were useful in many ways What was your rank in the Home Guards?\"  \"Lieutenant colonel, sir.\"  \"And what are you here?\"  \"A second lieutenant in temporary command, General.\"  \"You have commanded men?\"  \"Not in action, sir. I felt that that was different.\"  \"Couldn't they do better for you than a second-lieutenancy?\"  Stephen did not reply at once, Mr. Brinsmade spoke up, \"They offered him a lieutenant-colonelcy.\"  The General was silent a moment: Then he said \"Do you remember meeting me on the boat when I was leaving St. Louis, after the capture of Fort Henry?\"  Stephen smiled. \"Very well, General,\" he replied, General Sherman leaned forward.  \"And do you remember I said to you, 'Brice, when you get ready to come into this war, let me know.' Why didn't you do it?\"  Stephen thought a minute. Then he said gravely, but with just a suspicion of humor about his mouth:-- \"General, if I had done that, you wouldn't be here in my tent to-day.\"  Like lightning the General was on his feet, his hand on Stephen's shoulder.  \"By gad, sir,\" he cried, delighted, \"so I wouldn't.\"     CHAPTER VIII  A STRANGE MEETING  The story of the capture of Vicksburg is the old, old story of failure turned into success, by which man is made immortal. It involves the history of a general who never retraced his steps, who cared neither for mugwump murmurs nor political cabals, who took both blame and praise with equanimity. Through month after month of discouragement, and work gone for naught, and fever and death, his eyes never left his goal. And by grace of the wisdom of that President who himself knew sorrow and suffering and defeat and unjust censure, General Grant won.  Boldness did it. The canal abandoned, one red night fleet and transports swept around the bend and passed the city's heights, on a red river. The Parrotts and the Dahlgrens roared, and the high bluffs flung out the sound over the empty swamp land.  Then there came the landing below, and the cutting loose from a base --unheard of. Corps behind cursed corps ahead for sweeping the country clear of forage. Battles were fought. Confederate generals in Mississippi were bewildered.  One night, while crossing with his regiment a pontoon bridge, Stephen Brice heard a shout raised on the farther shore. Sitting together on a log under a torch, two men in slouch hats were silhouetted. That one talking with rapid gestures was General Sherman. The impassive profile of the other, the close-cropped beard and the firmly held cigar that seemed to go with it,--Stephen recognized as that of the strange Captain Grant who had stood beside him in the street by the Arsenal He had not changed a whit. Motionless, he watched corps after corps splash by, artillery, cavalry, and infantry, nor gave any sign that he heard their plaudits.  At length the army came up behind the city to a place primeval, where the face of the earth was sore and tortured, worn into deep gorges by the rains, and flung up in great mounds. Stripped of the green magnolias and the cane, the banks of clay stood forth in hideous yellow nakedness, save for a lonely stunted growth, or a bare trunk that still stood tottering on the edge of a banks its pitiful withered roots reaching out below. The May weather was already sickly hot.  First of all there was a murderous assault, and a still more murderous repulse. Three times the besiegers charged, sank their color staffs into the redoubts, and three times were driven back. Then the blue army settled into the earth and folded into the ravines. Three days in that narrow space between the lines lay the dead and wounded suffering untold agonies in the moist heat. Then came a truce to bury the dead, to bring back what was left of the living.  The doomed city had no rest. Like clockwork from the Mississippi's banks beyond came the boom and shriek of the coehorns on the barges. The big shells hung for an instant in the air like birds of prey, and then could be seen swooping down here and there, while now and anon a shaft of smoke rose straight to the sky, the black monument of a home.  Here was work in the trenches, digging the flying sap by night and deepening it by day, for officers and men alike. From heaven a host of blue ants could be seen toiling in zigzags forward, ever forward, along the rude water-cuts and through the hills. A waiting carrion from her vantage point on high marked one spot then another where the blue ants disappeared, and again one by one came out of the burrow to hurry down the trench,--each with his ball of clay.  In due time the ring of metal and sepulchred voices rumbled in the ground beneath the besieged. Counter mines were started, and through the narrow walls of earth commands and curses came. Above ground the saps were so near that a strange converse became the rule. It was \"Hello, Reb!\" \"Howdy, Yank!\" Both sides were starving, the one for tobacco and the other for hardtack and bacon. These necessities were tossed across, sometimes wrapped in the Vicksburg news-sheet printed on the white side of a homely green wall paper. At other times other amenities were indulged in. Hand-grenades were thrown and shells with lighted fuses rolled down on the heads of acquaintances of the night before, who replied from wooden coehorns hooped with iron.  The Union generals learned (common item in a siege) that the citizens of Vicksburg were eating mule meat. Not an officer or private in the Vicksburg armies who does not remember the 25th of June, and the hour of three in an afternoon of pitiless heat. Silently the long blue files wound into position behind the earth barriers which hid them from the enemy, coiled and ready to strike when the towering redoubt on the Jackson road should rise heavenwards. By common consent the rifle crack of day and night was hushed, and even the Parrotts were silent. Stillness closed around the white house of Shirley once more, but not the stillness it had known in its peaceful homestead days. This was the stillness of the death prayer. Eyes staring at the big redoubt were dimmed. At last, to those near, a little wisp of blue smoke crept out.  Then the earth opened with a quake. The sun was darkened, and a hot blast fanned the upturned faces. In the sky, through the film of shattered clay, little black dots scurried, poised, and fell again as arms and legs and head less trunks and shapeless bits of wood and iron. Scarcely had the dust settled when the sun caught the light of fifty thousand bayonets, and a hundred shells were shrieking across the crater's edge. Earth to earth, alas, and dust to dust! Men who ran across that rim of a summer's after-noon died in torture under tier upon tier of their comrades,--and so the hole was filled.  An upright cannon marks the spot where a scrawny oak once stood on a scarred and baked hillside, outside of the Confederate lines at Vicksburg. Under the scanty shade of that tree, on the eve of the Nation's birthday, stood two men who typified the future and the past. As at Donelson, a trick of Fortune's had delivered one comrade of old into the hands of another. Now she chose to kiss the one upon whom she had heaped obscurity and poverty and contumely. He had ceased to think or care about Fortune. And hence, being born a woman, she favored him.  The two armies watched and were still. They noted the friendly greeting of old comrades, and after that they saw the self-contained Northerner biting his cigar, as one to whom the pleasantries of life were past and gone. The South saw her General turn on his heel. The bitterness of his life was come. Both sides honored him for the fight he had made. But war does not reward a man according to his deserts.

See the gray regiments marching silently in the tropic heat into the folds of that blue army whose grip has choked them at last. Silently, too, the blue coats stand, pity and admiration on the brick-red faces. The arms are stacked and surrendered, officers and men are to be parolled when the counting is finished. The formations melt away, and those who for months have sought each other's lives are grouped in friendly talk. The coarse army bread is drawn eagerly from the knapsacks of the blue, smoke quivers above a hundred fires, and the smell of frying bacon brings a wistful look into the gaunt faces. Tears stand in the eyes of many a man as he eats the food his Yankee brothers have given him on the birthday of their country.  Within the city it is the same. Stephen Brice, now a captain in General Lauman's brigade, sees with thanksgiving the stars and stripes flutter from the dome of that court-house which he had so long watched from afar.  Later on, down a side street, he pauses before a house with its face blown away. On the verge of one of its jagged floors is an old four-posted bed, and beside it a child's cot is standing pitifully,--the tiny pillow still at the head and the little sheets thrown across the foot. So much for one of the navy's shells.  While he was thinking of the sadness of it all, a little scene was acted: the side door of the house opened, a weeping woman came out, and with her was a tall Confederate Colonel of cavalry. Gallantly giving her his arm, he escorted her as far as the little gate, where she bade him good by with much feeling. With an impulsive movement he drew some money from his pocket, thrust it upon her, and started hurriedly away that he might not listen to her thanks. Such was his preoccupation that he actually brushed into Stephen, who was standing beside a tree. He stopped and bowed.  \"Excuse me, seh,\" he said contritely. \"I beg your pardon, seh.\"  \"Certainly,\" said Stephen, smiling; it was my fault for getting in your way.\"  \"Not at all, seh,\" said the cavalry Colonel; \"my clumsiness, seh.\" He did not pass on, but stood pulling with some violence a very long mustache. \"Damn you Yankees,\" he continued, in the same amiable tone, \"you've brought us a heap of misfortune. Why, seh, in another week we'd been fo'ced to eat niggers.\"  The Colonel made such a wry face that Stephen laughed in spite of himself. He had marked the man's charitable action, and admired his attempt to cover it. The Colonel seemed to be all breadth, like a card. His shoulders were incredible. The face was scant, perchance from lack of food, the nose large, with a curved rim, and the eyes blue gray. He wore clay-flecked cavalry boots, and was six feet five if an inch, so that Stephen's six seemed insignificant beside him.  \"Captain,\" he said, taking in Stephen's rank, \"so we won't qua'l as to who's host heah. One thing's suah,\" he added, with a twinkle, \"I've been heah longest. Seems like ten yeahs since I saw the wife and children down in the Palmetto State. I can't offer you a dinner, seh. We've eaten all the mules and rats and sugar cane in town.\" (His eye seemed to interpolate that Stephen wouldn't be there otherwise.) \"But I can offer you something choicer than you have in the No'th.\"  Whereupon he drew from his hip a dented silver flask. The Colonel remarked that Stephen's eyes fell on the coat of arms.  \"Prope'ty of my grandfather, seh, of Washington's Army. My name is Jennison,--Catesby Jennison, at your service, seh,\" he said. \"You have the advantage of me, Captain.\"  \"My name is Brice,\" said Stephen.  The big Colonel bowed decorously, held out a great, wide hand, and thereupon unscrewed the flask. Now Stephen had never learned to like straight whiskey, but he took down his share without a face. The exploit seemed to please the Colonel, who, after he likewise had done the liquor justice, screwed on the lid with ceremony, offered Stephen his arm with still greater ceremony, and they walked off down the street together. Stephen drew from his pocket several of Judge Whipple's cigars, to which his new friend gave unqualified praise.  On every hand Vicksburg showed signs of hard usage. Houses with gaping chasms in their sides, others mere heaps of black ruins; great trees felled, cabins demolished, and here and there the sidewalk ploughed across from curb to fence.  \"Lordy,\" exclaimed the Colonel. \"Lordy I how my ears ache since your damned coehorns have stopped. The noise got to be silence with us, seh, and yesterday I reckoned a hundred volcanoes had bust. Tell me,\" said he \"when the redoubt over the Jackson road was blown up, they said a nigger came down in your lines alive. Is that so?\"  \"Yes,\" said Stephen, smiling; \"he struck near the place where my company was stationed. His head ached a mite. That seemed to be all.\"  \"I reckon he fell on it,\" said Colonel Catesby Jennison, as if it were a matter of no special note.  \"And now tell me something,\" said Stephen. \"How did you burn our sap-rollers?\"  This time the Colonel stopped, and gave himself up to hearty laughter.  \"Why, that was a Yankee trick, sure enough,\" he cried. \"Some ingenious cuss soaked port fire in turpentine, and shot the wad in a large-bore musket.\"  \"We thought you used explosive bullets.\"  The Colonel laughed again, still more heartily. \"Explosive bullets! --Good Lord, it was all we could do to get percussion caps. Do you know how we got percussion caps, seh? Three of our officers--dare-devils, seh --floated down the Mississippi on logs. One fellow made his way back with two hundred thousand. He's the pride of our Vicksburg army. Not afraid of hell. A chivalrous man, a forlorn-hope man. The night you ran the batteries he and some others went across to your side in skiffs--in skiffs, seh, I say--and set fire to the houses in De Soto, that we might see to shoot. And then he came back in the face of our own batteries and your guns. That man was wounded by a trick of fate, by a cussed bit of shell from your coehorns while eating his dinner in Vicksburg. He's pretty low, now, poor fellow,\" added the Colonel, sadly.  \"Where is he?\" demanded Stephen, fired with a desire to see the man.  \"Well, he ain't a great ways from here,\" said the Colonel. \"Perhaps you might be able to do something for him,\" he continued thoughtfully. \"I'd hate to see him die. The doctor says he'll pull through if he can get care and good air and good food.\" He seized Stephen's arm in a fierce grip. \"You ain't fooling?\" he said.  \"Indeed I am not,\" said Stephen.  \"No,\" said the Colonel, thoughtfully, as to himself, \"you don't look like the man to fool.\"  Whereupon he set out with great strides, in marked contrast to his former languorous gait, and after a while they came to a sort of gorge, where the street ran between high banks of clay. There Stephen saw the magazines which the Confederates had dug out, and of which he had heard. But he saw something, too, of which he had not heard, Colonel Catesby Jennison stopped before an open doorway in the yellow bank and knocked. A woman's voice called softly to him to enter.  They went into a room hewn out of the solid clay. Carpet was stretched on the floor, paper was on the walls, and even a picture. There was a little window cut like a port in a prison cell, and under it a bed, beside which a middle-aged lady was seated. She had a kindly face which seemed to Stephen a little pinched as she turned to them with a gesture of restraint. She pointed to the bed, where a sheet lay limply over the angles of a wasted frame. The face was to the wall.  \"Hush!\" said the lady,--\"it is the first time in two days that he has slept.\"  But the sleeper stirred wearily, and woke with a start. He turned over. The face, so yellow and peaked, was of the type that grows even more handsome in sickness, and in the great fever-stricken eyes a high spirit burned. For an instant only the man stared at Stephen, and then he dragged himself to the wall.  The eyes of the other two were both fixed on the young Union Captain.  \"My God!\" cried Jennison, seizing Stephen's rigid arm, \"does he look as bad as that? We've seen him every day.\"  \"I--I know him,\" answered Stephen. He stepped quickly to the bedside, and bent over it. \"Colfax!\" he said. \"Colfax!\"  \"This is too much, Jennison,\" came from the bed a voice that was pitifully weak; \"why do you bring Yankees in here?\"  \"Captain Brice is a friend of yours, Colfax,\" said the Colonel, tugging at his mustache.  \"Brice?\" repeated Clarence, \"Brice? Does he come from St. Louis?\"  \"Do you come from St. Louis, sir?\"  \"Yes. I have met Captain Colfax--\"  \"Colonel, sir.\"  \"Colonel Colfax, before the war! And if he would like to go to St. Louis, I think I can have it arranged at once.\"  In silence they waited for Clarence's answer Stephen well knew what was passing in his mind, and guessed at his repugnance to accept a favor from a Yankee. He wondered whether there was in this case a special detestation. And so his mind was carried far to the northward to the memory of that day in the summer-house on the Meramee heights. Virginia had not loved her cousin then--of that Stephen was sure. But now,--now that the Vicksburg army was ringing with his praise, now that he was unfortunate--Stephen sighed. His comfort was that he would be the instrument.  The lady in her uneasiness smoothed the single sheen that covered the sick man. From afar came the sound of cheering, and it was this that seemed to rouse him. He faced them again, impatiently.  \"I have reason to remember Mr. Brice,\" he said steadily. And then, with some vehemence, \"What is he doing in Vicksburg?\"  Stephen looked at Jennison, who winced.  \"The city has surrendered,\" said that officer.  They counted on a burst of anger. Colfax only groaned.  \"Then you can afford to be generous,\" he said, with a bitter laugh. \"But you haven't whipped us yet, by a good deal. Jennison,\" he cried, \"Jennison"]]]
