The captain of the whip-bearers went up to their commander, and, seconded by the shouts of the crowd, begged him to escort the stranger to the palace.  During this colloquy the traveller had mounted his servant's horse, and now followed in the wake of the Persians.  The good news flew like wind through the huge city.  As the riders proceeded, the crowd fell back more willingly, and loader and fuller grew the shouts of joy until at last their march was like a triumphal procession.  In a few minutes they drew up before the palace; but before the brazen gates had opened to admit them, another train came slowly into sight.  At the head rode a grey-headed old man; his robes were brown, and rent, in token of mourning, the mane and tail of his horse had been shorn off and the creature colored blue.--It was Hystaspes, coming to entreat mercy for his son.  The whip-bearer, delighted at this sight, threw himself down before the old man with a cry of joy, and with crossed arms told him what confidence the traveller had inspired him with.  Hystaspes beckoned to the stranger; he rode up, bowed gracefully and courteously to the old man, without dismounting, and confirmed the words of the whip bearer.  Hystaspes seemed to feel fresh confidence too after hearing the stranger, for he begged him to follow him into the palace and to wait outside the door of the royal apartment, while he himself, conducted by the head chamberlain, went in to the king.  When his old kinsman entered, Cambyses was lying on his purple couch, pale as death.  A cup-bearer was kneeling on the ground at his feet, trying to collect the broken fragments of a costly Egyptian drinking-cup which the king had thrown down impatiently because its contents had not pleased his taste.  At some distance stood a circle of court-officials, in whose faces it was easy to read that they were afraid of their ruler's wrath, and preferred keeping as far from him as possible.  The dazzling light and oppressive heat of a Babylonian May day came in through the open windows, and not a sound was to be heard in the great room, except the whining of a large dog of the Epirote breed, which had just received a tremendous kick from Cambyses for venturing to fawn on his master, and was the only being that ventured to disturb the solemn stillness.  Just before Hystaspes was led in by the chamberlain, Cambyses had sprung up from his couch.  This idle repose had become unendurable, he felt suffocated with pain and anger.  The dog's howl suggested a new idea to his poor tortured brain, thirsting for forgetfulness.  \"We will go out hunting!\"  he shouted to the poor startled courtiers. The master of the hounds, the equerries, and huntsmen hastened to obey his orders.  He called after them, \"I shall ride the unbroken horse Reksch; get the falcons ready, let all the dogs out and order every one to come, who can throw a spear.  We'll clear the preserves!\"  He then threw himself down on his divan again, as if these words had quite exhausted his powerful frame, and did not see that Hystaspes had entered, for his sullen gaze was fixed on the motes playing in the sunbeams that glanced through the window.  Hystaspes did not dare to address him; but he stationed himself in the window so as to break the stream of motes and thus draw attention to himself.  At first Cambyses looked angrily at him and his rent garments, and then asked with a bitter smile; \"What do you want?\"  \"Victory to the king!  Your poor servant and uncle has come to entreat his ruler's mercy.\"  \"Then rise and go!  You know that I have no mercy for perjurers and false swearers.  'Tis better to have a dead son than a dishonorable one.\"  \"But if Bartja should not be guilty, and Darius .  .  .\"  \"You dare to question the justice of my sentence?\"  \"That be far from me.  Whatever the king does is good, and cannot be gainsaid; but still .  .  .\"  \"Be silent!  I will not hear the subject mentioned again.  You are to be pitied as a father; but have these last few hours brought me any joy? Old man, I grieve for you, but I have as little power to rescind his punishment as you to recall his crime.\"  \"But if Bartja really should not be guilty--if the gods .  .  .\"  \"Do you think the gods will come to the help of perjurers and deceivers?\"  \"No, my King; but a fresh witness has appeared.\"  \"A fresh witness?  Verily, I would gladly give half my kingdom, to be convinced of the innocence of men so nearly related to me.\"  \"Victory to my lord, the eye of the realm!  A Greek is waiting outside, who seems, to judge by his figure and bearing, one of the noblest of his race.\"  The king laughed bitterly: \"A Greek!  Ah, ha!  perhaps some relation to Bartja's faithful fair one!  What can this stranger know of my family affairs?  I know these beggarly Ionians well.  They are impudent enough to meddle in everything, and think they can cheat us with their sly tricks.  How much have you had to pay for this new witness, uncle?  A Greek is as ready with a lie as a Magian with his spells, and I know they'll do anything for gold.  I'm really curious to see your witness. Call him in.  But if he wants to deceive me, he had better remember that where the head of a son of Cyrus is about to fall, a Greek head has but very little chance.\"  And the king's eyes flashed with anger as he said these words.  Hystaspes, however, sent for the Greek.  Before he entered, the chamberlains fastened the usual cloth before his mouth, and commanded him to cast himself on the ground before the king. The Greek's bearing, as he approached, under the king's penetrating glance, was calm and noble; he fell on his face, and, according to the Persian custom, kissed the ground.  His agreeable and handsome appearance, and the calm and modest manner in which he bore the king's gaze, seemed to make a favorable impression on the latter; he did not allow him to remain long on the earth, and asked him in a by no means unfriendly tone: \"Who are you?\"  \"I am a Greek nobleman.  My name is Phanes, and Athens is my home.  I have served ten years as commander of the Greek mercenaries in Egypt, and not ingloriously.\"  \"Are you the man, to whose clever generalship the Egyptians were indebted for their victories in Cyprus?\"  \"I am.\"  \"What has brought you to Persia?\"  \"The glory of your name, Cambyses, and the wish to devote my arms and experience to your service.\"  \"Nothing else?  Be sincere, and remember that one single lie may cost your life.  We Persians have different ideas of truth from the Greeks.\"  \"Lying is hateful to me too, if only, because, as a distortion and corruption of what is noblest, it seems unsightly in my eyes.\"  \"Then speak.\"  \"There was certainly a third reason for my coming hither, which I should like to tell you later.  It has reference to matters of the greatest importance, which it will require a longer time to discuss; but to-day--\"  \"Just to-day I should like to hear something new.  Accompany me to the chase.  You come exactly at the right time, for I never had more need of diversion than now.\"  \"I will accompany you with pleasure, if.  .  .\"  \"No conditions to the king!  Have you had much practice in hunting?\"  \"In the Libyan desert I have killed many a lion.\"  \"Then come, follow me.\"  In the thought of the chase the king seemed to have thrown off all his weakness and roused himself to action; he was just leaving the hall, when Hystaspes once more threw himself at his feet, crying with up-raised hands: \"Is my son--is your brother, to die innocent?  By the soul of your father, who used to call me his truest friend, I conjure you to listen to this noble stranger.\"  Cambyses stood still.  The frown gathered on his brow again, his voice sounded like a menace and his eyes flashed as he raised his hand and said to the Greek: \"Tell me what you know; but remember that in every untrue word, you utter your own sentence of death.\"  Phanes heard this threat with the greatest calmness, and answered, bowing gracefully as he spoke: \"From the sun and from my lord the king, nothing can be hid.  What power has a poor mortal to conceal the truth from one so mighty?  The noble Hystaspes has said, that I am able to prove your brother innocent.  I will only say, that I wish and hope I may succeed in accomplishing anything so great and beautiful.  The gods have at least allowed me to discover a trace which seems calculated to throw light on the events of yesterday; but you yourself must decide whether my hopes have been presumptuous and my suspicions too easily aroused.  Remember, however, that throughout, my wish to serve you has been sincere, and that if I have been deceived, my error is pardonable; that nothing is perfectly certain in this world, and every man believes that to be infallible which seems to him the most probable.\"  \"You speak well, and remind me of .  .  .  curse her! there, speak and have done with it!  I hear the dogs already in the court.\"  \"I was still in Egypt when your embassy came to fetch Nitetis.  At the house of Rhodopis, my delightful, clever and celebrated countrywoman, I made the acquaintance of Croesus and his son; I only saw your brother and his friends once or twice, casually; still I remembered the young prince's handsome face so well, that some time later, when I was in the workshop of the great sculptor Theodorus at Samos, I recognized his features at once.\"  \"Did you meet him at Samos?\"  \"No, but his features had made such a deep and faithful impression on Theodorus' memory, that he used them to beautify the head of an Apollo, which the Achaemenidae had ordered for the new temple of Delphi.\"  \"Your tale begins, at least, incredibly enough.  How is it possible to copy features so exactly, when you have not got them before you?\"  \"I can only answer that Theodorus has really completed this master-piece, and if you wish for a proof of his skill would gladly send you a second likeness of .  .  .\"  \"I have no desire for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5456"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 07 (#2)"],["body",".  Go on with your story.\"  \"On my journey hither, which, thanks to your father's excellent arrangements, I performed in an incredibly short time, changing horses every sixteen or seventeen miles .  .  .\"  \"Who allowed you, a foreigner, to use the posthorses?\"  \"The pass drawn out for the son of Croesus, which came by chance into my hands, when once, in order to save my life, he forced me to change clothes with him.\"  \"A Lydian can outwit a fox, and a Syrian a Lydian, but an Ionian is a match for both,\" muttered the king, smiling for the first time; \"Croesus told me this story--poor Croesus!\"  and then the old gloomy expression came over his face and he passed his hand across his forehead, as if trying to smooth the lines of care away.  The Athenian went on: \"I met with no hindrances on my journey till this morning at the first hour after midnight, when I was detained by a strange occurrence.\"  The king began to listen more attentively, and reminded the Athenian, who spoke Persian with difficulty, that there was no time to lose.  \"We had reached the last station but one,\" continued he, \"and hoped to be in Babylon by sunrise.  I was thinking over my past stirring life, and was so haunted by the remembrance of evil deeds unrevenged that I could not sleep; the old Egyptian at my side, however, slept and dreamt peacefully enough, lulled by the monotonous tones of the harness bells, the sound of the horses' hoofs and the murmur of the Euphrates.  It was a wonderfully still, beautiful night; the moon and stars were so brilliant, that our road and the landscape were lighted up almost with the brightness of day.  For the last hour we had not seen a single vehicle, foot-passenger, or horseman; we had heard that all the neighboring population had assembled in Babylon to celebrate your birthday, gaze with wonder at the splendor of your court, and enjoy your liberality.  At last the irregular beat of horses' hoofs, and the sound of bells struck my ear, and a few minutes later I distinctly heard cries of distress.  My resolve was taken at once; I made my Persian servant dismount, sprang into his saddle, told the driver of the cart in which my slaves were sitting not to spare his mules, loosened my dagger and sword in their scabbards, and spurred my horse towards the place from whence the cries came.  They grew louder and louder.  I had not ridden a minute, when I came on a fearful scene.  Three wild-looking fellows had just pulled a youth, dressed in the white robes of a Magian, from his horse, stunned him with heavy blows, and, just as I reached them, were on the point of throwing him into the Euphrates, which at that place washes the roots of the palms and fig-trees bordering the high-road.  I uttered my Greek war-cry, which has made many an enemy tremble before now, and rushed on the murderers.  Such fellows are always cowards; the moment they saw one of their accomplices mortally wounded, they fled.  I did not pursue them, but stooped down to examine the poor boy, who was severely wounded.  How can I describe my horror at seeing, as I believed, your brother Bartja? Yes, they were the very same features that I had seen, first at Naukratis and then in Theodorus' workshop, they were .  .  .\"  \"Marvellous!\"  interrupted Hystaspes.  \"Perhaps a little too much so to be credible,\" added the king.  \"Take care, Hellene! remember my arm reaches far.  I shall have the truth of your story put to the proof.\"  \"I am accustomed,\" answered Phanes bowing low, \"to follow the advice of our wise philosopher Pythagoras, whose fame may perhaps have reached your ears, and always, before speaking, to consider whether what I am going to say may not cause me sorrow in the future.\"  \"That sounds well; but, by Mithras, I knew some one who often spoke of that great teacher, and yet in her deeds turned out to be a most faithful disciple of Angramainjus.  You know the traitress, whom we are going to extirpate from the earth like a poisonous viper to-day.\"  \"Will you forgive me,\" answered Phanes, seeing the anguish expressed in the king's features, \"if I quote another of the great master's maxims?\"  \"Speak.\"  \"Blessings go as quickly as they come.  Therefore bear thy lot patiently. Murmur not, and remember that the gods never lay a heavier weight on any man than he can bear.  Hast thou a wounded heart? touch it as seldom as thou wouldst a sore eye.  There are only two remedies for heart- sickness:--hope and patience.\"  Cambyses listened to this sentence, borrowed from the golden maxims of Pythagoras, and smiled bitterly at the word \"patience.\"  Still the Athenian's way of speaking pleased him, and he told him to go on with his story.  Phanes made another deep obeisance, and continued: \"We carried the unconscious youth to my carriage, and brought him to the nearest station. There he opened his eyes, looked anxiously at me, and asked who I was and what had happened to him?  The master of the station was standing by, so I was obliged to give the name of Gyges in order not to excite his suspicions by belying my pass, as it was only through this that I could obtain fresh horses.  \"This wounded young man seemed to know Gyges, for he shook his head and murmured: 'You are not the man you give yourself out for.' Then he closed his eyes again, and a violent attack of fever came on.  \"We undressed, bled him and bound up his wounds.  My Persian servant, who had served as overlooker in Amasis' stables and had seen Bartja there, assisted by the old Egyptian who accompanied me, was very helpful, and asserted untiringly that the wounded man could be no other than your brother.  When we had cleansed the blood from his face, the master of the station too swore that there could be no doubt of his being the younger son of your great father Cyrus.  Meanwhile my Egyptian companion had fetched a potion from the travelling medicine-chest, without which an Egyptian does not care to leave his native country.       [A similar travelling medicine-chest is to be seen in the Egyptian      Museum at Berlin.  It is prettily and compendiously fitted up, and      must be very ancient, for the inscription on the chest, which      contained it stated that it was made in the 11th dynasty (end of the      third century B. C.) in the reign of King Mentuhotep.]  The drops worked wonders; in a few hours the fever was quieted, and at sunrise the patient opened his eyes once more.  We bowed down before him, believing him to be your brother, and asked if he would like to be taken to the palace in Babylon.  This he refused vehemently, and asseverated that he was not the man we took him for, but, .  .  .\"  \"Who can be so like Bartja? tell me quickly,\" interrupted the king, \"I am very curious to know this.\"  \"He declared that he was the brother of your high-priest, that his name was Gaumata, and that this would be proved by the pass which we should find in the sleeve of his Magian's robe.  The landlord found this document and, being able to read, confirmed the statement of the sick youth; he was, however, soon seized by a fresh attack of fever, and began to speak incoherently.\"  \"Could you understand him?\"  \"Yes, for his talk always ran on the same subject.  The hanging-gardens seemed to fill his thoughts.  He must have just escaped some great danger, and probably had had a lover's meeting there with a woman called Mandane.\"  \"Mandane, Mandane,\" said Cambyses in a low voice; \"if I do not mistake, that is the name of the highest attendant on Amasis' daughter.\"  These words did not escape the sharp ears of the Greek.  He thought a moment and then exclaimed with a smile; \"Set the prisoners free, my King; I will answer for it with my own head, that Bartja was not in the hanging-gardens.\"  The king was surprised at this speech but not angry.  The free, unrestrained, graceful manner of this Athenian towards himself produced the same impression, that a fresh sea-breeze makes when felt for the first time.  The nobles of his own court, even his nearest relations, approached him bowing and cringing, but this Greek stood erect in his presence; the Persians never ventured to address their ruler without a thousand flowery and flattering phrases, but the Athenian was simple, open and straightforward.  Yet his words were accompanied by such a charm of action and expression, that the king could understand them, notwithstanding the defective Persian in which they were clothed, better than the allegorical speeches of his own subjects.  Nitetis and Phanes were the only human beings, who had ever made him forget that he was a king.  With them he was a man speaking to his fellow-man, instead of a despot speaking with creatures whose very existence was the plaything of his own caprice.  Such is the effect produced by real manly dignity, superior culture and the consciousness of a right to freedom, on the mind even of a tyrant.  But there was something beside all this, that had helped to win Cambyses' favor for the Athenian.  This man's coming seemed as if it might possibly give him back the treasure he had believed was lost and more than lost.  But how could the life of such a foreign adventurer be accepted as surety for the sons of the highest Persians in the realm?  The proposal, however, did not make him angry.  On the contrary, he could not help smiling at the boldness of this Greek, who in his eagerness had freed himself from the cloth which hung over his mouth and beard, and exclaimed: \"By Mithras, Greek, it really seems as if you were to prove a messenger of good for us!  I accept your offer.  If the prisoners, notwithstanding your supposition, should still prove guilty you are bound to pass your whole life at my court and in my service, but if, on the contrary, you are able to prove what I so ardently long for, I will make you richer than any of your countrymen.\"  Phanes answered by a smile which seemed to decline this munificent offer, and asked: \"Is it permitted me to put a few questions to yourself and to "]]]
