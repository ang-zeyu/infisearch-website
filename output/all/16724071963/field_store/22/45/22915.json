To you they are mere air--or less; for the air is a tangible thing that can fill a ship's sails and drive it against the stream, whose varying nature can bring comfort or suffering to your body.\"  \"My world is within!\"  said Paula, laying her hand on her heart.  \"Very true.  And all creation may find room there; for what cannot the human heart, as it is called, contain!  The more we require it to take and keep, the more ready it is to hold it.  It is unsafe to let the lock rust; for, if once it has grown stiff, when we want to open it no pulling and wrenching will avail.  And besides--but I do not want to grieve you. --You have a habit of only looking backwards....\"  \"And what that is pleasurable lies before me?  Your blame is harsh and at the same time unjust.--Indeed, and how can you tell which way I look?\"  \"Because I have watched you with the eye of a friend.  In truth, Paula, you have forgotten how to look around and forward.  The life which lies behind you and which you have lost is all your world.  I once showed you on a fragmentary papyrus that belonged to my foster father, Horus Apollo, a heathen demon represented as going forwards, while his head was turned on his neck so that the face and eyes looked behind him.\"  \"I remember it perfectly.\"  Well, you have long been just like him.  'All things move,' says Heraclitus, so you are forced to float onwards with the great stream; or, to vary the image, you must walk forwards on the high-road of life towards the common goal; but your eye is fixed on what lies behind you, feasting on the prospect of a handsome and wealthy home, kindness and tenderness, noble and loving faces, and a happy, but alas!  long-lost existence.  All the same, on you must go.--What must the result be?\"  \"I must stumble, you think, and fall?\"  The physician's reproof had hit Paula all the harder because she could not conceal from herself that there was much truth in it.  She had come hither on purpose to find encouragement, and these accusations troubled even her sense of high health.  Why should she submit to be taken to task like a school-girl by this man, himself still young?  If this went on she would let him hear....  But he was speaking again, and his reply calmed her, and strengthened her conviction that he was a true and well-meaning friend.  \"Not that perhaps,\" he said, \"because--well, because nature has blessed you with perfect balance, and you go forward in full self-possession as becomes the daughter of a hero.  We must not forget that it is of your soul that I am speaking; and that maintains its innate dignity of feeling among so much that is petty and mean.\"  \"Then why need I fear to look back when it gives me so much comfort?\" she eagerly enquired, as she gazed in his face with fresh spirit.  \"Because it may easily lead you to tread on other people's feet!  That hurts them; then they are annoyed, and they get accustomed to think grudgingly of you--you who are more lovable than they are.\"  \"But quite unjustly; for I am not conscious of ever having intentionally grieved or hurt any one in my whole life.\"  \"I know that; but you have done so unintentionally a thousand times.\"  \"Then it would be better I should quit them altogether.\"  \"No, and a thousand times no!  The man who avoids his kind and lives in solitude fancies he is doing some great thing and raising himself above the level of the existence he despises.  But look a little closer: it is self-interest and egoism which drive him into the cave and the cloister. In any case he neglects his highest duty towards humanity--or let us say merely towards the society he belongs to--in order to win what he believes to be his own salvation.  Society is a great body, and every individual should regard himself as a member of it, bound to serve and succor it, and even, when necessary, to make sacrifices for it.  The greatest are not too great.  But those who crave isolation,--you yourself--nay, hear me out, for I may never again risk the danger of incurring your wrath--desire to be a body apart.  What Paula has known and possessed, she keeps locked in the treasure-house of her memory under bolt and key; What Paula is, she feels she still must be--and for whom? Again, for that same Paula.  She has suffered great sorrow and on that her soul lives; but this is evil nourishment, unwholesome and bad for her.\"  She was about to rise; but he bent forward, with a zealous conviction that he must not allow himself to be interrupted, and lightly touched her arm as though to prevent her quitting her seat, while he went on unhesitatingly:  \"You feed on your old sorrows!  Well and good.  Many a time have I seen that trial can elevate the soul.  It can teach a brave heart to feel the woes of others more deeply; it can rouse a desire to assuage the griefs of others with beautiful self-devotion.  Those who have known pain and affliction enjoy ease and pleasure with double satisfaction; sufferers learn to be grateful for even the smaller joys of life.  But you?-- I have long striven for courage to tell you so--you derive no benefit from suffering because you lock it up in your breast--as if a man were to enclose some precious seed in a silver trinket to carry about with him. It should be sown in the earth, to sprout and bear fruit!  However, I do not blame you; I only wish to advise you as a true and devoted friend. Learn to feel yourself a member of the body to which your destiny has bound you for the present, whether you like it or not.  Try to contribute to it all that your capacities allow you achieve.  You will find that you can do something for it; the casket will open, and to your surprise and delight you will perceive that the seed dropped into the soil will germinate, that flowers will open and fruit will form of which you may make bread, or extract from it a balm for yourself or for others!  Then you will leave the dead to bury the dead, as the Bible has it, and dedicate to the living those great powers and gracious gifts which an illustrious father and a noble mother--nay, and a long succession of distinguished ancestors, have bequeathed to a descendant worthy of them. Then you will recover that which you have lost: the joy in existence which we ought both to feel and to diffuse, because it brings with it an obligation which it which is only granted to us once to fulfil.  Kind fate has fitted you above a hundred thousand others for being loved; and if you do not forget the gratitude you owe for that, hearts will be turned to you, though now they shun the tree which has beset itself intentionally with thorns, and which lets its branches droop like the weeping-willows by the Nile.  Thus you will lead a new and beautiful life, receiving and giving joy.  The isolated and charmless existence you drag through here, to the satisfaction of none and least of all to your own, you can transform to one of fruition and satisfaction--breathing and moving healthily and beneficently in the light of day.  It lies in your power.  When you came up here to give your care to these poor injured creatures, you took the first step in the new path I desire to show you, to true happiness.  I did not expect you, and I am thankful that you have come; for I know that as you entered that door you may have started on the road to renewed happiness, if you have the will to walk in it.--Thank God!  That is said and over!\"  The leech rose and wiped his forehead, looking uneasily at Paula who had remained seated; her breath came fast, and she was more confused and undecided than he had ever seen her.  She clasped her hand over her brow, and gazed, speechless, into her lap as though she wished to smother some pain.  The young physician beat his arms together, like a laborer in the winter when his hands are frozen, and exclaimed with distressful emotion: \"Yes, I have spoken, and I cannot regret having done so; but what I foresaw has come to pass:  The greatest happiness that ever sweetened my daily life is gone out of it!  To love Plato is a noble rule, but greater than Plato is the truth; and yet, those who preach it must be prepared to find that truth scares away friends from the unpleasing vicinity of its ill-starred Apostles!\"  At this Paula rose, and following the impulse of her generous heart, offered the leech her hand in all sincerity; he grasped it in both his, pressing it so tightly that it almost hurt her, and his eyes glistened with moisture as he exclaimed: \"That is as I hoped; that is splendid, that is noble!  Let me but be your brother, high-souled maiden!--Now, come.  That poor, crazy, lovely girl will heal of her death-wound under your hands if under any!\"  \"I will come!\"  she replied heartily; and there was something healthy and cheerful in her manner as they entered the sick-room; but her expression suddenly changed, and she asked pensively:  \"And supposing we restore the unhappy girl--what good will she get by it?\"  \"She will breathe and see the sunshine,\" replied the leech; \"she will be grateful to you, and finally she will contribute what she can to the whole body.  She will be alive in short, she will live.  For life--feel it, understand it as I do--life is the best thing we have.\"  Paula gazed with astonishment in the man's unlovely but enthusiastic face.  How radiantly joyful!  No one could have called it ugly at this moment, or have said that it lacked charm.  He believed what he had asserted with such fervent feeling, though it was in contradiction to a view he had held only yesterday and often defended: that life in itself was misery to all who could not grasp it of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5519"],["title","The Bride of the Nile — Volume 03 (#4)"],["body","own strength, and make something of it worth making.  At this moment he really felt that it was the best gift.  Paula went forward, and his eyes followed her, as the gaze of the pious pilgrim is fixed on the holy image he has travelled to see, over seas and mountains, with bruised feet.  They went up to the sick girl's bed.  The nun drew back, making her own reflections on the physician's altered mien, and his childlike, beaming contentment, as he explained to Paula what particular peril threatened the sufferer, and by what treatment he hoped to save her; how to make the bandages and give the medicines, and how necessary it was to accept the poor crazy girl's fancies and treat them as rational ideas so long as the fever lasted.  At last he was forced to go and attend to other patients.  Paula remained sitting at the head of the bed and gazing at the face of the sufferer.  How fair it was!  And Orion had snatched this rose in the bud, and trodden it under foot!  She had, no doubt, felt for him what Paula herself felt.  And now?  Did she feel nothing but hatred of him, or could her heart, in spite of her indignation and scorn, not altogether cast off the spell that had once bound it?  What weakness was this!  She was, she must, she would be his foe!  Her thoughts went back to the idle and futile life that she had led for so many years.  The physician had hit the mark; and he had been too easy rather than severe.  Yes, she would begin to make good use of her powers --but how, in what way, here and among these people?  How transfigured poor Philippus had seemed when she had given him her hand; with what energy had he poured forth his words.  \"And how false,\" she mused, \"is the saying that the body is the mirror of the soul!  If it were so, Philippus would have the face of Orion, and Orion that of Philippus.\"  But could Orion's heart be wholly reprobate? Nay, that was impossible; her every impulse resisted the belief.  She must either love him or hate him, there was no third alternative; but as yet the two passions were struggling within her in a way that was quite intolerable.  The physician had spoken of being a brother to her, and she could not help smiling at the idea.  She could, she thought, live very happily and calmly with him, with her nurse Betta, and with the learned old friend who shared his home, and of whom he had often talked to her; she could join him in his studies, help him in his calling, and discuss many things well worth knowing.  Such a life, she told herself, would be a thousand times preferable to this, with Neforis.  In him she had certainly found a friend; and her glad recognition of the fact was the first step towards the fulfilment of his promise, since it showed that her heart was still ready to go forth to the kindness of another.  Amid these meditations, however, her anxiety for Hiram constantly recurred to her, and it was clear to her mind that, if she and Orion should come to extremities, she could no longer dwell under the governor's roof.  Often she had longed for nothing so fervently as to be able to quit it; but to-day it filled her with dread, for parting from her uncle necessarily involved parting from his son.  She hated him; still, to lose sight of him altogether would be very hard to bear. To go with Philippus and live with him as his sister would never do; nay, it struck her as something inconceivable, strangely incongruous.  Meanwhile she listened to Mandane's breathing and treated her in obedience to the leech's orders, longing for his return; presently however, not he but the nun came to the bed-side, laid her hand on the girl's forehead, and without paying any heed to Paula, whispered kindly: \"That is right child, sleep away; have a nice long sleep.  So long as she can be kept quiet; if only she goes on like this!--Her head is cooler. Philippus will certainly say there is scarcely any fever.  Thank God, the worst danger is over!\"  \"Oh, how glad I am!\"  cried Paula, and she spoke with such warmth and sincerity that the nun gave her a friendly nod and left the sick girl to her care, quite satisfied.  It was long since Paula had felt so happy.  She fancied that her presence had had a good affect on the sufferer, that Mandane had already been brought by her nursing to the threshold of a new life.  Paula, who but just now had regarded herself as a persecuted victim of Fate, now breathed more freely in the belief that she too might bring joy to some one.  She looked into Mandane's more than pretty face with real joy and tenderness, laid the bandage which had slipped aside gently over her ears, and breathed a soft kiss on her long silken lashes.  She rapidly grew in favor with the shrewd nun; when the hour for prayer came round, the sister included in her petitions--Paula--the orphan under a stranger's roof, the Greek girl born, by the inscrutable decrees of God, outside the pale of her saving creed.  At length Philippus returned; he was rejoiced at his new friend's brightened aspect, and declared that Mandane had, under her care, got past the first and worst danger, and might be expected to recover, slowly indeed, but completely.  After Paula had renewed the compress--and he intentionally left her to do it unaided, he said encouragingly:  \"How quickly you have learnt your business.--Now, the patient is asleep again; the Sister will keep watch, and for the present we can be of no use to the girl; sleep is the best nourishment she can have.  But with us--or at any rate with me, it is different.  We have still two hours to wait for the next meal: my breakfast is standing untouched, and yours no doubt fared the same; so be my guest.  They always send up enough to satisfy six bargemen.\"  Paula liked the proposal, for she had long been hungry.  The nun was desired to hasten to fetch some more plates, of drinking-vessels there was no lack--and soon the new allies were seated face to face, each at a small table.  He carved the duck and the roast quails, put the salad before her and some steaming artichokes, which the nun had brought up at the request of the cook whose only son the physician had saved; he invited her attention to the little pies, the fruits and cakes which were laid ready, and played the part of butler; and then, while they heartily enjoyed the meal, they carried on a lively conversation.  Paula for the first time asked Philippus to tell her something of his early youth; he began with an account of his present mode of life, as a partner in the home of the singular old priest of Isis, Horus Apollo, a diligent student; he described his strenuous activity by day and his quiet studies by night, and gave everything such an amusing aspect that often she could not help laughing.  But presently he was sad, as he told her how at an early age he had lost his father and mother, and was left to depend solely on himself and on a very small fortune, having no relations; for his father had been a grammarian, invited to Alexandria from Athens, who had been forced to make a road for himself through life, which had lain before him like an overgrown jungle of papyrus and reeds. Every hour of his life was devoted to his work, for a rough, outspoken Goliath, such as he, never could find it easy to meet with helpful patrons.  He had managed to live by teaching in the high schools of Alexandria, Athens, and Caesarea, and by preparing medicines from choice herbs--drinking water instead of wine, eating bread and fruit instead of quails and pies; and he had made a friend of many a good man, but never yet of a woman--it would be difficult with such a face as his!  \"Then I am the first?\"  said Paula, who felt deep respect for the man who had made his way by his own energy to the eminent position which he had long held, not merely in Memphis, but among Egyptian physicians generally.  He nodded, and with such a blissful smile that she felt as though a sunbeam had shone into her very soul.  He noticed this at once, raised his goblet, and drank to her, exclaiming with a flush on his cheek:  \"The joy that comes to others early has come to me late; but then the woman I call my friend is matchless!\"  \"Well, it is to be hoped she may not prove to be so wicked as you just now described her.--If only our alliance is not fated to end soon and abruptly.\"  \"Ah!\"  cried the physician, \"every drop of blood in my veins......\"  \"You would be ready to shed it for me,\" Paula broke in, with a pathetic gesture, borrowed from a great tragedian she had seen at the theatre in Damascus.  \"But never fear: it will not be a matter of life and death-- at worst they will but turn me out of the house and of Memphis.\"  \"You?\"  cried Philippus startled, \"but who would dare to do so?\"  \"They who still regard me as a stranger.--You described the case admirably.  If they have their way, my dear new friend, our fate will be like that of the learned Dionysius of Cyrene.\"  \"Of Cyrene?\"  \"Yes.  It was my father who told me the story.  When Dionysius sent his son to the High School at Athens, he sat down to write a treatise for him on all the things a student should do and avoid.  He devoted himself to the task with the utmost diligence; but when, at the end of four years, he could write on the last leaf of the roll.  \"Here this book hath a happy ending,\" the young man whose studies it was intended to guide came home to Cyrene, a finished scholar.\"  \"And we have struck up a friendship.... ?\"  \"And made a treaty of alliance, only to be parted ere long.\"  Philippus struck his fist vehemently on the little table in front of his couch and exclaimed: \"That I will find means to prevent!--But now, tell me in confidence, what has last happened between you and the family down- stairs?\"  \"You will know quite soon enough.\"  \"Whichever of them fancies that you can be turned out of doors without more ado and there will be an end between us, may find himself mistaken!\" cried the physician with an angry sparkle in his eyes.  \"I have a right to "]]]
