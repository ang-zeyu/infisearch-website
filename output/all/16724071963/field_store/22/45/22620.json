Then throw in the ape's eyes,       [The sentences and mediums employed by the witches, according to      papyrus-rolls which remain.  I have availed myself of the Magic      papyrus of Harris, and of two in the Berlin collection, one of which      is in Greek. ]  and the ibis feathers, and the scraps of linen with the black signs on them.  Stir it all a little; now put out the fire,  \"Take the jug and fetch some water--make haste, here comes a stranger.\"  A sooty-black negro woman, with a piece of torn colorless stuff hanging round her hips, set a large clay-jar on her grey woolly matted hair, and without looking at him, went past Paaker, who was now close to the cave.  The old woman, a tall figure bent with years, with a sharply-cut and wrinkled face, that might once have been handsome, made her preparations for receiving the visitor by tying a gaudy kerchief over her head, fastening her blue cotton garment round her throat, and flinging a fibre mat over the birds' heads.  Paaker called out to her, but she feigned to be deaf and not to hear his voice.  Only when he stood quite close to her, did she raise her shrewd, twinkling eyes, and cry out:  \"A lucky day! a white day that brings a noble guest and high honor.\"  \"Get up,\" commanded Paaker, not giving her any greeting, but throwing a silver ring among the roots that lay in her lap,       [The Egyptians had no coins before Alexander and the Ptolemies, but      used metals for exchange, usually in the form of rings.]  \"and give me in exchange for good money some water in a clean vessel.\"  \"Fine pure silver,\" said the old woman, while she held the ring, which she had quickly picked out from the roots, close to her eyes; \"it is too much for mere water, and too little for my good liquors.\"  \"Don't chatter, hussy, but make haste,\" cried Paaker, taking another ring from his money-bag and throwing it into her lap.  \"Thou hast an open hand,\" said the old woman, speaking in the dialect of the upper classes; \"many doors must be open to thee, for money is a pass- key that turns any lock.  Would'st thou have water for thy good money? Shall it protect thee against noxious beasts?--shall it help thee to reach down a star?  Shall it guide thee to secret paths?--It is thy duty to lead the way.  Shall it make heat cold, or cold warm?  Shall it give thee the power of reading hearts, or shall it beget beautiful dreams? Wilt thou drink of the water of knowledge and see whether thy friend or thine enemy--ha! if thine enemy shall die?  Would'st thou a drink to strengthen thy memory?  Shall the water make thee invisible? or remove the 6th toe from thy left foot?\"  \"You know me?\"  asked Paaker.  \"How should I?\"  said the old woman, \"but my eyes are sharp, and I can prepare good waters for great and small.\"  \"Mere  babble!\"  exclaimed  Paaker,  impatiently clutching at the whip in his girdle; \"make haste, for the lady for whom--\"  \"Dost thou want the water for a lady?\"  interrupted the old woman.  \"Who would have thought it?--old men certainly ask for my philters much oftener than young ones--but I can serve thee.\"  With these words the old woman went into the cave, and soon returned with a thin cylindrical flask of alabaster in her hand.  \"This is the drink,\" she said, giving the phial to Paaker.  \"Pour half into water, and offer it to the lady.  If it does not succeed at first, it is certain the second time.  A child may drink the water and it will not hurt him, or if an old man takes it, it makes him gay.  Ah, I know the taste of it!\"  and she moistened her lips with the white fluid. \"It can hurt no one, but I will take no more of it, or old Hekt will be tormented with love and longing for thee; and that would ill please the rich young lord, ha! ha!  If the drink is in vain I am paid enough, if it takes effect thou shalt bring me three more gold rings; and thou wilt return, I know it well.\"  Paaker had listened motionless to the old woman, and siezed the flask eagerly, as if bidding defiance to some adversary; he put it in his money bag, threw a few more rings at the feet of the witch, and once more hastily demanded a bowl of Nile-water.  \"Is my lord in such a hurry?\"  muttered the old woman, once more going into the cave.  \"He asks if I know him? him certainly I do? but the darling? who can it be hereabouts? perhaps little Uarda at the paraschites yonder.  She is pretty enough; but she is lying on a mat, run over and dying.  We must see what my lord means.  He would have pleased me well enough, if I were young; but he will reach the goal, for he is resolute and spares no one.\"  While she muttered these and similar words, she filled a graceful cup of glazed earthenware with filtered Nile-water, which she poured out of a large porous clay jar, and laid a laurel leaf, on which was scratched two hearts linked together by seven strokes, on the surface of the limpid fluid.  Then she stepped out into the air again.  As Paaker took the vessel from her looked at the laurel leaf, she said:  \"This indeed binds hearts; three is the husband, four is the wife, seven is the chachach, charcharachacha.\"--[This jargon is fund in a magic- papyrus at Berlin.]  The old woman sang this spell not without skill; but the Mohar appeared not to listen to her jargon.  He descended carefully into the valley, and directed his steps to the resting place of the wife of Mena.  By the side of a rock, which hill him from Nefert, he paused, set the cup on a flat block of stone, and drew the flask with the philter out of his girdle.  His fingers trembled, but a thousand voices seemed to surge up and cry:  \"Take it!--do it!--put in the drink!--now or never.\"  He felt like a solitary traveller, who finds on his road the last will of a relation whose possessions he had hoped for, but which disinherits him.  Shall he surrender it to the judge, or shall he destroy it.  Paaker was not merely outwardly devout; hitherto he had in everything intended to act according to the prescriptions of the religion of his fathers.  Adultery was a heavy sin; but had not he an older right to Nefert than the king's charioteer?  He who followed the black arts of magic, should, according to the law, be punished by death, and the old woman had a bad name for her evil arts; but he had not sought her for the sake of the philter.  Was it not possible that the Manes of his forefathers, that the Gods themselves, moved by his prayers and offerings, had put him in possession by an accident--which was almost a miracle--of the magic potion efficacy he never for an instant doubted?  Paaker's associates held him to be a man of quick decision, and, in fact, in difficult cases he could act with unusual rapidity, but what guided him in these cases, was not the swift-winged judgment of a prepared and well-schooled brain, but usually only resulted from the outcome of a play of question and answer.  Amulets of the most various kinds hung round his neck, and from his girdle, all consecrated by priests, and of special sanctity or the highest efficacy.  There was the lapis lazuli eye, which hung to his girdle by a gold chain; When he threw it on the ground, so as to lie on the earth, if its engraved side turned to heaven, and its smooth side lay on the ground, he said \"yes;\" in the other case, on the contrary, \"no.\"  In his purse lay always a statuette of the god Apheru, who opened roads; this he threw down at cross-roads, and followed the direction which the pointed snout of the image indicated.  He frequently called into council the seal-ring of his deceased father, an old family possession, which the chief priests of Abydos had laid upon the holiest of the fourteen graves of Osiris, and endowed with miraculous power.  It consisted of a gold ring with a broad signet, on which could be read the name of Thotmes III., who had long since been deified, and from whom Paaker's ancestors had derived it.  If it were desirable to consult the ring, the Mohar touched with the point of his bronze dagger the engraved sign of the name, below which were represented three objects sacred to the Gods, and three that were, on the contrary, profane.  If he hit one of the former, he concluded that his father--who was gone to Osiris--concurred in his design; in the contrary case he was careful to postpone it.  Often he pressed the ring to his heart, and awaited the first living creature that he might meet, regarding it as a messenger from his father;--if it came to him from the right hand as an encouragement, if from the left as a warning.  By degrees he had reduced these questionings to a system.  All that he found in nature he referred to himself and the current of his life.  It was at once touching, and pitiful, to see how closely he lived with the Manes of his dead.  His lively, but not exalted fancy, wherever he gave it play, presented to the eye of his soul the image of his father and of an elder brother who had died early, always in the same spot, and almost tangibly distinct.  But he never conjured up the remembrance of the beloved dead in order to think of them in silent melancholy--that sweet blossom of the thorny wreath of sorrow; only for selfish ends.  The appeal to the Manes of his father he had found especially efficacious in certain desires and difficulties; calling on the Manes of his brother was potent in certain others; and so he turned from one to the other with the precision of a carpenter, who rarely doubts whether he should give the preference to a hatchet or a saw.  These doings he held to be well pleasing to the Gods, and as he was convinced that the spirits of his dead had, after their justification, passed into Osiris that is to say, as atoms forming part of the great world-soul, at this time had a share in the direction of the universe-- he sacrificed to them not only in the family catacomb, but also in the temples of the Necropolis dedicated to the worship of ancestors, and with special preference in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5440"],["title","Uarda : a Romance of Ancient Egypt â€” Volume 02 (#6)"],["body","House of Seti.  He accepted advice, nay even blame, from Ameni and the other priests under his direction; and so lived full of a virtuous pride in being one of the most zealous devotees in the land, and one of the most pleasing to the Gods, a belief on which his pastors never threw any doubt.  Attended and guided at every step by supernatural powers, he wanted no friend and no confidant.  In the fleld, as in Thebes, he stood apart, and passed among his comrades for a reserved man, rough and proud, but with a strong will.  He had the power of calling up the image of his lost love with as much vividness as the forms of the dead, and indulged in this magic, not only through a hundred still nights, but in long rides and drives through silent wastes.  Such visions were commonly followed by a vehement and boiling overflow of his hatred against the charioteer, and a whole series of fervent prayers for his destruction.  When Paaker set the cup of water for Nefert on the flat stone and felt for the philter, his soul was so full of desire that there was no room for hatred; still he could not altogether exclude the idea that he would commit a great crime by making use of a magic drink.  Before pouring the fateful drops into the water, he would consult the oracle of the ring. The dagger touched none of the holy symbols of the inscription on the signet, and in other circumstances he would, without going any farther, have given up his project.  But this time he unwillingly returned it to its sheath, pressed the gold ring to his heart, muttered the name of his brother in Osiris, and awaited the first living creature that might come towards him.  He had not long to wait,  from the mountain slope opposite to him rose, with heavy, slow wing-strokes, two light-colored vultures.  In anxious suspense he followed their flight, as they rose, higher and higher.  For a moment they poised motionless, borne up by the air, circled round each other, then wheeled to the left and vanished behind the mountains, denying him the fulfilment of his desire.  He hastily grasped the phial to fling it from him, but the surging passion in his veins had deprived him of his self-control.  Nefert's image stood before him as if beckoning him; a mysterious power clenched his fingers close and yet closer round the phial, and with the same defiance which he showed to his associates, he poured half of the philter into the cup and approached his victim.  Nefert had meanwhile left her shady retreat and come towards him.  She silently accepted the water he offered her, and drank it with delight, to the very dregs.  \"'Thank you,\" she said, when she had recovered breath after her eager draught.  \"That has done me good!  How fresh and acid the water tastes; but your hand shakes, and you are heated by your quick run for me--poor man.\"  With these words she looked at him with a peculiar expressive glance of her large eyes, and gave him her right hand, which he pressed wildly to his lips.  \"That will do,\" she said smiling; \"here comes the princess with a priest, out of the hovel of the unclean.  With what frightful words you terrified me just now.  It is true I gave you just cause to be angry with me; but now you are kind again--do you hear?--and will bring your mother again to see mine.  Not a word.  I shall see, whether cousin Paaker refuses me obedience.\"  She threatened him playfully with her finger, and then growing grave she added, with a look that pierced Paaker's heart with pain, and yet with ecstasy, \"Let us leave off quarrelling.  It is so much better when people are kind to each other.\"  After these words she walked towards the house of the paraschites, while Paaker pressed his hands to his breast, and murmured:  \"The drink is working, and she will be mine.  I thank ye--ye Immortals!\"  But this thanksgiving, which hitherto he had never failed to utter when any good fortune had befallen him, to-day died on his lips.  Close before him he saw the goal of his desires; there, under his eyes, lay the magic spring longed for for years.  A few steps farther, and he might slake at its copious stream his thirst both for love and for revenge.  While he followed the wife of Mena, and replaced the phial carefully in his girdle, so as to lose no drop of the precious fluid which, according to the prescription of the old woman, he needed to use again, warning voices spoke in his breast, to which he usually listened as to a fatherly admonition; but at this moment he mocked at them, and even gave outward expression to the mood that ruled him--for he flung up his right hand like a drunken man, who turns away from the preacher of morality on his way to the wine-cask; and yet passion held him so closely ensnared, that the thought that he should live through the swift moments which would change him from an honest man into a criminal, hardly dawned, darkly on his soul.  He had hitherto dared to indulge his desire for love and revenge in thought only, and had left it to the Gods to act for themselves; now he had taken his cause out of the hand of the Celestials, and gone into action without them, and in spite of them.  The sorceress Hekt passed him; she wanted to see the woman for whom she had given him the philter.  He perceived her and shuddered, but soon the old woman vanished among the rocks muttering.  \"Look at the fellow with six toes.  He makes himself comfortable with the heritage of Assa.\"  In the middle of the valley walked Nefert and the pioneer, with the princess Bent-Anat and Pentaur who accompanied her.  When these two had come out of the hut of the paraschites, they stood opposite each other in silence.  The royal maiden pressed her hand to her heart, and, like one who is thirsty, drank in the pure air of the mountain valley with deeply drawn breath; she felt as if released from some overwhelming burden, as if delivered from some frightful danger.  At last she turned to her companion, who gazed earnestly at the ground.  \"What an hour!\"  she said.  Pentaur's tall figure did not move, but he bowed his head in assent, as if he were in a dream.  Bent-Anat now saw him for the first time in fall daylight; her large eyes rested on him with admiration, and she asked:  \"Art thou the priest, who yesterday, after my first visit to this house, so readily restored me to cleanness?\"  \"I am he,\" replied Pentaur.  \"I recognized thy voice, and I am grateful to thee, for it was thou that didst strengthen my courage to follow the impulse of my heart, in spite of my spiritual guides, and to come here again.  Thou wilt defend me if others blame me.\"  \"I came here to pronounce thee unclean.\"  \"Then thou hast changed thy mind?\"  asked Bent-Anat, and a smile of contempt curled her lips.  \"I follow a high injunction, that commands us to keep the old institutions sacred.  If touching a paraschites, it is said, does not defile a princess, whom then can it defile? for whose garment is more spotless than hers?\"  \"But this is a good man with all his meanness,\" interrupted Bent-Anat, \"and in spite of the disgrace, which is the bread of life to him as honor is to us.  May the nine great Gods forgive me! but he who is in there is loving, pious and brave, and pleases me--and thou, thou, who didst think yesterday to purge away the taint of his touch with a word--what prompts thee today to cast him with the lepers?\"  \"The admonition of an enlightened man, never to give up any link of the old institutions; because thereby the already weakened chain may be broken, and fall rattling to the ground.\"  \"Then thou condemnest me to uncleanness for the sake of all old superstition, and of the populace, but not for my actions?  Thou art silent?  Answer me now, if thou art such a one as I took the for, freely and sincerely; for it concerns the peace of my soul.\"  Pentaur breathed hard; and then from the depths of his soul, tormented by doubts, these deeply-felt words forced themselves as if wrung from him; at first softly, but louder as he went on.  \"Thou dost compel me to say what I had better not even think; but rather will I sin against obedience than against truth, the pure daughter of the Sun, whose aspect, Bent-Anat, thou dost wear.  Whether the paraschites is unclean by birth or not, who am I that I should decide?  But to me this man appeared--as to thee--as one moved by the same pure and holy emotions as stir and bless me and mine, and thee and every soul born of woman; and I believe that the impressions of this hour have touched thy soul as well as mine, not to taint, but to purify.  If I am wrong, may the many-named Gods forgive me, Whose breath lives and works in the paraschites as well as in thee and me, in Whom I believe, and to Whom I will ever address my humble songs, louder and more joyfully, as I learn that all that lives and breathes, that weeps and rejoices, is the image of their sublime nature, and born to equal joy and equal sorrow.\"  Pentaur had raised his eyes to heaven; now they met the proud and joyful radiance of the princess' glance, while she frankly offered him her hand. He humbly kissed her robe, but she said:  \"Nay--not so.  Lay thy hand in blessing on mine.  Thou art a man and a true priest.  Now I can be satisfied to be regarded as unclean, for my father also desires that, by us especially, the institutions of the past that have so long continued should be respected, for the sake of the people.  Let us pray in common to the Gods, that these poor people may be released from the old ban.  How beautiful the world might be, if men would but let man remain what the Celestials have made him.  But Paaker and poor Nefert are waiting in the scorching sun-come, follow me.\"  She went forward, but after a few steps she turned round to him, and asked:  \"What is thy name?\"  \"Pentaur.\"  \"Thou then art the poet of the House of Seti?\"  \"They call me so.\"  Bent-Anat stood still a moment, gazing full at him as at a kinsman whom we meet for the first time face to face, and said:  \"The Gods have "]]]
