D.W.]      AN EGYPTIAN PRINCESS, Part 1.  By Georg Ebers  Volume 3.    CHAPTER VII.  Psamtik went at once from his father's apartments to the temple of the goddess Neith.  At the entrance he asked for the high-priest and was begged by one of the inferior priests to wait, as the great Neithotep was at that moment praying in the holiest sanctuary of the exalted Queen of Heaven.       [The temples of Egypt were so constructed as to intensify the      devotion of the worshipper by conducting him onward through a series      of halls or chambers gradually diminishing in size.  \"The way      through these temples is clearly indicated, no digression is      allowed, no error possible.  We wander on through the huge and      massive gates of entrance, between the ranks of sacred animals.  The      worshipper is received into an ample court, but by degrees the walls      on either side approach one another, the halls become less lofty,      all is gradually tending towards one point.  And thus we wander on,      the sights and sounds of God's world without attract us no longer,      we see nothing but the sacred representations which encompass us so      closely, feel only the solemnity of the temple in which we stand.      And the consecrated walls embrace us ever more and more closely,      until at last we reach the lonely, resonant chamber occupied by the      divinity himself, and entered by no human being save his priest.\"      Schnaase, Kunstaeschirhtc I. 394.]  After a short time a young priest appeared with the intelligence that his superior awaited the Prince's visit.  Psamtik had seated himself under the shadow of the sacred grove of silver poplars bordering the shores of the consecrated lake, holy to the great Neith.  He rose immediately, crossed the temple-court, paved with stone and asphalte, on which the sun's rays were darting like fiery arrows, and turned into one of the long avenues of Sphinxes which led to the isolated Pylons before the gigantic temple of the goddess.  He then passed through the principal gate, ornamented, as were all Egyptian temple-entrances, with the winged sun's disc.  Above its widely-opened folding doors arose on either side, tower-like buildings, slender obelisks and waving flags.  The front of the temple, rising from the earth in the form of an obtuse angle, had somewhat the appearance of a fortress, and was covered with colored pictures and inscriptions.  Through the porch Psamtik passed on into a lofty entrance-chamber, and from thence into the great hall itself, the ceiling of which was strewn with thousands of golden stars, and supported by four rows of lofty pillars.  Their capitals were carved in imitation of the lotus-flower, and these, the shafts of the columns, the walls of this huge hall, and indeed every niche and corner that met the eye were covered with brilliant colors and hieroglyphics.  The columns rose to a gigantic height, the eye seemed to wander through immeasurable space, and the air breathed by the worshippers was heavy with the fragrance of Kyphi and incense, and the odors which arose from the laboratory attached to the temple.  Strains of soft music, proceeding from invisible hands, flowed on unceasingly, only occasionally interrupted by the deep lowing of the sacred cows of Isis, or the shrill call of the sparrow-hawk of Horus, whose habitations were in one of the adjoining halls.  No sooner did the prolonged low of a cow break like distant thunder on the ear, or the sharp cry of the sparrow-hawk shoot like a flash of lightning through the nerves of the worshippers, than each crouching form bent lower still, and touched the pavement with his forehead.  On a portion of this pavement, raised above the rest, stood the priests, some wearing ostrich- feathers on their bald and shining heads; others panther-skins over their white-robed shoulders.  Muttering and singing, bowing low and rising again, they swung the censers and poured libations of pure water to the gods out of golden vessels.  In this immense temple man seemed a dwarf in his own eyes.  All his senses even to the organs of respiration, were occupied by objects far removed from daily life, objects that thrilled and almost oppressed him.  Snatched from all that was familiar in his daily existence, he seemed to grow dizzy and seek support beyond himself. To this the voice of the priests directed him and the cries of the sacred animals were believed to prove a divinity at hand.  Psamtik assumed the posture of a worshipper on the low, gilded and cushioned couch set apart for him, but was unable to pay any real devotion, and passed on to the adjoining apartment before mentioned, where the sacred cows of Isis-Neith and the sparrow-hawk of Horus were kept.  These creatures were concealed from the gaze of the worshippers by a curtain of rich fabric embroidered with gold; the people were only allowed an occasional and distant glimpse of the adorable animals.  When Psamtik passed they were just being fed; cakes soaked in milk, salt and clover-blossoms were placed in golden cribs for the cows, and small birds of many-colored plumage in the beautifully-wrought and ornamented cage of the sparrow-hawk.  But, in his present mood, the heir to the throne of Egypt had no eye for these rare sights; but ascended at once, by means of a hidden staircase, to the chambers lying near the observatory, where the high-priest was accustomed to repose after the temple-service.  Neithotep, a man of seventy years, was seated in a splendid apartment. Rich Babylonian carpets covered the floor and his chair was of gold, cushioned with purple.  A tastefully-carved footstool supported his feet, his hands held a roll covered with hieroglyphics, and a boy stood behind him with a fan of ostrich-feathers to keep away the insects.  The face of the old man was deeply lined now, but it might once have been handsome, and in the large blue eyes there still lay evidence of a quick intellect and a dignified self-respect.  His artificial curls had been laid aside, and the bald, smooth head formed a strange contrast to the furrowed countenance, giving an appearance of unusual height to the forehead, generally so very low among the Egyptians.  The brightly-colored walls of the room, on which numerous sentences in hieroglyphic characters were painted, the different statues of the goddess painted likewise in gay colors, and the snow-white garments of the aged priest, were calculated to fill a stranger not only with wonder, but with a species of awe.  The old man received the prince with much affection, and asked:  \"What brings my illustrious son to the poor servant of the Deity?\"  \"I have much to report to thee, my father;\" answered Psamtik with a triumphant smile, \"for I come in this moment from Amasis.\"  \"Then he has at length granted thee an audience?\"  \"At length!\"  \"Thy countenance tells me that thou hast been favorably received by our lord, thy father.\"  \"After having first experienced his wrath.  For, when I laid before him the petition with which thou hadst entrusted me, he was exceeding wroth and nearly crushed me by his awful words.\"  \"Thou hadst surely grieved him by thy language.  Didst thou approach him as I advised thee, with lowliness, as a son humbly beseeching his father?\"  \"No, my father, I was irritated and indignant.\"  \"Then was Amasis right to be wrathful, for never should a son meet his father in anger; still less when he hath a request to bring before him. Thou know'st the promise, 'The days of him that honoreth his father shall be many.'       [This Egyptian command hears a remarkable resemblance to the fifth      in the Hebrew decalogue, both having a promise annexed.  It occurs      in the Prisse Papyrus, the most ancient sacred writing extant.]  In this one thing, my scholar, thou errest always; to gain thine ends thou usest violence and roughness, where good and gentle words would more surely prevail.  A kind word hath far more power than an angry one, and much may depend on the way in which a man ordereth his speech.  Hearken to that which I will now relate.  In former years there was a king in Egypt named Snefru, who ruled in Memphis.  And it came to pass that he dreamed, and in his dream his teeth fell out of his mouth.  And he sent for the soothsayers and told them the dream.  The first interpreter answered: 'Woe unto thee, O king, all thy kinsmen shall die before thee!' Then was Snefru wroth, caused this messenger of evil to be scourged, and sent for a second interpreter.  He answered: 'O king, live for ever, thy life shall be longer than the life of thy kinsmen and the men of thy house!'  Then the king smiled and gave presents unto this interpreter, for though the interpretations were one, yet he had understood to clothe his message in a web of fair and pleasant words.  Apprehendest thou? then hearken to my voice, and refrain from harsh words, remembering that to the ear of a ruler the manner of a man's speech is weightier than its matter.\"  \"Oh my father, how often hast thou thus admonished me!  how often have I been convinced of the evil consequences of my rough words and angry gestures!  but I cannot change my nature, I cannot .  .  .\"  \"Say rather: I will not; for he that is indeed a man, dare never again commit those sins of which he has once repented.  But I have admonished sufficiently.  Tell me now how thou didst calm the wrath of Amasis.\"  \"Thou knowest my father.  When he saw that he had wounded me in the depths of my soul by his awful words, he repented him of his anger.  He felt he had been too hard, and desired to make amends at any price.\"  \"He hath a kindly heart, but his mind is blinded, and his senses taken captive,\" cried the priest.  \"What might not Amasis do for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5452"],["title","An Egyptian Princess — Volume 03 (#1)"],["body","gypt, would he but hearken to our counsel, and to the commandments of the gods!\"  \"But hear me, my father! in his emotion he granted me the life of Phanes!\"  \"Thine eyes flash, Psamtik! that pleaseth me not.  The Athenian must die, for he has offended the gods; but though he that condemns must let justice have her way, he should have no pleasure in the death of the condemned; rather should he mourn.  Now speak; didst thou obtain aught further?\"  \"The king declared unto me to what house Nitetis belongs.\"  \"And further naught?\"  \"No, my father; but art thou not eager to learn ... ?\"  \"Curiosity is a woman's vice; moreover, I have long known all that thou canst tell me.\"  \"But didst thou not charge me but yesterday to ask my father this question?\"  \"I did do so to prove thee, and know whether thou wert resigned to the Divine will, and wert walking in those ways wherein alone thou canst become worthy of initiation into the highest grade of knowledge. Thou hast told us faithfully all that thou hast heard, and thereby proved that thou canst obey--the first virtue of a priest.\"  \"Thou knewest then the father of Nitetis?\"  \"I myself pronounced the prayer over king Hophra's tomb.\"  \"But who imparted the secret to thee?\"  \"The eternal stars, my son, and my skill in reading them.\"  \"And do these stars never deceive?\"  \"Never him that truly understands them.\"  Psamtik turned pale.  His father's dream and his own fearful horoscope passed like awful visions through his mind.  The priest detected at once the change in his features and said gently: \"Thou deem'st thyself a lost man because the heavens prognosticated evil at thy birth; but take comfort, Psamtik; I observed another sign in the heavens at that moment, which escaped the notice of the astrologers.  Thy horoscope was a threatening, a very threatening one, but its omens may be averted, they may .  .  .\"  \"O tell me, father, tell me how!\"  \"They must turn to good, if thou, forgetful of all else, canst live alone to the gods, paying a ready obedience to the Divine voice audible to us their priests alone in the innermost and holiest sanctuary.\"  \"Father, I am ready to obey thy slightest word.\"  \"The great goddess Neith, who rules in Sais, grant this, my son!\" answered the priest solemnly.  \"But now leave me alone,\" he continued kindly, \"lengthened devotions and the weight of years bring weariness. If possible, delay the death of Phanes, I wish to speak with him before he dies.  Yet one more word.  A troop of Ethiopians arrived yesterday. These men cannot speak a word of Greek, and under a faithful leader, acquainted with the Athenians and the locality, they would be the best agents for getting rid of the doomed man, as their ignorance of the language and the circumstances render treachery or gossip impossible. Before starting for Naukratis, they must know nothing of the design of their journey; the deed once accomplished, we can send them back to Kush.--[The Egyptian name for Ethiopia.]  Remember, a secret can never be too carefully kept!  Farewell.\"  Psamtik had only left the room a few moments, when a young priest entered, one of the king's attendants.  \"Have I listened well, father?\"  he enquired of the old man.  \"Perfectly, my son.  Nothing of that which passed between Amasis and Psamtik has escaped thine ears.  May Isis preserve them long to thee!\"  \"Ah, father, a deaf man could have heard every word in the ante-chamber to-day, for Amasis bellowed like an ox.\"  \"The great Neith has smitten him with the lack of prudence, yet I command thee to speak of the Pharaoh with more reverence.  But now return, keep thine eyes open and inform me at once if Amasis, as is possible, should attempt to thwart the conspiracy against Phanes.  Thou wilt certainly find me here.  Charge the attendants to admit no one, and to say I am at my devotions in the Holy of holies.  May the ineffable One protect thy footsteps!\"       [Isis, the wife or sister of Osiris, is the phenomena of nature, by      means of which the god is able to reveal himself to human      contemplation.]                 ..................................  While Psamtik was making every preparation for the capture of Phanes, Croesus, accompanied by his followers, had embarked on board a royal bark, and was on his way down the Nile to spend the evening with Rhodopis.  His son Gyges and the three young Persians remained in Sais, passing the time in a manner most agreeable to them.  Amasis loaded them with civilities, allowed them, according to Egyptian custom, the society of his queen and of the twin-sisters, as they were called, taught Gyges the game of draughts, and looking on while the strong, dexterous, young heroes joined his daughters in the game of throwing balls and hoops, so popular among Egyptian maidens, enlivened their amusements with an inexhaustible flow of wit and humor.       [The Pharaohs themselves, as well as their subjects, were in the      habit of playing at draughts and other similar games.  Rosellini      gives its Rameses playing with his daughter; see also two Egyptians      playing together, Wilkinson II.  419.  An especially beautiful      draught-board exists in the Egyptian collection at the Louvre      Museum.  The Egyptians hoped to be permitted to enjoy these      pleasures even in the other world.]       [Balls that have been found in the tombs are still to be seen; some,      for instance, in the Museum at Leyden.]  \"Really,\" said Bartja, as he watched Nitetis catching the slight hoop, ornamented with gay ribbons, for the hundredth time on her slender ivory rod, \"really we must introduce this game at home.  We Persians are so different from you Egyptians.  Everything new has a special charm for us, while to you it is just as hateful.  I shall describe the game to Our mother Kassandane, and she will be delighted to allow my brother's wives this new amusement.\"  \"Yes, do, do!\"  exclaimed the fair Tachot blushing deeply.  \"Then Nitetis can play too, and fancy herself back again at home and among those she loves; and Bartja,\"  she added in a low voice,  \"whenever you watch the hoops flying, you too must remember this hour.\"  \"I shall never forget it,\" answered he with a smile, and then, turning to his future sister-in-law, he called out cheerfully, \"Be of good courage, Nitetis, you will be happier than you fancy with us.  We Asiatics know how to honor beauty; and prove it by taking many wives.\"  Nitetis sighed, and the queen Ladice exclaimed, \"On the contrary, that very fact proves that you understand but poorly how to appreciate woman's nature!  You can have no idea, Bartja, what a woman feels on finding that her husband--the man who to her is more than life itself, and to whom she would gladly and without reserve give up all that she treasures as most sacred--looks down on her with the same kind of admiration that he bestows on a pretty toy, a noble steed, or a well-wrought wine-bowl. But it is yet a thousand-fold more painful to feel that the love which every woman has a right to possess for herself alone, must be shared with a hundred others!\"  \"There speaks the jealous wife!\"  exclaimed Amasis.  \"Would you not fancy that I had often given her occasion to doubt my faithfulness?\"  \"No, no, my husband,\" answered Ladice, \"in this point the Egyptian men surpass other nations, that they remain content with that which they have once loved; indeed I venture to assert that an Egyptian wife is the happiest of women.       [According to Diodorus (I. 27) the queen of Egypt held a higher      position than the king himself.  The monuments and lists of names      certainly prove that women could rule with sovereign power.  The      husband of the heiress to the throne became king.  They had their      own revenues (Diodorus I. 52) and when a princess, after death, was      admitted among the goddesses, she received her own priestesses.      (Edict of Canopus.)  During the reigns of the Ptolemies many coins      were stamped with the queen's image and cities were named for them.      We notice also that sons, in speaking of their descent, more      frequently reckon it from the mother's than the father's side, that      a married woman is constantly alluded to as the \"mistress\" or \"lady\"      of the house, that according to many a Greek Papyrus they had entire      disposal of all their property, no matter in what it consisted, in      short that the weaker sex seems to have enjoyed equal influence with      the stronger.]  Even the Greeks, who in so many things may serve as patterns to us, do not know how to appreciate woman rightly.  Most of the young Greek girls pass their sad childhood in close rooms, kept to the wheel and the loom by their mothers and those who have charge of them, and when marriageable, are transferred to the quiet house of a husband they do not know, and whose work in life and in the state allows him but seldom to visit his wife's apartments.  Only when the most intimate friends and nearest relations are with her husband, does she venture to appear in their midst, and then shyly and timidly, hoping to hear a little of what is going on in the great world outside.  Ah, indeed! we women thirst for knowledge too, and there are certain branches of learning at least, which it cannot be right to withhold from those who are to be the mothers and educators of the next generation.  What can an Attic mother, without knowledge, without experience, give to her daughters?  Naught but her own ignorance.  And so it is, that a Hellene, seldom satisfied with the society of his lawful, but, mentally, inferior wife, turns for satisfaction to those courtesans, who, from their constant intercourse with men, have acquired knowledge, and well understand how to adorn it with the flowers of feminine grace, and to season it with the salt of a woman's more refined and delicate wit.  In Egypt it is different.  A young girl is allowed to associate freely with the most enlightened men. Youths and maidens"]]]
