Bartja, especially, was distressed at hearing of Nitetis' sad end, and the discovery of Amasis' fraud filled them all with astonishment.  After a short pause, Darius went on:  \"When once Nitetis' descent had been fully proved, Cambyses was like a changed man.  He called a council of war, and appeared at table in the royal robes instead of his mourning garments.  You can fancy what universal joy the idea of a war with Egypt excited.  Even Croesus, who you know is one of Amasis' well-wishers, and advises peace whenever it is possible, had not a word to say against it.  The next morning, as usual, what had been resolved on in intoxication was reconsidered by sober heads; after several opinions had been given, Phanes asked permission to speak, and spoke I should think for an hour.  But how well!  It was as if every word he said came direct from the gods.  He has learnt our language in a wonderfully short time, but it flowed from his lips like honey. Sometimes he drew tears from every eye, at others excited stormy shouts of joy, and then wild bursts of rage.  His gestures were as graceful as those of a dancing-girl, but at the same time manly and dignified.  I can't repeat his speech; my poor words, by the side of his, would sound like the rattle of a drum after a peal of thunder.  But when at last, inspired and carried away by his eloquence, we had unanimously decided on war, he began to speak once more on the best ways and means of prosecuting it successfully.\"  Here Darius was obliged to stop, as Zopyrus had fallen on his neck in an ecstasy of delight.  Bartja, Gyges and Oroetes were not less delighted, and they all begged him to go on with his tale.  \"Our army,\" began Darius afresh, \"ought to be at the boundaries of Egypt by the month Farwardin, (March) as the inundation of the Nile, which would hinder the march of our infantry, begins in Murdad (July).  Phanes is now on his way to the Arabians to secure their assistance; in hopes that these sons of the desert may furnish our army with water and guides through their dry and thirsty land.  He will also endeavor to win the rich island of Cyprus, which he once conquered for Amasis, over to our side.  As it was through his mediation that the kings of the island were allowed to retain their crowns, they will be willing to listen to his advice.  In short the Athenian leaves nothing uncared for, and knows every road and path as if he were the sun himself  He showed us a picture of the world on a plate of copper.\"  Oroetes nodded and said, \"I have such a picture of the world too.  A Milesian named Hekataeus, who spends his life in travelling, drew it, and gave it me in exchange for a free-pass.\"       [Hekataeus of Miletus maybe called \"the father of geography,\" as      Herodotus was \"the father of history.\"  He improved the map made by      Anaximander, and his great work, \"the journey round the world,\" was      much prized by the ancients; but unfortunately, with the exception      of some very small fragments, has now perished.  Herodotus assures      us, (V.  36.) that Hekataeus was intimately acquainted with every      part of the Persian empire, and had also travelled over Egypt.  he      lived at the date of our narrative, having been born at Miletus 550      B. C.  He lived to see the fall of his native city in 4966 B. C.      His map has been restored by Klausen and can be seen also in Mure's      Lan. and Lit. of Ancient Greece.  Vol. IV.  Maps existed, however,      much earlier, the earliest known being one of the gold-mines, drawn      very cleverly by an Egyptian priest, and so well sketched as to give      a pretty clear idea of the part of the country intended.  It is      preserved in the Egyptian Museum at Turin.]  \"What notions these Greeks have in their heads!\"  exclaimed Zopyrus, who could not explain to himself what a picture of the world could look like.  \"To-morrow I will show you my copper tablet, said Oroetes, but now we must allow Darius to go on.\"  \"So Phanes has gone to Arabia,\" continued Darius, \"and Prexaspes was sent hither not only to command you, Oroetes, to raise as many forces as possible, especially Ionians and Carians, of whom Phanes has offered to undertake the command, but also to propose terms of alliance to Polykrates.\"  \"To that pirate!\"  asked Oroetes, and his face darkened.  \"The very same,\" answered Prexaspes, not appearing to notice the change in Oroetes' face.  \"Phanes has already received assurances from this important naval power, which sound as if we might expect a favorable answer to my proposal.\"  \"The Phoenician, Syrian and Ionian ships of war would be quite sufficient to cope with the Egyptian fleet.\"  \"There you are right; but if Polykrates were to declare against us, we should not be able to hold our own at sea; you say yourself that he is all-powerful in the AEgean.\"  \"Still I decidedly disapprove of entering into treaty with such a robber.\"  \"We want powerful allies, and Polykrates is very powerful at sea.  It will be time to humble him, when we have used him to help us in conquering Egypt.  For the present I entreat you to suppress all personal feeling, and keep the success of our great plan alone in view.  I am empowered to say this in the king's name, and to show his ring in token thereof.\"  Oroetes made a brief obeisance before this symbol of despotism, and asked: \"What does Cambyses wish me to do?\"  \"He commands you to use every means in your power to secure an alliance with the Samian; and also to send your troops to join the main army on the plains of Babylon as soon as possible.\"  The satrap bowed and left the room with a look betraying irritation and defiance.  When the echo of his footsteps had died away among the colonnades of the inner court, Zopyrus exclaimed: \"Poor fellow, it's really very hard for him to have to meet that proud man, who has so often behaved insolently to him, on friendly terms.  Think of that story about the physician for instance.\"  \"You are too lenient,\"  interrupted Darius.  \"I don't like this Oroetes. He has no right to receive the king's commands in that way.  Didn't you see him bite his lips till they bled, when Prexaspes showed him the king's ring?\"  \"Yes,\" cried the envoy, \"he's a defiant, perverse man.  He left the room so quickly, only because he could not keep down his anger any longer.\"  \"Still,\" said Bartja, \"I hope you will keep his conduct a secret from my brother, for he has been very good to me.\"  Prexaspes bowed, but Darius said: \"We must keep an eye on the fellow. Just here, so far from the king's gate and in the midst of nations hostile to Persia, we want governors who are more ready to obey their king than this Oroetes seems to be.  Why, he seems to fancy he is King of Lydia!\"  \"Do you dislike the satrap?\"  said Zopyrus.  \"Well, I think I do,\" was the answer.  \"I always take an aversion or a fancy to people at first sight, and very seldom find reason to change my mind afterwards.  I disliked Oroetes before I heard him speak a word, and I remember having the same feeling towards Psamtik, though Amasis took my fancy.\"  \"There's no doubt that you're very different from the rest of us,\" said Zopyrus laughing, \"but now, to please me, let this poor Oroetes alone. I'm glad he's gone though, because we can talk more freely about home. How is Kassandane? and your worshipped Atossa?  Croesus too, how is he? and what are my wives about?  They'll soon have a new companion.  To- morrow I intend to sue for the hand of Oroetes' pretty daughter.  We've talked a good deal of love with our eyes already.  I don't know whether we spoke Persian or Syrian, but we said the most charming things to one another.\"  The friends laughed, and Darius, joining in their merriment, said: \"Now you shall hear a piece of very good news.  I have kept it to the last, because it is the best I have.  Now, Bartja, prick up your ears.  Your mother, the noble Kassandane, has been cured of her blindness!  Yes, yes, it is quite true.--Who cured her?  Why who should it be, but that crabbed old Nebenchari, who has become, if possible, moodier than ever.  Come, now, calm yourselves, and let me go on with my story; or it will be morning before Bartja gets to sleep.  Indeed.  I think we had better separate now: you've heard the best, and have something to dream about What, you will not?  Then, in the name of Mithras, I must go on, though it should make my heart bleed.  \"I'll begin with the king.  As long as Phanes was in Babylon, he seemed to forget his grief for Nitetis.  \"The Athenian was never allowed to leave him.  They were as inseparable as Reksch and Rustem.  Cambyses had no time to think of his sorrow, for Phanes had always some new idea or other, and entertained us all, as well as the king, marvellously.  And we all liked him too; perhaps, because no one could"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5457"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 08 (#7)"],["body","envy him.  Whenever he was alone, the tears came into his eyes at the thought of his boy, and this made his great cheerfulness --a cheerfulness which he always managed to impart to the king, Bartja,-- the more admirable.  Every morning he went down to the Euphrates with Cambyses and the rest of us, and enjoyed watching the sons of the Achaemenidae at their exercises.  When he saw them riding at full speed past the sand-hills and shooting the pots placed on them into fragments with their arrows, or throwing blocks of wood at one another and cleverly evading the blows, he confessed that he could not imitate them in these exercises, but at the same time he offered to accept a challenge from any of us in throwing the spear and in wrestling.  In his quick way he sprang from his horse, stripped off his clothes--it was really a shame--and, to the delight of the boys, threw their wrestling-master as if he had been a feather.       [In the East, nudity was, even in those days, held to be      disgraceful, while the Greeks thought nothing so beautiful as the      naked human body.  The Hetaira Phryne was summoned before the judges      for an offence against religion.  Her defender, seeing that sentence      was about to be pronounced against his client, suddenly tore away      the garment which covered her bosom.  The artifice was successful.      The judges pronounced her not guilty, being convinced that such      wondrous grace and beauty could only belong to a favorite of      Aphrodite.  Athen. XIII.  p. 590]  \"Then he knocked over a number of bragging fellows, and would have thrown me too if he had not been too fatigued.  I assure you, I am really stronger than he is, for I can lift greater weights, but he is as nimble as an eel, and has wonderful tricks by which he gets hold of his adversary.  His being naked too is a great help.  If it were not so indecent, we ought always to wrestle stripped, and anoint our skins, as the Greeks do, with the olive-oil.  He beat us too in throwing the spear, but the king, who you know is proud of being the best archer in Persia, sent his arrow farther.  Phanes was especially pleased with our rule, that in a wrestling-match the one who is thrown must kiss the hand of his victor.  At last he showed us a new exercise:--boxing.  He refused, however, to try his skill on any one but a slave, so Cambyses sent for the biggest and strongest man among the servants--my groom, Bessus--a giant who can bring the hind legs of a horse together and hold them so firmly that the creature trembles all over and cannot stir.  This big fellow, taller by a head than Phanes, shrugged his shoulders contemptuously on hearing that he was to box with the little foreign gentleman.  He felt quite sure of victory, placed himself opposite his adversary, and dealt him a blow heavy enough to kill an elephant.  Phanes avoided it cleverly, in the same moment hitting the giant with his naked fist so powerfully under the eyes, that the blood streamed from his nose and mouth, and the huge, uncouth fellow fell on the ground with a yell. When they picked him up his face looked like a pumpkin of a greenish-blue color.  The boys shouted with delight at his discomfiture; but we admired the dexterity of this Greek, and were especially glad to see the king in such good spirits; we noticed this most when Phanes was singing Greek songs and dance-melodies to him accompanied by the lute.  \"Meanwhile  Kassandane's  blindness  had  been cured, and this of course tended not a little to disperse the king's melancholy.  \"In short it was a very pleasant time, and I was just going to ask for Atossa's hand in marriage, when Phanes went off to Arabia, and everything was changed.  \"No sooner had he turned his back on the gates of Babylon than all the evil Divs seemed to have entered into the king.  He went about, a moody, silent man, speaking to no one; and to drown his melancholy would begin drinking, even at an early hour in the morning, quantities of the strongest Syrian wine.  By the evening he was generally so intoxicated that he had to be carried out of the hall, and would wake up the next morning with headache and spasms.  In the day-time he would wander about as if looking for something, and in the night they often heard him calling Nitetis.  The physicians became very anxious about his health, but when they sent him medicine he threw it away.  It was quite right of Croesus to say, as he did once 'Ye Magi and Chaldaeans! before trying to cure a sick man we must discover the seat of his disease.  Do you know it in this case?  No?  Then I will tell you what ails the king.  He has an internal complaint and a wound.  The former is called ennui, and the latter is in his heart.  The Athenian is a good remedy for the first, but for the second I know of none; such wounds either scar over of themselves, or the patient bleeds to death inwardly.'\"  \"I know of a remedy for the king though,\" exclaimed Otanes when he heard these words.  \"We must persuade him to send for the women, or at least for my daughter Phaedime, back from Susa.  Love is good for dispersing melancholy, and makes the blood flow faster.\"  We acknowledged that he was right, and advised him to remind the king of his banished wives.  He ventured to make the proposal while we were at supper, but got such a harsh rebuff for his pains, that we all pitied him.  Soon after this, Cambyses sent one morning for all the Mobeds and Chaldaeans, and commanded them to interpret a strange dream which he had bad.  In his dream he had been standing in the midst of a dry and barren plain: barren as a threshing-floor, it did not produce a single blade of grass. Displeased at the desert aspect of the place, he was just going to seek other and more fruitful regions, when Atossa appeared, and, without seeing him, ran towards a spring which welled up through the arid soil as if by enchantment.  While he was gazing in wonder at this scene, he noticed that wherever the foot of his sister touched the parched soil, graceful terebinths sprang up, changing, as they grew, into cypresses whose tops reached unto heaven.  As he was going to speak to Atossa, he awoke.  The Mobeds and Chaldaeans consulted together and interpreted the dream thus?  'Atossa would be successful in all she undertook.'  \"Cambyses seemed satisfied with this answer, but, as the next night the vision appeared again, he threatened the wise men with death, unless they could give him another and a different interpretation.  They pondered long,  and at  last answered, 'that Atossa would become a queen and the mother of mighty princes.'  \"This answer really contented the king, and he smiled strangely to himself as he told us his dream.  \"The same day Kassandane sent for me and told me to give up all thoughts of her daughter, as I valued my life.  \"Just as I was leaving the queen's garden I saw Atossa behind a pomegranate-bush.  She beckoned.  I went to her; and in that hour we forgot danger and sorrow, but said farewell to each other for ever.  Now you know all; and now that I have given her up--now that I know it would be madness even to think of her again--I am obliged to be very stern with myself, lest, like the king, I should fall into deep melancholy for the sake of a woman.  And this is the end of the story, the close of which we were all expecting, when Atossa, as I lay under sentence of death, sent me a rose, and made me the happiest of mortals.  If I had not betrayed my secret then, when we thought our last hour was near, it would have gone with me to my grave.  But what am I talking about?  I know I can trust to your secrecy, but pray don't look at me so deplorably.  I think I am still to be envied, for I have had one hour of enjoyment that would outweigh a century of misery.  Thank you,--thank you: now let me finish my story as quickly as I can.  \"Three days after I had taken leave of Atossa I had to marry Artystone, the daughter of Gobryas.  She is beautiful, and would make any other man happy.  The day after the wedding the Angare reached Babylon with the news of your illness.  My mind was made up at once; I begged the king to let me go to you, nurse you, and warn you of the danger which threatens your life in Egypt--took leave of my bride, in spite of all my father-in- law's protestations, and went off at full speed with Prexaspes, never resting till I reached your side, my dear Bartja.  Now I shall go with you and Zopyrus to Egypt, for Gyges must accompany the ambassador to Samos, as interpreter.  This is the king's command; he has been in better spirits the last few days; the inspection of the masses of troops coming up to Babylon diverts him, besides which, the Chaldaeans have assured him that the planet Adar, which belongs to their wargod Chanon, promises a great victory to the Persian arms.  When do you think you shall be able to travel, Bartja?\"  \"To-morrow, if you like,\" was the answer.  \"The doctors say the sea- voyage will do me good, and the journey by land to Smyrna is very short.\"  \"And  I can assure you,\" added Zopyrus, \"that Sappho will cure you sooner than all the doctors in the world.\"  \"Then we will start in three days;\" said Darius after some consideration, \"we have plenty to do before starting.  Remember we are going into what may almost be called an enemy's country.  I have been thinking the matter over, and it seems to me that Bartja must pass for a Babylonian carpet- merchant, I for his brother, and Zopyrus for a dealer in Sardian red.\"  \"Couldn't we be soldiers?\"  asked Zopyrus.  \"It's such an ignominious thing to be taken for cheating pedlers.  How would it be, for instance, if we passed ourselves off for Lydian soldiers, escaped from punishment, and seeking service in the Egyptian army?\"  \"That's not a bad idea,\" said Bartja, \"and I think too that we look more like soldiers than traders.\"  \"Looks and manner are no guide,\" said Gyges.  \"Those great Greek merchants and ship-owners go about as"]]]
