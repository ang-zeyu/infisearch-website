We read of Him who shall at last come to judgment, that “His fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner.” Out of the great abyss of national sin he will rescue every grain of good and honest purpose and intention. His eyes, which are as a flame of fire, penetrate at once those intricate mazes where human judgment is lost, and will save and honor at last the truly good and sincere, however they may have been involved with the evil; and such souls as have resisted the greatest temptations, and persisted in good under the most perplexing circumstances, are those of whom he has written, “And they shall be mine, saith the Lord of Hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.”  -----  Footnote 1:    The leader of the insurrection in lower Virginia, in which upwards of   a hundred white persons, principally women and children, were   massacred in cold blood.                                   CHAPTER IV.                              GEORGE HARRIS.   The character of George Harris has been represented as overdrawn, both as respects personal qualities and general intelligence. It has been said, too, that so many afflictive incidents happening to a slave are improbable, and present a distorted view of the institution.  In regard to person, it must be remembered that the half-breeds often inherit, to a great degree, the traits of their white ancestors. For this there is abundant evidence in the advertisements of the papers. Witness the following from the _Chattanooga_ (Tenn.) _Gazette_, Oct. 5th, 1852:                                $500 REWARD.  [Illustration]    Runaway from the subscriber, on the 25th May, a VERY BRIGHT MULATTO   BOY, about 21 or 22 years old, named WASH. Said boy, without close   observation, might pass himself for a white man, as he is very   bright—has sandy hair, blue eyes, and a fine set of teeth. He is an   excellent bricklayer; but I have no idea that he will pursue his   trade, for fear of detection. Although he is like a white man in   appearance, he has the disposition of a negro, and delights in comic   songs and witty expressions. He is an excellent house servant, very   handy about a hotel,—tall, slender, and has rather a down look,   especially when spoken to, and is sometimes inclined to be sulky. I   have no doubt but he has been decoyed off by some scoundrel, and I   will give the above reward for the apprehension of the boy and   thief, if delivered at Chattanooga. Or, I will give $200 for the boy   alone; or $100 if confined in any jail in the United States, so that   I can get him.                                                      GEORGE O. RAGLAND.    _Chattanooga, June 15, 1852._  From the _Capitolian Vis-a-vis_, West Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Nov. 1, 1852:                                $150 REWARD.    Runaway about the 15th of August last, _Joe_, a yellow man; small,   about 5 feet 8 or 9 inches high, and about 20 years of age. _Has a   Roman nose_, was raised in New Orleans, and _speaks French and   English_. He was bought last winter of Mr. Digges, Banks Arcade, New   Orleans.  In regard to general intelligence, the reader will recollect that the writer stated it as a fact which she learned while on a journey through Kentucky, that a young colored man invented a machine for cleaning hemp, like that alluded to in her story.  Advertisements, also, occasionally propose for sale artisans of different descriptions. Slaves are often employed as pilots for vessels, and highly valued for their skill and knowledge. The following are advertisements from recent newspapers.  From the _South Carolinian_ (Columbia), Dec. 4th, 1852:                        VALUABLE NEGROES AT AUCTION.                            BY J. & L. T. LEVIN.    WILL be sold, on MONDAY, the 6th day of December, the following   valuable NEGROES:    Andrew, 24 years of age, a bricklayer and plasterer, and thorough   workman.    George, 22 years of age, one of the best barbers in the State.    James, 19 years of age, an excellent painter.    These boys were raised in Columbia, and are exceptions to most of   boys, and are sold for no fault whatever.    The terms of sale are one-half cash, the balance on a credit of six   months, with interest, for notes payable at bank, with two or more   approved endorsers.    Purchasers to pay for necessary papers.                                                       WILLIAM DOUGLASS.    _November 27, 36._  From the same paper, of November 18th, 1852:    Will be sold at private sale, a LIKELY MAN, boat hand, and good   pilot; is well acquainted with all the inlets between here and   Savannah and Georgetown.  With regard to the incidents of George Harris’ life, that he may not be supposed a purely exceptional case, we propose to offer some parallel facts from the lives of slaves of our personal acquaintance.  Lewis Clark is an acquaintance of the writer. Soon after his escape from slavery, he was received into the family of a sister-in-law of the author, and there educated. His conduct during this time was such as to win for him uncommon affection and respect, and the author has frequently heard him spoken of in the highest terms by all who knew him.  The gentleman in whose family he so long resided says of him, in a recent letter to the writer, “I would trust him, as the saying is, with untold gold.”  Lewis is a quadroon, a fine-looking man, with European features, hair slightly wavy, and with an intelligent, agreeable expression of countenance.  The reader is now desired to compare the following incidents of his life, part of which he related personally to the author, with the incidents of the life of George Harris.  His mother was a handsome quadroon woman, the daughter of her master, and given by him in marriage to a free white man, a Scotchman, with the express understanding that she and her children were to be free. This engagement, if made sincerely at all, was never complied with. His mother had nine children, and, on the death of her husband, came back, with all these children, as slaves in her father’s house.  A married daughter of the family, who was the dread of the whole household, on account of the violence of her temper, had taken from the family, upon her marriage, a young girl. By the violence of her abuse she soon reduced the child to a state of idiocy, and then came imperiously back to her father’s establishment, declaring that the child was good for nothing, and that she would have another; and, as poor Lewis’ evil star would have it, fixed her eye upon him.  To avoid one of her terrible outbreaks of temper, the family offered up this boy as a pacificatory sacrifice. The incident is thus described by Lewis, in a published narrative:    Every boy was ordered in, to pass before this female sorceress, that   she might select a victim for her unprovoked malice, and on whom to   pour the vials of her wrath for years. I was that unlucky fellow.   Mr. Campbell, my grandfather, objected, because it would divide a   family, and offered her Moses; * * * but objections and claims of   every kind were swept away by the wild passion and shrill-toned   voice of Mrs. B. Me she would have, and none else. Mr. Campbell went   out to hunt, and drive away bad thoughts; the old lady became quiet,   for she was sure none of her blood run in my veins, and, if there   was any of her husband’s there, it was no fault of hers.   Slave-holding women are always revengeful toward the children of   slaves that have any of the blood of their husbands in them. I was   too young—only seven years of age—to understand what was going on.   But my poor and affectionate mother understood and appreciated it   all. When she left the kitchen of the mansion-house, where she was   employed as cook, and came home to her own little cottage, the tear   of anguish was in her eye, and the image of sorrow upon every   feature of her face. She knew the female Nero whose rod was now to   be over me. That night sleep departed from her eyes. With the   youngest child clasped firmly to her bosom, she spent the night in   walking the floor, coming ever and anon to lift up the clothes and   look at me and my poor brother, who lay sleeping together.   _Sleeping_, I said. Brother slept, but not I. I saw my mother when   she first came to me, and I could not sleep. The vision of that   night—its deep, ineffaceable impression—is now before my mind with   all the distinctness of yesterday. In the morning I was put into the   carriage with Mrs. B. and her children, and my weary pilgrimage of   suffering was fairly begun.  Mrs. Banton is a character that can only exist where the laws of the land clothe with absolute power the coarsest, most brutal and violent-tempered, equally with the most generous and humane.  If irresponsible power is a trial to the virtue of the most watchful and careful, how fast must it develop cruelty in those who are naturally violent and brutal!  This woman was united to a drunken husband, of a temper equally ferocious. A recital of all the physical torture which this pair contrived to inflict on a hapless child, some of which have left ineffaceable marks on his person, would be too trying to humanity, and we gladly draw a veil over it.  Some incidents, however, are presented in the following extracts:    A very trivial offence was sufficient to call forth a great burst of   indignation from this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54812"],["title","A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin (#6)"],["body","of ungoverned passions. In my   simplicity, I put my lips to the same vessel, and drank out of it,   from which her children were accustomed to drink. She expressed her   utter abhorrence of such an act by throwing my head violently back,   and dashing into my face two dippers of water. The shower of water   was followed by a heavier shower of _kicks_; but the words, bitter   and cutting, that followed, were like a storm of hail upon my young   heart. “She would teach me better manners than that; she would let   me know I was to be brought up to her hand; she would have _one_   slave that knew his place; if I wanted water, go to the spring, and   not drink there in the house.” This was new times for me; for some   days I was completely benumbed with my sorrow.                    *       *       *       *       *    If there be one so lost to all feeling as even to say that the   slaves do not suffer when _families_ are separated, let such a one   go to the ragged quilt which was my couch and pillow, and stand   there night after night, for long, weary hours, and see the bitter   tears streaming down the face of that more than orphan boy, while   with half-suppressed sighs and sobs he calls again and again upon   his absent mother.              “Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?             Hovered thy spirit o’er thy sorrowing son?             Wretch even _then_! life’s journey just begun.”  He was employed till late at night in spinning flax or rocking the baby, and called at a very early hour in the morning; and if he did not start at the first summons, a cruel chastisement was sure to follow. He says:    Such horror has seized me, lest I might not hear the first shrill   call, that I have often in dreams fancied I heard that unwelcome   voice, and have leaped from my couch and walked through the house   and out of it before I awoke. I have gone and called the other   slaves, in my sleep, and asked them if they did not hear master   call. Never, while I live, will the remembrance of those long,   bitter nights of fear pass from my mind.  He adds to this words which should be deeply pondered by those who lay the flattering unction to their souls that the oppressed do not feel the sundering of family ties.    But all my severe labor, and bitter and cruel punishments, for these   ten years of captivity with this worse than Arab family, all these   were as nothing to the sufferings I experienced by being separated   from my mother, brothers and sisters; the same things, with them   near to sympathize with me, to hear my story of sorrow, would have   been comparatively tolerable.    They were distant only about thirty miles; and yet, in ten long,   lonely years of childhood, I was only permitted to see them three   times.    My mother occasionally found an opportunity to send me some token of   remembrance and affection,—a sugar-plum or an apple; but I scarcely   ever ate them; they were laid up, and handled and wept over, till   they wasted away in my hand.    My thoughts continually by day, and my dreams by night, were of   mother and home; and the horror experienced in the morning, when I   awoke and behold it was a dream, is beyond the power of language to   describe.  Lewis had a beautiful sister by the name of Delia, who, on the death of her grandfather, was sold, with all the other children of his mother, for the purpose of dividing the estate. She was a pious girl, a member of the Baptist church. She fell into the hands of a brutal, drunken man, who wished to make her his mistress. Milton Clark, a brother of Lewis, in the narrative of his life describes the scene where he, with his mother, stood at the door while this girl was brutally whipped before it for wishing to conform to the principles of her Christian profession. As her resolution was unconquerable, she was placed in a coffle and sent down to the New Orleans market. Here she was sold to a Frenchman, named Coval. He took her to Mexico, emancipated and married her. After residing some time in France and the West Indies with him, he died, leaving her a fortune of twenty or thirty thousand dollars. At her death she endeavored to leave this by will to purchase the freedom of her brothers; but, as a slave cannot take property, or even have it left in trust for him, they never received any of it.  The incidents of the recovery of Lewis’ freedom are thus told:    I had long thought and dreamed of LIBERTY. I was now determined to   make an effort to gain it. No tongue can tell the doubt, the   perplexities, the anxiety, which a slave feels, when making up his   mind upon this subject. If he makes an effort, and is not   successful, he must be laughed at by his fellows, he will be beaten   unmercifully by the master, and then watched and used the harder for   it all his life.    And then, if he gets away, _who_, _what_ will he find? He is   ignorant of the world. All the white part of mankind, that he has   ever seen, are enemies to him and all his kindred. How can he   venture where none but white faces shall greet him? The master tells   him that abolitionists _decoy_ slaves off into the free states to   catch them and sell them to Louisiana or Mississippi; and, if he   goes to Canada, the British will put him in a _mine under ground,   with both eyes put out, for life_. How does he know what or whom to   believe? A horror of great darkness comes upon him, as he thinks   over what may befall him. Long, very long time did I think of   escaping, before I made the effort.    At length, the report was started that I was to be sold for   Louisiana. Then I thought it was time to act. My mind was made up.                    *       *       *       *       *    What my feelings were when I reached the free shore can be better   imagined than described. I trembled all over with deep emotion, and   I could feel my hair rise up on my head. I was on what was called a   _free_ soil, among a people who had no slaves. I saw white men at   work, and no slave smarting beneath the lash. Everything was indeed   _new_ and wonderful. Not knowing where to find a friend, and being   ignorant of the country, unwilling to inquire, lest I should betray   my ignorance, it was a whole week before I reached Cincinnati. At   one place where I put up, I had a great many more questions put to   me than I wished to answer. At another place, I was very much   annoyed by the officiousness of the landlord, who made it a point to   supply every guest with newspapers. I took the copy handed me, and   turned it over, in a somewhat awkward manner, I suppose. He came to   me to point out a veto, or some other very important news. I thought   it best to decline his assistance, and gave up the paper, saying my   eyes were not in a fit condition to read much.    At another place, the neighbors, on learning that a Kentuckian was   at the tavern, came, in great earnestness, to find out what my   business was. Kentuckians sometimes came there to kidnap their   citizens. They were in the habit of watching them close. I at length   satisfied them by assuring them that I was not, nor my father before   me, any slave-holder at all; but, lest their suspicions should be   excited in another direction, I added my grandfather was a   slave-holder.                    *       *       *       *       *    At daylight we were in Canada. When I stepped ashore here, I said,   sure enough, I AM FREE. Good heavens! what a sensation, when it   first visits the bosom of a full-grown man; one _born_ to bondage;   one who had been taught, from early infancy, that this was his   inevitable lot for life! Not till _then_ did I dare to cherish, for   a moment, the feeling that _one_ of the limbs of my body was my own.   The slaves often say, when cut in the hand or foot, “Plague on the   old foot” or “the old hand! It is master’s,—let him take care of it.   Nigger don’t care if he never get well.” My hands, my feet, were now   my own.  It will be recollected that George, in conversing with Eliza, gives an account of a scene in which he was violently beaten by his master’s young son. This incident was suggested by the following letter from John M. Nelson to Mr. Theodore Weld, given in _Slavery as It Is_, p. 51.  Mr. Nelson removed from Virginia to Highland County, Ohio, many years since, where he is extensively known and respected. The letter is dated January 3d, 1839.    I was born and raised in Augusta County, Virginia; my father was an   elder in the Presbyterian church, and was “owner” of about twenty   slaves; he was what was generally termed a “good master.” His slaves   were generally tolerably well fed and clothed, and not over-worked;   they were sometimes permitted to attend church, and called in to   family worship; few of them, however, availed themselves of these   privileges. On _some occasions_ I have seen him whip them severely,   particularly for the crime of trying to obtain their liberty, or for   what was called “running away.” For _this_ they were scourged more   severely than for anything else. After they have been retaken I have   seen them stripped naked and suspended by the hands, sometimes to a   tree, sometimes to a post, until their toes barely touched the   ground, and whipped with a cowhide until the blood dripped from   their backs. A boy named Jack, particularly, I have seen served in   this way more than once. When I was quite a child, I recollect it   grieved me very much to see one _tied up_ to be whipped, and I used   to intercede with tears in their behalf, and mingle my cries with   theirs, and feel almost willing to take part of the punishment; I   have been severely rebuked by my father for this kind of sympathy.   Yet, such is the hardening nature of such scenes, that from this   kind of commiseration for the suffering slave I became so blunted   that I could not only witness their stripes with composure but   _myself_ inflict them, and that without remorse.
