I remember the hill west of the barn about a hundred yards.  It wasn't a steep hill--just a gentle rise in the land.  But it was high enough to get up on and see Uncle Andrew's house and Grandma's house.  I couldn't see Grandma's house as good as I could Uncle Andrew's because hers had so many big trees all around it.  I remember we had a syrup mill too, up on the slope northwest of the barn.  We had a horse that would go round and round and make the big iron rollers squeeze the juice out of the cane stalks. The juice would run down a spout and we would catch it in buckets.  Then Mama would cook the juice in a big pan over a fire out there in the pasture.  Of course Frank and Susie and Earl would all help keep the fire going and help Papa keep putting cane stalks through the big rollers.  Joel would help a little bit, but I was just in the way.  And Albert had to be looked after too.  Sometimes the cows and horses would come and try to eat the cane and we had to put them in pens by the barn.  When we finished squeezing the juice out, we would let them all come out of the pen and eat the stalks we didn't want any more.  When we got the juice cooked enough it was good ribbon cane syrup and we would put it in big jugs and take it down in the cellar. But not all of it.  We would take some of it in the kitchen to eat.  I remember a big pile of wood and lots of mesquite posts.  They were southwest of the barn on the slope of the hill.  The wind had been blowing and lots of sand had drifted up in piles by the woodpile.  Some of our plows and wagons were out there too by the woodpile.  The posts were leaning up against big trees.  Just north of the hog pen was our stack lot with big stacks of bundled feed in it.  And when I think of the stack lot, I think of a little black horse we had named Keno, because all too often Old Keno was in the stack lot without an invitation.  He was not a big work horse, yet he could hold his own when hitched to a cultivator.  And he could outdo all the others at acrobatics.  Yes, Old Keno was a fence jumper.  We often found him in the corn patch or maize patch, what time he wasn't in the stack lot. That's probably the reason I always remember him as being fat and having a shiny coat; he got more than his share of goodies to eat.  Anyway, one time I remember seeing Old Keno in the stack lot when we were coming home from church or from Uncle Andrew's.  We drove up from the west and as we came over the rise west of the barn, there he was, in the stack lot again.  I really believe we were coming home from church because we were all dressed up and were in our new hack.  We had an old buggy and I think we had an old hack.  I think I sort of remember when we got the new hack.  The old one was good enough for everyday use, and so was the old buggy.  But for really stepping out in style, that shining black new hack was something else.  For Sunday and for going to town, we used the new one.  It had two seats, rubber tires, and a beautiful glossy black finish--with tiny little yellow pinstripes at just the right places.  When Papa hitched his two trotting horses to it, it was truly a carriage to be proud of.  We also went socializing in the new hack.  And Papa never fooled around with a walking team, they always trotted.  Even when we drove 18 miles to Anson to visit the Hood family on Sundays, our team trotted practically all the way.  And then they trotted back the same day.  As I said, Old Keno was eating more than his share of the grain from the bundles of feed, and he was wasting a lot also.  I was in the front seat with Papa and some of the other kids.  I was probably in Papa's lap, I don't remember.  Mama was in the back seat with some of the others.  In fact, Mama always rode in the back seat.  There is no picture in my memory of Mama ever riding in the front seat of our hack.  I don't really know why she chose the back seat.  Fact is, it never occurred to me until now that she may not have chosen the back seat; she may not have had a choice.  While she was with us, it never entered my mind to ask her why.  But now as I ponder these things, I wish I had.  If she were sitting here in the room with me now, I would stop writing long enough to look up and ask, \"Mama, why did you always sit in the back seat of our hack?\"  And I haven't the slightest doubt that she would answer, \"Why, Willie and you children always rode in the front seat.  There wasn't room for me.\"  Anyway, I was less than five years old, probably less than four. And I don't remember what else Mama was doing, but I'll bet a dollar she was holding Albert in her lap.  And I'll bet another dollar I can guess what Albert was doing.  Since baby bottles were almost unheard of in those days, and were not needed in our family, he was probably getting his milk from some other source, as mother nature meant for him to.  Be that as it may, Old Keno was eating at the feed stack and he seemed to be much happier than Papa was to see him there.  I don't remember what Papa said, if anything, but I do remember that Mama expressed her disapproval of Old Keno's bad manners by calling him a scoundrel.  That was the name Mama gave to troublesome animals and mean people.  There was plenty of work to be done on the farm, and we kids learned to work early in life.  Joel was just 16 months older than I was, and one spring, when he was too young to go to school, Papa had him planting in the field with a two-row planter.  In the afternoons, when Earl got home from school, he would relieve Joel, so Joel could go home and play the rest of the day.  Then one day Joel got a foot hurt and couldn't run the planter. So I had to take his place on the planter for a few days. Planting had to go on.  I don't remember how old I was at that time.  I do know for sure I was planting at the Flint place.  And we moved from that place in January--the same January in which I became five years old.  So, I must have been planting when I was a little over four years old or when I was just past three, I'm not sure which.  I am sure, however, I was older than two, because, when I was only two, Earl was too young to go to school.  If it were not for skeptics, I could go ahead with my memoirs. But I feel I should detour here and explain a thing or two, or some folks will think I am lying.  One man has already questioned my story about the two-row planter.  He thought they hadn't made a two-row planter as early as 1910.  This one happened to be a special type planter.  I have never seen but two of them in my lifetime.  But you could be sure, if William Franklin Johnson heard of a farm implement that he thought could be used to do a better job on the farm, he would get it, if at all possible.  And if it wouldn't do to suit him, he would make it do whatever he wanted it to do.  I remember having seen Papa, as early as the Flint place, mind you, using a combination cultivator-planter.  He could cultivate his young feed or cotton and, at the same time, plant new seeds in the skips where the first planting had not come up to a good stand.  He built the implement himself.  That was ingenuity.  He was my father.  This special two-row planter that I used was pulled by two big, gentle horses.  They knew how to follow the furrows and stay on the rows.  And they knew that \"whoa\" meant stop, even when a three-year-old said it.  What's more, Papa was plowing along beside me, just a few rows away, and he worked the lever and turned my team around at both ends of the rows.  Now, that doesn't sound so far out, does it?  I'll bet the people around the little town of McCaulley would believe me without an explanation.  They had a man in their community who used a dog to do his plowing for him.  It's true. And the man didn't have to be there to work the levers for him and turn the team around at the end of the rows.  There were no rows.  He was flatbreaking his ground, going round and round.  His mules followed the furrow all day long and the man only had to sit there hour after hour doing nothing.  Then he got the idea of tying his lines up and slipping off to the house without his mules knowing he was gone.  This worked well except when the mules would stop once in awhile, and he would have to go start them again.  So, next he put his little dog on the plow seat.  The dog liked to ride so well that, when the team would begin stopping, he would bark to keep them going.  People could hardly believe their eyes--the very idea--a dog plowing while his master sat on his porch in the shade.  Now, Papa didn't have a dog, so he used me.  We Texans have to be careful what we say and to whom we say it. When I start talking with a man, the first thing I want to know is, where is he from?  I know, Texans have a reputation of being big liars.  It is true, all Texans are capable of lying, but they are not all liars. They don't have to lie.  In Texas the truth is wild enough.  If I am talking with a man from north of the Mason-Dixon line, I only have to tell the truth and he thinks I am telling a big Texas lie.  But if the man is from Oklahoma, I sometimes have to lie just a little to make the story interesting to him.  Those Okies are almost as bad as Texans about story telling.  Some people think Texas is a state, but it's not.  Texas is a state of mind, an attitude, a broad open expanse of freedom and liberty known only to Texans.  It's a feeling you can never get just by living in Texas, you've got to be born in Texas.  There are other happenings dating back to the Flint place.  Here are a couple which took place before my time.  I can only relate them to you as they were told to me.  We don't know where Frank got his first taste of chewing tobacco, but he liked it and he wanted another taste.  It was only a half- mile from our house over to Uncle Andrew's.  Now, Uncle Andrew chewed tobacco and Frank knew it.  So, Frank found it easy to get Mama to let him walk over "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/542"],["title","The Life of Me: An Autobiography (#4)"],["body","to play with Ruth.  He also found it easy to ask Ruth if she knew where her dad kept his tobacco.  She knew all right, and she found it easy to \"snitch\" a chew for Frank.  She also had the forethought to make sure she took enough for both of them.  But, now that they had the tobacco in their possession, it wouldn't be smart to risk being caught playing around the house with tobacco in their mouths.  So, now Frank tells Aunt Mary he came over to see if Ruth could come over to his house and play.  Yes, Aunt Mary would allow her to go, which was a perfect set-up for five-year-old kids.  They could chew the tobacco all the way from Ruth's house over to Frank's house, just so they got rid of it before they got there. Who cares how long it might take two little kids to walk a half mile?  They could chew a long time.  However, one little problem developed.  The tobacco didn't affect Frank at all, but before they got to Frank's house, Ruth was as sick as a horse.  Naturally, they didn't dare tell why she was sick.  And she was sure she would feel better in a little while.  Another little story came to me from Susie, my older sister.  She was always having to see after the baby of the family.  At this time Albert was the baby and I was about three years old.  She probably had to take care of me also, when I was a baby.  But on this particular day--the day of the snuff--Mama, Grandma, and I went out to the garden.  Susie wanted to go but had to stay in the house with Albert.  This was one of the few times during my childhood that I was just the right size, and here I am, unable to remember a thing about it.  Susie had to tell me about it.  If I had been any smaller, I might have had to stay in the house with Susie and Albert.  And if I had been any larger, I might have had to watch after Albert while Susie went to the garden.  Anyway, Susie's brain was partly angry but mostly just idle, so the devil used it for his workshop.  Grandma had put her snuffbox on the door casing above the kitchen door.  Susie had never been allowed to taste snuff, but she reasoned that it must be something special, because Grandma \"dipped\" it all the time.  Many's the time Grandma would send me to the \"branch\" (creek) to bring her a small hackberry limb for a tooth brush.  (It was really a snuff brush.)  She would take a hackberry twig about twice as big and twice as long as a wooden match and chew on one end until it \"frazzled\" out into a bristle.  Then she would dip the damp bristle into her snuff, put it in her mouth, and work happily for hours, with the \"brush\" extending out one corner of her mouth.  Now, this picture of contentment on Grandma's face as she dipped and worked, is what the devil showed to Susie when he told her she ought to climb up on the kitchen cabinet and get her some of that delicious brown snuff in the little tin box.  She climbed up in a chair and got up on the cabinet, only to find that she couldn't reach the snuff.  But she didn't give up.  She climbed back down and put a chair up on the cabinet.  Then she climbed up in the bottom chair to get onto the cabinet so she could get up in the top chair.  And by leaning way over, she could reach the snuffbox.  Now, Susie didn't want to climb down to dip her snuff.  It would be too hard to have to climb all the way back up to put the snuff back on the shelf over the door.  So she just sat down in the upper chair and began dipping the snuff.  That's about all the story.  At least that's all she remembered. She never did know how she got down from the chairs and the cabinet.  She only remembers that, when she began to regain consciousness, she was a mighty sick little girl, and snuff had lost its charm and glitter.     CHAPTER 3  AT THE EXUM FARM AFTER I WAS FIVE  We, the Will Johnsons, owned this first farm 12 years.  Then in the fall of 1910, Papa bought the Exum farm, just east of us.  It was much larger and it fitted our needs better.  There were 332 acres in the place, and we paid $9,000 for it.  When January rolled around, it was time for us to move onto the Exum place.  And on the day we moved that half-mile, I had to stay at our old home.  I was allowed to help load the wagons at our old farm, but they wouldn't let me go with them to our new home to unload the wagons.  Of course, that hurt my feelings terribly.  But I was hurt even worse when one of the older boys came running back to the house to get a gun to kill a skunk down on the creek--and Mama wouldn't let me go with him.  She said, \"No, you can't go.  You're too little.\"  I didn't understand how Mama could be so mistaken in my size.  I was as big as most of the other boys, I thought, and smarter than some of them.  After we got moved to the new home, again Papa set out to build whatever buildings we needed to suit our wants.  There was already a house and a good size barn.  And when Papa finished building, there were shelters for tools, livestock, poultry, and a blacksmith shop.  He made a large, roomy cellar at our new home.  I can't remember ever having to go to the cellar because of a storm, but it was there just in case.  And it was good for storing fruits, vegetables, and canned goods.  One time Papa brought home a stalk of bananas and hung it down in the cellar.  Down there it would be protected from the heat of the days and the freezing nights.  Papa explained to us that we should eat the ripest bananas first before they got too ripe and had to be thrown away.  Then some of the older kids jokingly told that Papa said, \"Eat the rotten ones first and wait till the others rot to eat them.\"  We were poor in terms of money, yet we had as much as or more than the average family in our community.  Papa was a carpenter, a blacksmith, a good farmer.  And when automobiles came along, he became a mechanic.  We never left our hack out in the weather, we had a shed to shelter it.  Our barn was second to none in our neighborhood, especially by the time we finished building sheds and stalls on both sides of it.  Later on, we got a car and built a shed for it.  We didn't call it a garage, it was a car shed.  And one time Papa bought another house, moved it up beside ours, and joined them together.  We had a good well of water, a big windmill, and a cypress water tank on a tower about ten feet tall.  The tower under the tank was boarded up on all four sides to form a room that was used for keeping milk, butter, watermelons, and other things cool. Screened windows allowed the wind to pass through.  That was about the coolest place on the farm.  Next to the windmill was a garden, fenced rabbit proof and irrigated with water from the well.  Every summer we had roasting ears, popcorn, cantaloupes, watermelons, peanuts, okra, squash, pumpkins, and more kinds of beans and peas than I can name.  The barn was filled with feed heads, corn, and cottonseed, both for planting and for feeding.  There was room in the barn and adjoining sheds for horses, cows, chickens and hogs.  And up in the loft, there were peanuts still on the vines.  Some of our neighbors had given up trying to grow peanuts because rabbits ate so many of the vines.  It was all but impossible to keep the rabbits out of the patch.  But we always grew peanuts anyway.  When neighbors asked Papa how he managed to grow so many good peanuts, he told them he just planted enough for the rabbits and the youngsters too.  I can't remember when we didn't have enough peanuts in the barn loft to last all winter.  We stored them on the vines and then we picked them off as we needed them, and fed the vines to the stock.  I remember one sunny afternoon, four or five of us boys were sitting up in the barn over the horse stalls eating peanuts.  I was sitting on a board that was nailed to the underside of the ceiling joists.  Well, the nails pulled out of the board and I fell to the ground and hit my head on a wooden block.  The block proved to be tougher than my head.  It cut a two-inch gash in my scalp above my right ear.  Papa took me to our family doctor and had it sewed up.  The story was told on us boys that, when we were all little, a mule kicked one of us in the head, and that boy was never quite normal after that.  But then, as we grew older, we all got to acting so much alike that Mama and Papa couldn't tell which one of us the mule had kicked.  Many years later, during the depression of the 1930s, a neighbor was giving me a homemade haircut one Sunday afternoon and, when he discovered the scar on my head, he laughed and said, \"Now I know which one the mule kicked.\"  Now let's get back to the story of when I was a boy on the Exum farm.  I started to school when I was seven.  In fact, most kids started at seven in those days.  And since I was seven when school started in September, that meant I had been seven since last January 11th.  In other words I was almost eight.  While we lived at the Exum place, we went to school at Wise Chapel, which was about three miles northeast of our home.  In winter we faced cold northers many mornings, and in the afternoons, we often faced strong southwesterly winds on our way home.  As we walked to school, other pupils from other farms joined us, and then still others.  By the time we arrived at school, there might be as many as 20 of us in one bunch.  One of the families whose kids walked with us was the Bruner family.  Papa's younger brother, Ed, married Eva Bruner.  What do you mean, \"Did we walk that three miles to school?\"  Of course we walked--except maybe two or three times a year when the weather was extremely bad.  I might as well take time right here to mention another little incident which took place along our school trail.  It involved one of the Bruner boys.  And what happened to that boy should never happen to anyone.  But when you get that many school kids in one bunch, most anything is apt to happen, and it did this time.  In the first place, I guess school trails shouldn't cut across pastures, but they did.  In the"]]]
