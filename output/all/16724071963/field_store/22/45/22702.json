It was long past mid-day, when the attendant Mandane came to put a last touch to Nitetis' dress and ornaments.  \"She is asleep,\" thought the girl.  \"I can let her rest another quarter of an hour; the sacrifice this morning has tired her, and we must have her fresh and beautiful for the evening banquet; then she will outshine the others as the moon does the stars.\"  Unnoticed by her mistress she slipped out of the room, the windows of which commanded a splendid view over the hanging-gardens, the immense city beneath, the river, and the rich and fruitful Babylonian plain, and went into the garden.  Without looking round she ran to a flower-bed, to pluck some roses.  Her eyes were fixed on her new bracelet, the stones of which sparkled in the sun, and she did not notice a richly-dressed man peering in at one of the windows of the room where Nitetis lay weeping.  On being disturbed in his watching and listening, he turned at once to the girl and greeted her in a high treble voice.  She started, and on recognizing the eunuch Boges, answered: \"It is not polite, sir, to frighten a poor girl in this way.  By Mithras, if I had seen you before I heard you, I think I should have fainted.  A woman's voice does not take me by surprise, but to see a man here is as rare as to find a swan in the desert.\"  Boges laughed good-humoredly, though he well understood her saucy allusion to his high voice, and answered, rubbing his fat hands: \"Yes, it is very hard for a young and pretty bird like you, to have to live in such a lonely corner, but be patient, sweetheart.  Your mistress will soon be queen, and then she will look out a handsome young husband for you.  Ah, ha!  you will find it pleasanter to live here alone with him, than with your beautiful Egyptian.\"  \"My mistress is too beautiful for some people's fancy, and I have never asked any one to look out a husband for me,\" she answered pertly.  \"I can find one without your help either.\"  \"Who could doubt it?  Such a pretty face is as good a bait for a man, as a worm for a fish.\"  \"But I am not trying to catch a husband, and least of all one like you.\"  \"That I can easily believe,\" he answered laughing.  But tell me, my treasure, why are you so hard on me?  Have I done anything to vex you? Wasn't it through me, that you obtained this good appointment, and are not we both Medes?\"  \"You might just as well say that we are both human beings, and have five fingers on each hand and a nose in the middle of our faces.  Half the people here are Medes, and if I had as many friends as I have countrymen, I might be queen to-morrow.  And as to my situation here, it was not you, but the high-priest Oropastes who recommended me to the great queen Kassandane.  Your will is not law here,\"  \"What are you talking about, my sweet one?  don't you know, that not a single waiting-woman can be engaged without my consent?\"  \"Oh, yes, I know that as well as you do, but .  .  .\"  \"But you women are an unthankful race, and don't deserve our kindness.\"  \"Please not to forget, that you are speaking to a girl of good family.\"  \"I know that very well, my little one.  I know that your father was a Magian and your mother a Magian's daughter; that they both died early and you were placed under the care of the Destur Ixabates, the father of Oropastes, and grew up with his children.  I know too that when you had received the ear-rings, Oropastes' brother Gaumata, (you need not blush, Gaumata is a pretty name) fell in love with your rosy face, and wanted to marry you, though he was only nineteen.  Gaumata and Mandane, how well the two names sound together!  Mandane and Gaumata!  If I were a poet I should call my hero Gaumata and his lady-love Mandane.\"  \"I insist on your ceasing to jest in this way,\" cried Mandane, blushing deeply and stamping her foot.  \"What, are you angry because I say the names sound well together?  You ought rather to be angry with the proud Oropastes, who sent his younger brother to Rhagar and you to the court, that you might forget one another.\"  \"That is a slander on my benefactor.\"  \"Let my tongue wither away, if I am not speaking the truth and nothing but the truth!  Oropastes separated you and his brother because he had higher intentions for the handsome Gaumata, than a marriage with the orphan daughter of an inferior Magian.  He would have been satisfied with Amytis or Menische for a sister-in-law, but a poor girl like you, who owed everything to his bounty, would only have stood in the way of his ambitious plans.  Between ourselves, he would like to be appointed regent of Persia while the king is away at the Massagetan war, and would therefore give a great deal to connect himself by marriage in some way or other with the Archemenidae.  At his age a new wife is not to be thought of; but his brother is young and handsome, indeed people go so far as to say, that he is like the Prince Bartja.\"  \"That is true,\" exclaimed the girl.  \"Only think, when we went out to meet my mistress, and I saw Bartja for the first time from the window of the station-house, I thought he was Gaumata.  They are so like one another that they might be twins, and they are the handsomest men in the kingdom.\"  \"How you are blushing, my pretty rose-bud!  But the likeness between them is not quite so great as all that.  When I spoke to the high-priest's brother this morning .  .  .\"  \"Gaumata is here?\"  interrupted the girl passionately.  \"Have you really seen him or are you trying to draw me out and make fun of me?\"  \"By Mithras!  my sweet one, I kissed his forehead this very morning, and he made me tell him a great deal about his darling.  Indeed his blue eyes, his golden curls and his lovely complexion, like the bloom on a peach, were so irresistible that I felt inclined to try and work impossibilities for him.  Spare your blushes, my little pomegranate- blossom, till I have told you all; and then perhaps in future you will not be so hard upon poor Boges; you will see that he has a good heart, full of kindness for his beautiful, saucy little countrywoman.\"  \"I do not trust you,\" she answered, interrupting these assurances. \"I have been warned against your smooth tongue, and I do not know what I have done to deserve this kind interest.\"  \"Do you know this?\"  he asked, showing her a white ribbon embroidered all over with little golden flames.  \"It is the last present I worked for him,\" exclaimed Mandane.  \"I asked him for this token, because I knew you would not trust me.  Who ever heard of a prisoner loving his jailer?\"  \"But tell me at once, quickly--what does my old playfellow want me to do? Look, the-western sky is beginning to glow.  Evening is coming on, and I must arrange my mistress's dress and ornaments for the banquet.\"  \"Well, I will not keep you long,\" said the eunuch, becoming so serious that Mandane was frightened.  \"If you do not choose to believe that I would run into any risk out of friendship to you, then fancy that I forward your love affair to humble the pride of Oropastes.  He threatens to supplant me in the king's favor, and I am determined, let him plot and intrigue as he likes, that you shall marry Gaumata.  To-morrow evening, after the Tistar-star has risen, your lover shall come to see you.  I will see that all the guards are away, so that he can come without danger, stay one hour and talk over the future with you; but remember, only one hour.  I see clearly that your mistress will be Cambyses' favorite wife, and will then forward your marriage, for she is very fond of you, and thinks no praise too high for your fidelity and skill.  So to-morrow evening,\" he continued, falling back into the jesting tone peculiar to him, \"when the Tistar-star rises, fortune will begin to shine on you.  Why do you look down?  Why don't you answer?  Gratitude stops your pretty little mouth, eh? is that the reason?  Well, my little bird, I hope you won't be quite so silent, if you should ever have a chance of praising poor Boges to your powerful mistress.  And what message shall I bring to the handsome Gaumata?  May I say that you have not forgotten him and will be delighted to see him again?  You hesitate?  Well, I am very sorry, but it is getting dark and I must go.  I have to inspect the women's dresses for the birthday banquet.  Ah! one thing I forgot to mention.  Gaumata must leave Babylon to-morrow.  Oropastes is afraid, that he may chance to see you, and told him to return to Rhage directly the festival was over.  What! still silent?  Well then, I really cannot help you or that poor fellow either.  But I shall gain my ends quite as well without you, and perhaps after all it is better that you should forget one another.  Good-bye.\"  It was a hard struggle for the girl.  She felt nearly sure that Boges was deceiving her, and a voice within warned her that it would be better to refuse her lover this meeting.  Duty and prudence gained the upper hand, and she was just going to exclaim: \"Tell him I cannot see him,\" when her eye caught the ribbon she had once embroidered for her handsome playfellow.  Bright pictures from her childhood flashed through her mind, short moments of intoxicating happiness; love, recklessness and longing gained the day in their turn over her sense of right, her misgivings and her prudence, and before Boges could finish his farewell, she called out, almost in spite of herself and flying towards the house like a frightened fawn: \"I shall expect him.\"  Boges passed quickly through the flowery paths of the hanging-gardens. He stopped at the parapet end cautiously opened a hidden trap-door, admitting to a secret staircase which wound down through one of the huge pillars supporting the hanging-gardens, and which had probably been intended by their original designer as a means of reaching his wife's apartments unobserved from the shores of the river.  The door moved easily "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5454"],["title","An Egyptian Princess â€” Volume 05 (#8)"],["body","its hinges, and when Boges had shut it again and strewed a few of the river-shells from the garden walks over it, it would have been difficult to find, even for any one who had come with that purpose.  The eunuch rubbed his jeweled hands, smiling the while as was his custom, and murmured: \"It can't fail to succeed now; the girl is caught, her lover is at my beck and call, the old secret flight of steps is in good order, Nitetis has been weeping bitterly on a day of universal rejoicing, and the blue lily opens to-morrow night.  Ah, ha! my little plan can't possibly fail now.  And to-morrow, my pretty Egyptian kitten, your little velvet paw will be fast in a trap set by the poor despised eunuch, who was not allowed, forsooth, to give you any orders.\"  His eyes gleamed maliciously as he said these words and hurried from the garden.  At the great flight of steps he met another eunuch, named Neriglissar, who held the office of head-gardener, and lived at the hanging-gardens.  \"How is the blue lily going on?\"  asked Boges.  \"It is unfolding magnificently!\"  cried the gardener, in enthusiasm at the mere mention of his cherished flower.  \"To-morrow, as I promised, when the Tistar-star rises, it will be in all its beauty.  My Egyptian mistress will be delighted, for she is very fond of flowers, and may I ask you to tell the king and the Achaemenidae, that under my care this rare plant has at last flowered?  It is to be seen in full beauty only once in every ten years.  Tell the noble Achaemenidae; this, and bring them here.\"  \"Your wish shall be granted,\" said Boges smiling, \"but I think you must not reckon on the king, as I do not expect he will visit the hanging- gardens before his marriage with the Egyptian.  Some of the Archimenidae, however, will be sure to come; they are such lovers of horticulture that they would not like to miss this rare sight.  Perhaps, too, I may succeed in bringing Croesus.  It is true that he does not understand flowers or doat on them as the Persians do, but he makes amends for this by his thorough appreciation of everything beautiful.\"  \"Yes, yes, bring him too,\" exclaimed the gardener.  \"He will really be grateful to you, for my queen of the night is the most beautiful flower, that has ever bloomed in a royal garden.  You saw the bud in the clear waters of the reservoir surrounded by its green leaves; that bud will open into a gigantic rose, blue as the sky.  My flower .  .  .\"  The enthusiastic gardener would have said much more in praise of his flower, but Boges left him with a friendly nod, and went down the flight of steps.  A two-wheeled wooden carriage was waiting for him there; he took his seat by the driver, the horses, decked out with bells and tassels, were urged into a sharp trot and quickly brought him to the gate of the harem-garden.  That day was a busy, stirring one in Cambyses' harem.  In order that the women might look their very best, Boges had commanded that they should all be taken to the bath before the banquet.  He therefore went at once to that wing of the palace, which contained the baths for the women.  While he was still at some distance a confused noise of screaming, laughing, chattering and tittering reached his ears.  In the broad porch of the large bathing-room, which had been almost overheated, more than three hundred women were moving about in a dense cloud of steam.       [We read in Diodorus XVII. 77. that the king of Persia had as many      wives as there are days in the year.  At the battle of Issus,      Alexander the Great took 329 concubines, of the last Darius,      captive.]  The half-naked forms floated over the warm pavement like a motley crowd of phantoms.  Their thin silken garments were wet through and clung to their delicate figures, and a warm rain descended upon them from the roof of the bath, rising up again in vapor when it reached the floor.  Groups of handsome women, ten or twenty together, lay gossiping saucily in one part of the room; in another two king's wives were quarrelling like naughty children.  One beauty was screaming at the top of her voice because she had received a blow from her neighbor's dainty little slipper, while another was lying in lazy contemplation, still as death, on the damp, warm floor.  Six Armenians were standing together, singing a saucy love-song in their native language with clear-toned voices, and a little knot of fair-haired Persians were slandering Nitetis so fearfully, that a by-stander would have fancied our beautiful Egyptian was some awful monster, like those nurses used to frighten children.  Naked female slaves moved about through the crowd, carrying on their heads well-warmed cloths to throw over their mistresses.  The cries of the eunuchs, who held the office of door-keepers, and were continually urging the women to greater haste,--the screeching calls of those whose slaves had not yet arrived,--the penetrating perfumes and the warm vapor combined to produce a motley, strange and stupefying scene.  A quarter of an hour later, however, the king's wives presented a very different spectacle.  They lay like roses steeped in dew, not asleep, but quite still and dreaming, on soft cushions placed along the walls of an immense room. The wet perfumes still lay on their undried and flowing hair, and nimble female slaves were busied in carefully wiping away, with little bags made of soft camels' hair, the slightest outward trace of the moisture which penetrated deep into the pores of the skin.  Silken coverlets were spread over their weary, beautiful limbs, and a troop of eunuchs took good care that the dreamy repose of the entire body should not be disturbed by quarrelsome or petulant individuals.  Their efforts, however, were seldom so successful as to-day, when every one knew that a disturbance of the peace would be punished by exclusion from the banquet.  They had probably been lying a full hour in this dreamy silence, when the sound of a gong produced another transformation.  The reposing figures sprang from their cushions, a troop of female slaves pressed into the hall, the beauties were annointed and perfumed, their luxuriant hair ingeniously braided, plaited, and adorned with precious stones.  Costly ornaments and silken and woolen robes in all the colors of the rainbow were brought in, shoes stiff with rich embroidery of pearls and jewels were tied on to their tender feet, and golden girdles fastened round their waists.       [Some kings gave their wives the revenues of entire cities as      \"girdle-money\" (pin-money).]  By the time Boges came in, the greater number of the women were already fully adorned in their costly jewelry, which would have represented probably, when taken together, the riches of a large kingdom.  He was greeted by a shrill cry of joy from many voices.  Twenty of the women joined hands and danced round their smiling keeper, singing a simple song which had been composed in the harem in praise of his virtues.  On this day it was customary for the king to grant each of his wives one reasonable petition.  So when the ring of dancers had loosed hands, a troop of petitioners rushed in upon Boges, kissing his hands, stroking his cheeks, whispering in his ear all kinds of requests, and trying by flattery to gain his intercession with the king.  The woman's tyrant smiled at it all, stopped his ears and pushed them all back with jests and laughter, promising Amytis the Median that Esther the Phoenician should be punished, and Esther the same of Amytis,--that Parmys should have a handsomer set of jewels than Parisatys, and Parisatys a more costly one than Parmys, but finding it impossible to get rid of these importunate petitioners, he blew a little golden whistle. Its shrill tones acted like magic on the eager crowd; the raised hands fell in a moment, the little tripping feet stood still, the opening lips closed and the eager tumult was turned into a dead silence.  Whoever disobeyed the sound of this little whistle, was certain of punishment.  It was as important as the words \"Silence, in the king's name!\" or the reading of the riot-act.  To-day it worked even more effectually than usual.  Boges' self-satisfied smile showed that he had noticed this; he then favored the assembly with a look expressive of his contentment with their conduct, promised in a flowery speech to exert all his influence with the king in behalf of his dear little white doves, and wound up by telling them to arrange themselves in two long rows.  The women obeyed and submitted to his scrutiny like soldiers on drill, or slaves being examined by their buyer.  With the dress and ornaments of most he was satisfied, ordering, however, to one a little more rouge, to another a little white powder to subdue a too healthy color, here a different arrangement of the hair--there a deeper tinge to the eyebrows, or more pains to be taken in anointing the lips.  When this was over he left the hall and went to Phaedime, who as one of the king's lawful wives, had a private room, separated from those allotted to the concubines.  This former favorite,--this humbled daughter of the Achaemenidae, had been expecting him already some time.  She was magnificently dressed, and almost overloaded with jewels.  A thick veil of gauze inwrought with gold hung from her little tiara, and interlaced with this was the blue and white band of the Achaemenidae. There could be no question that she was beautiful, but her figure was already too strongly developed, a frequent result of the lazy harem life among Eastern women.  Fair golden hair, interwoven with little silver chains and gold pieces, welled out almost too abundantly from beneath her tiara, and was smoothed over her white temples.  She sprang forward to meet Boges, trembling with eagerness, caught a hasty glance at herself in the looking-glass, and then, fixing her eyes on the eunuch, asked impetuously: \"Are you pleased with me?  Will he admire me?\"  Boges smiled his old, eternal"]]]
