Vol. 2 (of 3) (#3)"],["body","I do not recollect any  connected with Taaffe's business among them, there may have been; for  I considered it so completely settled beyond dispute, that I should  have burnt them, unhesitatingly, had I come across any. And then,  Kate, we must bide our time.\"   \"And are there no more active steps to be taken? Could you not write  to this nephew; assure him you have paid the money, and advise him not  to expose himself to universal opprobrium by acting so base a part.\"   \"Ah, Kate, my own warm hearted child!\" said her grandfather, sadly,  \"God grant you may not have to struggle with the world of which you  are so ignorant. \"Universal opprobrium,\" is an expression frequently  and flourishingly put forth by newspaper editors; and it may be  occasionally drawn down by the singularly flagrant acts of some  public characters, but the dread of it never yet withheld any man, so  inclined, from preying on his fellows in private life; and it will  take many more years' experience to convince you how utterly fruitless  and unorthodox such a proceeding would be.\"   \"Well, grandpapa, if I am useless as a counsellor can I not be an  agent and assist you in your search.\"   \"Yes, send away the breakfast things and tell nurse to bring me the  tin box, and oak brass-bound cabinet that are in my room; make Susan  help her, they are too heavy for her unassisted strength.\"   True to his character, D'Arcy Vernon had room in his heart to think  for another, though borne down by the weight of a deeper anxiety  than he had ever felt before. His former reverse of fortune, obliged  him to renounce the pomps and vanities of high life, and soon custom  proved them to be, trifles indeed; but here was a question involving  the possibility, nay he could scarcely hide it from himself, the  probability of beggary.   \"Athen, mavourneen; it's the sore heart's within me this day to be  carryin down thim onlooky boxes; sure, I ses to meself the minit I set  eyes on that big baste iv a blue letther, faith mee dhrame's out sure  enough; an it's not for the likes iv mee to be spaken to quolity, but  it was just on the tip iv mee tongue to say 'throw it in the fire,  Kurnel jewel, an don't meddle or make with the likes iv it at all, at  all.' Sure I knew at oncet it kem from Moore's place, be the look iv  it. Oh, what was in it, good or bad Miss Kate, avourneen?\"   Nurse was too old and devoted a friend to be excluded from the  family councils, and Miss Vernon was too well acquainted with her  affectionate self-forgetful nature to consider her question intrusive.   \"Only some business, dear nurse; it may be troublesome or may not, but  cannot be avoided, even by your good advice; so just bring down the  boxes, and you shall hear more when I have more to tell, and, nurse,\"  turning back from the dining-room door, \"should Mr. Winter or Mr.  Gilpin, or any one call, you had better say that grandpapa and I are  particularly engaged.\"   \"The Lord look down on me!\" soliloquised Mrs. O'Toole, as she crossed  herself, with an air of alarm, \"not see Winther nor the crather iv an  Organist. Faith there is throuble gotherin sure enough, I knew be the  darlint's two eyes there was throuble in her heart this week past;  sure we were too long quiet an happy, that thim divils iv attorneys  should remember us. I'll go bail, it was thim that druv the captin  off to that murtherin hot counthry, an I thinkin he an mee sweet  child id make it up betune thim. The masther's as innocent as a lamb,  but lave ould nurse alone for seein as far into a mill stone as her  naybors ow wow; many a time, I seen him takin the full iv his eye,  out iv her, an I removin the tay things. Och! bud it's the wearisome  world! Susy yer idle gowk, are ye goin to lave me to pull the arrums  out of mee, liftin a ton weight here, widout puttin a finger to help  me?\"   And diligently did the Colonel and his granddaughter untie, read, and  examine, and re-tie the numerous bundles of papers and letters.   Now a packet in Lady Desmond's clear firm writing was laid aside, now  a smaller one in Kate's own hand; rapturous letters, describing the  enjoyments of her memorable visit to London, the only time she had  ever been away from her grandfather; now turning over large yellow  parchments, with red seals hanging from them, now eagerly examining a  pile of papers whose crabbed writing bespoke business. It was weary  work; Kate, with all the hopeful energy of youth, rapidly searching  through each of the packets at all likely to contain a solicitor's  letter, and handing them to her grandfather, who, latterly, leaned  wearily back in his chair, and examined them languidly. Once his arm  stole round her, as she knelt beside the pile of papers on the floor,  and she felt how eloquent of despondency, was the close embrace with  which he held her to him; but she constrained herself to receive it  in silence, and took no further notice than to kiss, warmly, the hand  which pressed her to his heart, as the last and best treasure left him.   \"You are tired and cold,\" said she, rising, \"I will stir the fire, and  then, come and put your feet on the fender, and I will replace these  packets we have examined in the box, and open all Lady Desmonds'  letters, some such paper may have got among them.\"   \"As you like, as you like, my dear child.\"   There was a long silence, broken only by the rustling of the papers.  Half an hour elapsed, and at length Vernon, rousing himself, said--   \"Do not tire yourself longer, give me my desk, I had better tell Moore  there is not a symptom here of what we want.\"   \"Wait a very little longer, there is only one packet more, of  Georgina's; let us not give up too soon, dear grandpapa.\" A few  minutes after she came over to him with an old-looking letter in her  hand. \"This is signed, 'A. Taaffe,' look at it.\"   Vernon took it eagerly.   \"Ha, this may be useful, how could it have got among Georgina's  letters?\"   Kate read over his shoulder.                                          \"_Anne Street, June, 23, 18--._    \"DEAR SIR,   \"I have just received yours of the 21st, with its enclosure, many  thanks for your obliging efforts to comply with my wishes.   \"I have directed my solicitor to prepare the necessary warrants, they  will be ready by Monday or Tuesday at farthest, when I will execute  them and send them to you,                                      \"Your obliged and obedient servant,                                                              \"A. TAAFFE.        \"To Colonel Vernon, &c.\"  \"Victoria! Dearest of grandfathers will not that utterly annihilate Mr. Taaffe?\"  \"Well, I think it must be sufficient; thank Heaven, my love, you thought of searching among Georgy's letters; now I must write immediately, to Moore, and I have scarce time. You can put away all these papers.\"  With a lightened heart Kate prepared to obey, and so visible was the change from darkness to light, in her countenance, that nurse exclaimed, on receiving from her the letter for the post.  \"Faith, an sure, Miss Kate, you've been makin the masther tell Misther Moore to hold his prate an lave off pinin' any more of his three an four pinnys to him.\"  \"No; not exactly that nurse, but I think we shall soon have done with him.\"  \"The Lord send! And I forgot to tell ye, Mr. Winther called; an faith, I could hardly keep him from walkin' in, widout 'by yer lave or wid yer lave,' an thin he kim back wid that bit iv a note.\"  \"Thank you, now run to the post-office, dear nurse. An invitation to tea from Mr. Winter,\" said Kate, returning to the dining-room, where the Colonel was putting away his writing materials. \"Do you feel equal to it?\"  \"Decidedly, my dear--I want to have a little kindly, honesty, after having had a scoundrel before my mind's eye all the morning; we will go and have a rubber, and a song. How poor Egerton used to enjoy our little parties.\"  \"And how much more he would enjoy horse-whipping, Mr. Taaffe,\" cried Kate, as she locked the tin box.  \"I believe he would,\" said the Colonel, laughing. \"You and Egerton certainly understood each other.\"     CHAPTER II.  UNCERTAINTY.   Welcome indeed was the gleam of hope, afforded by this discovery, to the Colonel and Kate.  To their non-legal minds, it appeared that any acknowledgment of money received, was sufficient, although no sum was mentioned; and Kate even felt remorse for her hasty condemnation of Mr. Taaffe; as she concluded the production of the newly found letter, would settle the question at once, and for ever, and draw forth an humble apology from the offender; her spirits rose even above their usual height, and overleaping, with the sanguine vivacity of her age and race, all intervening probabilities, she revelled in her anticipated visit to Italy, and spent many a pleasant half-hour in endeavouring to overcome nurse's inveterate antipathy to \"thim rampagin divils, the Frinch\" (under which name she classed all foreign nations and foreigners), and in exercising her powers of persuasion to induce the Winters and Gilpin to join in the pilgrimage.  \"You know we would not travel in any extravagant style, _Caro Maestro_,\" she said, to Winter, as they were enjoying an April day, which seemed to have borrowed the balmy air of early summer. They had crossed the ferry, and were strolling side by side, her tall, graceful form, and elastic step, contrasting strongly with his stout puffy figure.  \"You had better tie a knapsack on your shoulder at once, and trudge it--humph! ha! not so fast if you please--you walked me up that hill at a killing pace.  \"But seriously--let us consider the best method of setting to work, for you cannot think how eagerly I look forward to the journey; and if we go cheaply to work, Mr. Gilpin might join us, and--\"  \"_Signorina Carrissima_, yes! I want to speak seriously,\" replied Winter, in a kinder accents than usual. \"Are you not too sanguine about this journey, You make too little of the law's uncertainties. Mr. Moore's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53356"],["title","Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 2 (of 3) (#4)"],["body","seem to promise well, as you read them. Your grandfather and I see only, and at best, the promise of a long, perhaps ruinous litigation. I felt so convinced that this will be the case, that, from the first, I strongly advised Colonel Vernon to endeavour to effect a compromise. It is true you have not much to divide, but remember _chi lascia il poco per haver l'assai nè l'uno nè l'altro avera mai_,\". I see I am acting as usual like a brute,\" he continued, thickly. \"I intended to say all this by degrees, and tenderly--but I plunged into it at last too abruptly. My dear child, it cuts me to the heart, to hear you anticipating such unalloyed enjoyment, and forming such plans, when perhaps the reverse is before you; and I fancy your grandfather feels somewhat as I do, though he is more sanguine than I am.\"  They walked on a few paces, in silence--Kate's color varying, and her heart, after feeling, for a second or two, to stand still (at this sudden and rude shock, to her bright dreams), throbbing as though it would burst its prison.  \"_Bella mia_, dear child, are you angry with me?\" cried Winter anxiously. \"Why do you not speak?\"  \"Simply, kind friend,\" returned she, putting her arm through his, \"because I could not--angry with you? no; I am obliged to you,\" she added, with an effort to smile. \"And now tell me all you think, and what we ought to do.\"  \"Humph! you _are_ a good girl; you see, my dear, it is more than a month since this business began; if it could have been settled quickly, it would be settled before this, and successful or unsuccessful, a chancery suit is ruin. There, you had better know it all.\"  \"And are we absolutely embarked in this ruinous course?\" asked Kate, faintly.  \"I fear so. Did you not see Moore's last letter.\"  \"No; grandpapa said there was nothing new in it.\"  \"Ha! a mistaken tenderness; there certainly was nothing new in it; but the plot thickens; and, I fear there is no case at present, to preven Mr. Taaffe proceeding to revive the judgment, and ultimately obtain a receiver over your grandfather's remaining property.\"  \"A receiver--what for?\"  \"To receive the rents in payment of the debt, if debt there be.\"  \"What, all of them?\"  \"Yes all; but, do not be too much cast down, remember you have, few, but friends sincere; who will stick by you, and--\"  \"Dear Mr. Winter, let us be silent for a moment, I want to collect my thoughts.\"  They walked on in silence for some time.  \"Then from what you tell me, before long we may be left quite penniless! Are you sure that this is a true picture of our case? and that your hatred of law does not color it!\"  \"Heaven grant your conjecture may be right,\" cried Winter. \"I only tell you my own, and I think your grandfather's, real view of the matter. I have been long wishing for an opportunity to do so. I dreaded the effect of the shock on your sensitive and imaginative nature, and intended to have broken it to you gradually.\"  \"But,\" continued Kate, not noticing the latter part of his speech, \"shall we have nothing left? no money at all! good God! And grandpapa, what am I to do for him--and nurse? Do not think me very weak, but I cannot help the terror I feel.\"  \"Miss Vernon, I vow to Heaven, I only intended just to prepare you a little for the worst; perhaps matters may not be so bad as your alarmed imagination paints. My great object in speaking thus to you is to show the necessity for endeavouring to effect a compromise, or at least, to come to some understanding with your grandfather as to future plans, you cannot look about you too soon; I know the first shock of a thing of this kind is terrible--but you are not one of those cowards who defer looking danger in the face, until it is too late.\"  \"Yes, I know, but what plan can we possibly think of, if we are to have all our money taken from us, what are we to do?\"  \"Dear child, be prepared for it. I would in the first place, begin at once to curtail every possible outlay--look out for a tenant for the Priory. Take a smaller, humbler abode, or, a thousand times better, make our house your home, till matters are more decided.\"  \"Always kind and good,\" murmured Kate, \"and there is nothing more you would suggest?\"  \"No; except to speak freely of it all to the Colonel, and, by so doing, creep into his complete confidence.\"  \"Oh! Mr. Winter,\" cried Kate, with an irrepressible burst of tears, \"and is this to be his end? I always hoped that something, I knew not what would happen to restore him to his old position; and now to think of his being obliged to live and end his days in some mean and unsightly place.\"  \"Courage Kate--you know not what good may be hidden up in store for you, behind this sterner dispensation; I have experienced severe poverty, and I tell you, none but those who have felt it, can know how few, how simple, and yet, how satisfying are the wants and pleasures of life.\"  \"For you and I, yes; but for grandpapa, at his age, after youth and manhood spent in the possession and enjoyment of wealth and a dignified proposition.\"  \"If I mistake not, Colonel Vernon's greatest concern will be on your account, and if he sees you content, or at least, resigned, he will be the same.\"  \"Well, we can say no more now; I feel how necessary it was, I should be roused from my false security, and that you have acted as a true friend in undertaking, what I know, must have been so painful a task. I must try and think clearly and deeply; and will speak to you about my cogitations; meanwhile, as we shall soon be home, let us change the subject, and I will endeavour to recover my serenity before I meet grandpapa.\"  Winter pressed the hand she held out to him, with a feeling of sincere respect and admiration, for the manner in which she had borne his communications, and an earnest wish that the platform, at the next Jews' meeting, might prove insecure, and so open the ranks of the peerage to Fred Egerton--  \"Though,\" he added, mentally, \"there is no knowing the effects of prosperity on him.\"  \"Is grandpapa at home, nurse?\" asked Kate.  \"No, miss, he said he felt lonesome, and walked out to see Mr. Gilpin.\"  Thankful for a few minutes' solitary reflection, she ran to her room, and hastily fastening the door, threw herself into a chair--not to think, that would be by no means a correct term to apply to the confusion of ideas, and images, which presented themselves to her mind; some most foreign to the subject of the conversation with Winter. Dungar, and her early days, with their bright anticipations rose painfully clear before her eyes--the dreadful possibility of seeing her grandfather in poverty--and the insurmountable difficulty of making nurse understand the necessity for retrenchment--the distressing consciousness of the necessity to think deeply, struggling with the impossibility of fixing her thoughts; and a dim feeling that an impassable barrier was about to be raised between her and the class of which Fred Egerton was a representative.  All these and a thousand more undefined, shadowy, outlines swept across her mind, while she sat so still that she felt the throbbing of her heart, as if echoed in her head, and she could almost almost hear the pulses that vibrated through her slight frame.  Frightened at this continued rebellion of her thoughts, against her will, she threw herself on her knees, silently laying the painful chaos before the Almighty ruler and searcher of hearts!  \"If accepted as coming from God,\" she murmured, \"and therefore good, nothing is unbearable, Mr. Gilpin says, and he is right; perhaps we may succeed in this business after all, though I feel quite hopeless, after what Mr. Winter has said--but if we have no money, could I not earn it? I have a good knowledge of music--ah, delightful! how proud I should be, to earn it for grandpapa, who has always taken such care of me; and nurse would not mind it much. I like teaching. Ah! we may be happy yet--I must speak to Mr. Winter about it. Ah! nurse's dream may come true, but by contraries, after all; who can tell what strength love, and God's good help may lend even to these weak arms,\" and she stretched them out. \"Enough to support dear grandpapa, perhaps--that would be a proud achievement!\" she said almost aloud, as a feeling of quiet courage swelled her heart.  She proceeded to bathe her eyes and make her simple toilette, interrupted, it is true, by a delicious vision that would intrude itself, of Fred Egerton wealthy and powerful, flying to save her and hers, and interposing the shield of his affectionate care between them and every earthly ill; in vain she chided herself for so far-fetched a thought; instinctively she felt how readily and rapturously he would perform such a part; and however impressively she told herself she was absurd and visionary the idea would return. It was the nearest approach to love that had ever connected itself with him in her mind, and his image, once invested with this hue, never again lost it.  There has been so much said, and said with eloquence, pathos and truth, of the heroism of every day life, that I fear to approach ground already so well occupied; yet I cannot pass, in silence, the resolution with which Kate calmed herself to meet her grandfather at dinner; and, her attention now fully roused, preserved that composure even while observing a thousand minute indications of despondency, which cut her to the heart.  \"Shall I speak to him of business to-night?\" she asked herself more than once; anxious to begin that line of conduct which Winter had pointed out to be her duty; and, each time as she looked at the worn expression of that beloved and venerated face, her heart answered, \"No, not to-night, let him have a good night's rest, and to-morrow, to-morrow, I will unflinchingly approach the subject.\"  So she brought him his footstool and moved his chair to the right angle with the fire.  \"Are you quite well darling?\" said he, gazing up at her as she arranged a cushion at his back, \"I thought you"]]]
