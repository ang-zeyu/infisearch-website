SUMMARY.  [This enumerates the steps of the argument, in the foregoing chapter, in as condensed a form as possible.]   CHAPTER IV.  OF A STATE OF PROBATION.  The doctrine of probation comprehends several particulars. But the most common notion is that our future interests are _depending_; and depending on _ourselves_. And that we have _opportunities_ for both good and bad conduct, and _temptations_ to each.  This is not exactly the same as our being under moral government; for it implies allurement to evil, and difficulties in being good.  Hence needs to be considered by itself.   _Doctrine._ THE NATURAL GOVERNMENT OF GOD, IN THIS WORLD, PUTS US ON TRIAL AS TO THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD; AND SO IMPLIES, WHAT RELIGION TEACHES, THAT HIS MORAL GOVERNMENT PUTS US ON TRIAL AS TO A FUTURE WORLD.   I. _So far as we are tempted to do what will damage our future temporal interests, so far we are under probation as to those interests._    =1.= The annexing of pleasures and pains to actions, as good or   bad, and enabling us to foresee their effect, implies that our   interests, in part at least, depend on ourselves.    =2.= We often _blame_ ourselves and others for evils, as   resulting from misconduct.    =3.= It is very certain that we often miss possible good, and   incur evils, not for want of knowing better, but through our   _fault_.    =4.= Every one speaks of the hazards of young persons, from other   causes than ignorance.   II. _These natural or temporal trials are analogous to our moral and religious trial._    =1.= In both cases, what constitutes the trial, is either in our   circumstances or in our nature.      1.) Some would do right but for violent or extraordinary     temptations.      2.) Others will _seek_ evil, and go out of their way after     wicked indulgence, when there are no external temptations.      3.) But even those who err through temptation, must have that     within which makes them _susceptible_ of temptation.      4.) So that we are in a like state of probation with respect to     both present and future interests.    =2.= If we proceed to observe how mankind behave in both   capacities, we see the same analogy.      1.) Some scarcely look beyond the present gratification.      2.) Some are driven by their passions against their better     judgment and feeble resolutions.      3.) Some shamelessly go on in open vice.      4.) Some persist in wrong-doing, even under strong     apprehensions of future misery.    =3.= The analogy is no less plain in regard to the influence of   others upon us.      1.) Bad example.      2.) Wrong education.      3.) Corruptions of religion.      4.) General prevalence of mistakes as to true happiness.    =4.= In both cases negligence and folly bring difficulty as well   as vice.   III. _The disadvantages we labor under from our fallen and disordered state, are the same, in relation to both earthly and future interests._  This disadvantage affords no ground of complaint; for,    =1.= We _may_ manage to pass our days in comfort and peace.    =2.= And so may we obtain the security and comfort of religion.    =3.= We might as well complain that we are not a higher order of   beings.   REMARKS.    =1.= It is thus proved that the state of trial, which religion   says we are in, is credible; for it exactly corresponds to what   we see.      1.) If from birth till death we were in a constant security     of enjoyment, without care or correctness, it would be a     presumption against religion.      2.) It might, if we had no experience, be urged that an     infinitely good Being would not expose us to the hazard of     misery. This is indeed a difficulty, and must remain so; but     still the course of nature is as it is.      3.) The miseries which we bring on ourselves are no more     unavoidable than our deportment.    =2.= It has been proved that we are in danger of miscarrying as   to our interests, both present and future.    =3.= The sum of the whole is, that as we do not have present   enjoyments and honors forced upon us, in spite of misconduct, so   this _may_ be the case, as to that chief and final good which   religion proposes.   CHAPTER V.  PROBATION INTENDED FOR MORAL DISCIPLINE AND IMPROVEMENT.  Why we should be placed in the condition spoken of in the last chapter, is a question which cannot be answered. It may be that we could not understand, if told. And if we could, it might injure us to know, just now. It certainly is consistent with God’s righteous government.  Religion tells us that we are so placed in order to become qualified for a better state.  This, though a very partial answer to the inquiry _why_ we are so placed, answers an infinitely more important question,--viz.: _What is our business here?_   I. _We are placed in this state of trial, for our improvement in virtue, as the requisite qualification for future security and happiness._    =1.= Every creature is designed for a particular way of life.      1.) Happiness depends on the congruity between a creature’s     nature and its circumstances.      2.) Man’s character might be so changed as to make him     _incapable_ of happiness on earth.      3.) Or he might be placed, without changing his nature, in a     world where he must be wretched, for want of the proper objects     to answer to his desires.      4.) So that without determining what is the future condition of     good men, we know there must be necessary _qualifications_ to     make us capable of enjoying it.    =2.= Human beings are so constituted as to become fit for new and   different conditions.      1.) We not only acquire ideas, but store them up.      2.) We can become more expert in any kind of action.      3.) And can make settled alterations in our tempers.      4.) We can form _habits_--both bodily and mental.      As these operate in producing radical changes in human     character, we will look for a moment at the process.        --Neither perceptions, nor knowledge, are habits; though       necessary to _forming_ them.        --There are habits of perception, however, and habits of       action: the former are passive, the latter active.        --Habits of body are produced by external acts, and habits of       mind by the exertion of principles; _i.e._ carrying them out.        --Resolutions to do well are acts, and may _help_ towards       forming good habits. But _mere_ theorizing, and forming       pictures in the mind, not only do not help, but may harden       the mind to a contrary course.        --Passive impressions, by repetition grow weaker. Thus       familiarity with danger lessens fear.        --Hence active habits may be formed and strengthened, by       acting according to certain motives or excitements, which       grow less sensibly felt and less and less felt, as the habit       strengthens.          · Thus the sight of distress excites the passive emotion         of pity, and the active principle of benevolence. But         inquiring out cases of distress in order to relieve them,         causes diminished sensitiveness at the sight of misery, and         stronger benevolence and aptitude in relieving it.          · So admonition, experience, and example, if acted upon,         produce good; if not, harden.      5.) The formation of a habit may be imperceptible and even     inexplicable, but the thing itself is matter of certain     experience.      6.) A habit once formed, the action becomes easy and often     pleasurable: opposite inclinations grow weaker: difficulties     less: and occasions more frequent.      7.) Thus, a new character, in several respects, is formed.    =3.= We should not have these capacities for improvement and for   the reconstruction of character, if it were not necessary.      1.) They are necessary, even as to this life.        --We are not qualified, at first, for mature life:       understanding and strength come gradually.        --If we had them in full, at birth, we should at first be       distracted and bewildered, and our faculties would be of no       use previous to experience. Ignorant of any employment, we       could not provide for ourselves.        --So that man is an unformed, unfinished creature, even as       to this world, till he _acquire_ knowledge, experience, and       habits.      2.) Provision is made for our acquiring, in youth, the     requisite qualities for manhood.        --Children _learn_, from their very birth,          · The nature and use of objects.          · The subordinations of domestic life.          · The rules of life.        --Some of this learning is acquired so insensibly, as to seem       like instinct, but some requires great care and labor, and       the doing of things we are averse to.        --According as we act during this formative period, is our       character formed; and our capacity for various stations in       society determined.        --Early opportunities lost, cannot be recovered.      3.) Our state of discipline throughout this life, for another,     is exactly of the same kind: and comprehended under one general     law.        --If we could not see how the present discipline fitted us       for a higher life, it would be no objection.          · We do not know how food, sleep, &c. enlarges the         child’s body; nor would we expect such a result, prior to         experience.          · Nor do children understand the need of exercise,         temperance, restraint, &c.        --We thus see a general analogy of Providence indicating that       the present life is preparatory.    =4.= If virtue is a necessary qualification for future happiness,   then we see our need of the moral culture of our present state.      1.) Analogy indicates that our future state will be social.        --Nature furnishes no shadow of unreasonableness in the       Scripture doctrine that this future community will be under       the more immediate"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53346"],["title","The Analogy of Religion to the Constitution and Course of Nature (#8)"],["body","of God.        --Nor the least proof that its members will not require the       exercise of veracity, justice, &c. towards each other; and       that character which _results_ from the practice of such       virtues.        --Certainly the universe is under moral government; and a       virtuous character must, in some way, be a condition of       happiness in that state.      2.) We are deficient, and in danger of deviating from what is     right.        --We have desires for outward objects.        --The times, degrees, &c. of gratifying these desires, are,       of right, subject to the control of the moral principle.        --But that principle neither excites them, nor prevents their       being excited.        --They may exist, when they cannot be lawfully gratified, or       gratified at all.        --When the desire exists, and the gratification is unlawful,       we are tempted.      3.) The only security is the principle within.        --The strengthening of this lessens the danger.        --It may be strengthened, by discipline and exercise.          · Noting examples.          · Attending to the right, and not to preference.          · Considering our true interests.        --When improved, it becomes, in proportion to its strength,       our security from the dangers of natural propensions.        --Virtue, become habitual by discipline, is improved virtue;       and improved virtue must produce increased happiness, if the       government of the world is moral.      4.) Even creatures made upright may fall.        --The fall of an upright being, is not accounted for by the       nature of liberty; for that would only be saying that an       event happened because it might happen.        --But from the very nature of propensions.        --A finitely perfect being would have propensions       corresponding to its surroundings; its understanding; and its       moral sense; and all these in due proportions.        --Such a being would have propensions, though the object       might not be present, or the indulgence might be contrary to       its moral sense; and this would have some tendency, however       small, to induce gratification.        --The tendency would be increased by the frequency of       occasions; and yet more by the least indulgence, even in       thought; till, under peculiar conjunctures, it would become       effect.        --The first transgression might so utterly disorder the       constitution, and change the proportions of forces, as to       lead to a repetition of irregularities; and hence to the       construction of bad habits, and a depraved character.      5.) On the contrary, a finitely perfect being may attain higher     virtue, and more security, by obeying the moral principle.        --For the danger would lessen, by the increased       submissiveness of propensions.        --The moral principle would gain force by exercise.      6.) Thus vice is not only criminal, but degrading; and virtue     is not only right, but improving.        --The degree of improvement may be such that the danger of       sinning may be almost infinitely lessened.        --Yet the security may always be the habits formed in a       state of discipline; making such a state altogether fit and       necessary.      7.) This course of reasoning is vastly stronger when applied to     fallen and corrupt creatures.        --The upright need improvement; the fallen must be renewed.        --Discipline is expedient for the one; necessary for the       other; and of a severer sort.   II. _The present world is peculiarly fit for such discipline as we need._    =1.= Surrounding evils tend to produce moderation, practical   knowledge, &c. very different from a mere speculative knowledge   of our liability to vice and misery.    =2.= Our experience in this world, with right views and practice,   may leave eternal impressions for good.    =3.= Every act of self-government in the exercise of virtue,   must, from the very make of our nature, form habits of virtue,   and a more intense virtuous principle.    =4.= Resolute and persevering resistance to particular and   violent temptations, is a _continued_ act of virtue, and that in   a _higher degree_ than if the seduction were transient and weak.    =5.= Self-denial is not essential to virtue, but is almost   essential to discipline and improvement.      1.) Because actions materially virtuous, which have no     difficulty, but agree with our inclinations, may be done merely     from inclination, and so not be _really_ virtuous.      2.) But when they are done in face of danger and difficulty,     virtuousness is increased, and confirmed into a habit.    _Objec._ 1. As our intellectual or physical powers may be   overtasked, so may our moral.      _Ans._ This may be so in exceptional cases, but it does not     confute the argument. In general, it holds good. All that is     intended to be proved is, that this world is _intended_ to be a     state of improvement, and is _fitted_ for it.        1.) Some sciences which of themselves are highly improving,       require a trying measure of attention, which some will not       submit to.        2.) It is admitted that this world disciplines many to vice:       but this viciousness of many is the very thing which makes       the world a virtuous discipline to good men. The _whole end_       in placing mankind as they are we know not; but these things       are evident--the virtues of some are exercised:--and so       exercised as to be improved: and improved beyond what they       would be in a perfectly virtuous community.        3.) That all, or even the generality, do not improve, is no       proof that their improvement was not _intended_. Of seeds and       animals not one in a million comes to perfection; yet such       as do, evidently answer an end for which they were designed.       The _appearance of waste_ in regard to seeds, &c. is just as       unaccountable, as the ruin of moral agents.    _Objec._ 2. Rectitude arising from hope and fear, is only the   discipline of self-love.      _Ans._ Obedience _is_ obedience, though prompted by hope or     fear: and a _course_ of such obedience, forms a habit of     it: and distinct habits of various virtues, by repressing     inclination whenever justice, veracity, &c. require.      Beside, veracity, justice, regard to God’s authority, and     self-interest, are coincident; and each, separately, a just     principle. To begin a good life from either of them, and     persist, produces that very character which corresponds to our     relations to God, and secures happiness.    _Objec._ 3. The virtues requisite for a state of afflictions,   and produced by it, are not wanted to qualify us for a state of   happiness.      _Ans._ Such is not the verdict of experience. Passive     submission is essential to right character. Prosperity itself     begets extravagant desires; and imagination may produce as much     discontent as actual condition. Hence, though we may not need     _patience_ in heaven, we shall need that _temper_ which is     formed by patience.      Self-love would always coincide with God’s commands, when     our interest was rightly understood; but it is liable to     error. Therefore, HABITS of resignation are necessary, for     _all_ creatures; and the proper discipline for resignation is     affliction.    _Objec._ 4. The trouble and danger of such discipline, might have   been avoided by making us at once, what we are intended to become.      _Ans._ What we are to be, is the effect of what we are to     do. God’s natural government is arranged not to save us from     trouble or danger, but to enable and incline us to go through     them. It is as natural for us to seek means to obtain things,     as it is to seek the things; and in worldly things we are left     to our choice, whether to improve our powers and so better our     condition, or to neglect improvement and so go without the     advantage.      Analogy, therefore, makes the same arrangement credible, as to     a future state.   III. _This state of discipline may be necessary for the display of character._    =1.= Not to the all-knowing Being, but to his creation, or part   of it, and in many ways which we know not.    =2.= It may be a _means_ in disposing of men according to   character.    =3.= And of showing creation that they are so disposed of.    =4.= Such display of character certainly contributes, largely, to   the general course of things considered in this chapter.   CHAPTER VI.  OF NECESSITY AS INFLUENCING CONDUCT.  Fatalists have no right to object to Christianity, for they of course hold the doctrine to be compatible with what they see in nature.  The question is, whether it be not equally compatible with what Christianity teaches.  To argue on the supposition of so great an absurdity as necessity, is puzzling; and the obscurity and puzzle of the argument must therefore be excused.   I. _Necessity does not destroy the proof of an intelligent Author and Governor of the world._    =1.= It does not exclude design and deliberation.      1.) This is matter of actual experience and consciousness.        --Necessity does not account for the _existence_ of any       thing, but is only a _circumstance_ relating to its origin.       Instance the case of a house: the fatalist admits that it had       a builder, and the only question would be, was he obliged to       build it as he did?      2.) It is the same as to the construction of the world. To say     it exists by necessity must mean it had a maker, who _acted_ by     necessity: for necessity is only an abstract notion, and can     _do_ nothing.      3.) We say God exists by necessity, because we intuitively     discern that there must be an infinite Being, prior to all     causes; but we cannot say that _every thing_ so exists.     The fact that many changes in nature are produced by man’s     contrivance is a proof of "]]]
