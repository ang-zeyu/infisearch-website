The acceptance was by no means a foregone conclusion. Many of the delegates to the convention had been instructed to vote against acceptance, and among them Ebenezer Webster himself. But he obtained permission later to vote according to his own judgment, and the speech which he made in favor of this important action has been preserved. Just before the vote was taken, he rose and said:  “Mr. President, I have listened to the arguments for and against the Constitution. I am convinced such a government as that Constitution will establish, if adopted—a government acting directly on the people of the States—is necessary for the common defence and the public welfare. It is the only government which will enable us to pay off the national debt—the debt which we owe for the Revolution, and which we are bound in honor fully and fairly to discharge. Besides, I have followed the lead of Washington through seven years of war, and I have never been misled. His name is subscribed to this Constitution. He will not mislead us now. I shall vote for its adoption.”  No wonder that Daniel inherited from his father a reverent attachment for that Constitution which Judge Webster by word and deed had helped to secure and establish. His father was a grave and earnest man, but he was not stern nor ascetic. His strength was softened by good humor, and his massive features were often lighted up by a contagious laugh which endeared him to his family, who loved no less than they respected him.     CHAPTER III.  A MEMORABLE BATTLE.   Daniel, as well as his father, had a love of fun, and a sportive humor, which he always preserved. It is said that “all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” It is certainly a mistake when a boy is shut out from the innocent sports which boys delight in. John Stuart Mill, who was set to learning while little more than an infant, and who actually began to study Greek at four years of age—lamented in after years that he had never known what boyhood was.  It was not so with Daniel. Though his father’s poverty made it necessary for all to work, Daniel, partly because of his early delicacy, had plenty of time allowed him for amusement. The favorite companion of his leisure hours was not a boy, but a veteran soldier and near neighbor, named Robert Wise. He had built a little cottage in the corner of the Webster farm, and there with his wife he lived till extreme old age. He was born in Yorkshire, had fought on both sides in the Revolutionary struggle, had travelled in various parts of Europe, and had a thousand stories to tell, to all of which the boy listened with avidity. Though he had twice deserted from the English king, his heart still thrilled with pride when Daniel read to him from the newspaper accounts of battles in which the English arms were victorious. He had never learned to read, and Daniel became his favorite because he was always ready to read to him as they sat together at nightfall at the cottage door.  “Why don’t you learn to read yourself, Robert?” asked Daniel one day.  “It’s too late, Dan. I’m gettin’ an old man now, and I couldn’t do it.”  “What will you do when I am grown up, and gone away?”  “I don’t know, Dan. It will be dull times for me.”  When that time came the old man picked up a fatherless boy, and gave him a home and a chance to secure an education, in order that he might have some one to read the newspaper to him.  Whenever Daniel had a day or a few hours to himself he ran across the fields to his humble neighbor’s house.  “Come, Robert,” he would say, “I’ve got nothing to do. Let us go fishing.”  So the two would go down to the banks of the Merrimac, and embark in a boat which belonged to the old man, and paddle up and down the river, sometimes for an entire day. Daniel never lost his love of fishing, but in after years, when the cares of statesmanship were upon him, dressed in suitable style he would take his fishing pole and lie in wait for his finny victims, while perhaps he was mentally composing some one of his famous speeches, destined to thrill the hearts of thousands, or direct the policy of the government. These happy days spent in the open air corrected his native delicacy, and gradually imparted physical strength and vigor, and in time knit the vigorous frame which seemed a fitting temple for his massive intellect.  Even the most trivial circumstances in the boyhood of such a man as Daniel Webster are noteworthy, and I am sure my boy-readers will read with interest and sympathy the account of a signal victory which the boy gained, though it was only over a feathered bully.  Belonging to a neighbor was a cock of redoubtable prowess, a champion whose fame was in all the farmyards for miles around. One day Daniel, coming home from school, beheld with mortification the finish of a contest in which a favorite fowl of his own came off decidedly second best. The victorious rooster strutted about in conscious and complacent triumph.  “It’s too bad, Zeke!” said Daniel in genuine vexation, as he saw the crestfallen look of his own vanquished fowl. “I should like to see that impudent bully get well whipped.”  “There isn’t a rooster about here that can whip him, Dan.”  “I know that, but he will meet his match some time.”  “At any rate I’ll drive him away. He’ll have to run from me.”  Dan picked up a stone, and pelted the victor out of the yard, but the feathered bully, even in his flight, raised a crow of victory which vexed the boy.  “I’d give all the money I’ve got, Zeke, for a rooster that would whip him,” said Dan.  There came a time when Daniel had his wish.  He was visiting a relation at some distance when mention was made casually of a famous fighting cock who had never been beaten.  “Where is he to be found?” asked the boy eagerly.  “Why do you ask?”  “I would like to see him,” said Dan.  “Oh, well, he belongs to Mr.——.”  “Where does he live?”  The desired information was given.  Shortly after Daniel was missed. He found his way to the farm where the pugnacious fowl resided. In the yard he saw the owner, a farmer.  “Good morning, sir,” said Dan.  “Good morning, boy. What can I do for you?” was the reply.  “I hear you have a cock who is a famous fighter.”  “Yes, he’s never been beaten yet!” said the farmer complacently.  “Can I see him?”  “There he is,” said the owner, pointing out the feathered champion.  Daniel surveyed the rooster with great interest.  “Will you sell him?” he asked.  “I don’t know. Why do you want to buy him?”  Daniel explained his object frankly.  “How much are you willing to give?” asked the farmer, for he was a Yankee, and ready for a trade.  Daniel drew from his pocket half a dollar. It represented his entire cash capital.  “Here is half a dollar,” he said. “I’ll give you that.”  “Haven’t you got anymore money?” asked the farmer, who had a keen scent for a bargain.  “No, sir; it is all I have. I’d give you more if I had it.”  Half a dollar in those days was a considerable sum of money, particularly in the eyes of a farmer, who handled very little money, his income being for the most part in the shape of corn, hay and vegetables. Having satisfied himself that it was all he could get, he gave a favorable answer to the boy’s application.  Daniel’s eyes sparkled with delight, and he promptly handed over his fifty cent piece.  “When do you want to take it?” asked the farmer.  “Now,” answered Dan.  “Very well.”  The fowl was caught, and Daniel carried it back to the house of his relative in triumph.  “I’m going home,” he said abruptly.  “Going home? Why, you have only just come.”  “I’ll come again soon, but I want to take this cock home, and see if he can’t whip Mr. ——-’s. I want to teach the little bully a lesson.”  So in spite of all that could be said Daniel started on his way home.  When he had gone a short distance he passed a yard stocked with poultry, where a large cock was strutting about defiantly, as if throwing down the gage of battle to any new comers.  A boy was standing near the fence.  “Will your cock fight?” asked Dan.  “He can whip yours,” was the reply.  “Are you willing to try it?”  “Yes, come along.”  The trial was made, and Dan’s new purchase maintained his reputation, by giving a sound drubbing to his feathered rival.  Dan surveyed the result with satisfaction.  “I guess he’ll do,” he said to himself.  He kept on his way till he got within sight of home.  “What brings you home so soon, Dan?” asked Zeke.  “See here, Zeke!” said Dan eagerly.” Here is a cock that will whip Mr. ——’s all to pieces.”  “Don’t be too sure of it!”  “I’ve tried him once, and he’s game.”  The boys did not have long to wait for the trial.  Over came the haughty intruder, strutting about with his usual boastful air.  Dan let loose his new fowl, and a battle royal commenced. Soon the tyrant of the barnyard found that he had met a foe worthy of his spur. For a time the contest was an open one, but in ten minutes the feathered bully was ignominiously defeated, and led about by the comb in a manner as humiliating as had ever happened when he was himself the victor.  Daniel witnessed the defeat of the whilom tyrant with unbounded delight, and felt abundantly repaid for his investment of all his spare cash, as well as the cutting short of his visit. Probably in the famous passage at arms which he had many years after with Mr. Hayne, of South Carolina, his victory afforded him less satisfaction than this boyish triumph.     CHAPTER IV.  AN IMPORTANT STEP.   “What are you thinking about, Dan?” asked his mother one evening as the boy sat thoughtfully gazing at the logs blazing in the fireplace.  “I was wishing for something to read,” answered the boy.  Indeed that was his chief trouble in those early days. Libraries were scarce, and private collections equally scarce, especially in small country places. So the boy’s appetite for books was not likely to be satisfied."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53382"],["title","From Farm Boy to Senator (#3)"],["body","el’s words attracted the attention of his father.  “I have been speaking to some of our neighbors to-day,” he said, “about establishing a small circulating library which we could all use. I think we shall do something about it soon.”  “I hope you will, father,” said Dan eagerly.  “If we all contribute a little, we can make a beginning. Besides we can put in some books we have already.”  A week or two later Judge Webster announced that the library had been established, and it may be easily supposed that Daniel was one of the first to patronize it. It was a small and, many of my boy friends would think, an unattractive collection. But in the collection was the “Spectator,” in reading which Daniel unconsciously did something towards forming a desirable style of his own. He was fond of poetry, and at an early age could repeat many of the psalms and hymns of Dr. Watts.  There was another poem which so impressed him that he learned to repeat the whole of it. This was Pope’s “Essay on Man,” a poem which I fear is going out of fashion, which is certainly a pity, for apart from its literary merits it contains a great deal of sensible advice as to the conduct of life. As it is not of so much importance how much we read as how thoroughly, and how much we remember, there is reason to think that Daniel got more benefit from his four books than most of the boys of to-day from their multitude of books.  Once, however, Daniel’s literary enthusiasm came near having serious consequences. A new almanac had been received, and as usual each of the months was provided with a couplet of poetry. After going to bed Daniel and Ezekiel got into a dispute about the couplet at the head of the April page, and in order to ascertain which was correct Dan got out of bed, went down stairs, and groped his way to the kitchen, where he lighted a candle and went in search of the almanac. He found it, and on referring to it ascertained that Ezekiel was right. His eagerness made him careless, and an unlucky spark from the candle set some cotton clothes on fire. The house would have been consumed but for the exertions and presence of mind of his father. It may be a comfort to some of my careless young readers to learn that so great a man as Daniel Webster occasionally got into mischief when he was a boy.  Somewhere about this time a young lawyer, Mr. Thomas W. Thompson, came to Daniel’s native town and set up an office.  As he was obliged to be absent at times, and yet did not wish to close his office, he proposed to Daniel to sit in his office and receive callers in his absence. Though boys do not generally take kindly to confinement, the office contained one attraction for the boy in a collection of books, probably of a miscellaneous character such as a young man is likely to pick up.  Daniel’s time was not otherwise occupied, for he had no service to render, except to stay in the office and inform callers when Mr. Thompson would be back, and he was therefore at liberty to make use of the books. He made a selection unusual for a boy. There was an old Latin grammar, which the young lawyer had probably used himself in his preparatory course. This book Daniel selected, and began to study by himself. His employer offered to hear him recite in it, and soon had occasion to be surprised at the strong and retentive memory of his office boy. Probably none of the law books attracted the future lawyer. It would have been surprising if they had.  “Judge Webster,” said Thompson, on meeting the father of his young employee, “Dan will make a fine scholar if he has the chance.”  “I think the boy has ability.”  “He certainly has. He ought to go to college.”  Judge Webster shook his head.  “I should like it above all things,” he said, “but I can’t see my way clear. I am a poor man, as you know, and it would cost a great deal of money to carry Dan through college even after he were prepared.”  This was true, and the young lawyer was unprepared with any suggestion as to how the difficult matter was to be arranged. But Judge Webster did not forget the conversation. He was considering what could be done towards giving his promising son an education. He was willing to sacrifice his comfort, even, if thereby he could give him a good start in life.  Finally he made up his mind to start him on the way, even if he were obliged to stop short before reaching the desired goal.  Not far away was an institution which has since become famous, Exeter Academy, which has now for a century been doing an important work in preparing boys for our best colleges, and has always maintained a high standard of scholarship. Thither Judge Webster determined to take Daniel, and provide for his expenses by domestic self-denial. It was not till he had fully made up his mind that he announced his determination to the boy.  “Dan,” he said one evening, “you must be up early to-morrow.”  “Why, father?”  Daniel supposed he was to be set at some farm work.  “We are going to make a journey,” answered Judge Webster.  “A journey!” repeated the boy in surprise. “Where are we going?”  “I am going to take you to Exeter, to put you at school there.”  The boy listened with breathless interest and delight, mingled perhaps with a little apprehension, for he did not know he would succeed in the untried scenes which awaited him.  “Won’t it be expensive, father?” he asked after a pause, for he knew well his father’s circumstances, and was unusually considerate for a boy.  “Yes, my son, but I look to you to improve your time, so that I may find my investment a wise one.”  “How are we to go, father?”  “On horseback.”  Dan was a little puzzled, not knowing whether he and his father were to ride on one horse or not, as was a frequent custom at that time. It would have been hard upon any horse, for the judge was a man of weight, and the boy though light would have considerably increased the burden.  The next morning Daniel’s curiosity was gratified. In front of the farmhouse stood two horses, one belonging to his father, the other filled out with a side-saddle.  “Is that horse for me?” asked Daniel in surprise.  “Yes, my son.”  “What do I want of a side-saddle? I am not a lady.”  “Neighbor —— is sending the horse to Exeter for the use of a lady who is to return here. I agreed to take charge of it, and it happens just right, as you can use it.”  “I don’t know how I can get along with it. It will look strange for me to be riding on a lady’s saddle.”  “If a lady can ride on it probably you can.”  So Dan and his father set out on their journey from the quiet country town to Exeter, the boy mounted on a lady’s horse. When in his later life he had occasion to refer to this journey, Mr. Webster recalled with great merriment the figure he must have cut as he rode meekly behind his father.  No doubt as they rode along father and son conversed together about the important step which had been taken. Judge Webster already had formed the plan of sending Daniel to college, after he should have completed a course of preparation at Exeter, but upon this part of his plan he did not think it best yet to speak to his son, very probably because he had not yet made up his mind as to whether his circumstances would allow him to incur so heavy an expense.  “My son,” said the father gravely, “I hope you will improve to the utmost the advantages I am securing for you. You must remember how much depends upon yourself. A boy’s future is largely in his own hands.”  “Yes, father, I will do the best I can.”  “Mr. Thompson thinks you can make a good scholar.”  “I will try, father.”  “I shall have no money to leave you, Daniel, but I hope to give you an education, which is better than a fortune.”  How would the father have been gratified if he could have foreseen the brilliant future in store for the boy of fourteen who was about to take his first important step in life.     CHAPTER V.  DANIEL AT EXETER ACADEMY.   The principal of Exeter Academy at that time was Benjamin Abbot, LL.D., a man of high repute in letters as well as in the educational field. He was a man of dignified presence, who exacted and received deference not only from his pupils but from all with whom he came in contact.  “Dr. Abbot,” said Judge Webster, when the two were admitted to his presence, “I have brought my son Daniel to study in your institution, if you find him qualified.”  The dignified principal turned towards the bashful boy, and said, “What is your age, sir?”  “Fourteen,” answered Daniel.  “I will examine you first in reading. Take this Bible, my lad, and read that chapter.”  It was the twenty-second chapter of St. Luke’s Gospel, and was very well adapted as a test of the boy’s ability in reading.  Now if there was anything Dan could do well it was this. He never could remember the time when he could not read. Probably he had learned from his mother, and his first text-book was the Bible. He was endowed with reverence, and his grave, sonorous voice was especially well fitted for sacred reading.  The boy took the book and commenced the task prescribed. Usually a few verses are considered sufficient, but in this case the dignified listener became absorbed in the boy’s reading, and he listened, half forgetful of the object he had in view. It is a good deal to say that he actually enjoyed it. He had seldom listened to a voice at once so rich, deep and sonorous as belonged to this young boy of fourteen. Daniel, too, forgot that he was on trial, and read with his whole soul intent upon the words before him.  When he had completed the chapter Dr. Abbot said, abruptly, “You are qualified to enter this institution.”  This was all the examination which in his case was required.  It was no common school that Daniel had entered, as is shown by the list of eminent men who have gone forth from it. George Bancroft, Edward Everett, Alexander H. Everett, Lewis Cass, Levi Woodbury, John E. Palfrey and others received here the first rudiments of their classical education, and all of"]]]
