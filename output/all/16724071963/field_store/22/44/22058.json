I am going back first chance--\"  \"You do!\" threatened Madaline, with a glance Grace rightfully interpreted. \"I will never, as long as I live, go into the Cedar grove again. It's too scary for words.\"  \"I loved it,\" drawled Grace. \"I am going again. See if I don't. Want to come, Maggie?\"  \"Maybe, but just now I want an alibi for mother's promised watercress. Grace, you are a great scout! You lure us all out here, with the most tempting offer of prize watercress, and here we go home with a bunch of last year's cattails. What shall we say to all our loved mothers, who allowed us to cut house work for this wonderful afternoon?\" asked Margaret.  \"Say that I, Grace Gollivar Philow, will go back first chance I get, and fetch watercress for the whole community. Only next time I go, I am going to fetch a gun--\"  Margaret laughed, but Madaline shivered. Scout girls were supposed to know how to use a gun, but fortunately Grace was still in the Tenderfoot class. Perhaps before she could possibly get permission to try gunning, she would have outgrown her tendency to capture tramps with ostensibly stolen washes. Madaline sincerely hoped so.  When almost in town Grace gained an opportunity to whisper to Madaline:  \"Now remember, Madie. Never a word. I am not sure my man got away, you know. He may be tied up there yet. And also, I may get someone to go with me and reclaim Mrs. Johnston's wash. I know about where it broke loose.\"     CHAPTER IV  PATHS DIVIDING   But the happenings in the woods were quickly forgotten, at least so far as the scout girls were concerned, by the unexpected development in the case of the two girls, Dagmar and Tessie, who had stolen out of Flosston.  In that section of the town where the girls lived, the Americanized foreigners had little in common with such families as those of the girls of True Tred Troop. In fact, few happenings in the mill community ever reached the ears of the so-called \"swells,\" that inappropriate term being applied to those whose fathers held some executive position in the great silk industries of Flosston.  Thus it was easy to understand why the scouts had heard nothing next day of the mysterious disappearance of Dagmar and Tessie.  A contrary situation existed in Millville, however. Here the families of both girls were causing a search to be made in that peculiar fashion of confusion and excitement, usually ending in making the condition more complicated, and giving rise to absolutely no clues worthy of attention.  Mrs. Brodix, Dagmar's mother, good, kind mother that she was, spent her time wringing her hands and rolling her big black eyes, otherwise in extolling the hitherto undiscovered virtues of the lost daughter.  In her distress she forsook the English tongue, and lapsed into a conglomeration of Polish and Yiddish made intelligible only through the plentiful interpretation of dramatic gesticulation.  \"Oh, my beautiful Dagmar!\" she wailed. \"It is that vile street runner Theresa, who has carried her away!\" was the burden of her lamentations.  \"The smartest girl in all Millville was my Tessie,\" insisted Mrs. Wartliz. \"It was that baby-faced kitten, Dagmar Brodix, who coaxed her off. She would earn as much money as me\" (good enough English for Mrs. Wartliz), \"and she had money in the bank, too.\"  It was probably this last fact that really led the girls to seek what they considered was a broader field for their talent. If Tessie's money in the bank had been a joint account with her mother's name, she would not have been able to draw out the funds for her escapade, but what did Mrs. Wartliz know about such supervision for a daughter, who was absorbing America at one end--the attractions--and ignoring America at the other--honorable conduct?  What actually happened was this. When Dagmar ran after Tessie, who was threatening to leave her to her own resources, that dark night when both had planned to shake the dust of Millville from their well worn shoes, the older girl finally agreed to take Dagmar along if \"she would quit her babying, and act decent.\"  \"Now the train is gone,\" scolded Tessie, \"and we have to take that horrid old jitney out to the junction. Like as not we will meet some one who will squeal on us.\"  \"Tessie,\" pleaded Dagmar, afraid to speak, and fearful of the consequences if she did not make her appeal. \"Why can't we go to Franklin? There is a fine mill there and it is nearer home--\"  \"Say kid\" exclaimed the rougher girl, \"if you want to go home you have a swell chance right now, but if you want to come with me quit simping and come,\" and she picked up her own bag in bad temper, gave her brilliant scarf a twist and started off for the jitney, leaving Dagmar to take the unattractive choice she had just mentioned.  Dagmar was too frightened to notice the grimy mill hands who were crowded into the old bus, making their way to another settlement in search of an evening's recreation, but Tessie slunk deep down in her corner, burying her face in her scarf and hiding her eyes with her tam. She knew better than to run the risk of having her cross father discover her in flight. After she had succeeded in getting away Lonzo Wartliz would not spend time to go after her, but while she was \"on the wing,\" so to speak, he would have no trouble in bringing her back. A day's time from the mill would be too costly a sacrifice to make, while a police call to \"fetch back my girl\" would cost him nothing. Also there was the thought that Tessie might fix it at home by sending a letter filled with glowing promises of good money--but she would require at least one day to mail her promise to Flosston.  So Dagmar sat with a melancholy expression on her face while Tessie hid her silent chuckles in her wearing apparel.  \"Here we are,\" whispered the latter, as the jitney jolted to a standstill. \"Don't forget your Saratoga.\"  Dagmar dragged the hated \"telescope\" after her, as she dropped down from the rickety high steps of the old motor wagon. It was very dark now, and she was more frightened than she had any idea of betraying to her companion. \"Come on, kid,\" called the other. \"We have got to hunt up something. We may not get out of this great white way to-night.\"  \"Oh, Tessie! How could we stay in a place like this?\"  \"Just like the other folks. Do you think they are goin' to spread out a wedding canopy for you? Oh, be a sport, Daggie. Tomorrow is yet to come.\"  The training this young girl had received in the local movies was now developing in a rather dangerous way. She was breathing heavily in her new found adventure, she was out alone, or as good as alone, in a strange place on a dark night, and perhaps she would be kidnapped? In spite of the danger Tessie fairly thrilled with the possibility, and it was with a very pronounced degree of scorn that she regarded her weaker companion.  Not that the \"movies\" were exerting any better influence on Dagmar. In fact it had been their uncertain propaganda that first created in her breast the feeling of unrest, that first told her Millville was mean, shabby, and an unfit place for an ambitious girl to try to exist in. Her very love for her mother and father, to say nothing of her affection for the other members of her family, seemed a spur to her ambition \"to get away and be somebody.\"  But the getting away was by no means the pleasant dream she had pictured it. Here they were, two young, inexperienced girls in a strange town, without the slightest knowledge of how they might find a safe place in which to stay for a single night, and even they, with their minds open for adventure, realized how promptly trouble comes to those who openly seek it.  \"Let's go down this street and see what it runs into,\" suggested Tessie. \"Hope it doesn't flop off into a ditch.\"  \"I think we ought to ask someone,\" put in Dagmar.  \"Ask them what?\" rudely demanded Tessie.  \"Where we can go for the night? Are you sure we can't get a train? We could sleep in the cars.\"  \"Oh, say, you want a Pullman, you do, the kind we see go by the factory with the coons all dolled up in dish towels,\" she sneered, now seemingly set upon making things as unpleasant as possible for poor, little, frightened Dagmar. But the latter was not altogether a coward, and the blustering tone of Tessie was not too deep to penetrate. Dagmar pulled herself together and dropped the \"telescope.\"  \"You may do as you please, Miss Wartliz,\" she exclaimed. \"But I am not going to tramp these streets all night. I don't want to end up in a nice little rat-ridden police cell. We don't have rats over our way.\"  \"And I suppose we do. Well, Miss Smarty, what do you propose to do? Maybe you wouldn't mind letting your friend in on the game!\"  \"You know, Tessie, I don't mind slang, and I am not a goody-good, but I am nervous, and I think we would get along better if we both dropped that street stuff. It gets on my nerves.\"  \"Oh, my sakes alive! Gettin' nerves!\" and she dropped her voice into the deepest tones of contempt. \"I might-a known it. You would be apt to have them with that face. Well, kid, what do you want to do? I don't see no hospital for nerves out this way.\"  \"Tessie! See that man!\"  \"Sure I do. He's a cop, too. Stop your whimpering and trot along. We're goin' to grandma's,\" and Tessie grabbed the arm of the trembling Dagmar as she started off with a determined step, indicating a particular objective being sought for.  But the officer of the law could distinguish runaway girls without a full confession from their painted lips. And he promptly started after them.  \"He's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5263"],["title","The Girl Scout Pioneers; Or, Winning the First B. C. (#5)"],["body","' us,\" whispered Dagmar.  \"As if I thought he was playin' hop-scotch,\" scoffed the tantalizing one. \"Keep movin', we will give his legs a treat, even if he intends to beat us out.\"  And they did walk very briskly indeed--all the more reason why the officer should follow them!  \"Makes me think of tryin' to get away from a strange dog,\" Tessie had the temerity to interject. \"The faster we ran the surer he is to keep snappin'.\"  \"He is sure to catch us,\" Dagmar said. \"Why don't you stop and ask him where we can go?\"  \"You poor simp. Want him to tell you?\" and she almost laughed outright.  \"Wait--a minute--wait--a minute!\" came the summons. \"What's your big hurry?\"  They both stopped. Each knew enough for that. The man of the law, shaking that treacherous stick on its red cord, was now beside them. He pushed his cap back to make sure nothing interfered with his gaze. This he fixed scrutinizingly on the two girls. Dagmar flinched, but Tessie smiled in a foolish attempt to gain his good will.  \"Where are you two trottin' off to all alone?\" he asked finally.  \"We're goin' to grandma's,\" said Tessie, so ridiculously that she almost burst out laughing. She had no idea the answer would sound so silly.  \"Oh! you be,\" he returned, his voice thick with irony. \"Is the old lady expectin' you?\"  \"Well, we didn't say we would be there tonight,\" Tessie had the audacity to reply.  \"No, I thought not,\" and he twirled that formidable stick almost into Dagmar's scared face. \"Well, shall we send her word?\"  \"Oh, we can find our way,\" put in Tessie again, attempting to start off.  \"Maybe so. But here in Franklin we have a curfew law, and we don't allow little girls out alone so late.\"  \"No?\" sneered Tessie. \"Lovely town. We expect to take the rest cure here.\"  \"Now, my young lady,\" in severe tones, \"I'll show you where we give that self same cure. Come--along--with--me!\"  Quick as a wink Tessie grabbed her bag, and started to run. The officer was so surprised he required a moment to realize she was running away. When he did he sounded his whistle.  And there stood Dagmar, alone, and as the \"movies\" say, \"Forsaken!\"  \"Oh, Tessie,\" she called weakly. \"Come back. You have my pocketbook!\"  But the fleeing girl did not stop to listen to Dagmar's cry or to the shrill whistle the officer again sent out into the night. She was making tracks so successfully, the minion of the law knew very well his whistle would never summon help--the only other officer in town being \"out of town\" to his personal knowledge. So Tessie went, and with her Dagmar's pocketbook and the Girl Scout Badge!     CHAPTER V  A FRIENDLY ENEMY   \"Now, don't you worry, little girl. You are not like that one running away. I can see that by your manner,\" said the officer kindly, as Dagmar pressed her handkerchief to her wet eyes. \"I don't have to take you to the calaboose, unless I set fit, and I don't.\"  He touched her arm kindly. Jim Cosgrove hated to see anyone cry, and his kind heart never seemed to interfere with the fulfillment of his duty. When he was kind he had reason to be, and never yet had the higher officials questioned his wisdom.  \"Oh, thank you,\" said Dagmar, when she could find the words. \"We haven't done anything wrong.\"  \"Well, it isn't exactly right for young girls to run away from home, and I don't have to wait for all the particulars to decide that is what you are both aiming to do. However, let us go along. My wife doesn't mind takin' a girl in now and then, to save her name from the records.\"  Dagmar breathed easier. She might even find a place to sleep! Why hadn't Tessie waited?  In spite of the rather unpleasant situation, there was comfort in the thought she would not have to go to some dreadful hotel, or boarding house, and perhaps undergo all the hardships dealt out to runaways in the \"pictures.\" So Dagmar walked along with the officer, unmindful of the sharp looks of the few passersby who happened to be out in that section of the rather quiet town.  \"Of course you will go straight back home in the morning?\" asked and answered the officer.  \"Oh, I did so want to try something else,\" almost pleaded the girl. \"You see, mister, it is awful in the mill end of Flosston.\"  \"Not very good, I'll admit,\" replied he, \"but it will be my duty to send you back.\"  They walked along in silence after that brief conversation. Dagmar was thinking how difficult it would be to go back home on the morrow, and in the company of an officer! As if the man divined her thoughts, he said presently:  \"We will see how we make out when we get to my house. My old woman is as good a help to me as the other man on the post, and better. She helps me a lot with the girls, and I often say she should have had a uniform. Maybe we can fix it so she will take you back home.\"  \"Oh, that would be better,\" replied Dagmar. \"I would hate to go with a man.\"  \"Course you would and I don't blame you. But I must hurry and put you up with Mary. If I don't find your pal I will have to give the word to the next town. Can't have a girl like that running around loose all night.\"  \"I wish she had stayed. Tessie is--not really wild, but she has so much freedom at home. All her folks seem to care for about her is her money.\"  \"Lots of folks are foolish as that, then they have to spend a good lot to make up for getting a little. And the funny part of it is, the girls, who seem so wise, are the easiest fooled. Now, she acted like a real grown-up, but I'll bet my badge she would go along with the first person who offered her a hot pancake for breakfast. They have so much nerve it dries up all their common sense.\"  \"I do wish she had not run away. She is always making fun of me and calling me a baby. But I think, as you say, mister, it is better not to have too much nerve.\"  \"You're right, girl. But here we are. Don't you be the least bit afraid of my wife. She is big and blustery, but has a heart of gold.\"  The rugged outside of this man evidently hid a heart of his own not far from pure gold, and Dagmar could not help thinking he was the nicest policeman she had ever heard of, and that she had encountered him seemed nothing short of wonderfully good luck.  Turning in at the gate, which even in the night could be seen to form a little arch in vines and bushes, Officer Cosgrove tapped lightly on the door, which was opened before the echo of his last tap had died away.  \"Here we are, Mary,\" he announced to the woman standing in the portal. \"I just brought you a little girl--who--is lost. Take care of her while I go after the--other. She didn't take so kindly to Jim as this one did,\" and with a friendly little push, he ushered Dagmar into the narrow hall, and turned out into the roadway, from whence his light footfall could immediately be heard hurrying over the cinder-covered path.  \"Come in, girl,\" ordered Mrs. Cosgrove. \"What happened to you?\"  Dagmar was bewildered. What had happened to her? What should she answer!  \"I am--away--from home,\" she managed to reply. \"The officer said I could go back tomorrow.\"  The inadequacy of her reply sounded foolish even to Dagmar, but she was constrained to feel her way. She could never blurt out the fact that she had actually run away from home!  \"Oh, I see,\" said Mrs. Cosgrove with a tone of uncertainty. \"Run away, eh?\"  \"Yes'm,\" said Dagmar defencelessly.  \"Too bad. Didn't your folks treat you right?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" hurried Dagmar to correct any such impression as that question conveyed. \"But I wanted to help them--all, and I thought I--could!\"  Tears were running over now, and Dagmar's courage was at lowest ebb. The motherly woman took the ever-present \"telescope,\" and setting it down in a corner of the pleasant room, directed Dagmar to a chair near the little stove, in which a small light glowed, quite suitably opposed to the chill of early spring.  \"Just sit down and I'll get you a bite. Of course you are hungry.\"  \"Not very,\" gulped the girl, who had not tasted food since she snapped the cover on her lunch box that eventful noon day, when the girl, having agreed with Tessie to leave Milltown, had eaten the dark bread and bologna, for what she supposed would be the last time. So Dagmar was hungry, although her emotion for the time was choking her, and hiding the pangs of actual hunger.  \"All the same tea tastes good when we use up nerves,\" insisted the woman, leaving the room, and presently clicking dishes and utensils in the kitchen. Left alone for a moment Dagmar recovered her composure and glanced about the room. It seemed almost fragrant in its clean freshness. She had never occupied such a room, with that peculiar, bracing atmosphere. The small mantel with its prim vases looked a veritable home shrine, and the center table with the sprigs of budding lilacs, seemed to the forlorn girl something to reverence. The rag rugs under her feet were so spotless, the curtains so white--it suddenly occurred to the girl these things could not exist in the smoke and grim of a mill town. It was the mill--always the mill found to blame for her misery.  \"Come on, girl--what is your name?\" came a voice from the kitchen.  Dagmar responded and took her place at the table with its white oilcloth cover, and a snowy napkin neatly smoothed under the one plate set for her.  \"Molly has gone to Flosston to a Girl Scout meeting,\" announced Mrs. Cosgrove, helping Dagmar to a dish of home-made pork and beans. \"She loves the Scout affairs, and wouldn't miss a rally, even if she has to come home a little late. Martin, that's my boy, will meet her at the jitney.\"  \"Gone to Flosston?\" repeated Dagmar. \"That's where I came from--that is the corner we call Milltown, it is out where the factories are.\"  \"Oh, I know the town well. Not too nice in spots. But start right in. Drink your tea and eat up your bread and jelly. I'll finish what I was at, and be back by the time you have cleaned your plate.\"  Dagmar realized this action was taken out of sheer delicacy. And she was very thankful to be left"]]]
