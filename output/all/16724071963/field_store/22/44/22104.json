Nelke, President.  FOREWORD.  The following debate on the \"Origin of the Book of Mormon,\" came about in the following manner: The writer saw in the _Salt Lake Tribune_ two numbers of Mr. Schroeder's article and observing the general trend of the argument felt that a prompt reply should appear in the same publication, that it might be read by the same people who would read Mr. Schroeder's article. A letter was accordingly addressed to the _Tribune,_ to ascertain if that paper would publish a reply to Mr. Schroeder. The Editor answered that the _Tribune_ was reproducing the article from the _American Historical Magazine,_ published in New York, and that perhaps its publishers would be pleased to receive a reply to Mr. Schroeder. If the publishers of the _Historical Magazine_ accepted such an article, the _Tribune_ would then be willing to reproduce it, if the _Deseret News,_ the Mormon Church organ, would agree to publish Mr. Schroeder's article.  This suggested a too complicated arrangement to suit the writer, hence he dropped the matter with the _Tribune,_ and took it up with the publishers of the _American Historical Magazine,_ who gave place to his answer to Mr. Schroeder in current numbers of that publication, 1908-9. And the writer has heard nothing from the _Tribune_ or Mr. Schroeder since.  At the conclusion of the article on the \"Origin of the Book of Mormon,\" the _Historical Magazine Company,_ Mr. David I. Nelke, President, announced their willingness to publish in _Americana,_--which in the meantime had succeeded the _American Historical Magazine_ a detailed history of the \"Mormon Church,\" if the writer would prepare it.  The History has been running in _Americana_ now for more than two and a half years, and will continue until the History of the Church is completed up to date.      *    *    *    *    *    *  And now a word as to the origin of the Book of Mormon before presenting the discussion. It will be an advantage to the reader if he has before him Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the Book of Mormon. For our present purpose the account the Prophet gives in his statement to Mr. John Wentworth, of Chicago, of the origin of the Book of Mormon is, on account of its brevity and comprehensiveness, most suitable. After detailing the events of his first vision, received in the Spring of 1820, and the intervening three years, the Prophet comes to the Book of Mormon part of his narrative:      THE APPEARING OF MORONI.      \"On the evening of the 21st of September, A. D. 1823, while I was     praying unto God and endeavoring to exercise faith in the precious     promises of scripture, on a sudden a light like that of day, only     of a far purer and more glorious appearance and brightness, burst     into the room,--indeed the first sight was as though the house was     filled with consuming fire; the appearance producing a shock that     affected the whole body; in a moment a personage stood before me     surrounded with a glory yet greater than that with which I was     already surrounded. This messenger proclaimed himself to be an     angel of God, sent to bring the joyful tidings that the covenant     which God made with ancient Israel was at hand to be fulfilled;     that the preparatory work for the second coming of the Messiah was     speedily to commence; that the time was at hand for the gospel in     all its fulness to be preached in power unto all nations, that a     people might be prepared for the Millennial reign. I was informed     that I was chosen to be an instrument in the hands of God to bring     about some of His purposes in this glorious dispensation.      THE BOOK OF MORMON.      \"I was also informed concerning the aboriginal inhabitants of this     country and shown who they were, and whence they came; a brief     sketch of their origin, progress, civilization, laws, governments;     of their righteousness and iniquity, and the blessings of God     being finally withdrawn from them as a people, was made known to     me; I was also told where were deposited some plates on which were     engraven an abridgment of the records of the ancient prophets that     had existed on this continent. The angel appeared to me three times     the same night and unfolded the same things. After having received     many visits from the angels of God unfolding the majesty and glory     of the events that should transpire in the last days, on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52819"],["title","Defense of the Faith and the Saints (Volume 2 of 2) (#1)"],["body","morning of the 22d of September, A.D. 1827, the angel of the Lord     delivered the records into my hands.      DESCRIPTION OF THE NEPHITE RECORD.      \"These records were engraven on plates which had the appearance     of gold; each plate was six inches wide and eight inches long,     and not quite so thick as common tin. They were filled with     engravings, in Egyptian characters, and bound together in a volume     as the leaves of a book, with three rings running through the     whole. The volume was something near six inches in thickness, a     part of which was sealed. The characters on the unsealed part were     small, and beautifully engraved. The whole book exhibited many     marks of antiquity in its construction and much skill in the art     of engraving. With the records was found a curious instrument,     which the ancients called 'Urim and Thummim,' which consisted     of two transparent stones set in the rim of a bow fastened to     a breastplate. Through the medium of the Urim and Thummim I     translated the record by the gift and power of God.      \"In this important and interesting book the history of ancient     America is unfolded, from its first settlement by a colony that     came from the Tower of Babel, at the confusion of languages, to     the beginning of the fifth century of the Christian era. We are     informed by these records that America in ancient times had been     inhabited by two distinct races of people. The first was called     Jaredites and came directly from the Tower of Babel. The second     race came directly from the City of Jerusalem, about six hundred     years before Christ. They were principally Israelites, of the     descendants of Joseph. The Jaredites were destroyed about the time     that the Israelites came from Jerusalem, who succeeded them in the     inheritance of the country. The principal nation of the second race     fell in battle towards the close of the fourth century [A.D.].     The remnant are the Indians that now inhabit this country. This     book also tells us that our Savior made His appearance upon this     continent after His resurrection; that He planted the gospel here     in all its fulness, and richness, and power, and blessing; that     they had apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, and evangelists;     the same order, the same priesthood, the same ordinances,     gifts, powers, and blessings, as were enjoyed on the Eastern     continent; that the people were cut off in consequence of their     transgressions; that the last of their prophets who existed among     them was commanded to write an abridgment of their prophecies,     history, etc., and to hide it up in the earth, and that it should     come forth and be united with the Bible for the accomplishment of     the purposes of God in the last days.\"  The book issued from the press sometime in the month of March, 1830. [A]  [Footnote A: For a more detailed account of the origin of the Book of Mormon, see the writer's work, \"New Witnesses for God,\" Vol. II, chs. iv and viii.]  From the first appearance of Joseph Smith's account of the origin of the Book of Mormon, there was felt the need of a counter theory of origin. The first to respond to this \"felt\" need was Alexander Campbell, founder of the \"Disciples\" or \"Christian\" Church. He assigned the book's origin straight to Joseph Smith, whom he accused of conscious fraud in \"foisting it upon the public as a revelation.\" This in 1831. Then came the Spaulding theory of origin by Hurlburt, Howe, _et al.,_ 1834; for which Mr. Campbell repudiated his first theory of the Joseph Smith authorship. In 1899 Lily Dougall in \"The Mormon Prophet,\" advanced her theory of the Prophet's \"self delusion,\" \"by the automatic freaks of a vigorous but undisciplined brain.\" This was supplemented in 1902 by Mr. I. Woodbridge Riley's theory of \"pure hallucination, honestly mistaken for inspired vision; with partly conscious and partly unconscious hypnotic powers over others.\" [B]  [Footnote B: Both the Dougall and Riley theories are considered in Vol. I. of _Defense of the Faith and the Saints_, pp. 42-62; and the older theories of the origin in _New Witness for God_, Vol. III, chas. xliv, xlv.]  Mr. Schroeder, however, will have none of these later theories; and although the finding of the Rev. Mr. Spauldings' \"Manuscript Found,\" by Professor Fairchild of Oberlin College, in 1884--details of which are given in the debate gave a serious set back to that theory, Mr. Schroeder deems the Spaulding theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon the only tenable counter theory advanced, and assuming the existence of another Spaulding manuscript _not found,_ and not likely to be found, he proceeds with his argument; to which I make answer, with what success the reader must judge.  B. H. ROBERTS.  Salt Lake City, October, 1911.    THE ORIGIN OF THE BOOK OF MORMON.  BY THEODORE SCHROEDER  I.  Every complete, critical discussion of the divine origin of the Book of Mormon naturally divides itself into three parts:--first, an examination as to the sufficiency of the evidence adduced in support of its miraculous and divine origin; second, an examination of the internal evidences of its origin, [1] such as its verbiage, its alleged history, chronology, archaeology, etc.; third, an accounting for its existence by purely human agency and upon a rational basis, remembering that Joseph Smith, the nominal founder and first prophet of Mormonism, was probably too ignorant to have produced the whole volume unaided. Under the last head, two theories have been advocated by non-Mormons. By one of these, conscious fraud has been imputed to Smith, and by the other, psychic mysteries have been explored [2] in an effort to supplant the conscious fraud by an unconscious self-deception.  [Footnote 1: Valuable contributions to this study are Lamb's \"Golden Bible\" and a pamphlet by Lamoni Call classifying two thousand corrections in the inspired grammar of the first edition of the Book of Mormon.]  [Footnote 2: The best effort along this line is Riley's \"The Founder of Mormonism.\" To me the conclusions are very unsatisfactory, because so many material considerations were overlooked by that author.]  In 1834, four years after its first appearance, an effort was made to show that the Book of Mormon was a plagiarism from an unpublished novel of Solomon Spaulding. For a long time this seemed the accepted theory of all non-Mormons. In the past fifteen years, apparently following in the lead of President Fairchild of Oberlin College, [3] all but two of the numerous writers upon the subject have asserted that the theory of the Spaulding manuscript origin of the Book of Mormon must be abandoned, and Mormons assert that only fools and knaves still profess belief in it. [4] With these last conclusions I am compelled to disagree.  [Footnote 3: President Fairchild, in the New York _Observer_ for February 5, 1885, that being immediately after his discovery of the Oberlin Manuscript, says: \"The theory of the origin of the Book of Mormon in the traditional manuscript of Solomon Spaulding will probably have to be relinquished. * * * Mr. Rice, myself, and others compared it with the Book of Mormon, and could detect no resemblance between the two in general or detail. * * * Some other explanation of the origin of the Book of Mormon must be found, if an explanation is required.\" (Reproduced in Whitney's \"History of Utah,\" 56. Talmage's \"Articles of Faith,\" 278.)  Ten years later Mr. Fairchild is not so brash in assuming the Oberlin Manuscript to be the only Spaulding Manuscript, and he certifies only that the Oberlin Manuscript \"is not the original of the Book of Mormon.\" (Letter dated Oct. 17, 1895, published in vol. lx., _Millennial Star,_ p. 697, Nov. 3, 1898. Talmage's \"Articles of Faith,\" 279.)  _Fairchild's Latest Statement._--In 1900 President Fairchild wrote the Rev. J. D. Nutting as follows:  \"With regard to the manuscript of Mr. Spaulding now in the library of Oberlin College, I have never stated, and know of no one who can state, that it is the only manuscript which Spaulding wrote, or that it is certainly the one which has been supposed to be the original of the Book of Mormon. The discovery of this MS. does not prove that there may not have been another, which became the basis of the Book of Mormon. The use which has been made of statements emanating from me as implying the contrary of the above is entirely unwarranted.  \"JAMES H. FAIRCHILD\"]  [Footnote 4: The _Deseret News_ editorially says this on July 19, 1900: \"The discovery of the manuscript written by Mr. Spaulding, and its deposit in the library at Oberlin College, O., * * * has so completely demolished the theory once relied upon by superficial minds that the Book of Mormon was concocted from that manuscript, that it has been entirely abandoned by all opponents of Mormonism except the densely ignorant or unscrupulously dishonest.\"  And this on May 14, 1901:  \"It is only the densely ignorant, the totally depraved and clergymen of different denominations afflicted with anti-Mormon rabies who still use the Spaulding story to account for the origin of the Book of Mormon.\"]  In setting forth my convictions and the reasons for them, I have undertaken nothing entirely new, but have only assigned myself the task of establishing as an historical fact what is now an abandoned and almost forgotten theory. This will be done by marshaling in its support a more complete array of the old evidences than has been heretofore made and the addition of new circumstantial evidence not heretofore used in this connection.  It will be shown that Solomon Spaulding was much interested in American antiquities; that he wrote a novel entitled the \"Manuscript Found,\" in which he attempted to account for the existence of the American Indian by giving him an Israelitish origin; that the first incomplete outline of this story, with many features peculiar to itself"]]]
