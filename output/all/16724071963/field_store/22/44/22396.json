Feb. 23    10.15 P. M.      The discrepancies are too great and too variable to enable us to     come to any very definite conclusions as to the place or manner of     origin of Leardo’s figures.  [11]The division of the hour into 1080 points (3×6×60, as Dom Bévenot     points out) is puzzling. More usually the hour was subdivided into     four points. See Grotefend, _op. cit._, p. 188.  [12]The dominical letter for 1453 was G.  [13]On the basis of certain of the figures given by Leardo for the     lengths of the days at about the times of the solstices, I have     estimated that this table was worked out for about lat. 42° 45′ N,     which is more nearly the latitude of Orvieto than that of Venice     (45° 30′). (This calculation was made with the _Smithsonian     Meteorological Tables_, 4th edit. (constituting _Smithsonian Misc.     Colls._, Vol. 69, No. 1), Washington, 1918: Table 87, “Duration of     Sunshine at Different Latitudes,” and Table 88, “Declination of the     Sun for the Year 1899.” The difference in the declination of the sun     for 1452 and 1899 is negligible.) Dom Bévenot writes: “I fancy day     lengths were reckoned roughly for degrees. Here in Weingarten about     1490 they used tables drawn up for lat. 45° N, though the place is     actually 47° 40′.”  [14]I am indebted to Dom Bévenot for the following comment:      “Concerning the calendar of saints I find the good Venetian has     inserted besides the usual feast of St. Mark, patron of Venice, on     April 25 two more: that of his apparition and the finding of his     relics on June 25 and a third feast on Jan. 31 (translation). The     last two were special for the diocese of Venice (Aquileia). The     calendar for Aquileia is given at the beginning of Grotefend, _op.     cit._, Vol. 1, but does not quite tally with Leardo’s list of     saints. Perhaps this is because Grotefend has modernized the     calendar. It may be that Leardo, living perhaps elsewhere than in     Venice or its diocese, put in feasts that were dear to him. Indeed,     in view of your findings for latitude from the length of the days     [see preceding note], Rome is the most likely place, perhaps, for     the Venetian embassy. It lies nearly in lat. 42° N; if we allow for     Leardo measuring the length of the days according to the apparent     sunset and sunrise, this may well explain a discrepancy of the     greater part of a degree.”  [15]Berchet, _op. cit._, p. 7.

[18]Kretschmer, CE see p. 63.  [19]Particularly the famous Catalan Atlas of 1375 see p. 63.  [20]For the names of and for bibliographical references relating to some     of these maps see the list of references on pp. 63-67, _sub_ CD,     Mauro, Piz., Vat., Vilad.  [21]This Latin translation of Ptolemy’s _Geography_ was begun by the     Byzantine scholar Emmanuel Chrysoloras and completed by Jacopus     Angelus in 1410; manuscripts of this translation were accompanied by     maps, which, however, differ from the well-known maps in the     Ptolemaic atlases of the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The     latter were the work of Dominus Nicolaus Germanus, known as Nicholas     Donis. See A. E. Nordenskiöld, _Facsimile Atlas to the Early History     of Cartography_, transl. by J. A. Ekelöf and Clements R. Markham,     Stockholm, 1889, pp. 9-10.  [22]Like the Leardo map of 1452, the map of Walsperger, 1448, reveals     Ptolemaic influence in some of its names although all the     topographical features are strictly medieval. The Genoese world map     of 1447 in its elliptical form is the result of a more serious     attempt to reconcile the Ptolemaic geography with the traditional     views. See Kretschmer, CE, pp. 76-77; on the Walsperger map,     Kretschmer, _Eine neue mittelalterliche Weltkarte der vatikanischen     Bibliothek_, in _Zeitschr. Gesell. für Erdkunde zu Berlin_, Vol. 26,     1891, pp. 371-406, reference on pp. 376-377. On the Genoese world     map see the extended commentary of Fischer, _op. cit._, pp. 155-206.  [23]Kret., CE pp. 82-83.  [24]See Kret., Port., pp. 81-93; see also E. L. Stevenson, _Portolan     Charts: Their Origin and Characteristics, with a Descriptive List of     those Belonging to the Hispanic Society of America_, New York, 1911,     p. 19, where it is suggested that the faulty orientation of the     Mediterranean may be in part connected with the persistence since     the time of Ptolemy of the practice of placing Constantinople on     maps “too far to the north by at least two degrees.”                                     APPENDIX                       DETAILED COMMENTS ON THE MAP                                 Explanation  The following commentary is divided into sections numbered with Roman numerals corresponding to the Roman numerals on the general key map (Fig. 4, at end of book). Each item is given an Arabic numeral which corresponds to the Arabic numerals on the detailed key maps (Figs. 5-10, at end of book).  For each feature which bears a place name and for each longer legend on the Leardo map the transcription is given below in italic. Many of these transcriptions, particularly of names written on edifices (castles, churches, etc.), are mere guesses, owing to the obscurity of the original. Particular difficulty was encountered in distinguishing between the letters _a_, _e_, _o_, _c_, and _t_, and between _s_ and _f_. A clue to the reading of many names, however, was furnished by other maps contemporary with or earlier than that of Leardo. Illegible letters are indicated by dots; doubtful readings by (?); interpolated letters are enclosed in square brackets. Illeg. means “wholly illegible.”  No data beside the transcriptions are given for such names as _f. tigris_, _corsicha_, _galizia_, etc., the meaning of which is obvious.  In the case of the less familiar names, the forms in which they appear on certain other medieval maps are supplied. In general, if a name occurs on the Catalan Atlas of 1375 (CA), on the Catalan map in the Este Library at Modena (CE), or on the Ptolemaic maps (Ptol.), no attempt is made to indicate its occurrence elsewhere.  Each doubtful identification with a medieval name is preceded by ?. For names along the coast of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea, and the Atlantic, references are given to the pages in Kretschmer’s _Die italienischen Portolane des Mittelalters_ (= Kret., Port.) where the variant spellings of these names as they are found in the more important portolans and portolan charts are listed and the places identified with modern localities.  Identifications with modern localities are indicated by =, or =mod.; with well-known ancient localities by =anct. Suggested but doubtful identifications are preceded by =?, and names for which I have been unable to find or to suggest any identification with a modern locality are indicated by =? standing alone.  With the identification of Ptolemaic and medieval names in the Far East, in Africa, and in Scandinavia, we enter upon a hazardous and controversial field. While in many instances I have indicated identifications that have been made by competent scholars, needless to say, these should not be accepted as final. One cannot but feel that where an identification is based upon mere similarity in sound it is often a case of one man’s guess being as good as another’s. The scope and purpose of the present study does not permit of an exhaustive examination of these questions of detail.  For more complete bibliographical data relating to publications referred to in abbreviated form in the key and for an explanation of the abbreviations, see pp. 63-67. In bibliographical references volume numbers are indicated in lower case Roman, book numbers in upper case Roman, and chapter and page numbers in Arabic type.   On the key maps where there are long rows of place names the first and last numbers only are indicated, with an arrow connecting them. This is done to avoid overcrowding.  The Arabic numerals are in general placed in positions corresponding to those of the legends on the original. This leads in some instances to the separation of the numbers from the symbols to which they relate (_e.g._, 73).                               I.

II. Far Eastern Asia  The surface of the map northwest of the Terrestrial Paradise has been rubbed in such a way that many of the names are illegible.

No corresponding mountain shown on either CA or CE.                                    Rivers  The river system is more elaborate than, although somewhat analogous in its general pattern to, that of CA and CE. The Indus and its branches seem to be lacking on the Catalan maps. I am unable to trace the origin of several of the river names.  77 _f. priolada_:=?  78 _f. tindarus_:=?  79 _f. masa|rus_:=?  80 _f. sumas_:=?  81 _f. bindas_: Bindas Fl. of India intra Gangem Fluvium (Ptol., VII, 1, 6 (FA25)); possibly the name is related to that of Bhiwandi near Bassein, N of Bombay (Tomaschek, in PW, iii, 268-269).  82 _f. madus_: Namadus Fl. of India intra Gangem Fluvium, Ptol. (VII, 1:5 (FA25)).  83 _f. amarus_: Amarus is given as another name for the Indus on Vat. (Pullé, Vat., 16-17); no Amarus Fl. in Ptol.  84 _f.
