Hunger-driven, she climbed to the edge and exercised her wings until she managed some sort of flight to a neighbouring bush. She missed the twig and fell to the ground, where she lay cold and shivering.  She cried pitifully, and was almost dead when a brown-faced, barefoot boy, with a fishing-pole on his shoulder, passed and heard her.  \"Poor little thing, you are almost dead,\" he said.  \"I know what I'll do with you.  I'll take you over and set you in the bushes where I heard those other redbirds, and then your ma will feed you.\"  The boy turned back and carefully set her on a limb close to one of her brothers, and there she got just enough food to keep her alive.  So her troubles continued.  Once a squirrel chased her, and she saved herself by crowding into a hole so small her pursuer could not follow. The only reason she escaped a big blue racer when she went to take her first bath, was that a hawk had his eye on the snake and snapped it up at just the proper moment to save the poor, quivering little bird.  She was left so badly frightened that she could not move for a long time.  All the tribulations of birdland fell to her lot.  She was so frail and weak she lost her family in migration, and followed with some strangers that were none too kind.  Life in the South had been full of trouble. Once a bullet grazed her so closely she lost two of her wing quills, and that made her more timid than ever.  Coming North, she had given out again and finally had wandered into Rainbow Bottom, lost and alone.  She was such a shy, fearsome little body, the females all flouted her; and the males never seemed to notice that there was material in her for a very fine mate.  Every other female cardinal in Rainbow Bottom had several males courting her, but this poor, frightened, lonely one had never a suitor; and she needed love so badly!  Now she had been kissed by this magnificent stranger!  Of course, she knew it really was not her kiss.  He had intended it for the bold creature that had answered his challenge, but since it came to her, it was hers, in a way, after all.  She hid in the underbrush for the remainder of the day, and was never so frightened in all her life. She brooded over it constantly, and morning found her at the down curve of the horseshoe, straining her ears for the rarest note she ever had heard.  All day she hid and waited, and the following days were filled with longing, but he never came again.  So one morning, possessed with courage she did not understand, and filled with longing that drove her against her will, she started down the river.  For miles she sneaked through the underbrush, and watched and listened; until at last night came, and she returned to Rainbow Bottom.  The next morning she set out early and flew to the spot from which she had turned back the night before.  From there she glided through the bushes and underbrush, trembling and quaking, yet pushing stoutly onward, straining her ears for some note of the brilliant stranger's.  It was mid-forenoon when she reached the region of the sumac, and as she hopped warily along, only a short distance from her, full and splendid, there burst the voice of the singer for whom she was searching.  She sprang into air, and fled a mile before she realized that she was flying.  Then she stopped and listened, and rolling with the river, she heard those bold true tones.  Close to earth, she went back again, to see if, unobserved, she could find a spot where she might watch the stranger that had kissed her. When at last she reached a place where she could see him plainly, his beauty was so bewildering, and his song so enticing that she gradually hopped closer and closer without knowing she was moving.  High in the sumac the Cardinal had sung until his throat was parched, and the fountain of hope was almost dry.  There was nothing save defeat from overwhelming numbers in Rainbow Bottom.  He had paraded, and made all the music he ever had been taught, and improvised much more.  Yet no one had come to seek him.  Was it of necessity to be the Limberlost then? This one day more he would retain his dignity and his location. He tipped, tilted, and flirted.  He whistled, and sang, and trilled. Over the lowland and up and down the shining river, ringing in every change he could invent, he sent for the last time his prophetic message, \"Wet year! Wet year!\"    Chapter 3  \"Come here! Come here!\" entreated the Cardinal   He felt that his music was not reaching his standard as he burst into this new song.  He was almost discouraged.  No way seemed open to him but flight to the Limberlost, and he so disdained the swamp that love-making would lose something of its greatest charm if he were driven there for a mate.  The time seemed ripe for stringent measures, and the Cardinal was ready to take them; but how could he stringently urge a little mate that would not come on his imploring invitations? He listlessly pecked at the berries and flung abroad an inquiring \"Chip!\" With just an atom of hope, he frequently mounted to his choir-loft and issued an order that savoured far more of a plea, \"Come here! Come here!\" and then, leaning, he listened intently to the voice of the river, lest he fail to catch the faintest responsive \"Chook!\" it might bear.  He could hear the sniffling of carp wallowing beside the bank.  A big pickerel slashed around, breakfasting on minnows.  Opposite the sumac, the black bass, with gamy spring, snapped up, before it struck the water, every luckless, honey-laden insect that fell from the feast of sweets in a blossom-whitened wild crab.  The sharp bark of the red squirrel and the low of cattle, lazily chewing their cuds among the willows, came to him.  The hammering of a woodpecker on a dead sycamore, a little above him, rolled to his straining ears like a drum beat.  The Cardinal hated the woodpecker more than he disliked the dove.  It was only foolishly effusive, but the woodpecker was a veritable Bluebeard.  The Cardinal longed to pull the feathers from his back until it was as red as his head, for the woodpecker had dressed his suit in finest style, and with dulcet tones and melting tenderness had gone acourting.  Sweet as the dove's had been his wooing, and one more pang the lonely Cardinal had suffered at being forced to witness his felicity; yet scarcely had his plump, amiable little mate consented to his caresses and approved the sycamore, before he turned on her, pecked her severely, and pulled a tuft of plumage from her breast.  There was not the least excuse for this tyrannical action; and the sight filled the Cardinal with rage.  He fully expected to see Madam Woodpecker divorce herself and flee her new home, and he most earnestly hoped that she would; but she did no such thing.  She meekly flattened her feathers, hurried work in a lively manner, and tried in every way to anticipate and avert her mate's displeasure.  Under this treatment he grew more abusive, and now Madam Woodpecker dodged every time she came within his reach.  It made the Cardinal feel so vengeful that he longed to go up and drum the sycamore with the woodpecker's head until he taught him how to treat his mate properly.  There was plently of lark music rolling with the river, and that morning brought the first liquid golden notes of the orioles.  They had arrived at dawn, and were overjoyed with their homecoming, for they were darting from bank to bank singing exquisitely on wing.  There seemed no end to the bird voices that floated with the river, and yet there was no beginning to the one voice for which the Cardinal waited with passionate longing.  The oriole's singing was so inspiring that it tempted the Cardinal to another effort, and perching where he gleamed crimson and black against the April sky, he tested his voice, and when sure of his tones, he entreatingly called: \"Come here! Come here!\"  Just then he saw her!  She came daintily over the earth, soft as down before the wind, a rosy flush suffusing her plumage, a coral beak, her very feet pink--the shyest, most timid little thing alive.  Her bright eyes were popping with fear, and down there among the ferns, anemones and last year's dried leaves, she tilted her sleek crested head and peered at him with frightened wonder and silent helplessness.  It was for this the Cardinal had waited, hoped, and planned for many days.  He had rehearsed what he conceived to be every point of the situation, and yet he was not prepared for the thing that suddenly happened to him.  He had expected to reject many applicants before he selected one to match his charms; but instantly this shy little creature, slipping along near earth, taking a surreptitious peep at him, made him feel a very small bird, and he certainly never before had felt small.  The crushing possibility that somewhere there might be a cardinal that was larger, brighter, and a finer musician than he, staggered him; and worst of all, his voice broke suddenly to his complete embarrassment.  Half screened by the flowers, she seemed so little, so shy, so delightfully sweet.  He \"chipped\" carefully once or twice to steady himself and clear his throat, for unaccountably it had grown dry and husky; and then he tenderly tried again.  \"Come here! Come here!\" implored the Cardinal.  He forgot all about his dignity.  He knew that his voice was trembling with eagerness and hoarse with fear.  He was afraid to attempt approaching her, but he leaned toward her, begging and pleading.  He teased and insisted, and he did not care a particle if he did.  It suddenly seemed an honour to coax her.  He rocked on the limb.  He side-stepped and hopped and gyrated gracefully.  He fluffed and flirted and showed himself to every advantage.  It never occurred to him that the dove and the woodpecker might be watching, though he would not have cared in the least if they had been; and as for any other cardinal, he would have attacked the combined forces of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/533"],["title","The Song of the Cardinal (#7)"],["body","and Rainbow Bottom.  He sang and sang.  Every impulse of passion in his big, crimson, palpitating body was thrown into those notes; but she only turned her head from side to side, peering at him, seeming sufficiently frightened to flee at a breath, and answered not even the faintest little \"Chook!\" of encouragement.  The Cardinal rested a second before he tried again.  That steadied him and gave him better command of himself.  He could tell that his notes were clearing and growing sweeter.  He was improving.  Perhaps she was interested.  There was some encouragement in the fact that she was still there.  The Cardinal felt that his time had come.  \"Come here! Come here!\" He was on his mettle now.  Surely no cardinal could sing fuller, clearer, sweeter notes! He began at the very first, and rollicked through a story of adventure, colouring it with every wild, dashing, catchy note he could improvise.  He followed that with a rippling song of the joy and fulness of spring, in notes as light and airy as the wind-blown soul of melody, and with swaying body kept time to his rhythmic measures.  Then he glided into a song of love, and tenderly, pleadingly, passionately, told the story as only a courting bird can tell it.  Then he sang a song of ravishment; a song quavering with fear and the pain tugging at his heart.  He almost had run the gamut, and she really appeared as if she intended to flee rather than to come to him.  He was afraid to take even one timid little hop toward her.  In a fit of desperation the Cardinal burst into the passion song.  He arose to his full height, leaned toward her with outspread quivering wings, and crest flared to the utmost, and rocking from side to side in the intensity of his fervour, he poured out a perfect torrent of palpitant song.  His cardinal body swayed to the rolling flood of his ecstatic tones, until he appeared like a flaming pulsing note of materialized music, as he entreated, coaxed, commanded, and pled.  From sheer exhaustion, he threw up his head to round off the last note he could utter, and breathlessly glancing down to see if she were coming, caught sight of a faint streak of gray in the distance. He had planned so to subdue the little female he courted that she would come to him; he was in hot pursuit a half day's journey away before he remembered it.  No other cardinal ever endured such a chase as she led him in the following days.  Through fear and timidity she had kept most of her life in the underbrush.  The Cardinal was a bird of the open fields and tree-tops.  He loved to rock with the wind, and speed arrow-like in great plunges of flight.  This darting and twisting over logs, among leaves, and through tangled thickets, tired, tried, and exasperated him more than hundreds of miles of open flight.  Sometimes he drove her from cover, and then she wildly dashed up-hill and down-dale, seeking another thicket; but wherever she went, the Cardinal was only a breath behind her, and with every passing mile his passion for her grew.  There was no time to eat, bathe, or sing; only mile after mile of unceasing pursuit.  It seemed that the little creature could not stop if she would, and as for the Cardinal, he was in that chase to remain until his last heart-beat.  It was a question how the frightened bird kept in advance.  She was visibly the worse for this ardent courtship. Two tail feathers were gone, and there was a broken one beating from her wing.  Once she had flown too low, striking her head against a rail until a drop of blood came, and she cried pitifully.  Several times the Cardinal had cornered her, and tried to hold her by a bunch of feathers, and compel her by force to listen to reason; but she only broke from his hold and dashed away a stricken thing, leaving him half dead with longing and remorse.  But no matter how baffled she grew, or where she fled in her headlong flight, the one thing she always remembered, was not to lead the Cardinal into the punishment that awaited him in Rainbow Bottom. Panting for breath, quivering with fear, longing for well-concealed retreats, worn and half blinded by the disasters of flight through strange country, the tired bird beat her aimless way; but she would have been torn to pieces before she would have led her magnificent pursuer into the wrath of his enemies.  Poor little feathered creature!  She had been fleeing some kind of danger all her life.  She could not realize that love and protection had come in this splendid guise, and she fled on and on.  Once the Cardinal, aching with passion and love, fell behind that she might rest, and before he realized that another bird was close, an impudent big relative of his, straying from the Limberlost, entered the race and pursued her so hotly that with a note of utter panic she wheeled and darted back to the Cardinal for protection.  When to the rush of rage that possessed him at the sight of a rival was added the knowledge that she was seeking him in her extremity, such a mighty wave of anger swept the Cardinal that he appeared twice his real size.  Like a flaming brand of vengeance he struck that Limberlost upstart, and sent him rolling to earth, a mass of battered feathers.  With beak and claw he made his attack, and when he so utterly demolished his rival that he hopped away trembling, with dishevelled plumage stained with his own blood, the Cardinal remembered his little love and hastened back, confidently hoping for his reward.  She was so securely hidden, that although he went searching, calling, pleading, he found no trace of her the remainder of that day.  The Cardinal almost went distracted; and his tender imploring cries would have moved any except a panic-stricken bird.  He did not even know in what direction to pursue her.  Night closed down, and found him in a fever of love-sick fear, but it brought rest and wisdom.  She could not have gone very far.  She was too worn.  He would not proclaim his presence.  Soon she would suffer past enduring for food and water.  He hid in the willows close where he had lost her, and waited with what patience he could; and it was a wise plan.  Shortly after dawn, moving stilly as the break of day, trembling with fear, she came slipping to the river for a drink.  It was almost brutal cruelty, but her fear must be overcome someway; and with a cry of triumph the Cardinal, in a plunge of flight, was beside her.  She gave him one stricken look, and dashed away.  The chase began once more and continued until she was visibly breaking.  There was no room for a rival that morning.  The Cardinal flew abreast of her and gave her a caress or attempted a kiss whenever he found the slightest chance.  She was almost worn out, her flights were wavering and growing shorter.  The Cardinal did his utmost.  If she paused to rest, he crept close as he dared, and piteously begged: \"Come here! Come here!\"  When she took wing, he so dexterously intercepted her course that several time she found refuge in his sumac without realizing where she was.  When she did that, he perched just as closely as he dared; and while they both rested, he sang to her a soft little whispered love song, deep in his throat; and with every note he gently edged nearer. She turned her head from him, and although she was panting for breath and palpitant with fear, the Cardinal knew that he dared not go closer, or she would dash away like the wild thing she was.  The next time she took wing, she found him so persistently in her course that she turned sharply and fled panting to the sumac.  When this had happened so often that she seemed to recognize the sumac as a place of refuge, the Cardinal slipped aside and spent all his remaining breath in an exultant whistle of triumph, for now he was beginning to see his way. He dashed into mid-air, and with a gyration that would have done credit to a flycatcher, he snapped up a gadfly that should have been more alert.  With a tender \"Chip!\" from branch to branch, slowly, cautiously, he came with it.  Because he was half starved himself, he knew that she must be almost famished.  Holding it where she could see, he hopped toward her, eagerly, carefully, the gadfly in his beak, his heart in his mouth.  He stretched his neck and legs to the limit as he reached the fly toward her.  What matter that she took it with a snap, and plunged a quarter of a mile before eating it?  She had taken food from him!  That was the beginning.  Cautiously he impelled her toward the sumac, and with untiring patience kept her there the remainder of the day.  He carried her every choice morsel he could find in the immediate vicinity of the sumac, and occasionally she took a bit from his beak, though oftenest he was compelled to lay it on a limb beside her.  At dusk she repeatedly dashed toward the underbrush; but the Cardinal, with endless patience and tenderness, maneuvered her to the sumac, until she gave up, and beneath the shelter of a neighbouring grapevine, perched on a limb that was the Cardinal's own chosen resting-place, tucked her tired head beneath her wing, and went to rest.  When she was soundly sleeping, the Cardinal crept as closely as he dared, and with one eye on his little gray love, and the other roving for any possible danger, he spent a night of watching for any danger that might approach.  He was almost worn out; but this was infinitely better than the previous night, at any rate, for now he not only knew where she was, but she was fast asleep in his own favourite place.  Huddled on the limb, the Cardinal gloated over her.  He found her beauty perfect.  To be sure, she was dishevelled; but she could make her toilet.  There were a few feathers gone; but they would grow speedily.  She made a heart-satisfying picture, on which the Cardinal feasted his love-sick soul, by the light of every straying moonbeam that slid around the edges of the grape leaves.  Wave after wave of tender passion shook him.  In his throat half the night he kept"]]]
