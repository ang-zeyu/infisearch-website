Tom, the owner of Hember, thought that as its fields marched with those of Wastralls, he ought to marry his cousin; while Constantine sought her because the glint of her bright hair had dazzled him.  A fine maid was Sabina, blue eyes flush with rounded cheeks, not the passionate eyes of Old Squire, but the blue of ice-depths when the sun is shining in a clear sky; and when it was a question of marriage she found the straight sticks who offered themselves for weapon and support were of a too familiar wood.  She would go a little farther into the forest.      _Arise up, Maid, all in your gown of green_       _For summer is a-come into day;_     _You are as fine a lady as wait upon the queen_       _In the merry morning of May._     _Arise up, Maid, out of your bed_       _For summer is a-come into day;_     _Your chamber shall be strewed with the white rose and the red_       _In the merry morning of May_ [*]  [*] Padstow Hobby-horse song.   The green waves of the Atlantic roll strange flotsam into the sandy bays of that bitter coast; and the sea, hungry though it be, can give up more than the dead. One summer on the bosom of a forgotten sunset, a boat had drifted into Morwen Cove, to strand, when the tide turned, amid the weed and rubbish of the foreshore. In it, swollen with cold, unconscious, nearly dead, lay a waif, the survivor of some obscure wreck.  Leadville Byron, a hind who with his childless wife lived over the disused fish-cellars at Wastralls, chanced upon the boat. Its contents stirred the father in him and, as he carried home the bit of human waste, his anxiety was lest it might be reclaimed; indeed he never quite lost his fear that what the sea had given the land, that unknown of towns and country beyond the hills, might take.  If inquiries were made, however, they did not reach Trevorrick and the child, a lusty, black-browed youngster, grew to manhood, without further change in his surroundings.  His native tongue had been unintelligible to the villagers and he could not give himself a name.  His foster-parents, therefore, felt themselves justified in calling him Leadville.  If his name were ever discovered he could return to it, meanwhile he was buttressed against the curiosity of strangers.  As was only natural the Byrons bred him to work on the land; and at eighteen, Wastralls—the delectable hillside, the edge of cliff, the tumuli of the ancient folk—were all he knew; indeed, it required a cataclysm to prove to him that he was not a clod of Wastralls earth.  In outward seeming the lad was not unlike the people among whom he lived.  A little more swarthy, with a more sombre expression in his dark eyes, a broader chest than was often seen, he might have passed for a Cornishman.  The difference was one of temperament and it was a difference so great, that never to the end of his life was he to be other to them than a ’foreigner.’  One autumn, after a rainy, reedy summer, a summer of losses, Mr. Rosevear was forced to believe he could work the farm with fewer labourers; and young Byron, being the last to join the little band of hinds, must be the first to go.  The lad took his dismissal hardly.  By dewing the land with his sweat he had made it his and, against his will, a deep and narrow will, he could not be disinherited.  He considered himself as much part of Wastralls as a bush of tamarisk in the hedge. As, however, he must go, he listened to his foster-father’s suggestion and returned temporarily to the great waters which had spewed him up. He went, but in every ship’s wake, in the reek of foreign cities, in the wind that blew from home, he saw visions of those few fields which to him were the world.  He had the inward eye of the dreamer and, as the year turned, saw spring drawing her green skirts over the hillside and hanging the orchard with her gossamers.  He saw the dandelions starring the thick grass by the river, the lush dark grass in which he had rolled himself moved by the ecstasy of life; and to him the salt sea was barren and unprofitable, a desert upon which he must go to and fro until the days of his pilgrimage were accomplished.  The death of old Byron brought the wanderer back to Hindoo Cottage—as the fish-cellars were called—only to find that the wife had followed her man; and that he—Leadville the younger—was again without even the semblance of a human tie.  He had not loved the old couple, love did not at any time come easily to him and all the emotion of which he was capable had long been concentrated upon Wastralls; but he was anxious to secure his foster-father’s berth as teamster.  To the outpourings of the neighbours he listened unheeding and presently took his way to the farmhouse, there to learn that Rosevear had been laid in a neater ditch than that of his inadvertent choice and that Sabina—big, ripe, fair, a woman who might have stepped out of the Elizabethan age—reigned in his stead.  The opportunity was self-evident and Byron, back in his place and once more happy, soon realized that his heart’s desire was within reach.  It was not Sabina that he wanted but Wastralls; and that, again, not for ambition’s sake, but because his late experience had taught him the value of security.  Asking no more of life than permission to spend his youth, his strength, his passion on the land, he found consent in Sabina’s awakening interest.  She had disdained the easy-kindled fires of Tom, of Constantine, and of the Tregols lads, but the sombre glow in Byron’s eyes was disturbing. It moved her as something unknown and full of a strange promise, that promise which is in the rising sap and germinating seed.  The neighbours expressed a kindly apprehension, for though marriage between persons of different race may be eugenically sound, it seldom brings happiness to the individual; but Sabina was beyond reason, for in the stranger she had found her mate.  Within a month the banns were called and a little later the oddly assorted couple pushed off into matrimony. Whereas, however, Byron believed himself to be marrying Wastralls—the good farm and the waste lands by the sea—making it for ever flesh of his flesh, his in indissoluble union, Sabina did not intend to endow her lover with her worldly goods.  She held the land by right of inheritance and by a worthier right, that of the farmer who deals understandingly with her fields.  Although she cultivated the farm in the way that had brought prosperity to the family, her stock was pedigree and realized good prices, her seed was the best procurable and she was always ready to try new manures and dressings.  She was not a woman of ideas, neither was she reactionary but a fold of Old Squire’s mantle hung from her shoulders and, as the neighbours said, \"to give the maid her due, her’s a first-rate farmer.\"  She loved her farm, but as a sportsman loves a good dog.  She exacted from it the utmost it could give and was its considerate master, but she could have no conception of Leadville’s attitude. If it had been explained to her that he loved the land as a man loves a woman, she would have doubted her informant, and if convinced have thought her husband a fool for his pains.  As it was, when he attempted to assert his new rights, as he did immediately after their marriage, she stared in surprise.  \"’Oo told you to give the orders to the ’inds when I’ve got a tongue of me own?\"  \"I thought I was savin’ of ’ee a lot of trouble.\"  \"I don’t want yer to do my work for me.  I can do it meself.\"  \"I should think you got enough to do indoors without goin’ outdoors workin’.  I don’t see what a woman want to be out in all weathers for.\"  Sabina laughed good-humouredly.  \"My dear feller, I always bin outdoor. Rain or fine don’t make any difference to me.\"  \"Well, my dear, you’ll lose all they good looks o’ yours.  I don’t like to see women all burned up.  You’ll be an old woman before you’m a young one.\"  \"I don’t care what I be, and I don’t believe a word you say is true. Ony’ow I shall chance it.\"  \"Well, ’tis the man’s place to teel the land.\"  \"A fine mess you’d make of it, too.  Look at the Mill fields!  If Con turned the ditches out they wouldn’t be so wet; even Tom don’t keep ’is fields so clean as mine.\"  \"I don’t care ’bout that, ’bain’t a woman’s work.\"  \"Aw, git away.  ’Tidn’t all women that want to farm; but those that do, let’m ’av it.  ’Tis just whether they can farm or can’t.\"  \"Well, I think it’s my business as I’m yer ’usband. You ought to let me ’av it.\"  \"What’s the good to let you ’av it, you dunno nothing about farmin’. You bin to sea most all yer life.  ’Tis years an’ years since you ploughed a bit o’ ground.\"  A dark colour came into the bridegroom’s cheek. \"’Ow can you say that when I was brought up on the land.  I knaw all about farm work.  ’Aving married you, to ’av the farm’s my due.\"  Sabina sat very straight in her chair.  \"Now once for all,\" said she, \"let’s settle this matter.  Wastralls is mine, and I dare you to so much as lay a finger on it. If you want to farm so much as all that, Higher Polnevas is to let, and its fields are joinin’ ours.  Why don’t you go over and take that?  I’ll let you ’av the money for that, but you won’t ’av Wastralls.\"  Byron had not expected opposition.  Sabina, being a woman, would naturally be glad to have the outdoor work taken off her hands.  His surprise at her attitude was so intense that he stared at her in a helpless silence, until she clinched the matter by exclaiming in her hearty, fresh-air voice, \"’Tis no good for ’ee to think anything about it.\"  This phrase opened the flood-gates.  Usually somewhat silent, he had moods when the words tumbled over each other in a multitude beyond counting.  Perceiving he had miscalculated he set to work to retrieve his error and, during the course of the evening, learnt many things but not how to make Sabina change her mind. The poor man, desperately afraid, did all he knew.  He entreated and she smiled, he blustered and she"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53370"],["title","Wastralls: A Novel (#2)"],["body","hed, he cajoled and she warmed to him but, though she warmed, she did not weaken.  Her first word was her last: \"’Tis no good for ’ee to think anything about it.\"  Byron was helpless.  He could not win her to his will, neither could he break her.  She was capable, as she let him see, of separating from him. If he appealed to the hinds, they would side with her.  Her cousins at Hember and St. Cadic, the neighbours in the adjacent valleys, would take her part.  Turning the matter over, however, he perceived that time, by giving Sabina fresh interests, fresh cares, might prove his friend.  Nurslings tie the mother to the house and when the babies came his wife would have her hands full.  She must let go what she could not hold; and he would be ready to pick up, bit by bit, what she let fall.  In this hope he settled to his new life.  It was unthinkable that he should attempt to farm Higher Polnevas, when his mind was filled with Wastralls.  Of a brooding nature, through which at times flames of emotion broke, he was content to spend his days thinking out and dwelling on the changes he would make when his opportunity came. Sabina’s farming, cautious and well-considered, chafed him.  He wanted the land to bring forth a hundredfold where she now gave a mere return. He was her lover asking of her all that she could give, eager only to have the exploiting of her possibilities.  To make her fruitful was to be his work.  He saw the seed swell in her bosom, the silent marvel of growth, the harvest that should reward his husbandry; and, because out of the heart the mouth speaketh, when he talked it was of intensive farming, of the money that lay in sugar-beet, strawberries, asparagus, of market-gardening and the use of glass.  Thereby he damaged his cause; for Sabina, listening, came to the conclusion that she had married an unpractical dreamer.  If he believed in his theories why did he not rent land and prove them?  That he only talked, satisfied her that she had been right in her refusal to let him farm Wastralls and her grip on the land tightened.  The kindly fields deserved better of her than that she should put them at the mercy of a dreamer.  Whether or no the man’s life that she led did her disservice, it is certain that no children came to modify the situation.  In the loft, the carved wooden cradle lay with only the wind to set it a-rock; below, the rooms were as empty of new life as is a whispering conch.  The bustle of the farm was like the swish of water about a rock islet, that little spot of sterility and stagnation at the heart of multitudinous life. Sabina, who had natural instincts, who had mothered a bibulous father and many a bit of life from the fields and hedges, was disappointed; but her feeling was mild compared with that of her husband.  His children were to have delivered Wastralls into his hand, assuaged at last the long ache of his passion; but the years turned on their axes, going as they had come.  At first Byron bore himself with a good courage. After the unprofitable days of his seafaring it was enough to watch the tamarisk stems warming into red life, to spend the daylight wandering over the well-known ground, to return at night to the grey house on its shelf of rock.  If, after a while, these delights palled, it was because they led nowhither.  Meanwhile, under Sabina’s judicious management, the farm prospered. Neither cared to spend, the one because she had no wants, the other because what he desired could not be bought.  With every year the bank stocking grew heavier, also the man’s heart; and every year found his thoughts fixed more bitterly upon his disappointment.  Sabina saw but without understanding. Her man was moody, foolish too with his perpetual harping on his rights, but she was not thereby alienated, for, wise or unreasonable, he was her man.  Though she envied Tom his houseful of daughters and Constantine his big sons, her own lack left her the more leisure to care for her husband’s comfort.  The standard of living at Wastralls was higher than that of the surrounding farms.  Byron ate according to his fancy and lay soft; was given indeed those things to which he was indifferent, and denied that after which he hungered.  \"I’m kep’ like a prize bullock,\" he said morosely, \"when what I want is to be workin’ and doin’ for meself.\"  \"Well, my dear, ’oo told you not to work?  There’s plenty to do, there’s that four-acre field, why don’t yer go and plough up that, ’stead of in ’ere mumpin’ about?\"  \"As though I was yer ’ind?\"  \"What, still wantin’ to be maister?\"  \"Iss, an’ shall be till I die.\"  \"Now look ’ere.  If you want money to buy Polnevas you can ’av it, but Wastralls you will never ’av.\"  \"Well, if I can’t ’av Wastralls I won’t ’av nothing; but you mark my words\"—he bent towards her and brought one hand with a thump into the palm of the other—\"if I can’t ’av it by ’itch, I will by crook.\"  \"Not so long as I live then, any’ow.\"  Byron was slightly underhung, a formation which gives the face a look of strength and purpose.  \"We shall see, some day, which of us is the strongest of the two.\"  The woman, happy in her work and with her main affection satisfied, could answer with reasonable good-humour: \"Well, my dear feller, ’tis my land and I must do my duty by it.  ’Tis I’m responsible, not you, to the folks up yonder,\" and a movement of her bright head indicated the burial-ground at Church Town.  \"I’m sorry you’re disappointed, but I can’t ’elp it.\"  \"Oh, hang it—sorry?\"  \"Well, I be sorry.  I’d like for ’ee to ’av everything to make yer ’appy; but Wastralls I can’t give.\"  She smiled at him in her friendly fashion, a sweet inviting smile.  \"I do my best to make it up to yer in other ways and that you know.\"  \"Iss, I want bread and you do give me a stone.\"  He turned away, leaving her, as ever, uncomprehending. It was impossible for her to think of him as other than a child, who for his own sake must be denied and prevented, who was hers to care for and, in ways that could not harm him, to indulge.  The truth to her, as to so many of us, would have been unbelievable.  The break-up of the situation was due to an accident. Sabina had driven a young horse to the fair at St. Columb Major and this animal, excited by the unwonted traffic, the smells and the noise, became unmanageable.  Plunging down the hill, he came into collision with a heavy van.  The prancing feet slipped and he fell, shooting his driver over the shafts. Though clear of horse and cart, she was flung with considerable violence against the front wheel of the van.  This startled the van horses and the heavy lumbersome creatures, with a prodigious clatter, started up the street.  Sabina, rendered unconscious by the blow she had received, had fallen between the wheels and the van, lurching forward, passed over her.  It was thought at first that she was killed but the crushed woman who, later that afternoon, was admitted to the little hospital at Stowe, was still breathing.  As the case seemed hopeless, the husband was sent for, and Byron, in a ferment of excitement, came pounding in on the heels of the messenger.  His horse was in a lather when he checked him at the hospital gate.  \"Poor Sabina, poor old girl, it was a terrible thing for her to die as she lived; away from home like that.  No doubt ’er ’ead was full of the farmin’, never once thought of dyin’, but the Lorrd would be merciful.\"  \"If she’s goin’ to die, don’t ’ee keep it from me,\" he said to Dr. Derek, who was in charge of the case.  \"I’d rather knaw the worst.\"  \"And,\" as he explained to the neighbours, on his return home, after being allowed to glance at the unconscious face on the pillow, \"the poor doctor ’ee couldn’t give me no encouragement.\"                                   *CHAPTER II*   The sight of Sabina, her florid face grey against the white bandages, her pale lips open to facilitate the drawing of difficult breath, had convinced her husband that she could not possibly recover.  That evening he called the hinds together, told them what had happened, and for the first time gave them their orders.  As he went back into the house, old George Biddick, who had been many years on the farm, and was of a noticing disposition, drew the attention of a new-come labourer to the receding figure.  \"Speaks as though ’e’d been maister all the time, don’t ’e?  An’ carries ’isself pretty straight, too, considerin’ as ’e’m bowed wi’ grief.\"  \"I don’t s’pose ’e realize things yet,\" said Jim, a Rosevear from across the hills.  \"Must ’av been tarr’ble shock for’n.\"  The other man glanced sideways out of small brown eyes, and gave a non-committal grunt.  He was queerly shaped, with a high-shouldered short body and long legs and, being related to most of the cottagers, was known generally as \"Uncle George!\"  \"Dunno so much about that.  Missus is so strong as a dunkey,\" he said, as he returned to his work of bedding down the horses, \"an’ she may chate the crows yet.\"  But Jim Rosevear was not listening, his thoughts had run before him up the road, to where, at the stone stile, a maid would be waiting.  The rest of the world might be concerned with death; but he was young and his concern was with life, more life.  When, on the following day, Byron rode over to the hospital, he was told that his wife still breathed; but that an operation had become necessary, an operation which it was scarcely possible she could survive.  He found it difficult to understand why it must be.  \"Why punish ’er so?  Wouldn’t it be better to let ’er die quiet than to ’ack ’er about?\"  The wheel of the van had gone over both legs, crushing together bone and flesh and the surgeon proposed to amputate.  The limbs were injured beyond hope of saving; and it was explained that their removal might give the patient a chance.  \"Do you think then, sir,\" said the anxious husband, \"that she’ll be better if she ’av the operation?\"  \"She may.  The condition is critical and unless the operation is"]]]
