A New Era Begins (#7)"],["body","to operate at 60 words per minute, and manufacture of this apparatus was started in 1927 (see figure 11). The No. 15 page printer became the standard for nationwide intercommunicating telegraph service for many years.  In 1926, soon after the No. 14 tape printer was put into service, Morkrum-Kleinschmidt received a request from the police department of Berlin, Germany, for detailed information, stating that they were interested in the purchase of about sixty No. 14 printers. The letter asked if Morkrum-Kleinschmidt was represented by an agent in Germany whom they could contact. At an executive meeting, Mr. Morton and Mr. Krum asked Mr. Kleinschmidt to take care of this matter since his company, before joining them, had sold apparatus in some foreign countries. After further correspondence with the Berlin police officials, Kleinschmidt decided personally to take a No. 14 printer to Germany and arrange for a representative there. After visiting and conferring with several companies experienced in the telegraph and associated apparatus field, a satisfactory arrangement was consummated with the C. Lorenz Company, on October 25, 1926, for the manufacture and sale of Morkrum-Kleinschmidt equipment in Germany, on a royalty-licensing basis. At that time the Lorenz company manufactured telegraph and telephone equipment and railway signaling apparatus. Their engineering department was under the supervision of Dr. Gerhard Grimsen who took the matter in hand for further exploitation toward an intercommunicating printing telegraph system, using the No. 15 page teletypewriter. Siemens & Halske, the principal manufacturers of telegraph equipment in Germany, were also licensed by the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation, on June 1, 1929, with the consent of the Lorenz company.      [Illustration: Fig. 11                   Morkrum-Kleinschmidt No. 15 Page Printer                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]  (As may be seen in the following chapter, it was these licensing arrangements which led to the establishment of the TELEX intercommunicating teleprinter system in Europe.)  In early 1927 the well-known newspaper publisher, Mr. Frank E. Gannett, came to Morkrum-Kleinschmidt, bringing his company’s engineer, Mr. Walter Morey, who had heard of various attempts to operate a typesetting machine, such as Linotype or Intertype, directly from the telegraph. Mr. Gannett said, “We have telegraph typewriters in our news rooms that record the news as transmitted from the Associated Press and the United Press, and that is fine. Now, why not go a step further and operate our typesetting machines directly from the telegraph circuit? If you can develop such a device, I will help finance the project.”  Indeed, after some study of the matter, the possibility of devising such a system seemed entirely feasible and the development of suitable apparatus was turned over to the research and development department. A workable plan was soon put together and a separate company, the Teletypesetter Company, was organized, with Mr. Gannett joining financially. Edward Kleinschmidt was elected president. Development proceeded and a complete set of apparatus was set up and publicly demonstrated for the first time on December 6, 1928, at one of Mr. Gannett’s newspapers, _The Times Union_ of Rochester, New York. Teletypesetter equipment was subsequently manufactured for several installations. After the Western Electric Company purchased the Teletype Corporation in 1930, the Teletypesetter Company was sold to the Fairchild Company. Teletypesetter equipment is now in universal use by most newspapers and the larger printing companies.  During the period that the United States’ business cycle was on a continuous upswing (during the late 1920s), securities sales on the New York Stock Exchange were going to constantly higher volume, and the old step-by-step stock ticker did not, by large margins, keep pace in recording stock share transactions. There was a cry for a higher speed stock ticker; in fact, the Stock Exchange officials told Morkrum-Kleinschmidt that they would be happy to convert the entire system if they could get higher speed.  An adaptation of the five-unit-code, start-stop system seemed the solution and the Research and Development department set out to develop suitable apparatus. Several ideas were studied and, because of the frequent changes from letters to figures, requiring printing in separate rows on the tape, a six-unit code was adapted instead in which combinations for a figure included the sixth selecting pulse to operate the figures print hammer and block the letters print hammer.      [Illustration: Fig. 12                Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation Stock Ticker                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]  The Morkrum-Kleinschmidt company was soon able to show the Stock Exchange people a stock ticker operating on a telegraph system that worked at twice the speed of the step-by-step-operated tickers then in use. A speed of 500 printing operations per minute could be obtained, thus attaining a one-hundred-percent increase in the transmitting and recording of stock quotations on the tape (see figure 12). The Stock Exchange ticker service company ordered 15,000 of these high-speed tickers and the Western Union Telegraph Company also ordered a quantity for their national stock quotations distributing systems.  As business of the combined Morkrum and Kleinschmidt companies went along, it was thought that the name “Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Corporation” was a pretty big mouthful and that a simpler name more characteristic of its products would be better. The name “Teletype” was suggested, and in the year 1928 the name change to “Teletype Corporation” was made. The exact origin of the word “teletype” is not known but it is no doubt one of the abbreviated forms of the words “telegraph typewriter” which were used over the years. In literature, in the early 1900s, we find that the word “teletype,” in speaking of printing telegraph equipment, and other shortened forms, such as “telewriter” and “teletyper,” were used interchangeably.  Kleinschmidt’s son, Edward F., who studied electrical engineering at Steven’s Institute and at Northwestern University, was employed as development engineer by the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt company where he assisted in the design of projects at hand, and, during 1929, produced a system and apparatus for transmitting and recording printed characters by the successive transmission of dots arranged in a pattern to form letters. While this system required a higher signaling frequency, it was thought to be superior to permutation-code transmission over radio circuits where electrostatic interference is experienced, since, in the dot pattern transmission, electrostatic interference up to a degree will not change the readability of a transmitted letter.  The system was in test operation to prove its efficiency over radio circuits where considerable static interference was experienced. Upon hearing of this new telegraph for the radio, Mr. R. Stanley Dollar became interested in the use of this communicating system for his steamship line. There was considerable correspondence in this matter during mid-1930, just prior to the sale of Teletype; however, neither AT&T nor Western Electric was interested in further promoting this new radio telegraph, so the matter was dropped.  Business activities of Teletype Corporation were now growing rapidly and with good profit. The capital structure of 10,000 shares was wholly inadequate, so by a 15-to-1 stock dividend the capital structure was raised to 150,000 shares, and dividends on an annual basis of $12.00 were paid.  The successful development of apparatus for different applications useful in the telegraph field was largely due to the close cooperation between the research-development and the manufacturing departments of the organization. Howard Krum had expert engineers and designers in his department, Kleinschmidt brought his leading engineers and designers from the Long Island City plant, and there was a definite spirit of cooperation all around.  To quote again from the _Fortune_ magazine story:[10]    As the years up to 1925, when the Kleinschmidt-Morkrum merger took   place, were wanderings in a profitless desert, so the years from 1925   to 1930 found the teletype in a land of milk and honey. Mr. Morton,   however, was inclined to think that a company which had only two or   three major customers is not strongly placed. Furthermore (and by the   spring of 1930), at least one of those customers was actively in the   market as a Teletype purchaser. This buyer was Colonel Sosthenes Behn,   whose International Telephone & Telegraph Co. includes Postal   Telegraph at home in addition to many communication and manufacturing   companies abroad. With Colonel Behn wanting to buy and Mr. Morton   wanting to sell, negotiations rapidly proceeded to a point at which   Mr. Morton, at least, thought the deal was almost concluded. But while   Mr. Morton and the Colonel were discussing the prospective   acquisition, into the Colonel’s office walked a man who has no other   place in this story except that he happened to interrupt at this   moment. As this gentleman was introduced, he asked whether Mr. Morton   were related to Joy or Paul Morton. When Mr. Morton admitted that they   were his father and uncle, the man turned to Colonel Behn and said in   jest: “Better watch your step. That’s a smart family.” Only Colonel   Behn knows whether he gave that remark any weight, but the point is   that the negotiations suddenly collapsed, and that the visitor’s   remark about the smart family still lives vividly in Mr. Morton’s   memory.    This setback was not a setback at all to such a negotiator as Mr.   Morton. Two months later, in May, 1930, you find him walking into the   office of Clarence G. Stoll, vice president of Western Electric, A. T.   & "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53481"],["title","Printing Telegraphy... A New Era Begins (#8)"],["body","T.’s manufacturing subsidiary. This time there had been no   preliminaries. Mr. Stoll rose from his desk and said: “Good morning.   What can I do for you?”    “Do you want to buy Teletype?”    “Is it for sale?”    “Yes, at a price.”    “All right. Let’s get down to business.”    They got down to business on the spot, and they remained at it for   three solid days in Mr. Stoll’s office. The agreement as reached   called for A. T. & T. to pay off the preferred stock of Teletype,   13,979 shares callable at 105, and to give one share of A. T. & T. in   exchange for each common share of Teletype. The A. T. & T. shares were   worth about $200, so the price came to upwards of $30,000,000—plus, of   course, the $1,467,795 for retiring the Teletype preferred.  It should be noted here that this deal to take over Teletype on a share-for-share basis was exclusive of foreign patent rights but did include patent rights in Canada and Mexico.  The sale to Western Electric was closed on September 30, 1930. Mr. Stoll of that company was made president. Howard Krum continued on as vice president and was a leader in developing a number of commendable devices, including a system for transmitting messages in scrambled, untranslatable code form and receiving such scrambled code in perfect message form. Mr. Morton was retained as consultant. Edward Kleinschmidt made an arrangement to do development work for the new organization in a laboratory of his own, assigning all inventions to the Teletype Corporation (see page 50).  After Kleinschmidt left Teletype, his assistant, Albert H. Reiber, carried on as head of Research and Development for a short while before his untimely death. In the meantime, Walter J. Zenner had advanced and, in 1935, became Department Chief and later Vice President in Charge of Research and Development. Under Zenner’s direction a number of new devices in the teleprinter field were developed, including ultra-high-speed tape-perforating and tape-controlled transmitting devices, as well as a high-speed stock ticker operating at 900 characters per minute (introduced in 1964) to replace the earlier Morkrum-Kleinschmidt ticker which operated at 500 characters per minute. Some 94 patents were issued in his name, which have contributed greatly to the growth of the Teletype Corporation.[11]  On May 15, 1940, Howard Krum and Edward E. Kleinschmidt were both honored by The Franklin Institute and awarded the John Price Wetherill Medal, each one “For his Part in the Development of a Successful Electrically Operated Duplicate Typewriting Machine Now Known as the Teletypewriter,” (Quoted from the medal certificate.)      [Illustration: Teletype Corporation’s new Model 33 Automatic     Send-Receive Set                      _Picture through courtesy of Teletype Corporation_]  Howard Krum later also received an award as Modern Pioneer from the National Manufacturers Association. Edward E. Kleinschmidt, on April 19, 1958, was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn.  To continue: After the sale of patent rights in Canada, Mexico, and the United States to Western Electric, there remained the European and other foreign patent rights still with the original Morkrum and Kleinschmidt investors. The International Telephone and Telegraph Company wanted these rights, and, after negotiations in New York, a price was set for their purchase through the Creed Company in London, then owned by IT&T. Edward Kleinschmidt was sent to London in 1930 to close the deal. Some changes to the sales contract were requested by Creed which kept the cables busy by Kleinschmidt in asking for approval from A. T. & T. and Western Electric lawyers. Finally, upon all-around approval, the contract was signed at the previously-agreed-to price of one and a quarter million dollars.                                    CHAPTER 5                Teletypewriter Intercommunication Expands                                   _TELEX_  As a result of the acquisition of patents of the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Company by the Lorenz company, Siemens & Halske, and, later, the Creed company in England, all of which we have discussed briefly, teletypewriter intercommunicating expanded rapidly. In just a short time, through the cooperation of these companies, it spread over all of Europe and was named TELEX (_TEL_eprinter _EX_change Service).  Dr. Gerhard Grimsen of the Lorenz company, in a letter to Edward E. Kleinschmidt, dated July 11, 1962, states, in part (slightly edited):    The story of printing telegraph apparatus using an equal length code   in the Lorenz Co. commences in 1927 with the acquisition of the most   important patents of the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt Co.    Before then, the Lorenz people were busy in manufacturing Morse   apparatus and delivering exchange tickers which used the Hughes code.   The transmitter had a piano keyboard, the receiver was a page printer   with a moving type wheel.... The biggest network of this kind was   installed in the Berlin Police service (with one transmitter and about   300 receivers). The connections between the headquarters and the   substations were built by using guttapercha cable lines owned by the   police administration. This broadcasting network was erected around   1907. By 1927 the cables had aged, by normal corrosion, to such a   degree that instead of 110-volt double current transmitting voltage,   little by little, up to 220 volts was necessary for a fairly   satisfying operation. Also, the maintenance of the apparatus became   more costly.    This was the situation when some communication experts of the police   and the post administration made the first studies about the newest   telegraph technique in the U. S. A.... They found that the start-stop,   five-unit tape printer, the Model 14, developed and manufactured by   the Morkrum-Kleinschmidt company, would be the best instrument to   replace the old ones in the police service as well as in the telegraph   business of the German post administration.    Of special importance to the police service was the fact that by   introducing this apparatus, it was not necessary to build a new   network because now it became possible to rent normal telephone lines   using single current, 40-milliampere, 60-volt current only.  Siemens and Halske engineers, in 1925, had designed a teleprinter using the five-unit-code, start-stop principle. This was manufactured and improvements added, including the new start-stop method developed by Morkrum-Kleinschmidt. The Creed company, which had started manufacture of start-stop teleprinters before 1930, having purchased several Morkrum printers before the consolidation of that company with the Kleinschmidt company, also designed a teleprinter for the new five-unit-code, start-stop system.  In another write-up, Dr. Grimsen states that after the Siemens company came into the picture, a fully automatic teleprinter network was started in 1933 with a trial installation between Berlin and Hamburg for about forty private subscribers. The results were so encouraging that the German Reichspost continued the work, and five years later the TELEX system contained about 10,000 subscribers.  TELEX service was introduced in Great Britain in 1932 and was worked over the telephone network, using a single-tone voice frequency carrier signal which was keyed on and off by the teleprinter transmitter. (From Freebody’s _Telegraphy_.)[12]  Interconnection for TELEX service was made by dialing a subscriber as in telephone operation. TELEX directories then, as now, gave the call numbers of subscribers. Types of answerback devices were designed in both England and Germany which finally developed into an arrangement whereby the calling subscriber would, after dialing a number, press a special key, the shifted D key—named the “Who-Are-You?” button—which would cause the transmission of a signal code automatically to activate the called teletypewriter mechanism into transmitting its TELEX number.  Further apparatus, a device to punch the code in a tape and a punched-tape-controlled transmitter, was soon added.  The Siemens company also developed and built completely automatic switching equipment for the TELEX system which is used by many telegraph administrations.  Through the cooperation of the companies who were manufacturing teleprinters and associated equipment, the many problems that appeared were eventually solved to improve the apparatus and bring the TELEX system to eventual perfection for worldwide telegraph communications. (At the time of this writing, according to statistics, there are nearly 1,000,000 TELEX subscribers throughout the world.)  One of the problems faced in setting up such a worldwide system was that of standardizing the code and operating speed. At the time of Kleinschmidt’s stay in London in 1930 to close negotiations with Creed for the sale of Morkrum-Kleinschmidt’s foreign rights, he met Mr. Martin Feuerhahn of the German Telegraph Administration who at that time was in conference with Creed and representatives from the British Telegraph Administration as to standardizing on an alphabet and telegraph code for international communications. Mr. Feuerhahn argued for the adoption of the American Murray alphabet and code, stating that he already had the approval and consent of the French, Italian, and Belgian telegraph administrations.  Mr. Feuerhahn and Kleinschmidt spent some hours together. After their return to their respective countries, Kleinschmidt received a letter from Mr. Feuerhahn referring to their talks and stating that he had been in correspondence with Mr. Benjamin of Western Union and Mr. Parker of Bell Laboratories with regard to code and other pertinent matters of standardization so that an International Teleprinter Exchange could be extended into the United States. Another letter dated October 10, 1931, reviewed the aforementioned standardization search.  The Murray alphabet and 7½-"]]]
