Nathan Gripp frowned. He cared very little about his clerk, but he resented any want of respect to himself. He felt that the balance at his bankers was large enough to insure him a high degree of consideration from his work-people at least.  \"How many vests are there?\" he asked.  \"Half a dozen.\"  \"And the boy wants his pay, I suppose.\"  \"He hasn't asked for it, but he will. They always do.\"  \"Tell him we only pay when a full dozen are finished and brought in. We'll credit him, or his mother, with these.\"  \"That'll pay them off,\" thought the astute clothing merchant.  Samuel received this order with inward satisfaction, and went back smiling.  \"Well, young feller,\" said he, \"it's all right. The vests ain't over-well done, but we'll keep 'em. Now you can go.\"  But Dan did not move.  \"It seems to me you've forgotten something,\" he said.  \"What's that?\"  \"You haven't paid me for the work.\"  \"It's all right. We'll pay when the next half dozen are brought in. Will you take 'em now?\"  Dan was disagreeably surprised. This was entirely out of the usual course, and he knew very well that the delay would be a great inconvenience.  \"We've always been paid when we brought in work,\" he said.  \"We've changed our rule,\" said the clerk, nonchalantly. \"We only pay when a full dozen are brought in.\"  \"What difference does it make to you? We need the money, and can't wait.\"  \"It's my orders, young feller. It's what Mr. Gripp just told me.\"  \"Then I'll speak to him,\" said Dan, promptly.  \"Just as you like.\"  Dan approached the proprietor of the establishment.  \"Mr. Gripp,\" said he, \"I've just brought in half a dozen vests, but your clerk here won't pay me for them.\"  \"You will get your pay, young man, when you bring in another half dozen.\"  \"But, Mr. Gripp, we need the money. We haven't got a big bank account. Our rent is due to-morrow.\"  \"Is it, indeed? I don't see how that concerns me.\"  \"Will you pay me to-night as a favor?\" pleaded Dan, humbling himself for his mother's sake.  \"I can't break over my rule,\" said Nathan Gripp. \"Besides, Samuel says the work isn't very well done.\"  \"Then he lies!\" exclaimed Dan, provoked.  \"Do you hear that, Mr. Gripp?\" ejaculated the angry Samuel, his tallowy complexion putting on a faint flush. \"Didn't I tell you he was impudent?\"  Nathan Gripp's small black eyes snapped viciously.  \"Boy,\" said he, \"leave my store directly. How dare you address me in such a way, you young tramp?\"  \"I'm no more a tramp than yourself,\" retorted Dan, now thoroughly angry.  \"Samuel, come here, and put out this boy!\" exclaimed Nathan, too dignified to attempt the task himself.  Samuel advanced, nothing loth, his fishy eyes gleaming with pleasure.  \"Get out, you vagabond!\" he exclaimed, in the tone of authority.  \"You're a couple of swindlers!\" exclaimed Dan. \"You won't pay for honest work.\"  \"Out with him, Samuel!\" ordered Gripp.  Samuel seized Dan by the shoulder, and attempted to obey orders, but our hero doubled him up with a blow from his fist, and the luckless clerk, faint and gasping, staggered and nearly fell.  Dan stepped out on the sidewalk, and raising his hat, said, with mock politeness, \"Good-morning, gentlemen!\" and walked away, leaving Gripp and his assistant speechless with anger.  [Illustration: \"You're a couple of swindlers!\" exclaimed Dan. \"You won't pay for honest work.\" Page 30.]     CHAPTER IV.  AN ODD COUPLE.   When Dan's excitement was over, he felt that he had won a barren victory. He had certainly been badly treated, and was justified in yielding to his natural indignation; but for all that he had acted unwisely.  Nathan Gripp had not refused payment, he had only postponed it, and as he had the decided advantage, which money always has when pitted against labor, it would have been well to have been conciliatory. Now Gripp would undoubtedly annoy him with further delay, and refuse to give Mrs. Mordaunt any further work.  \"I suppose I've acted like a fool,\" said Dan to himself, with compunction. \"My spunk is always getting the better of me, and I am afraid poor mother will have to suffer. Well, there's no use crying for spilt milk; I must see what I can do to mend matters.\"  While these thoughts were passing through Dan's mind he found himself passing the clothing establishment of Jackson & Co., who were special rivals of Mr. Gripp.  \"Perhaps I can get some work for mother here,\" thought Dan. \"I'll try, at any rate.\"  He entered, and looking about him, attracted the attention of a clerk.  \"Do you want something in our line to-day?\" asked the clerk, pleasantly.  \"Yes, I do,\" said Dan, \"if you're giving things away; but as I've got a note of ten thousand dollars to meet to-morrow, I can't pay anything out.\"  \"Your credit ought to be good,\" said the salesman, smiling, \"but we don't trust.\"  \"All right,\" said Dan; \"I may as well proceed to business. My mother makes vests for amusement. Can you give her any work?\"  \"I will speak to Mr. Jackson. One of our hands is sick, and if your mother understands how to do the work, we may be able to give her some.\"  The young man went to the rear of the store, and returned with the proprietor.  \"Has your mother any experience?\" asked the proprietor, a big man, with sandy whiskers.  He was an Englishman, as any one might see, and a decided improvement on Nathan Gripp, whom he cordially hated.  \"Yes, sir; she has been making vests for the last two years.\"  \"For whom has she been working?\"  \"For Nathan Gripp.\"  \"Humph! Has Gripp discharged her?\"  \"No, sir; she has discharged him.\"  Mr. Jackson laughed, and nodded to his salesman. He rather enjoyed this allusion to his rival.  \"Then she didn't like Gripp?\"  \"No, sir. He paid her starvation wages and made her wait for the money. He's a mean fellow.\"  \"I don't admire him much myself,\" said the Englishman. \"How much now did he pay for vest-making?\"  \"Twenty cents apiece.\"  \"We don't pay much more ourselves. There is so much competition that we have to sell low.\"  \"Mother would rather make for you at eighteen cents than for Gripp for twenty,\" said Dan.  Mr. Jackson was pleased, but he said, by way of drawing out Dan:  \"How do you know but I am a mean skinflint, too?\"  \"You don't look like one,\" said the boy.  Mr. Jackson smiled graciously.  \"Joseph,\" said he, \"have we any vests ready for making?\"  \"Yes, sir. We have some bundles of half a dozen each.\"  \"Take this boy's name and address and give him one. My boy, we will pay your mother twenty-five cents each, but we expect good work.\"  \"You will be satisfied, sir,\" said Dan, confidently, and he left the store in excellent spirits.  \"It's turned out right, after all,\" thought he; \"but I am afraid we shall miss the money old Gripp owed mother. I don't know how we are going to pay the rent to-morrow. We shall be over two dollars short unless something turns up.\"  Dan carried the bundle of work home, and told his mother what had happened. She was pleased with the increase of pay, but that was in the future. It would be a week before she could collect any pay from Jackson & Co., and the landlord would not wait.  \"I wish I could think of some way of raising money,\" said Dan, putting his face between his hands and looking thoughtful. \"If you only had some jewels, mother, that we could raise money on now, we would be all right.\"  \"I have nothing but my wedding-ring,\" said Mrs. Mordaunt, sadly.  \"You must keep that, mother. Don't part with that unless you are obliged to.\"  \"I would rather not, Dan, but if there is no other way----\"  \"There must be another way. I will find another way. Just don't think of it any more, mother. When does the landlord come?\"  \"Generally between twelve and one.\"  \"Then we shall have all the forenoon to forage round in. It's only two dollars and a half we want. I ought to be able to raise two dollars and a half.\"  \"That is a great deal of money to us now, Dan.\"  \"I wonder whether Shorty wouldn't lend it to me?\" said Dan, reflectively.  \"Who is Shorty, my son?\"  \"He is a little hump-backed dwarf that keeps a cigar stand down on Broadway, not far from Trinity Church. He has a good trade, and doesn't waste his money. Yes, I will ask Shorty.\"  \"I hope he will be willing to grant your request, Dan.\"  \"I hope so, too. He's a good-natured fellow, Shorty is, and he'll do it, if he can. I'll see him the first thing to-morrow morning.\"  Somewhat cheered by Dan's confident tone, Mrs. Mordaunt went to sleep as early as usual, forgetting the trouble possibly in store.  The next morning, before selling his papers, Dan went round to Shorty's stand.  \"Good-morning, Dan,\" said the dwarf, in a singularly melodious voice.  \"Good-morning, Shorty. I thought I'd find you here.\"  \"Yes, I begin business early.\"  \"I am going to ask a favor of you,\" said Dan, abruptly.  \"What is it, Dan?\"  \"Our rent's due to-day, and we are two dollars and a half short. I can make the fifty cents before noon. Can you lend me two dollars till I am able to pay it?\"  To Dan's dismay Shorty shook his head.  \"I wish I could, Dan, but there's something in the way.\"  \"If you're afraid I won't pay you back, you needn't think of that. I never went back on a fellow that lent me money yet.\"  \"I am not afraid of trusting you, Dan, but I haven't got the money.\"  \"I understand,\" said Dan, coldly, for he suspected this to be a subterfuge.  \"No, you don't understand,\" said Shorty, eagerly. \"You think what I say is a sham, but you wouldn't if you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53345"],["title","Dan, the Newsboy (#3)"],["body","all.\"  \"If I knew all,\" repeated Dan, surprised.  \"Yes, I shall have to tell you. I didn't mean to, but I don't want you to misunderstand me. The fact is, Dan,\" Shorty added, sheepishly, \"I've got more than myself to provide for now.\"  \"What? You don't mean to say?\" ejaculated Dan.  \"I was married yesterday, Dan,\" said the cigar dealer, almost apologetically, \"and I've been buying furniture, and the fact is, I haven't got a cent to spare.\"  \"Of course you haven't,\" said Dan. \"I never dreamed of this. Is your wife--about your size?\"  \"No, Dan, she's rather tall. There she is, crossing the street. Do you see her?\"  Dan looked, and saw a tall woman, of twenty-five or thereabouts, approaching the cigar stand. She was very plain, with a large mouth and a long, aquiline nose.  \"That's my wife,\" said the cigar dealer, regarding his tall partner with evident pride. \"Julia, my dear, this is my friend, Dan Mordaunt.\"  \"Glad to see any friend of my husband,\" said the lady, in a deep, hoarse voice, which might have been mistaken for a man's. \"He must come and see us.\"  \"So I will, thank you,\" answered Dan, surveying the female grenadier with a wondering glance.  \"We live at No. -- Varick street, Dan, and I shall be very glad to see you any evening.\"  \"By gracious!\" said Dan to himself, \"that's the queerest match I ever heard of. She might take Shorty up in her arms and carry him off. I don't think he'll beat her very often,\" and Dan smiled at the thought.  The morning wore away, and at eleven o'clock Dan had earned forty cents. He began to get discouraged. There didn't seem to be much prospect of raising the rent before twelve o'clock.     CHAPTER V.  EFFECTING A LOAN.   As Dan stood on the sidewalk with his bundle of papers, and only forty cents toward the two dollars and a half required for the rent, he felt like many a business man who has a note to meet and not enough money on hand to pay it. Indeed, he was worse off, for generally business men have friends who can help them with a temporary loan, but Dan's friends were quite as poor as himself. One, however, Dick Stanton, a mere boy, had the reputation of being more saving than his companions. It was known that he had an account in the Bowery Savings Bank, and among the street boys he was considered wealthy.  \"Perhaps I can borrow two dollars of him,\" thought Dan, as Dick passed him on his way to Canal street.  \"I say, Dick,\" said Dan, \"stop a minute. I want to speak to you.\"  \"Go ahead, Dan.\"  \"I want you to lend me two dollars. Our rent is due, and I can raise it all but that.\"  Dick shook his head, and was about to speak, when Dan said hurriedly, for he felt that it was his last chance:  \"You needn't be afraid of me, Dick; I'll pay you sure, and give you more interest, too, than you get in the bank.\"  \"I haven't got any money in the bank, Dan.\"  \"You had last week,\" said Dan, suspiciously.  \"So I had, but I haven't now.\"  \"You don't want to lend--that's what's the matter.\"  \"You are mistaken, Dan. I'm not a bit afraid of lending to you, but I have lent my money already.\"  \"Who to?\" asked Dan, ungrammatically, falling into a mistake made by plenty of greater age and better experience than himself. \"Of course it isn't any of my business,\" he added, \"if you don't want to tell.\"  \"I don't mind telling you, Dan. I've lent it to my aunt. She's got two children, and a hard time to get along. Perhaps I shall never see it again, but I couldn't refuse her.\"  \"Of course you couldn't,\" said Dan, heartily. \"You've done right, and you won't be sorry for it. I wish I knew some way of making two dollars before twelve o'clock.\"  \"Are you in urgent need of two dollars, my boy?\" asked a pleasant voice.  Dan turned, and met the face of the stranger introduced in the first chapter.  \"Yes, sir,\" he answered. \"I want it the worst way.\"  \"Have you been extravagant and run up bills, Dan?\"  \"No, sir; the only bill we have is the rent, and that comes due this noon.\"  \"How much is it?\"  \"Six dollars, sir.\"  \"I thought you said you wanted to borrow _two_ dollars.\"  \"I've got four dollars toward it, sir.\"  \"Do you often fall behind when rent day comes, Dan?\"  \"No, sir; this is the first time in two years.\"  \"How do you account for it? Has business been duller than usual during the last month?\"  \"Yes, sir, I think it has. There hasn't been as much news in the papers, and my sales have fallen off. There's another thing, too.\"  \"What is that?\"  \"Mother has a dollar and twenty cents due her, and she can't collect it.\"  \"Is it for making vests?\"  \"Yes, sir. Mr. Gripp won't pay till she has made a full dozen.\"  \"That seems inconsiderate.\"  \"Oh, he's a mean fellow.\"  \"I've a great mind to buy the debt of you.\"  \"I wish you would, sir,\" said Dan, eagerly. \"That would leave only sixty cents short, for I shall make ten cents more before twelve o'clock, it's likely.\"  \"It is only half-past eleven. To put you quite at ease, I mean to lend you five dollars, and help you collect your mother's bill.\"  \"You are very kind, sir,\" said Dan, surprised and grateful; \"but I don't need so much.\"  \"You may get short again when I am not here to assist you.\"  \"Are you not afraid I shall never pay you, sir?\"  \"That thought won't keep me awake nights,\" said the gentleman, laughing.  \"You sha'n't lose anything by me, sir; I promise you that,\" said Dan, earnestly.  \"Then come into the hotel with me, and we will arrange the matter in a business-like way.\"  \"All right, sir.\"  Dan followed his new friend into the Astor House, and up stairs into a pleasant bedroom, which in its comfortable apartments reminded Dan of the days before his father's failure.  \"I wish I could live so again,\" he thought. \"I don't like a tenement-house.\"  Mr. Grant--for this was his name--took writing materials from his valise, and seated himself at a table.  \"I am going to draw up a note for you to sign,\" he said. \"I probably understand better than you the necessary form.\"  \"Thank you, sir.\"  His pen ran rapidly over the paper, and in a minute or two he handed Dan the following form of acknowledgment:        \"NEW YORK, Sept. 15, 18--.       \"For value received I promise to pay to Alexander Grant five      dollars on demand with interest.\"   \"Now,\" said Mr. Grant, \"put your name at the bottom.\"  Dan did so.  \"I added 'with interest,' but only as a form; I shall require none.\"  \"I would rather pay it, sir.\"  \"That may be as you please. How much will six per cent. interest make it amount to in a year?\"  \"Five dollars and thirty cents,\" answered Dan, promptly.  \"Good! I see you have not forgotten what you learned in school.\"  \"I have ciphered through cube root,\" said Dan, with some pride. \"I am not sure whether I remember that now, but I could do any sum in square root.\"  \"It is a pity you could not have remained in school.\"  \"I should like to; but it's no use crying for spilt milk.\"  \"As long as you didn't spill it yourself,\" added Mr. Grant.  \"No, sir; it was not my fault that I had to leave school.\"  Mr. Grant folded up the note and carefully deposited it in his wallet.  \"The next thing is to hand you the money,\" he said. \"Shall I give you a five-dollar bill, or small bills?\"  \"Small bills, sir, if it is just as convenient.\"  Mr. Grant placed in Dan's hands two two-dollar bills and a one.  \"One thing more,\" he said. \"Give me an order on Mr. Gripp for the money due your mother. It is as well to have it in your own handwriting. I won't tell you how to write it. See if you can find a way.\"  Dan wrote an order, which Mr. Grant pronounced satisfactory.  \"On the whole,\" said he, \"I believe I will take you with me when I call upon Mr. Gripp. Can you call here at three o'clock this afternoon?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"That is settled, then. We will see whether Mr. Gripp will be any more polite to me than he was to you.\"  \"He will be surprised to see me in your company,\" said Dan, laughing.  \"It is a good thing to surprise the enemy, Dan. A surprise often leads to victory. When does your landlord call for his rent?\"  \"Between twelve and one.\"  \"Then I won't detain you longer. Remember your appointment at three.\"  \"I won't forget it, sir.\"  \"Well, I'm in luck!\" said Dan to himself, as he emerged into the street. \"Who would have thought that a stranger would lend me so large a sum? He's a trump, and no mistake. Now, if I could only sell the four papers I have left before twelve o'clock. I don't want to get stuck on them.\"  Fortune was not tired of favoring Dan. In ten minutes he had sold his papers, and turned his steps toward the humble home where his mother was awaiting, not without anxiety, the visit of an unamiable landlord.     CHAPTER VI.  MORE THAN A MATCH.   Mrs. Mordaunt looked up anxiously as Dan entered the room. She had little expectation that he had been able in one morning to make up the large deficiency in the sum reserved for the rent, but there was a possibility, and she clung to that. Dan thought of postponing the relation of his good news, but when he saw his mother's anxious face, he felt that it would be cruel.  So when she said, \"Well, Dan?\" he nodded his head cheerfully.  \"I've got it, mother,\" he said.  \"Thank God for all His goodness!\" ejaculated Mrs. Mordaunt, fervently.  \"You see He hasn't forgotten us,\" said Dan, gleefully.  \"No, my boy, it is a rebuke to my momentary want of faith. How could you raise so large a sum? Surely you did not earn it in one forenoon?\"  \"You're right there, mother. I'm not smart enough to earn two dollars before twelve o'clock.\"  \"But you've got the money, Dan?\"  \"Look at this, mother,\" and Dan displayed the bills.  \"Where did you get them, Dan?\" asked his mother, astonished.  \"I borrowed them.\"  \"I didn't know we had a friend left, able or willing to lend us that sum.\"  \"I borrowed them of Alexander Grant, of St. Louis, and gave my note for them,\" answered Dan, in a tone of some importance.  \"Alexander Grant, of St. Louis! I don't remember that name.\"  \"He's a new friend of mine, mother. I haven't known him over"]]]
