Her tumbling, curly hair, which was everlastingly escaping from its ribbon, had gained for her the title of Mops or Mopsy. Midge and Midget had clung to her from babyhood, because she was an active and energetic child, and so quick of motion that she seemed to dart like a midge from place to place. She never did anything slowly. Whether it was an errand for her mother or a game of play, Midge always moved rapidly. Her tasks were always done in half the time it took the other children to do theirs; but in consequence of this haste, they were not always done as well or as thoroughly as could be desired.  This, her mother often told her, was her besetting sin, and Marjorie truly tried to correct it when she thought of it; but often she was too busy with the occupation in hand to remember the good instructions she had received.  \"I'm glad you did that, Mother,\" she replied to her mother's remark, \"for I really haven't time to study the list now. But I'll promise to read it over every morning at Grandma's, and honest and true, I'll try to be good.\"  \"Of course you will,\" said her father, heartily; \"you'll be the best little girl in the world, except the two you leave here behind you.\"  \"Me's the bestest,\" calmly remarked Rosamond, who seemed especially satisfied with herself that evening.  \"You are,\" agreed King; \"you look good enough to eat, to-night.\"  Rosamond beamed happily, for she was not unused to flattering observations from the family. And, indeed, she was a delicious-looking morsel of humanity, as she sat in her high chair, and tried her best to \"behave like a lady.\"  The table was decorated with June roses and daisies. The dinner included Marjorie's favorite dishes, and the dessert was strawberries and ice cream, which, Kitty declared, always made a party, anyway.  So with the general air of celebration, and Mr. Maynard's gay chatter and jokes, the little trace of sadness that threatened to appear was kept out of sight, and all through the summer Marjorie had only pleasant memories of her last evening at home.  After the dessert the waitress appeared again with a trayful of parcels, done up in the most fascinating way, in tissue paper and dainty ribbons.  This, too, was always a part of the farewell feast, and Marjorie gave a little sigh of satisfaction, as the well-filled tray was placed before her.  \"That's mine! Open mine first!\" cried Rosamond, as Marjorie picked up a good-sized bundle.  \"Yes, that's Rosy Posy's,\" said her mother, laughing, \"and she picked it out herself, because she thought it would please you. Open it first, Midge.\"  So Marjorie opened the package, and discovered a little clock, on the top of which was perched a brilliant red bird.  Rosamond clapped her hands in glee. \"I knew you'd love it,\" she cried, \"'cause it's a birdie, a yed birdie. And I finded it all mysef in the man's shop. Do you yike it, Mopsy?\"  \"Indeed I do,\" cried Marjorie; \"it's just what I wanted. I shall keep it on my dressing-table at Grandma's, and then I'll know just when to get up every morning.\"  \"Open mine next,\" said Kitty; \"it's the square flat one, with the blue ribbon.\"  So Marjorie opened Kitty's present and it was a picture, beautifully framed to hang on the wall at Grandma's. The picture was of birds, two beautiful orioles on a branch. The colors were so bright, and so true to nature, that Marjorie exclaimed in delight:  \"Now I shall have orioles there, anyway, whether there are real ones in the trees or not. It is lovely, Kitsie, and I don't see how you ever found such a beautiful bird picture.\"  Marjorie had always been fond of birds, and lately had begun studying them in earnest. Orioles were among her favorites, and so Kitty's picture was a truly welcome gift. King's present came next, and was a beautiful gold pen with a pearl holder.  \"That,\" he explained, \"is so you'll write to us often. For I know, Mops, your old penholder is broken, and it's silver, anyway. This is nicer, because it's no trouble to keep it clean and bright.\"  \"That's so, King, and I'm delighted with this one. I shall write you a letter with it, first of all, and I'll tell you all about the farm.\"  Mrs. Maynard's gift was in a very small parcel, and when Marjorie opened it she found a dear little pearl ring.  \"Oh, goody!\" she cried. \"I do love rings, and I never had one before! May I wear it always, Mother?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Maynard, smiling. \"I don't approve of much jewelry for a little girl not yet twelve years old, but you may wear that.\"  Marjorie put it on her finger with great satisfaction, and Kitty looked at it lovingly.  \"May I have one when I am twelve, Mother?\" she asked.  \"May I, may I?\" chimed in Rosy Posy.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Maynard; \"you girls may each have one just like Marjorie's when you are as old as she is now. That last parcel, Mops, is my present for you. I'm not sure that you can learn to use it, but perhaps you can, and if not I'll take it back and exchange it for something else.\"  Marjorie eagerly untied the wrappings of her father's gift, and found a little snapshot camera.  \"Indeed I can learn to use it,\" she cried; \"I took some pictures once with a camera that belonged to one of the girls at school, and they were all right. Thank you heaps and heaps, father dear; I'll send you pictures of everything on the place; from Grandma herself down to the littlest, weeniest, yellow chicken.\"  \"Next year it will be my turn to go,\" said Kitty; \"I hope I'll get as lovely presents as Mopsy has.\"  \"You will,\" said Kingdon; \"because last year mine were just as good, and so, of course, yours will be.\"  \"I'm sure they will,\" said Kitty.     CHAPTER II  THE TRIP TO HASLEMERE   The next morning all was bustle and excitement.  Mr. Maynard stayed at home from business to escort the travellers to the train. The trunks were packed, and everything was in readiness for their departure. Marjorie herself, in a spick-and-span pink gingham dress, a tan-colored travelling cloak, and a broad-brimmed white straw hat, stood in the hall saying good-bye to the other children. She carried Puff in her arm, and the sleepy, indifferent kitten cared little whither she was going.  \"Be sure,\" Kingdon was saying, \"to plant the seeds I gave you in a sunny place, for if you don't they won't grow right.\"  \"What are the seeds?\" asked Marjorie.  \"Never mind that,\" said her brother; \"you just plant them in a warm, sunny bed, in good, rich soil, and then you wait and see what comes up. It's a surprise.\"  \"All right, I'll do that, and I suppose Grandma will give me a lot of seeds besides; we always have gardens, you know.\"  \"Be sure to write to me,\" said Kitty, \"about Molly Moss. She's the one that lives in the next house but one to Grandma's. You've never seen her, but I saw her two years ago, and she's an awfully nice girl. You'll like her, I know.\"  \"And what shall I remember to do for you, Rosy Posy?\" asked Marjorie, as she kissed the baby good-bye.  \"Don't know,\" responded the little one; \"I've never been to Gamma's. Is they piggy-wigs there?\"  \"No,\" said Marjorie, laughing; \"no piggy-wigs, but some nice ducks.\"  \"All wite; b'ing me a duck.\"  \"I will, if Grandma will give me one\"; and then Marjorie was hurried down the steps by her father, and into the carriage, and away she went, with many a backward look at the three children who stood on the veranda waving good-byes to her.  The railroad trip to Morristown lasted about four hours, and Marjorie greatly enjoyed it. Mr. Maynard had put the two travellers into their chairs in the parlor car, and arranged their belongings for them. Marjorie had brought a book to read and a game to play, but with the novel attractions of the trip and the care of her kitten, she was not likely to have time hang heavily on her hands.  Mrs. Maynard read a magazine for a time, and then they were summoned to luncheon in the diningcar. Marjorie thought this great fun, for what is nicer than to be a hungry little girl of twelve, and to eat all sorts of good things, while flying swiftly along in a railroad train, and gazing out of the window at towns and cities rushing by?  Marjorie sat opposite her mother, and observed with great interest the other passengers about. Across the car was a little girl who seemed to be about her own age, and Marjorie greatly wished that they might become acquainted. Mrs. Maynard said that after luncheon she might go and speak to the little stranger if she chose, and Marjorie gladly did so.  \"I wonder if you belong in my car,\" said Marjorie, by way of opening the conversation.  \"I don't know,\" said the other child; \"our seats are in the car just back of this.\"  \"We are two cars back,\" said Marjorie, \"but perhaps your mother will let you come into my car a while. I have my kitten with me.\"  \"Where is it?\" asked the other little girl.  \"I had to leave it with the porter while we came to luncheon. Oh, she's the loveliest kitten you ever saw, and her name is Puff. What's your name?\"  \"My name is Stella Martin. What's yours?\"  \"My real name is Marjorie Maynard. But I'm almost always called Midge or Mops or some name like that. We all have nicknames at home; don't you?\"  \"No, because you see I haven't any brothers or sisters. Mother always calls me Stella.\"  \"Well, let's go and ask her if you can't come into my car for a while. My mother will look after you, and then you can see the kitten.\"  After some courteous words of explanation between the two mothers, Stella was allowed to play with Marjorie for the rest of the journey.  Seated together in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5271"],["title","Marjorie's Vacation (#2)"],["body","of the big Pullman easy chairs, with the kitten cuddled between them, they rapidly made each other's acquaintance, and soon became good friends. They were not at all alike, for Stella Martin was a thin, pale child with a long braid of straight, light hair, and light blue eyes. She was timid, too, and absolutely devoid of Marjorie's impetuosity and daring. But they were both pleased at the discovery that they were to be near neighbors throughout the summer. Stella's home was next-door to Grandma Sherwood's, although, as both country places were so large, the houses were some distance apart.  Next beyond Stella's house, Marjorie remembered, was where Molly Moss lived, and so the outlook seemed to promise plenty of pleasant company.  About three o'clock in the afternoon the train reached Morristown, and springing out on the platform, Marjorie soon spied Grandma Sherwood's carriage there to meet them. Old Moses was still in charge of the horses, as he had been ever since Marjorie could remember, and in a moment she heard a hearty voice cry, \"Oh, there you are!\" and there was Uncle Steve waiting for them on the platform.  Uncle Steve was a great friend of Marjorie's, and she flew to greet him almost before he had time to welcome her mother. Then in a few moments the luggage was looked after, and they were all in the carriage, rolling away toward Haslemere.  Marjorie chatted away like a magpie, for she had many questions to ask Uncle Steve, and as she was looking out to renew acquaintance with old landmarks along the road, the drive to the house seemed very short, and soon they were turning in at the gate.  Haslemere was not a large, old-fashioned farm, but a fair-sized and well-kept country place. Grandma Sherwood, who had been a widow for many years, lived there with her son Stephen. It was like a farm, because there were chickens and ducks, and cows and horses, and also a large garden where fresh vegetables of all sorts were raised. But there were no grain fields or large pasture lands, or pigs or turkeys, such as belong to larger farms. The drive from the gate up to the house was a long avenue, shaded on both sides by beautiful old trees, and the wide expanse of lawn was kept as carefully mowed as if at a town house. There were flower beds in abundance, and among the trees and shrubbery were rustic seats and arbors, hammocks and swings, and a delightful tent where the children loved to play. Back of the house the land sloped down to the river, which was quite large enough for delightful boating and fishing.  The house was of that old-fashioned type which has two front doors and two halls, with large parlors between them, and wings on either side. A broad veranda ran across the front, and, turning both corners, ran along either side.  As they drove up to the house, Grandma Sherwood was on the piazza waiting for them. She was not a very old lady, that is, she was not of the white-haired, white-capped, and silver-spectacled variety. She was perhaps sixty years old, and seemed quite as energetic and enthusiastic as her daughter, if perhaps not quite so much so as her granddaughter.  Marjorie sprang out of the carriage, and flew like a young whirlwind to her grandmother's arms, which were open to receive her.  \"My dear child, how you have grown!\"  \"I knew you'd say that, Grandma,\" said Marjorie, laughing merrily, \"and, indeed, I have grown since I was here last. Just think, that was three years ago! I'm almost twelve years old now.\"  \"Well, you are a great girl; run in the house, and lay off your things, while I speak to your mother.\"  Marjorie danced into the house, flung her coat and gloves on the hall rack, and still holding her kitten, went on through to the kitchen, in search of Eliza the cook.  \"The saints presarve us!\" cried Eliza. \"An' is it yersilf, Miss Midget! Why, ye're as big as a tellygraft pole, so ye are!\"  \"I know I am, Eliza, but you're just the same as ever; and just look at the kitten I have brought! Have you any here now?\"  \"Cats, is it? Indade we have, then! I'm thinkin' there do be a hundred dozen of thim; they're undher me feet continual! But what kind of a baste is thot ye have there? I niver saw such a woolly one!\"  \"This is a Persian kitten, Eliza, and her name is Puff. Isn't she pretty?\"  \"I'll not be sayin' she's purty, till I see how she doos be behavin'. Is she a good little cat, Miss Midget dear?\"  \"Good! Indeed she is a good kitty. And I wish you'd give her some milk, Eliza, while I run out to see the chickens. Is Carter out there?\"  But without waiting for an answer, Marjorie was already flying down through the garden, and soon found Carter, the gardener, at his work.  \"Hello, Carter!\" she cried. \"How are you this summer?\"  \"Welcome, Miss Midge! I'm glad to see you back,\" exclaimed the old gardener, who was very fond of the Maynard children.  \"And I'm glad to be here, Carter; and I have some seeds to plant; will you help me plant them?\"  \"That I will. What are they?\"  \"I don't know; King gave them to me, but he wouldn't tell me what they were.\"  \"Ah, the mischievous boy! Now, how can we tell where to plant them when we don't know if they'll come up lilies of the valley or elephant's ears?\"  Marjorie laughed gayly. \"It doesn't matter, Carter,\" she said; \"let's stick them in some sunny place, and then, if they seem to be growing too high, we can transplant them.\"  \"It's a wise little head you have, Miss; we'll do just that.\"  Humoring Marjorie's impatience, the good-natured gardener helped her plant the seeds in a sunny flowerbed, and raked the dirt neatly over them with an experienced touch.  \"That looks lovely,\" said Marjorie, with a satisfied nod of approval; \"now let's go and see the chickens.\"  This proved even more interesting than she had anticipated, for since her last visit an incubator had been purchased, and there were hundreds of little chickens of various sizes, in different compartments, to be looked at and admired.  \"Aren't they darlings!\" exclaimed Marjorie, as she watched the little yellow balls trying to balance themselves on slender little brown stems that hardly seemed as if they could be meant for legs. \"Oh, Carter, I shall spend hours out here every day!\"  \"Do, Miss Midge; I'll be glad to have you, and the chickens won't mind it a bit.\"  \"Now the horses,\" Marjorie went on, and off they went to the stables, where Moses had already unharnessed the carriage team, and put them in their stalls. Uncle Steve had a new saddle horse, which came in for a large share of admiration, and the old horse, Betsy, which Grandma Sherwood liked to drive herself, was also to be greeted.  Marjorie loved all animals, but after cats, horses were her favorites.  \"Are there any ducks this year, Carter?\" she inquired.  \"Yes, Miss Midge, there is a duck-pond full of them; and you haven't seen the new boathouse that was built last year for Master Kingdon.\"  \"No, but I want to see it; and oh, Carter, don't you think you could teach me to row?\"  \"I'm sure of it, Miss Midge; but I hear your grandmother calling you, and I think you'd better leave the boathouse to see to-morrow.\"  \"All right; I think so too, Carter.\" And Marjorie ran back to the house, her broad-brimmed hat in one hand and her hair ribbon in the other, while her curls were, indeed, in a tangled mop.     CHAPTER III  ON THE ROOF   \"Why, Mopsy Maynard,\" exclaimed her mother, as Marjorie danced into the house, smiling and dishevelled, \"what a looking head! Please go straight to your room, and make yourself tidy before supper time.\"  \"Yes, indeed, Mother, but just listen a minute! Uncle Steve has a new horse, a black one, and there are a hundred million little chickens, in the queerest kind of a thing, but I can't remember its name,--it's something like elevator.\"  \"Incubator, perhaps,\" suggested her mother.  \"Yes, that's it; and oh, Mother, it's so funny! Do come out and see it, won't you?\"  \"Not to-night, child; and now run up to your room and tie up your hair.\"  Marjorie danced upstairs, singing as she went, but when she reached the door of the room she was accustomed to use, she stopped her singing and stood in the doorway, stock-still with sheer bewilderment.  For somehow the room had been entirely transformed, and looked like a totally different apartment.  The room was in one of the wings of the house, and was large and square, with windows on two sides. But these had been ordinary windows, and now they were replaced by large, roomy bay windows, with glass doors that reached from floor to ceiling, and opened out on little balconies. In one of these bay windows was a dear little rocking-chair painted white, and a standard work-basket of dainty white and green wicker, completely furnished with sewing materials. In the other bay window was a dear little writing-desk of bird's-eye maple, and a wicker chair in front of it. The desk was open, and Marjorie could see all sorts of pens and pencils and paper in fascinating array.  But these were only a few of the surprises. The whole room had been redecorated, and the walls were papered with a design of yellow daffodils in little bunches tied with pale green ribbon. The woodwork was all painted white, and entirely around the room, at just about the height of Marjorie's chin, ran a broad white shelf. Of course this shelf stopped for the windows and doors, but the room was large, and there was a great deal of space left for the shelf. But it was the things on the shelf that attracted Marjorie's attention. One side of the room was devoted to books, and Marjorie quickly recognized many of her old favorites, and many new ones. On another side of the room the shelf was filled with flowers, some blooming gayly in pots, and some cut blossoms in vases of water. On a third side of the room the shelf held birds, and this sight nearly took Marjorie's breath away. Some were in gilt cages, a canary, a goldfinch, and another bird whose name Marjorie did not know. And some were stuffed birds of"]]]
