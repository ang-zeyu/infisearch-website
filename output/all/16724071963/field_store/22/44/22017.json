DEDICATION              TO THE SEVENTIES:             THAT BODY OF MEN           UPON WHOM--UNDER THE      DIRECTION OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES--   DEVOLVES THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PREACHING     THE GOSPEL, AND DEFENDING THE TRUTH         IN ALL THE WORLD, THIS WORK            IS AFFECTIONATELY                  DEDICATED.    A WORD WITH STUDENTS AND TEACHERS.  Before you take up the study of OUTLINES OF ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY, I beg leave to call your attention to the structure of the work, and the purpose for which it was written. First, then, as to its structure.  The work is divided into four parts, each with a distinct idea running through it. Part I deals with THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CHURCH through the ministry of Messiah and his apostles; Part II with THE APOSTASY, brought about through the severe persecution to which the early saints were subjected, the rise of false teachers, changing the ordinances of the gospel, intermingling pagan philosophy with Christian doctrine, and a transgression of the laws of God; Part III deals with \"THE REFORMATION,\" treating it, however as a revolution instead of a reformation since the so-called reformation by no means re-established primitive Christianity, either in its form or essence, but it did overthrow the power of the Catholic Church in the greater part of Western Europe, gave larger liberty to the people, and thus prepared the way for the great work which followed it--the introduction of the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times; Part IV treats of THE RESTORATION OF THE GOSPEL, in the aforesaid dispensation, through the revelations which God gave to the Prophet Joseph Smith.  The parts above enumerated are separated into sections, these subdivisions being determined by the several subjects into which the main idea of the respective parts naturally divides. The sections are again separated into topics, the {iv} titles of which are printed in bold-face type, and the paragraphs are numbered. These divisions, it is believed, will better enable the student to discern the relation of the respective parts to the main subject, and at the same time afford a convenient division for the assignment of lessons to classes. Ordinarily it will be found that a section will be sufficient for a lesson for either a class or quorum; but in some instances two of the shorter sections may be taken for a lesson; but some of the longer sections should be divided into two or more.  At the end of each section will be found a collection of notes bearing upon the important points treated in the text of the work, at which place reference will be found to the note at the end of the section. The author cannot, in his opinion, too emphatically urge upon the student the importance of turning to the notes to which he is directed in the text and reading them. They will be found to throw additional light upon the subject treated in the text, either by giving the statement of a recognized authority, supplying pointed argument--with which it has been thought best not to burden the body of the work--or giving illustrations to the statement made in the text. Another purpose for placing these notes at the end of the sections has been to arouse an interest in the works of the authors quoted; that the students of this text book may be induced to delve deeper into the study of Ecclesiastical History than a perusal of these pages will enable them to do. And here let the author confess, while he believes he is presenting a very valuable collection of facts to those who will take up the study of his work--yet if the study of these pages shall result in merely awakening in the minds of the elders and the youth of Israel an interest in the subject, he will account the objects of his efforts successfully attained.  At the end of each section also will be found Review Questions, covering the main points treated in the text and in the notes. It is hoped that they will be found useful in conducting {v} class exercises, and to the private student who wishes to ascertain if he has mastered the subject matter of each section. Let him put to himself the questions found in the review at the end of the section, when completing it, and if he can give a satisfactory answer to each one, the author feels assured that the student has mastered the salient points.  The purpose of the work is two-fold: First, it is to sustain the position taken by the church of Christ in the last days. What that position is may be readily discerned by the very first revelation the Lord gave to Joseph Smith. In answering the young prophet's question--which of all the sects of religion was acknowledged of him as his church and kingdom--the Lord said they were all wrong; that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that they drew near to him with their lips, but their hearts were far from him; that they taught for doctrine the commandments of men--having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof.[1]  It has been to bring together the historical evidences of the truth of this divine announcement that, in part, this work has been written; and therefore prominence has been given to those facts of history which support that announcement. But no fact has been suppressed that has a tendency to support the opposite view. No such fact either of history or prophecy exists. The whole stream of evidence proves that there has been a universal apostasy from the religion taught by Jesus Christ and his apostles; and the existing differences between the present teachings of \"Christendom\" and the doctrines of the scriptures is a proof so palpable that it admits of no contradiction. As this position of the church is one which the seventies and elders will have to maintain against all the world, it is of first importance that they become familiar with those facts of history and of prophecy that will enable them to maintain that position intelligently and successfully.  The second purpose of the work is to teach the principles of the gospel. This, the author is convinced, can best be done in connection with their history. Relate the historical events which resulted in the introduction and establishment of the gospel and the church of Christ; then in all the centuries from the second to the tenth show how the doctrines of Messiah were departed from, how the ordinances were changed and the laws of God transgressed; relate the principal events of the sixteenth century revolution--miscalled the \"Reformation\"--and point out how that revolution, however salutary in bringing to pass an enlargement of popular liberty, failed to re-establish the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, or re-organize the church as at first founded by Messiah; then relate the events connected with the restoration of the gospel through the revelations given to the great prophet of the Dispensation of the Fullness of Times, Joseph Smith--and in so doing you are not only teaching the interesting facts of Ecclesiastical History to your students, but at the same time you are making them acquainted with the principles of the gospel. Under such a presentation the students, without being conscious of it, perhaps, will examine those principles under a variety of circumstances. They will see them stated in connection with the leading events of the Messiah's life; they will see them corrupted by an apostate church; they will hear them discussed by men during the attempt at Reformation; and after witnessing the unavailing efforts of the \"Reformers\" to re-establish the gospel and the church of Christ, they will see how the heavens were opened and every principle, doctrine, ordinance, law, officer and institution known to the church of Christ, restored. Such a presentation of the principles of the gospel, we repeat, must lead to a very comprehensive understanding of them, and such is one of the purposes of this work, and one which the author hopes will give it a claim upon the attention of all those desiring information on the subject of the gospel, as well as to the quorums of seventies and elders to whom we believe it will be of special service.  Before the work went to press the manuscript was submitted to a committee of brethren appointed by the First Presidency. Elders John Nicholson, George Reynolds and James E. Talmage constituted that committee. The author is very much indebted to them for their patient consideration of his manuscript, and for the very valuable suggestions and corrections made by them. They reported favorably to the First Presidency on the work, and it is now presented to the students of Ecclesiastical History--in which the church of Christ should abound--in the hope that it will be of service to them in their researches in this most interesting department of knowledge.  This, the fifth edition, is uniform with the previous edition, in every respect.  _The Publishers_  Footnotes  1. Pearl of Price, page 85.    CONTENTS  DEDICATION INTRODUCTION  PART I.

Birth of Messiah.--Jesus Christ, the Son of God and Savior of the world, was born, most probably, in the year of Rome 753; at a period of the year corresponding to our month of April (see notes 1, 2, end of section). The place of his birth was Bethlehem [Beth-le-hem],[1] a small town about four miles south"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52391"],["title","Outlines of Ecclesiastical History (#1)"],["body","Jerusalem. The birth-place of Messiah was foretold by Micah [Mi-kah], the prophet, more than seven hundred years before the event, in the following prophecy:      But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah [Ef-ra-tah], though thou be little     among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth     unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been     from of old, from everlasting.[2]  2. Parentage of Christ.--Messiah was born of the virgin Mary, a descendant of David, and the espoused wife of Joseph, a carpenter in the little village of Nazareth [Naz-a-reth], who, notwithstanding his humble station in life, was also a descendant of the royal house of David. An angel appeared unto Mary previous to her conception, and thus addressed her:   Hail thou that art highly favored, the Lord is with thee: blessed  art thou among women. And when she saw him, she was troubled at his  saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.  And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favor  with God. And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring  forth a son, and shall call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and  shalt be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give  unto him the throne of his father David: and he shall {12} reign over  the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.  Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a  man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall  come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee:  therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee, shall be  called the Son of God. * * * And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the  Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.[3]  3. These two, the mother of Jesus and her betrothed husband, had left their home in Nazareth to enroll their names as members of the house of David, in a census which had been ordered by the Emperor Augustus, and while at Bethlehem Mary was delivered of her son. The enrollment ordered by the emperor had called so many strangers into the little town of Bethlehem that on the arrival of Joseph and Mary there was no room at the inn for them, and they had to take up quarters in the stable adjacent. There, among the hay and straw spread for the food and rest of the cattle, Christ was born. (Note 2, end of section.)  4. The Angelic Announcement.--The birth of Christ was announced to a few shepherds watching their flock by night--about a mile distant from the village of Bethlehem--by an angel, surrounded about by the glory of God, who said:      Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy,     which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the     city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall     be a sign unto you; ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling     clothes, lying in a manger. And suddenly there was with the angel a     multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory to     God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.[4]  {13} A visit to the village confirmed the strange proclamation of the angel--they found the mother and child.  5. The Inquiry of the Magi.--Not alone by voice of angels was the birth of Messiah announced, but \"wise men from the east\" who had seen his star in the firmament came to Jerusalem about the time of his birth, inquiring--\"Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.\" [5]  6. Nor were signs of Messiah's birth seen alone on the eastern hemisphere; to the people of the western hemisphere signs were also given; \"a new star did appear,\" according to the words of the Nephite prophets, at Zarahemla; the Nephites saw it and to them, as well as to the wise men of the east, a star announced the birth of him who was to be King of the Jews[6] and the Savior of the world. Another sign was given to the Nephites, which had also been predicted by their prophets; the night before[7] Jesus was born remained beautifully light on the western hemisphere. This event is thus recorded in the Book of Mormon:      And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were     fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold at the     going down of the sun, there was no darkness; and the people began     to be astonished, because there was no darkness when the time of     night came. * * * There was no darkness in all that night, but it     was light as though it was midday. And it came to pass that the sun     did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and     they [the Nephites] knew that it was the day that the Lord should     be born, because of the sign which had been given.[8]  7. The Alarm of King Herod.--The inquiry made by the \"wise men\" from the east concerning the one who was \"born King of the Jews,\" alarmed the jealousy of Herod, and learning from the chief priests and scribes that Bethlehem was the place {14} where the deliverer of Israel was to be born, he sent the wise men there, strictly charging them to search diligently, and when they had found the child to bring him word that he too might worship him. On the way to Bethlehem the star they had seen in the east went before them until it stood over where the child was. They found the babe with Mary his mother and they worshipped him, giving him presents of gold and frankincense and myrrh. They were commanded of God in a dream, however, not to return to Herod, so they departed into their own country another way.  8. Joseph, too, after the departure of the wise men, was warned in a dream to flee out of the land, for Herod would seek the young child to destroy him. He was commanded to go into Egypt and remain there until the Lord should call him to return. In obedience to these divine commandments, Joseph took the mother and child and fled in the night into Egypt.  9. Herod's wrath knew no bounds when he found that the wise men had not obeyed him; and in order that he might not be baffled in his determination to destroy the one he feared would supplant himself or his posterity in the throne of Israel, he sent out an edict commanding that all the children in Bethlehem two years old and under should be slain. Then was fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah:      In Rama [Ra-ma] was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping     and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not     be comforted because they were not.[9] (See note 3, end of section.)  10. Death of Herod.--(note 4 end of section). After Herod's death, Joseph was again visited, in a dream, by an angel, who commanded him to return with the child and his mother into the land of Israel; for they who had sought the young child's life were dead. Then was fulfilled that which was {15}spoken by the prophet of the Lord, (Hosea), \"Out of Egypt have I called my son.\" Joseph obeyed the commandment, but as he approached Judea and learned that Archelaus [Ar-ke-la-us] the son of Herod reigned in his father's stead, he was fearful and instead of remaining in Judea, he went into Galilee [Gal-i-lee] and dwelt in the little town of Nazareth--his former home--\"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene\" [10] [Naz-a-reen].  NOTES.  1. The Year of Messiah's Birth.--\"The Birth of Christ was first made an era, from which to reckon dates,\" says the learned translator of Dr. Mosheim's _Institutes_,--Murdock--\"by Dionysius Exiguus, [Di-o-nish-i-us Exs-ig-u-us] about A. D. 532. He supposed Christ to have been born on the 25th of December, in the year of Rome 753, and this computation has been followed in practice to this day; notwithstanding the learned are well agreed that it must be incorrect.\" It will be seen, however, from what follows, from the same author, that all is uncertainty with the learned in respect to this subject:  \"To ascertain the true time of Christ's birth, there are two principal data afforded by the Evangelists: I. It is clear, from Matt. ii: 1, etc., that Christ was born before the death of Herod the Great, who died about Easter, in the year of Rome 749 or 750. Now, if Christ was born in the December next before Herod's death, it must have been in the year of Rome 748 or 749; and, of course, four, if not five years anterior to the Dionysian or Vulgar era: II. It is probable, from Luke iii: 1, 2, 23, that Jesus was 'about' thirty years of age in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar. Now, the reign of Tiberius may be considered as commencing at the time he became sole emperor, in August of the year of Rome 767; or (as there is some reason to suppose that Augustus made him partner in the government two years before he died), we may begin his reign in the year of Rome 765. The fifteenth year of Tiberius will therefore be either the year of Rome 781 or 779. From which deduct 30, and we have the year of Rome 751 or 749 for the year of Christ's birth; the former two and the latter four years earlier than the Dionysian computation. Comparing these results with those obtained from the death of Herod, it is generally supposed the true time of Christ's birth was the year of Rome 749, or four years before the Vulgar era. {16} _But the conclusion is not certain, because there is uncertainty in the data_. (1.) It is not certain that we ought to reckon Tiberius' reign as beginning two years before the death of Augustus. (2.) Luke says '_about_ thirty years of age.' This is indefinite and may be understood of twenty-nine, thirty, or thirty-one years. (3.) It is not certain in which of the two years mentioned Herod died; nor how long before that event the Savior was born. Respecting the month and day of Christ's birth, we are left almost wholly to conjecture.\"  It will be demanded on what authority I have gone counter to the conclusions of the learned on this subject by keeping to the"]]]
