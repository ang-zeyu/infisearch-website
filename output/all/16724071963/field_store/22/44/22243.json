As the old friends have treated us so badly, I'm goin' in for new ones.\"  \"You quite mystify me, Dan. Tell me all about it.\"  Dan did so.  \"He's very kind to a stranger, Dan. Heaven will reward him, I am sure.\"  \"I hope it will, mother. I wish I was a rich man. I should enjoy helping those who needed it. If I ever get rich--though it doesn't look much like it now--I will do all the good I can. I wonder rich men don't do it oftener.\"  \"It springs from thoughtlessness sometimes, Dan.\"  \"And from selfishness pretty often,\" added Dan, whose views of human nature were considerably less favorable than they had been in his more prosperous days. \"A good many men are like Tom Carver, as he is now and will be when he is grown up.\"  \"Perhaps there are more good and generous men than we suppose, Dan,\" urged his mother, who liked to think well of her fellow-beings.  \"Like Mr. Gripp and our landlord, for instance. By the way, I hear Mr. Grab's steps on the stairs. I want to deal with him. Just you step into the bedroom, mother.\"  Mrs. Mordaunt had no desire to meet Mr. Grab, but she was a little afraid of Dan's impetuous temper.  \"You will treat him respectfully, won't you, Dan?\" she urged, as she turned to go into the adjoining room.  Dan's eyes danced with fun.  \"I'll treat him with all the respect he deserves, mother,\" he answered.  Mrs. Mordaunt looked a little doubtful, for she understood Dan, but did not say more, for Mr. Grab was already knocking at the door.  \"Don't come out, whatever you hear, mother,\" said Dan, in a low voice. \"I'll come out all right, though I shall tantalize him a little at first.\"  The knock was repeated.  \"Come in!\" Dan called out, in a loud, clear tone.  The door opened, and a thin, undersized man, with bushy red hair and the look of a cross mastiff, entered the room.  Before his entrance Dan had seated himself in the plain wooden rocking-chair with his feet on a cricket. He looked quite easy and unconcerned.  \"How are you, Grab?\" he said, in a friendly manner.  \"You might call me _Mr._ Grab,\" returned the landlord, angrily.  \"I've no objection, I'm sure, Mr. Grab,\" said Dan. \"How is your health? You're looking very yellow. Got the jaundice?\"  \"I am perfectly well, and I am not yellow at all. Do you mean to insult me?\" demanded Grab, irritated.  \"I wouldn't do that for a cent, Mr. Grab. I am glad you feel well, though you ain't looking so. It's very friendly of you to come round to see me and mother.\"  \"Where is your mother?\" snapped Mr. Grab.  \"She is engaged just now, and won't have the pleasure of seeing you.\"  \"But I _must_ see her.\"  \"Must! You are quite mistaken. You can't see her. You can see me.\"  \"I've seen more of you than I want to already,\" said Grab.  \"That isn't talking like a friend, Mr. Grab,\" said Dan, \"when I'm so glad to see you. Perhaps you have come on business.\"  \"Of course I have come on business, and you know very well what that business is, you young monkey.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Grab, you are very complimentary. It isn't about the rent, is it?\"  \"Of course it is!\" snapped the landlord.  \"Oh, dear, how could I have forgotten that it was rent-day,\" said Dan, with well-feigned confusion.  Mr. Grab's brow grew dark. He concluded that he wasn't going to collect the rent, and that always chafed him.  \"It's your business to know when rent-day comes,\" he said, bringing down his fist with such emphasis on the table that he hurt his knuckles, to Dan's secret delight.  \"Please don't break the table, Grab,\" said Dan.  \"Oh, blast the table!\" said Grab, surveying his red knuckles.  \"We haven't got any blasting powder, and I don't think it would be a very interesting experiment. It might blow you up, for you are nearest to it.\"  \"Have done with this trifling, boy,\" said the landlord.  \"I am afraid you got out of the wrong end of the bed this morning, Mr. Grab. You should control yourself.\"  \"Look here, boy,\" said the landlord, savagely, \"do you know what I am tempted to do?\"  \"No, what is it?\" asked Dan, indifferently.  \"I am strongly tempted to chastise you for your impudence.\"  Dan looked critically at the small, thin form, and secretly decided that Mr. Grab would find it difficult to carry out his threat.  \"Oh, how you frighten me!\" he said. \"I don't believe I shall sleep any to-night.\"  Mr. Grab made a motion to pound on the table again, but he looked at his red knuckles and wisely forbore.  \"I can't waste any more time,\" he said. \"You must pay your rent, or turn out. I want six dollars.\"  \"Won't it do, Mr. Grab, if we pay you next week?\"  \"No, it won't. The rent must be paid to-day, or out you go.\"  \"Why doesn't Dan pay him?\" thought Mrs. Mordaunt, uneasily. \"Really, he ought not to tease the poor man so. He has such a bad temper, he might hurt Dan.\"  \"Mr. Gripp is owing mother for work. As soon as he pays her, I will call round at your office and pay you.\"  \"It won't do,\" said Grab. \"I won't let you stay here another night, and I mean to have security for my money, too.\"  So saying, the landlord seized the bundle of vests which lay on the table beside him.  This aroused Dan to action.  He sprang to his feet, his eyes flashing with anger.  \"Put down that bundle, Mr. Grab!\" he exclaimed.  \"Then pay me my rent,\" said the landlord, recoiling a little.  \"Put down that bundle before you say another word about rent. It isn't my mother's or mine. You have no business with it.\"  \"What do you mean, boy, by your impudence?\" demanded the landlord, a little uneasily.  \"I mean that if you take that bundle from the room, I shall put you in charge of the nearest policeman on a charge of stealing.\"  \"That is nonsense,\" said Grab; but he looked nervous, and laid down the bundle.  \"All right, Grab,\" said Dan. \"Now, as I don't want any more of your company, I'll pay the rent, if you'll give me a receipt.\"  \"Have you got the money?\" asked Grab, astonished.  \"Of course I have. I never told you I hadn't.\"  \"You made me think so.\"  \"It isn't my business what you think. There, that is settled, and now, Mr. Grab, I have the honor of wishing you good-evening. I hope you won't hurt your knuckles again.\"  Mr. Grab left the room, inwardly wishing that he could wring Dan's neck.  \"Oh, Dan, how could you?\" asked his mother, reproachfully, as she re-entered the room.  \"He deserves it all,\" said Dan. \"Didn't he turn out the poor Donovans on a cold day last winter? I have no pity for him.\"  \"He may turn us out.\"  \"Not as long as we pay the rent.\"     CHAPTER VII.  MR. GRIPP IS WORSTED.   Punctually at three o'clock Dan knocked at the door of Mr. Grant's room in the Astor House.  That gentleman looked at his watch as he admitted our hero.  \"You are punctual to the minute,\" he said. \"Your watch keeps excellent time.\"  \"I'll tell you why,\" answered Dan, smiling. \"I always keep it at Tiffany's. I don't dare to carry it for fear it will get out of order.\"  \"You ought to have a watch,\" said Mr. Grant. \"That will come in time.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Dan. \"Then I could be sure to keep my business appointments. Now I have to depend on the City Hall clock. I'd rather look at it than carry it round.\"  \"Well, Dan, do you think Mr. Gripp is prepared to receive us?\"  \"He'll be glad to see you. He'll think you are going to buy some clothes. I don't think he'll be very happy to see me.\"  \"He must see us both, or neither. Has he any good clothes?\"  \"Yes, sir--good enough for me. I don't think you would like to patronize his establishment.\"  \"By the way, Dan, you have given me an order for money, and I have not handed you the equivalent.\"  \"You may not get the money, sir.\"  \"I will make the effort at any rate. By the way, Dan, that coat of yours is getting shabby.\"  \"It is the best I have, sir. Boys in my business don't have to dress much.\"  \"That gives me an idea. Please hand me my hat, and we will start.\"  The two left the Astor House together. One or two of Dan's associates whom they encountered on the way, were surprised to see him walking on terms of apparent friendly companionship with a well-to-do stranger, but decided that Dan was probably acting as his guide.  They found Mr. Gripp standing as usual in the door-way of his shop watching for customers. He did not at first observe Dan, but his attention was drawn to Mr. Grant.  \"Walk in, sir,\" he said, obsequiously. \"You will find what you want here. Styles fashionable, and as for prices--we defy competition.\"  Alexander Grant paused, and looked critically about him. He understood very well the sort of establishment he was about to enter, and would not have thought of doing so but in Dan's interests.  He stepped over the threshold, and Dan was about to follow, when the eagle eye of Mr. Gripp recognized our hero.  \"Clear out, you young rascal!\" he exclaimed. \"Don't you come round here any more.\"  Dan did not answer, for he knew Mr. Grant would do so for him.  Mr. Grant turned back, and said, quietly:  \"To whom are you speaking, sir?\"  \"I beg your pardon, sir--it's that boy.\"  \"Then, sir, you will oblige me by stopping at once. That boy is in my company and under my protection.\"  Nathan Gripp stared as if transfixed.  \"Do you know him, sir?\" he asked.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You are mistaken in him, sir. He's an artful young rascal. He was here yesterday, and acted outrageously. He assaulted my clerk and insulted me.\"  \"I have nothing to do with that. He is in my company, and if I enter the store he will.\"  \"Oh, of course, if he's with you he can come in. Samuel, show the gentleman what he wants.\"  Dan smiled, and nothing but a sense of his own interest prevented Mr. Gripp from objecting to his entrance.  \"What will I show you, sir?\" asked the callow young man named Samuel, glaring at Dan in vivid remembrance of the blow which had doubled him up.  \"Have you any coats and vests that will fit this young gentleman?\"  \"Young gentleman!\" repeated Samuel, mechanically, glancing at Dan in silent hatred.  \"That means me, Samuel,\" said Dan, mischievously. \"Samuel is an old friend "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53345"],["title","Dan, the Newsboy (#5)"],["body","mine, Mr. Grant.\"  \"I think we can fit him,\" said Samuel, by no means relishing the task of waiting upon his young opponent. \"Take off your coat, young feller.\"  \"Don't be too familiar, Samuel. You may call me Mr. Mordaunt,\" said Dan.  \"I'll be ---- if I do,\" muttered the young man.  Dan took off his coat, and tried on the one submitted to his inspection. He afterward tried on the vest, and they proved to be a good fit.  \"Do they suit you, Dan?\" asked Mr. Grant.  \"Yes, sir, they fit as well as if they had been made for me.\"  \"What is the price of these articles, young man?\" asked Mr. Grant.  \"Twelve dollars,\" answered Samuel.  \"He'll take eight,\" suggested Dan, in a low voice.  Mr. Grant knew well enough the ways of Chatham street merchants to appreciate the suggestion.  \"That is too high,\" he said, quietly.  Samuel, who was trained to read customers, after a glance at Mr. Grant's face, prepared to reduce the price.  \"We might say eleven,\" he said, meditatively. \"Shall I put them up?\"  \"Not at that price.\"  \"You don't want us to give 'em away?\" said Samuel, in the tone of one whose reasonable demands had been objected to.  \"There is no fear of that, I apprehend,\" returned Mr. Grant, dryly.  \"I've no objection, I'm sure,\" remarked Dan, on his own account.  \"I'd make a few remarks to you, young feller, if you were alone,\" he read in the eyes of the indignant salesman, and Dan enjoyed the restraint which he knew Samuel was putting upon himself.  \"You are still asking too much,\" said the customer.  \"What'll you give, sir?\" asked Samuel, diplomatically.  \"Eight dollars.\"  \"Eight dollars! Why the cloth cost more than that!\" protested Samuel.  \"The work didn't cost you much, I presume.\"  \"We pay the highest prices for work in this establishment, sir,\" said Samuel, hastily.  He forgot that Dan knew better.  \"So they do, Mr. Grant,\" said Dan. \"They pay twenty cents apiece for making vests.\"  \"We pay more than that to our best hands,\" said Samuel.  \"You told me you never paid more,\" retorted Dan.  Mr. Grant interrupted this discussion.  \"Young man,\" said he, \"I will give you eight dollars for the clothes.\"  \"Say nine, sir.\"  \"Not a cent more.\"  As the regular price was eight dollars--when they couldn't get any more--Samuel felt authorized to conclude the bargain without consulting Mr. Gripp.  \"Shall I do up the clothes?\" he asked.  \"No,\" said Dan, \"I'll wear 'em. You may put up my old ones.\"  Samuel felt it derogatory to his dignity to obey the orders of our hero, but there was no alternative.  The bundle was placed in Dan's hands.  \"Now write me a receipt for the price,\" said Mr. Grant.  This was done.  Mr. Grant counted out six dollars and eighty cents.  \"I have an order upon you for the balance,\" he said.  \"I don't understand,\" ejaculated Samuel.  \"Your principal owes my young friend, or his mother, one dollar and twenty cents for work. This you will receive as part of the price.\"  \"I must see Mr. Gripp,\" said Samuel.  Mr. Gripp came forward frowning.  \"We can't take the order, sir,\" he said. \"The boy's money is not yet due.\"  \"Isn't the work done and delivered?\"  \"Yes, sir; but it is our rule not to pay till a whole dozen is delivered.\"  \"Then it is a rule which you must break,\" said Mr. Grant, firmly.  \"We can't.\"  \"Then I refuse to take the suit.\"  Nathan Gripp did not like to lose the sale on the one hand, or abdicate his position on the other.  \"Tell your mother,\" he said to Dan, \"that when she has finished another half-dozen vests I will pay her the whole.\"  He reflected that the stranger would be gone, and Dan would be in his power.  \"Thank you,\" said Dan, \"but mother's agreed to work for Jackson. He pays better.\"  \"Then you'll have to wait for your pay,\" said Mr. Gripp, sharply.  \"Don't you care to sell this suit?\" asked Mr. Grant, quickly.  \"Yes, sir, but under the circumstances we must ask all cash.\"  \"You won't get it, sir.\"  \"Then I don't think we care to sell,\" said Gripp, allowing his anger to overcome his interest.  \"Very good. I think, Dan, we can find quite as good a bargain at Jackson's. Mr. Gripp, do I understand that you decline to pay this bill?\"  \"I will pay when the other half-dozen vests are made,\" said Gripp, stubbornly.  \"I have nothing to do with that. The bill is mine, and it is with me you have to deal. The boy has nothing to do with it.\"  \"Is that so?\" asked Gripp, in surprise.  \"It is. You may take your choice. Settle the bill now, or I shall immediately put it in a lawyer's hands, who will know how to compel you to pay it.\"  A determined will carries the day.  \"Take this gentleman's money, Samuel,\" said Gripp, in a tone of annoyance.  There was no further trouble. Dan walked out of the store better dressed than he had been since the days of his prosperity.  \"How can I thank you, Mr. Grant?\" he said, gratefully.  \"By continuing to care for your mother, my lad. You are lucky to have a mother living. Mine is dead, God bless her! Now, my lad, what do you think of my success in collecting bills?\"  \"You were too many for old Gripp, sir. He won't sleep to-night.\"  \"He doesn't deserve to, for he grows rich by defrauding the poor who work for him.\"  Opposite the City Hall Park Dan and his friend separated.  \"I shall not see you again, my boy,\" said Mr. Grant, \"for I take the evening train. If you ever come to St. Louis, find me out.\"  \"I will, sir.\"  \"That's a good man,\" said Dan, as he wended his way homeward. \"If there were more such, it would be good for poor people like mother and me. If I ever get rich, I mean to help along those that need it.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  MIKE RAFFERTY'S TRICK.   Dan carefully husbanded the money which Mr. Grant had lent him, and the result was that for two months he was comparatively easy in his circumstances. His mother earned five cents more daily, on account of the higher price she received for work, and though this was a trifle, it was by no means to be despised where the family income was so small as in the case of the Mordaunts.  Still Dan was not satisfied.  \"Mother,\" said he, \"I suppose I ought to be contented with earning enough to pay our expenses, but I should like to be saving something.\"  \"Yes, Dan, it would be pleasant. But we ought to be thankful for what we are now receiving.\"  \"But, mother, suppose I should fall sick? What should we do then?\"  Mrs. Mordaunt shuddered.  \"Don't mention such a thing, Dan,\" she said. \"The very idea terrifies me.\"  \"But it might happen, for all that.\"  \"Don't you feel well, Dan? Is anything the matter with you?\" asked Mrs. Mordaunt, anxiously.  \"Don't be frightened, mother,\" answered Dan, laughing. \"I'm as strong as a horse, and can eat almost as much. Still, you know, we would feel safer to have a little money in the savings-bank.\"  \"There isn't much chance of that, Dan, unless we earn more than we do now.\"  \"You are right there. Well, I suppose there is no use thinking of it. By the way, mother, you've got enough money on hand to pay the rent to-morrow, haven't you?\"  \"Yes, Dan, and a dollar over.\"  \"That's good.\"  The door of the room was partly open, and the last part of the conversation was heard by Mike Rafferty, the son of the tenant who occupied the room just over the Mordaunts. He was a ne'er-do-well, who had passed more than one term of imprisonment at Blackwell's Island. His mother was an honest, hard-working washerwoman, who toiled early and late to support herself and her three children. Mike might have given her such assistance that she could have lived quite comfortably, for her own earnings were by no means inconsiderable. Her wash-tub paid her much more than Mrs. Mordaunts needle could possibly win, and she averaged a dollar a day where her more refined neighbor made but twenty-five cents. But Mike, instead of helping, was an additional burden. He got his meals regularly at home, but contributed scarcely a dollar a month to the common expenses. He was a selfish rowdy, who was likely to belong permanently to the shiftless and dangerous classes of society.  Mike had from time to time made approaches to intimacy with Dan, who was nearly two years younger, but Dan despised him for his selfishly burdening his mother with his support, and didn't encourage him. Naturally, Mike hated Dan, and pronounced him \"stuck up\" and proud, though our hero associated familiarly with more than one boy ranking no higher in the social scale than Mike Rafferty.  Only the day before, Mike, finding himself out of funds, encountering Dan on the stairs, asked for the loan of a quarter.  \"I have no money to spare,\" answered Dan.  \"You've got money, Dan; I saw you take out some a minute ago.\"  \"Yes, I've got the money, but I won't lend it.\"  \"You're a mane skinflint,\" said Mike, provoked.  \"Why am I?\"  \"Because you've got the money, and you won't lend it.\"  \"What do you want to do with it?\"  \"I want to go to the Old Bowery to-night, if you must know.\"  \"If you wanted it for your mother I might have lent it to you, though I need all I can earn for my own mother.\"  \"It's for my mother I want it, thin,\" said Mike. \"I guess I won't go to the theater to-night.\"  \"That's too thin. Your mother would never see the color of it.\"  \"Won't you lend me, thin?\"  \"No, I can't. If you want money, why don't you earn it, as I do?\"  \"I ain't lucky.\"  \"It isn't luck. If you go to work and sell papers or black boots, you will be able to help your mother and pay your way to the theater yourself.\"  \"Kape your advice to yourself,\" said Mike, sullenly. \"I don't want it.\"  \"You'd rather have my money,\" said Dan, good-humoredly.  \"I'll never see that. You're too mane.\"  \"All right. I'll be _mane_, then.\"  \"I'd like to put a head on you,\" muttered Mike.  \"I've got one already. I don't need another,\" said Dan.  \"Oh, you think you're mighty smart wid your jokes,\" said Mike.  Dan smiled and walked off, leaving Mike more his enemy than ever.  This was the boy who overheard Mrs. Mordaunt say that she had more than the rent already saved up. Mike's cupidity"]]]
