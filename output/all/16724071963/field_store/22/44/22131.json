But the walking-stick did not think best to answer immediately, but took entirely a new and surprising track. It actually went to quoting Scripture!  “My eyes are dim,” said the cane, “and I never had much learning; canes weren’t sent to school when I was young. Won’t you read the thirty-fifth verse of the twentieth chapter of Acts.”  Willie turned to the stand and saw the Bible open at that verse. He did not feel surprised. It seemed natural enough to him. He read the verse, not aloud, but to himself, for Old Ebony seemed to hear his thoughts. He read:--  “Ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.”  “Now,” said the walking-stick, stepping or hopping up toward the lounge and leaning thoughtfully over the head of it, “Now, I say that it is a shame that when the birthday of that Lord Jesus, who gave himself away, and who said it is more blessed to give than to receive, comes round, all of you Sunday-school scholars are thinking only of what you are going to get.”  Willie was about to say that they gave as well as received on Christmas, and that his class had already raised the money to buy a Bible Dictionary for their teacher. But Old Ebony seemed to guess his thought, and he only said, “And that’s another shame!”  Willie couldn’t see how this could be, and he thought the walking-stick was using very strong language indeed. I think myself the cane spoke too sharply, for I don’t think the harm lies in giving to and receiving from our friends, but in neglecting the poor. But you don’t care what I think, you want to know what the cane said.  “I’m pretty well acquainted with Scripture,” said Old Ebony, “having spent fourteen years in company with a minister. Now won’t you please read the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter of”--  But before the cane could finish the sentence, Willie heard some one opening the door. It was his father. He looked round in bewilderment. The oil in the lamp had burned out, and it was dark. The fire was low, and the room chilly.  “Heigh-ho, Willie, my son,” said Mr. Blake, “where’s your light, and where’s your fire. This is a cold reception. What have you been doing?”  “Listening to the cane talk,” he replied; and thinking what a foolish answer that was, he put on some more coal, while his mother, who was lighting the lamp, said he must have been dreaming. The walking-stick stood in its corner, face to the wall, as if it had never been a talking stick.     CHAPTER IV.  _MR. BLAKE AGREES WITH THE WALKING-STICK._   Early on Sunday morning Willie awoke and began to think about Sitles, and to wish he had money to buy him a broom-machine. And then he thought of widow Martin. But all his thinking would do no good. Then he thought of what Old Ebony had said, and he wished he could know what that text was that the cane was just going to quote.  “It was,” said Willie, “the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter of something. I’ll see.”  So he began with the beginning of the Bible, and looked first at Genesis xiv. 12, 13. But it was about the time when Abraham had heard of the capture of Lot and mustered his army to recapture him. He thought a minute.  “That can’t be what it is,” said Willie, “I’ll look at Exodus.”  In Exodus it was about standing still at the Red Sea and waiting for God’s salvation. It might mean that God would deliver the poor. But that was not just what the cane was talking about. It was about giving gifts to friends. So he went on to Leviticus. But it was about the wave offering, and the sin offering, and the burnt offering. That was not it. And so he went from book to book until he had reached the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter of the book of Judges. He was just reading in that place about Samson’s riddle, when his mamma called him to breakfast.  He was afraid to say anything about it at the table for fear of being laughed at. But he was full of what the walking-stick said. And at family worship his father read the twentieth chapter of Acts. When he came to the part about its being more blessed to give than to receive, Willie said, “That’s what the cane said.”  “What did you say?” asked his father.  “I was only thinking out loud,” said Willie.  “Don’t think out loud while I am reading,” said Mr. Blake.  Willie did not find time to look any further for the other verses. He wished his father had happened on them instead of the first text which the cane quoted.  In church he kept thinking all the time about the cane. “Now what could it mean by the twelfth and thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter? There isn’t anything in the Bible against giving away presents to one’s friends. It was only a dream anyhow, and maybe there’s nothing in it.”  But he forgot the services, I am sorry to say, in his thoughts. At last Mr. Blake arose to read his text. Willie looked at him, but thought of what the cane said. But what was it that attracted his attention so quickly?  “The twelfth and thirteenth verses”--  “Twelfth and thirteenth!” said Willie to himself.  “Of the fourteenth chapter,” said the minister.  “Fourteenth chapter!” said Willie, almost aloud.  “Of Luke.”  Willie was all ears, while Mr. Blake read: “Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbors, lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind.”  “That’s it!” he said, half aloud, but his mother jogged him.  The minister added the next verse also, and read: “And thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.”  Willie had never listened to a sermon as he did to that. He stopped two or three times to wonder whether the cane had been actually about to repeat his father’s text to him, or whether he had not heard his father repeat it at some time, and had dreamed about it.  I am not going to tell you much about Mr. Blake’s sermon. It was a sermon that he and the walking-stick had prepared while they were going round among the poor. I think Mr. Blake did not strike his cane down on the sidewalk for nothing. Most of that sermon must have been hammered out in that way, when he and the walking-stick were saying, “Something must be done!” For that was just what that sermon said. It told about the wrong of forgetting, on the birthday of Christ, to do anything for the poor. It made everybody think. But Mr. Blake did not know how much of that sermon went into Willie Blake’s long head, as he sat there with his white full forehead turned up to his father.     CHAPTER V.  _THE FATHER PREACHES AND THE SON PRACTICES._   That afternoon, Willie was at Sunday-school long before the time. He had a plan.  “I’ll tell you what, boys,” said he, “let’s not give Mr. Marble anything this year; and let’s ask him not to give us anything. Let’s get him to put the money he would use for us with the money we should spend on a present for him, and give it to buy coal for Old Aunt Parm’ly.”  “I mean to spend all my money on soft gum drops and tarts,” said Tommy Puffer; “they’re splendid!” and with that he began, as usual, to roll his soft lips together in a half chewing, half sucking manner, as if he had a half dozen cream tarts under his tongue, and two dozen gum drops in his cheeks.  “Tommy,” said stumpy little Sammy Bantam, “it’s a good thing you didn’t live in Egypt, Tommy, in the days of Joseph.”  “Why?” asked Tommy.  “Because,” said Sammy, looking around the room absently, as if he hardly knew what he was going to say, “because, you see”--and then he opened a book and began to read, as if he had forgotten to finish the sentence.  “Well, why?” demanded Tommy, sharply.  “Well, because if Joseph had had to feed you during the seven years of plenty, there wouldn’t have been a morsel left for the years of famine!”  The boys laughed as boys will at a good shot, and Tommy reddened a little and said, regretfully, that he guessed the Egyptians hadn’t any dough-nuts.  Willie did not forget his main purpose, but carried his point in his own class. He still had time to speak to some of the boys and girls in other classes. Everybody liked to do what Willie asked; there was something sweet and strong in his blue eyes, eyes that “did not seem to have any bottom, they were so deep,” one of the girls said. Soon there was an excitement in the school, and about the door; girls and boys talking and discussing, but as soon as any opposition came up Willie’s half coaxing but decided way bore it down. I think he was much helped by Sammy’s wit, which was all on his side. It was agreed, finally, that whatever scholars meant to give to teachers, or teachers to scholars, should go to the poor.  The teachers caught the enthusiasm, and were very much in favor of the project, for in the whole movement they saw the fruit of their own teaching.  The superintendent had been detained, and was surprised to find the school standing in knots about the room. He soon called them to order, and expressed his regrets that they should get into such disorder. There was a smile on all faces, and he saw that there was something more in the apparent disorder than he thought. After school it was fixed that each class should find its own case of poverty. The young men’s and the young women’s Bible classes undertook to supply Sitles with a broom-machine, a class of girls took Aunt Parm’ly under their wing, other classes knew of other cases of need, and so each class had its hands full. But Willie could not get any class to see that Widow Martin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52935"],["title","Mr. Blake's Walking-Stick: A Christmas Story for Boys and Girls (#3)"],["body","a sewing-machine. That was left for his own; and how should a class of eight boys do it?     CHAPTER VI.  _SIXTY-FIVE DOLLARS._   Willie took the boys into the parsonage. They figured on it. There were sixty-five dollars to be raised to buy the machine. The seven boys were together, for Tommy Puffer had gone home. He said he didn’t feel like staying, and Sammy Bantam thought he must be a little hungry.  Willie attacked the problem, sixty-five dollars. Toward that amount they had three dollars and a half that they had intended to spend on a present for Mr. Marble. That left just sixty-one dollars and fifty cents to be raised. Willie ran across the street and brought Mr. Marble. He said he had made up his mind to give the boys a book apiece, and that each book would cost a dollar. It was rather more than he could well afford; but as he had intended to give eight dollars for their presents, and as he was pleased with their unselfish behavior, he would make it ten.  “Good!” said Charley Somerset, who always saw the bright side of things,“that makes it all, except fifty-one dollars and a half.”  “Yes,” said Sammy Bantam, “and you’re eleven feet high, lacking a couple of yards!”  Willie next called his father in, and inquired how much his Christmas present was to cost.  “Three and a half,” said his father.  “That’s a lot! Will you give me the money instead?”  “Yes; but I meant to give you a Life of George Stephenson, and some other books on engineering.”  This made Willie think a moment; but seeing the walking-stick in the corner, he said: “Mrs. Martin must have a machine, and that three and a half makes seventeen dollars. How to get the other forty-eight is the question.”  Mr. Blake and Mr. Marble both agreed that the boys could not raise so much money, and should not undertake it. But Willie said there was nobody to do it, and he guessed it would come somehow. The other boys, when they came to church that evening, told Willie that their presents were commuted for money also; so they had twenty-five dollars toward the amount. But that was the end of it, and there were forty dollars yet to come!  Willie lay awake that night, thinking. Mr. Marble’s class could not raise the money. All the other classes had given all they could. And the teachers would each give in their classes. And they had raised all they could spare besides to buy nuts and candy! Good! That was just it; they would do without candy!  At school the next morning, Willie’s white head was bobbing about eagerly. He made every boy and girl sign a petition, asking the teachers not to give them any nuts or candy. They all signed except Tommy Puffer. He said it was real mean not to have any candy. They might just as well not have any Sunday-school, or any Christmas either. But seeing a naughty twinkle in Sammy Bantam’s eye, he waddled away, while Sammy fired a shot after him, by remarking that, if Tommy had been one of the Shepherds in Bethlehem, he wouldn’t have listened to the angels till he had inquired if they had any lemon-drops in their pockets!  That night the extra Teachers’ Meeting was held, and in walked white-headed Willie with stunted Sammy Bantam at his heels to keep him in countenance. When their petition was presented, Miss Belden, who sat near Willie, said, “Well done! Willie.”  “But I protest,” said Mrs. Puffer,--who was of about as handsome a figure as her son,--“I protest against such an outrage on the children. My Tommy’s been a-feeling bad about it all day. It’ll break his heart if he don’t get some candy.”  Willie was shy, but for a moment he forgot it, and, turning his intelligent blue eyes on Mrs. Puffer, he said,--  “It will break Mrs. Martin’s heart if her children are taken away from her.”  “Well,” said Mrs. Puffer, “I always did hear that the preacher’s boy was the worst in the parish, and I won’t take any impudence. My son will join the Mission School, where they aren’t too stingy to give him a bit of candy!” And Mrs. Puffer left, and everybody was pleased.  Willie got the money; but the teachers had counted on making up their festival mostly with cakes and other dainties, contributed by families. So that the candy money was only sixteen dollars, and Willie was yet a long way off from having the amount he needed. Twenty-four dollars were yet wanting.     CHAPTER VII.  _THE WIDOW AND THE FATHERLESS._   The husband of widow Martin had been killed by a railroad accident. The family were very poor. Mrs. Martin could sew, and she could have sustained her family if she had had a machine. But fingers are not worth much against iron wheels. And so, while others had machines, Mrs. Martin could not make much without one. She had been obliged to ask help from the overseer of the poor.  Mr Lampeer, the overseer, was a hard man. He had not skill enough to detect impostors, and so he had come to believe that everybody who was poor was rascally. He had but one eye, and he turned his head round in a curious way to look at you out of it. That dreadful one eye always seemed to be going to shoot. His voice had not a chord of tenderness in it, but was in every way harsh and hard. It was said that he had been a schoolmaster once. I pity the scholars.  Widow Martin lived--if you could call it living--in a tumble-down looking house, that would not have stood many earthquakes. She had tried diligently to support her family and keep them together; but the wolf stood always at the door. Sewing by hand did not bring in quite money enough to buy bread and clothes for four well children, and pay the expenses of poor little Harry’s sickness; for all through the summer and fall Harry had been sick. At last the food was gone, and there was nothing to buy fuel with. Mrs. Martin had to go to the overseer of the poor.  She was a little, shy, hard-working woman, this Mrs. Martin; so when she took her seat among the paupers of every sort in Mr. Lampeer’s office, and waited her turn, it was with a trembling heart. She watched the hard man, who didn’t mean to be so hard, but who couldn’t tell the difference between a good face and a counterfeit; she watched him as he went through with the different cases, and her heart beat every minute more and more violently. When he came to her he broke out with--  “What’s _your_ name?” in a voice that sounded for all the world as if he were accusing her of robbing a safe.  “Sarah Martin,” said the widow, trembling with terror, and growing red and white in turns. Mr. Lampeer, who was on the lookout for any sign of guiltiness, was now sure that Mrs. Martin could not be honest.  “Where do you live?” This was spoken with a half sneer.  “In Slab Alley,” whispered the widow, for her voice was scared out of her.  “How many children have you got?”  Mrs. Martin gave him the list of her five, with their ages, telling him of little Harry, who was six years old and an invalid.  “Your oldest is twelve and a girl. I have a place for her, and, I think, for the boy, too. You must bind them out. Mr. Slicker, the landlord of the Farmers’ Hotel, will take the girl, and I think James Sweeny will take the boy to run errands about the livery stable. I’ll send you some provisions and coal to-day; but you must let the children go. I’ll come to your house in a few days. Don’t object; I won’t hear a word. If you’re as poor as you let on to be, you’ll be glad enough to get your young ones into places where they’ll get enough to eat. That’s all, not a word, now.” And he turned to the next applicant, leaving the widow to go home with her heart _so_ cold.  Let Susie go to Slicker’s tavern! What kind of a house would it be without her? Who would attend to the house while she sewed? And what would become of her girl in such a place? And then to send George, who had to wait on Harry, to send him away forever was to shut out all hope of ever being in better circumstances. Then she could not sew, and the children could never help her. God pity the people that fall into the hands of public charity!  The next few days wore heavily on with the widow. What to do she did not know. At night she scarcely slept at all. When she did drop into a sleep, she dreamed that her children were starving, and woke in fright. Then she slept again, and dreamed that a one-eyed robber had gotten in at the window, and was carrying off Susie and George. At last morning came. The last of the food was eaten for breakfast, and widow Martin sat down to wait. Her mind was in a horrible state of doubt. To starve to death together, or to give up her children! That was the question which many a poor mother’s heart has had to decide. Mrs. Martin soon became so nervous she could not sew. She could not keep back the tears, and when Susie and George put their arms about her neck and asked what was the matter, it made the matter worse. It was the day before Christmas. The sleigh-bells jingled merrily. Even in Slab Alley one could hear sounds of joy at the approaching festivities. But there was no joy in Widow Martin’s house or heart. The dinner hour had come and passed. The little children were hungry. And yet Mrs. Martin had not made up her mind.  At the appointed time Lampeer came. He took out the two indentures with which the mother was to sign away all right to her two eldest children. It was in vain that the widow told him that if she lost them she could do no work for her own support, and must be forever a pauper. Lampeer had an idea that no poor person had a right to love children. Parental love was, in his eyes, or his eye, an expensive luxury that none but the rich should indulge in.  “Mrs. Martin,” he said, “you may either sign these indentures, by which your girl will get a good place as a nurse and errand girl for the tavern-keeper’s wife, and your boy will have plenty to eat and get to be a good hostler, or you and your brats may starve!” With that he took his hat and opened the door.  “Stop!” said Mrs. Martin, “I must have medicine and food, or Harry will not live till Sunday. I will"]]]
