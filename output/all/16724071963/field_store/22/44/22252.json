How do you manage to do that?  Look at the bones of the arm in a skeleton. (Frontispiece; also Fig. 3.) You will see that in the upper arm there is one rather large bone (_H_) reaching from the shoulder to the elbow, while in the fore-arm there are two, one (_U_) being wider and stouter than the other (_Ra_) at the elbow, but smaller and more slender at the wrist. The bone in the upper arm is called the =humerus=; the bone in the fore-arm, which is stoutest at the elbow, is called the =ulna=; the one which is stoutest at the wrist is called the =radius=. If you look carefully you will see that the end of the humerus at the elbow is curiously rounded, and the end of the ulna at the elbow curiously scooped out, in such a way that the one fits loosely into the other.  [Illustration: FIG 3.--_The Bones of the Upper Extremity with the Biceps Muscle._       The two tendons by which this muscle is attached to the scapula, or      shoulder-blade, are seen at _a_. P indicates the attachment of the      muscle to the radius, and hence the point of action of the power;      F, the fulcrum, the lower end of the humerus on which the upper end      of the radius (together with the ulna) moves; W, the weight (of the      hand). ]  If you try to move them about one on the other, you will find that you can easily double the ulna very closely on the humerus without their ends coming apart, and if you notice you will see that as you move the ulna up and down, its end and the end of the humerus slide over each other. But they will only slide one way, what we may call up and down. If you try to slide them from side to side, you will find that they get locked. They have only one movement, like that of a door on its hinge, and that movement is of such a kind as to double the ulna on the humerus.  Moreover, if you look a little more carefully you will find that, though you can easily double the ulna on the front of the humerus, and then pull it back again until the two are in a straight line, you cannot bend the ulna on the back of the humerus. On examining the end of the ulna you will find at the back of it a beak-like projection (Fig. 3, also Frontispiece), which when the bones are straightened out locks into the end of the humerus, and so prevents the ulna being bent any further back. This is the reason why you can only bend your arm one way. As you very well know, you can bend your arm so as to touch the top of your shoulder with your fingers, but you can’t bend it the other way so as to touch the back of your shoulder; you can’t bring it any further back than the straight line.  =14.= Well, then, at the elbow the two bones, the humerus and ulna, are so shaped and so fit into each other that the arm may be straightened or bent. In the skeleton the two bones are quite separate, _i.e._ they have to be fastened together by something, else they would fall apart. Most probably in the skeleton you have been examining they are fastened together by wires or slips of brass. But they would hold together if you took away the wire or brass slips and bound some tape round the two ends, tight enough to keep them touching each other, but loose enough to allow them to move on each other. You might easily manage it if you took short slips of tape, or, better still, of india-rubber, and placed them all round the elbow, back, front, and sides, fastening one end of each slip to the humerus and the other to the ulna. If you did this you would be imitating very closely the manner in which the bones at the elbow are kept together in your own arm. Only the slips are not made of india-rubber, but are flat bands of that stringy, or as we may now call it fibrous stuff, which in the preceding lessons you learnt to call connective tissue. These flat bands have a special name, and are called =ligaments=.  At the elbow the two ends of the ulna and humerus are kept in place by ligaments or flat bands of connective tissue.  In the skeleton, the surfaces of the two bones at the elbow where they rub against each other, though somewhat smooth, are dry. If you ever looked at the knuckle of a leg of mutton before it was cooked, you will have noticed that you have there two bones slipping over each other somewhat as they do at the elbow, and will remember that where the bones meet they are wonderfully smooth, and very moist, so as to be quite slippery. It is just the same in your own elbow; the end of the ulna and the end of the humerus are beautifully smooth and quite moist, so that they slip over each other as easily as possible. You know that your eye is always moist. It is kept moist by tears, though you don’t speak of tears until your eyes overflow with moisture; but in reality you are always crying a little. Well, there are, so to speak, tears always being shed inside the wrapping of ligaments around the elbow, and they keep the two surfaces of the bones continually moist.  The ends of bones where they touch each other are also smooth, because they are coated over with what is called gristle or cartilage. Bone is very hard and very solid; there is not much water in it. Bones dry up very little. Cartilage is not nearly so hard as bone; there is very much more water in it. When it is quite fresh it is very smooth, but because it has a good deal of water in it, it shrinks very much when it dries up, and when dried is not nearly so smooth as when it is fresh. You can see the dried-up cartilage on the ends of the bones in the skeleton--it is somewhat smooth still, but you can form no idea of how smooth it is in the living body by simply seeing it on the dried skeleton.  =At the elbow, then, we have the ends of two bones fitting into each other, so that they will move in a certain direction; these ends are smoothed with cartilage, kept moist with a fluid, and held in place by ligaments. All this is a called a joint.=  =15.= There are a great many other joints in the body besides the elbow-joint: there is the shoulder-joint, the knee-joint, the hip-joint, and so on. These differ from the elbow-joint in the shape of the ends of the bone, in the way the bones move on each other, and in several other particulars, but we must not go into these differences now. They are all like the elbow, since in each case one bone fits into another, the surfaces are coated with cartilage, are kept moist with fluid (what the grooms call joint-oil, though it is not an oil at all), and are held in place by ligaments.  I dare say you will have noticed that though I have been speaking only of the humerus and ulna at the elbow, the other bone of the fore-arm--the radius--has something to do with the elbow too. I left it out in order to simplify matters, but it is nevertheless quite true that the end of the humerus moves over the end of the radius as well as over the end of the ulna, and that the end of the radius is also coated with cartilage and is included in the wrapping of the ligaments. I might add that the radius also moves independently on the ulna, but I don’t want to trouble you with this just now. What I wanted to show you was that the elbow is a joint, a joint so constructed that it allows the fore-arm to be bent on the upper arm.  =16. In order that the arm may be bent, some force must be used.= The ulna or radius--for the two move together--must be pushed or pulled towards the humerus, or the humerus must be pushed or pulled towards the radius and ulna. How is this done in your own arm?  Take the bones of the arm; fix the top end of the humerus; tie it to something so that it cannot move. Fasten a piece of string to either the radius or ulna (it doesn’t matter which), rather near the elbow. Bore a hole through the top of the humerus and pass the string through it. Your string must be long enough to let the arm be quite straight without any strain on the string. Now, taking hold of the string where it comes out through the humerus, pull it. The fore-arm will be bent on the arm. Why? =Because you have been working a lever of the third order.=  The radius and ulna form the lever; its fulcrum is the end of the humerus in the elbow (Fig. 3, F); the weight to be moved is the weight of the radius and ulna (with that of the bones of the hand if present), and this may be represented by a weight applied at about the middle of the fore-arm; the power is the pull you give the string, and that is brought to bear on your lever at the point where the string is fastened to the radius, _i.e._ nearer the fulcrum than the point where the weight is applied; and you know that when you have the fulcrum at one end and the power between the fulcrum and the weight, you have a lever of the third order.  Now, in order to make the thing a little more like what takes place in your own arm, instead of boring a hole through the humerus, let the string glide in a groove which you will see at the top of the humerus, and fasten the end of it to the shoulder-blade or anything you like above the humerus, and let the string be just long enough to let the arm be quite straightened out, but no longer, so that when the arm is straight the string is just about tight, or at least not loose.  Now shorten the string by pinching it up into a loop. Whenever you do this you will bend the fore-arm on the arm. Suppose you used a string which you had not to pinch up, but which, when you pleased, you could make to shorten itself. =Every time it shortened itself it would pull the fore-arm up and would bend the arm--and every time it slackened again, the arm would fall back into the straight position.=  In your arm there is not a string, but a body, placed very much as our string is placed, and which has the power of shortening itself when required. Every time it shortens itself it bends the arm, and when it has done shortening and lengthens again, the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53347"],["title","Physiology (#5)"],["body","falls back into its straight position. This body which thus can shorten and lengthen itself is called a muscle.  If you put one hand on the front of your other upper arm, about half-way between your shoulder and elbow, and then bend that arm, you will feel something rising up under your hand. This is the muscle, which bends the arm, shortening, or, as we shall learn to call it, =contracting=.  In your own arm, as in the limb of the rabbit which you studied in your last lesson, the flesh is arranged in masses or bundles of various sizes and shapes, and each mass or bundle is called a muscle. There are several muscles in the arm, but there is in particular a large one occupying the front of the arm, called the =biceps=. It is a rounded mass of red flesh, considerably longer than it is broad or thick, and tapering away at either end. It is represented in Fig. 3.  You may remember that while examining the leg of the rabbit you noticed that in many of the muscles, the soft flesh, which made up the greater part of the muscle, at one or both ends of the muscle suddenly left off, and changed into much firmer material which was white and glistening. This firmer white part you were told was called the tendon of the muscle. The rest of the muscle, generally called “the belly,” is made up of what you are accustomed to call flesh, or lean meat, but which you must now learn to speak of as =muscular substance=. Every muscle, in fact, consists in the first place of a mass of muscular substance. =This muscular substance is made up of an immense number of soft strings or fibres, all running in one direction and done up into large and small bundles.= At either end of the muscle these soft muscular fibres are joined on to firmer but thinner fibres of connective or fibrous tissue. And these thinner but firmer fibres make up the cord or band of tendon with which the muscle finishes off at either end.  =It is by these tendons that the soft muscles are joined on to the hard bones, or to some of the other firm textures of the body.= The tendons are sometimes round and cord-like, sometimes flat and spread out. Sometimes they are very long, sometimes very short, so as to be scarcely visible. But always you have some amount of the firmer fibres of connective tissue joining the soft muscular fibres on to the bones, and generally the tendons are not only firmer but much thinner and more slender than the belly of the muscle.  The muscular belly of the biceps is placed in the front of the upper arm. Some little way above the elbow-joint it ends in a small round strong tendon which slips over the front of the elbow and is fastened to, _i.e._ grows on to, the radius at some little distance below the joint (Fig. 3, P). The upper part of the muscular belly ends a little below the shoulder, not in one tendon but in two[1] tendons (Fig. 3, _a_), which gliding over the end of the humerus are fastened to the shoulder-blade (or =scapula= as it is called), into which the humerus fits with a joint.  We have then in the biceps a thick fleshy muscular belly placed in the front of the arm and fastened by tendons, at one end to the shoulder-blade, and at the other to the fore-arm. What would happen if when the arm is straight and the shoulder-blade fixed, the biceps were suddenly to grow very much shorter than it was? Evidently the same thing that happened when you pinched up and shortened the string which, if you look back you will see, we supposed to be placed very much as the biceps with its tendons is placed. =The radius and ulna would be pulled up, the fore-arm would be bent on the arm.=  Now tendons have no power of shortening themselves, but muscular substance does possess this remarkable power of suddenly shortening itself. Under certain circumstances each soft muscular fibre of which the muscle is made will suddenly become shorter, and thus the whole muscle becomes shorter, and so pulls its two tendinous ends closer together, and if one end be fastened to something fixed, and the other to something moveable, the moveable thing will be moved.  This way that a muscle or a muscular fibre has of suddenly shortening itself is called a =muscular contraction=. =All muscles, all muscular fibres, have the power of contracting.= Now a mass of substance like the biceps might grow shorter in two ways. It might squeeze itself together and become smaller altogether, it might squeeze itself as you would squeeze a sponge into a smaller bulk. Or it might change its form and not its bulk, becoming thicker as it became shorter, just as you might by pressing the two ends together squeeze a long thin roll of soft wax into a short thick one. It might get shorter in either of these two ways, but it does actually do so in the latter way; it gets thicker at the same time that it gets shorter, and gets nearly as much thicker as it gets shorter. And that is why, when you put your hand on the arm which is being bent, you feel something rise up. =You feel the biceps getting thicker as it is getting shorter in order to bend the arm.=  The shortening does not last for ever. Sooner or later the muscle lengthens again, getting thinner once more, and so returns to its former state. The lengthened condition of the muscle is the natural condition, the condition of rest. The shortening or contraction is an effort which can only be continued for a certain time. The contraction bends the arm, and as long as the muscle remains shortened the arm keeps bent; but as the muscle lengthens, the weight of the hand and fore-arm, if there is nothing to prevent, straightens the arm out again.  =It is in the muscle alone, in the belly made up of muscular fibres, that the shortening takes place.= The tendons do not shorten at all. On the contrary, if anything they lengthen a little, but only a very little, when the muscle pulls upon them. Their purpose is to convey to the bone the pull of the muscle. They are not necessary, only convenient. It would be possible but awkward to do without them. Suppose the fleshy fibres of the biceps reached from the shoulder-blade to the fore-arm: you could bend your arm as before, but it would be very tiresome to have the muscle swelling up in the inside of the elbow, or on the top of the shoulder; in either place it would be very much in the way. By keeping the fleshy, the real contracting muscle, in the arm, and carrying the thin tendons to the arm and to the shoulder, you are enabled to do the work much more easily and conveniently.  Well, then, we have got thus far in understanding how the arm is bent. The biceps muscle contracts and shortens, tries to bring its two tendinous ends together. The upper tendons, being fastened to the fixed shoulder-blade, cannot move; but the lower tendon is fixed to the radius; the radius, with the ulna to which it is fastened, readily moves up and down on the elbow-joint--the shape of bones in the joint and all the arrangements of the joint, as we have seen, readily permitting this. When the muscle, then, pulls on its lower tendon, its pulls on the radius at the point where the tendon is fastened on to the bone. The radius thus pulled on forms with the ulna a lever of the third order, working on the end of the humerus as a fulcrum; and thus as the tendon is pulled the fore-arm is bent.  =17.= But now comes the question. What makes the muscle shorten or contract? You willed to move your arm, and moved it, as we have seen, by making the biceps contract; but =how did your will make the biceps contract=?  If you could examine your arm as you did the leg of the rabbit, you would find running into your biceps muscle, one or more of those soft white threads or cords, which you have already learnt to recognize as =nerves=.  These nerves seem to grow into and be lost in the biceps muscle. We need not follow them any further in that direction, but if we were to trace them in the other direction, up the arm, we should find that they soon meet with other similar nerves, and that the several nerves joining together form stouter and thicker nerve-cords. These again join others, and so we should proceed until we came to quite stoutish white nerve-trunks as they are called, which we should find passed at last between the vertebræ, somewhere in the neck, into the inside of the vertebral canal, where they became mixed up with the mass of nervous material we have already spoken of as the spinal cord.  What have these nerves to do with the bending of the arm? Why simply this. Suppose you were able without much trouble to cut across the delicate nerves going to your biceps, and did so: what would happen? You would find that you had lost all power of bending your arm; however much you willed it, there would be no swelling rise up in your arm. Your biceps would remain perfectly quiet, and would not shorten at all, would not contract in obedience to your will.  What does this show? It proves that when you will to bend your arm, something passes along the nerves going to the biceps muscle, which something causes that muscle to contract? The nerve, then, is a bridge between your will and the muscle--so that when the bridge is broken or cut away, the will cannot get to the muscle.  If anywhere between the muscle and the spinal cord you cut the nerve which goes, or branches from which go, to the muscle, you destroy the communication between the will and the muscle.  The spinal cord, as we have seen, is a mass of nervous substance continuous with the brain; from the spinal cord nearly all the nerves of the body are given off; those nerves whose branches go to the biceps muscle in the arm leave the spinal cord somewhere in the neck.  If you had the misfortune to have your spinal cord cut across or injured in your neck, you might still live, but you would be paralysed. You might will to bend the arm, but you could not do it. You would know you were willing, you would feel you were making an effort, but the effort would be unavailing. The spinal cord is"]]]
