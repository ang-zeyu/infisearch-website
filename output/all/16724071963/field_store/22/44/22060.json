True, she had hoped today, on this second expedition, to recover the lost wash, but to get to that big tree, and relieve the gnawing anxiety, was her first determination; dead or alive she must have a look at the tramp! Nothing could be worse than this awful uncertainty!  \"That's the grove over there! See the big straight tree! That's my tree!\" she exclaimed, dragging along the erstwhile brave Benny, who just now showed an inclination to come to a full stop. \"Come on, Benny, hold on to me. I'll peek first, from the other big tree back of the ivy stump. Then we can see without being seen.\"  Like a pair of chipmunks they hopped from tree to tree, being careful to keep well in the shadow of one before risking a new position behind another.  \"Just like shadow tag,\" Benny made chance to whisper. \"Gee, Sis, this is some little scouting.\"  \"Better than your Boy Scouts' games, isn't it, Benny?\" Grace apologized, for indeed it was no easy matter to inveigle the big boy into a little girl's sport. Benny felt much bigger, and decidedly more mature than Grace--that is, he felt that way.  \"Oh, Ben, see!\" exclaimed the sister. \"There's something flying-over--maybe over a grave!\"  \"Swell chance he had to--make--his own grave!\" in contemptuous tones from Benny.  \"Well--it is a red flag, flying over something!\" Grace whispered emphatically.  Benny sprang out from his tree and with one hand on the automatic-loaded water pistol, and the other on the lead-loaded pop gun, he confronted the hypothetical grave!  \"Come on out, Sis,\" he invited the frightened Grace. \"It isn't no grave. It's just a red handkerchief on a stick.\"  Glancing furtively in the direction of the road, which ran parallel with the river path, and near enough to it to carry a voice from the woods to the road should emergency demand outcry, Grace stepped very gingerly out from her hiding into the open space in front of the famous \"inhabited\" tree.  Yes, there was the red flag! \"Wasn't that a signal for war? The flag was a red handkerchief, and it swayed from a stick cut from a variegated birch.  \"Oh!\" sighed Grace, relief and excitement finding an outlet in that short syllable.  \"Look at the signal!\" called Benny, now going straight up boldly to the flag of fury. \"See, it's a wig-wag, pointing to that big rock. Let's look!\" and he followed the pointing stick which, tied to the top of the improvised flagpole plainly meant--due west--to any one who understood the scout wig-wag code. \"Here!\" shouted Benny, now casting caution to the light winds of murmuring pines. \"Here's more trail. See? It's our secret code of turned over sliver leaves, and it leads to--let's see.\" Benny was visibly excited and Grace was almost pulling him down from the rock in her eagerness to follow the signs. He turned over a rock which showed loose soil, and dried leaves clinging to its jagged sides. \"Here it is, Grace! Sure enough! Here is a letter from your dead tramp. Maybe he died right after he wrote it,\" and even the small boy found humor in the queer uncanny situation.  \"Take it out by the roadway,\" suggested Grace, to whom the woods were now a little treacherous. She glared at as many trees as two brown eyes could embrace. \"We can read it out under the big maple. Come on, Benny,\" she begged, dragging him forth again away from all the woodland mysteries.     CHAPTER VIII  CLUE TO THE MISSING   So many and such exciting sequels are divulged through helpless little letters! How innocently the page of paper carries the silent words, yet how powerful is the influence to cheer or sadden!  Grace had read her mystic letter, but beyond confiding in Benny, whose word of honor in secrecy she had exacted, not one single syllable of that note was to be divulged to any one.  She had hopes that something really wonderful would develop from her remarkable experience, and while she would have liked to tell Madaline and Cleo, she feared antagonistic opinions, and, as it was entirely her own personal secret, and not a matter of girl scout business, or even chums' interest, it seemed decidedly better to keep her own precious counsel.  \"I'll tell them all when it happens!\" she assured herself, by no means being certain just what she hoped \"would happen.\"  So the mystic letter was tucked away in the tiny, pink silk vanity bag, which Cleo had given Grace the Christmas before, and in the days following only her starry eyes threatened to betray the interesting fact, that the little Tenderfoot harbored a dark, delicious secret.  Meanwhile Rose had taken her place in the Franklin mill and was being cared for by the benevolent Mrs. Cosgrove as a member of her family.  \"It was really providential,\" Molly told her mother one day at lunch, after having seen for the second time the parents of Dagmar Brodix, \"for the family had to leave Pennsylvania, and it would have been very hard for them to take Rose along. It seems Mr. Brodix would not join the union, and both he and his wife had to be discharged to appease the labor men. Rose, too, would have been ordered out, as the whole family come under the ban imposed on the father.\"  \"Poor folks!\" deplored Mrs. Cosgrove. \"Those unions won't let anybody think for themselves! Where are they going?\"  \"Away down east to a big silk mill,\" replied the daughter. \"Mr. Brodix knew the superintendent in his own country, and got in the shop without a union card. But it is much better for Rose to stay with us until they get settled at least.\"  \"I took such a fancy to that child the moment I set eyes on her!\" Mrs. Cosgrove explained to Molly.  \"You always do, Mumsey!\" laughed the daughter, \"but I entirely agree with you this time. Where is Rose now?\"  \"Just gone to the post-office. She came in at twelve and finished her dinner in time for a bit of fresh air before going back. How is she getting on in her work?\"  \"First rate, the forelady reports. Rose is naturally quiet, and as you predict, Mother, it is very important for her to be among new companions. A girl's pretty face is not always a help to her best interests.\"  \"Exactly, Molly. Everybody seems to pick on a pretty girl, while they leave the homely ones to tend their own business. But your dad is much worried about that other damsel who got away. There is no trace of her at all.\"  \"Yes, she made a clear escape. I heard one of the mill detectives making some inquiries. He did not have to question Rose. I gave him our end of it. I am afraid that other girl has gotten herself into more trouble. The detective did not say so outright, but I judged so from his line of questions.\"  \"Your father said as much, but like the detective, our own 'cop' isn't giving us all the information he holds. I'm glad the mill officials see the value of the girl scout movement. It's the only fair way to reach the girls without forcing them. Let them take a hand in their own interest--I always say.\"  \"The mill men see the wisdom of that. I would not have been engaged as a welfare worker if I had not been a scout lieutenant. Well, I must run along. We have a meeting in Flosston tonight, and I am going to take Rose with me.\"  \"I would. The girls of the troop have never met her to know her, and, at any rate, their training will check any possible criticism. Good-bye, girl. Better take your umbrella. We will have rain before sunset,\" and with this word mother and daughter separated for their respective afternoon tasks.  Meanwhile Rose had called at the post-office. Her anxiety concerning the wayward Tessie constituted the one flaw in her otherwise happy new days. That she could not at once be with her parents was clear and reasonable to the girl, reared in hardship, and accustomed to many personal sacrifices, but that an incriminating letter would surely one day come from Tessie kept her nervously anxious.  Rose had contrived to visit the post-office daily, hoping when the dreaded, yet longed-for, letter would come, she might receive it personally and thus avert possible complications with the Cosgrove family, who had official reasons for wishing to locate the runaway girl.  With that keenness peculiar to foreigners when a matter vitally concerns them, the Brodix people had readily adopted the more useful name Dixon for their daughter, and today, when Rose inquired for mail, a much-soiled letter addressed to \"Rose Dixon, care of Mrs. James Cosgrove,\" was handed out.  Not risking the publicity of opening the envelope until she was well out of sight of observers, Rose hurried along, and turned an unnecessary corner to seclude herself in a particularly quiet street, there to open and read the letter. Somehow she felt it would contain news of Tessie, and her premonition was correct.  \"From mother!\" she breathed affectionately, as the much handled little sheet of note paper, with its queer foreign script, lay in her hand. Then she noticed an inclosure. Yes! There was the note from Tessie!  So anxious was Rose to know where Tessie was, she glimpsed through the little note without actually reading one word of it. She was just looking for a clue as to the girl's whereabouts, but to her disappointment none was given! Not one word showed the capital letter at its face, that would have marked the name of any place! Tessie wrote English well enough to make herself understood, and the brief note was almost explosive in its choice of strong phrases. The \"quarter whistle\" blew, announcing to Rose the fact that fifteen minutes of the precious noon hour still remained, and as ten would be ample time for her to reach the mill, in the five extra minutes she might read her letters.  Stopping at a little stone wall, which surrounded one of the oldest houses in Franklin, Rose read first the note from Tessie. As she expected, the \"news\" was more a compilation of strong slang than an attempt to impart any real information, and although but a short time removed from the acute influence of \""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5264"],["title","Patty's Butterfly Days (#0)"],["body","PATTY'S BUTTERFLY DAYS  BY  CAROLYN WELLS   Author of  The Patty Books, The Marjorie Books, etc     Illustrations by Martin Lewis     CONTENTS  CHAPTER     I   DIFFERENT OPINIONS     II   MONA'S PLAN    III   SUSAN TO THE RESCUE     IV   A PERFECTLY GOOD CHAPERON      V   A DINNER PARTY     VI   AUNT ADELAIDE    VII   A GARDEN PARTY   VIII   THE HOUSE PARTY ARRIVES     IX   BIG BILL FARNSWORTH      X   JUST A SHORT SPIN     XI   THE WORST STORM EVER!

I'm quite ready and willing to go to the White Mountains,--or the Blue or Pink or even Lavender Mountains, if you like.\"  \"You're willing, Patty, only because you're so good-natured and unselfish; but, really, you don't want to go one bit.\"  \"Now, Nan, I'm no poor, pale martyr, with a halo roundy-bout me noble brow. When we came down here to Spring Beach, it was understood that we were to stay here part of the summer, and then go to the mountains. And now it's the first of August and I've had my innings, so it's only fair you should have your outing.\"  Though Patty's air was gay and careless, and Patty's tones were sincere, she was in reality making an heroic self-sacrifice, and Nan knew it. Patty loved the seashore; she had been there three months, and loved it better every day.  But Nan cared more for the mountains, and longed to get away from the sunny glare of the sea, and enjoy the shaded walks and drives of higher altitudes. However, these two were of unselfish nature, and each wanted to please the other. But as Patty had had her wish for three months, it was certainly fair that Nan should be humoured for the rest of the summer.  The season had done wonders for Patty, physically. Because of her outdoor life, she had grown plumper and browner, her muscles had strengthened, and her rosy cheeks betokened a perfect state of health. She was still slender, and her willowy figure had gained soft curves without losing its dainty gracefulness.  And Patty was still enthusiastically devoted to her motor-car. Indeed, it was the realisation that she must leave that behind that made her so opposed to a trip to the mountains.  Mr. Fairfield and Nan had both dilated on the charms and beauties of mountain scenery, on the joys and delights of the gay mountain hotels, but though Patty listened amiably, she failed to look upon the matter as they did. At first, she had declared her unwillingness to go, and had tried to devise a way by which she might remain at Spring Beach, while her parents went to the mountains. But no plan of chaperons or visiting relatives seemed to satisfy Mr. Fairfield of its availability.  \"I can't see it, Patty,\" he would say; \"there is no chaperon for you that we know of, and I wouldn't leave you here with some stranger obtained by advertisement. Nor have we any relatives who could come to look after you. If Nan's mother could come, that would do beautifully. But Mrs. Allen is in Europe and none of your aunts could leave her own family. No, girlie, I can't see any way to separate our family.\"  So Patty, with her unfailing good nature, had agreed to go to the White Mountains with the others. She admitted, herself, that she'd probably have a good time, as she always did everywhere, but still her heart clung to \"The Pebbles,\" as they called their seashore home, and she silently rebelled when she thought of \"Camilla,\" her swift little electric runabout.  Patty drove her own car, and she never tired of spinning along the shore roads, or inland through the pine groves and laurel jungles. She had become acquainted with many young people, both cottagers and hotel guests, and the outlook for a pleasant summer and fall at Spring Beach was all that could be desired from her point of view. But before they left the city in the spring, Patty had known that Nan preferred mountain localities and had agreed to the seashore house for her sake; so, now, it was Patty's turn to give up her preference for Nan's.  And she was going to do it,--oh, yes,--she was going to do it cheerfully and even gaily. But, though she tried to pretend she didn't care, Nan knew she did care, and she had tried hard to think of some way that Patty might be left behind. Nan would willingly have given up her own desires, and stayed at Spring Beach all summer, but her husband wouldn't hear of it. Mr. Fairfield said that justice demanded a fair division of the season, and already three months had been spent at the seashore, so August and September must be spent in the mountains.  His word was law, and, too, Patty realised the fairness of the plan, and gracefully submitted to Fate. So, as the first of August was in the very near future, Patty and Nan were discussing details of the trip.  \"It almost seems as if you might take your motor-car, Patty,\" said Nan, reflectively.  \"I thought so, too, at first; but father says not. You see, not all mountain roads are modern and well-kept, and, of course, we'll be moving on, now and then, and Camilla IS a nuisance as luggage. Now, Nan, no more suggestions, or regrets, or backward glances. I'm going to the mountains, NOT like the quarry-slave at night, but like a conquering hero; and I shall have all the mountaineers at my feet, overwhelming me with their devoted attentions.\"  \"You probably will, Patty; you're easily the most popular girl at Spring Beach, and if the 'mountaineers' have any taste in such matters--\"  \"There, there, Nan, don't make me blush. I'm 'popular,' as you call it, because I have such a delightful home, and such an attractive stepmother to make it pleasant for my callers! And, by the same token, here are a few of them coming now.\"  Two laughing girls, and a good-looking young man came in at the gate, and strolled along the drive to the veranda, where Patty and Nan sat.  Lora and Beatrice Sayre were of the \"butterfly\" type, and their pale-coloured muslin gowns, broad hats, and fluttering scarfs made the description appropriate. Jack Pennington was just what he looked like, a college youth on his vacation; and his earnest face seemed to betoken a determination to have the most fun possible before he went back to grind at his books.  \"Hello,\" cried Patty, who was not given to dignified forms of salutation.  The trio responded gaily, and coming up on the veranda, selected seats on the wicker chairs, or couches, or the porch railing, as suited their fancy.  \"I say,\" began young Pennington, conversationally, \"we can't let you go away, Patty. Why, week after next we're going to have the Pageant, and there are forty-'leven other pleasant doings before that comes off.\"  \"Yes,\" chimed in Lora Sayre, \"we can't get along without our Pitty-Pat. DO don't go away, Sunshine!\"  \"But suppose I want to go,\" said Patty, bravely trying to treat the subject lightly; \"suppose I'm just crazy to go to that stunning big hotel up in the White Mountains, and have the time of my life!\"  \"Suppose the moon is made of green pumpkins!\" scoffed Jack. \"You don't want to go at all, and you know it! And then, think of the girls,--and boys,--you leave behind you! Your departure is a national calamity. We mourn our loss!\"  \"We do so!\" agreed Beatrice. \"Why, Patty, I'm going to have a house party next week, and we'll have lots of fun going on. Can't you wait over for that?\"  \"No, I can't,\" and Patty spoke a little shortly, for these gay plans made her long more than ever to stay at Spring Beach. \"So don't let's talk any more about me. Tell me about the Pageant,--will it be fine?\"  \"Oh, yes,\" said Jack, \"the biggest thing ever. Sort of like a Durbar, you know, with elephants and--\"  \"No, it isn't going to be like that,\" said Lora. \"They've given up that plan. It's going to be ever so much nicer than that! They're going to have--\"  \"Don't tell me!\" cried Patty, laughing, as she clapped her hands over her ears. \"I'd rather not hear about it! I suppose you'll be queen of it, whatever it is, Lora?\"  \"I'll have a chance at it, if you're not here! That's the only comfort about your going away. Somebody else can be the Belle of Spring Beach for a time.\"  The good-natured laughter in Lora's eyes took all sting from her words, and, indeed, it was an acknowledged fact that Pretty Patty was the belle of the little seashore colony.  \"I'm awfully sorry about it,\" began Nan, but Patty stopped her at once.  \"There's nothing to be sorry about, Madame Nan,\" she cried, gaily; \"these provincial young people don't appreciate the advantages of travel. They'd rather stay here in one place than jog about the country, seeing all sorts of grand scenery and sights! Once I'm away from this place I shall forget all about its petty frolics and its foolish parties.\"  \"Yes, you WILL!\" exclaimed Jack, not at all impressed by Patty's statements, for he knew how untrue they were.  \"And the Country Club summer dance!\" said Beatrice, regretfully. \"Patty, how can you be reconciled to missing that? It's the event of the season! A fancy dance, you know. A sort of Kirmess. Oh, DON'T go away!\"  \"Don't go away!\" echoed Lora, and Jack broke into one of the improvised songs for which he was famous:      \"Don't go away from us, Patty, Patty,        We can't part with the likes of you!      Stay, and be Queen of the Pageant, Patty,        Patty, Patty, tender and true.      Though you are not very pretty, Patty,        Though you are liked by a very few;      We will put up with you, Patty, Patty,--        Patty, Patty, stay with us, do!\"  The rollicking voice and twinkling eyes, which were Jack's chief charms, made Patty laugh outright "]]]
