That she had already forgotten.  \"Well, I’ve got th’ old George Biddick. I’m sure ’e’ll do what I want for’n to do, if Leadville won’t.\"  \"Still that isn’t like seein’ for yerself.\"  \"I shall ’av to take the chance of that,\" but she did not seem happy about it.  She mused with knit brow for some seconds, then changed the subject.  \"Isolda, I’d like for Mrs. Bate to put my bed up in the big room.\"  This—the old Justice Room—occupied one end of the house.  For many years it had been used as a storeroom, but underneath dust and litter lay evidence, in painted panelling and marble mantelpiece, of former state.  \"’Tis a proper old lumber-shop,\" said Mrs. Tom, \"but that doesn’t matter.\"  \"You see,\" explained Sabina, \"I can’t go overstairs.\"  \"I wonder ’ow Leadville’ll like sleepin’ on the ground floor?\"  \"Well, he must like it or lump it.\"  She spoke with the confidence of one whose marriage had been a success. \"We’ll get the room to rights for yer.\"  \"And Isolda, I don’t want to keep on Mrs. Bate, nor I don’t want her Jenifer nor her Janey.\"  \"’Ow’ll ’ee manage then?\"  \"I want some one of my own flesh and blood.  I should love to ’av one of your li’l maids.  Why couldn’t I ’av Gray?  We’ve always ’greed like chickens.\"  \"Well, I don’t know I’m sure.\"  Mrs. Tom had been expecting this, she had even schemed for it.  She had five daughters, pretty maidens all of them, and Gray was the eldest.  What more suitable than that she should fill a daughter’s place at Wastralls?  Nevertheless it would not be wise to jump at the offer.  \"She’s young to go from ’ome.\"  \"Wastralls is only next door and she’ll be all right with me.\"  \"An’ ’as you’ve none of yer own,\" agreed Mrs. Tom, \"Gray’s the nearest.\"  Whatever Sabina’s intentions, however, she would not promise to make the girl her heir.  \"’Twill be for the maid’s good,\" she said vaguely.  \"I’ll see what Tom got to say about it.\"  Gray was eighteen and, with Richbell coming on, could well be spared.  No doubt Mrs. Constantine Rosevear would think Wastralls ought eventually to go to one of her sons; but, in this world, a hen scratched up what she could for her own chicks.  \"Gray think more ’bout ’ome than Richbell,\" Sabina said thoughtfully. \"She’s not after the chaps so much.\"  The mother’s pride was touched.  \"Whenever she go up round the parish, there’s always three or four pairs of eyes lookin’ at Gray.  She can always ’av a chap if she like, but she don’t trouble whether she do or no.\"  \"Is there any special young man, do ’ee think?\"  \"Well now, I don’t care to say...\"  Sabina’s curiosity was aroused.  \"Now Isolda, there’s somethin’ gone on since I come in ’ere.  Who is it?\"  Mrs. Rosevear had spent some of the happiest hours of her life, discussing her children with this trusty friend. \"No stranger,\" she said smilingly.  \"Who then?\"  \"One of your ’inds.\"  The other opened her eyes.  \"My dear life, didn’t she ought to be lookin’ for some one better off?\"  \"She don’t think anything of money.\"  \"They don’t at that age, we got to do that for’m. Who is it then?\"  \"Why, Jim Rosevear, the yard-man.\"  Mrs. Byron knitted her brows in an endeavour to recall the young man’s face.  \"Jim Rosevear?  He come just before my accident.  I can’t think who ’ee is.\"  \"Why, iss you do.  You know, Jack Rosevear of Treketh’s son.\"  \"Jack Rosevear—th’ old chap who’s so contrary?\"  \"That’s of’m.  When he get in a temper, you know, ’ee take off ’is ’at, swing’n around, and fling’n down and stamp on it.\"  \"Oh iss, I know, I remember.\"  She meditated. \"That ’edn’t as bad after all.\"  \"No, ’tedn’t bad, though ’ee’ve quarrelled with’s father.  But Mrs. Andrews over to Gentle Jane is ’is auntie and, as she’s nobody of ’er own and ’er man’s dead, there’s a farm there and Jim’s nothing to do but go in and ’ang up ’is ’at.\"  \"Then what’s ah doin’ at Wastralls?\"  Isolda smiled, that secret smile of the mother.  \"Well, you needn’t ask me that.  Ed’n Wastralls next door to Hember?\"  \"So that’s it, is it?\"  \"There was heaps o’ maidens after ’im, for ’e’s a pretty boy and, at Christmas Tree last New Year, ’e ad some mistletoe in’s cap and they all astin’ for’t; but Gray was the one ’e gived it to.  And that’s ’ow ’e come to you as yard-man.\"  \"And do she think anything ’bout ’im?\"  \"I believe she do, but she don’t go round and tell everybody what she’s doin’.  She’s so meek as a mouse.\"  \"Then tedn’t known?\"  \"You’re the first I’ve told anything to about it.\"  Sabina nodded.  \"Then if Gray comes to me, it’ll hurry matters up?\"  \"Well, I’m very ’greeable for ’er to ’av ’im, ’cos I think ’e’s a nice boy.\"  \"And Gentle Jane is a nice farm and you’ve four other maidens?  Well, I dunno as I shall want to lose ’er as soon as I get ’er, still we can settle that by and by.\"                                   *CHAPTER IV*   A few days, spent in trundling herself about the ward, and Mrs. Byron was ready for the long journey, over Big Hill and down to the sea. Leadville, who saw in her return the extinction of his last hope, had not the heart to come for her.  \"Pretty pickle I should look,\" he said to Mrs. Tom, \"drivin’ missus ’ome sittin’ up in that trolly, showin’ ’erself off like that.  Better fit she should ’av Mr. Brenton’s covered cart and cover ’erself up.  Any one’d think she’d want to ’ide ’er affliction.\"  \"You fancy S’bina ’idin’ of it?\" said Mrs. Tom, who had suggested his going.  \"She’ll be quite proud for people to see ’er goin’ about with ’er poor old stumps. Leavin’ out ’er laigs, you knaw, she’s as strong as ever.\"  When he frowned Byron’s black brows came together in an ominous line. \"Strong as ever?\" he said, \"that’s different from what Dr. Derek told me.  He give me no encouragement as she’ll make old bones.\"  \"I wouldn’t give much for that, then.  She’ll be like a barley weed, always dyin’ and never dead.\"  She had been cleaning the house in readiness for Mrs. Byron’s return; and now, her labours ended, was drinking a cup of tea with the master of it.  \"They old Rosevears was long-livin’ and they do say, she’s more like Old Squire than either Tom or Constantine be.  ’Oo be ’ee gwine send in for ’er?\"  \"Jim can go in for ’er; there is two or three things wanted into Shoppe\"—this was another hamlet in the widespread parish—\"and ’e can bring ’em ’ome.\"  \"I’m sorry you bain’t goin’.  You’re the one ought to fetch ’er.\"  \"I’ve got a very poor ’eart for that sort of thing and this’ll be worse than Hobby-horse goin’ to Traytor.\"  \"Iss,\" nodded Mrs. Tom.  \"I bet everybody’ll turn out to give S’bina a welcome ’ome.  After all, your ways bain’t like our ways.\"  Leadville could not let that pass.  \"I might ’a ’bin born down east o’ Truro, still I can’t tell you whether I was or no.  But I feel in my bones an’ veins that I’m no ’foreigner.’  Couldn’t fancy this place as I do if it wadn’t so.\"  \"’Tis your misfortune,\" said Mrs. Tom, taking her cloak from the door-peg, \"as you fancy it so.  If you was one of we, you’d act different.\"  Mrs. Byron had a bright day for her journey, a day with but one cloud. The staff of the hospital had gathered to see her start and when, on her trolly, and followed by her luggage and a certain long wooden box, oddly suggestive of a shortened coffin, she rolled herself down the hall and into the roadway, they broke into a cheer. The gallant bearing of this mutilated creature had drawn from them an emotional response.  The beauty of it, the poignancy, touched them.  Men pressed forward to offer their help and tears stood in the eyes of the women. That was the spirit, this elemental courage, this defiance of unhappy fate.  Yes, Sabina was indeed true descendant of Old Squire—he to whom men for so long had given their respect.  In the road, drawn up and waiting, stood the farm wagon.  Jim Rosevear, with a proper sense of the ceremonial nature of the occasion, had plaited the horses’ manes and tails with coloured worsteds.  The brass harness twinkled in the sun and the cart-horses had been groomed until their coats were nearly as bright. Sabina, occupied with her trolly, which was showing a tendency to turn a little to the left, was not immediately aware that the driver was not her husband.  Not indeed until the trolly had been lifted to its place on the floor of the wagon and secured by ropes, was she at liberty to look about.  When she saw who was come for her she leaned forward in the cone. \"Where’s the maister to?\" she asked.  Jim, who was getting ready to start, looked over his shoulder.  \"He’s gone fishin’.\"  \"Fishin’?\"  She had thought he might have gone on business down one of the many crooked streets of the little town, business from which he would return in time to drive her home.  \"Fishin’ for bass on the Head.\"  \"Whatever took’n in the ’ead to do that to-day?\" she said and dwelt for a moment on the incomprehensible nature of man.  Strange that Leadville should not want to share her triumph, the triumph of the woman who belonged to him, who was flesh of his flesh; to share this triumph which was, in part, his.  She had been in excellent spirits, but his absence dashed them.  It required the manifested goodwill of the people in the streets to restore her equanimity.  In spite of this drawback, however, her progress was, in its way, royal. Throned in the wagon she passed slowly along the main road.  Placed thus high and with trunk and head emerging from the wicker cone like an amazing flower, she was undoubtedly a queer figure; but the people who came running up the lanes and out of the houses along the route, to give her the blessing of their good wishes, missed the queerness.  They had known her all the forty years of her life.  She was part of the setting in which they played their humble parts.  A little prejudiced in her favour through long association, this display of primitive courage moved them.  They welcomed it as in keeping with the family tradition, as something worthy, and they offered it the kind encouragement of hearty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53370"],["title","Wastralls: A Novel (#8)"],["body","and good words.  \"I be pretty an’ glad to see yer come ’ome again, ma’am.  Terrible, terrible accident, you must ’av ’ad; still you don’t seem to make much of’t.  Mary Elizabeth’s brought ’ee a few lilies.\"  \"That trolly be a clever thought of yours, Mrs. Byron. I never see nothing like it before.\"  \"I reckon you’ve ’ad a draggin’ time, ma’am.  We’m all glad to ’av ’ee back again.\"  \"Do ’ee take and drink up this cup of milk and eat a bit of yeller cake or ’ee’ll be faintin’ before ’ee come to Trevorrick,\" said a farmer’s wife.  \"If ’ee’d like a glass of wine now, you’ve only to say the word, and you can ’av it,\" interposed the landlord of the Dolphin; \"I’d be proud to serve ’ee.\"  \"I be come ’ome,\" said Sabina to her charioteer as they jogged on and her voice had a contented ring. She had forgotten the disappointment of Leadville’s absence.  She was come back to her own people and her own place and she was welcome.  The young man lifted a smiling face and she remembered that this was the ’pretty boy’ who was courting her niece.  She looked at him with interest.  He was certainly good-looking, definitely so, a tall slim youth with a fine profile, deeply-set dark-blue eyes, black hair and a small tawny moustache.  She wondered how the courtship was progressing. Gray, with cloudy hair about a wind-flower face, would make a charming bride. Sabina’s thoughts ran nimbly forward.  She saw the young couple housed at Wastralls, Rosevear working the farm under her direction and the old cradle once more in use.  The prospect promised her an autumn happiness.  Wonderful indeed, the way in which the wind is tempered to the shorn!  When the farm cart turned off the highway by St. Cadic Mill, Sabina found Constantine Rosevear and his wife waiting by the roadside.  The big florid man, though he had wife and three grown sons, had never been able to forget that Sabina was the woman he should have married.  His Betsey was all right but, about Sabina, lingered the glamour of romance.  \"I been in terrible fear,\" he told her simply, \"and I’m ’avin’ holiday to-day.  If you don’t mind I’ll walk down to Wastralls with you.  You don’t know ’ow glad I be to see ye ’ome again and lookin’ so well too.\"  Sabina’s heart beat irregularly for a moment.  If only Leadville would talk to her like this!  She comforted herself with the thought that his being undemonstrative did not mean he was unfeeling.  Words did not come easily to him, but still waters run deep.  The cottagers about the smithy threw more flowers into the cart.  \"Might be May Day,\" as Sabina said, with her happy smile.  At Hember, Tom Rosevear was waiting with four of his daughters.  \"Mother’s down to Wastralls wi’ Gray,\" he said and the blooming girls, the so-called nieces, raised their young voices in affectionate greeting.  ’Aunt S’bina’ had been the fairy godmother of the family, always willing to abet them in any piece of innocent fun.  They were sincerely glad to have her back.  The drive had been long for one just out of hospital, but the kindliness of friends and neighbours had proved a stimulant.  When the wagon turned into the yard of Wastralls, however, Sabina was almost too tired to note the changes that had been made.  The absence of the honeysuckle caused the porch to look bare, the old sheepdog was no longer lying in the sun; but Leadville had come back from the fishing and was ready to lift her down.  At sight of him the tired face brightened.  \"I’m glad to come ’ome again,\" she said.  The man had been standing idly by the door.  Having drawn nothing out of the sea he had come back in a mood which was not uninfluenced by his lack of success. Everything had gone wrong, his hopes were dashed, his plans had miscarried and he searched the landscape in vain for any hope of change.  Sabina was well again, she had already asserted her will with regard to the farm and before him lay a future as dreary as the past.  He lifted his eyes as the beflowered cortège rolled into the yard.  He had expected a sort of chair and the trolly with its basket-work cone was an unpleasant surprise; while the sight of his wife, in brightly coloured gown and pink sunbonnet, swelling out of it like a monstrous fruit, completed his dismay.  She was a figure of fun, a queer oddity, repellent as something out of nature.  The bravery that faced the sunshine as simply as in the days of its strength did not appeal to him, he was only conscious of the deformity.  His heart contracted, emptied itself of good-will, then slowly filled again—but not with kindliness.  The business of unloading occupied the men for some minutes and Mrs. Rosevear, taking the parcels, handed them to her daughter.  \"What a lovely lot o’ flowers.  I should think every garden for miles round will be bare.\"  \"Take care o’ that box,\" cried Sabina, suddenly, as they lifted out the case that was suggestive of a coffin. \"I value that.\"  \"Where be ’ee gwine put it, auntie?\"  \"In the cupboard in the big parlour.\"  \"What ’av ’ee got in it?\"  \"Ah, my dear, ask me no questions and I tell ’ee no lies.\"  \"’Ere, I’ll take that,\" said Mrs. Tom, intervening, \"I know where it got to be put.  ’Tis what you told me of, S’bina?\"  Mrs. Byron nodded.  \"Iss, I’ve brought it back wi’ me.  Doctor said I was maäze to do it; but I said I would, an’ I ’av.\"  A meal was ready on the kitchen table, a piece of stout wood which had weathered the use and elbow-grease of more than a century.  This room had been for three generations the gathering-place of the family. Innumerable savoury meals had been cooked on the slab range; hams in a succession longer than that of the Kings of England had been lifted from the rafter hooks and, after the buffetings of winter and the scorch of summer, men had taken their ease on the bench while women made and mended.  Old tales had been told and retold by deep voices, tales of witches, of wreckers, of people ’pisky-led’n’; and the sound of them lingered in the dim corners.  They were waiting for the new generation which should utter once more the familiar words and keep alive the traditions.  \"I never thought I should ever be back ’ere any more,\" said Sabina, contentedly, as she ran her trolly up to the table and, by a contrivance similar to that on a dentist’s chair, reduced her height to a sitting level. \"It do seem good to be ’ome.  Everything look so natural.\"  \"Well, ’twould be funny if it didn’t,\" said Mrs. Rosevear, helping the meat.  \"Don’t seem as if I’d been all that time away.\"  \"I expect it do to Leadville.\"  His wife turned to him.  \"What do ’ee think of my invention?\"  \"I can’t abide it,\" said the man, with the emphasis of sincere feeling.  The others looked at him in surprise.  \"I’ll always be thinking of what you was,\" he added hastily.  Sabina’s face clouded, but only for a moment.  \"Let’s make the best of things,\" she said.  \"I’m goin’ to forget about them times, I’m goin’ to live for the moment.\"  \"I’m not one as forgets,\" said Leadville heavily.  Revived by food and rest Sabina was soon impatient to begin a further progress.  She trundled herself into the linhay to inspect the milk and butter; then into the two seldom-used rooms known as the Big and Little Parlour.  Beyond them lay the wide shallow stairs, the door into the front part of the house and the long Justice Room.  Mrs. Tom threw open the door of this and Sabina, pushing the trolly in, uttered an exclamation of pleasure. The litter of agricultural implements, broken harness, bags and boxes, had been cleared away, the grates had been blacked and the panelled wall painted a shadowy grey. Between the two fireplaces stood a large bed, the posts of which were carved with corn, fruit and other emblems of fertility.  On it lay a patchwork quilt, the work of Sabina’s grandmother.  Drift-wood fires flamed under the white marble mantelpieces and the coverlet shone with the glistening silks of other days.  The spacious room with its white-hung bed and its white curtains, smelt of the sea and Sabina turned and smiled at her husband.  \"’Av you moved your clothes down?\" she asked.  \"Not that I know of.\"  \"Well, you better make ’aste an’ do’t.\"  Looking past her into the beautiful room he thought dimly that it was too large.  \"I shent like it down ’ere,\" he said and something ancestral moved in him, assuring him that the upper parts of a house, the upper branches, were secure from the marauding enemy, the terror by night. \"Never sleeped on the ground-floor.\"  Laying a hand affectionately on his shoulder, the woman looked into his face with a touch of softening and appeal. Surely he would not leave her to sleep there alone?  To the man, this light touch was illuminating.  \"Oh, leave’n go,\" he muttered.  In the bedroom, Gray Rosevear was moving deftly to and fro, unpacking Sabina’s clothes and laying them in the drawers of the tall-boy.  The man’s eyes followed her light figure, at first unconsciously, but before long with a strange quickening of emotion.  If it had been this girl who was asking him, he would have given up his eyrie with an eager willingness.  He did not understand himself.  What was Gray to him?  His wife’s voice when she spoke again, seemed a whisper from far away. \"I can’t go overstairs,\" she said pleadingly.  Byron turned his eyes deliberately from Gray’s wildflower grace to the thick shortened figure in the trolly and his incipient repugnance grew. Sleep with this deformity?  He could not bring himself to it.  To live in the same house with her would be difficult; at least he would shut her out of his nights.  Already he knew instinctively what those nights, moon-silvered, star-set, nights not of bitter brooding but of dreams, would be to him.  \"I can’t sleep ’ere.\"  Sabina sighed.  The people had given her the froth of sweet words but this was reality.  \"Well, my dear, I can’t ’elp it,\" she said resignedly.  \"I can’t do much nowadays.\"  \"Ah now, if ’ee’d only reckernize that.\"  The touch of opposition was a spur.  \"Still there’s a "]]]
