They may not reach the readers, at a distance, promptly, on account of delays in transportation.     THE EAGLE SERIES  Principally Copyrights      Elegant Colored Covers  \"THE RIGHT BOOKS AT THE RIGHT PRICE\"   While the books in the New Eagle Series are undoubtedly better value, being bigger books, the stories offered to the public in this line must not be underestimated. There are over four hundred copyrighted books by famous authors, which cannot be had in any other line. No other publisher in the world has a line that contains so many different titles, nor can any publisher ever hope to secure books that will match those in the Eagle Series in quality.  This is the pioneer line of copyrighted novels, and that it has struck popular fancy just right is proven by the fact that for fifteen years it has been the first choice of American readers. The only reason that we can afford to give such excellent reading at such a low price is that our unlimited capital and great organization enable us to manufacture books more cheaply and to sell more of them without expensive advertising, than any other publishers.    ALL TITLES ALWAYS IN PRINT   TO THE PUBLIC:--These books are sold by news dealers everywhere. If  your dealer does not keep them, and will not get them for you, send  direct to the publishers, in which case four cents must be added to  the price per copy to cover postage.      3--The Love of Violet Lee                      By Julia Edwards     4--For a Woman's Honor                        By Bertha M.
