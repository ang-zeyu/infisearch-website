Thirty years ago I should have been obliged to offer you wine, also, but happily that is no longer necessary. Forty years ago,--hum, ha! If you will permit me, I will smoke a cheroot for the party. Your father prefers a pipe, I believe, but give me a Manilla cheroot, and I am satisfied.\"  \"Excuse me, sir,\" said Gerald, \"but weren't you going to say something else?\"  Colonel Ferrers smiled. \"You are quick, my boy,\" he said. \"I was indeed thinking of something that happened forty years ago,--of my first smoke. Possibly you might be amused to hear about it?\"  The boys seemed to think there was no doubt about their being amused; they drew up two ottomans beside the Colonel's armchair, and prepared to listen, open-mouthed.  \"Forty years ago, then,\" said the Colonel, \"or, to be more exact, forty-five years, I was a lad of fifteen.\"  He paused, and smoked in silence for some minutes. Gerald could not help thinking of Alice and the Mock Turtle, and wondered what would happen if he should get up and say, \"Thank you, sir, for your interesting story.\" But he held his peace, and waited.  \"Fifteen years old, young gentlemen, and a sad scapegrace, I am sorry to say. My poor mother had an anxious time of it with me. I was in the water, or in the fire, or in the clouds from morning till night, as it seems on looking back. But with all my vagaries, I had one great desire which had never been gratified,--that was, to smoke a cigar. My father was a clergyman, and though he had never forbidden my smoking, I should never have dared to suggest such a thing to him, for he was strict in his notions, in many ways. Not too strict, sir, not too strict, by any means, though he may have seemed so to me then.  \"To make a long story short, I fell in with some lads of my own way of thinking, and we determined to have a smoke. We gathered sweet fern and dried it, and rolled cigars for ourselves; odd-looking things they were, but we were vastly proud of them. When all was ready, we chose a dry, warm spot behind a dyke (for it was the fall of the year, and the days growing cold), and there we lighted our cigars and fell to work, puffing away in mighty fine style. Well, sir, they were horrible things, as you may well imagine; not one of us, I'll go bail, liked them in his heart, but we all pretended our best, and praised the cigars, and said what a fine thing it was to smoke, and thought ourselves men, as sure as if we had felt our beards pushing.  \"By-and-by--I have the feeling of it still, when I think of it--I chanced to look up, and saw my father standing over the top of the dyke, looking down on us. The other boys, catching sight of my face, lifted their eyes and saw him, too; and there was a pretty moment. He said never a word for some time; no more did we. At last, 'What are you smoking, boys?' he asked, speaking in his usual even voice; yet I did not like the sound of it, somehow.  \"So we told him, sweet fern; but he shook his head at that. 'That is poor stuff, indeed,' he said. 'Now, if you must smoke, here is something worth your while. Take these, Thomas, and share them with your friends; they are genuine, and I hope you may enjoy them.'  \"With that he took a parcel of cigars from his pocket, and handed them to me; then bowed to us all very grand, and marched off, never looking behind him.  \"I was not comfortable in my mind at this, for I knew my father pretty well, and had looked for something different; but the other lads were in high feather, and lighted their cigars on the instant, bidding me do likewise, and crying out that my father was a fine old buck, and that I was a lucky fellow to have such a parent. I could not be behind the rest, so I lit up, too, and for a few minutes all was as gay as a feast. But, Harry Monmouth, sir! in half an hour we were the sickest boys in Westchester County. It was all we could do to crawl home to our beds; and not one of us but was sure he was dying, and cried to his mother to send for the doctor before it was too late.\"  The Colonel laughed heartily, the boys chiming in with a merry peal.  \"What were the cigars?\" asked Phil.  \"The strongest Havanas that were made,--that was all. Fine cigars, I have no doubt; but I was forty years old before I touched tobacco again, and I have never smoked anything less delicate than a Manilla.\"  He puffed in silence, chuckling to himself now and then; the boys meditated on the tale they had heard.  \"Colonel Ferrers,\" said Gerald, at last.  \"Yes, my boy. You are thinking that it is time to join the ladies? Quite right; we will go in at once.\"  \"I wanted to ask,\" said Gerald, \"if you don't mind telling us, that is--well--I was only thinking that perhaps those cigars you offered us--were they very mild ones, Colonel Ferrers?\"  The Colonel looked grave for a moment, then he gave way and laughed aloud.  \"Found me out, hey?\" he said. \"Well, since you ask me, Master Merryweather, I believe they were--not--the mildest that are made. But you--hark! what was that?\"  From the next room came the sound of a crash, and then a cry.  \"I am very sorry, sir,\" said the boys in a breath. \"It is probably our sister Gertrude, who has broken something.\"  \"She has no fingers to her thumbs,\" added Gerald, \"and the result is destruction.\"  They passed into the next room, and found that there had indeed been an accident. Gertrude had knocked down a great pink vase, and broken it into fifty pieces; she had also fallen over it, and now sat among the ruins on the floor, too frightened to cry, while the others picked up the pieces as best they might.  \"Colonel Ferrers, what will you think of us?\" cried Mrs. Merryweather, looking up as her host entered the room. \"This unlucky child of mine has done something dreadful. Get up, Gerty, and let me get the pieces from under you. I do so hope it may be mended.\"  \"Heaven forefend,\" said Colonel Ferrers, hastily. \"Is it--I can hardly hope it--is it truly the pink vase, the pink vase with the stag's head on it?\"  \"Ye--yes!\" sobbed poor Gertrude, getting up from the floor, and seeking vainly for her handkerchief. \"Oh, I am so sorry!\"  \"My dear child,\" cried the Colonel, and he took Gertrude by both hands, \"my dear young benefactress, how can I ever thank you! You have relieved me of a heavy burden.\"  \"Why? what?\" cried all.  The Colonel pointed to the broken china, and gave a great sigh of relief. \"You behold there,\" he said, \"now happily in fragments, the bane of my existence. That--that horror--was given me three years ago by a valued servant and friend, my man Guiseppe. He bought it for my birthday; spent ten of his hard-earned dollars on it, foolish, faithful creature that he is. What could I do? It was,--the enormity you perceive. I was obliged to give it a place of honour,--fortunately, I seldom use this room when I am alone; I was forced to praise its tint, which I abominate, and its shape, which is wholly detestable. What would you? I could not wound my good Guiseppe; the vase has remained, the chief ornament--in his eyes--of my drawing-room. Now, thanks to you, my charming child, I am delivered of this encumbrance, and my poor white and gold can appear without this hideous blot on its purity.\"  Gertrude wiped her eyes, much relieved at this novel view of her infirmity, and all the others laughed heartily.  \"And now,\" said the good Colonel, \"is it not time for some games, Hilda, or something of the kind? Command me, young people. Shall I be blind man, at your service?\"  It was a pleasant sight to see the Colonel, a silk handkerchief tied over his eyes, chasing the young folks hither and thither; pulled this way, twitched that, but always beaming under his bandage, and shouting with merriment. It was a pleasanter sight, later in the evening, to see him leading out Hildegarde for a quadrille, and taking his place at the head of the figure with stately, old-fashioned grace. Mrs. Grahame, turning round a moment from her place at the piano, saw his fine face aglow with pleasure, and felt a corresponding warmth at her own heart. She thought of the gloomy, solitary man he had been a year ago, living alone with his servants, scarcely seeing or speaking to a soul outside his own grounds. And who shall blame the mother for saying in her heart, with a little thrill of pride, \"It was my child who helped him, who brought the sunshine into this good man's life. It was my Hildegarde!\"     CHAPTER VI.  ANOTHER TEA-PARTY.   It was the very day after the great affair at Roseholme that Hildegarde had her own tea-party; in fact, it had been planned for the birthday itself, and had only been postponed when Colonel Ferrers made known his kind wish. This was a piazza party. The broad, out-door room was hung with roses,--some of the very garlands which had graced the dark walls of Roseholme the night before; but here they were twined in and out of the vines which grew on all sides of the piazza, screening it from outside view, and making it truly a bower and a retreat. The guests had been asked to come at five o'clock, but it was not more than three when Hildegarde, coming to the door by chance, saw two or three little figures hanging about the gate, gazing wistfully in. At sight of her, their heads went down and their fingers went into their mouths; they studied the ground, and appeared to know neither where they were, nor why they had come.  \"Euleta!\" exclaimed Hildegarde; \"is that you, child? and Minnie and Katie, too. Why, you are here in good time, aren't you?\"  She ran down and took the children by the hand, and led them up to the piazza. \"I am very glad to see you, chicks,\" she said. \"Shall we take off the hats? Perhaps we will leave them on for a little,\" she added, quickly, seeing a shade of distress on Euleta's face; \"they look so--gay and bright, and we might want to walk about the garden, you see.\"  Euleta beamed again, and the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5259"],["title","Hildegarde's Neighbors (#8)"],["body","with her. They were sisters, and their careful mother had given them hats just alike, dreadful mysteries of magenta roses and apple-green ribbon. Their pride was pleasant to see, and Hildegarde smiled back at them, saying to herself that the dear little faces would look charming in anything, however, hideous.  Soon more children came, and yet more: Vesta Philbrook and Martha Skeat, Philena Tabb and Susan Aurora Bulger,--twelve children in all, and every child there before the stroke of four.  \"Well,\" said Hildegarde to herself, \"the tea-table will not be quite so pretty as if I had had time to make the wreaths; but they would rather play than have wreaths, and I should not have left it till the last hour, sinner that I am.\" She proposed \"Little Sally Waters,\" and they all fell to it with ardour.        \"Oh, little Sally Waters, sitting in the sun,      Crying, weeping, for your young man;      Rise, Sally, rise, wipe your weeping eyes,\" etc.  Martha Skeat was the first Sally; she chose Susan Aurora, and Susan Aurora chose Hildegarde. Down went Hildegarde on the floor, and wept and wrung her hands so dramatically that the children paused in alarm, fearing that some real calamity had occurred.  \"Oh! oh!\" moaned Hildegarde; \"my young man! Go on, children. Why are you stopping? Oh, where IS my young man?\" she sobbed; and the children, reassured by a twinkling smile, shrieked with delight. \"What shall I do?\" sobbed the girl. \"I--haven't--got--any young man! Now, children, you MUST say 'Rise, Sally,' or my foot will be sound asleep, and then I couldn't get up at all, and what would become of your supper?\"  Aghast at this suggestion, the children began to chant, hastily,--        \"Rise, Sally, rise,      Wipe your weeping eyes;      Turn to the east,      Turn to the west,      Turn to the one that you love the best!\"  Hildegarde sprang to her feet, whirled to the east, with her hands clasped in entreaty; turned to the west, holding out her arms with a gesture of intense longing; turned to the south,--and saw a stranger standing and gazing at her with a look of intense amusement.  For once Hildegarde thought that her wits were gone; she stood still, her arms dropped to her side, and she returned the stranger's gaze with a look of such simple, absolute dismay that he could hardly keep his countenance. Hastily advancing, he lifted his hat. \"Miss Grahame,\" he said, \"I beg your pardon for breaking in in this way. My sister--I am Roger Merryweather, I ought to say first--Bell wanted to know at what time she should come over, and as none of the boys were at hand, I ventured to come over with the message.\"  His eyes,--they were kind eyes, as Hildegarde noticed in her distress,--his eyes seemed to say, \"I wish you would not mind me in the least, my child! Have I not sisters of my own, and don't I know all about Sally Waters?\" It almost seemed as if the words were spoken, and Hildegarde recovered her composure, and came forward, with a burning blush, it is true, but holding out her hand with her own sweet cordiality.  \"I am very glad to see you, Mr. Merryweather. You are very good not to laugh at poor Sally's distresses. Tell Bell that the children are all here, and the sooner she comes the better. But--will you not come in, Mr. Merryweather? My mother will be delighted to see you. We have heard so much of you from all the children.\"  Roger Merryweather excused himself on the ground of letters that must be written, but promised himself the pleasure of an early call; and so, with another kind, sensible look, and a smile and a friendly word to the children, he withdrew, and Hildegarde saw him leap lightly over the fence,--a tall, well-knit figure, springy and light as Gerald's own.  The girl drew a long breath of dismay, but it quavered, and finally ended in a hearty laugh.  \"And how PERFECTLY he behaved!\" she said aloud. \"If one had to make a spectacle of one's self,--and apparently it is to be my fate through life,--surely no one could choose a kinder looking spectator.\"  Here she became aware of the children, standing at gaze, and evidently waiting for her next word.  \"Why, what am I thinking about?\" she cried, merrily. \"Do you think we have had enough of 'Sally,' children? I--I think perhaps I have. And what shall we play next? I fear it is too hot still for 'I Spy;' we must keep that till after tea. What are you saying, Martha? Speak out, dear, and don't be afraid to say just what you would like best. This is your own party, you see, and it is to be the kind of party you all think pleasantest.\"  Martha murmured inaudibly several times, but spurred by digs in the ribs with several pairs of sharp elbows, finally spoke aloud with a sudden yelp. \"Oh, PLEASE!--Susan Aurora Bulger, I'll go right and tell your mother this minute!--please, 'The Highland Gates to Die.'\"  \"What?\" asked Hildegarde, in amazement. \"Say it again, Martha, please. The Highland--what?\"  \"Gates to Die!\" said Martha Skeat, and all the children took up the chorus. \"'The Highland Gates to Die,' please, Teacher!\"  Hildegarde repeated the words to herself, but no light came. \"I don't understand,\" she said. \"You will have to show me how to play, for I never heard of the game. Highland Gates--well, I shall learn it quickly, I hope. Euleta, will you take the lead?\"  Euleta, a sheep-faced child, with six whitey-brown pigtails, motioned to the others, who at once joined hands in a circle. Then she began to pace slowly round the circle, and all the children broke out into a wild chant:      \"Go round and round the level,      Go round and round the level,      Go round and round the level,      The Highland Gates to die.\"  Now the arms were lifted, and the leader wove her mystic paces in and out among the children, while the words changed.        \"Go in and out the window,      Go in and out the window,      Go in and out the window,      The Highland Gates to die.\"  Euleta took Vesta Philbrook by the hand, led her into the circle, and knelt solemnly before her; and the others sang, wildly,--      \"Kneel down and face your lover,      Kneel down and face your lover,      Kneel down and face your lover,      The Highland Gates to die.\"  \"What ARE, you playing?\" cried Bell Merryweather, who had come in quietly, and was watching the proceedings in amazement.  \"Don't ask me!\" Hildegarde replied, \"watch and listen, and learn if you can. Oh, this is tragedy, indeed!\" For Euleta had thrown herself backward, not without a certain dramatic force, and now lay prone at Vesta's feet; and the children chanted, solemnly,--       \"She's dead because she loved him,      She's dead because she loved him,      She's dead because she loved him,      The Highland Gates to die.\"  This ended the game, and the children smiled joyously, while Euleta plumed herself like a little peacock, taking to herself the credit of all the interest shown by the young ladies.  \"But what an extraordinary thing!\" cried Bell; \"Hildegarde, have you an idea what it can mean?\"  Hildegarde shook her head. \"It must be something old,\" she said. \"It must come from some old story or ballad. Oh, if we could only find out!\" They questioned the children eagerly, but could learn nothing. It was merely, \"The Highland Gates to Die,\" and they had always played it, and everybody else always played it,--that was all they knew.  At this moment a well-known brown bonnet was seen bobbing apologetically up the drive; the Widow Lankton had been making frantic efforts to catch Hildegarde's eye, and now succeeding, began a series of crab-like bows.  \"Oh!\" cried Hildegarde, eagerly, \"there is Mrs. Lankton, and she will know all about it.\"  \"Yes,\" chimed in the children, in every variety of shrill treble. \"Widder Lankton, SHE'LL know all about it, sure!\"  Mrs. Lankton was surrounded in a moment, and brought up on the piazza. Here she sat, turning her head from side to side, like a lean and pensive parrot, and struggling to get her breath.  \"It's ketched me!\" she said, faintly, in reply to the girls' questions. \"Miss Grahame, my dear, it's ketched me in my right side, and I like t' ha' died on your thrishold. Yes, my dear,\" she nodded her head many times, and repeated with unction, \"I like t' ha' died on your thrishold.\"  \"Oh, I am so sorry, Mrs. Lankton!\" said Hildegarde, soothingly, while she quieted with a look Bell's horrified anxiety.  \"I think you will be able to go in and get a cup of tea presently, won't you? And that will take away the pain, I hope.\"  Mrs. Lankton's countenance assumed a repressed cheerfulness. \"You may be right, dear!\" she said. \"I shouldn't go to contradict your blessed mother's darter, not if she told me to get a hull supper, let alone a cup o' tea, as is warming to the innards, let him deny it who will. There! I feel it a leetle better now a'ready,\" she announced. \"Ah, it's a blessed privilege you have, Miss Grahame!\"  Without stopping to analyze these remarks too closely, Hildegarde said a few more soothing words, and then went straight to the matter in hand.  \"Mrs. Lankton, can you tell us anything about a game the children have been playing, the game of 'The Highland Gates?' We are very much interested in it, Miss Merryweather and I,--this is Miss Merryweather,--and we want to know what it means.\"  \"To be sure, my dear!\" cried the Widow Lankton. \"'The Highland Gates to Die.' Dear me, yes! if ever a person could tell you--and Miss Bellflower, is it? Ah! she looks rugged, now; don't she? and livin' in the old Shannon house, too. 'T is dretful onhealthy, they say, the Shannon house; but havin' a rugged start, you see, you may weather it a consid'able time, dearie, and be a comfort to them as has you WHILE they has you. My Philena, her cheeks was just like yours, like two pinies. And where is she now? Ah! I've seen trouble, Miss Bellwether. Miss Grahame here can tell you of some of the trouble I've seen, though she don't know not a quarter part of it.\"  \"Oh yes, Mrs. Lankton,\" said Hildegarde, with"]]]
