This girl, Zany by name, resented in accordance with her own ideas and character the principle of repression which dominated the household. She threw a kiss toward the cabin under the trees and shook with silent laughter as she muttered, \"Dat fer you, Chunk. You de beat'nst nigger I eber see. You mos' ez bro'd ez I is high, yit you'se reachin' arter me. I des like ter kill mysef lafin' wen we dance tergeder,\" and she indulged in a jig-step and antics behind Miss Lou's back until she came in sight of the windows, then appeared as if following a hearse.  Miss Lou entered the rear door of the long, two-story house, surrounded on three sides by a wide piazza. Mr. Baron, a stout, bald-headed old gentleman, was fuming up and down the dining-room while his wife sat in grim silence at the foot of the table. It was evident that they had made stiff, old-fashioned toilets, and both looked askance at the flushed face of the almost breathless girl, still in her simple morning costume. Before she could speak her uncle said, severely, \"Since we have waited so long, we will still wait till you can dress.\"  The girl was glad to escape to her room in order that she might have time to frame some excuse before she faced the inquisition in store for her.  Constitutional traits often assert themselves in a manner contrary to the prevailing characteristics of a region. Instead of the easy-going habits of life common to so many of his neighbors, Mr. Baron was a martinet by nature, and the absence of large, engrossing duties permitted his mind to dwell on little things and to exaggerate them out of all proportion. Indeed, it was this utter lack of perspective in his views and judgments which created for Miss Lou half her trouble. The sin of tardiness which she had just committed was treated like a great moral transgression, or rather it was so frowned upon that it were hard to say he could show his displeasure at a more heinous offence. The one thought now in Mr. Baron's mind was that the sacred routine of the day had been broken. Often there are no greater devotees to routine than those who are virtually idlers. Endowed with the gift of persistence rather than with a resolute will, it had become second nature to maintain the daily order of action and thought which he believed to be his right to enforce upon his household. Every one chafed under his inexorable system except his wife. She had married when young, had grown up into it, and supplemented it with a system of her own which took the form of a scrupulous and periodical attention to all little details of housekeeping. There was a constant friction, therefore, between the careless, indolent natures of the slaves and the precise, exacting requirements of both master and mistress. Miss Lou, as she was generally called on the plantation, had grown up into this routine as a flower blooms in a stiff old garden, and no amount of repression, admonition and exhortation, not even in her younger days of punishment, could quench her spirit or benumb her mind. She submitted, she yielded, with varying degrees of grace or reluctance. As she increased in years, her thoughts, as we have seen, were verging more and more on the border of rebellion. But the habit of obedience and submission still had its influence. Moreover, there had been no strong motive and little opportunity for independent action. Hoping not even for tolerance, much less for sympathy, she kept her thoughts to herself, except as she occasionally relieved her mind to her old mammy, Aun' Jinkey.  She came into the dining-room hastily at last, but the expression of her face was impassive and inscrutable. She was received in solemn silence, broken at first only by the long formal grace which Mr. Baron never omitted and never varied. In her rebellious mood the girl thought, \"What a queer God it would be if he were pleased with this old cut-and-dried form of words! All the time uncle's saying them he is thinking how he'll show me his displeasure.\"  Mr. Baron evidently concluded that his best method at first would be an expression of offended dignity, and the meal began in depressing silence, which Mrs. Baron was naturally the first to break. \"It must be evident to you, Louise,\" she said in a thin, monotonous voice, \"that the time has come for you to consider and revise your conduct. The fact that your uncle has been kept waiting for his supper is only one result of an unhappy change which I have observed, but have forborne to speak of in the hope that your own conscience and the influence of your past training would lead you to consider and conform. Think of the precious moments, indeed I may say hours, that you have wasted this afternoon in idle converse with an old negress who is no fit companion for you! You are becoming too old--\"  \"Too old, aunt? Do you at last recognize the fact that I am growing older?\"  With a faint expression of surprise dawning in her impassive face Mrs. Baron continued: \"Yes, old enough to remember yourself and not to be compelled to recognize the duties of approaching womanhood. I truly begin to feel that I must forbid these visits to an old, ignorant and foolish creature whose ideas are totally at variance with all that is proper and right.\"  \"Uncle thinks I have approached womanhood sufficiently near to know something of my business affairs, and even went so far as to suggest his project of marrying me to my cousin in order to unite in sacred--I mean legal bonds the two plantations.\"  The two old people looked at each other, then stared at their niece, who, with hot face, maintained the pretence of eating her supper. \"Truly, Louise,\" began Mr. Baron, solemnly, \"you are indulging in strange and unbecoming language. I have revealed to you your pecuniary affairs, and I have more than once suggested an alliance which is in accordance with our wishes and your interests, in order to prove to you how scrupulous we are in promoting your welfare. We look for grateful recognition and a wise, persistent effort on your part to further our efforts in your behalf.\"  \"It doesn't seem to me wise to talk to a mere child about property and marriage,\" said the girl, breathing quickly in the consciousness of her temerity and her rising spirit of rebellion.  \"You are ceasing to be a mere child,\" resumed her uncle, severely.  \"That cannot be,\" Miss Lou interrupted. \"You and aunt speak to me as you did years ago when I was a child. Can you expect me to have a woman's form and not a woman's mind? Are women told exactly what they must think and do, like little children? Aunt threatens to forbid visits to my old mammy. If I were but five years old she couldn't do more. You speak of marrying me to my cousin as if I had merely the form and appearance of a woman, and no mind or wishes of my own. I have never said I wanted to marry him or any one.\"  \"Why, Louise, you are verging toward flat rebellion,\" gasped her uncle, laying down his knife and fork.  \"Oh, no, uncle! I'm merely growing up. You should have kept the library locked; you should never have had me taught to read, if you expected me to become the mere shell of a woman, having no ideas of my own.\"  \"We wish you to have ideas, and have tried to inculcate right ideas.\"  \"Which means only your ideas, uncle.\"  \"Louise, are you losing your mind?\"  \"No, uncle, I am beginning to find it, and that I have a right to use it. I am willing to pay all due respect and deference to you and to aunt, but I protest against being treated as a child on one hand and as a wax figure which can be stood up and married to anybody on the other. I have patiently borne this treatment as long as I can, and I now reckon the time has come to end it.\"  Mr. Baron was thunderstruck and his wife was feeling for her smelling-bottle. Catching a glimpse of Zany, where she stood open-mouthed in her astonishment, her master said, sternly, \"Leave the room!\" Then he added to his niece, \"Think of your uttering such wild talk before one of our people! Don't you know that my will must be law on this plantation?\"  \"I'm not one of your people,\" responded the girl, haughtily. \"I'm your niece, and a Southern girl who will call no man master.\"  At this moment there was a knock at the door. Without waiting for it to be opened, a tall, lank man entered and said, hastily, \"Mr. Baron, I reckon there's news which yer orter hear toreckly.\" He was the overseer of the plantation.     CHAPTER III  MAD WHATELY   Mr. Baron was one of the few of the landed gentry in the region who was not known by a military title, and he rather prided himself on the fact. \"I'm a man of peace,\" he was accustomed to say, and his neighbors often remarked, \"Yes, Baron is peaceable if he has his own way in everything, but there's no young blood in the county more ready for a fray than he for a lawsuit.\" \"Law and order\" was Mr. Baron's motto, but by these terms he meant the perpetuity of the conditions under which he and his ancestors had thus far lived. To distrust these conditions was the crime of crimes. In his estimation, therefore, a Northern soldier was a monster surpassed only by the out-and-out abolitionist. While it had so happened that, even as a young man, his tastes had been legal rather than military, he regarded the war of secession as more sacred than any conflict of the past, and was willing to make great sacrifices for its maintenance. He had invested all his funds as well as those of his niece in Confederate bonds, and he had annually contributed a large portion of the product of his lands to the support of the army. Living remote from the scenes of actual"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5309"],["title","\"Miss Lou\" (#3)"],["body","trife, he had been able to maintain his illusions and hopes to a far greater extent than many others of like mind with himself; but as the war drew toward its close, even the few newspapers he read were compelled to justify their name in some degree by giving very unpalatable information. As none are so blind as those who will not see, the old man had testily pooh-poohed at what he termed \"temporary reverses,\" and his immunity from disturbance had confirmed his belief that the old order of things could not materially change. True, some of his slaves had disappeared, but he had given one who had been caught such a lesson that the rest had remained quiet if not contented.  The news brought by his overseer became therefore more disturbing than the strange and preposterous conduct of his niece, and he had demanded excitedly, \"What on earth's the matter, Perkins?\"  \"Well, sir, fur's I kin mek out, this very plantation's been p'luted by Yankee soldiers this very evenin'. Yes, sir.\"  \"Great heavens! Perkins,\" and Mr. Baron sprang from his chair, then sank back again with an expression suggesting that if the earth opened next it could not be worse.  \"Yes, sir,\" resumed Perkins, solemnly, \"I drawed that much from Jute. He seen 'em hisself. I noticed a s'pressed 'citement en talk in the quarters this evenin', an' I follered hit right up an' I ast roun' till I pinned Jute. He was over the fur side of the run lookin' fur a stray crow, an' he seen 'em. But they was bein' chased lively. Mad Whately--beg pardon--Mr. Madison was arter them with whip and spur. Didn't yer hear a crack of a rifle? I did, and reckoned it was one o' the Simcoe boys out gunnin', but Jute says hit was one o' our men fired the shot, en that they chased the Yanks to'erds the big woods. They was all mounted en goin' it lickity switch. The thing that sticks in my crop isn't them few what Mr. Madison chased, but the main body they belongs to. Looks as ef there's goin' to be a raid down our way.\"  \"If that is so,\" said Mr. Baron, majestically, \"Lieutenant Whately proves that our brave men are not far off, either, and the way he chased some of them shows how all the vile invaders will eventually be driven out of the country. Be vigilant, Perkins, and let it be understood at the quarters that Lieutenant Whately is within call.\"  The overseer bowed awkwardly and limped away. His lameness had secured him immunity from military duty.  \"Ah, that's a man for you,\" said Mr. Baron, glaring at his niece. \"Your cousin is a true scion of Southern chivalry. That is the kind of a man you do not know whether you wish to marry or not--a brave defender of our hearths and liberties.\"  \"If he wishes to marry me against my will, he's not a defender of my liberty,\" retorted the girl.  \"If you had the spirit which should be your birthright your eyes would flash with joy at the prospect of seeing a hero who could thus chase your enemies from our soil. If you could only have seen him in his headlong--\"  \"I did see him.\"  \"What!\"  \"I saw Cousin Madison leading a dozen or more men in pursuit of half a dozen. That does not strike me as sublimely heroic.\"  \"Why haven't you told me of this? How could you have seen him?\" and the old man, in his strong excitement, rose from his chair.  \"My reception when I entered was not conducive to conversation. I was merely sitting by the run and saw both parties gallop past.\"  \"You should have come instantly to me.\"  \"I'm sure I came in hastily,\" she replied, crimsoning in the consciousness of her secret, \"but I was met as if I had been guilty of something awful.\"  \"Well, if I had known,\" began her uncle, in some confusion, mistaking her color for an expression of anger.  \"I think,\" remarked her aunt, coldly, \"that Louise should have recognized that she had given you just cause for displeasure by her tardiness, unless it were explained, and she should have explained at once. I have no patience with the spirit she is displaying.\"  But Mr. Baron's mind had been diverted to more serious and alarming considerations than what he characterized mentally as \"a girl's tantrum.\"  \"It makes my blood boil,\" he said, \"to think that this Northern scum is actually in our neighborhood, and might be at our doors but for my brave nephew. Thanks to him, they met a righteous reception on this plantation; thanks to him, in all probability, we are not now weltering in our blood, with the roof that shelters us blazing over our heads. If those marauders had found us unprotected, young woman, you would have rued the day. Their capacity for evil is only equalled by their opportunities. If your cousin had not flamed after them like an avenging sword you might have cried loudly enough for the one of whom, in your fit of unseemly petulance, you can speak so slightingly. I advise you to go to your room and thank Heaven for your escape.\"  \"Uncle, are the people of the North savages?\"  \"Its soldiers are worse than savages. Have you not heard me express my opinion of them over and over again? Go to your room, and when you appear again, I trust it will be with the meekness and submission becoming in a young woman.\"  When the girl left Aun' Jinkey's cabin the young soldier looked after her with an expression of deep interest. \"Who is she?\" he asked.  \"Dat's Miss Lou,\" said the old negress, forcing into his mouth another spoonful of her fiery decoction.  \"Oh, that's enough, aunty, unless you wish to burn me out like a hollow log,\" and he struggled to his feet to ease his tendency to strangle. \"Miss Lou? How should I know who she is?\"  \"Ob co'se,\" said Aun' Jinkey, dryly, \"I ain' namin' her pedigree.\"  \"You a Linkum man, ain' you?\" Chunk asked, quickly.  \"Yes, and Lincoln is a good friend of yours.\"  \"Hi! I knows dat. W'at fer you so hidin'-in-de-grass, granny? No use bein' dat away wid a Linkum man.\"  \"I ain' talkin' 'bout my young mistis to folks ez drap down fum de clouds.\"  \"You wouldn't like me better if I came up from below, aunty. There now, I'm not a very bad fellow, and I belong to the army that's going to make you all free.\"  \"I hasn't des tink out dis question ob bein' free yit. I'se too ole to wuk much an' old mars'r's took keer on me long time.\"  \"Well, I'se tink it out,\" put in Chunk, decidedly; \"en I'se able to wuk fer you en me too.\"  \"You mighty peart, Chunk, co'tin' a gal lie a bean-pole a'ready. I reck'n she spen' all you eber mek. You bettah boos' de Linkum man into dat ar lof sud'n, kase ef Marse Perkins cotch 'im yere we all ain' feelin' berry good bimeby.\"  \"Dat ar truer'n preachin',\" admitted Chunk, with alacrity. \"Des you tek hol' ob dem ladder rouns, mars'r, an' put yo' foots on my sho'lers. Dat's hit. Nobody tink ob fin'in' you yere. I'se study how ter git yo' hoss out of sight 'gin mawnin'.\"  \"You stand by me, Chunk,\" said the soldier, \"and you won't be sorry. There's a lot of us coming this way soon, and I can be a good friend of yours and all your people if you help me out of this scrape.\"  \"I'se gwine ter stan' by you, boss. I'se mek up my min' ter be free dis time, sho! Hi! w'at dat?\"  He was wonderfully agile, for his arms were nearly as long as his legs. In an instant he descended, drawing a trap-door after him. Then he sauntered to the door, which he opened wide. A troop of horsemen were coming single file by a path which led near the cabin, and the foremost asked in a voice which the negro recognized as that of Lieutenant Whately, \"Is that you, Chunk?\"  \"Dat's me, mars'r. My 'specs.\"  \"Be off, you skeleton. Make time for the house and help get supper for me and the men. If you don't run like a red deer, I'll ride you down.\"  \"Good Lawd! w'at gwine ter hap'n nex'?\" groaned Chunk, as he disappeared toward the mansion. He burst like a bombshell into the kitchen, a small building in the rear of the house.  \"Did you eber see de likes?\" exclaimed Zany. \"What yo' manners--\"  \"Hi, dar! talk 'bout manners! Marse Whately comin' wid a army, en want supper fer um all in des one minute en er haf by de clock!\"  Great, fat Aun' Suke threw up her hands in despair, and in the brief silence the tramp of horses and the jingling of sabres were plainly heard. They all knew Mad Whately, and it needed not that Mrs. Baron, desperately flurried, should bustle in a few moments later with orders that all hands should fly around. \"What you doing here?\" she asked Chunk, sharply.  \"I'se here ter hep, mistis. Dem's my orders from Marse Whately. He come ridin' by granny's.\"  \"Then go and kill chickens.\"  A few moments later the dolorous outcry of fowls was added to the uproar made by the barking dogs.  With a chill of fear Miss Lou, in her chamber, recognized her cousin's voice, and knew that he, with his band, had come to claim hospitality at his uncle's hands. What complications did his presence portend? Truly, the long months of monotony on the old plantation were broken now. What the end would be she dared not think, but for the moment her spirit exulted in the excitement which would at least banish stagnation.  In his secret heart Mr. Baron had hoped that his nephew would go on to his own home, a few miles further; for applauding him as a hero was one thing, and having him turn everything upside down at that hour another. Routine and order were scattered to the winds whenever Mad Whately made his appearance, but the host's second thoughts led him to remember that this visitation was infinitely to be preferred to one from the terrible Yankees; so he threw wide open the door, and, with his wife, greeted his nephew warmly. Then he shouted for Perkins to come and look after the horses.  \"Ah, mine uncle,\" cried Whately, \"where on earth is to be found a festive board like yours? Who so ready to fill the flowing bowl until even the rim is lost to sight, when your defenders have a few hours to spare in their hard campaigning? You won't entertain angels unawares to-night. You'd have been like Daniel in the den with none to stop the lions' mouths, or rather the jackals', had we not"]]]
