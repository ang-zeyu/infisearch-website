The train rumbled in.   During the long, hot journey from London, Colonel Crayfield had been repenting his good-natured acquiescence to what seemed to him a rather exacting, inconsiderate request. At first his fancy had been tickled by the notion that he, an elderly bachelor, should present himself in this semi-parental r√¥le; also he was anxious to see the little girl, his godchild, who apparently threatened to follow in her mother's footsteps, though from what he remembered of Charles Carrington, she was more likely to have inherited unstable tendencies from her father! Charles had always been foolish and weak where affairs of the heart were concerned; but in his final \"affair,\" with the young wife of a singularly unsuitable husband, he was certainly more to be pitied than blamed. That time he had really been _done for_, and he had behaved well in the circumstances; he, Colonel Crayfield, had stood by the guilty pair, and helped Charles to change his regiment, had consented to be sponsor to the unwelcome child. But, with the usual result of good-natured actions, it seemed that his responsibilities were never to end; and partly for the sake of Charles Carrington's memory, partly to satisfy a newly aroused interest, here he was on his way to give counsel to three old prudes in the matter of a naughty girl who had got into a scrape at school! What form this counsel was to take he had not the remotest idea; he knew nothing about schoolgirls; probably it was all a storm in a teacup. What on earth had persuaded him to waste his time in such useless fashion!  As he stepped out of the train in company with a few women bearing market baskets and a sprinkling of farmers wearing breeches and gaiters, he wished again that he had not yielded to sentiment and curiosity; visits bored him; he had been bored on the last occasion, ten years ago, when he had gone on duty to The Chestnuts. He remembered the ordeal well: Charles's formal, austere old mother, his uninteresting sisters, the undrinkable wine, Charles's child of six or seven years old, who had sniffed and fidgeted and refused to make friends, and was no different from other children of her age; he even remembered that the village was a long distance from the station, and he hoped that neither of the Carrington spinsters had come to the station to meet him.  Stella, standing expectant on the platform, saw a powerful-looking man, clean shaven, blunt-featured, inclined to stoutness, who moved ponderously--rather like a big Chinaman, a mandarin. As she stepped forward he stared at her, and the stare gave her an odd feeling of shyness. She would have to introduce herself; he did not know that she was to meet him at the station. He was not at all what she had expected; she had pictured a fussy old person with a protruding stomach, a beard, and spectacles!  Colonel Crayfield was equally taken aback. His experienced glance had been instantly arrested by the vision of a remarkably good-looking girl, tall and slim, who, though her skirt only reached to her ankles, whose hair was tied back with a large ribbon bow, was clearly no child; and he had gazed at the vision as he would hardly have permitted himself to gaze had he realised that the girl was his goddaughter! All the same, the situation entertained him; he no longer wished he had refused to respond to Miss Carrington's appeal.  Colonel Crayfield raised his hat. \"Then you are Stella--my godchild? How d'ye do, Stella?\"  The radiant brown eyes met his own. What an unnecessarily pretty creature; no wonder there had been trouble connected with boys!  \"Yes, they sent me to meet you,\" and she flushed with the consciousness that he knew of her misbehaviour.  \"Very kind of them to send you; very kind of you to come!\" He looked around. \"Now for my bag,\" he added briskly, \"and then we can be off.\"  Stella sighed with mingled doubt and relief; instinctively she felt that to Colonel Crayfield she was no criminal. Yet the remembrance of his glance when he first set eyes upon her, not knowing who she was, still disturbed her strangely. She abandoned all attempt to understand the doubt, and allowed her relief full play. Her spirits rose. During the drive to The Chestnuts she chattered freely, pointing out landmarks, telling stories of the people and the past; and never once did her godfather allude to the reason of his coming, for which consideration she was deeply grateful.  On arrival at The Chestnuts even the solemn faces of grandmamma and the aunts could not depress her; she sprang from the wagonette and ran into the house with a gaiety most unbecoming in one who had been expelled from school on a charge that was truly shocking.  After tea she escaped, went down to the stream at the bottom of the garden and watched grandmamma pacing the terrace in front of the house on Colonel Crayfield's arm. Grandmamma wore her brown bonnet and her cashmere shawl, and carried her ebony walking-stick. Stella ached to know what they were saying; of course, it was to do with herself, and how she should be punished. If only that nice old fellow would devise some means of escape for her from her deadly imprisonment!  Mrs. Carrington was saying: \"Stella is very irresponsible, and does not seem to realise how badly she has behaved. I fear she has inherited her mother's light nature, and what we are to do with her is a problem. It is not as if we could hope for a suitable marriage in the future, situated as we are.\"  \"It is a difficult question,\" said Colonel Crayfield evasively. His eyes turned to the slim figure that flitted beside the stream. He knew by the weighty silence that followed that he was expected to make some useful suggestion.  At last he said desperately: \"If I were not a bachelor and could offer her a chance in India----\" then he paused.  Grandmamma glanced at him furtively. Was he thinking of Ellen? What an admirable solution of the difficulty were he to marry Ellen, and thereby not only secure a most suitable wife for himself, but provide an equally suitable haven for Stella till the child could be settled in life. And just at that moment, as if in response to the old lady's thoughts, Ellen herself came out of the house. Really, Mrs. Carrington reflected, Ellen did not look anything like her age, and she was dressed so becomingly--not too much in the present fashion, which all three ladies considered so ugly. Grandmamma suddenly discovered that she was fatigued; that she had taken sufficient exercise for to-day, and would step into the drawing-room for a rest before dinner. Oh, dear no!--Ellen and Colonel Crayfield must not trouble about her; no need for them to come indoors just yet on such a pleasant evening; she would prefer to be quiet, and perhaps a short nap....  So Ellen and Colonel Crayfield took a little stroll in the garden, and the gentleman also took the opportunity to make a request connected with his own comfort.  \"I hope I shall not be giving too much trouble, dear Miss Ellen,\" he said with diffidence, \"but might a tray be put in my bedroom overnight? I am afraid I am a victim to old Indian habits, and one of them is that I wake very early and long for a cup of tea. I have my own kettle and spirit stand--I never move without them in England--so that if a teapot and some tea, and a little milk----\"  Ellen eagerly assented. Of course; it would be no trouble at all. She was _so glad_ he should have mentioned it. \"And I do hope you will ask for exactly what you want. I will tell Betty, and see that she arranges the tray properly.\"  \"If it might be a fairly big teapot and a breakfast cup ...\" pursued Colonel Crayfield. (What he had suffered in English households from \"dainty little morning tea-sets\"!--a teapot the size of an apple, a cup to match, tea so thick and strong that it might have been jam.)  Ellen wondered nervously if there would be enough milk left overnight for the visitor's tray. Betty was always so careful not to take more than was actually required for the household. \"I think I will just run indoors,\" she said apologetically, \"and tell Betty what to do, so that she will be sure not to forget anything.\"  \"You are more than kind!\" exclaimed Colonel Crayfield with fervour; but he did not add that he hoped she would speedily return and continue their stroll. And when Ellen reappeared, smiling and triumphant, he was nowhere to be seen. Neither was Stella in sight; and Ellen finally discovered the pair in the kitchen garden.  Stella had crawled beneath a net that protected the gooseberries from the birds. Colonel Crayfield was standing stolid and large on the path, and Stella was handing him berries through the meshes of the net. He was not eating the fruit, and Ellen felt that this was compatible with his dignity and his years. She could not imagine Colonel Crayfield sucking gooseberries and throwing the skins about! It seemed he was collecting them for Stella, who, bent double, was robbing the bushes--such an ungainly attitude for a young lady.  \"Stella!\" called Aunt Ellen in reproof, \"you are tearing your frock!\"  The child looked a disgraceful object as she emerged from the nets; a long rent in one of her sleeves disclosed a round white arm with a red scratch in the flesh, her face was crimson, her hair in disorder, she was covered with twigs and bits, and her mouth was sticky with gooseberry juice. Laughing, she held out her skirt, like an apron, for the fruit that filled Colonel Crayfield's large mahogany-coloured hands.  Ellen felt truly ashamed of her niece. What would Colonel Crayfield be thinking of his goddaughter, and of the way in which she had been brought up! Had Ellen observed the look in Colonel Crayfield's eyes at the moment, she would probably have mistaken it for astonished disapproval; as it was, she only observed that he gazed at Stella in silence, at the shining hair that fell"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53372"],["title","Star of India (#5)"],["body","her forehead, at the wide-open brown eyes, thickly lashed and full of mischief, at the flushed cheeks and parted lips, that showed a row of faultless little teeth, and at the red scratch on the white forearm.  Stella, unabashed, proffered her skirt, full of fruit, to her aunt. \"Do have some, Aunt Ellen,\" she cried joyously. \"They're ripping, especially the big, hairy fellows.\"  \"You will spoil your dinner,\" said Aunt Ellen severely, \"as you have already spoilt your frock.\"  \"Like little Miss Jane,\" and Stella chanted:        \"Greedy, greedy little Miss Jane,      I'll never give _her_ a present again.      She spent her sixpence on raspberry rock,      And spoilt her dinner as well as her frock.\"   Colonel Crayfield actually laughed; moreover, he accepted a gooseberry from Stella's grubby fingers and ate it fastidiously, burying the skin in the mould with the toe of his boot.  That evening grandmamma's hopes ran high. Augusta sent Stella to bed early, and afterwards Colonel Crayfield listened, apparently entranced, while Ellen played the piano--played \"Yorkshire Bells\" and \"The Village Blacksmith.\"     CHAPTER III   Very early next morning Colonel Crayfield was awakened by a crash. His bedroom was alight with the dawn; the lemon scent of magnolia blossom floated in at the open window. What had aroused him? Involuntarily he glanced at the tea-tray, at the big teapot and breakfast cup for which he had Miss Ellen to thank; then he became aware of a curious sound, and sitting up he beheld the milk-jug in fragments on the floor and a cat complacently lapping the milk that had spread in a pool on the carpet. In a fury he sprang from the bed, clapping his hands, shouting at the thief; the cat, ears back, tail on end, made for the window and disappeared in a flash; he could hear her scrambling down the magnolia tree. What about his tea! He hated tea without milk, and probably the household would not be astir for hours. He formed a bold project--he would go downstairs and forage for more milk. No one need hear him; he could explain, relate the disaster at breakfast. Slippers on his feet, and a coat over his sleeping-suit, he crept into the long, low passage. All was still. But the stairs! The stairs might have been actually alive and the banisters too; how they did creak! It was a relief to arrive at the foot of the staircase without having aroused the household. Now there was a green baize door that evidently gave on to the kitchen quarters; it yielded silently to his push, and he was confronted with a short flight of stone steps. At any rate, _they_ could not creak. Quickly descending them, he found himself in a large, old-fashioned kitchen, stone-paved; beyond, surely, was the larder where milk might be found, if the cat had not been there before him. How different it all was from Indian establishments; in India, whether as a guest or in one's own house, one could demand tea at any hour of the night or day, and it was forthcoming as a matter of course; in India----  \"Hallo!\"  Colonel Crayfield jumped ingloriously, and only just saved himself from swearing aloud. His goddaughter was standing in the larder doorway, a cup in one hand, a crust of bread in the other. She had the advantage of him in the matter of toilet, being fully dressed in a blue washing frock that fell in straight lines from her neck to her ankles, and a wide straw hat bound with a ribbon of the same colour.  They looked at each other, amazed. Colonel Crayfield drew his coat closer about him, and passed his hand mechanically over his hair.  \"Good gracious!\" he said resentfully.  \"Did you hear me go down?\" she inquired.  \"No; but I wonder you didn't hear _me_! The stairs made such a confounded noise.\"  \"Yes, I know; aren't they awful! I always expect Aunt Augusta to burst from her room with a poker in her hand. Were you looking for something to eat?\"  \"I was looking for some milk,\" he admitted; \"a cat got into my room and knocked down the milk-jug. I don't like tea without milk.\"  \"I expect it was Granny.\"  \"_Granny?_\" repeated Colonel Crayfield, mystified.  Stella laughed. \"Not my grandmother! Was it an old black-and-white cat with a very long tail?\"  \"I really did not notice. Anyway, the brute broke the jug and was drinking the milk----\"  \"Here you are then,\" she handed him a jug.  He took it. \"But have you all you want yourself?\" he inquired politely.  \"Heaps,\" she replied, munching her crust. \"Have a piece of bread? It's lovely--home made. I only wish I had an onion, too. Don't you love onions?\"  \"I don't object to them----\" he began; then suddenly the unfitness of the situation came home to him with something of a shock. Here was he, the ruler of a vast area in India, accustomed to ceremony and circumstance and state, pilfering a larder with a chit of a girl--discussing onions, of all things; and further than that he was not dressed! It might have been a silly dream.  \"And what are you doing down here at this extraordinary hour?\" he asked of his goddaughter with what dignity was left to him.  \"Eating and drinking, as you can see,\" was her flippant reply. Then, as though conscious that she was perhaps not treating Colonel Crayfield quite with the respect that was his due, she added primly: \"I often get up very early and go for a ramble\"; she hesitated, and continued with diffidence, \"would you care to come for a walk instead of going to bed again?\"  \"Well, I can't come as I am; but if you will wait till I've had my tea and dressed----\"  \"Of course I'll wait! I'll leave the side door open and you'll find me outside.\"  Later, when he joined her, his self-respect as Commissioner of Rassih restored, he said: \"Indian life would suit you, since you are so fond of early rising. In India I am nearly always out soon after daybreak.\"  Stella sighed. \"Oh! India--how I should love to go there!\"  \"Really? What about the heat and the exile and the insects?\"--and he added playfully--\"not to speak of snakes and tigers!\"  \"I'm not afraid of anything!\" bragged Stella, and with the elimination of grandmamma this was true enough. \"If it comes to exile, what could be worse than life at The Chestnuts--where nothing ever happens, and nothing will ever happen!\"  Now they were out of the garden, out on a common that was ablaze with gorse--the spongy turf was silvered with dew, the air fragrant and fresh; birds' voices, the distant lowing of cattle, echoed in the sweet stillness.  \"But some day you will marry,\" prophesied Colonel Crayfield, in a tone of encouragement.  \"Marry!\" derided Stella. \"Who is there for me to marry?\" She thought of Miss Spurt and of the young porter at the railway station.  He made no answer; he was appraising the slim, young form beside him, marking the grace of her limbs, the poise of the little head on the long, round neck, the clean turn of ankle and wrist--every point was good; in a couple of years she must be a magnificent woman.  \"What are you thinking about?\" inquired Stella. \"Here we are at the end of the common and you've hardly spoken a word. Are you tired?\"  \"Tired? Certainly not! It would take rather more than a walk across a common to tire _me_!\" He stepped out with vigour.  \"What long strides you are taking. Hadn't we better have a race while we are about it? See that oak tree over there--at the edge of the wood? I bet you I'll get there first. One, two, three--off!\"  And the Commissioner of Rassih, who could still hold his own at tennis and rackets, accepted the challenge. The race ended in a dead heat.  Stella flung herself down beneath the oak tree, and Colonel Crayfield took a seat, formed by the roots, beside her. The fact that he was scarcely out of breath pleased him.  \"Anyway, you can run!\" pronounced Stella.  \"Why not?\" he demanded.  \"Oh, I don't know.\" She was politely evasive; it would hardly do to explain that such agility in anyone of his age and bulk had surprised her, and she hastened to change the subject. \"Now, do let us talk about India\"--she looked up at him with eager, bright eyes--\"you don't know how I long to see India. I suppose it's in my blood; all the Carringtons did things in India, and if I had been a boy I should have gone out to do things, too. I am the last young Carrington left--and I am only a girl!\"  Colonel Crayfield took off his hat and ran his fingers through his thick, grey hair; he was proud of its thickness; most men of his age in India were hopelessly bald.  \"India isn't what it was; the spirit of romance and adventure has gone, the pagoda tree is dead, prices are rising, and exchange is falling----\"  \"But haven't you lovely big houses?\" interrupted Stella, \"and heaps of servants and horses, and the sun and gardens and fruit? What is your bungalow like in India?\"  He checked his inclination to grumble. \"It isn't a bungalow. It's part of a Moghul fort, built on the walls of the old city; the wall goes right round the compound; a compound is----\"  \"Yes, I know what compound means! I know compound, and tiffin, and chuprassee, and peg, and lots of words. I find them in all the old family letters put away in the lumber room. Do go on!\"  \"Well, I believe the city in the old days used to come close up to the wall, but it has gradually been moved farther away. The back of the house looks on to a desert that stretches for miles----\"  \"Is it a big station?\"  \"No; it's a small civil station; too small considering that it's the headquarters of a big charge.\"  \"It must be ripping to feel you are ruling, governing all the time! Don't you love power--spelt with a capital P?\"  \"Who doesn't? But there are definite drawbacks as well as compensations in Indian service.\"  She sighed. \"I shall never see the country; never feel the Indian sun, or smell an Indian bazaar. I shall never hear a tom-tom or the frogs' chorus in the rains, or even see a snake, except in the Zoo or in a bottle!\"  Colonel Crayfield gazed at the child in astonishment. He guessed nothing of the grip that the old letters and memoirs,"]]]
