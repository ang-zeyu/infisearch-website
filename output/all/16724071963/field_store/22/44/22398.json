Kleinschmidt                                  1967_                                     PREFACE   Having been associated with the printing telegraph for more than sixty years, I have felt the urge to write a résumé of the problems and the progress made during my time toward today’s wonderful achievements in the art of telegraphic communications.  It is interesting to note that of all the old-time electric telegraph systems, it appears that only those using the Morse dot-dash code invented in 1837 and the permutation code devised by Gauss and Weber in 1833 (now known everywhere as the Baudot code) have survived today.  Samuel Morse’s code, which was modified somewhat in several letter code compositions to facilitate its use anywhere in the world, has become an audible, easily learned international language, loved by its users everywhere. It will no doubt continue to be used for some time to come, as long as we have our railroad telegraph operators, radio amateurs, police CW systems, certain branches of the Armed Forces, and any others who converse in dits and dahs.  The permutation code has taken hold firmly, too. Its use of five pulses transmitted in varying combinations of on and off, or positive and negative, conditions has wide application in today’s printed communications systems. As in the Morse system, alphabets for the five-unit permutation code system have been modified as to letter code compositions for international correspondence. The permutation code uses the powers of two in progressively selecting a letter printing position.  The binary code uses the same selective stops by yes or no designation in a system of counting by the powers of two. It is used where larger groups of yes or no positions are required, as in data processing and computer systems.  This writing, then, is a bit of history that will put together the constructive developments that brought about the present era of the worldwide, telegraphically-transmitted printed word.  I wish to acknowledge with great appreciation the informative material sent to me by my friends, both here and in foreign lands, who are associated with the telegraph industry.  For assembling information we have gathered from various sources and for the most helpful assistance given me in writing this story, I also want to thank my secretary, Mrs. Doris Pompilio.

A NEW ERA BEGINS                                    CHAPTER 1                               Introduction   It is a major effort today to keep pace with the rapid advances in the field of printed communications. Hardly a day passes that we do not read of a new development in equipment that is more complex, farther reaching, more rapid in operation....  This electrical, or electronic, transmission and interchange of the printed word might be said to be an evolvement of the old printing telegraph systems. Such systems, over the years, while not so rapidly as today, were also improved upon, modified, speeded up, but could be used only in the point-to-point transmission of messages.  While the railroads had been using the Morse code system (key and sounder) satisfactorily, they would have preferred a system whereby a printed record could be obtained. In the industrial world, too, there was need for a businessman’s printing telegraph—a means to type out messages, directly and interchangeably, to far-off associates. And there was always that dream, starting with the earliest telegraph experimenters, of being able to correspond instantly with one another anywhere in the world. Indeed, the need for all this had been known for many years, but not the way.  It was after the turn of the century that telegraph engineers began in earnest to think about a system of telegraphy that would permit direct intercommunication by the printed word, and direct circuit connection to any outlying subscriber as in the telephone communication system.  Up until then, apparatus for transmitting telegrams, such as that of Wheatstone & Cooke, Morse, Hughes, Barclay, etc., also the step-by-step stock tickers and bulletin printers, used various types of code-signaling devices in which the code varied in length as to the transmission of more frequent or less frequent letters.  Now in order to provide a practical telegraph system permitting the interconnection of apparatus throughout the world, the first basic requisite is a standard signaling code; this code, moreover, must be of such nature as to use the simplest form of electrical signaling (such as make and break signals, or positive and negative signals), and the code should be of equal length for all characters.  The permutation code, where combinations of five plus and minus pulses will give thirty-two selective positions, was suggested as far back as 1833 by Gauss and Weber. Whitehouse, in 1854, and Barnett, in 1860, experimented further, using the permutation code to operate a recording mechanism. However, no practical means for actually printing letters and figures was found until 1882 when Jean Maurice Emile Baudot designed a multiplex system to permit the transmission of four messages in each direction over a single line circuit. Later, Baudot designed a tape printer in which the selecting and printing mechanisms comprised an ingenious arrangement of cooperating parts, including a rotating typewheel associated with a coded combiner wheel and five stationary elements selectively movable to received code positions, each element having an extending finger to be brought into contact with the periphery of the coded combiner wheel upon the completion of a selective code setting. When the code combination of the set fingers matched a code on the wheel, a print roller was released to press the recording tape against the typewheel and print the selected letter.  Although the Baudot Multiplex was used extensively in Europe, engineers and inventors in the United States had not produced a practical 5-unit permutation-code teleprinter system. They were constantly searching for a unit code system requiring a minimum number of electrical impulses to operate a telegraph printer. Various types of relay systems using distinctive signal pulses were proposed. A three-unit-code system that showed promise, and did not require synchronism, used four different electrical pulse conditions: a high voltage positive or negative pulse, and a low voltage positive or negative pulse. Records show that many inventors played with this code and that John Burry, C. L. Krum, G. A. Cardwell, and J. C. Barclay, among others, built operable equipment using such a code arrangement. The following excerpt from Cardwell’s patent No. 905,497 of December 1, 1908, may be of interest. It describes the code arrangement of four different line conditions in three signal groups to produce 36 different code combinations.    In order to energize the controller magnets in proper sequence to   position the type wheel for printing a desired letter, a predetermined   code or system of sending in the impulses is essential. In an   instrument constructed by me in accordance with the present invention   I have used the following:      1-2-1     letter space     1-2-3     carriage return     1-2-4     line space     1-3-1     type wheel shift     1-3-2     type wheel release     1-3-4     A     1-4-1     I     1-4-2     O     1-4-3     D     2-1-2     E     2-1-3     H     2-1-4     N     2-3-1     W     2-3-2     R     2-3-4     S     2-4-1     T     2-4-2     V     2-4-3     U     3-1-2     -     3-1-3     ,     3-1-4     ?     3-2-1     Y     3-2-3     C     3-2-4     F     3-4-1     G     3-4-2     Q     3-4-3     L     4-1-2     M     4-1-3     J     4-1-4     B     4-2-1     X     4-2-3     Z     4-2-4     .     4-3-1     K     4-3-2     P     4-3-4    The numerals in the above code or system indicate the sequence of the   impulses through the relay contacts 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Cardwell’s backers formed the American Telegraph Typewriter Company and sold shares, claiming a great profitable future for their apparatus. A few printers were built, but, on extended service tests, the high-low-voltage feature proved to be impractical and the company folded.  J. C. Barclay of the Western Union Telegraph Company designed printing apparatus and perforated tape transmitting equipment for this type of system, but, after limited use of the high-low-voltage principle, he changed this feature to long and short pulses with discriminating relays. With later improvements, this system was put into service on a number of Western Union message circuits.    _Note:_ Today, in the 1960s, the techniques of frequency division and   electronics could be used for transmitting three different line   conditions from a group of four different frequencies. In such a   system, synchronism between send and receive terminals, or the   start-stop method to control correct timing, is not needed. The   transmission of any selected group of three, when received in   succession at a teleprinter, will cause printing of a letter when the   third receiving relay completes a circuit to the selected printing   magnet. Transistor circuits with associated control elements could   replace the relays.  Telegraph companies in the United States were mostly using the Morse and increased its efficiency through development of quadruplex operation and high-speed transmission systems. However, the quest for a more efficient printing telegraph system persisted and various types were proposed and tried. All made use of codes that were impractical for intercommunicating systems and, while some were used in message service by the telegraph companies, they did not appear to have"]]]
