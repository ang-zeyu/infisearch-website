On the arrival in Indian Territory, the exiles at once set about building houses and planting crops, the government having agreed under treaty to furnish them rations for one year after arrival. They were welcomed by their kindred, the \"Old Settlers,\" who held the country under previous treaties of 1828 and 1833. These, however, being already regularly organized under a government and chiefs of their own, were by no means disposed to be swallowed by the governmental authority of the newcomers.  Jealousies developed, in which the minority or treaty party of the emigrants, headed by Major Ridge, took sides with the old settlers against John Ross of the National party, which outnumbered the others nearly three to one.  While these differences were at their height, the Nation was thrown into a fever of excitement by the news that Major Ridge, his son, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot--all leaders of the treaty party--had been killed by adherents of the National party, immediately after the adjournment of a general council, which had adjourned after nearly two weeks of debate without having been able to bring about harmonious action. Major Ridge was waylaid and shot near the Arkansas line, his son was taken from bed and cut to pieces with hatchets, while Boudinot was treacherously killed at his home at Park Hill, Indian Territory, all three being killed upon the same day, June 22, 1839, which date marks the decline and fall of a once great and happy people. For fifty years which followed this luckless day in June, Indian Territory became a veritable theater of crime and disorder.  From the South meridian of the sunflower state, to the cypress banks of the Red river, and from Fort Smith to the shifting sands of the great plains, for half a century sheltered a coterie of actors that would have made Robin Hood or Kit Carson blush with envy. The soil of the five tribes has been moistened with human blood when there was none to answer the cry for vengeance; when no sound save the deadly snap of the Winchester and the pit-pat of the bronchos' hoofs were there to bear testimony. Now, those who incited intrigue and murder are gone, the desperado is a thing of the past, the brave men who enlisted in the hazardous governmental service to give them battle have disappeared, and the sound of the firing Winchester used in deadly conflict, has been replaced by the reaper and the mower, and toilers in the field of commerce and industry.  The Indian tribe has been supplanted by the American Government; and the school and church have taken the place of the chase and the feud. Where the wild flowers nodded far out on the lonely plain, vast fields of wheat and corn whisper the great name of Oklahoma.  At this writing the eastern band of Cherokee is about to be dissolved, their lands allotted, and in a few more decades the Cherokee will have passed, and the name will be presented only in old records and in the hearts of their descendants.        PART II  OCCONEECHEE        OCCONEECHEE,  The Maid of the Mystic Lake,  by Robert Frank Jarrett.    I.  Far away beneath the shadows Of the towering Smoky range, In the Western North Carolina, Comes a story true, but strange; Of a maiden and her lover, Of the tribe of Cherokee, And she lived far up the mountain, Near the hills of Tennessee.  Far above the habitation Of the white man, and the plain, Lived the dark-eyed Indian maiden, Of the Junaluska strain; Junaluska, chief, her father, Occoneechee was his pride, In the lonely little wigwam, High upon the mountain side.  There the stream Oconaluftee Hides its source far from the eye, Of the white man in his rovings, Far upon the mountain high; And the forest land primeval, Roamed by doe and wandering bear, And the hissing, coiling serpent, Was no stranger to them there.  Catamount and mountain-boomer Sprang from cliff-side into trees, And the eagle, hawk and vulture Winged their course on every breeze. At the footfall of this maiden Sped the gobbler wild and free, From the maiden Occoneechee Flitted butterfly and bee.  Occoneechee, forest dweller, Lived amid the scene so wild; In the simple Indian manner Lived old Junaluska's child. Streams of purest limpid water Gushed forth o'er the rock below, And the trout and silver minnow Dwelt in water, cold as snow.  Occoneechee's Mother Qualla Passed away from earth to God, When this maiden was a baby And was covered by the sod. High upon the rugged mountain, Far above the haunts of men, With their burdens and their sorrows, And their load of care and sin.  Thus the maiden knew no mother, Knew no love as most maids know, Heard no song, as sung by mother, Softly, sweetly, plaintive, slow. When the twilight came at evening, And the wigwam fire was lit, And the bearskin robe was spread out Upon which they were to sit,  Junaluska wept his Qualla, Wept the lover who had flown, For she was the only lover That this chieftain's heart had known; And at night, there was no lover To sit by him on the rug, Made of skins of bear and woodchuck, In the wigwam, crude but snug.  And at times he'd stand at evening, When the sun was setting low, And would watch with adoration Shifting clouds and scenes below; And his soul would want to wander Where the clime of setting sun Would reveal his long lost Qualla, When his work of life was done.  And the tears would fill his eyelids, And emotion shake his frame, When he thought of her departed, Or some friend would speak her name. And he'd call on God the spirit, When he'd see the golden glow Of the radiant splendid sunset, Where he ever longed to go.  Then he'd think of Occoneechee, In her adolescent years, How she needed his protection There to drive away her fears. Then he'd cease his deep repining, And his wailing and his grief, For her future and her beauty Brought the chieftain's heart relief.  Though the life of Occoneechee Was one lonely strange career, And the solitude and silence Made the romance of it drear, While the wildness of the forest, With the animals that roam, And the birds in great profusion Cheered her little wigwam home,  Yet her spirit, like the eagle's, Longed to soar off and be free From the wilds of gorge and mountain, Stream and cliff and crag and tree. And one day there came a red man Wandering up the mountain side, From the vale Oconaluftee Which was every Indian's pride.  Tall and handsome, agile runner, And the keenness of his eye Did betray his quick perception To the casual passer-by. Hair hung down in long black tresses, Far below his shoulder-blade, And the brilliant painted feathers By the passing winds were swayed.  And the arrows in his quiver Tipped with variegated stone, And the tomahawk and war knife, All the weapons he had known; Yet he knew all of their uses, None could wield with greater skill Tomahawk or knife or arrow, Than this wandering Whippoorwill.  Occoneechee, sitting lonely, In a shady little nook, Near the opening, by the wigwam, And the babbling crystal brook; She was bathing feet and ankles, Arms and hands she did refresh, In the iridescent splendor Of the fountain cool and fresh.  Whippoorwill, the wandering warrior, Spied the maiden by the pool, 'Neath the spreading tree above her, By the limpid stream so cool; Then he ventured there to tarry, Watch and linger in the wild, Near the maiden and the fountain, Watch this forest-dwelling child.  Though a warrior, brave, undaunted By the fiercest, wildest foe, In the battle's hardest struggle, Chasing bear and buck and doe; For his life was used to hardships, Scaling mountains in the chase, Yet he ne'er was known to falter 'Mid the hottest of the race.  But he now was moved by caution To approach, with greatest care, The unknown maid, there before him, And the scene so rich and rare; And his brave heart almost failed him As he comes up to her side, And obeisance makes he to her, E'er the chieftain she espied.  Occoneechee sprang up quickly From the rock moss-covered seat, All abashed, but lithe and nimble Were her ankles and her feet. \"O-I-see-you,\" were the greetings They exchanged spontaneously, As they moved off together. Occoneechee leads the way,  To the quiet little wigwam, Where old Junaluska dwells With the maiden Occoneechee, And for whom his heart up-wells. Spreading out the flowing doe-skin Flat upon the earthen floor, Occoneechee and the warrior Sat and talked the chases o'er.  Sat and talked of bear and venison, Sat and smoked the calumet. These the greetings of the warrior, When the maiden first he met. Whippoorwill, the wandering warrior, Tarried for a night and day, Tarried long within the wigwam, And was loath to go away,  For the maid and Junaluska To the warrior were so kind, That 'twere hard among the tribesmen Such a generous clan to find. But at dawn upon the morrow, Whippoorwill must wend his way From old Junaluska's wigwam, For too long had been his stay.  Kind affection, Junaluska Gave to parting Whippoorwill, As he sauntered from the wigwam, Wandering toward the rugged rill. Now the silence so unbroken Starts a tear-drop in each eye, And the gentle passing zephyr Gathered up the lover's sigh,  And the sighs were borne to heaven, Like as lovers' sighs ascend, As the good angelic zephyrs Bear the message, friend to friend. Now each heart was sore and lonely, Sad the parting lovers feel, Yet the hopes of love's devotion Deep into each life did steal.  And when Whippoorwill had left them, Good old Junaluska said To his daughter Occoneechee, \"Would you like this brave to wed?\" Occoneechee, timid maiden, Never thought of love before, For she ne'er had spread the doe-skin Wide upon the earthen floor,  For a warrior, brave as he was, One possessed of skill so rare, With his tomahawk and war knife, And such long black raven hair; And she knew not how to answer, Though she felt as lovers do, When they plight their deep devotion To each other to be true.  \"Occoneechee!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/53375"],["title","Occoneechee, the Maid of the Mystic Lake (#3)"],["body","of wild woods, I am growing old and gray, And I feel I soon must leave you, Though I grieve to go away. I can feel the hand of time, child, Pressing down upon my head, And I know it won't be long now Till I'm resting with the dead.  \"I can hear your mother calling, Sweetly, gently, calling me, Beckoning from the golden sunset, And she calls also for thee. 'Twas just last night she stood beside me, While you lay there sound asleep, And she called me, 'Junaluska!' And her voice caused me to weep.  \"And she said, 'Dear Junaluska, I have come to tell you where You will find me at the portals Of the Lord's house over there. I will be among the blessed, Be with angels up on high. Have no fears of Death's dark river, Be courageous till you die.'  \"Then she stood and sang a message O'er you in your lonely bed, For a moment, then departed; And I called, but she had fled. Yet I daily hear her sweet voice, And I see her image there, As she calls us unto heaven, 'Mid the pleasures, O, so rare.  \"And I soon shall cross the river, And will join her on the strand, With immortals long departed, In the fair, blest, happy land. When I'm gone you'll need protection, By a brave who knows no fear, And when sorrows overflow you, One to wipe away the tear.  \"Then I'll watch and wait with Qualla, With the chiefs and warriors brave, Who have joined the tribe eternal, Conquered death, hell and the grave. I shall watch then for your coming, And I'll tell the mighty throng That you're coming in the future, And we'll greet you with the song,  \"That the seraphs sing in glory, Casting gem crowns at the feet, Praising Him who reigns forever On the grand tribunal seat.\" As he talked his voice grew weaker, And his hand grew very chill, Then the moisture crowned his forehead, And his pulse was deathly still.  Then she knew that her dear mother And the great chiefs that had been Had op'ed the gate of heaven wide To let another brave chief in. Then she sobbed out for her father, As a broken-hearted child Will for loved ones just departed, Left so lonely in the wild.  But the dead, too soon forgotten, Now lies buried by the side Of his much lamented Qualla, Once his sweet and lovely bride, While their spirits dwell together, Free from care and want and pain, Where the tempest full of sorrow Ne'er can reach their souls again.  Years had flown since Occoneechee Saw her loving Whippoorwill, High upon the Smoky Mountain, Near the crystal rippling rill; For the white man had transported Brave and squaw and little child Far away to Oklahoma, To the western hills so wild.  Some had gone to the Dakotas, Some had gone to Mexico, Some had joined the tribe eternal; All were going, sure but slow. For the white man's occupation, Cherokee must give their land, And must give up all possessions, Go and join some other band.  Yet a residue of tribesmen Were allowed here to remain, 'Mid the mountains and the forest, And the meadows and the plain, But the strong men and the warriors, Most of them had gone away, Far across the mighty mountains Toward the closing of the day.  General Jackson's men in blue coats Came and took away the braves, Took away the squaw and papoose, Buried many in their graves, Yet the residue triumphant, Roamed out in the forest wild, Without shelter, food or comfort, For decrepid chief and child.  Sad and weary, long and dreary, Moved the Cherokee out West, With their store of skins and venison, And the trinkets they possessed. Up across the Smoky Mountains, Rough and rugged trail and road, Lined by rhododendron blossoms, Close beside where Lufty flowed.  When they down the gorge descended, Winding toward the Tennessee, Branch and bough o'erhead were bending And no landscape could they see, And the labyrinthian footway Led through forests dense and dark And the air was sweetly laden With the bruised birchen bark;  Hemlocks tall and swaying gently In the sighing passing breeze, And the fir and spreading balsam Joined the cadence of the trees. At the base of birch and hemlock Flowed the Pigeon fierce and bold, With its water clear as crystal, And its fountains icy cold;  Flowed the dauntless rapid waters, Fresh and pure and ever free, Rushed o'er cataract and cascade, Ever onward toward the sea. Whippoorwill, the wandering warrior, Shorn of power and of pride, Marched in single file and lonely, With his hands behind him tied.  Hands were bound with thongs and fetters-- Thongs and fetters could not hold Brave so gallant young and noble As this valiant warrior bold. For his thoughts of Occoneechee, Who was left far, far behind, With the residue of women, Stirred his brave heart and his mind.  On and on for days they traveled By the stream whose silver flow, From the great high Smoky Mountains, Became silent now and slow; For the rocks and rising ridges, Once their progress did impede, Now were fading in the distance, Could not now retard their speed.  And the journey, long and tedious, Wore the women, wore the brave, And they sore and much lamented, To be bound as serf or slave; For their free-born spirits never Had been bound by man before, Till the blue-coat Jackson soldier Came and dragged them from their door.  Corn was blooming on the lowlands When the journey they betook, And the grass gave much aroma, By the laughing Soco brook; But the suns and moons oft waning Brought the moon of ripening corn To a nation, broken-hearted, With a doubting hope forlorn.  Level lands brought no enchantment To a people who had known Naught but freedom till the present, Whose utopian dream had flown; Flown as flows the radiant river, Flown as flows the hopes of youth, From the red man of the forest. They were no more free, forsooth.  By and by the Father Waters Came in view of brave and squaw, And the skiff and side-wheel steamer Were the shifting scenes they saw, Plying fast the Father Waters, With a current slow and still, And reverberating whistles Shrieked a medley loud and shrill.  And the ferryboat was busy, Plying fast the liquid wave Of the Father Water's current, Bearing squaw and chief and brave, Till the last brave Indian warrior Crossed the Father Waters' tide, Crossed the gentle flowing river, With its current deep and wide.  Then they rested from their journey, Rested for a little while, On the bluff above the river, Where they saw her laughing smile. They could see the sun at morning Rise up quickly from his rest, See him hasting to his zenith, Soon to go down in the west.  Then the winter came on quickly, Killing corn and grass and cane, And the wind brought cloudy weather, With its snow and mist and rain, And the tribe within the barracks Were disheartened, one and all. And they longed now for their Lufty, With its cascade and its fall.  But at last the genial sunshine Took away the ice that froze The corn of hope, from the tribesmen, And the chilly wind that blows, Along the valley, of the river, Over bog and prairie, too; And an order came with springtime, \"You the journey must renew.\"  Then they rose up in the morning, Rose before the dawn of day, Rolled and tied the tents together, And were quickly on their way, On their way to Oklahoma, Out across Missouri land, Chief and squaw and wary warrior, Marched the Cherokee brave band.  To the western reservation, Where the bison and the owl, And the she-wolf, fox and serpent Writhe and roam and nightly prowl; This the country where they took them, This the country that they gave In exchange for their own country, To the chief and squaw and brave.  Leaving all they loved behind them, Leaving all to them most dear, And they settled there so lonely, In a country dry and drear; There to pine away in sorrow, And repining, die of grief; From the solitude and silence Of this land there's no relief.      II.  Amid the hills of Carolina, Hills impregnant with rich bliss, With their grots and groves and fountains, Hills that love-beams love to kiss; Roamed the dark, but pretty maiden, Occoneechee, lovely child, Roamed she far out in the mountains, 'Mid their solitude so wild.  Dreamed she oft here, as she rambled, Of her warrior Whippoorwill, Of her lover, long her lover, Whom she first met near the rill, High upon the Smoky Mountains, Where the sunset's afterglow Holds the secrets of Dame Nature From the sons of men below.  Occoneechee sought her lover, Down Oconaluftee's vale, Through the brush and tangled wildwood, Without compass, chart or trail, Where the river Tuckaseigee Dashes down its rocky bed, Near a trail long since deserted, Over which a tribe once sped.  Then she wandered down the river, On and on, as on it flows, Wades the river, wades its branches, Follows it where'er it goes Through the laurel brush and ivy, Over spreading beds of fern, Over rock moss-covered ledges, Follows every winding turn,  Till it flows into the river, Called the Little Tennessee, Here she lingers long and tarries, And she strains her eyes to see If her vision will reveal him, And abates her breath to hear The voice of Whippoorwill, her lover, One of all to her most dear.  Yet no sound came to relieve her, And no vision came to please, And it never dawned upon her, Here among the virgin trees, That her lover was transported, With the brave and chief and child To the land of Oklahoma, Land so lonely, weird and wild.  Up the stream she then ascended, Slowly, surely did she march, 'Neath the spreading oak and hemlock, Resting oft beneath their arch. Walls of solid spar and granite Roared their heads up toward the blue, But no wall or hill or river Could impede the maiden true.  She now reached the Nantahala, Picturesque in every way, And she rested 'neath the shadow Of the mountain tall and gray; High the mountain, clear the water, That comes rushing down the side Of the mountain from the forest With its unpolluted tide.  Speckled beauties swam the water, Swam as only they can do; Deer in herds roamed all the forest, Only Cherokees were few. Eagles, swift upon their pinions, Soared aloft upon the air, They would"]]]
