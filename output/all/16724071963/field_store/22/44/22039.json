He holds a respectable office in the museum, and was obliging enough to procure me permission to see it, luckily the day before it was shut up.  In general you must give in your name a fortnight before you can he admitted.  But after all, I am sorry to say, it was the rooms, the glass cases, the shelves, or the repository for the books in the British Museum which I saw, and not the museum itself, we were hurried on so rapidly through the apartments.  The company, who saw it when and as I did, was various, and some of all sorts; some, I believe, of the very lowest classes of the people, of both sexes; for, as it is the property of the nation, every one has the same right (I use the term of the country) to see it that another has.  I had Mr. Wendeborn’s book in my pocket, and it, at least, enabled me to take a somewhat more particular notice of some of the principal things; such as the Egyptian mummy, a head of Homer, &c.  The rest of the company, observing that I had some assistance which they had not, soon gathered round me; I pointed out to them as we went along, from Mr. Wendeborn’s German book, what there was most worth seeing here.  The gentleman who conducted us took little pains to conceal the contempt which he felt for my communications when he found out that it was only a German description of the British Museum I had got.  The rapidly passing through this vast suite of rooms, in a space of time little, if at all, exceeding an hour, with leisure just to cast one poor longing look of astonishment on all these stupendous treasures of natural curiosities, antiquities, and literature, in the contemplation of which you could with pleasure spend years, and a whole life might be employed in the study of them—quite confuses, stuns, and overpowers one.  In some branches this collection is said to be far surpassed by some others; but taken altogether, and for size, it certainly is equalled by none.  The few foreign divines who travel through England generally desire to have the Alexandrian manuscript shewn them, in order to be convinced with their own eyes whether the passage, “These are the three that bear record, &c.,” is to be found there or not.  The Rev. Mr. Woide lives at a place called Lisson Street, not far from Paddington; a very village-looking little town, at the west end of London.  It is quite a rural and pleasant situation; for here I either do, or fancy I do, already breathe a purer and freer air than in the midst of the town.  Of his great abilities, and particularly in oriental literature, I need not inform you; but it will give you pleasure to hear that he is actually meditating a fac-simile edition of the Alexandrian MS.  I have already mentioned the infinite obligations I lie under to this excellent man for his extraordinary courtesy and kindness.                       _The Theatre in the Haymarket_.  Last week I went twice to an English play-house.  The first time “The Nabob” was represented, of which the late Mr. Foote was the author, and for the entertainment, a very pleasing and laughable musical farce, called “The Agreeable Surprise.”  The second time I saw “The English Merchant:” which piece has been translated into German, and is known among us by the title of “The Scotchwoman,” or “The Coffee-house.”  I have not yet seen the theatres of Covent Garden and Drury Lane, because they are not open in summer.  The best actors also usually spend May and October in the country, and only perform in winter.  A very few excepted, the comedians whom I saw were certainly nothing extraordinary.  For a seat in the boxes you pay five shillings, in the pit three, in the first gallery two, and in the second or upper gallery, one shilling.  And it is the tenants in this upper gallery who, for their shilling, make all that noise and uproar for which the English play-houses are so famous.  I was in the pit, which gradually rises, amphitheatre-wise, from the orchestra, and is furnished with benches, one above another, from the top to the bottom.  Often and often, whilst I sat there, did a rotten orange, or pieces of the peel of an orange, fly past me, or past some of my neighbours, and once one of them actually hit my hat, without my daring to look round, for fear another might then hit me on my face.  All over London as one walks, one everywhere, in the season, sees oranges to sell; and they are in general sold tolerably cheap, one and even sometimes two for a halfpenny; or, in our money, threepence.  At the play-house, however, they charged me sixpence for one orange, and that noways remarkably good.  Besides this perpetual pelting from the gallery, which renders an English play-house so uncomfortable, there is no end to their calling out and knocking with their sticks till the curtain is drawn up.  I saw a miller’s, or a baker’s boy, thus, like a huge booby, leaning over the rails and knocking again and again on the outside, with all his might, so that he was seen by everybody, without being in the least ashamed or abashed.  I sometimes heard, too, the people in the lower or middle gallery quarrelling with those of the upper one.  Behind me, in the pit, sat a young fop, who, in order to display his costly stone buckles with the utmost brilliancy, continually put his foot on my bench, and even sometimes upon my coat, which I could avoid only by sparing him as much space from my portion of the seat as would make him a footstool.  In the boxes, quite in a corner, sat several servants, who were said to be placed there to keep the seats for the families they served till they should arrive; they seemed to sit remarkably close and still, the reason of which, I was told, was their apprehension of being pelted; for if one of them dares but to look out of the box, he is immediately saluted with a shower of orange peel from the gallery.  In Foote’s “Nabob” there are sundry local and personal satires which are entirely lost to a foreigner.  The character of the Nabob was performed by a Mr. Palmer.  The jett of the character is, this Nabob, with many affected airs and constant aims at gentility, is still but a silly fellow, unexpectedly come into the possession of immense riches, and therefore, of course, paid much court to by a society of natural philosophers, Quakers, and I do not know who besides.  Being tempted to become one of their members, he is elected, and in order to ridicule these would-be philosophers, but real knaves, a fine flowery fustian speech is put into his mouth, which he delivers with prodigious pomp and importance, and is listened to by the philosophers with infinite complacency.  The two scenes of the Quakers and philosophers, who, with countenances full of imaginary importance, were seated at a green table with their president at their head while the secretary, with the utmost care, was making an inventory of the ridiculous presents of the Nabob, were truly laughable.  One of the last scenes was best received: it is that in which the Nabob’s friend and school-fellow visit him, and address him without ceremony by his Christian name; but to all their questions of “Whether he does not recollect them?  Whether he does not remember such and such a play; or such and such a scrape into which they had fallen in their youth?” he uniformly answers with a look of ineffable contempt, only, “No sir!”  Nothing can possibly be more ludicrous, nor more comic.  The entertainment, “The Agreeable Surprise,” is really a very diverting farce.  I observed that, in England also, they represent school-masters in ridiculous characters on the stage, which, though I am sorry for, I own I do not wonder at, as the pedantry of school-masters in England, they tell me, is carried at least as far as it is elsewhere.  The same person who, in the play, performed the school-fellow of the Nabob with a great deal of nature and original humour, here acted the part of the school-master: his name is Edwin, and he is, without doubt, one of the best actors of all that I have seen.  This school-master is in love with a certain country girl, whose name is Cowslip, to whom he makes a declaration of his passion in a strange mythological, grammatical style and manner, and to whom, among other fooleries, he sings, quite enraptured, the following air, and seems to work himself at least up to such a transport of passion as quite overpowers him.  He begins, you will observe, with the conjugation, and ends with the declensions and the genders; the whole is inimitably droll:      “Amo, amas,     I love a lass,     She is so sweet and tender,     It is sweet Cowslip’s Grace     In the Nominative Case.     And in the feminine Gender.”  Those two sentences in particular, “in the Nominative Case,” and “in the feminine Gender,” he affects to sing in a particularly languishing air, as if confident that it was irresistible.  This Edwin, in all his comic characters, still preserves something so inexpressibly good-tempered in his countenance, that notwithstanding all his burlesques and even grotesque buffoonery, you cannot but be pleased with him.  I own, I felt myself doubly interested for every character which he represented. Nothing could equal the tone and countenance of self-satisfaction with which he answered one who asked him whether he was a scholar?  “Why, I was a master of scholars.”  A Mrs. Webb represented a cheesemonger, and played the part of a woman of the lower class so naturally as I have nowhere else ever seen equalled.  Her huge, fat, and lusty carcase, and the whole of her external appearance seemed quite to be cut out for it.  Poor Edwin was obliged, as school-master, to sing himself almost hoarse, as he sometimes was called on to repeat his declension and conjugation songs two or three times, only because it pleased the upper gallery, or “the gods,” as the English call them, to roar out “encore.”  Add to all this, he was farther forced to thank them with a low bow"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5255"],["title","The Book of Good Manners; a Guide to Polite Usage for All Social Functions (#0)"],["body","BOOK OF GOOD MANNERS  A GUIDE TO POLITE USAGE FOR ALL SOCIAL FUNCTIONS  W.

ACCEPTING OR DECLINING INVITATIONS. See INVITATIONS,        ACCEPTING OR DECLINING.    ACCIDENTS. See STREET ETIQUETTE--MEN--ACCIDENTS.    ADDRESS. The address of a person may be stamped        on the stationery.         If the address is stamped, it is not customary        to stamp also the crest or monogram.    ADDRESSING ENVELOPES.    MEN. A man should be addressed as Mr. James        J, Wilson, or James J. Wilson, Esq. Either        the Mr. or the Esq. may be used, but not        the two together.         The title belonging to a man should be        given. It is not customary to use Mr. or        Esq. when Jr. or Sr. is used.    WOMEN. A woman's name should always have        the Miss or Mrs.         A woman should never be given her husband's        official title, as Mrs. Judge Wilson.         If a woman has a title of her own, she        should be addressed as Dr. Minnie Wilson,        when the letter is a professional one. If        a social letter, this should be Miss Minnie        Wilson, or Mrs. Minnie Wilson.    ADDRESSING PERSONS. Young girls should be spoken        of as Minnie Wilson, and not as Miss Minnie,        but are personally addressed as Miss Minnie.        Only the greatest intimacy warrants a man        in addressing a young girl as Minnie.         Parents should introduce their daughter        as My daughter Minnie, but should speak        of them before servants as Miss Minnie.         A married woman should be spoken of as        Mrs. Agnes Wilson, and personally addressed        as Mrs. Wilson.    ADDRESSING AND SIGNING LETTERS. All answers to        invitations should be addressed to the party        issuing them.         Letters to a woman who is a comparative        stranger may begin My dear Mrs. Wilson,        and to a closer acquaintance Dear Mrs.        Wilson.         Letters to a man who is a comparative        stranger may begin My dear Mr. Wilson,        and to a closer acquaintance Dear Mr.        Wilson.         For forms of addressing persons with titles,        as Mayor, see under that title--as, Mayor,        Governor.         The letters may end, Sincerely yours, or        Very truly yours, or I remain yours with        kindest regards.         The signature of a man should be John J.        Wilson or J. Jones Wilson.         An unmarried woman should sign social        letters as Minnie Wilson, and a business letter        as Miss Minnie Wilson. A married woman        should sign a social letter as Agnes Wilson.        In signing a business letter, a married woman        may either sign her name Mrs. Agnes Wilson,        or, preferably,         Agnes Wilson        (Mrs. John Wilson)    AFTERNOON CALLS. These should be made between        three and half-past five, and if possible on        regular at home days.         In making an afternoon call a man should        wear the regulation afternoon dress.    DRESS--MEN. Afternoon dress consists of a        double-breasted frock coat of dark material,        and waistcoat, either single or double-        breasted, of same, or of some fancy material        of late design. The trousers should be of        light color, avoiding of course extremes in        patterns.         White or delicate color linen shirts should        be worn, patent leather shoes, silk hat and        undressed kid gloves of dark color.         Afternoon dress is worn at weddings, afternoon        teas, receptions, garden parties, luncheons,        church funerals, and at all afternoon        functions.           See also EVENING DRESS--MEN. MORNING          DRESS--MEN.    AFTERNOON RECEPTIONS. See AFTERNOON TEAS.   GIVEN BY BACHELORS, See BACHELORS' TEAS.    AFTERNOON TEAS (FORMAL). These are very successful        as a rule, due perhaps to their small expense        and few exactions, and are given with        many purposes: to introduce young women        into society, to allow a hostess to entertain a        number of her friends, to honor some woman        of note, etc.         A formal afternoon tea is one for which        cards have been issued, naming set date.         Awnings and carpet should be provided        from curb to house. A man should be stationed        at the curb to open carriage doors and        call them when the guests leave, and another        African Teas man should be in attendance at the        front door to open it the moment a guest appears        at the top step and to direct him to the dressing-room.         A policeman should be detailed for the occasion        to keep back the onlookers, and should        receive a small fee for his services.         At the door of the drawing-room a man        should ask the name of each guest, which he        announces as the latter enters. The hostess        and those receiving with her should be just        within the door to receive the guests.    CARDS. Each guest should leave a card in the        tray in the hall.         A woman may leave the cards of the men        of her family who have been unable to attend.         Cards should be sent by mail or messenger        by those invited but unable to be present, and        should be timed so that they reach the house        during the function.         A husband and wife each send a card when        the invitation is issued in the name of the        hostess only, and two cards each when issued        in the name of hostess and her daughter. If        issued in the name of both husband and        wife, a husband should send two and his wife        should send one card.    DAUGHTERS. The daughters who have passed        the debutante age usually stand for an hour        beside their mother to receive the guests,        and afterward mingle with the guests to help        to make the function a success.    DEBUTANTE. When a tea is given in honor of        a debutante, she stands beside the hostess        (usually her mother), and each guest is introduced        to her. Flowers should be liberally        provided, and friends may contribute on such        an occasion.         The host and the men all wear the regulation        afternoon dress.         Women wear costumes appropriate to the        afternoon, more elegant in proportion to the        elaborateness of the function.         Guests may suit their convenience in        arriving, provided they do not come at the        opening hour nor at the very end.         After leaving their wraps in the dressing-        rooms, guests enter the drawing-room, leaving        their cards in the tray in the hall, and        then giving their names to the man at the        door, who announces them.         On entering the room, the women precede        the men.         After greeting the hostess and being introduced        to those receiving with her, the guests        move into the middle of the room.         Guests go the dining-room when they        wish without greeting the hostess.         It is not expected that guests at a large reception        will stay all the afternoon. Twenty        minutes is long enough. It is not necessary        to bid the hostess good-bye when leaving.        If guests take leave of host and hostess,        they should shake hands.         In the dining-room the men, assisted by        the waiters, help the women.         When the reception is a small formal one,        the guests may stay a longer time, and usually        it is better to take leave of the hostess,        unless she is much occupied at the time.    HOST. Except when a newly married couple        give a house-warming or a reception, the host        does not stand beside his wife, but spends        the time in making introductions, and doing        his best to make the function a success.         When some married woman or woman        guest of honor assists his wife to receive, he        should at the proper moment escort her to        the dining-room.    HOSTESS. The hostess and those receiving with        her should be just within the door, ready to        receive each guest as announced.         The hostess shakes hands with each guest,        and introduces them to those receiving with        her.         Friends assisting a hostess to entertain are        generally permitted to invite a few of their        own friends, and their cards are sent with        those of the hostess. A pretty feature is the        presence of a number of young women here        and there in the rooms to assist in receiving        the guests. Music is always appropriate.    HOURS. The hours are from 4 to 7 P.M.    INTRODUCTIONS. The hostess should introduce        her guests to those receiving with her.          See also INTRODUCTION.    INVITATIONS. Engraved invitations are sent a        week or ten days in advance, by mail or messenger.         They are usually issued in the name of the        hostess only, though they may be issued in        the name of both husband and wife.         In place of the visiting-card, an \"At        Home\" card may be used, or cards specially        engraved for the purpose.         When cards are sent to a married couple,        the cards are addressed to both husband and        wife.         Invitations are sent in two envelopes-the        inner one unsealed and bearing the name of        the guest, and the outer one sealed, with, the        street address.    INVITATIONS, ANSWERING. It is not necessary        to accept or decline these invitations, as the        guest accepts by his presence. If unable to        do so, he should send by mail or"]]]
