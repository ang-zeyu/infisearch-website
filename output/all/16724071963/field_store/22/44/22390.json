Then I am sorry to add that Dick had formed the habit of smoking. This cost him considerable, for Dick was rather fastidious about his cigars, and wouldn’t smoke the cheapest. Besides, having a liberal nature, he was generally ready to treat his companions. But of course the expense was the smallest objection. No boy of fourteen can smoke without being affected injuriously. Men are frequently injured by smoking, and boys always. But large numbers of the newsboys and boot-blacks form the habit. Exposed to the cold and wet they find that it warms them up, and the self-indulgence grows upon them. It is not uncommon to see a little boy, too young to be out of his mother’s sight, smoking with all the apparent satisfaction of a veteran smoker.  There was another way in which Dick sometimes lost money. There was a noted gambling-house on Baxter Street, which in the evening was sometimes crowded with these juvenile gamesters, who staked their hard earnings, generally losing of course, and refreshing themselves from time to time with a vile mixture of liquor at two cents a glass. Sometimes Dick strayed in here, and played with the rest.  I have mentioned Dick’s faults and defects, because I want it understood, to begin with, that I don’t consider him a model boy. But there were some good points about him nevertheless. He was above doing anything mean or dishonorable. He would not steal, or cheat, or impose upon younger boys, but was frank and straight-forward, manly and self-reliant. His nature was a noble one, and had saved him from all mean faults. I hope my young readers will like him as I do, without being blind to his faults. Perhaps, although he was only a boot-black, they may find something in him to imitate.  And now, having fairly introduced Ragged Dick to my young readers, I must refer them to the next chapter for his further adventures.     CHAPTER II. JOHNNY NOLAN   After Dick had finished polishing Mr. Greyson’s boots he was fortunate enough to secure three other customers, two of them reporters in the Tribune establishment, which occupies the corner of Spruce Street and Printing House Square.  When Dick had got through with his last customer the City Hall clock indicated eight o’clock. He had been up an hour, and hard at work, and naturally began to think of breakfast. He went up to the head of Spruce Street, and turned into Nassau. Two blocks further, and he reached Ann Street. On this street was a small, cheap restaurant, where for five cents Dick could get a cup of coffee, and for ten cents more, a plate of beefsteak with a plate of bread thrown in. These Dick ordered, and sat down at a table.  It was a small apartment with a few plain tables unprovided with cloths, for the class of customers who patronized it were not very particular. Our hero’s breakfast was soon before him. Neither the coffee nor the steak were as good as can be bought at Delmonico’s; but then it is very doubtful whether, in the present state of his wardrobe, Dick would have been received at that aristocratic restaurant, even if his means had admitted of paying the high prices there charged.  Dick had scarcely been served when he espied a boy about his own size standing at the door, looking wistfully into the restaurant. This was Johnny Nolan, a boy of fourteen, who was engaged in the same profession as Ragged Dick. His wardrobe was in very much the same condition as Dick’s.  “Had your breakfast, Johnny?” inquired Dick, cutting off a piece of steak.  “No.”  “Come in, then. Here’s room for you.”  “I aint got no money,” said Johnny, looking a little enviously at his more fortunate friend.  “Haven’t you had any shines?”  “Yes, I had one, but I shan’t get any pay till to-morrow.”  “Are you hungry?”  “Try me, and see.”  “Come in. I’ll stand treat this morning.”  Johnny Nolan was nowise slow to accept this invitation, and was soon seated beside Dick.  “What’ll you have, Johnny?”  “Same as you.”  “Cup o’ coffee and beefsteak,” ordered Dick.  These were promptly brought, and Johnny attacked them vigorously.  Now, in the boot-blacking business, as well as in higher avocations, the same rule prevails, that energy and industry are rewarded, and indolence suffers. Dick was energetic and on the alert for business, but Johnny the reverse. The consequence was that Dick earned probably three times as much as the other.  “How do you like it?” asked Dick, surveying Johnny’s attacks upon the steak with evident complacency.  “It’s hunky.”  I don’t believe “hunky” is to be found in either Webster’s or Worcester’s big dictionary; but boys will readily understand what it means.  “Do you come here often?” asked Johnny.  “Most every day. You’d better come too.”  “I can’t afford it.”  “Well, you’d ought to, then,” said Dick. “What do you do I’d like to know?”  “I don’t get near as much as you, Dick.”  “Well you might if you tried. I keep my eyes open,—that’s the way I get jobs. You’re lazy, that’s what’s the matter.”  Johnny did not see fit to reply to this charge. Probably he felt the justice of it, and preferred to proceed with the breakfast, which he enjoyed the more as it cost him nothing.  Breakfast over, Dick walked up to the desk, and settled the bill. Then, followed by Johnny, he went out into the street.  “Where are you going, Johnny?”  “Up to Mr. Taylor’s, on Spruce Street, to see if he don’t want a shine.”  “Do you work for him reg’lar?”  “Yes. Him and his partner wants a shine most every day. Where are you goin’?”  “Down front of the Astor House. I guess I’ll find some customers there.”  At this moment Johnny started, and, dodging into an entry way, hid behind the door, considerably to Dick’s surprise.  “What’s the matter now?” asked our hero.  “Has he gone?” asked Johnny, his voice betraying anxiety.  “Who gone, I’d like to know?”  “That man in the brown coat.”  “What of him. You aint scared of him, are you?”  “Yes, he got me a place once.”  “Where?”  “Ever so far off.”  “What if he did?”  “I ran away.”  “Didn’t you like it?”  “No, I had to get up too early. It was on a farm, and I had to get up at five to take care of the cows. I like New York best.”  “Didn’t they give you enough to eat?”  “Oh, yes, plenty.”  “And you had a good bed?”  “Yes.”  “Then you’d better have stayed. You don’t get either of them here. Where’d you sleep last night?”  “Up an alley in an old wagon.”  “You had a better bed than that in the country, didn’t you?”  “Yes, it was as soft as—as cotton.”  Johnny had once slept on a bale of cotton, the recollection supplying him with a comparison.  “Why didn’t you stay?”  “I felt lonely,” said Johnny.  Johnny could not exactly explain his feelings, but it is often the case that the young vagabond of the streets, though his food is uncertain, and his bed may be any old wagon or barrel that he is lucky enough to find unoccupied when night sets in, gets so attached to his precarious but independent mode of life, that he feels discontented in any other. He is accustomed to the noise and bustle and ever-varied life of the streets, and in the quiet scenes of the country misses the excitement in the midst of which he has always dwelt.  Johnny had but one tie to bind him to the city. He had a father living, but he might as well have been without one. Mr. Nolan was a confirmed drunkard, and spent the greater part of his wages for liquor. His potations made him ugly, and inflamed a temper never very sweet, working him up sometimes to such a pitch of rage that Johnny’s life was in danger. Some months before, he had thrown a flat-iron at his son’s head with such terrific force that unless Johnny had dodged he would not have lived long enough to obtain a place in our story. He fled the house, and from that time had not dared to re-enter it. Somebody had given him a brush and box of blacking, and he had set up in business on his own account. But he had not energy enough to succeed, as has already been stated, and I am afraid the poor boy had met with many hardships, and suffered more than once from cold and hunger. Dick had befriended him more than once, and often given him a breakfast or dinner, as the case might be.  “How’d you get away?” asked Dick, with some curiosity. “Did you walk?”  “No, I rode on the cars.”  “Where’d you get your money? I hope you didn’t steal it.”  “I didn’t have none.”  “What did you do, then?”  “I got up about three o’clock, and walked to Albany.”  “Where’s that?” asked Dick, whose ideas on the subject of geography were rather vague.  “Up the river.”  “How far?”  “About a thousand miles,” said Johnny, whose conceptions of distance were equally vague.  “Go ahead. What did you do then?”  “I hid on top of a freight car, and came all the way without their seeing me.* That man in the brown coat was the man that got me the place, and I’m afraid he’d want to send me back.”  * A fact.   “Well,” said Dick, reflectively, “I dunno as I’d like to live in the country. I couldn’t go to Tony Pastor’s or the Old Bowery. There wouldn’t be no place to spend my evenings. But I say, it’s tough in winter, Johnny, ’specially when your overcoat’s at the tailor’s, an’ likely to stay there.”  “That’s so, Dick. But I must be goin’, or Mr. Taylor’ll get somebody else to shine his boots.”  Johnny walked back to Nassau Street, while Dick kept on his way to Broadway.  “That boy,” soliloquized Dick, as Johnny took his departure, “aint got no ambition. I’ll bet he won’t get five shines to-day. I’m glad I aint like him. I couldn’t go to the theatre, nor buy no cigars, nor get half as much as I wanted to eat.—Shine yer boots, sir?”  Dick always had an eye to business, and this remark was addressed to a young man, dressed in a stylish manner, who was swinging a jaunty cane.  “I’ve had my boots blacked once already this morning, but this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5348"],["title","Ragged Dick, Or, Street Life in New York with the Boot-Blacks (#2)"],["body","mud has spoiled the shine.”  “I’ll make ’em all right, sir, in a minute.”  “Go ahead, then.”  The boots were soon polished in Dick’s best style, which proved very satisfactory, our hero being a proficient in the art.  “I haven’t got any change,” said the young man, fumbling in his pocket, “but here’s a bill you may run somewhere and get changed. I’ll pay you five cents extra for your trouble.”  He handed Dick a two-dollar bill, which our hero took into a store close by.  “Will you please change that, sir?” said Dick, walking up to the counter.  The salesman to whom he proffered it took the bill, and, slightly glancing at it, exclaimed angrily, “Be off, you young vagabond, or I’ll have you arrested.”  “What’s the row?”  “You’ve offered me a counterfeit bill.”  “I didn’t know it,” said Dick.  “Don’t tell me. Be off, or I’ll have you arrested.”     CHAPTER III. DICK MAKES A PROPOSITION   Though Dick was somewhat startled at discovering that the bill he had offered was counterfeit, he stood his ground bravely.  “Clear out of this shop, you young vagabond,” repeated the clerk.  “Then give me back my bill.”  “That you may pass it again? No, sir, I shall do no such thing.”  “It doesn’t belong to me,” said Dick. “A gentleman that owes me for a shine gave it to me to change.”  “A likely story,” said the clerk; but he seemed a little uneasy.  “I’ll go and call him,” said Dick.  He went out, and found his late customer standing on the Astor House steps.  “Well, youngster, have you brought back my change? You were a precious long time about it. I began to think you had cleared out with the money.”  “That aint my style,” said Dick, proudly.  “Then where’s the change?”  “I haven’t got it.”  “Where’s the bill then?”  “I haven’t got that either.”  “You young rascal!”  “Hold on a minute, mister,” said Dick, “and I’ll tell you all about it. The man what took the bill said it wasn’t good, and kept it.”  “The bill was perfectly good. So he kept it, did he? I’ll go with you to the store, and see whether he won’t give it back to me.”  Dick led the way, and the gentleman followed him into the store. At the reappearance of Dick in such company, the clerk flushed a little, and looked nervous. He fancied that he could browbeat a ragged boot-black, but with a gentleman he saw that it would be a different matter. He did not seem to notice the newcomers, but began to replace some goods on the shelves.  “Now,” said the young man, “point out the clerk that has my money.”  “That’s him,” said Dick, pointing out the clerk.  The gentleman walked up to the counter.  “I will trouble you,” he said a little haughtily, “for a bill which that boy offered you, and which you still hold in your possession.”  “It was a bad bill,” said the clerk, his cheek flushing, and his manner nervous.  “It was no such thing. I require you to produce it, and let the matter be decided.”  The clerk fumbled in his vest-pocket, and drew out a bad-looking bill.  “This is a bad bill, but it is not the one I gave the boy.”  “It is the one he gave me.”  The young man looked doubtful.  “Boy,” he said to Dick, “is this the bill you gave to be changed?”  “No, it isn’t.”  “You lie, you young rascal!” exclaimed the clerk, who began to find himself in a tight place, and could not see the way out.  This scene naturally attracted the attention of all in the store, and the proprietor walked up from the lower end, where he had been busy.  “What’s all this, Mr. Hatch?” he demanded.  “That boy,” said the clerk, “came in and asked change for a bad bill. I kept the bill, and told him to clear out. Now he wants it again to pass on somebody else.”  “Show the bill.”  The merchant looked at it. “Yes, that’s a bad bill,” he said. “There is no doubt about that.”  “But it is not the one the boy offered,” said Dick’s patron. “It is one of the same denomination, but on a different bank.”  “Do you remember what bank it was on?”  “It was on the Merchants’ Bank of Boston.”  “Are you sure of it?”  “I am.”  “Perhaps the boy kept it and offered the other.”  “You may search me if you want to,” said Dick, indignantly.  “He doesn’t look as if he was likely to have any extra bills. I suspect that your clerk pocketed the good bill, and has substituted the counterfeit note. It is a nice little scheme of his for making money.”  “I haven’t seen any bill on the Merchants’ Bank,” said the clerk, doggedly.  “You had better feel in your pockets.”  “This matter must be investigated,” said the merchant, firmly. “If you have the bill, produce it.”  “I haven’t got it,” said the clerk; but he looked guilty notwithstanding.  “I demand that he be searched,” said Dick’s patron.  “I tell you I haven’t got it.”  “Shall I send for a police officer, Mr. Hatch, or will you allow yourself to be searched quietly?” said the merchant.  Alarmed at the threat implied in these words, the clerk put his hand into his vest-pocket, and drew out a two-dollar bill on the Merchants’ Bank.  “Is this your note?” asked the shopkeeper, showing it to the young man.  “It is.”  “I must have made a mistake,” faltered the clerk.  “I shall not give you a chance to make such another mistake in my employ,” said the merchant sternly. “You may go up to the desk and ask for what wages are due you. I shall have no further occasion for your services.”  “Now, youngster,” said Dick’s patron, as they went out of the store, after he had finally got the bill changed. “I must pay you something extra for your trouble. Here’s fifty cents.”  “Thank you, sir,” said Dick. “You’re very kind. Don’t you want some more bills changed?”  “Not to-day,” said he with a smile. “It’s too expensive.”  “I’m in luck,” thought our hero complacently. “I guess I’ll go to Barnum’s to-night, and see the bearded lady, the eight-foot giant, the two-foot dwarf, and the other curiosities, too numerous to mention.”  Dick shouldered his box and walked up as far as the Astor House. He took his station on the sidewalk, and began to look about him.  Just behind him were two persons,—one, a gentleman of fifty; the other, a boy of thirteen or fourteen. They were speaking together, and Dick had no difficulty in hearing what was said.  “I am sorry, Frank, that I can’t go about, and show you some of the sights of New York, but I shall be full of business to-day. It is your first visit to the city, too.”  “Yes, sir.”  “There’s a good deal worth seeing here. But I’m afraid you’ll have to wait to next time. You can go out and walk by yourself, but don’t venture too far, or you will get lost.”  Frank looked disappointed.  “I wish Tom Miles knew I was here,” he said. “He would go around with me.”  “Where does he live?”  “Somewhere up town, I believe.”  “Then, unfortunately, he is not available. If you would rather go with me than stay here, you can, but as I shall be most of the time in merchants’-counting-rooms, I am afraid it would not be very interesting.”  “I think,” said Frank, after a little hesitation, “that I will go off by myself. I won’t go very far, and if I lose my way, I will inquire for the Astor House.”  “Yes, anybody will direct you here. Very well, Frank, I am sorry I can’t do better for you.”  “Oh, never mind, uncle, I shall be amused in walking around, and looking at the shop-windows. There will be a great deal to see.”  Now Dick had listened to all this conversation. Being an enterprising young man, he thought he saw a chance for a speculation, and determined to avail himself of it.  Accordingly he stepped up to the two just as Frank’s uncle was about leaving, and said, “I know all about the city, sir; I’ll show him around, if you want me to.”  The gentleman looked a little curiously at the ragged figure before him.  “So you are a city boy, are you?”  “Yes, sir,” said Dick, “I’ve lived here ever since I was a baby.”  “And you know all about the public buildings, I suppose?”  “Yes, sir.”  “And the Central Park?”  “Yes, sir. I know my way all round.”  The gentleman looked thoughtful.  “I don’t know what to say, Frank,” he remarked after a while. “It is rather a novel proposal. He isn’t exactly the sort of guide I would have picked out for you. Still he looks honest. He has an open face, and I think can be depended upon.”  “I wish he wasn’t so ragged and dirty,” said Frank, who felt a little shy about being seen with such a companion.  “I’m afraid you haven’t washed your face this morning,” said Mr. Whitney, for that was the gentleman’s name.  “They didn’t have no wash-bowls at the hotel where I stopped,” said Dick.  “What hotel did you stop at?”  “The Box Hotel.”  “The Box Hotel?”  “Yes, sir, I slept in a box on Spruce Street.”  Frank surveyed Dick curiously.  “How did you like it?” he asked.  “I slept bully.”  “Suppose it had rained.”  “Then I’d have wet my best clothes,” said Dick.  “Are these all the clothes you have?”  “Yes, sir.”  Mr. Whitney spoke a few words to Frank, who seemed pleased with the suggestion.  “Follow me, my lad,” he said.  Dick in some surprise obeyed orders, following Mr. Whitney and Frank into the hotel, past the office, to the foot of the staircase. Here a servant of the hotel stopped Dick, but Mr. Whitney explained that he had something for him to do, and he was allowed to proceed.  They entered a long entry, and finally paused before a door. This being opened a pleasant chamber was disclosed.  “Come in, my lad,” said Mr. Whitney.  Dick and Frank entered.     CHAPTER IV. DICK’S NEW SUIT   “Now,” said Mr. Whitney to Dick, “my nephew here is on his way to a boarding-school. He has a suit of clothes in his trunk about half worn. He is willing to give them to you. I think they will look better than those you have on.”  Dick was so astonished that he hardly knew what to say. Presents were something that he knew very little about, never having received any to his knowledge. That so large a gift should be made to him by a stranger seemed very wonderful.  The clothes were brought out, and turned out to be a neat gray suit.  “Before you put them on, my lad, you must"]]]
