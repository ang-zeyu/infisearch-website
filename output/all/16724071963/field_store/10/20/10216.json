CHAPTER FIVE.  PETER MACTAVISH BECOMES AN AMATEUR DOCTOR; CHARLEY PROMULGATES HIS VIEWS OF THINGS IN GENERAL TO KATE; AND KATE WAXES SAGACIOUS.  Shortly after the catastrophe just related, Charley opened his eyes to consciousness, and aroused himself out of a prolonged fainting fit, under the combined influence of a strong constitution and the medical treatment of his friends.  Medical treatment in the wilds of North America, by the way, is very original in its character, and is founded on principles so vague that no one has ever keen found capable of stating them clearly.  Owing to the stubborn fact that there are no doctors in the country, men have been thrown upon their own resources, and as a natural consequence _every_ man is a doctor.  True, there _are_ two, it may be three, real doctors in the Hudson's Bay Company's employment; but as one of these is resident on the shores of Hudson's Bay, another in Oregon, and a third in Red River Settlement, they are not considered available for every case of emergency that may chance to occur in the hundreds of little outposts, scattered far and wide over the whole continent of North America, with miles and miles of primeval wilderness between each.  We do not think, therefore, that when we say there are no doctors in the country, we use a culpable amount of exaggeration.  If a man gets ill, he goes on till he gets better; and if he doesn't get better, he dies.  To avert such an undesirable consummation, desperate and random efforts are made in an amateur way.  The old proverb that \"extremes meet\" is verified.  And in a land where no doctors are to be had for love or money, doctors meet you at every turn, ready to practise on everything, with anything, and all for nothing, on the shortest possible notice.  As may be supposed, the practice is novel, and not unfrequently extremely wild.  Tooth-drawing is considered child's play-- mere blacksmith's work; bleeding is a general remedy for everything, when all else fails; castor oil, Epsom salts, and emetics are the three keynotes, the foundations, and the copestones of the system.  In Red River there is only one _genuine_ doctor; and as the settlement is fully sixty miles long, he has enough to do, and is not always to be found when wanted, so that Charley had to rest content with amateur treatment in the meantime.  Peter Mactavish was the first to try his powers.  He was aware that laudanum had the effect of producing sleep, and seeing that Charley looked somewhat sleepy after recovering consciousness, he thought it advisable to help out that propensity to slumber, and went to the medicine chest, whence he extracted a small phial of tincture of rhubarb, the half of which he emptied into a wineglass, under the impression that it was laudanum, and poured down Charley's throat!  The poor boy swallowed a little, and sputtered the remainder over the bed-clothes.  It may be remarked here that Mactavish was a wild, happy, half-mad sort of fellow--wonderfully erudite in regard to some things, and profoundly ignorant in regard to others. Medicine, it need scarcely be added, was not his _forte_.  Having accomplished this feat to his satisfaction, he sat down to watch by the bedside of his friend.  Peter had taken this opportunity to indulge in a little private practice just after several of the other gentlemen had left the office, under the impression that Charley had better remain quiet for a short time.  \"Well, Peter,\" whispered Mr Kennedy, senior, putting his head in at the door (it was Harry's room in which Charley lay), \"how is he now?\"  \"Oh! doing capitally,\" replied Peter, in a hoarse whisper, at the same time rising and entering the office, while he gently closed the door behind him.  \"I gave him a small dose of physic, which I think has done him good.  He's sleeping like a top now.\"  Mr Kennedy frowned slightly, and made one or two remarks in reference to physic which were not calculated to gratify the cars of a physician.  \"What did you give him?\" he inquired abruptly.  \"Only a little laudanum.\"  \"_Only_, indeed!  It's all trash together, and that's the worst kind of trash you could have given him.  Humph!\" and the old gentleman jerked his shoulders testily.  \"How much did you give him?\" said the senior clerk, who had entered the apartment with Harry a few minutes before.  \"Not quite a wineglassful,\" replied Peter, somewhat subdued.  \"A what!\" cried the father, starting from his chair as if he had received an electric shock, and rushing into the adjoining room, up and down which he raved in a state of distraction, being utterly ignorant of what should be done under the circumstances.  \"Oh dear!\" gasped Peter, turning pale as death.  Poor Harry Somerville fell rather than leaped off his stool, and dashed into the bedroom, where old Mr Kennedy was occupied in alternately heaping unutterable abuse on the head of Peter Mactavish, and imploring him to advise what was best to be done.  But Peter knew not.  He could only make one or two insane proposals to roll Charley about the floor, and see if _that_ would do him any good; while Harry suggested in desperation that he should be hung by the heels, and perhaps it would run out!  Meanwhile the senior clerk seized his hat, with the intention of going in search of Tom Whyte, and rushed out at the door; which he had no sooner done than he found himself tightly embraced in the arms of that worthy, who happened to be entering at the moment, and who, in consequence of the sudden onset, was pinned up against the wall of the porch.  \"Oh, my buzzum!\" exclaimed Tom, laying his hand on his breast; \"you've a'most bu'st me, sir.  W'at's wrong, sir?\"  \"Go for the doctor, Tom, quick! run like the wind.  Take the freshest horse; fly, Tom, Charley's poisoned--laudanum; quick!\"  \"'Eavens an' 'arth!\" ejaculated the groom, wheeling round, and stalking rapidly off to the stable like a pair of insane compasses; while the senior clerk returned to the bedroom, where he found Mr Kennedy still raving, Peter Mactavish still aghast and deadly pale, and Harry Somerville staring like a maniac at his young friend, as if he expected every moment to see him explode, although, to all appearance, he was sleeping soundly, and comfortably too, notwithstanding the noise that was going on around him.  Suddenly Harry's eye rested on the label of the half-empty phial, and he uttered a loud, prolonged cheer.  \"It's only tincture of--\"  \"Wild cats and furies!\" cried Mr Kennedy, turning sharply round and seizing Harry by the collar, \"why d'you kick up such a row, eh?\"  \"It's only tincture of rhubarb,\" repeated the boy, disengaging himself and holding up the phial triumphantly.  \"So it is, I declare,\" exclaimed Mr Kennedy, in a tone that indicated intense relief of mind; while Peter Mactavish uttered a sigh so deep that one might suppose a burden of innumerable tons weight had just been removed from his breast.  Charley had been roused from his slumbers by this last ebullition; but on being told what had caused it, he turned languidly round on his pillow and went to sleep again, while his friends departed and left him to repose.  Tom Whyte failed to find the doctor.  The servant told him that her master had been suddenly called to set a broken leg that morning for a trapper who lived ten miles _down_ the river, and on his return had found a man waiting with a horse and cariole, who carried him violently away to see his wife, who had been taken suddenly ill at a house twenty miles _up_ the river, and so she didn't expect him back that night.  \"An' where has 'e been took to?\" inquired Tom.  She couldn't tell; she knew it was somewhere about the White-horse Plains, but she didn't know more than that.  \"Did 'e not say w'en 'e'd be 'ome?\"  \"No, he didn't.\"  \"Oh dear!\" said Tom, rubbing his long nose in great perplexity.  \"It's an 'orrible case o' sudden and onexpected pison.\"  She was sorry for it, but couldn't help that; and thereupon, bidding him good-morning, shut the door.  Tom's wits had come to that condition which just precedes \"giving it up\" as hopeless, when it occurred to him that he was not far from Mr Kennedy's residence; so he stepped into the cariole again and drove thither.  On his arrival, he threw poor Mrs Kennedy and Kate into great consternation by his exceedingly graphic, and more than slightly exaggerated, account of what had brought him in search of the doctor. At first Mrs Kennedy resolved to go up to Fort Garry immediately, but Kate persuaded her to remain at home, by pointing out that she could herself go, and if anything very serious had occurred (which she didn't believe), Mr Kennedy could come down for her immediately, while she (Kate) could remain to nurse her brother.  In a few minutes Kate and Tom were seated side by side in the little cariole, driving swiftly up the frozen river; and two hours later the former was seated by her brother's bedside, watching him, as he slept, with a look of tender affection and solicitude.  Rousing himself from his slumbers, Charley looked vacantly round the room.  \"Have you slept well, darling?\" inquired Kate, laying her hand lightly on his forehead.  \"Slept--eh! oh yes, I've slept.  I say, Kate, what a precious bump I came down on my head, to be sure!\"  \"Hush, Charley!\" said Kate, perceiving that he was becoming energetic. \"Father said you were to keep quiet--and so do I,\" she added, with a frown.  \"Shut your eyes, sir, and go to sleep.\"  Charley complied by shutting"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21713"],["title","The Young Trawler (#0)"],["body","YOUNG TRAWLER, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  INTRODUCES DEEP-SEA FISHERMEN AND THEIR FAMILIES.  On a certain breezy morning in October--not many years ago--a wilderness of foam rioted wildly over those dangerous sands which lie off the port of Yarmouth, where the _Evening Star_, fishing-smack, was getting ready for sea.  In one of the narrow lanes or \"Rows\" peculiar to that town, the skipper of the smack stood at his own door, grumbling.  He was a broad burly man, a little past the prime of life, but prematurely aged by hard work and hard living.  \"He's always out o' the way when he's wanted, an' always in the way when he's not wanted,\" said the skipper angrily to his wife, of whom he was at the moment taking, as one of his mates remarked, a tender farewell.  \"Don't be hard on him, David,\" pleaded the wife, tearfully, as she looked up in her husband's face.  \"He's only a bit thoughtless; and I shouldn't wonder if he was already down at the smack.\"  \"If he's not,\" returned the fisherman with a frown, as he clenched his huge right hand--and a hard and horny hand it was, from constant grappling with ropes, oars, hand-spikes, and the like--\"if he's not, I'll--\"  He stopped abruptly, as he looked down at his wife's eyes, and the frown faded.  No wonder, for that wife's eyes were soft and gentle, and her face was fair and very attractive as well as refined in expression, though not particularly pretty.  \"Well, old girl, come, I won't be hard on 'im.  Now I'm off,--good-day.\" And with that the fisherman stooped to kiss his wife, who returned the salute with interest.  At the same time she thrust a packet into his hand.  \"What's this, Nell?\"  \"A Testament, David--from me.  It will do your soul good if you will read it.  And the tract wrapped round it is from a lady.\"  The frown returned to the man's face as he growled--\"What lady?\"  \"The lady with the curious name, who was down here last summer for sea-bathing; don't you remember Miss Ruth Dotropy?  It is a temperance tract.\"  David Bright made a motion as though he were about to fling the parcel away, but he thought better of it, and thrust it into the capacious pocket of his rough coat.  The brow cleared again as he left his wife, who called after him, \"Don't be hard on Billy, David; remember he's our only one--and he's not bad, just a little thoughtless.\"  \"Never fear, Nell, I'll make a man of him.\"  Lighting a large pipe as he spoke, the skipper of the _Evening Star_ nodded farewell, and sauntered away.  In another of the narrow lanes of Yarmouth another fisherman stood at his own door, also taking leave of his wife.  This man was the mate-- just engaged--of David Bright's vessel, and very different in some respects from the skipper, being tall, handsome, fresh and young--not more than twenty-four--as well as powerful of build.  His wife, a good-looking young woman, with their first-born in her arms, had bidden him good-bye.  We will not trouble the reader with more of their parting conversation than the last few words.  \"Now, Maggie, dear, whatever you do, take care o' that blessed babby.\"  \"Trust me for that, Joe,\" said Maggie, imprinting a kiss of considerable violence and fervour on the said baby, which gazed at its mother--as it gazed at everything--in blank amazement.  \"An' don't forget to see Miss Ruth, if you can, or send a message to her, about that matter.\"  \"I'll not forget, Joe.\"  The mate of the _Evening Star_ bestowed a parting kiss of extreme gentleness on the wondering infant, and hastened away.  He had not proceeded far when he encountered a creature which filled his heart with laughter.  Indeed Joe Davidson's heart was easily filled with emotions of every kind, for he was an unusually sympathetic fellow, and rather fond of a joke.  The creature referred to was a small boy of thirteen years of age or thereabouts, with a pretty little face, a Grecian little nose, a rose-bud of a mouth, curly fair hair, bright blue eyes, and a light handsome frame, which, however, was a smart, active, and wiry frame.  He was made to look as large and solid as possible by means of the rough costume of a fisherman, and there was a bold look in the blue eyes which told of a strong will.  What amused Joe Davidson most, however, was the tremendous swagger in the creature's gait, and the imperturbable gravity with which he smoked a cigar!  The little fellow was so deeply absorbed in thought as he passed the mate that he did not raise his eyes from the ground.  An irresistible impulse seized on Joe.  He stooped, and gently plucked the cigar from the boy's mouth.  Instantly the creature doubled his little fists, and, without taking the trouble to look so high as his adversary's face, rushed at his legs, which he began to kick and pommel furiously.  As the legs were cased in heavy sea-boots he failed to make any impression on them, and, after a few moments of exhausting effort, he stepped back so as to get a full look at his foe.  \"What d'ee mean by that, Joe Davidson, you fathom of impudence?\" he demanded, with flushed face and flashing eyes.  \"Only that I wants a light,\" answered the mate, pulling out his pipe, and applying the cigar to it.  \"Humph!\" returned the boy, mollified, and at the same time tickled, by the obvious pretence; \"you might have axed leave first, I think.\"  \"So I might.  I ax parding _now_,\" returned Joe, handing back the cigar; \"good-day, Billy.\"  The little boy, gazed after the fisherman in speechless admiration, for the cool quiet manner in which the thing had been done had, as he said, taken the wind completely out of his sails, and prevented his usually ready reply.  Replacing the cigar in the rose-bud, he went puffing along till he reached the house of David Bright, which he entered.  \"Your father's gone, Billy,\" said Mrs Bright.  \"Haste ye after him, else you'll catch it.  Oh! do give up smokin', dear boy.  Good-bye.  God keep you, my darling.\"  She caught the little fellow in a hasty embrace.  \"Hold on, mother, you'll bust me!\" cried Billy, returning the embrace, however, with affectionate vigour.  \"An' if I'm late, daddy will sail without me.  Let go!\"  He shouted the last words as if the reference had been to the anchor of the _Evening Star_.  His mother laughed as she released him, and he ran down to the quay with none of his late dignity remaining.  He knew his father's temper well, and was fearful of being left behind.  He was just in time.  The little smack was almost under weigh as he tumbled, rather than jumped, on board.  Ere long she was out beyond the breakers that marked the shoals, and running to the eastward under a stiff breeze.  This was little Billy's first trip to sea in his father's fishing-smack, and he went not as a passenger but as a \"hand.\"  It is probable that there never sailed out of Yarmouth a lad who was prouder of his position than little Billy of the _Evening Star_.  He was rigged from top to toe in a brand-new suit, of what we may style nautical garments.  His thin little body was made to appear of twice its natural bulk by a broad-shouldered pilot-cloth coat, under which was a thick guernsey.  He was almost extinguished by a large yellow sou'-wester, and all but swallowed up by a pair of sea-boots that reached to his hips.  These boots, indeed, seemed so capacious as to induce the belief that if he did not take care the part of his body that still remained outside of them might fall inside and disappear.  Altogether--what between pride of position, vanity in regard to the new suit, glee at being fairly at sea and doing for himself, and a certain humorous perception that he was ridiculously small--little Billy presented a very remarkable appearance as he stood that day on the deck of his father's vessel, with his little legs straddling wide apart, after the fashion of nautical men, and his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his sea-going coat.  For some time he was so engrossed with the novelty of his situation, and the roll of the crested waves, that his eyes did not rise much higher than the legs of his comparatively gigantic associates; but when curiosity at last prompted him to scan their faces, great was his surprise to observe among them Joe Davidson, the young man who had plucked the cigar from his lips in Yarmouth.  \"What! are _you_ one o' the hands, Joe?\" he asked, going towards the man with an abortive attempt to walk steadily on the pitching deck.  \"Ay, lad, I'm your father's mate,\" replied Joe.  \"But surely _you_ are not goin' as a hand?\"  \"That's just what I am,\" returned Billy, with a look of dignity which was somewhat marred by a heavy lurch causing him to stagger.  \"I'm part owner, d'ee see, an' ready to take command when the old man retires, so you'd better mind your helm, young man, an' steer clear of impudence in future, if you don't want to lead the life of a dog aboard of this here smack.\"  \"I'll try, sir,\" said Joe Davidson, touching his forelock, while a humorous twinkle lit up his bright eyes.  \"Hallo!  Billy!\" shouted the skipper, who was steering; \"come here, boy. You didn't come aboard to idle, you know; I've let you have a good look at the sea all for nothin'.  It's time now that you went to work to larn your duties.  Zulu!\"  The last word caused a woolly head to protrude from the after hatchway, revealing a youth about twice the size of Billy.  Having some drops of black blood in him this lad had been styled Zulu--and, being a handy fellow, had been made cook.  \"Here, take this boy below,\" said the skipper, \"and teach him something--anything you like, so long as you keep him at work.  No idlers allowed on board, you know.\"  \"Yes, sar,\" said Zulu.  Billy was delighted to obey.  He was naturally a smart, active fellow, and not only willing, but proud, to submit to discipline.  He descended a short ladder into the little cabin with which he had become acquainted, as a visitor, when the smack was in port on former occasions.  With Zulu he was also acquainted, that youth"]]]
