Gwen Gascoyne! Gwen! Anybody seen her? I say, have you all gone deaf? Don't you hear me? Where's Gwen? I--want--Gwen--Gascoyne!\"  The speaker--Ida Bridge--a small, perky, spindle-legged Junior, jumped on to the nearest seat, and raising her shrill voice to its topmost pitch, twice shouted the \"Gwen Gascoyne\", with an aggressive energy calculated to make herself heard above the babel of general chatter that pervaded the schoolroom. Her effort, though far from musical, at any rate secured her the notice she desired.  \"Hello, there! Stop that noise! It's like a dog howling!\" irately commanded a girl in spectacles who was cleaning the blackboard.  \"And get down from my desk this minute! Who said you might climb up there?\"  \"Look here, you kid, what are you doing in our classroom?\"  \"Take yourself off at once! Fly! Scoot!\"  The \"kid\", however, stood her ground.  \"Shan't move till you've answered my question,\" she replied with aggravating impudence. \"I want Gwen Gascoyne.\"  \"Why, there she is all the time!\"  \"Where?\"  \"Under your very nose, you stupid baby! Get down from my desk, I tell you!\"  The Junior cast what was intended to be a withering glance before she descended.  \"Gwen Gascoyne, why couldn't you answer when I called you?\" she demanded abruptly.  Gwen paused in the act of sharpening a lead pencil, and eyed the intruder.  \"Who asked you to come in here?\" she retorted.  \"You babes must keep to your own classrooms! Hey, presto! Vanish! And be quick about it!\" interposed Myra Johnson.  \"Shan't! Not till I've spoken to Gwen.\"  \"Cheek!\"  \"Suppress that kid!\"  \"But I've got a message!\" squeaked the babe, as sundry arms of justice thrust her summarily in the direction of the door. \"Oh, I have really--a message for Gwen from Miss Roscoe! She's to go to the library--now!\"  \"Then why couldn't you say so at first?\"  \"You never gave me a chance!\"  Gwen threw the half-sharpened pencil inside her desk and banged down the lid.  \"What does Miss Roscoe want with me?\" she asked in some consternation. \"Are you sure she meant me?\"  A summons from the headmistress rarely boded good fortune to the recipient, and the girls stared at Gwen with interested sympathy.  \"What have you been doing?\" murmured Eve Dawkins.  \"Glad I'm not in your shoes!\" proclaimed Daisy Hurst.  \"Oh, Gwen, I am sorry for you!\" bleated Alma Richardson.  \"I've not been doing anything!\" protested Gwen indignantly. \"You've no need to look at me as if I were a cross between a criminal and a martyr! Here, you babe, what did Miss Roscoe say?\"  \"Only that you're to go to the library; and you'd better be quick, because she said: 'Tell her to come at once!' Said it in her snappiest way, too! I shouldn't be a month about going if I were you. Hello! There's the bell. Ta-ta, I'm off! I wish you luck!\" and Ida Bridge fled to the region of her own classroom, with a grin on her impish face.  Though she might rail at the impudence of the small fry, Gwen was not above taking a hint--headmistresses do not lightly brook being kept waiting--so she started at a run up the passage, turning over in her mind every possible crime which she might unwittingly have committed.  \"Can't remember using the front gate, or not changing my boots, or talking on the stairs, or--oh, wow! Here I am at the library! Well, whatever I've done, I suppose I'm in for it now! I hope she won't absolutely wither me up!\"  So far from looking withering as Gwen entered the room, the Principal wore an unusually encouraging and benign expression. She was a handsome, large, imposing woman, with a stern cast of features, and was held in great awe by the whole school. As a rule, Seniors and Juniors quailed alike under the glance of her keen dark eyes.  \"Come here, Gwen,\" she said blandly, as her pupil stood hesitating near the door. \"I want to have a little talk with you. I've been looking over your reports for the last few weeks, and I find that you've done well--so well, that I consider the standard of the Upper Fourth is too easy for you. I think you ought to be able to manage the work of the Fifth Form, and I'm going to move you there.\"  Gwen stared at Miss Roscoe, too surprised to answer. Such a proposal as a change of Form was absolutely the last thing she could have expected. In the middle of a term it was surely an unprecedented happening. For the moment she scarcely knew whether to be alarmed or flattered at the honour thus thrust upon her.  \"You may find the mathematics a little difficult,\" continued Miss Roscoe; \"but Miss Woodville shall coach you until you've caught up the rest of the class. She can also go over the arrears of Latin translation with you. With that help you shouldn't be so far behind. I've spoken to both Miss Slade and Miss Douglas about it, and they fully agree with me. Do you think yourself you'll be able to manage the work?\"  \"I don't know, I'm sure,\" stammered Gwen. \"I expect I'm behind in maths.--but--\"  \"But you must try your best. I shall trust you to make a great effort. I should be very sorry to have to put you down again. Come with me now, and I'll take you to your new Form.\"  Gwen followed the Principal with her head in a buzzing whirl. It seemed like a dream to be suddenly translated from the Lower School to the Upper. She wished she could have had a little time to get accustomed to the idea: she would have liked a day's preparation at least, so as to think the change over and discuss it at home. Miss Roscoe, however, always did things in a hurry; she never had a moment to waste, and at present she whisked her pupil along the corridor and into the Fifth Form room with almost breathless energy.  \"Here's Gwen Gascoyne, Miss Douglas,\" she announced. \"We'll try if she can manage the work, and I've arranged with Miss Woodville to give her the extra coaching we spoke about. She can bring her books from her old classroom at eleven.\"  Thus saying, she bustled away to take a history lecture, leaving the new member of the Fifth standing in much embarrassment. The eyes of every girl in the room naturally were glued upon Gwen, who felt herself twitching with nervousness under the scrutiny; but Miss Douglas motioned her to an empty desk in the back row, and went on with the lesson as if nothing had happened. I am afraid Gwen was too agitated to absorb much knowledge that morning. She had not brought notebook or pencil with her, and though at Miss Douglas's request her neighbour rather ungraciously lent her a sheet of paper and a stump of pencil, the notes which she took were scrappy and inadequate. She kept stealing peeps at the other girls, but turning away when she met the anything but friendly glances directed at her. The teacher asked her one or two questions, then, seeing that she did not quite grasp the subject, kindly ignored her.  \"Talk of a fish out of water,\" thought Gwen; \"I feel like an eel in a frying pan. I believe these girls are going to be detestable. I shall have to look out for squalls.\"  Nor was she mistaken. At eleven o'clock the storm broke. Directly Miss Douglas had left the room for the interval the seventeen members of the Fifth turned upon the newcomer.  \"What are you doing here, Gwen Gascoyne, I'd like to know?\" demanded Edith Arnold, opening the attack.  \"We don't want any Fourth Form girls foisted on us!\" proclaimed Rachel Hunter.  \"You don't belong to the Upper School!\" urged Charlotte Perry hotly.  \"I didn't yesterday, but I do now,\" retorted Gwen. \"Miss Roscoe's moved me up. Yes--and I mean to stay here, too!\" she added, facing her opponents stubbornly.  \"Miss Roscoe must be mad!\"  \"What can she be thinking of?\"  \"Better go and ask her yourself,\" said Gwen, \"if you think she's likely to listen to you. She isn't generally very ready to enter into explanations.\"  \"But this is monstrous! It's an unheard-of thing!\" exclaimed Louise Mawson excitedly. \"A chit like you to be brought into the Fifth! Why, how old are you?\"  \"Exactly fourteen and a quarter--birthday on July 16th, if you want exact date,\" returned Gwen smartly.  \"Oh!\" \"What a shame!\" \"We shan't stand it!\" rose in such a chorus from all sides that Gwen took the opportunity to make her escape and go to the dressing-room for her lunch. The interval was only ten minutes,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21687"],["title","The Youngest Girl in the Fifth: A School Story (#1)"],["body","she wished both to break the news to her old classmates and to fetch some necessary books from her former desk before the bell rang.  The other members of the Fifth lingered behind in perturbed consultation. They considered they had a just and most pressing grievance. In all the annals of the school such a case had never occurred before. It had been hitherto an inviolable though unwritten law that no one under the age of fifteen should be admitted to the Fifth Form, a law which they had believed as strict as that of the Medes and Persians, and here was the headmistress actually breaking it, and in favour of a girl only fourteen and a quarter. If Miss Roscoe had not brought her herself into the room they would not have credited it.  \"It's abominably unfair!\" broke out Rachel Hunter, a tall girl of sixteen. \"Because my birthday comes on October 4th I had to stop a whole year longer in the Lower School. Yes--though my mother came and begged Miss Roscoe to let me go up!\"  \"Well, you couldn't get moved up on your work, at any rate, Rachel!\" chirped Joan Masters. \"It would have had to be favour in your case.\"  \"That's not the point! It's a different question. If Miss Roscoe makes a rule she ought to stick to it. Why, half the girls in the Form might have come up sooner if it hadn't been for the age limit.\"  \"You're right, and I can't see why Gwen Gascoyne should be so specially noticed.\"  \"She's supposed to be clever, I believe.\"  \"She doesn't look it! Besides, what do we care whether she's clever or not? It's the injustice of the thing that makes me angry. A kid like her amongst us seniors! The idea!\"  \"Miss Roscoe may send Gwen up,\" declared Louise Mawson, \"but she can't make us accept her as one of ourselves. I vote we send her to Coventry.\"  \"We will! She's nothing but a Lower School girl, and we won't tolerate her being imposed upon us!\"  \"She'll be so conceited at finding herself a Senior!\"  \"We'll soon take her pride down, then!\"  \"She'll meet with a few snubs here, I'll undertake to say!\"  \"If Miss Roscoe is going to bring up all the rank and file like that there's no credit in being in the Fifth!\"  \"It's a positive insult to the rest of us!\"  So decided Gwen's new classmates, jealous for the prestige of their Form, and annoyed at the indignity which they considered they were made to suffer in admitting a younger girl among their number. To Gwen or her feelings they gave not a thought. If she met with an unpleasant experience all the better; it might deter Miss Roscoe from repeating the experiment. That the remove was not Gwen's fault, and therefore that it was scarcely fair to visit the headmistress's act upon her innocent head, did not enter into their calculations. Where they consider their rights are concerned schoolgirls rarely hold mercy before justice.  Meantime Gwen, who had gone to break the important tidings to the Upper Fourth, did not find her old friends as responsive as she had expected. They received her communication with marked coldness.  \"Why should you have been moved up, Gwen Gascoyne, and not Daisy, or Aileen, or I?\" enquired Alma Richardson, with a distinctly aggrieved note in her voice.  \"Miss Roscoe always favoured Gwen!\" said Eve Dawkins enviously.  \"You're six months younger than Viola Sutton, so it seems absurd you should be put above her.\"  \"You'll be so grand now, I suppose you won't care to know us!\"  \"It's not fair to the rest of the Form!\"  \"Oh dear! I'm between two fires,\" thought Gwen, as she hastily cleared her possessions from her old desk. \"The Fifth don't want me, and the Fourth are horribly jealous. You're going to have a bad time, Gwen Gascoyne, I'm afraid! I see breakers ahead! Never mind. It's a great honour to be moved up, and Father'll be glad and sympathize, if nobody else does. The work will be pretty stiff: I expect it'll be all I can do to manage it. But I mean to have a jolly good try. I'll show those girls I can do something, though I am the youngest! Oh, I say! I've only just remembered that Winnie'll be the under-mistress. I'll have to call her 'Miss Gascoyne' whenever I speak to her. How perfectly idiotic! I'm sure I shall laugh. I wonder if Miss Roscoe's told her yet? What a surprise it would be for her to come into the room and find me there!\"  \"I wish you'd be quick, Gwen Gascoyne,\" said Eve Dawkins; \"I'm to have your desk as soon as you've moved out. It's a nicer seat than mine.\"  \"Right-o!\" answered Gwen, piling her books on top of her big atlas. \"You're welcome to it, I'm sure. I think you might all have seemed a trifle more sorry to lose me! I don't see any display of pocket handkerchiefs. No, I can't say I'm shedding tears myself unless they're crocodile ones. Please to recollect in future, my dears, when you speak to me, that you're addressing a member of the Upper School! You're only little Junior girls! Ta-ta!\" and with a mock curtsy, in process of which she nearly dropped her pile of books, Gwen retired laughing from the Fourth Form to take her place and try her luck among the Seniors.     CHAPTER II  The Gascoyne Girls   At fourteen and a quarter Gwen Gascoyne was at a particularly difficult and hobbledehoy stage of her development. She was tall for her age, and rather awkward in her manners, apt at present to be slapdash and independent, and decidedly lacking in \"that repose which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere\". Gwen could never keep still for five seconds, her restless hands were always fidgeting or her feet shuffling, or she was twisting in her chair, or shaking back a loose untidy lock that had escaped from her ribbon. Gwen often did her hair without the aid of a looking-glass, but when she happened to use one the reflection of her own face gave her little cause for satisfaction.  \"I'm plain, and there's no blinking the fact,\" she confessed to herself. \"Winnie says I'm variable, and I can look nice when I smile, but I'm afraid no one would trouble to look at me twice. If only I were Lesbia now, or even Beatrice! People talk about the flower of a family--well, I expect I'm the weed, as far as appearances go! I haven't had my fair share in the way of good looks.\"  It certainly seemed hard that Nature, which had been kind to the Gascoynes in that respect, should have dowered her brothers and sisters so liberally, and have left poor Gwen out in the cold. Her bright little face had an attraction all of its own, of which she was quite unconscious, but she was entirely accustomed to stand aside while strangers noticed and admired her younger sister Lesbia. To do Gwen justice, though she might lament her own plainness, it never struck her to be jealous of the others. She was intensely proud of the family reputation for beauty, and even if she could not include herself among \"the handsome Gascoynes\", it certainly gave her a reflected satisfaction to be aware of the epithet.  \"I'm like Daddy,\" she said sometimes; \"nobody ever calls him handsome, but he's a dear all the same--the dearest dear in the world!\"  The Reverend Maurice Gascoyne was curate-in-charge of the church of St. John the Baptist in the little fishing village of Skelwick Bay, on the coast of the North Sea. He was rich in the possession of seven children, but there his luck ended, for his income, as is often the case, was in exactly inverse ratio to the size of his family.  \"The fact is, we're as poor as church mice,\" said Beatrice one day. \"Indeed, I think we're poorer, because the mouse we saw in church last Sunday, that scared Winnie so, was very fat and sleek and prosperous looking, and didn't bear out the old saying at all.\"  For the last four years, ever since pretty Mrs. Maurice Gascoyne had gently laid down the burden that had grown too heavy for her, Beatrice had been the clever, energetic \"mother\" of the establishment. She managed the house, and the children, and the one maid, and the parish, and her father, all included, with a business-like capacity far in advance of her twenty years. She was a fine-looking girl, tall and straight-limbed and ample, with blue eyes and dark brows, and a clear creamy skin, and that air of noble strength about her which the Greek sculptors gave to their statues of Artemis. Though she did her best both for home and hamlet, Beatrice often chafed against the narrowness of her limits. It was a sore point that she had been obliged to leave school at sixteen, and devote herself to domestic pursuits, and while not regretting the sacrifice, she often lamented the two years lopped off her education.  \"I'm so behind, I never could go in even for the matric. now,\" she sighed sometimes. \"If I could have realized my ambition, I'd have studied for a lady doctor.\"  Since the profession of medicine was utterly and entirely out of the question, Beatrice often consoled herself by planning that when the children were old enough to do without her, she would go as a nurse to a big London hospital, and rise to be a ward sister, or perhaps--who knew?--even a matron. In the meanwhile her talent for administration had to confine itself within the bounds of the Parsonage and the parish, where it was apt to become just a trifle dictatorial and overbearing. It is so hard for a young, keen, ardent nature, anxious to set the world right, to remember that infinite patience must go hand in hand with our best endeavours, and that the time of sowing is an utterly different season from that of harvest.  Between Gwen and Beatrice there was often friction. The former resented being ordered about by a sister of only twenty, and would prove rebellious on occasion. Really, the two girls' dispositions were much alike, but Beatrice's early position of responsibility had turned into strength of character what was at present mere manifestation of independence and often bravado in Gwen.  Winnie, a sweet-tempered, pretty girl of eighteen, had just been made an under-mistress at \"Rodenhurst\", Miss Roscoe's school, which she and Gwen and Lesbia attended daily. Teaching was not at all"]]]
