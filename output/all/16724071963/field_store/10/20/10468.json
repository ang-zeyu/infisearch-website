Little & Ives Co. New York     THE CREATION OF WOMAN   This old Oriental legend is so exquisitely charming, so superior to the Biblical narrative of the creation of woman, that it deserves to be reproduced in WOMAN: HER SEX AND LOVE LIFE. There are several variants of this legend, but I reproduce it as it appeared in the first issue of THE CRITIC AND GUIDE, January, 1903.      At the beginning of time, Twashtri--the Vulcan of Hindu     mythology--created the world. But when he wished to create a     woman, he found that he had employed all his materials in the     creation of man. There did not remain one solid element. Then     Twashtri, perplexed, fell into a profound meditation from which     he aroused himself and proceeded as follows:      He took the roundness of the moon, the undulations of the     serpent, the entwinement of clinging plants, the trembling of     the grass, the slenderness of the rose-vine and the velvet of     the flower, the lightness of the leaf and the glance of the     fawn, the gaiety of the sun's rays and tears of the mist, the     inconstancy of the wind and the timidity of the hare, the vanity     of the peacock and the softness of the down on the throat of the     swallow, the hardness of the diamond, the sweet flavor of honey     and the cruelty of the tiger, the warmth of fire, the chill of     snow, the chatter of the jay and the cooing of the turtle dove.      He combined all these and formed a woman. Then he made a present     of her to man. Eight days later the man came to Twashtri, and     said: \"My Lord, the creature you gave me poisons my existence.     She chatters without rest, she takes all my time, she laments     for nothing at all, and is always ill; take her back;\" and     Twashtri took the woman back.      But eight days later the man came again to the god and said: \"My     Lord, my life is very solitary since I returned this creature. I     remember she danced before me, singing. I recall how she glanced     at me from the corner of her eye, how she played with me, clung     to me. Give her back to me,\" and Twashtri returned the woman to     him. Three days only passed and Twashtri saw the man coming to     him again. \"My Lord,\" said he, \"I do not understand exactly how     it is, but I am sure that the woman causes me more annoyance     than pleasure. I beg you to relieve me of her.\"      But Twashtri cried: \"Go your way and do the best you can.\" And     the man cried: \"I cannot live with her!\" \"Neither can you live     without her!\" replied Twashtri.      And the man went away sorrowful, murmuring: \"Woe is me, I can     neither live with nor without her.\"     PREFACE   In the first chapter of this book I have shown, I believe convincingly, why sex knowledge is even more important for women than it is for men. I have examined carefully the books that have been written for girls and women, and I know that it is not bias, nor carping criticism, but strict honesty that forces me to say that I have not found one satisfactory girl's or woman's sex book. There are some excellent books for girls and women on general hygiene; but on sex hygiene, on the general manifestations of the sex instinct, on sex ethics--none. I have attempted to write such a book. Whether I have succeeded--fully, partially or not at all--is not for me to say, though I have my suspicions. But this I know: in writing this book I have been strictly honest with myself, from first page to last. Whether everything I have written is the truth, I do not know. But at least I believe that it is--or I would not have written it. And I can solemnly say that the book is free from any cant, hypocrisy, falsehood, exaggeration or compromise, nor has any attempt been made in any chapter to conciliate the stupid, the ignorant, the pervert, or the sexless.  As in all my other books I have used plain, honest English. Not any plainer than necessary, but plain enough to avoid obscurity and misconception.  Science and art are both necessary to human happiness. This is not the place to discuss the relative importance of the two. And, while I have no patience with art-for-art's-sake, I recognize that the scientist can not be put into a narrow channel and ordered to go into a certain definite direction. Scientific investigations which seemed aimless and useless have sometimes led to highly important results, and I would not disparage science for its own sake. It has its uses. Nevertheless I personally have no use for it. To me everything must have a direct human purpose, a definite human application. When the cup of human life is so overflowing with woe and pain and misery, it seems to me a narrow dilettanteism or downright charlatanism to devote one's self to petty or bizarre problems which can have no relation to human happiness, and to prate of self-satisfaction and self-expression. One can have all the self-expression one wants while doing useful work.  And working for humanity does not exclude a healthy hedonism; not the narrow Cyrenaic, but an enlightened altruistic hedonism. And in writing this book I have kept the human problem constantly before my eyes. It was not my ambition merely to impart interesting facts: my concern was the practical application of these facts, their relation to human happiness.  If this book should be instrumental, as I confidently trust it will, in destroying some medieval superstitions, in dissipating some hampering and cramping errors, in instilling some hope in the hearts of the hopeless, in bringing a little joy into the homes of the joyless, in increasing in however slight a degree the sum total of human happiness, its mission shall have been gloriously fulfilled.  For this is the mission of the book: to increase the sum total of human happiness.                                                 W.J.R.     12 Mount Morris Park W.,     New York City.
