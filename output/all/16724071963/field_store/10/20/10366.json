In a few minutes they gained it, and, after uttering a shout of defiance, ran up into the bushes and disappeared.  Meanwhile the \"Firefly's\" boat made straight for the dhow, and was soon near enough to hail.  \"Heave-to,\" cried an interpreter in Arabic.  \"Speak your own mother tongue and I'll answer ye,\" replied Disco.  \"Heave-to, or I'll sink you,\" shouted Mr Small, who was in charge.  \"I'm just agoin' to do it, sir,\" replied Disco, running the dhow into the wind until the sail shook.  Another moment and the boat was alongside.  \"Jump aboard and handle the sail, lads; I can't help 'ee no further,\" said Disco.  The invitation was unnecessary.  The moment the two boats touched, the blue-jackets swarmed on board, cutlass in hand, and took possession.  \"Why, what!--where did _you_ come from?\" asked the lieutenant, looking in profound astonishment at Harold and his companion.  \"We are Englishmen, as you see,\" replied Harold, unable to restrain a smile; \"we have been wrecked and caught by the villains who have just escaped you.\"  \"I see--well, no time for talking just now; cut them loose, Jackson. Make fast the sheet--now then.\"  In a few minutes the dhow ranged up alongside the \"Firefly,\" and our heroes, with the poor slaves, were quickly transferred to the man-of-war's deck, where Harold told his tale to Captain Romer.  As we have already stated, there were a number of slaves on board the \"Firefly,\" which had been rescued from various Arab dhows.  The gang now received on board made their numbers so great that it became absolutely necessary to run to the nearest port to discharge them.  We have already remarked on the necessity that lies on our cruisers, when overladen with rescued slaves, to run to a distant port of discharge to land them; and on the readiness of the slave-traders to take advantage of their opportunity, and run north with full cargoes with impunity when some of the cruisers are absent; for it is not possible for a small fleet to guard upwards of a thousand miles of coast effectually, or even, in any degree, usefully.  If we possessed a port of discharge--a British station and settlement--on the mainland of the east coast of Africa, this difficulty would not exist.  As it is, although we place several men-of-war on a station, the evil will not be cured, for just in proportion as these are successful in making captures, will arise the necessity of their leaving the station for weeks at a time unguarded.  Thus it fell out on the occasion of which we write.  The presence of the large slave-freight on board the man-of-war was intolerable.  Captain Romer was compelled to hurry off to the Seychelles Islands.  He sailed with the monsoon, but had to steam back against it.  During this period another vessel, similarly freighted, had to run to discharge at Aden. The seas were thus comparatively clear of cruisers.  The Arabs seized their opportunity, and a stream of dhows and larger vessels swept out from the various creeks and ports all along the East African coast, filled to overflowing with slaves.  Among these were the four large dhows of our friend Yoosoof.  Having, as we have seen, made a slight sacrifice of damaged and unsaleable goods and chattels, in order to clear the way, he proceeded north, touching at various ports where he filled up his living cargo, and finally got clear off, not with goods damaged beyond repair, but with thousands of the sons and daughters of Africa in their youthful prime.  In the interior each man cost him about four yards of cotton cloth, worth a few pence; each woman three yards, and each child two yards, and of course in cases where he stole them, they cost him nothing.  On the coast these would sell at from 8 pounds to 12 pounds each, and in Arabia at from 20 pounds to 40 pounds.  We mention this to show what strong inducement there was for Yoosoof to run a good deal of risk in carrying on this profitable and accursed traffic.  But you must not fancy, good reader, that what we have described is given as a specimen of the _extent_ to which the slave-trade on that coast is carried.  It is but as a specimen of the _manner_ thereof.  It is certainly within the mark to say that at least thirty thousand natives are annually carried away as slaves from the east coast of Africa.  Sir Bartle Frere, in addressing a meeting of the chief native inhabitants of Bombay in April 1873, said,--\"Let me assure you, in conclusion, that what you have heard of the horrors of the slave-trade is in no way exaggerated.  We have seen so much of the horrors which were going on that we can have no doubt that what you read in books, which are so often spoken of as containing exaggerations, is exaggerated in no respect.  The evil is much greater than anything you can conceive. Among the poorer class of Africans there is nothing like security from fathers and mothers being put to death in order that their children may be captured;\"--and, referring to the _east coast alone_, he says that--\"thirty thousand, or more, human beings, are exported every year from Africa.\"  Dr Livingstone tells us that, on the average, about one out of every five captured human beings reaches the coast alive.  The other four perish or are murdered on the way, so that the thirty thousand annually exported, as stated by Sir Bartle Frere, represents a loss of 150,000 human beings _annually_ from the east coast alone, altogether irrespective of the enormous and constant flow of slaves to the north by way of the White Nile and Egypt.  Yoosoof's venture was therefore but a drop in the vast river of blood which is drained annually from poor Africa's veins--blood which flows at the present time as copiously and constantly as it ever did in the days of old--blood which cries aloud to God for vengeance, and for the flow of which _we_, as a nation, are far from blameless.    CHAPTER FOUR.  IN WHICH OUR HEROES SEE STRANGE SIGHTS AT ZANZIBAR, AND RESOLVE UPON TAKING A BOLD STEP.  Before proceeding to the Seychelles, the `Firefly' touched at the island of Zanzibar, and there landed our hero Harold Seadrift and his comrade in misfortune, Disco Lillihammer.  Here, one brilliant afternoon, the two friends sat down under a palm-tree to hold what Disco called a palaver.  The spot commanded a fine view of the town and harbour of Zanzibar.  We repeat that the afternoon was brilliant, but it is right to add that it required an African body and mind fully to appreciate the pleasures of it.  The sun's rays were blistering, the heat was intense, and the air was stifling.  Harold lay down and gasped, Disco followed his example, and sighed.  After a few minutes spent in a species of imbecile contemplation of things in general, the latter raised himself to a sitting posture, and proceeded slowly to fill and light his pipe. Harold was no smoker, but he derived a certain dreamy enjoyment from gazing at Disco, and wondering how he could smoke in such hot weather.  \"We'll get used to it I s'pose, like the eels,\" observed Disco, when the pipe was in full blast.  \"Of course we shall,\" replied Harold; \"and now that we have come to an anchor, let me explain the project which has been for some days maturing in my mind.\"  \"All right; fire away, sir,\" said the sailor, blowing a long thin cloud from his lips.  \"You are aware,\" said Harold, \"that I came out here as supercargo of my father's vessel,\" (Disco nodded), \"but you are not aware that my chief object in coming was to see a little of the world in general, and of the African part of it in particular.  Since my arrival you and I have seen a few things, which have opened up my mind in regard to slavery; we have now been a fortnight in this town, and my father's agent has enlightened me still further on the subject, insomuch that I now feel within me an intense desire to make an excursion into the interior of Africa; indeed, I have resolved to do so, for the purpose of seeing its capabilities in a commercial point of view, of observing how the slave-trade is conducted at its fountain-head, and of enjoying a little of the scenery and the sport peculiar to this land of Ham.\"  \"W'y, you speaks like a book, sir,\" said Disco, emitting a prolonged puff, \"an' it ain't for the likes me to give an opinion on that there; but if I may make bold to ax, sir, how do you mean to travel--on the back of a elephant or a ry-noceris?--for it seems to me that there ain't much in the shape o' locomotives or 'busses hereabouts--not even cabs.\"  \"I shall go in a canoe,\" replied Harold; \"but my reason for broaching the subject just now is, that I may ask if you are willing to go with me.\"  \"There's no occasion to ax that sir; I'm your man--north or south, east or west, it's all the same to me.  I've bin born to roll about the world, and it matters little whether I rolls ashore or afloat--though I prefers the latter.\"  \"Well, then, that's settled,\" said Harold, with a look of satisfaction; \"I have already arranged with our agent here to advance me what I require in the way of funds, and shall hire men and canoes when we get down to the Zambesi--\"  \"The Zam-wot, sir?\"  \"The Zambesi; did you never hear of it before?\"  \"Never, nor don't know wot it is, sir.\"  \"It is a river; one of the largest on the east coast, which has been well described by Dr Livingstone, that greatest of travellers, whose chief object in travelling is, as he himself says, to raise the negroes out of their present degraded condition, and free them from the curse of slavery.\"  \"That's the man to _my_ mind,\" said Disco emphatically; \"good luck to him.--But w'en d'you mean to start for the Zambizzy, sir?\"  \"In a few days.  It will take that time to get everything ready, and our money packed.\"  \"Our money packed!\" echoed the sailor, with a look of surprise, \"w'y, wot d'ye mean!\"  \"Just what I say.

BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  TREATS OF SHIPS IN GENERAL.  There is, perhaps, no contrivance in the wide world more wonderful than a ship--a full-rigged, well-manned, gigantic ship!  Those who regard familiar objects in art and nature as mere matters of course, and do not trouble themselves to wander out of the beaten track of everyday thought, may not at first feel the force or admit the truth of this statement.  Let such folk endeavour to shake themselves vigorously out of this beaten track of everyday thought.  Let them knit their brows and clench their teeth, and gaze steadfastly into the fire, or up at the sky, and try to realise what is involved in the idea of--a ship.  What would the men of old have said, if you had told them that you intended to take yonder large wooden house, launch it upon the sea, and proceed in it out of sight of land for a few days?  \"Poor fellow,\" they would have replied, \"you are mad!\"  Ah! many a wise philosopher has been deemed mad, not only by men of old, but by men of modern days.  This \"mad\" idea has long since been fulfilled; for what is a ship but a wooden house made to float upon the sea, and sail with its inmates hither and thither, at the will of the guiding spirit, over a trackless unstable ocean for months together?  It is a self-sustaining movable hotel upon the sea.  It is an oasis in the desert of waters, so skilfully contrived as to be capable of advancing against wind and tide, and of outliving the wildest storms--the bitterest fury of winds and waves.  It is the residence of a community, whose country for the time being is the ocean; or, as in the case of the _Great Eastern_ steamship, it is a _town_ with some thousands of inhabitants launched upon the deep.  Ships are, as it were, the electric sparks of the world, by means of which the superabundance of different countries is carried forth to fill, reciprocally, the voids in each.  They are not only the media of intercourse between the various families of the human race, whereby our shores are enriched with the produce of other lands, but they are the bearers of inestimable treasures of knowledge from clime to clime, and of gospel light to the uttermost ends of the earth.  But for ships, we should never have heard of the wonders of the coral isles and the beauties of the golden South, or the phenomena and tempests of the icy North.  But for ships, the stirring adventures and perils of Magellan, Drake, Cook, etcetera, had never been encountered; and even the far-famed Robinson Crusoe himself had never gladdened, and saddened, and romantically maddened the heart of youth with his escapes, his fights, his parrots, and his philosophy, as he now does, and as he will continue to do till the end of time.  Some account, then, of ships and boats, with anecdotes illustrative of the perils to which they are frequently exposed, cannot fail, we think, to prove interesting to all, especially to boys, for whose particular edification we now write.  Boys, of all creatures in this world, are passionately fond of boats and ships; they make them of every shape and size, with every sort of tool, and hack and cut their fingers in the operation, as we know from early personal experience.  They sail them, and wet their garments in so doing, to the well-known sorrow of all right-minded mammas.  They lose them, too, and break their hearts, almost, at the calamity.  They make little ones when they are little, and big ones when they grow big; and when they grow bigger they not unfrequently forsake the toy for the reality, embark in some noble craft, and wed the stormy sea.  A word in your ear, reader, at this point.  Do not think that because you fall in love with a _ship_ you will naturally and necessarily fall in love with the _sea_!  Some do, and some don't: with those who do, it is well; with those who don't, and yet go to sea, it is remarkably ill. Think _philosophically_ about \"going to sea,\" my lads.  Try honestly to resist your own inclination _as long as possible_, and only go if you find that _you can't help it_!  In such a case you will probably find that you are cut out for it--not otherwise.  We love the sea with a true and deep affection, and often have we tossed upon her foam-topped waves; but we don't wish to be a sailor--by no manner of means!  And now, boys, come along, and we will conduct you as pleasantly and profitably as we can from a ship's cradle, through all her stormy existence, to her grave.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE EARLIEST DAYS OF WATER-TRAVELLING.  Once upon a time there were no ships.  Men did not know the meaning of the word; they did not want them; and, for many, many centuries the sea-gulls had the ocean all to themselves.  But _boats_ are of very ancient date.  Doubtless the _first_ boats must have been constructed by the _first_ men who dwelt on the earth.  They consisted, probably--for we are now in the land of conjecture--of stumps of fallen trees, or bundles of rushes, seated astride of which the immediate descendants of our first parents ferried themselves over small lakes and across rivers.  Wet feet are not agreeable under any circumstances.  We can conceive that prolonged voyages performed in this fashion--say several hundred yards or a mile--rendered those primitive mariners so uncomfortable, that they resolved to improve their condition; and, after much earnest thought, hit upon the plan of fastening several logs together by means of twigs, and thus they formed _rafts_.  As time progressed, and men began to display wisdom in making tools of stone and in the moulding of metal, we can imagine that they soon bethought themselves of flattening the surface of their rafts; and then, finding them unwieldy and difficult to manage, no doubt, they hit upon the idea of hollowing out the logs.  Adzes were probably not invented at that time, so they betook themselves to the element of fire--which is at the present day used by savage nations for the same purpose--and burned out the insides of their logs.  Thus _canoes_ sprang into being.  But such canoes were clumsy and heavy, besides being liable to split; men therefore bethought themselves of constructing a light framework of wood, which they covered with bark or skin.  Then artificers in iron invented saws; logs were ripped up; planks were formed; pitch oozed ready to hand from the trees; with grass, perchance, they caulked the seams;--and soon the first _boat_ floated on the water--clumsy and tub-like, no doubt, but serviceable withal--and youths of a hundred years old, and full-grown men of two or three hundred, capered and shouted on the shore with delight at the great invention; while venerable patriarchs, of seven or eight hundred summers, gazed in wonder, with almost prophetic solemnity, and exclaimed that they had never before seen the like of _that_ in all the course of their long, long lives!  Those times are old now--so old that men can scarcely get their minds to realise how old they are; nevertheless, the craft that were used then are used even now, and that not only among the savages of distant lands, but by men living at our very doors.  The _coracle_, a basket-boat of the most primitive description, is still occasionally met with in South Wales.  It is neither more nor less than a large wicker basket covered with a hide, and is tub-shaped, and clumsy to a degree.  When the Romans invaded Britain, this species of boat was in common use.  Like the canoe of the North American Indian, it is easily upset, and we should think must be rather unmanageable; but as we are not likely ever again to be reduced to it in this country, we can afford to regard its faults with indifference.  From little boats to big boats there is but a step; and no doubt rivers were soon navigated, and new countries explored, while those who lived near the sea-coast dared even to launch their boats upon the ocean; but they \"hugged the shore,\" undoubtedly, and seldom ventured to proceed at night unless the stars shone brightly in the sky.  Years rolled on, and dwellers on the sea-coast became more and more venturous in their voyages along the shore.  It behoved them to have larger boats, or barges, with numerous rowers, who would naturally carry weapons with them to guard themselves from foes.  War-galleys sprang into being.  Strong winds sometimes carried these off-shore, and out of sight of land.  Ah, reader! who can conceive the feelings of the first mariners who saw the solid land sink on the horizon, and beheld nothing substantial in all the waste of waters, save their own tiny bark that reeled beneath them on the heaving billows?  Perchance these first adventurers on the deep found their way back to land, and afterwards tried the bold experiment of steering by the stars.  Perhaps not; but at length it did come about that ships were built, and men were found bold enough to put to sea in them for days and weeks together.  The ark is the first ship of which we have any authentic account.  We now leave the region of conjecture; for the ark was built by Noah under the immediate direction of the Almighty, and we have a minute account of it in the Bible.  More than two thousand three hundred years before our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ came to earth, man's wickedness had attained to such a height that God resolved to destroy the inhabitants of the world by a deluge.  But, in the midst of wrath, God remembered mercy.  He spared Noah and his family, and saved them from destruction by placing them in the ark along with pairs of the lower animals.  Every reader of the Bible knows the story of the deluge; but everyone may not be aware that traditions of this deluge are found in every part of the earth.  East, west, north, and south--civilised and savage--all men tell us of a great flood which once covered the world, and from which only one family was saved, in a boat, or a canoe, or an ark.
