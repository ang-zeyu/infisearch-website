Sedate and strong-minded though she was, Nellie could not help shrieking as she went over; but the shriek given by Mrs Mitford was tenfold more piercing.  It was of a nature that defies description.  Its effect was to thrill the heart of every one who heard it.  But Peggy did more than shriek.  Springing on the rail like an antelope, she would have plunged overboard to the rescue of her friend, regardless of her own inability to swim, and of everything else, had not a seaman, who chanced to be listening to the conversation--caught her with a vice-like grip.  \"Hold on, Peggy!\" he cried.  But Peggy shrieked and struggled, thus preventing the poor fellow from attempting a rescue, while shouts and cries of \"man overboard\" rang through the ship from stem to stern, until it became known that it was a woman.  Then the cries redoubled.  In the midst of the hubbub the strong but calm voice of the captain was heard to give orders to lower a boat and port the helm--\"hard a-port.\"  But, alas! for poor Nellie that night if her life had depended on shouters, strugglers, shriekers, or boatmen.  At the moment the accident happened two men chanced to be standing on the starboard side of the ship--one on the quarter-deck, the other on the forecastle.  Both men were ready of resource and prompt in action, invaluable qualities anywhere, but especially at sea!  The instant the cry arose each sprang to and cut adrift a life-buoy.  Each knew that the person overboard might fail to see or catch a buoy in the comparative darkness.  He on the forecastle, who chanced to see Nellie fall over, at once followed her with the life-buoy in his arms.  Ignorant of this act the man near the stern saw something struggling in the water as the ship flew past.  Without an instant's hesitation he also plunged into the sea with a life-buoy in his grasp.  The faint light failed to reveal who had thus boldly plunged to the rescue, but the act had been observed both at bow and stern, and a cheer of hope went up as the ship came up to the wind, topsails were backed, and the boat was dropped into the water.  Twenty minutes elapsed before there was any sign of the boat returning, during which time the ship's bell was rung continually.  It may be better imagined than described the state of poor Bob Massey, who had been asleep on a locker in the fore-cabin when the accident occurred, and who had to be forcibly prevented, at first, from jumping into the sea when he heard that it was Nellie who was overboard.  At last oars were heard in the distance.  \"Stop that bell! boat ahoy!\" shouted the captain.  \"Ship aho-o-oy!\" came faintly back on the breeze, while every voice was hushed and ear strained to listen, \"All right! all saved!\"  A loud \"Thank the Lord!\" burst from our coxswain's heaving chest, and a wild ringing cheer leaped upwards alike from passengers and crew, while warm tears overflowed from many an eye that was more intimate with cold spray, for a noble deed and a life saved have always the effect of stirring the deepest enthusiasm of mankind.  A few minutes more and three dripping figures came up the gangway. First came Nellie herself; dishevelled and pale, but strong and hearty nevertheless, as might be expected of a fisher-girl and a lifeboat coxswain's wife!  She naturally fell into, or was caught up by, her husband's arms, and was carried off to the cabin.  Following her came two somewhat exhausted men.  The cheer that greeted them was not unmingled with surprise.  \"The best an' the worst men i' the ship!\" gasped Joe Slag, amid laughter and hearty congratulations.  He was probably right, for it was the young Wesleyan minister and Ned Jarring who had effected this gallant rescue.  The performance of a good action has undoubtedly a tendency to elevate, as the perpetration of a bad one has to demoralise.  From that day forward Black Ned felt that he had acquired a certain character which might be retained or lost.  Without absolutely saying that he became a better man in consequence, we do assert that he became more respectable to look at, and drank less!  Thus the voyage progressed until the good ship _Lapwing_ sailed in among some of the innumerable islands of the Southern seas.    STORY ONE, CHAPTER 6.  Darkness, whether physical, mental, or spiritual, is probably the greatest evil that man has had to contend with since the fall.  At all events, the physical and mental forms of it were the cause of the good ship _Lapwing_ sailing one night straight to destruction.  It happened thus.  A pretty stiff breeze, amounting almost to half a gale, was blowing on the night in question, and the emigrant ship was running before it under close-reefed topsails.  For some days previously the weather had been \"dirty,\" and the captain had found it impossible to obtain an observation, so that he was in the dark as to the exact part of the ocean, in which he was sailing.  In an open sea this is not of serious moment, but when one is nearing land, or in the neighbourhood of islands, it becomes cause for much anxiety.  To make matters worse, the ship had been blown considerably out of her course, and, worst of all, the night was so intensely dark that it was not possible to see more than a few yards beyond the flying jibboom.  The captain and mate, with several of the men, stood on the forecastle peering anxiously out into the darkness.  \"I don't like the look o' things at all,\" muttered the captain to the chief mate.  \"Perhaps it would be well, sir, to lay-to till daylight,\" suggested the mate.  Whether the captain agreed with his chief officer or not was never known, for just then a dull sound was heard which sent a thrill to the bravest heart on board.  \"Breakers ahead!\" cried the look-out, as in duty bound, but he was instantly contradicted by the mate, who shouted that they were on the starboard beam, while another voice roared that they were on the port-bow.  The helm was instantly put hard a-port, and immediately after the order was given \"hard a-starboard,\" for it was discovered that the sound of breakers came from both sides of the vessel.  They were, obviously, either running in a narrow strait between two islands, or into a bay. In the first case the danger was imminent, in the second case, destruction was almost inevitable.  \"Clear the anchor, and stand by to let go!\" cried the captain, in loud sharp tones, for he felt that there was no room to turn and retreat. The order was also given to take in all sail.  But before either order could be obeyed, a cry of terror burst from many throats, for right in front of them there suddenly loomed out of the darkness an object like a great black cloud, which rose high above and seemed about to fall upon them.  There was no mistaking its nature, however, for by that time the roar of the breakers right ahead told but too plainly that they were rushing straight upon a high perpendicular cliff.  At this moment the vessel struck a rock.  It was only a slight touch at the stern, nevertheless it tore the rudder away, so that the intention of the captain to put about and take his chance of striking on the rocks to starboard was frustrated.  \"Let go,\" he shouted, in this extremity.  Quick as lightning the anchor went to the bottom but with such way on the ship, the sudden strain snapped the chain, and the _Lapwing_ rushed upon her doom, while cries of terror and despair arose from the passengers, who had by that time crowded on deck.  To the surprise of the captain, and those who were capable of intelligent observation, the ship did not immediately strike again, but sailed straight on as if right against the towering cliffs.  Still onward it went, and as it did so there settled around them a darkness so profound that no one could see even an inch before his eyes.  Then at last the ill-fated vessel struck, but not with her hull, as might have been expected.  High up above them a terrific crash was heard.  \"God help us,\" exclaimed the captain, \"we've sailed straight into a cave!\"  That he was right soon became evident, for immediately after the crashing of the topmasts against the roof of the cave, a shower of small stones and several large fragments fell on the deck with a rattle like that of musketry.  Some of the people were struck and injured, though not seriously so, by the shower.  \"Get down below, all of you!\" cried the captain, himself taking shelter under the companion hatchway.  But the order was needless, for the danger was so obvious that every one sought the shelter of the cabins without delay.  The situation was not only terrible but exceedingly singular, as well as trying, for as long as stones came thundering down on the deck it would have been sheer madness to have attempted to do anything aboveboard, and to sit idle in the cabins with almost certain death staring them in the face, was a severe test of endurance.  From the motion of the vessel several facts could be deduced.  Although the scraping and crashing of the masts overhead told eloquently of destruction going on in that direction, the heaving of the ship, and her striking occasionally on either side, proved that there was deep water below her.  That they were not progressing into an interminable cavern was made evident by the frequent plunging of the shattered bowsprit against the inner end of the cave.  This action sent the vessel reeling backwards, as it were, every time she struck, besides shattering the bowsprit.  That the cave, also, was open to the full force of the sea was only too severely proved by the rush of the billows into it, and the frequent and severe shocks to which they were in consequence subjected. These shocks had extinguished the lamps, and it was only by the aid of a few candles that they were delivered from sitting in absolute darkness.  In these awful circumstances the young Wesleyan proved that, besides the courage that he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21726"],["title","Deep Down, a Tale of the Cornish Mines (#0)"],["body","DOWN, A TALE OF THE CORNISH MINES, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  BEGINS THE STORY WITH A PECULIAR MEETING.  Necessity is the mother of invention.  This is undoubtedly true, but it is equally true that invention is not the only member of necessity's large family.  Change of scene and circumstance are also among her children.  It was necessity that gave birth to the resolve to travel to the end of the earth--of English earth at all events--in search of fortune, which swelled the bosom of yonder tall, well-favoured youth, who, seated uncomfortably on the top of that clumsy public conveyance, drives up Market-Jew Street in the ancient town of Penzance.  Yes, necessity--stern necessity, as she is sometimes called--drove that youth into Cornwall, and thus was the originating cause of that wonderful series of events which ultimately led to his attaining--but hold!  Let us begin at the beginning.  It was a beautiful morning in June, in that period of the world's history which is ambiguously styled \"Once-upon-a-time,\" when the \"Kittereen\"--the clumsy vehicle above referred to--rumbled up to the Star Inn and stopped there.  The tall, well-favoured youth leapt at once to the ground, and entered the inn with the air of a man who owned at least the half of the county, although his much-worn grey shooting costume and single unpretentious portmanteau did not indicate either unusual wealth or exalted station.  In an off-hand hearty way, he announced to landlord, waiters, chambermaids, and hangers-on, to all, indeed, who might choose to listen, that the weather was glorious, that coaches of all kinds, especially Kittereens, were detestable machines of torture, and that he meant to perform the remainder of his journey on foot.  He inquired the way to the town of St. Just, ordered his luggage to be forwarded by coach or cart, and, with nothing but a stout oaken cudgel to encumber him, set out on his walk of about seven miles, with the determination of compensating himself for previous hours of forced inaction and constraint by ignoring roads and crossing the country like an Irish fox-hunter.  Acting on the presumptuous belief that he could find his way to any part of the world with the smallest amount of direction, he naturally missed the right road at the outset, and instead of taking the road to St. Just, pursued that which leads to the Land's End.  The youth, as we have observed, was well-favoured.  Tall, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, and athletic, with an active step, erect gait, and clear laughing eye, he was one whom a recruiting-sergeant in the Guards would have looked upon with a covetous sigh.  Smooth fair cheeks and chin told that boyhood was scarce out of sight behind, and an undeniable _some thing_ on the upper lip declared that manhood was not far in advance.  Like most people in what may be termed an uncertain stage of existence, our hero exhibited a variety of apparent contradictions.  His great size and muscular strength and deep bass voice were those of a man, while the smooth skin, the soft curling hair, and the rollicking gladsome look were all indicative of the boy.  His countenance, too, might have perplexed a fortune-teller.  Sometimes it was grave almost to sternness, at other times it sparkled with delight, exhibiting now an expression that would have befitted a sage on whose decisions hung the fate of kingdoms, and anon displaying a dash of mischief worthy of the wildest boy in a village school.  Some of the youth's varied, not to say extravagant, actions and expressions, were perhaps due to the exhilarating brilliancy of the morning, or to the appearance of those splendid castles which his mind was actively engaged in building in the air.  The country through which he travelled was at first varied with trees and bushes clothed in rich foliage; but soon its aspect changed, and ere long he pursued a path which led over a wide extent of wild moorland covered with purple heath and gorse in golden-yellow bloom.  The ground, too, became so rough that the youth was fain to confine himself to the highroad; but being of an explorative disposition, he quickly diverged into the lanes, which in that part of Cornwall were, and still are, sufficiently serpentine and intricate to mislead a more experienced traveller.  It soon began to dawn upon the youth's mind that he was wandering in a wrong direction, and when he suddenly discovered a solitary cottage on the right hand, which he had previously observed on the left, he made up his mind to sacrifice his independence and condescend to ask for guidance.  Lightly leaping a wall with this intent, he crossed two fields, and stooped as he looked in at the low doorway of the cottage, from the interior of which there issued the loud cries of a child either in great pain or passion.  A sturdy little boy seated on a stool, and roaring like a young bull, while an elderly woman tried to comfort him, was the sight which met his gaze.  \"Can you show me the road to St. Just?\" inquired our adventurer.  \"St. Just, sur?\" said the woman, stepping out in front of the door, \"why, you're on the way to St. Buryan, sure.  Ef you do keep on the right of the hill over theere, you'll see the St. Just road.\"  A yell of unparalleled ferocity issued at this moment from the cottage, and it was found that the noisy urchin within, overcome by curiosity, had risen to ascertain who the stranger outside could be, and had been arrested by a pang of agony.  \"Aw dear, aw dear, my poor booy,\" exclaimed the woman, endeavouring gently to press the boy down again on the stool, amid furious roaring.  \"What's wrong with him?\" asked our traveller, entering the apartment.  \"He's tumbled off the wall, dear booy, an' semen to me he's scat un shoulder very bad.\"  \"Let me have a look at him,\" said the youth, sitting down on the edge of a bed which stood at one end of the room, and drawing the child between his knees.  \"Come, little man, don't shout so loud; I'll put it all right for you.  Let me feel your shoulder.\"  To judge from the immediate result, the young man seemed to put it all wrong instead of \"all right,\" for his somewhat rough manipulation of the boy's shoulder produced such a torrent of screams that the pitying woman had much ado to restrain herself from rushing to the rescue.  \"Ah!\" exclaimed the youth in grey, releasing his victim; \"I thought so; he has broken his collar-bone, my good woman; not a serious matter, by any means, but it will worry him for some time to come.  Have you got anything to make a bandage of?\"  \"Sur?\" said the woman.  \"Have you a bit of rag--an old shirt or apron?--anything will do.\"  The woman promptly produced a cotton shirt, which the youth tore up into long strips.  Making a pad of one of these, he placed it under the boy's arm-pit despite of sobs and resistance.  This pad acted as a fulcrum on which the arm rested as a lever.  Pressing the elbow close to the boy's side he thus forced the shoulder outwards, and, with his left hand, set the bone with its two broken ends together.  To secure it in this position he bound the arm pretty firmly to the boy's body, so that he could not move a muscle of the left arm or shoulder.  \"There,\" said the youth, assisting his patient to put on his shirt, \"that will keep all straight.  You must not on any account remove the bandage for some weeks.\"  \"How long, sur?\" exclaimed the woman in surprise.  \"For some weeks; but that will depend on how the little fellow gets on. He may go about and use his right arm as he pleases, but no more climbing on walls for some time to come.  Do you hear, little man?\"  The urchin, whose pain was somewhat relieved, and who had moderated down to an occasional deep sob, said \"Iss.\"  \"You're a doctor, sur, I think?\" said the woman.  \"Yes, I am; and I'll come to see you again, so be careful to attend to my directions.  Good-morning.\"  \"Good mornin', sur, an' thank 'ee!\" exclaimed the grateful dame as the youth left the house, and, leaping the low enclosure in front of it, sped over the moor in the direction which had been pointed out to him.  His resolution to ignore roads cost our traveller more trouble than he had anticipated, for the moor was very rugged, the brambles vexatious, and the spines of the gorse uncommonly sharp.  Impediments of every kind were more numerous than he had been accustomed to meet with even on the heath-clad hills of Scotland, with which--although \"the land of the mountain and the flood\" was not that of his birth--he had from childhood been familiar.  After a good deal of vigorous leaping and resolute scrambling, he reached one of those peculiar Cornish lanes which are so deeply sunk in the ground, and edged with such high solid walls, that the wayfarer cannot in many places see the nature of the country through which he is passing.  The point at which he reached the lane was so overgrown with gorse and brambles that it was necessary to search for a passage through them.  This not being readily found, he gave way to the impetuosity of his disposition, stepped back a few paces, cleared the obstacles with a light bound, and alighted on the edge of the bank, which gave way under his weight, and he descended into the lane in a shower of stones and dust, landing on his feet more by chance than by dexterity.  A shout of indignation greeted the traveller, and, turning abruptly round, he beheld a stout old gentleman stamping with rage, covered from head to foot with dust, and sputtering out epithets of opprobrium on the hapless wight who had thus unintentionally bespattered him.  \"Ugh! hah! you young jackanapes--you blind dumbledory--ugh!  What mean you by galloping over the country thus like a wild ass--eh?\"  A fit of coughing here interrupted the choleric old gentleman, in the midst of which our hero, with much humility of demeanour, many apologies, and protestations of innocence of intention to injure, picked up the old gentleman's hat, assisted him to brush his clothes with a"]]]
