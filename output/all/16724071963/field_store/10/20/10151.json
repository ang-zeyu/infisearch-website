Deep tranquillity reigned on the shores of Lake Winnipeg during the midnight hours, for the voices of the frogs served rather to accent than to disturb the calm.  Stars twinkled at their reflections in the water, which extended like a black mirror to the horizon.  They gave out little light, however, and it was not until the upper edge of the full moon arose that surrounding objects became dimly visible.  The pale light edged the canoe, silvered the rocks, tipped the rushes, and at last, touching the point of Ian's upturned nose, awoke him.  (See Frontispiece).  He leaped up with a start instantly, conscious of his situation, and afraid lest he had slept too long.  \"Hi! leve! leve! awake! up!\" he exclaimed in a vigorous undertone.  Victor growled, turned on his other side with a deep sigh, wanted to be let alone, became suddenly conscious, and sprang up in alarm.  \"We're too late!\"  \"No, we're not, Vic.  The moon is just rising, but we must be stirring. Time's precious.\"  Victor required no urging.  He was fully alive to the situation.  A few minutes sufficed to get the canoe ready and roll up their blankets, during the performance of which operations they each ate several substantial mouthfuls of pemmican.  Looking carefully round before pushing off the canoe to see that nothing was forgotten, Ian observed some chips of wood on the beach close at hand.  \"See, Vic!\" he said eagerly; \"some one has been here--perhaps the Indian.\"  They examined the chips, which had been recently cut.  \"It's not easy to make out footprints here,\" said Ian, going down on his knees the better to observe the ground; \"and so many settlers and Indians pass from time to time, having little boys with them too, that--.  I say, look here, Vic, this little footmark might or might not be Tony's, but moccasins are so much alike that--\"  \"Out o' the light, man; if you were made o' glass the moon _might_ get through you.  Why, yes, it _is_ Tony's moccasin!\" cried Victor, in eager excitement.  \"I know it by the patch, for I saw Elsie putting it on this very morning.  Look, speak, man! don't you see it?  A square patch on the ball of the right foot!\"  \"Yes, yes; I see it,\" said Ian, going down on his knees in a spirit of semi-worship, and putting his nose close to the ground.  He would fain have kissed the spot that had been pressed by a patch put on by Elsie, but he was \"unromantic,\" and refrained.  \"Now,\" he said, springing up with alacrity, \"that settles the question. At least it shows that there is strong probability of their having taken the left shore of the lake.\"  \"Come along, then, let's after them,\" cried Victor impatiently, pushing off the canoe.  The moment she floated--which she did in about four inches of water-- they stepped swiftly yet gently into her; for bark canoes require tender treatment at all times, even when urgent speed is needful.  Gliding into deep water, they once more dipped their paddles, deep and fast, and danced merrily over the moonlit sea--for a sea Lake Winnipeg certainly is, being upwards of three hundred miles long, and a gathering together of many waters from all parts of the vast wilderness of Rupert's Land.  After two hours of steady work they paused to rest.  \"Now, Ian,\" said Victor, leaning against the wooden bar at his back, and resting his paddle across the canoe, \"Venus tells me that the sun is about to bestir himself, and something within me tells me that empty space is a bad stomachic; so, out with the pemmican bag, and hand over a junk.\"  Ian drew his hunting-knife, struck it into the mass of meat, and chipped off a piece the size of his fist, which he handed to his comrade.  Probably our readers are aware that pemmican is made of dried buffalo meat pounded to shreds and mixed with melted fat.  Being thus half-cooked in the making, it can be used with or without further cookery.  Sewed up in its bag, it will keep good for months, or even years, and is magnificent eating, but requires a strong digestion.  Ian and Victor were gifted with that requisite.  They fed luxuriously.  A draught from the crystal lake went down their unsophisticated throats like nectar, and they resumed their paddles like giants refreshed.  Venus mounted like a miniature moon into the glorious blue.  Her perfect image went off in the opposite direction, for there was not the ghost of a zephyr to ruffle the deep.  Presently the sun followed in her wake, and scattered the battalions of cloudland with artillery of molten gold. Little white gulls, with red legs and beaks, came dipping over the water, solemnly wondering at the intruders.  The morning mists rolling along before the resistless monarch of day confused the visible world for a time, so that between refraction and reflection and buoyant spirits Victor Ravenshaw felt that at last he had found the realms of fairyland, and a feeling of certainty that he should soon rescue his brother filled him with exultation.  But the exultation was premature.  Noon found them toiling on, and still no trace of the fugitives was to be seen.  \"What if we have overshot them?\" said Victor.  \"Impossible,\" answered Ian, \"the shore is too open for that, and I have been keeping a sharp look-out at every bend and bay.\"  \"That may be true, yet Petawanaquat may have kept a sharper look-out, and concealed himself when he saw us coming.  See, here is a creek.  He may have gone up that.  Let us try.  Why! there _is_ a canoe in it. Hup! drive along, Ian!\"  The canoe seemed to leap out of the water under the double impulse, and next moment almost ran down another canoe which was half hidden among the reeds.  In it sat an old Indian named Peegwish, and a lively young French half-breed named Michel Rollin.  They were both well known to our adventurers; old Peegwish--whose chief characteristic was owlishness-- being a frequent and welcome visitor at the house of Ian's father.  \"You 'pears to be in one grand hurray,\" exclaimed Rollin, in his broken English.  Ian at once told the cause of their appearance there, and asked if they had seen anything of Petawanaquat.  \"Yes, oui, no--dat is to say.  Look 'ere!\"  Rollin pushed the reeds aside with his paddle, and pointed to a canoe lying bottom up, as if it had been concealed there.  \"Ve's be come 'ere after duck, an' ve find dat,\" said the half-breed.  An immediate investigation showed that Petawanaquat had forsaken his canoe and taken to the woods.  Ian looked troubled.  Peegwish opened his owlish eyes and looked so solemn that Victor could scarce forbear laughing, despite the circumstances.  It was immediately resolved to give chase.  Peegwish was left in charge of the canoes.  The other three soon found the track of the Red Man and followed it up like blood-hounds.  At first they had no difficulty in following the trail, being almost as expert as Indians in woodcraft, but soon they came to swampy ground, and then to stony places, in which they utterly lost it. Again and again did they go back to pick up the lost trail, and follow it only to lose it again.  Thus they spent the remainder of that day until night put a stop to their exertions and crushed their hopes.  Then, dispirited and weary, they returned to the canoes and encamped beside them.  Peegwish was engaged in roasting a duck when they arrived.  \"What a difference between the evening and the morning,\" said Victor, as he flung himself down beside the fire.  \"Dat is troo, an' vat I has obsarve oftin,\" said Rollin, looking earnestly into a kettle which rested on the fire.  \"Never mind, Vic,\" said Ian heartily, \"we'll be at it again to-morrow, bright and early.  We're sure to succeed in the long-run.  Petawanaquat can't travel at night in the woods any more than we can.\"  Old Peegwish glared at the fire as though he were pondering these sayings deeply.  As he understood little or no English, however, it is more probable that his astute mind was concentrated on the roasting duck.    CHAPTER FOUR.  A DISCOVERY--THE CHASE CONTINUED ON FOOT.  To bound from the depths of despair to the pinnacles of hope is by no means an uncommon experience to vigorous youth.  When Victor Ravenshaw awoke next morning after a profound and refreshing sleep, and looked up through the branches at the bright sky, despondency fled, and he felt ready for anything.  He was early awake, but Peegwish had evidently been up long before him, for that wrinkled old savage had kindled the fire, and was seated on the other side of it wrapped in his blanket, smoking, and watching the preparation of breakfast.  When Victor contemplated his solemn eyes glaring at a roasting duck, which suggested the idea that he had been sitting there and glaring all night, he burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.  \"Come, I say, Vic,\" said Ian, roused by this from a comfortable nap, \"if you were a hyena there might be some excuse for you, but being only a man--forgive me, a boy--you ought to have more sense than to disturb your friends so.\"  \"Oui, yes; dat is troo.  Vraiment, it is too bad,\" growled Rollin, sitting up and stretching himself.  \"Howsomewhatever, it is time to rise.  Oui!\"  \"I should think it was,\" retorted Victor; \"the sun is already up, and you may be sure that Petawanaquat has tramped some miles this morning. Come, Peegwish, close your eyes a bit for fear they jump out.  What have you got to give us, eh?  Robbiboo, ducks, and--no, is it tea?  Well, we _are_ in luck to have fallen in with you.\"  He rested his head on his hand, and lay"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21697"],["title","The Red Man's Revenge: A Tale of The Red River Flood (#5)"],["body","at the savage with a pleased expression, while Rollin rose and went off to cut more firewood.  The robbiboo referred to was a sort of thick soup made of pemmican boiled with flour.  Without loss of time the party applied themselves to it.  When appetite was partially appeased Ian propounded the question, What was to be done?  \"Follow up the trail as fast as we can,\" said Victor promptly.  \"Dat is bon advise,\" observed Rollin.  \"Hand over de duck, Peegvish, an' do try for shut your eyes.  If you vould only vink it vould seem more comfortabler.\"  Peegwish did not smile, but with deepened gravity passed the duck.  \"I'm not so sure of the goodness of the advice,\" said Ian.  \"To go scampering into the woods on a chase that may lead us we know not where or how long, with only a small quantity of provisions and ammunition, and but one gun, may seem energetic and daring, but it may not, perhaps, be wise.\"  Victor admitted that there was truth in that, and looked perplexed.  \"Nevertheless, to give up at this point, and return to the settlement for supplies,\" he said, \"would be to lose the advantage of our quick start.  How are we to get over the difficulty?\"  \"Moi, I can you git out of de difficulty,\" said Rollin, lighting his pipe with a business air.  \"Dis be de vay.  Peegvish et me is out for long hunt vid much pemmican, poodre an' shote.  You make von 'greement vid me et Peegvish.  You vill engage me; I vill go vid you.  You can take vat you vill of our tings, and send Peegvish back to de settlement for tell fat ye bees do.\"  This plan, after brief but earnest consideration, was adopted.  The old Indian returned to Willow Creek with pencil notes, written on birch bark, to old Samuel Ravenshaw and Angus Macdonald, and the other three of the party set off at once to renew the chase on foot, with blankets and food strapped to their backs and guns on their shoulders--for Rollin carried his own fowling-piece, and Victor had borrowed that of Peegwish.  As happened the previous day, they failed several times to find the trail of the fugitives, but at last Ian discovered it, and they pushed forward with renewed hope.  The faint footmarks at first led them deep into the woods, where it was difficult to force a passage; then the trail disappeared altogether on the banks of a little stream.  But the pursuers were too experienced to be thrown off the scent by such a well-known device as walking up stream in the water.  They followed the brook until they came to the place where Petawanaquat had once more betaken himself to dry land.  It was a well-chosen spot; hard and rocky ground, on which only slight impressions could be left, and the wily savage had taken care to step so as to leave as slight a trail as possible; but the pursuers had sharp and trained eyes.  Ian Macdonald, in particular, having spent much of his time as a hunter before setting up his school, had the eyes of a lynx.  He could distinguish marks when his companions could see nothing until they were pointed out, and although frequently at fault, he never failed to recover the trail sooner or later.  Of course they lost much time, and they knew that Petawanaquat must be rapidly increasing the distance between them, but they trusted to his travelling more leisurely when he felt secure from pursuit, and to his being delayed somewhat by Tony, whom it was obvious he had carried for long distances at a stretch.  For several days the pursuers went on with unflagging perseverance and ever-increasing hope, until they at last emerged from the woods, and began to traverse the great prairie.  Here the trail diverged for a considerable distance southward, and then turned sharply to the west, in which direction it went in a straight line for many miles, as if Petawanaquat had made up his mind to cross the Rocky Mountains, and throw poor Tony into the Pacific!  The travellers saw plenty of game--ducks, geese, plover, prairie-hens, antelopes, etcetera,--on the march, but they were too eager in the pursuit of the savage to be turned aside by smaller game.  They merely shot a few ducks to save their pemmican.  At last they came to a point in the prairie which occasioned them great perplexity of mind and depression of spirit.  It was on the evening of a bright and beautiful day--one of those days in which the air seems fresher and the sky bluer, and the sun more brilliant than usual.  They had found, that evening, that the trail led them away to the right towards one of the numerous clumps of woodland which rendered that part of the prairie more like a nobleman's park than a wild wilderness.  On entering the bushes they perceived that there was a lakelet embosomed like a gem in the surrounding trees.  Passing through the belt of woodland they stood on the margin of the little lake.  \"How beautiful!\" exclaimed Ian, with a flush of pleasure on his sunburnt face.  \"Just like a bit of Paradise.\"  \"Did you ever see Paradise, that you know so well what it is like?\" asked Victor of his unromantic friend.  \"Yes, Vic, I've seen it many a time--in imagination.\"  \"Indeed, and what like was it, and what sort of people were there?\"  \"It was like--let me see--the most glorious scene ever beheld on earth, but more exquisite, and the sun that lighted it was more brilliant by far than ours.\"  \"Not bad, for an unromantic imagination,\" said Victor, with much gravity.  \"Were there any ducks and geese there?\"  \"Yes, ducks; plenty of them, but no _geese_; and nobler game--even lions were there, so tame that little children could lead them.\"  \"Better and better,\" said Victor; \"and what of the people?\"  Ian was on the point of saying that they were all--men, women, and children--the exact counterparts of Elsie Ravenshaw, but he checked himself and said that they were all honest, sincere, kind, gentle, upright, and that there was not a single cynical person there, nor a--  \"Hush! what sort of a bird is that?\" interrupted Victor, laying his hand on Ian's arm and pointing to a small patch of reeds in the lake.  There were so many birds of various kinds gambolling on the surface, that Ian had difficulty in distinguishing the creature referred to.  At last he perceived it, a curious fat-bodied little bird with a pair of preposterously long legs, which stood eyeing its companions as if in contemplative pity.  \"I know it not,\" said Ian; \"never saw it before.\"  \"We'll bag it now.  Stand back,\" said Victor, raising his gun.  The above conversation had been carried on in a low tone, for the friends were still concealed by a bush from the various and numerous birds which disported themselves on the lake in fancied security and real felicity.  The crash of Victor's gun sent them screaming over the tree-tops--all save the fat creature with the long legs, which now lay dead on the water.  \"Go in for it, Rollin, it's not deep, I think,\" said Victor.  \"Troo, but it may be dangeroose for all dat,\" replied the half-breed, leaning his gun against a tree.  \"Howsomewhatever I vill try!\"  The place turned out, as he had suspected, to be somewhat treacherous, with a floating bottom.  Before he had waded half way to the dead bird the ground began to sink under him.  Presently he threw up his arms, went right down, and disappeared.  Both Ian and Victor started forward with the intention of plunging into the water, but they had not reached the edge when Rollin reappeared, blowing like a grampus.  They soon saw that he could swim, and allowed him to scramble ashore.  This misadventure did not prevent them from making further attempts to secure the bird, which Victor, having some sort of naturalistic propensities, was eager to possess.  It was on going round the margin of the lake for this purpose that they came upon the cause of the perplexities before mentioned.  On the other side of a point covered with thick bush they came upon the remains of a large Indian camp, which had evidently been occupied very recently.  Indeed, the ashes of some of the fires, Rollin declared, were still warm; but it was probably Rollin's imagination which warmed them.  It was found, too, that the trail of Petawanaquat entered this camp, and was there utterly lost in the confusion of tracks made everywhere by many feet, both large and small.  Here, then, was sufficient ground for anxiety.  If the savage had joined this band and gone away with it, the pursuers could of course follow him up, but, in the event of their finding him among friends, there seemed little or no probability of their being able to rescue the stolen child. On the other hand, if Petawanaquat had left the Indians and continued his journey alone, the great difficulty that lay before them was to find his point of departure from a band which would naturally send out hunters right and left as they marched along.  \"It's a blue look-out any way you take it,\" remarked poor Victor, with an expression worthy of Peegwish on his countenance.  \"I vish it vas blue.  It is black,\" said Rollin.  Ian replied to both remarks by saying that, whether black or blue, they must make the best of it, and set about doing that at once.  To do his desponding comrades justice, they were quite ready for vigorous action in any form, notwithstanding their despair.  Accordingly, they followed the broad trail of the Indians into the prairie a short way, and, separating in different directions round its margins, carefully examined and followed up the tracks that diverged from it for considerable distances, but without discovering the print of the little moccasin with Elsie's patch, or the larger footprint of Tony's captor.  \"You see, there are so many footprints, some like and some unlike, and they cross and recross each other to such an extent that it seems to me a hopeless case altogether,\" said Victor.  \"You don't propose to give it up, do you?\" asked Ian.  \"Give it up!\" repeated Victor, almost fiercely.  \"Give up Tony?  NO! not as long as I can walk, or even crawl.\"  \"Ve vill crawl before long, perhaps,\""]]]
