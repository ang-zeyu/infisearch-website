I am glad you think as I think on this point, for it is well that man and wife should be agreed in matters of importance.--But to return to Vinland: I have been thinking much about it since I came here, though saying little,--for it becomes a man to be silent and circumspect in regard to unformed plans.  My mind is to go thither next spring, but only on one condition.\"  \"And what may that be?\" asked Gudrid, looking up with a little surprise, and some interest.  \"That you shall go with me, Gudrid; for which end it will be needful that you and I should wed this winter.\"  Gudrid could not help blushing a little and looking down, for Karlsefin, despite his suavity, had a way with him, when thoroughly in earnest, that was very impressive.  She did not hesitate, however, but answered with straightforward candour, \"I will not say nay to that if my brother Leif is willing.\"  \"It is settled then,\" replied Karlsefin decisively, \"for Leif has already told me that he is willing if you are, and so--\"  At this interesting point in the conversation they were interrupted by a loud merry laugh not very far from them, and next moment little Olaf, starting out from behind a bush, ran shouting into Gudrid's extended arms.  \"Oh, what do you think?\" he exclaimed, \"aunt Freydissa has come over from Heriulfness, and is in _such_ a rage because Biarne has told her that Thorward has been making love to his cousin Astrid, and--\"  \"Hush, boy,\" said Gudrid, covering his mouth with her hand, \"you should not talk so of your aunt.  Besides, you know that it is an evil thing to get the name of a tale-bearer.\"  \"I did not think it was tale-bearing,\" replied the lad, somewhat abashed, \"for it is no secret.  Leif was there, and Astrid herself, and all the house-carls in the hall must have heard her, for she spoke very loud.  And oh! you should have seen her give Thorward the cold shoulder when he came in!\"  \"Well, well, Olaf, hold your noisy tongue,\" said Gudrid, laughing, \"and come, tell me how would you like to go to Vinland?\"  \"Like to go to Vinland!\" echoed the boy, turning an ardent gaze full on Karlsefin, \"are you going there, sir?  Will you take _me_?\"  Karlsefin laughed, and said, \"You are too quick in jumping to conclusions, child.  Perhaps I may go there; but you have not yet answered Gudrid's question--would you like to go?\"  \"I would like it well,\" replied Olaf, with a bright look of hopeful expectation that said far more than words could have expressed.  Just then Thorward was seen approaching along the beach.  His brows were knit, his lips pursed, and his eyes fixed on the ground.  He was so engrossed with his thoughts that he did not perceive his friends.  \"Here he comes,\" said Karlsefin--\"in the blues evidently, for he does not see us.\"  \"We had better leave you to his company,\" said Gudrid, laughing; \"a man i' the blues is no pleasure to a woman.--Come, Olaf, you and I shall to the dairy and see how the cattle fare.\"  Olaf's capacity for imbibing milk and cream being unlimited, he gladly accepted this invitation, and followed his aunt, while Karlsefin advanced to meet his friend.  \"How now, Thorward, methinks an evil spirit doth possess thee!\"  \"An evil spirit!\" echoed Thorward, with a wrathful look; \"nay, a legion of evil spirits possess me!  A plague on that fellow Biarne: he has poisoned the ears of Freydissa with lies about that girl Astrid, to whom I have never whispered a sweet word since we landed.\"  \"I trust you have not whispered sour words to her,\" said Karlsefin, smiling.  \"And Freydissa, forsooth, gives me the cold shoulder,\" continued the exasperated Norseman, not noticing the interruption, \"as if I were proved guilty by the mere assertion.\"  \"It is my advice to you, Thorward, that you return the compliment, and give the cold shoulder to Freydissa.  The woman has a shrewish temper; she is a very vixen, and will lead you the life of a dog if you marry her.\"  \"I had rather,\" said Thorward between his teeth, and stamping, \"live a dog's life with Freydissa than live the life of a king without her!\"  Karlsefin laughed at this, and Thorward, taking offence, said fierily, and with some scorn--\"Thinkest thou that because thy Gudrid is so smooth-tongued she is an angel?\"  \"That is what I am inclined to think,\" answered Karlsefin, with a smile that still further exasperated his friend.  \"Perchance you may find yourself mistaken,\" said Thorward.  \"Since you are so free with your warnings, let me remind you that although the course of your courtship runs smooth, there is an old proverb--descended from Odin himself, I believe--which assures us that _true_ love never did so run.\"  \"Then I recall my words, Thorward, and congratulate you on your true love--for assuredly your courtship runs in an uncommonly rugged course.\"  At this Thorward turned on his heel and walked away in a towering passion.  It so happened that, on drawing near to Brattalid, he met Biarne coming in the opposite direction.  Nothing could have pleased him better--for in the state of his mind at the time he would have turned savagely on himself, had that been possible, in order to relieve his feelings.  \"So!\" he cried, confronting Biarne, \"well met!  Tell me, Biarne, didst thou poison the ears of Freydissa by telling her that I had been courting thy cousin Astrid?\"  Biarne, who was not aware of the consequences of what he had said in jest, felt inclined to laugh, but he checked himself and flushed somewhat, not being accustomed to be addressed in such haughty tones. Instead of explaining the matter, as he might otherwise have done, he merely said, \"I did.\"  \"Liar!\" exclaimed Thorward fiercely, for he was a very resolute man when roused; \"go, tell her that the assertion was a falsehood.  Go _now_, and come back to tell me thou hast done it, else will I chop thy carcase into mince-meat.  Go; I will await thee here.\"  He laid his hand upon his sword, but Biarne said quietly, \"I go, sir;\" and, turning round, hastened up to the hamlet.  Thorward could scarcely believe his eyes, for Biarne was fully as stout as himself, and somewhat taller, besides having the look of a courageous man.  He had issued his imperative mandate more as a defiance and challenge than anything else, so that he gazed after the retreating Biarne with mingled feelings of surprise, contempt, and pity; but surprise predominated.  He had not long to wait, however, for in about ten minutes Biarne returned.  \"Well, have you told her?\"  \"I have,\" replied Biarne.  \"Hah!\" exclaimed Thorward, very much perplexed, and not knowing what to say next.  \"But, Thorward,\" said Biarne, after a momentary pause, \"methinks that you and I must fight now.\"  \"With all my heart,\" answered Thorward, much relieved, and again grasping his sword.  \"Nay, not with such weapons,\" said Biarne, stepping up to him, \"but with the weapons of friendship.\"  With that he bestowed such a hearty buffet on Thorward's left ear that it turned the irascible man head over heels, and laid him at full length on the sand.  Thorward rose slowly, being somewhat stunned, with a confused impression that there was something wrong with his head.  Before he had quite recovered, Biarne burst into a laugh and seized him by the hand.  \"Freydissa bids me tell you--\" he said, and paused.  The pause was intentional.  He saw that Thorward was on the point of snatching away his hand and returning the blow or drawing his sword; but he restrained himself in order to hear Freydissa's message.  \"She bids me tell you,\" repeated Biarne, \"that you are a goose.\"  This was not calculated to soothe an angry man, but Thorward reflected that the epithet was figurative, and bore a peculiar signification when uttered by a woman; he therefore continued his self-restraint and waited for more.  \"She also said,\" added Biarne, \"that she never for a moment believed my statement (which, by the way, was only made in jest), and that she thinks you deserve a good buffet on the ear for taking the thing up so hotly.  Agreeing with her entirely in this, I have fulfilled her wish and given you your deserts.  Moreover, she expects you to accompany her to Heriulfness to-night.  So now,\" said Biarne, releasing Thorward's hand and touching his sword-hilt, \"if you are still inclined--.\"  \"Well, well,\" said Thorward, whose visage, while his friend was speaking, had undergone a series of contortions indicative of a wild conflict of feelings in his breast, \"well, well, I am a goose, and deserved the buffet.  After all, I did call you a liar, so we are quits, Biarne--tit for tat.  Come, let us shake hands and go up to Leif's cottage.  You said Freydissa was there, I think.\"  During that winter Karlsefin married Gudrid and Thorward Freydissa, and, in the following spring, they embarked in Karlsefin's ship--with a large party of men, women, children, and cattle--and set sail for Vinland.    CHAPTER FIVE.  FREYDISSA SHOWS HER TEMPER AND A WHALE CHECKS IT--POETICAL AND OTHER TOUCHES.  The expedition which now set out for Vinland was on a much larger scale than any of the expeditions which had preceded it.  Biarne and Leif had acted the part of discoverers only--not colonisers--and although previous parties had passed several winters in Vinland, they had not intended to take up a permanent abode there--as was plain from the fact that they brought neither women nor flocks nor herds with them. Karlsefin, on the contrary, went forth fully equipped for colonisation.  His ship, as we have said, was a large one, with a decked poop and forecastle, fitted to brave the most tempestuous weather--at least as well fitted to do so as were the ships of Columbus--and capable of accommodating more than a hundred people.  He took sixty men with him and five women, besides his own wife and Thorward's.  Thorward himself, and Biarne, accompanied the expedition, and also Olaf--to his inexpressible joy, but Leif preferred to remain at home, and promised to take good care of Thorward's ship, which was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21753"],["title","The Norsemen in the West (#6)"],["body","behind.  Astrid was one of the five women who went with this expedition; the other four were Gunhild, Thora, Sigrid, and Bertha.  Gunhild and Sigrid were wives to two of Biarne's men.  Thora was handmaiden to Gudrid; Bertha handmaid to Freydissa.  Of all the women Bertha was the sweetest and most beautiful, and she was also very modest and good-tempered, which was a fortunate circumstance, because her mistress Freydissa had temper enough, as Biarne used to remark, for a dozen women.  Biarne was fond of teasing Freydissa; but she liked Biarne, and sometimes took his pleasantries well--sometimes ill.  It was intended that, when the colony was fairly established, the ship should be sent back to Greenland to fetch more of the men's wives and children.  A number of cattle, horses, and sheep were also carried on this occasion to Vinland.  These were stowed in the waist or middle of the vessel, between the benches where the rowers sat when at work.  The rowers did not labour much at sea, as the vessel was at most times able to advance under sail.  During calms, however, and when going into creeks, or on landing--also in doubling capes when the wind was not suitable--the oars were of the greatest value.  Karlsefin and the principal people slept under the high poop.  A number of the men slept under the forecastle, and the rest lay in the waist near the cattle--sheltered from the weather by tents or awnings which were called tilts.  It may perhaps surprise some readers to learn that men could venture in such vessels to cross the northern seas from Norway to Iceland, and thence to Greenland; but it is not so surprising when we consider the small size of the vessels in which Columbus afterwards crossed the Atlantic in safety, and when we reflect that those Norsemen had been long accustomed, in such vessels, to traverse the ocean around the coasts of Europe in all directions--round the shores of Britain, up the Baltic, away to the Faroe Islands, and up the Mediterranean even as far as the Black Sea.  In short, the Norsemen of old were magnificent seamen, and there can be no question that much of the ultimate success of Britain on the sea is due, not only to our insular position, but also to the insufficiently appreciated fact that the blood of the hardy and adventurous vikings of Norway still flows in our veins.  It was a splendid spring morning when Karlsefin hoisted his white-and-blue sail, and dropped down Ericsfiord with a favouring breeze, while Leif and his people stood on the stone jetty at Brattalid, and waved hats and shawls to their departing friends.  For Olaf, Thora, and Bertha it was a first voyage, and as the vessel gradually left the land behind, the latter stood at the stern gazing wistfully towards the shore, while tears flowed from her pretty blue eyes and chased each other over her fair round face--for Bertha left an old father behind her in Greenland.  \"Don't cry, Bertha,\" said Olaf, putting his fat little hand softly into that of the young girl.  \"Oh!  I shall perhaps _never_ see him again,\" cried Bertha, with another burst of tears.  \"Yes, you will,\" said Olaf, cheerily.  \"You know that when we get comfortably settled in Vinland we shall send the ship back for your father, and mine too, and for everybody in Ericsfiord and Heriulfness. Why, we're going to forsake Greenland altogether and never go back to it any more.  Oh!  I am _so_ glad.\"  \"I wish, I _wish_ I had never come,\" said Bertha, with a renewed flow of tears, for Olaf's consolations were thrown away on her.  It chanced that Freydissa came at that moment upon the poop, where Karlsefin stood at the helm, and Gudrid with some others were still gazing at the distant shore.  Freydissa was one of those women who appear to have been born women by mistake--who are always chafing at their unfortunate fate, and endeavouring to emulate--even to overwhelm--men; in which latter effort they are too frequently successful.  She was a tall elegant woman of about thirty years of age, with a decidedly handsome face, though somewhat sharp of feature.  She possessed a powerful will, a shrill voice and a vigorous frame, and was afflicted with a short, violent temper.  She was decidedly a masculine woman.  We know not which is the more disagreeable of the two--a masculine woman or an effeminate man.  But perhaps the most prominent feature in her character was her volubility when enraged,--the copiousness of her vocabulary and the tremendous force with which she shot forth her ideas and abuse in short abrupt sentences.  Now, if there was one thing more than another that roused the ire of Freydissa, it was the exhibition of feminine weakness in the shape of tears.  She appeared to think that the credit of her sex in reference to firmness and self-command was compromised by such weakness.  She herself never wept by any chance, and she was always enraged when she saw any other woman relieve her feelings in that way.  When, therefore, she came on deck and found her own handmaid with her pretty little face swelled, or, as she expressed it, \"begrutten,\" and heard her express a wish that she had never left home, she lost command of herself--a loss that she always found it easy to come by--and, seizing Bertha by the shoulder, ordered her down into the cabin instantly.  Bertha sobbingly obeyed, and Freydissa followed.  \"Don't be hard on her, poor soul,\" murmured Thorward.  Foolish fellow!  How difficult it is for man--ancient or modern--to learn when to hold his tongue!  That suggestion would have fixed Freydissa's determination if it had not been fixed before, and poor Bertha would certainly have received \"a hearing,\" or a \"blowing-up,\" or a \"setting down,\" such as she had not enjoyed since the date of Freydissa's marriage, had it not been for the fortunate circumstance that a whale took it into its great thick head to come up, just then, and spout magnificently quite close to the vessel.  The sight was received with a shout by the men, a shriller shout by the women, and a screech of surprise and delight by little Olaf, who would certainly have gone over the side in his eagerness, had not Biarne caught him by the skirts of his tunic.  This incident happily diverted the course of Freydissa's thoughts. Curiosity overcame indignation, and Bertha was reprieved for the time being.  Both mistress and maid hastened to the side of the ship; the anger of the one evaporated and the tears of the other dried up when they saw the whale rise not more than a hundred yards from the ship.  It continued to do this for a considerable time, sometimes appearing on one side, sometimes on the other; now at the stern, anon at the bow.  In short it seemed as if the whale had taken the ship for a companion, and were anxious to make its acquaintance.  At last it went down and remained under water so long that the voyagers began to think it had left them, when Olaf suddenly gave a shriek of delight and surprise:--\"Oh!  Oh!  OH!\" he exclaimed, looking and pointing straight down into the water, \"here is the whale--right under the ship!\"  And sure enough there it was, swimming slowly under the vessel, not two fathoms below the keel--its immense bulk being impressively visible, owing to the position of the observers, and its round eyes staring as if in astonishment at the strange creature above.  [The author has seen a whale in precisely similar circumstances in a Norwegian fiord.] It expressed this astonishment, or whatever feeling it might be, by coming up suddenly to the surface, thrusting its big blunt head, like the bow of a boat, out of the sea, and spouting forth a column of water and spray with a deep snort or snore--to the great admiration of the whole ship's crew, for, although most of the men were familiar enough with whales, alive and dead, they had never, in all probability, seen one in such circumstances before.  Four or five times did the whale dive under the vessel in this fashion, and then it sheered off with a contemptuous flourish of its tail, as if disgusted with the stolid unsociable character of the ship, which seen from a submarine point of view must have looked uncommonly like a whale, and quite as big!  This episode, occurring so early in the voyage, and trifling though it was, tended to create in the minds of all--especially of the women and the younger people--a feeling of interest in the ocean, and an expectation of coming adventure, which, though not well defined, was slightly exciting and agreeable.  Bertha, in particular, was very grateful to that whale, for it had not only diverted her thoughts a little from home-leaving and given her something new to think and talk about, but it had saved her from Freydissa and a severe scold.  The first night at sea was fine, with bright moonlight, and a soft wind on the quarter that carried them pleasantly over the rippling sea, and everything was so tranquil and captivating that no one felt inclined to go to rest.  Karlsefin sat beside the helm, guiding the ship and telling sagas to the group of friends who stood, sat, or reclined on the deck and against the bulwarks of the high poop.  He repeated long pieces of poetry, descriptive of the battles and adventures of their viking forefathers, and also gave them occasional pieces of his own composing, in reference to surrounding circumstances and the enterprise in which they were then embarked,--for Karlsefin was himself a skald or poet, although he pretended not to great attainments in that way.  From where they sat the party on the poop could see that the men on the high forecastle were similarly engaged, for they had gathered together in a group, and their heads were laid together as if listening intently to one of their number who sat in the centre of the circle.  Below, in the waist of the ship, some humorous character appeared to be holding his mates enchained, for long periods of comparative silence--in which could be heard the monotonous tones of a single voice mingled with"]]]
