Jack felt better satisfied about his appearance when he found how dark and shadowy the parlor was; and he felt still better when he saw his father dressed as if he were going over to work at the forge, all but the leather apron.  The elder did not seem disturbed.  He and Mr. Murdoch were talking about all sorts of great disasters, and Mary did not know just when she was drawn into the talk, or how she came to acknowledge having read about so many different things all over the world.  \"Jack,\" whispered his mother, at last, \"you'll have to go to the barn and gather eggs, or we sha'n't have enough for supper.\"  \"I'll bring the eggs if I don't get drowned before I get back,\" said Jack; and he found a basket and an umbrella and set out.  He took advantage of a little lull in the rain, and ran to the barn-yard gate.  \"Hullo!\" he exclaimed.  \"Now I'll have to wade.  Why it's nearly a foot deep!  There'll be the biggest kind of a freshet in the Cocahutchie. Isn't this jolly?\"  The rain pattered on the roof as if it had been the head of a drum.  If the house was gloomy, the old barn was darker and gloomier.  Jack turned over a half-bushel measure and sat down on it.  \"I want to think,\" he said.  \"I want to get out of this.  Seems to me I never felt it so before.  I'd as lief live in this barn as stay in Crofield.\"  He suddenly sprang up and shook off his blues, exclaiming: \"I'll go and see the freshet, anyhow!\"  He carried the eggs into the house.  All the time he had been gone, Elder Holloway had been asking Mary very particularly about the Crofield Academy.  \"I don't wonder she says what she does about the trustees,\" remarked Aunt Melinda.  \"She took the primary room twice, for 'most a month each time, when the teacher was sick, and all the thanks she had was that they didn't like it when they found it out.\"  The gutter in front of the house had now become a small torrent.  \"All the other gutters are just like that,\" said Jack.  \"So are the brooks all over the country, and it all runs into the Cocahutchie!\"  \"Father,\" said Jack, after supper, \"I'm going down to the creek.\"  \"I wish you would,\" said his father.  \"Come back and tell us how it's looking.\"  \"Could a freshet here do any damage?\" asked Mr. Murdoch.  \"There's a big dam up at Four Corners,\" said the blacksmith.  \"If anything should happen there, we'd have trouble here, and you'd have it in Mertonville, too.\"  Jack heard that as he was going out of the door.  He carried an umbrella; but the first thing he noticed was that the force of the rain seemed to have slackened as soon as he was out of doors.  It was now more like mist or a warm sleet, as if Crofield were drifting through a cloud.  \"The Washington House needs all the rain it can get,\" said Jack, as he went along; \"but half the roof is caved in.  I'm glad Livermore's insured.\"  When Jack reached the creek he felt his heart fairly jump with excitement.  The Cocahutchie was no longer a thin ribbon rippling along in a wide stretch of sand and gravel.  It was a turbid, swollen, roaring flood, already filling all the space under its bridge; and the clump of old trees was in the water instead of on dry land.  \"Hurrah!\" shouted Jack.  \"As high as that already, and the worst is to come!\"  He could not see the dam at first, but the gusts of wind were making openings in the mist, and he soon caught glimpses of a great sheet of foaming brown water.  \"I'll go and take a look at the dam,\" he said; and he ran to the mill.  \"It's just level with the dam,\" he said, after one swift glance.  \"I never thought of that.  I must go and tell old Hammond what's coming.\"  The miller's house was not far away, and he and his family were at supper when there came a bang at the door.  Then it opened and Mrs. Hammond exclaimed:  \"Why, John Ogden!\"  \"I'm out o' breath,\" said Jack excitedly.  \"You tell him that the water's 'most up to the lower floor of the mill.  If he's got anything there that'd be hurt by getting wet--\"  \"Goodness, yes!\" shouted the miller, getting up from the table, \"enough to ruin me.  There are sacks of flour, meal, grain,--all sorts of stuff.  It must all go up to the second floor.  I'll call all the hands.\"  \"But,\" said his wife, \"it's Sunday!\"  \"Can't help it!\" he exclaimed; \"the Cocahutchie's coming right up into the mill.  Jack, tell every man you see that I want him!\"  Off went Jack homeward, but he spoke to half a dozen men on the way. He did not run, but he went quickly enough; and when he reached the house there was something waiting for him.  It was a horse with a blanket strapped on instead of a saddle; and by it stood his father, and near him stood his mother and Aunt Melinda and Mary, bareheaded, for it was not raining, now.  \"Mount, Jack,\" said the blacksmith quietly.  \"I've seen the creek. It's only four and a half miles to the Four Corners.  Ride fast.  See how that dam looks and come back and tell me.  Mr. Murdoch will have his buggy ready to start when you get back.  See how many logs there are in the saw-mill boom.\"  \"Oh, Jack!\" exclaimed Mary, in a low suppressed voice.  \"I wish that I were you!  It's a great day for you!\"  He had sprung to the saddle while his father was speaking, and he felt it was out of his power to utter a word in reply.  He did not need to speak to the horse, for the moment Mr. Ogden released the bit there was a quick bound forward.  \"This horse is ready to go,\" said Jack to himself, as he felt that motion.  \"I've seen her before.  I wonder what's made her so excited?\"  There was no need for wonder.  The trim, light-limbed sorrel mare he was riding had been kept in the hotel stables until that day.  She had been taken out to a neighboring stable, at the morning alarm of fire, and when the blacksmith went to borrow her he found her laboring under a strong impression that things in Crofield were going wrong.  She was therefore inclined to go fast, and all that Jack had to do was to hold her in.  The blacksmith's son was at home in the saddle.  It was not yet dark, and he knew the road to the Four Corners.  It was a muddy road, and there was a little stream of water along each side of it. Spattered and splashed from head to foot were rider and horse, but the miles vanished rapidly and the Four Corners was reached.  A smaller village than Crofield, further up among the hills, it had a higher dam, a three times larger pond, a bigger grist-mill, and a large saw-mill.  That was because there were forests of timbers among the yet higher hills beyond, and Mr. Ogden had been thinking seriously about the logs from those forests.  \"I know what father means,\" said Jack aloud, as he galloped into the village.  There were hardly any people stirring about its one long street; but there was a reason for that and Jack found out what it was when he pulled up near the mill.  \"Everybody has come to watch the dam,\" he exclaimed.  \"No use asking about the logs, though; there they are.\"  The crowd was evidently excited, and the air was filled with shouts and answers.  \"The boom got unhitched and swung round 'cross the dam,\" said one eager speaker; \"and there's all the logs, now,--hundreds on 'em,--just a-pilin' up and a-heapin' up on the dam; and when that breaks, the dam'll go, mill and all, bridge and all, and the valley below'll be flooded!\"  The moon was up, and the clouds which had hidden it were breaking away as Jack looked at the threatening spectacle before him.  The sorrel mare was tugging hard at the rein and pawing the mud under her feet, while Jack listened to the talk.  \"Stand it?  No!\" he heard a man say.  \"That dam wasn't built to stand any such crowdin' as that.  Hark!\"  A groaning, straining, cracking sound came from the barrier behind which the foaming flood was widening and deepening the pond.  \"There it goes!  It's breaking!\"  Jack wheeled the sorrel, as a dull, thunderous report was answered by a great cry from the crowd; and then he dashed away down the homeward road.  \"I must get to Crofield before the water does,\" he said.  \"Glad the creek's so crooked; it has twice as far to travel as I have.\"  Not quite, considering how a flood will sweep over a bend instead of following it.  Still, Jack and the sorrel had the start, and nearly all the way it was a downhill road.  The Crofield people gathered fast, after the sky cleared, for a rumor went around that there was something wrong with the dam, and that a man had gone to the Four Comers to warn the people there.  All the men that could crowd into the mill had helped Mr. Hammond get his grain up into the second story, but the water was a hand-breadth deep on the lower floor by the time it was done.  There came a moment when all was silent except the roar of the water, and through that silence the thud of hoofs was heard coming down from Main Street.  Then a shrill, excited voice shouted:  \"All of you get off that bridge!  The Four Corners dam's gone.  The boom's broken, and the logs are coming!\"  There was a tumult of questioning, as men gathered around the sorrel, and there was a swift clearing of people from the bridge.  \"Why, it's shaking now!\" said the blacksmith to Mr. Murdoch.  \"It'll go down with the first log that strikes it.  You drive your best home to Mertonville and warn them.  You may be just in time.\"  Away went the editor, carrying with him an extraordinary treasure of news for the next number of his journal.  Jack dismounted, and her owner took the sorrel to her stable; she was very muddy but none the worse for the service she had rendered.  The crowd stood waiting for what was sure to come.  Miller Hammond was anxiously watching his threatened and already damaged property.  Jack came and stood beside him.  \"Mr. Hammond,\" he said, \"all the gravel that you were going to sell to father is lying under water.\"  \"More than two acres of it,\" said the miller.  \"The water'll run off, though.  I'll tell you what I'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21846"],["title","Crowded Out o' Crofield; or, The Boy who made his Way (#8)"],["body","do, Jack.  I'll sell it for two hundred dollars, considering the flood.\"  \"If father'll take it, will you count in the fifty you said you owed me?\" inquired Jack.  The miller made a wry face for a moment, but then responded, smiling:  \"Well!  After what you've done to-night, too: saved all there was on the first floor,--yes, I will.  Tell him I'll do it.\"  They all turned suddenly toward the dam.  A high ridge of water was sweeping down across the pond.  It carried a crest of foam, logs, planks, and rubbish, shining white in the moonlight, and it rolled on toward the mill and the dam as if it had an errand.  Crash--roar--crash--and a plunging sound,--and it seemed as if the Crofield dam had vanished.  But it had not.  Only a section of its top work, in the middle, had been knocked away by the rushing stroke of those logs.  A frightened shout went up from the spectators, and it had hardly died away before there followed another splintering crash.  \"The bridge!\" shouted Jack.  The frail supports of the bridge, brittle with age and weather, already straining hard against the furious water, needed only the battering of the first heavy logs from the boom, and down they went.  \"Gone!\" exclaimed Mr. Ogden.  \"The hotel's gone, and the meeting-house, and the dam, and the bridge.  There won't be anything left of Crofield, at this rate.\"  \"I'm going to get out of it,\" said Jack.  \"I'll never refuse you again,\" replied his father, with energy.  \"You may get out any way you can, and take your chances anywhere you please. I won't stand in your way.\"  The roar of the surging Cocahutchie was the only sound heard for a full minute, and then the miller spoke.  \"The mill's safe,\" he said, with a very long breath of relief; \"the breaking of that hole in the dam let the water and logs through, and the pond isn't rising.  Hurrah!\"  There was a very faint and scattering cheer, and Jack Ogden did not join in it.  He had turned suddenly and walked away homeward, along the narrow strip of land that remained between the wide, swollen Cocahutchie and the fence.  At the end of the fence, where he came into his own street, away above where the head of the bridge had been, there was a large gathering. That around the mill had been nearly all of men and boys.  Here were women and girls, and the smaller boys, whose mothers and aunts held them and kept them from going nearer the water.  Jack found it of no use to say, \"Oh, mother, I'm too muddy!\"  She didn't care how muddy he was, and Aunt Melinda cared even less, apparently.  Bessie and Sue had evidently been crying; but Mary had not; and it was her hand on Jack's arm that led him away, up the street, toward their gate.  \"Oh, Jack!\" she exclaimed, \"I'm so proud!  Did you ride fast?  I'm glad I can ride!  I could have done it, too.  It was splendid!\"  \"Molly,\" said Jack, \"I don't mind telling you.  The sorrel mare galloped all the way, going and coming, up hill and down; and Molly, I kept wishing and thinking every jump she gave,--wishing I was galloping to New York, instead of to the Four Corners!  \"Molly,\" he added quickly, \"father gives it up and says I may go!\"     CHAPTER VI.  OUT INTO THE WORLD.  Monday morning came, bright and sunshiny; and it hardly reached Crofield before the people began to get up and look about them.  Jack went down to the river and did not get back very soon.  His mind was full of something besides the flood, and he did not linger long at the mill.  But he looked long and hard at all the pieces of land below the mill, down to Deacon Hawkins's line.  He knew where that was, although the fence was gone.  \"The freshet didn't wash away a foot of it,\" he said.  \"I'll tell father what Mr. Hammond said about selling it.\"  A pair of well-dressed men drove down from Main Street in a buggy and halted near him.  \"Brady,\" said one of these men, \"the engineer is right.  We can't change the railroad line.  We can say to the Crofield people that if they'll give us the right of way through the village we'll build them a new bridge.  They'll do it.  Right here's the spot for the station.\"  \"Exactly,\" said the other man, \"and the less we say about it the better.  Keep mum.\"  \"That's just what I'll do, too,\" said Jack to himself, as they drove away.  \"I don't know what they mean, but it'll come out some day.\"  Jack went home at once, and found the family at breakfast.  After breakfast his father went to the shop, and Jack followed him to speak about the land purchase.  When Jack explained the miller's offer, Mr. Ogden went with him to see Mr. Hammond.  After a short interview, Mr. Ogden and Jack secured the land in settlement of the amount already promised Jack, and of an old debt owed by the miller to the blacksmith, and also in consideration of their consenting to a previous sale of the trees for cash to the Bannermans, who had made their offer that morning.  Mr. Hammond seemed very glad to make the sale upon these terms, as he was in need of ready money.  When Jack returned to his father's shop, he remembered the men he had seen at the river, and he told his father what they had said.  \"Station?--right of way?\" exclaimed Mr. Ogden.  \"That's the new railroad through Mertonville.  They'll use up that land, and we won't get a cent.  Well, it didn't cost anything.  I'd about given up collecting that bill.\"  Later that day, Jack came in to dinner with a smile on his face.  It was the old smile, too; a smile of good-humored self-confidence, which flickered over his lips from side to side, and twisted them, and shut his mouth tight.  Just as he was about to speak, his father took a long, neatly folded paper out of his coat pocket and laid it on the table.  \"Look at that, Jack,\" he said; \"and show it to your mother.\"  \"Warranty deed!\" exclaimed Jack, reading the print on the outside. \"Father! you didn't turn it over to me, did you?  Mother, it's to John Ogden, Jr.!\"  \"Oh, John--\" she began and stopped.  \"Why, my dear,\" laughed the blacksmith, cheerfully, \"it's his gravel, not mine.  I'll hold it for him, for a while, but it is Jack's whenever I chose to record that deed.\"  \"I'm afraid I couldn't farm it there,\" said Jack; and then the smile on his face flickered fast.  \"But I knew Father wanted that land.\"  \"It isn't worth much, but it's a beginning,\" said Mary.  \"I'd like to own something or other, or to go somewhere.\"  \"Well, Molly,\" answered Jack, smiling, \"you can go to Mertonville. Livermore says there's a team here, horses and open carriage.  It came over on Friday.  The driver has cleared out, and somebody must take them home, and he wants me to drive over.  Can't I take Molly, Mother?\"  \"You'd have to walk back,\" said his father, \"but that's nothing much. It's less than nine miles--\"  \"Father,\" said Jack, \"you said, last night, I needn't come back to Crofield, right away.  And Mertonville's nine miles nearer the city--\"  \"And a good many times nine miles yet to go,\" exclaimed the blacksmith; but then he added, smiling: \"Go ahead, Jack.  I do believe that if any boy can get there, you can.\"  \"I'll do it somehow,\" said Jack, with a determined nod.  \"Of course you will,\" said Mary.  Jack felt as if circumstances were changing pretty fast, so far as he was concerned; and so did Mary, for she had about given up all hope of seeing her friends in Mertonville.  \"We'll get you ready, right away,\" said Aunt Melinda.  \"You can give Jack your traveling bag,--he won't mind the key's being lost,--and I'll let you take my trunk, and we'll fit you out so you can enjoy it.\"  \"Jack,\" said his father, \"tell Livermore you can go, and then I want to see you at the shop.\"  Jack was so glad he could hardly speak; for he felt it was the first step.  But a part of his feeling was that he had never before loved Crofield and all the people in it, especially his own family, so much as at that minute.  He went over to the ruined hotel, where he found the landlord at work saving all sorts of things and seeming to feel reasonably cheerful over his misfortunes.  \"Jack,\" he said, as soon as he was told that Jack was ready to go, \"you and Molly will have company.  Miss Glidden sent to know how she could best get over to Mertonville, and I said she could go with you. There's a visitor, too, who must go back with her.  \"I'll take 'em,\" said Jack.  Upon going to the shop he found his father shoeing a horse.  The blacksmith beckoned his son to the further end of the shop.  He heard about Miss Glidden, and listened in silence to several hopeful things Jack had to say about what he meant to do sooner or later.  [Illustration: _He listened in silence_.]  \"Well,\" he said, at last, \"I was right not to let you go before, and I've doubts about it now, but something must be done.  I'm making less and less, and not much of it's cash, and it costs more to live, and they're all growing up.  I don't want you to make me any promises. They are broken too easily.  You needn't form good resolutions.  They won't hold water.  There's one thing I want you to do, though.  Your mother and I have brought you up as straight as a string, and you know what's right and what's wrong.\"  \"That's true,\" said Jack.  \"Well, then, don't you promise nor form any resolutions, but if you're tempted to do wrong, or to be a fool in any kind of way, just don't do it that's all.\"  \"I won't, Father,\" said Jack earnestly.  \"There,\" said his father, \"I feel better satisfied than I should feel if you'd promised a hundred things.  It's a great deal better not to do anything that you know to be wrong or foolish.\"  \"I think so,\" said Jack, \"and I won't.\"  \"Go home now and get ready,\" said his father; \"and I'll see you off.\"  \"This is very sudden, Jack,\", said his mother, with much feeling, when he made his appearance.  \"Why, Mother,\" said Jack, \"Molly'll be back soon, and the city isn't so far away after all.\"  Jack felt as if he had only about enough head left to change his clothes and drive the team.  \"It's just as Mother says,\" he thought; \"I've been"]]]
