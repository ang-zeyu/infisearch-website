This accident caused them little loss beyond the canoe, which was soon replaced by another, purchased from a party of Indians, with whom they fell in that same evening.  Passing through Slave River, they swept out on the bright waters of Great Slave Lake.  Over these they sped during several days.  This lake is one of the largest fresh-water oceans of the continent, about 250 miles long and 50 broad.  And here the work of exploration fairly began.  Great Slave Lake was at that time imperfectly known from Indian report; and the river of which they were in search flowed, it was supposed, out of its western extremity.  Here also Monsieur Le Roux was to be left behind with a party of men to prosecute the fur-trade.    CHAPTER FOUR.  VICISSITUDES OF THE VOYAGE--INDIANS MET WITH, ETCETERA.  We have passed over the first three weeks of the voyage rapidly, but it must not be supposed that therefore it was all plain sailing.  On the contrary, the travellers were delayed by thunderstorms, and heavy rains, and gales, and impeded by ice, which, even in the middle of June lay thick on the waters in some parts.  They were also tormented by hosts of mosquitoes, and at times they found difficulty in procuring food-- despite the ability of our friends Reuben, Swiftarrow, and Lawrence, who were constituted hunters to the expedition.  At other times, however, the supply of food was abundant and varied.  On one occasion the hunters brought in seven geese, a beaver, and four ducks, besides which a large supply of excellent trout and other fish was obtained from the nets; and on another occasion they procured two swans, ten beavers, and a goose. But sometimes they returned empty-handed, or with a single bird or so, while the nets produced nothing at all.  Deer were also shot occasionally, and they found immense numbers of wild cranberries, strawberries, rasps, and other berries, besides small spring onions; so that, upon the whole, they fared well, and days of abstinence were more than compensated by days of superabundance.  One evening while they were coasting along this great lake, some Indians were discovered on the shore, and the travellers landed to make inquiries of them as to the nature of the country beyond.  There were three lodges belonging to the Red-knife Indians, who were so named because their knifes were made of the copper found in that region.  To the leading man of these, English Chief, being interpreter, addressed himself.  English Chief, we may remark in passing, was one of the followers of the chief who conducted Hearne on his expedition to the Coppermine River; since which event he had been a principal leader of his countrymen who were in the habit of carrying furs to the English fur-traders at Churchill, on Hudson's Bay, and was much attached to the interest of the Hudson Bay Company, which, at that time, was in opposition to the Canadian or Nor'-West Company.  These circumstances procured him the title of the English Chief.  An able, active, but self-sufficient and somewhat obstinate chief he was, and caused Mackenzie a good deal of anxiety and much trouble to keep him with the party.  In answer to his queries, the principal man of the Red-knife Indians said that there were many more of his tribe a short distance off, and that he would send a man to fetch them.  He also said that the explorers should see no more of them at that time, because the Slave and Beaver Indians, as well as others of the tribe, were about to depart, and would not be in that region again till the time when the swans cast their feathers.  \"Ask him,\" said Mackenzie, \"if he and his friends have many furs to dispose of.\"  To this the Indian replied by at once producing upwards of eight large packs of good beaver and marten skins; and added the information that his friends had plenty more.  \"Now, then, Le Roux,\" said Mackenzie, turning to his clerk, \"here you and I shall part.  This seems a good spot and a good opportunity for opening up the trade with these Indians.  When the rest of them arrive we shall have a palaver, and then you shall remain to look after them, so, open up your packs, and get ready a few small presents without delay.\"  That day was spent in considerable bustle and excitement; the Indians being overjoyed that the white traders had at last penetrated into their country; and their joy being increased by the distribution of such trifling, but much-prized, gifts as glass beads, knives, small looking-glasses, etcetera.  It rained in torrents all the time but this did not damp their spirits; and as for their bodies--they were used to it!  In the afternoon Mackenzie assembled the whole tribe, and made them the following speech, which was translated by English Chief in a very pompous manner, for that excellent red-skin was fully alive to the dignity of his position.  \"My friends,\" began our explorer, \"I am glad to meet with you.  The white man and the Indians are always glad to meet--they can benefit each other mutually.  Each has got what the other requires.  I have come for the purpose of opening up trade with you.  It is true that I myself will take my departure to-morrow, because I am in search of new lands; but some of my people will remain on the spot, and if you bring in a sufficient quantity of furs to make it answer, my men will return to Fort Chipewyan for more goods, and will spend the winter here.  They will build a fort and continue to dwell among you as long as you shall be found to deserve it.\"  At this point the speaker paused, and the dark-skinned audience gave vent to a loud \"Ho!\" which was equivalent to the British \"Hear, hear!\"  \"In regard to my own work,\" continued Mackenzie, \"I intend to search for, and find the great river, which, it is said, flows out of this lake, and follow its current to the sea--or, as you call it, the great salt lake.  Do my brothers know anything about this river?  If so, let them speak.\"  Hereupon an old chief, with hair like small iron wire, and a skin like shoe-leather, got up, and delivered himself as follows--  \"We are glad to hear what our white brother says.  It encourages us to know that you will make a trading fort in our country, for we have need of one.  Hitherto we have had to travel far--very far--with our furs; or if, to save trouble, we intrusted our furs to the Chipewyans, they often pillaged us, or, at most, gave us very little for the fruits of our toil.  For a long time we have been so discouraged that we had no motive to pursue the beaver, except to obtain a sufficiency of food and clothing.  Now if you come to us, we shall be happy--wauch!\"  The last word was equivalent to the expression--\"There, think o' that!\" The old man paused as if to give his audience time for reflection.  \"As to the great river,\" he continued sententiously, \"we know of its existence; but none of our tribe has ever followed its course down to the great salt lake.  We earnestly advise our brother not to go there, for it is a dreadful river.  It is said that there are two impassable falls in its course; and it is so long that old age will come upon you before the time of your return.  You will also encounter monsters of horrid shapes and awful strength on the land and in the water--wauch!\"  The old chief began to glare solemnly at this point, and the whole tribe followed his example.  \"It is said,\" he continued, \"that there are bears which eat the trees as if they were grass; whose cubs, even at their birth, are strong enough to kill the stoutest man.  There are monsters in the river so big that a canoe full of men would be but a mouthful to them.  There are so few animals or fish fit for food, that you will all certainly be starved. And, besides all this, evil spirits dwell there, whose chief delight lies in attacking, killing, roasting, and devouring men--wauch!\"  Here the Indian sat down with the decision of a man who has given unanswerable arguments for the overturning of foolish plans; nevertheless, Mackenzie's plans remained unaltered.  Not so, however, those of a young Indian, who had been engaged to guide the explorers to the other end of the lake, in order to save them from the loss of time which would be occasioned by the necessity of coasting round its numerous bays.  The imagination of this youth--Coppernose, as Lawrence Guff facetiously styled him--was so wrought upon by the dreadful description of the great river, that he manifested a strong desire to draw back; but by the timely addition of a small kettle, an axe, a knife, and a few beads to the gifts already bestowed on him, he was eventually persuaded to venture.  Before departing, poor Coppernose took a ceremonious leave of his family.  He cut off a lock of his hair, and divided it into three parts. One of these he fastened to the top of his wife's head, and blew on it three times with the utmost violence, at the same time uttering certain cabalistic words.  The other two portions he fastened with the same formalities to the heads of his two children.  Even at the last he hesitated, and was finally made to enter the canoe more by force than by persuasion!  A few days later, and our pioneers were fairly embarked on the great river, whose course to the mouth it was their object to explore.  The expedition was now somewhat reduced, owing to Monsieur Le Roux having been left behind.  It consisted of three canoes--the large one with Mackenzie and five men; a small one, with English Chief and his two wives, and Coppernose; and another small one, containing Reuben, his son, Swiftarrow, and Darkeye.  Two of the Canadians were also attended by their wives; so that the party numbered sixteen souls, five of whom were women.  They all kept company as much as possible, but English Chief was frequently left"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21691"],["title","The Pioneers (#5)"],["body","by the large canoe; while Reuben and his friends, being the hunters as we have said, were necessarily absent for considerable periods in search of game.  One evening as they were descending a beautiful sweep of the river under sail in grand style, the English Chief--leaning composedly back in his canoe, while his right hand slightly moved the steering paddle, and his teeth grasped his beloved pipe--said quietly to Coppernose, of course in the Indian tongue--  \"A pretty guide you are, not to know something more about a river so near to your own wigwam.\"  Coppernose, who was a humble-minded man, smiled slightly, and shook his head as he said--  \"All red men are not so adventurous as the English Chief.  I never had occasion to travel in this direction, and do not know the way.\"  \"Boo!\" ejaculated English Chief; meaning, no doubt, fiddlededee!  \"But I know of a river,\" continued Coppernose, \"which falls into this one from the north, and comes from the Horn Mountain that we passed at the end of Great Slave Lake; it is the country of the Beaver Indians. My relations meet me frequently on that river.  There are great plains on both sides of that river, which abound in buffaloes and moose-deer.\"  \"I don't believe it--wauch!\" said English Chief.  As this was a discouraging reception of his remarks, Coppernose relapsed into silence.  Soon afterwards the large canoe was observed to make for a low grassy point; and as it was about the usual camping time, English Chief made for the same place.  The hunters reached it about ten minutes later, and bore into camp two reindeer, four geese, and a swan, besides a large quantity of berries gathered by the fair (or brown) hands of Darkeye.  \"There is plenty of game everywhere,\" said Reuben, in answer to a query from his leader, \"we might have killed much more if we'd had more time-- but enough is as good as a feast, as the sayin' goes in my country.\"  \"In _your_ country?\" said Mackenzie, with a smile.  \"Ay, I claim to be a Scotchman--though I was born and raised in Canada-- my father hailed from the land o' cakes.\"  \"Does Lawrence claim the same nationality on the same ground, Reuben?\"  \"He does not!\" answered Lawrence for himself, while busy cleaning his father's gun.  \"The lad loves the Canadians,\" replied Reuben, with a chuckle; \"besides, he couldn't claim it on the same ground, seein' that I am fully half a Scot, while he is at least three-quarters a Canadian.\"  \"More the better luck for him,\" said one of the Canadians, who had already kindled a fire, before which one of his comrades was busily engaged setting up juicy venison steaks to roast.  \"Oui,\" observed another; \"vraiment, Canada beats Scottish land altogeder.\"  \"Ha!  Faderland ees more best, den all ze vorld,\" said the German, quaffing a can of water with as much zest as if it had been his own native Rhine wine.  \"I warrant me,\" said Mackenzie with a laugh, \"that our trusty guide, Coppernose, would not give the wilderness here for Canada, Scotland, and Faderland put together.  What say you, lad?\"  Coppernose looked gravely at his questioner, but made no reply.  \"Boo!\" said English Chief; regarding his countryman with a look of contempt; \"hims no onerstan' Eengleesh.\"  \"He understands how to eat a rumpsteak of venison, however,\" said Mackenzie, with a laugh, as Coppernose at that moment coolly appropriated a mass of half-roasted meat, and began to devour it. \"You'd better follow his example, lads.\"  The men were not slow to take this advice.  In a short time all were more or less busily engaged with venison steaks, marrow-bones, goose drum-sticks, and fish; and comparative silence prevailed while the cravings of nature were being appeased.  After supper, pipes were lighted, and conversation became animated for some time; but they were all too much fatigued to prolong this period, interesting though it was. One after another they spread their blankets under a convenient bush or tree, and, ere long, the whole party was in the land of Nod.    CHAPTER FIVE.  DESCRIBES A LITERAL WILD-GOOSE CHASE AND OTHER MATTERS.  Time sped on its proverbially rapid wing; the summer advanced, and still Mackenzie and his men continued to descend the mighty river of the far north, encountering dangers and vicissitudes enough undoubtedly, but happily escaping those terrified monsters of the forest and the flood, which had been described by the Copper Indians of Great Slave Lake, and the thought of which caused poor Coppernose himself to grow terrified and desperate by turns.  Fain would that unhappy son of the forest have bid the party farewell, and returned to his own wigwam alone; but this might not be, for his services were of some importance, and the leader of the expedition kept on him constantly an eye, which excelled in intense watchfulness the glare of the fiercest of those creatures which filled his imagination.  He submitted, therefore, with the best grace he could assume; but, what between being watched by Mackenzie, haunted by ghosts, and bullied by English Chief, poor Coppernose had a sad time of it.  He possessed, however, a naturally elastic and jovial spirit, which tended greatly to ameliorate his condition; and as time passed by without any serious mishap, or the appearance of any unusually dreadful creature, he became gradually reconciled to his position.  One day--perhaps we should rather say one night, for it was approaching midnight, although the sun was still above the horizon, owing to the high northern latitude to which they had attained, rendering the whole twenty-four hours round a continuous day--one day (or night) as the canoes were sweeping down a reach of the broad river, they saw a few wreaths of smoke rising above the tree-tops.  The spot was very beautiful, being thickly wooded and backed by high land, on the slopes of which the trees and bushes hung like delicate fringes of green among masses of silvery grey rock.  \"That looks like the smoke of an Indian wigwam, Louis,\" said Mackenzie to his bowman.  \"No, monsieur, it is the wood burning,\" replied Louis, dipping his vermilion-painted paddle with great vigour.  Louis was right, for soon afterwards they turned a point which disclosed to their view a considerable tract of woodland which had been recently destroyed by fire.  Several tracts of this kind had been already passed, some of which had been consumed long before, and forests of young poplars had grown up in their places--a curious circumstance this, which Mackenzie remarks on, namely, \"That wherever land covered with spruce, pine, and white birch had been laid waste with fire, there poplars, and nothing else, were found to grow, even though none of that species of tree had existed there before.\"  Passing this desolated tract they came to a part of the river which was studded with several islands, on one of which reindeer were seen.  \"There's your chance,\" said Mackenzie to his hunters, who happened to range up alongside in their small canoe at that moment.  \"We've seed 'em, monsieur,\" said Reuben, \"but we must have some more ammunition afore startin' after them, for the powder-horns of Lawrence and Swiftarrow are both empty.\"  As soon as the horns were replenished, Reuben and his friends pushed out into the stream and made for the island.  The other canoes continued to advance.  They seldom waited for the hunters, for the latter being comparatively light, could act as a sort of flying artillery, falling behind, turning aside, or pushing ahead, as the case might require, in pursuit of game, and almost always returning to the main body about the camping hour, or soon after it.  On this evening, however, the canoes reached a snug camping-ground before the usual time; they therefore determined to stop there and set the nets, as well as to overhaul the canoes, which stood much in need of repair.  The cold of the ice-laden waters, through which they had recently passed, had cracked the gum off the seams, and collisions with the ice itself had made some ugly slits in the birch-bark of which the canoes were made.  That evening the nets, which were set in four fathoms water, produced an abundant supply of carp, whitefish, and trout.  \"Now, lads,\" said Mackenzie, when the canoe brought ashore the welcome provisions, \"set the women to work to make pemmican, for we must leave a supply concealed here against our return.\"  Louis Blanc superintended the making of this pemmican, which consisted of fish dried in the sun and pounded between two stones.  Pemmican is also made of meat, in which case the pounded meat is put into a bag made of the raw hide of the animal; the bag is then filled with melted fat and the mouth sewed up with raw sinews.  This style of pemmican will keep fresh for years.  \"Where did English Chief go when we landed?\" asked Mackenzie.  \"Don't know, monsieur,\" replied Louis.  \"After game, probably,\" observed the leader, as he sat down on the stump of a fallen tree and began to make notes in his journal.  Some time thereafter, Reuben's canoe returned laden with two deer, besides two swans, a number of ducks and hares, and several brace of ptarmigan, which latter were quite grey at that season, with the exception of one or two pure white feathers in the tail.  They said that wild-fowl were innumerable among the islands; but this, indeed, was obvious to all, for everywhere their plaintive and peculiar cries, and the whirring or flapping of their wings, were heard even when the leafy screen over the encampment hid themselves from view.  Darkeye also contributed her share to the general supplies, in the shape of several large birch-baskets full of gooseberries, cranberries, juniper-berries, rasps, and other wild berries, which, she said, grew luxuriantly in many places.  Meanwhile, the night (as regards _time_) advanced, although the daylight did not disappear, or even much diminish, but English Chief, with Coppernose and his two squaws, did not return, and their prolonged absence became at length a"]]]
