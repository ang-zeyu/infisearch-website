And in very truth, reader, this was the case.  Under the training of a modest, lion-hearted British sailor, the boy was beginning to display, in unusual vigour, those daring, enthusiastic, self-sacrificing qualities which, although mingled with much that is evil, are marked characteristics of our seamen; qualities which have gone far to raise our little island to her present high position of commercial prosperity and political importance, and which, with God's blessing, will continue to carry our flag, our merchandise, and our bibles, to the ends of the earth, and guard our shores, as in days of old, from the foot of every foreign foe.  England can never fully appreciate how much she owes to her seamen.  The thousands of our inland population have a very inadequate conception of the race of heroes by which our coasts are peopled.  Bax is no exaggerated specimen, got up, in these sensation days, for effect.  It is a glorious fact,--proved by the hard and bare statistics furnished annually by the Board of Trade, and from other sources,--that his name is legion, and that the men of whom he is a type swarm all round our coasts, from the old Ultima Thule to the Land's End.  Yes, Tommy was in good training.  He had begun well.  He was evidently a chip of the elder block.  It did not, indeed, occur to his young imagination to suppose that he could ever become anything in the most distant degree resembling his idol Bax.  Neither did he entertain any definite idea as to what his young heart longed after; but he had seen life saved; he had stood on the sea-shore when storms cast shattered wrecks upon the sands, and had witnessed the exploits of boatmen in their brave efforts to save human life; he had known what it was to weep when the rescuer perished with those whom he sought to save, and he had helped to swell with his tiny voice, the bursting cheer of triumph, when men, women, and children were plucked, as if by miracle, from the raging sea!  To take part in those deeds of heroism was the leading desire in the boy's life; and now it seemed as if his career were commencing in earnest, and the day-dreams in which he had so long indulged were at last about to become waking realities.    CHAPTER FOUR.  IN WHICH INTRODUCTIONS STILL GO ON, AND COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE.  Mrs Maria Foster,--the widow of James Foster (formerly captain in the merchant service), the mother of Guy Foster (clerk in the firm of Denham, Crumps, and Company), and the promoter or supporter of every good cause,--was a little woman of five-and-forty or thereabouts, with mild blue eyes, a philanthropic heart, and pale blue ribbons in her cap.  Mrs Foster may be said to have been in easy circumstances.  That is to say, she had sufficient (being a thrifty and economical lady) to \"make the two ends meet,\" even to overlap somewhat, though not,--as a friend of ours once observed,--to tie in a handsome bow, so that she had a little to spare for charitable purposes.  It must not be supposed, however, that the good lady was possessed of a small fortune.  The \"circumstances,\" which were easy to her, would have proved remarkably uneasy to many; but she possessed the rare and tailorly quality of being able and willing to cut her coat according to her cloth.  There was no deeper mystery than that in the \"ease\" with which we have characterised her \"circumstances.\"  The coast of Kent was her locality; the environs of the town of Deal, her neighbourhood; and a small--almost miniature but pretty--cottage, her habitation.  The cottage stood in the middle of a little garden, close to that wide extent of waste land, lying to the north of Deal, which is known by the name of the Sandhills, and on the seaward edge of which formerly stood the pile--and now lie the remains--of Sandown Castle.  Everything in and around the cottage was remarkably neat--including its mistress, who, on the evening of the day in which her son sailed with Bax in the \"Nancy,\" was seated at a little table in her small parlour, summing up an account on a sheet of note-paper,--an operation which appeared to cause her much perplexity, if one might judge from her knitted brows, her deep sighs, and her frequent remarks of \"it won't do,\" and \"what _can_ it be?\"  These observations were apparently addressed to the cat, which sat in front of the fire, watching the tea-kettle and the buttered toast; but although the good lady was addicted to talking to her cat, in a general way, about her love for it and its state of health, we cannot suppose that she really appealed to it on such a grave subject as arithmetical calculation.  If she did she got no answer from the cat--not even a sign of recognition; but she did from a bright-faced, fair-haired girl, of about eighteen, who at that moment entered the room, with a teapot in one hand, and a cream-jug in the other.  \"What is it that puzzles you, mamma?\" said the girl, setting down the pot and jug, and preparing to attend to the duties of the tea-table.  To this Mrs Foster replied, in an absent way, that she didn't know, that it was quite beyond her comprehension, and that she was utterly perplexed; but that she _would_ find it out, if she should sit all night over it.  Whereupon she proceeded to state that \"three and two made five, and seven made--made\"--she wasn't quite sure how much that made, until her companion told her it made twelve; which piece of information she received with an--\"Oh! of course it does.  Dear me, Amy, how silly I am!\"--just as if she had known the fact all her life, and had only forgotten it at that moment, unaccountably, for the first time!  Mrs Foster then went on to add a variety of other figures to this,--with an occasional word of assistance from Amy,--until the whole amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty-three.  \"There,\" said Mrs Foster, with a pleased expression, as she put the figures down, \"now how many twelves are in that--eh? let me see.  Twelve times twelve are a hundred and forty,--no, that's too much; twelve times eleven--how much is twelve times eleven?\"  Mrs Foster did not ask this of Amy; no, she gazed up at the ceiling, where an uncommonly large spider was affixing its web,--with the design, no doubt, of lowering itself down to the tea-table,--and demanded the solution of the problem, apparently, from that creature.  \"I think it is a hundred and thirty-two, mamma,\" said Amy, pouring out the tea.  \"Oh, _of course_, how stupid!\" said Mrs Foster, who was quite struck with the obviousness of the fact--on being told it.  \"There now, that comes to eleven shillings and one penny, which settles the Soup Kitchen. One pound two does the Hospital for the Blind, and there's one pound due to the Sailors' Home.  But still,\" continued Mrs Foster, with a return of the perplexed expression, \"that does not get me out of my difficulty.\"  \"Come to tea, dear,\" said Amy, \"and we will try to clear it up together afterwards.\"  \"Impossible, child.  I could not eat with appetite while this is puzzling my brain.  Let me see; there were fifteen pounds, _apparently_, spent last year, when I put it on paper, and yet here is a sovereign over,\" said Mrs Foster, holding up the coin, and looking at it reproachfully, as if the blame lay with it and not with herself.  \"Well, mamma,\" said Amy, laughing, \"but where is your difficulty?\"  \"Don't you see, child? by rights I ought to give fifteen pounds away; well, my book tells me that fifteen pounds _have_ been given, and yet here is a sovereign left over to give!\"  \"Then don't give it, mamma, just put it back into your purse, and that will make the thing right, won't it?\"  \"No, dear, it won't, because, you see, the money _must_ be right, so the book _must_ be wrong; oh! here it is.  I declare I have forgot to carry _one_.  There, that's right.  Now, dear, we shall have tea.\"  It may be necessary to explain here, that although Amy called Mrs Foster \"mamma,\" she was in fact not related to her at all, being only an adopted daughter.  Poor Amy Russell was a child of the sea.  Two years previous to the time of which we write, she, with her father and mother, had been wrecked on the coast of Kent while returning from a long residence in New Zealand.  Their vessel filled the moment she struck, and the seas buried the hull so completely that passengers and crew were obliged to take to the rigging.  Here they remained all night exposed to the fury of the storm.  Many of the unfortunates, unable to withstand the exposure of that terrible night, fell or were washed out of the rigging and perished.  Among these were Amy's father and mother. Amy herself was taken care of by the captain, with whom she was a great favourite, and, along with those who remained until the morning, was saved by one of the lifeboats stationed on that coast.  They had a narrow escape from drowning even after being taken into the boat, for, just as they were approaching the entrance to the harbour, where crowds of the inhabitants of the town were anxiously watching them, a tremendous sea completely filled the boat, swept away the starboard oars, and carried several of the wrecked passengers overboard, Amy being one of them.  This happened close under the head of the pier. All the passengers were recovered by the lifeboat's crew in a few seconds, with the exception of Amy, who, being exhausted by previous exposure, began to sink at once.  The boatmen, in the turmoil of raging water and howling wind, did not observe this, and a cry of consternation was uttered by the people on the pier, who saw the whole thing clearly"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21744"],["title","The Lifeboat (#6)"],["body"," their elevated position; but the cry was either drowned by the noise of the tempest, or not understood by the boatmen.  At that moment a tall stripling on the pier raced to the edge of it, shot like a rocket head-foremost into the sea, and in a second or two reappeared with the young girl in his arms.  They were both dragged into the lifeboat, amid ringing cheers of delight and admiration.  The stripling who did this brave deed was none other than our friend Guy Foster, who chanced to be lodging with his mother in the neighbouring town at that time.  Guy insisted on having Amy conveyed to his mother's place of abode.  Mrs Foster soon discovered that the poor orphan had neither relations nor friends in England, and having taken a fancy to her, adopted her as a daughter.  Thus did she come to call Mrs Foster \"mamma,\" and to preside at the tea-table in Sandhill Cottage.  But, to return from this digression:--Mrs Foster was congratulating herself on having discovered the error in her accounts, when the door opened and a stout florid woman, of fifty or thereabouts, with a shiny red skin, presented herself and said:  \"Please, ma'am, here's a gentleman as wants to see you, and won't go away, though I told him you was at tea, w'ich is a fact, though it had no impression whatever on him, such is his imprence, goin' for to reflect on my character for truth, as never told a lie since I was a baby in long frocks, so I didn't; but it's always the way with these men that go tax-gatherin', though I don't know that he's that neether, so I don't; what shall I say, ma'am?\"  Mrs Laker, having uttered the foregoing without pause or inflection of voice from beginning to end, came to an abrupt stop.  Whether from want of breath or ideas it is difficult to say; perhaps from both.  \"Show the gentleman in, Laker,\" said Mrs Foster; \"no doubt he has good reason for wishing to see me.\"  Laker vanished.  She was impulsive in her actions as well as in her words.  She was her mistress's factotum--her cook, housemaid, sempstress, and confidential adviser; in addition to which she was somewhat of a bore, being stubborn and opinionated, but a good and faithful servant on the whole.  The individual who was presently introduced was a bustling little old gentleman with a shining bald head and a cheerful countenance.  \"Excuse my rudeness--madam--\" he began, bowing low, as he advanced with a hesitating step--\"this intrusion, really--\"  \"Do not mention it, sir, pray be seated,\" said Mrs Foster; \"you are welcome--surely I have met with you before?\"  She put on a pair of gold spectacles as she said this, and looked earnestly at her visitor, who, having placed his hat on the floor and bowed to Amy, sat down and pulled out a bundle of papers.  \"You have, madam,\" replied the visitor.  \"My name is Summers--David Summers, ma'am, at your service.  I had the pleasure of being introduced to you at a meeting in a town not far distant, where an effort was being made to raise contributions towards the establishment of a lifeboat--\"  \"Oh!  I recollect,\" cried Mrs Foster, whose sympathetic heart at once opened to the man who had made (as she had thought) such an eloquent appeal at the meeting in question; \"I am delighted to see you, Mr Summers.  If I mistake not, I invited you to come and see me when you should visit this part of the coast.\"  \"You were kind enough to do so, madam, hence my venturing to call at this hour.  I quit Deal to-morrow, early, and I am anxious to re-plead my old cause with you; but indeed I know this to be unnecessary, your own sympathies being already enlisted in my favour.\"  Mrs Foster assured Mr Summers that he was right, but begged of him, notwithstanding, to plead with her as if she were an enemy, in order that she might hear all he had to say on the subject, adding, that she hoped he would stay and have a cup of tea.  Hereupon Mr Summers bowed, drew in his chair, remarked to Amy that the lifeboat service was one of the most interesting and important topics of the day, and the National Lifeboat Institution one of the most valuable institutions in the kingdom, and at once launched into his favourite theme with all the gusto of an enthusiast who has gained the ear of a sympathetic audience.  We will, however, spare the reader the details and statistics which afforded so much pleasure to Mrs Foster and her adopted daughter, knowing full well that there is an immense difference between these when set down in hard type, and when poured forth in rich energetic tones, backed by twinkling eyes and a beaming countenance.  \"Do you really mean to tell me, Mr Summers,\" said Mrs Foster--when the old gentleman came to the end of a long statement, \"that about a thousand ships are wrecked, and nearly a thousand lives lost, besides more than a million pounds worth of property, on the shores of this country _every year_?\"  \"It is a sad but incontrovertible fact,\" replied Mr Summers.  \"Official lists are drawn up annually by the Board of Trade, which give the number and positions of wrecks--cold dry lists they are too.  Matter-of-fact columns and figures, without a touch of softness about them.  They are not meant to appeal to the feelings; they are a mere record of facts. So many vessels went ashore in such and such a gale--they were sunk, dismasted, dashed to pieces.  So many persons were saved, so many drowned,--that is all.  Ah! who can picture to himself the awful realities that are condensed in those brief accounts?  \"When a magnificent steamer, after a fine voyage from the antipodes, comes within hail of port, is caught in a fearful hurricane, cast ashore and dashed to pieces, leaving hundreds of passengers, men, women, and children, to perish in the dark night, grasping the very rocks of their native land, the event is too awful to escape notice.  So numerous are the crushed and broken hearts in the land, that their cry awakens public attention, and the newspapers teem for a time with graphic details of the wreck; details which, graphic though they be, fall inconceivably short of the dread reality; but no notice is taken, except in the way of brief record, of the dozens of small coasting vessels that shared the fate of that steamer in the same terrific gale.  No one reads the fate of yonder little schooner, one mast of which is seen just peeping out of the sea under that frowning cliff, and yet there is a terrible tale connected with it.  Who shall tell or conceive of the agonies endured, before the morning light came, by the skipper and his crew of four men and a boy, as their little ship was lifted and flung upon the rocks by each succeeding wave?  And who can conceive their feelings when the longed for light _did_ come at last, and daring fishermen on the shore sought to render aid in vain, for their boats were overturned and cast back upon the beach, and themselves barely escaped with their lives, and so the perishing men stood in helpless misery and gazed landward in despair until a mighty wave carried away the mast to which they clung, and, with a last wild shriek they sank in sight of friends and home, because _there was no lifeboat there_.\"  \"Can this be true?\" said Mrs Foster, in a tone of deep sympathy.  \"True!\" echoed Mr Summers, \"would God that it were not.  I have mentioned but one case, yet it is a fact that for _every_ gale that blows _dozens_ of wrecks take place on our coasts, each with its more or less tragic history.  You remember the last gale?  It is not three weeks since it blew.  No fewer than one hundred and ninety-five wrecks took place on the shores of the United Kingdom on that night and the following day, and six hundred and eighty-four lives were lost, many of which would undoubtedly have been saved had there been a sufficient number of lifeboats stationed along our shores; for you must bear in remembrance, that although hundreds of lives are annually saved by ordinary shore boats, and by ships' boats, hundreds also are saved by lifeboats in circumstances in which ordinary boats would be utterly useless.  \"Here is a newspaper paragraph,\" continued the old gentleman, unfolding a paper and preparing to read, \"which shows the brief way in which the public prints at times notice events of the most stirring and heroic nature:--`On the morning of the 3rd December last, after a stormy and rainy night, the wind shifted to the North West and blew a hurricane. Many vessels got on shore near Holyhead, from various causes.  The lifeboat of the National Lifeboat Institution was launched and proceeded to their assistance.  She got ahead of one, a schooner, and anchored, but the intense violence of the wind blew her to leeward, anchor and all, and she was unable to communicate, and had great difficulty in returning ashore.  She again put off to the schooner _Elizabeth_ of Whitehaven, which had a signal of distress flying, having parted one chain, and brought her crew of four men on shore.  The hurricane continued unabated well into the night.  The weather having moderated, the lifeboat was despatched at 2 a.m., and brought on shore twenty-three men from the _Confiance_ of Liverpool; then again put off and brought ashore nineteen men from the barque _Elizabeth Morrow_ of Glasgow; next proceeded to the schooner _L'Esperance_ of Nantes, and saved two men, making altogether a total of forty-eight lives saved by the lifeboat in this hurricane only.'  \"Dear madam,\" observed Mr Summers, looking at Mrs Foster over his spectacles, \"surely it is unnecessary for me to point out that this brief narrative does not give us the most distant conception of the terrors, the endurance, the heroism, incident to that night!  Permit me to read you another paragraph.  It is given more in detail and does better justice to the scene.\"  The old gentleman selected another paper, opened it, and read as follows:--  \"`The sum of 9 pounds has recently been given by the National Lifeboat Institution to a boat's crew, in appreciation of their gallant conduct in "]]]
