He is pressed for money, and wishes to dispose of them. He offered them to me at twenty-two hundred dollars, half cash. I offered him a thousand dollars cash for two of them, but he wishes to sell the whole together. I think it will be an excellent speculation, for the laying out of Central Park is carrying up the price of lots in the neighborhood rapidly.\"  \"Why didn't you buy them, then?\"  \"Because I didn't want to buy anything that I couldn't pay for at once. I've got a wife and three children to look out for, and so I can save money but slowly. If I only had myself to take care of, I wouldn't hesitate.\"  \"Can't we club together, and buy it?\" suggested Dick, eagerly.  \"That is just what I was going to propose. I think the owner will take two thousand dollars down for the lots. That will be a thousand dollars apiece. I've got that money, and so have you. What do you think of it?\"  \"Tip-top,\" said Dick, enthusiastically. \"It's just what I'd like to do.\"  \"Of course it wouldn't bring us in anything, but would, instead, be an expense for the present, as we should have to pay taxes on it. On the other hand, you could invest the money in bank-stock, so as to receive seventy or eighty dollars annually at interest. You must decide which investment you prefer. The land we may have to keep on hand four or five years, paying taxes yearly.\"  \"But the price'll go up.\"  \"There is no doubt of that. The city is extending northwards rapidly. I shouldn't be surprised if the lots would bring a thousand dollars apiece in less than five years. This would be equal to a very handsome interest.\"  \"I'm in for buying 'em,\" said Dick. \"So, if you'll see the owner, I'll have the money all ready whenever you want it.\"  \"Very well, but perhaps you would like to see them first. We'll manage to get off an hour earlier than usual this afternoon, and go up and take a look at them.\"  \"It seems to me Mr. Murdock and that boy are pretty thick together,\" said the book-keeper, glancing through the glass partition. He could see that they were conversing earnestly, but of course couldn't hear a word that was said. \"What he or Mr. Rockwell can see in the young rascal passes my comprehension.\"  He called sharply to Dick, and ordered him to go to the post-office for letters.  \"All right,\" said Dick.  \"And mind you don't loiter by the way,\" said the book-keeper, sharply. \"You were gone long enough at the bank this morning. Did you come right back?\"  \"No,\" said Dick.  \"Why didn't you?\"  \"There was somewhere else I wanted to go.\"  \"On your own business, or Mr. Rockwell's?\"  \"On my own business.\"  \"So I thought. I shall report you to Mr. Rockwell,\" said Gilbert, triumphantly.  \"I wouldn't, if I were you,\" said Dick, coolly.  \"And why not, you young rascal?\"  \"Because he knows it already.\"  \"Knows it already,\" repeated the book-keeper, discomfited. \"Well, I hope he gave you a good scolding.\"  \"I am sorry to disappoint you,\" said Dick; \"but he knows it, because he gave me leave to go.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" said Gilbert, mortified to find that Dick was in the right after all.  \"Then perhaps you'd better ask Mr. Rockwell.\"  \"I will,\" said Gilbert, who really had no intention of doing so. \"You must have had some very urgent private business,\" he added, with a sneer.  \"You're right, there,\" said Dick.  \"Playing marbles with some of your ragamuffin friends, I suppose.\"  \"Playin' marbles is a very refined and intellectual amusement,\" said Dick; \"but I don't play marbles in business hours.\"  \"Where did you go?\" said the book-keeper, impatiently. \"I don't want any of your impertinence.\"  \"I went to the savings bank,\" said Dick.  \"I suppose you have a very large account there,\" sneered Gilbert.  \"Yes,\" said Dick, quietly; \"pretty large.\"  \"It's to be hoped you won't withdraw your patronage, or the bank might fail.\"  \"Then I won't,\" said Dick. \"Shall I go to the post-office now?\"  \"Yes, and be quick about it.\"  The book-keeper had some curiosity as to the amount of Dick's account at the savings bank, but there was no good chance for him to inquire, and he accordingly returned to his writing, more prejudiced against Dick than ever.  On the whole, I have some doubts whether Dick's manner was quite as respectful as it ought to have been to one who was older and higher in office than himself. I should not recommend my young readers to imitate him in this respect. But it is my business to describe Dick just as he was, and I have already said that he was not a model boy. Still in most respects he tried to do what was right, and it must be admitted that the book-keeper's treatment of him was not likely to inspire much attachment or respect. Dick had no difficulty in perceiving the dislike entertained by Gilbert for him, and he was beginning to cherish a similar feeling towards the book-keeper. He determined, however, to give him no cause of complaint, so far as he was entitled to command his services; but it must be confessed he found much more satisfaction in obeying Mr. Rockwell and Mr. Murdock.     CHAPTER VIII.  NEW PLANS.   At the close of the afternoon, as had been proposed, Mr. Murdock, accompanied by Dick, rode up as far as Forty-Fifth Street, to look at the lots which he had suggested buying. They were located in a very eligible situation, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Some of my young readers may not be aware that the dimensions of a city lot are twenty-five feet front by one hundred feet in depth. The four lots together made a plot of one hundred feet by one hundred, or a little less than quarter of an acre. In the country the whole would scarcely have been considered sufficient for a house with a good yard in front; but if people choose to live in the city they must make up their minds to be crowded.  \"It looks small,--don't it?\" said Dick. \"I shouldn't think there was four lots there.\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. Murdock, \"they are of the regular size. Some lots are only twenty feet wide. These are twenty-five. They don't look so large before they are built on.\"  \"Well,\" said Dick, \"I'm in for buying them.\"  \"I think it will be a good investment for both of us,\" said Mr. Murdock.  \"The money shall be ready whenever you want it,\" said Dick.  \"Very well. I will see the owner to-morrow, or rather this evening, as it is best to be prompt, lest we might lose so favorable a bargain. I will make the best terms I can with him, and let you know the result to-morrow.\"  \"All right!\" said Dick. \"Good-night, Mr. Murdock.\"  \"Good-night. By-the-by, why won't you come round and take supper with us? My wife and children will be glad to make your acquaintance.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"I will come some other evening with pleasure; but if I stay away without saying anything about it, Fosdick won't know what's become of me.\"  Dick got back to Bleecker Street a little late for dinner. When he entered the dining-room, the remainder of the boarders were seated at the table.  \"Come, Mr. Hunter, you must render an account of yourself,\" said Miss Peyton, playfully. \"Why are you late this evening?\"  \"Suppose I don't tell,\" said Dick.  \"Then you must pay a fine,--mustn't he, Mrs. Browning?\"  \"That depends upon who is to benefit by the fines,\" said the landlady. \"If they are to be paid to me, I shall be decidedly in favor of it. That reminds me that you were late to breakfast this morning, Miss Peyton.\"  \"Oh, ladies mustn't be expected to pay fines,\" said Miss Peyton, shaking her ringlets. \"They never have any money, you know.\"  \"Then I think we must let Mr. Hunter off,\" said Mrs. Browning.  \"If he will tell us what has detained him. You must excuse my curiosity, Mr. Hunter, but ladies, you know, are privileged to be curious.\"  \"I don't mind telling,\" said Dick, helping himself to a piece of toast. \"I'm talking of buying some lots up-town, and went up with a friend to look at them.\"  Fosdick looked at Dick, inquiringly, not knowing if he were in earnest or not.  \"Indeed!\" said Mr. Clifton. \"May I inquire where the lots are situated?\"  \"I'll tell you if I buy them,\" said Dick; \"but I don't want to run the risk of losing them.\"  \"You needn't be afraid of my cutting you out,\" said Clifton. \"I paid my washerwoman this morning, and haven't got but a dollar and a half over. I suppose that won't buy the property.\"  \"I wish it would,\" said Dick. \"In that case I'd buy half a dozen lots.\"  \"I suppose, from your investing in lots, Mr. Hunter, that you are thinking of getting married, and living in a house of your own,\" said Miss Peyton, simpering.  \"No,\" said Dick, \"I shan't get married for a year. Nobody ought to be married before they're seventeen.\"  \"That's just my age,\" said Miss Peyton.  Mr. Clifton afterwards informed Dick that Miss Peyton was twenty-five, but did not mention how he had ascertained. He likewise added that when he first came to the boarding-house, she had tried her fascinations upon him.  \"She'd have married me in a minute,\" he said complacently; \"but I'm too old a bird to be caught that way. When you see Mrs. Clifton, gentlemen, you'll see style and beauty, and--_money_\" he added, after a moment's reflection.  Mr. Clifton had a tolerably good opinion of himself, as may be inferred from this remark. In fact, he valued himself rather more highly than the ladies appeared to do; but such cases are not remarkable.  \"Mrs. Clifton will be a lucky woman,\" said Dick, with a sober face.  \"You're very kind to say so,\" said Mr. Clifton, modestly. \"I believe I'm tolerably good-looking, and nobody'll deny that I've got style. But money,--that's my weak point. You couldn't lend me five dollars, could you, till next week?\"  \"I'm "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21638"],["title","Tarrano the Conqueror (#0)"],["body","THE CONQUEROR                              BY RAY CUMMINGS     COPYRIGHT, 1930, BY A.

FOREWORD   _In \"Tarrano the Conqueror\" is presented a tale of the year 2430 A.D.--a time somewhat farther beyond our present-day era than we are beyond Columbus' discovery of America. My desire has been to create for you the impression that you have suddenly been plunged forward into that time--to give you the feeling Columbus might have had could he have read a novel of our present-day life.  To this end I have conceived myself a writer of that future time, addressing his contemporary public. You are to imagine yourself reading a present day translation of my original text--a translation so free that a thousand little colloquialisms will have crept into it that could not possibly have their counterparts in the year 2430.  Apart from the text, you will occasionally find brief explanatory footnotes. Conceive them as having been put there by the translator.  If you find parts of this tale unusual or bizarre, please remember that we are living now in a comparatively ignorant day. The tale is not intended to be fantastic or full of new and strange ideas. I have used nothing but those developments of our present-day civilization to which we are all looking forward as logical probabilities--woven them into a picture of what life in America very probably will be five hundred years from now. To that extent, the tale itself is intended to be only a love story of adventure and romance--written, not for you, but for that future audience._  RAY CUMMINGS.     CONTENTS          I.

Battle     TARRANO THE CONQUEROR     CHAPTER I  _The New Murders_   I was standing fairly close to the President of the Anglo-Saxon Republic when the first of the new murders was committed. The President fell almost at my feet. I was quite certain then that the Venus man at my elbow was the murderer. I don't know why, call it intuition if you will. The Venus man did not make a move; he merely stood beside me in the press of the throng, seemingly as absorbed as all of us in what the President was saying.  It was late afternoon. The sun was setting behind the cliffs across the river. There were perhaps a hundred and fifty thousand people within sight of the President, listening raptly to his words. It was at Park Sixty, and I was standing on the Tenth Level.[1] The crowd packed all twelve of the levels; the park was black with people. The President stood on a balcony of the park tower. He was no more than a few hundred feet above me, well within direct earshot. Around him on all sides were the electric megaphones which carried his voice to all parts of the audience. Behind me, a thousand feet overhead, the main aerials were scattering it throughout the city, I suppose five million people were listening to the voice of the President at that moment. He had just said that we must remain friendly with Venus; that in our enlightened age controversies were inevitable, but that they should be settled with sober thought--around the council table. This talk of war was ridiculous. He was denouncing the public news-broadcasters; moulders of public opinion, who every day--every hour--must offer a new sensation to their millions of subscribers.  [Footnote 1: New York City, about where Yonkers now stands.]  He had reached this point when without warning his body pitched forward. The balcony rail caught it; and it hung there inert. The slanting rays of the sun fell full upon the ruffled white shirt; white, but turning pink, then red, with the crimson stain welling out from beneath.  For an instant the crowd was stunned into silence. Then a murmur arose, and swelled into shouts of horror. A surge of people swept me forward. I could not see clearly what was happening on the balcony. The form of the murdered President was hanging there against the rail; a score of government officials were rushing toward it; but the body, toppling over the low support, came hurtling downward into the crowd, quite near me; but I could not reach it--the throng was too dense.  The shouts everywhere were deafening. I was shoved along the Tenth Level by the press of people coming up the stairway. Shouts, excited questions; the wail of children almost trampled under foot; the screams of women. And over it all, the electrically magnified voice of the traffic director-general in the peak of the main tower roaring his orders to the crowd.  It was a panic until the traffic-directors descended upon us. We were pushed up on the moving sidewalks. North or south, whichever direction came handiest, we were herded upon the sidewalks and whirled away. With a hundred other spectators near me I was shoved to a sidewalk moving south along the Tenth Level. It was going some four miles an hour. But they would not let me stay there. From behind, the crowd was shoving; and from one parallel strip of moving pavement to the other I was pushed along--until at last I reached the seats of the forty mile an hour inside section.  The scene at Park Sixty was far out of direct sight and hearing. The park there had already been cleared of spectators, I knew; and they were doubtless bearing the President's body away.  \"Murdered!\" said a man beside me. \"Murdered! Look there!\"  We were across the river, into Manhattan. The Tenth Level here runs about four hundred feet above the ground-street of the city. The man beside me was pointing to a steel tower we were passing. It was several hundreds yards away; on its side abreast of us was a forty-foot square news-mirror, brightly illumined. On all the stairways and balconies here a local crowd had gathered, watching the mirror. It was reporting the present scene at Park Sixty. As we sped past the tower I could see in the silver surface of the mirror the image of the now empty park from which we had been so summarily ejected. They were carrying off the President's body; a little group of officials bearing it away; red, broken, gruesome, with the dying rays of the sun still upon it. Carrying it slowly along to where an aero-car was waiting on the side landing stage.  We were past the mirror in a moment.  \"Murdered,\" the man next to me repeated. \"The President murdered.\"  He seemed stunned, as indeed everyone was. Then he eyed me--my cap, which had on it the insignia of my calling.  \"You are one of them,\" he said bitterly. \"The last word he said--the lurid news-gatherers.\"  But I shook my head. \"We are necessary. It was unfortunate that he should have said that.\"  I had no opportunity to talk further. The man moved away toward the foot of a landing stage near us. A south-bound flyer had overtaken us and was landing. I boarded it also, and ten minutes later was in my office in South-Manhattan.  I was at this time employed by one of the most enterprising news-organizations in Greater New York. There was pandemonium in there that evening. My supper came up in the pneumatic tube from the public cookery nearby, but I had hardly time to taste it.  This, the evening of May 12, 2430, was for me--and for all the Earth--the most stirring evening of history. Events of inter-planetary importance tumbled over each other as they came to us through the air from the Official Information Stations. And we--myself and a thousand like me in our office--retold them for our twenty million subscribers throughout the Anglo-Saxon Nation.  The President of the Anglo-Saxon Republic was murdered at 5:10. It was the first of the new murders. I say new murders, for not in two hundred years had the life of so high an official been wilfully taken. But it was only the first. At 6:15 word came from Tokyohama,[2] that the ruler of Allied Mongolia was dead--murdered under similar circumstances. And ten minutes later from Mombozo, Africa, the blacks reported their leader killed while asleep in his official residence.  [Footnote 2: Tokyo-Yokohama, Japan.]  The Earth momentarily was without leadership!  I was struggling to get accounts of these successive disasters out over our audiophones. Above my desk, in a duplicating mirror from Headquarters, I could see that at the palace of Mombozo a throng of terrified blacks were gathered. It was night there--a blurred scene of flashing lights and frightened, milling people.  Greys--next to me--had a mirror tuned to Tokyohama. The sun there was shining upon almost a similar scene of panic. Black and yellow men--on opposite sides of the Earth. And between them our white races in turmoil. Outside my own window I could hear the shouts of the crowd that jammed the Twentieth Level.  Greys leaned toward me. \"Seven o'clock, Jac. You've got the arrival of the Venus "]]]
