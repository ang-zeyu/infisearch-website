Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________  Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northen Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\", \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences with the H.B.C.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade, the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the life-boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet, ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.  He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year, all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.  He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".  For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.  Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched, because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each series.  One of these series is \"On the Coast\", which includes \"Saved by the Lifeboat\".

BALLANTYNE.    LETTER ONE.  \"A LIFE ON THE OCEAN WAVE.\"  South Africa.  Dear Periwinkle,--Since that memorable, not to say miserable, day, when you and I parted at Saint Katherine's Docks, [see note 1], with the rain streaming from our respective noses--rendering tears superfluous, if not impossible--and the noise of preparation for departure damaging the fervour of our \"farewell\"--since that day, I have ploughed with my \"adventurous keel\" upwards of six thousand miles of the \"main,\" and now write to you from the wild Karroo of Southern Africa.  The Karroo is not an animal.  It is a spot--at present a lovely spot.  I am surrounded by--by nature and all her southern abundance.  Mimosa trees, prickly pears, and aloes remind me that I am not in England. Ostriches, stalking on the plains, tell that I am in Africa.  It is not much above thirty years since the last lion was shot in this region, [see note 2], and the kloofs, or gorges, of the blue mountains that bound the horizon are, at the present hour, full of \"Cape-tigers,\" wild deer of different sorts, baboons, monkeys, and--but hold!  I must not forestall.  Let me begin at the beginning.  The adventurous keel above referred to was not, as you know, my own private property.  I shared it with some two hundred or so of human beings, and a large assortment of the lower animals.  Its name was the \"Windsor Castle\"--one of a magnificent line of ocean steamers belonging to an enterprising British firm.  There is something appallingly disagreeable in leave-taking.  I do not refer now to the sentiment, but to the manner of it.  Neither do I hint, my dear fellow, at _your_ manner of leave-taking.  Your abrupt \"Well, old boy, _bon voyage_, good-bye, bless you,\" followed by your prompt retirement from the scene, was perfect in its way, and left nothing to be desired; but leave-takings in general--how different!  Have you never stood on a railway platform to watch the starting of an express?  Of course you have, and you have seen the moist faces of those two young sisters, who had come to \"see off\" that dear old aunt, who had been more than a mother to them since that day, long ago, when they were left orphans, and who was leaving them for a few months, for the first time for many years; and you have observed how, after kissing and weeping on her for the fiftieth time, they were forcibly separated by the exasperated guard; and the old lady was firmly, yet gently thrust into her carriage, and the door savagely locked with one hand, while the silver whistle was viciously clapt to the lips with the other, and the last \"goo-ood--bye--d-arling!\" was drowned by a shriek, and puff and clank, as the train rolled off.  You've seen it all, have you not, over and over again, in every degree and modification?  No doubt you have, and as it is with parting humanity at railway stations, so is it at steamboat wharves.  There are differences, however.  After you had left, I stood and sympathised with those around me, and observed that there is usually more emotion on a wharf than on a platform--naturally enough, as, in the case of long sea voyages, partings, it may be presumed, are for longer periods, and dangers are supposed to be greater and more numerous than in land journeys,--though this is open to question.  The waiting process, too, is prolonged.  Even after the warning bell had sent non-voyagers ashore, they had to stand for a considerable time in the rain while we cast off our moorings or went through some of those incomprehensible processes by which a leviathan steamer is moved out of dock.  After having made a first false move, which separated us about three yards from the wharf--inducing the wearied friends on shore to brighten up and smile, and kiss hands, and wave kerchiefs, with that energy of decision which usually marks a really final farewell--our steamer remained in that position for full half an hour, during which period we gazed from the bulwarks, and our friends gazed from under their dripping umbrellas across the now impassable gulf in mute resignation.  At that moment a great blessing befell us.  A boy let his cap drop from the wharf into the water!  It was an insignificant matter in itself, but it acted like the little safety-valve which prevents the bursting of a high-pressure engine.  Voyagers and friends no longer looked at each other like melancholy imbeciles.  A gleam of intense interest suffused every visage, intelligence sparkled in every eye, as we turned and concentrated our attention on that cap!  The unexpressed blessing of the whole company, ashore and afloat, descended on the uncovered head of that boy, who, all unconscious of the great end he was fulfilling, made frantic and futile efforts with a long piece of stick to recover his lost property.  But we did at last get under weigh, and then there were some touches of real pathos.  I felt no disposition to note the humorous elements around when I saw that overgrown lad of apparently eighteen summers, press to the side and wave his thin hands in adieu to an elderly lady on shore, while tears that he could not, and evidently did not care to restrain, ran down his hollow cheeks.  He had no friend on board, and was being sent to the Cape for the benefit of his health.  So, too, was another young man--somewhere between twenty and thirty years--whose high colour, brilliant eye, and feeble step told their own tale.  But this man was not friendless.  His young wife was there, and supported him with tender solicitude towards a seat.  These two were in the after-cabin.  Among the steerage passengers the fell disease was represented in the person of a little boy.  \"Too late\" was written on the countenances of at least two of these,--the married man and the little boy.  As to the healthy passengers, what shall I say of them?  Need I tell you that every species of humanity was represented?  There were tall men, and short men, as well as men broad and narrow,-- mentally, not less than physically.  There were ladies pretty, and ladies plain, as well as grave and gay.  Fat and funny ones we had, also lean ones and sad.  The wise and foolish virgins were represented.  So too were smokers and drinkers; and not a few earnest, loving, and lovable, men and women.  A tendency had been gaining on me of late to believe that, after passing middle-life, a man cannot make new and enthusiastic friendships.  Never was I more mistaken.  It is now my firm conviction that men may and do make friendships of the closest kind up to the end of their career.  Of course the new friends do not, and cannot, take the place of the old. It seems to me that they serve a higher purpose, and, by enabling one to realise the difference between the old and the new, draw the cords of ancient friendship"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21704"],["title","Six Months at the Cape (#1)"],["body","ter.  At all events, you may depend upon it, my dear Periwinkle, that no new friend shall ever tumble _you_ out of the niche which you occupy in my bosom!  But be this as it may, it is a fact that in my berth--which held four, and was full all the voyage--there was a tall, dark, powerful, middle-aged man, an Englishman born in Cape Colony, [see note 3], who had been \"home\" for a trip, and was on his way out again to his African home on the great Karroo.  This man raised within me feelings of disgust when I first saw him in the dim light of our berth, because he was big, and I knew that a big man requires more air to fill his lungs than a little one, and there was no superabundant air in our berth--quite the reverse.  This man occupied the top berth opposite to mine.  Each morning as I awoke my eyes fell on his beard of iron-grey, and I gazed at his placid countenance till he awoke--or I found his placid countenance gazing at me when _I_ awoke.  From gazing to nodding in recognition is an easy step in ordinary circumstances, but not when one's head is on one's pillow.  We therefore passed at once, without the ceremony of nodding, into a quiet \"good morning.\"  Although reticent, he gradually added a smile to the \"good morning,\" and I noticed that his smile was a peculiarly pleasant one.  Steps that succeed the \"first\" are generally easy.  From disliking this man--not on personal, but purely selfish grounds--I came to like him; then to love him.  I have reason to believe that the attachment was mutual.  His name--why should I not state it?  I don't think he would object--is Hobson.  In the bunk below Hobson lay a young Wesleyan minister.  He was a slender young fellow,--modest and thoughtful.  If Hobson's bunk had given way, I fear that his modesty and thoughtfulness might have been put to a severe test.  I looked down upon this young Wesleyan from my materially exalted position, but before the voyage was over I learned to look up to him from a spiritually low position.  My impression is that he was a \"meek\" man.  I may be mistaken, but of this am I certain, that he was one of the gentlest, and at the same time one of the most able men in the ship.  But, to return to my berth--which, by the way, I was often loth to do, owing to the confined air below, and the fresh glorious breezes on deck--the man who slept under me was a young banker, a clerk, going out to the Cape to make his fortune, and a fine capable-looking fellow he was, inclined rather to be receptive than communicative.  He frequently bumped me with his head in getting up; I, not unfrequently, put a foot upon his nose, or toes, in getting down.  What can I say about the sea that has not been said over and over again in days of old?  This, however, is worthy of record, that we passed the famous Bay of Biscay in a dead-calm.  We did not \"lay\" one single \"day\" on that \"Bay of Biscay, O!\"  The \"O!\" seems rather awkwardly to imply that I am not stating the exact truth, but I assure you that it is a fact.  More than this, we had not a storm all the way to the Cape.  It was a pure pleasure excursion--a sort of yacht voyage--from beginning to end; very pleasant at the time, and delightful now to dwell upon; for, besides the satisfaction of making a new friend like Hobson, there were others to whom I was powerfully drawn, both by natural sympathy and intellectual bias.  There was a Wesleyan minister, also an Englishman, born in South Africa, and of the race of Anak, with whom, and his amiable wife, and pretty children, I fraternised ardently.  My soul was also gladdened by intercourse with a clergyman of the Dutch-Reformed Church, well-known in the Cape, and especially in the Transvaal--who, with his pleasant wife and daughter, was on his way back to South Africa after a brief trip to Europe.  He was argumentative; so, you know, am I.  He was also good-tempered, therefore we got on well.  It would be an endless business to name and describe all the passengers who were personally attractive, and who were more or less worthy of description.  There were, among others, a genial and enthusiastic Dutch-African legislator of the Cape; a broad-shouldered but retiring astronomer; also a kindly Cape merchant; and a genial English banker, with their respective wives and families.  I had the good fortune to sit in the midst of these at meals, close to Captain Hewat, who is unquestionably, what many of us styled him, a \"trump.\"  He is also a Scotchman.  There was likewise a diamond-digger, and another man who seemed to hate everybody except himself.  There were also several sportsmen; one of whom, a gallant son of Mars, and an author, had traversed the \"Great Lone Land\" of British America, and had generally, it seemed to me, \"done\" the world, with the exception of Central Africa, which he was at last going to add to his list.  There were also troops of children, who behaved remarkably well considering the trials they had to undergo; and numerous nurses, some of whom required more attention than all the ladies put together.  You will now, no doubt, expect an account of romantic adventures on the deep, and narrow escapes, and alarms of fire, and men overboard, and thrilling narratives.  If so, your expectations are doomed to disappointment.  We fished for no sharks, we chased no whales, we fell in with no slavers or pirates.  Nevertheless we saw flying fish, and we had concerts and lectures; and such delightful perambulations of the decks, and such charming impromptu duets and glees and solos on retired parts of the deck in moonlight nights, and such earnest discussions, and such genial companionship!  Truly that voyage was one of those brilliant episodes which occur only once in a lifetime, and cannot be repeated; one of those green spots in memory, which, methinks, will survive when all other earthly things have passed away.  I will write no more about it, however, at present.  Neither will I proceed in what is usually considered the natural manner with my epistles--namely, step by step.  Arrivals, cities, travelling, roads, inns, and all such, I will skip, and proceed at one bound to that which at the present moment is to me most interesting, merely remarking that we reached Capetown, (of which more hereafter), in November,--the South African summer--after a voyage of twenty-five days.  I am now sojourning at Ebenezer-Hobson's residence on the Karroo.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Note 1.  Near the Tower of London.

To start for the hunting-field at seven in the morning in a carriage and six, smacks of royalty and sounds luxurious, but in South Africa there are drawbacks connected therewith.  Hobson's farm is, as I have said, on the Karroo--those vast plains which at some seasons resemble a sandy desert, and at others are covered with rich verdure and gorgeous flowers.  They are named after the small, succulent, Karroo-bush, which represents the grass of other plains, and is excellent food for cattle, sheep, and ostriches.  These plains embrace a considerable portion of the territory of the Cape.  The Karroo is pre-eminently lumpy.  Its roads in most places are merely the result of traffic.  They, also, are lumpy.  Our carriage was a native \"cart,\" by which is meant a plain and powerful machine with springs that are too strong readily to yield.  Five of our team were mules, the sixth was a pony.  Our party at starting numbered five, but grew as we progressed.  We took with us provisions and fodder for two days.  The driving was undertaken by Hobson's nephew, assisted by his eldest son--\"Six-foot Johnny.\" There was a double necessity for two drivers.  To hold the reins of five kicking mules and a prancing pony required both hands as well as all the strength of the cousin, though he was a powerful fellow, and the management of the whip claimed both arms, and all the strength, as well as the undivided attention of his assistant.  The whip was a salmon-rod in appearance, without exaggeration.  It had a bamboo handle somewhere between twelve and fourteen feet long, with a proportionate lash.  The operator sometimes found it convenient to stand when he made a cast with his fishing-rod weapon.  He was an adept with it; capable, it seemed to me, of picking a fly off one of the leader's ears.  There was some trouble in keeping our team quiet while rifles, ammunition, provisions, etcetera, were being stowed in the cart.  At last the cousin gave the word.  Six-foot Johnny made a cast.  The lash grazed the leader's flank with a crack that might have shamed a small revolver.  The mules presented first their noses, then their heels to the sky; the cart leaped from the ground, and we were off--bumping, rattling, crashing, swinging, over the wild Karroo, followed by some half-dozen horses led by two mounted Hottentot attendants.  My friend Hobson, greatly to our grief, did not accompany us, owing to inflamed eyes, but I shared the back seat of the cart with his brother Jonathan, a tall strapping man of middle age and modest mien, who seemed to me the perfect type of a colonial hero.  In an hour or so we came to the solitary farm of a Mr Green, who regaled us with a sumptuous breakfast, and lent me a spur.  I had the liberal offer of two spurs, but as, in hunting with the rifle, it is sometimes advisable to sit on one's right heel, and memory during the excitement of the"]]]
