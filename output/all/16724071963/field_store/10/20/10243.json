The sun became at last warm enough to melt ice and snow visibly.  We no longer listened with interest to the sounds of dropping water from eaves and trees, for these had become once more familiar, and soon our ears were greeted with the gurgling of rills away in mysterious depths beneath the snow.  The gurgling ere long gave place to gushing, and it seemed as if all nature were dissolving into liquid.  While this pleasant change was going on we awoke with song and laugh and story the echoes of Bachelors' Hall--at no time very restful echoes, save perhaps in the dead hours of early morning; and even then they were more or less disturbed by snoring.  For our sociable Highlander, besides having roused our spirits by his mere presence to the effervescing point, was himself much elated by the mighty change from prolonged solitude to joyous companionship.  \"My spirit feels inclined,\" he remarked one day, \"to jump clean out of my body.\"  \"You'd better not let it then,\" said Lumley, \"for you know it might catch cold or freeze.\"  \"Not in this weather, surely,\" retorted Macnab, \"and if I did feel coldish in the circumstances, couldn't I borrow Spooner's blanket-capote? it might fit me then, for I'd probably be a few sizes smaller.\"  \"Come, Mac,\" said I, \"give us a song.  You know I'm wildly fond of music; and, most unfortunately, not one of us three can sing a note.\"  Our visitor was quite willing, and began at once to sing a wild ditty, in the wilder language of his native land.  He had a sweet, tuneful, sympathetic voice, which was at the same time powerful, so that we listened to him, sometimes with enthusiasm swelling our hearts, at other times with tears dimming our eyes.  No one, save he who has been banished to a wilderness and long bereft of music, can understand the nature of our feelings--of mine, at least.  One evening, after our wounded man had charmed us with several songs, and we all of us had done what we could, despite our incapacity, to pay him back in kind, he pulled a sheet of crumpled paper out of his pocket.  \"Come,\" said he, unfolding it, \"I've got a poet among the men of Muskrat House, who has produced a song, which, if not marked by sublimity, is at least distinguished by much truth.  He said he composed it at the rate of about one line a week during the winter, and his comrades said that it was quite a picture to see him agonising over the rhymes.  Before they found out what was the matter with him they thought he was becoming subject to fits of some sort.  Now, then, let's have a good chorus. It's to the tune of `The British Grenadiers.'\"  THE WORLD OF ICE AND SNOW.    Come listen all good people who dwell at home at ease,   I'll tell you of the sorrows of them that cross the seas   And penetrate the wilderness,   Where arctic tempests blow--   Where your toes are froze,   An' the pint o' your nose,   In the world of Ice and Snow.    You've eight long months of winter an' solitude profound,   The snow at your feet is ten feet deep and frozen hard the ground.   And all the lakes are solid cakes,   And the rivers all cease to flow--   Where your toes are froze,   An' the pint o' your nose,   In the world of Ice and Snow.    No comrade to enliven; no friendly foe to fight;   No female near to love or cheer with pure domestic light;   No books to read; no cause to plead;   No music, fun, nor go--   Ne'er a shillin', nor a stiver,   Nor nothin' whatsomediver,   In the world of Ice and Snow.    Your feelin's take to freezin', so likewise takes your brain;   You go about grump-and-wheezin', like a wretched dog in pain;   You long for wings, or some such things,   But they're not to be had--oh! no--   For there you are,   Like a _fixed_ star,   In the world of Ice and Snow.    If you wished you could--you would not, for the very wish   would die.   If you thought you would--you could not, for you wouldn't   have heart to try.   Confusion worse confounded,   Would aggravate you so--   That you'd tumble down   On the frozen ground   In the world of Ice and Snow.    But \"never-give-in\" our part is--let British pluck have sway   And \"never-say-die,\" my hearties--it's that what wins the day.   To face our fate in every state,   Is what we've got to do,   An' laugh at our trouble   Till we're all bent double--   In the world of Ice and Snow.    Now all ye sympathisers, and all ye tender souls;   Ye kind philanthropisers, who dwell between the poles,   Embrace in your affections   Those merry merry men who go--   Where your toes are froze,   An' the pint o' your nose,   In the world of Ice and Snow.  It almost seemed as though the world of ice and snow itself had taken umbrage at Macnab's song, for, while we were yet in the act of enthusiastically prolonging the last \"sno-o-ow,\" there sounded in our ears a loud report, as if of heavy artillery close at hand.  We all leaped up in excitement, as if an enemy were at our doors.  \"There it goes at last!\" cried Lumley, rushing out of the house followed by Spooner.  I was about to follow when Macnab stopped me.  \"Don't get excited, Max, there's no hurry!\"  \"It's the river going to break up,\" said I, looking back impatiently.  \"Yes, I know that, but it won't break up to-night, depend on it.\"  I was too eager to wait for more, but ran to the banks of the river, which at that place was fully a mile wide.  The moon was bright, and we could see the familiar sheet of ice as still and cold as we had seen it every day for many months past.  \"Macnab's right,\" said I, \"there will be no breakup to-night.\"  \"Not so sure of that,\" returned Lumley; \"the weather has been very warm of late; melting snow has been gushing into it in thousands of streams, and the strain on the ice--six feet thick though it is--must be tremendous.\"  He was checked by another crashing report; but again silence ensued, and we heard no more till next morning.  Of course we were all up and away to the river bank long before breakfast, but it was not till after that meal that the final burst-up occurred.  It was preceded by many reports--towards the end by what seemed quite a smart artillery fire. The whole sheet of ice on the great river seemed to be rising bodily upwards from the tremendous hydraulic pressure underneath.  But though the thaws of spring had converted much snow into floods of water, they had not greatly affected the surface of the ice, which still lay hard and solid in all its wintry strength.  A greater Power, however, was present.  If the ice had been made of cast-iron six feet in thickness, it must have succumbed sooner or later.  At last, as Macnab said, \"She went!\" but who shall describe _how_ she went?  It seemed as if the mighty cake had been suddenly struck from below and shattered.  Then the turmoil that ensued was grand and terrible beyond conception.  It was but an insignificant portion of God's waters at which we gazed, but how overwhelming it seemed to us! Mass rose upon mass of ice, the cold grey water bursting through and over all, hurling morsels as large as the side of a house violently on each other, till a mighty pile was raised which next moment fell with a crash into the boiling foam.  Then, in one direction there was a rush which seemed about to carry all before it, but instead of being piled upwards, some of the masses were driven below, were thrust deep into the mud, and a jam took place.  In a few minutes the ice burst upwards again, and the masses were swept on to join the battalions that were already on their way towards the distant lake amid noise and crash and devastation.  It seemed as if ice and snow and water had combined to revive the picture if not the reality of ancient chaos!  Thus the drapery of winter was rudely swept away, and next morning we had the joy of seeing our river sweeping grandly on in all the liquid beauty of early and welcome spring.    CHAPTER SIX.  AN EXPRESS AND ITS RESULTS.  Some weeks after the breaking up of the ice, as we were standing at the front gate of Fort Dunregan, we experienced a pleasant surprise at the sight of an Indian canoe sweeping round the point above the fort.  Two men paddled the canoe, one in the bow and one in the stern.  It conveyed a message from headquarters directing that two of the clerks should be sent to establish an outpost in the regions of the far north, the very region from which Macnab's friend Big Otter had come.  One of the two canoe-men was a clerk sent to undertake, at Dunregan, the work of those who should be selected for the expedition, and he said that another clerk was to follow in the spring-brigade of boats.  \"That's marching orders for _you_, Lumley,\" said Macnab, who was beside us when the canoe arrived.  \"You cannot tell that,\" returned Lumley.  \"It may be that our chief will select Max or Spooner.  Did you hear any mention of names?\" he asked of the new clerk, as we all walked up to the house.  \"No, our governor does not tell us much of his intentions.  Perhaps your chief may be the man.\"  \"He's too useful where he is,\" suggested Macnab.  \"But we shall know when the letters are opened.\"  Having delivered his despatches, the new arrival returned to us in Batchelors' Hall, where we soon began to make the most of him, and were engaged in a brisk fire of question and reply, when a message came for Mr Lumley to go to the mess-room.  \"I've sent for you, Lumley,\" said our chief, \"to say that you have been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21719"],["title","Blue Lights: Hot Work in the Soudan (#0)"],["body","LIGHTS, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  HOT WORK IN THE SOUDAN.  THE FALSE STEP.  There is a dividing ridge in the great northern wilderness of America, whereon lies a lakelet of not more than twenty yards in diameter.  It is of crystal clearness and profound depth, and on the still evenings of the Indian summer its surface forms a perfect mirror, which might serve as a toilet-glass for a Redskin princess.  We have stood by the side of that lakelet and failed to note the slightest symptom of motion in it, yet somewhere in its centre there was going on a constant and mysterious division of watery particles, and those of them which glided imperceptibly to the right flowed southward to the Atlantic, while those that trembled to the left found a resting-place by the frozen shores of Hudson's Bay.  As it is with the flow and final exit of those waters, so is it, sometimes, if not always, with the spirit and destiny of man.  Miles Milton, our hero, at the age of nineteen, stood at the dividing ridge of his life.  If the oscillating spirit, trembling between right and wrong, had decided to lean to the right, what might have been his fate no one can tell.  He paused on the balance a short time, then he leaned over to the left, and what his fate was it is the purpose of this volume to disclose.  At the outset, we may remark that it was not unmixed good.  Neither was it unmitigated evil.  Miles had a strong body, a strong will, and a somewhat passionate temper: a compound which is closely allied to dynamite!  His father, unfortunately, was composed of much the same materials.  The consequences were sometimes explosive.  It might have profited the son much had he studied the Scripture lesson, \"Children, obey your parents in the Lord.\"  Not less might it have benefited the father to have pondered the words, \"Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.\"  Young Milton had set his heart on going into the army.  Old Milton had resolved to thwart the desire of his son.  The mother Milton, a meek and loving soul, experienced some hard times between the two.  Both loved _her_ intensely, and each loved himself, not better perhaps, but too much!  It is a sad task to have to recount the disputes between a father and a son.  We shrink from it and turn away.  Suffice it to say that one day Miles and his father had a Vesuvian meeting on the subject of the army. The son became petulant and unreasonable; the father fierce and tyrannical.  The end was that they parted in anger.  \"Go, sir,\" cried the father sternly; \"when you are in a better frame of mind you may return.\"  \"Yes, father, I will go,\" cried the son, starting up, \"and I will _never_ return.\"  Poor youth!  He was both right and wrong in this prophetic speech.  He did return home, but he did not return to his father.  With fevered pulse and throbbing heart he rushed into a plantation that lay at the back of his father's house.  He had no definite intention save to relieve his feelings by violent action.  Running at full speed, he came suddenly to a disused quarry that was full of water.  It had long been a familiar haunt as a bathing-pool.  Many a time in years past had he leaped off its precipitous margin into the deep water, and wantoned there in all the abandonment of exuberant youth.  The leap was about thirty feet, the depth of water probably greater.  Constant practice had rendered Miles so expert at diving and swimming that he had come to feel as much at home in the water as a New-Zealander.  Casting off his garments, he took the accustomed plunge by way of cooling his heart and brain.  He came up from the depths refreshed, but not restored to equanimity.  While dressing, the sense of injustice returned as strongly as before, and, with it, the hot indignation, so that, on afterwards reaching the highway, he paused only for a few moments.  This was the critical point.  Slowly but decidedly he leaned to the left.  He turned his back on his father's house, and caused the stones to spurt from under his heels as he walked rapidly away.  If Miles Milton had thought of his mother at that time he might have escaped many a day of bitter repentance, for she was as gentle as her husband was harsh; but the angry youth either forgot her at the moment, or, more probably, thrust the thought of her away.  Poor mother! if she had only known what a conflict between good and evil was going on in the breast of her boy, how she would have agonised in prayer for him!  But she did not know.  There was, however, One who did know, who loved him better even than his mother, and who watched and guarded him throughout all his chequered career.  It is not improbable that in spite of his resolves Miles would have relented before night and returned home had not a very singular incident intervened and closed the door behind him.  That day a notorious swindler had been tracked by a red-haired detective to the manufacturing city, to which Miles first directed his steps.  The bills describing the swindler set forth that he was quite young, tall, handsome, broad-shouldered, with black curling hair, and a budding moustache; that he was dressed in grey tweeds, and had a prepossessing manner.  Now this chanced to be in some respects an exact description of Miles Milton!  The budding moustache, to be sure, was barely discernible, still it was sufficiently so for a detective to found on.  His dress, too, was brown tweed, not grey; but of course dresses can be changed; and as to his manner, there could not be two opinions about that.  Now it chanced to be past one o'clock when Miles entered the town and felt himself impelled by familiar sensations to pause in front of an eating-house.  It was a poor eating-house in a low district, but Miles was not particular; still further, it was a temperance coffee-house, but Miles cared nothing for strong drink.  Strong health and spirits had served his purpose admirably up to that date.  Inside the eating-house there sat several men of the artisan class, and a few of the nondescript variety.  Among the latter was the red-haired detective.  He was engaged with a solid beef-steak.  \"Oho!\" escaped softly from his lips, when his sharp eyes caught sight of our hero.  So softly did he utter the exclamation that it might have been a mere remark of appreciation addressed to the steak, from which he did not again raise his eyes for a considerable time.  The place was very full of people--so full that there seemed scarcely room for another guest; but by some almost imperceptible motion the red-haired man made a little space close to himself.  The man next to him, with a hook-nose, widened the space by similar action, and Miles, perceiving that there was room, sat down.  \"Bread and cheese,\" he said to the waiter.  \"Bread an' cheese, sir?  Yessir.\"  Miles was soon actively engaged in mechanically feeding, while his mind was busy as to future plans.  Presently he became aware that the men on either side of him were scanning his features and person with peculiar attention.  \"Coldish weather,\" remarked the red-haired man, looking at him in a friendly way.  \"It is,\" replied Miles, civilly enough.  \"Rather cold for bathin', ain't it, sir?\" continued the detective carelessly, picking his teeth with a quill.  \"How did you know that I've been bathing?\" demanded Miles in surprise.  \"I didn't know it.\"  \"How did you guess it then?\"  \"Vell, it ain't difficult to guess that a young feller 'as bin 'avin' a swim w'en you see the 'air of 'is 'ead hall vet, an' 'is pocket-'ankercher lookin' as if it 'ad done dooty for a towel, not to mention 'is veskit 'avin' bin putt on in a 'urry, so as the buttons ain't got into the right 'oles, you see!\"  Miles laughed, and resumed his bread and cheese.  \"You are observant, I perceive,\" he said.  \"Not wery partiklarly so,\" returned Redhair; \"but I do obsarve that your boots tell of country roads.  Was it a long way hout of town as you was bathin' this forenoon, now?\"  There was a free and easy familiarity about the man's tone which Miles resented, but, not wishing to run the risk of a disagreement in such company, he answered quietly--\"Yes, a considerable distance; it was in an old quarry where I often bathe, close to my father's house.\"  \"Ha! jest so, about 'alf-way to the willage of Ramplin', w'ere you slep' last night, if report speaks true, an' w'ere you left the _grey tweeds_, unless, p'r'aps, you sunk 'em in the old quarry.\"  \"Why, what on earth do you mean?\" asked Miles, with a look of such genuine surprise that Redhair was puzzled, and the man with the hooked nose, who had been listening attentively, looked slightly confused.  \"Read that, sir,\" said the detective, extracting a newspaper cutting from his pocket and laying it on the table before Miles.  While he read, the two men watched him with interest, so did some of those who sat near, for they began to perceive that something was \"in the wind.\"  The tell-tale blood sprang to the youth's brow as he read and perceived the meaning of the man's remarks.  At this Redhair and Hook-nose nodded to each other significantly.  \"You don't mean to say,\" exclaimed Miles, in a tone of grand indignation which confirmed the men in their suspicion, \"that you think this description applies to _me_?\"  \"I wouldn't insinivate too much, sir, though I have got my suspicions,\" said Redhair blandly; \"but of course that's easy settled, for if your father's 'ouse is anyw'ere hereabouts, your father won't object to identify his son.\"  \"Ridiculous!\" exclaimed Miles, rising angrily at this interruption to his plans.  The two men rose promptly at the same moment.  \"Of course my father will prove that you have made a mistake, but--\"  He hesitated in some confusion, for the idea of re-appearing before his father so soon, and in such company, after so stoutly asserting that he would _never_ more return, was humiliating.  The detective observed the hesitation and became jocose.  \"If you'd rather not trouble your parent,\""]]]
