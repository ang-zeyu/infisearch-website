Mony a battle's been lost by brave men through bad gineralship, an' mony a battle's been won by puir enough bodies o' men because of their leader's administrative abeelity, Mrs Scholtz.\"  \"Very true, Mr Black,\" replied Mrs Scholtz, with the assurance of one who thoroughly understands what she hears.  \"Noo,\" continued Sandy, with increased gravity, \"if thae Kawfir bodies we hear aboot only had chiefs wi' powers of organisation, an' was a' united thegither, they wad drive the haul o' this colony into the sea like chaff before the wind.  But they'll niver do it; for, 'ee see, they want mind--an' body withoot mind is but a puir thing after a', Mrs Scholtz.\"  \"I'm not so shure of zat,\" put in Scholtz, stretching his huge frame and regarding it complacently; \"it vould please me better to have body vidout mint, zan mint vidout body.\"  \"H'm! 'ee've reason to be pleased then,\" muttered Black, drily.  This compliment was either not appreciated by Scholtz, or he was prevented from acknowledging it by an interruption from without; for just at the moment a voice was heard asking a passer-by if he could tell where the tents of the Scotch party were pitched.  Those in the tent rose at once, and Sandy Black, issuing out found that the questioner was a handsome young Englishman, who would have appeared, what he really was, both stout and tall, if he had not been dwarfed by his companion, a Cape-Dutchman of unusually gigantic proportions.  \"We are in search of the Scottish party,\" said the youth, turning to Sandy with a polite bow; \"can you direct us to its whereabouts?\"  \"I'm no' sure that I can, sir, though I'm wan o' the Scotch pairty mysel', for me an' my freen hae lost oorsels, but doobtless Mister Dally here can help us.  May I ask what 'ee want wi' us?\"  \"Certainly,\" replied the Englishman, with a smile.  \"Mr Marais and I have been commissioned to transport you to Baviaans river in bullock-waggons, and we wish to see Mr Pringle, the head of your party, to make arrangements.--Can you guide us, Mr Dally?\"  \"Have you been to the deputy-quartermaster-general's office?\" asked Dally.  \"Yes, and they directed us to a spot said to be surrounded by evergreen bushes near this quarter of the camp.\"  \"_I_ know it--just outside the ridge between the camp and the Government offices.--Come along, sir,\" said Dally; \"I'll show you the way.\"  In a few minutes Dally led the party to a group of seven or eight tents which were surrounded by Scotch ploughs, cart-wheels, harrows, cooking utensils fire-arms, and various implements of husbandry and ironware.  \"Here come the lost ones!\" exclaimed Kenneth McTavish, who, with his active wife and sprightly daughter Jessie, was busy arranging the interior of his tent, \"and bringing strangers with them too!\"  While Sandy Black and his friend Jerry were explaining the cause of their absence to some of the Scotch party, the young Englishman introduced his friend and himself as Charles Considine and Hans Marais, to the leader, Mr Pringle, a gentleman who, besides being a good poet, afterwards took a prominent part in the first acts of that great drama-- the colonisation of the eastern frontier of South Africa.  It is unnecessary to trouble the reader with all that was said and done. Suffice it to say that arrangements were soon made.  The acting Governor, Sir Rufane Donkin, arrived on the 6th of June from a visit to Albany, the district near the sea on which a large number of the settlers were afterwards located, and from him Mr Pringle learned that the whole of the Scotch emigrants were to be located in the mountainous country watered by some of the eastern branches of the Great Fish River, close to the Kafir frontier.  The upper part of the Baviaans, or Baboons, River had been fixed for the reception of his particular section.  It was also intended by Government that a piece of unoccupied territory still farther to the eastward should be settled by a party of five hundred Highlanders, who, it was conjectured, would prove the most effective buffer available to meet the first shock of invasion, should the savages ever attempt another inroad.  Mr Pringle laid this proposed arrangement before a council of the heads of families under his charge; it was heartily agreed to, and preparations for an early start were actively begun.  On the day of his arrival Sir Rufane Donkin laid the foundation of the first house of the now wealthy and flourishing, though not very imposing, town of Port Elizabeth, so named after his deceased wife, to whose memory an obelisk was subsequently erected on the adjacent heights.  A week later, a train of seven waggons stood with the oxen \"inspanned,\" or yoked, ready to leave the camp, from which many similar trains had previously set out.  The length of such a train may be conceived when it is told that each waggon was drawn by twelve or sixteen oxen.  These were fastened in pairs to a single trace or \"trektow\" of twisted thongs of bullock or buffalo hide, strong enough for a ship's cable.  Each waggon had a canvas cover or \"till\" to protect its goods and occupants from the sun and rain, and each was driven by a tall Dutchman, who carried a bamboo whip like a salmon fishing-rod with a lash of thirty feet or more.  A slave, Hottentot or Bushman, led the two front oxen of each span.  Like pistol-shots the formidable whips went off; the oxen pulled, tossed their unwieldy horns, and bellowed; the Dutchmen growled and shouted; the half-naked \"Totties\" and Bushmen flung their arms and legs about, glared and gasped like demons; the monstrous waggons moved; \"Settlers' Town\" was slowly left behind, and our adventurers, heading for the thorny jungles of the Zwartkops River, began their toilsome journey into the land of hope and promise.  \"It's a queer beginning!\" remarked Sandy Black, as he trudged between Hans Marais and Charlie Considine.  \"I hope it will have a good ending,\" said Considine.  Whether that hope was fulfilled the reader shall find out in the sequel.  Meanwhile some of the English parties took their departure by the same route, and journeyed in company till points of divergence were reached, where many temporary friendships were brought to a close, though some there were which, although very recently formed, withstood firmly the damaging effects of time, trial, sorrow, and separation.    CHAPTER FIVE.  ADVENTURES AND INCIDENTS OF THE FIRST NIGHT IN THE \"BUSH\".  A Night-Bivouac under the mimosa-bushes of the Zwartkops River.  The Cape-waggons are drawn up in various comfortable nooks; the oxen are turned loose to graze; camp-fires are kindled.  Round these men and women group themselves very much as they do in ordinary society. Classes keep by themselves, not because one class wishes to exclude the other, but because habits, sympathies, interests, and circumstances draw like to like.  The ruddy glare of the camp-fires contrasts pleasantly with the cold light of the moon, which casts into deepest shadow the wild recesses of bush and brake, inducing many a furtive glance from the more timid of the settlers, who see an elephant, a buffalo, or a Cape \"tiger\" in every bank and stump and stone.  Their suspicions are not so wild as one might suppose, for the neighbouring jungle, called the Addo Bush, swarms with these and other wild animals.  The distance travelled on this first day was not great; the travellers were not much fatigued, but were greatly excited by novelty, which rendered them wakeful.  If one had gone round to the numerous fires and played eavesdropper, what eager discussion on the new land he would have heard; what anxious speculations; what sanguine hopes; what noble plans; what ridiculous ideas; what mad anticipations--for all were hopeful and enthusiastic.  Round one of these fires was assembled the family and retainers of our Highland farmer, Kenneth McTavish, among whom were Sandy Black and Jerry Goldboy.  They had been joined by Charlie Considine, who felt drawn somewhat to Sandy.  Quite close to these, round another fire, were grouped the three bachelor brothers Skyd, with their friend Dobson.  At another, within earshot of these, were Edwin Brook and his wife, his daughter Gertrude, Scholtz and his wife, Junkie, George Dally, and Stephen Orpin, with bluff Hans Marais, who had somehow got acquainted with the Brook family, and seemed to prefer their society to that of any other.  Down in a hollow under a thick spreading mimosa bush was the noisiest fire of all, for there were assembled some of the natives belonging to the waggons of Hans and Jan Smit.  These carried on an uproarious discussion of some sort, appealing frequently to our friend Ruyter the Hottentot, who appeared to be regarded by them as an umpire or an oracle.  The Hottentot race is a very inferior one, both mentally and physically, but there are among them individuals who rise much above the ordinary level.  Ruyter was one of these.  He had indeed the sallow visage, high cheek-bones, and dots of curly wool scattered thinly over his head, peculiar to his race, but his countenance was unusually intelligent, his frame well made and very powerful, and his expression good.  He entered heartily into the fun of attempting to teach the Hottentot klick to some of the younger men among the emigrants, who were attracted to his fire by the shouts of laughter in which the swarthy slaves and others indulged.  Abdul Jemalee, the Malay slave, was there; also Booby the Bushman--the former grave and silent, almost sad; the latter conducting himself like a monkey--to which animal he seemed closely related--and evoking shouts of laughter from a few youths, for whose special benefit he kept in the background and mimicked every one else.  \"What a noisy set they are over there!\" observed Edwin Brook, who had for some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21701"],["title","The Settler and the Savage (#8)"],["body","been quietly contemplating the energetic George Dally, as he performed the duties of cook and waiter to his party.  \"They are, sir,\" replied Dally, \"like niggers in general, fond of showing their white teeth.\"  \"Come, Gertie, your mother can spare you now; let's go over and listen to them.\"  Gertie complied with alacrity, and took her father's arm.  \"Oh!\" she exclaimed, with a little scream, as a thorn full five inches long gave her a wicked probe on the left shoulder.  Hans Marais sprang up and gallantly raised the branch which had touched her.  \"It is only Kafirs who can run against mimosa thorns with impunity,\" said the handsome young Dutchman.  Gertie laughed, remarked that mimosa thorns, like South African gentlemen, were unusually long and sharp, and passed on.  Hans sat down on the ground, filled his large pipe, and gazed dreamily into the fire, with something of the sensation of a hunter when he makes a bad shot.  \"Now then, Goliath,\" said the ever busy George Dally; \"move your long legs out o' that.  Don't you see the pot's about to bile over?\"  Hans quietly obeyed.  \"If I chanced to be alongside o' that Tottie over there just now,\" continued George, \"I'd be inclined to stop his noise with a rap on his spotted pate.\"  \"You'd have to make it a heavy rap, then, to produce any effect,\" said Hans, taking a long draw at his pipe, \"for he belongs to a hard-headed race.\"  The truth of the young farmer's words was verified just then in a way that was alarming as well as unexpected.  One of the heavy waggons, which had been delayed behind the others by some trifling accident, came lumbering up just as Hans spoke.  There was a softish sandy spot in advance of it, into which one of the front wheels plunged.  The tilt caught on part of the waggon to which Ruyter belonged.  To prevent damage the active Hottentot sprang forward.  In doing so he tripped and fell.  At the same instant a tremendous crack of the whip and a shout produced a wrench at the waggon, the hind wheel of which went over Ruyter's head and crushed it into the ground!  A roar of consternation followed, and several eager hands carefully dug out the poor man's head.  To the surprise of all, the five-ton waggon had _not_ flattened it!  The sand was so soft that it had not been squeezed at all--at least to any damaging extent,--a round stone having opportunely taken much of the pressure on itself, so that the Hottentot soon revived, and, beyond a headache, was little the worse of the accident.  He returned to his place at the fire, but did not resume his part in the discussions, which were continued as noisily as before.  In strong contrast with the other groups were those of the Dutch-African boers who had brought the waggons to the Bay.  Most of them were men of colossal stature.  They sat apart, smoking their huge pipes in silent complacency and comfort, amused a little at the scenes going on around them, but apparently disinclined to trouble themselves about anything in particular.  Supper produced a lull in the general hum of conversation, but when pipes were lit the storm revived and continued far into the night.  At last symptoms of weariness appeared, and people began to make arrangements for going to rest.  These arrangements were as varied as the characters of the emigrants.  Charlie Considine and Hans Marais, now become inseparable comrades, cleared and levelled the ground under a mimosa-bush, and, spreading their kaross thereon, lay down to sleep.  George Dally, being an adaptable man, looked at the old campaigners for a few minutes, and then imitated their example.  Little Jerry Goldboy, being naturally a nervous creature, and having his imagination filled with snakes, scorpions, tarantulas, etcetera, would fain have slept in one of the waggons above the baggage--as did many of the women and children--if he had not been laughed out of his desire by Dally, and induced to spread his couch manfully on the bare ground.  It must not be supposed, however, that Jerry, although timid, was cowardly.  On the contrary, he was bold as a lion.  He could not control his sensitively-strung nervous system, but instead of running away, like the coward, he was prone to rush furiously at whatever startled him, and grapple with it.  Some families pitched their tents, others, deeming curtains a needless luxury in such magnificent weather, contented themselves with the shelter of the bushes.  Meanwhile the Hottentot attendants replenished the fires, while the boers unslung their huge guns and placed them so as to be handy; for, although elephants and lions were not nearly so numerous as they once had been in that particular locality, there was still sufficient possibility of their presence, as well as of other nocturnal wanderers in the African wilds, to render such precaution necessary.  The whole scene was most romantic, especially in the eyes of those who thus bivouacked for the first time in the wilderness.  To them the great waggons; the gigantic Cape-oxen--which appeared to have been created expressly to match the waggons as well as to carry their own ponderous horns; the wild-looking Hottentots and Bushmen; the big phlegmatic Dutchmen; the bristling thorns of the mimosas, cropping out of comparative darkness; the varied groups of emigrants; the weird forms of the clumps of cactus, aloes, euphorbias, and other strange plants, lit up by the fitful glare of the camp-fires, and canopied by the star-spangled depths of a southern sky--all seemed to them the unbelievable creations of a wild vision.  Poor Jerry Goldboy, however, had sufficient faith in the reality of the vision to increase his nervous condition considerably, and he resolved to lie down with his \"arms handy.\"  These arms consisted of a flint-lock blunderbuss, an heirloom in his father's family, and a bowie-knife, which had been presented to him by an American cousin on his leaving England.  Twice during that day's march had the blunderbuss exploded owing to its owner's inexperience in fire-arms.  Fortunately no harm had been done, the muzzle on each occasion having been pointed to the sky, but the ire of the Dutch driver in front of Jerry had been aroused, and he was forbidden to reload the piece.  Now, however, observing the preparations above referred to, he felt it to be his duty to prepare for the worst, and quietly loaded his bell-mouthed weapon with a heavy charge of buckshot.  \"What's that you're after, boy?\" asked George Dally, who was making some final arrangements at the fire, before lying down for the night.  \"Oh, nothing,\" replied Jerry, with a start, for he had thought himself unobserved, \"only seein' to my gun before turnin' in.\"  \"That's right,\" said George.  \"Double-load it.  Nothin' like bein' ready for whatever may turn up in a wild country like this.  Why, I once knew a man named Snip who said he had been attacked one night in South America by a sarpint full forty feet long, and who saved his life by means of a blunderbuss, though he didn't fire at the reptile at all.\"  \"Indeed, how was that?\" asked Jerry.  \"Why, just because his weapon was bell-mouthed an' loaded a'most to the muzzle.  You see, the poor fellow was awoke out of a deep sleep and couldn't well see, so that instead o' firin' at the brute, he fired his blunderbuss about ten yards to one side of it, but the shot scattered so powerfully that one o' the outside bullets hit a stone, glanced off, and caught the sarpint in the eye, and though it failed to kill the brute on the spot, the wound gave it such pain that it stood up on its tail and wriggled in agony for full five minutes, sending broken twigs and dry leaves flying about like a whirlwind, so Snip he jumped up, dropped his weapon, an' bolted.  He never returned to the encampment, and never saw the big snake or his blunderbuss again.\"  \"What a pity! then he lost it?\" said Jerry, looking with some anxiety at a decayed branch, to which the flickering flame gave apparent motion.  \"Yes, he lost the blunderbuss, but he saved his life,\" replied Dally, as he lay down near his little friend and drew his blanket over him. \"You'd better put the gun between us, my boy, to be handy to both--an' if _anything_ comes, the one of us that wakes first can lay hold of it and fire.\"  There was, we need scarcely observe, a strong spice of wickedness in George.  If he had suggested a lion, or even an elephant, there would have been something definite for poor Jerry's anxious mind to lay hold of and try to reason down and defy, but that dreadful \"_anything_\" that might come, gave him nothing to hold by.  It threw the whole zoological ferocities of South Africa open to his unanchored imagination, and for a long time banished sleep from his eyes.  He allowed the blunderbuss to remain as his friend had placed it, and hugged the naked bowie-knife to his breast.  In addition to these weapons he had provided himself with a heavy piece of wood, something like the exaggerated truncheon of a policeman, for the purpose of killing snakes, should any such venture near his couch.  The wild shrieks of laughter at the neighbouring Hottentot fire helped to increase Jerry's wakefulness, and when this at last lulled, the irritation was kept up by the squalling of Master Junkie, whose tent was about three feet distant from Jerry's pillow, and who kept up a vicious piping just in proportion to the earnestness of Mrs Scholtz's attempts to calm him.  At last, however, the child's lamentations ceased, and there broke upon the night air a sweet sound which stilled the merriment of the natives. It was the mellow voice of Stephen Orpin singing a hymn of praise, with a number of like-minded emigrants, before retiring to rest.  Doubtless some of those who had already retired, and lay, perchance, watching the stars and thinking dreamily of home, were led naturally by the sweet hymn to think of the home in the \"better land,\" which might possibly be nearer to some of them than the old home they had left for"]]]
