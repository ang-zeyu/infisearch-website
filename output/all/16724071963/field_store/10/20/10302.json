Everybody seems to be mad.  I think you must be mad yourself, to come here such a figure as that; and I'm quite sure _I_ shall go mad if you don't explain it to me.  What _does_ it all mean?\"  \"California,\" replied Mr Shirley, becoming more sarcastic in expression and less pitiful.  \"Why, that's what everybody cries,\" exclaimed Ned, who was now driven almost to desperation.  \"My dear uncle, do look like yourself and exercise some of your wonted sagacity.  Just glance round at the cave and the company, all made of gold, and look at me--gold too, if not pinchbeck, but I'm not a good-enough judge of metals to tell which. What _has_ done it, uncle?  _Do_ look in a better humour, and tell me how it has happened.\"  \"California,\" replied Mr Shirley.  \"Yes, yes; I know that.  California seems to be everything here.  But how has it come about?  Why are _you_ here, and what has brought me here?\"  \"California,\" repeated Mr Shirley.  \"Uncle, I'll go deranged if you don't answer me.  What do you mean?\"  \"California,\" reiterated Mr Shirley.  At the same moment a stout golden lady with a filigree turban shouted, \"for ever!\" at the top of a very shrill voice, and immediately the company took up the cry again, filling the cave with deafening sounds.  Ned Sinton gave one look of despair at his relative--then turned and fled.  \"Put him out,\" shouted the company.  \"Down with the intruder!\"  Ned cast a single glance backward, and beheld the people pushing and buffeting his uncle in a most unceremonious manner.  His helmet was knocked down over his eyes, and the coat--so much too small for him--was rendered an easy fit by being ripped up behind to the neck.  Ned could not stand this.  He was stout of limb and bold as a lion, although not naturally addicted to fighting, so he turned suddenly round and flew to the rescue.  Plunging into the midst of the struggling mass of golden creatures, Ned hit out right and left like a young Hercules, and his blows rang upon their metal chests and noses like the sound of sledge-hammers, but without any other effect.  Suddenly he experienced an acute sensation of pain, and--awoke to find himself hammering the bed-post with bleeding knuckles, and his uncle standing beside his bed chuckling immensely.  \"O uncle,\" cried Ned, sitting up in his bed, and regarding his knuckles with a perplexed expression of countenance, \"I've had _such_ an extraordinary dream!\"  \"Ay, Ned,\" interrupted his uncle, \"and all about California, I'll be bound.\"  \"Why, how did you guess that?\"  \"It needs not a wizard to guess that, lad.  I've observed that you have read nothing in the newspapers for the last three months but the news from the gold-diggings of California.  Your mind has of late been constantly running on that subject, and it is well-known that day-dreams are often reproduced at night.  Besides, I heard you shouting the word in your sleep as I entered your room.  Were you fighting with gold-diggers, eh! or Indians?\"  \"Neither, uncle; but I was fighting with very strange beings, I assure you, and--\"  \"Well, well,\" interrupted Mr Shirley, \"never mind the dream just now; we shall have it at some other time.  I have important matters to talk over with you, my boy.  Morton has written to me.  Get up and come down as quickly as you can, and we'll discuss the matter over our breakfast.\"  As the door closed after the retreating form of his uncle, Edward Sinton leaped out of bed and into his trousers.  During his toilet he wondered what matters of importance Mr Shirley could intend to discuss with him, and felt half inclined to fear, from the grave expression of his uncle's face when he spoke of it, that something of a disagreeable nature awaited him.  But these thoughts were intermingled with reminiscences of the past night.  His knuckles, too, kept constantly reminding him of his strange encounter, and, do what he would, he could not banish from his mind the curious incidents of that remarkable golden dream.    CHAPTER TWO.  OUR HERO.  We have entered thus minutely into the details of our hero's dream, because it was the climax to a long series of day-dreams, in which he had indulged ever since the discovery of gold in California.  Edward Sinton was a youth of eighteen at the time of which we write, and an orphan.  He was tall, strong, broad-shouldered, fair-haired, blue-eyed, Roman-nosed, and gentle as a lamb.  This last statement may perhaps appear inconsistent with the fact that, during the whole course of his school-life, he had a pitched battle every week--sometimes two or three in the week.  Ned never began a fight, and, indeed, did not like fighting.  But some big boys _will_ domineer over little ones, and Ned would not be domineered over; consequently he had to be thrashed.  He was possessed, even in boyhood, of an amount of physical courage that would have sufficed for any two ordinary men.  He did not boast.  He did not quarrel.  He never struck the first blow, but, if twenty boys had attacked him, he would have tried to fight them all.  He never tyrannised over small boys.  It was not his nature to do so; but he was not perfect, any more than you are, dear reader.  He sometimes punched small boys' heads when they worried him, though he never did so without repenting of it, and doing them a kindness afterwards in order to make up.  He was very thoughtless, too, and very careless; nevertheless he was fond of books--specially of books of adventure--and studied these like a hero--as he was.  Boys of his own size, or even a good deal bigger, never fought with Ned Sinton.  They knew better than that; but they adored him, in some cases envied him, and in all cases trusted and followed him.  It was only _very_ big boys who fought with him, and all they got by it was a good deal of hard pummelling before they floored their little adversary, and a good deal of jeering from their comrades for fighting a small boy. From one cause or another, Ned's visage was generally scratched, often cut, frequently swelled, and almost always black and blue.  But as Ned grew older, the occasions for fighting became less frequent; his naturally amiable disposition improved, (partly owing, no doubt, to the care of his uncle, who was, in every sense of the term, a good old man,) and when he attained the age of fifteen and went to college, and was called \"Sinton,\" instead of \"Ned,\" his fighting days were over.  No man in his senses would have ventured to attack that strapping youth with the soft blue eyes, the fair hair, the prominent nose, and the firm but smiling lips, or, if he had, he would have had to count on an hour's extremely hard work, whether the fortune of war went for or against him.  When Ned had been three years at college, his uncle hinted that it was time to think of a profession, and suggested that as he was a first-rate mathematician, and had been fond of mechanics from his childhood, he should turn an engineer.  Ned would probably have agreed to this cheerfully, had not a thirst for adventure been created by the stirring accounts which had begun to arrive at this time from the recently-discovered gold-fields of California.  His enthusiastic spirit was stirred, not so much by the prospect of making a large fortune suddenly by the finding of a huge nugget--although that was a very pleasant idea--as by the hope of meeting with wild adventures in that imperfectly-known and distant land.  And the effect of such dreams was to render the idea of sitting down to an engineer's desk, or in a mercantile counting-room, extremely distasteful.  Thus it came to pass that Edward Sinton felt indisposed to business, and disposed to indulge in golden visions.  When he entered the breakfast-parlour, his mind was still full of his curious dream.  \"Come along, my lad,\" cried Mr Shirley, laying down the Bible, and removing his spectacles from a pair of eyes that usually twinkled with a sort of grave humour, but in which there was now an expression of perplexity; \"set to work and get the edge off your appetite, and then I'll read Moxton's letter.\"  When Mr Shirley had finished breakfast, Ned was about half done, having just commenced his third slice of toast.  So the old gentleman complimented his nephew on the strength of his appetite, put on his spectacles, drew a letter from his pocket, and leaned back in his chair.  \"Now, lad, open your ears and consider what I am about to read.\"  \"Go on, uncle, I'm all attention,\" said Ned, attacking slice number four.  \"This is Moxton's letter.  It runs thus--  \"`Dear Sir,--I beg to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 5th inst.  I shall be happy to take your nephew on trial, and, if I find him steady, shall enter into an engagement with him, I need not add that unremitting application to business is the only road to distinction in the profession he is desirous of adopting.  Let him call at my office to-morrow between ten and twelve.--Yours very truly, Daniel Moxton.'\"  \"Is that all?\" inquired Ned, drawing his chair towards the fire, into which he gazed contemplatively.  Mr Shirley looked at his nephew over the top of his spectacles, and said--  \"That's all.\"  \"It's very short,\" remarked Ned.  \"But to the point,\" rejoined his uncle.  \"Now, boy, I see that you don't relish the idea, and I must say that I would rather that you became an engineer than a lawyer; but then, lad, situations are difficult to get now-a-days, and, after all, you might do worse than become a lawyer.  To be sure, I have no great love for the cloth, Ned; but the ladder reaches very high.  The foot is crowded with a struggling mass of aspirants, many of whom are of very questionable character, but the top reaches to one of the highest positions in the empire.  You might become the Lord High Chancellor at last, who knows!  But"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21734"],["title","The Golden Dream: Adventures in the Far West (#2)"],["body","riously, I think you should accept this offer.  Moxton is a grave, stern man, but a sterling fellow for all that, and in good practice.  Now, what do you think!\"  \"Well, uncle,\" replied Ned, \"I've never concealed my thoughts from you since the day you took me by the hand, eleven years ago, and brought me to live under your roof; and I'll not begin to dissemble now.  The plain truth is, that I don't like it at all.\"  \"Stop, now,\" cried Mr Shirley, with a grieved expression of countenance; \"don't be hasty in forming your opinion.  Besides, my boy, you ought to be more ready to take my advice, even although it be not altogether palatable.\"  \"My dear uncle, you quite misunderstand me.  I only tell you what I _think_ about the proposal.  As to taking your advice, I fully intend to do that whether I like it or not; but I think, if you will listen to me for a few minutes, you will change your mind in regard to this matter. You know that I am very fond of travelling, and that I dislike the idea of taking up my abode on the top of a three-legged stool, either as a lawyer's or a merchant's clerk.  Well, unless a man likes his profession, and goes at it with a will, he cannot hope to succeed, so that I have no prospect of getting on, I fear, in the line you wish me to adopt.  Besides, there are plenty of poor fellows out of work, who love sitting still from nine a.m. to ten p.m., and whose bread I would be taking out of their mouths by devoting myself to the legal profession, and--\"  At this point Ned hesitated for a moment, and his uncle broke in with--  \"Tell me, now, if every one thought about business as you do, how would the world get on, think you?\"  \"Badly, I fear,\" replied the youth, with a smile; \"but everybody doesn't think of it as I do; and, tell me, uncle, if everybody thought of business as you would wish me to do, what would come of the soldiers and sailors who defend our empire, and extend our foreign trade, and achieve the grand geographical discoveries that have of late added so much lustre to the British name?\"  Ned flushed and became quite eloquent at this point.  \"Now, look at California,\" he continued; \"there's a magnificent region, full of gold; not a mere myth, or an exaggeration, but a veritable fact, attested by the arrival of letters and gold-dust every month.  Surely that land was made to be peopled; and the poor savages who dwell there need to be converted to Christianity, and delivered from their degraded condition; and the country must be worked, and its resources be developed; and who's to do it, if enterprising clergymen, and schoolmasters, and miners do not go to live there, and push their fortunes?\"  \"And which of the three callings do you propose adopting?\" inquired Mr Shirley, with a peculiar smile.  \"Well uncle, I--a--the fact is, I have not thought much about that as yet.  Of course, I never thought of the first.  I do not forget your own remark, that the calling of a minister of the gospel of Christ is not, like other professions, to be adopted merely as a means of livelihood. Then, as to the second, I might perhaps manage that; but I don't think it would suit me.\"  \"Do you think, then, that you would make a good digger?\"  \"Well, perhaps I would,\" replied Ned, modestly.  Mr Shirley gravely regarded the powerful frame that reclined in the easy-chair before him, and was compelled to admit that the supposition was by no means outrageous.  \"Besides,\" continued the youth, \"I might turn my hand to many things in a new country.  You know I have studied surveying, and I can sketch a little, and know something of architecture.  I suppose that Latin and Greek would not be of much use, but the little I have picked up of medicine and surgery among the medical students would be useful.  Then I could take notes, and sketch the scenery, and bring back a mass of material that might interest the public, and do good to the country.\"  \"Oh,\" said the old gentleman, shortly; \"come back and turn author, in fact, and write a book that nobody would publish, or which, in the event of its being published, nobody would read!\"  \"Come, now, my dear uncle, don't laugh at me.  I assure you it seems very reasonable to me to think that what others have done, and are doing every day, I am able to do.\"  \"Well, I won't laugh at you; but, to be serious, you are wise enough to know that an old man's experience is worth more than a youth's fancies. Much of what you have said is true, I admit, but I assure you that the bright prospects you have cut out for yourself are very delusive.  They will never be realised, at least in the shape in which you have depicted them on your imagination.  They will dissolve, my boy, on a nearer approach, and, as Shakespeare has it, `like the baseless fabric of a vision, leave not a wrack behind,' or, at least, not much more than a wrack.\"  Ned reverted to the golden dream, and felt uneasy under his uncle's kind but earnest gaze.  \"Most men,\" continued Mr Shirley, \"enjoy themselves at first, when they go to wild countries in search of adventure, but they generally regret the loss of their best years afterwards.  In my opinion men should never emigrate unless they purpose making the foreign land they go to their _home_.  But I won't oppose you, if you are determined to go; I will do all I can to help you, and give you my blessing; but before you make up your mind, I would recommend you to call on Mr Moxton, and hear what prospects he holds out to you.  Then take a week to think seriously over it; and if at the end of that time, you are as anxious to go as ever, I'll not stand in your way.\"  \"You are kind to me, uncle; more so than I deserve,\" said Ned earnestly. \"I'll do as you desire, and you may depend upon it that the generous way in which you have left me to make my own choice will influence me against going abroad more than anything else.\"  Ned sighed as he rose to quit the room, for he felt that his hopes at that moment were sinking.  \"And before you take a step in the matter, my boy,\" said old Mr Shirley, \"go to your room and ask counsel of Him who alone has the power to direct your steps in this life.\"  Ned replied briefly, \"I will, uncle,\" and hastily left the room.  Mr Shirley poked the fire, put on his spectacles, smoothed out the wrinkles on his bald forehead with his hand, took up the _Times_, and settled himself down in his easy-chair to read; but his nephew's prospects could not be banished from his mind.  He went over the whole argument again, mentally, with copious additions, ere he became aware of the fact, that for three-quarters of an hour he had been, (apparently), reading the newspaper upside down.    CHAPTER THREE.  HOPES AND FEARS--MR. SHIRLEY RECEIVES A VISIT AND A WILD PROPOSAL.  When Edward Sinton left his chamber, an hour after the conversation related in the last chapter, his brow was unruffled and his step light. He had made up his mind that, come what might, he would not resist the wishes of his only near relative and his best friend.  There was a day in the period of early boyhood that remained as fresh on the memory of young Sinton as if it had been yesterday--the day on which his mother died.  The desolation of his early home on that day was like the rising of a dark thunder-cloud on a bright sky.  His young heart was crushed, his mind stunned, and the first ray of light that broke upon him--the first gush of relief--was when his uncle arrived and took him on his knee, and, seated beside the bed where that cold, still form lay, wept upon the child's neck as if his heart would break.  Mr Shirley buried the sister whom he had been too late to see alive.  Then he and his little nephew left the quiet country village and went to dwell in the great city of London.  From that time forward Mr Shirley was a father to Ned, who loved him more than any one else on earth, and through his influence he was early led to love and reverence his heavenly Father and his blessed Redeemer.  The subject of going abroad was the first in regard to which Ned and his uncle had seriously disagreed, and the effect on the feelings of both was very strong.  Ned's mind wandered as he put on his hat, and buttoned his great-coat up to the chin, and drew on his gloves slowly.  He was not vain of his personal appearance; neither was he reckless of it.  He always struck you as being a particularly well-dressed man, and he had naturally a dashing look about him.  Poor fellow! he felt anything but dashing or reckless as he hurried through the crowded streets in the direction of the city that day.  Moxton's door was a green one, with a brass knocker and a brass plate, both of which ornaments, owing to verdigris, were anything but ornamental.  The plate was almost useless, being nearly illegible, but the knocker was still fit for duty.  The street was narrow--as Ned observed with a feeling of deep depression--and the house to which the green door belonged, besides being dirty, retreated a little, as if it were ashamed of itself.  On the knocker being applied, the green door was opened by a disagreeable-looking old woman, who answered to the question, \"Is Mr Moxton in?\" with a short \"Yes,\" and, without farther remark, ushered our hero into a very dingy and particularly small office, which, owing to the insufficient quantity of daylight that struggled through the dirty little windows, required to be lighted with gas.  Ned felt, so to speak, like a thermometer which was falling rapidly.  \"Can I see Mr Moxton?\" he inquired of a small dishevelled clerk, who sat on a tall stool behind a high desk, engaged in writing his name in every imaginable form on a sheet of note paper.  The dishevelled clerk pointed to a door which opened into an inner apartment, and resumed his occupation.  Ned tapped at the door indicated.  \"Come in,\" cried a stern voice.  Ned, (as a thermometer), fell considerably lower.  On entering, he beheld a tall, gaunt man, with a sour cast of countenance, standing with his back to the"]]]
