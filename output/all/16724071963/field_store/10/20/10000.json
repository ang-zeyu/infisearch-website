Unwilling to leave the land of their fore-fathers, and seeing no other way of procuring the means of intoxication which they coveted, they sold themselves and their services to the white colonists, content to take care of those herds which had once been their own, and to lead them out to pasture on the very lands which had once been their birthright.\"  \"Did they then become slaves?\" inquired Alexander.  \"No; although much worse treated, they never were slaves, and I wish to point that out; but they became a sort of feudal property of the Dutch, compelled to hire themselves out, and to work for them upon nominal wages, which they seldom or never received, and liable to every species of harsh treatment and cruelty, for which they could obtain no redress. Yet still they were not bought and sold as were the slaves which were subsequently introduced into the colony from the east coast of Africa and Madagascar.  The position of the slaves was, in my opinion, infinitely superior, merely from the self-interest of the owner, who would not kill or risk the life of a creature for whom he had paid two or three hundred rixdollars; whereas, the Dutch boors, or planters, thought little of the life of a Hottentot.  If the cattle were to be watched where lions were plentiful, it was not a slave who had charge of them, but a Hottentot, as he had cost nothing, and the planter could procure another.  In short, the life of a Hottentot was considered as of no value, and there is no denying that they were shot by their masters or employers upon the most trifling offence.\"  \"How dreadful! but did the Dutch government suffer this?\"  \"They could not well help it, and therefore were compelled to wink at it; the criminals were beyond its reach.  But now I will proceed to give you some further insight, by describing the Dutch boors, or planters, who usurped and stood in the shoes of the poor Hottentots.  \"The Dutch government seized upon all the land belonging to the Hottentots, and gave it away in grants to their own countrymen, who now became herdsmen, and possessed of a large quantity of cattle; they also cultivated the ground to a certain extent round about their habitations. As the colony increased, so did the demand for land, until the whole of the country that was worth having was disposed of as far as to the country of the Caffres, a fine warlike race, of whom we will speak hereafter.  It must not, however, be supposed that the whole of the Hottentot tribes became serfs to the soil.  Some few drove away their cattle to the northward, out of reach of the Dutch, to the borders of the Caffre-land; others, deprived of their property, left the plains, and took to the mountains, living by the chase and by plunder.  This portion were termed boshmen, or bushmen, and have still retained that appellation: living in extreme destitution, sleeping in caves, constantly in a state of starvation, they soon dwindled down to a very diminutive race, and have continued so ever since.  \"The Dutch boors, or planters, who lived in the interior, and far away from Cape Town, had many enemies to contend with: they had the various beasts of the forest, from the lion to the jackal, which devastated their flocks and herds, and also these bushmen, who lived upon plunder. Continually in danger, they were never without their muskets in their hands, and they and their descendants became an athletic, powerful, and bulky race, courageous, and skilled in the use of fire-arms, but at the same time cruel and avaricious to the highest degree.  The absolute power they possessed over the slaves and Hottentots demoralised them, and made them tyrannical and bloodthirsty.  At too great a distance from the seat of government for its power to reach them, they defied it, and knew no law but their own imperious wills, acknowledging no authority,-- guilty of every crime openly, and careless of detection.\"  \"I certainly have read of great cruelty on the part of these Dutch boors, but I had no idea of the extent to which it was carried.\"  \"The origin was in that greatest of all curses, slavery; nothing demoralises so much.  These boors had been brought up with the idea that a Hottentot, a bushman, or a Caffre were but as the mere brutes of the field, and they have treated them as such.  They would be startled at the idea of murdering a white man, but they will execute wholesale slaughter among these poor natives, and think they have committed no crime.  But the ladies are coming up, and we shall be interrupted, so I will not task your patience any more to-day.  I shall therefore conclude what I may term part the first of my little history of the Cape colony.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  Alexander Wilmot was too much pleased with Mr Swinton not to cultivate his acquaintance, and they soon became very intimate.  The conversation often turned upon Mr Swinton's favourite study, that of natural history.  \"I confess myself wholly ignorant of the subject,\" observed Alexander one day, \"though I feel that it must be interesting to those who study it; indeed, when I have walked through the museums, I have often wished that I had some one near who could explain to me what I wished to know and was puzzled about.  But it appears to me that the study of natural history is such an immense undertaking if you comprehend all its branches.  Let me see,--there is botany, mineralogy, and geology--these are included, are they not?\"  \"Most certainly,\" replied Mr Swinton, laughing; \"and perhaps the three most interesting branches.  Then you have zoology, or the study of animals, ornithology for birds, entomology for insects, conchology for shells, ichthyology for fishes; all very hard names, and enough to frighten a young beginner.  But I can assure you, a knowledge of these subjects, to an extent sufficient to create interest and afford continual amusement, is very easily acquired.\"  \"`The proper study of mankind is man,' says the poet,\"--observed Alexander, smiling.  \"Poets deal in fiction, Mr Wilmot,\" replied Mr Swinton; \"to study man is only to study his inconsistencies and his aberrations from the right path, which the free-will permitted to him induces him to follow; but in the study of nature, you witness the directing power of the Almighty, who guides with an unerring hand, and who has so wonderfully apportioned out to all animals the means of their providing for themselves.  Not only the external, but the inward structure of animals, shows such variety, and ingenuity to surmount all difficulties, and to afford them all the enjoyment their nature is capable of, that after every examination you rise with increased astonishment and admiration at the condescension and goodness of the Master Hand, thus to calculate and provide for the necessities of the smallest insect; and you are compelled to exclaim with the Psalmist, `O God, how manifold are thy works; in wisdom hast thou made them all!'\"  \"You certainly do put the study in a new and most pleasurable light,\" replied Alexander.  \"The more you search into nature, the more wonderful do you find her secrets, and, by the aid of chemistry, we are continually making new discoveries.  Observe, Mr Wilmot,\" said Swinton picking up a straw which had been blown by the wind on the quarter-deck, \"do you consider that there is any analogy between this straw and the flint in the lock of that gun?\"  \"Certainly, I should imagine them as opposite particles of nature as well might be.\"  \"Such is not the case.  This piece of wheat-straw contains more than sixty per cent of silica or flint in its composition; so that, although a vegetable, it is nearly two-thirds composed of the hardest mineral substance we know of.  You would scarcely believe that the fibres of the root of this plant were capable of dissolving, feeding upon, and digesting such a hard substance; but so it is.\"  \"It is very wonderful.\"  \"It is, but it is not a solitary instance; the phosphate of lime, which is the chief component part of the bones of animals, is equally sought by plants, dissolved in the same manner, and taken into their bodies; barley and oats have about thirty per cent of it in their composition, and most woods and plants have more or less.\"  \"I am less surprised at that than I am with the flint, which appears almost incomprehensible.\"  \"Nothing is impossible with God; there is a rush in Holland which contains much more silex than the wheat-straw, and it is employed by the Dutch to polish wood and brass, on that very account.  We know but little yet, but we do know that mineral substances are found in the composition of most living animals, if not all; indeed, the colouring-matter of the blood is an oxide and phosphate of iron.\"  \"I can now understand why you are so enthusiastic in the science, Mr Swinton, and I regret much that the short time which will be occupied in the remainder of our voyage will not enable me to profit as I should wish by your conversation; for when we arrive at the Cape, I fear our pursuits will lead us different ways.\"  \"I presume they will, for I am about to penetrate as far as possible into the interior of the country,\" replied Mr Swinton, \"which of course is not your intention.\"  \"Indeed, but it is,\" replied Alexander; \"I am about to do the same, although perhaps not in the same direction.  May I ask your intended route, if not too inquisitive?\"  \"Not at all; I can hardly say myself.  I shall be guided by the protection I may fall in with.  Africa is a wide field for science, and I can hardly go anywhere without being well rewarded for my journey; and I will say, that should it meet both our views, I should be very glad if we were to travel in company.\"  Mr Fairburn, who had come on deck, had been standing close to them at the latter portion of the conversation, and made the observation--  \"I think it would be a very good plan if Mr Swinton would venture to go where you are bound, Mr Wilmot, but you can talk of that another day, when you have been longer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21555"],["title","The Mission; or Scenes in Africa (#5)"],["body","ther.  There is nothing that requires more deliberation than the choice of a travelling companion; any serious imperfection of temper may make a journey very miserable.  Now, Wilmot, if you are tired of natural history, and wish to change it for the painful history of human nature, I am ready to continue my observations.\"  \"With great pleasure, sir.\"  \"I hope you have no objection to my reaping the benefit also?\" said Mr Swinton.  \"Oh, most certainly not,\" replied Mr Fairburn, \"although I fear you will not gain much information, as you have been at the Cape before.  In a former conversation with Mr Wilmot I have pointed out the manner in which the Cape was first settled, and how the settlers had gradually reduced the original possessors of the land to a state of serfdom; I will now continue.  \"The Dutch boors, as they increased their wealth in cattle, required more pasture, and were now occupying the whole of the land south of the Caffre country: the Caffres are wild, courageous savages, whose wealth consists chiefly in cattle, but in some points they may be considered superior to the Hottentots.  \"The weapon of the Hottentot may be said to be the bow and arrow, but the Caffre scorns this warfare, or indeed any treachery; his weapons are his assaguay, or spear, and his shield; he fights openly and bravely. The Caffres also cultivate their land to a certain extent, and are more cleanly and civilised.  The boors on the Caffre frontier were often plundered by the bushmen, and perhaps occasionally by some few of the Caffres who were in a lawless state on the frontier; but if any complaint was made to the Caffre chiefs, every redress in their power was given: this, however, did not suit the Dutch boors.  \"They had entered the Caffre country, and had perceived that the Caffres possessed large herds of cattle, and their avarice pointed out to them how much easier it would be to grow rich by taking the cattle of the Caffres than by rearing them themselves.  If the bushmen stole a few head of cattle, complaints were immediately forwarded to Cape Town, and permission asked to raise a force, and recover them from the Caffres.  \"The force raised was termed a _Commando_, and was composed of all the Dutch boors and their servants, well-armed and mounted: these would make an incursion into the Caffre territory, and because a few head of cattle had been stolen by parties unknown, they would pour down upon the Caffres, who had but their assaguays to oppose to destructive fire-arms, set the kraals or villages in flames, murder indiscriminately man, woman, and child, and carry off, by way of indemnification for some trifling loss, perhaps some twenty thousand head of cattle belonging to the Caffres.  \"The Caffres, naturally indignant at such outrage and robbery, made attacks upon the boors to recover the cattle, but with this difference between the Christian boor and the untutored savage: the boors murdered women and children wantonly, the Caffres never harmed them, and did not even kill men, if they could obtain possession of their property without bloodshed.\"  \"But how could the Dutch government permit such atrocities?\"  \"The representations made to the government were believed, and the order was given in consequence.  It is true that afterwards the government attempted to put a stop to these horrors, but the boors were beyond their control; and in one instance in which the home government had insisted that punishment should be inflicted for some more than common outrage on the part of the boors, the Cape governor returned for answer, that he could not venture to do as they wished, as the system was so extensive and so common, that all the principal people in the colony were implicated, and would have to be punished.  \"Such was therefore the condition of the colony at the time that it fell into the possession of the English--the Hottentots serfs to the land, and treated as the beasts of the field; the slave-trader supplying slaves; and continual war carried on between the boors and the Caffres.\"  \"I trust that our government soon put an end to such barbarous iniquities.\"  \"That was not so easy; the frontier boors rose in arms against the English government, and the Hottentots, who had been so long patient, now fled and joined the Caffres.  These people made a combined attack upon the frontier boors, burnt their houses to the ground, carried off the cattle, and possessed themselves of their arms and ammunition.  The boors rallied in great force; another combat took place, in which the Hottentots and Caffres were victorious, killing the leader of the boors, and pursuing them with great slaughter, till they were stopped by the advance of the English troops.  But I cannot dwell long upon this period of the Cape history; these wars continued until the natives, throwing themselves upon the protection of the English, were induced to lay down their arms, and the Hottentots to return to their former masters.  The colony was then given up to the Dutch, and remained with them until the year 1806, when it was finally annexed to the British empire.  The Dutch had not learned wisdom from what had occurred; they treated the Hottentots worse than before, maiming them and even murdering them in their resentment, and appeared to defy the British government; but a change was soon to take place.\"  \"Not before it was necessary, at all events,\" said Alexander.  \"It was by the missionaries chiefly that this change was brought about; they had penetrated into the interior, and saw with their own eyes the system of cruelty and rapine that was carried on; they wrote home accounts, which were credited, and which produced a great alteration. To the astonishment and indignation of the boors, law was introduced where it had always been set at defiance; they were told that the life of a Hottentot was as important in the eye of God, and in the eye of the law, as that of a Dutch boor, and that the government would hold it as such.  Thus was the first blow struck; but another and a heavier was soon to fall upon those who had so long sported with the lives of their fellow-creatures.  The press was called to the aid of the Hottentot, and a work published by a missionary roused the attention of the public at home to their situation.  Their cause was pleaded in the House of Commons, and the Hottentot was emancipated for ever.\"  \"Thank God!\" exclaimed Alexander; \"my blood has been boiling at the description which you have been giving.  Now, when I hear that the poor Hottentot is a free man, it will cool down again.\"  \"Perhaps it will be as well to leave off just now, Mr Wilmot,\" said Mr Fairburn; \"we will renew our conversation to-morrow, if wind and weather permit, as the seamen say.\"    CHAPTER FIVE.  The next day the ship was off Rio, and immediately sent her boats for provisions and supplies; the passengers did not land, as the captain stated that he would not stay an hour longer than was necessary, and on the second evening after their arrival they again made sail for the Cape.  The gulls were flying in numbers astern of the ship, darting down and seizing everything edible which was thrown overboard, and the conversation turned upon aquatic birds.  \"What difference is there in the feathers of aquatic birds and others?\" inquired Alexander: \"a hen, or any land bird, if it falls into the water, is drowned as soon as its feathers are saturated with the water.\"  \"There is, I believe, no difference in the feathers of the birds,\" replied Mr Swinton; \"but all aquatic birds are provided with a small reservoir, containing oil, with which they anoint their feathers, which renders them water-proof.  If you will watch a duck pluming and dressing itself, you will find it continually turns its bill round to the end of its back, just above the insertion of the tail; it is to procure this oil, which, as it dresses its feathers that they may carefully overlap each other, it smears upon them so as to render them impenetrable to the water; but this requires frequent renewal, or the duck would be drowned as well as the hen.\"  \"How long can a sea-bird remain at sea?\"  \"I should think not very long, although it has been supposed otherwise; but we do not know so much of the habits of these birds as of others.\"  \"Can they remain long under water?\"  \"The greater portion of them cannot; ducks and that class, for instance. Divers can remain some time; but the birds that remain the longest under water are the semi-aquatic, whose feet are only half-webbed.  I have watched the common English water-hen for many minutes walking along at the bottom of a stream, apparently as much in its element as if on shore, pecking and feeding as it walked.\"  \"You say that aquatic birds cannot remain long at sea,--where do they go to?\"  \"They resort to the uninhabited islands over the globe, rocks that always remain above water, and the unfrequented shores of Africa and elsewhere; there they congregate to breed and bring up their young.  I have seen twenty or thirty acres of land completely covered with these birds or their nests, wedged together as close as they could sit.  Every year they resort to the same spot, which has probably been their domicile for centuries,--I might say since the creation.  They make no nests, but merely scrape so as to form a shallow hole to deposit their eggs.  The consequence of their always resorting to the same spot is that, from the voidings of the birds and the remains of fish brought to feed the young, a deposit is made over the whole surface, a fraction of an inch every year, which by degrees increases until it is sometimes twenty or thirty feet deep, if not more, and the lower portion becomes almost as hard as rock.  The deposit is termed guano, and has, from time immemorial, been used by the Peruvians and Chilians as manure for the land; it is very powerful, as it contains most of the essential salts, such as ammonia, phosphates, etcetera, which are required for"]]]
