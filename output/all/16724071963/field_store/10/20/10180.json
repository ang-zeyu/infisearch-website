It occurred to me that, in the art of war, an attacking party is supposed to have the advantage of one that is assaulted.  I therefore rose, brought my fork to the charge, and went at the bird with a furious roar.  It turned and ran a few yards, but stopped when I stopped, and began to return slowly, as before, the moment I had sat down.  As it drew nearer I observed that it eyed my colour-box curiously.  Stories about the peculiar taste of these giant birds recurred to me.  People say they will eat anything.  Their digestive powers have passed into a proverb.  The day before I had given an ostrich a large apple, which it coolly bolted, and I could trace the progress of the apple by the lump in its throat as it passed rather slowly down.  Some one--Bonny I rather think--had told me he had seen an ostrich accept and swallow a bottle of shoe-blacking!  Anything bright is sure to attract the eye of an ostrich and be coveted.  I trembled for my colour-box, and, seizing my fork, charged again.  About this time Bonny himself came to say that the cart was ready.  We therefore packed up and came away.  The ostriches, he said, were too young to think of molesting us, though he admitted that they would probably have swallowed the colour-box if I had allowed them.  They followed us down to the gate, and finally saw us safely off their premises.  \"Father once had an ostrich,\" said Bonny, as we walked towards the house, \"that caught a couple of thieves for him.\"  \"Indeed! how was that, Bonny?\"  \"You are aware that Kafirs are terrible thieves?\" he replied.  \"Yes, I've been given to understand that they have propensities that way.\"  \"Oh! but you have no idea how clever they are at it, and the Totties are just as bad, if not worse.  On one occasion we had a nest of eggs in the field over there, which we had left to be hatched in the natural way by the hen-ostrich.  One night it rained very hard--so hard that we feared the young ones would be drowned in the nest, so brother Johnny was sent to look after them.  He took two Totties with him.  It was very dark, but he found the nest with the cock bird sitting on it.  You know the cock always sits at night.  Well, Johnny took him by the nose and pulled him off the nest, and gave him to the two Totties to hold.  It was hard work, but they kept his head well down, so that he couldn't kick. Johnny soon bagged all the little ones, leaped over the wall, and then called out to let go the cock.  It was so dark that he couldn't see very well.  He could only hear a scuffle, and then saw the two men bounding over the wall like indiarubber balls while the cock went bang against it like a battering-ram.  We got the little ones home all safe, but, would you believe it? these rascally Totties had managed to pull out all the best wing-feathers while they were holding the cock--each feather worth, perhaps, twenty shillings or more--and got clear away with them to the canteen, where they can always sell stolen goods.  \"But that is not what I was going to tell you,\" continued Bonny.  \"It was about two Kafir thieves who were going round the country stealing. They came to our place one evening, and, in the course of their depredations, happened to cross one of the fields where a pair of our ostriches had a nest.  The cock had not yet commenced his night duty on the nest.  He caught sight of the two Kafirs, and was down on them instantly like lightning.  They took refuge in a mimosa-thorn, and there he kept them all night.  It was no use their trying to make a bolt for it, because twice or three times their speed could not have saved them from the ostrich.  There they remained, and there father found them next morning, when he rode out to feed the birds.\"  The sturdy sons of this Karroo farmer had no light duty to perform each day.  The farm was twenty miles in length, and of variable breadth. There were no crops raised on it, save the fruit of the splendid garden already mentioned, some grapes, and a few mealies.  The sources of gain were ostriches and their feathers, Angora goat hair, (mohair), horses, sheep-wool, and cattle, looking after which kept father and sons pretty constantly in the saddle.  It was a dashing style of life, requiring robust health and spirits.  I have seen one or both of the boys return of an evening--after having been up at five or six, and out all day,-- scarce able to decide whether to eat or sleep!  Counting and guarding the flocks formed a part of the duty.  One evening the report was brought that a horse and thirteen bucks had disappeared.  The Kafir thief had driven them off in the direction of Somerset.  There he had been questioned closely as to where he came from, etcetera.  His replies not being satisfactory, the animals were seized and put in the pound, whence they were afterwards reclaimed, while the thief escaped being put in the \"tronk,\" or jail, by a sudden dart into the jungle of the Boschberg!  My friend and I were soon on the road which led to the farm of his brother Jonathan.  It stood about two miles distant.  On our way we had to pass one corner of the private domain of Black Jack, or David Marais, I forget which--I think it was the former.  He was there ready for us, and evidently in a rage at the mere possibility of our intrusion, for the wings were going like flails and the tail was up.  Hobson pulled up to look at him for a minute.  I got down and went to the wall, knowing that it afforded perfect security.  Black Jack came up slowly, as if he meant no mischief.  I leant over the wall, which was breast-high, and poked fun at him.  In an instant, like a flash of light, he came at me. I saw his great claw over my head, and almost before I could jump back, a couple of heavy stones were driven violently off the top of the wall. To bolt and jump into the cart was almost an involuntary and instantaneous impulse on my part, though there was no need for haste, because the furious biped could not leap the wall.  \"Yes,\" remarked my friend, with a quiet chuckle, as we drove along; \"I expected as much.  Black Jack is in a bad humour to-day.\"  The farm of Jonathan lay at the side of the stream which watered that of his brother.  It was a pretty place.  We drove through the stream to get to the house.  On entering we found Jonathan standing in his hall, besprinkled with his own blood, and smiling.  He was one of those tall, thin, powerful sort of men, with genial good-humour wrinkling the corners of their eyes, who seem to be ready to smile at everything, pleasant or otherwise, that befalls them.  \"Hallo! what's wrong, Jonathan?\" asked his brother, with a touch of tenderness in his tone.  \"Nothing particular,\" replied the other; \"I've just had a tussle with one of my birds.  He wriggled out of the stick and kicked me.\"  On more particular inquiry we found that Jonathan and his son--another powerful six-footer--had gone that morning to search for eggs, which they felt sure must have been laid somewhere about the enclosed field. To keep the male bird in play while the search was being made, the father took his forked stick, met the cock in single combat, clapped the fork on his neck, and let him kick away.  All might have gone well, for the father, besides being strong, was accustomed to such work; but the bird, instead of keeping up a straightforward assault, as it ought to have done, turned its back to its foe, wriggled its neck, in some inexplicable manner, out of the fork, and before it could be refixed had given Jonathan several tremendous kicks.  One of these nearly tore his trousers to pieces, and another cut him across the right wrist into the bone.  This rendered his right arm powerless for the moment, and it might have gone ill with him, had not his son, who was still in sight, observed what had occurred, and run back to the rescue.  As it was, the father's wrist was severely, though I hope not permanently, damaged.  On a certain occasion three friends visited Ebenezer.  One of these--we shall call him Squib--was a sporting character, and anxious to have a shot at the guinea-fowl which abounded on the farm.  Hobson, with his usual kindness, readily agreed to pilot him and his friends.  \"The ground, however,\" said Hobson, \"is part of the domain which belongs to one of my ostriches, whose temper is uncertain.  I don't feel sure of him.  Perhaps it would be better--\"  \"Oh! never mind that,\" interrupted Squib; \"we're not afraid of ostriches.  Come along.\"  \"Very well,\" returned the host, \"come along.\"  And along they went to the domain of Gouws, who was found pacing solemnly inside the wall of his enclosure.  His wings were active, and his tail was cocked.  Otherwise he was calm enough to all appearance. Hobson knew that the bird was in a rage, and said so, but his friends, who were young and reckless, insisted on entering the enclosure.  They did so, and Gouws followed them with a stately air, but did not attack, being no doubt perplexed by numbers.  They walked in Indian file, Hobson being the last of the line.  \"I could turn him with a bit of a bush,\" said Squib, glancing at Gouws, who was drawing gradually nearer to the party.  \"Just cut one for me, Hobson, will you, like a good fellow?\"  Hobson turned aside and stooped to cut a branch from a mimosa bush.  Just then the ostrich, which had marched ahead of the party, turned sharp round and charged.  Poor Squib tripped, by good luck, and fell as the bird passed over him.  It kicked down the other two, and sprang on the shoulders of the stooping Hobson, who fell and gashed his finger as the bird tumbled over him.  The whole party rose with marvellous celerity, and the sportsmen rushed towards the boundary wall, while Gouws scrambled on his long legs and ran after them.  Had the distance been great, their chance of escape would have been small.  As it was, Gouws overtook one of the party just as he reached a part of the wall which had been mended with mimosa-thorn bushes.

A TALE OF MODERN WAR.  REVEALS THE EXPLOSIVE NATURE OF MY EARLY CAREER.  The remarkable--I might even say amazing--personal adventures which I am about to relate occurred quite recently.  They are so full of interest to myself and to my old mother, that I hasten to write them down while yet vivid and fresh in my memory, in the hope that they may prove interesting,--to say nothing of elevating and instructive--to the English-speaking portions of the human race throughout the world.  The dear old lady to whom I have just referred--my mother--is one of the gentlest, meekest, tenderest beings of my acquaintance.  Her regard for me is almost idolatrous.  My feelings towards her are tinged with adoration.  From my earliest years I have been addicted to analysis.  Some of my younger readers may not perhaps know that by analysis is meant the reduction of compound things to their elements--the turning of things, as it were, inside out and tearing them to pieces.  All the complex toys of infancy I was wont to reduce to their elements; I turned them inside out to see what they were made of, and how they worked.  A doll, not my own, but my sister Bella's, which had moveable eyelids and a musical stomach, was treated by me in this manner, the result being that I learned little, while my poor sister suffered much.  Everything in my father's house suffered more or less from this inquiring tendency of my mind.  Time, however, while it did not abate my thirst for knowledge, developed my constructive powers.  I became a mechanician and an inventor. Perpetual motion was my first hobby.  Six times during the course of boyhood did I burst into my mother's presence with the astounding news that I had \"discovered it at last!\"  The mild and trustful being believed me.  Six times also was I compelled to acknowledge to her that I had been mistaken, and again she believed me, more thoroughly, perhaps, than at first.  No one, I think, can form the least idea of the delight with which I pursued this mechanical will-o'-the-wisp.  Growing older, I took to chemistry, and here my love for research and analysis found ample scope, while the sufferings of my father's household were intensified.  I am not naturally cruel--far from it. They little knew how much pain their sufferings caused me; how earnestly I endeavoured to lessen or neutralise the nuisances which the pursuit of science entailed.  But I could not consume my own smoke, or prevent explosions, or convert bad and suffocating odours into sweet smells.  Settling down to this new pursuit with intense enthusiasm, I soon began to flow in my natural course, and sought to extend the bounds of chemical knowledge.  I could not help it.  The particular direction in which my interest ultimately became concentrated was that of explosives.  After becoming acquainted with gun-cotton, nitro-glycerine, dynamite, lithofracteur, and other combinations of powerfully-explosive agents, I took to searching for and inventing methods by which these might be utilised.  To turn everything to good account, is a desire which I cannot resist.  Explosives naturally drew my attention to mines--tin-mines, coal-mines, and other commercial enterprises.  They also suggested war and torpedoes.  At that time I had not reflected on the nature of war.  I merely knew it to be a science, cultivated chiefly by the human race, and that in its practice explosives are largely used.  To \"blow-up\" effectively, whether in a literal or figurative sense, is difficult.  To improve this power in war, and in the literal sense, I set myself to work.  I invented a torpedo, which seemed to me better than any that had yet been brought out.  To test its powers, I made a miniature fortification, and blew it up.  I also blew up our groom, Jacob Lancey.  It happened thus:--  The miniature fortress, which was made of cardboard, earth, and bricks, was erected in a yard near our stables.  Under its walls the torpedo was placed, and the match lighted.  It was night and very dark.  I had selected the hour as being that most suitable to the destruction of an enemy's stronghold.  The match was very slow in burning.  Matches invariably are so in the circumstances. Suddenly I heard the sound of footsteps.  Next moment, before I had time to give warning, Jacob Lancey came round the corner of the stables with a pitchfork on his shoulder, and walked right into the fortress.  He set his foot on the principal gateway, tripped over the ramparts, and falling headlong into the citadel, laid its banner in the dust.  At the same instant there came a terrific flash and crash, and from the midst of smoke and flames, the groom appeared to shoot into the air!  With feelings of horror I sprang to the rescue and dragged the poor fellow from the smoking debris.  He was stunned at first, but soon recovered, and then it was found that one of the fingers of his left hand had been completely blown off.  Words cannot describe my feelings. I felt as if I had become next thing to a murderer.  Lancey was a tall powerful man of about thirty, and not easily killed.  He had received no other injury worth mentioning.  Although the most faithful of servants, he was irascible, and I anticipated an explosion of temper when he recovered sufficiently to understand the nature of his injury, but I was mistaken.  The blowing-up seemed to have quite cured his temper--at least as regarded myself, for when I afterwards went to see him, with a very penitent face, he took my hand and said--  \"Don't take on so, Master Jeffry.  You didn't do it a purpus, you know, and, after all, it's on'y the little finger o' the left hand.  It'll be rather hout o' the way than otherwise.  Moreover, I was used to make a baccy stopper o' that finger, an' it strikes me that the stump'll fit the pipe better than the pint did, besides bein' less sensitive to fire, who knows?  Any'ow, Master Jeffry, you've got no occasion to grieve over it so.\"  I felt a little comforted when the good fellow spoke thus, but I could not forgive myself.  For some time after that I quite gave up my chemical and other experiments, and when I did ultimately resume them, I went to work with extreme caution.  Not long after this event I went to college, and studied medicine.  My course was nearly completed when my dear father died.  He had earnestly desired that I should enter the medical profession.  I therefore resolved to finish my course, although, being left in possession of a small estate named Fagend, in Devonshire, and an ample income, it was not requisite that I should practise for a livelihood.  One morning, a considerable time after my studies were completed, I sat at breakfast with my mother.  \"Jeff,\" she said (my name is Jeffry Childers); \"Jeff, what do you think of doing now?  Being twenty-four, you ought, you know, to have some fixed idea as to the future, for, of course, though independent, you don't intend to be idle.\"  \"Right, mother, right,\" I replied, \"I don't mean to be an idler, nevertheless I don't mean to be a doctor.  I shall turn my mind to chemistry, and talking of that, I expect to test the powers of a particular compound today.\"  \"And what,\" said my mother, with a peculiar smile, \"is the nature of this compound?\"  \"Violently explosive,\" said I.  \"Ah, of course, I might have guessed that, Jeff, for most of your compounds are either violently explosive or offensive--sometimes both; but what is the name of this one?\"  \"Before answering that,\" said I, pulling out my watch, \"allow me to ask at what hour you expect Bella home to-day.\"  \"She half promised to be over to breakfast, if cousin Kate would let her away.  It is probable that she may arrive in less than an hour.\"  \"Curious coincidence,\" said I, \"that her lover is likely to arrive about the same time!\"  \"What!  Nicholas Naranovitsch?\"  \"Yes.  The ship in which he sailed from St. Petersburg arrived late last night, and I have just received a telegram, saying that he will be down by the first train this morning.  Love, you know, is said to have wings. If the pair given to Naranovitsch are at all in keeping with his powerful frame, they will bear him swiftly to Fagend.\"  It may interest the reader at this point to know that my only sister, Bella, had been engaged the previous year to one of my dearest college friends, a young Russian, whose father had sent him to finish his education in England.  My own father, having been a merchant, many of whose dealings were with Russia, had frequently visited St. Petersburg and twice my mother and sister and I accompanied him thither.  While there we had met with the Naranovitsch family.  Young Nicholas was now in the army, and as fine-looking a fellow as one could wish to see.  Not only was he strong and manly, but gentle in manner and tender of heart.  My sister Bella being the sweetest--no, not quite that, for there _is_ a pretty young--well, no matter--Bella being, as I may say, _one_ of the sweetest girls in England, he fell in love with her, of course.  So did she with him; no wonder!  During a visit to our place in Devonshire at the end of his college career, he and Bella became engaged.  Nicholas returned to St. Petersburg to obtain his parents' consent to the union, and to make arrangements.  He was rich, and could afford to marry.  At the time I write of, he was coming back, not to claim his bride, for his father thought him still too young, but to see her, and to pay us a visit.  \"Now you know, mother,\" said I, \"after the young people have seen each other for half-an-hour or so, they will naturally want to take a walk or a ride, and--\"  \"Only half-an-hour?\" interrupted my mother, with one of her peculiar little smiles.  \"Well, an hour if you like, or two if they prefer it,\" I returned; \"at all events, they will want a walk before luncheon, and I shall take the opportunity to show them some experiments, which prove the power of the singular compound"]]]
