CHAPTER TWO.  The house on fire was, as we have said, an elegant mansion--one of those imposing edifices, with fresh paint outside, and splendid furniture within, which impress the beholder with the idea of a family in luxurious circumstances.  No one could tell how the fire originated.  In the daily \"report\" of fires, made next day by the chief of the Red Brigade, wherein nine fires were set down as having occurred within the twenty-four hours, the cause of this fire in Ladbroke Square was reported \"unknown.\"  Of the other eight, the supposed causes were, in one case, \"escape of gas,\" in another, \"paraffin-lamp upset,\" in another \"intoxication,\" in another, \"spark from fire,\" in another, \"candle,\" in another, \"children playing with matches,\" and so on; but in this mansion none of these causes were deemed probable.  The master of the house turned off the gas regularly every night before going to bed, therefore it could not have been caused by escape of gas.  Paraffin-lamps were not used in the house.  Candles were; but they were always carefully handled and guarded.  As to intoxication, the most suspicious of mortals could not have dreamed of such a cause in so highly respectable a family.  The fires were invariably put out at night, and guards put on in every room, therefore, no spark could have been so audacious as to have leaped into being and on to the floor.  There were, indeed, \"matches\" in the house, but there were no children, except one old lady, who, having reached her second childhood, might perhaps have been regarded as a child.  It is true there was a certain Betty, a housemaid, whose fingers were reported by the cook to be \"all thumbs,\" and who had an awkward and incurable tendency to spill, and break, and drop, and fall over things, on whom suspicion fastened very keenly at first; but Betty, who was young and rather pretty, asserted so earnestly that she had been unusually happy that night in having done nothing whatever of a condemnable nature, and backed her asseverations with such floods of tears, that she was exonerated, and, as we have said, the cause was reported \"unknown.\"  It was not, however, so completely unknown as was at first supposed. There was a certain grave, retiring, modest individual who knew the gentleman of the house and his doings a little more thoroughly than was agreeable to the said gentleman, and who had become aware, in some unaccountable way, which it is impossible to explain, that he, the said gentleman, had very recently furnished the house in a sumptuous style, and had insured it much beyond its value.  The said individual's knowledge ultimately resulted in the said gentleman being convicted and transported for arson!  But with all this we have nothing to do.  Whatever the uncertainty that afterwards arose as to the cause of the fire, there could be no uncertainty as to the fire itself at the time.  It blazed and roared so furiously, that the inside of the house resembled a white-hot furnace. Flames spouted from the windows and chimneys, glaring fiercely on the spectators, who assembled rapidly from all quarters, as if defying them all, and daring the firemen to do their worst.  Sparks enough to have shamed all the Roman candles ever made in or out of Rome were vomited forth continuously, and whirled away with volumes of dense black smoke into the wintry sky.  \"It's well alight,\" observed a chimney-sweep to a policeman.  The policeman made no reply, although it did seem as if it would have been quite safe, even for a policeman, to admit that the sweep was thoroughly correct.  It _was_ \"well alight,\" so well, that it seemed absolutely ridiculous to suppose that the firemen could make any impression on it at all.  But the firemen did not appear to think the attempt ridiculous.  \"Never give in\" was, or might have been, their motto.  It was their maxim to attack the enemy with promptitude and vigour, no matter what his strength might be.  When he crept out like a sneaking burglar from under a hearth-stone, or through an over-heated flue, they would \"have at him\" with the hand-pumps and quench him at once.  When he came forth like a dashing party of skirmishers, to devastate a wood-yard, or light up a music-hall with unusual brilliancy, they sent an engine or two against him without delay, and put him down in an hour or two.  When he attacked \"in force,\" they despatched engine after engine--manuals and steamers-- to the front, until he was quelled, and if the prey already seized could not be wrenched from his grasp, they, at all events, killed him before he could destroy more.  When he boldly and openly declared war, attacking the great combustible warehouses of Tooley Street, threatening a descent on the shipping, and almost setting the Thames on fire, they sent out the whole available army from every quarter of the metropolis with all their engines of war--manuals, steamers, and floating batteries, or spouteries, and fought him tooth and nail, till he gave in.  They might be terribly over-matched--as in the case of the great fire when the gallant Braidwood fell--they might lose men, and might have to fight day and night for weeks, but they would \"never say die,\" until the enemy had died and left them, tired and torn, but still tough and triumphant victors on the field of battle.  Before the engine from Regent Street came on the ground, two manual engines from Kensington and Notting Hill had arrived, and opened water on the foe.  At first their shot fell harmlessly on the roaring furnace; but by the time the \"steamer\" had got ready for action, some little effect was beginning to be produced.  When this great gun, so to speak, began to play, and sent a thick continuous stream through the windows, like an inexhaustible water mitrailleuse, clouds of white steam mingled with the black smoke, and varied the aspect of the fire, but did not appear to lessen its fury in any degree.  Just then another manual engine dashed into the square at full gallop, and formed up.  Before it had well taken a position, another \"steamer,\" with three horses, came swinging round the corner, and fell into the ranks.  The panting steeds were unharnessed, the bold charioteers leaped down, the suction-pipe was dipped into the water-trough, and the hose attached.  As two engines cannot \"drink\" at the same plug, a canvas trough with an iron frame is put over the plug, having a hole in its bottom, which fits tightly round the plug.  It quietly fills, and thus two or more engines may do their work convivially--dip in their suction-pipes, and \"drink\" simultaneously at the same fountain.  \"Down with her!\" shouted the man who held the \"branch,\" or nozzle, at the end of the hose.  A steam whistle gives a shrill, short reply; the engine quivers under the power of man's greatest servant, and another battery opens on the foe.  But London firemen are not content to play at long bowls.  While the artillery goes thus vigorously into action, the helmets of the men are seen gleaming and glancing everywhere amid the smoke, searching for weak points, turning the enemy's flanks, and taking him in rear.  Hose are dragged through neighbouring houses, trailing their black coils like horrid water snakes, through places were such things were never meant to be.  If too short, additional lengths are added, again and again, till the men who hold the branches gain points of vantage on adjoining roofs or outhouses, until, at last from below, above, in front, and behind, cataracts of water dash into the glowing furnace.  The fire-escape had been first to reach the ground after the alarm was given, this being the instrument nearest to the scene of conflagration. It happened that night to be in charge of David Clazie, a brother of Comrade Bob.  Being a smart young fellow, David, had--with the assistance of two early risers who chanced to be at hand, and the policeman on the beat--run up his escape, and put it in position before the fire had gained its full force.  The gentleman of the house had already got out, and fled in his night garments; but the fire had rendered the staircase impassable, so that the cook, the many-thumbed Betty, and the old lady, who was the gentleman's mother, were imprisoned in the upper floor.  David Clazie did not learn this from the gentleman, however.  That amiable character had received such a fright, that he had taken himself off, no one--except the individual aforementioned--knew whither. Fortunately, Betty announced the fact of her existence by rushing to a window and shrieking.  David ran his escape towards the window, mounted the ladder, carried the damsel down, bore her, kicking, into a neighbouring house, and left her in fits.  Meanwhile the cook rushed to the same window, shrieked, and fell back half-suffocated with the smoke which just then surrounded her.  A policeman gallantly ran up the escape, jumped into the room, gathered up the cook with great difficulty--for she was unusually fat and the smoke very suffocating-- carried her down, bore her to the same house where Betty lay, and left her there in violent hysterics.  As neither of them could answer questions, it could not be ascertained whether there were any more people in the burning house.  David therefore explored it as far as was possible in the circumstances, and much more than was safe for himself, but found no one.  After nearly choking himself, therefore, he drew aside the escape to prevent its being burned.  When the engines came up, however, it was again brought into play, to enable the firemen to get up with their \"branches\" to the upper windows.  \"Try that window, Dashwood,\" said the officer of the station to which Joe belonged, pointing to a window on the second floor.  \"There ain't much smoke coming out.\"  Before he had done speaking, Joe and a comrade had pushed the escape towards the window in question.  He ascended and leaped"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21695"],["title","Life in the Red Brigade: London Fire Brigade (#3)"],["body","the room, but could scarcely see for the smoke.  Knowing that the air in a burning house is clearer near the floor, he stooped as low as possible, and went round the room guiding himself by the walls.  Coming to a door he seized the handle and tried to open it, but found it locked, and the handle so hot that he was forced to let go abruptly.  He seized a chair, tried to burst it open with a blow, and shivered the chair to atoms, but did not force the door.  A powerful effort with his foot also failed.  Rushing to the window he got out on the escape, and shouted:--  \"The axe, lads, look sharp and pass up the hose.  We'll get at it here.\"  A large heavy axe was handed up by one fireman, while another let down a rope, to which the end of the hose was attached and hauled up.  Joe seized the axe, returned to the door, and, with one blow, dashed it open.  Flames leaped upon him, as if they had been eagerly awaiting the opportunity, licked hungrily round his legs, and kissed his whiskers--of which, by the way, he was rather proud; and with good reason, for they were very handsome whiskers.  But Joe cared no more for them at that moment than he did for his boots.  He was forced to retreat, however, to the window, where Bob Clazie had already presented his branch and commenced a telling discharge on the fire.  \"That's the way to do it,\" muttered Bob, as he directed the branch and turned aside his head to avoid, as much as possible, the full volume of the smoke.  \"Let's get a breath o' fresh air,\" gasped Joe Dashwood, endeavouring to squeeze past his comrade through the window.  At that moment a faint cry was heard.  It appeared to come from an inner room.  \"Some one there, Joe,\" said Bob Clazie in a grave tone, but without diverting his attention for an instant, from the duty in which he was engaged.  Joe made no reply, but at once leaped back into the room, and, a second time, felt his way round the walls.  He came on another door.  One blow of the ponderous axe dashed it in, and revealed a bed-room not quite so densely filled with smoke as the outer room.  Observing a bed looming through the smoke, he ran towards it, and struck his head against one of the posts so violently that he staggered.  Recovering he made a grasp at the clothes, and felt that there was a human being wrapped tightly up in them like a bundle.  A female shriek followed.  Joe Dashwood was not the man to stand on ceremony in such circumstances.  He seized the bundle, straightened it out a little, so as to make it more portable, and throwing it over his shoulder, made a rush towards the window by which he had entered.  All this the young fireman did with considerable energy and haste, because the density of the smoke was increasing, and his retreat might be cut off by the flames at any moment.  \"Clear the way there!\" he gasped, on reaching the window.  \"All right,\" replied Bob Clazie, who was still presenting his branch with untiring energy at the flames.  Joe passed out, got on the head of the escape, and, holding the bundle on his shoulder with one hand, grasped the rounds of the ladder with the other.  He descended amid the cheers of the vast multitude, which had by this time assembled to witness the fire.  As Joe hurried towards the open door of the nearest house, Betty, with the thumbs, rushed frantically out, screaming, \"Missis! oh! my! she'll be burnt alive! gracious! help! fire! back room! first floor! oh, my!\"  \"Be easy, lass,\" cried Joe, catching the flying domestic firmly by the arm, and detaining her despite her struggles.  \"Let me go; missis!  I forgot her!\"  \"Here she is,\" cried Joe, interrupting, \"all safe.  You come and attend to her.\"  The reaction on poor Betty's feelings was so great that she went into fits a second time, and was carried with her mistress into the house, where the cook still lay in violent hysterics.  Joe laid the bundle gently on the bed, and looked quickly at the bystanders.  Observing several cool and collected females among them, he pointed to the bundle, which had begun to exhibit symptoms of life, and said briefly, \"She's all right, look after her,\" and vanished like a wreath of that smoke into which in another moment he plunged.  He was not a moment too soon, for he found Bob Clazie, despite his fortitude and resolution, on the point of abandoning the window, where the smoke had increased to such a degree as to render suffocation imminent.  \"Can't stand it,\" gasped Bob, scrambling a few paces down the ladder.  \"Give us the branch, Bob, I saw where it was in fetchin' out the old woman,\" said Joe in a stifled voice.  He grasped the copper tube from which the water spouted with such force as to cause it to quiver and recoil like a living thing, so that, being difficult to hold, it slipped aside and nearly fell.  The misdirected water-spout went straight at the helmet of a policeman, which it knocked off with the apparent force of a cannon shot; plunged into the bosom of a stout collier, whom it washed whiter than he had ever been since the days of infancy, and scattered the multitude like chaff before the wind. Seeing this, the foreman ordered \"Number 3\" engine, (which supplied the particular branch in question), to cease pumping.  Joe recovered the erratic branch in a moment, and dragged it up the escape, Bob, who was now in a breatheable atmosphere, helping to pass up the hose.  The foreman, who seemed to have acquired the power of being in several places at one and the same moment of time, and whose watchful eye was apparently everywhere, ordered Bob's brother David and another man named Ned Crashington, to go up and look after Joe Dashwood.  Meanwhile Joe shouted, \"Down with Number 3;\" by which he meant, \"up with as much water as possible from Number 3, and as fast as you can!\" and sprang into the room from which he had just rescued the old woman.  In passing out with her he had observed a glimmer of flame through the door which he had first broken open, and which, he reflected while descending the escape, was just out of range of Bob Clazie's branch.  It was the thought of this that had induced him to hurry back so promptly; in time, as we have seen, to relieve his comrade.  He now pointed the branch at the precise spot, and hit that part of the fire right in its heart.  The result was that clouds of steam mingled with the smoke.  But Joe was human after all.  The atmosphere, or, rather, the want of atmosphere, was too much for him.  He was on the point of dropping the branch, and rushing to the window for his life, when Ned Crashington, feeling his way into the room, tumbled over him.  Speech was not required in the circumstances.  Ned knew exactly what to do, and Joe knew that he had been sent to relieve him.  He therefore delivered the branch to Ned, and at once sprang out on the escape, where he encountered David Clazie.  \"Go in, Davy, he can't stand it long,\" gasped Joe.  \"No fears of 'im,\" replied Davy, with a smile, as he prepared to enter the window; \"Ned can stand hanythink a'most.  But, I say, send up some more 'ands.  It takes two on us to 'old _that_ 'ere branch, you know.\"  The brass helmets of more hands coming up the escape were observed as he spoke, for the foreman saw that this was a point of danger, and, like a wise general, had his reserves up in time.  David Clazie found Ned standing manfully to the branch.  Ned was noted in the Red Brigade as a man who could \"stand a'most anything,\" and who appeared to cherish a martyr-like desire to die by roasting or suffocation.  This was the more surprising that he was not a boastful or excitable fellow, but a silent, melancholy, and stern man, who, except when in action, usually seemed to wish to avoid observation.  Most of his comrades were puzzled by this compound of character, but some of them hinted that Crashington's wife could have thrown some light on the subject.  Be this as it may, whenever the chief or the foreman of the Brigade wanted a man for any desperate work, they invariably turned to Ned Crashington.  Not that Ned was one whit more courageous or willing to risk his life than any of the other men, _all_ of whom, it must be remembered, were picked for courage and capacity for their special work; but he combined the greatest amount of coolness with the utmost possible recklessness, besides being unusually powerful, so that he could be depended on for wise as well as desperate action.  Joe Dashwood was thought to be almost equal to Ned--indeed, in personal activity he was superior; but there was nothing desperate in Joe's character.  He was ever ready to dare anything with a sort of jovial alacrity, but he did not appear, like Ned, to court martyrdom.  While Ned and David subdued the flames above, Joe descended the escape, and being by that time almost exhausted, sat down to rest with several comrades who had endured the first shock of battle, while fresh men were sent to continue the fight.  \"Have a glass, Joe?\" said one of the firemen, coming round with a bottle of brandy.  \"No, thank 'ee,\" said Joe, \"I don't require it.\"  \"Hand it here,\" said a man who stood leaning against the rails beside him, \"my constitution is good, like the British one, but it's none the worse for a drop o' brandy after such tough work.\"  There was probably truth in what the man said.  Desperate work sometimes necessitates a stimulant; nevertheless, there were men in the Red Brigade who did their desperate work on nothing stronger than water, and Joe was one of these.  In three hours the fire was subdued, and before noon of that day it was extinguished.  The \"report\" of it, as published by the chief of the Fire-Brigade next morning, recorded that a house in Ladbroke Square, occupied by Mr Blank, a gentleman whose business was \"private\"--in other words, unknown--had been set on fire by some \"unknown cause,\" that the whole tenement had been \"burnt out\" and \"the roof off,\" and that the contents of the building were \"insured in the Phoenix.\"  Some of the"]]]
