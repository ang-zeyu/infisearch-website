Won't you shake hands?\"  Bob was silent.  \"Come, some, Bob!\" cried several of the bigger boys, \"don't be sulky, man; shake hands and be friends.  Martin has licked you this time, and you'll lick him next time, no doubt, and that's all about it.\"  \"Arrah, then, ye're out there, intirely.  Bob Croaker'll niver lick Martin Rattler though he wos to live to the age of the great M'Thuselah!\" said a deep-toned voice close to the spot where the fight had taken place.  All eyes were instantly turned in the direction whence it proceeded, and the boys now became aware, for the first time, that the combat had been witnessed by a sailor, who, with a smile of approval beaming on his good-humoured countenance, sat under the shade of a neighbouring tree smoking a pipe of that excessive shortness and blackness that seems to be peculiarly beloved by Irishmen in the humbler ranks of life.  The man was very, tall and broad-shouldered, and carried himself with a free-and-easy swagger, as he rose and approached the group of boys.  \"He'll niver bate ye, Martin, avic, as long as there's two timbers of ye houldin' togither.\"  The seaman patted Martin on the head as he spoke; and, turning to Bob Croaker, continued:  \"Ye ought to be proud, ye spalpeen, o' bein' wopped by sich a young hero as this.  Come here and shake hands with him: d'ye hear?  Troth an' it's besmearin' ye with too much honour that same.  There, that'll do.  Don't say ye're sorry now, for it's lies ye'd be tellin' if ye did.  Come along, Martin, an I'll convarse with ye as ye go home.  Ye'll be a man yet, as sure as my name is Barney O'Flannagan.\"  Martin took the white kitten in his arms and thrust its wet little body into his equally wet bosom, where the warmth began soon to exercise a soothing influence on the kitten's depressed spirits, so that, ere long, it began to purr.  He then walked with the sailor towards the village, with his face black and blue, and swelled, and covered with blood, while Bob Croaker and his companions returned to the school.  The distance to Martin's residence was not great, but it was sufficient to enable the voluble Irishman to recount a series of the most wonderful adventures and stories of foreign lands; that set Martin's heart on fire with desire to go to sea; a desire which was by no means new to him, and which recurred violently every time he paid a visit to the small sea-port of Bilton, which lay about five miles to the southward of his native village.  Moreover, Barney suggested that it was time Martin should be doing for himself (he was now ten years old), and said that if he would join his ship, he could get him a berth, for he was much in want of an active lad to help him with the coppers.  But Martin Rattler sighed deeply, and said that, although his heart was set upon going to sea, he did not see how it was to be managed, for his aunt would not let him go.  Before they separated, however, it was arranged that Martin should pay the sailor's ship a visit, when he would hear a good deal more about foreign lands; and that, in the meantime, he should make another attempt to induce Aunt Dorothy Grumbit to give her consent to his going to sea.    CHAPTER FOUR.  A LESSON TO ALL STOCKING-KNITTERS--MARTIN'S PROSPECTS BEGIN TO OPEN UP.  In the small sea-port of Bilton, before mentioned, there dwelt an old and wealthy merchant and ship-owner, who devoted a small portion of his time to business, and a very large portion of it to what is usually termed \"doing good.\"  This old gentleman was short, and stout, and rosy, and bald, and active, and sharp as a needle.  In the short time that Mr Arthur Jollyboy devoted to business, he accomplished as much as most men do in the course of a long day.  There was not a benevolent society in the town, of which Arthur Jollyboy, Esquire, of the Old Hulk (as he styled his cottage), was not a member, director, secretary, and treasurer, all in one, and all at once!  If it had been possible for man be ubiquitous, Mr Jollyboy would have been so naturally; or, if not naturally, he would have made himself so by force of will.  Yet he made no talk about it.  His step was quiet, though quick; and his voice was gentle, though rapid; and he was chiefly famous for _talking_ little and _doing_ much.  Some time after the opening of our tale, Mr Jollyboy had received information of Mrs Grumbit's stocking movement.  That same afternoon he put on his broad-brimmed white hat and, walking out to the village in which she lived, called upon the vicar, who was a particular and intimate friend of his.  Having ascertained from the vicar that Mrs Grumbit would not accept of charity, he said abruptly,--\"And why not--is she too proud?\"  \"By no means,\" replied the vicar.  \"She says that she would think shame to take money from friends as long as she can work, because every penny that she would thus get would be so much less to go to the helpless poor; of whom, she says, with much truth, there are enough and to spare. And I quite agree with her as regards her principle; but it does not apply fully to her, for she cannot work so as to procure a sufficient livelihood without injury to her health.\"  \"Is she clever?\" inquired Mr Jollyboy.  \"Why, no, not particularly.  In fact, she does not often exert her reasoning faculties, except in the common-place matters of ordinary and every-day routine.\"  \"Then she's cleverer than most people,\" said Mr Jollyboy, shortly.  \"Is she obstinate?\"  \"No, not in the least,\" returned the vicar with a puzzled smile.  \"Ah, well, good-bye, good-bye; that's all I want to know.\"  Mr Jollyboy rose, and, hurrying through the village, tapped at the cottage door, and was soon closeted with Mrs Dorothy Grumbit.  In the course of half an hour, Mr Jollyboy drew from Mrs Grumbit as much about her private affairs as he could, without appearing rude.  But he found the old lady very close and sensitive on that point.  Not so, however, when he got her upon the subject of her nephew.  She had enough, and more than enough, to say about him.  It is true she began by remarking, sadly, that he was a very bad boy; but, as she continued to talk about him, she somehow or other gave her visitor the impression that he was a very _good_ boy!  They had a wonderfully long and confidential talk about Martin, during which Mr Jollyboy struck Mrs Grumbit nearly dumb with horror by stating positively what he would do for the boy,--he would send him to sea!  Then, seeing that he had hit the wrongest possible nail on the head, he said that he would make the lad a clerk in his office, where he would be sure to rise to a place of trust; whereat Mrs Grumbit danced, if we may so speak, into herself for joy.  \"And now, ma'am, about these stockings.  I want two thousand pairs as soon as I can get them!\"  \"Sir?\" said Mrs Grumbit.  \"Of course, not for my own use, ma'am; nor for the use of my family, for I have no family; and if I had, that would be an unnecessarily large supply.  The fact is, Mrs Grumbit, I am a merchant and I send very large supplies of home-made articles to foreign lands, and two thousand pairs of socks are a mere driblet.  Of course I do not expect you to make them all for me, but I wish you to make as many pairs as you can.\"  \"I shall be very happy--\" began Mrs Grumbit.  \"But, Mrs Grumbit, there is a peculiar formation which I require in my socks that will give you extra trouble, I fear; but I must have it, whatever the additional expense may be.  What is your charge for the pair you are now making?\"  \"Three shillings,\" said Mrs Grumbit.  \"Ah! very good.  Now, take up the wires if you please, ma'am, and do what I tell you.  Now, drop that stitch,--good; and take up this one,-- capital; and pull this one across that way,--so; and that one across this way,--exactly.  Now, what is the result?\"  The result was a complicated knot; and Mrs Grumbit, after staring a few seconds at the old gentleman in surprise, said so, and begged to know what use it was of.  \"Oh, never mind, never mind.  We merchants have strange fancies, and foreigners have curious tastes now and then.  Please to make all my socks with a hitch like that in them all round, just above the ankle. It will form an ornamental ring.  I'm sorry to put you to the trouble, but of course I pay extra for fancy-work.  Will six shillings a-pair do for these?\"  \"My dear sir,\" said Mrs Grumbit, \"it is no additional--\"  \"Well, well, never mind,\" said Mr Jollyboy.  \"Two thousand pairs, remember, as soon as possible,--close knitted, plain stitch, rather coarse worsted; and don't forget the hitch, Mrs Grumbit, don't forget the hitch.\"  Ah! reader, there are many Mrs Grumbits in this world, requiring _hitches_ to be made in their stockings!  At this moment the door burst open.  Mrs Dorothy Grumbit uttered a piercing scream, Mr Jollyboy dropped his spectacles and sat down on his hat and Martin Rattler stood before them with the white kitten in his arms.  For a few seconds there was a dead silence, while an expression of puzzled disappointment passed over Mr Jollyboy's ruddy countenance.  At last he said--  \"Is this, madam, the nephew who, you told me a little ago, is not addicted to fighting?\"  \"Yes,\" answered the old lady faintly, and covering her eyes with her hands, \"that is Martin.\"  \"If my aunt told you that, sir, she told you the truth,\" said Martin, setting down the blood-stained white kitten, which forthwith began to stretch its limbs and lick itself dry.  \"I don't ever fight if I can help it but I couldn't help it to-day.\"  With a great deal of energy, and a revival of much of his former indignation, when he spoke of the kitten's sufferings, Martin recounted all the circumstances of the fight; during the recital of which Mrs Dorothy Grumbit took his hand in hers and patted it, gazing the while into his swelled visage, and weeping plentifully, but very silently. When he had"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21750"],["title","Martin Rattler (#3)"],["body","ed, Mr Jollyboy shook hands with him, and said he was a trump, at the same time recommending him to go and wash his face. Then he whispered a few words in Mrs Grumbit's ear, which seemed to give that excellent lady much pleasure; after which he endeavoured to straighten his crushed hat; in which attempt he failed, took his leave, promised to call again very soon, and went back to the Old Hulk-- chuckling.    CHAPTER FIVE.  MARTIN, BEING WILLING TO GO TO SEA, GOES TO SEA AGAINST HIS WILL.  Four years rolled away, casting chequered light and shadow over the little village of Ashford in their silent passage,--whitening the forelocks of the aged, and strengthening the muscles of the young. Death, too, touched a hearth here and there, and carried desolation to a home; for four years cannot wing their flight without enforcing on us the lesson--which we are so often taught and yet take so long to learn-- that this is not our rest,--that here we have no abiding city.  Did we but ponder this lesson more frequently and earnestly, instead of making us sad, it would nerve our hearts and hands to fight and work more diligently,--to work in the cause of our Redeemer,--the only cause that is worth the life-long energy of immortal beings,--the great cause that includes all others; and it would teach us to remember that our little day of opportunity will soon be spent and that the night is at hand in which no man can work.  Four years rolled away, and during this time Martin, having failed to obtain his aunt's consent to his going to sea, continued at school, doing his best to curb the roving spirit that strove within him.  Martin was not particularly bright at the dead languages; to the rules of grammar he entertained a rooted aversion; and at history he was inclined to yawn, except when it happened to touch upon the names and deeds of such men as Vasco di Gama and Columbus.  But in geography he was perfect; and in arithmetic and book-keeping he was quite a proficient, to the delight of Mrs Dorothy Grumbit whose household books he summed up; and to the satisfaction of his fast friend, Mr Arthur Jollyboy, whose ledgers he was--in that old gentleman's secret resolves--destined to keep.  Martin was now fourteen, broad and strong, and tall for his age.  He was the idol of the school,--dashing, daring, reckless, and good-natured. There was almost nothing that he would not attempt and there were very few things that he could not do.  He never fought however--from principle; and his strength and size often saved him from the necessity. But he often prevented other boys from fighting, except when he thought there was good reason for it; then he stood by and saw fair-play.  There was a strange mixture of philosophical gravity, too, in Martin.  As he grew older he became more enthusiastic and less boisterous.  Bob Croaker was still at the school, and was, from prudential motives, a fast friend of Martin.  But he bore him a secret grudge, for he could not forget the great fight.  One day Bob took Martin by the arm, and said, \"I say, Rattler, come with me to Bilton, and have some fun among the shipping.\"  \"Well, I don't mind if I do,\" said Martin.  \"I'm just in the mood for a ramble, and I'm not expected home till bed-time.\"  In little more than an hour the two boys were wandering about the dock-yards of the sea-port town, and deeply engaged in examining the complicated rigging of the ships.  While thus occupied, the clanking of a windlass and the merry, \"Yo heave O! and away she goes,\" of the sailors, attracted their attention.  \"Hallo! there goes the Firefly, bound for the South Seas,\" cried Bob Croaker; \"come, let's see her start.  I say, Martin, isn't your friend, Barney O'Flannagan, on board?\"  \"Yes, he is.  He tries to get me to go out every voyage, and I wish I could.  Come quickly; I want to say good-bye to him before he starts.\"  \"Why don't you run away, Rattler?\" inquired Bob, as they hurried round the docks to where the vessel was warping out.  \"Because I don't need to.  My aunt has given me leave to go if I like; but she says it would break her heart if I do; and I would rather be screwed down to a desk for ever than do that, Bob Croaker.\"  The vessel, upon the deck of which the two boys now leaped, was a large, heavy-built barque.  Her sails were hanging loose, and the captain was giving orders to the men, who had their attention divided between their duties on board and their mothers, wives, and sisters, who still lingered to take a last farewell.  \"Now, then, those who don't want to go to sea had better go ashore,\" roared the captain.  There was an immediate rush to the side.  \"I say, Martin,\" whispered Barney, as he hurried past, \"jump down below for'ard; you can go out o' the harbour mouth with us and get ashore in one o' the shore-boats alongside.  They'll not cast off till we're well out.  I want to speak to you--\"  \"Man the fore-top-sail halyards,\" shouted the first mate.  \"Ay ay, sir-r-r,\" and the men sprang to obey.  Just then the ship touched on the bar at the mouth of the harbour, and in another moment she was aground.  \"There, now, she's hard and fast!\" roared the captain, as he stormed about the deck in a paroxysm of rage.  But man's rage could avail nothing.  They had missed the passage by a few feet, and now they had to wait the fall and rise again of the tide ere they could hope to get off.  In the confusion that followed, Bob Croaker suggested that Martin and he should take one of the punts, or small boats which hovered round the vessel, and put out to sea, where they might spend the day pleasantly in rowing and fishing.  \"Capital!\" exclaimed Martin.  \"Let's go at once.  Yonder's a little fellow who will let us have his punt for a few pence.  I know him. Hallo, Tom!\"  \"Ay, ay,\" squeaked a boy who was so small that he could scarcely lift the oar, light though it was, with which he sculled his punt cleverly along.  \"Shove alongside, like a good fellow; we want your boat for a little to row out a bit.\"  \"It's a-blowin' too hard,\" squeaked the small boy, as he ranged alongside.  \"I'm afeared you'll be blowed out.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Bob Croaker, grasping the rope which the boy threw to him.  \"Jump on board, younker; we don't want you to help us, and you're too heavy for ballast.  Slip down the side, Martin, and get in while I hold on to the rope.  All right? now I'll follow.  Here, shrimp, hold the rope till I'm in, and then cast off.  Look alive!\"  As Bob spoke, he handed the rope to the little boy; but, in doing so, let it accidentally slip out of his hand.  \"Catch hold o' the main chains, Martin,--quick!\"  But Martin was too late.  The current that swept out of the harbour whirled the light punt away from the ship's side, and carried it out seaward.  Martin instantly sprang to the oar, and turned the boat's head round.  He was a stout and expert rower, and would soon have regained the ship; but the wind increased at the moment, and blew in a squall off shore, which carried him further out despite his utmost efforts.  Seeing that all further attempts were useless, Martin stood up and waved his hand to Bob Croaker, shouting as he did so, \"Never mind, Bob, I'll make for the South Point.  Run round and meet me, and we'll row back together.\"  The South Point was a low cape of land which stretched a considerable distance out to sea, about three miles to the southward of Bilton harbour.  It formed a large bay, across which, in ordinary weather, a small boat might be rowed in safety.  Martin Rattler was well-known at the sea-port as a strong and fearless boy, so that no apprehension was entertained for his safety by those who saw him blown away.  Bob Croaker immediately started for the Point on foot a distance of about four miles by land; and the crew of the Firefly were so busied with their stranded vessel that they took no notice of the doings of the boys.  But the weather now became more and more stormy.  Thick clouds gathered on the horizon.  The wind began to blow with steady violence, and shifted a couple of points to the southward; so that Martin found it impossible to keep straight for the Point.  Still he worked perseveringly at his single oar, and sculled rapidly over the sea; but, as he approached the Point he soon perceived that no effort of which he was capable could enable him to gain it.  But Martin's heart was stout. He strove with all the energy of hope, until the Point was passed; and then, turning the head of his little boat towards it, he strove with all the energy of despair, until he fell down exhausted.  The wind and tide swept him rapidly out to sea; and when his terrified comrade reached the Point the little boat was but a speck on the seaward horizon.  Well was it then for Martin Rattler that a friendly heart beat for him on board the Firefly.  Bob Croaker carried the news to the town; but no one was found daring enough to risk his life out in a boat on that stormy evening.  The little punt had been long out of sight ere the news reached them, and the wind had increased to a gale.  But Barney O'Flannagan questioned Bob Croaker closely, and took particular note of the point of the compass at which Martin had disappeared; and when the Firefly at length got under weigh, he climbed to the fore-top cross-trees, and stood there scanning the horizon with an anxious eye.  It was getting dark, and a feeling of despair began to creep over the seaman's heart as he gazed round the wide expanse of water, on which nothing was to be seen except the white foam that crested the rising billows.  \"Starboard, hard!\" he shouted suddenly.  \"Starboard it is!\" replied the man at the wheel, with prompt obedience.  In another moment Barney slid down the back-stay and stood on the deck, while the ship rounded to and narrowly missed striking a small boat that floated keel up on the water.  There was no cry from the boat; and it might have been passed as a mere wreck, had not the lynx eye of Barney noticed a dark"]]]
