The Slogger fled from the scene like an evil spirit, while John Waters sprang up and grasped the pistol and poker.  The effect on Brassey in the drawing-room cannot be conceived, much less described.  He shot, as it were, out of the crimson-gilded chair and overturned the lamp, which burst on the floor.  Being half full of paraffin oil it instantly set fire to the gauze window-curtains.  The burglar made straight for the stairs.  John Waters, observing the light, dashed up the same, and the two met face to face on the landing, breathing hate and glaring defiance!    CHAPTER SIX.  RELATES A STIRRING INNOCENT.  Now it was at this critical moment that I chanced to come upon the scene.  I had just ascertained from the brass plate on the door that Dr McTougall dwelt there, and was thinking what an ugly unromantic name that was for a pretty girl as I descended the steps, when Dumps's first yell broke upon my astonished ears.  I recognised the voice at once, though I must confess that the second yell from the interior of the watering-pan perplexed me not a little, but the hideous clatter with which it was associated, and the sudden bursting out of flames in the drawing-room, drove all thoughts of Dumps instantly away.  My first impulse was to rush to the nearest fire-station; but a wild shouting in the lobby of the house arrested me.  I rang the bell violently.  At the same moment I heard the report of a pistol, and a savage curse, as a bullet came crashing through the door and went close past my head.  Then I heard a blow, followed by a groan.  This was succeeded by female shrieks overhead, and the violent undoing of the bolts, locks, and chains of the front door.  Thought is quick.  Burglary flashed into my mind!  A villainous-looking fellow leaped out as the door flew open.  I recognised him instantly as the man who had sold Dumps to me.  I put my foot in front of him.  He went over it with a wild pitch, and descended the steps on his nose!  I was about to leap on him when a policeman came tearing round the corner, just in time to receive the stunned Brassey with open arms, as he rose and staggered forward.  \"Just so.  Don't give way too much to your feelings!  I'll take care of you, my poor unfortunate fellow,\" said the policeman, as a brother in blue came to his assistance.  Already one of those ubiquitous creatures, a street-boy, had flown to the fire-station on the wings of hope and joy, and an engine came careering round the corner as I turned to rush up the stairs, which were already filled with smoke.  I dashed in the first door I came to.  A lady, partially clothed, stood there pale as death, and motionless.  \"Quick, madam! descend! the house is on fire!\"  I gasped in sharp sentences as I seized her.  \"Where is your--your (she looked young) _sister_?\"  I cried, as she resisted my efforts to lead her out.  \"I've no sister!\" she shrieked.  \"Your daughter, then!  Quick, direct me!\"  \"Oh! my darling!\" she cried, wringing her hands.  \"Where?\"  I shouted in desperation, for the smoke was thickening.  \"Up-stairs,\" she screamed, and rushed out, intending evidently to go up.  I caught her round the waist and forced her down the stairs, thrust her into the arms of an ascending fireman, and then ran up again, taking three steps at a time.  The cry of a child attracted me.  I made for a door opposite, and burst it open.  The scene that presented itself was striking.  Out of four cribs and a cradle arose five cones of bed-clothes, with a pretty little curly head surmounting each cone, and ten eyes blazing with amazement.  A tall nurse stood erect in the middle of the floor with outstretched arms, glaring.  Instantly I grasped a cone in each arm and bore it from the room. Blinded with smoke, I ran like a thunderbolt into the arms of a gigantic fireman.  \"Take it easy, sir.  You'll do far more work if you keep cool.  Straight on to front room!  Fire-escape's there by this time.\"  I understood, and darted into a front room, through the window of which the head of the fire-escape entered at the same moment, sending glass in splinters all over us.  It was immediately drawn back a little, enabling me to throw up the window-sash and thrust the two children into the arms of another fireman, whose head suddenly emerged from the smoke that rose from the windows below.  I could see that the fire was roaring out into the street, and lighting up hundreds of faces below, while the steady clank of engines told that the brigade was busily at work fighting the flames.  But I had no time to look or think.  Indeed, I felt as if I had no power of volition properly my own, but that I acted under the strong impulse of another spirit within me.  Darting back towards the nursery I met the first fireman dragging with his right hand the tall nurse, who seemed unreasonably to struggle against him, while in his left arm he carried two of the children, and the baby by its night-dress in his teeth.  I saw at a glance that he had emptied the nursery, and turned to search for another door.  During the whole of this scene--which passed in a few minutes--a feeling of desperate anxiety possessed me as to the fate of the young lady to whom I had given up my doggie.  I felt persuaded she slept on the same floor with the children, and groped about the passage in search of another door.  By this time the smoke was so dense that I was all but suffocated.  A minute or two more and it would be too late. I could not see.  Suddenly I felt a door and kicked it open.  The black smoke entered with me, but it was still clear enough inside for me to perceive the form of a girl lying on the floor.  It was she!  \"Miss McTougall!\"  I shouted, endeavouring to rouse her; but she had fainted.  Not a moment now to lose.  A lurid tongue of flame came up the staircase.  I rolled a blanket round the girl--head and all.  She was very light.  In the excitement of the moment I raised her as if she had been a child, and darted back towards the passage, but the few moments I had lost almost cost us our lives.  I knew that to breathe the dense smoke would be certain suffocation, and went through it holding my breath like a diver.  I felt as if the hot flames were playing round my head, and smelt the singeing of my own hair.  Another moment and I had reached the window, where the grim but welcome head of the escape still rested.  With a desperate bound I went head first into the shoot, taking my precious bundle along with me.  A fireman chanced to be going down the shoot at the time, carefully piloting one of the maids who had been rescued from the attics, and checking his speed with outspread legs.  Against him I canonned with tremendous force, and sent him and his charge in a heap to the bottom.  This was fortunate, for the pace at which I must have otherwise come down would have probably broken my neck.  As it was, I felt so stunned that I nearly lost consciousness.  Still I retained my senses sufficiently to observe a stout elderly little man in full evening dress, with his coat slit up behind to his neck, his face half-blackened, and his shaggy hair flying wildly in all directions-- chiefly upwards.  Amid wild cheering from the crowd I confusedly heard the conversation that followed.  \"They're all accounted for now, sir,\" said a policeman, who supported me.  The elderly gentleman had leaped forward with an exclamation of earnest thankfulness, and unrolled the blanket.  \"Not hurt!  No, thank God.  Lift her carefully now.  To the same house.--And who are you?\" he added, turning and looking full at me as I leaned in a dazed condition on the fireman's shoulder.  I heard the question and saw the speaker, but could not reply.  \"This is the gen'leman as saved two o' the child'n an' the young lady,\" said the tall fireman, whom I recognised as the one into whose bosom I had plunged on the upper floor.  \"Ay, an' he's the gen'leman,\" said another fireman, \"who shoved your missus, sir, into my arms, w'en she was bent on runnin' up-stairs.\"  \"Is this so?\" said the little gentleman, stepping forward and grasping my hand.  Still I could not speak.  I felt as if the whole affair were a dream, and looked on and listened with a vacant smile.  Just at that moment a long, melancholy wail rose above the roaring of the fire and clanking of the engines.  The cry restored me at once.  \"Dumps! my doggie!\"  I exclaimed; and, bursting through the crowd, rushed towards the now furiously-burning house, but strong hands restrained me.  \"What dog is it?\" asked the elderly gentleman.  A man, drenched, blackened, and bloodstained, whom I had not before observed, here said--  \"A noo dog, sir, Dumps by name, come to us this wery day.  We putt 'im in the scullery for the night.\"  Again I made a desperate effort to return to the burning house, but was restrained as before.  \"All right, sir,\" whispered a fireman in a confidential tone, \"I know the scullery.  The fire ain't got down there yet.  Your dog can only have bin damaged by water as yet.  I'll save 'im sir, never fear.\"  He went off with a quiet little nod that did much to comfort me. Meanwhile the elderly gentleman sought to induce me to leave the place and obtain refreshment in the house of a friendly neighbour, who had taken in his family.  \"You need rest, my dear sir,\" he said; \"come, I must take you in hand. You have rendered me a service which I can never repay.  What? Obstinate!  Do you know that I am a doctor, sir, and must be obeyed?\"  I smiled, but refused to move until the fate of Dumps was ascertained.  Presently the fireman returned with my doggie in his arms.  Poor Dumps!  He was a pitiable sight.  Tons of hot water had been pouring on his devoted head, and his shaggy, shapeless coat was so plastered to his long, little body, that he looked more like a drowned"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21753"],["title","The Norsemen in the West (#0)"],["body","NORSEMEN IN THE WEST, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE NORSEMEN IN THE WEST; OR AMERICA BEFORE COLUMBUS.  THE CURTAIN RISES AND THE PLAY BEGINS.  One fine autumn evening, between eight and nine hundred years ago, two large hairy creatures, bearing some resemblance to polar bears, might have been seen creeping slowly, and with much caution, toward the summit of a ridge that formed a spur to one of the ice-clad mountains of Greenland.  The creatures went on all-fours.  They had long bodies, short legs, shorter tails, and large round heads.  Having gained the top of the ridge they peeped over and beheld a hamlet nestled at the foot of a frowning cliff; and at the head of a smiling inlet.  We use these terms advisedly, because the cliff, being in deep shadow, looked unusually black and forbidding, while the inlet, besides being under the influence of a profound calm, was lit up on all its dimples by the rays of the setting sun.  The hamlet consisted of one large cottage and half a dozen small cots, besides several sheds and enclosures wherein were a few sleepy-looking sheep, some lean cattle, and several half-starved horses.  There was active life there also.  Smoke issued from the chimneys; fresh-looking women busied themselves about household work; rosy children tumbled in and out at the doors, while men in rough garments and with ruddy countenances mended nets or repaired boats on the shore.  On a bench in front of the principal cottage sat a sturdy man, scarcely middle-aged, with shaggy fair and flowing locks.  His right foot served as a horse to a rapturous little boy, whose locks and looks were so like to those of the man that their kinship was obvious--only the man was rugged and rough in exterior; the boy was round and smooth.  Tow typified the hair of the man; floss silk that of the boy.  Everything in and around the hamlet bore evidence of peace and thrift. It was a settlement of Norsemen--the _first_ Greenland settlement, established by Eric the Red of Iceland about the year 986--nearly twenty years before the date of the opening of our tale--and the hairy creatures above referred to had gone there to look at it.  Having gazed very intently over the ridge for a considerable time, they crept backwards with extreme caution, and, on getting sufficiently far down the hill-side to be safe from observation, rose on their hind-legs and began to talk; from which circumstance it may be concluded that they were human beings.  After talking, grinning, and glaring at each other for a few minutes, with gestures to correspond, as though on the point of engaging in mortal combat, they suddenly wheeled about and walked off at a rapid pace in the direction of a gorge in the mountains, the head of which was shut in by and filled up with cliffs and masses and fields of ice that overtopped the everlasting hills, and rested like a white crest on the blue sky.  Vast though it seemed, this was merely a tongue of those great glaciers of the mysterious North which have done, and are still doing, so much to modify the earth's economy and puzzle antiquarian philosophy; which form the fountain-head of influences that promote the circulation of the great deep, and constitute the cradle of those ponderous icebergs that cover the arctic seas.  From out that gloomy gorge a band of more than a hundred hairy creatures issued with wild shouts and upraised arms to welcome back the adventurous two.  They surrounded them, and forthwith the nation--for the entire nation was evidently there--held a general assembly or parliament on the spot.  There was a good deal of uproar and confusion in that parliament, with occasional attempts on the part of several speakers to obtain a hearing at one and the same time--in which respects this parliament bore some resemblance to civilised assemblies of the present day.  There was also an immense amount of gesticulation and excitement.  At last there uprose a man clad in garments that had once belonged to a seal, and with a face that was quite as round and nearly as flat as a frying-pan.  He stood fully half a foot higher than the tallest of his fellows.  Like the adventurous two he had a tail--a very short tail--to his coat; but indeed this might be said of all the men of the tribe. The women's tails, however, were long.  Perhaps this was meant as a mark of distinction, for their costume was so very similar to that of the men that their smaller size and longer tails alone marked the difference. To be sure there was additional presumptive evidence of their sex in the fact that most of them carried babies in their hoods; which hoods were made preposterously large for the express purpose of containing the babies.  To the tall man with the flat face the assembly listened with eager looks, bated breath, and open mouths.  What he said--who can tell?  His language was unintelligible to civilised ears.  Not so, however, his actions, which were vigorous and full of meaning, and comprehensible by all nations.  If there be any significance in signs at all he began by saying, \"Hold your stupid tongues and _I_ will speak.\"  This drew forth loud and prolonged applause--as consummate impudence usually does.  When he pointed with both hands to the women and children, and spoke in tender tones, instantly thereafter growling in his speech, gnashing his teeth, glaring fiercely, waving one hand at the surrounding hills and shaking the other, clenched, at the unoffending sea--he was obviously stating his grievances, namely, that the white men had come there to wrest from him his native hills and glaciers, and rob him of his wife and children, and that he defied them to come on and do their worst, seeing that, in regard to the whole assembled white world in arms he did not care a button--or a walrus-tusk, for buttons were unknown to these creatures at that time.  When, suddenly changing his manner and tone, he seized a spear, hissed his sentiments through his teeth with great volubility, and made a furious plunge that caused the assembly to gasp, and the man nearest the spear point to shrivel up--what _could_ be his meaning save that nothing short of a hole right through the body of a Norseman could appease the spirit of indignation that caused his blood to boil?  And when, finally, he pointed to the setting sun, traced a line with his finger from it downward to the centre of the earth under his feet, then shook his spear wrathfully toward the sea and wound up with a tremendous Ho! that would have startled the echoes of the place had there been any there, it was plain to the meanest capacity that an attack--impetuous and overwhelming--was to be made on the strangers at midnight.  Whatever were his sentiments, the assembly heartily appreciated, applauded, and approved them.  They cheered and shouted \"Hear, hear,\" after their own fashion, and then the whole band rushed back into the mountain gorge,--doubtless with the intent to gorge themselves with raw blubber, prepare their weapons, and snatch a little repose before issuing forth to battle.  But let us return to the Norsemen, over whose innocent heads such awful prospects were impending.  The sturdy man with the fair shaggy locks was Leif, the son of Eric the Red of Iceland.  The boy with the silken curls, who rode on his foot so joyously, was his son Olaf.  Eric had died several years before the date on which our tale opens, and Leif inherited his cottage and property at Brattalid in Ericsfiord, on the west coast of Greenland--the hamlet which we have already described.  \"Come now, Olaf,\" said Leif, flinging the child from his foot to his knee, and thence to the ground, \"give me your hand; we shall go see how the boats and nets get on.--Hey! there goes a puff of wind.  We shall have more presently.\"  He paused and scanned the seaward horizon with that intent abstracted gaze which is peculiar to seafaring men.  So long did he gaze, and so earnestly, that the child looked up in his face with an expression of surprise, and then at the horizon, where a dark blue line indicated the approach of a breeze.  \"What do you see, father?\" asked Olaf.  \"Methinks I see two ships,\" replied Leif.  At this there came a sweet musical voice from the cottage:--\"Ships, brother!  Did I not tell you that I had a dream about two ships, and said I not that I was sure something was going to happen?\"  The speaker appeared in the doorway, drying her hands and arms on a towel,--for she had been washing dishes.  She was a fair comely young woman, with exceedingly deep blue eyes, and a bright colour in her cheeks,--for women of the richer class were remarkably healthy and well-made in those days.  They did a great deal of hard work with their hands, hence their arms were strong and well developed without losing anything of their elegance.  \"You are always dreaming, widow Gudrid,\" said Leif, with a quiet smile,--for he was no believer in dreams or superstitions, in which respect he differed much from the men and women of his time; \"nevertheless, I am bound to admit that you did tell me that `something' was going to happen, and no one can deny that something _is_ about to occur just now.  But your dream happened a month or six weeks ago, and the `something,' which you are pleased to assume is these two ships, is only happening to-day.  See, now, I can be a more definite prophet than thou: I will prophesy that Yule is coming,--and it will surely come if you only wait long enough!\"  \"You are an unbeliever, brother-in-law,\" retorted Gudrid, with a laugh; \"but I have not time to reason with you.  These ships will bring strangers, and I must prepare to show them hospitality.--Come, Olaf, help me to put the house in order.\"  Thus summoned, Olaf followed Gudrid into the house with alacrity, for he was passionately fond of his pretty aunt, who stood in the place of a mother to him, his own mother having died when he was an infant.  \"But, aunt,\" said Olaf, checking himself in the doorway and looking"]]]
