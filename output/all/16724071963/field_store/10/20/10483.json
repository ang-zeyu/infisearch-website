Molly and I did all the clipping and most of the writing, one week.\"  \"Did you?\" said the editor emphatically.  \"Then you did well.  I remember there was one strong number.\"  \"Molly,\" said Jack, as soon as they were out in the kitchen, \"there's five besides our family.  They won't leave a thing for us.\"  \"There's hardly enough for them, even,\" said Mary.  \"What'll we do?\"  \"We can cook!\" said Jack, with energy.  \"We'll cook while they're eating.  You know how, and so do I.\"  \"You can wait on table as well as I can,\" said Mary.  There was something cronyish and also self-helpful, in the way Jack and Molly boiled eggs and toasted bread and fried bacon and made coffee, and took swift turns at eating and at waiting on the table.  The editor of the _Eagle_ heard the whole of the trout item, and about the runaway, and told Jack to send him the next big trout he caught.  There was another item of news that was soon to be ready for Mr. Murdoch.  Jack was conscious of a restless, excited state of mind, and Mary said things that made him worse.  \"You want to get somewhere else as badly as I do,\" he remarked, just as they came back from taking in the pies to the dinner-table.  \"I feel, sometimes, as if I could fly!\" exclaimed Mary.  Jack walked out through the hall to the front door, and stood there thinking, with a hard-boiled egg in one hand and a piece of toast in the other.  The street he looked into was silent and deserted, from the bridge to the hotel corner.  He looked down to the creek, for a moment, and then he looked the other way.  \"I believe Molly could do 'most anything I could do,\" he said to himself; \"unless it was catching a runaway team.  She couldn't ha' caught that wagon.  Hullo, what's that?  Jingo!  The hotel cook must have made a regular bonfire to fry my trout!\"  He wheeled as he spoke, and dashed back through the house, shouting:  \"Father, the Washington Hotel's on fire!--over the kitchen!\"  \"Ladder, Jack.  Rope.  Bucket,\" cried the tall blacksmith, coolly rising from the table, and following.  As for the rest, beginning with the editor of the _Eagle_, it was almost as if they had been told that they were themselves on fire.  Even Aunt Melinda exclaimed: \"He ought to have told us more about it!  Where is it?  How'd it ever catch?  Oh, dear me!  It's the oldest part of the hotel.  It's as dry as a bone, and it'll burn like tinder!\"  Everybody else was saying something as all jumped and ran, but Jack and his father were silent.  Ladder, rope, water-pails, were caught up, as if they were going to work in the shop, but the moment they were in the street again it seemed as if John Ogden's lungs must be as deep as the bellows of his forge.  \"Fire!  Fire!  Fire!\"  His full, resonant voice sent out the sudden warning.  [Illustration: _Fighting the Fire_.]  \"Fire!  Fire!  Fire!\" shouted Jack, and every child of the Ogden family, except Mary, echoed with such voice as belonged to each.  Through the wide gate of the hotel barn-yard dashed the blacksmith and his son, with their ladder, at the moment when Mrs. Livermore came out at the kitchen door, wiping a plate.  All the other inmates of the hotel were gathered around the long table in the dining-hall, and they were too busy with pie and different kinds of pudding, to notice anything outdoors.  \"Where is the fire, Mr. Ogden?\" she said, in a fatigued tone.  \"The fire's on your roof, close to the chimney,\" said the blacksmith. \"May be we can put it out, if we're quick about it.  Call everybody to hand up water.\"  Up went a pair of hands, and out came a great scream.  Another shrill scream and another, followed in quick succession, and the plate she had held, fell and was shivered into fragments on the stone door-step.  \"Foi-re!  Foi-re!  Foi-re-re-re!\" yelled the hotel cook.  \"The house is a-bur-rnin'!  Wa-ter!  Waw-aw-ter!\"  The doors to passage-ways of the hotel were open, and in a second more her cry was taken up by voices that sent the substance of it ringing through the dining-hall.  Plates fell from the hands of waiters, coffee-cups were upset, chairs were overturned, all manner of voices caught up the alarm.  It would have been a very serious matter but for the promptness of Jack Ogden and his very cool father.  The ladder was planted and climbed, there was a quick dash along the low but high-ridged roof of the kitchen addition of the hotel,--the rope was put around Jack's waist, and then he was able safely to use both hands in pouring water from the pails around the foot of the chimney.  Other feet came fast to the foot of the ladder.  More went tramping into the rooms under the roof.  The pumps in the kitchen and in the barn-yard were worked with frantic energy; pail after pail was carried upstairs and up the ladder; water was thrown in all directions; nothing was left undone that could be done, and a great many things were done that seemed hardly possible.  \"Hot work, Jack,\" said his father.  \"It's a-gaining on us.  Glad they'd all about got through dinner,--though Livermore tells me he's insured.\"  \"I can stand it,\" said Jack.  \"They have steam fire-engines in the city, though.  Oh, but wouldn't I like to see one at work, once.  I'd like to be a fireman!\"  \"That's about what you are, just now,\" said his father, and then he turned toward the ladder and shouted:  \"Hurry up that water!  Quick, now!  Bring an axe!  I want to smash the roof in.  Bear it, Jack.  We've got to beat this fire.\"  The main building of the Washington Hotel was long, rather than high, with an open veranda along Main Street.  The third story was mainly steep roof and dormer-windows, and the kitchen addition had only a story and a half.  It was an easy building to get into or out of.  Very quickly, after the cry of \"Fire!\" was heard, the only people in it, upstairs, were such of the guests as had the pluck to go and pack their trunks.  The lower floor was very well crowded, and it was almost a relief to the men actually at work as firemen that so many other men kept well back because they were in their \"Sunday-go-to-meeting\" clothes.  Everybody was inclined to praise Jack Ogden and his father, who were making so brave a fight on the roof within only a few feet of the smoke and blaze.  It was heroic to look a burning house straight in the face and conquer it.  During fully half an hour there seemed to be doubt about the victory, but the pails of water came up rapidly, a line of men and boys along the roof conveyed them to the hands of Jack, and the fire had a damp time of it, with no wind to help.  The blacksmith had chopped a hole in the roof, and Tom and Sam Bannerman, the carpenters, were already calculating what they would charge old Livermore to put the addition in order again.  \"There, Jack,\" said his father, at last, \"we can quit, now.  The fire's under.  Somebody else can take a turn.  It's the hottest kind of work. Come along.  We've done our share, and a little more, too.\"  Jack had just swallowed a puff of smoke, but as soon as he could stop coughing, he said:  \"I've had enough.  I'm coming.\"  Other people seemed to agree with them; but there would have been less said about it if little Joe Hawkins had not called out:  \"Three cheers for the Ogdens!\"  The cheers were given as the two volunteer firemen came down the ladder, but there were no speeches made in reply.  Jack hurried back home at once, but his father had to stop and talk with the Bannermans and old Hammond, the miller.  \"Jack,\" said his mother, looking at him, proudly, from head to foot, \"you're always doing something or other.  We were looking at you, all the while.\"  \"He hasn't hurt his Sunday clothes a bit,\" said Aunt Melinda, but there was quite a crowd around the gate, and she did not hug him.  He was a little damp, his face was smoky, his shirt-collar was wilted, and his shoes would require a little work, but otherwise he was none the worse.  Jack went into the house, saying that he must brush his clothes; but, really it was because he wished to get away.  He did not care to talk to anybody.  \"I never felt so, in all my life, as I did when sitting on that roof, fighting that fire,\" he said aloud, as he went upstairs; and he did not know, even then, how excited he had been, silent and cool as he had seemed.  In that short time, he had dreamed of more cities than he was ever likely to see, and of doing more great things than he could ever possibly do, and when he came down the ladder he felt older than when he went up.  He had no idea that much the same thoughts had come to Mary, nor did he know how fully she believed that he could do anything, and that she was as capable as he.  \"Father's splendid, too,\" she said, \"but then he never had any chance, here, and Mother didn't either.  Jack ought to have a chance.\"     CHAPTER IV.  CAPTAIN MARY.  Mr. Murdoch had stood on the main street corner; taking notes for the _Eagle_, but now he came back to say the fire was out and it was nearly time for Sunday-school.  It seemed strange to have Sunday-school just after a fire, but the Ogden family and its visitors at once made ready.  It was a quarterly meeting, with general exercises and singing, and a review of the quarter's lessons.  The church was full by the hour for opening, and the school had a very prosperous look.  Elder Holloway and Mr. Murdoch and two other important men sat in the pulpit, and Joab Spokes, the superintendent, stood in front of them to conduct the exercises.  The elder seemed to be glancing benevolently around the room, through his spectacles, but there were some things there which could be seen without glasses, and he must have seen those also.  Miss Glidden looked particularly well and very stately, as she sat in the pew in front of her class (if it were hers), with Mary Ogden.  Her first words, on coming in to take command, had "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21846"],["title","Crowded Out o' Crofield; or, The Boy who made his Way (#6)"],["body","been:  \"Mary, dear, don't go.  I really wish you to stay.  You may be of assistance.\"  Mary flushed a little, but she said nothing in reply.  She remained, and she certainly did assist, for the girls looked at her almost all the while, and Miss Glidden had no trouble whatever, and nothing to do but to look pleased and beaming and dignified.  The elder, it was noticed, seemed to feel special interest in the part taken in the exercises by the class with two teachers, one for show and one for work.  He even seemed to see something comical in the situation, and there was positive admiration in a remark he made to Mr. Murdoch:  \"She's a true teacher.  There's really only one teacher to that class. She must have been born with a knack for it!\"  Elder Holloway, with all his years and experience, had not understood the case of Miss Glidden's class more perfectly than had one young observer at the other end of the church.  Jack Ogden could not see so well as those great men in the pulpit, but then he could hear much and surmise the rest.  \"All those girls will stand by Molly!\" he said to himself.  \"I hope it won't be long before school's dismissed,\" he added.  He had reasons for this hope.  He was a little late through lingering to take a curious look at what was left of the fire.  The street had a littered look.  The barns and stables were wide open, and deserted, for the horses had been led to places of safety.  There seemed to be an impression that the hotel was half destroyed; but the damage had not been very great.  A faint, thin film of blue was eddying along the ridgepole of the kitchen addition.  Jack noticed it, but did not know what it meant.  A more practiced observer would have known that, hidden from sight, buried in the punk of the dry-rotted timber, was a vicious spark of fire, stealthily eating its way through the punk of the resinous pine.  Jack paid little attention to the tiny smoke-wreath, but he was compelled to pay some attention to the weather.  It had been hot from sunrise until noon, and the air had grown heavier since.  \"I know what that haze means,\" said Jack to himself, as he looked toward the Cocahutchie.  \"There's a thunderstorm coming by and by, and nobody knows just when.  I'll be on the lookout for it.\"  For this reason he was glad that he was compelled to find a seat not far from the door of the church.  Twice he went out to look at the sky, and the second time he saw banks of lead-colored clouds forming on the northwestern horizon.  Returning he said to several of the boys near the vestibule:  \"You've just time to get home, if you don't want a ducking.\"  Each boy passed along the warning; and when the school stood up to sing the last hymn, even the girls and the older people knew of the coming storm.  There was a brief silence before the first note of the organ, and through that silence nearly everybody could catch the shrill squeak in which little Joe Hawkins tried to speak very low and secretly.  \"Deakin Cobb, we want to git aout!  We've just time to git home if we don't want a duckin'.\"  The hymn started raggedly and in a wrong pitch; and just then the great room grew suddenly darker, and there was a low rumble of thunder.  \"Mary Ogden!\" exclaimed Miss Glidden, \"what are you doing?  They can't go yet!\"  Mary was singing as loudly and correctly as usual, but she was out in the aisle, and the girls of that class were promptly obeying the motion of hand and head with which she summoned them to walk out of the church.  Elder Holloway may have been only keeping time when he nodded his head, but he was looking at Miss Glidden's class.  So was Miss Glidden, in a bewildered way, as if she, like little Bo-peep, were losing her sheep.  Mary was following a strong and sudden impulse.  Nevertheless, by the time that class was out of its pews the next caught the idea, and believed it a prudent thing to do.  They followed in good order, singing as they went.  \"The girls out first,--then the boys,\" said Elder Holloway, between two stanzas.  \"One class at a time.  No hurry.\"  Darker grew the air.  Jack, out in front of the church, was watching the blackest cloud he had ever seen, as it came sweeping across the sky.  The people walked out calmly enough, but all stopped singing at the door and ran their best.  \"Run, Molly!  Run for home!\" shouted Jack, seeing Mary coming.  \"It's going to be an awful storm.\"  [Illustration: _\"Run for Home.\"_]  Inside the church there was much hesitation, for a moment; but Miss Glidden followed her class without delay, and all the rest followed as fast as they could, and were out in half the usual time.  Joe Hawkins heard Jack's words to Molly.  \"Run, boys,\" he echoed.  \"Cut for home!  There's a fearful storm coming!\"  He was right.  Great drops were already falling now and then, and there was promise of a torrent to follow.  \"I don't want to spoil these clothes,\" said Jack, uneasily.  \"I need these to wear in the city.  The storm isn't here yet, though.  I'll wait a minute.\"  He was holding his hat on and looking up at the steeple when he said that.  It was a very old, wooden steeple, tall, slender, and somewhat rheumatic, and he knew there must be more wind up so high than there was nearer the ground.  \"It's swinging!\" he said suddenly.  \"I can see it bend!  Glad they're all getting out.  There come Elder Holloway and Mr. Murdoch.  See the elder run!  I hope he won't try to get to Hawkins's.  He'd better run for our house.\"  That was precisely the counsel given the good man by the editor, and the elder said:  \"I'd like to go there.  I'd like to see that clever girl again.  Come, Murdoch; no time to lose!\"  The blast was now coming lower, and the gloom was deepening.  Flash--rattle--boom--crash! came a glitter of lightning and a great peal of thunder.  \"Here it is!\" cried Jack.  \"If it isn't a dry blast!\"  It was something like the first hot breath of a hurricane.  To and fro swung the tottering old steeple for a moment, and then there was another crash--a loud, grinding, splintering, roaring crash--as the spire reeled heavily down, lengthwise, through the shattered roof of the meeting-house!  Except for Mary Ogden's cleverness, the ruins might have fallen upon the crowded Sunday-school.  Jack turned and ran for home.  He was a good runner, but he only just escaped the deluge following that thunderbolt.  Jack turned upon reaching the house, and as he looked back he uttered a loud exclamation, and out from the house rushed all the people who were gathered there.  \"Jingo!\" Jack shouted.  \"The old hotel's gone, sure, this time!\"  The burrowing spark had smoldered slowly along, until it felt the first fanning of the rising gale.  In another minute it flared as if under a blowpipe, and soon a fierce sheet of flame came bursting through the roof.  Down poured the rain; but the hottest of that blaze was roofed over, and the fire had its own way with the empty addition.  \"We couldn't help if we should try,\" exclaimed Mr. Ogden.  \"I'll put on my old clothes, any way,\" said Jack.  \"Nobody knows what's coming.\"  \"I will, too,\" said his father.  Jack paused a moment, and said, from the foot of the stairs:  \"The steeple's down,--right through the meeting-house.  It has smashed the whole church!\"  The sight of the fire had made him withhold that news for a minute; but now, for another minute, the fire was almost forgotten.  Elder Holloway began to say something in praise of Mary Ogden about her leading out the class, but she darted away.  \"Let me get by, Jack,\" she said.  \"Let me pass, please.  They all would have been killed if they had waited!  But I was thinking only of my class and the rain.\"  She ran up-stairs and Jack followed.  Then the elder made a number of improving remarks about discipline and presence of mind, and the natural fitness of some people for doing the right thing in an emergency.  He might have said more, but all were drawn to the windows to watch the strife between the fire and the rain.  The fierce wind drove the smoke through the building, compelling the landlord and his wife to escape as best they could, and, for the time being, the victory seemed to be with the fire.  \"Seems to me,\" said the blacksmith, somberly, \"as if Crofield was going to pieces.  This is the worst storm we ever had.  The meeting-house is gone, and the hotel's going!\"  Mary, at her window, was looking out in silence, but her face was bright rather than gloomy.  Even if she was \"only a girl,\" she had found an opportunity for once, and she had not proved unequal to it.     CHAPTER V.  JACK OGDEN'S RIDE.  Jack needed only a few minutes to put on the suit he had worn when fishing.  \"There, now,\" he said; \"if there's going to be a big flood in the creek I'm going down to see it, rain or no rain.  There's no telling how high it'll rise if this pour keeps on long enough.  It rattles on the roof like buckshot!\"  \"That's the end of the old tavern,\" said Jack to Mary, as he stood in the front room looking out.  He was barefooted, and had come so silently that she was startled.  \"Jack!\" she exclaimed, turning around, \"they might have all been killed when the steeple came down.  I heard what Joe Hawkins said, and I led out the class.\"  \"Good for Joe!\" said Jack.  \"We need a new meeting-house, any way.  I heard the elder say so.  Less steeple, next time, and more church!\"  \"I'd like to see a real big church,\" said Mary,--\"a city church.\"  \"You'd like to go to the city as much as I would,\" said Jack.  \"Yes, I would,\" she replied emphatically.  \"Just you get there and I'll come afterward, if I can.  I've been studying twice as hard since I left the academy, but I don't know why.\"  \"I know it,\" said Jack; \"but I've had no time for books.\"  \"Jack!  Molly!\" the voice of Aunt Melinda came up the stairway.  \"Are you ever coming down-stairs?\"  \"What will the elder say to my coming down barefoot?\" said Jack; \"but I don't want shoes if I'm going out into the mud.\"  \"He won't care at such a time as this,\" "]]]
