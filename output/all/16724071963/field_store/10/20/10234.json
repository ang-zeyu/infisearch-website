He accordingly led his friend from one part of the ship to another, explaining and commenting as he went, and certainly Robin's wonder did not decrease.  From the grand saloon--which was like a palatial drawing-room, in size as well as in gorgeous furniture--to the mighty cranks and boilers of its engines, everything in and about the ship was calculated to amaze. As Slagg justly remarked, \"It was stunnin'.\"  When our hero was saturated with the \"Big Ship\" till he could hold no more, his friend took him back to his berth, and left him there for a time to his meditations.  Returning soon after, he sat down on a looker.  \"I say, Robin Wright,\" he began, thrusting his hands into his trousers-pockets, \"it looks a'most as if I had smuggled you aboard of this ship like a stowaway.  Nobody seems to know you are here, an' what's more, nobody seems to care.  Your partikler owner ain't turned up yet, an' it's my opinion he won't turn up to-night, so I've spoke to the stooard--he's _my_ owner, you know--an' he says you'd better just turn into my berth to-night, an' you'll get showed into your own to-morrow.\"  \"But where will _you_ sleep?\" asked Robin, with some hesitation.  \"Never you mind that, my young electrician.  That's _my_ business.  What you've got to do is to turn in.\"  Jeff and another lad, who were preparing to retire for the night at the time, laughed at this, but Robin paid no attention, thanked his friend, and said that as he was rather tired he would accept his kind offer.  Thereafter, pulling out the small Bible which he had kept in his pocket since leaving home, he went into a corner, read a few verses, and then knelt down to pray.  The surprise of the other lads was expressed in their eyes, but they said nothing.  Just then the door opened, and the lad named Stumps entered.  Catching sight of Robin on his knees he opened his eyes wide, pursed his mouth, and gave a low whistle.  Then he went up to Robin and gave him a slight kick.  Supposing that it was an accident, Robin did not move, but on receiving another and much more decided kick, he rose and turned round. At the same moment Stumps received a resounding and totally unexpected slap on the cheek from Jim Slagg, who planted himself before him with clenched fists and flashing eyes.  \"What d'ye mean by interferin' wi' _my_, friend at his dewotions, you monkey-faced polypus?\" he demanded fiercely.  The monkey-faced polypus replied not a word, but delivered a right-hander that might have felled a small horse.  Jim Slagg however was prepared for that.  He turned his head neatly to one side so as to let the blow pass, and at the same moment planted his knuckles on the bridge of his opponent's nose and sent him headlong into Jeff's bunk, which lay conveniently behind.  Jumping furiously out of that, and skinning his shins in the act, Stumps rushed at Slagg, who, leaping lightly aside, tripped him up and gave him a smack on the left ear as he passed, by way of keeping him lively.  Unsubdued by this, Stumps gathered himself up and made a blind rush at his adversary, but was abruptly stopped by what Jeff called a \"dab on the nose.\"  Repeating the rush, Stumps was staggered by a plunging blow on the forehead, and he paused to breathe, gazing the while at his foe, who, though a smaller youth than himself, was quite as strong.  \"If you've had enough, monkey-face,\" said Slagg, with a bland smile, \"don't hesitate to say so, an' I'll shake hands; but if you'd prefer a little more before goin' to bed, just let me know, and--\"  Slagg here performed some neat and highly suggestive motions with his fists by way of finishing the sentence.  Evidently Stumps wanted more, for, after a brief pause, he again rushed at Slagg, who, stepping aside like a Spanish matador, allowed his foe to expend his wrath on the bulkhead of the cabin.  \"You'll go through it next time, Stumps, if you plunge like that,\" said Jeff, who had watched the fight with lively interest, and had encouraged the combatants with sundry marks of applause, besides giving them much gratuitous advice.  Regardless alike of encouragement and advice, the angry youth turned round once more and received a buffet that sent him sprawling on the table, off which he fell and rolled under it.  There he lay and panted.  \"Now, my sweet polypus,\" said the victor, going down on one knee and patting the vanquished on his shoulder, \"next time you feels tempted to kick a gentleman--specially a electrician--at his dewotions, think of Jim Slagg an' restrain yourself.  I bear you no ill-will however--so, good-night.\"  Saying this, Robin's champion left the room and Stumps retired to his berth growling.  Before passing from the subject, we may add that, the next night, Robin--whose owner was still absent--was again hospitably invited to share the cabin of his friend and protector.  When about to retire to rest he considered whether it was advisable to risk the repetition of the scene of the previous, night, and, although not quite easy in his conscience about it, came to the conclusion that it would be well to say his prayers in bed.  Accordingly, he crept quietly into his berth and lay down, but Jim Slagg, who was present, no sooner saw what he was about than he jumped up with a roar of indignation.  \"What are you about?\" he cried, \"ain't you goin' to say your prayers, you white-livered electrician?  Come, git up!  If _I'm_ to fight, _you_ must pray!  D'ye hear?  Turn out, I say.\"  With that he seized Robin, dragged him out of bed, thrust him on his knees, and bade him \"do his dooty.\"  At first Robin's spirit rose in rebellion, but a sense of shame at his moral cowardice, and a perception of the justice of his friend's remark, subdued him.  He did pray forthwith, though what the nature of his prayer was we have never been able to ascertain, and do not care to guess.  The lesson, however, was not lost.  From that date forward Robin Wright was no longer ashamed or afraid to be seen in the attitude of prayer.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  LAYING THE CABLE--\"FAULTS\" AND FAULT-FINDING--ANXIETIES, ACCIDENTS, AND OTHER MATTERS.  Come with us now, good reader, to another and very different scene--out upon the boundless sea.  The great Atlantic is asleep, but his breast heaves gently and slowly like that of a profound sleeper.  The Great Eastern looks like an island on the water--steady as a rock, obedient only to the rise and fall of the ocean swell, as she glides along at the rate of six knots an hour.  All is going well.  The complicated-looking paying-out machinery revolves smoothly; the thread-like cable passes over the stern, and down into the deep with the utmost regularity.  The shore-end of the cable--twenty-seven miles in length, and much thicker than the deep-sea portion--had been laid at Valentia, on the 22nd of July, amid prayer and praise, speech-making, and much enthusiasm, on the part of operators and spectators.  On the 23rd, the end of the shore cable was spliced to that of the main cable, and the voyage had begun.  The first night had passed quietly, and upwards of eighty miles of the cable had gone out of the after-tank, over the big ship's stern, and down to its ocean-bed, when Robin Wright--unable to sleep--quietly slipped into his clothes, and went on deck.  It was drawing near to dawn.  A knot of electricians and others were chatting in subdued tones about the one subject that filled the minds of all in the ship.  \"What! unable to sleep, like the rest of us?\" said Ebenezer Smith, accosting Robin as he reached the deck.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Robin, with a sleepy smile, \"I've been thinking of the cable so much that I took to dreaming about it when I fell asleep, and it suddenly turned into the great sea-serpent, and choked me to such an extent that I awoke, and then thought it better to get up and have a look at it.\"  \"Ah! my boy, you are not the only one whom the cable won't let sleep. It will be well looked after during the voyage, for there are two sets of electricians aboard--all of them uncommonly wide awake--one set representing the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, under Monsieur de Sauty; the other set representing the Atlantic Telegraph Company, under Mr Varley and Professor Thomson.  The former are to test the electrical state of the cable, and to keep up signals with the shore every hour, night and day, during the voyage, while the latter are to watch and report as to whether the cable fulfils her conditions, as specified in the contract.  So you see the smallest fault or hitch will be observed at once.\"  \"Do you mean, sir,\" asked Robin in surprise, \"that telegraphing with the shore is to be kept up continually _all_ the voyage!\"  \"Yes, my boy, I do,\" answered Smith.  \"The lengths of the cable in the three tanks are joined up into one length, and telegraphing--for the purpose of testing it--has been kept up with the shore without intermission from the moment we left Ireland, and began to pay out.  It will be continued, if all goes well, until we land the other and in Newfoundland.  The tests are threefold,--first, for insulation, which, as you know, means the soundness and perfection of the gutta-percha covering that prevents the electricity from escaping from the wires, through the sea, into the earth; secondly, for continuity, or the unbroken condition of the conductor or copper core throughout its whole length; and, thirdly, to determine the resistance of the conductor, by which is meant its objection to carry our messages without vigorous application of the spur in the form of increased electrical power in our batteries.  You see, Robin, every message sent to us from the shore, as well as every message sent by us in reply, has to travel through the entire length of the cable, namely about 2400 miles, and as every mile of distance increases this unwillingness, or resistance, we have to increase the electrical power in the batteries, in proportion to the distance to which we want to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21717"],["title","Battles with the Sea (#0)"],["body","WITH THE SEA, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  HEROES OF THE LIFEBOAT AND ROCKET.  SKIRMISHES WITH THE SUBJECT GENERALLY.  It ought to be known to all English boys that there is a terrible and costly war in which the British nation is at all times engaged.  No intervals of peace mark the course of this war.  Cessations of hostilities there are for brief periods, but no treaties of peace.  \"War to the knife\" is its character.  Quarter is neither given nor sought. Our foe is unfeeling, unrelenting.  He wastes no time in diplomatic preliminaries; he scorns the courtesies of national life.  No ambassadors are recalled, no declarations of war made.  Like the Red Savage he steals upon us unawares, and, with a roar of wrathful fury, settles down to his deadly work.  How does this war progress?  It is needful to put and reiterate this question from time to time, because new generations of boys are always growing up, who, so far from being familiar with the stirring episodes of this war, and the daring deeds of valour performed, scarcely realise the fact that such a war is being carried on at all, much less that it costs hundreds of lives and millions of money every year.  It may be styled a naval war, being waged chiefly in boats upon the sea. It is a war which will never cease, because our foe is invincible, and we will never give in; a war which, unlike much ordinary warfare, is never unjust or unnecessary; which cannot be avoided, which is conducted on the most barbarous principles of deathless enmity, but which, nevertheless, brings true glory and honour to those heroes who are ever ready, night and day, to take their lives in their hands and rush into the thick of the furious fray.  Although this great war began--at least in a systematic manner--only little more than fifty years ago, it will not end until the hearts of brave and generous Britons cease to beat, and the wild winds cease to blow, for the undying and unconquerable enemy of whom we write is--the Storm!  \"Death or victory!\" the old familiar warwhoop, is not the final war-cry here.  Death is, indeed, always faced--sometimes met--and victory is often gained; but, final conquests being impossible, and the \"piping times of peace\" being out of the question, the signal for the onset has been altered, and the world's old battle-cry has been exchanged for the soul-stirring shout of \"Rescue the perishing!\"  Though our foe cannot be slain, he can, like the genii of Eastern story, be baffled.  In the days of old, the Storm had it nearly all his own way.  Hearts, indeed, were not less brave, but munitions of war were wanting.  In this matter, as in everything else, the world is better off now than it was then.  Our weapons are more perfect, our engines more formidable.  We can now dash at our enemy in the very heart of his own terrible strongholds; fight him where even the boldest of the ancient Vikings did not dare to venture, and rescue the prey from the very jaws of death amid the scenes of its wildest revelry.  The heroes who recruit the battalions of our invincible army are the bronzed and stalwart men of our sea-coast towns, villages, and hamlets-- men who have had much and long experience of the foe with whom they have to deal.  Their panoply is familiar to most of us.  The helmet, a sou'wester; the breastplate, a lifebelt of cork; the sword, a strong short oar; their war-galley, a splendid _lifeboat_; and their shield-- the Hand of God.  In this and succeeding chapters I purpose to exhibit and explain in detail our Lifeboats, and the great, the glorious work which they annually accomplish; also the operations of the life-saving Rocket, which has for many years rescued innumerable lives, where, from the nature of circumstances, Lifeboats could not have gone into action.  I hold that we--especially those of us who dwell in the interior of our land--are not sufficiently alive to the deeds of daring, the thrilling incidents, the terrible tragedies and the magnificent rescues which are perpetually going on around our shores.  We are not sufficiently impressed, perhaps, with the _nationality_ of the work done by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which manages our fleet of 270 lifeboats. We do not fully appreciate, it may be, the personal interest which we ourselves have in the great war, and the duty--to say nothing of privilege--which lies upon us to lend a helping hand in the good cause.  Before going into the marrow of the subject, let us put on the wings of imagination, and soar to such a height that we shall be able to take in at one eagle glance all the coasts of the United Kingdom--a sweep of about 5000 miles all round!  It is a tremendous sight, for a storm is raging!  Black clouds are driving across the murky sky; peals of thunder rend the heavens; lightning gleams at intervals, revealing more clearly the crested billows that here roar over the sands, or there churn and seethe among the rocks.  The shrieking gale sweeps clouds of spray high over our windward cliffs, and carries flecks of foam far inland, to tell of the dread warfare that is raging on the maddened sea.  Near the shore itself numerous black specks are seen everywhere, like ink-spots on the foam.  These are wrecks, and the shrieks and the despairing cries of the perishing rise above even the roaring of the gale.  Death is busy, gathering a rich harvest, for this is a notable night in the great war.  The Storm-fiend is roused.  The enemy is abroad in force, and has made one of his most violent assaults, so that from Shetland to Cornwall, ships and boats are being battered to pieces on the rocks and sands, and many lives are being swallowed up or dashed out; while, if you turn your gaze further out to sea, you will descry other ships and boats and victims hurrying onward to their doom.  Here, a stately barque, with disordered topsails almost bursting from the yards as she hurries her hapless crew--all ignorant, perchance, of its proximity--towards the dread lee-shore.  Elsewhere, looming through the murk, a ponderous merchantman, her mainmast and mizzen gone, and just enough of the foremast left to support the bellying foresail that bears her to destruction.  Think you, reader, that this sketch is exaggerated?  If so, let us descend from our lofty outlook, and take a nearer view of facts in detail.  I quote the substance of the following from a newspaper article published some years ago.  The violence of the storm on Wednesday and Thursday night was terrific. The damage to shipping has been fearful.  On sea the tremendous gale proved disastrous beyond precedent.  Falmouth Harbour was the scene of several collisions, and one barque and a tug steamer sank at their anchors.  A wreck is reported at Lelant, to which the Penzance lifeboat with a stout-hearted crew had started, when our despatch left, to rescue thirteen men who could be descried hanging in the shrouds.  A fine new ship is on Hayle bar, and another vessel is believed to be wrecked there also.  Doubtless we have not yet heard of all the wrecks on the Cornish coast; but it is in the magnificent bay which includes Torquay, Paignton, and Brixham that the most terrible havoc has occurred.  On Wednesday, about sixty sail were anchored in Torbay.  Eleven have gone ashore at Broadsands, five of which are total wrecks.  The names of those we could ascertain were the Fortitude, of Exeter; the Stately, of Newcastle; the Dorset, of Falmouth, and a French brigantine.  At five o'clock on Thursday evening some of the crews were being drawn ashore by lines and baskets.  At Churston Cove one schooner is ashore and a total wreck; there is also another, the Blue Jacket, which may yet be saved. At Brixham there are two fine ships ashore inside the breakwater.  At the back of the pier ten vessels have been pounded to matchwood, and all that remains are a shattered barque, her masts still standing, two brigs, and a schooner, all inextricably mingled together.  Twelve trawlers have been sunk and destroyed.  Out of the sixty ships at anchor on Wednesday night there were not more than ten left on Thursday afternoon.  Many of these are disabled, some dismasted.  A fishing-boat belonging to Brixham was upset in the outer harbour about eight o'clock, and two married fishermen of the town and a boy were drowned.  At Elbury a new brig, the Zouave, of Plymouth, has gone to pieces, and six out of her crew of ten are drowned.  Eleven other vessels are on shore at Elbury, many of the men belonging to which cannot be accounted for.  One noble woman, named Wheaton, wife of a master mariner, saved two lives by throwing a rope from the window of her house, which is built on the rocks overhanging the bay at Furzeham Hill.  Scores of poor shipwrecked men are wandering distractedly about Brixham and Churston, the greater part of them having lost all they possessed.  The total loss of life arising from these disasters is variously estimated at from seventy to a hundred.  Is not this a tremendous account of the doings of one gale?  And let it be observed that we have lifted only one corner of the curtain and revealed the battlefield of only one small portion of our far-reaching coasts.  What is to be said of the other parts of our shores during that same wild storm?  It would take volumes instead of chapters to give the thrilling incidents of disaster and heroism in full detail.  To convey the truth in all its force is impossible, but a glimmering of it may be obtained by a glance at the Wreck Chart which is published by the Board of Trade every year.  Every black spot on that chart represents a wreck more or less disastrous, which occurred in the twelve months.  It is an appalling fact that about two thousand ships, upwards of seven hundred lives, and nearly two millions sterling, are lost _every_ year on the shores of the United Kingdom.  Some years the loss is heavier, sometimes lighter, but in round numbers this is our annual loss in the great war."]]]
