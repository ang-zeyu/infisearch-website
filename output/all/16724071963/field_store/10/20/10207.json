Not content with this, he sought and obtained permission to carry the axe in his belt.  Of course, none of the bolts or arrows had metal points; but that mattered little, as the wood of which they were made was very hard, and could be sharpened to a fine point; and, being feathered, the missiles flew straight to the mark when pointed in the right direction.  \"Now, captain,\" said Paul, on the morning they set out, \"let's see what you can do with your cross-bow at the first bird you meet.  I mean the first eatable bird; for I have no heart to kill the little twitterers around us for the mere sake of practice.\"  \"That will I right gladly,\" said Trench, fixing his bow and string, and inserting a bolt with a confident air.  \"And there's a chance, daddy!  See! a bird that seems to wish to be shot, it sits so quietly on the tree.\"  The seaman raised his weapon slowly to his shoulder, shut the wrong eye, glared at the bird with the other, took a long unsteady aim, and sent his bolt high over the creature's head, as well as very much to one side.  \"Might have been worse!\" said the captain.  \"Might have been better,\" returned Paul, with equal truth.  \"Now it's my turn.\"  The bird, all ignorant of the fate intended for it, sat still, apparently in surprise.  Paul drew his cloth-yard shaft to his ear and let fly.  It went apparently in search of the captain's bolt.  \"Now me!\" cried the impatient Olly, in a hoarse whisper, as he placed a stone in the sling and whirled it round his head.  His companions drew off!  There was a \"burring\" noise as the stone sped on its mission and struck the tree-stem with a sounding crack, three yards from the bird, which, learning wisdom from experience, at last took wing.  In anticipation of their chance coming round again, both Paul and the captain had got ready their artillery, and Oliver hastily put another stone in his sling.  A look and exclamation of disappointment were given by each as the bird vanished, but just at that moment a large rabbit darted across their path.  Whiz! twang! burr! went bolt and bow and stone, and that rabbit, pierced in head and heart, and smitten on flank, fell to rise no more.  \"Strange!\" said Trench, in open-mouthed surprise, \"I've often heard of coincidences, but I never did see or hear of the like of that.\"  \"All three to hit it at once!\" exclaimed Paul.  \"Ay, and all three of us doin' our best to hit it, too,\" exclaimed Oliver.  \"Just so--that's the puzzle, lad,\" rejoined the captain.  \"If we had been tryin' to hit something else now, there would have been nothing strange about it!  But to hit what we all aimed at--\"  Apparently the captain failed to find words adequately to express his ideas, for he did not finish the sentence; meanwhile Paul picked up the rabbit and attached it to his belt.  After this, advancing through the woods in a north-westerly direction, they made for a somewhat elevated ridge, hoping to obtain from that point a more extended view of the land.  Towards noon, feeling hungry, they began to look out for a suitable spot whereon to lunch, or rather to dine; for while travelling on foot in wild countries men usually find it convenient to take a very substantial meal about, or soon after, noon.  \"To have water handy,\" remarked Paul, as they stopped to look round, \"is essential to comfort as well as cookery.\"  \"Look there, away to the nor'-west o' that bunch o' trees,\" said the captain, pointing to a distant spot, \"there's a depression in the ground there; and from the lie o' the land all round I should say we shall find a stream o' some sort near it.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Oliver; \"for I shall want water to wash the rabbit with, and I have a strong hope that we may find fish in the rivers of this land, and although my hooks are big, I think the fish may not be particular, seein' that they have never before been tempted in that way.\"  \"That's true, Olly; I hope you won't be disappointed.  But what makes you want to wash the rabbit, my boy?\" asked the captain; \"it is not dirty?\"  \"Perhaps not; but I don't quite relish the dirty work of cleaning out a rabbit before cooking it, so I want to try the plan of cutting it open, holding it under water, and scraping out the inside while in that position.\"  \"My son, you won't be so particular when you've been a few weeks huntin' in the wild woods.  But what about the hair?\"  \"Oh, we can singe that off, daddy.\"  \"What! singe off wet hair?  And the skin--I doubt we might find that tough?\"  The young cook--for such he became to the exploring expedition--looked puzzled.  \"I never skinned a rabbit,\" he said, \"but no doubt it is easy enough. I'll just cut it open at the head--or tail--and pull it off like a glove.\"  \"Not quite so easily done as that\" remarked Paul, with a laugh; \"but I happen to know something about skinning birds and beasts, Olly, so make your mind easy.  I will show you how to do it.\"  \"You happen to know something about almost everything, I think,\" said the captain.  \"Tell me now, d'ye happen to know what sort o' beast it is that I see starin' at us over the bushes yonder?\"  \"No, Master Trench, I do not; but it looks marvellously like a deer of some sort,\" said Paul, as he hastily fitted an arrow to his bow.  But before he could discharge it the animal wisely retired into the shelter of its native wilds.  By this time, having walked smartly, they had gained the crest of one of the lower ridges, or plateaus, that rose in gentle slopes from the rocky shore, and there, as had been anticipated, they found a small rivulet, such as Americans would call a creek, and Scotsmen a burn.  It flowed in a north-easterly direction, and was broken by several small rapids and cascades.  With a little shout of satisfaction, Oliver ran down to its banks, getting his hooks out as he went.  Arriving at the margin of a deep pool, he bent over it and gazed earnestly down.  The water was as clear as crystal, showing every stone at the bottom as if it had been covered merely with a sheet of glass, and there, apparently undisturbed by the intruder, lay several large fish.  What they were he knew not--cared not.  Sufficient for him that they seemed large and fat.  His first impulse was to turn and shout the discovery to his companions; but seeing that they had already set to work to cut firewood a little higher up the stream, he checked himself.  \"I'll catch a fish first maybe,\" he muttered, as he quickly adjusted to his piece of cord one of the smallest cod-hooks he possessed.  A few minutes sufficed for this; but when he was ready, it occurred to him that he had no bait.  He looked around him, but nothing suitable was to be seen, and he was about to attempt the all but hopeless task of tearing up the soil with his fingers in search of a worm, when his eyes fell on a small bright feather that had been dropped by some passing bird.  \"Happy thoughts\" occurred to people in the days of which we write, even as now, though they were not recognised or classified as such.  Fly-fishing was instantly suggested to the eager boy.  He had often tried it in Old England; why not try it in Newfoundland?  A very brief period sufficed to unwind a thread from the cord, and therewith to attach the feather to the hook.  He had no rod, and neither time nor patience to make one.  Gathering the cord into a coil, such as wharfmen form when casting ropes to steamers; he swung it round his head, and hove his hook half-way across the glassy pool.  The fish looked up at him, apparently in calm surprise--certainly without alarm.  Then Olly began to haul in the hook.  It was a fearful fly to look at, such as had never desecrated those waters since the days of Adam, yet those covetous fish rushed at it in a body.  The biggest caught it, and found himself caught!  The boy held on tenderly, while the fish in wild amazement darted from side to side, or sprang high into the air.  Oliver was far too experienced a fisher not to know that the captive might be but slightly hooked, so he played it skilfully, casting a sidelong glance now and then at his busy comrades in the hope that they had not observed him.  At last the fish became tired, and the fisher drew it slowly to the bank--a four- or five-pound trout at the very least!  Unfortunately the bank was steep, and the boy found, to his distress, that the hook had only caught hold slightly of the fish's lip.  To lift out the heavy creature with the line was therefore impossible, to catch hold of it with the hand was almost equally so; for when he lay down and stretched out his arm as far as possible, he could scarcely touch it with the end of his finger.  \"If it makes another dash it'll escape,\" muttered the anxious boy, as he slid further and further down the bank--a hairbreadth at a time.  Just then the fish showed symptoms of revival.  Olly could stand this no longer.  He made a desperate grasp and caught it by the gills just as the hook came away.  The act destroyed what little balance he had retained, and he went with a sharp short yell into the pool.  Paul looked up in time to see his friend's legs disappear.  He ran to the spot in considerable alarm, supposing that the boy might have taken a fit, and not knowing whether he could swim.  He was relieved, however, to find that Olly, on reappearing, struck out manfully with one hand for a shallow place at the lower end of the pool, while with the other he pressed some object tightly to his bosom.  \"You don't mean to say,\" exclaimed Paul, as he assisted his friend out of the water, \"that you went in for that splendid trout and caught it with your hands!\"  \"You saw me dive,\" replied the boy, throwing the fish down with affected indifference, and stooping to wring the water from his garments as well as to hide his face; \"and you don't suppose, surely, that I caught it with my feet.  Come, look at the depth I had to go down to catch him!\"  Seizing his prize, Olly led his friend to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21711"],["title","The World of Ice (#0)"],["body","WORLD OF ICE, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  SOME OF THE dramatis personae INTRODUCED--RETROSPECTIVE GLANCES--CAUSES OF FUTURE EFFECTS--OUR HERO'S EARLY LIFE AT SEA--A PIRATE--A TERRIBLE FIGHT AND ITS CONSEQUENCES--BUZZBY'S HELM LASHED AMIDSHIPS--A WHALING CRUISE BEGUN.  Nobody ever caught John Buzzby asleep by any chance whatever.  No weasel was ever half so sensitive on that point as he was.  Wherever he happened to be (and in the course of his adventurous life he had been to nearly all parts of the known world) he was the first awake in the morning and the last asleep at night; he always answered promptly to the first call, and was never known by any man living to have been seen with his eyes shut, except when he winked, and that operation he performed less frequently than other men.  John Buzzby was an old salt--a regular true-blue jack tar of the old school, who had been born and bred at sea; had visited foreign parts innumerable; had weathered more storms than he could count, and had witnessed more strange sights than he could remember.  He was tough, and sturdy, and grizzled, and broad, and square, and massive--a first-rate specimen of a John Bull, and, according to himself, \"always kept his weather-eye open.\"  This remark of his was apt to create confusion in the minds of his hearers, for John meant the expression to be understood figuratively, while, in point of fact, he almost always kept one of his literal eyes open and the other partially closed, but as he reversed the order of arrangement frequently, he might have been said to keep his lee-eye as much open as the weather one.  This peculiarity gave to his countenance an expression of earnest thoughtfulness mingled with humour. Buzzby was fond of being thought old, and he looked much older than he really was.  Men guessed his age at fifty-five, but they were ten years out in their reckoning, for John had numbered only forty-five summers, and was as tough and muscular as ever he had been--although not quite so elastic.  John Buzzby stood on the pier of the seaport town of Grayton watching the active operations of the crew of a whaling ship which was on the point of starting for the icebound seas of the frozen regions, and making sundry remarks to a stout, fair-haired boy of fifteen, who stood by his side gazing at the ship with an expression of deep sadness.  \"She's a trim-built craft and a good sea-boat, I'll be bound, Master Fred,\" observed the sailor, \"but she's too small by half, accordin' to my notions, and I _have_ seen a few whalers in my day.  Them bow-timbers, too, are scarce thick enough for goin' bump agin the ice o' Davis Straits.  Howsome'iver, I've seen worse craft drivin' a good trade in the Polar Seas.\"  \"She's a first-rate craft in all respects, and you have too high an opinion of your own judgment,\" replied the youth indignantly.  \"Do you suppose that my father, who is an older man than yourself, and as good a sailor, would buy a ship, and fit her out, and go off to the whale-fishery in her if he did not think her a good one?\"  \"Ah!  Master Fred, you're a chip of the old block--neck or nothing-- carry on all sail till you tear the masts out of her!  Reef the t'gallant sails of your temper, boy, and don't run foul of an old man who has been all but a wet-nurse to ye--taught ye to walk, and swim, and pull an oar, and build ships, and has hauled ye out o' the sea when ye fell in--from the time ye could barely stump along on two legs, lookin' like as if ye was more nor half seas over.\"  \"Well, Buzzby,\" replied the boy, laughing, \"if you've been all that to me, I think you _have_ been a wet-nurse too!  But why do you run down my father's ship?  Do you think I'm going to stand that?  No, not even from you, old boy.\"  \"Hallo! youngster,\" shouted a voice from the deck of the vessel in question, \"run up and tell your father we're all ready, and if he don't make haste he'll lose the tide, so he will, and that'll make us have to start on a Friday, it will, an' that'll not do for me no how, it won't; so make sail and look sharp about it, do--won't you?\"  \"What a tongue he's got,\" remarked Buzzby.  \"Before I'd go to sea with a first mate who jawed like that I'd be a landsman.  Don't ever you git to talk too much, Master Fred, wotever ye do.  My maxim is--and it has served me through life, uncommon,--`Keep your weather-eye open and your tongue housed 'xcept when you've got occasion to use it.'  If that fellow'd use his eyes more and his tongue less he'd see your father comin' down the road there, right before the wind; with his old sister in tow.\"  \"How I wish he would have let me go with him!\" muttered Fred to himself sorrowfully.  \"No chance now, I'm a-feared,\" remarked his companion.  \"The gov'nor's as stiff as a nor'wester.  Nothin' in the world can turn him once he's made up his mind, but a regular sou'easter.  Now, if you had been _my_ son, and yonder tight craft _my_ ship, I would have said, come, at once. But your father knows best, lad, and you're a wise son to obey orders cheerfully, without question.  That's another o' my maxims: `Obey orders an' ax no questions.'\"  Frederick Ellice, senior, who now approached, whispering words of consolation into the ear of his weeping sister, might, perhaps, have just numbered fifty years.  He was a fine, big, bold, hearty Englishman, with a bald head, grizzled locks, a loud but not harsh voice, a rather quick temper, and a kind, earnest, enthusiastic heart.  Like Buzzby, he had spent nearly all his life at sea, and had become so thoroughly accustomed to walking on an unstable foundation, that he felt quite uncomfortable on solid ground, and never remained more than a few months at a time on shore.  He was a man of good education and gentlemanly manners, and had worked his way up in the merchant service, step by step, until he obtained the command of a West India trader.  A few years previous to the period in which our tale opens, an event occurred which altered the course of Captain Ellice's life, and for a long period plunged him into the deepest affliction.  This was the loss of his wife at sea, under peculiarly distressing circumstances.  At the age of thirty Captain Ellice had married a pretty blue-eyed girl, who resolutely refused to become a sailor's bride, unless she should be permitted to accompany her husband to sea.  This was without much difficulty agreed to, and forthwith Alice Bremner became Mrs Ellice, and went to sea.  It was during her third voyage to the West Indies that our hero, Fred, was born, and it was during this, and succeeding voyages, that Buzzby became \"all but a wet-nurse\" to him.  Mrs Ellice was a loving, gentle, seriously-minded woman.  She devoted herself, heart and soul, to the training of her boy, and spent many a pleasant hour in that little unsteady cabin, in endeavouring to instil into his infant mind the blessed truths of Christianity, and in making the name of Jesus familiar to his ear.  As Fred grew older, his mother encouraged him to hold occasional intercourse with the sailors, for her husband's example taught her the value of a bold, manly spirit, and she knew that it was impossible for her to instil _that_ into him, but she was careful to guard him from the evil that he might chance to learn from the men, by committing him to the tender care of Buzzby.  To do the men justice, however, this was almost unnecessary, for they felt that a mother's watchful eye was on the child, and no unguarded word fell from their lips while he was romping about the forecastle.  When it was time for Fred to go to school, Mrs Ellice gave up her roving life, and settled in her native town of Grayton, where she resided with her widowed sister, Amelia Bright, and her niece Isobel. Here Fred received the rudiments of an excellent education at a private academy.  At the age of twelve, however, Master Fred became restive, and, during one of his father's periodical visits home, begged to be taken to sea.  Captain Ellice agreed; Mrs Ellice insisted on accompanying them, and in a few weeks they were once again on their old home, the ocean, and Fred was enjoying his native air in company with his friend Buzzby, who stuck to the old ship like one of her own stout timbers.  But this was destined to be a disastrous voyage.  One evening, after crossing the line, they descried a suspicious-looking schooner to windward, bearing down upon them under a cloud of canvas.  \"What do you think of her, Buzzby?\" enquired Captain Ellice, handing his glass to the seaman.  Buzzby gazed in silence and with compressed lips for some time; then he returned the glass, at the same time muttering the word: \"Pirate.\"  \"I thought so,\" said the captain in a deep, unsteady voice.  \"There is but one course for us, Buzzby,\" he continued, glancing towards his wife, who, all unconscious of their danger, sat near the taffrail, employed with her needle; \"these fellows show no mercy, because they expect none, either from God or man.  We must fight to the last.  Go, prepare the men and get out the arms.  I'll tell my wife.\"  Buzzby went forward, but the captain's heart failed him, and he took two or three rapid, hesitating turns on the quarter-deck ere he could make up his mind to speak.  \"Alice,\" he said at length abruptly, \"yonder vessel is a pirate.\"  Mrs Ellice looked up in surprise, and her face grew pale as her eye met the troubled gaze of her husband.  \"Are you quite sure, Frederick?\"  \"Yes, quite.  Would God that I were left alone to--but--nay, do not be alarmed; perhaps I am wrong; it may be a--a clipper-built trading vessel.  If not, Alice, we must make some show of fighting, and try to frighten them.  Meanwhile you must go below.\"  The captain spoke encouragingly as he led his wife to the cabin, but his candid countenance spoke too truthfully, and she felt that his look of anxious concern bade her fear the worst.  Pressing her fervently to his heart, Captain Ellice sprang on deck.  By this time the"]]]
