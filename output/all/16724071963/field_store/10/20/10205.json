Big Swinton, still smarting under the bruises and bites he had received in the scuffle, dragged them forward, and demanded angrily what was to be done to them.  \"What have they done?\" asked Trench.  \"Done!--why, they have kicked and bitten like wildcats, and I doubt not have come over here to see what they can steal.  In my opinion a thief deserves keel-hauling at the very least.\"  Master Trench's mouth expanded into a very broad smile as he looked round the group of men.  \"D'ye hear that, lads, what _Master_ Swinton thinks ought to be done to _thieves_?\"  The men broke into a loud laugh, for even the most obtuse among them could not fail to perceive the humour of the skipper's look and question.  \"You have nothing more to do wi' the matter, Trench, than any one else has,\" returned Swinton.  \"I claim these lads as my prisoners, and I'll do with them what I please.  No man is master now.  Might is right on this island!\"  The words had scarcely been uttered when Big Swinton felt his right shoulder grasped as if in a vice, and next moment he was flung violently to the ground, while Paul Burns stood over him with a huge piece of wood in his hand, and a half-stern, half-smiling look on his countenance.  The men were taken completely by surprise, for Paul had, up to this time, shown such a gentle unwarlike spirit that the crew had come to regard him as \"a soft lump of a fellow.\"  \"Big Swinton,\" he said, in the mildest of voices, \"as you have laid down the law that `might is right,' you cannot, of course, object to my acting on it.  In virtue of that law, I claim these prisoners as mine, so you may get up and go about your business.  You see, lads,\" he added, turning to the men, while Swinton rose and retired, \"though I have no wish to domineer over you or to usurp authority.  I have a right to claim that my voice shall be heard and my reasons weighed.  As Swinton truly remarked, no man is master now, but as he followed this remark by making _himself_ master, and laying down a law for us, I thought it might be complimentary to him just to act, for once, under his law, and show him how well it works!  Now, let me have a word with you.  \"It is evident that the land over there is peopled with savages who, probably, never saw white men before.  If we treat these young fellows kindly, and send them away with gifts in their hands, we shall, no doubt, make friends of the savages.  If we treat them ill, or kill them, their relations will come over, mayhap in swarms, and drive us into the sea.  I drop the Swinton law of might being right, and ask you who are now the law-makers--which is it to be--kindness or cruelty?\"  \"Kindness!\" shouted by far the greater number of the audience, for even bad men are ready enough to see and admit the beauty of truth and justice when they are not themselves unpleasantly affected by these principles.  The decision being thus made, Paul took the arm of one of the young Indians and led him gently towards his fire, while the men scattered to their several camps.  Master Trench led the other youth in the same kindly way, and little Oliver, motioning to them to sit down, set before them two platters of pork and pancakes.  This he did with such a benignant smile that the poor youths were obviously relieved from the dread of immediate and personal violence.  After some glances of timid uncertainty they began to eat.  \"That's right,\" said Oliver, patting the bigger of the two on the shoulder, \"you'll find the victuals pretty good, though you're not much used to 'em, mayhap.\"  Of course the youths did not understand the words, but they understood and fully appreciated the feeling with which they were expressed.  They also appreciated most powerfully the viands.  At first they were greatly perplexed by the offer of knives and forks; but, after looking at these implements gravely for a few moments, they laid them gently down, and went to work in the natural way with fingers and teeth.  After they had finished the food, and licked the platters clean, they were presented with several bright brass buttons, an old clasp-knife, a comb, and a kerchief or two, with which inestimable gifts they embarked in their canoe, and returned to the opposite shore.  That day a most important discovery was made among the wreckage, namely, a case containing fish-hooks of various sizes and a number of lines. With these, and the boat repaired, Master Trench saw his way to prolonged existence on the island.  \"To tell ye the plain truth,\" he remarked to Little Stubbs, with whom he fell in while searching on the shore, \"before this case of tackle was found, I had no hope at all of surviving here, for a few barrels of pork and flour could not last long among so many, and our end would have bin something awful; but now, with God's blessing, we may do well enough until we have time to think and plan for our escape.\"  \"But d'ye think, master,\" said Stubbs, \"that we shall find fish in them waters?\"  \"Find 'em!  Ay, I make no doubt o' that, but we shall soon put it to the test, for the boat will be ready by to-morrow or next day at furthest, and then we shall see what the fish hereabouts think o' salt pork.  If they take to it as kindly as the Indians did, we shall soon have grub enough and to spare.\"  The natural tendency of man to bow to the best leader was shown immediately after the incident of the capture of the Indians, for Paul Burns was thence-forward quietly appealed to by most of the crew in all circumstances which required much consideration.  Paul, being a law-respecting man, naturally turned to the skipper, whose decision was usually final, and thus Master Trench dropped, by general consent, into his old position of commander.  But it must not be supposed that all the party acquiesced in this arrangement.  There were men among that crew--such as Swinton, Blazer, Garnet, and others--who, either from false training, bad example, or warped spirits, had come to the condition of believing that the world was made for their special behoof; that they possessed that \"divine right\" to rule which is sometimes claimed by kings, and that whoever chanced to differ from them was guilty of arrogance, and required to be put down!  These men were not only bad, like most of the others, but revengeful and resolute.  They submitted, in the meantime, to the \"might\" of Paul Burns, backed as he was by numbers, but they nursed their wrath to keep it warm, and, under the leadership of Big Swinton, plotted the downfall of their rivals.  Meanwhile, being unquestionably \"in power,\" Master Trench, Paul, Oliver, Grummidge, Stubbs, and several of the well-affected, took possession of the boat when ready, and, inviting Swinton to join them--as a stroke of policy--pushed off, with hooks and lines, to make the first essay in the way of fishing on the now famous Banks of Newfoundland.  Anchoring the boat in what they deemed a suitable spot, they went to work.  \"I wonder if they'll take to pork,\" remarked Stubbs, as he baited a large hook.  \"If they take to it as you do, we shall soon run short o' that article,\" said Swinton, dropping his hook into the water.  \"I have brought off some shellfish,\" remarked Master Trench.  \"They may prefer that.\"  \"So have I, father,\" said Oliver, whose bait was already at the bottom, \"and if--hallo! hold on! hi!  Oh!  I say!\"  While the boy was thus ejaculating, in a state of blazing excitement, his arms, and indeed his body, to say nothing of his spirit, were being jerked violently by his line in a way that suggested something awful at the other end!  \"Have a care, Olly!\"  \"Gently, lad!\"  \"Hold on, boy!\"  \"Let 'im run!\" were among the contradictory pieces of advice given in various tones of warning, remonstrance, or simple recommendation; but Oliver heeded them not.  Acting on his own judgment he drew his fish, or whatever it might be, gradually and carefully from the deep.  \"A mermaid it must be, to tug so hard,\" muttered Stubbs, as he and the others looked on with eager interest.  \"A mer_man_ if it's anything,\" said Squill; \"sure there was never a maid in the say, or out of it, as would tug like that.\"  \"That depends,\" said Grummidge.  \"I've had 'em tuggin' at my heart-strings worse than that many a time.\"  \"Look out!  Here it comes,\" cried Oliver, as something huge and white was seen to flash wildly in the green depths.  \"Have the cleek ready.\"  \"All ready, my boy,\" said his father, in a low voice, leaning over the side with a stick, at the end of which was a large iron hook.  \"Now then, father!  Quick!  Missed it?  No!  Hurrah!\"  For a moment it seemed as if Master Trench had got Neptune himself on his cleek, so severely did his stout frame quiver.  Then he gave a tremendous heave--\"ya-hoy!\" and up came a magnificent cod--the first of a grand hecatomb of cod-fish which have since that day enriched the world, nauseated the sick with \"liver oil,\" and placed Newfoundland among the most important islands of the British Empire.  \"Well done, Olly!\" exclaimed the delighted father; but he had barely time to open his mouth for the next remark, when Squill uttered an Irish yell, and was seen holding on to his line with desperate resolve stamped on every feature.  \"That's the merman this time,\" cried Stubbs.  \"His gran'mother, no less,\" muttered Squill, in a strongly suppressed voice, while he anxiously hauled in the line.  A shout from the other side of the boat here diverted attention.  \"Attacked front and rear!\" cried Paul, with a hilarious laugh, \"I shouldn't wonder if--hallo!  N-no, it was only a nib--ha! there he is!\"  And, truly, there he was in a few minutes, another splendid cod in the bottom of the boat.  To make a long story short, the boat was nearly filled with cod before the sun set, and that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21710"],["title","The Crew of the Water Wagtail (#5)"],["body","was spent in general rejoicing and feasting on fish--with a second course of pork and pancakes for those who were insatiable.  But the state of contentment did not last long.  The very next day there was quarrelling as to who should go in the boat.  To allay the contention, Trench and Paul volunteered to stay in camp and help the party that should be left to split and clean the fish, and erect tents and booths.  Again the fishing was successful, but dissensions about the use of the boat soon became more violent than ever.  Of course, in all this Master Trench and his friend Paul took a prominent part in trying to smooth matters, to the intense jealousy of Big Swinton and his sympathisers.  In short, the camp ere long was divided into two hostile bands--the moderately bad and the immoderately wicked, if we may so put it.  The first, who were few in number, sided with Trench and his friends; the second declared for Swinton.  But the resolute bearing of Paul and the skipper, and the fact that the whole party was destitute of weapons (except clubs cut out of the bush, and a few clasp-knives), kept the larger and more vicious party in check.  Swinton and his friends, therefore, had recourse to secret plotting; but, plot as they would, they had not sufficient brain-power among them to devise a method by which to free themselves of the men they envied.  At last circumstances favoured them.  It was found necessary to send men to the other side of the island to cut and fetch over some small trees that grew there, in order to make stages on which to dry their fish.  As the operation would require part of two days, it was proposed to spend the night there.  Swinton was to command the party, and Master Trench said, jestingly, that he and Master Burns, with Olly, would stay to guard the camp!  The wood-cutting party was to start early the next day.  Then a plan of revenge flashed into Big Swinton's mind.  That night he revealed it to those of his friends whom he could trust, and who were necessary to his purpose.  The night following--while the men around them should be sleeping at the other side of the island, and their enemies were alone in the camp--was fixed on for the execution of their purpose.    CHAPTER FIVE.  TURNED ADRIFT IN A FOREIGN LAND.  It was a calm but very dark night when Swinton, Blazer, Garnet, Heron, Taylor, and several other men of kindred spirit, rose from their couches at the further end of the island, and, stealthily quitting the place, hastened back to their original camp.  They reached it about midnight, and, as they had expected, found all quiet, for the so-called \"guard\" of the camp had been hard at work all day and were at that moment fast asleep.  Paul and the captain, with Oliver, lay side by side under a tent which they had constructed out of broken spars and a piece of sailcloth.  Their foes drew together not far from the spot.  \"Now, men,\" said Swinton, \"this is a tough job we have in hand, for they are strong men, and the boy, albeit not big, is a very tiger-cat to fight.  You see, if our plan was murder we could easily settle their business while they slept but that's not our plan.  We are _not_ murderers--by no means!\"  \"Certainly not,\" growled Blazer, with virtuous solemnity.  \"Well, that bein' so, we must take them alive.  I will creep into the tent with you, Jim Heron, for you're big and strong enough.  You will fall on Trench and hold 'im down.  I'll do the same to Burns.  Garnet will manage the boy.  The moment the rest of you hear the row begin, you will jump in and lend a hand wi' the ropes.  After we've got 'em all safe into the boat, we will pull to the big island--land them there, an' bid them a tender farewell!\"  \"But surely you won't land them without a morsel to eat?\" said Taylor.  \"Why not?  They're sure to fall in wi' their _dear_ friends the savages, who will, doubtless, be very grateful to 'em, an' supply grub gratis! Now, lads, you understand what you've got to do?\"  \"Ay, ay,\" was the response, in a low tone, as they moved cautiously away, like evil spirits, to carry out their wicked plans.  \"Fortune,\" it is said, \"favours the brave,\" but in this case she did not thus bestow her favours, for the cowardly plan was successfully carried out.  Before the sleepers were well awake, they were overwhelmed by numbers, secured and bound.  They were not gagged, however, as no one was near to hear even if they shouted their loudest, which they knew it was useless to do.  In a few minutes the three prisoners were hurried into the boat and rowed across the wide channel that separated the islet from the opposite shore.  At that time it was not supposed, either by the original discoverers or those who immediately followed them, that Newfoundland was one large island--considerably larger than Ireland.  Not till many a year afterwards did explorers ascertain that it was an island of about three hundred and seventeen miles in length, by about the same in breadth; but so cut up by deep bays, inlets, and fords as to have much the appearance of a group of islands.  During their passage across the channel both Trench and Paul attempted to reason with Swinton, but that hardened villain refused to utter a word till their prisoners were marched up the shingly beach, and told to sit down on a ledge of rock under the steep cliffs, where innumerable sea-birds were screaming a clamorous welcome, or, perchance, a noisy remonstrance.  \"Now, my friends,\" said their foe, \"as you are fond of commanding, you may take command o' them there sea-birds--they won't object!--and if ye fall in wi' your friends the savages, you may give them my love an' good wishes.\"  \"But surely you don't mean to leave us here without food, and with our hands tied behind us?\" fiercely exclaimed Master Trench, whose wrath at any thing like injustice was always prone to get the better of his wisdom.  \"As to grub,\" answered Swinton, \"there's plenty of that around, if you only exert yourself to find it.  I won't cut your lashin's, however, till we are fairly in the boat, for we can't trust you.  Come along, lads; and, Garnet, you bring the boy with ye.\"  Under the impression that he was to be separated from his father and friend, and taken back again to the islet, poor Oliver, whom they had not thought it worth while to bind, struggled with a ferocity that would have done credit to the wildcats with which he had been compared; but Garnet was a strong man, and held him fast.  \"Take it easy, my boy,\" said Paul, who, being helpless, could only look on with intense pity.  \"Submit to God's will--we will pray for you.\"  But Olly's spirit could by no means reach the submitting point until he was fairly exhausted.  While they dragged him towards the boat, Taylor turned back and flung a small canvas bag at the captain's feet.  \"There, Master Trench,\" he said, \"you'll find a lump o' pork in that bag to keep you goin' till ye get hold o' somethin' else.  An' don't take on about the boy.  _We_ don't want 'im, bless you.  Why, we only want to prevent him settin' you free before we gets fairly away.\"  This was true.  When the boat was reached and the men were on board, ready to shove off, Garnet, still holding Olly fast by the arm, said, \"Keep still, will you, and hear what Master Swinton has got to say?\"  \"Now, you fiery polecat,\" said Swinton, \"you may go and cut their lashin's, and take _that_ as a parting gift.\"  The gift was a sounding box on the ear; but Olly minded it not, for while Garnet was speaking, as he stood knee-deep in the water close to the boat, he had observed an axe lying on one of the thwarts near to him.  The instant he was set free, therefore, he seized the axe, and, flourishing it close past Garnet's nose, with a cheer of defiance he sprang towards the beach.  Garnet leaped after him, but he was no match for the agile boy, who in another minute had severed Paul's bonds and placed the weapon in his hands.  \"Hallo! hi, you've forgot _me_.  Cut my--ho!\"  But there was no occasion for Master Trench to cry out and struggle with the cords that bound him.  A furious rush of Paul with the axe caused Garnet to double with the neatness of a hunted hare.  He bounded into the boat which was immediately shoved off, and the sailors rowed away, leaving Paul to return and liberate the captain at leisure.  Silently the trio stood and watched the receding boat, until it was lost in the darkness of the night.  Then they looked at each other solemnly. Their case was certainly a grave one.  \"Cast away on an unknown shore,\" murmured the captain, in a low tone; as if he communed with his own spirit rather than with his companions, \"without food, without a ship or boat--without hope!\"  \"Nay, Master Trench,\" said Paul, \"not without hope; for `God is our refuge and our strength, a very present help in trouble,' so says His own Word, as my mother has often read to me.\"  \"It is well for you, Paul,\" returned the captain, \"that you can find comfort in such words--I can find none.  Stern realities and facts are too strong for me.  How can I take comfort in unfulfilled promises? Here we are in trouble enough, surely.  In what sense is God a `refuge' to us--or `strength,' or a `present help'?  Why, we are left absolutely destitute here, without so much as a bite of food to keep our bodies and souls together.\"  He spoke with some bitterness, for he was still chafing under the sense of the wrong which he had suffered at the hands of men to whom he had been invariably kind and forbearing.  As he turned from Paul with a gesture of impatience his foot struck against the canvas bag of pork which the man Taylor had flung to him on leaving, and which had been forgotten.  He stopped suddenly and gazed at it; so did Paul.  \"Looks like as if God had already helped us--at least to food--does it not?\" said the latter.  \"It was Taylor helped us to that,\" objected Trench.  \"And who put it into Taylor's heart to help us?\" asked Paul.  \"He is one of the worst"]]]
