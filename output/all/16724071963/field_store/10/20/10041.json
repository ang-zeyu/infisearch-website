CHAPTER I.  HO, FOR CALIFORNIA.   One beautiful misummer night in 18-- a large, heavily laden steamer was making her way swiftly up the Pacific coast, in the direction of San Francisco. She was opposite the California shore, only a day's sail distant from the City of the Golden Gate, and many of the passengers had already begun making preparations for landing, even though a whole night and the better part of a day was to intervene ere they could expect to set their feet upon solid land.  She was one of those magnificent steamers that ply regularly between Panama and California. She had rather more than her full cargo of freight and passengers; but, among the hundreds of the latter, we have to do with but three.  On this moonlight night, there were gathered by themselves these three personages, consisting of Tim O'Rooney, Elwood Brandon and Howard Lawrence. The first was a burly, good-natured Irishman, and the two latter were cousins, their ages differing by less than a month, and both being in their sixteenth year.  The financial storm that swept over the country in 18--, toppling down merchants and banking-houses like so many ten-pins, carried with it in the general wreck and ruin, that of Brandon, Herman & Co., and the senior partner, Sylvanus Brandon, returned to his home in Brooklyn, New York, one evening worse than penniless. While he was meditating, dejected and gloomy, as to the means by which he was to keep the wolf from the door, his clerk brought him a letter which had been overlooked in the afternoon's mail, postmarked, \"San Francisco, Cal.\" At once he recognized the bold, handsome superscription as that of his kind-hearted brother-in-law, Thomas Lawrence. His heart beat with a strong hope as he broke the envelope, and his eyes glistened ere he had read one-half.  In short, it stated that Mr. Lawrence had established himself successfully in business, and was doing so well that he felt the imperative need of a partner, and ended by urging Mr. Brandon to accept the position. The bankrupt merchant laid the epistle in his lap, removed his spectacles and looked smilingly toward his wife. They held a long discussion, and both decided to accept the offer at once, as there was no other recourse left to them.  It was evident from the letter that Mr. Lawrence had some apprehensions regarding Mr. Brandon's ability to weather the storm, but he could not be aware of his financial crash, as it had only become known on the street within the last twenty-four hours. Mr. Brandon deemed it proper, therefore, before closing with the offer, to acquaint his brother-in-law with his circumstances, that he might fully understand the disadvantage under which he would be placed by the new partnership.  The letter was written and duly posted, and our friends rather anxiously awaited the answer. It came in the gratifying form of a draft for $1,000 to defray \"his necessary expenses,\" and an urgent entreaty to start without delay.  The advice was acted upon, and within two weeks of the reception of the second letter, Mr. Brandon and his wife were on board the steamer at New York, with their state-rooms engaged for California. They had but one child, Elwood, whom they had placed at a private school where he was to prepare himself for college, in company with his cousin, Howard Lawrence, who had been sent from California by his father and had entered the school at the same time.  Mr. Brandon learned that Mr. Lawrence was a brother indeed. The position in which the two men were placed proved so favorable to the former that in a few years he found himself almost as wealthy as in his palmiest days, when his name was such a power in Wall Street. He had come to like the young and growing State of California, and ere he had been there two years both himself and wife had lost all longings for the metropolis of the New World.  In the meanwhile, Elwood and Howard were doing well at their studies in Brooklyn. They had been inseparable friends from infancy, and as their years increased the bonds of affection seemed to strengthen between them. They were the only children of twin sisters, and bore a remarkable resemblance in person, character and disposition. Both had dark, curling, chestnut hair, hazel eyes, and an active muscular organization that made them leaders in boyish pastimes and sports. If there was any perceptible difference between the two, it was that Elwood Brandon was a little more daring and impetuous than his companion; he was apt to follow out his first impulses and venture upon schemes without deliberating fully enough. Both were generous, unselfish, and either would have willingly risked his life for the other.  Thus matters stood until the summer when our young heroes had completed their preparatory course, and were ready to enter college. It was decided by their parents that this should be done in the autumn, and that the summer of this year should be spent by the boys with their parents in California. They had been separated from them for five years, during which they had met but once, when the parents made a journey to New York for that purpose, spending several months with them. That visit, it may be said, was now to be returned, and the boys meant that it should be returned with interest.  And so Tim O'Rooney, a good-natured, trustworthy Irishman, who had been in the employ of Mr. Lawrence for eight years, almost ever since his arrival in America, was sent to New York to accompany the boys on their visit home.  Howard and Elwood were standing one afternoon on the corner of Montague Street, in Brooklyn, chatting with each other about their expected trip to California. They had closed their school studies a week before, and boy-like were now anxious to be off upon their journey. Suddenly an Irishman came in sight, smoking furiously at a short black pipe. The first glance showed them that it was no other than Tim O'Rooney, the expected messenger.  \"Isn't that good?\" exclaimed Elwood, \"the steamer sails on Saturday, and we'll go in it. Here he comes, as though he was in a great hurry!\"  \"Don't say anything, and see whether he will know us!\"  \"Why shouldn't he?\"  \"You know we've grown a good deal since he was here, and the beard is getting so stiff on my chin that it scratches my hand every time I touch it.\"  \"Yes; that mustache, too, is making you look as fierce as a Bluebeard; but here he is!\"  At this instant Tim O'Rooney came opposite them. He merely glanced up, puffed harder than ever and was passing on, when both burst out in a loud laugh.  \"Be the powers! what's the mather with ye spalpeens?\" he angrily demanded. \"Can't a dacent man be passing the sthrats widout being insulted----Howly mother! is it yerselves or is it your grandfathers?\"  He had recognized them, and a hearty hand-shaking followed. Tim grinned a great deal over his mistake, and answered their questions in his dry, witty way, and assured them that his instructions were to bring them home as soon as possible. Accordingly, they embarked on the steamer on the following Saturday; and, passing over the unimportant incidents of their voyage, we come back to our starting point, where all three were within a day's journey of their destination.     CHAPTER II.  FIRE.   \"To-morrow we shall be home,\" said Elwood Brandon, addressing his companion, although at the time he was looking out on the moon-lit sea, in the direction of California.  \"Yes; if nothing unexpected happens,\" replied his cousin, who was pushing and drawing a large Newfoundland dog that lay at his feet.  \"And what can happen?\" asked his cousin, turning abruptly toward him.  \"A hundred things. Suppose the boiler should blow up, we run on a rock, take fire, or get struck by a squall----\"  \"Or be carried away in a balloon,\" was the impatient exclamation. \"One is just as likely to happen as the other.\"  \"Hardly--heigh-ho!\"  Howard at that moment had twined his feet around the neck of Terror, the Newfoundland, and the mischievous dog, springing suddenly to his feet, brought his master from his seat to the deck, which, as a matter of course, made both of the cousins laugh.  \"He did that on purpose,\" said Howard, recovering his position.  \"Of course he did. You have been pestering him for the last half-hour, and he is getting tired of it; but I may say, Howard, I shall hardly be able to sleep to-night, I am so anxious to see father and mother.\"  \"So am I; a few years makes such a difference in us, while I can't detect the least change in them.\"  \"Except a few more gray hairs, or perhaps an additional wrinkle or two. What's the matter with Tim?\"  \"Tim! O nothing, he seems to be meditating and smoking. Fact is that is about all he has done since he has been with us.\"  \"It's been a grand time for Tim, and I have no doubt he has enjoyed the trip to and from California as much as either of us.\"  The subject of these remarks was seated a few feet away, his arms folded, while he was looking with a vague, dreamy expression out upon the great Pacific, stretching so many thousand miles beyond them, rolling far off in each direction, until sky and ocean blended in great gloom.  \"Maybe he is looking for Asia,\" laughed Elwood in an undertone.  \"More likely he is hoping to get a glimpse of Ireland, for he would be as likely to look in that direction as any other. I say, Tim!\"  The Irishman did not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21626"],["title","Adrift in the Wilds; Or, The Adventures of Two Shipwrecked Boys (#1)"],["body","the call until he was addressed the second time in a louder tone than before, when he suddenly raised his head.  \"Whisht! what is it?\"  \"What are you thinking about?\"  \"Nothin', I was dreaming.\"  \"Dreaming! what about?\"  \"Begorrah but that was a qua'r dream, was that same one.\"  \"Let's hear it.\"  \"But it's onplaiasnt.\"  \"Never mind, out with it.\"  \"Well, thin, if I must tell yees, I was thinking that this owld staamer was all on fire, and all of us passengers was jumping around in the wather, pulling each other down, away miles into the sea, till we was gone so long there wasn't a chance iver to git up agin.\"  A strange fear thrilled both of the boys at the mention of this, and they looked at each other a moment in silence.  \"What put that into your head, Tim?\"  \"And it's just the question I was axing meself, for I never draamed of such a thing in my life before, and it's mighty qua'r that I should take a notion to do it now.\"  \"It ain't worth talking about,\" said Elwood, showing an anxiety to change the subject.  \"Be yees going to bed to-night?\"  \"I don't feel a bit sleepy,\" replied Elwood. \"I'd just as soon sit up half the night as not.\"  \"And so would I; it must be after eleven o'clock, isn't it?\"  \"It's near 'levin,\" replied Tim. \"I'm not able to examine me watch; and if I was, I couldn't tell very well, as it hasn't run for a few months.\"  Howard took out his watch, but the moonlight was too faint for him to distinguish the hands, and the three were content to let the precise time remain a matter of conjecture.  \"Tim, how close are we to land?\" asked Elwood.  \"I should say about the same distance that the land is from us, and begorrah that's the best information I can give yees.\"  \"I could see the mountains very plainly when the sun was setting,\" said Howard, \"and it cannot be many miles away.\"  \"What sort of a country is it off here?\" pursued Elwood, pointing in the direction of the land.  \"It is wild and rocky, and there are plenty of Indians and wild animals there.\"  \"How do you know?\" asked Elwood, in some amazement.  \"I have taken the trouble to learn all about California that I could before coming.\"  \"I believe they have _gold_ there?\" said Elwood, in rather a bantering vein.  \"Tim can tell you more about that than I can, as he came to California to hunt gold.\"  \"How is that, Tim?\"  \"Begorrah, but he shpakes the truth. I wint up among the mountains to hunt gowld.\"  \"And what luck had you?\"  \"Luck, is it?\" repeated the Irishman, with an expression of ludicrous disgust. \"Luck, does ye call it, to have your head cracked and your shins smashed by the copper-skins, chawed up by the b'ars, froze to death in the mountains, drowned in the rivers--that run into the top of yer shanty when yer sound asleep--your feet gnawed off by wolverines, as they call--and--but whisht! don't talk to me of luck, and all the time ye never gets a sight of a particle of gowld.\"  The boys laughed, Howard said:  \"But your luck is not every one's, Tim; there have been plenty who have made fortunes at the business.\"  \"Yis, but they wasn't Tim O'Rooneys. He's not the man that was born to be rich!\"  \"You're better satisfied where you are.\"  \"Yis, thank God, that I've such a good home, and an ongrateful dog would I baa if I should ask more.\"  \"But, Elwood, it's getting late, and this night air begins to feel chilly. It can't be far from midnight.\"  \"I am willing; where's Terror? Ah! here he is; old fellow, come along and keep faithful watch over your friends.\"  \"Boys,\" said Tim O'Rooney, with a strange, husky intonation, \"you remember my dream about this steamer burning?\"  \"Yes; what of it?\"  \"It is coming thrue!\"  _He spoke the truth!_     CHAPTER III.  AFLOAT.   As Tim O'Rooney spoke, he pointed to the bow of the steamer, where, in the bright moonlight, some smoke could be seen rising--where, too, the next instant, they caught sight of a gleam of fire.  \"Oh, heaven! what shall we do?\" exclaimed Elwood, struck with a panic.  \"Wait and trust to Providence.\"  \"Let us jump overboard; I'd rather be drowned than burned to death. Come, Howard, let's jump over this minute!\"  He made a move toward the stern of the steamer, near which they had been seated, as if he intended to spring overboard, when his arm was sternly caught by the Irishman, who said in an indignant tone:  \"Kaap cool! kaap cool! don't make a fool of yoursilf. Can ye swim?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Howard, \"we can both swim very well. Can you?\"  \"Indaad, I can--swim like a stone.\"  \"But good heavens!\" exclaimed Elwood, who had not entirely recovered from his excitement, \"the land is miles off, and we can't swim there, not taking into account the heavy sea.\"  \"What does that mean?\"  As Howard spoke, the bow of the steamer made a sweeping bend to the right.  \"They've headed toward shore,\" said Elwood.  This snatch of conversation had occupied the shortest possible space of time. The fire had been discovered by the officials on board fully as soon as by our friends, and the men could be seen running hurriedly to and fro, all quiet and still, for they knew too well what the result would be if the alarm was communicated to the sleeping passengers. The pilot had headed the vast craft toward land, and by the furious throbbing of the engines it could be seen that the doomed vessel was straining to the utmost, like some affrighted, faithful horse striving to carry his master as nearly as possible to the port of safely ere he dropped down and died.  It was fully midnight, and, as a matter of course, very nearly all the passengers were in their berths. There were a few, however, who were lingering on the promenade deck, some smoking--here and there a couple of lovers all unconscious of everything else--one or two avaricious speculators; and but a few minutes could elapse before the startling danger should become known.  The last words, which we have given as spoken by our friends, had scarcely been said, when a man, who apparently had been stretched out sound asleep, suddenly sprung up, wild with terror. \"The boat is on fire! _fire! fire_!\"  He darted hither and thither like some wild animal compassed on every hand by death, and then suddenly made a leap overboard, and was swallowed up in the sea.  The alarm spread with fearful rapidity, and was soon ringing through every part of the steamer, and now began that fearful confusion and panic which no pen can clearly picture, and which, once seen, can never be forgotten to the dying day.  Our three friends were gathered at the stern of the steamer, earnestly and anxiously discussing the best course to pursue.  \"Let's stay here,\" said Howard, \"for every second is taking us nearer land.\"  \"That is what nearly all will do,\" said Elwood, \"but we can never reach the shore, and when the time comes we shall all be in the sea together, struggling and sinking, and we shall then be sure to go down.\"  \"Yez are right,\" said Tim, addressing the last speaker. \"Our only chance is to jump overboard this very minute, before the sea is full of the poor fellows. They'll begin to go over the ship's side and will kaap it up until the thing is burned up.\"  \"It's time then that we hunted our life-preservers,\" said Howard.  \"Git out wid yer life-presarvers!\" impatiently exclaimed Tim. \"Didn't me uncle wear one of 'em for six months, and then die with the faver! I'll heave over one of these settaas, and that'll kaap up afloat.\"  \"Be quick about it, Tim,\" urged Elwood, who was beginning to get nervous. \"See, the fire is spreading, and everybody seems to have found out what the matter is.\"  There was indeed no time to be lost. The steamer was doomed beyond all possibility of salvation, and must soon become unmanageable, when everything would be turned into a pandemonium. One of the large settees was wrenched loose and lifted over the stern of the steamer.  \"Now,\" said Tim, \"the minute it goes over yez must follow. The owld staamer is going like a straak of lightning, and if aither of yez wait, he'll be lift behind.\"  \"All right, no danger, go ahead!\"  They now clambered up, and sat poised on the stern. In this fearful position Tim O'Rooney held the settee balanced for a few minutes.  \"Be yez riddy?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Do yez jump a little to the right, Elwood, and yez a little to the left, Howard, so as not to hit the owld thing. All riddy; here we go!\"  The next moment the three were spinning down through the air, and struck the water. They went below the surface, the boys sinking quite a distance; but almost instantly they arose and struck bravely out.  \"Tim, where are you?\" called out Elwood, not seeing his friend.  \"Here, to the left,\" responded the Irishman, as he rose on a huge swell. \"Can ye swim to me?\"  \"I hope so, but my clothes bother me like creation.\"  Strange! that not one of the three had once thought of removing their superfluous clothing before jumping into the ocean. But Elwood was a fine swimmer, and he struggled bravely, although at a great disadvantage, until his outstretched hand was seized by the Irishman, and he then caught hold of the settee and rested himself.  \"Where is Howard?\" he asked, panting from his exertions.  \"Here he is,\" responded Howard himself. \"I struck the water so close that when I came up my hand hit the settee.\"  \"I tell you what it is,\" said Elwood. \"We ought to have brought something else with us beside this. We have got to keep all of our bodies underwater for this to bear us.\"  \"And what of it?\"  \"Suppose some poor fellow claims a part. Gracious! here comes a man this minute!\"  \"We can't turn him off,\" said Tim, \"but this owld horse has all the grist he can carry.\"  A dark body could be seen struggling and rapidly approaching them.  \"Whoever he is, he is a good swimmer,\" remarked Howard, watching the stranger.  \"Of course he is, for it comes natural; don't you see it isn't a man, but old Terror.\"  \"Thank heaven for that! we never thought about him. I am glad he is with us.\"  The next moment the Newfoundland placed his paw on the"]]]
