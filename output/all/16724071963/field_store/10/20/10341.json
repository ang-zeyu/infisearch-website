In pursuance of the designs thus expressed, the sailor began the construction of a raft without delay, and worked at it diligently the remainder of that day.  He found, on examination, that a considerable portion of the old raft yet remained stranded on the beach, though all the smaller spars of which it had been composed had been used for firewood.  With great difficulty he rolled these logs one by one into the sea, and, getting astride of each, pushed them by means of a pole towards a point of rocks, or natural jetty, alongside of which the water was deep.  Here he fastened them together by means of a piece of rope-- one of the old fastenings which remained to him, the others having been used in the construction of the hut.  The raft thus formed was, however, much too small to weather a gale or float in a rough sea.  In whatever way he placed the spars the structure was too narrow for safety. Seeing, therefore, that it was absolutely necessary to obtain more logs, he set brain and hands to work without delay.  Many years before, he had seen an ancient stone hatchet in a museum, the head of which was fastened to the haft by means of a powerful thong of untanned hide.  He resolved to make a hatchet of this sort.  Long did he search the beach for a suitable stone, but in vain.  At last he found one pretty nearly the proper shape, which he chipped and ground into the rude form of an axe.  It had no eye for the handle.  To have made a hole in it would have weakened the stone too much.  He therefore cut a groove in the side of the handle, placed the head of the stone into it, and completed the fastening by tying it firmly with the tough fibrous roots of a tree.  It was strongly and neatly made, though clumsy in appearance, but, do what he would, he could not put a sufficiently fine edge on it, and although it chipped pretty well when applied to the outside of a tree, it made very slow progress indeed as the cut deepened, and the work became so toilsome at last that he almost gave it up in despair.  Suddenly it occurred to him that fire might be made use of to facilitate the work.  Selecting a tall cocoanut-tree, he piled dry wood all round the foot of it.  Before setting it on fire he dipped a quantity of cocoanut fibre in the sea and tied a thick belt of this round the tree just above the pile, so as to protect the upper parts of the spar from the flames as much and as long as possible.  This done, he kindled the pile.  A steady breeze fanned the flame into an intense fire, which ere long dried up the belt of fibre and finally consumed it. The fire was pretty well burnt out by that time, however, so that the upper part of the stem had been effectually preserved.  Removing the ashes, he was rejoiced to find that the foot of the tree had been so deeply burned that several inches of it were reduced to charcoal, which his stone hatchet readily cut away, and the operation was so successful that it only required a second fire to enable him to fell the tree.  This done, he measured it off in lengths.  Under each point of measurement he piled up dry wood--which consisted merely of broken branches--with belts of wet fibre on each side of these piles.  Then, applying a light to the fires he reduced the parts to charcoal as before, and completed the work with the hatchet.  Thus, in the course of a single day, he felled a tall tree and cut it up into six lengths, which he rolled down to the sea and floated off to the end of the jetty.  Next day Jarwin rose with the sun, and began to make twine of twisted cocoanut fibre--of which there was great abundance to be had everywhere. When a sufficient quantity had been made he plaited the twine into cords, and the cords into stout ropes, which, although not so neat as regular ropes, were, nevertheless, sufficiently pliable and very strong. Several days were spent over this somewhat tedious process; and we may mention here, that in all these operations the busy seaman was greatly assisted by his dog, who stuck close to him all the time, encouraging him with looks and wags of approbation.  After the ropes were made, the raft was put together and firmly lashed. There was a mast and yard in the centre of it, and also a hollow, formed by the omission of a log, which was just large enough to permit of the man and his dog lying down.  This hollow, slight though it was, afterwards proved of the utmost service.  It is needless to recount all the details of the building and provisioning of this raft.  Suffice it to say that, about three weeks after the idea of it had been conceived, it was completed and ready for sea.  During his residence on the island, although it had only extended over a few months, Jarwin had become very expert in the use of a sharp-pointed pole, or javelin, with which he had become quite an adept in spearing fish.  He had also become such a dead-shot with a stone that when he managed to get within thirty yards of a bird, he was almost certain to hit it.  Thus he was enabled to procure fish and fowl as much as he required and as the woods abounded with cocoa-nuts, plums, and other wild fruits, besides many edible roots, he had no lack of good fare. Now that he was about to \"go to sea,\" he bethought him of drying some of the fruits as well as curing some fish and birds.  This he did by degrees, while engaged on the raft, so that when all was ready he had a store of provisions sufficient to last him several weeks.  In order to stow all this he removed another log from the middle of the raft, and, having deposited the food in the hollow--carefully wrapped in cocoanut leaves and made into compact bundles--he covered it over by laying a layer of large leaves above it and lashing a small spar on the top of them to keep them down.  The cask with which he had landed from the original raft, and which he had preserved with great care, not knowing how soon he might be in circumstances to require it, served to hold fresh water.  On a fine morning about sunrise, Jarwin embarked with his little dog and bade farewell to the coral island, and although he had not dwelt very long there, he felt, to his own surprise, much regret at quitting it.  A fresh breeze was blowing in the direction of the island--or the supposed island--he wished to reach.  This was important, because, in such a craft, it was impossible to sail in any way except before the wind.  Still, by means of a rude oar or paddle, he could modify its direction so as to steer clear of the passage through the reef and get out to sea.  Once outside, he squared the sail and ran right before the breeze.  Of course such a weighty craft went very slowly through the water, but the wind was pretty strong, and to Jarwin, who had been for a comparatively long time unaccustomed to moving on the water, the speed seemed fast enough.  As the island went astern, and the raft lifted and fell gently on the long swell of the ocean, the seaman's heart beat with a peculiar joy to which it had long been a stranger, and he thanked God fervently for having so soon answered his prayer.  For a long time he sat reclining in the hollow of the raft, resting his hand lightly on the steering oar and gazing in silence at the gradually fading woods of his late home.  The dog, as if it were aware that a great change was being effected in their destiny, lay also perfectly still--and apparently contemplative--at his master's feet; resting his chin on a log and gazing at the receding land.  It was evident, however, that _his_ thoughts were not absent or wandering, for, on the slightest motion made by his master, his dark eyes turned towards him, his ears slightly rose, and his tail gave the faintest possible indication of an intention to wag.  \"Well, Cuffy,\" said Jarwin at last, rousing himself with a sigh, \"wot are 'ee thinking of?\"  The dog instantly rose, made affectionate demonstrations, and whined.  \"Ah, you may well say that, Cuff,\" replied the man; \"I know you ain't easy in yer mind, and there's some reason in that, too, for we're off on a raither uncertain viage, in a somewhat unseaworthy craft.  Howsever, cheer up, doggie.  Whoever turns up, you and I shall sink or swim together.\"  Just then the sail flapped.  \"Hallo!  Cuff,\" exclaimed Jarwin, with a look of anxiety, \"the wind's going to shift.\"  This was true.  The wind did shift, and in a few minutes had veered so much round that the raft was carried away from the blue line on the horizon, which Jarwin had so fondly hoped would turn out to be an inhabited island.  It blew lightly, however, and when the sun went down, had completely died away.  In these circumstances Jarwin and his dog supped together, and then lay down to rest, full of sanguine hope.  They were awakened during the night by a violent squall, which, however, did no further damage than wash a little spray over them, for Jarwin had taken the precaution to lower and make fast the sail.  He now turned his attention to preparing the raft for rough weather.  This consisted in simply drawing over the hollow--in which he, his dog, and his provisions lay--a piece of canvas that he had cut off the sail, which was unnecessarily large.  It served as a tarpaulin, and effectually shielded them from ordinary sprays, but when the breeze freshened to a gale, and green seas swept over the _raft_, it leaked so badly, that Jarwin's cabin became a salt-water bath, and his provisions by degrees were soaked.  At first he did not mind this much, for the air and water were sufficiently warm, but after being wet for several hours he began feel chilled.  As for poor Cuffy, his trembling body bore testimony to the state of his feelings; nevertheless he did not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21742"],["title","Jarwin and Cuffy (#8)"],["body","plain, being a dog of high spirit and endurance.  In these circumstances the seaman hailed the rising sun with great joy, even although it rose in the midst of lurid murky clouds, and very soon hid its face altogether behind them, as if it had made up its mind that the state of things below was so bad as to be not worth shining upon.  All that day and night the gale continued, and they were driven before it.  The waves rushed so continuously and furiously over the raft, that it was with the utmost difficulty Jarwin could retain his position on it.  Indeed it would have been impossible for him to have done so, if he had not taken the precaution of making the hollow in the centre, into which he could crouch, and thus avoid the full force of the seas.  Next day the wind abated a little, but the sea still rolled \"mountains high.\" In order to break their force a little, he ventured to show a little corner of the sail.  Small though it was, it almost carried away the slender mast, and drove the raft along at a wonderfully rapid rate.  At last the gale went down, and, finally, it became a dead calm, leaving the raft like a cork heaving on the mighty swell of the Pacific Ocean. Weary and worn--almost dead with watching and exposure--John Jarwin lay down and slept, but his slumber was uneasy and unrefreshing.  Sunrise awoke him, and he sat up with a feeling of deep thankfulness, as he basked once more in its warm rays and observed that the sky above him was bright blue.  But other feelings mingled with these when he gazed round on the wide waste of water, which still heaved its swelling though now unruffled breast, as if panting after its recent burst of fury.  \"Ho!  Cuffy--what's that?  Not a sail, eh?\" exclaimed Jarwin, suddenly starting up, while his languid eyes kindled with excitement.  He was right.  After a long, earnest, anxious gaze, he came to the conclusion that it _was_ a sail which shone, white and conspicuous, like a speck or a snow-flake on the horizon.    CHAPTER FIVE.  JARWIN AND CUFFY FALL INTO BAD COMPANY.  Immediately on discovering the sail, Jarwin hoisted a small canvas flag, which he had prepared for the purpose, to the mast-head, and then sat down to watch with indescribable earnestness the motions of the vessel. There was great cause for anxiety he well knew, because his raft was a mere speck on the great waste of waters which might easily be overlooked even by a vessel passing at a comparatively short distance, and if the vessel's course should happen to lie across that of the raft, there was every probability she would only be visible for a short time and then pass away like a ray of hope dying out.  After gazing in perfect silence for half-an-hour, Jarwin heaved a deep sigh and said--  \"She steers this way, Cuffy.\"  Cuffy acknowledged the remark with a little whine and a very slight wag of his tail.  It was evident that his spirits had sunk to a low ebb, and that he was not prepared to derive comfort from every trifling circumstance.  \"Come, we'll have a bit of summat to eat, my doggie,\" said the sailor, reaching forward his hand to the provision bundle.  Thoroughly understanding and appreciating this remark, Cuffy roused himself and looked on with profound interest, while his master cut up a dried fish.  Having received a large share of it, he forgot everything else, and devoted all his powers, physical and mental, to the business in hand.  Although Jarwin also applied himself to the food with the devotion of a man whose appetite is sharp, and whose strength needs recruiting, he was very far indeed from forgetting other things.  He kept his eyes the whole time on the approaching sail, and once or twice became so absorbed and so anxious lest the vessel should change her course, that he remained with his mouth half open, and with the unconsumed morsel reposing therein for a minute or more at a time.  But the vessel did not change her course.  On she came; a fine large schooner with raking masts, and so trim and neat in her rig that she resembled a pleasure-yacht.  As she drew near, Jarwin rose, and holding on to the mast, waved a piece of canvas, while Cuffy, who felt that there was now really good ground for rejoicing, wagged his tail and barked in an imbecile fashion, as if he didn't exactly know whether to laugh or cry.  \"We're all safe now, doggie,\" exclaimed Jarwin, as the schooner came cutting through the water before a light breeze, leaving a slight track of foam in her wake.  When within about two or three hundred yards of the raft, the castaway could see that a figure leant on the vessel's side and brought a telescope to bear on him.  With a feeling of irrepressible gladness he laughed and waved his hand.  \"Ay, ay, take a good squint,\" he shouted, \"an' then lower a boat--eh!--\"  He stopped abruptly, for at that moment the figure turned towards the steersman; the schooner's head fell away, presenting her stern to the raft, and began to leave her behind.  The truth flashed upon Jarwin like a thunderbolt.  It was clear that the commander of the strange vessel had no intention of relieving him.  In the first burst of mingled despair and indignation, the seaman uttered a bass roar of defiance that might have done credit to the lungs of a small carronade, and at the same time shook his fist at the retiring schooner.  The effect of this was as sudden as it was unexpected.  To his surprise he observed that the schooner's head was immediately thrown up into the wind, and all her sails shook for a few moments, then, filling out again, the vessel bent gracefully over on the other tack.  With returning joy the castaway saw her run straight towards him.  In a few minutes she was alongside, and her topsails were backed.  \"Look out! catch hold!\" cried a gruff voice, as a sailor sent a coil of rope whirling over the raft.  Jarwin caught it, took a turn round the mast, and held on.  In a minute the raft was alongside.  Weak though he was, Jarwin retained enough of his sailor-like activity to enable him to seize a rope and swing himself on board with Cuffy in his arms.  He found himself on the pure white deck of a craft which was so well appointed and so well kept, that his first impressions were revived-- namely, that she was a pleasure-yacht.  He knew that she was not a vessel of war, because, besides the absence of many little things that mark such a vessel, the few men on deck were not clothed like man-of-war's-men, and there was no sign of guns, with the exception of one little brass carronade, which was probably used as a signal-gun.  A tall stout man, in plain costume, which was neither quite that of a seaman nor a landsman, stood with his arms crossed on his broad chest near the man at the wheel.  To him, judging him to be the captain or owner of the vessel, Jarwin went up, and, pulling his forelock by way of salutation, said--  \"Why, sir, I thought 'ee was a-goin' to leave me!\"  \"So I was,\" answered the captain, drily.  \"Hold on to the raft,\" he added, turning to the man who had thrown the rope to Jarwin.  \"Well, sir,\" said the latter in some surprise, \"in course I don't know why you wos a-goin' to leave a feller-creetur to his fate, but I'm glad you didn't go for to do it, 'cos it wouldn't have bin Christian-like. But I'm bound for to thank 'ee, sir, all the same for havin' saved me-- and Cuffy.\"  \"Don't be too free with your thanks, my good man,\" returned the captain, \"for you're not saved, as you call it, yet.\"  \"Not saved yet?\" repeated Jarwin.  \"No.  Whether I save you or not depends on your keeping a civil tongue in your head, and on your answers to my questions.\"  The captain interlarded his speech with many oaths, which, of course, we omit.  This, coupled with his rude manners, induced Jarwin to suspect that the vessel was not a pleasure-yacht after all, so he wisely held his peace.  \"Where do you belong to?\" demanded the captain.  \"To Yarmouth, sir.\"  \"What ship did you sail in, what has come of her, and how came you to be cast adrift?\"  \"I sailed in the _Nancy_, sir, from Plymouth, with a miscellaneous cargo for China.  She sprung a leak in a gale, and we was 'bliged to make a raft, the boats bein' all stove in or washed away.  It was barely ready when the ship went down starn foremost.  Durin' the gale all my mates were washed off the raft or died of exposure; only me and my dog left.\"  \"How long ago was that?\" asked the captain.  \"Couldn't rightly say, sir, I've lost count o' time, but it's more than a year gone by anyhow.\"  \"That's a lie,\" said the captain, with an oath.  \"No, 'taint, sir,\" replied Jarwin, reddening, \"it's a truth.  I was nigh starved on that raft, but was cast on an island where I've bin till a few days ago ever since, when I put to sea on the raft that now lays a-starn there.\"  For a few seconds the captain made no rejoinder, but a glance at the raft seemed to satisfy him of the truth of what was said.  At length he said abruptly--  \"What's your name?\"  \"John Jarwin, sir.\"  \"Well, John Jarwin, I'll save you on one condition, which is, that you become one of my crew, and agree to do my bidding and ask no questions. What say you?\"  Jarwin hesitated.  \"Haul up the raft and let this man get aboard of it,\" said the captain, coolly but sternly, to the seaman who held the rope.  \"You've no occasion to be so sharp, sir,\" said John, remonstratively. \"If you wos to tell me to cut my own throat, you know, I could scarce be expected for to do it without puttin' a few questions as to the reason why.  You're a trader, I suppose?\"  \"Yes, I'm a trader,\" replied the captain, \"but I don't choose to be questioned by you.  All you've got to do is to agree to my proposal or to walk over the side.  To tell you the truth, when I saw you first through the glass, you looked such a starved wretch that I thought you'd be of no use to me, and if it hadn't been for the yell you gave, that showed there was something in you still, I'd have left you to sink or swim.  So you see what sort of "]]]
