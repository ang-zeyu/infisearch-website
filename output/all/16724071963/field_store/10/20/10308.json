The fog had cleared away; heavy clouds rolled athwart the sky; a deeper darkness descended on the shipping at anchor in the Downs, and a gradually increasing swell caused the Gull to roll a little and tug uneasily at her cable. Nevertheless the warning light at her mast-head retained its perpendicular position in consequence of a clever adaptation of mechanism on the principle of the universal joint.  With the rise of the swell came the first rush of the squall.  \"If they don't send the boat at once, you'll have to spend the night with us, Jim,\" said the mate, looking anxiously in the direction of the sloop belonging to Morley Jones, the dark outlines of which could just be seen looming of a deeper black against the black sky.  \"It's too late even now,\" returned Jim in an anxious tone; \"the boat, like everything else about the sloop, is a rotten old thing, and would be stove against the side in this swell, slight though it be as yet. But my chief trouble is, that the cables are not fit to hold her if it comes on to blow hard.\"  For some time the wind increased until it blew half a gale.  At that point it continued steady, and as it gave no indication of increasing, John Welton and his son returned to the cabin, where the latter amused himself in glancing over some of the books in the small library with which the ship was furnished, while the sire busied himself in posting up the ship's log for the day.  For a considerable time they were silent, the one busily engaged writing, the other engrossed with a book.  At last Mr Welton senior heaved a deep sigh, and said, while he carefully dotted an _i_ and stroked a _t_--  \"It has always been my opinion, Jim, that when boys are bein' trained for the sea, they should be taught writing in a swing or an omnibus, in order to get 'em used to do it in difficult circumstances.  There she goes again,\" he added, referring to a lurch of the vessel which caused the tail of a _y_ to travel at least two inches out of its proper course.  \"Now, that job's done.  I'll turn in for a spell, and advise you to do the same, lad.\"  \"No, I'll go on deck and have a talk with Dick Moy.  If the gale don't increase I'll perhaps turn in, but I couldn't sleep just now for thinkin' o' the sloop.\"  \"Please yourself, my son, an' you'll please me,\" replied the mate with a smile which ended in a yawn as he opened the door of a small sleeping berth, and disappeared into its recesses.  James Welton stood for a few minutes with his back to the small fireplace, and stared meditatively at the cabin lamp.  The cabin of the floating light was marvellously neat and immaculately clean.  There was evidence of a well-ordered household in the tidiness with which everything was put away in its proper place, even although the fair hand of woman had nothing to do with it, and clumsy man reigned paramount and alone!  The cabin itself was very small--about ten feet or so in length, and perhaps eight in width.  The roof was so low that Jim could not stand quite erect because of the beams.  The grate resembled a toy, and was of brass polished so bright that you might have used it for a looking-glass; the fire in it was proportionately small, but large enough for the place it had to warm.  A crumb or speck of dust could scarce have been found on the floor with a microscope,--and no wonder, for whenever John Welton beheld the smallest symptom of such a blemish he seized a brush and shovel and swept it away.  The books in the little library at the stern were neatly arranged, and so were the cups, plates, glasses, salt-cellars, spoons, and saucers, in the little recess that did duty as a cupboard.  In short, order and cleanliness reigned everywhere.  And not only was this the case in the cabin, but in every department of the ship.  The bread-lockers, the oil-room next to the cabin, the galley where the men lived--all were scrupulously clean and everything therein was arranged with the method and precision that one is accustomed to expect only on board a man-of-war.  And, after all, what is a floating light but a man-of-war?  Its duty is, like that of any three-decker, to guard the merchant service from a dangerous foe.  It is under command of the Trinity Corporation--which is tantamount to saying that it is well found and handled--and it does battle continually with the storm.  What more could be said of a man-of-war?  The only difference is that it does its work with less fuss and no noise!  After warming himself for a short time, for the night had become bitterly cold, Jim Welton put on one of his sire's overcoats and went on deck, where he had a long walk and talk with Dick Moy, who gave it as his opinion that \"it was a wery cold night,\" and said that he \"wouldn't be surprised if it wor to come on to blow 'arder before mornin'.\"  Dick was a huge man with a large expanse of good-natured visage, and a tendency to make all his statements with the solemnity of an oracle. Big and little men, like large and small dogs, have usually a sympathetic liking for each other.  Dick Moy's chief friend on board was little Jack Shales, who was the life of the ship, and was particularly expert, as were also most of his mates, in making, during hours of leisure, beautiful workboxes and writing-desks with inlaid woods of varied colours, which were sold at a moderate price on shore, in order to eke out the monthly wage and add to the comforts of wives and little ones at Ramsgate.  It may be added that Jack Shales was unquestionably the noisiest man on board.  He had a good voice; could sing, and _did_ sing, from morning till night, and had the power of uttering a yell that would have put to shame the wildest warrior among the Cherokee savages!  Jack Shales kept watch with Moy that night, and assisted in the conversation until a sudden snow storm induced young Welton to bid them good-night and retire below.  \"Good-night,\" said Shales, as Jim's head was disappearing down the hatchway, \"stir up the fire and keep yourself warm.\"  \"That's just what I mean to do,\" replied Jim; \"sorry I can't communicate some of the warmth to you.\"  \"But you can think of us,\" cried Jack, looking down the hatchway, \"you can at least pity us poor babes out here in the wind and snow!\"  \"Shut up, Jack!\" said Moy with a solemn growl, \"wot a tremendous jaw you've got w'en you let loose!  Why, wot are 'ee starin' at now?  'Ave 'ee seed a ghost?\"  \"No, Dick,\" said Shales, in a tone of voice from which every vestige of jocularity had disappeared; \"look steady in the direction of the South sandhead light and--see! ain't that the flash of a gun?\"  \"It looks like it.  A wreck on the sand, I fear,\" muttered Dick Moy, putting up both hands to guard his eyes from the snow-flakes that were driven wildly about by the wind, which had by that time increased to a furious gale.  For a few minutes the two men stood gazing intently towards the south-west horizon.  Presently a faint flash was seen, so faint that they could not be certain it was that of a signal-gun.  In a few minutes, however, a thin thread of red light was seen to curve upwards into the black sky.  \"No mistake now,\" cried Jack, leaping towards the cabin skylight, which he threw up, and bending down, shouted--\"South sandhead light is firing, sir, and sending up rockets!\"  The mate, who was at the moment in the land of dreams, sprang out of them and out of his bunk, and stood on the cabin floor almost before the sentence was finished.  His son, who had just drawn the blanket over his shoulders, and given vent to the first sigh of contentment with which a man usually lays his head on his pillow for the night, also jumped up, drew on coat, nether garments, and shoes, as if his life depended on his speed, and dashed on deck.  There was unusual need for clothing that night, for it had become bitterly cold, a coat of ice having formed even on the salt-water spray which had blown into the boats.  They found Dick Moy and Jack Shales already actively engaged--the one loading the lee gun, the other adjusting a rocket to its stick.  A few hurried questions from the mate elicited all that it was needful to know.  The flash of the gun from the South sandhead lightship, about six miles off, had been distinctly seen a third time, and a third rocket went up just as Welton and his son gained the deck, indicating that a vessel had struck upon the fatal Goodwin Sands.  The report of the gun could not be heard, owing to the gale carrying the sound to leeward, but the bright line of the rocket was distinctly visible.  At the same moment the flaring light of a burning tar-barrel was observed.  It was the signal of the vessel in distress just on the southern tail of the sands.  By this time the gun was charged and the rocket in position.  \"Look alive, Jack, fetch the poker!\" cried the mate as he primed the gun.  Jack Shales dived down the companion-hatch, and in another moment returned with a red-hot poker, which the mate had thrust into the cabin fire at the first alarm.  He applied it in quick succession to the gun and rocket.  A blinding flash and deafening crash were followed by the whiz of the rocket as it sprang with a magnificent curve far away into the surrounding darkness.  This was their answer to the South sandhead light, which, having fired three guns and sent up three rockets to attract the attention of the Gull, then ceased firing.  It was also their first note of warning to the look-out on the pier of Ramsgate harbour.  Of the three light-ships that guarded the sands, the Gull lay nearest to Ramsgate; hence, whichever of the other two happened to send up signals, the Gull had to reply and thenceforward to continue repeating them until the attention of the Ramsgate look-out should be gained, and a reply given.  \"That's a beauty,\" cried the mate, referring to the rocket; \"fetch another, Jack; sponge her well out, Dick Moy, we'll give 'em another shot in a few"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21735"],["title","The Floating Light of the Goodwin Sands (#5)"],["body","tes.\"  Loud and clear were both the signals, but four and a half miles of distance and a fresh gale neutralised their influence.  The look-out on the pier did not observe them.  In less than five minutes the gun and rocket were fired again.  Still no answering signal came from Ramsgate.  \"Load the weather gun this time,\" cried the mate, \"they'll have a better chance of seeing the flash of that.\"  Jack obeyed, and Jim Welton, having nothing to do but look on, sought shelter under the lee of the weather bulwarks, for the wind, according to Dick Moy, \"was blowin' needles and penknives.\"  The third gun thundered forth and shook the floating light from stem to stern, but the rocket struck the rigging and made a low wavering flight. Another was therefore sent up, but it had scarcely cut its bright line across the sky when the answering signal was observed--a rocket from Ramsgate pier!  \"That's all right now; _our_ duty's done,\" said the mate, as he went below, and, divesting himself of his outer garments, quietly turned in, while the watch, having sponged out and re-covered the guns, resumed their active perambulation of the deck.  James Welton, however, could not calm down his feelings so easily.  This was the first night he had ever spent in a light-ship; the scene was therefore quite new to him, and he could not help feeling somewhat disappointed at the sudden termination of the noise and excitement.  He was told that the Ramsgate lifeboat could not be out in less than an hour, and it seemed to his excited spirit a terrible thing that human lives should be kept so long in jeopardy.  Of course he began to think, \"Is it not possible to prevent this delay?\" but his better sense whispered to him that excited spirits are not the best judges in such matters, although it cannot be denied that they have an irresistible tendency to judge.  There was nothing for it, however, but to exercise philosophic patience, so he went below and turned in, as sailors have it, \"all standing,\" to be ready when the lifeboat should make its appearance.  The young sailor's sleep was prompt and profound.  It seemed to him but a few minutes after he had laid his head on the pillow when Jack Shale's voice again resounded in the cabin--  \"Lifeboat close alongside, sir.  Didn't see her till this moment.  She carries no lights.\"  The Weltons, father and son, sprang out of their bunks a second time, and, minus coat, hat, and shoes, scrambled on deck just in time to see the Broadstairs lifeboat rush past before the gale.  She was close under the stern, and rendered spectrally visible by the light of the lantern.  \"What are you firing for?\" shouted the coxswain of the boat.  \"Ship on the sands, bearing south,\" roared Jack Shales at the full pitch of his stentorian voice.  There was no time for more, for the boat did not pause in her meteor-like flight.  The question was asked and answered as she passed with a magnificent rush into darkness.  The reply had been heard, and the lifeboat shot, straight as an arrow, to the rescue.  Reader, we often hear and read of such scenes, but we can tell you from experience that vision is necessary to enable one to realise the full import of all that goes on.  There was a strange thrill at the heart of young Welton when he saw the familiar blue-and-white boat leaping over the foaming billows.  Often had he seen it in model and in quiescence in its boat-house, ponderous and almost ungainly; but now he saw it for the first time in action, as if endued with life.  So, we fancy, warriors might speak of our heavy cavalry as _we_ see them in barracks and as _they_ saw them at Alma.  Again all was silent and unexciting on board the Gull; but, not many minutes later, the watch once more shouted down the skylight--  \"Tug's in sight, sir.\"  It was afterwards ascertained that a mistake had been made in reference to the vessel that had signalled.  Some one on shore had reported that the guns and rockets had been seen flashing from the _North_ sandhead vessel, whereas the report should have been, \"from the vessel at the _South_ sandhead.\"  The single word was all-important.  It had the effect of sending the steam-tug Aid (which always attends upon the Ramsgate lifeboat) in the wrong direction, involving much loss of time. But we mention this merely as a fact, not as a reproof.  Accidents will happen, even in the best regulated families.  The Ramsgate lifeboat service is most admirably regulated; and for once that an error of this kind can be pointed out, we can point to dozens--ay, hundreds--of cases in which the steamer and lifeboat have gone, straight as the crow flies, to the rescue, and have done good service on occasions when all other lifeboats would certainly have failed; so great is the value of steam in such matters.  On this occasion, however, the tug appeared somewhat late on the scene, and hailed the Gull.  When the true state of the case was ascertained, her course was directed aright, and full steam let on.  The Ramsgate boat was in tow far astern.  As she passed, the brief questions and answers were repeated for the benefit of the coxswain, and Jim Welton observed that every man in the boat appeared to be crouching down on the thwarts except the coxswain, who stood at the steering tackles.  No wonder.  It is not an easy matter to sit up in a gale of wind, with freezing spray, and sometimes green seas, sweeping over one!  The men were doubtless wideawake and listening, but, as far as vision went, that boat was manned by ten oilskin coats and sou'westers!  A few seconds carried them out of sight, and so great was the power of steam that, despite the loss of time, they reached the neighbourhood of the wreck as soon as the Broadstairs boat, and found that the crew of the stranded vessel had already been saved, and taken ashore by the Deal lifeboat.  It may be as well to observe here, that although in this case much energy was expended unnecessarily, it does not follow that it is frequently so expended.  Often, far too often, all the force of lifeboat service on that coast is insufficient to meet the demands on it.  The crews of the various boats in the vicinity of the Goodwin Sands are frequently called out more than once in a night, and they are sometimes out all night, visiting various wrecks in succession.  In all this work the value of the steam-tug is very conspicuous, for it can tow its boat again and again to windward of a wreck, and renew the effort to save life in cases where, devoid of such aid, lifeboats would be compelled to give in after the failure of their first attempt, in consequence of their being driven helplessly to leeward.  But we have forestalled our narrative.  The drama, as far as the Gull-Light was concerned, ended that night with the disappearance of the tug and lifeboat.  It was not until several days afterwards that her crew learned the particulars of the wreck in connection with which they had acted so brief but so important a part.  Meanwhile, Dick Moy, who always walked the deck with a rolling swagger, with his huge hands thrust deep into his breeches' pockets when there was nothing for them to do, said to Jim Welton, \"he'd advise 'im to go below an' clap the dead-lights on 'is peepers.\"  Jim, approving the advice, was about to descend to the cabin, when he was arrested by a sharp cry that appeared to rise out of the waves.  \"Wot iver is that?\" exclaimed Dick, as they all rushed to the port bow of the vessel and looked over the side.  \"Something in the water,\" cried Jack Shales, hastily catching up a coil of rope and throwing it overboard with that promptitude which is peculiar to seamen.  \"Why, _he_ can't kitch hold on it; it's only a dog,\" observed Dick Moy.  All uncertainty on this point was cleared away, by a loud wail to which the poor animal gave vent, as it scraped along the ship's hull, vainly endeavouring to prevent itself from being carried past by the tide.  By this time they were joined by the mate and the rest of the crew, who had heard the unwonted sounds and hurried on deck.  Each man was eagerly suggesting a method of rescue, or attempting to carry one into effect, by means of a noose or otherwise, when Mr Welton, senior, observed that Mr Welton, junior, was hastily tying a rope round his waist.  \"Hallo!  Jim,\" he cried, \"surely you don't mean to risk your life for a dog?\"  \"There's no risk about it, father.  Why should I leave a poor dog to drown when it will only cost a ducking at the worst?  You know I can swim like a cork, and I ain't easily cooled down.\"  \"You shan't do it if I can prevent,\" cried the mate, rushing at his reckless son.  But Jim was too nimble for him.  He ran to the stern of the vessel, leaped on the bulwarks, flung the end of the coil of rope among the men, and shouting, \"Hold on taut, boys!\" sprang into the sea.  The men did \"hold on\" most powerfully; they did more, they hauled upon the rope, hand over hand, to a \"Yo-heave-ho!\" from Jerry MacGowl, which put to shame the roaring gale, and finally hauled Jim Welton on board with a magnificent Newfoundland dog in his arms, an event which was greeted with three enthusiastic cheers!    CHAPTER FOUR.  A NEW CHARACTER INTRODUCED.  The gale was a short-lived one.  On the following morning the wind had decreased to a moderate breeze, and before night the sea had gone down sufficiently to allow the boat of Mr Jones's sloop to come alongside of the floating light.  Before Jim Welton bade his friends good-bye, he managed to have an earnest and private talk with each of them.  Although he had never been connected with the Gull, he had frequently met with the men of that vessel, and, being one of those large-hearted sympathetic men who somehow worm themselves into the affection and confidence of most of their friends and comrades, he had something particular to say to each, either in reference to wives and families on shore, or to other members of that distracting section of the human family which, according "]]]
