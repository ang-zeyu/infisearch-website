I've a notion it may be an offer to buy your clearin', for I've heerd two or three fellows speakin' about it.  Now, as I want to buy it myself, if yer disposed to sell it, I hereby make you the first offer.\"  Jack Robinson continued to smoke in silence, gazing abstractedly at the letter.  Since his mother had died, a year before the date of which we write, he had not received a line from any one, insomuch that he had given up calling at the post-office on his occasional visits to the nearest settlement.  This letter, therefore, took him by surprise, all the more that it was addressed in the handwriting of his former partner, Murray.  Breaking the seal, he read as follows:    \"Fort Kamenistaquoia, April the somethingth:--    \"Dear Jack,--You'll be surprised to see my fist, but not more   surprised than I was to hear from an old hunter just arrived, that you   had taken to farming.  It's not your forte, Jack, my boy.  Be advised.   Sell off the farm for what it will fetch, and come and join me.  My   antecedents are not in my favour, I grant; but facts are stubborn   things, and it is a fact that I am making dollars here like stones.   I'm a fur-trader, my boy.  Have joined a small company, and up to this   time have made a good thing of it.  You know something of the fur   trade, if I mistake not.  Do come and join us; we want such a man as   you at a new post we have established on the coast of Labrador.   Shooting, fishing, hunting, _ad libitum_.  Eating, drinking, sleeping,   _ad infinitum_.  What would you more?  Come, like a good fellow, and   be happy!    \"Ever thine, J. MURRAY.\"  \"I'll sell the _farm_,\" said Jack Robinson, folding the letter.  \"You will?\" exclaimed Joe.  \"What's your price?\"  \"Come over it with me, and look at the fixings, before I tell you,\" said Jack.  They went over it together, and looked at every fence and stump and implement.  They visited the live stock, and estimated the value of the sprouting crop.  Then they returned to the house, where they struck a bargain off-hand.  That evening Jack bade adieu to the Mountain House, mounted his horse, with his worldly goods at the pommel of the saddle, and rode away, leaving Joe, the trapper, in possession.  In process of time our hero rode through the settlements to Montreal, where he sold his horse, purchased a few necessaries, and made his way down the Saint Lawrence to the frontier settlements of the bleak and almost uninhabited north shore of the gulf.  Here he found some difficulty in engaging a man to go with him, in a canoe, towards the coast of Labrador.  An Irishman, in a fit of despondency, at length agreed; but on reaching a saw-mill that had been established by a couple of adventurous Yankees, in a region that seemed to be the out-skirts of creation, Paddy repented, and vowed he'd go no farther for love or money.  Jack Robinson earnestly advised the faithless man to go home, and help his grandmother, thenceforth, to plant murphies; after which he embarked in his canoe alone, and paddled away into the dreary north.  Camping out in the woods at night, paddling all day, and living on biscuit and salt pork, with an occasional duck or gull, by way of variety; never seeing a human face from morn till night, nor hearing the sound of any voice except his own, Jack pursued his voyage for fourteen days.  At the end of that time he descried Fort Kamenistaquoia.  It consisted of four small log-houses, perched on a conspicuous promontory, with a flag-staff in the midst of them.  Here he was welcomed warmly by his friend John Murray and his colleagues, and was entertained for three days sumptuously on fresh salmon, salt pork, pancakes, and tea.  Intellectually, he was regaled with glowing accounts of the fur trade and the salmon fisheries of that region.  \"Now, Jack,\" said Murray, on the third day after his arrival, while they walked in front of the fort, smoking a morning pipe, \"it is time that you were off to the new fort.  One of our best men has built it, but he is not a suitable person to take charge, and as the salmon season has pretty well advanced we are anxious to have you there to look after the salting and sending of them to Quebec.\"  \"What do you call the new fort?\" inquired Jack.  \"Well, it has not yet got a name.  We've been so much in the habit of styling it the New Fort that the necessity of another name has not occurred to us.  Perhaps, as you are to be its first master, we may leave the naming of it to you.\"  \"Very good,\" said Jack; \"I am ready at a moment's notice.  Shall I set off this forenoon?\"  \"Not quite so sharp as that,\" replied Murray, laughing.  \"To-morrow morning, at day-break, will do.  There is a small sloop lying in a creek about twenty miles below this.  We beached her there last autumn. You'll go down in a boat with three men, and haul her into deep water. There will be spring tides in two days, so, with the help of tackle, you'll easily manage it.  Thence you will sail to the new fort, forty miles farther along the coast, and take charge.\"  \"The three men you mean to give me know their work, I presume?\" said Jack.  \"Of course they do.  None of them have been at the fort, however.\"  \"Oh!  How then shall we find it?\" inquired Jack.  \"By observation,\" replied the other.  \"Keep a sharp look out as you coast along, and you can't miss it.\"  The idea of mists and darkness and storms occurred to Jack Robinson, but he only answered, \"Very good.\"  \"Can any of the three men navigate the sloop?\" he inquired.  \"Not that I'm aware of,\" said Murray; \"but you know something of navigation, yourself, don't you?\"  \"No! nothing!\"  \"Pooh! nonsense.  Have you never sailed a boat?\"  \"Yes, occasionally.\"  \"Well, it's the same thing.  If a squall comes, keep a steady hand on the helm and a sharp eye to wind'ard, and you're safe as the Bank.  If it's too strong for you, loose the halyards, let the sheets fly, and down with the helm; the easiest thing in the world if you only look alive and don't get flurried.\"  \"Very good,\" said Jack, and as he said so his pipe went out; so he knocked out the ashes and refilled it.  Next morning our hero rowed away with his three men, and soon discovered the creek of which his friend had spoken.  Here he found the sloop, a clumsy \"tub\" of about twenty tons burden, and here Jack's troubles began.  The _Fairy_, as the sloop was named, happened to have been beached during a very high tide.  It now lay high and dry in what once had been mud, on the shore of a land-locked bay or pond, under the shadow of some towering pines.  The spot looked like an inland lakelet, on the margin of which one might have expected to find a bear or a moose-deer, but certainly not a sloop.  \"Oh! ye shall nevair git him off,\" said Francois Xavier, one of the three men--a French-Canadian--on beholding the stranded vessel.  \"We'll try,\" said Pierre, another of the three men, and a burly half-breed.  \"Try!\" exclaimed Rollo, the third of the three men--a tall, powerful, ill-favoured man, who was somewhat of a bully, who could not tell where he had been born, and did not know who his father and mother had been, having been forsaken by them in his infancy.  \"Try? you might as well try to lift a mountain!  I've a mind to go straight back to Kamenistaquoia and tell Mr Murray that to his face!\"  \"Have you?\" said Jack Robinson, in a quiet, peculiar tone, accompanied by a gaze that had the effect of causing Rollo to look a little confused.  \"Come along, lads, we'll begin at once,\" he continued, \"it will be full tide in an hour or so.  Get the tackle ready, Francois; the rest of you set to work, and clear away the stones and rubbish from under her sides.\"  Jack threw off his coat, and began to work like a hero--as he was.  The others followed his example; and the result was that when the tide rose to its full height the sloop was freed of all the rubbish that had collected round the hull; the block tackle was affixed to the mast; the rope attached to a tree on the opposite side of the creek; and the party were ready to haul.  But although they hauled until their sinews cracked, and the large veins of their necks and foreheads swelled almost to bursting, the sloop did not move an inch.  The tide began to fall, and in a few minutes that opportunity was gone.  There were not many such tides to count on, so Jack applied all his energies and ingenuity to the work.  By the time the next tide rose they had felled two large pines, and applied them to the side of the vessel.  Two of the party swung at the ends of these; the other two hauled on the block-tackle. This time the sloop moved a little at the full flood; but the moment of hope soon passed, and the end was not yet attained.  The next tide was the last high one.  They worked like desperate men during the interval.  The wedge was the mechanical power which prevailed at last.  Several wedges were inserted under the vessel's side, and driven home.  Thus the sloop was canted over a little towards the water. When the tide was at the full, one man hauled at the tackle, two men swung at the ends of the levers, and Jack hammered home the wedges at each heave and pull; thus securing every inch of movement.  The result was that the sloop slid slowly down the bank into deep water.  It is wonderful how small a matter will arouse human enthusiasm!  The cheer that was given on the successful floating of the _Fairy_ was certainly as full of fervour, if not "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21732"],["title","Fort Desolation: Red Indians and Fur Traders of Rupert's Land (#2)"],["body","volume, as that which followed the launching of the _Great Eastern_.  Setting sail down the gulf they ran before a fair breeze which speedily increased to a favouring gale.  Before night a small bay was descried, with three log-huts on the shore.  This was the new fort.  They ran into the bay, grazing a smooth rock in their passage, which caused the _Fairy_ to tremble from stem to stern, and cast anchor close to a wooden jetty.  On the end of this a solitary individual, (apparently a maniac), was seen capering and yelling wildly.  \"What fort is this?\" shouted Jack.  \"Sorrow wan o' me knows,\" cried the maniac; \"it's niver been christened yet.  Faix, if it's a fort at all, I'd call it Fort Disolation.  Och! but it's lonesome I've been these three days--niver a wan here but meself an' the ghosts.  Come ashore, darlints, and comfort me!\"  \"Fort Desolation, indeed!\" muttered Jack Robinson, as he looked round him sadly; \"not a bad name.  I'll adopt it.  Lower the boat, lads.\"  Thus Jack took possession of his new home.    CHAPTER THREE.  DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL MATTERS.  Jack Robinson's first proceeding on entering the new fort and assuming the command, was to summon the man, (supposed to be a maniac), named Teddy O'Donel, to his presence in the \"Hall.\"  \"Your name is Teddy O'Donel?\" said Jack.  \"The same, sir, at your sarvice,\" said Teddy, with a respectful pull at his forelock.  \"They was used to call me _Mister_ O'Donel when I was in the army, but I've guv that up long ago an' dropped the title wid the commission.\"  \"Indeed: then you were a commissioned officer?\" inquired Jack, with a smile.  \"Be no manes.  It was a slight longer title than that I had.  They called me a non-commissioned officer.  I niver could find in me heart to consociate wid them consaited commissioners--though there was wan or two of 'em as was desarvin' o' the three stripes.  But I niver took kindly to sodgerin'.  It was in the Howth militia I was.  Good enough boys they was in their way, but I couldn't pull wid them no how.  They made me a corp'ral for good conduct, but, faix, the great review finished me; for I got into that state of warlike feeling that I loaded me muskit five times widout firin', an' there was such a row round about that I didn't know the dirty thing had niver wint off till the fifth time, when she bursted into smithereens an' wint off intirely.  No wan iver seed a scrag of her after that.  An' the worst was, she carried away the small finger of Bob Riley's left hand.  Bob threw down his muskit an' ran off the ground howlin', so I picked the wipon up an' blazed away at the inimy; but, bad luck to him, Bob had left his ramrod in, and I sint it right through the flank of an owld donkey as was pullin' an apple and orange cart.  Oh! how that baste did kick up its heels, to be sure! and the apples and oranges they was flyin' like--Well, well--the long and the short was, that I wint an' towld the colonel I couldn't stop no longer in such a regiment.  So I guv it up an' comed out here.\"  \"And became a fur-trader,\" said Jack Robinson, with a smile.  \"Just so, sur, an' fort-builder to boot; for, being a jiner to trade and handy wid the tools, Mr Murray sent me down here to build the place and take command, but I s'pose I'm suppersheeded now!\"  \"Well, I believe you are, Teddy; but I hope that you will yet do good service as my lieutenant.\"  The beaming smile on Teddy's face showed that he was well pleased to be relieved from the responsibilities of office.  \"Sure,\" said he, \"the throuble I have had wid the min an' the salvages for the last six weeks--it's past belavin'!  An' thin, whin I sint the men down to the river to fush--more nor twinty miles off--an' whin the salvages wint away and left me alone wid only wan old salvage woman!-- och!  I'd not wish my worst inimy in me sitivation.\"  \"Then the savages have been giving you trouble, have they?\"  \"They have, sur, but not so much as the min.\"  \"Well, Teddy,\" said Jack, \"go and fetch me something to eat, and then you shall sit down and give me an account of things in general.  But first give my men food.\"  \"Sure they've got it,\" replied Teddy, with a broad grin.  \"That spalpeen they calls Rollo axed for meat the first thing, in a voice that made me think he'd ait me up alive av he didn't git it.  So I guv 'em the run o' the pantry.  What'll yer plaze to dhrink, sur?\"  \"What have you got?\"  \"Tay and coffee, sur, not to mintion wather.  There's only flour an' salt pork to ait, for this is a bad place for game.  I've not seed a bird or a bear for three weeks, an' the seals is too cute for me.  But I'll bring ye the best that we've got.\"  Teddy O'Donel hastened to the kitchen, a small log-hut in rear of the dwelling-house, and left Jack Robinson alone in the \"Hall.\"  Jack rose, thrust his hands deep into his pockets, and walked to the window.  It was glazed with parchment, with the exception of the centre square, which was of glass.  \"Pleasant, uncommonly pleasant,\" he muttered, as he surveyed the landscape.  In front lay a flat beach of sand with the gulf beyond, the horizon being veiled in mist.  Up the river there was a flat beach with a hill beyond.  It was a black iron-looking hill, devoid of all visible verdure, and it plunged abruptly down into the sea as if it were trying fiercely to drown itself.  Down the river there was a continuation of flat beach, with, apparently, nothing whatever beyond.  The only objects that enlivened the dreary expanse were, the sloop at the end of the wooden jetty and a small flagstaff in front of the house, from which a flag was flying in honour of the arrival of the new governor.  At the foot of this flagstaff there stood an old iron cannon, which looked pugnacious and cross, as if it longed to burst itself and blow down all visible creation.  Jack Robinson's countenance became a simple blank as he took the first survey of his new dominions.  Suddenly a gleam of hope flitted across the blank.  \"Perhaps the back is better,\" he muttered, opening the door that led to the rear of the premises.  In order to get out he had to pass through the kitchen, where he found his men busy with fried pork and flour cakes, and his lieutenant, Teddy, preparing coffee.  \"What is that?\" inquired Jack, pointing to a small heap of brown substance which Teddy was roasting in a frying-pan.  \"Sure it's coffee,\" said the man.  \"Eh?\" inquired Jack.  \"Coffee, sur,\" repeated Teddy with emphasis.  \"What is it made of?\" inquired Jack.  \"Bread-crumbs, sur.  I'm used to make it of pais, but it takes longer, d'ye see, for I've got to pound 'em in a cloth after they're roasted. The crumbs is a'most as good as the pais, an' quicker made whin yer in a hurry.\"  Jack's first impulse was to countermand the crumbs and order tea, but he refrained, and went out to survey the back regions of his new home.  He found that the point selected for the establishment of the fort was a plain of sand, on which little herbage of any kind grew.  In rear of the house there was a belt of stunted bushes, which, as he went onward into the interior, became a wood of stunted firs.  This seemed to grow a little more dense farther inland, and finally terminated at the base of the distant and rugged mountains of the interior.  In fact, he found that he was established on a sandbank which had either been thrown up by the sea, or at no very remote period had formed part of its bed. Returning home so as to enter by the front door, he observed an enclosed space a few hundred yards distant from the fort.  Curious to know what it was, he walked up to it, and, looking over the stockade, beheld numerous little mounds of sand with wooden crosses at the head of them. It was the burial-ground of the establishment.  Trade had been carried on here by a few adventurous white men before the fort was built.  Some of their number having died, a space had been enclosed as a burying-ground.  The Roman Catholic Indians afterwards used it, and it was eventually consecrated with much ceremony by a priest.  With a face from which every vestige of intelligence was removed, Jack Robinson returned to the fort and sat down in solitary state in the hall.  In the act of sitting down he discovered that the only arm-chair in the room was unsteady on its legs, these being of unequal length. There were two other chairs without arms, and equally unsteady on their legs.  These, as well as everything in the room, were made of fir-wood-- as yet unpainted.  In the empty fire-place Jack observed a piece of charcoal, which he took up and began, in an absent way, to sketch on the white wall.  He portrayed a raving maniac as large as life, and then, sitting down, began insensibly to hum--    \"I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls.\"  In the midst of which he was interrupted by the entrance of his lieutenant with a tray of viands.  \"Ah, yer a purty creatur,\" exclaimed Teddy, pausing with a look of admiration before the maniac.  \"Come, Teddy, sit down and let's have the news.  What have we here?\" said Jack, looking at three covered plates which were placed before him.  \"Salt pork fried,\" said Teddy removing the cover.  \"And here?\"  \"Salt pork biled,\" said the man, removing the second cover; \"an' salt pork cold,\" he added, removing the third.  \"You see, sur, I wasn't sure which way ye'd like it, an' ye was out whin I come to ax; so I just did it up in three fashions.  Here's loaf bread, an' it's not bad, though I say it that made it.\"  As Jack cut down into the loaf, he naturally remembered those lines of a well-known writer:    \"Who has not tasted home-made bread,   A heavy compound of putty and   lead!\"  \"Are these cakes?\" he said, as Teddy presented another plate with something hot in it.  \"Ay, pancakes they is, made of flour an' wather fried in grease, an' the best of aitin', as ye'll find;--but, musha! they've all stuck together from some raison I han't yet diskivered: but they'll be none the worse for that, and there's plenty of good thick"]]]
