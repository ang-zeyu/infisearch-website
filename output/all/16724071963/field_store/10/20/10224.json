The shouts and commotion roused the crews of the nearest vessels, and ere long quite a fleet of boats joined in the search.  \"Wos he a big or a little feller?\" inquired Rokens, panting from his exertions, as he swept up to the boat containing the hospital warder, round which several of the other boats began to congregate.  \"A big fellow, I guess, with legs like steeples.  He was sloping when they floored him.  A thief, I expect he must ha' bin.\"  \"A thief!\" echoed Rokens, in disgust; \"why didn't ye say, so at first? If he's a thief, he's born to be hanged, so he's safe and snug aboard his ship long ago, I'll be bound.  Good-night t'ye, friend, and better luck next time.\"  A loud laugh greeted the ears of the discomfited warder as the crews of the boats dipped their oars in the water and pulled towards, their respective ships.  Next morning, about daybreak, little Alice Dunning came on board her father's ship, accompanied by her two aunts, who, for once, became utterly and publicly regardless of appearances and contemptuous of all propriety, as they sobbed on the child's neck and positively refused to be comforted.  Just as the sun rose, and edged the horizon with a gleam of liquid fire, the _Red Eric_ spread her sails and stood out to sea.    CHAPTER FIVE.  DAY DREAMS AND ADVENTURES AMONG THE CLOUDS--A CHASE, A BATTLE, AND A VICTORY.  Early morning on the ocean!  There is poetry in the idea; there is music in the very sound.  As there is nothing new under the sun, probably a song exists with this or a similar title; if not, we now recommend it earnestly to musicians.  Ailie Dunning sat on the bulwarks of the _Red Eric_, holding on tightly by the mizzen-shrouds, and gazing in open-eyed, open-mouthed, inexpressible delight upon the bright calm sea.  She was far, far out upon the bosom of the Atlantic now.  Sea-sickness--which during the first part of the voyage, had changed the warm pink of her pretty face into every imaginable shade of green--was gone, and the hue of health could not now be banished even by the rudest storm.  In short, she had become a thorough sailor, and took special delight in turning her face to windward during the wild storm, and drinking-in the howling blast as she held on by the rigid shrouds, and laughed at the dashing spray--for little Ailie was not easily frightened.  Martha and Jane Dunning had made it their first care to implant in the heart of their charge a knowledge of our Saviour's love, and especially of His tenderness towards, and watchful care over, the lambs of His flock.  Besides this, little Ailie was naturally of a trustful disposition.  She had implicit confidence in the strength and wisdom of her father, and it never entered into her imagination to dream that it was possible for any evil to befall the ship which _he_ commanded.  But, although Ailie delighted in the storm, she infinitely preferred the tranquil beauty and rest of a \"great calm,\" especially at the hour just before sunrise, when the freshness, brightness, and lightness of the young day harmonised peculiarly with her elastic spirit.  It was at this hour that we find her alone upon the bulwarks of the _Red Eric_.  There was a deep, solemn stillness around, that irresistibly and powerfully conveyed to her mind the idea of rest.  The long, gentle undulation of the deep did not in the least detract from this idea.  So perfect was the calm, that several masses of clouds in the sky, which shone with the richest saffron light, were mirrored in all their rich details as if in a glass.  The faintest possible idea of a line alone indicated, in one direction, where the water terminated and the sky began.  A warm golden haze suffused the whole atmosphere, and softened the intensity of the deep-blue vault above.  There was, indeed, little variety of object to gaze upon--only the water and the sky.  But what a world of delight did not Ailie find in that vast sky and that pure ocean, that reminded her of the sea of glass before the great white throne, of which she had so often read in Revelation.  The towering masses of clouds were so rich and thick, that she almost fancied them to be mountains and valleys, rocks and plains of golden snow.  Nay, she looked so long and so ardently at the rolling mountain heights in the sky above, and their magical counterparts in the sky below, that she soon, as it were, _thought herself into_ Fairyland, and began a regular journey of adventures therein.  Such a scene at such an hour is a source of gladsome, peaceful delight to the breast of man in every stage of life; but it is a source of unalloyed, bounding, exhilarating, romantic, unspeakable joy only in the years of childhood, when the mind looks hopefully forward, and before it has begun--as, alas! it must begin, sooner or later--to gaze regretfully back.  How long Ailie would have sat in motionless delight it is difficult to say.  The man at the wheel having nothing to do, had forsaken his post, and was leaning over the stern, either lost in reverie, or in a vain effort to penetrate with his vision the blue abyss to the bottom.  The members of the watch on deck were either similarly engaged or had stowed themselves away to sleep in quiet corners among blocks and cordage.  No one seemed inclined to move or speak, and she would probably have sat there immovable for hours to come, had not a hand fallen gently on her shoulder, and by the magic of its simple contact scattered the bright dreams of Fairyland as the finger-touch destroys the splendour of the soap-bubble.  \"Oh!  Glynn,\" exclaimed Ailie, looking round and heaving a deep sigh; \"I've been away--far, far away--you can't believe how far.\"  \"Away, Ailie!  Where have you been?\" asked Glynn, patting the child's head as he leaned over the gunwale beside her.  \"In Fairyland.  Up in the clouds yonder.  Out and in, and up and down. Oh, you've no idea.  Just look.\"  She pointed eagerly to an immense towering cloud that rose like a conspicuous landmark in the centre of the landscape of the airy world above.  \"Do you see that mountain?\"  \"Yes, Ailie; the one in the middle, you mean, don't you?  Yes, well?\"  \"Well,\" continued the child, eagerly and hurriedly, as if she feared to lose the thread of memory that formed the warp and woof of the delicate fabric she had been engaged in weaving; \"well, I began there; I went in behind it, and I met a fairy--not really, you know, but I tried to think I met one, so I began to speak to her, and then I made her speak to me, and her voice was so small and soft and sweet.  She had on silver wings, and a star--a bright star in her forehead--and she carried a wand with a star on the top of it too.  So I asked her to take me to see her kingdom, and I made her say she would--and, do you know, Glynn, I really felt at last as if she didn't wait for me to tell her what to say, but just went straight on, answering my questions, and putting questions to me in return.  Wasn't it funny?  \"Well, we went on, and on, and on--the fairy and me--up one beautiful mountain of snow and down another, talking all the time so pleasantly, until we came to a great dark cave; so I made up my mind to make a lion come out of it; but the fairy said, `No, let it be a bear;' and immediately a great bear came out.  Wasn't it strange?  It really seemed as if the fairy had become real, and could do things of her own accord.\"  The child paused at this point, and looking with an expression of awe into her companion's face, said--\"Do you think, Glynn, that people can _think_ so hard that fairies _really_ come to them?\"  Glynn looked perplexed.  \"No, Ailie, I suspect they can't--not because we can't think hard enough, but because there are no fairies to come.\"  \"Oh, I'm _so_ sorry!\" replied the child sadly.  \"Why?\" inquired Glynn.  \"Because I love them _so_ much--of course, I mean the good ones.  I don't like the bad ones--though they're very useful, because they're nice to kill, and punish, and make examples of, and all that, when the good ones catch them.\"  \"So they are,\" said the youth, smiling.  \"I never thought of that before.  But go on with your ramble in the clouds.\"  \"Well,\" began Ailie; \"but where was I?\"  \"Just going to be introduced to a bear.\"  \"Oh yes; well--the bear walked slowly away, and then the fairy called out an elephant, and after that a 'noceros--\"  \"A 'noceros!\" interrupted Glynn; \"what's that?\"  \"Oh, you know very well.  A beast with a thick skin hanging in folds, and a horn on its nose--\"  \"Ah, a _rhi_noceros--I see.  Well, go on, Ailie.\"  \"Then the fairy told a camel to appear, and after that a monkey, and then a hippopotamus, and they all came out one after another, and some of them went away, and others began to fight.  But the strangest thing of all was, that every one of them was _so_ like the pictures of wild beasts that are hanging in my room at home!  The elephant, too, I noticed, had his trunk broken exactly the same way as my toy elephant's one was.  Wasn't it odd?\"  \"It was rather odd,\" replied Glynn; \"but where did you go after that?\"  \"Oh, then we went on, and on again, until we came to--\"  \"It's your turn at the wheel, lad, ain't it?\" inquired Mr Millons, coming up at that moment, and putting an abrupt termination to the walk in Fairyland.  \"It is, sir,\" answered Glynn, springing quickly to the wheel, and relieving the man who had been engaged in penetrating the ocean's depths.  The mate walked forward; the released sailor went below, and Ailie was again left to her solitary meditations;--for she was enough of a sailor now, in heart, to know that she ought not to talk too much to the steersman, even though the weather should be calm and there was no call for his undivided attention to the duties of his post.  While Nature was thus, as it were, asleep, and the watch on deck were more than half in the same condition, there was one individual in the ship whose faculties were in active play, whose \"ste"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21714"],["title","The Red Eric (#7)"],["body","am,\" as he himself would have remarked, \"was up.\"  This was the worthy cook, Nikel Sling, whose duties called him to his post at the galley-fire at an early hour each day.  We have often thought that a cook's life must be one of constant self-denial and exasperation of spirit.  Besides the innumerable anxieties in reference to such important matters as boiling over and over-boiling, being done to a turn, or over-done, or singed or burned, or capsized, he has the diurnal misery of being the first human being in his little circle of life, to turn out of a morning, and must therefore experience the discomfort--the peculiar discomfort--of finding things as _they were left_ the night before.  Any one who does not know what that discomfort is, has only to rise an hour before the servants of a household, whether at sea or on shore, to find out.  Cook, too, has generally, if not always, to light the fire; and that, especially in frosty weather, is not agreeable.  Moreover, cook roasts _himself_ to such an extent, and at meal-times, in nine cases out of ten, gets into such physical and mental perturbation, that he cannot possibly appreciate the luxuries he has been occupied all the day in concocting. Add to this, that he spends all the morning in preparing breakfast; all the forenoon in preparing dinner; all the afternoon in preparing tea and supper, and all the evening in clearing up, and perhaps all the night in dreaming of the meals of the following day, and mentally preparing breakfast, and we think that we have clearly proved the truth of the proposition with which we started--namely, that a cook's life must be one of constant self-denial and exasperation of spirit.  But this is by the way, and was merely suggested by the fact that, while all other creatures were enjoying either partial or complete repose, Nikel Sling was washing out pots and pans and kettles, and handling murderous-looking knives and two-pronged tormentors with a demoniacal activity that was quite appalling.  Beside him, on a little stool close to the galley-fire, sat Tim Rokens-- not that Mr Rokens was cold--far from it.  He was, to judge from appearances, much hotter than was agreeable.  But Tim had come there and sat down to light his pipe, and being rather phlegmatic when not actively employed, he preferred to be partially roasted for a few minutes to getting up again.  \"We ought,\" remarked Tim Rokens, puffing at a little black pipe which seemed inclined to be obstinate, \"we ought to be gittin' among the fish by this time.  Many's the one I've seed in them 'ere seas.\"  \"I rather guess we should,\" replied the cook, pausing the midst of his toils and wiping the perspiration from his forehead with an immense bundle of greasy oakum.  \"But I've seed us keep dodgin' about for weeks, I have, later in the year than this, without clappin' eyes on a fin. What sort o' baccy d'ye smoke, Rokens?\"  \"Dun know.  Got it from a Spanish smuggler for an old clasp-knife. Why?\"  \"Cause it smells like rotten straw, an' won't improve the victuals. Guess you'd better take yourself off, old chap.\"  \"Wot a cross-grained crittur ye are,\" said Rokens, as he rose to depart.  At that moment there was heard a cry that sent the blood tingling to the extremities of every one on board the _Red Eric_.  \"Thar she blows! thar she blows!\" shouted the man in the crow's-nest.  The crow's-nest is a sort of cask, or nest, fixed at the top of the mainmast of whale-ships, in which a man is stationed all day during the time the ships are on the fishing-ground, to look out for whales; and the cry, \"Thar she blows,\" announced the fact that the look-out had observed a whale rise to the surface and blow a spout of steamy water into the air.  No conceivable event--unless perhaps the blowing-up of the ship itself-- could have more effectually and instantaneously dissipated the deep tranquillity to which we have more than once referred.  Had an electric shock been communicated through the ship to each individual, the crew could not have been made to leap more vigorously and simultaneously. Many days before, they had begun to expect to see whales.  Every one was therefore on the _qui vive_, so that when the well-known signal rang out like a startling peal in the midst of the universal stillness, every heart in the ship leaped in unison.  Had an observant man been seated at the time in the forecastle, he would have noticed that from out of the ten or fifteen hammocks that swung from the beams, there suddenly darted ten or fifteen pairs of legs which rose to the perpendicular position in order to obtain leverage to \"fetch way.\"  Instantly thereafter the said legs descended, and where the feet had been, ten or fifteen heads appeared.  Next moment the men were \"tumbling up\" the fore-hatch to the deck, where the watch had already sprung to the boat-tackles.  \"Where away?\" sang out Captain Dunning who was among the first on deck.  \"Off the weather bow, sir, three points.\"  \"How far?\"  \"About two miles.  Thar she blows!\"  \"Call all hands,\" shouted the captain.  \"Starboard watch, ahoy!\" roared the mate, in that curious hoarse voice peculiar to boatswains of men-of-war.  \"Tumble up, lads, tumble up! Whale in sight!  Bear a hand, my hearties!\"  The summons was almost unnecessary.  The \"starboard watch\" was--with the exception of one or two uncommonly heavy sleepers--already on deck pulling on its ducks and buckling its belts.  \"Thar she breaches, thar she blows!\" again came from the crow's-nest in the voice of a Stentor.  \"Well done, Dick Barnes, you're the first to raise the oil,\" remarked one of the men, implying by the remark that the said Dick was fortunate enough to be the first to sight a whale.  \"Where away now?\" roared the captain, who was in a state of intense excitement.  \"A mile an' a half to leeward, sir.\"  \"Clear away the boats,\" shouted the captain.  \"Masthead, ahoy!  D'ye see that whale now?\"  \"Ay, ay, sir.  Thar she blows!\"  \"Bear a hand, my hearties,\" cried the captain, as the men sprang to the boats which were swinging at the davits.  \"Get your tubs in!  Clear your falls!  Look alive, lads!  Stand-by to lower!  All ready?\"  \"All ready, sir.\"  \"Thar she blows!\" came again from the masthead with redoubled energy. \"Sperm-whales, sir; there's a school of 'em.\"  \"A _school_ of them!\" whispered Ailie, who had left her post at the mizzen-shrouds, and now stood by her father's side, looking on at the sudden hubbub in unspeakable amazement.  \"Do whales go to school?\" she said, laughing.  \"Out of the road, Ailie, my pet,\" cried her father hastily.  \"You'll get knocked over.  Lower away, lads, lower away!\"  Down went the starboard, larboard, and waist-boats as if the falls had been cut, and almost before you could wink the men literally tumbled over the side into them, took their places, and seized their oars.  \"Here, Glynn, come with me, and I'll show you a thing or two,\" said the captain.  \"Jump in, lad; look sharp.\"  Glynn instantly followed his commander into the starboard boat, and took the aft oar.  Tim Rokens, being the harpooner of that boat, sat at the bow oar with his harpoons and lances beside him, and the whale-line coiled in a tub in the boat's head.  The captain steered.  And now commenced a race that taxed the boats' crews to the utmost; for it is always a matter keenly contested by the different crews, who shall fix the first harpoon in the whale.  The larboard boat was steered by Mr Millons, the first mate; the waist-boat by Mr Markham, the second mate--the latter an active man of about five-and-twenty, whose size and physical strength were herculean, and whose disposition was somewhat morose and gloomy.  \"Now, lads, give way!  That's it! that's the way.  Bend your backs, now! _do_ bend your backs,\" cried the captain, as the three boats sprang from the ship's side and made towards the nearest whale, with the white foam curling at their bow.  Several more whales appeared in sight spouting in all directions, and the men were wild with excitement.  \"That's it!  Go it lads!\" shouted Mr Millons, as the waist-boat began to creep ahead.  \"Lay it on! give way!  What d'ye say, boys; shall we beat 'em?\"  Captain Dunning stood in the stern-sheets of the starboard boat, almost dancing with excitement as he heard these words of encouragement.  \"Give way, boys!\" he cried.  \"They can't do it!  That whale's ours--so it is.  Only bend your backs!  A steady pull!  Pull like steam-tugs! That's it!  Bend the oars!  Double 'em up!  Smash 'em in bits, _do_!\"  Without quite going the length of the captain's last piece of advice, the men did their work nobly.  They bent their strong backs with a will, and strained their sinewy arms to the utmost.  Glynn, in particular, to whom the work was new, and therefore peculiarly exciting and interesting, almost tore the rowlocks out of the boat in his efforts to urge it on, and had the oar not been made of the toughest ash, there is no doubt that he would have obeyed the captain's orders literally and have smashed it in bits.  On they flew like racehorses.  Now one boat gained an inch on the others, then it lost ground again as the crew of another put forth additional energy, and the three danced over the glassy sea as if the inanimate planks had been suddenly endued with life, and inspired with the spirit that stirred the men.  A large sperm-whale lay about a quarter of a mile ahead, rolling lazily in the trough of the sea.  Towards this the starboard boat now pulled with incredible speed, leaving the other two gradually astern.  A number of whales rose in various directions.  They had got into the midst of a shoal, or school of them, as the whale-men term it; and as several of these were nearer the other boats than the first whale was, they diverged towards them.  \"There go flukes,\" cried Rokens, as the whale raised its huge tail in the air and \"sounded\"--in other words, dived.  For a few minutes the men lay on their oars, uncertain in what direction the whale"]]]
