The cradle was simply a piece of flat board, with a bit of scarlet cloth fastened down each side of it.  First of all, the mother laid the poor infant, which was quite naked, sprawling on the ground.  A dirty-looking dog took advantage of this to sneak forward and smell at it, whereupon the mother seized a heavy piece of wood, and hit the dog such a rap over the nose as sent it away howling.  Then she spread a thick layer of soft moss on the wooden board.  Above this she laid a very neat, small blanket, about two feet in length.  Upon this she placed the baby, which objected at first to go to bed, squalled a good deal, and kicked a little.  The mother therefore took it up, turned it over, gave it one or two hearty slaps, and laid it down again.  This seemed to quiet it, for it afterwards lay straight out, and perfectly still, with its coal-black eyes staring out of its fat brown face, as if it were astonished at receiving such rough treatment.  The mother next spread a little moss over the child, and above that she placed another small blanket, which she folded and tucked in very comfortably, keeping the little one's arms close to its sides, and packing it all up, from neck to heels, so tightly that it looked more like the making up of a parcel than the wrapping up of a child.  This done, she drew the scarlet cloth over it from each side of the cradle, and laced it down the front.  When all was done, the infant looked like an Egyptian mummy, nothing but the head being visible.  The mother then leaned the cradle against the stem of a tree, and immediately one of the dogs ran against it, and knocked it over. Luckily, there was a wooden bar attached to the cradle, in front of the child's face, which bar is placed there on purpose to guard against injury from such accidents, so that the bar came first to the ground, and thus prevented the flattening of the child's nose, which, to say truth, was flat enough already!  Instead of scolding herself for her own carelessness, the Indian mother scolded the dog, and then hung the child on the branch of a tree, to keep it from further mischief.  The next turn in the river revealed a large waterfall, up which it was impossible to paddle, so they prepared to make a portage.  Before arriving at the foot of it, however, Jasper landed Heywood, to enable him to make a sketch, and then the two men shoved off, and proceeded to the foot of the fall.  They were lying there in an eddy, considering where was the best spot to land, when a loud shout drew their attention towards the rushing water. Immediately after, a boat was seen to hover for a moment on the brink of the waterfall.  This fall, although about ten or fifteen feet high, had such a large body of water rushing over it, that the river, instead of falling straight down, gushed over in a steep incline.  Down this incline the boat now darted with the speed of lightning.  It was full of men, two of whom stood erect, the one in the bow, the other in the stern, to control the movements of the boat.  For a few seconds there was deep silence.  The men held their breath as the boat leaped along with the boiling flood.  There was a curling white wave at the foot of the fall.  The boat cut through this like a knife, drenching her crew with spray.  Next moment she swept round into the eddy where the canoe was floating, and the men gave vent to a loud cheer of satisfaction at having run the fall in safety.  But this was not the end of that exciting scene.  Scarcely had they gained the land, when another boat appeared on the crest of the fall. Again a shout was given and a dash made.  For one moment there was a struggle with the raging flood, and then a loud cheer as the second boat swept into the eddy in safety.  Then a third and a fourth boat went through the same operation, and before the end of a quarter of an hour, six boats ran the fall.  The bay at the foot of it, which had been so quiet and solitary when Jasper and his friends arrived, became the scene of the wildest confusion and noise, as the men ran about with tremendous activity, making preparations to spend the night there.  Some hauled might and main at the boats; some carried up the provisions, frying-pans, and kettles; others cut down dry trees with their axes, and cut them up into logs from five to six feet long, and as thick as a man's thigh.  These were intended for six great fires, each boat's crew requiring a fire to themselves.  While this was going on, the principal guides and steersmen crowded round our three travellers, and plied them with questions; for it was so unusual to meet with strangers in that far-off wilderness, that a chance meeting of this kind was regarded as quite an important event.  \"You're bound for York Fort, no doubt,\" said Jasper, addressing a tall handsome man of between forty and fifty, who was the principal guide.  \"Ay, that's the end of our journey.  You see we're taking our furs down to the coast.  Have you come from York Fort, friend!\"  \"No, I've come all the way from Canada,\" said Jasper, who thereupon gave them a short account of his voyage.  \"Well, Jasper, you'll spend the night with us, won't you?\" said the guide.  \"That will I, right gladly.\"  \"Come, then, I see the fires are beginning to burn.  We may as well have a pipe and a chat while supper is getting ready.\"  The night was now closing in, and the scene in the forest, when the camp-fires began to blaze, was one of the most stirring and romantic sights that could be witnessed in that land.  The men of the brigade were some of them French-Canadians, some natives of the Orkney Islands, who had been hired and sent out there by the Hudson's Bay Company, others were half-breeds, and a few were pure Indians.  They were all dressed in what is called _voyageur_ costume-coats or capotes of blue or grey cloth, with hoods to come over their heads at night, and fastened round their waists with scarlet worsted belts; corduroy or grey trousers, gartered outside at the knees, moccasins, and caps.  But most of them threw off their coats, and appeared in blue and red striped cotton shirts, which were open at the throat, exposing their broad, sun-burned, hairy chests.  There was variety, too, in the caps--some had Scotch bonnets, others red nightcaps, a few had tall hats, ornamented with gold and silver cords and tassels, and a good many wore no covering at all except their own thickly-matted hair.  Their faces were burned to every shade of red, brown, and black, from constant exposure, and they were strong as lions, wild as zebras, and frolicksome as kittens.  It was no wonder, then, that Heywood got into an extraordinary state of excitement and delight as he beheld these wild, fine-looking men smoking their pipes and cooking their suppers, sitting, lying, and standing, talking and singing, and laughing, with teeth glistening and eyes glittering in the red blaze of the fires--each of which fires was big enough to have roasted a whole ox!  The young artist certainly made good use of his opportunity.  He went about from fire to fire, sketch-book in hand, sketching all the best-looking men in every possible attitude, sometimes singly, and sometimes in groups of five or six.  He then went to the farthest end of the encampment, and, in the light of the last fire, made a picture of all the rest.  The kettles were soon steaming.  These hung from tripods erected over the fires.  Their contents were flour and pemmican, made into a thick soup called Rubbiboo.  As pemmican is a kind of food but little known in this country, I may as well describe how it is made.  In the first place, it consists of buffalo meat.  The great plains, or prairies, of America, which are like huge downs or commons hundreds of miles in extent, afford grass sufficient to support countless herds of deer, wild horses, and bisons. The bisons are called by the people there buffaloes.  The buffalo is somewhat like an enormous ox, but its hind-quarters are smaller and its fore-quarters much larger than those of the ox.  Its hair is long and shaggy, particularly about the neck and shoulders, where it becomes almost a mane.  Its horns are thick and short, and its look is very ferocious, but it is in reality a timid creature, and will only turn to attack a man when it is hard pressed and cannot escape.  Its flesh is first-rate for food, even better than beef, and there is a large hump on its shoulder, which is considered the best part of the animal.  Such is the bison, or buffalo, from which pemmican is made.  When a man wishes to make a bag of pemmican, he first of all kills the buffalo--not an easy thing to do by any means, for the buffalo runs well.  Having killed him, he skins him and cuts up the meat--also a difficult thing to do, especially if one is not used to that sort of work.  Then he cuts the meat into thin layers, and hangs it up to dry. Dried meat will keep for a long time.  It is packed up in bales and sent about that country to be used as food.  The next thing to be done is to make a bag of the raw hide of the buffalo.  This is done with a glover's needle, the raw sinews of the animal being used instead of thread.  The bag is usually about three feet long, and eighteen inches broad, and the hair is left on the outside of it.  A huge pot is now put on the fire, and the fat of the buffalo is melted down.  Then the dried meat is pounded between two stones, until it is torn and broken up into shreds, after which it is put into the bag, the melted fat is poured over it, and the whole is well mixed.  The last operation is to sew up the mouth of the bag and leave it to cool, after which the pemmican is ready for use.  In this state a bag of pemmican will keep fresh and good for years. When the search was going on in the polar regions for the lost ships of Sir John Franklin, one of the parties hid some pemmican in the ground, intending to return and take it up.  They returned home, however, another way.  Five years later some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21715"],["title","Away in the Wilderness (#8)"],["body","discovered this pemmican, and it was found, at that time, to be fit for food.  Pemmican is extensively used throughout Rupert's Land, especially during summer, for at that season the brigades of boats start from hundreds of inland trading-posts to take the furs to the coast for shipment to England, and pemmican is found to be not only the best of food for these hard-working men, but exceedingly convenient to carry.  Supper finished, the wild-looking fellows of this brigade took to their pipes, and threw fresh logs on the fires, which roared, and crackled, and shot up their forked tongues of flame, as if they wished to devour the forest.  Then the song and the story went round, and men told of terrible fights with the red-men of the prairies, and desperate encounters with grizzly bears in the Rocky Mountains, and narrow escapes among the rapids and falls, until the night was half spent.  Then, one by one, each man wrapped himself in his blanket, stretched himself on the ground with his feet towards the fire and his head pillowed on a coat or a heap of brush-wood, and went to sleep.  Ere long they were all down, except one or two long-winded story tellers, who went on muttering to their pipes after their comrades were asleep.  Even these became tired at last of the sound of their own voices, and gradually every noise in the camp was hushed, except the crackling of the fires as they sank by degrees and went out, leaving the place in dead silence and total darkness.  With the first peep of dawn the guide arose.  In ten minutes after his first shout the whole camp was astir.  The men yawned a good deal at first and grumbled a little, and stretched themselves violently, and yawned again.  But soon they shook off laziness and sprang to their work.  Pots, pans, kettles, and pemmican bags were tossed into the boats, and in the course of half-an-hour they were ready to continue the voyage.  Jasper stood beside the guide looking on at the busy scene.  \"Heard you any news from the Saskatchewan of late,\" said he.  \"Not much,\" replied the guide; \"there's little stirring there just now, except among the Indians, who have been killing and scalping each other as usual.  But, by the way, that reminds me there has been a sort of row between the Indians and the Company's people at Fort Erie.\"  \"Fort Erie,\" said Jasper with a start.  \"Ay, that's the name o' the fort, if I remember right,\" returned the guide.  \"It seems that one o' the men there, I think they call him Laroche--but what makes you start, friend Jasper?  Do you know anything of this man.\"  \"Yes, he's a friend of mine.  Go on, let me hear about it.\"  \"Well, there's not much to tell,\" resumed the guide.  \"This Laroche, it would appear, has got into hot water.  He has a daughter, a good lookin' wench I'm told, and, better than that, a well-behaved one.  One o' the Indians had been impertinent to the girl, so old Laroche, who seems to be a fiery fellow, up fist, hit him on the nose, and knocked the savage flat on his back.  A tremendous howl was set up, and knives and hatchets were flourished; but Mr Pemberton, who is in charge of Fort Erie, ran in and pacified them.  The Indian that was floored vows he'll have the hair of old Laroche's head.\"  This taking the hair off people's heads, or scalping, as it is called, is a common practice among the North American Indians.  When a savage kills his enemy he runs his scalping knife round the dead man's head, seizes the hair with his left hand and tears the scalp off.  Indeed this dreadful cruelty is sometimes practised before death has occurred.  The scalp with its lock of hair is taken home by the victor, and hung up in his tent as a trophy of war.  The man who can show the greatest number of scalps is considered the greatest warrior.  The dresses of Indian warriors are usually fringed with human scalp-locks.  \"That's a bad business,\" said Jasper, who was concerned to hear such news of his intended father-in-law.  \"Do ye know the name o' this red-skinned rascal?\"  \"I heard it mentioned,\" said the guide, \"but I can't remember it at this moment.\"  \"The boats are ready to start,\" said one of the steersmen, coming up just then.  \"Very good, let the men embark.  Now, Jasper, we must part.  Give us a shake o' your hand.  A pleasant trip to you.\"  \"The same to you, friend,\" said Jasper, returning the guide's squeeze.  In another minute the boats were away.  \"Now, friends, we shall start,\" said Jasper, breaking the deep silence which followed the departure of the brigade.  \"Good,\" said Arrowhead.  \"I'm ready,\" said Heywood.  The canoe was soon in the water, and the men in their places; but they started that morning without a song.  Arrowhead was never inclined to be noisy, Heywood was sleepy, and Jasper was rendered anxious by what he had heard of his friends at Fort Erie, so they paddled away in silence.    CHAPTER NINE.  THE FORT, AND AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.  We turn now to a very different scene.  It is a small fort or trading-post on the banks of a stream which flows through the prairie. The fort is very much like the one which has been already described, but somewhat stronger; and there are four block-houses or bastions, one at each corner, from which the muzzles of a few heavy guns may be seen protruding.  The trees and bushes have been cleared away from around this fort, and the strips of forest-land, which run along both sides of the river, are not so thickly wooded, as the country through which the reader has hitherto been travelling.  In front of the fort rolls the river. Immediately behind it lies the boundless prairie, which extends like a sea of grass, with scarcely a tree or bush upon it, as far as the eye can reach.  This is Fort Erie.  You might ride for many days over that prairie without seeing anything of the forest, except a clump of trees and bushes here and there, and now and then a little pond.  The whole region is extremely beautiful. One that ought to fill the hearts of men with admiration and love of the bountiful God who formed it.  But men in those regions, at the time I write of, thought of little beauties of nature, and cared nothing for the goodness of God.  At least this may be truly said of the red-skinned owners of the soil.  It was otherwise with _some_ of the white people who dwelt there.  Three weeks had passed away since the night spent by our friends with the brigade.  It was now a beautiful evening, a little after sunset. The day's work at the fort had been finished, and the men were amusing themselves by racing their horses, of which fine animals there were great numbers at Fort Erie.  Just a little after the sun had gone down, three horsemen appeared on the distant prairie and came bounding at full gallop towards the fort. They were our friends Jasper, Heywood, and Arrowhead.  These adventurous travellers had reached a fort farther down the river two days before, and, having been supplied with horses, had pushed forward by way of the plains.  On entering the belt of woods close to the fort, the horsemen reined in, and rode among the trees more cautiously.  \"Here's the end of our journey at last,\" cried Jasper, on whose bronzed countenance there was a deep flush of excitement and a look of anxiety.  Just as he said this, Jasper's heart appeared to leap into his throat and almost choked him.  Pulling up suddenly, he swallowed his heart, with some difficulty, and said--  \"Hold on, lads.  I'll ride round to the fort by way of the river, for reasons of my own.  Push on, Heywood, with the Indian, and let Mr Pemberton know I'm coming.  See, I will give you the packet of letters we were asked to carry from the fort below.  Now, make haste.\"  Heywood, though a little surprised at this speech, and at the manner of his friend, took the packet in silence and rode swiftly away, followed by the Indian.  When they were gone, Jasper dismounted, tied his horse to a tree, and walked quickly into the woods in another direction.  Now this mysterious proceeding is not difficult to explain.  Jasper had caught sight of a female figure walking under the trees at a considerable distance from the spot where he had pulled up.  He knew that there were none but Indian women at Fort Erie at that time, and that, therefore, the only respectably dressed female at the place must needs be his own Marie Laroche.  Overjoyed at the opportunity thus unexpectedly afforded him of meeting her alone, he hastened forward with a beating heart.  Marie was seated on the stump of a fallen tree when the hunter came up. She was a fair, beautiful woman of about five-and-twenty, with an air of modesty about her which attracted love, yet repelled familiarity.  Many a good-looking and well-doing young fellow had attempted to gain the heart of Marie during the last two years, but without success--for this good reason, that her heart had been gained already.  She was somewhat startled when a man appeared thus suddenly before her. Jasper stood in silence for a few moments, with his arms crossed upon his breast, and gazed earnestly into her face.  As he did not speak, she said--  \"You appear to be a stranger here.  Have you arrived lately?\"  Jasper was for a moment astonished that she did not at once recognise him, and yet he had no reason to be surprised.  Besides the alteration that two years sometimes makes in a man, Jasper had made a considerable alteration on himself.  When Marie last saw him, he had been in the habit of practising the foolish and unnatural custom of shaving; and he had carried it to such an extreme that he shaved off everything-- whiskers, beard, and moustache.  But within a year he had been induced by a wise friend to change his opinion on this subject.  That friend had suggested, that as Providence had caused hair to grow on his cheeks, lips, and chin, it was intended to be worn, and that he had no more right to shave his face than a Chinaman had to shave his head.  Jasper had been so far convinced, that he had"]]]
