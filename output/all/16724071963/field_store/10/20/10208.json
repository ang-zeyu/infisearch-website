Let the men look sharp; we've no time to lose, and hot work is before us.\"  \"I will go for your sword, Father,\" cried Fred, who had just come on deck.  \"Boy, boy, you must go below; you can be of no use here.\"  \"But, Father, you know that I'm not _afraid_.\"  \"I know that, boy; I know it well; but you're too young to fight; you're not strong enough; besides, you must comfort and cheer your mother, she may want you.\"  \"I am old enough and strong enough to load and fire a pistol, Father; and I heard one of the men say we would need all the hands on board, and more if we had them; besides, it was my mother who told me what was going on, and sent me on deck to _help you to fight_.\"  A momentary gleam of pride lit up the countenance of the captain as he said hastily: \"You may stay, then,\" and turned towards the men, who now stood assembled on the quarterdeck.  Addressing the crew in his own blunt, vigorous style, he said: \"Lads, yon rascally schooner is a pirate, as you all know well enough.  I need not ask you if you are ready to fight--I see by your looks you are.  But that's not enough--you must make up your minds to fight _well_.  You know that pirates give no quarter.  I see the decks are swarming with men.  If you don't go at them like bull-dogs you'll walk the plank before sunset, every man of you.  Now, go forward, and double-shot your muskets and pistols, and stick as many of the latter into your belts as they will hold.  Mr Thompson, let the gunner double-shot the four big guns, and load the little carronade with musket balls to the muzzle.  If they do try to board us, they'll get a warm reception.\"  \"There goes a shot, sir,\" said Buzzby, pointing towards the piratical schooner, from the side of which a white cloud burst and a round shot ricochetted over the sea, passing close ahead of the ship.  \"Ay, that's a request for us to lay-to,\" said the captain bitterly, \"but we won't.  Keep her away a point.\"  \"Ay, ay, sir,\" sung out the man at the wheel.  A second and third shot were fired, but passed unheeded, and the captain, fully expecting that the next would be fired into them, ordered the men below.  \"We can't afford to lose a man, Mr Thompson; send them all down.\"  \"Please, sir, may I remain?\" said Buzzby, touching his hat.  \"Obey orders,\" answered the captain sternly.  The sailor went below with a sulky fling.  For nearly an hour the two vessels cut through the water before a steady breeze, during which time the fast-sailing schooner gradually overhauled the heavy West-Indiaman, until she approached within speaking distance. Still Captain Ellice paid no attention to her, but stood with compressed lips beside the man at the wheel, gazing alternately at the sails of his vessel, and at the windward horizon, where he fancied he saw indications that led him to hope the breeze would fail ere long.  As the schooner drew nearer, a man leaped on the hammock-nettings, and, putting a trumpet to his mouth, sang out lustily: \"Ship ahoy, where are you from and what's your cargo?\"  Captain Ellice made no reply, but ordered four of his men on deck to point one of the stern-chasers.  Again the voice came harshly across the waves, as if in passion: \"Heave to, or I'll sink you.\"  At the same moment the black flag was run up to the peak, and a shot passed between the main and fore-mast.  \"Stand by to point this gun,\" said the captain in a subdued voice.  \"Ay, ay, sir!\"  \"Fetch a red-hot iron; luff, luff a little--a little more--steady, so.\" At the last word there was a puff and a roar, and an iron messenger flew towards the schooner.  The gun had been fired more as a reply of defiance to the pirate, than with the hope of doing him any damage, but the shot had been well aimed--it cut the schooner's main-sail-yard in two, and brought it rattling down on deck.  Instantly the pirate yawed and delivered a broadside, but in the confusion on deck the guns were badly aimed, and none took effect.  The time lost in this manoeuvre, added to the crippled condition of the schooner, enabled the West-Indiaman to gain considerably on her antagonist, but the pirate kept up a well-directed fire with his bow-chasers, and many of the shots struck the hull, and cut the rigging seriously.  As the sun descended towards the horizon the wind fell gradually, and ceased at length altogether, so that both vessels lay rolling on the swell with their sails flapping idly against the masts.  \"They're a gittin' out the boats, sir,\" remarked John Buzzby, who, unable to restrain himself any longer, had crept upon deck at the risk of another reprimand; \"and, if my eyes be'nt deceiving me, there's a sail on the horizon to wind'ard--leastways, the direction which _wos_ wind'ard afore it fell calm.\"  \"She's bringing a breeze along with her,\" remarked the captain, \"but I fear the boats will come up before it reaches us.  There are three in the water, and manned already.  There they come.  Now, then, call up all hands.\"  In a few seconds the crew of the West-Indiaman were at their stations, ready for action, and Captain Ellice, with Fred at his elbow, stood beside one of the stern-chasers.  Meanwhile, the boats of the pirate-- five in number--pulled away in different directions, evidently with the intention of attacking the ship at different points.  They were full of men armed to the teeth.  While they rowed towards the ship the schooner resumed its fire, and one ball cut away the spanker boom, and slightly wounded two of the men with splinters.  The guns of the ship were now brought to bear on the boats, but without effect, although the shot plunged into the water all round them.  As they drew nearer, a brisk fire of musketry was opened on them, and the occasional falling of an oar and confusion on board showed that the shots told.  The pirates replied vigorously, but without effect, as the men of the ship were sheltered by the bulwarks.  \"Pass the word to load and reserve fire,\" said the captain, \"and hand me a musket, Fred.  Load again as fast as I fire.\"  So saying, the captain took aim, and fired at the steersman of the largest boat, which pulled towards the stern.  \"Another, Fred--\"  At this moment a withering volley was poured upon the boat, and a savage yell of agony followed, while the rowers--who remained unhurt--paused for an instant as if paralysed.  Next instant they recovered, and another stroke would have brought them almost alongside, when Captain Ellice pointed the little carronade and fired.  There was a terrific crash, the gun recoiled violently to the other side of the deck, and the pirate boat sank, leaving the sea covered with dead and wounded men.  A number, however, who seemed to bear charmed lives, seized their cutlasses with their teeth, and swam boldly for the ship.  This incident, unfortunately, attracted too much of the attention of the crew, and, ere they could prevent it, another boat reached the bow of the ship, the crew of which sprang up the side like cats, formed on the forecastle, and poured a volley upon the men.  \"Follow me, lads,\" shouted the captain, as he sprang forward like a tiger.  The first man he reached fell by a ball from his pistol; in another moment the opposing parties met in a hand-to-hand conflict. Meanwhile Fred, having been deeply impressed with the effect of the shot from the little carronade, succeeded in raising and reloading it.  He had scarcely accomplished this when one of the boats reached the larboard quarter, and two of the men sprang up the side.  Fred observed them, and felled the first with a handspike before he reached the deck, but the pirate who instantly followed, would have killed him, had he not been observed by the second mate, who had prevented several of the men from joining in the melee on the forecastle, in order to meet such an emergency as this.  Rushing to the rescue with his party, he drove the pirates back into the boat, which was immediately pulled towards the bow, where the other two boats were now grappling and discharging their crews on the forecastle.  Although the men of the West-Indiaman fought with desperate courage, they could not stand before the increasing numbers of pirates, who now crowded the forepart of the ship in a dense mass.  Gradually they were beaten back, and at length were brought to bay on the quarter-deck.  \"Help, Father!\" cried Fred, pushing through the struggling crowd, \"here's the carronade ready loaded.\"  \"Ha! boy, well done!\" cried the captain, seizing the gun, and, with the help of Buzzby, who never left his side, dragging it forward.  \"Clear the way, lads!\"  In a moment the little cannon was pointed to the centre of the mass of men, and fired.  One awful shriek of agony rose above the din of the fight, as a wide gap was cut through the crowd; but this only seemed to render the survivors more furious.  With a savage yell they charged the quarter-deck, but were hurled back again and again by the captain, and a few chosen men who stood around him.  At length one of the pirates, who had been all along conspicuous for his strength and daring, stepped deliberately up, and, pointing a pistol at the captain's breast, fired. Captain Ellice fell, and at the same moment a ball laid the pirate low; another charge was made; Fred rushed forward to protect his father, but was thrown down and trodden under foot in the rush, and in two minutes more the ship was in possession of the pirates.  Being filled with rage at the opposition they had met with, these villains proceeded, as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21711"],["title","The World of Ice (#2)"],["body","said, to make short work of the crew, while several of them sprang into the cabin, where they discovered Mrs Ellice almost dead with terror.  Dragging her violently on deck, they were about to cast her into the sea, when Buzzby, who stood with his hands bound, suddenly burst his bonds and sprang towards her.  A blow from the butt of a pistol, however, stretched him insensible on the deck.  \"Where is my husband?--my boy?\" screamed Mrs Ellice wildly.  \"They've gone before you, or they'll soon follow,\" said a savage fiercely, as he raised her in his powerful arms, and hurled her overboard.  A loud shriek was followed by a heavy plunge.  At the same moment two of the men raised the captain, intending to throw him overboard also, when a loud boom arrested their attention, and a cannon-shot ploughed up the sea close in front of their bows.  While the fight was raging, no one had observed the fact that the breeze had freshened, and a large man-of-war, with American colours at her peak, was now within gunshot of the ship.  No sooner did the pirates make this discovery than they rushed to their boats, with the intention of pulling to their schooner, but those who had been left in charge, seeing the approach of the man-of-war, and feeling that there was no chance of escape for their comrades, or, as is more than probable, being utterly indifferent about them, crowded all sail, and slipped away, and it was now hull-down on the horizon to leeward.  The men in the boats rowed after her with the energy of despair, but the Americans gave chase, and we need scarcely add that, in a very short time, all were captured.  When the man-of-war rejoined the West-Indiaman, the night had set in and a stiff breeze had arisen, so that the long and laborious search that was made for the body of poor Mrs Ellice, proved utterly fruitless. Captain Ellice, whose wound was very severe, was struck down as if by a thunderbolt, and for a long time his life was despaired of.  During his illness Fred nursed him with the utmost tenderness, and, in seeking to comfort his father, found some relief to his own stricken heart.  Months passed away.  Captain Ellice was conveyed to the residence of his sister in Grayton, and, under her care, and the nursing of his little niece, Isobel, he recovered his wonted health and strength.  To the eyes of men, Captain Ellice and his son were themselves again, but those who judge of men's hearts by their outward appearance and expressions, in nine cases out of ten judge very wide of the mark indeed.  Both had undergone a great change.  The brilliancy and glitter of this world had been completely and rudely dispelled, and both had been led to enquire whether there was not something better to live for than mere present advantage and happiness; something that would stand by them in those hours of sickness and sorrow which must inevitably, sooner or later, come upon all men.  But Captain Ellice could not be induced to resume the command of his old ship, or voyage again to the West Indies.  He determined to change the scene of his future labours and sail to the frozen seas, where the aspect of every object--even the ocean itself--would be very unlikely to recall the circumstances of his loss.  Some time after his recovery, Captain Ellice purchased a brig, and fitted her out as a whaler, determined to try his fortune in the northern seas.  Fred pleaded hard to be taken out, but his father felt that he had more need to go to school than to sea; so he refused, and Fred, after sighing very deeply once or twice, gave in with a good grace.  Buzzby, too, who stuck to his old commander like a leech, was equally anxious to go, but Buzzby, in a sudden and unaccountable fit of tenderness, had, just two months before, married a wife, who might be appropriately described as \"fat, fair, and forty,\" and Buzzby's wife absolutely forbade him to go.  Alas!  Buzzby was no longer his own master.  At the age of forty-five he became--as he himself expressed it--an abject slave, and he would as soon have tried to steer in a slipper bath, right in the teeth of an equinoctial hurricane, as have opposed the will of his wife.  He used to sigh gruffly when spoken to on this subject, and compare himself to a Dutch galliot that made more lee-way than head-way, even with a wind on the quarter.  \"Once,\" he would remark, \"I was clipper-built and could sail right in the wind's eye, but ever since I tuck this craft in tow I've gone to leeward like a tub.  In fact, I find there's only one way of going ahead with my Poll, and that is right before the wind!  I used to yaw about a good deal at first, but she tuck that out o' me in a day or two.  If I put the helm only so much as one stroke to starboard, she guv' a tug at the tow-rope that brought the wind dead aft again; so I've gi'n it up, and lashed the tiller right amidships.\"  So Buzzby did not accompany his old commander; he did not even so much as suggest the possibility of it, but he shook his head with great solemnity as he stood with Fred, and Mrs Bright, and Isobel, at the end of the pier, gazing at the brig, with one eye very much screwed up, and a wistful expression in the other, while the graceful craft spread out her canvas and bent over to the breeze.    CHAPTER TWO.  DEPARTURE OF THE POLE STAR FOR THE FROZEN SEAS--SAGE REFLECTIONS OF MRS. BRIGHT, AND SAGACIOUS REMARKS OF BUZZBY--ANXIETIES, FEARS, SURMISES, AND RESOLUTIONS--ISOBEL--A SEARCH PROPOSED--DEPARTURE OF THE DOLPHIN FOR THE FAR NORTH.  Digressions are bad at the best, and we feel some regret that we should have been compelled to begin our book with one; but they are necessary evils, sometimes, so we must ask our reader's forgiveness, and beg him, or her, to remember that we are still at the commencement of our story, standing at the end of the pier, and watching the departure of the _Pole Star_ whale-ship, which is now a scarcely distinguishable speck on the horizon.  As it disappeared Buzzby gave a grunt, Fred and Isobel uttered a sigh in unison, and Mrs Bright resumed the fit of weeping which for some time she had unconsciously suspended.  \"I fear we shall never see him again,\" sobbed Mrs Bright, as she took Isobel by the hand and sauntered slowly home, accompanied by Fred and Buzzby, the latter of whom seemed to regard himself in the light of a shaggy Newfoundland or mastiff, who had been left to protect the family. \"We are always hearing of whale-ships being lost, and, somehow or other, we _never_ hear of the crews being saved, as one reads of when ships are wrecked in the usual way on the sea-shore.\"  Isobel squeezed her mother's hand, and looked up in her face with an expression that said plainly: \"Don't cry so, Mamma, I'm _sure_ he will come back,\" but she could not find words to express herself, so she glanced towards the mastiff for help.  Buzzby felt that it devolved upon him to afford consolation under the circumstances, but Mrs Bright's mind was of that peculiar stamp which repels advances in the way of consolation unconsciously, and Buzzby was puzzled.  He screwed up first the right eye and then the left, and smote his thigh repeatedly; and assuredly, if contorting his visage could have comforted Mrs Bright, she would have returned home a happy woman, for he made faces at her violently for full five minutes; but it did her no good, perhaps because she didn't see him, her eyes being suffused with tears.  \"Ah! yes,\" resumed Mrs Bright, with another burst, \"I _know_ they will never come back, and your silence shows that you think so too; and to think of their taking two years' provisions with them _in case of accidents_!--doesn't that prove that there are _going_ to be accidents? and didn't I hear one of the sailors say that she was a crack ship, a number one?  I don't know what he meant by a number one; but if she's a cracked ship I _know_ she will never come back; and although I told my dear brother of it, and advised him not to go, he only laughed at me, which was very unkind, I'm sure--\"  Here Mrs Bright's feelings overcame her again.  \"Why, Aunt,\" said Fred, scarce able to restrain a laugh, despite the sadness that lay at his heart, \"when the sailor said it was a crack ship, he meant that it was a _good_ one, a first-rate one.\"  \"Then why did he not say what he meant?  But you are talking nonsense, boy; do you think that I will believe a man means to say a thing is good when he calls it cracked? and I'm sure nobody would say a cracked tea-pot was as good as a whole one; but tell me, Buzzby, do you think they ever _will_ come back?\"  \"Why, ma'am, in coorse I do,\" replied Buzzby vehemently; \"for why? if they don't, they're the first that ever went out o' this port in my day as didn't.  They've a good ship and lots o' grub, and it's like to be a good season; and Captain Ellice has, for the most part, good luck; and they've started with a fair wind, and kep' clear of a Friday, and what more could ye wish?  I only wish as I was aboard along with them, that's all.\"  Buzzby delivered himself of this oration with the left eye shut and screwed up, and the right one open.  Having concluded, he shut and screwed up the right eye, and opened the left--he reversed the engine, so to speak, as if he wished to back out from the scene of his triumph, and leave the course clear for others to speak.  But his words were thrown away on Mrs Bright, who was emphatically a weak-minded woman, and never exercised her reason at all, except in a spasmodic, galvanic sort of way, when she sought to defend or to advocate some unreasonable conclusion of some sort, at which her own weak mind had arrived somehow. So she shook her head, and sobbed good-bye to Buzzby, as she ascended the sloping avenue that led to her pretty cottage, on the green hill that overlooked the harbour and the sea beyond.  As for John Buzzby, having been absent from home full half an hour beyond his usual dinner-hour, he felt that, for a man who had lashed his helm amidships, he "]]]
