He was breathless, hatless, moist, and frantic.  \"My child! my darling! my dear Di!\" he gasped.  \"Papa!\" responded Diana, with a little scream, and, leaping into his arms, grasped him in a genuine hug.  \"Oh!  I say,\" whispered the small butcher, \"it's a melly-drammy--all for nuffin!\"  \"My!\" responded the small baker, with a solemn look, \"won't the Lord left-tenant be down on 'em for play-actin' without a licence, just!\"  \"Is the pony killed?\" inquired Sir Richard, recovering himself.  \"Not in the least, sir.  'Ere 'e is, sir; all alive an' kickin',\" answered the small butcher, delighted to have the chance of making himself offensively useful, \"but the hinsurance offices wouldn't 'ave the clo'se-baskit at no price.  Shall I order up the remains of your carriage, sir?\"  \"Oh!  I'm so glad he's not dead,\" said Diana, looking hastily up, \"but this policeman was nearly killed, and _I_ did it!  He saved my life, papa.\"  A chorus of voices here explained to Sir Richard how Number 666 had come up in the nick of time to receive the flying child upon his bosom.  \"I am deeply grateful to you,\" said the knight, turning to the constable, and extending his hand, which the latter shook modestly while disclaiming any merit for having merely performed his duty--he might say, involuntarily.  \"Will you come to my house?\" said Sir Richard.  \"Here is my card.  I should like to see you again, and pray, see that some one looks after my pony and--\"  \"And the remains,\" suggested the small butcher, seeing that Sir Richard hesitated.  \"Be so good as to call a cab,\" said Sir Richard in a general way to any one who chose to obey.  \"Here you are, sir!\" cried a peculiarly sharp cabby, who, correctly judging from the state of affairs that his services would be required, had drawn near to bide his time.  Sir Richard and his little daughter got in and were driven home, leaving Number 666 to look after the pony and the remains.  Thus curiously were introduced to each other some of the characters in our tale.    CHAPTER TWO.  THE IRRESISTIBLE POWER OF LOVE.  Need we remark that there was a great deal of embracing on the part of Di and her nurse when the former returned home?  The child was an affectionate creature as well as passionate.  The nurse, Mrs Screwbury, was also affectionate without being passionate.  Poor Diana had never known a mother's love or care; but good, steady, stout Mrs Screwbury did what in her lay to fill the place of mother.  Sir Richard filled the place of father pretty much as a lamp-post might have done had it owned a child.  He illuminated her to some extent-- explained things in general, stiffly, and shed a feeble ray around himself; but his light did not extend far.  He was proud of her, however, and very fond of her--when good.  When not good, he was--or rather had been--in the habit of dismissing her to the nursery.  Nevertheless, the child exercised very considerable and ever-increasing influence over her father; for, although stiff, the knight was by no means destitute of natural affection, and sometimes observed, with moist eyes, strong traces of resemblance to his lost wife in the beautiful child.  Indeed, as years advanced, he became a more and more obedient father, and was obviously on the high road to abject slavery.  \"Papa,\" said Di, while they were at luncheon that day, not long after the accident, \"I _am_ so sorry for that poor policeman.  It seems such a dreadful thing to have actually jumped upon him! and oh! you should have heard his poor head hit the pavement, and seen his pretty helmet go spinning along like a boy's top, ever so far.  I wonder it didn't kill him.  I'm _so_ sorry.\"  Di emphasised her sorrow by laughing, for she had a keen sense of the ludicrous, and the memory of the spinning helmet was strong upon her just then.  \"It must indeed have been an unpleasant blow,\" replied Sir Richard, gravely, \"but then, dear, you couldn't help it, you know--and I dare say he is none the worse for it now.  Men like him are not easily injured. I fear we cannot say as much for the boy who was holding the pony.\"  \"Oh!  I quite forgot about him,\" exclaimed Di; \"the naughty boy! he wouldn't let go the pony's reins when I bid him, but I saw he tumbled down when we set off.\"  \"Yes, he has been somewhat severely punished, I fear, for his disobedience.  His leg had been broken.  Is it not so, Balls?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" replied the butler, \"'e 'as 'ad 'is--\"  Balls got no farther, for Diana, who had been struck dumb for the moment by the news, recovered herself.  \"His leg broken!\" she exclaimed with a look of consternation; \"Oh! the poor, poor boy!--the dear boy! and it was me did that too, as well as knocking down the poor policeman!\"  There is no saying to what lengths the remorseful child would have gone in the way of self-condemnation if her father had not turned her thoughts from herself by asking what had been done for the boy.  \"We sent 'im 'ome, sir, in a cab.\"  \"I'm afraid that was a little too prompt,\" returned the knight thoughtfully.  \"A broken leg requires careful treatment, I suppose.  You should have had him into the house, and sent for a doctor.\"  Balls coughed.  He was slightly chagrined to find that the violation of his own humane feelings had been needless, and that his attempt to do as he thought his master would have wished was in vain.  \"I thought, Sir Richard, that you didn't like the lower orders to go about the 'ouse more--\"  Again little Di interrupted the butler by asking excitedly where the boy's home was.  \"In the neighbour'ood of W'itechapel, Miss Di.\"  \"Then, papa, we will go straight off to see him,\" said the child, in the tone of one whose mind is fully made up.  \"You and I shall go together-- won't we? good papa!\"  \"That will do, Balls, you may go.  No, my dear Di, I think we had better not.  I will write to one of the city missionaries whom I know, and ask him to--\"  \"No, but, papa--dear papa, we _must_ go.  The city missionary could never say how very, _very_ sorry I am that he should have broken his leg while helping me.  And then I should _so_ like to sit by him and tell him stories, and give him his soup and gruel, and read to him.  Poor, _poor_ boy, we _must_ go, papa, won't you?\"  \"Not to-day, dear.  It is impossible to go to-day.  There, now, don't begin to cry.  Perhaps--perhaps to-morrow--but think, my love; you have no idea how dirty--how _very_ nasty--the places are in which our lower orders live.\"  \"Oh! yes I have,\" said Di eagerly.  \"Haven't I seen our nursery on cleaning days?\"  A faint flicker of a smile passed over the knight's countenance.  \"True, darling, but the places are far, far dirtier than that.  Then the smells.  Oh! they are very dreadful--\"  \"What--worse than _we_ have when there's cabbage for dinner?\"  \"Yes, much worse than that.\"  \"I don't care, papa.  We _must_ go to see the boy--the poor, _poor_ boy, in spite of dirt and smells.  And then, you know--let me up on your knee and I'll tell you all about it.  There!  Well, then, you know, I'd tidy the room up, and even wash it a little.  Oh, you can't think how nicely I washed up my doll's room--her corner, you know,--that day when I spilt all her soup in trying to feed her, and then, while trying to wipe it up, I accidentally burst her, and all her inside came out--the sawdust, I mean.  It was the worst mess I ever made, but I cleaned it up as well as Jessie herself could have done--so nurse said.\"  \"But the messes down in Whitechapel are much worse than you have described, dear,\" expostulated the parent, who felt that his powers of resistance were going.  \"So much the better, papa,\" replied Di, kissing her sire's lethargic visage.  \"I should like _so_ much to try if I could clean up something worse than my doll's room.  And you've promised, you know.\"  \"No--only said `perhaps,'\" returned Sir Richard quickly.  \"Well, that's the same thing; and now that it's all nicely settled, I'll go and see nurse.  Good-bye, papa.\"  \"Good-bye, dear,\" returned the knight, resigning himself to his fate and the newspaper.    CHAPTER THREE.  POVERTY MANAGES TO BOARD OUT HER INFANT FOR NOTHING.  On the night of the day about which we have been writing, a woman, dressed in \"unwomanly rags\" crept out of the shadow of the houses near London Bridge.  She was a thin, middle-aged woman, with a countenance from which sorrow, suffering, and sin had not been able to obliterate entirely the traces of beauty.  She carried a bundle in her arms which was easily recognisable as a baby, from the careful and affectionate manner in which the woman's thin, out-spread fingers grasped it.  Hurrying on to the bridge till she reached the middle of one of the arches, she paused and looked over.  The Thames was black and gurgling, for it was intensely dark, and the tide half ebb at the time.  The turbid waters chafed noisily on the stone piers as if the sins and sorrows of the great city had been somehow communicated to them.  But the distance from the parapet to the surface of the stream was great.  It seemed awful in the woman's eyes.  She shuddered and drew back.  \"Oh! for courage--only for one minute!\" she murmured, clasping the bundle closer to her breast.  The action drew off a corner of the scanty rag which she called a shawl, and revealed a small and round, yet exceedingly thin face, the black eyes of which seemed to gaze in solemn wonder at the scene of darkness visible which was revealed.  The woman stood between two lamps in the darkest place she could find, but enough of light reached her to glitter in the baby's solemn eyes as they met her gaze, and it made a pitiful attempt to smile as it recognised its mother.  \"God help me!  I can't,\" muttered the woman with a shiver, as if an ice-block had touched her heart.  She drew the rag hastily over the baby's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21729"],["title","Dusty Diamonds Cut and Polished: A Tale of City Arab Life and Adventure (#3)"],["body","again, pressed it closer to her breast, retraced her steps, and dived into the shadows from which she had emerged.  This was one of the \"lower orders\" to whom Sir Richard Brandon had such an objection, whom he found it, he said, so difficult to deal with, (no wonder, for he never tried to deal with them at all, in any sense worthy of the name), and whom it was, he said, useless to assist, because all _he_ could do in such a vast accumulation of poverty would be a mere drop in the bucket.  Hence Sir Richard thought it best to keep the drop in his pocket where it could be felt and do good--at least to himself, rather than dissipate it in an almost empty bucket.  The bucket, however, was not quite empty--thanks to a few thousands of people who differed from the knight upon that point.  The thin woman hastened through the streets as regardless of passers-by as they were of her, until she reached the neighbourhood of Commercial Street, Spitalfields.  Here she paused and looked anxiously round her.  She had left the main thoroughfare, and the spot on which she stood was dimly lighted. Whatever she looked or waited for, did not, however, soon appear, for she stood under a lamp-post, muttering to herself, \"I _must_ git rid of it.  Better to do so than see it starved to death before my eyes.\"  Presently a foot-fall was heard, and a man drew near.  The woman gazed intently into his face.  It was not a pleasant face.  There was a scowl on it.  She drew back and let him pass.  Then several women passed, but she took no notice of them.  Then another man appeared.  His face seemed a jolly one.  The woman stepped forward at once and confronted him.  \"Please, sir,\" she began, but the man was too sharp for her.  \"Come now--you've brought out that baby on purpose to humbug people with it.  Don't fancy you'll throw dust in _my_ eyes.  I'm too old a cock for that.  Don't you know that you're breaking the law by begging?\"  \"I'm _not_ begging,\" retorted the woman, almost fiercely.  \"Oh! indeed.  Why do you stop me, then?\"  \"I merely wished to ask if your name is Thompson.\"  \"Ah hem!\" ejaculated the man with a broad grin, \"well no, madam, my name is _not_ Thompson.\"  \"Well, then,\" rejoined the woman, still indignantly, \"you may move on.\"  She had used an expression all too familiar to herself, and the man, obeying the order with a bow and a mocking laugh, disappeared like those who had gone before him.  For some time no one else appeared save a policeman.  When he approached, the woman went past him down the street, as if bent on some business, but when he was out of sight she returned to the old spot, which was near the entrance to an alley.  At last the woman's patience was rewarded by the sight of a burly little elderly man, whose face of benignity was unmistakably genuine. Remembering the previous man's reference to the baby, she covered it up carefully, and held it more like a bundle.  Stepping up to the newcomer at once, she put the same question as to name, and also asked if he lived in Russell Square.  \"No, my good woman,\" replied the burly little man, with a look of mingled surprise and pity, \"my name is _not_ Thompson.  It is Twitter-- Samuel Twitter, of Twitter, Slime and--, but,\" he added, checking himself, under a sudden and rare impulse of prudence, \"why do you ask my name and address?\"  The woman gave an almost hysterical laugh at having been so successful in her somewhat clumsy scheme, and, without uttering another word, darted down the alley.  She passed rapidly round by a back way to another point of the same street she had left--well ahead of the spot where she had stood so long and so patiently that night.  Here she suddenly uncovered the baby's face and kissed it passionately for a few moments.  Then, wrapping it in the ragged shawl, with its little head out, she laid it on the middle of the footpath full in the light of a lamp, and retired to await the result.  When the woman rushed away, as above related, Mr Samuel Twitter stood for some minutes rooted to the spot, lost in amazement.  He was found in that condition by the returning policeman.  \"Constable,\" said he, cocking his hat to one side the better to scratch his bald head, \"there are strange people in this region.\"  \"Indeed there are, sir.\"  \"Yes, but I mean _very_ strange people.\"  \"Well, sir, if you insist on it, I won't deny that some of them are _very_ strange.\"  \"Yes, well--good-night, constable,\" said Mr Twitter, moving slowly forward in a mystified state of mind, while the guardian of the night continued his rounds, thinking to himself that he had just parted from one of the very strangest of the people.  Suddenly Samuel Twitter came to a full stop, for there lay the small baby gazing at him with its solemn eyes, apparently quite indifferent to the hardness and coldness of its bed of stone.  \"Abandoned!\" gasped the burly little man.  Whether Mr Twitter referred to the infant's moral character, or to its being shamefully forsaken, we cannot now prove, but he instantly caught the bundle in his arms and gazed at it.  Possibly his gaze may have been too intense, for the mild little creature opened a small mouth that bore no proportion whatever to the eyes, and attempted to cry, but the attempt was a failure.  It had not strength to cry.  The burly little man's soul was touched to the centre by the sight.  He kissed the baby's forehead, pressed it to his ample breast, and hurried away.  If he had taken time to think he might have gone to a police-office, or a night refuge, or some such haven of rest for the weary, but when Twitter's feelings were touched he became a man of impulse.  He did not take time to think--except to the extent that, on reaching the main thoroughfare, he hailed a cab and was driven home.  The poor mother had followed him with the intention of seeing him home. Of course the cab put an end to that.  She felt comparatively easy, however, knowing, as she did, that her child was in the keeping of \"Twitter, Slime and ---.\"  That was quite enough to enable her to trace Mr Twitter out.  Comforting herself as well as she could with this reflection, she sat down in a dark corner on a cold door-step, and, covering her face with both hands, wept as though her heart would break.  Gradually her sobs subsided, and, rising, she hurried away, shivering with cold, for her thin cotton dress was a poor protection against the night chills, and her ragged shawl was--gone with the baby.  In a few minutes she reached a part of the Whitechapel district where some of the deepest poverty and wretchedness in London is to be found. Turning into a labyrinth of small streets and alleys, she paused in the neighbourhood of the court in which was her home--if such it could be called.  \"Is it worth while going back to him?\" she muttered.  \"He nearly killed baby, and it wouldn't take much to make him kill me.  And oh! he was so different--once!\"  While she stood irresolute, the man of whom she spoke chanced to turn the corner, and ran against her, somewhat roughly.  \"Hallo! is that you?\" he demanded, in tones that told too clearly where he had been spending the night.  \"Yes, Ned, it's me.  I was just thinking about going home.\"  \"Home, indeed--'stime to b'goin' home.  Where'v you bin?  The babby 'll 'v bin squallin' pretty stiff by this time.\"  \"No fear of baby now,\" returned the wife almost defiantly; \"it's gone.\"  \"Gone!\" almost shouted the husband.  \"You haven't murdered it, have you?\"  \"No, but I've put it in safe keeping, where _you_ can't get at it, and, now I know that, I don't care what you do to _me_.\"  \"Ha! we'll see about that.  Come along.\"  He seized the woman by the arm and hurried her towards their dwelling.  It was little better than a cellar, the door being reached by a descent of five or six much-worn steps.  To the surprise of the couple the door, which was usually shut at that hour, stood partly open, and a bright light shone within.  \"Wastin' coal and candle,\" growled the man with an angry oath, as he approached.  \"Hetty didn't use to be so extravagant,\" remarked the woman, in some surprise.  As she spoke the door was flung wide open, and an overgrown but very handsome girl peered out.  \"Oh! father, I thought it was your voice,\" she said.  \"Mother, is that you?  Come in, quick.  Here's Bobby brought home in a cab with a broken leg.\"  On hearing this the man's voice softened, and, entering the room, he went up to a heap of straw in one corner whereon our little friend Bobby Frog--the street-Arab--lay.  \"Hallo!  Bobby, wot's wrong with 'ee?  You ain't used to come to grief,\" said the father, laying his hand on the boy's shoulder, and giving him a rough shake.  Things oftentimes \"are not what they seem.\"  The shake was the man's mode of expressing sympathy, for he was fond of his son, regarding him, with some reason, as a most hopeful pupil in the ways of wickedness.  \"It's o' no use, father,\" said the boy, drawing his breath quickly and knitting his brows, \"you can't stir me up with a long pole now.  I'm past that.\"  \"What! have 'ee bin runned over?\"  \"No--on'y run down, or knocked down.\"  \"Who did it?  On'y give me his name an' address, an' as sure as my name's Ned I'll--\"  He finished the sentence with a sufficiently expressive scowl and clenching of a huge fist, which had many a time done great execution in the prize ring.  \"It wasn't a he, father, it was a she.\"  \"Well, no matter, if I on'y had my fingers on her windpipe I'd squeeze it summat.\"  \"If you did I'd bang your nose!  She didn't go for to do it a-purpose, you old grampus,\" retorted Bobby, intending the remark to be taken as a gentle yet affectionate reproof.  \"A doctor's bin an' set my leg,\" continued the boy, \"an' made it as stiff as a poker wi' what 'e calls splints.  He says I won't be able to go about for ever so many weeks.\"  \"An' who's to feed you, I wonder, doorin' them weeks?  An' who sent for the doctor?  Was it him as supplied the fire an' candle to-night?\"  \"No,"]]]
