His most enthusiastic eulogists are compelled merely to echo the remarks of his earliest and greatest critic, himself. Yet with all this, none of the later critics, not the most cavalier nor the dullest, has dared to call him vain. His estimate of himself, offered as simple fact, has been accepted in the same spirit, and one abyss of ineptitude still yawns for the heroic folly, or the clownish courage, of the New Criticism.     CHAPTER I JOHN MILTON   John Milton, the son of a middle-aged scrivener, was born on Friday, December the 9th, 1608, at his father's house in Bread Street, Cheapside; and died on Sunday, November the 8th, 1674, in a small house, with but one room on a floor, in Artillery Walk, Bunhill Fields, London. Of his father the records that remain show him to have been a convinced member of the Puritan party in the Church, a man of liberal culture and intelligence, a lover of music (which taste Milton inherited), a wise and generous friend to the son who became a poet. We owe it to his wisdom rather than to his prosperity that Milton was allowed to live at home without any ostensible profession until he was thirty years of age and more.  For the first sixteen years of his life Milton was educated partly at home, by a Presbyterian tutor called Thomas Young, partly at St. Paul's School, which he attended for some years as a day-scholar. From his twelfth year onward he was an omnivorous reader, and before he left school had written some boyish verses, void of merit. The next fourteen years of his life, after leaving school, were spent at Cambridge, in Buckinghamshire, and in foreign travel, so that he was thirty years old before he lived continuously in London again.  We know pretty well how he spent his time at Cambridge and at Horton, sedulously turning over the Greek and Latin classics, dreaming of immortality. We know less about his early years in London, where there were wider and better opportunities of gaining an insight into \"all seemly and generous arts and affairs.\" London was a great centre of traffic, a motley crowd of adventurers and traders even in those days, and the boy Milton must often have wandered down to the river below London Bridge to see the ships come in. His poems are singularly full of figures drawn from ships and shipping, some of them bookish in their origin, others which may have been suggested by the sight of ships. Now it is Satan, who, after his fateful journey through chaos, nears the world,    And like a weather-beaten vessel holds   Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn.  Now it is Dalila, whom the Chorus behold approaching.    Like a stately ship   Of Tarsus, bound for the isles   Of Javan or Gadire,   With all her bravery on, and tackle trim,   Sails filled, and streamers waving,   Courted by all the winds that hold them play.  Or, again, it is Samson reproaching himself,    Who, like a foolish pilot, have shipwracked   My vessel trusted to me from above,   Gloriously rigged.  The bulk of Satan is compared to the great sea-beast Leviathan, beheld off the coast of Norway by    The pilot of some small night-founder'd skiff.  In his approach to the happy garden the Adversary is likened to                        them who sail   Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past   Mozambic, off at sea north-east winds blow   Sabaean odours from the spicy shore   Of Araby the Blest, with such delay   Well pleased they slack their course, and many a league   Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles;   So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend.  And when he draws near to Eve in the rose-thicket,                    sidelong he works his way,   As when a ship, by skilful steersman wrought,   Nigh river's mouth, or foreland, where the wind   Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail.  There is nothing here that is not within the reach of any inland reader, but Milton's choice of nautical similitudes may serve to remind us how much of the interest of Old London centred round its port. Here were to be heard those tales of far-sought adventure and peril which gave even to the boisterous life of Elizabethan London an air of triviality and security. Hereby came in \"the variety of fashions and foreign stuffs,\" which Fynes Moryson, writing in Milton's childhood, compares to the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea for number. All sorts of characters, nationalities, and costumes were daily to be seen in Paul's Walk, adjoining Milton's school. One sort interests us pre-eminently. \"In the general pride of England,\" says Fynes Moryson, \"there is no fit difference made of degrees; for very Bankrupts, Players, and Cutpurses go apparelled like gentlemen.\" Shakespeare was alive during the first seven years of Milton's life, and was no doubt sometimes a visitor to the Mermaid, a stone's throw from the scrivener's house. Perhaps his cloak brushed the child Milton in the street. Milton was born in the golden age of the drama, and a score of masterpieces were put upon the London stage while he was in his cradle. But the golden age passed rapidly; the quality of the drama degenerated and the opposition to it grew strong before he was of years to attend a play. Perhaps he never saw a play by the masters during his boyhood, and his visits            to the well-trod stage anon,   If Jonson's learned sock be on,   Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,   Warble his native woodnotes wild,  were either excursions of the imagination or belong to his later occasional sojourns in London. In his _Eikonoklastes_ he quotes certain lines from _Richard III._, and here and there in his prose, as well as in his verse, there are possibly some faint reminiscences of Shakespearian phrases. So, for instance, in _The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce_, he seems to echo a famous speech of Macbeth, while he claims that his remedy of free divorce \"hath the virtue to soften and dispel rooted and knotty sorrows, and without enchantment.\" But these are doubtless the memories of reading. In the _Apology for Smectymnuus_, when he has to reply to the charge that he \"haunted playhouses\" during his college days, he retorts the charge, it is true, rather than denies it. Yet the retort bespeaks a certain severity and preciseness in judging of plays and their actors, which can hardly have found gratification in the licenses and exuberances of the contemporary drama. It was not difficult, he remarks, to see plays, \"when in the Colleges so many of the young divines, and those in next aptitude to divinity, have been seen so often upon the stage, writhing and unboning their clergy limbs to all the antic and dishonest gestures of Trinculoes, buffoons, and bawds.\" \"If it be unlawful,\" he continues, \"to sit and behold a mercenary comedian personating that which is least unseemly for a hireling to do, how much more blameful is it to endure the sight of as vile things acted by persons either entered, or presently to enter into the ministry; and how much more foul and ignominious for them to be the actors!\"  It was, at least, a happy chance that the first of Milton's verses to appear in print should have been _An Epitaph on the Admirable Dramatick Poet, W. Shakespeare_, contributed to the Second Folio in 1632. The main interests of the household at the Spread Eagle in Bread Street must have been far enough remote from the doings of the companies of players. John Milton the elder would probably have agreed with Sir Thomas Bodley, who called plays \"riffe-raffes,\" and declared that they should never come into his library. The Hampton Court Conference, the Synod of Dort, the ever-widening divisions in the Church, between Arminian and Calvinist, between Prelatist and Puritan, were probably subjects of a nearer interest, even to the poet in his youth, than the production of new or old plays upon the stage. Milton's childhood was spent in the very twilight of the Elizabethan age; it was greatly fortunate for him, and for us, that he caught the after-glow of the sunset upon his face. He read Spenser while Spenser was still the dominant influence in English poetry. \"He hath confessed to me,\" said Dryden, \"that Spenser was his original,\"--an incredible statement unless we understand \"original\" in the sense of his earliest admiration, his poetic godfather who first won him to poetry. He read Shakespeare and Jonson in the first editions. He read Sylvester's translation of _Du Bartas, His Divine Weekes and Workes_; and perhaps thence conceived the first vague idea of a poem on a kindred subject. It is necessary to insist on his English masters, because, although the greater part of his time and study was devoted to the classics, the instrument that he was to use was learned in a native school. His metre, his magnificent vocabulary, his unerring phraseology, took learning and practice. He attached a high value to his study of English poetry. When he spoke of \"our sage and serious Spenser (whom I dare be known to think a better teacher than Scotus or Aquinas),\" he was conscious that he was maintaining what seemed a bold paradox in an age when scholasticism still controlled education. It is pleasant to think of Milton during these early years, whether in London or at Christ's College, in his \"calm and pleasing solitariness, fed with cheerful and confident thoughts,\" before ever he had a hint that he must perforce \"embark in a troubled sea of noises and hoarse disputes, put from beholding the bright countenance of truth in the quiet and still air of delightful studies.\" From the first, we may be sure, he read the poets as one poet reads another, and apprenticed himself to them for their craft. He was never drawn out of the highroad of art by the minuter and more entangling allurements of scholarship. In one of his Divorce pamphlets he tells, with the inevitable touch of pride, how he never could delight in long citations,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21677"],["title","Milton (#3)"],["body","less in whole traductions, \"whether it be natural disposition or education in me, or that my mother bore me a speaker of what God made mine own, and not a translator.\"  Milton was intended by his family, and by his own early resolves, for the service of the Church. The growing unrest, therefore, in matters ecclesiastical during the early part of the seventeenth century could not but affect him. The various parties and tendencies in the Church of England had never, since the Reformation, attained to a condition of stable equilibrium. But the settlement under Elizabeth was strengthened, and the parties bound together for thirty years, by the ever-present fear of Rome. When that fear was allayed, and the menace that hung over the very existence of the nation removed by the defeat of the Armada, the differences within the Church broke out afresh, and waxed fiercer every year. Shakespeare grew to manhood during the halcyon years between the Marian persecutions and the Marprelate pamphlets--a kind of magic oasis, which gave us our English Renaissance. Milton's youth breathed a very different air. The Church, as it was, pleased hardly any party. Much of the old temple had been hastily pulled down; the new government offices that were to replace it had as yet been but partially built, and commanded no general approval. Considered as a social organisation, moreover, the Church throughout large parts of the country had fallen into a state not unlike decay. Richard Baxter, whose testimony there is no sufficient reason to reject, tells of its state in Shropshire during the years of his youth, from 1615 onwards:--\"We lived in a country that had but little preaching at all: In the Village where I was born there was four Readers successively in Six years time, ignorant Men, and two of them immoral in their lives; who were all my School-masters. In the Village where my Father lived, there was a Reader of about Eighty years of Age that never preached, and had two Churches about Twenty miles distant: His Eyesight failing him, he said Common-Prayer without Book; but for the Reading of the Psalms and Chapters he got a Common Thresher and Day-Labourer one year, and a Taylor another year: (for the Clerk could not read well): And at last he had a Kinsman of his own (the excellentest Stage-player in all the Country, and a good Gamester and good Fellow) that got Orders and supplied one of his Places.... After him another Neighbour's Son took Orders, when he had been a while an Attorney's Clerk, and a common Drunkard, and tipled himself into so great Poverty that he had no other way to live.... These were the School-masters of my Youth ... who read Common Prayer on Sundays and Holy Days, and taught School and tipled on the Weekdays, and whipt the Boys when they were drunk, so that we changed them very oft. Within a few miles about us were near a dozen more Ministers that were near Eighty years old apiece, and never preached; poor ignorant Readers, and most of them of Scandalous Lives.\" Some few there were, Baxter admits, who preached in the neighbourhood, but any one who went to hear them \"was made the Derision of the Vulgar Rabble under the odious Name of a _Puritane_.\"  In one of his Latin letters written from Cambridge, Milton himself speaks of the ignorance of those designed for the profession of divinity, how they knew little or nothing of literature and philosophy. The high prelacy and ritualism of Laud on the one hand, the Puritan movement on the other, each in some measure a protest against this state of things, were at fierce variance with each other, and Milton's ear, from his youth upward, was \"pealed with noises loud and ruinous.\" The age of Shakespeare was irrecoverably past, and it was impossible for any but a few imperturbable Cyrenaics, like Herrick, to \"fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.\" The large indifference of Shakespeare to current politics was impossible for Milton. \"I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician,\" said the folly of Sir Andrew Aguecheek and the wisdom of Shakespeare. But now the Brownists and the politicians had it their own way; and Milton was something of both.  His notable early poems, written at College and during his retreat in Buckinghamshire, have therefore a singular interest and pathos. He was not long for the world in which these poems move with so ineffable a native grace. They are the poems of his youth, instinct with the sensibility of youth, and of a delicate and richly nurtured imagination. But they are also the poems of an age that was closing, and they have a touch of the sadness of evening. \"I know not,\" says Dr. Johnson, speaking of _L'Allegro_ and _Il Penseroso_, \"whether the characters are kept sufficiently apart. No mirth can indeed be found in his melancholy, but I am afraid that I always meet some melancholy in his mirth.\" It is true; for both characters are Milton himself, who embodies in separate poems the cheerful and pensive elements of his own nature--and already his choice is made. There is something disinterested and detached about his sketches of the merriment which he takes part in only as a silent onlooker, compared with the profound sincerity of the lines--    And may at last my weary age   Find out the peaceful hermitage,   The hairy gown and mossy cell,   Where I may sit and rightly spell   Of every star that heaven doth shew,   And every herb that sips the dew,   Till old experience do attain   To something like prophetic strain.  The rising tide of political passion submerged the solemn Arcadia of his early fancies. Like Lycidas, he was carried far from the flowers and the shepherds to visit \"the bottom of the monstrous world.\" Hence there may be made a whole index of themes, touched on by Milton in his early poems, as if in promise, of which no fulfilment is to be found in the greater poems of his maturity. His political career under the Commonwealth is often treated, both by those who applaud and by those who lament it, as if it were the merest interlude between two poetic periods. It was not so; political passion dominates and informs all his later poems, dictating even their subjects. How was it possible for him to choose King Arthur and his Round Table for the subject of his epic, as he had intended in his youthful days; when chivalry and the spirit of chivalry had fought its last fight on English soil, full in the sight of all men, round the forlorn banner of King Charles? The policy of Laud and Stratford kept Milton out of the Church, and sent him into retirement at Horton; the same policy, it may be plausibly conjectured, had something to do with the change in the subject of his long-meditated epic. From the very beginning of the civil troubles contemporary events leave their mark on all his writings. The topical bias (so to call it) is very noticeable in many of the subjects tentatively jotted down by him on the paper that is now in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. The corrupted clergy, who make so splendid and, as some think, so irrelevant an appearance in _Lycidas_, figure frequently, either directly or by implication, in the long list of themes.  Without misgiving or regret, when the time came, Milton shut the gate on the sequestered paradise of his youth, and hastened downward to join the fighters in the plain. Before we follow him we may well \"interpose a little ease\" by looking at some of the beauties proper to the earlier poems, and listening to some of the simple pastoral melodies that were drowned when the organ began to blow. _L'Allegro_ is full of them--    Sometimes, with secure delight,   The upland hamlets will invite,   When the merry bells ring round,   And the jocund rebecks sound   To many a youth and many a maid   Dancing in the chequered shade,   And young and old come forth to play   On a sunshine holiday.  That is Merry England of Shakespeare's time. But already the controversy concerning the _Book of Sports_ had begun to darken the air. Already the Maypole, that \"great stinking idol,\" as an Elizabethan Puritan called it, had been doomed to destruction. Some years before _L'Allegro_ was written, a bard, who hailed from Leeds, had lamented its downfall in the country of his nativity--    Happy the age, and harmelesse were the dayes,     (For then true love and amity was found)   When every village did a May-pole raise,     And Whitson Ales and May games did abound;   And all the lusty Yonkers in a rout   With merry Lasses danced the rod about;   Then friendship to their banquets bid the guests,   And poor men far'd the better for their feasts.  The next verse recalls that scene in _The Winter's Tale_ where Shakespeare draws a vivid picture of Elizabethan country merrymaking--    The Lords of Castles, Manners, Townes, and Towers     Rejoyc'd when they beheld the Farmers flourish,   And would come down unto the Summer-Bowers     To see the Country gallants dance the Morrice,   And sometimes with his tenant's handsome daughter   Would fall in liking, and espouse her after   Unto his Serving-man, and for her portion   Bestow on him some farme, without extortion.    Alas poore Maypoles, what should be the cause     That you were almost banish't from the earth?   You never were rebellious to the lawes,     Your greatest crime was harmelesse honest mirth;   What fell malignant spirit was there found     To cast your tall _Piramides_ to ground?   *      *      *      *      *    And you my native towne, which was of old,     (When as thy Bon-fires burn'd and May-poles stood,   And when thy Wassell-cups were uncontrol'd)     The Summer Bower of Peace and neighbourhood,   Although since these went down, thou ly'st forlorn,   By factious schismes and humours over-borne,   Some able hand I hope thy rod will raise,   That thou maist see once more thy happy daies.  The hopes of the bard of Leeds were fulfilled at the Restoration. Merriment, of a sort, came back to England; but it found no congenial"]]]
