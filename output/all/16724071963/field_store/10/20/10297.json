Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________  Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northen Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\", \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences with the H.B.C.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade, the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the life-boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet, ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.  He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year, all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.  He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".  For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.  Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched, because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each series.  While Ballantyne had some acqaintance with the Eskimo during his years with the Hudson Bay Company, this book runs a little into the fantastical.  The head of the family who are the heroes of the book has the belief that there is a sea of ever-warm water surrounding the North Pole, and that there are islands there abounding in animal life, and colonised by the Eskimos.  The plan is to visit these islands, and stand upon the actual North Pole, which they find to be a low eminence near to the hut of a descendant of a seaman of the original Hudson expedition in 1611.  The story is very well-told, and you find yourself almost believing the Captain's logic.  The tension is maintained right up to the last chapter, so much so that we do not learn whether the family, who have by this time all become endeared to us, ever get home to England, and what the father and mother of the Captain's nephews have to say about their sons' adventures.

CHAPTER ONE.  INTRODUCES OUR HERO AND HIS KINDRED.  The Giant was an Eskimo of the Arctic regions.  At the beginning of his career he was known among his kindred by the name of Skreekinbroot, or the howler, because he howled oftener and more furiously than any infant that had ever been born in Arctic land.  His proper name, however, was Chingatok, though his familiars still ventured occasionally to style him Skreekinbroot.  Now it must not be supposed that our giant was one of those ridiculous myths of the nursery, with monstrous heads and savage hearts, who live on human flesh, and finally receive their deserts at the hands of famous giant-killing Jacks.  No!  Chingatok was a real man of moderate size-- not more than seven feet two in his sealskin boots--with a lithe, handsome figure, immense chest and shoulders, a gentle disposition, and a fine, though flattish countenance, which was sometimes grave with thought, at other times rippling with fun.  We mention the howling characteristic of his babyhood because it was, in early life, the only indication of the grand spirit that dwelt within him--the solitary evidence of the tremendous energy with which he was endowed.  At first he was no bigger than an ordinary infant.  He was, perhaps, a little fatter, but _not_ larger, and there was not an oily man or woman of the tribe to which he belonged who would have noticed anything peculiar about him if he had only kept moderately quiet; but this he would not or could not do.  His mouth was his safety-valve.  His spirit seemed to have been born big at once.  It was far too large for his infant body, and could only find relief from the little plump dwelling in which it was at first enshrined by rushing out at the mouth. The shrieks of pigs were trifles to the yelling of that Eskimo child's impatience.  The caterwauling of cats was as nothing to the growls of his disgust.  The angry voice of the Polar bear was a mere chirp compared with the furious howling of his disappointment, and the barking of a mad walrus was music to the roaring of his wrath.  Every one, except his mother, wished him dead and buried in the centre of an iceberg or at the bottom of the Polar Sea.  His mother--squat, solid, pleasant-faced, and mild--alone put up with his ways with that long-suffering endurance which is characteristic of mothers.  Nothing could disturb the serenity of Toolooha.  When the young giant, (that was to be), roared, she fondled him; if that was ineffectual, she gave him a walrus tusk or a seal's flipper to play with; if that did not suffice, she handed him a lump of blubber to suck; if that failed, as was sometimes the case, she gambolled with him on the floor of her snow-hut, and rubbed his oily visage lovingly over her not less oleaginous countenance.  Need we enlarge on this point?  Have not all mothers acted thus, or similarly, in all times and climes?    From pole to pole a mother's soul   Is tender, strong, and true;   Whether the loved be good or bad--   White, yellow, black, or blue.  But Toolooha's love was wise as well as strong.  If all else failed, she was wont to apply corporal punishment, and whacked her baby with her tail.  Be not shocked, reader.  We refer to the tail of her coat, which was so long that it trailed on the ground, and had a flap at the end which produced surprising results when properly applied.  But the howling condition of life did not last long.  At the age of five years little Chingatok began to grow unusually fast, and when he reached the age of seven, the tribe took note of him as a more than promising youth.  Then the grand spirit, which had hitherto sought to vent itself in yells and murderous assaults on its doting mother, spent its energies in more noble action.  All the little boys of his size, although much older than himself, began to look up to him as a champion.  None went so boldly into mimic warfare with the walrus and the bear as Chingatok.  No one could make toy sledges out of inferior and scanty materials so well as he.  If any little one wanted a succourer in distress, Skreekinbroot was the lad to whom he, or she, turned.  If a broken toy had to be mended, Chingatok could do it better than any other boy.  And so it went on until he became a man and a giant.  When he was merely a big boy--that is, bigger than the largest man of his tribe--he went out with the other braves to hunt and fish, and signalised himself by the reckless manner in which he would attack the polar bear single-handed; but when he reached his full height and breadth he gave up reckless acts, restrained his tendency to display his great strength, and became unusually modest and thoughtful, even pensive, for an Eskimo.  The superiority of Chingatok's mind, as well as his body, soon became manifest.  Even among savages, intellectual power commands respect. When coupled with physical force it elicits reverence.  The young giant soon became an oracle and a leading man in his tribe.  Those who had wished him dead, and in the centre of an iceberg or at the bottom of the Polar Sea, came to wish that there were only a few more men like him.  Of course he had one or two enemies.  Who has not?  There were a few who envied him his physical powers.  There were some who envied him his moral influence.  None envied him his intellectual superiority, for they did not understand it.  There was one who not only envied but hated him. This was Eemerk, a mean-spirited, narrow-minded fellow, who could not bear to play what is styled second fiddle.  Eemerk was big enough--over six feet--but he wanted to be bigger.  He was stout enough, but wanted to be stouter.  He was influential too, but wanted to reign supreme.  This, of course, was not possible while there existed a taller, stouter, and cleverer man than himself.  Even if Eemerk had been the equal of Chingatok in all these respects, there would still have remained one difference of character which would"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21733"],["title","The Giant of the North: Pokings Round the Pole (#1)"],["body","rendered equality impossible.  It was this: our young giant was unselfish and modest.  Eemerk was selfish and vain-glorious.  When the latter killed a seal he always kept the tit-bits for himself.  Chingatok gave them to his mother, or to any one else who had a mind to have them.  And so in regard to everything.  Chingatok was not a native of the region in which we introduce him to the reader.  He and the tribe, or rather part of the tribe, to which he belonged, had travelled from the far north; so far north that nobody knew the name of the land from which they had come.  Even Chingatok himself did not know it.  Being unacquainted with geography, he knew no more about his position on the face of this globe than a field-mouse or a sparrow.  But the young giant had heard a strange rumour, while in his far-off country, which had caused his strong intellect to ponder, and his huge heart to beat high.  Tribes who dwelt far to the south of his northern home had told him that other tribes, still further south, had declared that the people who dwelt to the south of them had met with a race of men who came to them over the sea on floating islands; that these islands had something like trees growing out of them, and wings which moved about, which folded and expanded somewhat like the wings of the sea-gull; that these men's faces were whiter than Eskimo faces; that they wore skins of a much more curious kind than sealskins, and that they were amazingly clever with their hands, talked a language that no one could understand, and did many wonderful things that nobody could comprehend.  A longing, wistful expression used to steal over Chingatok's face as he gazed at the southern horizon while listening to these strange rumours, and a very slight smile of incredulity had glimmered on his visage, when it was told him that one of the floating islands of these Kablunets, or white men, had been seen with a burning mountain in the middle of it, which vomited forth smoke and fire, and sometimes uttered a furious hissing or shrieking sound, not unlike his own voice when he was a Skreekinbroot.  The giant said little about these and other subjects, but thought deeply.  His mind, as we have said, was far ahead of his time and condition.  Let us listen to some of the disjointed thoughts that perplexed this man.  \"Who made me?\" he asked in a low tone, when floating alone one day in his kayak, or skin canoe, \"whence came I? whither go I?  What is this great sea on which I float? that land on which I tread?  No sledge, no spear, no kayak, no snow-hut makes itself!  Who made all that which I behold?\"  Chingatok looked around him, but no audible answer came from Nature.  He looked up, but the glorious sun only dazzled his eyes.  \"There _must_ be One,\" he continued in a lower tone, \"who made all things; but who made _Him_?  No one?  It is impossible!  The Maker must have ever been.  _Ever been_!\"  He repeated this once or twice with a look of perplexed gravity.  The northern savage had grasped the grand mystery, and, like all true philosophers savage or civilised who have gone before him, relapsed into silence.  At last he resolved to travel south, until he should arrive at the coasts where these strange sights before described were said to have been seen.  Having made up his mind, Chingatok began his arrangements without delay; persuaded a few families of his tribe to accompany him, and reached the north-western shores of Greenland after a long and trying journey by water and ice.  Here he spent the winter.  When spring came, he continued his journey south, and at last began to look out, with sanguine expectation, for the floating islands with wings, and the larger island with the burning mountain on it, about which he had heard.  Of course, on his way south, our giant fell in with some members of the tribes through whom the rumours that puzzled him had been transmitted to the far north; and, as he advanced, these rumours took a more definite, also a more correct, form.  In time he came to understand that the floating islands were gigantic kayaks, or canoes, with masts and sails, instead of trees and wings.  The burning mountain, however, remained an unmodified mystery, which he was still inclined to disbelieve.  But these more correct views did not in the least abate Chingatok's eager desire to behold, with his own eyes, the strange men from the unknown south.  Eemerk formed one of the party who had volunteered to join Chingatok on this journey.  Not that Eemerk was influenced by large-minded views or a thirst for knowledge, but he could not bear the thought that his rival should have all the honour of going forth on a long journey of exploration to the mysterious south, a journey which was sure to be full of adventure, and the successful accomplishment of which would unquestionably raise him very much in the estimation of his tribe.  Eemerk had volunteered to go, not as second in command, but as an independent member of the party--a sort of free-lance.  Chingatok did not quite relish having Eemerk for a companion, but, being a good-humoured, easy-going fellow, he made no objection to his going. Eemerk took his wife with him.  Chingatok took his mother and little sister; also a young woman named Tekkona, who was his wife's sister. These were the only females of the exploring party.  Chingatok had left his wife behind him, because she was not robust at that time; besides, she was very small--as is usually the case with giants' wives--and he was remarkably fond of her, and feared to expose her to severe fatigue and danger.  The completed party of explorers numbered twenty souls, with their respective bodies, some of which latter were large, some small, but all strong and healthy.  Four of the men were friends of Eemerk, whom he had induced to join because he knew them to be kindred spirits who would support him.  \"I go to the ice-cliff to look upon the sea,\" said Chingatok one morning, drawing himself up to his full height, and unconsciously brushing some of the lamp-black off the roof of his hut with the hood of his sealskin coat.  At this point it may be well to explain, once for all, that our giant did not speak English, and as it is highly improbable that the reader understands the Eskimo tongue, we will translate as literally as possible--merely remarking that Chingatok's language, like his mind, was of a superior cast.  \"Why goes my son to the ice-cliff?\" asked Toolooha in a slightly reproachful tone.  \"Are not the floes nearer?  Can he not look on the great salt lake from the hummocks?  The sun has been hot a long time now.  The ice-cliffs are dangerous.  Their edges split off every day. If my son goes often to them, he will one day come tumbling down upon the floes and be crushed flat, and men will carry him to his mother's feet like a mass of shapeless blubber.\"  It is interesting to note how strong a resemblance there is in sentiment and modes of thought between different members of the human family. This untutored savage, this Polar giant, replied, in the Eskimo tongue, words which may be freely translated--\"Never fear, mother, I know how to take care of myself.\"  Had he been an Englishman, he could not have expressed himself more naturally.  He smiled as he looked down at his stout and genial mother, while she stooped and drew forth a choice morsel of walrus flesh from one of her boots.  Eskimo ladies wear enormous sealskin boots the whole length of their legs.  The tops of these boots are made extremely wide, for the purpose of stowing away blubber, or babies, or other odd articles that might encumber their hands.  Chingatok seemed the personification of savage dignity as he stood there, leaning on a short walrus spear.  Evidently his little mother doted on him.  So did Oblooria, a pretty little girl of about sixteen, who was his only sister, and the counterpart of her mother, hairy coat and tail included, only a few sizes smaller.  But Chingatok's dignity was marred somewhat when he went down on his hands and knees, in order to crawl through the low snow-tunnel which was the only mode of egress from the snow-hut.  Emerging at the outer end of the tunnel, he stood up, drew the hood of his sealskin coat over his head, shouldered his spear, and went off with huge and rapid strides over the frozen billows of the Arctic Sea.  Spring was far advanced at the time of which we write, and the sun shone not only with dazzling brilliancy, but with intense power on the fields of ice which still held the ocean in their cold unyielding embrace.  The previous winter had been unusually severe, and the ice showed little or no sign of breaking up, except at a great distance from land, where the heaving of the waves had cracked it up into large fields.  These were gradually parting from the main body, and drifting away with surface-currents to southern waters, there to be liquefied and re-united to their parent sea.  The particular part of the Greenland coast to which the giant went in his ramble is marked by tremendous cliffs descending perpendicularly into the water.  These, at one part, are divided by a valley tilled with a great glacier, which flows from the mountains of the interior with a steep declivity to the sea, into which it thrusts its tongue, or extreme end.  This mighty river of ice completely fills the valley from side to side, being more than two miles in width and many hundred feet thick. It seems as solid and motionless as the rocks that hem it in, nevertheless the markings on the surface resemble the currents and eddies of a stream which has been suddenly frozen in the act of flowing, and if you were to watch it narrowly, day by day, and week by week, you would perceive, by the changed position of objects on its surface, that it does actually advance or flow towards the sea.  A further proof of this advance is, that although the tongue is constantly shedding off large icebergs, it is never much decreased in extent, being"]]]
