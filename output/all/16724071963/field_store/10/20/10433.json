I did it before when you were trying to drown us both and I am perfectly willing to do it again. You had better brace up!\"  Velo was silent, and Zaidos fixed his eyes on the most amazing sight that a Scout ever witnessed.  Suddenly a wild shot ripped across the water, skipped along twenty feet from them, plowed its way into the sea, then disappeared.  Velo screamed.  Another shot followed so close that the wave from it rocked them.  Zaidos watched the Zeppelin with fascinated eyes.  It circled round and round, in an effort to get over the biggest ship.  A shot leaped up at it, and missed.  The Zeppelin rose a little, then returned to the attack.  Another shot narrowly missed it; but at that instant a bomb dropped like a plummet.  It was a close miss.  Zaidos could see wood fly as it clipped the prow and exploded as it reached the sea, doing but little damage.  \"Look!  Look!\" cried Velo.  Another battleship was coming, and another, until before them five great monsters battled.  The Zeppelin returned to the attack, and Zaidos himself cried, \"Look!  Look!\" as a swift gleam of light across the water, on a line with his eyes, betrayed the lightning swift course of a torpedo.  It struck the ship, and at the same moment the Zeppelin dropped an accurate bomb.  There was a terrific explosion as the torpedo struck amidships, a spurt of flame as the bomb scattered its inflammable gases over the decks, and fire burst out everywhere. Another torpedo tore into the ship.  Zaidos' eyes bulged as he watched, the monster ship flaming and roaring with repeated explosions, her own guns valiantly firing to the last.  As she plunged nose-first into the sea, the boys could see the crew, like ants, pouring, leaping over the side, only to go down in the vast whirlpool made by the sinking vessel.  The Zeppelin now soared skyward, made a wide circle that took it almost out of sight, and returned to attack another ship.  Then a strange thing happened.  The upleaping shot from the battleship crossed the bomb from the Zeppelin in mid-air, and as the bomb exploded on the deck of the cruiser, the shell from her aeroplane gun hit the delicate body of the airship and tore through it.  As the Zeppelin came whirling down, turning over and over in the air, Zaidos could see the crew spilling out like little black pills out of a torn box.  That they were men, human beings whirling to a dreadful death, did not occur to him. He had lost all sense of human values in the terrible pageant before him.  It seemed like a picture show, only with the vivid colors of reality and the deafening noise of exploding shells.  Once they felt the submarine pass under them, so close that it made an eddy that pulled them toward the combating ships.  When it came up to release its dart, the boys were too intent on keeping themselves enough out of the sea wash to breathe, to see whether the torpedo struck or not.  The excitement grew in intensity.  Gradually the group of fighting ships drew nearer the swimmers.  They were not more than half a mile away. Another great hulk went down.  The Zeppelin, with broken wings wide spread, floated on the sea.  They could scarcely see it except when a wave made by a falling shell lifted some of its delicate framework.  \"There goes another ship!\" exclaimed Zaidos.  \"I wish I could tell what they are.  I can't see any flags or emblems from here.\"  \"I don't care what becomes of them,\" Velo said irritably.  \"I'm water-soaked.  I feel queer.  I'll never get out of this.\"  \"Oh, brace up!\" cried Zaidos, speaking in English.  He reflected that Velo could not understand a word of the language, and proceeded to give vent to his feelings in a tongue that he had found extremely expressive in times of need.  He glared at the drooping boy, while the guns continued to thunder.  \"You make me sick!  You make me tired!\" he exploded.  \"Great Scott, you are the worst baby I ever saw!  I wish to goodness you were wherever you want to be, wrapped up in cotton batting, I suppose, and tied with pink string, and laid on a shelf in a safety deposit vault.  You are a regular jelly fish!  I wish I had some fellow along who had a real spine!  I--\" he paused for breath.  \"I don't know what you are saying,\" complained Velo.  \"It doesn't matter,\" said Zaidos in Greek.  \"It was nothing of consequence.  I think I told you once or twice before just about what I thought about things.  If you feel better to whimper around all the time and complain about things, why, so ahead!  I suppose we _will_ drown.  I'm getting pretty tired myself, but I mean to hang on as long as I can.  \"If this fight ends before nightfall, that Red Cross ship is sure to come back and pick up all they can, and you can see for yourself just the position it is in now.  It can't get to the battleships without coming past us.  So we have a good chance.  I've been in the water longer than this without much damage.  But I wish you could manage to keep yourself together, Velo.  I'm sure we will come out all right. I'm not going to die now, before I have a chance to do something worth while.\"  He shook the water from his face.  \"Well, I believe they are going to quit,\" he said.  \"I wonder how many fellows have seen anything like this.  Three dreadnaughts and a Zeppelin sunk and wrecked, and I don't know which is which or who is who.  It doesn't much matter to us, however.  However long or short I live, I'll never forget it.  Never!  Just think of it, Velo; three ships of the line, and a flyer.\"  He turned to the opposite direction, scanning the sea with keen eyes.  \"Yes, sure enough, here comes the Red Cross!  The fight is over.  She is going to pass us.  That's pretty fine, isn't it, Velo?  Don't that make you feel warm all over?\"  \"She may not stop,\" said Velo gloomily.  \"A Red Cross ship pass all this bunch swimming around here without stopping to pick them up?  You are crazy!\"  \"There are not so very many,\" insisted Velo.  \"They will stop to pick you up if all the rest of us go down before they get here,\" said Zaidos patiently.  \"You have the life belt, Velo, so don't worry any more than you have to.\"  A silence followed.  After the wild racket of the guns, it seemed as though the sea itself whispered.  On and on came the Red Cross ship. It approached so near that they could see that a couple of boats were being lowered.  They were gasoline launches, and they raced here and there, pausing every little while to pick up a survivor.  As they approached Zaidos and his cousin, Velo commenced to scream in a weak voice.  Zaidos sighed, but said nothing.  When the nearest launch approached them, Velo thrust him back and left him swimming while he, with his life belt, was lifted over the side. But a sailor had Zaidos by the shoulder.  It was well, for the boy was at the point of exhaustion, and as he felt himself drawn into the boat, he found a sudden darkness settle over everything, and he sank back unconscious into the arms of a doctor.  When he opened his eyes, he was in the clean, airy, floating hospital. It took a little thought for Zaidos to recollect where he was.  When he did so, he made an effort to arise.  To his great surprise, he could not move.  He threw back the covers.  His leg was in splints.  He stared at it with surprise.  A nurse came up.  \"How did that happen?\" he demanded.  \"What ails my leg anyhow?\"  \"You ought to know,\" she smiled.  \"We expect you to tell us.  Your leg is broken below the knee.  Just the small bone, you know.  Do you mean to say you did not know it?\"  \"I should say not!\" said Zaidos.  \"You are sure it is broken?  It hurts a lot, but I don't see how it could be broken without my knowing it.\"  \"Yes, it is certainly broken,\" the nurse repeated.  \"Oh, you are talking English, aren't you?\" cried Zaidos with delight.  \"Why, yes.  This is an English Red Cross ship,\" replied the nurse. \"You are English, are you not?  Or American?\"  Zaidos shook his head.  \"No, I'm a Greek,\" he explained.  \"But I've been in America at school since I was a little chap, and I have had an English room-mate for three years.\"  \"That's it, then,\" said the nurse.  \"You must not talk now, however. You must drink this and sleep if you can.  There are a lot of badly hurt men here.  _You_ are all right, but pretty well water-soaked and tired out.  Try to sleep.\"  She started on, but Zaidos put out his hand and detained her.  \"Just a moment, please,\" he said, smiling at her in his sunny way.  \"Is there a fellow here called Velo Kupenol?  Tall fellow, thin, and looks a little like me perhaps?\"  \"Perhaps not again,\" said the nurse, frowning a little.  \"Yes, your friend is here.  He does not seem to have anything the matter with him, yet he acts like a very sick boy.\"  \"Seems to enjoy poor health?\" asked Zaidos, smiling.  \"Well, I myself can't really blame him.  You don't know how very _wet_ we felt!  I feel as though I could lie here a week and enjoy these dry sheets.\"  \"You will be very likely to do so whether you enjoy it or not,\" said the nurse.  \"Legs do not mend in a day.  When your friend thinks he is strong enough, I will suggest his coming to visit you.\"  She passed on, and Zaidos lay staring at the wooden ceiling so near his head.  Round and round and round goes the wheel of fate, thought Zaidos.  He wondered what the next turn would be, and where it would carry him. He drank from the cup the nurse had given him, and presently dozed off, although his leg pained too much to allow him to get a sound sleep.  He was aroused later by voices near him, and recognized the sound of his cousin's voice.  Velo was talking in a rapid, low tone to one of the doctors.  \"Looks like a nice boy,\" said the doctor in Greek.  \"Yes, he is,\" said Velo.  \"But if he is my cousin, I must say he is one of the most stubborn fellows I have ever known.\"  \"Is that so?\" thought Zaidos, keeping his eyes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21787"],["title","Shelled (#7)"],["body","tight.  He thought there would be no more talk about him, but the doctor went on, \"He doesn't look it.\"  \"No,\" said Velo, \"but he is.  I thought I would never be able to rescue him from that sinking transport.  He went sort of crazy, he was so afraid, and when the order came to jump, he clung to the rail, and refused to move.  I had to twist his hands away, and jump with him.\"  \"Well, I do declare!\" thought Zaidos.  He decided that he had better find out just what sort of a fellow he was supposed to be anyhow.  Velo went on, \"When I got him into the water, I had to take him over my shoulder, and swim for dear life to get away from the boat before she went down.  We just made it, and at that he clung to me with such a grip that I thought I would have to let go and leave him to his fate.\"  \"Queer how they hang on to one in the water,\" said the doctor.  \"It seems strange he does not swim.\"  \"Oh, he swims a little,\" said Velo.  \"He _thinks_ he swims well, but it does not amount to much.  I got hold of a life belt and buckled it around him, and kept his courage up as well as I could.  The fight out there nearly finished him.\"  \"I don't know as I blame him,\" said the doctor.  \"It must have been a pretty stiff experience, especially when a shot came your way occasionally.\"  \"Yes, it was exciting,\" Velo agreed.  He spoke with the ease of a man accustomed to worse things.  Zaidos wondered how the doctor ever believed it all.  \"Well,\" he said, \"I'll have to go on.  You can congratulate yourself, young man, on having the courage and patience to stick it out and save the lad.  It is a great credit to you and I'm proud to know you.\"  And he turned and walked softly away between the white bunks.  Velo remained standing near Zaidos.  Presently he came over and looked down at his cousin.  Zaidos opened one eye and looked up.  The other he kept tightly closed.  It gave him a teasing, guying expression of countenance which he had many times found very irritating at school.  \"Dear, _dear_ Velo,\" he said with a simper, \"how can I _ever_ thank you for saving my life?\"     CHAPTER V  INTO SERVICE  Zaidos' method of punishing Velo for the yarn he had told the doctor took the form of an exaggerated gratitude.  Being perfectly independent of praise himself, Zaidos could not understand why on earth Velo should have taken the trouble to misrepresent things so.  As far as Zaidos could see, there was nothing to be gained by it.  The incident was past and did not concern the doctor in any way.  Zaidos, who did not know his cousin at all, had yet to learn that his was one of the natures that are incapable of any noble effort, yet which feed on praise.  With Velo everything was personal.  If he passed a beautiful woman driving in the park, he thought instantly, \"Now if that horse should run away, and I should leap out and grasp the animal by the head, wouldn't that be fine?  I would doubtless be dashed to the pavement a few times, but what of that?\"  He could almost hear the lovely lady, pale and shaken, as she thanked her noble preserver and pressed into his hand a ring of immense value.  The lovely lady was always a Countess at least, and frequently a Princess.  Velo imagined drowning accidents, and fires where he dashed the firemen aside, and made thrilling rescues of other lovely ladies who were seen hanging out of high windows.  Velo himself always came out unhurt and with his clothes nicely brushed and in order.  Sometimes he imagined a slight, _very_ slight cut on his forehead, which had to be becomingly bandaged, but that was always the extent of his injuries.  Velo liked to imagine bandits, too; big, ferocious fellows whom he outwitted, or choked into insensibility in single combat.  At a moving-picture show, he always sat in a delicious dream, admiring his own exploits as the pictures flashed on the screen.  Thus it was perfectly natural and simple for him to take the adventure of the previous day, and twist it to his own glorification.  To Zaidos this would have been such an impossibility that he simply could not have understood it at all, even if someone had explained Velo's way of looking at things.  To Zaidos the only possible or natural way to look at things was to do whatever came up for a fellow _to_ do, and to do it as soon and as well as he possibly could.  Not knowing Velo, he did not dream that he was in the habit of glorifying himself on every possible occasion.  If he had, he would have pressed a little harder.  As it was, he drove Velo into a cold fury by his sweet, humble gratitude.  \"Oh, Velo,\" he would say, \"whenever I think how you wrenched my hands from the rail, and forced me into the water, and swam with me to safety, I don't see how I will _ever_ thank you!\"  Then he would get out the square of antiseptic gauze the nurse had given him for a handkerchief and cry into its folds as loudly as he dared.  Zaidos had to take medicine to keep down fever, so there were two bottles on the tiny table beside him.  He had to take a dose every hour.  Once he woke up, and took the bottle in his hand and started to pour it out just as the nurse came past.  She gave a look at the bottle, smothered a cry, and snatched it from Zaidos' hand.  She was pale.  \"How--where--when did you get that?\" she stammered.  \"What's the matter with it?\" asked Zaidos.  \"Isn't it my medicine? I've been taking it all the time, haven't I?\"  The nurse had regained her self-control and even smiled.  \"Have you been asleep this morning?\" she asked, as though the medicine no longer interested her.  \"Just woke up,\" said Zaidos.  \"I had a fine nap.\"  \"That's good,\" said the nurse and walked away, taking the bottle in her hand.  But five minutes later, when she reported to the doctor, her manner was not so calm.  \"What do you think?\" she cried, closing the door of the tiny laboratory where he was working with an assistant.  \"What can this mean?  This bottle was on young Zaidos' table instead of the medicine I left there!\"  The doctor scanned the label.  \"Bichloride of mercury,\" he said.  \"Why, that's queer!\"  He pondered. \"What do you make of it?\"  \"I can't make a _guess_ even,\" said the nurse.  \"There is no one out there who is delirious, and Zaidos could not get up on that broken leg in his sleep, if he wanted to.  If it was not such a crazy idea, I should say someone had a reason for getting rid of Zaidos, but he is very popular, and his cousin thinks the world of him.\"  The incident was mysterious as well as serious.  They discussed it and made guesses which flew wide of the mark.  The doctor quietly ordered a change of medicine for Zaidos, and removing the bottles on his table, gave the nurse instructions to give him the doses herself.  She did so, without rousing any suspicion in Zaidos' open and confident mind, _but Velo Kupenol noticed the change_.  He was more attentive to his cousin than ever.  Only in the rare moments when he was alone and secure from observation did he allow himself to take off the mask of good nature and kindliness, and let those thin features of his twist into the wicked leer that well fitted them.  He no longer saw himself in the part of hero.  He was too eager to remove from his way the boy who stood between him and all the luxury he craved.  But his common sense told him that at the present, at least, there was nothing to be done.  He would have to await further developments.  In the meantime he would gain his cousin's confidence.  That ought to be easy.  Zaidos was the most friendly fellow he had ever seen.  Velo resolved that if ever he came in for the Zaidos name and title, he would show them just how haughty and overbearing a young nobleman could be.  But in the meantime, he thought it better to do as Zaidos commanded and say nothing about the family.  Zaidos had elected to be known as a common soldier, and he would keep to his word.  Velo realized that he himself could make no pretentions while Zaidos was about; he would not stand for that.  So Velo acted in his best and oiliest manner, and waited on the nurse, and urged his services on the doctors, and wondered why they never acted at ease and friendly with him, as they all did with the laughing boy on the cot.  When they were sent ashore it dawned on Velo that now they would be separated.  Zaidos would have to go to a hospital to wait for his leg to heal; but he was well, and would be set at some duty which would separate him from Zaidos.  That would never do.  He worried over it as they approached land, and finally took the matter to the doctor.  He put the matter strongly.  He had promised Zaidos' dying father that he would not be separated from the boy.  They were almost of an age, but he had always been the one to look out for Zaidos, and surely now if ever was the time to be true to his trust.  He explained the manner of their enlistment, and reminded the doctor they were both listed among the drowned.  \"You see I _must_ remain near him,\" he urged.  \"Just help me find a way.\"  \"The hospitals are all short handed,\" mused the good-natured physician. \"I think they would be glad to get you.  There is lots of heavy lifting that tells on the nurses, and all that sort of thing, you know.  It will be two weeks before Zaidos can be discharged.  That bone is not knitting right.  It was splintered, you see.  I'll do all I can for you, Velo, and I think it will work out nicely.\"  So it came about that when the patients on the Red Cross ship were transferred to the land hospital within the English lines, Velo was there in full force, carrying one end of Zaidos' stretcher.  Of course it was the light end; Velo saw to that instinctively, but then it was Velo's attention to just such little details that made life easy for him.  Zaidos soon improved so that he was allowed to hop about on crutches. The second day he used them, however, a brass pin somehow worked into the arm pad and scratched him badly before he knew that it was just where his weight would press it into"]]]
