Ramblin' Peter sat stolidly down beside the fire and calmly stirred the porridge-pot, which was nearly full of the substantial Scottish fare.  \"Noo, sir,\" said Black, turning to Will Wallace, who had stood quietly watching the various actors in the scene just described, \"yer comrades'll be here in a wee while.  May I ask what ye expect?\"  \"I expect to be imprisoned at the least, more probably shot.\"  \"Hm! pleasant expectations for a young man, nae doot.  I'm sorry that it's oot o' my power to stop an' see the fun, for the sodgers have strange suspicions aboot me, so I'm forced to mak' mysel' scarce an' leave Ramblin' Peter to do the hospitalities o' the hoose.  But before I gang awa' I wad fain repay ye for the guid turn ye did to my bairns.  If ye are willin' to shut yer eyes an' do what I tell ye, I'll put you in a place o' safety.\"  \"Thank you, Mr. Black,\" returned Wallace; \"of course I shall only be too glad to escape from the consequences of my unfortunate position; but do not misunderstand me: although neither a spy nor a Covenantor I am a loyal subject, and would not now be a deserter if that character had not been forced upon me, first by the brutality of the soldiers with whom I was banded, and then by the insolence of my comrade-in-arms to your daughter--\"  \"Niece; niece,\" interrupted Black; \"I wish she _was_ my dauchter, bless her bonny face!  Niver fear, sir, I've nae doot o' yer loyalty, though you an' yer freends misdoot mine.  I claim to be as loyal as the best o' ye, but there's nae dictionary in _this_ warld that defines loyalty to be slavish submission o' body an' sowl to a tyrant that fears naether God nor man.  The quastion noo is, Div ye want to escape and wull ye trust me?\"  The sound of horses galloping in the distance tended to quicken the young trooper's decision.  He submitted to be blindfolded by his captor.  \"Noo, Peter,\" said Andrew, as he was about to lead Wallace away, \"ye ken what to dae.  Gie them plenty to eat; show them the rum bottle, let them hae the rin o' the hoose, an' say that I bade ye treat them weel.\"  \"Ay,\" was Ramblin' Peter's laconic reply.  Leading his captive out at the door, round the house, and re-entering by a back door, apparently with no other end in view than to bewilder him, Andrew went into a dark room, opened some sort of door--to enter which the trooper had to stoop low--and conducted him down a steep, narrow staircase.  The horsemen meanwhile had found the cottage and were heard at that moment tramping about in front, and thundering on the door for admittance.  Wallace fancied that the door which closed behind him must be of amazing thickness, for it shut out almost completely the sounds referred to.  On reaching the foot of the staircase, and having the napkin removed from his eyes, he found himself in a long, low, vaulted chamber.  There was no one in it save his guide and a venerable man who sat beside a deal table, reading a document by the light of a tallow candle stuck in the mouth of a black bottle.  The soldiers, meanwhile, having been admitted by Ramblin' Peter, proceeded to question that worthy as to Andrew Black and his household. Not being satisfied of the truth of his replies they proceeded to apply torture in order to extract confession.  It was the first time that this mode of obtaining information had been used in Black's cottage, and it failed entirely, for Ramblin' Peter was staunch, and, although inhumanly thrashed and probed with sword-points, the poor lad remained dumb, insomuch that the soldiers at length set him down as an idiot, for he did not even cry out in his agonies--excepting in a curious, half-stifled manner--because he knew well that if his master were made aware by his cries of what was going on he would be sure to hasten to the rescue at the risk of his life.  Having devoured the porridge, drunk the rum, and destroyed a considerable amount of the farmer's produce, the lawless troopers, who seemed to be hurried in their proceedings at that time, finally left the place.  About the time that these events were taking place in and around Black's cottage, bands of armed men with women and even children were hastening towards the same locality to attend the great \"conventicle,\" for which the preparations already described were being made.  The immediate occasion of the meeting was the desire of the parishioners of the Reverend John Welsh, a great-grandson of John Knox, to make public avowal, at the Communion Table, of their fidelity to Christ and their attachment to the minister who had been expelled from the church of Irongray; but strong sympathy induced many others to attend, not only from all parts of Galloway and Nithsdale, but from the distant Clyde, the shores of the Forth, and elsewhere; so that the roads were crowded with people making for the rendezvous--some on foot, others on horseback.  Many of the latter were gentlemen of means and position, who, as well as their retainers, were more or less well armed and mounted.  The Reverend John Blackadder, the \"auld\" minister of Troqueer--a noted hero of the Covenant, who afterwards died a prisoner on the Bass Rock--travelled with his party all the way from Edinburgh, and a company of eighty horse proceeded to the meeting from Clydesdale.  Preliminary services, conducted by Mr. Blackadder and Mr. Welsh, were held near Dumfries on the Saturday, but at these the place of meeting on the Sabbath was only vaguely announced as \"a hillside in Irongray,\" so anxious were they to escape being disturbed by their enemies, and the secret was kept so well that when the Sabbath arrived a congregation of above three thousand had assembled round the Communion stones in the hollow of Skeoch Hill.  Sentinels were posted on all the surrounding heights.  One of these sentinels was the farmer Andrew Black, with a cavalry sword belted to his waist, and a rusty musket on his shoulder.  Beside him stood a tall stalwart youth in shepherd's costume.  \"Yer ain mother wadna ken ye,\" remarked Andrew with a twinkle in his eyes.  \"I doubt that,\" replied the youth; \"a mother's eyes are keen.  I should not like to encounter even Glendinning in my present guise.\"  As he spoke the rich melody of the opening psalm burst from the great congregation and rolled in softened cadence towards the sentinels.  CHAPTER THREE.  THE TRUE AND THE FALSE AT WORK.  The face of nature did not seem propitious to the great gathering on Skeoch Hill.  Inky clouds rolled athwart the leaden sky, threatening a deluge of rain, and fitful gusts of wind seemed to indicate the approach of a tempest.  Nevertheless the elements were held in check by the God of nature, so that the solemn services of the day were conducted to a close without discomfort, though not altogether without interruption.  Several of the most eminent ministers, who had been expelled from their charges, were present on this occasion.  Besides John Welsh of Irongray, there were Arnot of Tongland, Blackadder of Troqueer, and Dickson of Rutherglen--godly men who had for many years suffered persecution and imprisonment, and were ready to lay down their lives in defence of religious liberty.  The price set upon the head of that \"notour traitor, Mr. John Welsh,\" dead or alive, was 9000 merks.  Mr. Arnot was valued at 3000!  These preached and assisted at different parts of the services, while the vast multitude sat on the sloping hillside, and the mounted men drew up on the outskirts of the congregation, so as to be within sound of the preachers' voices, and, at the same time, be ready for action on the defensive if enemies should appear.  Andrew Black and his companion stood for some time listening, with bowed heads, to the slow sweet music that floated towards them.  They were too far distant to hear the words of prayer that followed, yet they continued to stand in reverent silence for some time, listening to the sound--Black with his eyes closed, his young companion gazing wistfully at the distant landscape, which, from the elevated position on which they stood, lay like a magnificent panorama spread out before them.  On the left the level lands bordering the rivers Cairn and Nith stretched away to the Solway, with the Cumberland mountains in the extreme distance; in front and on the right lay the wild, romantic hill-country of which, in after years, it was so beautifully written:--    \"O bonnie hills of Galloway oft have I stood to see,   At sunset hour, your shadows fall, all darkening on the lea;   While visions of the buried years came o'er me in their might--   As phantoms of the sepulchre--instinct with inward light!   The years, the years when Scotland groaned beneath her tyrant's hand!   And 'twas not for the heather she was called `the purple land.'   And 'twas not for her _loveliness_ her children blessed their God--   _But for secret places of the hills, and the mountain heights_   _untrod_.\"  \"Who was the old man I found in what you call your hidy-hole?\" asked Wallace, turning suddenly to his companion.  \"I'm no' sure that I have a right to answer that,\" said Black, regarding Will with a half-serious, half-amused look.  \"Hooever, noo that ye've ta'en service wi' me, and ken about my hidy-hole, I suppose I may trust ye wi' a' my secrets.\"  \"I would not press you to reveal any secrets, Mr. Black, yet I think you are safe to trust me, seeing that you know enough about my own secrets to bring me to the gallows if so disposed.\"  \"Ay, I hae ye there, lad!  But I'll trust ye on better grunds than that. I believe ye to be an honest man, and that's enough for me.  Weel, ye maun ken, it's saxteen year since"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21738"],["title","Hunted and Harried (#4)"],["body"," howkit the hidy-hole below my hoose, an' wad ye believe it?--they've no fund it oot yet!  Not even had a suspeecion o't, though the sodgers hae been sair puzzled, mony a time, aboot hoo I managed to gie them the slip.  An' mony's the puir body, baith gentle and simple, that I've gien food an' shelter to whae was very likely to hae perished o' cauld an' hunger, but for the hidy-hole. Among ithers I've often had the persecuited ministers doon there, readin' their Bibles or sleepin' as comfortable as ye like when the dragoons was drinkin', roarin', an' singin' like deevils ower their heids.  My certies! if Clavers, or Sherp, or Lauderdale had an inklin' o' the hunderd pairt o' the law-brekin' that I've done, it's a gallows in the Gressmarkit as high as Haman's wad be ereckit for me, an' my heed an' hauns, may be, would be bleachin' on the Nether Bow.  Humph! but they've no' gotten me yet!\"  \"And I sincerely hope they never will,\" remarked Wallace; \"but you have not yet told me the name of the old man.\"  \"I was comin' to him,\" continued Black; \"but wheniver I wander to the doin's o' that black-hearted Cooncil, I'm like to lose the threed o' my discoorse.  Yon is a great man i' the Kirk o' Scotland.  They ca' him Donald Cargill.  The adventures that puir man has had in the coorse o' mair nor quarter o' a century wad mak' a grand story-buik.  He has no fear o' man, an' he's an awfu' stickler for justice.  I'se warrant he gied ye some strang condemnations o' the poors that be.\"  \"Indeed he did not,\" said Wallace.  \"Surely you misjudge his character. His converse with me was entirely religious, and his chief anxiety seemed to be to impress on me the love of God in sending Jesus Christ to redeem a wicked world from sin.  I tried to turn the conversation on the state of the times, but he gently turned it round again to the importance of being at peace with God, and giving heed to the condition of my own soul.  He became at last so personal that I did not quite like it.  Yet he was so earnest and kind that I could not take offence.\"  \"Ay, ay,\" said Black in a musing tone, \"I see.  He clearly thinks that yer he'rt needs mair instruction than yer heed.  Hm! maybe he's right. Hooever, he's a wonderfu' man; gangs aboot the country preachin' everywhere altho' he kens that the sodgers are aye on the look-oot for him, an' that if they catch him it's certain death.  He wad have been at this communion nae doot, if he hadna engaged to preach somewhere near Sanquhar this vera day.\"  \"Then he has left the hidy-hole by this time, I suppose?\"  \"Ye may be sure o' that, for when there is work to be done for the Master, Donal' Cargill doesna let the gress grow under his feet.\"  \"I'm sorry that I shall not see him again,\" returned the ex-trooper in a tone of regret, \"for I like him much.\"  Now, while this conversation was going on, a portion of the troop of dragoons which had been out in search of Andrew Black was sent under Glendinning (now a sergeant) in quest of an aged couple named Mitchell, who were reported to have entertained intercommuned, iúeú outlawed, persons; attended conventicles in the fields; ventured to have family worship in their cottages while a few neighbours were present, and to have otherwise broken the laws of the Secret Council.  This Council, which was ruled by two monsters in human form, namely, Archbishop Sharp of Saint Andrews and the Duke of Lauderdale, having obtained full powers from King Charles the Second to put down conventicles and enforce the laws against the fanatics with the utmost possible rigour, had proceeded to carry out their mission by inviting a host of half, if not quite, savage Highlanders to assist them in quelling the people.  This host, numbering, with 2000 regulars and militia, about 10,000 men, eagerly accepted the invitation, and was let loose on the south and western districts of Scotland about the beginning of the year, and for some time ravaged and pillaged the land as if it had been an enemy's country.  They were thanked by the King for so readily agreeing to assist in reducing the Covenanters to obedience to \"Us and Our laws,\" and were told to take up free quarters among the disaffected, to disarm such persons as they should suspect, to carry with them instruments of torture wherewith to subdue the refractory, and in short to act very much in accordance with the promptings of their own desires.  Evidently the mission suited these men admirably, for they treated all parties as disaffected, with great impartiality, and plundered, tortured, and insulted to such an extent that after about three months of unresisted depredation, the shame of the thing became so obvious that Government was compelled to send them home again.  They had accomplished nothing in the way of bringing the Covenanters to reason; but they had desolated a fair region of Scotland, spilt much innocent blood, ruined many families, and returned to their native hills heavily laden with booty of every kind like a victorious army.  It is said that the losses caused by them in the county of Ayr alone amounted to over 11,000 pounds sterling.  The failure of this horde did not in the least check the proceedings of Sharp or Lauderdale or their like-minded colleagues.  They kept the regular troops and militia moving about the land, enforcing their idiotical and wicked laws at the point of the sword.  We say idiotical advisedly, for what could give stronger evidence of mental incapacity than the attempt to enforce a bond upon all landed proprietors, obliging themselves and their wives, children, and servants, as well as all their tenants and cottars, with their wives, children, and servants, to abstain from conventicles, and not to receive, assist, or even speak to, any forfeited persons, intercommuned ministers, or vagrant preachers, but to use their utmost endeavours to apprehend all such?  Those who took this bond were to receive an assurance that the troops should not be quartered on their lands--a matter of considerable importance--for this quartering involved great expense and much destruction of property in most cases, and absolute ruin in some.  After the battle of the Pentland Hills (in 1666), in which the Covenanters, driven to desperation, made an unsuccessful effort to throw off the tyrannical yoke, severer laws were enacted against them.  Their wily persecutor, also being well aware of the evil influence of disagreement among men, threw a bone of contention among them in the shape of royal acts of _Indulgence_, as they were styled, by which a certain number of the ejected ministers were permitted to preach on certain conditions, but only within their own parishes.  To preach at a separate meeting in a private house subjected the minister to a fine of 5000 merks (about 278 pounds).  To preach in the fields was to incur the penalty of death and confiscation of property.  And these arbitrary laws were not merely enacted for intimidation.  They were rigorously enforced.  The curates in many cases became mere spies and Government informers.  Many of the best men in the land laid down their lives rather than cease to proclaim the Gospel of love and peace and goodwill in Jesus Christ.  Of course their enemies set them down as self-willed and turbulent fanatics.  It has ever been, and ever will be, thus with men who are indifferent to principle.  They will not, as well as cannot, understand those who are ready to fight, and, if need be, die for truth! Their unspoken argument seems to be: \"You profess to preach peace, love, submission to authority, etcetera; very good, stand to your principles.  Leave all sorts of carnal fighting to us.  Obey us. Conform humbly to our arrangements, whatever they are, and all will be well; but dare to show the slightest symptom of restiveness under what you style our injustice, tyranny, cruelty, etcetera, and we will teach you the submission which you preach but fail to practise by means of fire and sword and torture and death!\"  Many good men and true, with gentle spirits, and it may be somewhat exalted ideas about the rights of Royalty, accepted the Indulgence as being better than nothing, or better than civil war.  No doubt, also, there were a few--neither good men nor true--who accepted it because it afforded them a loophole of escape from persecution.  Similarly, on the other side, there were good men and true, who, with bolder hearts, perhaps, and clearer brains, it may be, refused the Indulgence as a presumptuous enactment, which cut at the roots of both civil and religious liberty, as implying a right to withhold while it professed to give, and which, if acquiesced in, would indicate a degree of abject slavery to man and unfaithfulness to God that might sink Scotland into a condition little better than that of some eastern nations at the present day.  Thus was the camp of the Covenanters divided.  There were also more subtle divisions, which it is not necessary to mention here, and in both camps, of course there was an infusion, especially amongst the young men, of that powerful element--love of excitement and danger for their own sake, with little if any regard to principle, which goes far in all ages to neutralise the efforts and hamper the energies of the wise.  Besides the acts of Indulgence, another and most tyrannical measure, already mentioned, had been introduced to crush if possible the Presbyterians.  _Letters of intercommuning_ were issued against a great number of the most distinguished Presbyterians, including several ladies of note, by which they were proscribed as rebels and cut off from all society.  A price, amounting in some instances to 500 pounbds sterling, was fixed on their heads, and every person, not excepting their nearest of kin, was prohibited from conversing with or writing to them, or of aiding with food, clothes, or any other necessary of life, on pain of being found guilty of the same crimes as the intercommuned persons.
