The youth replied by seizing one of the boxes, and lifting it with ease on his shoulder, shewing that, though destitute of fat, he had more than the average allowance of bone and sinew.  \"I doubt if you could do it better than that yourself, Larry,\" said Ned, laughing.  \"Come along, now, close at our heels, lest we get separated in the crowd.\"  The young porter knew the residence of Mr Thompson well, and guided them swiftly through the crowded thoroughfares towards it.  Passing completely through the town, he led them over the brow of one of the sand-hills beyond it, and descended into a little valley, where several neat villas were scattered along the sides of a pleasant green slope, that descended towards another part of the bay.  Turning into the little garden in front of one of these villas, he placed the box on the wooden platform before the door, and said, \"This is Mr Thompson's house.\"  There was something striking in the appearance of this young porter; he seemed much above his station in life; and Ned Sinton regarded his bronzed and handsome, but somewhat haggard and dissipated countenance, with interest, as he drew out his purse, and asked what was to pay.  \"Two dollars,\" answered the man.  Ned looked up in surprise.  The idea of paying eight shillings for so slight a service had never entered his imagination.  At that moment the door opened, and Mr Thompson appeared, and invited them to enter.  He was a shrewd, business-like man, with stern, but kind expression of countenance.  \"Come in, come in, and welcome to California,\" he said, on perusing the captain's letter of introduction.  \"Glad to see you, gentlemen.  You've not had breakfast, of course; we are just about to sit down.  This way,\" he added, throwing open the door of a comfortable and elegantly-furnished parlour.  \"Bring the boxes into the passage--that will do.  Here, Lizette, pay the men, dear; two dollars a-piece, I fancy--\"  \"Excuse me,\" interrupted Captain Bunting, \"only one bas to be paid, the other is one of my sailors.\"  \"Ah! very good; which is he?\"  Larry O'Neil stepped forward, hat in hand.  \"Go in there, my man, and cook will attend to you.\"  Larry passed through the doorway pointed out with a pleasant, fluttering sensation at the heart, which was quickly changed to a feeling of considerable disappointment on discovering that \"cook\" was a negro.  Meanwhile Lizette took two dollars from her purse, and bowing modestly to the strangers as she passed out of the room, advanced with them towards the young porter.  Now, Lizette was _not_ beautiful--few women are, in the highest sense of the term, and the few who are, are seldom interesting; but she was pretty, and sweet, and innocent, and just turned sixteen.  Fortunately for the male part of the world, there are many such.  She had light-brown hair, which hung in dishevelled curls all round, a soft fair complexion, blue eyes, and a turned-up nose--a pert little nose that said plainly, \"I _will_ have my own way; now see if I don't.\"  But the heart that animated the body to which that nose belonged, was a good, kind, earnest one; therefore, the nose having its own way was rather a blessing than otherwise to those happy individuals who dwelt habitually in the sunshine of Lizette's presence.  At this particular time, ladies were scarce in California.  The immense rush of men from all parts of the earth to the diggings had not been accompanied as yet by a corresponding rush of women, consequently the sight of a female face was, as it always ought to be, a source of comfort to mankind.  We say \"comfort\" advisedly, because life at the gold-mines was a hard, riotous, mammon-seeking, rugged, and, we regret to say it, ungodly life; and men, in whom the soft memories of \"other days\" were not entirely quenched, had need, sometimes, of the comforting reflection that there still existed beings on the earth who didn't rant, and roar, and drink, and swear, and wear beards, and boots, and bowie-knives.  There was double cause, then, for the gaze of respectful admiration with which the young porter regarded Lizette, as she said, \"Here is your fare, porter,\" and put the money into his hand, which he did not even thank her for, but continued to hold extended as if he wished her to take it back again.  Lizette did not observe the gaze, for she turned away immediately after giving him the money, and re-entered the parlour, whereupon the youth thrust both hands into his breeches-pockets, left the house, and returned slowly to the city, with the expression on his countenance of one who had seen a ghost.  Meanwhile Captain Bunting and Ned Sinton sat down with their host and hostess to a second breakfast, over which the former related the circumstances of the double loss of his crew and cargo.  \"You are unfortunate,\" said Mr Thompson, when the captain paused; \"but there are hundreds in nearly the same predicament.  Many of the fine-looking vessels you see in the harbour have lain helplessly there for months, the crews having taken French leave, and gone off to the diggings.\"  \"It's awkward,\" said the captain, with a troubled expression, as he slowly raised a square lump of pork to his mouth; \"what would you advise me to do?\"  \"Sell off the remnant of the cargo, and set up a floating boarding-house.\"  The square lump of pork disappeared, as the captain thrust it into his cheek in order to say, \"What?\" with a look of intense amazement.  Lizette laughed inadvertently, and, feeling that this was somewhat rude, she, in her effort to escape, plunged deeper into misfortune by turning to Sinton, with a blushing countenance, and asking him to take another cup of tea--a proposal that was obviously absurd, seeing that she had a moment before filled up his second cup.  Thus suddenly appealed to, Ned stammered, \"Thank you--if you--ah!--no, thank you, not any more.\"  \"Set up a floating boarding establishment,\" reiterated the merchant, in a tone of decision that caused them all to laugh heartily.  \"It may sound strange,\" he continued, \"but I assure you it's not a bad speculation.  The captain of an American schooner, whose crew deserted the very day she arrived, turned his vessel into a floating boarding-house, about two months ago, and I believe he's making a fortune.\"  \"Indeed,\" ejaculated the captain, helping himself to another mass of pork, and accepting Lizette's proffer of a third cup of tea.  \"You have no idea,\" continued the merchant, as he handed the bread to Ned, and pressed him to eat--\"you have no idea of the strange state of things here just now, and the odd ways in which men make money.  Owing to the rush of immigrants everything is enormously dear, and house-room is not to be had for love or money, so that if you were to fit up your ship for the purpose you could fill it at once.  At the various hotels in the city an ordinary meal at the _table d'hote_ costs from two to three dollars--eight and twelve shillings of our money--and there are some articles that bear fabulous prices.  It's a fact that eggs at this moment sell at a shilling each, and onions and potatoes at the same price; but then wages are enormously high.  How long this state of things will last no one can tell; in the meantime, hundreds of men are making fortunes.  Only the other day a ship arrived from New York, and one of the passengers, a `'cute' fellow, had brought out fifteen hundred copies of several newspapers, which he sold for a dollar each in less than two hours!  Then, rents are tremendous.  You will scarcely believe me when I tell you that the rent paid by the landlord of one of the hotels here is 110,000 dollars--about 22,000 pounds--a year, and it is but a poor building too.  My own warehouse, which is a building of only one storey, with a front of twenty feet, is rented to me at 40,000 dollars--8000 pounds a year--and rents are rising.\"  Ned and the captain leaned back in their chairs aghast at such statements, and began to entertain some doubts as to the sanity of their host; but the worthy merchant was a grave, quiet man, without a particle of romance in his composition, and he went on coolly telling them facts which Ned afterwards said made his hair almost stand on end, when he thought of how little money he possessed, and how much he would have to pay for the bare necessaries of life.  After some further converse on men and things in general, and on prospects at the mines, Mr Thompson said, \"And now, Captain Bunting, I'll tell you what I'll do.  I will go down to your ship, overhaul the cargo, and make you an offer for the whole in the lump, taking the saleable with the unsaleable.  This will, at any rate, put you in funds at once, and enable you to follow what course seems best.  Will that suit you?\"  \"It will,\" said the captain, \"and thank 'ee.  As for turning a boardin'-house keeper, I don't think I'm cut out for it.  Neither is my friend Sinton, eh?\"  \"Certainly not,\" answered Ned, laughing: \"we might as well become washerwomen.\"  \"You'd make a pretty good thing of it if you did,\" retorted Mr Thompson; \"would they not, Lizette? you know more about these things than I do.\"  \"Indeed, I cannot tell, papa, as I do not know the capabilities of our friends in that way; but I think the few washerwomen in the city must be making fortunes, for they charge two shillings a-piece for everything, large and small.\"  \"Now, then, gentlemen,\" said the merchant, rising, \"if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21734"],["title","The Golden Dream: Adventures in the Far West (#8)"],["body","have quite finished, we will walk down to the harbour and inspect the goods.\"  An arch smile played round Lizette's lips as she shook hands with Ned at parting, and she seemed on the point of speaking, but checked herself.  \"I beg pardon,\" said Ned, pausing, \"did you--\"  \"Oh, it was nothing!\" said Lizette; \"I was only going to remark that-- that if you set up in the washing line, I shall be happy to give you all the work I can.\"  \"Ahem!\" coughed Ned gravely, \"and if we should set up in the _other_ line, will you kindly come and board with us?\"  \"Hallo, Ned, what's keeping you?\" roared the captain.  \"Coming,\" shouted Ned, as he ran after him.  \"Where has Larry O'Neil gone?\"  \"He's away down before us to have a look at the town.  We shall find him, I doubt not, cruising about the quay.\"  In a few minutes the three friends were wending their way through the crowded streets back to the shore.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  THE FATE OF THE ROVING BESS--GAMBLING SCENES--MR. SINTON MAKES A NEW FRIEND--LARRY O'NEIL MAKES MONEY IN STRANGE WAYS--A MURDER, AND A BEGGAR'S DEATH--NED BECOMES A POOR MAN'S HEIR.  The remnant of the cargo of the _Roving Bess_ proved to be worth comparatively little--less even than had been anticipated.  After a careful inspection, Mr Thompson offered to purchase it \"in the slump\" for 1000 dollars--about 200 pounds sterling.  This was a heavy blow to poor Captain Bunting, who had invested his all--the savings of many years--in the present unfortunate venture.  However, his was not a nature to brood over misfortunes that could not be avoided, so he accepted the sum with the best grace he might, and busied himself during the next few days in assisting the merchant to remove the bales.  During this period he did not converse much with any one, but meditated seriously on the steps he ought to take.  From all that he heard, it seemed impossible to procure hands to man the ship at that time, so he began to entertain serious thoughts of \"taking his chance\" at the diggings after all.  He was by nature averse to this, however; and had nearly made up his mind to try to beat up recruits for the ship, when an event occurred that settled the matter for him rather unexpectedly. This event was the bursting out of a hurricane, or brief but violent squall, which, before assistance could be procured, dragged the _Roving Bess_ from her moorings, and stranded her upon the beach, just below the town.  Here was an end to sea-faring prospects.  The whole of his limited capital would not have paid for a tenth part of the labour necessary to refloat the ship, so he resolved to leave her on the beach, and go to the diggings.  Mr Thompson advised him to sell the hull, as it would fetch a good price for the sake of the timber, which at that time was much wanted in the town, but the captain had still a lurking hope that he might get his old ship afloat at some future period, and would not hear of it.  \"What,\" said he, \"sell the _Roving Bess_, which stands _A1_ at Lloyd's, to be broken up to build gold-diggers houses?  I trow not.  No, no; let her lie where she is in peace.\"  On the day after the squall, as Ned and the captain were standing on the shore regarding their late floating, and now grounded, home in sad silence, a long-legged, lantern-jawed man, in dirty canvas trousers, long boots, a rough coat, and broad straw hat, with an enormous cigar in his mouth, and both hands in his trousers-pockets, walked up and accosted them.  It did not require a second glance to know that he was a Yankee.  \"Guess that 'ere's pretty wall fixed up, stranger,\" he said, addressing the captain, and pointing with his nose to the stranded vessel.  \"It is,\" answered the captain, shortly.  \"Fit for nothin' but firewood, I calculate.\"  To this the captain made no reply.  \"I say, stranger,\" continued the Yankee, \"I wouldn't mind to give 'e 1000 dollars for her slick off.\"  \"I don't wish to sell her,\" replied the captain.  \"Say 1500,\" replied the man.  \"I tell you, I _won't_ sell her.\"  \"No!  Now that _is_ kurous.  Will 'e loan her, then!\"  Here Ned whispered a few words to the captain, who nodded his head, and, turning to the Yankee, said--  \"How much will you give?\"  \"Wall, I reckon, she's too far out to drive a screamin' trade, but I don't mind sayin' 100 dollars a month.\"  After some consultation with Ned, and a little more talk with the Yankee, Captain Bunting agreed to this proposal, only stipulating that the bargain should hold good for a year, that the hull should not be cut or damaged in any way, and that the rent should be paid in advance into the hands of Mr Thompson, as he himself was about to proceed to the gold-fields.  Having sealed and settled this piece of business at a neighbouring tavern, where the Yankee--Major Whitlaw--ordered a \"brandy-smash\" for himself and two \"gin-slings\" for his companions, (which they civilly declined, to his intense amazement,) the contracting parties separated.  \"That's rather a sudden transfer of our good ship,\" said Ned, laughing, as they walked towards the Plaza, or principal square of the town, where some of the chief hotels and gambling-houses were situated.  \"I feel half sorry for havin' done it,\" replied the captain; \"however, it can't be helped now, so I'll away to our friend Thompson's office, and tell him about it.\"  \"Then I shall wander about here until you return.  It will be dinner time at the hotels two hours hence.  Suppose we meet at the Parker House, and talk over our future plans while we discuss a chop?\"  To this the captain agreed, and then hurried off to his friend's office, while Ned entered the hotel.  A large portion of this building was rented by gamblers, who paid the enormous sum of 60,000 dollars a year for it, and carried on their villainous and degrading occupation in it night and day.  The chief games played were monte and faro, but no interest attached to the games _as such_, the winning or losing of money was that which lent fascination to the play.  Ned had intended to stroll through the hotel and observe the various visitors who thronged the bar, but the crash of a brass band in the gambling-saloons awakened his curiosity, and induced him to enter.  The scene that met his eyes was, perhaps, the strangest and the saddest he had ever looked upon.  The large saloon was crowded with representatives of almost every civilised nation under the sun.  English, Scotch, Irish, Yankees, French, Russians, Turks, Chinese, Mexicans, Indians, Malays, Jews, and negroes--all were there in their national costumes, and all were, more or less, under the fascinating influence of the reigning vice of California, and especially of San Francisco.  The jargon of excited voices can neither be conceived nor described.  Crowds surrounded the monte tables, on which glittering piles of gold and silver coin were passing from hand to hand according to varying fortune.  The characteristics--and we may add the worst passions--of the various nations were ever and anon brought strongly out.  The German and Spaniard laid down their money, and lost or won without a symptom of emotion; the Turk stroked his beard as if with the view of keeping himself cool; the Russian looked stolid and indifferent; the Frenchman started, frowned, swore, and occasionally clutched his concealed pistol or bowie-knife; while the Yankee stamped and swore.  But, indeed, the men of all nations cursed and swore in that terrible place.  Those who dwelt in the city staked gold and silver coin, while the men just returned from the mines staked gold-dust and nuggets.  These last were conspicuous from their rough clothing, rugged, bronzed, and weather-worn countenances.  Many of them played most recklessly. Several successful diggers staked immense sums, and either doubled or lost, in two or three throws, the hard earnings of many months of toil, and left the rooms penniless.  At one end of the saloon there was a counter, with a plentiful supply of stimulants to feed the excitement of the wretched gamblers; and the waiter here was kept in constant employment.  Ned had never been within the unhallowed precincts of a gambling-house before, and it was with a feeling of almost superstitious dread that he approached the table, and looked on.  A tall, burly, bearded miner stepped forward at the moment and placed a huge purse of gold-dust on the table--  \"Now, then,\" he cried, with a reckless air, \"here goes--neck or nothin'.\"  \"Nothin'!\" he muttered with a fearful oath, as the president raked the purse into his coffers.  The man rose and strode sullenly from the room, his fingers twitching nervously about the hilt of his bowie-knife; an action which the president observed, but heeded not, being prepared with a concealed revolver for whatever might occur.  Immediately another victim stepped forward, staked five hundred dollars--and won.  He staked again a thousand dollars--and won; then he rose, apparently resolved to tempt fickle fortune no more, and left the saloon.  As he retired his place was filled by a young man who laid down the small sum of two dollars. Fortune favoured this man for a long time, and his pile of dollars gradually increased until he became over-confident and staked fully half of his gains--and lost.  Ned's attention was drawn particularly to this player, whom he thought he had seen before.  On looking more fixedly at him, he recognised the young porter who had carried up the box to the merchant's house.  His next stake was again made recklessly.  He laid down all he possessed-- and lost.  Then he rose suddenly, and drawing a pistol from his breast, rushed towards the door.  None of the players who crowded the saloon paid him more than momentary attention.  It mattered not to them whether he meditated suicide or murder.  They made way for him to pass, and then, closing in, were deep again in the all-absorbing game.  But our hero was not thus callous.  A strong feeling of sympathy filled his breast, prompting him to spring"]]]
