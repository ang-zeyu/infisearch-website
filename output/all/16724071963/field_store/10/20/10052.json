He accordingly entered the counting-room where Gilbert, the book-keeper, was seated at a desk.  \"Here are the letters, Mr. Gilbert,\" said Dick.  \"Lay them down,\" said the book-keeper, sourly. \"You've been gone long enough. How many did you drop on the way?\"  \"I didn't know I was expected to drop any,\" said Dick. \"If I had been told to do so, I would have obeyed orders cheerfully.\"  Mr. Gilbert was about to remark that Dick was an impudent young rascal, when the sudden entrance of Mr. Rockwell compelled him to suppress the observation, and he was obliged to be content with muttering it to himself.  \"Back already, Richard?\" said his employer, pleasantly. \"Where are the letters?\"  \"Here, sir,\" said Dick.  \"Very well, you may go to Mr. Murdock, and see what he can find for you to do.\"  Mr. Rockwell sat down to read his letters, and Dick went as directed to the head clerk.  \"Mr. Rockwell sent me to you, Mr. Murdock,\" he said. \"He says you will find something for me to do.\"  \"Oh, yes, we'll keep you busy,\" said the head clerk, with a manner very different from that of the book-keeper. \"At present, however, your duties will be of rather a miscellaneous character. We shall want you partly for an entry clerk, and partly to run to the post-office, bank, and so forth.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said Dick. \"I'm ready to do anything that is required of me. I want to make myself useful.\"  \"That's the right way to feel, my young friend. Some boys are so big-feeling and put on so many airs, that you'd think they were partners in the business, instead of beginning at the lowest round of the ladder. A while ago Mr. Gilbert brought round a cousin of his, about your age, that he wanted to get in here; but the young gentleman was altogether too lofty to suit me, so we didn't take him.\"  \"Was the boy's name Roswell Crawford?\"  \"Yes; do you know him?\"  \"Not much. He thinks I'm too far beneath him for him to associate with, but he was kind enough to walk up Nassau Street with me this morning, just to encourage me a little.\"  \"That was kind in him, certainly,\" said the head clerk, smiling. \"Unless I am very much mistaken, you will be able to get along without his patronage.\"  \"I hope so,\" said Dick.  The rest of the day Dick was kept busy in various ways. He took hold with a will, and showed himself so efficient that he made a favorable impression upon every one in the establishment, except the book-keeper. For some reason or other Mr. Gilbert did not like Dick, and was determined to oust him from his situation if an opportunity should offer.     CHAPTER IV.  LIFE AT THE BOARDING-HOUSE.   Dick found his new quarters in Bleecker Street very comfortable. His room was kept in neat order, which was more than could be said of his former home in Mott Street. There once a fortnight was thought sufficient to change the sheets, while both boys were expected to use the same towel, and make that last a week. Indeed, Mrs. Mooney would have considered the boys \"mighty particular\" if they had objected to such an arrangement. Mrs. Browning, fortunately, was very different, and Dick found nothing to complain of either in his chamber or in the board which was furnished.  Dick had felt rather awkward on his first appearance at the table, but he was beginning to feel more at his ease. It was rather remarkable, considering his past life, how readily he adapted himself to an experience so different. He left the store at five o'clock, and got to his boarding-house in time to get ready for dinner. Dick had now got to be quite particular about his appearance. He washed his face and hands thoroughly, and brushed his hair carefully, before appearing at the table.  Miss Peyton, the lively young lady who has already been mentioned in the first chapter, sat near the boys, and evidently was quite prepossessed in their favor. Both had bright and attractive faces, though Dick would undoubtedly be considered the handsomest. He had a fresh color which spoke of good health, and was well-formed and strong. Henry Fosdick was more delicate in appearance; his face was thinner, and rather pale. It was clear that he was not as well able to fight his way through life as Dick. But there was something pleasant and attractive in his quiet sedateness, as well as in the frank honesty and humor that could be read in the glance of our friend Dick.  \"Won't you and your friend stop a little while and sing?\" asked Miss Peyton, addressing Henry Fosdick on the evening of the second day of Dick's business career.  Fosdick hesitated.  \"My friend has an engagement this evening,\" he said.  \"I suppose I may not ask where,\" said she.  \"I am invited to spend the evening with some friends on Madison Avenue,\" said Dick.  \"Indeed?\" said Miss Peyton, surprised. \"I wasn't aware you had such fashionable friends, or I couldn't have expected to retain you.\"  \"All my friends are not as fashionable,\" said Dick, wondering what the young lady would say if she could see his late fellow-lodgers at Mrs. Mooney's, on Mott Street.  \"If I can't hope to keep you this evening, you must promise to stay awhile to-morrow evening. I hope to have the pleasure of hearing you sing, Mr. Hunter.\"  \"When I give a concert,\" said Dick, \"I'll be sure to let you in gratooitous.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Miss Peyton. \"I shall remind you of it. I hope that time will come very soon.\"  \"Just as soon as I can engage the Academy of Music on reasonable terms.\"  \"You'd better try first in the parlor here. We'll take up a contribution, to pay you for your exertions.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"You're very kind, as the man said to the judge when he asked him when it would be perfectly agreeable for him to be hung.\"  Miss Peyton laughed at this remark, and Dick went upstairs to get ready for his visit to Madison Avenue.  Our hero felt a little bashful about this visit. He was afraid that he would do or say something that was improper, or that something would slip out which would betray his vagabond life of the streets.  \"I wish you was going with me, Fosdick,\" he said.  \"You'll get along well enough alone, Dick. Don't be afraid.\"  \"You see I aint used to society, Fosdick.\"  \"Nor I either.\"  \"But it seems to come natural to you. I'm always makin' some blunder.\"  \"You'll get over that in time, Dick. It's because you have so much fun in you. I am more sober. Miss Peyton seems very much amused by your odd remarks.\"  \"I have to talk so; I can't think of anything else to say.\"  \"There's one thing, Dick, we mustn't give up at any rate.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Studying. We don't either of us know as much as we ought to.\"  \"That's so.\"  \"You can see how much good studying has done for you so far. If it hadn't been for that, you wouldn't have been able to go into Mr. Rockwell's employment.\"  \"That's true enough, Fosdick. I'm afraid I don't know enough now.\"  \"You know enough to get along very well for the present, but you want to rise.\"  \"You're right. When I get to be old and infirm I don't want to be an errand-boy.\"  \"Nor I either. So, Dick, I think we had better make up our minds to study an hour or an hour and a half every evening. Of course, you can't begin this evening, but there are very few when you can't find the time.\"  \"I'll send a circ'lar to my numerous friends on Fifth Avenue and Madison, tellin' 'em how much I'm obliged for their kind invitations, but the claims of literatoor and science can't be neglected.\"  \"Do you know, Dick, I think it might be well for us to begin French?\"  \"I wonder what Johnny Nolan would say if I should inquire after his health in the polly-voo language?\"  \"It wouldn't be the first time you have astonished him.\"  \"Well, Fosdick, I'm in for it if you think it's best. Now tell me what necktie I shall wear?\"  Dick displayed two. One was bright red with large figures, which he had bought soon after he began to board in Mott Street. The other was a plain black.  \"You'd better wear the black one, Dick,\" said Fosdick, whose taste was simpler and better than his friend's.  \"It seems to me it don't look handsome enough,\" said Dick, whose taste had not yet been formed, and was influenced by the Bowery style of dress.  \"It's more modest, and that is all the better.\"  \"All right. I suppose you know best. Before I get ready I must give a new shine to my boots. I'm going to make them shine so you can see your face in them.\"  \"Better let me do that for you, Dick. I can do it while you're dressing, and that will save time.\"  \"No, Fosdick, I was longer in the business than you, and none of the boys could beat me on shines.\"  \"I don't know but you're right, Dick. I freely yield the palm to you in that.\"  Dick stripped off his coat and vest and went to work with a will. He had never worked so hard for one of his old customers.  \"I'm goin' to give it a twenty-five cent shine,\" he said.  Just then a knock was heard at the chamber-door.  \"Come in!\" said Dick, pausing a moment in his labors.  Mr. Clifton, a fellow-boarder, entered with a cigar in his mouth.  \"Holloa,\" said he, \"what's up? Going to the theatre, Hunter?\"  \"No,\" said Dick. \"I'm goin' out to spend the evening with some friends up in Madison Avenue.\"  \"So I heard you say at the table, but I thought you were joking.\"  \"No,\" said Dick; \"it's a fact.\"  \"Seems to me you handle the brush pretty skilfully,\" remarked Mr. Clifton. \"I should almost think you had served a regular apprenticeship at it.\"  \"So I have,\" answered Dick. \"Didn't you ever see me when I blacked boots on Chatham Square?\"  \"Good joke!\" said the young man, who was far from supposing that Dick was in earnest. \"Oh, yes, of course I've seen you often! Did you make money at it?\"  \"I retired on a fortun',\" said Dick, \"and now I've invested my capital in mercantile pursuits. There,\" and he took up one boot, and showed it to his visitor, \"did you ever see a better shine than that?\"  \"No, I didn't, that's a fact,\" said Clifton, admiringly. \"You beat the young rascal I employ all hollow. I say, Hunter, if you ever go into the 'shin"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21632"],["title","Fame and Fortune; or, The Progress of Richard Hunter (#5)"],["body","e' business again, I'll be a regular customer of yours.\"  \"He little thinks I've blacked his boots before now,\" thought Dick.  \"All right,\" said he, aloud. \"When a commercial crisis comes, and I fail in business, I think I'll remember your encouragin' offer, and remind you of it.\"  \"Have a cigar either of you?\" asked Clifton, drawing out a case. \"Excuse my not offering it before.\"  \"No, thank you,\" said Fosdick.  \"Don't smoke, eh? Won't you have one, Hunter?\"  \"No, thank you. Fosdick is my guardian, and he don't allow it.\"  \"So you're a good boy. Well, I wish you a pleasant evening,\" and Clifton sauntered out to find some other companion.  \"He wouldn't believe I'd been a boot-black,\" said Dick, \"even after I told him. I knew he wouldn't, or I wouldn't have said so. Is my hair parted straight?\"  \"Yes, it's all right.\"  \"How's my cravat?\"  \"It'll do. You're getting to be quite a dandy, Dick.\"  \"I want to look respectable; got it right that time. When I visit Turkey I want to look as the turkeys do. Won't you go with me,--as far as the door, I mean?\"  \"Yes, if you're going to walk.\"  \"I'd rather. I feel kind of nervous, and perhaps I'll walk it off.\"  The two boys got their caps, and walked up Broadway on the west side. The lights were already lit, and the shop windows made a brilliant display. At intervals places of amusement opened wide their hospitable portals, and large placards presented tempting invitations to enter.  They reached Union Square, and, traversing it, again walked up Broadway to Madison Park. At the upper end of this park commences the beautiful avenue which bears the same name. Only about half a dozen blocks now required to be passed, when the boys found themselves opposite a residence with a very imposing front.  \"This is the place,\" said Dick. \"I wish you were going in with me.\"  \"I hope you will have a pleasant time, Dick. Good-by till I see you again.\"  Dick felt a little nervous, but he summoned up all his courage, and, ascending the broad marble steps, rang the bell.     CHAPTER V.  DICK RECEIVES TWO VALUABLE PRESENTS.   At the end of the last chapter we left Dick standing on the steps of Mr. Rockwell's residence in Madison Avenue. He had rung the bell and was waiting to have his summons answered. To say that Dick expected to enjoy his visit would not be strictly true. He knew very well that his street education had not qualified him to appear to advantage in fashionable society, and he wished that Fosdick were with him to lend him countenance.  While under the influence of these feelings the door was thrown open, and a servant looked at him inquiringly.  \"Is Mr. Rockwell at home?\" asked Dick.  \"Yes. Would you like to see him?\"  \"He asked me to call this evening.\"  \"What! Are you the boy that saved Master Johnny from drowning?\" asked the servant, her face brightening up, for Johnny was a great favorite in the house.  \"I jumped into the water after him,\" said Dick, modestly.  \"I heard Mr. Rockwell say he was expecting you to-night. Come right in. Mistress is very anxious to see you.\"  Placed a little at his ease by this cordial reception, Dick followed the servant upstairs to a pleasant sitting-room on the second floor. Mr. and Mrs. Rockwell were seated at a centre-table reading the evening papers, while Johnny and his sister Grace were constructing a Tower of Babel with some blocks upon the carpet before the fire.  Dick entered, and stood just within the door, with his cap in his hand, feeling a little embarrassed.  \"I am glad to see you, Richard,\" said Mr. Rockwell, rising from his seat, and advancing to our hero with a pleasant smile. \"Mrs. Rockwell has been anxious to see you. My dear, this is the brave boy who saved our little Johnny.\"  Mrs. Rockwell, a tall, graceful lady, with a smile that quite captivated Dick, offered her hand, and said, earnestly, \"My brave boy, I have been wishing to see you. I shudder to think that, but for your prompt courage, I should now be mourning the loss of my dear little Johnny. Accept a mother's thanks for a favor so great that she can never hope to repay it.\"  Now this acknowledgment was very pleasant to Dick, but it was also very embarrassing. It is difficult to receive praise gracefully. So our hero, not knowing what else to say, stammered out that she was very welcome.  \"I understand that you have entered my husband's employment,\" said Mrs. Rockwell.  \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"He was kind enough to take me.\"  \"I hope to make a man of business of our young friend,\" said Mr. Rockwell. \"He will soon feel at home in his new position, and I hope we may find the connection mutually satisfactory.\"  \"Have you a pleasant boarding-place?\" asked Mrs. Rockwell.  \"Tip-top,\" said Dick. \"I mean pretty good,\" he added, in a little confusion.  \"Where is it?\"  \"In Bleecker Street,\" said Dick, very glad that he was not obliged to say Mott Street.  \"That is quite a good location,\" said Mr. Rockwell. \"How do you spend your evenings, Richard?\"  \"In studying with a friend of mine,\" said Dick. \"I want to know something by the time I grow up.\"  \"That is an excellent resolution,\" said his employer, with warm approval. \"I wish more boys of your age were equally sensible. You may depend upon it that a good education is the best preparation for an honorable and useful manhood. What is your friend's name?\"  \"Henry Fosdick. He rooms with me.\"  \"I am glad you have a friend who shares your tastes. But perhaps you would like to renew your acquaintance with the young gentleman to whom you have rendered so great a service. Johnny has been allowed to stay up beyond his usual bedtime because you were coming. Johnny, come here!\"  Johnny rose from his blocks, and came to his mother's side. He was a pleasant-looking little fellow, with a pair of bright eyes, and round, plump cheeks. He looked shyly at Dick.  \"Did you ever see this young man?\" asked his mother.  \"Yes,\" said Johnny.  \"When was it?\"  \"When I was in the river,\" said Johnny. \"He pulled me out.\"  \"Are you glad to see him?\"  \"Yes,\" said Johnny. \"What is his name?\"  \"Dick,\" said our hero, who somehow could not help feeling, when called Richard, that some other boy was meant.  \"Won't you come and help me build a house?\" asked little Johnny.  Dick accepted the invitation with pleasure, feeling more at home with children than with older persons.  \"This is sister Grace,\" said Johnny, with an offhand introduction.  \"I saw you on the boat,\" said Dick.  \"Yes,\" said Grace, \"I was there. Oh, how frightened I was when Johnny fell into the water! I don't see how you dared to jump in after him.\"  \"Oh, I've been in swimming many a time. I don't mind it,\" said Dick.  \"I s'pose you're used to it, like the fishes,\" said Johnny. \"I'm glad I'm not a fish. I shouldn't like to live in the water.\"  \"I don't think I should, either,\" said Dick. \"Now, what do you think the fishes do when it rains?\"  \"I do not know.\"  \"They go down to the bottom of the sea to get out of the wet.\"  \"Isn't it wet down at the bottom of the sea?\" asked Johnny, in good faith.  \"Of course it is, you little goose,\" said Grace, with an air of superior wisdom.  \"Will you make me a house?\" said Johnny.  \"What kind of a house do you want?\" said Dick, seating himself on the carpet, and taking up the blocks.  \"Any kind,\" said Johnny.  Dick, beginning to feel quite at home with the children, erected an imposing-looking house, leaving little spaces for the doors and windows.  \"That's better than the house Grace made,\" said Johnny, looking at it with complacency.  \"But it won't last very long,\" said Dick. \"You'd better sell it before it tumbles over.\"  \"Do you own any houses?\" asked Johnny.  \"Not many,\" said Dick, smiling.  \"My father owns this house,\" said Johnny, positively. \"He paid fifty dollars for it.\"  \"I didn't think houses were so cheap,\" said Dick. \"I'd like to buy one at that price.\"  \"You're a little goose, Johnny,\" said Grace. \"He gave as much as five hundred dollars.\"  \"Grace doesn't know much more about the price of real estate than Johnny,\" said Mr. Rockwell.  \"Didn't the house cost as much as five hundred dollars?\" asked Grace.  \"As much as that certainly, my dear.\"  Just then, by an unguarded movement of Johnny's foot, the edifice of blocks reared by Dick became a confused ruin.  \"I've got tired of building houses,\" he announced, \"Won't you tell me a story, Dick?\"  \"I don't think I know any,\" said our hero.  \"Here is a book of pictures,\" said his mother, bringing one from the table. \"Perhaps your new friend will show them to you.\"  Dick took the book, and felt very glad that he had learned to read. Otherwise he might have been considerably embarrassed.  The children asked a great many questions of Dick about the pictures, some of which he could not answer. Johnny, on being shown the picture of a Turkish mosque, asked if that was the place where the turkeys went to church.  \"If there was any place for a goose to go to church, you'd go there,\" said his sister.  \"I aint a goose any more than you are,\" said Johnny, indignantly; \"am I, Dick?\"  Just then the servant came in to carry the children to bed, and, considerably against their wishes, they were obliged to withdraw.  \"Come again, Dick,\" said Johnny.  \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"Good-night.\"  \"Good-night,\" said the two children, and the door closed upon them.  \"I think I'll be going,\" said Dick, who did not feel quite so much at ease, now that his young friends had left him.  \"Wait a few minutes,\" said Mrs. Rockwell.  She rang the bell, and a servant brought up some cake and apples, of which Dick was invited to partake.  I need not detail the conversation; but Mrs. Rockwell, with the tact of a genuine lady, managed to draw out Dick, and put him quite at his ease.  \"How old are you, Richard?\" she asked.  \"Fifteen,\" said Dick; \"goin' on sixteen.\"  \"You are getting to be quite a young man,--old enough to wear a watch. Have you one?\"  \"No,\" said Dick, not suspecting the motive that led to her question.  \"Will you allow me the"]]]
