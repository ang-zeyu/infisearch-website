The Firefly was hove to, a boat was lowered and rowed towards Barney, whose strong voice guided his shipmates towards him.  In less than a quarter of an hour the bold sailor and his young friend Martin Rattler were safe on board, and the ship's head was again turned out to sea.  It was full half an hour before Martin was restored to consciousness in the forecastle, to which his deliverer had conveyed him.  \"Musha, lad, but ye're booked for the blue wather now, an' no mistake!\" said Barney, looking with an expression of deep sympathy at the poor boy, who sat staring before him quite speechless.  \"The capting 'll not let ye out o' this ship till ye git to the gould coast, or some sich place.  He couldn't turn back av he wanted iver so much; but he doesn't want to, for he needs a smart lad like you, an' he'll keep you now, for sartin.\"  Barney sat down by Martin's side and stroked his fair curls, as he sought in his own quaint fashion to console him.  But in vain.  Martin grew quite desperate as he thought of the misery into which poor Aunt Dorothy Grumbit would be plunged, on learning that he had been swept out to sea in a little boat, and drowned, as she would naturally suppose.  In his frenzy he entreated and implored the captain to send him back in the boat and even threatened to knock out his brains with a handspike if he did not; but the captain smiled and told him that it was his own fault.  He had no business to be putting to sea in a small boat in rough weather, and he might be thankful he wasn't drowned.  He wouldn't turn back now for fifty pounds twice told.  At length Martin became convinced that all hope of returning home was gone.  He went quietly below, threw himself into one of the sailor's berths, turned his face to the wall, and wept long and bitterly.    CHAPTER SIX.  THE VOYAGE, A PIRATE, CHASE, WRECK, AND ESCAPE.  Time reconciles a man to almost anything.  In the course of time Martin Rattler became reconciled to his fate, and went about the ordinary duties of a cabin-boy on board the Firefly just as if he had been appointed to that office in the ordinary way,--with the consent of the owners and by the advice of his friends.  The captain, Skinflint by name, and as surly an old fellow as ever walked a quarter-deck, agreed to pay him wages, \"if he behaved well.\"  The steward, under whose immediate authority he was placed, turned out to be a hearty, good-natured young fellow, and was very kind to him.  But Martin's great friend was Barney O'Flannagan, the cook, with whom he spent many an hour in the night watches, talking over plans, and prospects, and retrospects, and foreign lands.  As Martin had no clothes except those on his back, which fortunately happened to be new and good, Barney gave him a couple of blue-striped shirts, and made him a jacket, pantaloons, and slippers of canvass; and, what was of much greater importance, taught him how to make and mend the same for himself.  \"Ye see, Martin, lad,\" he said, while thus employed one day, many weeks after leaving port, \"it's a great thing, intirely, to be able to help yerself.  For my part I niver travel without my work-box in my pocket.\"  \"Your work-box!\" said Martin, laughing.  \"Jist so.  An' it consists of wan sailmaker's needle, a ball o' twine, and a clasp-knife.  Set me down with these before a roll o' canvass and I'll make ye a'most anything.\"  \"You seem to have a turn for everything, Barney,\" said Martin.  \"How came you to be a cook?\"  \"That's more nor I can tell ye, lad.  As far as I remimber, I began with murphies, when I was two foot high, in my father's cabin in ould Ireland.  But that was on my own account intirely, and not as a purfession; and a sorrowful time I had of it too, for I was for iver burnin' my fingers promiskiously, and fallin' into the fire ivery day more or less--\"  \"Stand by to hoist top-gallant-sails,\" shouted the captain.  \"How's her head?\"  \"South and by east sir,\" answered the man at the wheel.  \"Keep her away two points.  Look alive lads.  Hand me the glass, Martin.\"  The ship was close hauled when these abrupt orders were given, battling in the teeth of a stiff breeze, off the coast of South America.  About this time, several piratical vessels had succeeded in cutting off a number of merchantmen near the coast of Brazil.  They had not only taken the valuable parts of their cargoes, but had murdered the crews under circumstances of great cruelty; and ships trading to these regions were, consequently, exceedingly careful to avoid all suspicious craft as much as possible.  It was, therefore, with some anxiety that the men watched the captain's face as he examined the strange sail through the telescope.  \"A Spanish schooner,\" muttered the captain, as he shut up the glass with a bang.  \"I won't trust her.  Up with the royals and rig out stun'-sails, Mr Wilson, (to the mate).  Let her fall away, keep her head nor'-west, d'you hear?\"  \"Ay, ay, sir.\"  \"Let go the lee braces and square the yards.  Look sharp, now, lads.  If that blackguard gets hold of us ye'll have to walk the plank, every man of ye.\"  In a few minutes the ship's course was completely altered; a cloud of canvass spread out from the yards, and the Firefly bounded on her course like a fresh race-horse.  But it soon became evident that the heavy barque was no match for the schooner, which crowded sail and bore down at a rate that bade fair to overhaul them in a few hours.  The chase continued till evening, when suddenly the look-out at the mast-head shouted, \"Land, ho!\"  \"Where away?\" cried the captain.  \"Right ahead,\" sang out the man.  \"I'll run her ashore sooner than be taken,\" muttered the captain, with an angry scowl at the schooner, which was now almost within range on the weather quarter, with the dreaded black flag flying at her peak.  In a few minutes breakers were descried ahead.  \"D'ye see anything like a passage?\" shouted the captain.  \"Yes, sir; two points on the weather bow.\"  At this moment a white cloud burst from the schooner's bow, and a shot, evidently from a heavy gun, came ricochetting over the sea.  It was well aimed, for it cut right through the barque's main-mast, just below the yard, and brought the main-top-mast, with all the yards, sails, and gearing above it, down upon the deck.  The weight of the wreck, also, carried away the fore-top-mast and, in a single instant, the Firefly was completely disabled.  \"Lower away the boats,\" cried the captain; \"look alive, now; we'll give them the slip yet.  It'll be dark in two minutes.\"  The captain was right.  In tropical regions there is little or no twilight.  Night succeeds day almost instantaneously.  Before the boats were lowered, and the men embarked, it was becoming quite dark.  The schooner observed the movement however, and, as she did not dare to venture through the reef in the dark, her boats were also lowered and the chase was recommenced.  The reef was passed in safety, and now a hard struggle took place, for the shore was still far-distant.  As it chanced to be cloudy weather the darkness became intense, and progress could only be guessed at by the sound of the oars; but these soon told too plainly that the boats of the schooner were overtaking those of the barque.  \"Pull with a will, lads,\" cried the captain; \"we can't be more than half a mile from shore; give way, my hearties.\"  \"Surely, captain, we can fight them, we've most of us got pistols and cutlasses,\" said one of the men in a sulky tone.  \"Fight them!\" cried the captain, \"they're four times our number, and every man armed to the teeth.  If ye don't fancy walking the plank or dancing on nothing at the yardarm, ye'd better pull away and hold your jaw.\"  By this time they could just see the schooner's boats in the dim light, about half-musket range astern.  \"Back you' oars,\" shouted a stern voice in broken English, \"or I blow you out de watter in one oder moment--black-yards!\"  This order was enforced by a musket shot which whizzed over the boat within an inch of the captain's head.  The men ceased rowing and the boats of the pirate ranged close up.  \"Now then, Martin,\" whispered Barney O'Flannagan, who sat at the bow oar, \"I'm goin' to swim ashore; jist you slip arter me as quiet as ye can.\"  \"But the sharks!\" suggested Martin.  \"Bad luck to them,\" said Barney as he slipped over the side, \"they're welcome to me.  I'll take my chance.  They'll find me mortial tough, anyhow.  Come along, lad, look sharp!\"  Without a moment's hesitation Martin slid over the gunwale into the sea, and, just as the pirate boats grappled with those of the barque, he and Barney found themselves gliding as silently as otters towards the shore. So quietly had the manoeuvre been accomplished, that the men in their own boat were ignorant of their absence.  In a few minutes they were beyond the chance of detection.  \"Keep close to me, lad,\" whispered the Irishman.  \"If we separate in the darkness we'll niver foregather again.  Catch hould o' my shoulder if ye get blowed, and splutter as much as ye like.  They can't hear us now, and it'll help to frighten the sharks.\"  \"All right,\" replied Martin; \"I can swim like a cork in such warm water as this.  Just go a little slower and I'll do famously.\"  Thus encouraging each other, and keeping close together, lest they should get separated in the thick darkness of the night, the two friends struck out bravely for the shore.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  MARTIN AND BARNEY GET LOST IN A GREAT FOREST, WHERE THEY SEE STRANGE AND TERRIBLE THINGS.  On gaining the beach, the first thing that Barney did, after shaking himself like a huge Newfoundland dog, was to ascertain that his pistol and cutlass were safe; for, although the former could be of no use in its present condition, still, as he sagaciously remarked, \"it was a good thing to have, for they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21750"],["title","Martin Rattler (#5)"],["body","chance to git powder wan day or other, and the flint would make fire, anyhow.\"  Fortunately the weather was extremely warm; so they were enabled to take off and wring their clothes without much inconvenience, except that in a short time a few adventurous mosquitoes--probably sea-faring ones--came down out of the woods and attacked their bare bodies so vigorously that they were fain to hurry on their clothes again before they were quite dry.  The clouds began to clear away soon after they landed, and the brilliant light of the southern constellations revealed to them dimly the appearance of the coast.  It was a low sandy beach skirting the sea and extending back for about a quarter of a mile in the form of a grassy plain, dotted here and there with scrubby under-wood.  Beyond this was a dark line of forest.  The light was not sufficient to enable them to ascertain the appearance of the interior.  Barney and Martin now cast about in their minds how they were to spend the night.  \"Ye see,\" said the Irishman, \"it's of no use goin' to look for houses, because there's maybe none at all on this coast; an' there's no sayin' but we may fall in with savages--for them parts swarms with them; so we'd better go into the woods an'--\"  Barney was interrupted here by a low howl, which proceeded from the woods referred to, and was most unlike any cry they had ever heard before.  \"Och but I'll think better of it.  P'raps it'll be as well _not_ to go into the woods, but to camp where we are.\"  \"I think so too,\" said Martin, searching about for small twigs and drift-wood with which to make a fire.  \"There is no saying what sort of wild beasts may be in the forest, so we had better wait till daylight.\"  A fire was quickly lighted by means of the pistol-flint and a little dry grass, which, when well bruised and put into the pan, caught a spark after one or two attempts, and was soon blown into a flame.  But no wood large enough to keep the fire burning for any length of time could be found; so Barney said he would go up to the forest and fetch some. \"I'll lave my shoes and socks, Martin, to dry at the fire.  See ye don't let them burn.\"  Traversing the meadow with hasty strides, the bold sailor quickly reached the edge of the forest where he began to lop off several dead branches from the trees with his cutlass.  While thus engaged, the howl which had formerly startled him was repeated.  \"Av I only knowed what ye was,\" muttered Barney in a serious tone, \"it would be some sort o' comfort.\"  A loud cry of a different kind here interrupted his soliloquy, and soon after the first cry was repeated louder than before.  Clenching his teeth and knitting his brows the perplexed Irishman resumed his work with a desperate resolve not to be again interrupted. But he had miscalculated the strength of his nerves.  Albeit as brave a man as ever stepped, when his enemy was before him, Barney was, nevertheless, strongly imbued with superstitious feelings; and the conflict between his physical courage and his mental cowardice produced a species of wild exasperation, which, he often asserted, was very hard to bear.  Scarcely had he resumed his work when a bat of enormous size brushed past his nose so noiselessly that it seemed more like a phantom than a reality.  Barney had never seen anything of the sort before, and a cold perspiration broke out upon him, when he fancied it might be a ghost.  Again the bat swept past close to his eyes.  \"Musha, but I'll kill ye, ghost or no ghost,\" he ejaculated, gazing all round into the gloomy depths of the woods with his cutlass uplifted. Instead of flying again in front of him, as he had expected, the bat flew with a whirring noise past his ear.  Down came the cutlass with a sudden thwack, cutting deep into the trunk of a small tree, which trembled under the shock and sent a shower of nuts of a large size down upon the sailor's head.  Startled as he was, he sprang backward with a wild cry; then, half ashamed of his groundless fears, he collected the wood he had cut, threw it hastily on his shoulder and went with a quick step out of the woods.  In doing so he put his foot upon the head of a small snake, which wriggled up round his ankle and leg.  If there was anything on earth that Barney abhorred and dreaded it was a snake.  No sooner did he feel its cold form writhing under his foot, than he uttered a tremendous yell of terror, dropped his bundle of sticks, and fled precipitately to the beach, where he did not halt till he found himself knee-deep in the sea.  \"Och, Martin, boy,\" gasped the affrighted sailor, \"it's my belafe that all the evil spirits on arth live in yonder wood; indeed I do.\"  \"Nonsense, Barney,\" said Martin, laughing; \"there are no such things as ghosts; at any rate, I'm resolved to face them, for if we don't get some sticks the fire will go out and leave us very comfortless.  Come, I'll go up with you.\"  \"Put on yer shoes then, avic, for the sarpints are no ghosts, anyhow, and I'm tould they're pisonous sometimes.\"  They soon found the bundle of dry sticks that Barney had thrown down, and returning with it to the beach, they speedily kindled a roaring fire, which made them feel quite cheerful.  True, they had nothing to eat; but having had a good dinner on board the barque late that afternoon, they were not much in want of food.  While they sat thus on the sand of the sea-shore, spreading their hands before the blaze and talking over their strange position, a low rumbling of distant thunder was heard.  Barney's countenance instantly fell.  \"What's the matter, Barney?\" inquired Martin, as he observed his companion gaze anxiously up at the sky.  \"Och, it's comin', sure enough.\"  \"And what though it does come?\" returned Martin; \"we can creep under one of these thick bushes till the shower is past.\"  \"Did ye iver see a thunder-storm in the tropics?\" inquired Barney.  \"No, never,\" replied Martin.  \"Then if ye don't want to feel and see it both at wance, come with me as quick as iver ye can.\"  Barney started up as he spoke, stuck his cutlass and pistol into his belt and set off towards the woods at a sharp run, followed closely by his wondering companion.  Their haste was by no means unnecessary.  Great black clouds rushed up towards the zenith from all points of the compass, and, just as they reached the woods, darkness so thick that it might almost be felt overspread the scene.  Then there was a flash of lightning so vivid that it seemed as if a bright day had been created and extinguished in a moment leaving the darkness ten times more oppressive.  It was followed instantaneously by a crash and a prolonged rattle, that sounded as if a universe of solid worlds were rushing into contact overhead and bursting into atoms.  The flash was so far useful to the fugitives, that it enabled them to observe a many-stemmed tree with dense and heavy foliage, under which they darted.  They were just in time, and had scarcely seated themselves among its branches when the rain came down in a way, not only that Martin had never seen, but that he had never conceived of before.  It fell, as it were, in broad heavy sheets, and its sound was a loud, continuous roar.  The wind soon after burst upon the forest and added to the hideous shriek of elements.  The trees bent before it; the rain was whirled and dashed about in water-spouts; and huge limbs were rent from some of the larger trees with a crash like thunder, and swept far away into the forest.  The very earth trembled and seemed terrified at the dreadful conflict going on above.  It seemed to the two friends as if the end of the world were come; and they could do nothing but cower among the branches of the tree and watch the storm in silence; while they felt, in a way they had never before experienced, how utterly helpless they were, and unable to foresee, or avert, the many dangers by which they were surrounded, and how absolutely dependent they were on God for protection.  For several hours the storm continued.  Then it ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and the bright stars again shone down upon a peaceful scene.  When it was over, Martin and his comrade descended the tree and endeavoured to find their way back to the beach.  But this was no easy matter.  The haste with which they had run into the woods, and the confusion of the storm, had made them uncertain in which direction it lay; and the more they tried to get out, the deeper they penetrated into the forest.  At length, wearied with fruitless wandering and stumbling about in the dark, they resolved to spend the night where they were. Coming to a place which was more open than usual, and where they could see a portion of the starry sky overhead, they sat down on a dry spot under the shelter of a spreading tree, and, leaning their backs against the trunk, very soon fell sound asleep.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  AN ENCHANTING LAND--AN UNCOMFORTABLE BED AND A QUEER BREAKFAST--MANY SURPRISES AND A FEW FRIGHTS, TOGETHER WITH A NOTABLE DISCOVERY.  \"I've woked in paradise!\"  Such was the exclamation that aroused Martin Rattler on the morning after his landing on the coast of South America.  It was uttered by Barney O'Flannagan, who lay at full length on his back, his head propped up by a root of the tree, under which they had slept, and his eyes staring right before him with an expression of concentrated amazement. When Martin opened his eyes, he too was struck dumb with surprise.  And well might they gaze with astonishment; for the last ray of departing daylight on the night before had flickered over the open sea, and now the first gleam of returning sunshine revealed to them the magnificent forests of Brazil.  Yes, well might they gaze and gaze again in boundless admiration; for the tropical sun shone down on a scene of dazzling and luxuriant vegetation, so resplendent that it seemed to them the realisation of a fairy tale.  Plants and shrubs and flowers were there, of the most curious and brilliant description,"]]]
