If there had been a gap in that hedge he would have charged like a thunderbolt, but there was no gap, and it is a strange fact that an ostrich cannot leap--at least he _will_ not.  The merest trifle of an obstruction--a bit of wall or hedge over which he could _step_ with perfect ease--is sufficient to check his advance and keep him in; that is, if he _walks_ up to it, but he is a stupid bird, and if he _runs_ up to such an obstruction he may _tumble_ over it, gather himself up on the other side, and so continue the charge.  On reaching a part of the hedge which dipped into a hollow, Hobson dismounted and opened the sack with the peace-offering.  The bird, after breasting up to the hedge and finding it impassable, sat down on what may be styled his elbows, scraped his wings on the ground, and rolled his head and neck about in a fashion that is indescribable.  This, I was told, was his method of rousing himself, or of relieving his feelings. It looked more like making a fool of himself.  A handful of mealies seemed to irritate him at first, but by degrees the temptation became too strong.  He commenced to pick a few seeds--ready, however, on the smallest provocation, to forsake them, charge up to the hedge, and hiss at us.  \"Now, Johnny, I'll keep him in play,\" said Hobson senior.  \"You go round to the nest.  Keep well down in the hollows, else he'll be sure to see you.\"  Johnny at once rode off.  The suspicious David looked after him and showed a tendency to retire in the direction of his nest, but Hobson raised his forked stick over the hedge and made a demonstration therewith.  This was more than enough.  Inflated with rage David at once accepted the challenge, and rushed back to the hedge, over which another handful of mealies were thrown at him, but mealies had lost much of their power by that time.  Thus, with alternate taunt and temptation was the false attack maintained by the father, while the real attack was made by the son, at the other extremity of the fortress.  I followed the real attack.  We did not go direct.  The bird would at once have made for its nest had we done so.  We rode off in the direction in which we had come until out of sight, and then, making a long circuit at full gallop, came round to the other end of the enclosure, from which point the enemy could not be seen.  There was a wall to cross, then a deep hollow through which the little stream ran, then a belt of pretty thick bushes, beyond which, on the open plain, the nest was known to lie--if I may call that a nest which is a mere hollow in the sand, in which the eggs are laid.  Here the female sits all day while the male marches about on guard.  At night the male sits while the female goes about and feeds.  They are most attentive parents, and there is a fitness in this arrangement as regards colour, for the brown female squatted on the brown Karroo is almost invisible in daylight, while the black male is equally invisible during the darkness of the night.  \"You mustn't come with me,\" said Johnny, dismounting; \"it would only increase the chance of my being seen by David.\"  I was detailed, therefore, to the inglorious duty of holding the horses, while my young friend made the assault alone.  He leaped the wall, descended into the bed of the stream, scrambled up the opposite bank, crossed the clump of small wood, and came out into the open.  Now a short piece of this open--fifty yards or so, perhaps-- was visible from the lower end of the field, where Hobson and David were still coquetting with each other.  Johnny tried to skulk over this open ground.  He might as well have sought to evade the eyes of Argus.  The long-sighted bird caught the very first glint of his cap.  Insult and mealies were alike unavailing now.  He forsook the sire and made at the son with his great compass-like legs, covering the ground in tremendous as well as rapid strides.  No race-horse ever cleared the ground like David Marais!  Johnny saw that the \"game was up.\"  Applying his own long legs to the ground with a will, he rushed at the nest.  The female bounced up, ran a few yards, and squatted in helpless stupidity.  Johnny counted the eggs, turned, and fled.  Not a moment too soon!  Indeed he was too late, for the ostrich was already close up, and Johnny's retreat by the way he had come was cut off; but he turned at a sharp angle, and made for another clump of bushes, through which he plunged with a wild hilarious laugh, into the safe retreat of the river-bed.  David Marais could not follow there, but he doubtless consoled himself with the reflection that he had gallantly defended his wife and little ones, and had beaten the enemy from the field!  Nothing of all this had I seen, for the belt of bushes hid the actors from view, but I heard the ringing laugh with rather anxious surprise, and saw Johnny emerge immediately after from the banks of the stream, flushed and panting from his adventure.  That I do not exaggerate the power and ferocity of these birds, may be gathered from an incident which occurred to Hobson himself, and which he related on our way home.  One morning he rode to the enclosure of the bird named Master, and entered, intending to feed him and his wife with mealies.  Master must have risen off his wrong side that morning, for, instead of amiably accepting his breakfast, he made a sudden and furious rush at his benefactor.  Hobson's horse wheeled round and bolted,--no wonder, with the claw of an ostrich acting as a spur on his flank!  The horse was so frightened that he fairly ran away.  Master ran after him, and, being much fleeter, kept on kicking his legs and flanks, so that they were soon covered with blood, and once he kicked so high as to cut the crupper.  The horse became almost mad with terror, and quite ungovernable.  It was chased round and round the place, the walls being too high to leap, and the gate having been closed.  At last the horse dashed madly into a mimosa bush, and stuck fast.  The impetuous Master followed, but, before he could back out, Hobson caught him by the throat in his powerful grasp.  He held on until Master choked.  Not wishing to kill the bird, he then let go, and Master dropped like a stone.  Hobson then galloped to the river, but Master, who recovered immediately, came rushing on to renew the attack.  Hobson, however, had found shelter and safety behind some bushes in the bed of the stream.  Not long after our visit to David Marais, I went with Six-foot Johnny to the territory which belonged to Blind-boy.  That sagacious bird was not so blind but that, with his one eye, he observed us coming, and met us more than half-way.  Knowing him to be, comparatively, a peaceable bird, and being mounted, we entered the enclosure and rode towards him.  From certain symptoms and rufflings of the feathers and cockings of the tail, however, my companion knew that Blind-boy was not as amiable as might have been wished.  \"Take care,\" said Johnny.  \"Why?\" said I.  \"Because he's angry.\"  The signs of wrath did not appear to me very obvious, but I afterwards came to understand that, in an ostrich, a small amount of demonstration means an extreme depth of anger.  We rode slowly forward.  Blind-boy advanced as slowly, with a dangerous motion of the wings.  \"Keep on this side of the ditch,\" said Johnny.  \"Now, then, we'd better be off.\"  Before I well understood that it was advisable to get out of the bird's way, my companion had put spurs to his horse, and was off like an arrow. Or ever I was aware what my horse meant to do, I was almost thrown to the ground.  He whirled on his hind-legs--without orders,--and went off like the wind.  Nothing but a natural tendency to hold tight with my knees prevented me from being left beside Blind-boy.  We went at racing-speed to the gate, and then found, on looking back, that we might have spared ourselves the rush, for Blind-boy was standing as we left him!  The ditch had proved an impassable barrier, and he was gazing after us in apparent wonder at our haste.  My own wonder at the smart behaviour of my horse was removed when Johnny told me that it was the identical steed his father had ridden when attacked, as I have described, by Master.  Johnny himself was once assaulted, trampled on, and severely cut about the head, by one of these same ostriches, and might have been killed if his father had not chanced to be at hand.  Johnny was younger at the time, and, in the foolish ardour of youth, attempted to rise when knocked down.  This gave the ostrich the opportunity of once and again repeating his blows.  If the lad had lain still he would have suffered less.  I might draw a beautiful moral on submission and humility out of this, but won't.  Strange to say, the male ostrich loses nearly all his courage when out of his own proper paddock or domain.  This was illustrated to me one morning in the case of Gouws.  We were walking by the side of his enclosure, and he was advancing to meet us in his own warlike style, when we observed that the gate was open.  Before we could get near to close it Gouws marched through.  If we had entered his grounds an attack would have been highly probable, but no sooner did he find himself outside the accustomed wall than the spirit in him changed.  He looked confusedly round at the unfamiliar objects, then dropped his defiant tail, and fled.  It cost us the better part of a forenoon, with temperature at 105 degrees in the shade, before we succeeded in driving that bird back into his own paddock, and all that time he was running away from us, overwhelmed, apparently, with fear!

Ah, those were happy days, when, with a congenial spirit, I drove and galloped over the South African plains.  There was not much in the way of thrilling incidents, to be sure, and nothing whatever of wild adventure, but there was novelty"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21704"],["title","Six Months at the Cape (#7)"],["body"," everything, and possibilities enough to keep the spirit ever on the alert.  We used to ride out sometimes after steenboks,--small brown creatures, that made little show when bagged, but then there were huge and horrid vultures to remind one of the sandy desert, and there were pauws-- gigantic birds that were splendid eating; and the very thought that I trod on land which little more than quarter of a century back had been marked by the print of the royal lion was in itself sufficient to arouse unwonted interest, which was increased by the knowledge of the fact that the kloofs or glens and gorges of the blue hills on the horizon were at that time the natural homes of leopards or \"Cape-tigers\" and huge baboons.  These animals are, however, extremely wary.  The baboons go about in troops, and are wont to leave a trusty old-man baboon on guard, while the rest go down at early morn to rob the settler of his fruits and vegetables.  If the old man happens to see or scent danger he gives a signal and the troop flies helter-skelter to the nearest cliffs.  They are therefore not easily got at by hunters.  As to \"tigers,\" they go about stealthily like cats.  I was told there was not a chance of getting a shot at them, unless I went out with dogs and a hunting party for the purpose.  As this could not be accomplished at the time, I had to content myself with smaller game.  Bonny, (one of Hobson's younger sons), and I went out one day after breakfast to try for a steenbok before dinner.  There were plenty of them in the stretches of bush-land that dotted the Karroo in the immediate neighbourhood of the farmhouse.  Stretching out at a gallop with that light-hearted cheerfulness which is engendered by bright weather, fresh air, and a good mount, we skirted the river where Hreikie nursed her little flock.  Hreikie was a small Hottentot girl, as lightly clad as was compatible with propriety.  Her face was dirty brown, her mouth large, her nose a shapeless elevation with two holes in the front of it.  Her head was not covered, but merely sprinkled with tight woolly knobs or curls the size of peas.  Each knob grew apart from its neighbour knob, and was surrounded, so to speak, by bald or desert land.  This style of hair was not peculiar to Hreikie alone, but to the whole Hottentot race. Hreikie's family consisted of thirty-three young ostriches, which, though only a few weeks of age, stood, I think, upwards of two feet high.  Some of them had been brought out by artificial incubation--had been heated, as it were, into existence without maternal aid.  These birds, Bonny said, had been already purchased for 15 pounds sterling apiece, and were deliverable to the purchaser in six months.  They were fed and guarded all day and housed each evening with tender solicitude by their Hottentot stepmother, whom the birds evidently regarded as their own natural parent.  We swept on past the garden, where, on a previous morning, Bonny and I had killed a deadly green-tree snake upwards of five feet long, and where, on many other mornings, he and I, with sometimes other members of the family entered into strong temptation among the magnificent fruit. We used to overcome the temptation by giving way to it!  There were plums, peaches, figs, apples, apricots, grapes, nectarines, and other fruits, with which the trees were so laden that some of the branches had given way and their luscious loads were lying on the ground.  Cartloads of these were given away to friends, and to any one, as there was no market for their disposal.  Many splendid gardens like this exist on what is sometimes styled the barren Karroo; but the land is anything but barren.  All it requires is a copious supply of water, and wherever farmers have taken the trouble to form dams and store the heavy though infrequent rains, gardens of the most prolific kind have been the result.  The Karroo-bush itself, which gives name to these plains, is a succulent plant, which thrives in the almost waterless soil, and forms a rich pasturage for sheep and cattle. Hobson's garden--copiously watered by streams led out from his large dams--was a beautiful shady oasis of green and gold, in the midst of what, to some eyes, might have appeared a desert, but which, if irrigated properly, would become a perfect paradise of fertility.  We cantered on over the plain, till the garden and the farm looked in the distance like ships at sea, and rode among the bushes that crowned a rising ground.  We set up some guinea-fowl and other birds, and startled a hare, but let them go, as our aim was steenboks.  The little boks, however, were not on the knoll that day, so away we went again at a gallop until the garden and the farm went down on the horizon.  Sometimes we kept together and chatted, at other times we diverged and skirted small clumps of underwood on opposite sides.  At one time, while separated from Bonny, I saw a large stone lying on the ground.  As I looked, the stone began to crawl!  It was a tortoise, fully as large as a soup-tureen.  The sight of an animal in its \"native wilds,\" which you have all your life been accustomed to see in zoological gardens, has something peculiar, almost absurd, in it.  As it is with animals, so it is with other objects.  I remember being impressed with this idea, for the first time, in the south of France, when I beheld a tree covered with lemons--a fruit which, up to that period, had been connected in my mind with grocers' windows and brown sugar!  I turned aside and dismounted.  The sluggish tortoise stopped, recognised in me an enemy, and drew in its head and feet.  After lifting and looking at him I set him down.  Then it occurred to me that some one had said a tortoise could carry a man.  I stepped upon this one's back forthwith.  He lay perfectly still for some time.  At last with great caution the head and feet were protruded.  Another pause, as if of meditation, then the feet were applied to the ground; they pushed and strained, until finally the creature advanced about two inches, and then stopped!  This was not much, but it was sufficient to prove his great strength, and to convince me that a large tortoise could easily have walked off with a little boy.  I found Bonny dismounted and waiting.  \"No steenboks to-day, I fear,\" he said.  \"We must have a shot at something, Bonny,\" said I, dismounting, and sitting down on an anthill.  Having been a fair average shot in a rifle corps in Scotland I took careful aim at a small bush, bent on doing credit to the British Volunteers.  The result was a \"bull's-eye.\"  \"Capital!\" exclaimed Bonny; \"if you shoot like that you'll kill plenty of boks.\"  Half an hour later I was passing round the left of a knoll, while Bonny took the right.  Up leaped a steenbok, which ran a hundred yards or so, and stopped to look at me.  I was already off the horse and down in the Hythe position.  A careful aim was again taken.  The result was \"a miss!\" while the small deer vanished like the smoke of my rifle.  So great is the difference between target-practice and hunting!  It was time now to think of returning for dinner.  I was thoroughly lost by that time in the vast plain--like a ship at sea without a compass. But Bonny was as knowing in Karroo-craft as a Kentucky hunter is in wood-craft.  He steered as true a course for home as if he had smelt the leg of mutton that was roasting at the fire.  Probably he did--in imagination!  Soon the two ships reappeared on the horizon; our fleet nags quickly transformed them into the garden and the farm, and in half an hour we were relating our mild adventure round Hobson's hospitable board.  \"I'm going to visit brother Jonathan after dinner: will you come?\" said my host.  \"Yes, with pleasure,\" said I, \"but first, while you have your siesta, [midday nap], I will go into the opposite field and make that long-talked-of sketch of your house.\"  \"Very good; I'll send for you when the cart is ready.  There are some ostriches in the field, but you don't need to mind them, for they are quite young, although full-grown.\"  It is a common custom among South Africans to take a nap in the heat of the day during summer.  They dine early, and the power of the sun at that part of the day renders work almost impossible.  I could not at first fall in with this custom; therefore, while the family retired, I took my sketch-book and colours and went off to the field.  There was a mound, whence I could obtain a good view of the house with its surroundings, the cattle-kraal or enclosure, the course of the little stream, with one of the small dams or lakelets, and the garden, the whole backed by the blue mountain range on the horizon.  The sun was blazing fiercely, but, as before remarked, I delight in heat.  Selecting a stone I sat down, opened my book and colour-box, and began.  To those who don't know it, I may say that sketching is a most fascinating and engrossing species of work.  I soon forgot where I was, forgot Hobson, forgot time, forgot every thing in fact except the glowing face of nature, when a sound recalled me.  I looked round and observed eight or ten huge ostriches stalking towards me with slow funereal gait.  I felt somewhat uneasy,--for their youth, of which Hobson had assured me, was in no way indicated by their huge bodies and dreadful legs.  However, I had taken the precaution to carry my forked stick, and drawing it nearer continued at my work with an easier mind. If they meant war I knew escape to be hopeless, for the nearest wall was a quarter of a mile off.  The females halted at a respectful distance, but two of the largest black males came stalking close up to me and stood still, gazing intently, first with one eye, then with the other, at a distance of about six yards.  Meanwhile some of the females sat down, and one of them put herself in an attitude so absurd that I introduced her into the drawing.  Presently the largest male advanced a little nearer, and kept somewhat behind me. This was"]]]
