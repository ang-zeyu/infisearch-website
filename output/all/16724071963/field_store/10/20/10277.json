One glance of intelligence passed from Crusoe's eye, and in a moment he was away at full gallop; nor did he rest until the lost article was lying at his master's feet.  Dick was loath to try how far back on his track Crusoe would run if desired.  He had often gone back five and six miles at a stretch; but his powers did not stop here.  He could carry articles back to the spot from which they had been taken and leave them there.  He could head the game that his master was pursuing and turn it back; and he would guard any object he was desired to \"watch\" with unflinching constancy.  But it would occupy too much space and time to enumerate all Crusoe's qualities and powers.  His biography will unfold them.  In personal appearance he was majestic, having grown to an immense size even for a Newfoundland.  Had his visage been at all wolfish in character, his aspect would have been terrible.  But he possessed in an eminent degree that mild, humble expression of face peculiar to his race.  When roused or excited, and especially when bounding through the forest with the chase in view, he was absolutely magnificent.  At other times his gait was slow, and he seemed to prefer a _quiet_ walk with Dick Varley to anything else under the sun.  But when Dick was inclined to be boisterous Crusoe's tail and ears rose at a moment's notice, and he was ready for _anything_.  Moreover, he obeyed commands instantly and implicitly.  In this respect he put to shame most of the _boys_ of the settlement, who were by no means famed for their habits of prompt obedience.  Crusoe's eye was constantly watching the face of his master.  When Dick said \"Go\" he went, when he said \"Come\" he came.  If he had been in the midst of an excited bound at the throat of a stag, and Dick had called out, \"Down, Crusoe,\" he would have sunk to the earth like a stone.  No doubt it took many months of training to bring the dog to this state of perfection; but Dick accomplished it by patience, perseverance, and _love_.  Besides all this, Crusoe could speak!  He spoke by means of the dog's dumb alphabet in a way that defies description.  He conversed, so to speak, with his extremities--his head and his tail.  But his eyes, his soft brown eyes, were the chief medium of communication.  If ever the language of the eyes was carried to perfection, it was exhibited in the person of Crusoe.  But, indeed, it would be difficult to say which part of his expressive face expressed most.  The cocked ears of expectation; the drooped ears of sorrow; the bright, full eye of joy; the half-closed eye of contentment; and the frowning eye of indignation accompanied with a slight, a very slight, pucker of the nose and a gleam of dazzling ivory--ha! no enemy ever saw this last piece of canine language without a full appreciation of what it meant.  Then as to the tail--the modulations of meaning in the varied wag of that expressive member!  Oh! it's useless to attempt description.  Mortal man cannot conceive of the delicate shades of sentiment expressible by a dog's tail, unless he has studied the subject--the wag, the waggle, the cock, the droop, the slope, the wriggle!  Away with description--it is impotent and valueless here!  As we have said, Crusoe was meek and mild.  He had been bitten, on the sly, by half the ill-natured curs in the settlement, and had only shown his teeth in return.  He had no enmities--though several enemies--and he had a thousand friends, particularly among the ranks of the weak and the persecuted, whom he always protected and avenged when opportunity offered.  A single instance of this kind will serve to show his character.  One day Dick and Crusoe were sitting on a rock beside the lake--the same identical rock near which, when a pup, the latter had received his first lesson.  They were conversing as usual, for Dick had elicited such a fund of intelligence from the dog's mind, and had injected such wealth of wisdom into it, that he felt convinced it understood every word he said.  \"This is capital weather, Crusoe; ain't it pup?\"  Crusoe made a motion with his head which was quite as significant as a nod.  \"Ha! my pup, I wish that you and I might go and have a slap at the grizzly bars and a look at the Rocky Mountains.  Wouldn't it be nuts, pup?\"  Crusoe looked dubious.  \"What, you don't agree with me!  Now, tell me, pup, wouldn't ye like to grip a bar?\"  Still Crusoe looked dubious, but made a gentle motion with his tail, as though he would have said, \"I've seen neither Rocky Mountains nor grizzly bars, and know nothin' about 'em, but I'm open to conviction.\"  \"You're a brave pup,\" rejoined Dick, stroking the dog's huge head affectionately.  \"I wouldn't give you for ten times your weight in golden dollars--if there be sich things.\"  Crusoe made no reply whatever to this.  He regarded it as a truism unworthy of notice; he evidently felt that a comparison between love and dollars was preposterous.  At this point in the conversation a little dog with a lame leg hobbled to the edge of the rocks in front of the spot where Dick was seated, and looked down into the water, which was deep there.  Whether it did so for the purpose of admiring its very plain visage in the liquid mirror, or finding out what was going on among the fish, we cannot say, as it never told us; but at that moment a big, clumsy, savage-looking dog rushed out from the neighbouring thicket and began to worry it.  \"Punish him, Crusoe,\" said Dick quickly.  Crusoe made one bound that a lion might have been proud of, and seizing the aggressor by the back, lifted him off his legs and held him, howling, in the air--at the same time casting a look towards his master for further instructions.  \"Pitch him in,\" said Dick, making a sign with his hand.  Crusoe turned and quietly dropped the dog into the lake.  Having regarded his struggles there for a few moments with grave severity of countenance, he walked slowly back and sat down beside his master.  The little dog made good its retreat as fast as three legs would carry it, and the surly dog, having swam ashore, retired sulkily, with his tail very much between his legs.  Little wonder, then, that Crusoe was beloved by great and small among the well-disposed of the canine tribes of the Mustang Valley.  But Crusoe was not a mere machine.  When not actively engaged in Dick Varley's service, he busied himself with private little matters of his own.  He undertook modest little excursions into the woods or along the margin of the lake, sometimes alone, but more frequently with a little friend whose whole heart and being seemed to be swallowed up in admiration of his big companion.  Whether Crusoe botanised or geologised on these excursions we will not venture to say.  Assuredly he seemed as though he did both, for he poked his nose into every bush and tuft of moss, and turned over the stones, and dug holes in the ground--and, in short, if he did not understand these sciences, he behaved very much as if he did.  Certainly he knew as much about them as many of the human species do.  In these walks he never took the slightest notice of Grumps (that was the little dog's name), but Grumps made up for this by taking excessive notice of _him_.  When Crusoe stopped, Grumps stopped and sat down to look at him.  When Crusoe trotted on, Grumps trotted on too.  When Crusoe examined a bush Grumps sat down to watch him, and when he dug a hole Grumps looked into it to see what was there.  Grumps never helped him; his sole delight was in looking on.  They didn't converse much, these two dogs.  To be in each other's company seemed to be happiness enough--at least Grumps thought so.  There was one point at which Grumps stopped short, however, and ceased to follow his friend; and that was when he rushed headlong into the lake and disported himself for an hour at a time in its cool waters.  Crusoe was, both by nature and training, a splendid water-dog.  Grumps, on the contrary, held water in abhorrence, so he sat on the shores of the lake disconsolate when his friend was bathing, and waited till he came out. The only time when Grumps was thoroughly nonplussed, was when Dick Varley's whistle sounded faintly in the far distance.  Then Crusoe would prick up his ears, and stretch out at full gallop, clearing ditch, and fence, and brake with his strong elastic bound, and leaving Grumps to patter after him as fast as his four-inch legs would carry him.  Poor Grumps usually arrived at the village, to find both dog and master gone, and would betake himself to his own dwelling, there to lie down and sleep, and dream, perchance, of rambles and gambols with his gigantic friend.    CHAPTER FIVE.  A MISSION OF PEACE--UNEXPECTED JOYS--DICK AND CRUSOE SET OFF FOR THE LAND OF THE RED-SKINS, AND MEET WITH ADVENTURES BY THE WAY AS A MATTER OF COURSE--NIGHT IN THE WILD WOODS.  One day the inhabitants of Mustang Valley were thrown into considerable excitement by the arrival of an officer of the United States army and a small escort of cavalry.  They went direct to the block-house, which, since Major Hope's departure, had become the residence of Joe Blunt-- that worthy having, by general consent, been deemed the fittest man in the settlement to fill the major's place.  Soon it began to be noised abroad that the strangers had been sent by Government to endeavour to bring about, if possible, a more friendly state of feeling between the whites and the Indians, by means of presents, and promises, and fair speeches.  The party remained all night in the block-house, and ere long it was reported that Joe Blunt had been requested, and had consented, to be the leader and chief of a party of three"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21728"],["title","The Dog Crusoe and his Master (#6)"],["body","who should visit the neighbouring tribes of Indians, to the west and north of the valley, as Government agents.  Joe's knowledge of two or three different Indian dialects, and his well-known sagacity, rendered him a most fitting messenger on such an errand.  It was also whispered that Joe was to have the choosing of his comrades in this mission, and many were the opinions expressed and guesses made as to who would be chosen.  That same evening Dick Varley was sitting in his mother's kitchen cleaning his rifle; his mother was preparing supper and talking quietly about the obstinacy of a particular hen that had taken to laying her eggs in places where they could not be found; Fan was coiled up in a corner sound asleep, and Crusoe was sitting at one side of the fire looking on at things in general.  \"I wonder,\" remarked Mrs Varley, as she spread the table with a pure white napkin; \"I wonder what the sodgers are doin' wi' Joe Blunt.\"  As often happens when an individual is mentioned, the worthy referred to opened the door at that moment and stepped into the room.  \"Good-e'en t'ye, dame,\" said the stout hunter, doffing his cap, and resting his rifle in a corner, while Dick rose and placed a chair for him.  \"The same to you, Master Blunt,\" answered the widow; \"you've jist comed in good time for a cut o' venison.\"  \"Thanks, mistress, I s'pose we're beholden to the silver rifle for that.\"  \"To the hand that aimed it, rather,\" suggested the widow.  \"Nay, then, say raither to the dog that turned it,\" said Dick Varley. \"But for Crusoe that buck would ha' bin couched in the woods this night.\"  \"Oh! if it comes to that,\" retorted Joe, \"I'd lay it to the door o' Fan, for if she'd niver bin born nother would Crusoe.  But it's good an' tender meat, whativer ways ye got it.  Howsiver, I've other things to talk about jist now.  Them sodgers that are eatin' buffalo tongues up at the block-house as if they'd niver ate meat before, and didn't hope to eat agin for a twelve-month--\"  \"Ay, what o' them?\" interrupted Mrs Varley; \"I've bin wonderin' what was their errand.\"  \"Of coorse ye wos, Dame Varley; and I've comed here a' purpis to tell ye.  They want me to go to the Red-skins to make peace between them and us; and they've brought a lot o' goods to make them presents withal,-- beads, an' knives, an' lookin'-glasses, an vermilion paint, an' sich-like, jist as much as'll be a light load for one horse--for, ye see, nothin' can be done wi' the Red-skins without gifts.\"  \"'Tis a blessed mission,\" said the widow, \"I wish it may succeed.  D'ye think ye'll go?\"  \"Go? ay, that will I.\"  \"I only wish they'd made the offer to me,\" said Dick with a sigh.  \"An' so they do make the offer, lad.  They've gin me leave to choose the two men I'm to take with me, and I've comed straight to ask _you_.  Ay or no, for we must up an' away by break o' day to-morrow.\"  Mrs Varley started.  \"So soon?\" she said, with a look of anxiety.  \"Ay; the Pawnees are at the Yellow Creek jist at this time, but I've heer'd they're 'bout to break up camp an' away west; so we'll need to use haste.\"  \"May I go, mother?\" asked Dick, with a look of anxiety.  There was evidently a conflict in the widow's breast, but it quickly ceased.  \"Yes, my boy,\" she said in her own low, quiet voice, \"an' God go with ye.  I knew the time must come soon, an' I thank Him that your first visit to the Red-skins will be on an errand o' peace.  `Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.'\"  Dick grasped his mother's hand and pressed it to his cheek in silence. At the same moment Crusoe, seeing that the deeper feelings of his master were touched, and deeming it his duty to sympathise, rose up and thrust his nose against him.  \"Ah! pup,\" cried the young man hastily, \"you must go too.  Of course Crusoe goes, Joe Blunt?\"  \"Hum!  I don't know that.  There's no dependin' on a dog to keep his tongue quiet in times o' danger.\"  \"Believe me,\" exclaimed Dick, flashing with enthusiasm, \"Crusoe's more trustworthy than I am myself.  If ye can trust the master yer safe to trust the pup.\"  \"Well, lad, ye may be right.  We'll take him.\"  \"Thanks, Joe.  And who else goes with us?\"  \"I've bin castin' that in my mind for some time, an' I've fixed to take Henri.  He's not the safest man in the valley, but he's the truest, that's a fact.  And now, younker, get yer horse an' rifle ready, and come to the block-house at daybreak to-morrow.  Good luck to ye, mistress, till we meet agin.\"  Joe Blunt rose, and taking up his rifle,--without which he scarcely ever moved a foot from his own door,--left the cottage with rapid strides.  \"My son,\" said Mrs Varley, kissing Dick's cheek as he resumed his seat, \"put this in the little pocket I made for it in your hunting shirt.\"  She handed him a small pocket Bible.  \"Dear mother,\" he said, as he placed the book carefully within the breast of his coat, \"the Red-skin that takes that from me must take my scalp first.  But don't fear for me.  You've often said the Lord would protect me.  So He will, mother, for sure it's an errand o' peace!\"  \"Ay, that's it, that's it,\" murmured the widow in a half-soliloquy.  Dick Varley spent that night in converse with his mother, and next morning at daybreak he was at the place of meeting mounted on his sturdy little horse, with the \"silver rifle\" on his shoulder, and Crusoe by his side.  \"That's right, lad, that's right.  Nothin' like keepin' yer time,\" said Joe, as he led out a pack-horse from the gate of the block-house, while his own charger was held ready saddled by a man named Daniel Brand, who had been appointed to the charge of the block-house in his absence.  \"Where's Henri?--oh! here he comes,\" exclaimed Dick, as the hunter referred to came thundering up the slope at a charge, on a horse that resembled its rider in size, and not a little in clumsiness of appearance.  \"Ah! mes boy.  Him is a goot one to go,\" cried Henri, remarking Dick's smile as he pulled up.  \"No hoss on de plain can beat dis one, surement.\"  \"Now then, Henri, lend a hand to fix this pack, we've no time to palaver.\"  By this time they were joined by several of the soldiers and a few hunters who had come to see them start.  \"Remember, Joe,\" cried one, \"if you don't come back in three months we'll all come out in a band to seek you.\"  \"If we don't come back in less than that time, what's left o' us won't be worth seekin' for,\" said Joe, tightening the girth of his saddle.  \"Put a bit in yer own mouth, Henri,\" cried another, as the Canadian arranged his steed's bridle; \"ye'll need it more than yer horse when ye git 'mong the red reptiles.\"  \"Vraiment, if mon mout' needs one bit yours will need one padlock.\"  \"Now, lads, mount!\" cried Joe Blunt as he vaulted into the saddle.  Dick Varley sprang lightly on his horse, and Henri made a rush at his steed and hurled his huge frame across its back with a violence that _ought_ to have brought it to the ground; but the tall, raw-boned, broad-chested roan was accustomed to the eccentricities of its master, and stood the shock bravely.  Being appointed to lead the pack-horse, Henri seized its halter; then the three cavaliers shook their reins, and, waving their hands to their comrades, they sprang into the woods at full gallop, and laid their course for the \"far west.\"  For some time they galloped side by side in silence, each occupied with his own thoughts, Crusoe keeping close beside his master's horse.  The two elder hunters evidently ruminated on the object of their mission and the prospects of success, for their countenances were grave and their eyes cast on the ground.  Dick Varley, too, thought upon the Red-men, but his musings were deeply tinged with the bright hues of a _first_ adventure.  The mountains, the plains, the Indians, the bears, the buffaloes, and a thousand other objects, danced wildly before his mind's eye, and his blood careered through his veins and flushed his forehead as he thought of what he should see and do, and felt the elastic vigour of youth respond in sympathy to the light spring of his active little steed.  He was a lover of nature, too, and his flashing eyes glanced observantly from side to side as they swept along,--sometimes through glades of forest trees; sometimes through belts of more open ground and shrubbery; anon by the margin of a stream, or along the shores of a little lake, and often over short stretches of flowering prairie-land,-- while the firm, elastic turf sent up a muffled sound from the tramp of their mettlesome chargers.  It was a scene of wild, luxuriant beauty, that might almost (one could fancy) have drawn involuntary homage to its bountiful Creator from the lips even of an infidel.  After a time Joe Blunt reined up, and they proceeded at an easy ambling pace.  Joe and his friend Henri were so used to these beautiful scenes that they had long ceased to be _enthusiastically_ affected by them, though they never ceased to delight in them.  \"I hope,\" said Joe, \"that them sodgers 'll go their ways soon.  I've no notion o' them chaps when they're left at a place wi' nothin' to do but whittle sticks.\"  \"Why, Joe!\" exclaimed Dick Varley in a tone of surprise, \"I thought you were admirin' the beautiful face o' nature all this time, and yer only thinkin' about the sodgers.  Now, that's strange!\"  \"Not so strange after all, lad,\" answered Joe.  \"When a man's used to a thing he gits to admire an' enjoy it without speakin' much about it. But it _is_ true, boy, that mankind gits in coorse o' time to think little o' the blissins he's used to.\"  \"Oui, c'est _vrai_!\" murmured Henri emphatically.  \"Well, Joe Blunt, it may be so; but I'm thankful _I'm_ not used to this sort o' thing yet,\" exclaimed Varley.  \"Let's have another gallop--so ho! come along, Crusoe!\" shouted the youth, as he shook his reins, and flew over a long stretch of prairie on which at that moment they entered.  Joe smiled as he followed his enthusiastic companion, but after a short run he "]]]
