As things stood, he was unquestionably a pleasant one, and Captain Romer found it hard to believe that he was an underhand schemer.  Nothing could exceed the open way in which Senhor Letotti condemned the slave-trade, praised the English for their zeal in attempting to suppress it, explained that the King of Portugal and the Sultan of Zanzibar were equally anxious for its total extinction, and assured his guests that he would do everything that lay in his power to further their efforts to capture the guilty kidnappers, and to free the poor slaves!  \"But, my dear sir,\" said he, at the conclusion of an emphatic declaration of sympathy, \"the thing is exceedingly difficult.  You are aware that Arab traders swarm upon the coast, that they are reckless men, who possess boats and money in abundance, that the trade is very profitable, and that, being to some extent real traders in ivory, palm-oil, indigo, and other kinds of native produce, these men have many _ruses_ and methods--what you English call dodges--whereby they can deceive even the most sharp-sighted and energetic.  The Arabs are smart smugglers of negroes--very much as your people who live in the Scottish land are smart smugglers of the dew of the mountain--what your great poet Burns speaks much of--I forget its name--it is not easy to put them down.\"  After dinner, Senhor Letotti led the officers into his garden, and showed them his fruit-trees and offices, also his domestic slaves, who looked healthy, well cared for, and really in some degree happy.  He did not, however, tell his guests that being naturally a humane man, his slaves were better treated than any other slaves in the town.  He did not remind them that, being slaves, they were his property, his goods and chattels, and that he possessed the right and the power to flay them alive if so disposed.  He did not explain that many in the town _were_ so disposed; that cruelty grows and feeds upon itself; that there were ladies and gentlemen there who flogged their slaves--men, women, and children--nearly to the death; that one gentleman of an irascible disposition, when irritated by some slight oversight on the part of the unfortunate boy who acted as his valet, could find no relief to his feelings until he had welted him first into a condition of unutterable terror, and then into a state of insensibility.  Neither did he inform them that a certain lady in the town, who seemed at most times to be possessed of a reasonably quiet spirit, was roused once to such a degree by a female slave that she caused her to be forcibly held, thrust a boiling hot egg into her mouth, skewered her lips together with a sail-needle, and then striking her cheeks, burst the egg, and let the scalding contents run down her throat.  [See Consul McLeod's _Travels_, volume two page 32.]  No, nothing of all this did the amiable Governor Letotti so much as hint at.  He would not for the world have shocked the sensibilities of his guests by the recital of such cruelties.  To say truth, the worthy man himself did not like to speak or think of them.  In this respect he resembled a certain class among ourselves, who, rather than submit to a little probing of their feelings for a few minutes, would prefer to miss the chance of making an intelligently indignant protest against slavery, and would allow the bodies and souls of their fellow-men to continue writhing in agony through all time.  It was much more gratifying to the feelings of Senhor Letotti to convey his guests to the drawing-room, and there gratify their palates with excellent coffee, while the graceful, and now clothed, Azinte brought a Spanish guitar to the Senhorina Maraquita, whose sweet voice soon charmed away all thoughts of the cruel side of slavery.  But duty ere long stepped in to call the guests to other scenes.  \"What a sweet girl the Senhorina is!\" remarked Captain Romer, while on his way to the beach.  \"Ay, and what a pretty girl Azinte is, black though she be,\" observed Lieutenant Small.  \"Call her not black; she is brown--a brunette,\" said the captain.  \"I wonder how _we_ should feel,\" said Lindsay, \"if the tables were turned, and _our_ women and children, with our stoutest young men, were forcibly taken from us by thousands every year, and imported into Africa to grind the corn and hoe the fields of the black man.  Poor Azinte!\"  \"Do you know anything of her history?\" inquired Mr Small.  \"A little.  I had some conversation in French with the Senhorina just before we left--\"  \"Yes, I observed that,\" interrupted the captain, with a quiet smile.  \"And,\" continued Lindsay, \"she told me that she had discovered, through an interpreter, that the poor girl is married, and that her home is far away in the interior.  She was caught, with many others, while out working in the fields one day several months ago, by a party of slave-traders, under an Arab named Yoosoof and carried off.  Her husband was absent at the time; her infant boy was with its grandmother in their village, and she thinks may have escaped into the woods, but she has not seen any of them again since the day of her capture.\"  \"It is a sad case,\" said the captain, \"and yet bad though it be, it might be far worse, for Azinte's master and mistress are very kind, which is more than can be said of most slave-owners in this region.\"  In a few minutes the captain's gig was alongside the \"Firefly,\" and soon afterwards that vessel quietly put to sea.  Of course it was impossible that she should depart unobserved, but her commander took the precaution to run due south at first, exactly opposite to the direction of his true course, intending to make a wide sweep out to sea, and thus get unobserved to the northward of the place where the slaver's dhow was supposed to be lying, in time to intercept it.  Yoosoof, from a neighbouring height watched the manoeuvre, and thoroughly understood it.  When the vessel had disappeared into the shades of night that brooded over the sea, he smiled calmly, and in a placid frame of mind betook himself to his lair in the creek beside the mangrove trees.  He found Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer in the hut, somewhat impatient of his prolonged absence, and a dozen of his men looking rather suspiciously at the strangers.  \"Is all ready, Moosa?\" he inquired of a powerful man, half-Portuguese, half-negro in appearance, who met him outside the door of the hut.  \"All ready,\" replied the half-caste, in a gruff tone of voice, \"but what are you going to do with these English brutes?\"  \"Take them with us, of course,\" replied Yoosoof.  \"For what end?\"  \"For our own safety.  Why, don't you see, Moosa, that if we had set them free, they might have discovered the town and given information to the cruiser about us, which would have been awkward?  We might now, indeed, set them free, for the cruiser is gone, but I still have good reason for wishing to take them with me.  They think that we have but _one_ boat in this creek, and I should like to make use of them for the purpose of propagating that false idea.  I have had the good luck while in the town to find an opportunity of giving one of the sailors of the cruiser a little information as to my movements--some of it true, some of it false--which will perhaps do us a service.\"  The Arab smiled slightly as he said this.  \"Do these men know our trade?\" asked Moosa.  \"I think they suspect it,\" answered Yoosoof.  \"And what if they be not willing to go with us?\" demanded Moosa.  \"Can twelve men not manage two?\" asked the Arab.  Dark though the night had become by that time, there was sufficient light to gleam on the teeth that Moosa exposed on receiving this reply.  \"Now, Moosa, we must be prompt,\" continued Yoosoof; \"let some of you get round behind the Englishmen, and have the slave-chains handy.  Keep your eye on me while I talk with them; if they are refractory, a nod shall be the signal.\"  Entering the hut Yoosoof informed Harold that it was now time to set sail.  \"Good, we are ready,\" said Harold, rising, \"but tell me one thing before my comrade and I agree to go with you,--tell us honestly if you are engaged in the slave-trade.\"  A slight smile curled the Arab's thin lip as he replied--\"If I be a slave-trader, I cannot speak honestly, so you Engleesh think.  But I do tell you--yes, I am.\"  \"Then, I tell _you_ honestly,\" said Harold, \"that I won't go with you. I'll have nothing to do with slavers.\"  \"Them's my sentiments to a tee,\" said Disco, with emphasis, thumping his left palm as usual with his right fist, by way of sheating his remark home--to use his own words.  \"But you will both perish on this uninhabited coast,\" said Yoosoof.  \"So be it,\" replied Harold; \"I had rather run the risk of starving than travel in company with slave-traders.  Besides, I doubt the truth of what you say.  There must be several villages not very far off, if my information in regard to the coast be not altogether wrong.\"  Yoosoof waited for no more.  He nodded to Moosa, who instantly threw a noose round Harold's arms, and drew it tight.  The same operation was performed for Disco, by a stout fellow who stood behind him, and almost before they realised what had occurred, they were seized by a number of men.  It must not be supposed that two able-bodied Englishmen quietly submitted at once to this sort of treatment.  On the contrary, a struggle ensued that shook the walls of the little hut so violently as almost to bring it down upon the heads of the combatants.  The instant that Harold felt the rough clasp of Moosa's arms, he bent himself forward with such force as to fling that worthy completely over his head, and lay him flat on the floor, but two of the other slavers seized Harold's arms, a third grasped him round the waist, and a fourth rapidly secured the ropes that had been thrown around him.  Disco's mode of action, although somewhat different was quite as vigorous.  On being grasped he uttered a deep roar of surprise and rage, and, raising his foot, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21748"],["title","Black Ivory (#7)"],["body","out therewith at a man who advanced to seize him in front. The kick not only tumbled the man over a low bench and drove his head against the wall, but it caused the kicker himself to recoil on his foes behind with such force that they all fell on the floor together, when by their united weight the slavers managed to crush the unfortunate Disco, not, indeed, into submission, but into inaction.  His tongue, however, not being tied, continued to pour forth somewhat powerful epithets, until Harold very strongly advised him to cease.  \"If you want to retain a whole skin,\" he said, \"you had better keep a quiet tongue.\"  \"P'raps you're right sir,\" said Disco, after a moment's consideration, \"but it ain't easy to shut up in the succumstances.\"  After they had thoroughly secured the Englishmen, the traders led them down the bank of the creek to the spot where the dhow was moored.  In the dark it appeared to Harold and his companion to be the same dhow, but this was not so.  The boat by which they had crossed the creek had been removed up the water, and its place was now occupied by the dhow into which had been put the maimed and worn-out slaves of the band whose arrival we have described.  The hold of the little vessel was very dark, nevertheless there was light enough to enable the Englishmen to guess that the rows of black objects just perceptible within it were slaves. If they had entertained any uncertainty on this point, the odour that saluted them as they passed to the stern would have quickly dispelled their doubts.  It was evident from the manner of the slavers that they did not now fear discovery, because they talked loudly as they pushed off and rowed away. Soon they were out of the creek, and the roar of breakers was heard. Much caution was displayed in guiding the dhow through these, for the channel was narrow, and darkness rendered its position almost indiscernible.  At last the sail was hoisted, the boat bent over to a smart breeze, and held away in a north-easterly direction.  As the night wore on this breeze became lighter, and, most of the crew being asleep, deep silence prevailed on board the slave-dhow, save that, ever and anon, a pitiful wail, as of a sick child, or a convulsive sob, issued from the hold.  Harold and Disco sat beside each other in the stern, with an armed half-caste on each side, and Yoosoof in front.  Their thoughts were busy enough at first, but neither spoke to the other.  As the night advanced both fell into an uneasy slumber.  When Harold awoke, the grey dawn was beginning to break in the east and there was sufficient light to render objects dimly visible.  At first he scarcely recollected where he was, but the pain caused by the ropes that bound him soon refreshed his memory.  Casting his eyes quickly towards the hold, his heart sank within him at the sight he there beheld. Yoosoof's Black Ivory was not of the best quality, but there was a good deal of it, which rendered judicious packing necessary.  So many of his gang had become worthless as an article of trade, through suffering on the way down to the coast, that the boat could scarce contain them all. They were packed sitting on their haunches in rows each with his knees close to his chin, and all jammed so tightly together that none could rise up or lie down.  Men, women, and little children sat in this position with an expression of indescribable hopelessness and apathy on their faces.  The infants, of which there were several, lay motionless on their mothers' shrunken breasts.  God help them! they were indeed utterly worthless as pieces of merchandise.  The long journey and hard treatment had worn all of them to mere skin and bone, and many were suffering from bad sores caused by the slave-irons and the unmerciful application of the lash.  No one knew better than Yoosoof that this was his \"damaged stock\"--hopelessly damaged, and he meant to make the best use he could of it.  The sun arose in all its splendour, and revealed more clearly to the horrified Englishmen all the wretchedness of the hold, but for a considerable time they did not speak.  The circumstances in which they found themselves seemed to have bereft them of the faculty of speech. The morning advanced, and Yoosoof with his men, took a frugal breakfast, but they did not offer any to Harold or Disco.  As these unfortunates had, however, supped heartily, they did not mind that.  So much could not have been said for the slaves.  They had received their last meal of uncooked rice and water, a very insufficient one, about thirty-six hours before, and as they watched the traders at breakfast, their glaring eyes told eloquently of their sufferings.  Had these been Yoosoof's valuable stock, his undamaged goods, he would have given them a sufficiency of food to have kept them up to condition as long as he possessed them; but being what they were, a very little drop of water and a few grains of raw rice at noon was deemed sufficient to prevent absolute starvation.  \"How can you have the heart,\" said Harold at last turning to Yoosoof, \"to treat these poor creatures so cruelly?\"  Yoosoof shrugged his shoulders.  \"My fader treat them so; I follow my fader's footsteps.\"  \"But have you no pity for them?  Don't you think they have hearts and feelings like ourselves?\" returned Harold earnestly.  \"No,\" replied the Arab coldly.  \"They have no feelings.  Hard as the stone.  They care not for mother, or child, or husband.  Only brutes-- cattle.\"  Harold was so disgusted with this reply that he relapsed into silence.  Towards the afternoon, while the dhow was running close in-shore, a vessel hove in sight on the horizon.  A few minutes sufficed to show that it was a steamer.  It was of course observed and closely watched by the slave-dealers as well as by Harold Seadrift and Disco Lillihammer, who became sanguinely hopeful that it might turn out to be a British man-of-war.  Had they known that Yoosoof was equally anxious and hopeful on that point they would have been much surprised; but the wily Arab pretended to be greatly alarmed, and when the Union Jack became clearly visible his excitement increased.  He gave some hurried orders to his men, who laughed sarcastically as they obeyed them.  \"Yoosoof,\" said Harold, with a slight feeling of exultation, \"your plans seem about to miscarry!\"  \"No, they not miscarry yet,\" replied the Arab, with a grim smile.  \"Tell me, Yoosoof,\" resumed Harold, prompted by strong curiosity, \"why have you carried us off bound in this fashion?\"  Another smile, more grim than the former, crossed the Arab's visage as he replied--\"Me carry you off 'cause that sheep,\" pointing to the steamer, \"lie not two mile off, near to town of Governor Letotti, when I first met you.  We not want you to let thems know 'bout us, so I carry you off, and I bind you 'cause you strong.\"  \"Ha! that's plain and reasonable,\" returned Harold, scarce able to restrain a laugh at the man's cool impudence.  \"But it would appear that some one else has carried the news; so, you see, you have been outwitted after all.\"  \"Perhaps.  We shall see,\" replied the Arab, with something approaching to a chuckle.  Altering the course of the boat, Yoosoof now ran her somewhat off the shore, as if with a view to get round a headland that lay to the northward.  This evidently drew the attention of the steamer--which was none other than the \"Firefly\"--for she at once altered her course and ran in-shore, so as to intercept the dhow.  Seeing this, Yoosoof turned back and made for the land at a place where there was a long line of breakers close to the shore.  To run amongst these seemed to be equivalent to running on certain destruction, nevertheless the Arab held on, with compressed lips and a frowning brow.  Yoosoof looked quite like a man who would rather throw away his life than gratify his enemy, and the Englishmen, who were fully alive to their danger, began to feel rather uneasy--which was a very pardonable sensation, when it is remembered that their arms being fast bound, rendered them utterly unable to help themselves in case of the boat capsizing.  The \"Firefly\" was by this time near enough to hold converse with the dhow through the medium of artillery.  Soon a puff of white smoke burst from her bow, and a round-shot dropped a few yards astern of the boat.  \"That's a broad hint, my lad, so you'd better give in,\" said Lillihammer, scarce able to suppress a look of triumph.  Yoosoof paid not the slightest attention to the remark, but held on his course.  \"Surely you don't intend to risk the lives of these poor creatures in such a surf?\" said Harold anxiously; \"weak and worn as they are, their doom is sealed if we capsize.\"  Still the Arab paid no attention, but continued to gaze steadily at the breakers.  Harold, turning his eyes in the same direction, observed something like a narrow channel running through them.  He was enough of a seaman to understand that only one who was skilled in such navigation could pass in safety.  \"They're lowering a boat,\" said Disco, whose attention was engrossed by the manoeuvres of the \"Firefly.\"  Soon the boat left the side of the vessel, which was compelled to check her speed for fear of running on the reef.  Another gun was fired as she came round, and the shot dropped right in front of the dhow, sending a column of water high into the air.  Still Yoosoof held on until close to the breakers, when, to the surprise of the Englishmen, he suddenly threw the boat's head into the wind.  \"You can steer,\" he said sternly to Disco.  \"Come, take the helm an' go to your ship; or, if you choose, go on the breakers.\"  He laughed fiercely as he said this, and next moment plunged into the sea, followed by his crew.  Disco, speechless with amazement, rose up and sprang to the helm.  Of course he could not use his bound hands, but one of his legs answered almost as well.  He allowed the boat to come round until the sail filled on the other tack, and then looking back,"]]]
