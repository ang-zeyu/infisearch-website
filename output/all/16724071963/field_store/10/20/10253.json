I've sailed round it twice already, and both times the ship was a'most blow'd out o' the water.\"  \"I've been round it once,\" said another; \"an' that time the sails were split, and the ropes frozen in the blocks so that they wouldn't work, and we wos all but lost.\"  \"An' I've been round it five times,\" cried a third; \"an' every time wos wuss than another, the gales wos so tree-mendous!\"  \"And I've been round it, no times at all,\" cried Peterkin with an impudent wink in his eye, \"an' that time I wos blow'd inside out!\"  Nevertheless we passed the dreaded cape without much rough weather, and in the course of a few weeks afterwards were sailing gently, before a warm tropical breeze, over the Pacific Ocean.  Thus we proceeded on our voyage--sometimes bounding merrily before a fair breeze; at other times floating calmly on the glassy wave and fishing for the curious inhabitants of the deep, all of which, although the sailors thought little of them, were strange, and interesting, and very wonderful to me.  At last we came among the Coral Islands of the Pacific; and I shall never forget the delight with which I gazed--when we chanced to pass one--at the pure white, dazzling shores, and the verdant palm-trees, which looked bright and beautiful in the sunshine.  And often did we three long to be landed on one, imagining that we should certainly find perfect happiness there!  Our wish was granted sooner than we expected.  One night, soon after we entered the tropics, an awful storm burst upon our ship.  The first squall of wind carried away two of our masts, and left only the foremast standing.  Even this, however, was more than enough, for we did not dare to hoist a rag of sail on it.  For five days the tempest raged in all its fury.  Everything was swept off the decks, except one small boat.  The steersman was lashed to the wheel lest he should be washed away, and we all gave ourselves up for lost.  The captain said that he had no idea where we were, as we had been blown far out of our course; and we feared much that we might get among the dangerous coral reefs which are so numerous in the Pacific.  At daybreak on the sixth morning of the gale we saw land ahead; it was an island encircled by a reef of coral, on which the waves broke in fury.  There was calm water within this reef, but we could see only one narrow opening into it.  For this opening we steered; but ere we reached it a tremendous wave broke on our stern, tore the rudder completely off, and left us at the mercy of the winds and waves.  \"It's all over with us now, lads!\" said the captain to the men.  \"Get the boat ready to launch; we shall be on the rocks in less than half-an-hour.\"  The men obeyed in gloomy silence, for they felt that there was little hope of so small a boat living in such a sea.  \"Come, boys,\" said Jack Martin, in a grave tone, to me and Peterkin, as we stood on the quarter-deck awaiting our fate--\"come, boys; we three shall stick together.  You see it is impossible that the little boat can reach the shore, crowded with men.  It will be sure to upset, so I mean rather to trust myself to a large oar.  I see through the telescope that the ship will strike at the tail of the reef, where the waves break into the quiet water inside; so if we manage to cling to the oar till it is driven over the breakers, we may perhaps gain the shore.  What say you? Will you join me?\"  We gladly agreed to follow Jack, for he inspired us with confidence-- although I could perceive, by the sad tone of his voice, that he had little hope; and indeed, when I looked at the white waves that lashed the reef and boiled against the rocks as if in fury, I felt that there was but a step between us and death.  My heart sank within me; but at that moment my thoughts turned to my beloved mother, and I remembered those words, which were among the last that she said to me: \"Ralph, my dearest child, always remember, in the hour of danger, to look to your Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  He alone is both able and willing to save your body and your soul.\"  So I felt much comforted when I thought thereon.  The ship was now very near the rocks.  The men were ready with the boat, and the captain beside them giving orders, when a tremendous wave came towards us.  We three ran towards the bow to lay hold of our oar, and had barely reached it when the wave fell on the deck with a crash like thunder.  At the same moment the ship struck; the foremast broke off close to the deck and went over the side, carrying the boat and men along with it.  Our oar got entangled with the wreck, and Jack seized an axe to cut it free; but owing to the motion of the ship, he missed the cordage and struck the axe deep into the oar.  Another wave, however, washed it clear of the wreck.  We all seized hold of it, and the next instant we were struggling in the wild sea.  The last thing I saw was the boat whirling in the surf, and all the sailors tossed into the foaming waves.  Then I became insensible.  On recovering from my swoon I found myself lying on a bank of soft grass, under shelter of an overhanging rock, with Peterkin on his knees by my side, tenderly bathing my temples with water, and endeavouring to stop the blood that flowed from a wound in my forehead.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE CORAL ISLAND--OUR FIRST COGITATIONS AFTER LANDING AND THE RESULT OF THEM--WE CONCLUDE THAT THE ISLAND IS UNINHABITED.  There is a strange and peculiar sensation experienced in recovering from a state of insensibility which is almost indescribable: a sort of dreamy, confused consciousness; a half-waking, half-sleeping condition, accompanied with a feeling of weariness, which, however, is by no means disagreeable.  As I slowly recovered, and heard the voice of Peterkin inquiring whether I felt better, I thought that I must have overslept myself, and should be sent to the masthead for being lazy; but before I could leap up in haste, the thought seemed to vanish suddenly away, and I fancied that I must have been ill.  Then a balmy breeze fanned my cheek; and I thought of home, and the garden at the back of my father's cottage with its luxuriant flowers, and the sweet-scented honeysuckle that my dear mother trained so carefully upon the trellised porch.  But the roaring of the surf put these delightful thoughts to flight, and I was back again at sea, watching the dolphins and the flying-fish, and reefing topsails off the wild and stormy Cape Horn.  Gradually the roar of the surf became louder and more distinct.  I thought of being wrecked far, far away from my native land, and slowly opened my eyes to meet those of my companion Jack, who, with a look of intense anxiety, was gazing into my face.  \"Speak to us, my dear Ralph!\" whispered Jack tenderly.  \"Are you better now?\"  I smiled and looked up, saying, \"Better!  Why, what do you mean, Jack? I'm quite well.\"  \"Then what are you shamming for, and frightening us in this way?\" said Peterkin, smiling through his tears; for the poor boy had been really under the impression that I was dying.  I now raised myself on my elbow, and putting my hand to my forehead, found that it had been cut pretty severely, and that I had lost a good deal of blood.  \"Come, come, Ralph,\" said Jack, pressing me gently backward, \"lie down, my boy; you're not right yet.  Wet your lips with this water; it's cool and clear as crystal.  I got it from a spring close at hand.  There, now, don't say a word--hold your tongue,\" he said, seeing me about to speak.  \"I'll tell you all about it, but you must not utter a syllable till you have rested well.\"  \"Oh, don't stop him from speaking, Jack!\" said Peterkin, who, now that his fears for my safety were removed, busied himself in erecting a shelter of broken branches in order to protect me from the wind--which, however, was almost unnecessary, for the rock beside which I had been laid completely broke the force of the gale.  \"Let him speak, Jack; it's a comfort to hear that he's alive after lying there stiff and white and sulky for a whole hour, just like an Egyptian mummy.--Never saw such a fellow as you are, Ralph--always up to mischief.  You've almost knocked out all my teeth and more than half-choked me, and now you go shamming dead!  It's very wicked of you, indeed it is.\"  While Peterkin ran on in this style my faculties became quite clear again, and I began to understand my position.  \"What do you mean by saying I half-choked you, Peterkin?\" said I.  \"What do I mean?  Is English not your mother-tongue? or do you want me to repeat it in French by way of making it clearer?  Don't you remember?\"  \"I remember nothing,\" said I, interrupting him, \"after we were thrown into the sea.\"  \"Hush, Peterkin!\" said Jack; \"you're exciting Ralph with your nonsense.--I'll explain it to you.  You recollect that, after the ship struck, we three sprang over the bow into the sea?  Well, I noticed that the oar struck your head and gave you that cut on the brow which nearly stunned you, so that you grasped Peterkin round the neck without knowing apparently what you were about.  In doing so, you pushed the telescope-- which you clung to as if it had been your life--against Peterkin's mouth--\"  \"Pushed it against his mouth!\" interrupted Peterkin; \"say crammed it down his throat!  Why, there's a distinct mark of the brass rim on the back of my gullet at this moment!\"  \"Well, well, be that as it may,\" continued Jack, \"you clung to him, Ralph, till I feared you really would choke him.  But I saw that he had a good hold of the oar; so I exerted myself to the utmost to push you towards the shore, which we luckily reached without much trouble, for the water inside the reef is quite calm.\"  \"But the captain and crew, what of them?\"  I inquired anxiously.  Jack shook his head.  \"Are they lost?\"  \"No, they are not lost, I hope; but, I fear, there is not much chance of their being saved.  The ship struck at the very tail of the island on which"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21721"],["title","The Coral Island (#2)"],["body","are cast.  When the boat was tossed into the sea it fortunately did not upset, although it shipped a good deal of water, and all the men managed to scramble into it; but before they could get the oars out, the gale carried them past the point and away to leeward of the island. After we landed I saw them endeavouring to pull towards us; but as they had only one pair of oars out of the eight that belonged to the boat, and as the wind was blowing right in their teeth, they gradually lost ground.  Then I saw them put about and hoist some sort of sail--a blanket, I fancy, for it was too small for the boat--and in half-an-hour they were out of sight.\"  \"Poor fellows!\"  I murmured sorrowfully.  \"But the more I think about it I've better hope of them,\" continued Jack in a more cheerful tone.  \"You see, Ralph, I've read a great deal about these South Sea Islands, and I know that in many places they are scattered about in thousands over the sea, so they're almost sure to fall in with one of them before long.\"  \"I'm sure I hope so,\" said Peterkin earnestly.  \"But what has become of the wreck, Jack?  I saw you clambering up the rocks there while I was watching Ralph.  Did you say she had gone to pieces?\"  \"No, she has not gone to pieces; but she has gone to the bottom,\" replied Jack.  \"As I said before, she struck on the tail of the island and stove in her bow; but the next breaker swung her clear, and she floated away to leeward.  The poor fellows in the boat made a hard struggle to reach her, but long before they came near her she filled and went down.  It was after she had foundered that I saw them trying to pull to the island.\"  There was a long silence after Jack had ceased speaking, and I have no doubt that each was revolving in his mind our extraordinary position. For my part, I cannot say that my reflections were very agreeable.  I knew that we were on an island, for Jack had said so; but whether it was inhabited or not, I did not know.  If it should be inhabited, I felt certain, from all I had heard of South Sea Islanders, that we should be roasted alive and eaten.  If it should turn out to be uninhabited, I fancied that we should be starved to death.  \"Oh,\" thought I, \"if the ship had only struck on the rocks we might have done pretty well, for we could have obtained provisions from her, and tools to enable us to build a shelter; but now--alas! alas! we are lost!\"  These last words I uttered aloud in my distress.  \"Lost, Ralph!\" exclaimed Jack, while a smile overspread his hearty countenance.  \"Saved, you should have said.  Your cogitations seem to have taken a wrong road, and led you to a wrong conclusion.\"  \"Do you know what conclusion I have come to?\" said Peterkin.  \"I have made up my mind that it's capital--first-rate--the best thing that ever happened to us, and the most splendid prospect that ever lay before three jolly young tars.  We've got an island all to ourselves.  We'll take possession in the name of the king.  We'll go and enter the service of its black inhabitants.  Of course we'll rise, naturally, to the top of affairs: white men always do in savage countries.  You shall be king, Jack; Ralph, prime minister; and I shall be--\"  \"The court-jester,\" interrupted Jack.  \"No,\" retorted Peterkin; \"I'll have no title at all.  I shall merely accept a highly responsible situation under government; for you see, Jack, I'm fond of having an enormous salary and nothing to do.\"  \"But suppose there are no natives?\"  \"Then we'll build a charming villa, and plant a lovely garden round it, stuck all full of the most splendiferous tropical flowers; and we'll farm the land, plant, sow, reap, eat, sleep, and be merry.\"  \"But to be serious,\" said Jack, assuming a grave expression of countenance--which, I observed, always had the effect of checking Peterkin's disposition to make fun of everything--\"we are really in rather an uncomfortable position.  If this is a desert island, we shall have to live very much like the wild beasts; for we have not a tool of any kind--not even a knife.\"  \"Yes, we have _that_,\" said Peterkin, fumbling in his trousers pocket, from which he drew forth a small penknife with only one blade, and that was broken.  \"Well, that's better than nothing.--But come,\" said Jack, rising; \"we are wasting our time in _talking_ instead of _doing_.--You seem well enough to walk now, Ralph.--Let us see what we have got in our pockets; and then let us climb some hill and ascertain what sort of island we have been cast upon, for, whether good or bad, it seems likely to be our home for some time to come.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  WE EXAMINE INTO OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, AND MAKE A HAPPY DISCOVERY--OUR ISLAND DESCRIBED--JACK PROVES HIMSELF TO BE LEARNED AND SAGACIOUS ABOVE HIS FELLOWS--CURIOUS DISCOVERIES--NATURAL LEMONADE!  We now seated ourselves upon a rock, and began to examine into our personal property.  When we reached the shore after being wrecked, my companions had taken off part of their clothes and spread them out in the sun to dry; for although the gale was raging fiercely, there was not a single cloud in the bright sky.  They had also stripped off most part of my wet clothes and spread them also on the rocks.  Having resumed our garments, we now searched all our pockets with the utmost care, and laid their contents out on a flat stone before us; and now that our minds were fully alive to our condition, it was with no little anxiety that we turned our several pockets inside out in order that nothing might escape us.  When all was collected together, we found that our worldly goods consisted of the following articles:  First, a small penknife with a single blade, broken off about the middle and very rusty, besides having two or three notches on its edge. (Peterkin said of this, with his usual pleasantry, that it would do for a saw as well as a knife, which was a great advantage.)  Second, an old German-silver pencil-case without any lead in it.  Third, a piece of whip-cord about six yards long.  Fourth, a sailmaker's needle of a small size.  Fifth, a ship's telescope, which I happened to have in my hand at the time the ship struck, and which I had clung to firmly all the time I was in the water; indeed, it was with difficulty that Jack got it out of my grasp when I was lying insensible on the shore.  I cannot understand why I kept such a firm hold of this telescope.  They say that a drowning man will clutch at a straw.  Perhaps it may have been some such feeling in me, for I did not know that it was in my hand at the time we were wrecked.  However, we felt some pleasure in having it with us now-- although we did not see that it could be of much use to us, as the glass at the small end was broken to pieces.  Our sixth article was a brass ring which Jack always wore on his little finger.  I never understood why he wore it; for Jack was not vain of his appearance, and did not seem to care for ornaments of any kind.  Peterkin said, \"it was in memory of the girl he left behind him!\"  But as he never spoke of this girl to either of us, I am inclined to think that Peterkin was either jesting or mistaken.  In addition to these articles, we had a little bit of tinder and the clothes on our backs.  These last were as follows:  Each of us had on a pair of stout canvas trousers and a pair of sailors' thick shoes.  Jack wore a red flannel shirt, a blue jacket, and a red Kilmarnock bonnet or nightcap, besides a pair of worsted socks, and a cotton pocket-handkerchief with sixteen portraits of Lord Nelson printed on it and a union-jack in the middle.  Peterkin had on a striped flannel shirt--which he wore outside his trousers and belted round his waist, after the manner of a tunic--and a round black straw hat.  He had no jacket, having thrown it off just before we were cast into the sea; but this was not of much consequence, as the climate of the island proved to be extremely mild--so much so, indeed, that Jack and I often preferred to go about without our jackets.  Peterkin had also a pair of white cotton socks and a blue handkerchief with white spots all over it.  My own costume consisted of a blue flannel shirt, a blue jacket, a black cap, and a pair of worsted socks, besides the shoes and canvas trousers already mentioned.  This was all we had, and besides these things we had nothing else; but when we thought of the danger from which we had escaped, and how much worse off we might have been had the ship struck on the reef during the night, we felt very thankful that we were possessed of so much, although, I must confess, we sometimes wished that we had had a little more.  While we were examining these things and talking about them, Jack suddenly started and exclaimed:  \"The oar!  We have forgotten the oar!\"  \"What good will that do us?\" said Peterkin.  \"There's wood enough on the island to make a thousand oars.\"  \"Ay, lad,\" replied Jack; \"but there's a bit of hoop-iron at the end of it, and that may be of much use to us.\"  \"Very true,\" said I; \"let us go fetch it.\"  And with that we all three rose and hastened down to the beach.  I still felt a little weak from loss of blood, so that my companions soon began to leave me behind; but Jack perceived this, and, with his usual considerate good-nature, turned back to help me.  This was now the first time that I had looked well about me since landing, as the spot where I had been laid was covered with thick bushes, which almost hid the country from our view.  As we now emerged from among these and walked down the sandy beach together, I cast my eyes about, and truly my heart glowed within me and my spirits rose at the beautiful prospect which I beheld on every side.  The gale had suddenly died away, just as if it had blown furiously till it dashed our ship upon the rocks, and had nothing more to do after accomplishing that.  The island on which we stood was hilly, and covered almost everywhere with the most beautiful and richly coloured trees, bushes, and shrubs, none of"]]]
