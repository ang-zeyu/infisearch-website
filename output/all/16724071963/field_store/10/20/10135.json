Don't they say that any ould fiddle is good enough to learn upon?  Mustn't I put my foot on the first round o' the ladder if I want to go up higher?  If I'm to be Postmaster-General mustn't I get a general knowledge of the post from the bottom to the top by goin' through it?  It's only men like George there that can go slap over everything at a bound.\"  \"Come, Phil, don't be impertinent,\" said George, \"it's a bad sign in one so young.  Will you convoy me a short way?  I must go now.\"  He rose as he spoke and bade Miss Lillycrop good-evening.  That lady expressed an earnest hope that he would come to see her frequently, and he promised to do so as often as he could find time.  He also bade May good-evening because she was to spend the night with her cousin, but May parted from him with the same touch of reserve that marked their meeting.  He resented this by drawing himself up and turning away somewhat coldly.  \"Now, Phil,\" he said, almost sternly, on reaching the street, \"here's a letter to Sir James Clubley which I want to read to you.--Listen.\"  By the light of a lamp he read:--    \"DEAR SIR,--I appreciate your kindness in offering me the situation   mentioned in your letter of the 4th, and especially your remarks in   reference to my late father, who was indeed worthy of esteem.  I shall   have pleasure in calling on you on hearing that you are satisfied with   the testimonials herewith enclosed.--I am, etcetera.\"  \"Now, Phil, will that do?\"  \"Do? of course it will.  Nothing could be better.  Only--\"  \"Well, what?\"  \"Don't you think that you might call without waiting to hear his opinion of your testimonials?\"  \"No, Phil, I don't,\" replied the other in a slightly petulant tone; \"I don't feel quite sure of the spirit in which he referred to my dear father.  Of course it was kind and all that, but it was slightly patronising, and my father was an infinitely superior man to himself.\"  \"Well, I don't know,\" said Phil; \"if you're going to accept a favour of him you had better try to feel and act in a friendly way, but of course it would never do to encourage him in pride.\"  \"Well then, I'll send it,\" said Aspel, closing the letter; \"do you know where I can post it?\"  \"Not I.  Never was here before.  I've only a vague idea of how I got here, and mustn't go far with you lest I lose myself.\"  At that moment Miss Lillycrop's door opened and little Tottie issued forth.  \"Ah! she will help us.--D'you know where the Post-Office is, Tottie?\"  \"Yes, sir, it's at the corner of the street, Miss Lillycrop says.\"  \"Which direction?\"  \"That one, I think.\"  \"Here, I'm going the other way: will you post this letter for me?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Tottie.  \"That's a good girl; here's a penny for you.\"  \"Please, sir, that's not a penny,\" said the child, holding out the half-crown which Aspel had put in her hand.  \"Never mind; keep it.\"  Tottie stood bereft of speech at the youth's munificence, as he turned away from her with a laugh.  Now, when Tottie Bones said that she knew where the post was, she did so because her mistress had told her, among other pieces of local information, that the pillar letter-box stood at the corner of the street and was painted red; but as no occasion had occurred since her arrival for the posting of a letter, she had not yet seen the pillar with her own eyes.  The corner of the street, however, was so plain a direction that no one except an idiot could fail to find it. Accordingly Tottie started off to execute her mission.  Unfortunately--or the reverse, as the case may be--streets have usually two corners.  The child went, almost as a matter of course, to the wrong one, and there she found no pillar.  But she was a faithful messenger, and not to be easily balked.  She sought diligently at that corner until she really did find a pillar, in a retired angle.  Living, as she did, chiefly in the back slums of London, where literary correspondence is not much in vogue, Tottie had never seen a pillar letter-box, or, if she had, had not realised its nature.  Miss Lillycrop had told her it was red, with a slit in it.  The pillar she had found was red to some extent with rust, and it unquestionably had a slit in it where, in days gone by, a handle had projected.  It also had a spout in front.  Tottie had some vague idea that this letter-box must have been made in imitation of a pump, and that the spout was a convenient step to enable small people like herself to reach the slit.  Only, she thought it queer that they should not have put the spout in front of the pillar under the slit, instead of behind it.  She was still more impressed with this when, after having twice got on the spout, she twice fell off in futile efforts to reach round the pump with her small arms.  Baffled, but not defeated, Tottie waited till some one should pass who could put the letter in for her, but in that retired angle no one passed.  Suddenly her sharp eyes espied a brickbat.  She set it up on end beside the pump, mounted it, stood on tip-toe, and, stretching her little body to the very uttermost, tipped the letter safely in.  The brickbat tipped over at the same instant and sent her headlong to the ground.  But this was no novelty to Tottie.  Regardless of the fall, she gathered herself up, and, with the light heart of one who has gained a victory in the performance of duty, ran off to her miserable home in the back slums.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  PHIL BEGINS LIFE, AND MAKES A FRIEND.  Some time after the small tea-party described in our last chapter, Philip Maylands was invested with all the dignity, privileges, and emoluments of an \"Out-door Boy Telegraph Messenger\" in the General Post-Office.  He rejoiced in the conscious independence of one who earns his own livelihood, is a burden to nobody, and has something to spare. He enjoyed the privilege of wearing a grey uniform, of sitting in a comfortable room with a huge fire in the basement of the office, and of walking over a portion of London as the bearer of urgent and no doubt all-important news.  He also enjoyed a salary of seven shillings sterling a week, and was further buoyed up with the hope of an increase to eight shillings at the end of a year.  His duties, as a rule, began at eight each morning, and averaged nine hours.  We have said that out of his vast income he had something to spare. This, of course, was not much, but owing to the very moderate charge for lodging made by Solomon Flint--with whom and his sister he took up his abode--the sum was sufficient to enable him, after a few months, to send home part of his first year's earnings to his mother.  He did this by means of that most valuable institution of modern days a Post-Office order, which enables one to send small sums of money, at a moderate charge, and with perfect security, not only all over the kingdom, but over the greater part of the known world.  It would have been interesting, had it been possible, to have entered into Phil's feelings on the occasion of his transacting this first piece of financial business.  Being a country-bred boy, he was as bashful about it as if he had been only ten years old.  He doubted, first, whether the clerk would believe him in earnest when he should demand the order.  Then, when he received the form to fill up, he had considerable hesitation lest he should fill in the blanks erroneously, and when the clerk scanned the slip and frowned, he felt convinced that he had done so.  \"You've put only Mrs Maylands,\" said the clerk.  \"_Only_ Mrs Maylands!\" thought Phil; \"does the man want me to add `widow of the Reverend James Maylands, and mother of all the little Maylands?'\" but he only said, \"Sure, sir, it's to her I want to send the money.\"  \"Put down her Christian name;\" said the clerk; \"order can't be drawn without it.\"  Phil put down the required name, handed over the money, received back the change, inserted the order into a previously prepared letter, posted the same, and walked away from that office as tall as his friend George Aspel--if not taller--in sensation.  Let us now follow our hero to the boy-messengers' room in the basement of St. Martin's-le-Grand.  Entering one morning after the delivery of a telegram which had cost him a pretty long walk, Phil proceeded to the boys' hall, and took his seat at the end of the row of boys who were awaiting their turn to be called for mercurial duty.  Observing a very small telegraph-boy in a scullery off the hall, engaged in some mysterious operations with a large saucepan, from which volumes of steam proceeded, he went towards him. By that time Phil had become pretty well acquainted with the faces of his comrades, but this boy he had not previously met with.  The lad was stooping over a sink, and carefully holding in the contents of the pan with its lid, while he strained off the boiling water.  \"Sure I've not seen _you_ before?\" remarked Phil.  The boy turned up a sharp-featured, but handsome and remarkably intelligent face, and, with a quick glance at Phil, said, \"Well, now, any man might know you for an Irishman by your impudence, even if you hadn't the brogue.\"  \"Why, what do you mean?\" asked Phil, with an amused smile.  \"Mean!\" echoed the boy, with the most refined extract of insolence on his pretty "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21694"],["title","The Prairie Chief (#0)"],["body","PRAIRIE CHIEF, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.    CHAPTER ONE.  THE ALARM.  Whitewing was a Red Indian of the North American prairies.  Though not a chief of the highest standing, he was a very great man in the estimation of his tribe, for, besides being possessed of qualities which are highly esteemed among all savages--such as courage, strength, agility, and the like--he was a deep thinker, and held speculative views in regard to the Great Manitou (God), as well as the ordinary affairs of life, which perplexed even the oldest men of his tribe, and induced the younger men to look on him as a profound mystery.  Indeed the feelings of the latter towards Whitewing amounted almost to veneration, for while, on the one hand, he was noted as one of the most fearless among the braves, and a daring assailant of that king of the northern wilderness, the grizzly bear, he was, on the other hand, modest and retiring--never boasted of his prowess, disbelieved in the principle of revenge, which to most savages is not only a pleasure but a duty, and refused to decorate his sleeves or leggings with the scalp-locks of his enemies.  Indeed he had been known to allow more than one enemy to escape from his hand in time of war when he might easily have killed him.  Altogether, Whitewing was a monstrous puzzle to his fellows, and much beloved by many of them.  The only ornament which he allowed himself was the white wing of a ptarmigan.  Hence his name.  This symbol of purity was bound to his forehead by a band of red cloth wrought with the quills of the porcupine.  It had been made for him by a dark-eyed girl whose name was an Indian word signifying \"light heart.\"  But let it not be supposed that Lightheart's head was like her heart.  On the contrary, she had a good sound brain, and, although much given to laughter, jest, and raillery among her female friends, would listen with unflagging patience, and profound solemnity, to her lover's soliloquies in reference to things past, present, and to come.  One of the peculiarities of Whitewing was that he did not treat women as mere slaves or inferior creatures.  His own mother, a wrinkled, brown old thing resembling a piece of singed shoe-leather, he loved with a tenderness not usual in North American Indians, some tribes of whom have a tendency to forsake their aged ones, and leave them to perish rather than be burdened with them.  Whitewing also thought that his betrothed was fit to hold intellectual converse with him, in which idea he was not far wrong.  At the time we introduce him to the reader he was on a visit to the Indian camp of Lightheart's tribe in Clearvale, for the purpose of claiming his bride.  His own tribe, of which the celebrated old warrior Bald Eagle was chief, dwelt in a valley at a considerable distance from the camp referred to.  There were two other visitors at the Indian camp at that time.  One was a Wesleyan missionary who had penetrated to that remote region with a longing desire to carry the glad tidings of salvation in Jesus to the red men of the prairie.  The other was a nondescript little white trapper, who may be aptly described as a mass of contradictions.  He was small in stature, but amazingly strong; ugly, one-eyed, scarred in the face, and misshapen; yet wonderfully attractive, because of a sweet smile, a hearty manner, and a kindly disposition.  With the courage of the lion, Little Tim, as he was styled, combined the agility of the monkey and the laziness of the sloth.  Strange to say, Tim and Whitewing were bosom friends, although they differed in opinion on most things.  \"The white man speaks again about Manitou to-day,\" said the Indian, referring to the missionary's intention to preach, as he and Little Tim concluded their midday meal in the wigwam that had been allotted to them.  \"It's little I cares for that,\" replied Tim curtly, as he lighted the pipe with which he always wound up every meal.  Of course both men spoke in the Indian language, but that being probably unknown to the reader, we will try to convey in English as nearly as possible the slightly poetical tone of the one and the rough Backwoods' style of the other.  \"It seems strange to me,\" returned the Indian, \"that my white brother thinks and cares so little about his Manitou.  He thinks much of his gun, and his traps, and his skins, and his powder, and his friend, but cares not for Manitou, who gave him all these--all that he possesses.\"  \"Look 'ee here, Whitewing,\" returned the trapper, in his matter-of-fact way, \"there's nothing strange about it.  I see you, and I see my gun and these other things, and can handle 'em; but I don't know nothin' about Manitou, and I don't see him, so what's the good o' thinkin' about him?\"  Instead of answering, the red man looked silently and wistfully up into the blue sky, which could be seen through the raised curtain of the wigwam.  Then, pointing to the landscape before them, he said in subdued but earnest tones, \"I see him in the clouds--in the sun, and moon, and stars; in the prairies and in the mountains; I hear him in the singing waters and in the winds that scatter the leaves, and I feel him here.\"  Whitewing laid his hand on his breast, and looked in his friend's face.  \"But,\" he continued sadly, \"I do not understand him, he whispers so softly that, though I hear, I cannot comprehend.  I wonder why this is so.\"  \"Ay, that's just it, Whitewing,\" said the trapper.  \"We can't make it out nohow, an' so I just leaves all that sort o' thing to the parsons, and give my mind to the things that I understand.\"  \"When Little Tim was a very small boy,\" said the Indian, after a few minutes' meditation, \"did he understand how to trap the beaver and the martin, and how to point the rifle so as to carry death to the grizzly bear?\"  \"Of course not,\" returned the trapper; \"seems to me that that's a foolish question.\"  \"But,\" continued the Indian, \"you came to know it at last?\"  \"I should just think I did,\" returned the trapper, a look of self-satisfied pride crossing his scarred visage as he thought of the celebrity as a hunter to which he had attained.  \"It took me a goodish while, of course, to circumvent it all, but in time I got to be--well, you know what, an' I'm not fond o' blowin' my own trumpet.\"  \"Yes; you came to it at last,\" repeated Whitewing, \"by giving your mind to things that at first you _did not understand_.\"  \"Come, come, my friend,\" said Little Tim, with a laugh; \"I'm no match for you in argiment, but, as I said before, I don't understand Manitou, an' I don't see, or feel, or hear him, so it's of no use tryin'.\"  \"What my friend knows not, another may tell him,\" said Whitewing.  \"The white man says he knows Manitou, and brings a message from him.  Three times I have listened to his words.  They seem the words of truth.  I go again to-day to hear his message.\"  The Indian stood up as he spoke, and the trapper also rose.  \"Well, well,\" he said, knocking the ashes out of his pipe, \"I'll go too, though I'm afeared it won't be o' much use.\"  The sermon which the man of God preached that day to the Indians was neither long nor profound, but it was delivered with the intense earnestness of one who thoroughly believes every word he utters, and feels that life and death may be trembling in the balance with those who listen.  It is not our purpose to give this sermon in detail, but merely to show its influence on Whitewing, and how it affected the stirring incidents which followed.  Already the good man had preached three times the simple gospel of Jesus to these Indians, and with so much success that some were ready to believe, but others doubted, just as in the days of old.  For the benefit of the former, he had this day chosen the text, \"Let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus.\"  Whitewing had been much troubled in spirit.  His mind, if very inquiring, was also very sceptical.  It was not that he would not--but that he could not-- receive anything unless _convinced_.  With a strong thirst after truth, he went to hear that day, but, strange to say, he could not fix his attention.  Only one sentence seemed to fasten firmly on his memory: \"It is the Spirit that quickeneth.\"  The text itself also made a profound impression on him.  The preacher had just concluded, and was about to raise his voice in prayer, when a shout was heard in the distance.  It came from a man who was seen running over the prairie towards the camp, with the desperate haste of one who runs for his life.  All was at once commotion.  The men sprang up, and, while some went out to meet the runner, others seized their weapons.  In a few seconds a young man with bloodshot eyes, labouring chest, and streaming brow burst into their midst, with the news that a band of Blackfoot warriors, many hundred strong, was on its way to attack the camp of Bald Eagle; that he was one of that old chief's braves, and was hasting to give his tribe timely warning, but that he had run so far and so fast as to be quite unable to go another step, and had turned aside to borrow a horse, or beg them to send on a fresh messenger.  \"_I_ will go,\" said Whitewing, on hearing this; \"and my horse is ready.\"  He wasted no more time with words, but ran towards the hollow where his steed had been hobbled, that is, the two front legs tied together so as to admit of moderate freedom without the risk of desertion.  He was closely followed by his friend Little Tim, who, knowing well the red man's staid and self-possessed character, was somewhat surprised to see by his flashing eyes and quick breathing that he was unusually excited.  \"Whitewing is anxious,\" he said, as they ran together.  \"The woman whom I love better than life is in Bald Eagle's camp,\" was the brief reply.  \"Oho!\" thought Little Tim, but he spoke no word, for he knew his friend to be extremely reticent in regard to matters of the heart.  For some time he had suspected him of what he styled a weakness in that organ. \"Now,\""]]]
