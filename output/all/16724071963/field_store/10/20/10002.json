A shark is a cowardly animal, and noise will drive it away.  \"When I went out two or three years ago, I had a Newfoundland dog, which was accustomed to leap into the water from almost any height.  I was very partial to him, and you may imagine my annoyance when, one day, as we were becalmed off the Western Islands, and a large shark came up alongside, the dog, at once perceiving it, plunged off the taffrail to seize it, swimming towards the shark, and barking as loud as he could. I fully expected that the monster would have despatched him in a moment; but to my surprise the shark was frightened and swam away, followed by the dog, until the boat that was lowered down had picked him up.\"  \"I don't think that the shark could have been very hungry.\"  \"Probably not; at all events I should not have liked to have been in Neptune's place.  I think the most curious plan of escaping from sharks is that pursued by the Cingalese divers, and often with success.\"  \"Tell it me, if you please.\"  \"The divers who go down for the pearl oysters off Ceylon generally drop from a boat, and descend in ten or twelve fathoms of water before they come to the bed of pearl oysters, which is upon a bank of mud: it often happens that when they are down, the sharks make for them, and I hardly need say that these poor fellows are constantly on the watch, looking in every direction while they are filling their baskets.  If they perceive a shark making for them, their only chance is to stir up the mud on the bank as fast as they can, which prevents the animal from distinguishing them, and under the cover of the clouded water they regain the surface; nevertheless, it does not always answer, and many are taken off every year.\"  \"A lady, proud of her pearl necklace, little thinks how many poor fellows may have been torn to pieces to obtain for her such an ornament.\"  \"Very true; and when we consider how many pearl-fisheries may have taken place, and how many divers may have been destroyed, before a string of fine pearls can be obtained, we might almost say that every pearl on the necklace has cost the life of a human creature.\"  \"How are the pearls disposed of, and who are the proprietors?\"  \"The government are the proprietors of the fishery, I believe; but whether they farm it out yearly, or not, I cannot tell; but this I know, that as the pearl oysters are taken, they are landed unopened and packed upon the beach in squares of a certain dimension.  When the fishing is over for the season, these square lots of pearl oysters are put up to auction and sold to the highest bidder, of course, `contents unknown;' so that it becomes a species of lottery; the purchaser may not find a single pearl in his lot, or he may find two or three, which will realise twenty times the price which he has paid for his lot.\"  \"It is, then, a lottery from beginning to end; the poor divers' lottery is shark or no shark; the purchasers', pearls or no pearls.  But Mr Fairburn is coming up the ladder, and I am anxious to know what was the fate of Mokanna.\"  Mr Fairburn, who had come on deck on purpose to continue the narrative, took his seat by his two fellow-passengers and went on as follows:--  \"I stated that Mokanna had been forwarded to the Cape.  You must have perceived that his only crime was that of fighting for his native land against civilised invaders; but this was a deep crime in the eyes of the colonial government; he was immediately thrown into the common gaol, and finally was condemned to be imprisoned for life on Robben Island, a place appropriated for the detention of convicted felons and other malefactors, who there work in irons at the slate-quarries.\"  \"May I ask, where is Robben Island?\"  \"It is an island a few miles from the mainland, close to Table Bay, upon which the Cape Town is built.  \"Mokanna remained there about a year, when, having made his intentions known to some Caffres who were confined there with him, he contrived out of the iron hoops of the casks to make some weapons like cutlasses, with which he armed his followers, rose upon the guard and overpowered them; he then seized the boat, and with his Caffres made for the mainland. Unfortunately, in attempting to disembark upon the rocks on the mainland, the boat was upset in the surf, which was very violent; Mokanna clung some time to a rock, but at last was washed off and thus perished the unfortunate leader of the Caffres.\"  \"Poor fellow,\" said Alexander; \"he deserved a better fate and a more generous enemy; but did the war continue?\"  \"No; it ended in a manner every way worthy of that in which it was begun.  You recollect that the war was commenced to support Gaika, our selected chief of the Caffres, against the real chiefs.  The Caffres had before been compelled to give up their territories on our side of the Fish River; the colonial government now insisted upon their retiring still further, that is, beyond the Keisi and Chumi rivers, by which 3000 more square miles were added to the colonial territory.  This was exacted, in order that there might be a neutral ground to separate the Caffres and the Dutch boors, and put an end to further robberies on either side.  The strangest part of the story is, that this territory was not taken away from the Caffre chiefs, against whom we had made war, but from Gaika, our ally, to support whom we had entered into the war.\"  \"Well, it was even-handed--not justice, but injustice, at all events.\"  \"Exactly so; and so thought Gaika, for when speaking of the protection he received from the colonial government, he said, `But when I look upon the large extent of fine country which has been taken from me, I am compelled to say, that, although protected, I am _rather oppressed_ by my _protectors_.'\"  \"Unjust as was the mode of obtaining the neutral ground, I must say that it appears to me to have been a good policy to put one between the parties.\"  \"I grant it; but what was the conduct of the colonial government?  This neutral ground was afterwards given away in large tracts to the Dutch boors, so as again to bring them into contact with the Caffres.\"  \"Is it possible?\"  \"Yes; to men who had always been opposed to the English government, who had twice risen in rebellion against them, and who had tried to bring in the Caffres to destroy the colony.  Neither are the commandoes, or excursions against the Caffres, put an end to: Makomo, the son of Gaika, our late ally, has, I hear, been the party now attacked.  I trust, however, that we may soon have affairs going on in a more favourable and reputable manner; indeed, I am sure that, now the government at home have been put in possession of the facts, such will be the case.  \"I have now given you a very brief insight into the history of the Cape up to the present time.  There are many points which I have passed over, not wishing to diverge from a straightforward narrative; but upon any questions you may wish to ask, I shall be most happy to give you all the information in my power.  I cannot, however, dismiss the subject without making one remark, which is, that it is principally, if not wholly, to the missionaries, to their exertions and to their representations, that what good has been done is to be attributed.  They are entitled to the greatest credit and the warmest praise; and great as has been the misrule of this colony for many years, it would have been much greater and much more disgraceful, if it had not been for their efforts. Another very important alteration has been taking place in the colony, which will eventually be productive of much good.  I refer to the British immigration, which every year becomes more extensive; and as soon as the British population exceeds and masters that of the old Dutch planters and boors, we shall have better feeling in the colony.  Do not suppose that all the Dutch boors are such as those whose conduct I have been obliged to point out.  There are many worthy men, although but few educated or enlightened.  \"I know from my own observation that the failings and prejudices against the natives are fast fading away, and that lately the law has been able to hold its ground, and has been supported by the people inhabiting the districts.  The Dutch, with all their prejudices and all their vices, will soon be swallowed up by the inundation of English settlers, and will gradually be so incorporated and intermingled by marriage that no distinction will be known.  Time, however, is required for such consolidation and cementation; that time is arriving fast, and the future prospects of the Cape are as cheering, as you may think, from my narrative, they have been disheartening and gloomy.\"  \"I trust in God that such will be the case,\" replied Alexander.  \"If this wind continues, in a few days we shall be at the Cape, and I shall be most anxious to hear how affairs are going on.\"  \"I had a letter just before I set out from England, stating that the Zoolu tribes, to the northward of the Caffres, are in an unquiet state; and as you must pass near to these tribes on your journey, I am anxious to know the truth.  At all events, Chaka is dead; he was murdered about two years back by his own relations.\"  \"Who was Chaka?\" inquired Alexander.  \"That I have yet to tell you; at present we have only got as far as the Caffres, who are immediately on our frontiers.\"    CHAPTER SEVEN.  The wind continued fair, and the vessel rapidly approached the Cape. Alexander, who had contracted a great friendship for Mr Swinton, had made known to him the cause of his intended journey into the interior, and the latter volunteered, if his company would not "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21566"],["title","The Good Old Songs We Used to Sing, '61 to '65 (#0)"],["body","Linda Cantoni, from The Civil War Songbook (Dover Publications, 1977), and from 19th-Century sheet music in the Library of Congress Civil War and Historic Sheet Music Collections (http://www.loc.gov).

(Used by permission of S. Brainard's Sons, owners of the copyright.)   [Illustration: MAJ. GEN'L W.T. SHERMAN.]  Our camp fires shone bright on the mountain   That frowned on the river below, While we stood by our guns in the morning,   And eagerly watched for the foe, When a rider came out from the darkness   That hung over mountains and tree, And shouted, \"Boys, up and be ready,   For Sherman will march to the sea.\"  When cheer upon cheer for bold Sherman   Went up from each valley and glen, And the bugle re-echoed the music   That came from the lips of the men, For we knew that the stars on our banner   More bright in their splendor would be, And that blessings from Northland would greet us   As Sherman marched down to the sea.  Then forward, boys, forward, to battle,   We marched on our wearysome way, And we strewed the wild hills of Resaca--   God bless those who fell on that day. Then Kennesaw, dark in its glory,   Frowned down on the flag of the free; But the East and the West bore our standard   As Sherman marched down to the sea.  Still onward we pressed till our banner   Swept out from Atlanta's grim walls, And the blood of the patriot dampened   The soil where traitor's flag falls. But we paused not to weep for the fallen   Who slept by each river and tree; Yet we twined them wreaths of the laurel   As Sherman marched down to the sea.  Proud, proud was our army that morning   That stood by the cypress and pine When Sherman said, \"Boys, you are weary;   This day fair Savannah is thine,\" Then sang we a song for our chieftain   That echoed o'er river and lea, And the stars on our banner shone brighter   When Sherman marched on to the sea.     MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA.  Used by permission of S. Brainard's Sons.

CHORUS.    \"Hurrah! hurrah! we bring the Jubilee! Hurrah! hurrah! the flag that makes you free!\"   So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea While we were marching through Georgia.  How the darkies shouted when they heard the joyful sound! How the turkeys gobbled which our commissary found! How the sweet potatoes even started from the ground,     While we were marching through Georgia!--CHORUS.  Yes, and there were Union men who wept with joyful tears When they saw the honored flag they had not seen for years; Hardly could they be restrained from breaking forth in cheers     While we were marching through Georgia.--CHORUS.  \"Sherman's dashing Yankee boys will never reach the coast!\" So the saucy rebel said, and 'twas a handsome boast; Had they not forgotten, alas! to reckon with the host,     While we were marching through Georgia.--CHORUS.  So we made a thoroughfare for Freedom and her train, Sixty miles in latitude,--three hundred to the main, Treason fled before us, for resistance was in vain,     While we were marching through Georgia.--CHORUS.

Halpine (Private Miles O'Riley), 47th N.Y. Vol. Inf.  KEY OF C.   [Illustration: ENGINEERS AND MECHANICS.]  There are bonds of all sorts in this world of ours, Fetters of friendship and ties of flowers,   And true lovers' knots, I ween. The boys and the girls are bound by a kiss, But there's never a bond, old friend, like this:   We have drunk from the same canteen!  The same canteen, my soldier friend,   The same canteen; There's never a bond like this:   We have drunk from the same canteen!  It was sometimes water and sometimes milk, Sometimes apple-jack as fine as silk;   But, whatever the tipple has been, We shared it together in bane or in bliss, And I warn you, friend, when I think of this:   We have drunk from the same canteen.  We've shared our blankets and tents together, And marched and fought in all kinds of weather,   And hungry and full we've been; Had days of battle and days of rest, But this memory I cling to and love the best:   We've drunk from the same canteen.  For when wounded I lay on the outer slope, With my blood flowing fast and but little hope   On which my faint spirit might lean, Oh! then, I remember, you crawled to my side, And bleeding so fast it seemed both must have died,   We have drunk from the same canteen!     THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER.  KEY OF C.   [Illustration]  Oh! say, can you see by the dawn's early light   What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming-- Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous flight,   O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming! And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there; Oh! say, does that Star Spangled Banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!  On that shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep,   Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep,   As it fitfully blows, now conceals, now discloses! Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream; 'Tis the Star Spangled Banner, oh! long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!  And where is that "]]]
