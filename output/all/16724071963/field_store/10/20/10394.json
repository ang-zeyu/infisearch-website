Immediately after, Polly ducked her head, and thus escaped being blown away, like a Hindoo mutineer from a cannon's mouth, as the captain went off in another fit.  \"Oh! father,\" said Polly, quite solemnly, as she descended and looked up from a comparatively safe distance, \"isn't it awful?\"  \"Yes, Poll, it's about the wust 'un I've had since I came from Barbadoes; but the last panful has mollified it, I think, and your nor'-wester has Pollyfied it, so, turn into your bunk, old girl, an' take a nap.  You've much need of it, poor thing.\"  \"No, father, if I get into my crib I'll sleep so heavy that you won't be able to wake me.  I'll just lie down where I was before.\"  \"Well, well--among the rubbish if ye prefer it; no matter s'long as you have a snooze,\" growled the captain as he turned over, while the fairy disappeared into the dark recess from which she had risen.  Just then a tap was heard at the door.  \"Come in,\" roared the captain. A tall, broad-shouldered, nautical-looking man entered, took off his hat, and stood before the hammock, whence the captain gave him a stern, searching glance, and opened fire on him with his pipe.  \"Forgive me if I intrude, Captain Samson,\" said the stranger; \"I know you, although you don't know me.  You start to-morrow or next day, I understand, for Melbourne?\"  \"Wind and weather permittin',\" growled the captain.  \"Well, what then?\"  \"Have you completed your crew?\" asked the stranger.  \"Nearly.  What then?\" replied the captain with a touch of ferocity, for he felt sensations of an approaching paroxysm.  \"Will you engage _me_?\" asked Philosopher Jack, for it was he.  \"In what capacity?\" demanded the captain somewhat sarcastically.  \"As an ordinary seaman--or a boy if you will,\" replied Edwin, with a smile.  \"No,\" growled Samson, decisively, \"I won't engage you; men with kid gloves and white hands don't suit me.\"  From the mere force of habit the young student had pulled on his gloves on leaving his lodging, and had only removed that of the right hand on entering the captain's dwelling.  He now inserted a finger at the wrist of the left-hand glove, ripped it off, and flung it with its fellow under the grate.  Thereafter he gathered some ashes and soot from the fireplace, with which he put his hands on a footing with those of a coal-heaver.  \"Will you take me now, captain?\" he said, returning to the hammock, and spreading out his hands.  The captain gave vent to a short laugh, which brought on a tremendous fit, at the conclusion of which he gasped, \"Yes, my lad, p'r'aps I will; but first I must know something about you.\"  \"Certainly,\" said the philosopher, and at once gave the captain a brief outline of his circumstances.  \"Well, you know your own affairs best\" said Captain Samson when he had finished; \"I'm no judge of such a case, but as you're willin' to ship, I'm willin' to ship you.  Come here before ten to-morrow.  Good night. There, it's a-comin'--hash--k--!\"  In the midst of another furious paroxysm Edwin Jack retired.  Not long after, the captain raised himself on one elbow, listened intently for a few seconds, and, having satisfied himself that Polly was asleep, slipped from his hammock--as only seamen know how--and proceeded to dress with the utmost caution.  He was evidently afraid of the little sleeper among the rubbish.  It was quite interesting to observe the quiet speed with which he thrust his great limbs into his ample garments, gazing anxiously all the time at Polly's corner.  Issuing from his own door with the step of an elephantine mouse, the captain went rapidly through several streets to the house of an intimate friend, whom he found at supper with his wife and family.  \"Evenin', Bailie Trench; how are 'ee, Mrs T? how's everybody?\" said the captain, in a hearty rasping voice, as he shook hands right and left, while one of his huge legs was taken possession of, and embraced, by the bailie's only daughter, a pretty little girl of six.  \"Why, Samson,\" exclaimed the bailie, after quiet had been restored, and his friend had been thrust into a chair with little Susan on his knee, \"I thought you were laid up with influenza--eh?\"  \"So I was, bailie, an' so I am,\" replied the captain; \"leastwise I'm still on the sick-list, and was in my hammock till about half an hour ago, but I'm gettin' round fast.  The night air seems to do me a world o' good--contrariwise to doctor's expectations.\"  \"Have some supper?\" said Mrs Trench, who was a weakish lady with watery eyes.  \"No supper, Mrs T, thank 'ee; the fact is, I've come on business.  I should be on my beam-ends by rights.  I'm absent without leave, an' have only a few minutes to spare.  The passenger I spoke of has changed his mind and his berth is free, so I'm glad to be able to take your son Ben after all.  But he'll have to get ready quick, for the _Lively Poll_ sails the day after to-morrow or next day--all bein' well.\"  The eyes of young Benjamin Trench sparkled.  He was a tall, thin, rather quiet lad of eighteen.  \"I can be ready to-night if you wish it, Captain Samson,\" he said, with a flush on his usually pale face.  Beside Mrs Trench there sat a sturdy little boy.  He was the bosom friend of Ben--a bright ruddy fellow of fourteen, overflowing with animal spirits, and with energy enough for three lads of his size.  This youth's countenance fell so visibly when Ben spoke of going away, that Mrs Trench could not help noticing it.  \"Why, what's the matter, Wilkins?\" she asked.  \"Oh, nothing!\" returned the boy, \"only I don't like to hear Ben speak of leaving us all and going to Australia.  And I would give all the world to go with him.  Won't you take me as a cabin boy, Captain Samson?\"  \"Sorry I can't, lad,\" said the captain, with a grin, \"got a cabin boy already.\"  \"Besides, your father would not let you,\" said Mrs Trench, \"and it would never do to go without his leave.  Only misfortune could come of that.\"  \"Humph! it's very hard,\" pouted the boy.  \"I wanted him to get me into the navy, and he wouldn't; and now I want him to get me into the merchant service, and he won't.  But I'll go in spite of him.\"  \"No, you won't, Watty,\" said Ben, laying his hand on his friend's shoulder.  \"Yes, Ben, I will,\" returned little Wilkins, with such an air of determination that every one except Ben laughed.  \"Now, bailie,\" said the captain, rising, \"I'm off.  The truth is, I wouldn't have come if it had not been important to let you know at once to get your boy ready; but I had no one to send except Polly, and I wouldn't send her out at night by herself for all the wealth of Indy. Moreover, _she_ wouldn't have let me out to-night for any consideration whatever.  She's very strict with me, is my little keeper.  I wouldn't for the world she should wake and find me gone.  So, good-night all.\"  Ten minutes more, and the guilty man entered his dwelling on tiptoe.  In order to get into his hammock with extreme caution he forsook his ancient method of a spring, and mounted on an empty cask.  The cask was not equal to the emergency.  He went through the head of it with a hideous crash!  Spurning it from him, he had just time to plunge into his place of repose and haul the clothes over him, when Polly emerged from her lair with wondering eyes.  \"What ever was that, father?\"  \"Nothin', my dear, nothin' in partickler--only a cask I kicked over. Now, then, Poll, since you're keepin' me awake in this fashion, it's your dooty to soothe me with an extra panful, and another nor'-wester-- so, up wi' the pyramid; and after you've done it you must turn into your crib.  I'll not want you again to-night; the cough's much better. There--thank 'ee.  Pollyfy me now--that's right.  Good-night.\"  Oh, base mariner! little did you merit such a pleasant termination to your evening's work; but you are not the only wicked man in this world who receives more than he deserves.  Two days after the incidents just related a noble ship spread her canvas to a favouring breeze, and bowing farewell to her port of departure, commenced the long long voyage to the Antipodes.  She was not a passenger ship, but a trader; nevertheless there were a few passengers on her quarter-deck, and among these towered the colossal figure of Captain Samson.  Beside him, holding his hand, stood a fairy-like little creature with brown curls and pretty blue eyes.  Not far from her, leaning over the bulwarks, Benjamin Trench frantically waved a handkerchief and wiped his eyes.  The signal was responded to, with equal feeling, by the bailie, his wife, and little Susan.  A good number of people, young and old, assembled at the pier-head, among whom many waved handkerchiefs, and hands, and scarfs, and hats to the crew.  Among the sailors who gazed wistfully towards the pier was one who made no farewell signal, and received no parting wave.  Philosopher Jack had concealed his intention of going to sea from all his college chums, and a bitter feeling of loneliness oppressed his heart as he thought of his old father and mother, and the lowly cottage on the Border hills.  He had not, indeed, acted in direct opposition to the wishes of his parents, but he had disobeyed the well-known Scripture command to do them \"honour,\" for he had resolved on his course of action without consulting them, or asking their advice.  He felt that he had very selfishly forsaken them in their old age; in the hour of their sore distress, and at a time when they stood woefully in need of his strong muscles, buoyant spirit, and energetic brain.  In short, Edwin Jack began to feel that he required all his philosophy, and something more, to enable him to face the future with the unflinching courage of a man.  So the ship moved slowly on, revealing on her stern the \"_Lively Poll_\" in letters of burnished gold--past the pier-head, down the broad river, out upon the widening firth, beyond lighthouse, buoy, and beacon, until at last the fresh Atlantic breezes filled her "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21756"],["title","Philosopher Jack (#2)"],["body","sails.  And ever as she rose and sank upon the rolling waves, their swish and thud fell strangely on the ear of one who lay deep down in the recesses of the hull, where--among barrels of pork, and casks of tar, and cans of oil, and coils of rope, and other unsavoury stores--he consorted with rats and mice and an uneasy conscience, in thick darkness.  This was a \"stowaway.\"  He was a sturdy, bright, ruddy little fellow of fourteen. Down in that unwholesome place, with a few ship-biscuits and a bottle of water to keep him alive, he would have looked like a doubled-up overgrown hedgehog if there had been light enough to reveal him.  Thus, with its little world of hopes and fears, its cares and pleasures, and its brave, trembling, trusting, sorrowing, joyful, anxious, reckless hearts, the good ship passed from the shores of Britain, until her sails quivered like a petrel's wings on the horizon, and then vanished into the boundless bosom of the mighty sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  TELLS OF A GHOST AND AN OVERWHELMING DISASTER.  It may seem strange, nevertheless it is true, that ignorance is a misfortune which now and then results in good.  Of course we do not make this remark in commendation of ignorance, but if Baldwin Burr had not been ignorant and densely stupid, Philosopher Jack would not have had the pleasure of instructing him, and the seaman himself would not have enjoyed that close intimacy which frequently subsists between teacher and pupil.  Even Polly Samson derived benefit from Baldwin's want of knowledge, for, being remarkably intelligent for her years, and having been well taught, she took great pleasure in enlightening his darkness.  \"How is it,\" she asked one day, while sitting on the cabin skylight and looking up in the man's rugged countenance, \"how is it that you are so stupid?\"  Burr, who was steering, gave the wheel a turn, looked up at the mast-head, then round the horizon, then down at his questioner with a bland smile, and said--  \"Well now, Miss Polly, d'ee know, that's wot I can't exactly tell. P'r'aps it's 'cause of a nat'ral want of brains, or, maybe, 'cause the brains is too much imbedded in fat--for I'm a fleshy man, as you see-- or, p'r'aps it's 'cause I never went to school, my parients bein' poor, uncommon poor, though remarkably honest.  I've sometimes thought, w'en meditatin' on the subject, that my havin' bin born of a Friday may have had somethin' to do with it.\"  \"Oh, Baldwin,\" said Polly with a little laugh, \"surely you can't believe that.  Father says it's all nonsense about Friday being an unlucky day.\"  \"P'r'aps it is, an' p'r'aps it ain't,\" returned the cautious seaman.  \"I regard your father, my dear, as a deeply learned man, and would give in, if I could, to wotever he says, but facts is facts, and opinions is opinions, you can't change that, nohow you fix it.  Wot's the cap'n's opinions, now, as to ghosts?\"  \"He don't believe in 'em at all,\" was Polly's prompt answer.  \"No more do I, for father knows everything, and he's always right.\"  \"He's a lucky man to have you, Polly, and there's a lucky boy knockin' about the world somewheres lookin' out for you.  A good daughter, it's said, inwariably makes a good wife; which you don't understand just now, but you'll come to in course of time.  Hows'ever, as I wos observin', I've been of the same opinion as your father till two nights ago, when I heard a ghost right under the deck, it seemed to me, blow my hammock, where there's nothin' but ship's stores and rats.\"  \"Heard a ghost!\" exclaimed Polly, with opening eyes.  \"Ay, an' seed 'im too,\" said Burr.  \"Night before yesterday I heer'd 'im as plain as I hear myself.  He wos groanin', an' it's quite impossible that a tar-barrel, or a cask, or a rat, could groan.  The only thing that puzzled me wos that he seemed to snore; more than that he sneezed once or twice.  Now, I never heard it said that a ghost could sleep or catch cold.  Did you, Polly?\"  Polly laughed and said that she never did, and asked eagerly what the ghost was like.  \"It was wery much like an or'nary man of small size,\" said the seaman, \"but it were too dark to make out its face.  I know the figure of every soul in the ship by this time, an' I could swear before a maginstrate, or a bench of bishops, that the ghost is neither one of the crew nor a passenger.\"  \"Why didn't you speak to it?\" asked Polly.  \"So I did speak to it, but it wouldn't answer; then I made a grab at it, but it was as active as a kitten, dodged round the mainmast, flew for'ed on inwisible wings, and went slap down the fore-scuttle, head first, with a crash that would have broke the neck of anything but a ghost.\"  At this interesting point the conversation was interrupted by Edwin Jack, whose turn it was to relieve the man at the wheel.  He nodded to Polly as he came up, took his post, and received the ship's \"course\" from Burr, who thrust his hands into his pockets, and left the quarter-deck.  Edwin was by this time a considerably changed man, although but a few days at sea.  The rough blue trousers, guernsey, and pea-jacket, took as naturally to his strong limbs as if he had been born and bred a sailor; and already some huge blisters, a few scars, and not a little tar, had rendered his hands creditable.  Steering at the time was a mere matter of form, as a dead calm prevailed.  Our philosopher therefore amused himself and Polly with commentaries on the ghost-subject which Burr had raised.  Late that night, when the stars were shining in a cloudless sky, and winking at their reflections in the glassy ocean, the ghost appeared to Edwin Jack.  It was on this wise:  Jack, being one of the watch on deck, went to the port bulwarks near the foremast shrouds, leant over, and, gazing down into the reflected sky, thought sadly of past, present, and future.  Tiring at last of his meditations, he went towards a man who appeared to be skulking under the shadow of the long-boat and remarked that it was a fine night, but the man made no reply.  \"A most enjoyable night, shipmate,\" he said, going closer.  \"I'm glad you think so,\" said the ghost, \"it's anything but enjoyable to _me_.  The state of the weather hasn't much effect, either one way or another, on a fellow who is half-dead with hunger, half-choked with a cold caught among the rats and stores, and half-killed by a tumble down the fore-scuttle, or whatever may be the name of that vile ladder that leads to the regions below.\"  \"Surely,\" exclaimed Jack in surprise, seizing the ghost by the shoulders and looking close into its face, \"I have heard your voice before now, and, eh?--no, I don't know you.\"  \"Yes, Philosopher Jack, you do know me,\" returned the ghost; \"I've had the honour of playing cricket with you on the green, though you've forgotten me, and no wonder, for I've suffered much from bad air and sea-sickness of late.  My name is Walter, more familiarly Watty Wilkins.\"  \"Little Wilkins!\" exclaimed Jack, in surprise, \"well, you _are_ changed; you don't mean to say that you've run away from home?\"  \"That's just what I've done,\" said the poor lad in a tone of despondency; \"but you've no occasion to shake your head at me so solemnly, for, to all appearance, you have run away too.\"  \"No, Wilkins, you are wrong, I have walked away, being my own master, and I have done it openly, though I admit somewhat hastily--\"  Jack was interrupted at that moment by Ben Trench laying a hand on his shoulder.  \"It strikes me,\" he said, in some surprise, \"that I recognise the voice of a townsman--Mister Jack, if I mistake not?\"  \"No, sir,\" replied the philosopher, \"not _Mister_, only Edwin Jack, seaman aboard the _Lively Poll_.  You are right, however, in styling me townsman.  Allow me to introduce you to another townsman, Mr Watty Wilkins, stowaway on board of the same vessel!\"  Trench had not, in the darkness, recognised his friend.  He now seized him by both shoulders, and peering into his face, said--  \"O Watty, Watty, have you really done it?  I had thought better of you.\"  \"I _said_ I would do it, and I've _done_ it,\" returned the little youth somewhat testily; \"and now I want to know what is to be done next.\"  \"Report yourself and take the consequences,\" said Jack, promptly.  This advice being seconded by Ben Trench, Watty Wilkins went aft to the captain, who had just come on deck, touched his cap, and confessed himself.  For some moments the captain spoke not a word, but looked at the young culprit with a portentous frown.  Then, uttering something like a deep bass growl, he ordered the lad to follow him into his private cabin. When there, Captain Samson seated himself on a locker, and with a hand on each knee, glared at his prisoner so long and so fiercely from under his shaggy brows, that Watty, in spite of his recklessness, began to feel uneasy.  \"So, youngster, you've run away?\" he said at length, in deep solemnity.  \"Yes, sir,\" replied Wilkins.  \"And you think yourself a fine clever fellow, no doubt?\"  \"No, sir, I don't,\" said Watty, with much humility.  \"I knew your father, boy,\" continued the captain, assuming a softer and more serious tone, \"and I think he is a good man.\"  \"He is, sir,\" returned the boy promptly.  \"Ay, and he is a kind man; he has been kind to _you_, I think.\"  Watty hung his head.  \"He has fed you, clothed you, educated you since you was a babby; nursed you, maybe, in sickness, and prayed for you, no doubt that God would make you a good, obedient and loving son.\"  The boy's head drooped still lower.  \"And for all this,\" continued the captain, \"you have repaid him by running away.  Now, my lad, as you have made your bed you shall lie on it.  I'll clap your nose to the grindstone, and keep it there. Steward!\"  A smart little man answered to the call.  \"Take this boy for'ed, and teach him to clean up.  Don't spare him.\"  In obedience to this order the steward took little Wilkins forward and introduced him to the cook, who introduced him to the coppers and scrubbing brushes.  From that"]]]
