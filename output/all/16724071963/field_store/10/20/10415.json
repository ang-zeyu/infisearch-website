The plank was swung and fastened, and the crew of natives rushed off and met their friends, but George and Harry were not permitted to walk down the gang plank. The joy at seeing them again was so intense that the people took them on their shoulders, and the Professor had a hard time to get near enough to grasp them and bid a welcome.  The people marveled at the boys. They were dressed up in regulation American style, and the Professor asked them if they had brought the \"latest\" cuts to put in the show windows.  Everybody followed, and the bantering and cheering made a continuous performance for them until they reached their home. All the chiefs were there, dressed up for the occasion, and what delighted them more than anything else was the fact that the Krishnos, the former witch doctors of the tribes, and who were now the teachers for the children, were the first to offer congratulations on their return.  There was no work in the town that day. Everybody determined to celebrate, and it was with hearts full of joy that the boys witnessed the demonstrations in their behalf.  \"Isn't this a glorious home-coming?\" said George. \"It was worth the trip here to witness it.\"  \"It does seem strange to call it a 'home-coming,' but that is just what it is,\" answered Harry. \"How happy the people are. They seem to appreciate everything that has been done for them, and it is such a pleasure to do things for those who appreciate it.\"  The stories which John brought to the Professor were so beguiling that he promised the boys that he would probably be able during the next year to make a visit with them to their homes, and this delighted them beyond measure.  Although they had been absent four months, they noted many improvements made during their absence. The boys, on their own initiative, visited many of the homes, and talked to the people, and told them of the visit home. And how those simple people enjoyed this kindly act, and cherished it for months afterwards.  But it was now time to think seriously of the contemplated voyage of discovery, which was ever uppermost in the minds of the boys. While conversing on the subject a few evenings after their return, Harry remarked: \"I suppose we must use the _Pioneer_ for our trip, as the _Wonder_ will have to make the regular trips?\"  \"John and I think that would be the wisest plan. The native sailors are now well adapted to handle her, and do you know that Sutoto sailed her around the island?\"  This was pleasing to the boys, who liked Sutoto.  \"And who are the others that went with him?\"  \"Why Lolo was one of them, and Stut and Chump. Oh, they had a jolly time; so they said, and I can believe it, because they are simply crazy to make another trip.\" And the Professor beamed as he related many of the incidents which they told him of their experiences.  While they were talking, Sutoto appeared, and was immediately admitted. After some talk, Sutoto said: \"The Professor said that when you returned you would have some work for me with the _Pioneer_.\"  \"Yes, and you shall command her,\" said Harry.  Sutoto could not but show his pleasure. \"I knew you would come back, but so many here said you would not.\"  At this point Professor explained that there were many rumors among the people to the effect that the boys would never again come back, and all showed grief at the news. I assured them that you were just as anxious to return as they were to have you and I then told Sutoto that I knew you had plans which would require his services, but I thought it would be more agreeable if you imparted the nature of it to him.  The boys were not slow to outline the plans to him, but advised him to keep the information to himself, which he promised to do. It was enough for him to know that he would command the ship. It was this that induced Sutoto to take out the ship, and finally to circumnavigate the island, so as to try out the sailors and properly to fit them for the work when the boys returned.  \"Now that being settled, Sutoto, we are going to leave the work of provisioning the _Pioneer_ to you. We must take a supply of guns and ammunition, as well, and probably it would be wise to have a small troop of the best soldiers,\" was Harry's instruction.  \"Uraso wants to go. I am sure he would be the best one to take.  \"What will Muro say to that?\" asked the Professor.  \"Oh, take him along, by all means,\" said George, \"because I want Lolo to go with us.\"  It was then settled that they were to take a small force, sufficient for immediate purposes, and if it was found that the islands discovered were too well settled with hostiles it would be an easy matter to remain aloof, or return for reinforcements.  While arrangements were being made for the departure of the expedition Blakely informed the Professor that it would be good policy to make up part of the cargo of the _Wonder_ with copper, and that both vessels could proceed to the southeastern part of the island, and the men aboard could be used to transport the copper to the sea.  In this way the expedition would serve a double purpose. No one attempted to go contrary to the wishes of Blakely on matters which touched upon the commercial ventures in which they were engaged.  John was only too glad that Blakely had hit upon that idea, as he was anxious to visit that part of the coast, contiguous to the copper deposit, and what was more, he wanted to see the place where Blakely found the missive which the boys had translated.  As there was still a week before the _Wonder_ would sail for its northern port of call, both of the ships wended their way to the east, skirting the coast as closely as possible, John on the _Pioneer_ with the boys.  They now had an opportunity to see the Great South Mountains from the sea. They remembered when they last saw them on land, during the campaign against the Illyas, and also the wonderful village on the western side of the mountains. What would their present wanderings bring forth?  That evening they landed within a cove, both vessels being brought as near the shore as possible.  \"We can safely go in close this evening, because the tide is now out,\" said John.  Sutoto, while he had navigated the vessel, and had shown remarkable skill, was, nevertheless, not well versed in tides and the action of the moon.  Quick to learn, he asked John why the tides thus changed. John explained the reason that the tides flowed in and out twice during each twenty-four hours, or a little less than that time, so that high water, or low water would always be at a time a little later each day, and then stated that it would be an easy matter to so make the calculations that they would be able to tell ahead for a whole year just when during each day the highest or lowest water would be.  While waiting on the ship during the hours of the evening they were interested in the magnificent fire flies which they saw on the shore and along the mountain side. This was not an unfamiliar sight to them as they had witnessed such scenes many times before.  But now they saw such sights as they had never before observed. They must have been giant glow birds, because some of the lights flew at least hundreds of feet emitting continuous streams of light, and this was not all, many of the lights were colored, particularly red and blue or simply faint tinges of those tints.  \"I have often thought that there is nothing more wonderful than the fire fly,\" said George.  \"But what do you think makes it so wonderful?\" asked John.  \"Well, I suppose the wonderful part is that it has strength enough to make a light,\" answered Harry.  \"No, the remarkable thing is that the light which it emits is absolutely cool. Experiments which have been made go to show that there is no heat. In every form of light which man has been able to produce thus far artificially, a great heat is evolved, and it would be a most valuable discovery to find out why these insects are able to do it without raising the temperature.\"  [Illustration: _Fig. 3. The Fire-fly._]  \"But what difference does it make if heat is produced?\" asked Harry.  \"The production of heat means the loss of power. The heat generated takes up more of the power than the light which is produced, so that it would be a great economy if the heat could be dispensed with.\"  \"But if there was no heat in the light produced would it make any difference in the lamps themselves?\"  \"Unquestionably. The lamps would last much longer.\"  \"What are the things which must be learned in order to get the secret of cold light?\"  \"Well, there are number of questions which must be determined. While it is known that the fire fly and the glow worm emit what is called a phosphorescent light, this fact is a mere prelude to the knowledge of what is the exact color of daylight.\"  \"Color of Daylight? Why, I supposed it was white.\"  \"But the light of the glow worm and fire fly are not white.\"  They watched them, and soon appreciated that John's statement was true.  \"You asked what were some of the things to be solved? Well, to find out the secret of the phosphorescent glow. That is one thing. What is the best artificial light, is the next. Then, what substance will have the most intense glow when a current passes through it, and give out the least heat.\"  \"Well, has no one attempted to explain any of these things?\"  \"Yes; many explanations have been offered, but all of them leave the subject dark somewhere.\" And John laughed as he saw that the boys appreciated his little attempt at witticism.  \"But the time will come when man will find out this, as everything in his way. When you think of it, that electricians, chemists, metallurgists, physiologists, engineers, physicists and microscopists, are all working on the problem, we should be able to extract the secret sooner or later.\"  \"I am going to have some of those fellows,\" shouted George,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21760"],["title","The Wonder Island Boys: Adventures on Strange Islands (#8)"],["body","when the natives on board heard the request of George there was a scramble for the boats, and John was delighted to give them instructions for capturing the insects.  Early the next day the entire party landed, and Blakely, together with John and the boys, started for the high peak, the one visible for miles from the west, and which John and the boys often wished to visit.  One of the things which the boys brought with them from the States, was a pair of strong glasses, and these were constantly in use.  \"What do you say to scaling that point?\" said Harry.  \"Just what I have been thinking about,\" said George.  Sutoto, who was with the party, showed by his glowing eyes that he wanted to be of the party. \"Certainly you shall go,\" said Harry.  \"Before going we must visit the place where the Walter note was found,\" called out John.  The boys had forgotten this. \"Most assuredly,\" answered George, \"I had almost forgotten that.\"  Blakely led the way up alongside the rugged cliff. \"See that bluish green outcropping,\" he said as they were pulling themselves up.  John stopped and chipped off some specimens. \"Wonderful!\" he exclaimed. \"Better than anything I have ever found in Mexico. These hills remind me of the formation all along western Chihuahua, and through northeastern Sonora.\"  The ledge on which they finally emerged was fully six hundred feet above sea level. When they turned around and viewed the sea below them, and saw the ships at anchor, they were delirious with joy. How Sutoto enjoyed the scene. He had never seen anything like it before and he was amazed and stupefied. He turned and grasped George by the hand. He was too full to speak.  \"But wait, Sutoto, until we get to the top,\" said Harry, as he saw his countenance. As they looked up at the top they wondered what they might see from the elevation.  \"Here is the spot,\" cried out Blakely. \"This is the pot in which the message was found. And here is something that I dug up afterwards.\"  [Illustration: _Fig. 4. Inscription on the Skull._]  The boys crowded around. It was a skull on which was engraved the characters ABCC, followed by a star.  All looked at John, thinking he might offer some solution. He turned it over, and examined every portion. Not a word was spoken. \"Tell me the exact position in which this was found,\" he asked, as he looked at Blakely.  \"The first thing I found was the pot, which was simply turned upside down, in exactly this way. This is the place. It rested on this flat stone. The skull was behind it on this upper shelf.\"  \"And was there nothing else on the shelf?\"  \"Nothing whatever.\"  John stooped down and carefully examined the shelf. All followed his motions. \"Do you see that mark?\" he said, pointing to a heavy scratch, which was now plain. \"That mark is associated with the skull, if not with the message. I am unable at this time fully to decipher the marks on the skull, but I have an idea of the meaning.\"  \"I wonder if the scratch across that is in the same direction as the arrow in the letter?\" asked George.  \"Unquestionably: let me see your glasses,\" and George unslung them as John took them and gazed long in the direction of the line on the shelf.  He lowered the glasses and slowly shook his head. Something was forming itself in his mind, this was evident. He walked around the ledge and back again. Finally, he said: \"I wish it were night, it might help to solve the riddle.\"  \"And why?\" asked Harry.  \"Those letters have reference to the star which follows.\"  \"It seems to me to be a singular thing that anyone should leave this here in the hope or expectation that it could be a guide for any one,\" remarked George.  \"There is certainly one explanation of that,\" answered John. \"It is evident that the articles were placed there as a form of note to others, and it is a sort of cryptic sign, intelligible only to those who have the key. The fact that these signs are here denote several things, one of which is that something important, such, for instance, as treasures, or the location of hidden wealth, or the directions necessary to find mining lodes, or even to point out the direction and distances of other islands in the distance.\"  \"But,\" said Harry, \"the fact that we have found these things here looks as though there were other parties besides Walter and that he was associated with them in some sort of enterprise.\"  \"Quite true; but I am not at all satisfied that the Walter note has anything to do with the skull. In fact there is every evidence to me that they are entirely disconnected with each other.\"  This announcement was the most surprising to Blakely, who now added a few points of information. \"I should have said that the skull was not exposed as you now see it on the shelf. After I went up the side of the hill, I returned and landed on the ledge, and then I noticed the skull through the apertures formed by the stones now lying at the side.\"  \"That is evidence to my mind, that Walter knew nothing of the existence of the skull at the time he left the message, and yet, singular as it may seem, both the skull and Walter's message point to the same thing.\"  This announcement was certainly curious and interesting, and keyed up the listeners to a high pitch of expectation.     CHAPTER V  THE TRIP TO THE NEW ISLAND   Exciting as were the events alluded to in the last chapter, the boys insisted on taking Sutoto to the top of the peak. John and Blakely gathered up the fragments, and when the boys left they were busily engaged in making careful measurements of the stone and ledges.  It was not an easy task to gain the summit, but when they reached it, there was spread before them the most remarkable panorama. To the north they could see South River, the first stream they discovered when they came to the island.  They looked on it almost lovingly. \"If it were not for the mountain range to the north we could see clear to Cataract,\" said Harry.  \"The dear old place!\" exclaimed George. Sutoto smiled. He had been there, and he shared the views of the boys.  \"Let me have the glasses,\" shouted Harry, as he adjusted them and turned to the west. \"Unity,\" was the only thing he said, as he handed the glasses to Sutoto. The latter looked, and stepped back in surprise. George kept his eyes on Sutoto, as the latter bent forward in his eagerness to see the town which was now so plain to him, although more than fifty miles away.  George leisurely took the glasses, as Sutoto said slowly, and with proper emphasis, \"Wonderful! wonderful!\"  He turned the glasses to the southeast, hoping to catch a glimpse of the land of treasures, but they saw nothing but the wide open sea, calm and peaceful, and he wondered that it could ever be so angry and tempestuous as they had known it to be on two momentous occasions.  They remained there for a long time, and viewed every portion of the island. When they descended they took a route leading to the west, and when nearly at the bottom, heard the unmistakable sounds of voices below them. For a moment the boys were alarmed, but Sutoto set up a shout, his quick ears having detected the voices of their friends. It was the first caravan load of copper which they were taking from the great cave near the Illyas' village.  \"Glory! we are near the Illyas' village,\" said Harry, as he stumbled down the mountain side, and saw the train of men with the loads.  They would now do some more visiting. They must surely go over to the village where they captured the last of the hostile tribes. As they neared the village they were surprised to see Oma coming toward them. He greeted them like a monarch, and led them into the village.  \"I am glad to welcome you,\" he said. The boys were astounded at the words. This man, the most vindictive and bitter of all the tribesmen, had learned to speak, and showed by his actions that he was glad to welcome them.  But when they came to the village, the surprise of the boys was so great that they could hardly speak. Instead of filth and uncleanliness everywhere, they saw carefully attended lawns, and houses, instead of huts. The people came out and greeted them with laughter.  And then the boys recognized many of the men who had lived in Unity, and who had worked for them in the shops, and in the fields. The Chief then escorted them to the large building, the same one in which the Chief was captured by the boys, the year before.  What a change! Formerly the furniture in the room was one jumbled mass of débris, and the household arrangements were only such as savage conditions warranted. Now, the large interior had been cut up into rooms, and they were furnished with comfortable belongings.  The Chief saw the curiosity of the boys, and he read their thoughts. \"You wonder at the difference? Yes; it is a difference. We owe it to that wonderful Chief, and to you, and to John.\"  \"Yes; John will be here soon,\" said George.  \"I have seen him. He will be here. We are preparing a great feast for him,\" and the boys opened their eyes and smiled as they heard this announcement.  The people flocked about them, and the men who knew the boys were only too proud to be recognized by them. Thus they visited every nook and corner of the town, surprised and glad to see that the Chief had insisted on his people going to Unity and learning the ways of the white people.  There was a further reason why the coming of John and of Blake was a joyous event. Oma had been informed that the great copper mines were to be opened in the mountains, which would insure work for every one, and that they would be able to buy every sort of luxury and enjoy all the comforts of the white people.  Late that evening John and Blakely came accompanied by two hundred of the Illyas who had actually been engaged during the day in transporting copper from the cave to the hold of the _Wonder_.  The feast and the celebration that night in a village which, only a few months before, was of the most savage character, was, indeed, a marvel. Oma could"]]]
