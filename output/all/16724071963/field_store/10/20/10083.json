Instead of driving cautiously, Everard plunged along with all the hardihood of youth, bumping anyhow over ruts and stones. They were just beyond the brow of the hill when a loud bang, followed by a grinding sensation, announced the bad news that one of their tires had burst.  \"What beastly bad luck!\" lamented Everard, getting out to inspect the injured cover. \"It might have had the decency to keep up till we had reached civilization! Well, there's nothing for it but to put on the spare tire. I've helped Milner to do it before, so I can manage. It's a bother we left the spare wheel at home. I shall want some of you to help me, though.\"  Everard had indeed rendered some assistance to the chauffeur on various occasions, but it was quite another matter to perform the troublesome operation of changing the tire with only two girls and three young brothers to lend a hand. In their inexperienced enthusiasm, they did all the wrong things, very nearly nipped the tube, mislaid the tools, and pulled where they should have pushed. It was only after nearly an hour's work that Everard at last managed to get the business finished. The family, warm and excited, packed once more into the car.  \"Well, I hope we shall have no more troubles now!\" exclaimed Lilias, who was growing tired and longing for home and tea. \"What's the matter, Everard?\"  \"Matter! Why, she won't start, that's all!\"  Here was a predicament! Whether the bumping up the rough road had thrown some delicate piece of mechanism out of gear, or the waiting in the cold had cooled the engine, it was impossible to say, but nothing that Everard could do would induce the car to start. He examined everything which his rather limited knowledge of motorology suggested might be the cause of the stoppage, but with no result. After half an hour's tinkering, he was obliged ruefully to acknowledge himself utterly baffled.  They were indeed in an extremely awkward situation, stranded on a wild moor, probably sixty miles from home, and with the short winter's day closing rapidly in.  \"What _are_ we to do?\" gasped Lilias, half-crying.  \"We can't stay here all night!\"  \"Finish our prog and sleep in the car,\" suggested Roland.  \"No, no! We should be frozen before morning.\"  \"I think we'd better walk on while it's light enough to see,\" said Everard. \"We shall probably strike a highroad soon, and we'll stop some motorist, ask for a lift to the nearest town, and stay all night at a hotel.\"  \"But what about the car?\"  \"We must just leave her to her fate. There's nothing else for it. I don't suppose anybody will touch her up here. It can't be helped, any way.\"  \"Let's finish our prog before we set off!\" persisted Roland, opening the picnic basket.  The family was hungry again, so they readily set to work to dispose of the remains of their lunch. It might be a long time before they were within reach of their next meal, and they blessed Cook for having packed a plentiful supply. Everard would not let them linger for more than a few minutes.  \"Hurry up, you kids!\" he urged. \"We don't know how far we may have to go, and it will be getting dark soon. Thank goodness we shall be walking down hill, at any rate.\"  [Illustration: \"WHAT _ARE_ WE TO DO!\" GASPED LILIAS]  After whisking along in the car, \"Shanks's pony\" seemed a very slow mode of progress; their breakdown had happened in an out-of-the-way spot, and it was more than an hour before they reached a highroad. It was almost dark by that time, and matters seemed so desperate that Everard determined to hail the very first passing motorist who seemed to be able to help them. Fate brought along no handsome tourist car, but a rattling motor-lorry, the driver of which stopped in answer to their united shouts, and, after hearing of the difficulty they were in, consented to give them a lift to the town, five miles away, for which he was bound. Fortunately the lorry was empty, so the family thankfully climbed in, and squatted on the floor, while Everard sat in front with the driver.  It was not a very aristocratic mode of conveyance for the heir of Cheverley Chase, but Everard was in no mood to pick and choose just then, and would have accepted a seat in a coal truck if necessary. As for the younger ones, they enjoyed the fun of it. It was a very bumpy performance to sit on the floor of the jolting wagon, but at any rate infinitely preferable to walking.  Arrived in Bilstone, their cicerone drove them to a Commercial Hotel with whose landlady he had some acquaintance, and that good dame, after eyeing the party curiously, consented to make up beds for them for the night.  \"I've no private sitting-room to put you in, and I can't show these young ladies into the commercial room,\" she objected; \"but I'll have a fire lighted in one of the bedrooms, and you can all have some tea up there. Will that suit you?\"  Lilias and Dulcie, catching a glimpse through an open door of the company smoking in the commercial room, agreed thankfully, glad to find some safe haven to which they could beat a retreat.  \"I wonder what Cousin Clare would say?\" they asked each other.  It was indeed an urgent matter to send some news of their whereabouts to Cheverley Chase, where their absence must be causing much alarm. While the landlady, therefore, ordered the tea, Everard went out to the public telephone, asked for a trunk call, and rang up No. 169 Balderton. He could hear relief in the voice of old Winder, who answered the telephone. Everard was not anxious to enter into too many explanations, so he simply said that they had had a breakdown, told the name of the town and the hotel where they were staying, and suggested that Milner should come over next morning to the rescue. On hearing his Grandfather's voice, he promptly rang off. To-morrow would be quite time enough, so he felt, for giving the history of their adventure. The unpleasant interview might just as well be deferred, and he had no wish to listen to explosions of anger over the telephone.  Tea, tinned salmon, plum and apple jam, and very indifferent bedrooms were the best that the Commercial Hotel had to offer, but it was infinitely better than being benighted on the moor. In spite of lack of all toilet necessaries, the Ingletons slept peacefully, worn out with their long day in the fresh air. Milner, the chauffeur, must have made an early start, for he arrived at eleven o'clock next morning in the small car, armed with his master's instructions. He paid the hotel bill, chartered a taxi, in which he dispatched Lilias, Dulcie, Roland, Bevis and Clifford, straight for home, then, engaging a mechanic from a garage, and taking Everard as guide, he started up the hill in the pouring rain to find the abandoned car. It needed several hours' attention before it could be induced to start, and it was not until evening that he was able to place it safely back in the motor-house at Cheverley Chase.  Everard had expected his peppery grandfather to be angry, but he was quite unprepared for the intensity of the storm which burst over his head on his return.  \"Your insolence goes beyond all bounds!\" thundered Mr. Ingleton. \"To borrow my car without leave! And to take your sisters without a chaperon to a fifth-rate public-house! You deserve horsewhipping for it! You think yourself the young Squire, do you? And imagine you can do just what you like here? While I'm above ground I'll have you to know _I'm_ master, and nobody else in this place!\"  \"I can't see it was anything so out of the way to take the kids a run in the car, and I never meant to keep the girls out all night,\" replied Everard defiantly. He had a temper as well as his grandfather, and the pair had often been at loggerheads before.  \"Indeed! There are ways of making people see! You can just go a little too far sometimes!\" declared the old gentleman sarcastically. \"I've given orders that you don't take either car out again unless Milner is with you. So you understand?\"  \"I suppose I do,\" grunted Everard, turning sulkily away.  It was only a few days after this that Everard, Lilias, and Dulcie, returning home across the park from a walk in the woods, met Mr. Bowden, the family solicitor, who was riding down the drive from the Chase. He stopped his motor-bicycle and got off to speak to them. They knew him well, for he often came to the house to conduct their grandfather's business, and he was indeed quite a favorite with them all. He looked at Everard keenly when the first greetings were over.  \"Been getting yourself into considerable hot water just lately, haven't you?\" he remarked.  Everard colored and frowned, then burst forth.  \"Grandfather's quite too ridiculous! Why shouldn't I take out the car if I want to? I can drive as well as Milner! He behaved as if I were a kid! It's more than a fellow can stand sometimes! He likes to keep everything tight in his own hands; at his age it's time he began to stand aside a little and let _me_ look after things! I shall have to take charge of the whole property some day, I suppose!\"  Mr. Bowden was gazing at Everard with the noncommittal air often assumed by lawyers.  \"I wouldn't make too sure about that,\" he said slowly. \"I suppose you know your Uncle Tristram left a child? No! Well, he did, at any rate. I must hurry on now. I've an appointment to keep at my office. A happy New Year to you all. Good-by!\"  And, starting his engine, he was off before they had time to reply.  \"What does he mean?\" asked Lilias, watching the retreating bicycle. \"Uncle Tristram has been dead for thirteen years! We never seem to have heard anything about him!\"  \"What was that photo we saw on the study table?\" queried Dulcie. \"Don't you remember--the lady and the baby, and it had written on it: 'My wife and Leslie, from Tristram.'\"  \"I suppose it was Uncle Tristram's wife and child,\" replied Everard thoughtfully. \"He must have called the kid 'Leslie' after Grandfather. They"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21656"],["title","The Princess of the School (#4)"],["body","to have christened _me_ 'Leslie.' I can't think why they didn't.\"  \"Have we a cousin Leslie, then, whom we don't know?\"  \"I suppose we must have, somewhere!\"  \"How fearfully thrilling!\"  \"Um! I don't know that it's thrilling at all. It's the first I've heard of it until to-day. I wish our father had been the eldest son, instead of Uncle Tristram!\"  \"Why? What does it matter?\"  \"It may matter more than you think. You're a silly little goose, Dulcie, and, as I often tell you, you never see farther than the end of your own nose. Surely, after all these years, though, Grandfather _must_----\"  \"Must what?\" asked Lilias curiously.  \"Never you mind! Girls can't know everything!\" snapped Everard, walking on in front of his sisters with a look of unwonted worry upon his usually careless and handsome young face.     CHAPTER III  A Valentine Party   Chilcombe Hall, where Lilias and Dulcie had been boarders for the last two years, was an exceedingly nice school. It stood on a hill-side well raised above the river, and behind it there was a little wood where bulbs had been naturalized, and where, in their season, you might find clumps of pure white snowdrops, sheets of glorious daffodils, and later on lovely masses of the lily of the valley. In the garden all kinds of sweet things seemed to be blooming the whole year round. Golden aconite buds opened with the January term, and in a wild patch above the rockery the delicious heliotrope-scented _Petasites fragrans_ blossomed to tempt the bees which an hour's sunshine would bring forth from the hives, scarlet _Pyrus japanica_ was trained along the wall under the front windows, and early flowering cherry and almond blossoms made delicate pink patches of color long before leaves were showing on the trees.  Beautiful surroundings in a school can be quite as important a part of our education as the textbooks through which we toil. We are made up of body, mind, and spirit, and the developing soul needs satisfying as much as the physical or mental part of us. Long years afterwards, though we utterly forget the lessons we may have learnt as children, we can still vividly recall the effect of the afternoon sun streaming through the fuchsia bush outside the open French window where we sat conning those unremembered tasks. The lovely things of nature, assimilated half unconsciously when we are young, equip us with a purity of heart and a refinement of taste that should safeguard us later, and keep our thoughts at a lofty level.  The \"beauty cult\" was a decided feature of Chilcombe Hall. Miss Walters was extremely artistic; she painted well in water-colors and had exquisite taste. Many of the charming decorations in the house had been done by herself; she had designed and stencilled the frieze of drooping clusters of wistaria that decorated the dining-hall wall; the framed landscapes in the drawing-room were her own work, and she herself always superintended the arrangement of the bowls of flowers that gave such brightness to the schoolrooms.  Her twenty pupils had on the whole a decidedly pleasant time. There were just enough of them to develop the community spirit, but not too many to obliterate the individual, or, as Ida Spenser put it: \"You can get up a play, or a dance, or any other sort of fun, and yet we all know each other like a kind of big family.\"  \"Divided up into small families according to bedrooms!\" added Hester Wilson.  The bedrooms at Chilcombe Hall were rather a speciality. They were large, and were furnished partly as studies, and girls had their own bookcases, knick-knacks, and pretty things there. As the house was provided with central heating, they were warmed, and a certain amount of preparation was done in them each afternoon. Miss Walters' artistic faculty had decorated them in schemes of various colors, so that they were known respectively as The Rose, The Gold, The Green, The Brown, and The Blue Bedrooms. Lilias and Dulcie Ingleton, Gowan Barbour, and Bertha Chesters, who occupied the last-named, considered it quite the choicest of all. They had each made important contributions to its furniture, had clubbed together to buy a Liberty table-cloth, had provided vases in lovely shades of turquoise blue, and had worked toilet-mats, nightdress cases and other accessories to accord with the prevailing tone. \"The Blue Grotto,\" as they named their dormitory, certainly had points over rival bedrooms, for it looked down the garden towards the river, and had the best view of the sunset. Moreover, it was at the very end of the corridor, so that sudden outbursts of laughter did not meet the ears of Miss Hardy quite so easily as from the Rose or the Brown room.  The work of the spring term had been in full swing for nearly a month, when Gowan Barbour, looking at the calendar--hand-painted, with blue cranesbill geraniums--suddenly discovered that next morning would be the festival of St. Valentine.  \"Could anything be better?\" she exulted. \"We've won the record for tidiness three weeks running, so we're entitled to a special indulgence. I vote we ask to bring tea up here, and have a Valentine party. Don't you think it would be rather scrumptious? I've all sorts of ideas in my head.\"  \"Topping!\" agreed Dulcie, pausing in the act of tying her hair ribbon to consider the important question, \"specially if we could get Miss Walters to let us send to Glazebrook for a few cakes. I believe she would, if we wheedled!\"  \"What about visitors?\" asked Lilias. \"It would be much more of a party if we had a few of the others in.\"  \"We don't want a crowd, or we might as well be in the dining-hall,\" objected Bertha.  \"Well, of course we shouldn't ask the whole school, naturally, but perhaps just Noreen and Phillida!\"  \"We must get at the soft spot in Miss Walters' heart,\" decided Gowan. \"Pick a bunch of early violets if you can find them, lay them on her study table, talk about flowers and nature for a little while, then ask if we may have a quiet little party in our bedroom to-morrow afternoon, with cakes at our own expense.\"  \"Quiet?\" queried Lilias.  \"Well, of course you couldn't call it rowdy, could you? We'll send you to do the asking. Those dimples of yours generally get what you want, and on the whole I think you're the pattern one of us, and the most likely to be listened to.\"  Tea at Chilcombe Hall was a quite informal meal. It partook, indeed more of the nature of a canteen. The urns were what the girls called \"on tap\" from four to four-thirty, and during summer any one might take cup, saucer, and plate into the garden, provided she duly brought them back afterwards to the dining-hall. Special permission for a bedroom feast was therefore not very difficult to obtain, and Lilias returned from her interview in the study with her dimples conspicuously in evidence.  \"Well?\" asked the interested circle in the Blue bedroom.  \"Sweet as honey!\" reported Lilias. \"She said 'Certainly, my dear!' We may each ask one friend, and we may spend two shillings amongst us on cakes, if we give the money and the list of what we want to Jones this afternoon, because he's going into Glazebrook first thing to-morrow morning.\"  \"Only two shillings!\" commented Gowan.  \"It will go no way!\" pouted Bertha.  \"Well, I can't help it. Miss Walters said 'Two shillings' most emphatically.\"  \"You might have stuck out for more! Those iced cakes are always half a crown!\"  \"I didn't dare to stick out for anything. I was so afraid she'd change her mind, and say 'There's good plain home-made cake with your schoolroom tea, and you must be content with that,' like she did to Nona and Muriel.\"  \"We could get twelve twopenny cakes for two shillings,\" calculated Dulcie; \"but if there are eight of us, that's only one and a half apiece.\"  \"Best get eight twopenny iced cakes, and eight penny buns,\" suggested Bertha, taking pencil and paper to write the important order.  \"Right-o! Only be sure you put _pink_ iced cakes, they are so much the nicest.\"  \"Whom shall we ask? It won't be much of a beano on two shillings. Still, they'll be keen on coming, I expect.\"  Noreen, Phillida, Prissie, and Edith, the four finally selected favorites, accepted the invitation with alacrity. Bedroom tea-parties were indulgences only given to winners of three weeks' dormitory records, so the less fortunate occupants of the Brown and Rose rooms were really profiting by the tidiness of their hostesses. The Blue Grotto was placed in apple-pie order on the afternoon of the fourteenth of February. A white hemstitched cloth and a bowl of snowdrops adorned the center table, and the cakes were set out on paper doilies. Both hostesses and guests were in the dining-hall by four o'clock, awaiting the appearance of the urns, and each bore her cup of tea and a portion of bread and butter and scones upstairs with her.  It was a jolly party round the square table, and if the cakes were not too plentiful, they were at least voted delicious. The girls carried down the cups when they had finished, shook the table-cloth out of the window, carefully collected crumbs from the floor, so as to preserve their record for neatness, then gathered round the table again for an hour's fun before the bell should ring for prep.  \"It's a Valentine party, and I've got a ripping idea,\" said Gowan. \"We'll put our names on pieces of paper, fold them up, shuffle them and draw them; then each of us must write a valentine to the one we've drawn. We'll shuffle these, and one of us must read them all out. Then we must each guess who's written our valentines.\"  \"Sounds rather brainy, doesn't it?\" objected Noreen. \"I don't think I'm any hand at poetry!\"  \"Oh! you can make up something if you try. Valentines are generally doggerel.\"  \"Need it be quite original?\" asked Edith.  \"Well, if you really _can't_ compose anything, we'll allow quotations.\"  \"Cracker mottoes?\" suggested Dulcie.  \"Exactly. They're just about in the right style.\"  \"Are you all getting into a sentimental vein?\" giggled"]]]
