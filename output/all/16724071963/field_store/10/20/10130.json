The greater part of the old, or, as it is styled, the Moorish town, remains almost exactly the same at the present time that it was at the time of which our tale treats.  It occupied the face of a steep hill, and was built in the form of a triangle, the apex being a fort, or \"casba,\" near the summit of the hill.  The base was a street of oriental houses upwards of half a mile in extent, beyond which the sea-wall, well lined with batteries, rose directly from the beach, and was washed by the spray in every breeze.  All the houses facing the sea have now been taken down, and their places are occupied by wide handsome streets of French buildings; the beach and the site of the old wall being occupied by splendid quays, wharves, and terraces.  The houses of the Moorish town were square white-washed blocks, built so close to each other that most of the streets were mere lanes, not more than from six to ten feet wide.  No windows worthy of the name garnished the dead white walls of these houses, whose light sprang in reality from within, each house being in the form of a square of building surrounding a central court, which at the top was open to the weather.  The real windows of the houses looked into the courts, which, however, were by no means dismal.  They had fountains in the midst of them, which sent up a perpetual--and, in such a climate, grateful--sound of trickling water; while in their corners and elsewhere boxes of earth enabled banana-trees, and palms, and various creepers, to convert the little spots into delightful, though miniature, gardens.  Such windows as opened outwards were mere loop-holes, not much more than a foot square-- many of them less,--the larger of them being always strongly grated. Most of these houses projected beyond their basement storeys, thus rendering the open space above narrower than the streets below, and in many cases the walls absolutely met, and converted the streets into tunnels.  Strange wooden props, seemingly insufficient for their duty, upheld these projecting upper storeys, and gave a peculiarly un-European character to the streets,--a character which became still more perplexing to the stranger when he observed here and there, in places where architecture had scarcely space or light to be seen, fountains of the most elegant design and workmanship; doorways of white marble, most elaborately and beautifully carved; and entrance-halls that resembled courts of the Alhambra in miniature.  When one first sees such things they induce surprise, but the surprise evaporates when we reflect that these pirates had at their command the services of thousands of slaves, many of whom represented the artistic talent of the civilised world.  Passing rapidly along these narrow streets, and bending his tall form when he came to low archways, Bacri at length emerged on the chief \"high street\" of the town, which, entering at the north, or Bab-el-Oued gate, completely traversed the city under that name as far as the Dey's palace, where it changed its name to Bab-Azoun, and terminated at the south gate of the same name.  In this street was the Bagnio, already mentioned as being the prison of the government slaves.  Here Bacri paused, drew a glittering coin from his pocket, and knocked at a strong oaken door.  A janissary opened, and roughly demanded his business, but changed his tone at once and gave the Jew admission, on receiving the coin.  Passing though a lobby, whose marble pillars were sadly broken and disfigured, the Jew entered a courtyard, open to the sky, around which were a number of recesses or cells.  In these the unhappy slaves sat huddled together.  They were not cold, for it was summer; but their misery and want of space probably induced them to cling closely to each other.  The place had once been a bathing establishment, and an old fountain still gurgled in the centre of the court; but its drains had been choked long ago, and the waters had overflowed, to find exit as they best might, rendering the floor a damp and uncomfortable residence for scorpions, centipedes, and other repulsive insects.  The slaves received only two small rolls of black bread as their rations at the close of each day, and they were too eagerly engaged in devouring these to pay much regard to their visitor.  Looking carefully round, the Jew at length discovered the objects of his search,--Francisco, Lucien, and Mariano Rimini.  The two first were seated side by side, eating their meagre meal.  Mariano lay near them, heavily laden with irons, and also endeavouring to eat.  \"Friends,\" said Bacri, approaching them.  \"Villain!\" cried Mariano, starting up into a reclining attitude, despite the agony that the act occasioned, and fixing his eyes on the Jew.  \"You do me injustice, young man,\" said Bacri, seating himself on the basement of a pillar.  \"It may be that he does you injustice,\" said Lucien sternly, \"nevertheless we have all of us good reason to believe that you are a friend of the pirate Hassan, and no friend of ours.\"  \"Whether friend or foe, say thy say, man, and be gone,\" cried the bluff Francisco, whose spirit suffered even more than his body from the indignities to which he had been subjected that day.  \"Listen, then,\" said Bacri impressively.  \"You know my name and nation, but you do not know that I am the chief of the Jews in this city of devils.  I and my people are regarded by these followers of Mohammed as worse than the dogs in their streets, yet, while they treat us with the utmost indignity, they know that we are good traders, and as such bring riches within their walls.  I have power--the power of wealth--to help you at a pinch; indeed I _have_ helped you, for it was only by means of a promise of gold that I induced Sidi Hassan to spare your lives when his men were bent on taking them.  But that is not what I came to tell you to-night.  I came to say that the poor captive girls with whom you voyaged to this place are for the present out of danger.\"  \"Say you so?\" exclaimed Mariano eagerly.  \"How can that be?  Did I not see Angela led to the slave-market this very afternoon?\"  \"You did, and I purchased her for the purpose of protecting her.  She is now in my house.  Her sister and the infant have been sent as a temporary gift or loan to the British consul, under whose care she is safe _for the present_.  But be not too sanguine,\" added Bacri, seeing that Mariano's countenance brightened; \"the whim of the Dey, or a change of government, which latter is common enough here, may totally alter the state of affairs.  If the Dey willed it, I could not hold anything that belongs to me for an hour.  They call us dogs, and treat us as such.\"  \"They are themselves dogs!\" cried Mariano indignantly.  \"Christians have called us by the same name,\" returned the Jew calmly, \"thereby proving the falsity of their own faith.\"  \"Say not so!\" cried Lucien with animation.  \"Many, calling themselves Christians, have undoubtedly treated your race ill, but those who really love the Lord Jesus cannot help respecting the people from whom Himself sprang.  I side not with those who disgrace themselves by vilifying the Jews.\"  Lucien extended his hand as he spoke, and Bacri grasped it kindly.  \"Bah! you are fools; all of you arrant idiots!\" cried a wild-looking ragged man in the neighbouring cell, starting up and glaring at them as he clenched his fists.  \"What avails Christianity, or Judaism, or anything else here?  'Tis a world of fiends!--ha, ha! murderers, tormentors, hypocrites,--ha! ha!\"  Here the man gave vent to a burst of wild ferocious laughter, so loud that even the careless and callous warder was disturbed, and rattled his keys as if about to enter.  The sound appeared to send a chill to the heart of the captive; an expression of terror overspread his thin haggard features, and he shrunk together as he retired quickly to the remotest corner of his cell.  \"A maniac, I fear,\" said Francisco in a low tone, observing that the Jew regarded him with a look of pity.  \"No, not quite mad,\" replied Bacri in the same low tone, \"but sometimes very near it, I think.  Poor man, I know him well.  He has been fifteen years a prisoner in Algiers.  When first brought here he was as fine a specimen of a Genoese youth as I ever saw.  His name is Lorenzo Benoni. He was captured with his wife and two children, all of whom died before the first year was out.  Of course, although in the same city, he was never again permitted to see wife or children.  He was very dangerous at first, attacking and nearly killing his guards whenever he got a chance, and frequently attempting to take his own life, so that they were obliged to make him work constantly in heavy irons, and, I need scarcely add, bastinadoed and tortured him until his body became a mass of bruises from head to foot.  They subdued him, in the course of years, to a condition of callous and brutal indifference to everything, and at last his great strength began to give way.  He is now considered incapable of doing much injury to any one, and seems almost tamed.  The Turks think that this has been brought about by sickness and starvation; it may be partly so, but I cannot help thinking that, despite the contempt which, in a sudden burst of passion, he poured on it just now, religion has something to do with it, for I have noticed a considerable change in him since he began to listen to the voice of an old man who has been a true friend of the poor slaves since long before I came here. The old man professes, at least he teaches, your religion; but I know not to what sect he belongs.  Indeed, I think he belongs to none.  This, however, am I sure of, that he holds equally by our Scriptures and your Testament as being the whole Word of God.\"  The three captives listened to this narration with sinking hearts, for it opened up a glimpse of the terrible and hopeless future that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21692"],["title","The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale (#8)"],["body","before themselves, so that for some time they sat gazing in silence at their visitor, and at the miserable beings who were devouring the last crumbs of their black bread around them.  \"I came to see you,\" continued Bacri, \"partly to assure you of the comparative safety of the girls who interested us all so much on board the vessel of Sidi Hassan, and partly to say that I will do what lies in my power to alleviate your sad condition.  With Lucien's education and knowledge of languages, it may be possible to get him into the immediate service of the Dey, in which case he will be able to aid his father and brother.\"  \"Have you, then, much influence with the Dey?\" asked Francisco.  \"None,\" replied the Jew, with a sad smile.  \"I have already told you that the pirates detest us; that we are tolerated only because of our money-making powers, and the ease with which they can bleed us when they want gold.  But I have some influence with others in the city who have power to move the Dey.  There is one thing, however,\" here the Jew glanced pointedly at Mariano, \"in regard to which I would give you most earnest counsel, namely, that you should at once dismiss all idea of rebellion.  It will be utterly unavailing.  You may, like the caged lion, if you will, dash yourselves to death against your prison bars, but you cannot break them.  Countless thousands of bold and brave spirits have attempted this plan, with no good result, in time past. The Turks are well acquainted with and quite prepared for it.  Your only chance of mitigating the woes of your condition lies in submission.\"  \"It were better and nobler to die than to submit,\" said Mariano gloomily.  \"It were better and nobler to bow to the will of the Almighty than to commit suicide,\" retorted Bacri, somewhat sternly.  \"It is selfishness and pride which induces us to seek deliverance from sorrow and suffering in death.  There are men who have thought that truest nobility lay in choosing a life in the midst of suffering and woe for the purpose of alleviating it, and who have acted on their opinion.  This lesson, however, is not so frequently learnt by us through precept as in the school of sorrow.\"  Mariano felt abashed, yet at the same time rather nettled.  \"Truly, then,\" he said, with a glance at his blood-stained shirt, \"it seems to me that I have at all events begun my lesson in the right school.  However, I believe thou art right, Bacri, and I bear thee no ill-will for the rap thou didst bestow on my skull, which, luckily, is a thick one, else thy ponderous fist had split it from the cranium to the chin.\"  \"We had misjudged you, Bacri,\" said Francisco, extending his hand, as the Jew rose to depart.  \"We will lay your advice to heart; and we thank you, meanwhile, for coming to see us in this foul den, which I dislike less because of moisture and dirt--these being familiar to me--than because of the lively reptiles which hold their nightly revels in it.\"  There was mingled humour and bitterness in Francisco's tone, as he uttered this sentence, which he concluded with a heavy sigh. Immediately after, the rusty bolts of their prison-door grated harshly on their ears, and they listened sadly to the retreating footsteps of one whom they now esteemed their only friend, as they died away in the distance.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  SOME NEW CHARACTERS WALK, GLIDE, AND FURIOUSLY GALLOP INTO THE TALE, AND OTHERWISE INTRODUCE THEMSELVES TO NOTICE.  In the interior court of a beautiful Moorish villa not far from the city, sat Mrs Langley, wife of Colonel Langley, British consul at the \"Court\" of Algiers.  The lady of whom we write was unusually romantic, for her romance consisted of a deep undercurrent of powerful but quiet enthusiasm, with a pretty strong surface-flow of common-sense.  Her husband was a man of noble mind and commanding presence--a magnificent representative John Bull, with the polish of a courtier and the principles of a Christian; one who had been wisely chosen to fill a very disagreeable post, full of responsibility and danger.  On a stool at the feet of Mrs Langley sat a sunny second edition of herself, about eight years of age, named Agnes.  In the cradle which Agnes had formerly occupied reposed a remarkably plump and dimpled representative of the Colonel.  When respectfully addressed he was called Jim, but he was more familiarly known as Baby.  A small negress from beyond the Zahara, and blacker than any coal, rocked Jim violently.  For this--not the rocking, but the violence--she had been unavailingly rebuked by Mrs Langley, until that lady's heart had nearly lost all hope.  \"There--you have done it again, Zubby,\" said Mrs Langley, referring to a push that well-nigh rolled Master Jim, (as a sea-captain once said), out at the starboard side of the cradle.  Zubby confessed her guilt, by looking abashed--and what a solemn look an abashed one is in a negress with very large eyes!--as well as by rocking more gently.  Agnes vented a sudden little laugh at the expression of Zubby's face; and, the door opening at that moment, Colonel Langley entered the court, and sat down beside his wife under the giant leaves of a small banana-tree, whose life was drawn from a boxful of earth about three feet square.  \"My dear,\" said the Colonel, \"I have two rather amusing things to lay before you this evening.  One is a gift from the Dey, the other is a letter.  Which will you have first?\"  \"The gift, of course,\" replied the lady.  \"Let her come in, Ali,\" called the Colonel to his interpreter, who stood in the passage outside.  Rais Ali, a Moor clad in the usual Turkish garb, but with a red fez or skull-cap on his head instead of a turban, threw open the door leading out of the court, and ushered in poor Paulina Ruffini with her child.  \"Is _this_ the Dey's gift?\" asked the astonished lady, rising hurriedly.  \"It is; at least she is lent to us, and we are bound to accept her.-- Address her in French, my dear; she does not understand English.  In fact, you'd better take her to your own room and have a talk.\"  Mrs Langley addressed to the poor captive a few reassuring words, and led her away, leaving the Colonel to amuse himself with Agnes.  \"What has she been sent to us for?\" asked Agnes.  \"To be a serv--a companion to you and baby, my pet.\"  \"That was kind of the Dey, wasn't it?\" said the child.  \"Well--ye-es; oh yes, doubtless, it was very kind of him,\" replied the Colonel.  We fear that the Colonel did not fully appreciate the kindness that resulted in the gift either of Paulina Ruffini as his servant, or of Sidi Hassan as his attendant, for he saw clearly that the former was unaccustomed to menial work, and he knew that Sidi Hassan was a turbulent member of the community.  However, being a man of prompt action, and knowing that it was of the utmost importance that he should stand well in the good graces of the Dey, he resolved to receive Paulina into his establishment as governess of the nursery and companion to his wife, and to leave Sidi Hassan very much to the freedom of his own will, so long as that will did not interfere with the interests of the consulate.  On the return of his wife he listened to her pathetic account of Paulina's sad history, and then produced the letter to which he had referred on first entering.  \"This letter necessitates my riding into town immediately.  It is a curious document in its way, therefore lend me your ear.\"  Opening it he began to read.  We give it _verbatim et literatim_:--    \"_To the brittish Cownsul algeers_.    \"7 _teenth Jully_, 18--    \"Sur i'm an irishman an a sailer an recked on the cost of boogia wid   six of me messmaits hoo are wel an arty tho too was drowndid on landin   an wan wos spiflikated be the moors which are born divls an no   mistaik.  I rite to say that weer starvin but the Kaid as they cals   the guvner Here says heel take a ransum for us of 150 spanish dolars   the Kaid has past his word in yoor name to the moors for that sum or   theyd hav spiflikate us too.  I hope yer onor has as much to spair in   yer pokit, an will luke alive wid it, for if yoo don't its all up wid   me mesmaits inkloodin yoor onors obedent humbil servint to comand ted   flagan.\"  \"Well, I hope, with poor Flaggan,\" said Mrs Langley laughingly, \"that you _have_ as much to spare in your `pokit,' for if not, it is plain that the poor fellows will be led into captivity.\"  \"I would readily advance a larger sum for so good an end,\" replied the consul, folding the letter.  \"I shall at once ride into town to make arrangements, and as it is so late, will pass the night in our town house.  I shall send our new attendant, Sidi Hassan, on this mission, and leave you for the night under the guardianship of Rais Ali.\"  The consul left immediately, and next morning Sidi Hassan set out for Bugia with the necessary ransom.  In regard to this we need say nothing more than that he accomplished his purpose, paid the ransom, and received the seven British seamen, accompanied by whom he commenced the return journey, he and his men riding, and driving the sailors on foot before them as though they had been criminals.  On the way, however, they were attacked, not far from Algiers, by a body of predatory Arabs from the Jurjura mountains.  These bold villains, at the very first onset, killed more than half of the Turkish escort, and put the rest to flight.  Six of the sailors they captured and carried off, but Ted Flaggan, who was an exceedingly active as well as powerful man, proved himself more than a match for them all. During the melee he managed to throw himself in the way of one of the best-mounted among the Arabs, who instantly charged him, but Ted sprang aside and let him pass, ducking low to avoid a cut from his curved sword.  Before he could turn, the Irishman ran close to his side, seized him by the burnous, at the same time grasping his bridle, and pulled him out of the saddle with such sudden violence that he fell headlong to the ground, where he lay"]]]
