Ballantyne.  ________________________________________________________________________  Robert Michael Ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894.  He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, and in 1841 he became a clerk with the Hudson Bay Company, working at the Red River Settlement in Northen Canada until 1847, arriving back in Edinburgh in 1848.  The letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life, and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters.  Three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade, \"The Young Fur Traders\", \"Ungava\", \"The Hudson Bay Company\", and were based on his experiences with the HBC.  In this period he also wrote \"The Coral island\" and \"Martin Rattler\", both of these taking place in places never visited by Ballantyne.  Having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books, he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about.  With these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers.  He researched the Cornish Mines, the London Fire Brigade, the Postal Service, the Railways, the laying down of submarine telegraph cables, the construction of light-houses, the light-ship service, the life- boat service, South Africa, Norway, the North Sea fishing fleet, ballooning, deep-sea diving, Algiers, and many more, experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time, and he lived as they lived.  He was a very true-to-life author, depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail.  His young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books, and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen, sometimes four in a year, all very good reading.  The rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life, but the quality never failed.  He published over ninety books under his own name, and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym \"Comus\".  For today's taste his books are perhaps a little too religious, and what we would nowadays call \"pi\".  In part that was the way people wrote in those days, but more important was the fact that in his days at the Red River Settlement, in the wilds of Canada, he had been a little dissolute, and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave, as he felt he had been.  Some of his books were quite short, little over 100 pages.  These books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents, having less pocket-money.  These books are particularly well-written and researched, because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money.  They were published as six series, three books in each series.  For instance one of these series is \"On the Coast\", which includes \"Saved by the Lifeboat\".  \"The Red Man's Revenge\" is very authoritatively written, because its setting is the Red River, where Ballantyne had spent all those years in his youth.  As so often with Ballantyne's books there are the threads of two stories running throughout.  One of these, occupying the last two-thirds of the book, concerns the Red River flood of May 1826, when the river rose fourteen feet over a largely level plain, causing much loss and annoyance to the settlers in that region, though the loss of only one life.  The other thread concerns the kidnapping of a young white child in revenge for a fancied insult offered to a Red Indian, Petanawaquat. They are pursued by the boy's older brother and some other settlers, but not found.  They return only when Petanawaquat has a change of heart, after meditating some time on the fact that Jesus Christ gave up His life to save the souls of those who considered themselves His enemies.  There are various acutely observed actions, such as a buffalo hunt, various fights with bears, the tracking methods used by the pursuers, foiled only eventually when there is a prairie fire.  We learn at this point what to do when a prairie fire is coming straight at you, and there appears to be no escape.  There are various canoeing incidents, and indeed much of the action could not occur without the canoe.

A TALE OF THE RED RIVER FLOOD.  OPENS THE BALL.  If ever there was a man who possessed a gem in the form of a daughter of nineteen, that man was Samuel Ravenshaw; and if ever there was a girl who owned a bluff, jovial, fiery, hot-tempered, irascible old father, that girl was Elsie Ravenshaw.  Although a gem, Elsie was exceedingly imperfect.  Had she been the reverse she would not have been worth writing about.  Old Ravenshaw, as his familiars styled him, was a settler, if we may use such a term in reference to one who was, perhaps, among the most unsettled of men.  He had settled with his family on the banks of the Red River.  The colony on that river is now one of the frontier towns of Canada.  At the time we write of, it was a mere oasis in the desert, not even an offshoot of civilisation, for it owed its existence chiefly to the fact that retiring servants of the Hudson's Bay Fur Company congregated there to spend the evening of life, far beyond the Canadian boundary, in the heart of that great wilderness where they had spent their working days, and on the borders of that grand prairie where the red man and the buffalo roamed at will, and the conventionalities of civilised life troubled them not.  To this haven of rest Samuel Ravenshaw had retired, after spending an active life in the service of the fur-traders, somewhat stiffened in the joints by age and a rough career, and a good deal soured in disposition because of promotion having, as he thought, been too long deferred.  Besides Elsie, old Ravenshaw possessed some other gems of inferior lustre.  His wife Maggie, a stout, well-favoured lady, with an insufficient intellect and unbounded good humour, was of considerable intrinsic value, but highly unpolished.  His second daughter, Cora, was a thin slip of sixteen years, like her mother in some respects--pretty, attractive, and disposed to take life easily.  His eldest son, Victor, a well-grown lad of fourteen, was a rough diamond, if a diamond at all, with a soul centred on sport.  His second son, Anthony, between five and six, was large and robust, like his father.  Not having been polished at that time, it is hard to say what sort of gem Tony was.  When engaged in mischief--his besetting foible--his eyes shone like carbuncles with unholy light.  He was the plague of the family.  Of course, therefore, he was the beloved of his parents.  Such were the chief inmates of Willow Creek, as old Ravenshaw styled his house and property.  It was midwinter.  The owner of Willow Creek stood at his parlour window, smoking and gazing.  There was not much to look at, for snow had overwhelmed and buried the landscape, fringed every twig of the willows, and obliterated the frozen river.  Elsie was seated by the stove, embroidering a pair of moccasins.  \"Victor is bringing down some of the lads to shoot to-day, father,\" she said, casting a furtive glance at her sire.  \"Humph! that boy does nothing but shoot,\" growled the old man, who was a giant in body if not in spirit.  \"Who all is he bringing?\"  \"There's John Flett, and David Mowat, and Sam Hayes, and Herr Winklemann, and Ian Macdonald, and Louis Lambert--all the best shots, I suppose,\" said Elsie, bending over her work.  \"The best shots!\" cried Mr Ravenshaw, turning from the window with a sarcastic laugh.  \"Louis Lambert, indeed, and Winklemann are crack shots, and John Flett is not bad, but the others are poor hands.  Mowat can only shoot straight with a crooked gun, and as for that half-cracked schoolmaster, Jan Macdonald, he would miss a barn door at fifty paces unless he were to shut his eyes and fire at random, in which case he'd have some chance--\"  \"Here they is; the shooters is comin'.  Hooray!\" shouted Master Anthony Ravenshaw, as he burst into the room with a scalping-knife in one hand and a wooden gun in the other.  \"An' I's goin' to shoot too, daddy!\"  \"So you are, Tony, my boy!\" cried the old trader, catching up the pride of his heart in his strong arms and tossing him towards the ceiling. \"You shall shoot before long with a real gun.\"  Tony knocked the pipe out of his father's mouth, and was proceeding to operate on his half-bald head with the scalping-knife, when Cora, who entered the room at the moment, sprang forward and wrenched the weapon from his grasp.  \"We'll give them dinner after the shooting is over, shan't we, father?\" asked Cora.  \"Of course, my dear, of course,\" replied the hospitable old gentleman, giving the pride of his heart a sounding kiss as he put him down.  \"Set your mother to work on a pie, and get Miss Trim to help you with a lot of those cakes you make so famously.\"  As he spoke there was a sudden clattering in the porch.  The young men were taking off their snow-shoes and stamping the snow from off their leggings and moccasined feet.  \"Here we are, father!\" cried a bright, sturdy youth, as he ushered in his followers.  \"Of course Elsie has prepared you for our sudden invasion.  The fact is that we got up the match on the spur of the moment, because I found that Ian had a holiday.\"  \"No explanation required, Victor.  Glad to see you all, boys.  Sit down,\" said Mr Ravenshaw, shaking hands all round.  The youths who were thus heartily welcomed presented a fine manly appearance.  They were clad in the capotes, leggings, fur caps, moccasins, and fingerless mittens usually worn by the men of the settlement in winter.  That tall handsome fellow, with the curly black hair and flashing eyes, who bears himself so confidently as he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21697"],["title","The Red Man's Revenge: A Tale of The Red River Flood (#1)"],["body","the sisters, is Louis Lambert.  The thickset youth behind him, with the shock of flaxen hair and imperceptible moustache, is Herr Winklemann, a German farmer's son, and a famed buffalo-hunter.  The ungainly man, of twenty-four apparently--or thereabouts--with the plain but kindly face, and the frame nearly as strong as that of the host himself, is Ian Macdonald. In appearance he is a rugged backwoodsman.  In reality he is the schoolmaster of that part of the widely-scattered colony.  The invitation to sit down was not accepted.  Daylight was short-lived in those regions at that season of the year.  They sallied forth to the work in hand.  \"You've had the target put up, Cora?\" asked Victor, as he went out.  \"Yes, in the old place.\"  \"Where is Tony?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Cora, looking round.  \"He was here just now, trying to scalp father.\"  \"You'll find him at the target before you, no doubt,\" said Elsie, putting away her moccasins as she rose to aid in the household preparations.  The target was placed against the bank of the river, so that the bullets might find a safe retreat.  The competitors stood at about a hundred yards' distance in front of it.  The weapons used were single-barrelled smooth-bores, with flint locks.  Percussion locks had not at that time come into fashion, and long ranges had not yet been dreamed of.  \"Come, open the ball, Lambert,\" said Victor.  The handsome youth at once stepped forward, and old Mr Ravenshaw watched him with an approving smile as he took aim.  Puff! went the powder in the pan, but no sound followed save the peal of laughter with which the miss-fire was greeted.  The touch-hole was pricked, and next time the ball sped to its mark.  It hit the target two inches above the bull's-eye.  The \"well done\" with which the shot was hailed was cut short by an appalling yell, and little Tony was seen to tumble from behind the target.  Rolling head over heels, he curled himself round in agony, sprang up with a spasmodic bound, dropped upon his haunches, turned over a complete somersault, fell on his back with a fearful shriek, and lay dead upon the snow!  The whole party rushed in consternation towards the boy, but before they had reached him he leaped up and burst into a fit of gleeful laughter, which ended in a cheer and a savage war-whoop as he scampered up the track which led to the house, and disappeared over the brow of the river's bank.  \"The imp was joking!\" exclaimed Mr Ravenshaw, as he stopped and wiped the cold perspiration from his brow.  At that moment a Red Indian appeared on the scene, in his blanket robe, paint, and feathers.  Attracted by the shot, he had come to look on. Now, the old fur-trader's nerves had received a tremendous shock, and the practical jest which the pride of his heart had perpetrated had roused the irascibility of his nature, so that an explosion became unavoidable.  In these circumstances the arrival of the Indian seemed opportune, for the old gentleman knew that this particular savage was a chief, and had visited the colony for the purpose of making inquiries into the new religion reported to be taught by certain white men in black garments; and Mr Ravenshaw, besides having very little regard for missionaries, had a very strong contempt for those Indians who became their disciples.  He therefore relieved himself on the red man.  \"What do you want here, Petawanaquat?\" he demanded sternly, in the language of the Indian.  \"The Little Wolf,\" replied the Indian, referring to himself, for such was the interpretation of his name, \"wishes to see how his white brothers shoot.\"  \"Let the Little Wolf put his tail between his legs and be gone,\" cried the angry old man.  \"He is not wanted here.  Come, be off!\"  The chief looked straight in the eyes of the trader with a dark scowl, then, turning slowly on his heel, stalked solemnly away.  There was an irrepressible laugh at this episode as the group of marksmen returned to their former position.  Mr Ravenshaw, however, soon left them and returned home.  Here he found Miss Trim in a state of considerable agitation; she had just encountered the redskin!  Miss Trim was a poor relation of Mrs Ravenshaw.  She had been invited by her brother-in-law to leave England and come to Red River to act as governess to Tony and assistant-companion in the family.  She had arrived that autumn in company with a piano, on which she was expected to exercise Elsie and Cora.  Petawanaquat, being the first \"really wild and painted savage\" she had seen, made a deep impression on her.  \"Oh, Mr Ravenshaw, I have seen _such_ an object in the garden!\" she exclaimed, in a gushing torrent--she always spoke in a torrent--\"and it was all I could do to stagger into the house without fainting.  Such eyes! with black cheeks and a red nose--at least, it looked red, but I was in such a state that I couldn't make sure whether it was the nose or the chin, and my shoe came off as I ran away, having broken the tie in the morning.  And such a yell as it gave!--the creature, not the shoe-tie--but I escaped, and peeped out of the upper window--the one in the gable, you know, with the green blind, where you can see the garden from end to end, and I found it had disappeared, though I can't understand--\"  \"Tut, tut, Miss Trim; how you do gallop!  Was it a beast?\" asked the old trader.  \"A beast?  No; a man--a savage.\"  \"Oh!  I understand; it was that scoundrel Petawanaquat,\" said Sam Ravenshaw, with a laugh; \"he's Little Wolf by name, and a big thief by practice, no doubt.  You needn't fear him, however, he's not so dangerous as he looks, and I gave him a rebuff just now that will make him shy of Willow Creek.--Ha, Tony, you rascal!  Come here, sir.\"  Tony came at once, with such a gleeful visage that his father's intended chastisement for the recent practical joke ended in a parental caress.  Bitterly did Ian Macdonald repent of his agreeing to join the shooting party that day.  Owing to some defect in his vision or nervous system, he was a remarkably bad shot, though in everything else he was an expert and stalwart backwoodsman, as well as a good scholar.  But when his friend Victor invited him he could not refuse, because it offered him an opportunity of spending some time in the society of Elsie Ravenshaw, and that to him was heaven upon earth!  Little of her society, however, did the unfortunate teacher enjoy that day, for handsome Louis Lambert engrossed not only Elsie, but the mother and father as well.  He had beaten all his competitors at the target, but, to do him justice, did not boast of that; neither did he make any reference to the fact that Ian had twice missed the target, though he did not spare the bad shooting of some of the other youths; this, no doubt, because he and Ian had been fast friends for many years.  Jealousy--at least on the part of Ian--now seemed about to interfere with the old friendship.  Moreover, Lambert had brought to Mrs Ravenshaw a gift of a collar made of the claws of a grizzly bear, shot by himself in the Rocky Mountains.  Elsie admired the collar with genuine interest, and said she would give anything to possess one like it.  Cora, with the coquettishness of sixteen, said, with a laugh and a blush, that she would not accept such a ridiculous thing if it were offered to her.  Ian Macdonald groaned in spirit, for, with his incapacity to shoot, he knew that Elsie's wish could never be gratified by _him_.  Seeing that Lambert was bent on keeping Elsie as much as possible to himself, Ian devoted himself to Cora, but Cora was cross.  Feeling it up-hill work, he soon rose to say good-bye, and left Willow Creek before the others.  \"Don't look so crestfallen, man,\" said old Mr Ravenshaw heartily, as he shook hands; \"it's nobler work to teach the young idea how to shoot than to be able to hit a bull's-eye.\"  \"True, but he who cannot hit a bull's-eye,\" returned Ian, with a smile, \"can scarcely be expected to touch a maiden's--I mean a grizzly's heart.\"  A shout of laughter from Lambert greeted him as he left the house.  His way home lay over the frozen bed of the river.  Victor accompanied him part of the way.  \"That was a strange slip for an unromantic fellow like you to make about a maiden's heart, Ian,\" said Victor, looking up at the rugged countenance of his friend.  \"`Unromantic,' eh?  Well, I suppose I am.\"  \"Of course you are,\" said Victor, with the overweening assurance of youth.  \"Come, let's sit down here for a few minutes and discuss the point.\"  He sat down on a snowdrift; Ian kicked off his snowshoes and leaned against the bank.  \"You're the most grave, sensible, good-natured, matter-of-fact, unsentimental, unselfish fellow I ever met with,\" resumed Victor.  \"If you were a romantic goose I wouldn't like you half as much as I do.\"  \"Men are sometimes romantic without being geese,\" returned Ian; \"but I have not time to discuss that point just now.  Tell me, for I am anxious about it, have you spoken to your father about selling the field with the knoll to my father?\"  \"Yes, and he flatly refused to sell it.  I'm really sorry, Ian, but you know how determined my father is.  Once he says a thing he sticks to it, even though it should be to his own disadvantage.\"  \"That's bad, Victor, very bad.  It will raise ill-blood between them, and estrange our families.  You think there's no chance?\"  \"None whatever.\"  \"One more word before we part.  Do you know much about that redskin whom your father called Petawanaquat?\"  \"Not much, except that he has come from a considerable distance to make inquiries, he says, about the Christian religion.  He has been prowling about our place for a few days, and father, who has no great love to missionaries, and has strong suspicions of converted Indians, has twice treated him rather roughly.\"  \"I'm sorry to hear that, Victor.  These fellows are sometimes very revengeful.  If you'll be advised by me you'll keep a sharp eye upon Petawanaquat.  There, I'll say no more.  You know I'm "]]]
