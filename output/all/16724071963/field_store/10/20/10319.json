I 'appen to 'ave shares in an American Railway, which my landlord advised me to buy with my small savings.  No doubt, just at present the dividend on the shares of the Washab and Roria Railway have fallen off terribly, but--\"  \"What railway?\" asked Laidlaw quickly.  \"The Washab and Roria.  Somewhere in the United States,\" said Liz.  \"H'm!  I was readin' the papers yestreen,\" said David.  \"Ye see, I'm fond o' fishin' aboot odd corners o' the papers--the money market, an' stocks, an' the like--an' I noticed that vera railway--owin' to its daft-like name, nae doot--an' its deevidends are first-rate.  Ye could sell oot enow at a high profit gin ye like.\"  \"Indeed?  You must be mistaken, I think,\" replied the old woman, \"for I 'ave 'ad almost nothink for a year or two.  You see, my landlord, who takes charge of these matters for me--\"  \"That's Mr Lockhart the lawyer, ye mean?\"  \"Yes.  He says they're losing money now, and there was no dividend at all last half-year.\"  \"H'm! that _is_ strange,\" said David, stroking his chin, \"uncommon-- strange!\"  \"D'you think Mr Lockhart has made a mistake, Mr Laidlaw?\" asked Susan hopefully.  \"Ay, I think he _hes_ made a mistake.  But 'oo'll see.  An' noo, to change the subjec', I'll tell 'ee aboot some o' the adventur's I had last nicht.\"  From this point David Laidlaw entertained old Liz and Susy and Tommy Splint, who had by that time joined them, with a graphic account of his adventures in the slums, in the telling of which he kept his audience in fits of laughter, yet spoke at times with such pathos that Susan was almost moved to tears.  \"Noo, I must away,\" he said at length, rising.  \"I've got partikler business in haund.  Come wi' me, Tammy.  I'll want 'ee, and I'll come back sune to see ye, auld Liz.  Dinna ye tak' on aboot losin' yer place, Su--, Miss Blake, lass.  Ye'll git a better place afore lang--tak' my word for 't.\"  On the way down-stairs Laidlaw and his little companion passed a tall gentleman and two ladies who were ascending.  Ere the foot of the stair was reached, loud exclamations of recognition and joy were heard in the regions above.  \"I say!\" exclaimed Tommy Splint, with wide-open eyes, \"ain't they a-goin' of it up there?  Let's go back an' listen.\"  \"Na, ye wee rascal, we'll no' gang back.  If ye want to be freen's wi' me ye'll no daur to putt yer lug to keyholes.  Come awa'.  It's nae business o' yours or mine.\"  They had not gone far in the direction of Chancery Lane when, to their surprise, they met Sam Blake, who had changed his mind about the visit to Liverpool.  David at once seized him by the arm, and made him walk with them, while he explained the circumstances in which his daughter and old Liz had been so suddenly placed.  \"Wouldn't it be better for me,\" said Sam, \"to steer straight for the garden than to go along with you?\"  \"Na--ye'll gang wi' me.  It's plain that they hae auld freen's veesitin' them at the gairden, sae we'd better lat them alane.  Besides, I want ye for a wutness; I'm no much o' a polis man, nevertheless I'm gaun to try my haund at a bit o' detective business.  Just you come wi' me, and niver say a word till ye're spoken to.\"  \"Heave ahead then, skipper; you're in command,\" returned the sailor with a quiet laugh.  It was echoed by little Tommy, who was hugely pleased with the semi-mysterious looks and nods of his Scottish friend, and regarded the turn affairs seemed to be taking as infinitely superior to mere ordinary mischief.  Arrived at Chancery Lane, they soon discovered the office of John Lockhart, Esquire, Solicitor.  Entering, they found the principal seated at a table covered with papers and legal documents of all kinds.  Both the lawyer and the farmer felt, but did not show, some surprise on looking at each other.    CHAPTER EIGHT.  DARK DESIGNS.  The lawyer was first to speak.  \"It strikes me I have seen you before,\" he said, looking at Laidlaw with a sharp steady gaze.  \"Ay, sir, an' I've seen _you_ before,\" returned the latter with an extremely simple look.  \"I saw ye whan I was comin' oot o' the hoose o' Mr Speevin, whar I'm lodgin'.\"  \"Oh, exactly!\" returned the lawyer with a bland smile; \"pray be seated, gentlemen, and let me know your business.\"  They obeyed,--Sam Blake with an expression of stolid stupidity on his countenance, which was powerfully suggestive of a ship's figurehead-- Tommy with an air of meekness that was almost too perfect.  It would be tedious to detail the conversation that ensued.  Suffice it to say that David said he was a Scotch farmer on a visit to London; that he possessed a good lot of spare cash, for which, at the time being, he got very small interest; that he did not understand business matters very well, but what he wanted to know was, how he should go about investing funds--in foreign railways, for instance, such as the Washab and Roria line.  At this point he was interrupted by Mr Lockhart who asked what had put that particular railway into his head, and was informed that the newspapers had done so by showing it to be the line whose shares produced very high dividends at that time.  \"I'm richt I fancy?\" said David.  \"Yes, you are right, and I could easily put you in the way of investing in that railway.\"  \"Have the shares been lang at this high figure?\" asked Laidlaw.  \"Yes; they have improved steadily for several years back.\"  \"What say ye to that freend?\" demanded David, turning to Sam with a triumphant look.  Sam turned on his friend a look as expressionless as that of a Dutch clock, and said sententiously, \"_I_ says, go in an' win.\"  \"_I_ says ditto!\" thought Tommy Splint, but he meekly and wisely held his tongue.  Meanwhile the lawyer went into another room, from which, returning after a short absence, he produced a bundle of Reports which fully bore out his statement as to the flourishing condition of the Washab and Roria Railway.  \"Weel, I'll see aboot it,\" said David, after a few moments' consideration, with knitted brows.  \"In the meantime, sir, what have I to pay to you for yer information?\"  Mr Lockhart said he had nothing to pay, and hoped he would have the pleasure of seeing him soon again.  \"Noo, isn't _that_ a blagyird?\" demanded Laidlaw, when they were again in the street.  \"No doubt he is,\" replied Sam; \"but how will you manage to haul him up and prove that he has been swindling the old woman?\"  \"Hoo can I tell?  Am I a lawyer?  But I'll fin' oot somehoo.\"  \"Well, mate, while you are finding out,\" returned the sailor, \"I'll go to Cherub Court.  So, Tommy, will you go with Mr Laidlaw or with me?\"  The boy looked first at one and then at the other with a curious \"how-happy-could-I-be-with-either\" expression on his sharp countenance, and then elected to accompany the sailor.  On the way he told Sam of the \"swell visitors\" to the garret, whom Laidlaw had prevented him from going back to see.  \"Quite right he was, Tommy, my boy,\" said his friend.  \"It is easy to see that you have not profited as much as you might from the example and teaching of my dear Susy an' chimney-pot Liz.\"  \"Chimley-pot,\" murmured the boy, correcting him in a low tone.  \"Vell, you could 'ardly expect,\" he added, \"that a child of my age should git the profit all at once.  I suppose it's like a bad ease o' waxination-- it ha'n't took properly yet.\"  \"Then we must have you re-vaccinated, my boy.  But tell me, what were the swells like?\"  The description of the swells occupied Tommy all the rest of the walk to Cherub Court, where they found old Liz and Susan in a state of great excitement about the visitors who had just left.  \"Why, who d'ye think they was?\" exclaimed the old woman, making the fang wobble with a degree of vigour that bid fair to unship it altogether, \"it was my dear sweet little boy Jacky--\"  \"Little boy!  Granny!\" cried Susan, with a merry laugh.  \"Of course, child, I mean what he was and ever will be to me.  He's a tall middle-aged gentleman now, an' with that nice wife that used to visit us--an' their sweet daughter--just like what the mother was, exceptin' those hideous curls tumblin' about her pretty brow as I detest more than I can tell.  An' she's goin' to be married too, young as she is, to a clergyman down in Devonshire, where the family was used to go every summer (alongside o' their lawyer Mr Lockhart as they was so fond of, though the son as has the business now ain't like his father); the sweet child--dear, dear, how it do call up old times!\"  \"And didn't they,\" broke in Tommy, \"never say a word about 'elpin' you, granny, to git hout of your troubles?\"  \"'Ow could they offer to 'elp me,\" returned old Liz sternly, \"w'en they knew nothink about my troubles? an' I'm very glad they didn't, for it would have spoiled their visit altogether if they'd begun it by offerin' me assistance.  For shame, Tommy.  You're not yet cured o' greed, my dear.\"  \"Did I say I _was_?\" replied the urchin, with a hurt look.  Lest the reader should entertain Tommy's idea, we may here mention that Colonel Brentwood and his wife, knowing old Liz's character, had purposely refrained from spoiling their first visit by referring to money matters.  After a full and free discussion of the state of affairs--in which, however, no reference was made to the recent visit to the lawyer, or to the suspected foul play of that gentleman--the sailor went off to overhaul Messrs. Stickle and Screw in the hope of inducing that firm to retain Susy on its staff.  Failing which, he resolved to pay a visit to Samson and Son.  As for Tommy, he went off in a free-and-easy sort of way, without any definite designs, in search of adventures.  That evening old Liz filled her teapot, threw her apron over it, and descended to the court to visit Mrs Rampy.  \"Well, you _are_ a good creetur,\" said that masculine female, looking up as her friend entered.  \"Come away; sit down; I was wantin' some one to cheer me up a bit, for I've just 'ad a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21738"],["title","Hunted and Harried (#0)"],["body","AND HARRIED, BY R.M. BALLANTYNE.  CHAPTER ONE.  ON THE HUNT.  On a brilliant summer morning in the last quarter of the seventeenth century a small troop of horsemen crossed the ford of the river Cairn, in Dumfriesshire, not far from the spot where stands the little church of Irongray, and, gaining the road on the western bank of the stream, wended their way towards the moors and uplands which lie in the neighbourhood of Skeoch Hill.  The dragoons, for such they were, trotted rapidly along the road that led into the solitudes of the hills, with all the careless dash of men whose interests are centred chiefly on the excitements of the passing hour, yet with the unflagging perseverance of those who have a fixed purpose in view--their somewhat worn aspect and the mud with which they were bespattered, from jack-boot to iron headpiece, telling of a long ride over rugged ground.  The officer in command of the party rode a little in advance.  Close behind him followed two troopers, one of whom was a burly middle-aged man with a stern, swarthy countenance; the other a youth whose tall frame was scarcely, if at all, less powerful than that of his comrade-in-arms, though much more elegant in form, while his youthful and ruddy, yet masculine, countenance suggested that he must at that time have been but a novice in the art of war.  This youth alone, of all the party, had a somewhat careworn and sad expression on his brow.  It could hardly have been the result of fatigue, for there was more of ease and vigour in his carriage than in that of any of his companions.  \"We should be near the river by this time, Glendinning,\" said the leader of the party, reining in and addressing the swarthy trooper.  \"Ay, sir, the Cluden rins jist ayont the turn o' the road there,\" replied the man.  \"Ye'll hear the roar o' the fa' in a meenit or twa.\"  Even as he spoke the dull growl of a cataract was heard, and, a few minutes later, the party came upon the ford of the river.  It was situated not many yards below the picturesque waterfall, which is now spanned by the Routen Bridge, but which, at that time, was unbridged--at all events, if a bridge had previously existed, it had fallen in or been carried away--and the wild gorge was impassable.  The sound of the fall alone told of its vicinity, for a dense mass of foliage hid it completely from the troopers' view until they had surmounted the steep bank on the other side of the stream.  \"Are you well acquainted with this man Black?\" asked the leader of the party as they emerged from the thick belt of trees and shrubs by which the Cluden was shaded, and continued their journey on the more open ground beyond.  \"I ken him weel, sir,\" answered the trooper.  \"Andrew Black was an auld freend o' mine, an' a big, stoot, angry man he is--kindly disposed, nae doot, when ye let him alane, but a perfe't deevil incarnate when he's roosed.  He did me an ill turn ance that I've no paid him off for _yet_.\"  \"I suppose, then,\" said the officer, \"that your guiding us so willingly to his cottage is in part payment of this unsettled debt?\"  \"Maybe it is,\" replied the trooper grimly.  \"They say,\" continued the other, \"that there is some mystery about the man; that somehow nobody can catch him.  Like an eel he has slipped through our fellows' fingers and disappeared more than once, when they thought they had him quite safe.  It is said that on one occasion he managed even to give the slip to Claverhouse himself, which, you know, is not easy.\"  \"That may be, sir, but he'll no slip through my fingers gin I ance git a grup o' his thrapple,\" said the swarthy man, with a revengeful look.  \"We must get a grip of him somehow,\" returned the officer, \"for it is said that he is a sly helper of the rebels--though it is as difficult to convict as to catch him; and as this gathering, of which our spies have brought information, is to be in the neighbourhood of his house, he is sure to be mixed up with it.\"  \"Nae doot o' that, sir, an' so we may manage to kill twa birds wi' ae stane.  But I'm in a diffeeculty noo, sir, for ye ken I'm no acquaint wi' this country nae farer than the Cluden ford, an' here we hae come to a fork i' the road.\"  The party halted as he spoke, while the perplexed guide stroked his rather long nose and looked seriously at the two roads, or bridle-paths, into which their road had resolved itself, and each of which led into very divergent parts of the heathclad hills.  This guide, Glendinning, had become acquainted with Black at a time when the latter resided in Lanarkshire, and, as he had just said, was unacquainted with the region through which they now travelled beyond the river Cluden.  After a short conference the officer in command decided to divide the party and explore both paths.  \"You will take one man, Glendinning, and proceed along the path to the right,\" he said; \"I will try the left.  If you discover anything like a house or cot within a mile or two you will at once send your comrade back to let me know, while you take up your quarters in the cottage and await my coming.  Choose whom you will for your companion.\"  \"I choose Will Wallace, then,\" said Glendinning, with a nod to the young trooper whom we have already introduced.  The youth did not seem at all flattered by the selection, but of course obeyed orders with military promptitude, and followed his comrade for some time in silence, though with a clouded brow.  \"It seems to me,\" said the swarthy trooper, as they drew rein and proceeded up a steep ascent at a walk, \"that ye're no' sae pleased as ye might be wi' the wark we hae on hand.\"  \"Pleased!\" exclaimed the youth, whose tone and speech seemed to indicate him an Englishman, \"how can I be pleased when all I have been called on to do since I enlisted has been to aid and abet in robbery, cruelty, and murder?  I honour loyalty and detest rebellion as much as any man in the troop, but if I had known what I now know I would never have joined you.\"  Glendinning gazed at his companion in amazement.  Having been absent on detached service when Will Wallace had joined--about three weeks previously--he was ignorant both as to his character and his recent experiences.  He had chosen him on the present occasion simply on account of his youth and magnificent physique.  \"I doot I've made a mistake in choosin' _you_,\" said Glendinning with some asperity, after a few moments, \"but it's ower late noo to rectifee't.  What ails ye, lad?  What hae ye seen?\"  \"I have seen what I did not believe possible,\" answered the other with suppressed feeling.  \"I have seen a little boy tortured with the thumbscrews, pricked with bayonets, and otherwise inhumanly treated because he would not, or could not, tell where his father was.  I have seen a man hung up to a beam by his thumbs because he would not give up money which perhaps he did not possess.  I have seen a woman tortured by having lighted matches put between her fingers because she would not, or could not, tell where a conventicle was being held.  I did not, indeed, see the last deed actually done, else would I have cut down the coward who did it.  The poor thing had fainted and the torture was over when I came upon them.  Only two days ago I was ordered out with a party who pillaged the house of a farmer because he refused to take an oath of allegiance, which seems to have been purposely so worded as to make those who take it virtually bondslaves to the King, and which makes him master of the lives, properties, and consciences of his subjects--and all this done in the King's name and by the King's troops!\"  \"An' what pairt did _you_ tak' in these doin's?\" asked Glendinning with some curiosity.  \"I did my best to restrain my comrades, and when they were burning the hayricks, throwing the meal on the dunghill, and wrecking the property of the farmer, I cut the cords with which they had bound the poor fellow to his chair and let him go free.\"  \"Did onybody see you do that?\"  \"I believe not; though I should not have cared if they had.  I'm thoroughly disgusted with the service.  I know little or nothing of the principles of these rebels--these fanatics, as you call them--but tyranny or injustice I cannot stand, whether practised by a king or a beggar, and I am resolved to have nothing more to do with such fiendish work.\"  \"Young man,\" said the swarthy comrade in a voice of considerable solemnity, \"ye hae obviously mista'en your callin'.  If you werena new to thae pairts, ye would ken that the things ye objec' to are quite common.  Punishin' an' harryin' the rebels and fanatics--_Covenanters_, they ca' theirsels--has been gaun on for years ower a' the land.  In my opeenion it's weel deserved, an' naething that ye can do or say wull prevent it, though what ye do an' say is no' unlikely to cut short yer ain career by means o' a rope roond yer thrapple.  But losh! man, I wonder ye haena heard about thae matters afore now.\"  \"My having spent the last few years of my life in an out-of-the-way part of Ireland may account for that,\" said Wallace.  \"My father's recent death obliged my mother to give up her farm and return to her native town of Lanark, where she now lives with a brother.  Poverty and the urgency of a cousin have induced me, unfortunately, to take service with the dragoons.\"  \"After what ye've said, hoo am I to coont on yer helpin' me e'noo?\" asked Glendinning.  \"As long as I wear the King's uniform you may count on my obeying orders unless I am commanded to break the plainest laws of God,\" answered the young man.  \"As our present business is only to discover the cottage of Andrew Black, there seems likely to be no difficulty between us just now.\"  \"H'm!  I'm no' sure o' that; but if ye'll tak' my advice, lad, ye'll haud yer tongue aboot thae matters.  If Clavers heard the half o' what ye've said to me, he'd send ye into the next warl' withoot gieing ye time to say yer prayers.
