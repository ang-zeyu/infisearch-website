I soon came to a deep and rapid sweep of water,      which appeared to spread far beyond two narrow banks which might      have formerly bounded it. This I thought to be the Findhorn, but      ere I went many paces farther another sight met my eyes--the real      river itself dashing through the glen with an awful majesty, and      carrying roots, trees, and herbage of every description hurriedly      over its broad breast. In the midst of this scene of devastation      appeared the ruins of a noble bridge, nothing but the piers      remaining, and these dashing to pieces in the furious current. The      stream I had seen at first was the river flowing down the road. The      river fell in the evening, and I crossed the ferry. I had two days      of most delightful weather, and yesterday evening I had a sunset      and moonlight walk by the side of Loch Ness, among the most noble      scenery I ever beheld. The sky was perfectly clear, and without a      single cloud.       \"I must now finish, as the post is going away. If you see Joseph      [_i.e._, the late Joseph Robertson, a constant companion and      attached friend], tell him I will write to him soon and have a deal      to say to him, particularly of my discovering a sculptured stone in      Elgin Cathedral. Notwithstanding the fineness of the evening, this      day is determinedly rainy. If you see any of the H.'s, give Mrs      Grant's compliments.--Adieu for the present; and I remain, my dear      mother, your affectionate and dutiful son,       \"J. HILL BURTON.\"  The writer has heard many farther details of the excursion of which this letter records the beginning. The temporary clearing up of the weather referred to was but a hollow truce in the tremendous elemental warfare of that memorable autumn. The flood described in the Findhorn was but a faint precursor of the wave sixty feet high, which, a week or two later, burst through the splendid girdle of rock which at Relugas confines that loveliest of Scotch rivers, and spread over the fertile plain beneath, changing it into a sea. At some points in Morayshire, the enormous overflow of the rivers broke down the banks which bound the ocean, and permanently changed the coast-line of the country. The most striking and extraordinary part of Sir Thomas Dick Lauder's description of this flood is an extract from the log of a sailing packet--a sea-going vessel--which directed its course over and about the plain of Moray, picking the inhabitants off the roofs of their houses, or such other elevations as they could reach.  Dr Burton had the good fortune to see the Fall of Foyers during this great flood, and had the temerity to cross its stream, which lay on his road, upon a remaining parapet of the fallen bridge!     CHAPTER II.  EDINBURGH.  _Apprenticeship in lawyer's office--Grandfather's letter--J.H. Burton's letters to his mother, conveying first impressions of Edinburgh, and account of passing Civil Law trial._   On the completion of his studies, John Burton was apprenticed to a writer in Aberdeen. He has talked of this period as one of the most painful of his life. He was utterly unable to master the routine of office-work, or to submit to its restraints; and one of his most joyful days was that in which his indentures were, by mutual desire, cancelled.  A piece of yellow old paper was found in Dr Burton's desk when he died. It was a letter written some fifty-five years before, and had probably lain there during all these years. As it refers to this period of Dr Burton's life, it may be given. It seems fully to bear out the writer's conception of the unsympathising character of the intercourse between Mrs Burton and her family. No stronger incentive to exertion could have been offered to a man of Dr Burton's character, than the desire to falsify the implied prediction of such a missive. With a view to its effect in this way it had probably been given him by his mother. It is an entire letter, and the whole is here printed.       \"GRANDHOLM, _June 6th_.       \"DEAR ELIZA,--I have this day received a letter from my father,      part of which I think it necessary to transcribe to you, as the      best mode of giving you his meaning.       \"'The account of John Burton's being in such an idle unemployed way      displeases me much. I wish you, Mary, would speak to his mother on      the subject; tell her I would have acquainted her with my      displeasure before now, only, on account of her misfortune in her      family [this must refer to the death of her son David], I deferred      what I ought to have done. Why was he taken away from his      attendance at Mr Winchester's office? Doctor Dauney said he could      not be better than with him, as there was plenty of business, such      as was going. Tell her that as I have neither funds nor inclination      to support idle gentlemen, or rather vagabonds, I have given      directions to Mr Alcock not to pay up her next half-year's annuity,      till he hears from me on the subject, and until she gives you      satisfactory accounts concerning her son's return to Mr      Winchester's office or otherwise. Tell her not to write to me, but      to act as is her duty.'\"       The sister here continues, \"I hope Mary [Dr Burton's only sister,      the youngest child of his mother] continues well, and that you will      not fail to give me an answer to this, as you see it will be      absolutely necessary to give attention to the subject. Barbara      continues very unwell.--I remain yours sincerely, M. PATON.\"  Whether the threat conveyed in this letter was executed, the writer has now no means of knowing. The expression of it alone was cruel enough--the threat to starve a poor mother into forcing a son to continue a business utterly repugnant to him. Mrs Burton, however, did not protect herself by the sacrifice of her son. She believed in her son's powers, and acted on her belief in spite of all opposition; and she had her reward. She lived to see her son gaining fame in letters, and to find in him the utmost devotion a son can show to a mother. He never forgot or failed to acknowledge his obligations to her. These were undoubtedly great. She not only gave him, in part personally, his education, but when that was finished, and she hoped to find peace for her declining years in the little home she had prepared for herself, she sacrificed that also to her hope of her son's advancement--her faith in his talents and perseverance.  With the death of her husband, perhaps also on account of that of her father, and the loss of her two little sons, Mrs Burton's pecuniary position seems to have become somewhat easier. Whilst her son John was destined for business in Aberdeen, she had built a small house for her own occupation in the neighbourhood. When he set his mind on the higher walk of his profession, and desired to come to the Scotch Bar, the necessary expense could only be compassed by the devoted mother selling her newly built house, and casting in her lot with her son. She, her young daughter, and an Aberdeenshire maiden (so primitive in her ideas, that she conceived the only way of reaching Edinburgh from Warriston must be by _wading_ the Water of Leith), followed John to Edinburgh, and took up their abode in a very small house on the north side of Warriston Crescent in the year 1831.  Dr Burton was no great letter-writer. After he began, as he said, to write for print, he considered it waste of time to write anything which was not to be printed, except in briefest form. His letters to his wife and family during absences on the Continent or elsewhere, seldom contained more than a bare itinerary, past and future, often referring them for particulars to the article in 'Blackwood,' which was to grow out of his travels.  His mother was naturally the recipient of the writing which came before the days of print,--before the days of penny postage also. Almost every letter contains a history of how his mother's last reached him, as well as how he hoped to have that which he is writing conveyed to her without paying the awful tax of postage.  The next letters here offered belong to the beginning of his Edinburgh life, and relate to a feat of mental exertion equal to his bodily performances. He was at the time living in lodgings, for the purpose of passing his legal examinations preparatory to coming to the Bar; but he may be allowed to give the history of this part of his life entirely in his own words.       \"EDINBURGH, _3d Nov. 1830_.       \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I have just arrived here, and as there is a      friend of Mr Dauney's just about to set off for Aberdeen, I      preferred letting you get a bit of a note or so to sending you a      newspaper. Of course I have nothing to write you about but my own      concerns. A delightful moonlight night for travelling, but the      coach rather full: there were three nice children, with whom I      contrived to amuse myself. All went on well till we came to      Burntisland Ferry, where we had to proceed so far in an open boat.      The sea poured in in a rather disagreeable manner; and while I      thought every one was getting a good ducking but myself, a large      miscreant of a wave contrived to escape every other passenger, and      to settle right upon my shoulders. I have not yet secured a      lodging in Edinburgh, but have been wandering through all the      streets admiring. Of the Old Town I think far more than of the New,      it is so majestic and magnificent, and am resolved, if I can, to      live in it.       \"I dined at Mr Dauney's to-day. He has requested me to stay with      him till I can get lodgings conveniently, but I expect to be stowed      away to-morrow. I delivered Mr Innes's parcel; and remain, my dear      mother, your most affectionate son, J. HILL BURTON.       \"_P.S._--I would have written you a long letter, but do not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],["title","The Book-Hunter (#4)"],["body"," to      absent myself from table.\"         *       *       *       *       *       \"11 KEIR STREET, EDINBURGH,      _Tuesday Evening, 9th Nov. 1830_.       \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I take the opportunity of Mr Innes's parcel,      which leaves this to-morrow afternoon, to give you a more succinct      account of my affairs than you could derive from my laconic epistle      of last week. I must, however, preface by requesting you to write      me as soon as you conveniently can, either by Innes or L. Smith's      conveyance, as I am anxious to hear the state of your cold, and how      James is succeeding at school.       \"When I dismounted from the coach I was peculiarly struck by the      sight of magnificent streets, with scarcely a human being to be      seen along them. I expected to have found them of that crowded      description so often characteristic of a metropolis; but to one who      is accustomed to see our grand mercantile thoroughfare, the      paucity of perambulators in _some_ of the streets of Edinburgh      appears rather peculiar. _Others_ I found at particular periods to      be thickly inhabited. My first course was to direct my course      through the rain to G.B.'s dwelling, where I found him reading a      large Bible. He appears to have carried fanaticism to a ridiculous      pitch, unworthy of his education and station in life. He put into      my hands a tract (composed I am afraid by himself), with      injunctions to read it. I intend to send it to you as a curiosity.      His brother Charles, whom I best knew, used to be a clever and      sensible boy, very well informed; I hope he, too, is not also among      the prophets. How few steer a middle course! G.B. cannot do the      most trifling act without connecting it with religion. It is a mere      disease. Others never think of it at all. I think it is Dr Johnson      who says something to this effect: '----was mad, and showed it by      kneeling down and saying his prayers on the street. Now there are      many men who are not mad, yet I am afraid are worse than poor ----,      for they never pray at all.' But to return--I inquired at Mr B. if      he could recommend me to any cheap and respectable lodging. After      applying some thought to the subject, he began to recollect that he      did know of one or two. With regard to one the address was rather      imperfect, as he knew neither the name nor the number, but had a      guess of the street. The other I discovered, and now occupy,      although he gave me both a wrong name and wrong number.       \"Immediately on leaving B.'s I went to Dauney, who appeared glad to      see me, and kindly asked me to dine with him. He has a very      handsome house. Mrs Dauney is a very agreeable person, and they      have two children. He would not hear of my leaving him till I had      got accommodated with good lodgings. The rooms I now occupy I did      not enter till yesterday. They were inhabited by a person just      about to leave them, and I had no recommendation to others so well      situated. The person who keeps the lodgings is named M'Gregor. I      have a room and closet, neat enough, for which I pay 8s. a-week,      which includes coals. I could not have a place nearly so cheap in      the New Town. The situation is delightful. It is behind the Old      Town, and the windows look across towards it and the Castle, just      as those in Union Terrace look towards Belmont Street. The view      extends as far as the Firth of Forth.       \"There are, moreover, other advantages. Heriot's Hospital and the      old city wall are close by; and when I choose I may, in going to      the New Town, pass through the West Port and the Grassmarket.       \"I have been a good deal annoyed about my luggage, which has not      yet been sent up, so that you may imagine some of my present      drapery has been worn long enough.       \"I directed a person, calling himself the Clyde Shipping Company's      agent here, to get them sent up last Saturday, which was to be done      'pointedly.' I amused myself from day to day annoying the man, till      at last his patience appeared determined to weather out mine, so I      went to Leith to-day and saw after them myself--found the man had      nothing to do whatever with the concern, and neither could nor did      give directions. The clerk, after blessing himself the usual number      of times, stated his opinion that it would have been better for      both parties had they left his office some time ago, so I expect to      see them early to-morrow. I will let you know of their safe arrival      if before three. I read your poetry[5] all over, but did I begin to      remark on it here I would exceed the limits which a narration of      facts has left me. It has afforded me much pleasure in the      loneliness, which, of course, I feel a little at first. However, I      cannot say it makes me at all sad. There is something independent      and free in the idea that none of the vast multitude you are among      cares more for your life or welfare than the breeze that passes. I      begin my studies to-morrow, and if I behave properly will have a      good deal to do.       [Footnote 5: Mrs Burton wrote verses well. She occasionally      published in the 'Gentleman's Magazine.']       \"By the way, I may here mention a somewhat important circumstance.      The greater part of the entrance fee is paid immediately on passing      the Civil Law trial, which you know I wished to do this spring. The      whole fee is less than £300, and the part payable _then_ is more      than £200. The fees are to be raised, but the increase cannot be      levied upon me; it only applies to those who have not commenced      their studies at the period of raising. Speak to R. Alcock about      this. I daily meet troops of Aberdonians. I dined on Friday last      with a young man, Fordyce, and yesterday with Mr J. Jopp. I      calculate I have about fifty fellow-citizens connected with law      here....       \"_Wednesday, half-past two._--Just got my luggage--cost 8s.

I      breakfasted and dined last Sunday with Mr H. Constable, who is a      very agreeable young fellow. He is the proprietor of the      Miscellany.[6] By the way, I find out that if I do not pass my      Civil Law trial before 1832 I shall be compelled to pay £50 to a      Widows' Fund.

I was told from the proper authority (I have      already mentioned to you) that a Widows' Fund subscription is to be      charged against those who enter after 1st January 1832. I have      consulted the Act of Parliament, and find it is leviable against      those who enter after 1st January 1831. The last examination this      year will be on _Tuesday week_,--the last for passing which £50 and      an annual payment of £7 is not charged. Now for this examination I      intend to prepare myself, unless you inform me _immediately_ that      the money, £213, cannot be obtained. See Mr Alcock immediately, and      explain this, but tell it to _no other person_, as I should not      like it to be known that I had failed. I expect to know your      intentions at farthest by _Monday_, as I must then give warning to      the Faculty. You must be expeditious, as I can assure you _I_ shall      be. The subject is not difficult, and I think I may be able to      prepare myself for an ordinary examination. Should I find it      _impossible_, I will still reserve to myself, even after you send      the money, the power of withdrawing. The Widows' subscription (as      the Act states) is repayable to those who are rejected or die      before joining, and I presume the entry-money is so too. If it is      _not_, I should insure my life.       \"If you consent to my arrangements, you must send me a certificate      of my age--an extract from the Register of Baptisms, or something      of that sort.

Now the      Widows' Fund, you know, when one has a widow, will be a very good      sort of thing--£80 per annum, I believe. So if any lady wishes me      to marry her, she had better advise me by all means to join the      scheme.
