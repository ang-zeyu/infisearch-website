Why did you get so crusty when I sprang the idea of doing the wreck scene in his flower beds to-night?\"  \"Because the idea was too kiddish,\" returned Dick. \"Besides, Old Dut was talking to me a good deal along such lines.\"  \"Did you go and tell him what I wanted to do?\" flared Greg.  \"I didn't. But Old Dut pinned me down and asked me whether that book throwing were really an accident, and I had to admit that it wasn't. Now, listen!\"  Dick thereupon repeated his conversation with Principal Jones.  \"He's a wise man, all right,\" nodded Harry Hazelton.  \"I guess so,\" nodded Dave Darrin. \"After all, it would look rather kiddish in us to go slipping up to his front yard in the dark night, lifting off his front gate and carrying it down to the river.\"  \"It would be stealing, or wasting, property, also,\" agreed Tom Reade.  \"So, fellows,\" resumed Dick, \"I guess----\"  \"Hullo! What's going on down there?\" broke in Darrin hastily, as all six of the Grammar School boys looked ahead.  A woman's scream had caught their ear.  \"It's Mrs. Dexter,\" muttered Hazelton.  \"And that rascally husband of hers,\" added Greg Holmes.  \"Some new row, of course,\" broke in Dan Dalzell.  \"It's a shame!\" burst from Dick.  \"That Dexter fellow ought to be hung,\" growled Tom Reade. \"He's always bothering that woman, and she's one of the nicest ever. But now he won't let her alone, just because her grandfather had to die and leave Mrs. Dexter a lot of money.\"  The little city of Gridley was quite familiar with the domestic troubles of the Dexters. The woman was young and pretty, and good-hearted. Abner Dexter, on the other hand, was good-looking and shiftless. He had married Jennie Bolton because he believed her family to be wealthy, and Dexter considered himself too choice for work. But the Bolton money had all belonged to the grandfather, who, a keen judge of human nature, had guessed rightly the nature of Abner Dexter and had refused to let him have any money.  Dexter had left his wife and little daughter some two years before the opening of this story. Three months before old man Bolton had died, leaving several hundred thousand dollars to Mrs. Dexter. Then Dexter had promptly reappeared. But Mrs. Dexter no longer wanted this shiftless, extravagant man about, and had told him so plainly. Dexter had threatened to make trouble, and the wife had thereupon gone to court and had herself appointed sole guardian of her little daughter. At the same time she had turned some money over to her husband--common report said ten thousand dollars--on his promise to go away and not bother her again.  Plainly he had not kept his word. As Dick and his chums glanced down the quiet side street they saw husband and wife standing facing each other. The man was scowling, the woman half-tearful, half-defiant. Behind her, in her left hand, Mrs. Dexter held a small handbag.  \"I'd like to be big enough to be able to enjoy the pleasure of thrashing a fellow like that Dexter!\" growled Dave Darrin, his eyes flashing.  \"There's a man standing a little way below the pair,\" announced Dick. \"I wonder what he's doing, for he seems to be watching the couple intently. I hope he's on Mrs. Dexter's side.\"  Unconsciously Dick and his friends had halted to watch the proceedings ahead of them.  \"No, I won't,\" replied Mrs. Dexter sharply, to something that her husband had said.  Abner Dexter talked rapidly, a black scowl on his face meanwhile.  \"No, you won't! You don't dare!\" replied the woman, her voice sounding as though she had summoned all her courage by an effort.  Dexter suddenly sprang closer to the woman. The next instant both were struggling for possession of the little black bag that she carried.  \"Stop!\" cried Mrs. Dexter desperately. \"Help! He-lp!\"  \"Fellows, I don't know that we're bound to stand for that,\" muttered Dick Prescott quickly. \"She's calling for help. Come along.\"  Dick was off down the street like a streak, the others following, though Dave was closest to his chum.  \"Here, what are you doing, mister?\" demanded Dick, as he darted up to where the pair were struggling.  Dexter would have had the bag in his own possession by this time, had he not turned to see what the onrush of boys meant.  \"None of your business what I'm doing,\" he replied savagely. \"You schoolboys run along out of this.\"  \"Don't go! Help me,\" pleaded the woman. \"He's trying to rob me!\"  \"You boys clear out, or it will be worse for you!\" growled Dexter.  \"The lady wins!\" Dick announced coolly, though he was shaking somewhat from excitement. \"You let go of her and her property.\"  But Dexter, his face black with scowls, still clutched tightly with his right hand at the little handbag, to which Mrs. Dexter was clinging with both her hands.  \"You let go of that bag,\" challenged Dick, \"or six of us will sail into you. I think we can handle you. We'll try, anyway.\"  \"Yes; make him let go,\" begged Mrs. Dexter. \"I have money and jewels here, and he is trying to take them away from me.\"  \"Going to do as the lady wishes?\" inquired Dick, stepping closer.  Abner Dexter shot another angry glare at the sextette of Grammar School boys. They were closing in around him, and it looked as though they meant business.  \"Gus!\" called Dexter sharply.  The man who had been standing a short distance away now ran up to the spot.  \"Hullo, what do you want!\" asked Dick coolly. \"Are you the understudy in this game of robbery?\"  \"I'm an officer,\" retorted the fellow sharply.  \"Secretary to some Chinese laundry company, eh?\" jeered Dick.  \"I'm a police officer,\" retorted the man sharply, at the same time displaying a shield.  That put a different look on matters with some of young Prescott's friends. Dick, however, was a boy not easily daunted.  \"If you're an officer,\" he inquired, \"why don't you get busy and do your duty? Here's a man trying to rob his wife, just because she happens to have more money than he has.\"  \"A man can't legally steal from his wife, nor a woman from her husband,\" retorted the policeman bullyingly. \"There is no crime being committed here. But if you boys try to interfere you'll be disturbing the peace, and I'll run you all in.\"  Mrs. Dexter looked bewildered and frightened. She even let go of the handbag with one hand. Dick saw this, and quickly broke in:  \"Mrs. Dexter, don't you let Mr. Dexter have that handbag unless you want to do it. We'll stand by you.\"  \"Oh, will you?\" glared the policeman. \"You boys run along, or I'll gather you all in.\"  \"Where are you a policeman?\" inquired Dick Prescott, eyeing the fellow with interest. \"You're not a Gridley officer, for I know every one of them.\"  \"Never you mind where I'm from,\" jeered the man harshly. \"I'm a policeman. That'll have to be enough for you youngsters. If you don't trot fast down the street I'll gather you in.\"  Some of Dick's chums were now inclined to feel that they had broken in at the wrong place, but not so their young leader.  \"You haven't any right to make arrests in Gridley,\" retorted Dick defiantly. \"And, even if you had, you couldn't stop us from defending a woman. Tom, you and Greg stand by me. Dave, you lead the rest. We'll make Dexter let go of his wife's property and let her alone. If this man who says he's an officer interferes, Greg, Tom and I will devote our attention to him!\"  \"Great!\" snarled Dexter jeeringly. \"You're all young jailbirds!\"  \"Are you going to let go of Mrs. Dexter's property?\" challenged Dick.  \"I'm not.\"  \"Come on, fellows--let's sail into him.\"  Dick was an able general, having his small force under good discipline. There was a sudden rush of boys. True, they averaged only thirteen years of age, but there were six of them, and they were determined.  Dexter let go of the handbag in a hurry. He had to do so, in order to defend himself.  At the same moment the man named as \"Gus\" jumped into the fray.  \"Three to each man!\" yelled Dick, and thus the force was divided.  The self-styled policeman reached out with the flat of his hand, knocking Greg Holmes off his feet. But, as he did so, Dick dropped down in front of the man, wrapping both arms around the fellow's knees. Then Dick rose. It required the exertion of all his strength, but he succeeded in toppling Gus over onto his back.  At the same time Abner Dexter was having all he could do, for three very determined schoolboys were assailing him. At last Dexter turned to retreat, but Dan Dalzell thrust a foot before him and tripped him.  \"All down!\" yelled Dan. \"Set 'em up in the other alley!\"  Though downed for the moment, the two men were disposed to make a livelier fight of it than ever. It was a brisk, picturesque, rough-and-tumble fight that followed, in which the young boys got a deal of rough handling.  Frightened, yet fascinated, Mrs. Dexter tottered against the fence and stood looking on.  Things might yet have fared badly with Dick and his friends had not a newcomer arrived on the scene. He came running, and proved to be Policeman Whalen in uniform.  \"Here! What's on?\" demanded the Gridley officer. \"Let up on kicking them boys! I want you!\"  With that Whalen, who was a big and powerful man, grabbed Abner Dexter by the coat collar and pulled him to his feet. With this prisoner in tow, he moved up and seized Gus in similar fashion.  \"Now, what's the row?\" demanded Officer Whalen.  \"Arrest these boys for assault!\" quivered Dexter in a passion.  \"Yes, arrest them!\" insisted Gus. \"I'm an officer, too, and I was trying to take them in.\"  \"You didn't seem to be having very good luck at it,\" grinned Whalen. \"But I know these boys, and they're all good lads.\"  \"Arrest them, just the same! They were assaulting me,\" insisted Dexter angrily.  \"And what were you doing?\" insisted Whalen wonderingly.  \"He was trying to steal jewels and money from his wife,\" interposed Dick Prescott.  \"Bah!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22307"],["title","The Grammar School Boys of Gridley; or, Dick & Co.

Mrs. Dexter, are these lads telling the truth?\"  \"Oh, yes, officer! My husband was trying to take this satchel away from me, and he knew that it contains my jewels and thirty-five hundred dollars in cash.\"  \"Do you want him arrested?\"  \"Yes; I--I'm afraid I shall have to have him arrested, or he'll go right on annoying me.\"  \"Will you appear against him, Mrs. Dexter?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Then I'll take him along. And what about this fellow?\"  \"Me?\" demanded Gus with offended dignity. \"I'm a police officer.\"  \"What's your name?\"  \"August Driggs.\"  \"Where are you a policeman?\"  \"In Templeton.\"  \"Why were you lads fighting Officer Driggs?\" inquired Whalen blandly.  Dick supplied some of the details, Dave others. Mrs. Dexter confirmed the statements that they made.  \"I guess I'll take you along, too, Driggs,\" announced Policeman Whalen.  \"But I'm a police officer!\" protested Driggs aghast.  \"Police officers can be arrested like anyone else, when they break the law,\" announced Policeman Whalen dryly. \"Come along, the two of you! Mrs. Dexter, you wouldn't like to be seen walking along with us, but I'll ask you to be at the station house inside of five minutes.\"  \"I'll be there, officer,\" promised the woman.  \"Do you want us, too?\" inquired Dick. He and all of his friends were eager to see the affair through to the finish.  \"No; I know where to find you lads, if you're wanted,\" grinned Policeman Whalen. \"I don't want a big crowd following. Mrs. Dexter, ma'am, I'll be looking for you to be on hand sharp.\"  With that the broad-backed policeman started off with two savage prisoners in tow.  \"Say, if we're to have any dinner and get back to school on time, we'll have to be moving fast,\" declared Dan Dalzell.  \"I thought we were surely going to get into a lot of trouble,\" muttered Hazelton, as the youngsters moved along rapidly. \"But Whalen knew his business.\"  \"I hope the judge can send that Dexter fellow up for a good, long time,\" muttered Dick. \"He's been annoying that poor woman all the time lately.\"  \"Just because she has her grandfather's money at last,\" grumbled Dave Darrin.  Soon the youngsters came to a point where they had to separate. But all hands were back at school on time. The work of the afternoon was duly progressing when the telephone bell at the principal's desk rang.  Old Dut held what proved to be a mysterious conversation for a few moments. Then he wound up with:  \"All right. I'll send them right over.\"  Ringing off, Old Dut glanced at Dick.  \"Master Prescott, it appears that you, Darrin, Reade, Holmes, Dalzell and Hazelton saw some trouble on the street this noon.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"All six of you are wanted, at once, down at court, to give evidence. You are excused. If you get through at court early enough, come back to finish your afternoon's work.\"  Six Grammar School boys rose and filed out quietly. How enviously the other boys in the room stared after them! How curiously the girls glanced at the young heroes who were now wanted on the government's business!  \"Say,\" ventured Dan as soon as they got outside, \"I hope the judge orders Dexter hanged.\"  \"He'll hardly do that,\" retorted Dave. \"A street row is hardly a hanging offense. If it were, there'd be a lot of fellows missing from the Central Grammar School.\"  \"So we're called in to help decide the case?\" asked Greg, puffing up.  \"Oh, get busy with some brains!\" scoffed Dick airily. \"We haven't anything to do with deciding the case. That's what the judge is paid for. But we're wanted just to tell what we know. Say, you fellows, be careful you don't get so rattled that you try to tell a lot of things that you don't know.\"  In due time they reached the court building. Grown suddenly very quiet and almost scared, these six thirteen-year-old boys filed upstairs. A policeman stood before the door of the courtroom.  \"May we go in?\" whispered Dick.  \"Of course,\" nodded the policeman. \"Take your hats off.\"  The officer conducted the sextette of young witnesses inside, past a group or two of loungers who made up the usual police-court audience, and thence on before the bench.  At one side, at this end of the room, sat Dexter and Driggs. Right in front of the clerk of the court were seated Mrs. Dexter and a lawyer. Officer Whalen lounged near the two prisoners.  \"These are the lads, your honor,\" nodded Policeman Whalen, after giving Dick & Co. a keen looking over.  \"Swear them, Mr. Clerk,\" said the Justice.  Solemnly the six youngsters held up their right hands and took the oath. Then Justice Lee began to question them. From Dick, first, he drew out the story of the dispute in the street. Then the others told the same story.  \"Why did you boys interfere?\" asked the justice of Prescott.  \"Because, sir,\" Dick answered, \"we didn't want to see a woman ill-treated on the street.\"  \"A very good reason,\" nodded Justice Lee approvingly. \"But weren't you afraid of Driggs, here, who is really a police officer?\"  \"No, sir; I didn't believe that a police officer had any more right than any one else to break the law.\"  \"You boys have acted very sensibly,\" nodded Justice Lee. \"Dexter, do you wish to question any of these young witnesses?\"  Dexter shook his head, scowling.  \"Do you, Driggs?\"  \"No, your honor. 'Twouldn't be any use.\"  \"You're right about that, I imagine,\" nodded the justice. \"Boys, the court wishes to express its pleasure over your good sense, and to praise you for your chivalry and courage. You did just right--as the court hopes you will always do under similar circumstances. Dexter, stand up. Driggs, also.\"  The two prisoners arose, sullen enough in their appearance.  \"Dexter, you have been guilty of disturbing the peace. I do not believe a mere fine sufficient in your case. I therefore sentence you to serve thirty days in jail. Driggs, your primary offense was about as great as Dexter's, but your offense is worse, for you are a police officer, and you tried to throw the strength of your position around the acts of the prisoner. The court therefore sentences you to sixty days in jail.\"  \"We both wish to appeal, your honor,\" cried Dexter, his face aflame.  \"Dexter's bail will then be fixed at two hundred dollars; Driggs's at four hundred dollars. Are you prepared to furnish bail?\"  \"I will furnish the cash for both of us,\" announced Abner Dexter, drawing a roll of banknotes from a pocket.  Mrs. Dexter and her lawyer filed out while this matter was being arranged with the clerk of the court. Dick and his friends, at a sign from the court, left the room as soon as they had received their fees as witnesses.  \"So he pays the money, Dexter does, and walks out?\" grunted Dan Dalzell.  \"Oh, no,\" Dick answered. \"Dexter and his friend have to be tried over again in a higher court. That money is just their forfeit in case they don't show up for trial.\"  \"They won't,\" predicted Greg.  \"I don't know,\" murmured Dick. \"Six hundred dollars would be a lot of money to lose.\"  By hastening, the Grammar School boys were back in school for the last hour of the session.     CHAPTER III  FOOTBALL--WITHOUT RULES   School was out for the day. Three quarters of the boys belonging to the four upper grades made a bee line for a field about a block away. The magnet was a football that Dave Darrin proudly carried tucked under his left arm.  \"I wanter play!\"  \"Let me try just one good kick with it, Dave!\"  \"Take a stroll,\" advised Darrin laconically. \"How can I blow up the ball and talk to you fellows, too?\"  \"Hurry up, then. We want to give the ball a fierce old kick.\"  \"No kids in this,\" announced Dave, rather loftily. \"Only fellows in the eighth and seventh grades. Fellows in the grades below the seventh are only kids and would get hurt.\"  \"Oh, say!\"  \"That isn't fair!\"  The protests were many and vigorous from sixth and fifth-grade boys, but Darrin, ignoring them all, went placidly on inflating the pigskin. At last the task was completed.  \"Hurrah! Now, Dave, give it a boost and let us all have some fun!\" cried the boys. But Darrin coolly tucked the ball under one arm.  \"Dick Prescott has a few remarks to make first,\" Dave announced.  \"Dick going to make a speech?\"  \"Cut it, and start the ball moving!\"  \"Won't you fellows interrupt your music lessons long enough to listen to an idea that some of us have been talking over?\" called Dick. \"Now, fellows, you know this is the time when the crack Gridley High School football team is hard at work. We're all proud of the Gridley High School eleven. A lot of you fellows expect to go to High School, and I know you'd all like a chance to play on Gridley High's eleven.\"  \"Set the ball moving!\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Dick insisted. \"Now, fellows, no Grammar School in Gridley has ever had an eleven.\"  \"How could we,\" came a discontented wail, \"if we have to stand here and see Dave just do nothing but hold the ball?\"  \"Fellows,\" Dick went on impressively, \"it's time to have Grammar School football teams here in Gridley. Central Grammar ought to have one, North Grammar one and South Grammar one. Then our three Grammar Schools could play a championship series among themselves.\"  \"Hooray! Give the ball a throw, Dave!\"  \"So, fellows,\" Dick continued, \"a lot of us think we ought to organize a football team at once. Then we can challenge North Grammar and South Grammar. We can practise the rest of this month, and next month we can play off our games. What do you say?\"  \"Hooray!\"  \"We'll have two teams,\" called Dave. \"We'll call one team the Rangers and the other the Rustlers. Now, let's make Dick captain of the Rangers.\"  \"All right!\"  \"And Tom Craig captain of the Rustlers.\"  \"Good!\"  \"All right, then,\" nodded Dave. \"Dick, you pick out the Rangers; Craig, you go ahead with the Rustlers. After we've practised a few times we'll pick the best men from both elevens, and make up the "]]]
