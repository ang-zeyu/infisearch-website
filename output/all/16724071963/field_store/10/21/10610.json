The gift infused a new life into the school. Hitherto the world outside had been a sealed book to the boys. They knew of no world, save that included within the walls of the house. Their geography told them of other lands and people, but these were mere names, until now.  Among the books were Robinson Crusoe, Midshipman Easy, Peter Simple, three or four of Cooper's Indian tales, Dana's Life before the Mast, and several of Kingston's and Ballantyne's books. These opened a wonderland of life and adventure to the boys. The schoolmaster used to give them out, at twelve o'clock; and they were returned at two, when school recommenced; and only such boys as obtained full marks for their lessons were allowed to have them. In this way, instead of the library being a cause of idleness--as some of the guardians predicted, when they heard of its presentation--it was an incentive to work.  Certainly its perusal filled the minds of most of the boys with an intense longing to go to sea but, as there is always a demand for apprentices for the Yarmouth and Lowestoft smacks, the guardians did not disapprove of this bent being given to their wishes--indeed, as no premium had to be paid, with apprentices to smack owners, while in most trades a premium is required, a preference was given to the sea by the guardians.  When William Gale reached the age of fifteen, and was brought before the board to choose the trade to which he would be apprenticed, he at once said that he would go to sea. There were applications from several smack masters for apprentices; and he, with the five other boys brought up with him, were all of one opinion in the matter.  \"Mind, lads,\" the chairman said, \"the life of an apprentice on board a North Sea smack is a hard one. You will get a great many more kicks than half pence. It will be no use grumbling, when you have once made your choice. It is a rough, hard life--none rougher, or harder. When you have served your time, it will be open to you either to continue as smacksmen, or to ship as seamen in sea-going ships.  \"Sailors who hail from the eastern fishing ports are always regarded as amongst the best of our seamen. Still, it is a rough life, and a dangerous one. The hardest life, on shore, is easy in comparison. There is time to change your minds, before you sign; when you have done so, it will be too late. Are you all determined?\"  None of them wavered. Their signatures were attached to the indentures, and they were told that the porter would take them to Yarmouth, on the following day. William Gale obtained leave to spend his last evening at the porter's lodge, and there he talked very seriously, with Mrs. Dickson, over his future prospects.  \"I know,\" he said, \"from Dana's book, that the life is a very rough one, but that will not matter. A sailor, when he has been four years at sea, can pass his examination as a mate; and I mean to work hard, and pass as soon as I can. I don't care how much I am knocked about, that's nothing; there's a good chance of getting on, in the end.\"  \"You will meet a great many bad boys, Bill; don't you let them lead you into their ways.\"  \"Don't be afraid of that,\" he answered, \"I won't do anything I should be ashamed of, afterwards. You have taught me better.\"  \"I suppose the guardians gave you a Bible, today; they always do, when boys goes out.\"  Will nodded.  \"Be sure you read it often, my boy. You read that, and stick to it, and you won't go far wrong. You know what the parson said, last Sunday:  \"'No one is strong in himself, but God gives strength.'\"  \"I remember,\" Will said. \"I made up my mind, then, that I'd bear it in mind, and act upon it when I could. I think the thought of God, and the thought that I may meet my parents--and they must not be ashamed of me--will help me to be honest, and firm.\"  \"I hope, Bill, you will come, sometimes, and see me, when you are ashore.\"  \"I shall be sure to do that, when I can,\" he answered. \"But of course, I shall have no money, at first; and it may be a long time before I can pay my railway fare here; but you may be sure I will come. Whoever may be my real mother, you are the only mother I ever knew, and no mother could have been kinder. When I grow to be a man, and go to sea in big ships, I will bring you all sorts of pretty things from abroad and, if ever you should want it, you may be sure that my wages will be quite as much yours as if I had been, really, your son!\"  Sam Dickson gave a snort. It was very good of the boy, but he considered it his duty to snub him, in order to counteract what he considered to be the pernicious counsels and treatment of his wife.  \"Fine talk,\" he said, \"fine talk. We shall see.\"  \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Sam Dickson,\" his wife said, wrathfully. \"The boy means what he says, and I believe him. If anything was to happen to you, and that boy was growed up, I believe he would come forward to lend me a helping hand, just as he says, as if he were my son. The gals is good gals, but gals in service have plenty to do with their wages--what with dress, and one thing or another. We must never look for much help from them but, if Bill is doing well, and I ever come to want, I believe as his heart would be good to help, a bit.\"  \"Well,\" the porter said, dryly, \"there's time enough to see about it, yet. I ain't dead, you ain't a pauper, and he ain't a man, not by a long way.\"  \"Well, you needn't go to be short tempered over it, Sam. The boy says as he'll be as good as a son to me, if the time ever comes as how I may want it. There is no call for you to fly out, as if he'd said as he'd poison me, if he'd the chance.  \"Anyhow, you'll write to me regular, won't you, Bill?\"  \"That I will,\" the boy said. \"Every time I gets back to port, I'll write; and you'll write sometimes, won't you? And tell me how you are, and how every one is, schoolmaster and all. They have all been very kind to me, and I have nothing to say against any of them.\"  The next morning William Gale laid aside, for ever, his workhouse dress; and put on a suit of rough blue cloth, fitted for his future work. Then, bidding adieu to all his friends, he--with his five fellow apprentices--started by rail, under charge of Sam Dickson, for Yarmouth.  The journey itself was, to them, a most exciting event. They had, in all their remembrance, never been a mile from the workhouse; and the swift motion of the train, the changing scenery, the villages and stations, were a source of immense interest. As they neared Yarmouth their excitement increased, for now they were nearing the sea; of which they had read so much, but could form so little idea. They were disappointed, however, inasmuch as no glimpse was obtained of it, as they crossed the flat country leading to the town but, failing the sea, Yarmouth itself--the town which was henceforth to be their headquarters--was in the highest degree interesting.  Presently the train reached the station, and then Sam Dickson--who had made many annual journeys to Yarmouth, on the same errand--at once started off with them to the smack owners who had written to the workhouse. These lived at Gorleston, a large village on the south side of the river. Walking down from the station, the boys caught a glimpse of the river, and were delighted at the sight of the long line of smacks, and coasters, lying by the wharves opposite.  Presently they left the road, and made their way down to the river side. Their guardian had great difficulty in getting them along, so interested were they in the smacks lying alongside. Presently they stopped at a large wooden building, over which was the name of \"James Eastrey.\"  \"Here we are,\" Sam Dickson said. \"Now, stop quietly outside. I will call three of you up, when I have spoken to Mr. Eastrey.\"  Presently the porter re-appeared at the door, and called three of the boys in. William Gale was one of the number, James Eastrey being the name of the owner to whom he had signed his indentures.  A smell of tar pervaded the whole place. Nets, sails, and cordage were piled in great heaps in the store; iron bolts and buckets, iron heads for trawls, and ship's stores of all kinds.  Mr. Eastrey came out from a little wooden office.  \"So,\" he said, \"you are the three lads who are going to be my apprentices. Well, boys, it is a rough life but, if you take the ups and downs as they come, it is not a bad one. I always tell my captains to be kind to the boys but, when they are at sea, they do not always act as I wish them. When you are on shore, between the voyages, I give you eight shillings a week, to keep yourselves; or I put you in the Smack Boys' Home, and pay for you there. The last is the best place for you, but some boys prefer to go their own way.  \"I suppose you are all anxious to go to sea--boys always are, for the first time. One of my boats is going out, tomorrow.  \"You,\" he said, pointing to William Gale, \"shall go in her. What is your name?\"  \"William Gale, sir.\"  \"Very well, William Gale, then you shall be off first. The others will only have a day or two to wait.  \"I can only send one new hand in each smack. The others will go to the Home, till the smacks are ready. I will send a man with them, at once. They can have a day to run about the town. I shall find plenty of work for them, afterwards.  \"You, Gale, will stop on the smack. I will take you on board, in half an hour, when I have finished my letter.\"  The three lads said goodbye to their comrades and to Sam Dickson. A sailor was called up, and took two off to the Smack Boys' Home; and Will Gale sat down on a coil of rope, to wait till his employer was ready to take him down to the craft to which he was, henceforth, to belong.    Chapter 3: Life On A Smack.   \"Now come"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21979"],["title","For Name and Fame; Or, Through Afghan Passes (#5)"],["body",", Gale,\" Mr. Eastrey said, at last, \"the Kitty is close by.\"  Following his master, the lad went out from the store and along the wharf and, presently, stepped upon a smack on which several men, and a boy, were at work.  \"Harvey,\" Mr. Eastrey said, \"I have brought you a new lad. He will sail with you, tomorrow. I have a very good account of him, and I think you will find him quick, and ready.\"  \"So as he's not up to tricks, I shall do very well with him, I don't doubt,\" the skipper said; \"but boys are an awful trouble, the first voyage or two. However, I will do my best for him.  \"Are you ready to begin work at once, young 'un? What is your name?\"  \"William Gale, and I am quite ready.\"  \"Very well, Bill, chuck off your jacket, then, and pass those bags along from the wharf.\"  The boy was soon hard at work. He was a little disappointed at finding that the skipper was, in dress and manner, in no way superior to the rest of the crew. The Kitty was a yawl of forty-five tons, deep in the water and broad in the beam. Her deck was dirty and, at present, in disorder; and she did not come up to the perfection of neatness and cleanliness which William Gale had read of, in the pages of his favorite author. However--as he told himself--there must, of course, be a good deal of difference between a man of war, where the crew have little to do but to keep things neat and bright, and a fishing smack.  The work upon which he was, at present, engaged was the transferring of the provisions for the voyage from the quay to the hold. These consisted principally of barrels of salt meat, and bags of biscuits; but there were a large tin of tea, a keg of sugar, a small barrel of molasses--or treacle--two or three sacks of potatoes, pepper and salt. Then there was a barrel of oil for the lamps, coils of spare rope of different sizes, and a number of articles of whose use William Gale had not the most remote idea.  After two hours' work, the skipper looked at his watch.  \"Time to knock off work,\" he said, \"and we've got pretty near everything on board. Now, be sure you are all here by six in the morning. Tide will begin to run out at eight, and I don't want to lose any of it.  \"Bill, you are to come home with me, for the night.\"  It was but a hundred yards to the sailor's cottage, which stood on the edge of the sharp rise, a short distance back from the river.  \"Here, wife,\" he said as he entered, \"I've got a new apprentice, and I expect he's pretty hungry; I am, I can tell you, and I hope tea's ready. His name's Bill, and he's going to stop here, tonight.\"  \"Tea is quite ready, John, and there's plenty of mackerel. I thought you would not be getting them again, for a spell.  \"Do you like fish?\" she asked the boy.  \"I don't know, ma'am--I never tasted them.\"  \"Bless me!\" the woman cried, in astonishment; \"never tasted fish! To think, now!\"  \"I've been brought up in a workhouse,\" William said, coloring a little as he spoke, for he knew the prejudice against the House.  \"Ah!\" she said, \"we have had a good many of that sort; and I can't say as I likes 'em, for the most part. But you haven't got the look about you. You don't seem that sort.\"  \"I hope I shall turn out none the worse for it,\" the boy said; \"at any rate, I'll do my best.\"  \"And none can't do more,\" the good woman said, briskly. \"I like your looks, Bill, and you've a nice way of talking. Well, we shall see.\"  In a few minutes tea was upon the table, and Will sat down with the skipper, his wife, and two daughters--girls of ten and twelve. The lad enjoyed his meal immensely, and did full justice to the fish.  \"You will have plenty of them, before you eat your next tea on shore. We pretty nigh live on them, when we are on the fishing grounds.\"  \"The same kind of fish as this?\"  \"No, mackerel are caught in small boats, with a different sort of gear, altogether. We get them, sometimes, in the trawl--not shoals of 'em, but single fish, which we call horse mackerel.\"  After tea, the skipper lit his pipe; and his wife, after clearing up, took some knitting, and sat down and began to question the new apprentice.  \"It's lucky, for you, you found such a good friend,\" she said, when he had finished his story. \"That's how it is you are so different from other boys who have been apprenticed from the House. I should never have thought you had come from there.  \"And she gave you good advice as to how you should go on, I'll be bound.\"  \"Yes, ma'am,\" Will said, \"and I hope I shall act up to it.\"  \"I hope so, Bill; but you'll find it hard work to keep yourself as you should do, among them boys. They are an awful lot, them smack boys.\"  \"Not worse nor other boys,\" her husband said.  \"Not worse than might be looked for, John, but they are most of 'em pretty bad. The language they use make my blood run cold, often. They seems to take a delight in it. The hands are bad enough, but the boys are dreadful.  \"I suppose you don't swear, Will. They look too sharp after you, in the House; but if you take my advice, boy, don't you ever get into the way of bad language. If you once begin, it will grow on you. There ain't no use in it, and it's awful to hear it.\"  \"I will try not to do so,\" Will said firmly. \"Mother--I always call her mother--told me how bad it was, and I said I'd try.\"  \"That's right, Will, you stick to that, and make up your mind to keep from liquor, and you'll do.\"  \"What's the use of talking that way?\" the skipper said. \"The boy's sure to do it. They all do.\"  \"Not all, John. There's some teetotalers in the fleet.\"  \"I won't say I'll never touch it,\" Will said, \"for I don't know, yet, how I may want it--they say when you are cold and wet through, at sea, it is really good--but I have made up my mind I'll never drink for the sake of drinking. Half the men--ay, nineteen out of twenty in the House--would never have been there, I've heard mother say, if it hadn't been for drink; and I told her she need never fear I'd take to that.\"  \"If you can do without it on shore, you can do without it at sea,\" the skipper said. \"I take it when I'm on shore, but there's not a drop goes out on the Kitty. Some boats carries spirits, some don't. We don't. The old man puts chocolate on board instead and, of a wet night, a drink of hot chocolate's worth all the rum in the world.  \"As for giving it up altogether, I see no call for it. There are men who can't touch liquor, but they must go on till they get drunk. That sort ought to swear off, and never touch it at all. It's worse than poison, to some. But for a man who is content with his pint of beer with his dinner, and a glass of grog of an evening, I see no harm in it.\"  \"Except that the money might be better spent, John.\"  \"It might be, or it might not. In my case, the saving would be of no account. The beer costs three pence, and the rum as much more. That's six pence a day. I'm only at home ten days, once every two months; so it come to thirty shillings a year, and I enjoy my dinner, and my evening pipe, all the better for them.\"  \"The thing is this, Will: you don't know, when you begin, whether you are going to be one of the men who--like my John--is content with his pint of beer, and his glass of grog; or whether you will be one of them as can't touch liquor without wanting to make beasts of themselves. Therefore the safest plan is, don't touch it at all--leastways, till you've served your time. The others may laugh at you, at first; but they won't like you any the worse for it.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am. I will make up my mind to that--not to touch liquor till I am out of my apprenticeship. After that, I can see for myself.\"  \"That's right, lad. When you come back from your first trip, you can join the lodge, if you like. I and my girls are members.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Will said; \"but I won't take any pledge. I have said I will not do it, and I don't see any use in taking an oath about it. If I am so weak as to break my word, I should break my oath. I don't know why I shouldn't be able to trust myself to do as I am willed, in that way as in any other. If I'd a craving after it, it might be different; but I never have tasted it, and don't want to taste it, so I don't see why I can't trust myself.\"  \"Yes, I think as how you can trust yourself, Will,\" the woman said, looking at him; \"and I've noticed often that it isn't them who say most, as do most.  \"Now, I daresay you are sleepy. There's my boy's bed for you. He is fourth hand in one of the smacks at sea.\"  The next morning Will was out of bed the instant he was called, excited at the thought that he was going really to sea. The skipper's wife had tea made, and the table laid.  \"Here,\" she said, \"are some oilskin suits my boy has given up. They will suit you well enough for size and, although they are not as good as they were, they will keep out a good deal of water, yet. You will get half-a-crown a week, while you are at sea so, by the time you get back, you will have enough to buy yourself a fresh suit.\"  Half an hour later Will was at work, getting two spare sails and the last of the stores on board.  \"Now, Bill, come below,\" the skipper said. \"I will show you your bunk.\"  The cabin was larger than Will had expected. It was about twelve feet square, and lofty enough for a tall man to stand upright. By the side of the companion stairs was a grate, on which a kettle was boiling; and this, as he afterwards learned, was a fixture, except when cooking was going on, and the men could have tea whenever they chose. Round three sides of the cabin extended lockers, the tops forming seats. Above were what looked like cupboards, running round the sides; but the skipper pushed open a sliding door, and showed a bed place.  \"That is your bunk,\" he said. \"You see, there are two at the end, and one each side, above, and as many under them--eight bunks, in all. You will have to help Jack--that is the other boy--in cooking, and make yourself useful, generally, in the day. The crew are divided into two watches, but you"]]]
