The stomach, _i´_, is very different in outline from what was seen in the last stage described, figure 6A. Instead of having approximately the form of the typical mammalian stomach it is now so elongated that the opening into the duodenum, the pylorus, _py_, seems to be nearer the anterior than the posterior end. While the position of the pylorus is very distinct it is difficult to distinguish the line of demarkation between the stomach and the oesophagus.  The extreme caudal region of the stomach is enlarged to form a blind sac, representing the gizzard, _gz_. A slight enlargement in the region of the pylorus may represent the glandular region of the adult stomach. The stomach opens, in a rather curious way, into the side of the duodenum, _d_, the anterior end of the latter structure having the appearance of a sort of caecum, to be seen in the next stage of development.  The duodenum, _d_, makes a U-shaped bend at the side of the stomach, and then, in the region of the caudal edge of the gizzard, _gz_, dips suddenly ventrad and caudad towards the umbilical cord, _u_, where it apparently ends blindly, though this appearance is probably due to an artifact in the embryo from which the reconstruction was made. It is likely that, in removing the embryo from the yolk, the connection between the two loops, _i_, of the intestine was broken.  The ascending intestinal loop is of slightly less caliber than the descending loop above mentioned; it passes dorsal and cephalad to the posterior border of the gizzard where its lumen is continuous, for a short distance, with that of the descending loop above described. This unusual condition is probably abnormal, but owing to lack of material only one series of this stage was studied.  At the dorso-caudal angle of the gizzard the small intestine, _i_, opens into the ventral side of a larger tube which may be called the large intestine, _il_. The blind end of the large intestine, cephalad to the opening of the small intestine, projects forward, dorsal to the gizzard, as a sort of caecum, _ce_, though this structure is generally stated to be wanting in the crocodilia, and is not seen in the next stage.  From the caecum the large intestine passes in a ventro-caudal direction, with gradually decreasing caliber, to the cloaca, from whose anterior wall the intromittent organ, _io_, projects.  From the ventral wall of the large intestine, at a point about one-third the distance from the cloaca to the caecum, projects ventrad and cephalad the stalk of the allantois, _al_. Owing to its thin walls and small lumen the allantois was traced only a short distance into the umbilical stalk.  The profile of the liver, _li_, has, at this stage, about the same area and even outline as that of the lung. It lies, of course, on both sides of the enteron proper, and overlaps, anteriorly, as has been said, the posterior end of the lung.  Figure 7A represents a section through the plane 305 of figure 7. A considerable advance in the general development of the organs is seen over the last stage studied. The spinal column is well outlined in cartilage, and the ribs are cut at various places, _r_. In the body wall a considerable differentiation of muscular tissue has taken place, but it is only faintly shown in this series of figures. The scales, especially along the mid-dorsal line, are shown as an area of less closely dotted tissue.  The lungs, _lu_, cut here through their anterior ends, are large, but do not nearly fill the cavities, _bc_, in which they lie; they have the sacculated appearance characteristic of embryonic lung tissue.  The oesophagus, _oe_, is cut through about its middle region, where its caliber is greatest. As was said above, its dorso-ventral diameter is more than twice its lateral diameter, caused partly by the oblique angle at which it was cut. Its wall, figure 7H, is very thin and exhibits a dense layer of mesoblastic tissue, in which circular and longitudinal muscle layers are beginning to differentiate. It is lined by an epithelium which here consists of a single layer of columnar or cuboidal cells with large nuclei. On the ventral side, where the oesophageal wall is in contact with that of the trachea the epithelium is somewhat thickened by an increase in the number of cell layers. With the low magnification used these details could not, of course, be shown.  The trachea, _ta_, is of much smaller caliber than the oesophagus, especially in its dorso-ventral diameter. While its epithelial lining is not yet appreciably different from that of the oesophagus, its connective tissue wall is much thicker and shows numerous condensations, the rudiments of the cartilaginous rings. In the region represented by this figure the connective tissue layers of the trachea and oesophagus are continuous with each other, but cephalad and caudad to this point they are distinct, though sometimes in contact. Several large blood vessels, _bv_, on each side of the oesophagus probably represent the carotids and jugulars, but they were not worked out to determine with certainty which they were.  Eighty-five sections (figure 7, _X_) caudad to the one under discussion the trachea divides into the two bronchi. These bronchi gradually separate from each other until, at the point at which they open into the lungs, about eighty sections caudad to their point of separation, they lie on either side of the ventral third of the oesophagus.  Figure 7B represents a section through the plane 480 of figure 7. The section is just cephalad to the heart, and passes through the caudal third of the lungs, _lu_, which have the same appearance as in the preceding figure; also through the extreme cephalic end of the liver, _li_. The lungs here much more nearly fill the body cavity than in the preceding figure. The section being caudad to their openings into the lungs the bronchi do not, of course, show.  The oesophagus, _oe_, is here of much less diameter than in the preceding figure, but is still laterally compressed. Its wall is somewhat thicker than in the more cephalic region, the increase being mainly due to the greater thickness of the connective tissue layer, though the epithelium is also slightly thicker because of an increase in the length of the lining cells. Instead of lying almost entirely ventrad to the lungs, as in the preceding figure, the oesophagus here lies directly between them.  Figure 7C represents a section through the plane 627 of figure 7. The plane of the section passes through the opening of the stomach, _i´_, into the duodenum, _d_. The cross section of the stomach is somewhat larger than that of the oesophagus, but it differs from the more anterior region mainly in the character of its walls. These are much thicker than in the oesophagus; in the mesoblast which forms the greater part of their thickness, muscle fibers are beginning to differentiate. The epithelial layer also is thicker than in the oesophagus; it consists of tall columnar cells that, at places, are thrown into small folds, figure 7I. These folds, even under the low magnification used, are more evident than is shown in the present figure. The pylorus, _py_, is wide and, as has been noted in connection with figure 7, is situated far cephalad to the caudal end of the stomach. It opens into the side rather than into the end of the duodenum, which projects cephalad as a short blind pouch, _d_. The stomach and duodenum, in this section, are almost completely surrounded by the liver, _li_.  Figure 7D represents a section through the plane 680 of figure 7.  The stomach, _i´_, which is cut through its middle region, is somewhat larger than in the preceding figures, though its walls have about the same character. Its outer walls are continuous, to a considerable extent, with the tissue of the surrounding body wall, especially in the region just caudad to the plane of the present section.  The duodenum, being cut through a double loop (see figure 7), is seen in two places, dorsally where it is cut through the edge of one loop, and ventrally where it is cut square across. In both sections the structure is the same, as might be expected, figure 7J. The surrounding mesoblast is differentiated into muscle fibers, figure 7J, _ml_, which form a fairly distinct layer; inside of this layer is a tall columnar epithelium, _ep´_, which is thrown into prominent folds. A thin layer of mesoblast, probably the submucosa, _sl_, lies beneath the epithelium and projects up into the folds. About ten or twelve folds are seen in any one section; only the larger ones are well seen in figure 7D.  Figure 7E shows a section through the plane 770 of figure 7. It is in the region of the umbilicus, _u_, and the extreme caudal end of the stomach which has been called the gizzard, _gz_. The small size of the gizzard is due to its being cut near its caudal margin. The enteron is here cut in no less than seven places: the reason for this will be evident on examination of the plane of the section as shown in figure 7. Dorsal to the gizzard the section cuts the so-called caecum, _ce_, a little nearer its anterior end than is shown in figure 7. The duodenum, _d_, is cut at five points, and has about the same structure as in the preceding figure. The character of the duodenal loops that causes the rather curious appearance of the present figure will be readily understood by reference to figure 7, though the reconstruction is not mathematically accurate. The ventral projection of the lower loops of the duodenum into the umbilicus is seen both in the present figure and in the reconstruction. The loop of the duodenum that, in the sections, is seen to lie directly ventrad to the gizzard, in the reconstruction is shown too much to the side of the latter organ. The descending loops of the duodenum are cut in such a way that the surrounding mesoblast forms a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22327"],["title","Development of the Digestive Canal of the American Alligator (#5)"],["body","mass of tissue.  Figure 7F represents a section through the plane 901 of figure 7. The section passes through the kidneys, _k_, the edge of one posterior appendage, _pa_, the large intestine, _il_, and two regions of the small intestine, _i_.  The large intestine is here a thick walled, cylindrical structure, _il_, hanging from a thin mesentery, _ms_, in the much reduced body cavity. The layers of its wall are much more fully differentiated than in the more anterior regions of the enteron. The epithelium is here stratified instead of simple columnar, and the folds into which it is thrown are broader and less numerous than in the duodenum above described.  Ventrad to the large intestine, and almost in contact with it, is seen the allantois, _al_, whose general outline was noted in connection with figure 7. It is an irregular structure, consisting of a very thin outer layer of mesoderm, lined with a single layer of flattened epithelial cells.  Lying at a considerable distance ventrad to the main body of the section, are seen the two sections of the small intestine, _i_, surrounded by irregular strands of tissue from the umbilicus. The structure of these two intestinal loops is about the same as in the more anterior region described above.  Figure 7G, the last of this series, represents a section through the cloaca, caudad to the urinary openings, in the plane 1060 of figure 7. The epithelium of the cloaca is, of course, simply a continuation of that of the surface of the body, somewhat thickened, perhaps, in the deeper regions.  The intromittent organ, _io_, which projects cephalad from the wall of the cloaca, is here seen as a three-pointed body of considerable size, projecting ventrally from the body.  Figure 8 shows in outline the enteron, from the ventral aspect, of an embryo of 20 cm. total length, or at about the time of hatching. The drawing was made from a dissection and, for the sake of simplicity, only the enteron, respiratory organs, heart, and thymus are shown. The jaw is cut through on the left side and is turned over to the right, thus bringing into view the roof of the mouth, _m_, and the dorsal side of the tongue, _tn_. At the same time the pharynx, _ph_, and the wide anterior end of the oesophagus, _oe_, are cut open, exposing the glottis, _gs_, and vocal cords, _vc_.  The lungs, _lu_, and trachea, _ta_, which are now fully formed, are dissected loose and drawn over to the right side of the animal, together with the heart, _ht_, and the thymus, _ty_; only one side of the thymus is shown, the other half being hidden by the trachea.  The mouth has reached nearly the outline of the adult. The lips are formed and, in the anterior part of the lower jaw, four tooth rudiments, _to_, are externally visible. The mucous membrane of the roof of the mouth, _m_, is covered with rounded papillae, easily seen with a lens but not shown in the figure. The tongue, _tn_, is fully formed, and is free anteriorly and laterally to about the extent that is seen in the adult; the papillae with which it is covered are not so prominent as those seen on the roof of the mouth. At the base of the tongue is the prominent transverse fold, noted in connection with figure 7, that meets above the velum palitinum, not shown here but shown in figure 7. Caudad to these folds is seen the glottis, _gs_, a triangular opening with the vocal cords, _vc_, at its base.  The mucosa of the inside of the pharynx and the anterior end of the oesophagus, exposed by the dissection, is thrown into numerous longitudinal folds, not shown in the figure; these well-marked folds extend throughout the length of the oesophagus.  The oesophagus, _oe_, tapers gradually from the wide pharynx, _ph_, and then continues as a cylindrical tube of uniform diameter to the right side of the anterior end of the stomach, where it opens into the latter organ. Its walls are thick, and its lumen is almost obliterated by the longitudinal folds of the mucosa, mentioned above.  The stomach, _i´_, is oval in outline, though somewhat flattened laterally; it is depressed, dorso-ventrally, to a little more than half the lateral diameter. As has been said, the oesophagus enters its right anterior border; the pylorus is on the right side, 3 or 4 mm. caudad to the oesophageal opening. The wall of the stomach is comparatively thin except in the region of the oesophageal and pyloric apertures, and at a point, opposite these apertures, on the left side. At the latter point is an oval or disc-shaped area that is several times as thick as the surrounding wall; it probably represents the gizzard structure of the adult. The thickening mentioned in the region of the two apertures seems to be mainly due to a wrinkling of the mucosa which, in other parts of the stomach, is nearly smooth, so far as can be seen with the naked eye. A sphincter thickening around the oesophageal and, to some extent, around the pyloric aperture, causes each of these structures to project into the stomach like an ileo-caecal valve.  The pylorus, _py_, opens into a small, pointed, thin-walled diverticulum, _di_, and, at the same time, into the duodenum, _d_. The diverticulum noted, also, in connection with figure 7, has relatively thick, wrinkled walls; its significance is not known to the writer. From this diverticulum the duodenum, _d_, leads caudad and laterad for a short distance as a narrow tube, then suddenly expands into the widest part of the entire intestine. Into this wide part of the duodenum, 3 or 4 mm. from the pylorus, opens the bile duct, _bd_. The bile sac, _bs_, is an elongated oval body with thin walls, lying to the right of the pylorus, its connection with the liver was not seen.  Lying between the anterior end of the duodenum and the posterior end of the stomach, and extending caudad for 10 to 15 mm., in the median plane of the animal is the pancreas, _pan_. It is a long narrow body of a whitish color; its duct or ducts could not be determined by dissection. The duodenum extends caudad, with gradually diminishing caliber, from the enlarged region mentioned above. About 10 to 15 mm. caudad to the stomach it makes a sort of double loop to the right, a wide loop, _lp_, and a close one, _lp´_, nearer the median plane. From the latter loop the intestine extends straight to the left, for a distance of about 10 mm., where it makes a small loop cephalad, _lp^2_, and then opens to the yolk-sac, _y_. The yolk-sac is shown here simply as an irregular piece of tissue, the yolk having been removed.  The anterior intestinal portal, _aip_, and posterior intestinal portal, _pip_, are in close proximity with each other.  From the posterior intestinal portal the intestine extends straight cephalad to the posterior end of the stomach, dorsal to which it forms a double loop, a wider one, _lp^3_, and a narrow one, _lp^4_. From the latter loop, _lp^4_, the intestine extends straight caudad, parallel and near to the straight region leading from the posterior intestinal portal, until it reaches the region of the loop _lp^2_, dorsal to which it forms a small loop, _lp^5_. From loop _lp^5_ the intestine, which is here of very small caliber, extends caudad for about 10 mm., where it forms another indistinctly double loop, _lp^6_.  From loop _lp^6_ the large intestine, _il_, extends, with gradually increasing caliber, to the cloaca, _cl_, a distance of 10 to 15 mm.  Except in the enlarged region near the pylorus the lumen of the intestine is almost obliterated by the folding of its thick walls, so that little or nothing can be told of its lining with the naked eye.  A distinct mesentery holds the loops of the intestine in position and binds the entire enteron close to the dorsal body wall. Because of the lack of properly fixed tissue no sections of the enteron of this stage were made.     REFERENCES   1. BRONN, H. G.: Klassen des Thier-Reichs. (Vols. on reptiles.) 1890.  2.
