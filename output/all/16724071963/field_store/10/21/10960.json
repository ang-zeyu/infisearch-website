Owing to the coiling of the end of the long tail the plane of the section, as is seen in figure 5I, passes through the posterior end of the embryo no less than four times. In the most posterior of these four sections of the tail, beginning slightly caudad to the section here shown, is seen a small cavity which may be called the post-anal gut, _pag_. It has thick walls, and extends for about thirty-five sections in the series under discussion. Its lumen is very large in its caudal region, figure 5I, _pag_, and tapers gradually cephalad until it disappears. Posteriorly the post-anal gut ends quite abruptly not very far from the extreme tip of the tail.  Figure 5J is a composite drawing from reconstructions of the enterons of two embryos of approximately this stage. One of these reconstructions was plotted on paper from a series of transverse sections; the other was made in wax from a series of sagittal sections. For the sake of simplicity the gill clefts are not represented, and the pharynx, mouth, and liver are represented in outline only. For the same reason the lung rudiment of one side only is shown.  The relative size of the pharynx, _ph_, as seen in the figure, is smaller than it is in reality because of the small dorso-ventral diameter (the only one here shown) compared to the lateral diameter. The end of the lung rudiment, _lu_, is slightly enlarged and lies in a plane nearer to the observer than that of the oesophagus, _oe_, though this is not well shown in the figure.  The oesophagus, _oe_, diminishes slightly in caliber for a short distance caudad to the origin of the lungs, then gradually increases in caliber until it suddenly bends to the side (towards the observer) and merges into the wide stomach, _i´_. The stomach, which is irregularly conical in shape, lies in a place slightly nearer the observer than the end of the lung rudiment mentioned above.  Lying to one side of the stomach and duodenum, and extending cephalad beyond the end of the lung rudiment is the liver, _li_, whose outline is only roughly shown here by the broken line. The stomach opens rather abruptly into the duodenum, _d_, which slopes back towards the plane of the oesophagus (away from the observer).  The projection from the side of the duodenum, _pan_, not well figured here, indicates the position of the pancreas, better shown in the next reconstruction. The duodenum extends only a short distance caudad to this point and then opens, _aip_, to the yolk-sac.  The yolk-stalk, or unclosed region of the enteron, is still of considerable extent, though its exact boundaries are not easy to determine. The distance between the anterior and posterior intestinal portals is approximately shown in the figure under discussion.  The hindgut is cylindrical in cross section and of about the same diameter throughout, except for a slight enlargement in the cloacal region.  The post-anal gut is not shown here; it will be described in connection with the next reconstruction where it is figured.  Figure 6 is a surface view in profile of an embryo of the next stage to be studied. The manus and pes are here well developed, and the general development of the embryo is in considerable advancement over the last stage studied.  Figure 6A represents a reconstruction, from a series of transverse sections, of the enteron of an embryo of about the age of the one shown in figure 6. The outlines of the entire embryo, of the eye, _e_, and of the anterior, _aa_, and posterior, _pa_, appendages are shown by broken lines. Its position being coincident with that of the stomach, liver, and pancreas, the anterior appendage can scarcely be seen. The enteron, including one lung only, for the sake of simplicity, is shaded solid black, while the liver and pancreas, with their ducts, are outlines with unbroken lines. As in the preceding reconstruction no attempt is made to show the gill clefts, and only the dorso-ventral profile of the enteron is shown. Caudad to the pharynx, the enteron being more or less cylindrical in section, this profile gives a good idea of its shape, but in the pharyngeal region, where the lateral diameter is so much greater than the dorso-ventral, the reconstruction gives but a poor idea of the size of that part of the enteron.  The widely-open mouth, _m_, leads, with no line of demarkation, into the pharynx, _ph_, which is of irregular outline and, as has been said, of much greater lateral than dorso-ventral diameter.  The pharynx becomes gradually constricted to form the oesophagus, _oe_, a very long and slender structure, which, as will be seen in cross section, is, at this stage, solid for the greater part of its length. As in the case of the pharynx, the lateral diameter of the oesophagus is generally greater than the dorso-ventral diameter.  From the floor of the caudal part of the pharynx is pushed out the trachea, _ta_. In the reconstruction, especially in the anterior end, the trachea appears several times the diameter of the oesophagus; this is due to the great thickness and indefiniteness of its walls rather than to a greater diameter of its lumen.  At about the position of the line _ta_ the trachea divides into the two bronchi (only one shown in the figure), which are somewhat enlarged at the ends to form the lung rudiments, _lu_. While the trachea and bronchi lie ventrad to the oesophagus, the lungs lie laterad and even dorsad to the oesophagus and cardiac end of the stomach. Caudad to the heart and in the region of the anterior appendages, _aa_, the oesophagus suddenly enlarges to form the stomach, _i´_, which has now quite the outline of the typical human stomach.  From the stomach the duodenum, _d_, extends, following a sort of V-shaped course, towards the yolk-stalk, _ys_. In the region of the yolk-stalk it is somewhat enlarged and ends in a blind sac like a caecum. At the side of this sac is seen the opening of the enteron to the yolk-stalk; the anterior and posterior intestinal portals are not distinguishable from each other. From this point the hindgut, _hg_, extends cephalad until it lies laterad to the middle region of the duodenum, then bends through 180° and extends, in an almost straight line, to the cloaca, _cl_, lying in the region of the posterior appendage, _pa_.  The allantois, _al_, extends cephalad for some distance from the floor of the cloaca. Some distance caudad to the cloaca, near the end of the much coiled tail, is seen the post-anal gut, _pag_. This structure as has been noted above, is quite distinct from the other parts of the enteron. It is of elongated, pyriform outline, with the pointed end extending cephalad.  In the narrow space between the stomach and the duodenum is the elongated pancreas, _pan_, opening by two or more short ducts into the duodenum.  The liver, _li_, in the figure under discussion, has about twice the area of the stomach. It extends caudad and dorsal about the same distance as the latter organ, but it extends ventrad and cephalad far beyond the boundaries of the stomach.  Extending along the ventral border of the liver is a long narrow duct, apparently the bile duct, _bd_. It connects, caudally, with the anterior end of the pancreas, while at its other extremity, near the antero-ventral corner of the liver; it ends blindly.  The transverse sections now to be described have been selected from the series from which the reconstruction, just described, was made.  Figure 6B represents a typical section through the pharynx. Its plane is approximately shown by the line 400 of figure 6A though the plane apparently does not cut the eye, _e_. The pharynx, _ph_, has here the outline of an irregular V. Its walls, except at the outer angles of the clefts, _g^1_, are composed of but a single layer of cells. In the dorsal wall these cells are flattened, while in the ventral wall they are more rounded. This difference in the shape of the cells accounts for the slightly greater thickness of the floor over that of the roof of the pharynx. The gill clefts no longer communicate with the exterior.  Figure 6C represents the caudal half of the embryo in the plane 475 of figure 6A. The section of the pharynx, _ph_, is here crescentic in outline, and the pharyngeal walls, especially the floor, are somewhat thicker than in the more anterior section just described. Lying a short distance dorsad to the pharynx are seen two small, thick-walled openings, _ty_; these are the rudiments of the thymus glands. They are here quite distinct from the enteron, and may be traced through a large number of sections, being in some regions solid and of a smaller diameter than in the present section.  Figure 6D is in the region of the line 500 in figure 6A. The thymus rudiments, _ty_, have about the same appearance as in the preceding figure, except that they are somewhat larger. The pharynx, _ph_, is much smaller than in the last section, and though somewhat crescentic in outline, its convex side is dorsal instead of ventral in position. The pharyngeal walls are here thicker, and consist of two or three layers of cells, instead of the single layer of more anterior sections.  In the median plane the floor of the pharynx is pushed down, as a solid tongue of cells, _gs_, the anterior edge of the glottis. Ventrad and laterad to the glottis a crescentic condensation of mesoblast represents the beginning of the laryngeal cartilages, _la_.  Two or three sections caudad to the one just described, the two layers of which the tongue of cells from the floor of the pharynx is composed separate slightly at the bottom to form a small cavity, the trachea, _ta_; this condition is shown in figure 6E, which represents part of a section through the plane 532 of figure 6A.  The oesophagus, _oe_, is here a solid, crescentic mass of cells, the lumen being completely obliterated. The dorsal part of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22327"],["title","Development of the Digestive Canal of the American Alligator (#3)"],["body","of cells, mentioned above, connects the ventral side of the oesophagus with the trachea, like a sort of mesentery. Above the oesophagus, on either side, is the thymus rudiment, _ty_, in this section practically a solid mass of cells instead of a tube. The epithelium of the trachea here consists of three or four layers of compactly arranged cells; this epithelium is surrounded by a dense mass of mesoblast which is responsible for the greater thickness of the trachea as seen in figure 6A. As has been said, the oesophagus here has no lumen, and when examined under high magnification its walls are found to be completely fused, not merely in close contact. The same is true of the tongue of cells between the oesophagus and trachea. Two or three sections caudad to the one under discussion this tongue of cells loses its connection with the trachea, and the latter structure is entirely independent of the oesophagus.  The solid condition of the oesophagus continues through about fifty sections of this series, the horns of the crescent gradually shortening until only the central part remains as the hollow cylinder seen in figure 6F, _oe_, which is a section through plane 650 of figure 6A. From about this point to its opening into the stomach the oesophagus has essentially the same structure. Its epithelium is of the simple columnar type, the cells being long, with generally basally located nuclei.  In the section under discussion the trachea, _ta_, is of about the same size as the oesophagus, but its epithelium is thicker and consists of two or three layers of cells. The trachea extends, as a separate and distinct structure, through about one hundred and fifteen sections, and then, at a point four or five sections caudad to the present section, it divides suddenly into the two bronchial tubes. Each bronchus, like the trachea, is lined with an epithelium of three or four layers of cells; but the epithelium is surrounded by a thin layer of much condensed mesoblast. The bronchi continue caudad, with slightly increasing caliber, through about fifty sections, when they suddenly enlarge to form the lungs. As seen in figure 6A the lungs are irregularly conical in outline and lie on either side of the posterior end of the oesophagus.  Figure 6G is a section through the plane 750 of figure 6A. The oesophagus, _oe_, is seen as a small, circular opening between two much larger openings, the lungs, _lu_. The epithelium of the oesophagus is the same here as in the more anterior regions described above; that of the lung rudiments is very variable in thickness, even in different parts of the same section, being in some places composed of a single layer of cuboidal or even flattened cells, in other places consisting of four or five layers of cells (not well shown in the figure). Surrounding the epithelium of the lung rudiments is a thin layer of quite dense mesoblastic tissue. A fairly well defined mesentery, _ms_, is now present in this region.  Filling the greater part of the body cavity, below the oesophagus and lung rudiments, is the liver, _li_; and ventrad to the liver the section passes through a loop of the duodenum, _d_.  The epithelium of the duodenum consists of four or five layers of compactly arranged cells, near the center of an oval mass of fairly dense mesoblast. In a lateral projection of this mass of mesoblast lies a small, circular opening, the bile duct, _bd_. Its epithelium consists of a single layer of columnar cells. In more anterior sections the bile duct is larger in cross section, being about one-half the diameter of the oesophagus. As has been said it ends blindly at a point a short distance anterior to the antero-ventral edge of the liver. A few sections caudad to the one under discussion the bile duct connects with the liver, figure 6A, _bd´_; and some distance caudad to this the duct opens, _bd´´_, into the duodenum so close to the opening, _pan´_, of the pancreas that it is difficult to determine whether the latter organ has a separate opening into the duodenum or opens into the bile duct.  At some distance ventrad to the structures just described the intestine is cut, by the plane of the section, in two places, _i_. The more dorsal of these is inclosed and has, under this magnification, the same appearance as the duodenum, _d_; a higher magnification, however, shows that its epithelium consists of a single layer of tall, rather clear, columnar cells. The more ventral of the two sections, above mentioned, which is continuous with the dorsal section a very short distance caudad to this point, is in the region that opens to the yolk--in fact a number of yolk-granules, _y_, may be seen in the opening. The epithelium of this part of the intestine consists of a single layer of clear, columnar cells, which, around the borders of the opening, are thrown into numerous folds and are almost of goblet form.  Figure 6H represents a section through the plane 820 of figure 6A. The section is caudad to one lung and cuts the extreme tip of the other, _lu_. The liver, _li_, and pancreas, _pan_, are seen at the side of the stomach, _i´_, here cut through its greatest transverse diameter. The epithelium of the stomach varies somewhat in thickness and consists of two or three layers of cells, the variation in thickness being due to a variation in the length of the cells rather than to a variation in the number of layers.  Ventrad to the stomach the intestine, _i_, is cut in three places, of which the most dorsal section is the largest. The epithelium of these intestinal sections, especially the lower two, consists of usually a single layer of columnar cells which are clearer than those of the stomach. A fairly thin mesentery, _ms_, supports this region of the intestine.  In the region of the posterior appendages, _pa_, the section passes through the hindgut, _hg_, and allantois, _al_. The former is of about the same size as the more anterior sections of the intestine, but its epithelium is less clear and is composed of two or more layers of cells. The allantois is cut near its opening into the hindgut; its walls are thin, the epithelium consisting of but a single layer of more or less flattened cells.  Figure 7 represents a reconstruction of the enteron of an embryo of 42 mm. crown-rump length. Because of the body flexure and large size of the embryo the head was amputated, in the plane _a-b_, and cut sagitally, while the body was cut transversely in the direction shown by the section planes. In the present figure the outline of the embryo, including the eye, appendages, and umbilical stalk, is shown by fine dotted lines; the outlines of the lungs and liver are shown by heavier, broken lines; while the outlines of the enteron proper and the trachea are shown in solid lines, filled in which fine stippling. For the sake of simplicity only one lung and one bronchus are shown.  Since the head has now quite a reptilian form, the oral cavity, _m_, has more or less of the adult outline. A transverse groove near the anterior end of the lower jaw marks off the tongue, _tn_; and the rudiments of teeth are seen but not shown in the figure because of the low magnification used.  The pharynx, _ph_, is a very extensive cavity that is sharply separated from the mouth by a prominent transverse fold of skin, the velum palitum, _vp_, just in front of the posterior nares, _pn_, and by a less marked fold from the base of the tongue; it is these two valves that enable the adult alligator to open its mouth under the surface without getting water into the lungs. The mouth and pharynx are lined at this stage with a thin, stratified epithelium, which consists of a basal layer of rather tall columnar cells and one or two superficial layers of flattened cells. The pharyngeal epithelium is rather thicker than that of the oral cavity.  In the embryo from which this reconstruction was made the pharynx was in direct communication with neither the oesophagus nor the trachea, though the separation in each case was by a mere membrane. The trachea, _ta_, opens, except for this membrane, into the pharynx a short distance back of the transverse, dorsal and ventral folds mentioned above, and almost directly ventrad to the posterior nares. The anterior end of the oesophagus, _oe_, is in contact with the extreme postero-ventral wall of the pharynx.  The trachea, which is already surrounded by distinct cartilaginous rings, is long, and of about the same diameter throughout. In the region of the anterior appendage, at the point marked _X_, it divides into the two very short bronchi, which almost immediately open into the lungs, _lu_. The lungs, whose structure will be shown in the sections of this stage, are large, irregular bodies, extending about equal distances cephalad and caudad to their openings into the bronchi. The caudal ends of the lungs overlap the cephalic end of the liver, _li_.  The oesophagus, _oe_, is large, and is laterally compressed so that its dorso-ventral diameter, the one shown in the present figure, is two or three times as great as its lateral diameter. This gives the impression, in the reconstruction, that the oesophagus is nearly as large as the stomach.  As has been said, the oesophagus does not open directly into the pharynx, but is separated from it by a membrane which consists of the flattened epithelial layers of both cavities separated by a thin layer of mesoblast. This partition between the pharynx and the oesophagus is not a mere fold of mucous membrane, but is a complete, though thin, wall, easily seen in the series of sagittal sections from which this region of the embryo was drawn. The anterior end of the oesophagus is suddenly constricted so that the actual opening closed by this partition is not large.  Followed caudad the dorso-ventral diameter of the oesophagus varies somewhat, as does the lateral diameter, but it remains large throughout and opens into the stomach with no sharp line of demarkation.
