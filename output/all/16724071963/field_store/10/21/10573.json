Why, that's a real bright girl. Well, from each one of these knots nerves go to the muscles of the body.\"  \"It's just like a lot of beads on a string,\" said Hope Stanton.  \"So it is, child. So, you see, if we handle an insect roughly, squeezing it too hard, or breaking a leg or a wing, a message is sent to one of these little beads or knots or nerve cells, and the poor, helpless creature suffers pain.\"  \"But I didn't mean to hurt that butterfly!\"  \"No, of course you didn't. The only way to do,\" said the old man, \"is to catch them in a net. Make it of bobinet with a rounded bottom, sewing it to a wire ring and fastening it to a handle that is the right weight and length for your arm.\"  \"But then, after you caught it, how could you keep it, sir?\" asked Betty.  \"There are two merciful ways,\" said the old man, \"of killing insects, but neither way is safe for children to try. Put a few drops of chloroform on a piece of cotton under a tumbler turned upside down. Put the insect inside. It will soon fall asleep without pain. The other is a cyanide bottle. I have one down at the cabin. It must be kept tightly corked and never smelled. The cyanide in the bottle is hard and dry. Several insects may be put into the bottle at the same time. Once there they die very quickly. After large insects are killed the wings should be folded over the back, and they should be placed in a little case like this. See, I'm folding a piece of paper to form a three-cornered case. Then I bend down one edge to keep the little case closed.\"  At this moment out flew Lizzie with a curtain which she was going to shake.  \"Here, here!\" shouted the old man, \"don't shake that; catch that caterpillar on it. I want it.\"  Lizzie made a good-natured grab at the caterpillar, and then there was a cry of pain. \"Oh, begorra, begorra, I'm stung by a wasp, I am! Ow!\" But she still kept tight hold of the caterpillar as she danced about.  \"No,\" said the guide, \"you're not stung by any wasp. Bring me that! There, open your hand. You see, the caterpillar stung you.\"  \"Oh my, what a beauty!\" exclaimed the children. \"But caterpillars don't sting.\"  \"Oh yes, they do,\" continued Ben Gile, with a twinkle in his eye; \"ask Lizzie.\" Lizzie was looking at the palm of her hand, which showed how badly it had been stung.  \"Now, you see, we'll need something to pick up these little creatures with--a pair of forceps or something of that kind. At least, you must be very careful.\"  \"And what else do we need?\" asked the children.  \"A little hand lens will magnify the small parts of an insect a great deal. It will show you all the tiny hairs on the body, and the little rings and the feelers and the facets of the eyes, and many another wonderful thing.\"  \"What are we going to put the bugs in?\" inquired Jimmie.  \"Lizzie will get you a small wooden box,\" said Mrs. Reece.  Lizzie went off grumbling something about guides and bites and insects, but soon she came back with a nice box, and in a minute all the children's heads were clustered about Ben Gile as he showed them how to line the box with a layer of cork, how to steam the insects a little if they were dry, and then how to put the long, slender pins through the chest of the insect and stick it into the cork.     III  THE LITTLE ARMY   Ben Gile shook his head. As his hair was long and white, and his hands moved with his head, just as if he were a lot of dried branches moving in the wind, it was enough to frighten little Betty. \"Plagues of Egypt! Plagues of Egypt!\" he kept muttering. Now, Betty had been to school a long time--I think it must have been as much as two whole years, which is a very _long_ time for school and a very _short_ time for climbing trees--now, Betty had been to school and knew better. She crept behind a big beech-tree, but she stuck her little head out and said, in a trembling voice:  \"It was locusts, sir, wasn't it--and wild honey?\"  Betty wasn't at all certain that any kind of honey could be a plague.  \"It was locusts, child--yes, you're right,\" answered the old man. \"Locusts it was; but you eat wild honey.\"  Betty came out from behind the tree and whispered, \"You eat them _both_?\"  \"So men did in the Bible,\" said Ben Gile, and washing his sugar-pails, and putting his maple sugar camp--a very sweet place for a little girl to be when there are still piles of maple sugar packed away on the shelves--in order for the summer.  In all her short life Betty had never known another old man like him. In the winter he taught school; in spring he made maple sugar; in summer he was guiding about the ponds or looking up into the trees most of the time; and in the fall he cut wood before he went back to teaching; but what was oddest of all to Betty was that he knew the squirrels and deer and rabbits as well as he seemed to know little girls or little boys. There was a story told in those woods about his taming even a trout so that one morning it hopped out of the water and followed him everywhere he went--hop, hop, flop behind him. And in the evening, as Ben Gile and his tame trout were passing by the pond again, the trout fell in and was drowned. But, dear me, that is a fish story, and you mustn't believe any fish stories whatever except those your father tells! Still, if your grandpa is fond of fishing, you may believe his fish stories, too.  [Illustration: _A._ A locust. _B._ Cast-off skin of a young locust.]  Betty came out farther from behind the tree. \"Please, sir, do _you_ eat grasshoppers?\"  \"Not yet, my dear.\" The old man's eyes twinkled. \"I knew a little boy once\"--Betty was wondering whether this old man had ever been a little boy himself--\"I knew a little boy once who wasn't afraid to swallow even a caterpillar, but I think that little boy never thought of eating a grasshopper.\" The old man shook his head gravely. \"No, not a grasshopper.\"  \"Please, sir,\" said Betty, coming right up to the bucket he was washing in the brook--\"please, sir, do you know any stories about grasshoppers?\"  Ben Gile laid his finger along his nose and thought. Betty was sure he knew a hundred million stories, and that he could tell her something about anything she might ask for in all the world.  \"Well, once upon a time,\" the old man began, \"there was another old man who was a great deal wiser than I am, and a great deal richer, my dear, for he owned a whole kingdom and lived in a palace, and his name was--\"  \"Solomon!\" called out Betty, dancing up and down, out of pride in her own wisdom.  \"Right! And this other old man said:       \"There are four things which are little upon the earth, but      they are exceedingly wise:       \"The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their      meat in the summer;       \"The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses      in the rocks;       \"The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by      bands;       \"The spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings'      palaces.\"  \"But that's not a story.\"  The guide shook his head. \"You don't know a story, child, when you hear one. It began, 'Once upon a time,' didn't it?\"  \"Yes, sir; but please tell me another.\"  \"Well, there are others in the Bible, my dear, about locusts and grasshoppers.\"  \"But, please, sir,\" said Betty, who was almost ready to cry, she was so teased--\"please tell me one of your _own_ stories.\"  Ben Gile began to swash his bucket up and down, up and down, in the stream until the water fairly rocked. Then he pulled the bucket out of the water, set it beside him, and reached out after a locust.  \"Here he is.\" There was a long pause. Betty thought he would never go on. \"Well, once upon a time there was a little army and all its uniforms were brown and green, and from the meanest soldier in the ranks to the lieutenant-commander this little army was made up of insects who belonged to the same tribe. Let me see--there were the grasshoppers and the locusts and the katydids and the crickets.\"  \"Please, sir, were they cousins?\"  \"I think they were, my dear. Yes, first cousins, and, unlike even my first cousins, they all have wings, and straight wings like this.\"  The guide gently spread out one of the wings.  \"Just where the back of your chest is these wings grow--two pairs of wings, my dear, and two pairs of wings mean a good deal more than two pairs of new shoes. This first pair is straight and narrow and hard, because it is meant to cover the gauzy wings underneath. Puff!\"  Away flew the locust.  \"You see, he doesn't use his first pair, but holds them out straight from his body while he spreads out the gauzy ones like a--like a--\"  \"Fan!\" shouted Betty, quite forgetting the tiny squirrel who had come up near her, and, at her shout, nearly jumped out of his little red jacket.  \"A yellow fan,\" said the old man. \"And some have a red fan. Well, I think,\" said he, reaching for his pail, \"there isn't going to be any more of this story.\"  \"Not any more? But there must be more, sir; I've seen hundreds and hundreds of them on a dusty road, and, please, they're just the color of the dirt.\"  The guide shook his head. \"Not to-day.\"  By this time Betty was so eager to have him go on that she had forgotten all about being afraid of him. \"And when they whir up from the road, sir, they say, 'Clack! clack! clack!'\"  The old man made a sound like the noise of a locust.  \"How does it make its mouth move, sir?\"  \"It doesn't make its mouth move, child. It makes the noise by striking the edges of the gauzy wings and hard wing covers together. See, this way!\" And the old man struck his arm and leg together. \"It has another fiddle, too, which it uses when it makes the long, rasping, drowsy sound of summer days. Then it rubs the rough edges of its hind leg against the edge of its wing-cover.\"  \"Please, is it happy, then?\" asked Betty.  \"Just as happy as a healthy locust, who lives in long, sweet-smelling grass and is contented with his own"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21948"],["title","Little Busybodies: The Life of Crickets, Ants, Bees, Beetles, and Other (#3)"],["body","nging, can be, and that is very happy.\"  \"Oh!\" said Betty, \"it doesn't use its mouth, then? Jimmie said it did.\"  \"Jimmie's a stupid boy. See this fellow.\" The old man held the locust toward Betty. \"With its upper lip, broad, you see; and there is the lower lip made in two scallops, and there's a short feeler on either side, and another pair of soft jaws with a feeler. Hidden away under those parts is a pair of dark-brown, horny jaws which open like two big swinging gates.\"  \"What makes them so big?\"  \"The better to eat you with, my dear.\" The guide worked his jaws until Betty, half afraid and half pleased, screamed and ran behind a tree. \"Oh, how they can eat!\" growled the old man, \"more than any little girl or boy I ever knew! Years and years ago, when your mamma was a baby, they mounted up into the air from the Rocky Mountains and flew eastward in a great cloud. Down they swooped upon the fertile valleys in rustling hordes, and ate everything in sight--grass, grains, vegetables, and bushes. They ate and ate and ate until they had eaten up fifty million dollars' worth of food, and the poor farmer could hear nothing but the sound of the chewing of those ever-swinging jaws. Now, be off, little girl, or my pails won't be clean.\"  \"Oh, please, sir, just tell me how they jump and breathe.\"  \"Dear, dear, see this fellow!\" He had wet a little grain of maple sugar, and a tiny meadow grasshopper which had alighted on his knee was pushing the sweet stuff into its mouth with both fore legs. \"Child, you must never,\" said the old man, savagely, \"push your food in that way.\"  \"Please, sir,\" answered Betty, \"I never do, because I eat with my fork and my knife. Please, sir, are they happy when they jump?\"  \"Looks like a horse, doesn't it?\" asked the old man. \"It's made for jumping. Think of all the training it takes to make a jumper of your brother at school. Well, this chap can jump ten times as far. It's born with a better jump than the longest-legged boy you ever saw. But the locust might get its head cut off when jumping if it weren't for this little saddle that covers the soft part of the neck. Mr. Locust can't always look before he leaps, as a little girl can, and the knife edge of a blade of grass would cut its head right off if it weren't for this saddle. See, here are its long leaping-legs, and on the back edge of these are some spines to keep it from slipping, and the feet are padded with several soft little cushions that keep it from chin-chopping itself to pieces when it lands after a long jump. And here, my dear, are little rest-legs just behind the front legs. With these Mr. Locust hangs on to a blade of grass when tired--a fine idea, child; every little boy and girl ought to have some rest-legs like the locust. And the locust has some extra eyes, too.\"  Ben Gile was going so fast now that Betty was listening to him, mouth open, as he pointed with a blade of grass to one thing after another.  \"You see, the locust has two big eyes, and there in the middle of the forehead it has three little eyes, and with five eyes there isn't much it can't see. And here on the body are two tiny shining oval windows. These are ear-laps, and that, my dear, is the way it hears. And upon the sides of the body (the thorax--that is, just the chest) and his abdomen are tiny holes. The air enters through these, and that is the way Mr. Locust breathes.\"  \"Oh,\" said Betty, \"then it hasn't got any nose? I thought everything in the world had a nose.\"  \"And this little body,\" the old man went on, \"is as strong as a grub hoe. With it the locust makes holes in fence rails, logs, stumps, and the earth, and in those holes mother locust lays her eggs. See, those four spines are for boring holes. With these Mrs. Locust bores a hole in the ground, and then with these same spines she guides the bundles of eggs into the hole and covers them up with a gummy stuff. There the eggs stay until next spring, when, my dear, out comes a little hopper with no wings, and this little hopper is called a nymph. It grows and splits its skin, grows and splits its skin, and with its new skin--it has five or six skins, and leaves all its old clothes hanging around on the bushes--its wings grow bigger and bigger. At last it flies off just as its mother and father did a year ago.\"  Ben Gile tossed the locust into the air and called out, \"Shoo!\" clapping his hands loudly together. Out from the woods came two baby deer, a wise, gentle old cow; from the cabin came a mother cat and three kittens and a big black dog; and from the trees scampered down a half a dozen squirrels.  \"Time for dinner.\"  Betty went up to him and whispered something in his ear. The old man nodded his head solemnly, and the little girl went trotting along the path to Rangeley Village.     IV  FIDDLERS   There was the greatest scurrying around in the fields on the edge of the woods about Ben Gile's cabin. Little girls and boys were flitting hither and thither with pretty nets and small boxes strapped over their shoulders. Inside the boxes there seemed to be just as much hopping about as there was outside.  By-and-by the guide put his head out of his cabin door and called, \"How many have you?\"  \"Oh, lots and lots!\" the children answered.  \"Bring them in.\" And the children trooped into the cabin, which they thought quite the most wonderful place in the world. Its walls were lined with books and cases. The books were not only in English, but also in French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek, and other languages, and the cases were filled with scores of specimens, the most beautiful butterflies, moths, beetles, birds, flowers, and rare stones. The floor of the cabin was covered by different kinds of skins. Besides, there were telescopes, field-glasses, magnifying-glasses, specimen cases, old weapons, and a flute. And by the great wide fireplace, in front of which the guide was cooking biscuits and cookies in a reflector oven, lay several kittens, the old black dog, Thor, and a dappled fawn which Thor was licking.  \"Those crickets sound like pop-guns,\" said the old man, slipping more cookies into the oven and setting a pan of biscuits on a shelf by the hearth.  \"Oh, please,\" said little Hope, \"we've got bushels of them!\"  \"Now we'll let those cookies bake while we 'tend to the fiddlers. Are four pans of cookies enough for five children?\"  \"Yes, yes.\"  \"Now, Hope, let me have your bushel box. H'm,\" he murmured, peeping in, \"all dressed for the party. What color?\"  \"Brown, sir.\"  \"Black, too,\" said Betty; \"and on a few,\" she added, \"there's a stripe or a weeny spot of color.\"  \"Oho!\" exclaimed the old man, \"what have we here?\" He took a pale little creature from Hope's basket.  \"Why, it's white and green tinted,\" called Jimmie. \"That isn't a cricket.\"  \"Isn't it? Well, it's a first cousin which lives in the trees and loves its tree home so much, like the sensible little fellow it is, that it sings 'Tr-e-e-e, tr-e-e-e,' as fast as it can trill all summer long. But it is very harmful to the tree, because when egg-laying time comes it cuts a long slit in the trees in which to lay its eggs. Just a minute!\" The old man shifted the position of the baker, and out came such a good odor of cookies that all the children sniffed with delight. \"Here, Jack,\" he said, to a brown little fellow in ragged clothes and bare feet, \"you have a singer in your box.\"  \"I didn't catch but one,\" said the lad.  \"Briers aren't good for bare legs, are they? Never mind, your crickets won't eat one another.\"  \"Eat one another?\" cried the children.  \"Yes, crickets are cannibals, like some other insects, and they frequently eat a near relation or a friend, as the people in the Fiji Islands used to do. This is a nice brown little chap, Jack. Do you know how he makes his music?\"  [Illustration: _A._ File on wing of cricket. _B._ Scraper on wing of cricket. _C._ Mrs. Cricket.]  \"Why, I suppose,\" said the boy, \"he opens his mouth the way Mr. Tucker does in the church choir, and--\"  There was a shout of laughter from Jimmie, who was sure he knew a great deal.  \"Well,\" said the guide to Jim, \"then how does it make its music, since you know?\"  \"Not with its mouth.\"  \"Then how?\"  \"I don't know, sir,\" stammered Jimmie, who found he didn't know as much as he thought he did.  \"When Mr. Cricket sings,\" went on the hermit, \"it lifts its two wing covers so that the edges meet like the pointed roof of a house. Then your little fiddler, Jack, rubs one edge against the other.\"  All this time Peter Beech had been waving his hand about, the way children do in school, and giving big sniffs.  \"Please, sir, the cookies are burning.\"  \"Bless my soul!\" The guide whisked the cookies away.  \"Please, sir,\" said Jack, \"are we going to have something soon?\" Jack did not look as if he had his share of food to eat, for he was as thin as the fawn which had curled up near him. Jack had twelve brothers and sisters, and a father who wasn't what he ought to be, so there were times when there was no food for Jack.  \"Yes, my son,\" said the guide, kindly, for the old man could guess how hungry the lad was. \"But, first, where do you suppose the crickets and katydids have their ears?\"  \"Near those big eyes,\" called Peter.  \"No, no, on the joint of the fore leg is a little membrane, which is just a thinner, tighter place in the skin of the leg. There!\" Ben Gile had the fore leg of Jack's cricket stretched under the magnifying-glass. The children could see plainly the film of tight skin. \"Underneath the thin, tight skin is a fine nerve which, when the air makes the skin shake, changes the motion into sound. Mrs. Cricket listens with her fore leg while Mr. Cricket sings his love-song to her.\"  At this the children laughed and laughed, and comical little Peter put up his leg as if listening.  \"Here, Pete, give me your box. Do you remember what I told you about Mrs. Locust, Betty, and the way she lays her eggs?\"  \"Yes, sir. She has four straight spines at the end of her body, and after"]]]
