It tickled a little bit, but Malone didn't think of objecting. Naturally enough, the hand and Malone's wallet did not make an instantaneous connection. When the hand touched the bulky object strapped near Malone's armpit, it stopped, frozen, and then cautiously snaked the object out.  \"What's that, Bill?\" Sam said.  Bill looked up with the object in his hand. He seemed a little dazed. \"It's a gun,\" he said.  \"My God,\" Sam said. \"The guy's heeled! Watch him! Don't let him get away!\"  Malone considered getting away, and decided that he couldn't move. \"It's okay,\" he said.  \"Okay, hell,\" Sam said. \"It's a .44 Magnum. What are you doing with a gun, Mac?\" He was no longer polite and friendly. \"Why [are] you carrying a gun?\" he said.  \"I'm not carrying it,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Bill is. Your pal.\"  Bill backed away from Malone, putting the Magnum in his pocket and keeping the FBI agent covered with his own Police Positive. At the same time, he fished out the personal radio every patrolman carried in his uniform, and began calling for a prowl car in a low, somewhat nervous voice.  Sam said, \"My God. A gun. He could of shot everybody.\"  \"Get his wallet,\" Bill said. \"He can't hurt you now. I disarmed him.\"  Malone began to feel slightly dangerous. Maybe he _was_ a famous gangster. He wasn't sure. Maybe all this about being an FBI agent was just a figment of his imagination. Blows on the head did funny things. \"I'll drill everybody full of holes,\" he said in a harsh, underworld sort of voice, but it didn't sound very convincing. Sam approached him gently and fished out his wallet with great care, as if Malone were a ticking bomb ready to go off any second.  There was a little silence. Then Sam said, \"Give him his gun back, Bill,\" in a hushed and respectful tone.  \"Give him back his gun?\" the big cop said. \"You gone nuts, Sam?\"  Sam shook his head slowly. \"Nope,\" he said. \"But we made a terrible mistake. Know who this guy is?\"  \"He's heeled,\" Bill said. \"That's all I want to know.\" He put the radio away and gave all his attention to Malone.  \"He's FBI,\" Sam said. \"The wallet says so. Badge and everything. And not only that, Bill. He's Kenneth J. Malone.\"  Well, Malone thought with relief, that settled that. He wasn't a gangster after all. He was just the FBI agent he had always known and loved. Maybe now the cops would do-something about his head and take him away for burial.  \"Malone?\" Bill said. \"You mean the guy who's here about all those red Cadillacs?\"  \"Sure,\" Sam said. \"So give him his gun back.\" He looked at Malone. \"Listen, Mr. Malone,\" he said. \"We're sorry. We're sorry as hell.\"  \"That's all right,\" Malone said absently. He moved his head slowly and looked around. His suspicions were confirmed. There wasn't a red Cadillac anywhere in sight, and from the looks of the street there never had been. \"It's gone,\" he said, but the cops weren't listening.  \"We better get you to a hospital,\" Bill said. \"As soon as the prowl car gets here, we'll take you right on down to St. Vincent's. Can you tell us what happened? Or is it classified?\"  Malone wondered what could be classified about a blow on the head, and decided not to think about it. \"I can tell you,\" he said, \"if you'll answer one question for me.\"  \"Sure, Mr. Malone,\" Bill said. \"We'll be glad to help.\"  \"Anything at all,\" Sam said.  Malone gave them what he hoped was a gracious and condescending smile. \"All right, then,\" he said. \"Where the hell am I?\"  \"In New York,\" Sam said.  \"I know that,\" Malone said tiredly. \"Anywhere in particular, or just sort of all over New York?\"  \"Ninth Street,\" Bill said hurriedly. \"Near the Village. Is that where you were when they slugged you?\"  \"I guess so,\" Malone said. \"Sure.\" He nodded, and immediately remembered that he shouldn't have. He closed his eyes until the pain had softened to agony, and then opened them again. \"I was getting pretty tired of sitting around waiting for something to break on this case,\" he said, \"and I couldn't sleep, so I went out for a walk. I ended up in Greenwich Village--which is a hell of a place for a self-respecting man to end up.\"  \"I know just what you mean,\" Sam said sympathetically. \"Bohemians, they call themselves. Crazy people.\"  \"Not the people,\" Malone said. \"The streets. I got sort of lost.\" Chicago, he reflected, was a long way from the easiest city in the world to get around in. And he supposed you could even get confused in Washington if you tried hard enough. But he knew those cities. He could find his way around in them. Greenwich Village was different.  It was harder to navigate in than the trackless forests of the Amazon. The Village had tracks, all right--thousands of tracks. Only none of them led anywhere in particular.  \"Anyhow,\" Malone said, \"I saw this red Cadillac.\"  The cops looked around hurriedly and then looked back at Malone. Bill started to say, \"But there isn't any--\"  \"I know,\" Malone said. \"It's gone now. That's the trouble.\"  \"You mean somebody got in and drove it away?\" Sam said.  \"For all I know,\" Malone said, \"it sprouted wings and flew away.\" He paused. \"When I saw it, though--when I saw it, I decided to go over and have a look. Just in case.\"  \"Sure,\" Bill said. \"Makes sense.\" He stared at his partner as if defying him to prove it didn't make sense. Malone didn't really care.  \"There wasn't anybody else on the street,\" he said, \"so I walked over and tried the door. That's all. I didn't even open the car or anything. And I'll swear there was nobody behind me.\"  \"Well,\" Sam said, \"the street was empty when we got here.\"  \"But a guy could have driven off in that red Cadillac before we got here,\" Bill said.  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But where did he come from? I figured maybe somebody dropped something by mistake--a safe or something. Because there wasn't anybody behind me.\"  \"There had to be,\" Bill said.  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"there wasn't.\"  There was a little silence.  \"What happened then?\" Sam said. \"After you tried the door handle, I mean.\"  \"Then?\" Malone said. \"Then I went out like a light.\"  A pair of headlights rounded the nearby corner. Bill looked up. \"That's the prowl car,\" he announced, and went over to meet it.  The driver was a solidly built little man with the face of a Pekingese. His partner, a tall man who looked as if he'd have been much more comfortable in a ten-gallon Stetson instead of the regulation blue cap, leaned out at Bill, Sam, and Malone.  \"What's the trouble here?\" he said in a harsh, high voice.  \"No trouble,\" Bill said, and went over to the car. He began talking to the two cops inside in a low, urgent voice. Meanwhile, Sam got his arm around Malone and began pulling him away from the lamp post.  Malone was a little unwilling to let go, at first. But Sam was stronger than he looked. He convoyed the FBI agent carefully to the rear door of the prowl car, opened it and levered Malone gently to a seat inside, just as Bill said, \"So with the cut and all, we figured he ought to go over to St. Vincent's. You people were already on the way, so we didn't bother with ambulances.\"  The driver snorted. \"Next time you want taxi service,\" he said, \"you just call us up. What do you think, a prowl car's an easy life?\"  \"Easier than doing a beat,\" Bill said mournfully. \"And anyway,\" he added in a low, penetrating whisper, \"the guy's FBI.\"  \"So the FBI's got all kinds of equipment,\" the driver said. \"The latest. Why don't he whistle up a helicopter or a jet?\" Then, apparently deciding that further invective would get him nowhere, he settled back in his seat, said, \"Aah, forget it,\" and started the car with a small but perceptible jerk.  Malone decided not to get into the argument. He was tired, and it was late. He rested his head on the back seat and tried to relax, but all he could do was think about red Cadillacs.  He wished he had never even heard of red Cadillacs.                                     2  And it had all started so simply, too. Malone remembered very clearly the first time he had had any indication that red Cadillacs were anything unusual, or special. Before that, he'd viewed them all with slightly wistful eyes: red, blue, green, gray, white, or even black Cadillacs were all the same to him. They spelled luxury and wealth and display, and a lot of other nice things.  Now, he wasn't at all sure what they spelled. Except that it was definitely uncomfortable, and highly baffling.  He'd walked into the offices of Andrew J. Burris, Director of the FBI, just one week ago. It was a beautiful office, pine-paneled and spacious, and it boasted an enormous polished desk. And behind the desk sat Burris himself, looking both tired and somehow a little kindly.  \"You sent for me, Chief?\" Malone said.  \"That's right.\" Burris nodded. \"Malone, you've been working too hard lately.\"  Now, Malone thought, it was coming. The dismissal he'd always feared. At last Burris had found out that he wasn't the bright, intelligent, fearless, and alert FBI agent he was supposed to be. Burris had discovered that he was nothing more or less than lucky, and that all the \"fine jobs\" he was supposed to have done were only the result of luck.  Oh, well, Malone thought. Not being an FBI agent wouldn't be so bad. He could always find another job.  Only at the moment he couldn't think of one he liked.  He decided to make one last plea. \"I haven't been working so hard, Chief,\" he said. \"Not too hard, anyhow. I'm in great shape. I--\"  \"I've taken advantage of you, Malone, that's what I've done,\" Burris said, just as if Malone hadn't spoken at all. \"Just because you're the best agent I've got, that's no reason for me to hand you all the tough ones.\"  \"Just because I'm what?\" Malone said, feeling slightly faint.  \"I've given you the tough ones because you could handle them,\" Burris said. \"But that's no reason to keep loading jobs on you. After that job you did on the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22338"],["title","The Impossibles (#2)"],["body","kidnaping, and the way you wrapped up the Transom counterfeit ring--well, Malone, I think you need a little relaxation.\"  \"Relaxation?\" Malone said, feeling just a little bit pleased. Of course, he didn't deserve any of the praise he was getting, he knew. He'd just happened to walk in on the Gorelik kidnapers because his telephone had been out of order. And the Transom ring hadn't been just his job. After all, if other agents hadn't managed to trace the counterfeit bills back to a common area in Cincinnati, he'd never have been able to complete his part of the assignment. But it was nice to be praised, anyhow. Malone felt a twinge of guilt, and told himself sternly to relax and enjoy himself.  \"That's what I said,\" Burris told him. \"Relaxation.\"  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"I certainly would like a vacation, that's for sure. I'd like to snooze for a couple of weeks, or maybe go up to Cape Cod for a while. There's a lot of nice scenery up around there. It's restful, sort of, and I could just--\"  He stopped. Burris was frowning, and when Andrew J. Burris frowned it was a good idea to look attentive, interested, and alert. \"Now, Malone,\" Burris said sadly, \"I wasn't exactly thinking about a vacation. You're not scheduled for one until August, you know.\"  \"Oh, I know, Chief,\" Malone said. \"But I thought--\"  \"Much as I'd like to,\" Burris said, \"I just can't make an exception; you know that, Malone. I've got to go pretty much by the schedule.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said, feeling just a shade disappointed.  \"But I do think you deserve a rest,\" Burris said.  \"Well, if I--\"  \"Here's what I'm going to do,\" Burris said, and paused. Malone felt a little unsure as to exactly what his chief was talking about, but by now he knew better than to ask a lot of questions. Sooner or later, Burris would probably explain himself. And if he didn't, then there was no use worrying about it. That was just the way Burris acted.  \"Suppose I gave you a chance to take it easy for a while,\" Burris said. \"You could catch up on your sleep, see some shows, have a couple of drinks during the evening, take girls out for dinner--you know. Something like that. How would you like it?\"  \"Well...\" Malone said cautiously.  \"Good,\" Burris said. \"I knew you would.\"  Malone opened his mouth, thought briefly and closed it again. After all, it did sound sort of promising, and if there was a catch in it he'd find out about it soon enough.  \"It's really just a routine case,\" Burris said in an offhand tone. \"Nothing to it.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said.  \"There's this red Cadillac,\" Burris said. \"It was stolen from a party in Connecticut, out near Danbury, and it showed up in New York City. Now, the car's crossed a state line.\"  \"That puts it in our jurisdiction,\" Malone said, feeling obvious.  \"Right,\" Burris said. \"Right on the nose.\"  \"But the New York office--\"  \"Naturally, they're in charge of everything,\" Burris said. \"But I'm sending you out as sort of a special observer. Just keep your eyes open, and nose around and let me know what's happening.\"  \"Keep my eyes and nose what?\" Malone said.  \"Open,\" Burris said. \"And let me know about it.\"  Malone tried to picture himself with his eyes and nose open, and decided he didn't look very attractive that way. Well, it was only a figure of speech or something. He didn't have to think about it.  It really made a very ugly picture.  \"But why a special observer?\" he said after a second. Burris could read the reports from the New York office, and probably get more facts than any single agent could find out just wandering around a strange city. It sounded as if there were something, Malone told himself, just a tiny shade rotten in Denmark. It sounded as if there were going to be something in the nice easy assignment he was getting that would make him wish he'd gone lion hunting in Darkest Africa instead.  And then again, maybe he was wrong. He stood at ease and waited to find out.  \"Well,\" Burris said, \"it is just a routine case. Just like I said. But there seems to be something a little bit odd about it.\"  \"I see,\" Malone said with a sinking feeling.  \"Here's what happened,\" Burris said hurriedly, as if he were afraid Malone was going to change his mind and refuse the assignment. \"This red Cadillac I told you about was reported stolen from Danbury. Three days later, it turned up in New York City--parked smack across the street from a precinct police station. Of course it took them a while to wake up, but one of the officers happened to notice the routine report on stolen cars in the area, and he decided to go across the street and check the license number on the car. Then something funny happened.\"  \"Something funny?\" Malone asked. He doubted that, whatever it was, it was going to make him laugh. But he kept his face a careful, receptive blank.  \"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Now, if you're going to understand what happened, you've got to get the whole picture.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said.  \"Only that isn't what I mean,\" Burris added suddenly.  Malone blinked. \"_What_ isn't what you mean?\" he said.  \"Understanding what happened,\" Burris said. \"That's the trouble. You won't understand what happened. I don't understand it, and neither does anybody else. So what do you think about it?\"  \"Think about what?\" Malone said.  \"About what I've been telling you,\" Burris snapped. \"This car.\"  Malone took a deep breath. \"Well,\" he said, \"this officer went over to check the license plate. It seems like the right thing to do. It's just what I'd have done myself.\"  \"Sure you would,\" Burris said. \"Anybody would. But listen to me.\"  \"All right, Chief,\" Malone said.  \"It was just after dawn--early in the morning.\" Malone wondered briefly if there were parts of the world where dawn came, say, late in the afternoon, or during the evening sometime, but he said nothing. \"The street was deserted,\" Burris went on. \"But it was pretty light out, and the witnesses are willing to swear that there was nobody on that street for a block in either direction. Except them, of course.\"  \"Except who?\" Malone said.  \"Except the witnesses,\" Burris said patiently. \"Four cops, police officers who were standing on the front steps of the precinct station, talking. They were waiting to go on duty, or anyhow that's what the report said. It's lucky they were there, for whatever reason; they're the only witnesses we've got.\"  Burris stopped. Malone waited a few seconds and then said, as calmly as he could, \"Witnesses to what?\"  \"To this whole business with Sergeant Jukovsky,\" Burris said.  The sudden introduction of a completely new name confused Malone for an instant, but he recovered gamely. \"Sergeant Jukovsky was the man who investigated the car,\" he said.  \"That's right,\" Burris said. \"Except that he didn't.\"  Malone sighed.  \"Those four officers--the witnesses--they weren't paying much attention to what looked like the routine investigation of a parked car,\" Burris said. \"But here's their testimony. They were standing around talking when this Sergeant Jukovsky came out of the station, spoke to them in passing, and went on across the street. He didn't seem very worried or alarmed about anything.\"  \"Good,\" Malone said involuntarily. \"I mean, go on, Chief,\" he added.  \"Ah,\" Burris said. \"All right. Well. According to Jukovsky, he took a look at the plate and found the numbers checked the listing he had for a stolen Connecticut car. Then he walked around to take a look inside the car. It was empty. Get that, Malone. The car was empty.\"  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"it was parked. I suppose parked cars are usually empty. What's special about this one?\"  \"Wait and see,\" Burris said ominously. \"Jukovsky swears the car was empty. He tried the doors, and they were all locked but one, the front door on the curb side, the driver's door. So he opened it, and leaned over to have a look at the odometer to check the mileage. And something clobbered him on the back of the head.\"  \"One of the other cops,\" Malone said.  \"One of the--who?\" Burris said. \"No. Not the cops. Not at all.\"  \"Then something fell on him,\" Malone said. \"Okay. Then whatever fell on him ought to be--\"  \"Malone,\" Burris said.  \"Yes, Chief?\"  \"Jukovsky woke up on the sidewalk with the other cops all around him. There was nothing on that sidewalk but Jukovsky. Nothing could have fallen on him; it hadn't landed anywhere, if you see what I mean.\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"But--\"  \"Whatever it was,\" Burris said, \"they didn't find it. But that isn't the peculiar thing.\"  \"No?\"  \"No,\" Burris said slowly. \"Now--\"  \"Wait a minute,\" Malone said. \"They looked on the sidewalk and around there. But did they think to search the car?\"  \"They didn't get a chance,\" Burris said. \"Anyhow, not then. Not until they got around to picking up the pieces of the car uptown at 125th Street.\"  Malone closed his eyes. \"Where was this precinct?\" he said.  \"Midtown,\" Burris said. \"In the forties.\"  \"And the pieces of the car were eighty blocks away when they searched it?\" Malone said.  Burris nodded.  \"All right,\" Malone said pleasantly. \"I give up.\"  \"Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you,\" Burris said. \"According to the witnesses, after Jukovsky fell out of the car, the motor started and the car drove off uptown.\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said. He thought about that for a minute and decided at last to hazard one little question. It sounded silly--but then, what didn't? \"The car just drove off all by itself?\" he said.  Burris seemed abashed. \"Well, Malone,\" he said carefully, \"that's where the conflicting stories of the eyewitnesses don't agree. You see, two of the cops say there was nobody in the car. Nobody at all. Of any kind. Small or large.\"  \"And the other two?\" Malone said.  \"The other two swear they saw somebody at the wheel,\" Burris said, \"but they won't say whether it was a man, a woman, a small child, or an anthropoid ape. And they haven't the faintest idea where he, she, or it came from.\"  \"Great,\" Malone said. He felt a little tired. This trip was"]]]
