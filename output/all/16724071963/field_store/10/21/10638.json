Besides, the English are Protestants.\"  \"I pray for their conversion daily,\" said the Duke of York.  \"The end justifies the means, you know,\" answered Prince Charles.  \"All's fair in love and war.\"  \"I should think so,\" said Ricardo, \"especially against those brutes of Electors; they give trouble at home sometimes.\"  \"You, too, are plagued with an Elector?\" asked Prince Charles.  \"_An_ Elector? thousands of them!\" answered Dick, who never could understand anything about politics.  Prince Charles looked puzzled, but requested Dick to explain his great plan.  They sat down on the grass, and Ricardo showed them how he meant to manage it, just as he had told Jaqueline.  As he said, nothing could be simpler.  \"Let's start at once,\" he said, and, inducing Prince Charles to sit down on the magic carpet, he cried:  \"England!  St. James's Palace!\"  But nothing happened!  The carpet was not the right magic carpet, but the one which King Prigio had put in its place.  \"Get on!  England, I said!\" cried Dick.  But there they remained, under the chestnut tree, sitting on the carpet above the flowery grass.  {But there they remained: p99.jpg}  Prince Charles leaped to his feet; his face like fire, his eyes glowing.  \"Enough of this fooling, sir!\" he said.  \"It is easy, but cowardly, to mock at an unfortunate prince.  Take your carpet and be off with you, out of the gardens, or your shoulders shall taste my club.\"  \"There has been some mistake,\" Ricardo said; \"the wrong carpet has been brought by accident, or the carpet has lost its power.\"  \"In this sacred city, blessed by the presence of his Holiness the Pope, and the relics of so many martyrs and saints, magic may well cease to be potent,\" said the Duke of York.  \"Nonsense!  You are an impostor, sir!  Leave my presence!\" cried Prince Charles, lifting his golf-club.  Dick caught it out of his hand, and broke across his knee as fine a driver as ever came from Robertson's shop at St. Andrew's.  \"The quarrels of princes are not settled with clubs, sir!  Draw and defend yourself!\" he said, kicking off his boots and standing in his socks on the grass.  Think of the horror of poor Jaqueline, who witnessed this terrible scene of passion from a fold in Prince Ricardo's dress!  What could the girl do to save the life of two princes, the hopes of one nation, and of a respectable minority in another?  In a moment Prince Charles's rapier was shining in the sunlight, and he fell on guard in the most elegant attitude, his left hand gracefully raised and curved.  Dick drew his sword, but, as suddenly, threw it down again.  \"Hang it!\" he exclaimed, \"I can't hit you with _this_!  This is the Sword of Sharpness; it would cut through your steel and your neck at a touch.\"  He paused, and thought.  \"Let me beseech your Royal Highness,\" he said to the Duke of York, who was in a terrible taking, \"to lend your blade to a hand not less royal than your own.\"  \"Give him it, Hal!\" said Prince Charles, who was standing with the point of his sword on the ground, and the blade bent.  \"He seems to believe in his own nonsense.\"  The duke yielded his sword; Dick took it, made a nourish, and rushed at Prince Charles.  Now Ricardo had always neglected his fencing lessons.  \"Where's the good of it,\" he used to ask, \"all that stamping, and posture-making, and ha- haing?  The Sword of Sharpness is enough for _me_.\"  But now he could not, in honour, use the Sword of Sharpness; so on he came, waving the rapier like a claymore, and made a slice at Prince Charles's head.  The prince, very much surprised, parried in prime, riposted, and touched Dick on the hand.  At this moment the Princess Jaqueline did what she should have thought of sooner.  She flew out of Dick's coat, and stung old King James on his royal nose.  The king wakened, nearly crushed the princess (so dangerous is the practice of magic to the artist), and then leaped up, and saw Dick's blade flying through the air, glittering in the sun.  The prince had disarmed him.  \"Hullo! what's all this?  _A moi_, _mes gardes_!\" cried the old king, in French and English; and then he ran up, just in time to hear Prince Charles say:  \"Sir, take your life!  I cannot strike an unarmed man.  A prince you may be, but you have not learned the exercises of gentlemen.\"  \"What is all this, Carluccio?\" asked the old king.  \"Swords out! brawling in my very presence! blood drawn!\" for Dick's hand was bleeding a good deal.  Prince Charles, as briefly as possible, explained the unusual nature of the circumstances.  \"A king must hear both sides,\" said King James.  \"What reply have you, sir, to make to his Royal Highness's statements?\"  \"The carpet would not work, sir,\" said Dick.  \"It never happened before. Had I used my own sword,\" and he explained its properties, \"the Prince of Wales would not be alive to tell his story.  I can say no more, beyond offering my apology for a disappointment which I could not have foreseen. A gentleman can only say that he is sorry.  But wait!\" he added; \"I can at least prove that my confidence in some of my resources is not misplaced.  Bid me bring you something--anything--from the ends of the earth, and it shall be in your hands.  I can't say fairer.\"  King James reflected, while Prince Ricardo was pulling on the Seven-league Boots, which he had kicked off to fight more freely, and while the Duke of York bandaged Dick's hand with a kerchief.  \"Bring me,\" said his Majesty, \"Lord Lovat's snuff-mull.\"  \"Where does he live?\" said Dick.  \"At Gortuleg, in Scotland,\" answered King James.  Dick was out of sight before the words were fairly spoken, and in ten minutes was back, bearing a large ram's-horn snuff-box, with a big cairngorm set in the top, and the Frazer arms.  \"Most astonishing!\" said King James.  \"A miracle!\" said the Duke of York.  \"You have entirely cleared your character,\" said the king.  \"Your honour is without a stain, though it is a pity about the carpet.  Your nobility in not using your magical sword, under the greatest provocation, reconciles me to this fresh blighting of my hopes.  All my allies fail me,\" said the poor king with a sigh; \"you alone have failed with honour. Carluccio, embrace the prince!\"  They fell into each other's arms.  \"Prince,\" said Dick, \"you have taught me a lesson for which I shall not be ungrateful.  With any blade a gentleman should be able to hold his own in fair fight.  I shall no longer neglect my fencing lessons.\"  \"With any blade,\" said Prince Charles, \"I shall be happy to find Prince Ricardo by my side in a stricken field.  We shall not part till I have induced you to accept a sword which I can never hope to draw against another adversary so noble.  In war, my weapon is the claymore.\"  Here the prince offered to Ricardo the ruby-studded hilt of his rapier, which had a beautiful white shark-skin sheath.  \"You must accept it, sir,\" said King James; \"the hilt holds the rubies of John Sobieski.\"  \"Thank you, prince,\" said Ricardo, \"for the weapon, which I shall learn to wield; and I entreat you to honour me by receiving this fairy gift--which _you_ do not need--a ring which makes all men faithful to the wearer.\"  The Prince of Wales bowed, and placed the talisman on his finger.  Ricardo then, after a few words of courtesy on both parts, picked up his useless carpet, took his farewell of the royal party, and, with Jaqueline still hidden under his collar, returned at full speed, but with a heavy heart, to Pantouflia, where the palace gong was just sounding for luncheon.  Ricardo never interfered in foreign affairs again, but his ring proved very useful to Prince Charles, as you may have read in history.     CHAPTER VI. Ricardo's Repentance.   {Bottle of weapon salve: p109.jpg}  The queen, as it happened fortunately, was lunching with one of the ladies of her Court.  Ricardo did not come down to luncheon, and Jaqueline ate hers alone; and very mournful she felt.  The prince had certainly not come well out of the adventure.  He had failed (as all attempts to restore the Stuarts always did); he had been wounded, though he had never received a scratch in any of his earlier exploits; and if his honour was safe, and his good intentions fully understood, that was chiefly due to Jaqueline, and to the generosity of King James and Prince Charles.  \"I wonder what he's doing?\" she said to herself, and at last she went up and knocked at Ricardo's door.  \"Go away,\" he said; \"I don't want to see anybody.  Who is it?\"  \"It's only me--Jaqueline.\"  {\"It's only me\": p111.jpg}  \"Go away!  I want nobody.\"  \"Do let me in, dear Dick; I have good news for you,\" said the princess.  \"What is it?\" said Ricardo, unlocking the door.  \"Why do you bother a fellow so?\"  He had been crying--his hand obviously hurt him badly; he looked, and indeed he was, very sulky.  \"How did you get on in England, Dick?\" asked the princess, taking no notice of his bandaged hand.  \"Oh, don't ask me!\" said Ricardo.  \"I've not been to England at all.\"  \"Why, what happened?\"  \"Everything that is horrid happened,\" said Dick; and then, unable to keep it any longer to himself, he said: \"I've failed to keep my promise; I've been insulted, I've been beaten by a fellow younger than myself; and, oh! how my hand does hurt, and I've got such a headache!  And what am I to say to my mother when she asks why my arm is in a sling? and what will my father say?  I'm quite broken down and desperate.  I think I'll run away to sea;\" and indeed he looked very wild and miserable.  \"Tell me how it all happened, Dick,\" said the princess; \"I'm sure it's not so bad as you make out.  Perhaps I can help you.\"  \"How can a girl help a man?\" cried Dick, angrily; and poor Jaqueline, remembering how she _had_ helped him, at the risk of her own life, when King James nearly crushed her in the shape of a mosquito, turned her head away, and cried silently.  \"I'm a beast,\" said Dick.  \"I beg your pardon, Jack dear.  You are always a trump, I will say;"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21994"],["title","Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia: Being the Adventures of Prince Prigio's Son (#7)"],["body"," I don't see what you can do.\"  Then he told her all the story (which, of course, she knew perfectly well already), except the part played by the mosquito, of which he could not be aware.  \"I was sure it was not so bad as you made it out, Dick,\" she said.  \"You see, the old king, who is not very wise, but is a perfectly honourable gentleman, gave you the highest praise.\"  She thought of lecturing him a little about disobeying his father, but it did not seem a good opportunity.  Besides, Jaqueline had been lectured herself lately, and had not enjoyed it.  \"What am I to say to my mother?\" Dick repeated.  \"We must think of something to say,\" said Jaqueline.  \"I can't tell my mother anything but the truth,\" Ricardo went on.  \"Here's my hand, how it does sting! and she must find out.\"  \"I think I can cure it,\" said Jaqueline.  \"Didn't you say Prince Charles gave you his own sword?\"  \"Yes, there it is; but what has that to do with it?\"  \"Everything in the world to do with it, my dear Dick.  How lucky it is that he gave it to you!\"  And she ran to her own room, and brought a beautiful golden casket, which contained her medicines.  Taking out a small phial, marked (in letters of emerald):  \"WEAPON SALVE,\"  the princess drew the bright sword, extracted a little of the ointment from the phial, and spread it on a soft silk handkerchief.  \"What are you going to do with the sword?\" asked Ricardo.  \"Polish it a little,\" said Jaqueline, smiling, and she began gently to rub, with the salve, the point of the rapier.  As she did so, Ricardo's arm ceased to hurt, and the look of pain passed from his mouth.  \"Why, I feel quite better!\" he said.  \"I can use my hand as well as ever.\"  Then he took off the stained handkerchief, and, lo, there was not even a mark where the wound had been!  For this was the famous Weapon Salve which you may read about in Sir Kenelm Digby, and which the Lady of Branxholme used, in _The Lay of the Last Minstrel_.  But the secret of making it has long been lost, except in Pantouflia.  \"You are the best girl in the world, Jaqueline,\" said Ricardo.  \"You may give me a kiss if you like; and I won't call you 'Jack,' or laugh at you for reading books, any more.  There's something in books after all.\"  The princess did not take advantage of Dick's permission, but advised him to lie down and try to sleep.  \"I say, though,\" he said, \"what about my father?\"  \"The king need never be told anything about it,\" said Jaqueline, \"need he?\"  \"Oh, that won't do!  I tell my father everything; but then, I never had anything like this to tell him before.  Don't you think, Jaqueline, you might break it to him?  He's very fond of you.  Just tell him what I told you; it's every word of it true, and he ought to know.  He might see something about it in the _Mercure de France_.\"  This was the newspaper of the period.  \"I don't think it will get into the papers,\" said Jaqueline, smiling. \"Nobody could tell, except the king and the princes, and they have reasons for keeping it to themselves.\"  \"I don't trust that younger one,\" said Dick, moodily; \"I don't care for that young man.  Anyway, my father _must_ be told; and, if you won't, I must.\"  \"Well, I'll tell him,\" said Jaqueline.  \"And now lie down till evening.\"  After dinner, in the conservatory, Jaqueline told King Prigio all about it.  His Majesty was very much moved.  \"What extraordinary bad luck that family has!\" he thought.  \"If I had not changed the rug, the merest accident, Prince Charles would have dined at St. James's to-night, and King George in Hanover.  It was the very nearest thing!\"  \"This meddling with practical affairs will never do,\" he said aloud.  \"Dick has had a lesson, sire,\" said the princess.  \"He says he'll never mix himself up with politics again, whatever happens.  And he says he means to study all about them, for he feels frightfully ignorant, and, above all, he means to practise his fencing.\"  These remarks were not part of the conversation between Ricardo and Jaqueline, but she considered that Dick _meant_ all this, and, really, he did.  \"That is well, as far as it goes,\" said the king.  \"But, Jaqueline, about that mosquito?\" for she had told him this part of the adventure.  \"That was a very convenient mosquito, though I don't know how Dick was able to observe it from any distance.  I see _your_ hand in that, my dear, and I am glad you can make such kind and wise use of the lessons of the good Fairy Paribanou.  Jaqueline,\" he added solemnly, laying his hand on her head, \"You have saved the honour of Pantouflia, which is dearer to me than life.  Without your help, I tremble to think what might have occurred.\"  The princess blushed very much, and felt very happy.  \"Now run away to the queen, my dear,\" said his Majesty, \"I want to think things over.\"  He did think them over, and the more he thought the more he felt the inconvenience attending the possession of fairy things.  \"An eclipse one day, as nearly as possible a revolution soon after!\" he said to himself.  \"But for Jaqueline, Ricardo's conduct would have been blazed abroad, England would have been irritated.  It is true she cannot get at Pantouflia very easily; we have no sea-coast, and we are surrounded by friendly countries.  But it would have been a ticklish and discreditable position.  I must really speak to Dick,\" which he did next morning after breakfast.  \"You have broken my rules, Ricardo,\" he said.  \"True, there is no great harm done, and you have confessed frankly; but how am I to trust you any longer?\"  \"I'll give you my sacred word of honour, father, that I'll never meddle with politics again, or start on an expedition, without telling you.  I have had enough of it.  And I'll turn over a new leaf.  I've learned to be ashamed of my ignorance; and I've sent for Francalanza, and I'll fence every day, and read like anything.\"  \"Very good,\" said the king.  \"I believe you mean what you say.  Now go to your fencing lesson.\"  \"But, I say, father,\" cried Ricardo, \"was it not strange about the magic carpet?\"  \"I told you not to trust to these things,\" said the king.  \"Some enchanter may have deprived it of its power, it may be worn out, someone may have substituted a common Persian rug; anything may happen.  You _must_ learn to depend on yourself.  Now, be off with you, I'm busy.  And remember, you don't stir without my permission.\"  The prince ran off, and presently the sounds of stamping feet and \"_un_, _deux_; _doublez_, _degagez_, _vite_; _contre de carte_,\" and so forth, might be heard over a great part of the royal establishment.     CHAPTER VII. Prince Ricardo and an Old Enemy.   {The Yellow Dwarf: p123.jpg}  \"There is one brute I wish I could get upsides with,\" said Ricardo, at breakfast one morning, his mouth full of sardine.  \"Really, Ricardo, your language is most unprincely,\" said his august father; \"I am always noticing it.  You mean, I suppose, that there is one enemy of the human race whom you wish to abolish.  What is the name of the doomed foe?\"  \"Well, he is the greatest villain in history,\" said Ricardo.  \"You must have read about him, sir, the Yellow Dwarf.\"  \"Yes, I have certainly studied what is told us about him,\" said the king. \"He is no favourite of mine.\"  \"He is the only one, if you notice, sir, of all the scoundrels about whom our ancestors inform us, who escaped the doom which he richly merited at the sword of a good knight.\"  You may here remark that, since Dick took to his studies, he could speak, when he chose, like a printed book, which was by no means the case before.  \"If you remember, sir, he polished off--I mean, he slew--the King of the Golden Mines and the beautiful, though frivolous, Princess Frutilla.  All that the friendly Mermaid could do for them was to turn them into a pair of beautiful trees which intertwine their branches.  Not much use in _that_, sir!  And nothing was done to the scoundrel.  He may be going on still; and, with your leave, I'll go and try a sword-thrust with him. Francalanza says I'm improving uncommon.\"  \"You'll take the usual Sword of Sharpness,\" said his Majesty.  \"What, sir, to a dwarf?  Not I, indeed: a common small sword is good enough to settle _him_.\"  \"They say he is very cunning of fence,\" said the king; \"and besides, I have heard something of a diamond sword that he stole from the King of the Golden Mines.\"  \"Very likely he has lost it or sold it, the shabby little miscreant; however, I'll risk it.  And now I must make my preparations.\"  The king did not ask what they were; as a rule, they were simple.  But, being in the shop of the optician that day, standing with his back to the door, he heard Dick come in and order a pair of rose-coloured spectacles, with which he was at once provided.  The people of Pantouflia were accustomed to wear them, saying that they improved the complexions of ladies whom they met, and added cheerfulness to things in general.  \"Just plain rose-coloured glass, Herr Spex,\" said Dick, \"I'm not short- sighted.\"  \"The boy is beginning to show some sense,\" said the king to himself, knowing the nature and the difficulties of the expedition.  Ricardo did not disguise his intention of taking with him a Dandie Dinmont terrier, named Pepper, and the king, who understood the motive of this precaution, silently approved.  \"The lad has come to some purpose and forethought,\" the king said, and he gladly advanced a considerable sum for the purchase of crocodiles' eggs, which can rarely be got quite fresh.  When Jaqueline had made the crocodiles' eggs, with millet-seed and sugar-candy, into a cake for the Dwarf's lions, Ricardo announced that his preparations were complete.  Not to be the mere slave of custom, he made this expedition on horseback, and the only magical thing he took with him was the Cap of Darkness (the one which would not work, but he did not know that), and this he put in his pocket for future use.  With plenty of egg sandwiches and marmalade sandwiches, and cold minced-collop sandwiches,"]]]
