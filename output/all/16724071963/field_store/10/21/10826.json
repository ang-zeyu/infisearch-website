The book is yours.  Your name is in it.\"  In vain Harry protested his innocence; Mr Prichard remained inexorable.  \"You will come with me to Dr Palmer to-morrow,\" and putting the book into his pocket, he stalked from the room.     CHAPTER VII.  A BOY FIGHT AT SCHOOL.  Lynch law--At bay--Bully Warburton--Single combat--The deciding round--Harry is victorious.   If Harry felt heavy-hearted when he started for home that afternoon, what must he have felt now?  Deeper than ever he was plunged in the trouble from which he knew not how to extricate himself.  His thoughts, however, soon flew to his mother.  He knew that there he would find comfort, that there, at least, he would be believed.  So carefully wiping away all traces of his tears, and putting on as brave a face as he could, he strapped his books together, and ran down the broad stone stairs into the lobby.  For some time, however, he could not find his cap.  It did not need much reflection to tell him what this meant or foreboded.  It was the beginning of persecution.  But after rumaging about among the boxes kept in the lobby, his patience was at length rewarded.  There, in a corner, was the missing cap; but torn and dirty and much injured. Nothing daunted, he cleaned it as well as he could, and, putting it on, emerged into the play-ground.  Just as he was fairly in the open, walking quickly towards the gates, and not looking about him, he heard a burst of voices that bore no pleasant meaning; and then a body of tennis-balls flew all round him--some hitting him smartly, some whizzing within an ace of him.  As soon as he had recovered from the first shock of his astonishment, stung and bruised, he looked to see who were his assailants, and there he saw about twenty boys, mostly of his own age and size, in fact, belonging to his form; though several of the crowd stood out from the rest, as older and bigger.  Harry's weakness was now turned to indignation.  \"You beastly cowards!\" he cried, \"what have I done to you?\"  \"Thought to get the prize by cribbing, did you, you sneak?\"  \"I did not crib,\" shouted Harry, who had not stirred from where he was first hit by the balls.  \"You little liar, you did.  Give it him again,\" cried one of the bigger boys; and then another shower of balls fell thick about him.  \"I'm not a liar.  It's you're the liars, and the cowards too,\" he cried, coming nearer the crowd; and then the boys, too, crowded nearer to him.  \"Do you mean to call me a liar?  Do you mean to call me a coward?\" cried one after the other--the bigger boys now being louder and more threatening in their tones.  \"Yes, I do,\" answered Harry, \"if you say I cribbed, when I didn't.  And you are cowards to all set on one.\"  \"Leave him to me,\" said Warburton, a tall, ungainly boy of fourteen, as boy after boy was eager to take the quarrel to himself.  \"I'll teach him.  Now, you young brute,\" he cried, advancing to Harry.  \"Do you mean to call me a liar and a coward?\"  [Illustration: \"'Leave him to me,' said Warburton, a tall ungainly boy of fourteen, as boy after boy was eager to take the quarrel to himself.\"--WILTON SCHOOL, page 52.]  \"Yes, I do,\" persisted Harry, as Warburton came nearer, and shook his fist in his face.  \"It wasn't my crib; and you'd better not hit me!\"  \"Better not hit _you_,\" jeered Warburton; while the group echoed, \"Better not hit him, indeed!  Give him a good licking for his cheek, Warburton; I would if I were you!\"  Warburton's jeer was very forced, but the voices of the rest gave him courage.  So he rushed at Harry.  The latter, however, seeing what to expect, threw away his books, and then flew at Warburton, who, from sheer astonishment at having actually to fight when he thought to administer an easy licking, began the combat at rather a disadvantage. Both hit very wildly at first, and not much damage was done.  Of the two, Warburton was most out of breath, for he had been hitting furiously at Harry, who, not being strong enough to ward off the blows with his arms, had been forced to dodge and duck his head.  Presently they got into a corner close to the lobby-door, and Harry was beginning to flag.  Not a word all this time had been uttered by the on-lookers.  They would not back Harry; and to cheer on Warburton would be ridiculous.  \"Of course he would lick him all to pieces in a minute,\" they said.  But the minute had been a good long one, and all in their hearts were somewhat surprised.  Just then Egerton came up; and Harry could scarcely believe his ears, when one voice alone came out of the crowd, cheering him on, and saying, \"Go it, Campbell!  Well fought!  I'll back you, after all.\"  And the voice was Egerton's.  At that moment Warburton was making a furious charge at him, when Harry stepped sharply aside, and gathering all his remaining force into one blow, hit his foe on the jaw: at the same instant Warburton slipped, and the blow and the false step terminated the fight, for he fell violently through the open lobby-door upon the stone floor.  \"Well fought, Campbell! well fought!\" cried Egerton.  No one else uttered a word.  Waiting till Warburton was on his feet again, his mouth bleeding, his face very crestfallen, Harry picked up his books, and shaking off Egerton's congratulations and friendly words, for he felt he was far more his enemy than Warburton, started home.  A good bathe in the lavatory set the mouth to rights; but Warburton was utterly cowed, and had learnt a lesson, which the rest had learnt too, that meek-hearted boys may bear a good deal of bullying, but that even to their endurance there is a certain limit.     CHAPTER VIII.  FRIENDS IN MISFORTUNE.  Ominous words--A visitor--Harry breaks down--A confused story--What is to be done?--In good keeping.   Harry reached the farm about six o'clock--later than his usual time, and he knew his mother would be sure to inquire the reason; and, besides, his hair was very rough, and there was a suspicious-looking red mark on his left cheekbone.  However, he was no sooner inside the house than he ran straight up-stairs to his mother.  Her bedroom door was just ajar, and hearing a strange voice proceeding from the room. Harry knew some one was with her; so he sat down on the stairs, hoping that it would not be long before he might go in to see her.  His heart was bursting to tell her all.  He could keep it a secret no longer. To-morrow was the dreaded day when he was to be taken before Dr Palmer, and what the punishment might be, he dared not think.  Expulsion, perhaps: certainly the loss of his place in his class, and nothing scarcely could be worse than that.  Poor boy, he was in ignorance (and happily so) of the extent of the fault of cribbing.  Most boys would have said: \"I shall get a good caning, but I can get my crib again soon enough.\"  It was a lady who was with Mrs Campbell; so Harry knew from the voice, which was soft and sweet.  She was talking quietly to his mother about her death; and as the words fell upon the silence.  Harry listened eagerly for every syllable, nervous and trembling, and grew more miserable as each minute stole wearily by.  \"It wouldn't have been so hard to die,\" Mrs Campbell was saying, \"if he could only have been with me till the last.  Dear Alan!  I wonder where he is now?\"  \"Yet think, dear Mrs Campbell, how he is spared the pain of seeing you suffer,\" said the doctor's wife, for it was she.  \"You love him well enough, I know, to enable you to think this, don't you?\"  \"Oh, yes! yes!\" answered the dying wife.  \"God knows what is for our good.  It may have saved him much pain and sorrow.  Dear Alan!\" and her voice grew very low.  She was talking half to herself.  Then, as the new thought flashed across, she said again aloud, \"But what will become of Harry when I am gone, and Alan out at sea?\"  And Harry, where he sat on the stairs in the deepening dusk, burst into tears.  His mother's quick ears caught the sound of his sobs, and she exclaimed:  \"Why, there is Harry crying on the stairs?  Tell him to come in, will you, Mrs Bromley?\"  Harry needed no telling.  He was soon in the room, at his mother's bedside, and clasped in her arms.  \"Don't cry, Harry, darling,\" the weak voice said.  \"Don't cry so!\"  \"You aren't really going to die, mamma?  What shall I do without you?--all alone--and--and Dr Palmer won't believe me.  I know he won't,\" sobbed Harry.  \"Dr Palmer won't believe you?  What is it, dear? and what is the matter with your face?  Oh, Harry, you haven't been fighting, have you?\" she added, and her voice bore shadow of reproach in it.  \"Yes, mamma, I have,\" answered Harry, \"but I didn't begin; they all set on me, and shied balls at me, and said I cribbed, and called me a liar and a coward, and I fought Warburton, and licked him,\" and then came the English schoolboy's triumphant glance, through his tearful eyes.  \"Said you cribbed?  When, dear?  How?\" asked Mrs Campbell.  \"Tell me all about it.\"  And, then, when the two had at length succeeded in quieting Harry, he began his story.  Through excitement, it was naturally very confused at first, but, by degrees, he had made everything plain.  \"But why don't you tell Dr Palmer that it was Egerton's crib? and all that you saw in morning school?\" said Mrs Campbell.  \"Yes,\" chimed in the doctor's wife, \"you can tell him you distinctly saw Egerton using the book.\"  \"That's no good, mamma,\" answered Harry, despondingly.  \"He wouldn't believe me.  He'd say I put it off on Egerton, because he was next me in class.\"  \"What _is_ to be done?\" said Mrs Bromley.  \"I quite see what the poor boy means.\"  \"Never mind, Harry, dear, tell the truth, as I know you will,\" said Mrs Campbell, \"and it will all go well with you.  Egerton will be found out sooner or later,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22183"],["title","Wilton School; or, Harry Campbell's Revenge (#4)"],["body"," Dr Palmer will be sorry if he has punished you for nothing.\"  \"I shall tell Mr Bromley to go and speak to Dr Palmer.  That horrid boy, Egerton!  I could give him a good shaking!\" said Mrs Bromley, excitedly.  \"And now, dear Mrs Campbell, I must go.  I will try and send you round some grapes in the morning.  They will be so good for your thirst.  I shall come and see you again soon.  Keep up,\" she added, in a whisper.  \"Think of what we have been saying.  God is but calling you to a better country, and He will guard your motherless boy!\"  \"He will!  He will, I know!  Good-bye.  You are so good and kind to me. Come again soon, won't you?\"  \"Come, Harry,\" said the doctor's wife, turning to him, \"come down with me, and Mrs Valentine will give you your tea.\"  \"And ask her to bathe your face, dear boy,\" added Mrs Campbell, \"and put a vinegar pad on it.\"  And then Mrs Bromley, kissing her affectionately, led Harry from the room, looking wistfully at his mother as he went.  \"Ah, Alan, darling Alan!\" she sighed, when she was alone in the silent twilight of the room, \"if you were only here, it would be so much easier to die!  Just to say good-bye once more.  And you'll only see my grave when you come home.  Oh, God,\" she prayed, \"forgive me, and take me to Thyself.\"  And then her words grew wandering.  \"Scotland with uncle Robert--how rough the waves are!--when shall we get to Malta--Alan!  Alan! when will Alan come?--Alan, darling, don't be long!--I am so tired!\" and so she fell into a broken slumber.     CHAPTER IX.  HARRY PUT ON TRIAL.  The geography paper--Before Dr Palmer--The accusation--Sentenced--The doctor's study--William's reminiscences--The doctor--Enter Egerton--Punishment--A hasty summons--Heart-stricken.   Not a single word greeted Harry on his entering the playground the following morning; neither was there any symptom of the persecution of the previous evening.  No murmured words flung at him; no hissing; but only a few stares of wonder, almost, at his recent achievement.  He was treated as a mere cypher,--sent to Coventry in fact.  But this he did not mind; it certainly was preferable to positive persecution; and as he wished to keep calm for his coming ordeal, he was glad that nothing ensued to cause another fight--a contingency he had been fully prepared to expect.  Warburton scowled at him.  Egerton turned his face away as they passed.  This, however, did not make the slightest impression on Harry; he felt proud of his victory over the former, and despised the meanness of the latter.  He was allowed to proceed with the examination; but his place had been changed, and he now sat close to Mr Prichard.  The reason was evident, and he asked himself wearily, as he bent over his paper, when would he ever be set clear in the eyes of the masters and his schoolfellows?  Strangely enough, one of the questions (it was a geography paper) was, \"What do you know of Malta?\"  Harry here felt at an advantage.  He remembered, of course, nothing from his own experience; but he had heard his mother's description, and as his pen ran quickly, echoing in boyish language her words whom he loved so well, it is not much to be wondered that his interest almost banished from his mind the memory of his sorry plight.  But \"like a dream, when one awaketh,\" he came back suddenly to a recollection of how he was situated.  He was going to be put, as it were, on trial, and the charge against him was a difficult one to disprove.  Being a half-holiday, prayers were read at the end of morning-school. And now the time was come.  Harry walked to Mr Prichard's desk, who conducted him at once across the room to Dr Palmer.  The latter looked over his spectacles, surprised.  Indeed, Harry had always been one of the \"model boys.\"  \"What is the matter, Mr Prichard?\" he inquired.  \"Has Campbell been misbehaving himself?\"  \"Yesterday morning, sir,\" answered Mr Prichard, \"during the examination, I detected Campbell deliberately looking over Egerton's paper, who you know at present stands next to him in class.\"  \"No, sir, indeed I wasn't,\" burst in Harry.  \"Silence, sir!\" sharply said Dr Palmer.  \"Had this been all,\" resumed Mr Prichard, \"I should have punished him myself, severely, without troubling you; but, in the afternoon, as I was collecting the papers, and passing close by Campbell's desk, which was open at the time, I found this book in it,\" and he handed the delectus-crib.  \"And Campbell says--\"  \"It isn't mine, sir!\" pleaded Harry.  \"Some one must have put it there!\"  \"Silence, sir!\" said Dr Palmer, sharply again.  \"You will have to answer presently.  Well, Mr Prichard?\"  \"Campbell makes the matter, as I told him, far worse by persistently denying that he is the owner of the book.  And yet his name is in it.\"  \"Campbell,\" said Dr Palmer, gravely, \"this is a most serious charge against you.  I had always thought you were an honourable boy.  You always have been very industrious, and your work has been well done, as I hear; but this matter alters the whole case.  It shows how one can be deceived in a boy.\"  As he paused a moment, Harry broke in with the same denials he had used before.  He could not yet bring himself to try his last resource of affirming who was the rightful owner of the book, and he feared even that would but make his case worse.  \"Go into my study, and wait till I come,\" added Dr Palmer.  And Harry, knowing what that meant, went away trembling; for no boy on the eve, or in the midst of, a caning, feels much consolation in a consciousness of his innocence.  How he got to Dr Palmer's study he knew not.  The playground seemed so very long, and the boys who crowded to watch him pass, to have doubled or trebled their number.  And he was almost glad, if such a feeling is compatible with his position, when he reached the room of horrors, as the Doctor's sanctum really was to the boys; for none set foot therein save those who were \"in for a row.\"  Crossing the hall he met Dr Palmer's butler, an old man, most familiar to everybody, who never even said \"Sir\" to his master; but then he had known him from a boy.  So it is no wonder his greeting to Harry was so blunt.  \"What? 's that you, Campbell?  Well, to be sure!  In for a caning, I s'pose.  What have you been and done now?\"  \"Nothing, William.  I haven't done nothing,\" sobbed Harry, regardless of grammar.  \"I'm going to be caned for nothing.\"  \"Oh no! nothing at all.  That's what they all say, the young rascals,\" ejaculated William, half aloud, as he hurried away, partly about his business, but chiefly because he didn't like the sight of the boy's tears.  It made him think of the time when he used to steal apples (he would tell them in the kitchen), and his mother used to hold him up by his ears while his father thrashed him.  Harry had scarcely taken his seat upon the edge of one of Dr Palmer's crimson-morocco-covered chairs when he heard the fatal footstep in the hall, and the next moment the Doctor entered.  The first thing he did was to take down one of the canes that lay on the top of the bookshelves, Harry narrowly watching him the while, and then he said--  \"Campbell, I am exceedingly sorry to be obliged to punish you.\"  Harry shivered; the doctor was a powerful man; and the cane looked very lithe and lissome.  \"But I cannot pass over such a serious fault, even though you have always hitherto, so far as I have seen, conducted yourself well.  There can be not the slightest doubt that the book is yours.  It was found in your desk, and has your name in it.\"  \"It isn't mine, sir.  I declare it isn't.  Some one must have put it there; and I saw,\"--and here Harry paused.  Dr Palmer looked at him narrowly.  \"Some one must have put it there?  And do you mean to say, then, that you accuse one of your schoolfellows, not only of putting it there, but also of--\"  Harry could endure no longer, and with excited and stammering tones, he told the whole tale.  \"This is a most serious charge for you to bring,\" said Dr Palmer, laying down the cane and ringing the bell.  \"Send Master Egerton here,\" he said, when William appeared.  After a pause of about three minutes, which seemed like an hour to Harry, and during which not a word was uttered, Egerton entered, cool and collected, and said respectfully to Dr Palmer:  \"William said I was wanted, sir.\"  \"Campbell tells me he saw you using this book,\"--holding out the delectus-crib--\"in yesterday-morning school.  The conclusion, therefore is, that it is yours, and that you put it into his desk.  What have you to say to this, Egerton?\"  \"No, sir, I declare the book isn't mine,\" answered Egerton, positively, and still quite coolly.  \"I suppose Campbell's tried to put it off on me, because I'm next him in class.\"  \"Oh, Egerton, how can you say so!\" ejaculated Harry.  \"You know you were using it.\"  \"Ask Evans, sir; he sat on the other side of me,\" said Egerton.  Evans was sent for.  \"No, he never saw Egerton using the book.  He sat close to him, and couldn't have helped seeing if he was cribbing.\"  Egerton again positively and solemnly declaring he knew nothing whatever of the matter, and Evans' evidence so far bearing him out, Dr Palmer dismissed them both, and then turned to Harry.  \"Campbell, you have now had every chance.  You have been detected in a most dishonourable act, and you have added to your fault by telling a lie.  Bend down,\" he concluded, taking his cane.  In vain Harry protested his innocence.  In vain he begged Dr Palmer to believe him.  Twenty times the strong arm rose, twenty times the cane whished through the air, and twenty times Harry felt the sting.  By the time it was all over, he was perfectly numbed and stiff with pain.  But the bodily suffering was nothing when compared with the mental agony he felt at thus being punished when innocent.  His whole frame was convulsed with sobs, and Dr Palmer was giving him a few words of concluding rebuke, when a hasty knock came at the door; and William, without waiting for the"]]]
