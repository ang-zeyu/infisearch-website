[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21909"],["title","A Military Genius (#7)"],["body","the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln, so long as Maryland remained in the Union.  The ruthless assault upon the Massachusetts troops in Baltimore, as they were passing through on their way to Washington, on the 19th of April, with the antecedent and attendant circumstances, roused to the highest degree the passions of all who sympathized with the secession movement, and the mob became for the time being the controlling force of that city. So largely in the ascendant was it and so confident were the disunionists in consequence that they, without warrant of law, assumed the responsibility of issuing a call for the Legislature of Maryland to convene in Baltimore. Governor Hicks, fearing that the Legislature would respond to the call, and that if it did it would yield to the predominant spirit, give voice to the purpose of the mob, and adopt an act of secession, resolved to forestall such action by convening that body to meet at Frederick City, away from the violent and menacing demonstrations of Baltimore.  The Legislature thus assembled contained a number of leading members who were ready at once for unconditional secession. There were also others who, with them, would constitute a majority and would vote for the measure could they be sustained by public sentiment, but who were not prepared to give that support without that assurance. The field of conflict was, therefore, transferred from the halls of legislation to the State at large, and to the homes of their constituents, and there the battle raged during the summer of 1861. In that conflict of ideas Miss Carroll bore an earnest and prominent part, and the most distinguished men have given repeated evidence that her labors were largely instrumental in thwarting the secessionists and saving Maryland to the Union. The objective point of the labors of the disunion leaders was a formal act of secession, by which Maryland would become an integral portion of the Confederacy, not only affording moral and material aid to the Southern cause, but relieving the rebel armies in crossing the Potomac from the charge, which at that stage of the conflict the leaders were anxious to avoid, of ignoring their vaunted doctrine of State rights by invading the territory of sovereign States. With the usual arguments that were urged to fire the Southern heart and to reconcile the people to the extreme remedy of revolution, special prominence was given to what was stigmatized as the arbitrary and unconstitutional acts of President Lincoln. To place the people in possession of the true theory of their institutions and to define and defend the war powers of the Government were the special purposes of Miss Carroll's labors during these eventful months.\"  It would not be possible in the compass of this paper to set forth circumstantially all the important questions that arose in the progress of the war, in the discussion of which Miss Carroll took part; but it is proper to say that on every material issue, from the inception of the rebellion to the final reconstruction of the seceded States, she contributed through the newspapers, in pamphlet form, and by private correspondence to the discussion of important subjects. Governor Hicks bore the brunt of this terrible conflict, greatly aided by Miss Carroll's public and private support, and stimulated by such inspiring letters as the following:                        WASHINGTON HOUSE, WASHINGTON CITY, _Jan. 16, 1861_.       My Dear Governor:       I have for some days intended to write and express my cordial      admiration and gratitude for the noble stand you have now taken      in behalf of the Union by the public address issued on the 3d      instant. An extended relation with the leading presses of the      country has enabled me in a public and more efficient manner to      testify to this and create a public opinion favorable to your      course of patriotic action throughout the land. Many of the      articles you have seen emanated from this source.       I feel it will be a gratification to you, in the high and sacred      responsibilities which surround your position, to know from one      who is incapable of flattering or deceiving you the opinion      privately held in this metropolis concerning your whole course      since the secession movement in the South was practically      initiated.       With all the friends of the Union with whom I converse, without      regard to section or party, your course elicits the most      unbounded applause. I might add to this the evidences furnished      from private correspondence, but you doubtless feel already the      sympathy and moral support to be derived in this way. I am often      asked if I think you _can_ continue to stand firm under the      frightful pressure brought to bear upon you. I answer, _yes_;      that my personal knowledge enables me to express the confident      belief that nothing will ever induce you to surrender while the      oath to support the Constitution of your country and the vow to      fulfill the obligations of your God rest upon your soul.       As a daughter of Maryland, I am proud to have her destiny in the      hands of one so worthy of her ancient great name; one who will      never betray the sacred trust imposed upon him. \"When God is for      us, no man can be against us,\" is the Christian's courage when      the day of trial comes.       I shall continue to fight your battle to the end.                 Your sincere friend,                                     A. E. CARROLL.  Well might Governor Hicks say to her again and again, as in a letter to her in 1863: \"Your moral and material support I shall never forget in that trying ordeal, such as no other man in this country ever went through.\"  A little further on, Governor Hicks writes as follows:                                     ANNAPOLIS, Md., _December 17, 1861_.       My Dear Miss Carroll:       In the hurry and excitement incident to closing my official      relations to the State of Maryland I cannot find fitting words      to express my high sense of gratitude to you for the kind and      feeling manner in which you express your approval of my whole      term of service in doing all in my power to uphold the honor and      dignity of the State; but especially do I thank you for the      personal aid you rendered me in the last part of my arduous      duties.       When all was dark and dreadful for Maryland's future, when the      waves of secession were beating furiously upon your frail      executive, borne down with private as well as public grief, you      stood nobly by and watched the storm and skillfully helped to      work the ship, until, thank God, helmsmen and crew were safe in      port.              *       *       *       *       *       With great regard, I have the honor to be ever your obedient      friend and servant.                                     T. H. HICKS.  Thus it was that, supported by Miss Carroll, this high-minded and sorely tried man held fast to the end. He went into the struggle a rich man, in a position of worldly honor and prosperity. He came out of it reduced in prosperity, having, like other faithful Southern Unionists, lost his worldly possessions in that great upheaval. Thenceforth he lived, and he died, comparatively a poor man, but one of the noble and faithful who had acted an immortal part in the salvation of his country. All honor to brave and true-hearted Governor Hicks of Maryland!  Thus by her powerful advocacy and influence Miss Carroll largely contributed to securing the State of Maryland to the Union and saving the National Capital, and her writings also had a great effect upon the border States. Besides her numerous letters and newspaper articles, she began writing and publishing, at her own expense, a remarkable series of war pamphlets, which speedily became an important element in the guidance of the country.  Senator John C. Breckenridge, in the July Congress of 1861, made a notable secession speech. Miss Carroll replied to this in a pamphlet containing such clear and powerful arguments that the War Department circulated a large edition, and requested her to write on other important points then being discussed with great diversity of opinion.  The following letters give some indication of the timely nature and value of the Breckenridge pamphlet:       My Dear Miss Carroll:       Your refutation of the sophistries of Senator Breckenridge's      speech is full and conclusive. I trust this reply may have an      extended circulation at the present time, as I am sure its      perusal by the people will do much to aid the cause of the      Constitution and the Union.                                     CALEB B. SMITH.[3]                     [Footnote 3: Caleb B. Smith was Secretary of                    Interior in Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet and an old friend                    of Miss Carroll.]         *       *       *       *       *                                     GLOBE OFFICE, _Aug. 8, 1861_.       Dear Miss Carroll:       Allow me to thank you for the privilege of reading your admirable      review of Mr. Breckenridge's speech. I have enjoyed it greatly.      Especially have I been struck with its very ingenious and just      exposition of the constitutional law bearing on the President,      assailed by Mr. B., and with the very apt citation of Mr.      Jefferson's opinion as to the necessity and propriety of      disregarding mere legal punctilio when the source of all is in      danger of destruction. The gradual development of the plot in the      South to overthrow the Union is also exceedingly well depicted      and with remarkable clearness. If spoken in the Senate your      article would have been regarded by the country as a complete and      masterly refutation of Mr. B.'s heresies. Though the peculiar      position of the _Globe_ might preclude the publication of the      review, I am glad that it has not been denied to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21909"],["title","A Military Genius (#8)"],["body","editor of      the _Globe_ to enjoy what the _Globe_ itself has not been      privileged to contain.

The President received a copy      left for him and requested me to thank you cordially for your      able support.       The delay was not voluntary on my part. For some time past my      time and mind have been painfully engrossed by very urgent public      duties, and my best affections stirred by the present condition      of Missouri, my own neglected and almost ruined State; and this      is the reason why I have been so long deprived of the pleasure      and instruction of perusing your excellent pamphlet.       I remain, with great respect and regard, your friend and      obedient servant,                                     EDWARD BATES.[5]                     [Footnote 5: Edward Bates was the Attorney General                    of Mr. Lincoln's Cabinet and an intimate friend of                    Miss Carroll.]         *       *       *       *       *                                     APPLEBY, _Sept. 22, 1861_.       My Dear Miss Carroll:       I will thank you very much if you will send me a couple of      hundred copies of your reply to Breckenridge, with bill of      expenses for the same. I do not think it is right that you should      furnish your publications gratis any longer. I told our friends      in Baltimore last week that the Union State Committee must go to      work and send your documents over the entire State if they expect      to carry this election. Mr. Mayer and Mr. Fickey, of the      committee, said they would make application to you immediately      and pay for all you can supply.       No money can ever pay for what you have done for the State and      the country in this terrible crisis, but I trust and believe the      time will come when all will know the debt they owe you.       With great respect, your friend and obedient servant,                                     THOS. H. HICKS.         *       *       *       *       *                                     BALTIMORE, _Oct. 2, 1861_.       Miss Carroll:       If you could let me have more of your last pamphlet in answer to      Breckenridge, I could use them with great effect. I have      distributed from my house on Camden street all the committee      could furnish me. I set my son at the door with paper and pencil,      and five hundred men called for it in one day. These are the bone      and sinew of the city, wanting to know which army to enter.      Please send as many as you can spare. They go like hot cakes.                 Yours very respectfully,                                     JAMES TILGHMAN.         *       *       *       *       *  A. S. Diven, in the House of Representatives, January 22, 1862:       \"She signs herself Anna Ella Carroll. I commend her answer on the      doctrine of the war power to those who have been following that      phantom and misleading the people, and I recommend it to another      individual, a friend of mine, who gave a most learned      disquisition on the writ of _habeas corpus_ and against the power      of the President to imprison men. He will find that answered. I      am not surprised at this. The French Revolution discovered great      political minds in some of the French women, and I am happy to      see a like development in our women.\"  Judge Diven subsequently addressed the following letter to Miss Carroll:                                     WASHINGTON, _February 9, 1862_.       I thank you for the note of the 6th. Your pamphlet I have read      with satisfaction, as I had your former publication. I have no      desire to appear complimentary, but cannot forbear the expression      of my admiration of your writings. There is a cogency in your      argument that I have seldom met with. Such maturity of judicial      learning with so comprehensive and concise a style of      communication surprises me. Ladies have certainly seldom evinced      ability as jurists--it may be because the profession was not      their sphere--but you have satisfied me that at least one might      have been a distinguished lawyer. Go on, madam, in aiding the      cause to which you have devoted your talent; your country needs      the labor of all her defenders. If the time will ever come when      men will break away from passion and return to reason your labors      will be appreciated; unless that time soon arrives, alas for this      Republic; I have almost despaired of the wisdom of men. God's      ways are mysterious, and my trust in Him is left me as a ground      of hope.       I have the honor to be, madam, your obedient servant,                                     A. S. DIVEN.[6]                     [Footnote 6: A. S. Diven was Member of Congress                    from New York, a railroad man, and, I think, is                    still living.]         *       *       *       *       *                                     BALTIMORE, _May 9, 1874_.       Miss Carroll:       After the Presidential election in 1860 a Union Association was      formed in Baltimore and I was elected chairman, which position I      held until the Union party was formed in Maryland in 1861, when      Brantz Mayer was made chairman and I was appointed treasurer, and      held the position until 1863. We commenced at once to circulate      your publications and sent them broadcast over the entire State.       When we appealed to you, you furnished them most liberally, and      to our surprise and the relief of our treasury you informed us      you made no charge.       All were disposed to give your articles a careful perusal, and      many instances came to my knowledge of the great positive good      they effected in keeping men within the Union party when the      first blow of secession had been struck.

I most cheerfully indorse the papers respecting your publications      under the authority of the War Department. Mr. Richard S. Coxe, I      can say, is one of the ablest lawyers in this District or in the      country. In his opinion of your writings I entirely concur as      with other men who have expressed one. I regret that I am without      the influence to serve you at the War Department, but Mr.      Lincoln, with whom I have conversed, has, I know, the highest      appreciation of your services in this connection. Judge Collamer,      whom I regard as among the first of living statesmen and      patriots, is enthusiastic in praise of your publications, and,      indeed, I have heard but one opinion expressed by all the able      men who have referred to them.                 Sincerely yours,                                     R. J. WALKER.[8]                     [Footnote 8: R. J. Walker was long a Representative                    in Congress, Secretary of the Treasury under James                    K. Polk, and was acknowledged as the best financier                    of his day.]  In September of 1861 Miss Carroll prepared a paper on \"the Constitutional powers of the President to make arrests and to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_.\" In December, 1861, she published a pamphlet entitled \"The War Powers of the Government.\" This was followed by a paper entitled \"The Relation of Revolted Citizens to the National Government.\" This was written at the especial request of President Lincoln, approved by him, and adopted as the basis of his subsequent action.                                     WASHINGTON, _January 25, 1861_.       My Dear Miss Carroll:       I read the address of Governor Hicks, which gave me great      pleasure. I have been overwhelmed with work and anxiety for North      Carolina. I franked all the papers you sent me. It is a great      matter for the Union that you hold Maryland firm now.       Go on in your great work. I wish you would say a word for S----      in some of your articles; he is doing us good, but needs      encouragement.       I wish to talk with you on these matters as soon as I can find a      moment.                 Respectfully and sincerely your friend,                                     JOHN A.
