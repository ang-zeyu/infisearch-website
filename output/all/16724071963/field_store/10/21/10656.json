I'm burning up clean from my mouth to my stomach!\"  \"You're no worse off than I am,\" spluttered Glutts. \"Oh, just wait until I get hold of that Walt Baxter!\"  \"It was the whole bunch that did it. I'll bet the trick was gotten up by those Rovers!\"  The door was flung open, and all of the occupants of the room dashed out into the hallway, bent upon getting to the nearest bathroom or water cooler for a drink. Not one of them noticed the slippery banana skins spread out on the floor, and on the instant Bill Glutts went sliding along and came down flat on his back. Carncross did likewise, Codfish tripping over him and pitching headlong.  \"Say! what's this?\" exploded Glutts. \"Oh, my back! I guess I've broken my shoulder.\"  \"They must have soaked the floor,\" came from Carncross. \"No! It's banana skins,\" he added, in deep disgust. \"Say, Codfish, take your feet off my stomach, will you?\"  \"I--I couldn't help falling over you, you went down so suddenly,\" apologized the sneak. \"Oh dear! let me get a drink of water--I'm all on fire inside.\"  The Rovers and their chums had retreated to a distance, and this was wise, for, had Glutts and Carncross been able to get hold of them, there would certainly have been a fight. But as it was, the bully and his cronies passed down a back corridor to the nearest bathroom, where they proceeded to wash out their mouths and get a long drink.  \"Now we'd better get back to our rooms and get into bed as soon as possible,\" said Jack. \"They may report us, and some of the professors may come around to investigate.\"  \"Let them come! We'll all be asleep like so many innocent lambs,\" remarked Randy.  \"They'll find that I've been asleep for the last two hours,\" added Walt Baxter, and at this the others had to smile.  The crowd separated, and the four Rovers returned to their rooms, where they lost no time in getting rid of all the evidences of the feast. Then they undressed, turned out the lights, and crept into their beds.  \"I don't believe they'll dare to report this,\" whispered Andy to his twin. And in this surmise the fun-loving Rover was correct. Glutts and his cronies did a good deal of grumbling, but there the matter, for the time being, ended.  \"But I'll get square some day! You just wait and see!\" Glutts told the others.  The school term was now drawing to an end, and it was definitely announced that, owing to the war conditions, Colby Hall would remain closed for a period of six weeks for the winter holidays. This would give the Rovers and their chums a full month's vacation after New Year's.  \"And what a good time we will have up at Cedar Lodge!\" cried Fred.  \"It certainly was grand of Gif to ask us to go up there with him and Spouter,\" added Jack.  The Rovers and their chums, and especially Walt Baxter, kept a close eye on Bill Glutts and his cronies. But beyond scowling at them whenever they passed, the bully did nothing regarding the peppered food which had been presented.  \"He's laying low for something, I suppose,\" said Walt. \"However, I'm not going to worry.\"  One day he received a \"soaker\" of a snowball in his left ear while hurrying to the gymnasium. He did not know who threw the missile, but was satisfied in his mind that it came from either Glutts or Carncross.  The examinations for the term were held, and much to the Rover boys' satisfaction all acquitted themselves creditably. Spouter and Gif did very well too, and were equally elated.  \"Let us go down to town this evening and celebrate,\" suggested Jack that afternoon. \"I think Captain Dale will let us go, and I understand they are giving a very good war picture at Mr. Falstein's moving picture theater.\"  \"That will suit me,\" answered Fred.  The matter was talked over by a number of the cadets, and they went to see Captain Dale about it; and as a result nine of them set out for Haven Point, where was located the moving picture theater at which Jack and his cousins first met the girls from Clearwater Hall.  \"This looks like a pretty good picture,\" remarked Gif, as he pointed to one advertised on the billboards. \"A real war play with some of the scenes taken at the front.\"  \"Either at the front or on the Hackensack Meadows,\" remarked Randy dryly. \"They tell me that more than three-fourths of those so-called war pictures are faked up.\"  \"Well, you wouldn't expect the moving picture actors to go right out in the middle of a battlefield and perform, would you?\" queried Jack.  \"Here's a good comic, too!\" put in Fatty Hendry. \"That suits me all right. I like a good laugh.\"  \"Fatty, you ought to go in the movies,\" remarked Fred. \"You would make a hit as the Living Skeleton.\"  \"He would unless his face broke the camera,\" added Ned Lowe.  \"I understand some of those fat fellows in the movies get a couple of hundred dollars a week for acting,\" said Fatty. \"I wouldn't mind doing some of those stunts myself at that price.\"  The cadets purchased their tickets and were soon inside the showhouse. An educational film was being thrown on the screen, and they were much interested in seeing the details of tanning leather and making leather belts, handbags, and shoes.  \"Gee! how easy it is to learn about these things in a moving picture,\" remarked Gif.  \"What a pity it is they can't teach a fellow algebra and geometry in the same way,\" sighed Randy.  The educational film was followed by the war play, and whether this was given with faked-up backgrounds or not, it proved to be a very interesting production, especially to the Rover boys. There were pictures of life in the soldiers' camps and on the transports bound for Europe, and then scenes of life in the French trenches, culminating in a terrific bombardment by big cannons, and then a thrilling charge over No-Man's Land.  \"Gee, isn't that immense!\" murmured Fred. \"Think of dad being in such a charge as that!\"  \"It brings the war pretty close, doesn't it, Fred?\" asked Jack.  The scenes of the mighty conflict not alone thrilled the Rover boys but also sobered them, especially when there came a picture of the dead and the dying, with the ambulances rushing hither and thither to take the wounded to the field hospitals.  Poor Fred felt the tears coming into his eyes, and was glad that the moving picture house was rather dark, so that he might use his handkerchief without being noticed.  The war picture was followed immediately by one depicting the trials and tribulations of a fat man who obtained a position as a bell-boy in a country hotel. He did some wonderful stunts, and managed to break up a great deal of crockeryware and innumerable pies, and this set all the cadets, as well as the majority of the audience, to roaring with laughter.  \"I guess those fellows earn their money,\" remarked Spouter to Fatty. \"Just think of being slammed around in front of the camera like that!\"  \"Yes. And think of having three or four pies plastered all over your face,\" returned the stout youth. \"I guess, after all, I'd rather go into ordinary business.\"  \"I imagine some of those so-called stunts are only trick pictures--I mean those things like climbing up the side of a house and holding on to the top of a church steeple,\" remarked Jack. \"Just the same, those moving picture actors have to risk their lives more than once, especially when they take wild rides on horse-back or in automobiles, or get in railroad smash-ups.\"  Immediately following the comic picture, all the lights in the theater were turned on and a gentleman stepped on the stage to address the audience.  \"I wonder what he's going to talk about,\" whispered Randy.  \"Liberty Loan, or something like that, I suppose,\" answered his twin.  He was right. There was a new drive on to raise money for the Government to be used for war purposes, and this gentleman, as a member of the local committee, had come forth to urge every man and woman in the audience to invest in Liberty Bonds.  \"That is what my father was doing in and around New York before he went to war,\" explained Andy to Walt Baxter. \"He made quite a success of it, too. He was on a whole lot of committees.\"  \"And he did a lot of work for the Red Cross, too,\" added Randy.  While the lights were turned on the cadets had a chance to look around the showhouse. They thought that possibly some of the girls from Clearwater Hall might be present, but they were disappointed.  The talk about Liberty Bonds had come to an end, and several men and women were passing through the audience trying to get subscribers for the bonds when half a dozen newcomers entered the moving picture theater. One of the number was in cadet uniform, and as he came down the aisle and took a seat on the other side of the showhouse, Jack caught Fred by the arm.  \"Look who's here, will you?\" he whispered excitedly.  \"Why, it's Bill Glutts!\" returned Fred.  \"Exactly! And do you see who is with him?\"  \"No. I can't make out. Who is it?\"  \"Gabe Werner!\"  \"Gabe Werner! Are you sure, Jack?\"  \"Positive! I saw him full in the face just before he sat down.\"  Soon the lights in the showhouse went out once more, and the moving picture performance continued.     CHAPTER VII  THE END OF THE TERM   \"What can Gabe Werner be doing around here?\" questioned Randy, who had heard the conversation between his two cousins.  \"I'm sure I don't know,\" answered Jack. \"He doesn't live anywhere in this vicinity, and I thought after he left the school he went home.\"  \"Evidently Glutts must have known about his being here, otherwise they wouldn't be together,\" said Andy.  Jack stood up so that he might get a better view of the other side of the showhouse. He noticed several vacant seats directly behind those occupied by Glutts and Werner.  \"I'm going to slip over there just as soon as the lights are turned down,\" he said to Fred. \"If they are hatching out any mischief perhaps we'll hear something worth listening to.\"  \"I'll go with you,\" was the ready "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22012"],["title","The Rover Boys on a Hunt; or, The Mysterious House in the Woods (#7)"],["body","reply.  The pair explained to the others what they were about to do, and then slipped out of their seats and made their way to the back of the moving picture theater. Then, when the lights were being turned out, they moved forward and slipped into two seats directly behind Glutts and Werner without being noticed by the two bullies.  The educational film was now being shown again, and this caused Glutts to give a snort of disgust.  \"I don't care for that sort of stuff,\" said the wholesale butcher's son. \"I wish they would put on the war play. Tell me some more about this scheme you've got for spending the winter holidays.\"  \"Oh, it's a dandy scheme, all right, Bill,\" responded Werner. And then he began a description of a winter's camp and told how he had permission to go there and how he wanted Glutts to go with him.  While Gabe Werner was speaking some people sitting next to him had arisen and were trying to get out. Gabe and Bill arose, and as they did so the former turned around and caught sight of the two Rovers.  \"Say! what do you know about this?\" he cried in astonishment.  \"Jack Rover and Fred Rover!\" murmured Glutts, and his face likewise betrayed astonishment.  \"Did you fellows follow us into the theater?\" demanded Werner.  \"We certainly did not,\" returned Fred quickly. \"We were in the theater long before you came in.\"  \"Huh!\" Werner was stumped for a moment. \"I didn't notice them here, did you?\" he questioned his crony.  \"If I had I should have taken a seat elsewhere,\" was Glutts' ready reply. He glared at the Rovers. \"I suppose you have been listening to everything we said.\"  \"If you don't want to be heard you had better not talk in a place like this,\" replied Jack.  \"I don't care what they did hear,\" grumbled Werner. \"I'm not ashamed of what I am doing or intend to do.\"  \"If I were you, Glutts, I'd cut Werner,\" advised Fred. \"Captain Dale won't give you any credit for sticking to him after what happened at the encampment.\"  \"I suppose you are going to tell Captain Dale you saw me with him,\" retorted Glutts.  \"I shan't say a word unless I am questioned.\"  \"I haven't forgotten what happened at the encampment,\" said Gabe Werner, turning to Jack. \"Some day I'm going to square accounts with you.\"  \"When that time comes I think I'll be able to defend myself, Werner,\" answered the young captain coldly.  By this time a number of people in the audience were turning around, evidently annoyed by the conversation. One heavy-set man turned back and tapped Werner on the shoulder.  \"Say, if you fellows want to hold a talk-fest, go outside and do it,\" he growled. \"We want to look at the pictures.\"  \"Come ahead, Jack,\" whispered Fred. \"It won't do us any good to stay here, now that Glutts and Werner have discovered our presence.\"  \"Right you are,\" was the answer. And a moment later the two Rovers slipped out of their seats and made their way to the rear of the showhouse. Here they were joined by the others of their crowd; and all went outside and across the street to a drugstore, where Jack treated the others to hot chocolate soda.  \"They are hatching out something, that is sure,\" remarked Jack.  \"As near as I could make out, Werner is going off into the woods on a hunt and wants Glutts to go with him,\" returned Fred. \"I wonder where they are going?\"  No one could answer that question, and presently the crowd began to talk of other things, and especially of the war play they had just witnessed.  \"Gosh! but a play like that brings the war pretty close to a fellow,\" said Randy, with a sigh.  \"Makes a fellow think of how our dads are making out over there, doesn't it?\" said Fred.  \"When they showed those ambulance scenes with all the dead and dying lying around it gave me the cold shivers,\" came from Andy. \"I tell you what--war is a terrible thing.\"  \"Yes, and you have got to see something like that to realize how really terrible it is,\" put in Jack.  Several days later the term at Colby Hall came to an end. There was something of an entertainment, with prize speaking in which Spouter distinguished himself, and then came the final drill and parade around the campus. Following this the cadets indulged in several snowball fights and in quite some horseplay, and then rushed off to their rooms to pack their suitcases and other baggage so as to be ready to depart for home in the early morning.  \"Wow! but it feels good to know I haven't got to look at a grammar or an algebra for the next few weeks,\" cried Randy, with satisfaction.  \"Say! it makes me feel as happy as a clown in a circus,\" declared Andy, and, in high spirits, he began a jig and ended by turning a flip-flap over one of the beds. Then he and his twin indulged in a pillow fight, in which Fred joined.  \"Hi, you fellows! stop your rumpus,\" cried Jack, who was trying to pack his suitcase. \"You keep on, and you'll have the ceiling of the floor below down.\"  \"Can't help it!\" cried Andy gayly. \"We've got to break loose once in a while,\" and he playfully landed a cake of soap in the open suitcase.  \"I'll soap you!\" cried the young captain, and, taking the article in question, he made a leap over the bed, caught his cousin by the neck, and allowed the cake of soap to slip down Andy's back.  \"Great salt mackerel!\" ejaculated the fun-loving Rover, and, pulling his coat tight, he arched his back. \"Anybody notice the camel's hump?\"  \"It isn't a hump, Andy. It's only a wart on your backbone,\" answered his twin.  \"Well, hump or wart, it isn't going to stay there very long,\" remarked the other, and immediately proceeded to stand on his hands, shaking his body in such a manner that presently the soap rattled out on the floor. Then quietness was restored for the time being, and the Rovers continued their packing.  A conference was held with Gif, and it was decided that all of the crowd were to go home for Christmas. Several days later the Rovers were to meet Gif and Spouter at Portview, and then all would proceed to Cedar Lodge.  \"And don't forget to bring your guns and all your other traps,\" said Gif.  \"You trust us for that!\" responded Fred.  \"We'll be there with everything that is necessary outside of the provisions. Those, of course, we can get at Portview or at Timminsport.\"  \"I hope we get a chance at a moose,\" sighed Randy.  \"Gee! Why don't you make it a lion or an elephant or a polar bear while you are at it?\" cried his twin. \"Might as well wish for everything in the menagerie. It doesn't cost any more,\" and at this there was a general smile.  \"I know what I'd like to get,\" said Jack. \"I was reading about one in the paper the other day. They must be beautiful creatures.\"  \"What's that?\" questioned Gif.  \"A silver fox.\"  \"Oh, say, Jack! that would be fine. But I imagine silver foxes are exceedingly rare.\"  \"Oh, I know that. Just the same, I'd like to bag one. The fur would make a very fine piece for some lady to wear.\"  \"Ruth Stevenson, for instance,\" murmured Andy; and at this his cousin made a playful pass at him with his fist, which the fun-loving Rover easily dodged.  The next morning the cadets had an early breakfast, and a short while later saw many of them on their way by carriage and automobile to Haven Point. Many girls were also coming in from Clearwater Hall, so that the railroad station present an unusually lively appearance.  In the crowd was Bill Glutts, but he took care to keep away from the Rovers. Gabe Werner was nowhere to be seen, and the Rovers rightfully conjectured that he had left the town.  The boys had hardly arrived when a carry-all came in from Clearwater Hall containing Mary and Martha, as well as Ruth and May and a dozen other girl students. There was a general handshaking, and then all took a stand on the station platform to wait for the coming of two trains which were to bear the various students in opposite directions. Everybody had already procured a ticket, and the trains which were expected were extras, for it would have been impossible for the ordinary locals to have taken care of such heavy traffic.  \"I am sorry you're not going to travel with us to New York,\" said Jack to Ruth.  \"Well, I'm sorry you're not coming my way,\" answered the girl, with a smile.  \"But you'll be down to our house directly after Christmas, won't you?\"  \"Yes, we'll be down the day after--May and I.\"  \"Well, that will give us a whole day together, anyhow, before us fellows start for Cedar Lodge,\" went on the young captain. Then he nudged Ruth in the elbow. \"Come over here,\" he whispered. \"I want to show you something that I don't want the others to see.\"  Together they slipped out of the crowd and around the corner of the little railroad station. Then Jack brought out a large flat package from an inner pocket of his overcoat. \"I had these taken as a Christmas surprise to mother and Martha. What do you think of them?\" and he brought forth several photographs of himself taken in his cadet uniform. They had been taken by the leading photographer of Haven Point who made a specialty of work for the two schools, and they certainly showed the young captain at his best.  \"Oh, how lovely, Jack!\" cried Ruth in genuine pleasure. \"I declare, they are splendid pictures.\"  \"Then you like them?\" he queried anxiously.  \"I certainly do! I don't think they could be better.\" She looked at the three poses presented critically. \"If it's all the same to you, I'll keep this one,\" she said finally.  \"Oh, Ruth, you don't want my picture, do you?\" he questioned, and there was a trace of wistfulness in his voice.  \"Of course I do, Jack. I can keep this one, can't I?\" and the girl looked full at him in a manner that spoke volumes.  \"Why, sure! if you want it,\" he answered quickly. \"But, say! don't I get one of yours in return?\" he added.  \"Well, I'll see about that,\" she hesitated.  \"Oh, now, Ruth--\"  \"I haven't had one taken in an awfully long time, Jack.\"  \"Never mind, you will let me have one of them anyhow, won't you?\"  \"I--I guess--maybe so. I'll give it to you for a Christmas present."]]]
