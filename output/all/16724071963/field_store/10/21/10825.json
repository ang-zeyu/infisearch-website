One evening Alan came home to find his wife much worse than she had ever been.  He learnt the cause.  She had been sitting with a sick person, and from the hot, sickroom had passed out into the damp evening air.  And this was the result.  The village-doctor was sent for at once; and when, on the next morning, Alan anxiously, tremblingly, asked him the candid truth, it was with an open letter in his hand, with which his fingers nervously played.  It was marked \"On Her Majesty's Service.\"  He must hold himself in readiness to sail within a fortnight.  And the doctor's answer was a fearful crowning to this unexpected tidings.  \"She may linger on for a month,\" he said, \"six weeks at most.  You will have to bid her good-bye for ever when you go.  No skill can make her live till you come home.\"  Alan never uttered a word, but his face was very pale, and a great shudder passed over his frame.  \"It is very, very sad for you,\" said the little doctor, \"I pity you from my heart.\"  And then he jolted away down the lane in his shaky trap, drawn by his broken-winded pony.  And Alan turned into the farm, and was soon by his wife's side.  So the fortnight passed, and the good-bye was said; and this is why that good-bye was so unutterably sad; and this is all that Harry could not understand.     CHAPTER III.  SAD INFORMATION.  Mother and son--Returning fortitude--Self-devoted.   It was drawing close upon the half-yearly examination at the Grammar School, and Harry was beginning to grow very frightened and nervous, for a new boy had been put into his class since the last examination, and he feared the newcomer would supplant him, and get to the head.  So, as soon as the sad good-bye, told of in the first chapter of this little tale, was said, and Harry had tried in vain to comfort his mother, he got his books and set to work.  And the clock ticked, and Harry pored over his delectus; and in the corner Mrs Campbell sat and wept.  Presently she called Harry to her.  \"Harry, dear, I am better now; I won't cry any more.  Come and sit by me.\"  And so Harry went.  And then she talked quietly to him about his work at school, and how she hoped that one day he would be able to go to Oxford.  It was well for her, poor thing, she had these little makeshifts for conversation.  That which lay nearest her heart, was now too much well-nigh for words to express.  \"You are young now, dear boy, but still old enough to know that your after-life depends on yourself; and if you work steadily on, you can win a scholarship.\"  \"What is a scholarship, mamma?\"  \"A sum of money, dear, which is allowed you every year while you are at Oxford, to help to pay your expenses.  Because, you know, papa couldn't afford to pay all the money it would cost while you were there.\"  \"And why couldn't you pay it, mamma?\"  \"I shall not be here then, dear boy,\" said Mrs Campbell, very softly.  \"But you will be wherever I am, mamma.\"  \"I shall be sleeping in the churchyard, darling boy; over yonder, under the tall, grey tower.\"  Harry burst out impetuously:  \"No, you shan't die, mamma!  Why should you die?  I won't let you go!\"  And Harry sobbed as though his heart would break.  For his sake, Mrs Campbell seemed to win strength and quietness.  And taking him gently by the hand she led him upstairs to bed, sat by him till he was heavily asleep, his face all stained with tears, and then went wearily downstairs again, took her writing desk, and began a letter to her husband.     CHAPTER IV.  WILTON SCHOOL.  The examination--Wilton school--Harry's class-room--Absorbed--Prized possessions--Too busy--Cribbing--Misplaced sympathy--Harry blushes.   The morning sun shone brightly over Wilton as Harry started to school; brightly over the dancing waters of the roadstead; and the seawind sang gaily through the wave-washed piles of the pier.  The school-bell was ringing lustily as Harry passed through the iron gates into the playground.  Everything was in bustle and confusion.  Bats and balls were laid aside; jackets thrust on hastily; rough heads smoothed by hot hands.  From their different house-doors the masters were emerging, putting on, as they came, gowns, some brand-new, some rusty and worn. The whole stream was setting in one and the same direction, towards the doors of the school-buildings.  And by the time the bell's last clang had ceased, masters and boys were duly assembled in their respective places in the big school-room.  Prayers over, Dr Palmer announced, amid breathless silence, the regulations respecting the examination, which was unexpectedly to begin, in part, that morning.  Who does not remember those anxious, nervous days, before the examination; the anticipation worse, if possible, than the actual realisation; the visions of questions unanswered, translations sent up full of mistakes, sums that never would come out right, problems that never would be proved?  For the first few days questions, to be answered on paper, would be set to the whole school according to their respective work and classes.  On the fifth day the examiner would arrive; he would commence at the bottom of the school, and, taking two classes each day, examine them _viv√¢ voce_.  This was the substance of Dr Palmer's speech; and then the business of the morning began.  The different classes and their masters filed away into their particular rooms, Dr Palmer and the senior form being left alone in the big school-room.  The greater portion of the school-buildings, it should be stated, had been converted some years ago from the remains of an old monastery. Standing on a slight eminence, and backed by a deep belt of firs, broad meadows sloped from it, straight down to a grey shingly beach, where the boys used to bathe.  Three sides only had left their ruins behind; and these were accordingly rebuilt, as closely after the original style as was possible.  There was the shadowy row of cool cloisters, edging the square smooth-shaven plot of grass, which no boy was allowed to cross.  Then all round the building above the cloisters were various class-rooms; and at the end of one wing stood the chapel, and at the other, the big school-room.  Harry's class-room was in one corner, and consequently was darker than most of the others; but this the boys liked in the summer; it was such a contrast after the glaring sun that streamed in through the windows of the big school-room.  And Harry's place, too, in the room, he specially liked; close to the window, he could look out, through its ivied frame, across the smooth green lawn, away down the meadows to the distant sea.  And who can wonder that the sight of the heaving billows brought thoughts of his father to him many a time and oft?  But many a time, too, those dreams were snapt by the voice of Mr Prichard, his master--  \"Campbell, attend to your work;\" or, \"Campbell, don't look out of the window;\" or, when in a facetious mood, \"Campbell, you cannot learn your delectus by the light of nature.\"  But this morning, Harry was far too occupied to stare about.  Not that he was thinking specially of what his mother had told him the night before, that she would soon be gone away from him; childlike, he had almost forgotten that, or at any rate the examination, for the time being, absorbed his whole attention.  And like us all, he could not realise the sorrow his mother's words conveyed.  Who of us, indeed, does not feel, even when standing over the grave of some dear one dead, even when decking the green mound with flowers--feel it is well-nigh impossible fully to realise that those hands, now laid white beneath the mould, will never again be clasped in ours on earth.  So it is no wonder that Harry was in his usual good spirits; with this only difference, that the examination into whose depths he had now plunged, was filling him with nervous excitement and terrified interest.  Each boy had a desk and stool to himself, and to the little boys the desk-key was a proud possession.  The sixteen desks were ranged in even rows, Mr Prichard's being at the opposite end, it so happened, to Harry's place.  By Harry sat Egerton the new boy, the dreaded rival; and as they bent, side by side, over their desks, their pens and inky fingers scrambling as hard as possible over their papers, many eyes were turned upon them, to see which appeared to be getting on best.  Harry himself was too busy to take any notice of Egerton; and the morning was half-gone, and he had scarcely looked from his desk.  But a sudden impulse or wish to rest awhile, made him pause and lay down his pen.  And this is what met his eyes.  Mr Prichard was standing with his back to the boys, writing some directions on the class notice-board, not hurrying himself, and quite lost in what he was doing.  He was an absent man, was Mr Prichard.  All the boys were busy writing, or scratching their heads (a process commonly supposed to assist meditation), save one, and that was Egerton.  But he was not idle.  He was busy, a great deal too much so.  In his lap lay an open book.  His desk, of course, concealed this from Mr Prichard, and from the rest of the room, except Harry; who, as he sat in the same row with him, alone could see; for Egerton's jacket, carefully pulled forward, screened his proceedings from the boy on his other side.  His eyes were greedily fixed on the book; then he would write a little, then look again, then write again.  He was cribbing.  Harry was so thunderstruck that he stared open-mouthed at him.  Just then he heard Mr Prichard's voice, sterner than usual: \"Campbell, what are you looking at, sir?\"  Poor Harry's heart sank within him.  He could not, would not, tell; that would be sneaking.  And yet he knew from the way in which Mr Prichard spoke that he suspected him of looking over Egerton's paper.  The fact was, Mr Prichard had turned round suddenly, and catching Harry's eyes strained eagerly in the direction of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22183"],["title","Wilton School; or, Harry Campbell's Revenge (#2)"],["body","n's desk, had naturally imagined that he, and not Egerton, was taking an unfair advantage.  Those few words of his sowed a crop of prejudice among the boys against Harry.  \"Campbell's been caught cribbing off Egerton,\" was what rose to the mind and lips of all; and a sort of sympathy grew up in favour of the true culprit, because it appeared that he had been the sufferer.  Naturally enough, there was a slight commotion in the room, and this gave Egerton ample opportunity to hide his book by sitting on it, or--but we must not anticipate.  Soon after, Harry finished his paper, folded it, and walked to Mr Prichard's desk; in his hurry, leaving his own open at the time.  As he handed in his work he said, stammering: \"I wasn't looking at Egerton's paper, sir; indeed I wasn't,\" and then blushed crimson.  Mr Prichard said nothing, but looked very hard at him, and this made Harry blush the more.  Then he went back to his desk (which he never noticed was now closed), locked it, and sat quietly till the class was dismissed; and shortly after was running home to his mother.     CHAPTER V.  MOTHER AND SON.  Very miserable--Past hope--Mother and son--Breaking down--Resignation--\"It is well.\"   The doctor's carriage with the broken-winded pony was standing at the door of the farm.  Mrs Valentine had just come out, and was talking to the doctor's little boy, who sat holding the reins.  \"Hallo, Harry,\" he cried, \"home from school?\"  \"Hush, Master Bromley, don't make such a noise!\" interposed Mrs Valentine.  Without taking any notice of Master Bromley, Harry exclaimed nervously to Mrs Valentine--  \"Is mamma worse, Mrs Valentine?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" the good farmer's wife answered; \"you mustn't go in now. She's very bad, indeed.  Mr Bromley is with her.\"  So Harry ran into the orchard, and sitting down under a tree, felt very miserable.  His mamma was worse--was she really dying now?  The terrible examination--he remembered her words about his work, and going to Oxford.  What was he to do?  Was he to get leave from school, and give up the chance of getting the prize, and stay at home with mamma instead?  But wouldn't that vex her, and perhaps make her worse? Besides, what use could he be at home?  Ah! but if she were to die when he was away?  No, no; he could not go away and leave her.  He must stay with her now!  The examination was nothing!  Such were the thoughts that coursed through Harry's brain; for though only thirteen years old, he was, in point of mind, far beyond his years, not in his school work, but in his ideas and feelings on general subjects of every-day life; and the reason of this was his having had, for so long, his mother as his only companion.  Presently Mrs Valentine came out to him.  Her eyes were very red, for she had been crying.  \"You can come in now, Master Harry.\"  \"Mrs Valentine, is mamma dying?  What can I do?  She mustn't die. Can't Mr Bromley do anything for her?\" cried Harry.  \"No, dear boy.  Mr Bromley can't do anything for her, poor dear; nor any one else either, for the matter of that.  He can only make her easier for the time, like.\"  \"But will mamma die before papa comes home?\"  \"She may die very--very soon,\" sobbed Mrs Valentine.  By this time they were at the door, and Mrs Valentine left Harry to run quietly upstairs to his mother's room.  He found her in bed, looking fearfully white, saving two red hectic spots glowing in her wasted cheeks.  Her hands were dry and hot; and when she began to speak, a fit of coughing made utterance impossible.  Harry sat by the bedside, and burst out crying.  After a few minutes, Mrs Campbell said in a low voice, but so cheerfully--  \"Well, Harry dear, how did the examination go off?\"  \"It's not over, mamma; and, please, don't talk about that.  Are you really going to die, mamma?  Tell me, is it really true?\"  \"Yes, darling boy, I am really going away from you now, and soon, too--very soon.\"  \"What shall I do when you are gone, mamma?  How shall I----\" and here Harry fairly broke down; he could speak no more.  \"Don't cry, Harry; it makes me so sad.  Don't you know I am going to heaven, and there will be no pain there.  I shall not cough any more. You mustn't cry so.  Tell me about school; I like to hear it all.  I am not going to die to-day, darling boy.  We shall have a little longer together.  Tell me about the examination.\"  How Harry longed to pour his story out to her, of Egerton and Mr Prichard.  But he wouldn't do so now.  He would bear it by himself.  He had run home so quickly, meaning to tell her all, and knowing she would believe and pity him, and tell him what to do.  But how could he distress her now?  So he only answered very quietly--  \"I did the paper pretty well, mamma; I think; the examiner doesn't come for two or three days; but--but--you won't be here--then,\" and back came the memory of the fateful message, back came the fears at the thought that he would be alone in the world then.  \"How hot the room is,\" sighed Mrs Campbell.  \"It makes me feel so weak.\"  \"Ah! the air isn't like it was at Malta; is it, mamma?  You told me it was so cool and sweet there; didn't you, mamma?\"  \"Yes, dear boy; but those cool winds have made me like this.  It was sitting out, in the evenings there, that first gave me my cough.  But it was God's will,\" she said half to herself, \"and why should one look to second causes?\"  \"Go and have your dinner, Harry dear or you will be late for school,\" she said to him.  \"Must I go to school, mamma, and leave you?\"  \"Yes, dear,\" she answered, \"it is far better for you to go, as usual. They shall send for you if--if--  Go down now, dear,\" she added, falteringly.  And when Harry hesitatingly left the room, Mrs Campbell turned her face to the wall, and prayed to God, to guard the motherless child; to guard the toilers on the sea; and then she thought of her girlhood, of her bright, strong, healthy days; and then of her marriage in the ominous Scotch mists, of the sojourning at Malta, of the journeyings to and fro; and chiefly of her husband's love, and of her happy life; and from the depths of her heart she thanked God for it all, and confessed that it had indeed \"been well.\"     CHAPTER VI.  INJURED INNOCENCE.  A surprise--Public opinion--Questioned--Circumstantial evidence--Inexorable.   With a heavy heart Harry set out for school; but it was a walk of a mile, and his spirits were very elastic; so that by the time he had settled to his afternoon's work, all his old interest and excitement in the examination had returned.  Again the class sat writing in their corner-classroom, with busy fingers and hushed voices.  At half-past four Mr Prichard rose, contrary to his ordinary custom, to collect the papers.  Harry had just opened his desk hastily for some blotting paper, and as he took the piece from its wonted corner, what was his astonishment to see Egerton's crib lying there.  As he was making assurance doubly sure, that it really was the delectus-crib, he felt a hand on his shoulder, and starting suddenly, found Mr Prichard standing, looking over him into his desk.  \"Give me your paper, Campbell,\" said Mr Prichard; \"and that book!\" he added, sternly.  Harry's heart seemed to rise into his mouth.  He was too frightened to utter a word, but gave up the book immediately with his paper.  The whole affair had so astonished him that he scarcely knew whether he stood on his head or his heels.  \"Stay after school-prayers, Campbell,\" said Mr Prichard, as he passed on, collecting the papers as he went.  Shortly after, the whole class rose, and many were the murmurs, \"Sneak! cribber!\" that greeted Harry's burning ears as they all hurried along towards the big schoolroom.  Poor boy! he felt in a sad strait, for he well knew how hard it would be to clear himself.  However, the consciousness of his innocence gave him a brave heart.  His mother had always told him that, no matter what the consequences were, so long as his conscience told him he was in the right, it was all well; and that seeming misfortunes would but work to his final good.  Prayers over, Harry took up his position at Mr Prichard's desk.  It so happened no boys were kept in that evening, so the rest of the masters were soon gone; but somehow or other the room did not clear so speedily as usual.  Harry's class especially was among the lingerers.  The report had soon spread through the school.  And the boys (the younger ones chiefly), always glad of a row when not themselves concerned, stood peeping through the open doors.  \"Leave the room at once, all of you,\" shouted Mr Prichard, \"unless you want an imposition?\"  Waiting calmly and deliberately till the room was clear, and the doors shut, while Harry longed, and yet dreaded for him to begin, Mr Prichard turned and said--  \"Well, Campbell, what have you to say for yourself?  This morning, I catch you in the act of copying, or attempting to copy, from Egerton's paper; and, now, this afternoon, I find you with a book in your possession, which, you know, you have no business whatever to have.  I suppose this will account for the correctness of your work during the past half-year?  Do you feel very proud of your performance,\" he added, sneeringly, \"when none of it was your own labour or cleverness?\"  Meek-hearted Harry was in tears long before this oration was concluded; and the streaming face and crimson blushes only tended to confirm Mr Prichard's conviction of his guilt.  \"Please, sir, I wasn't copying off Egerton this morning,\" sobbed Harry; \"I wasn't copying off him; and it isn't my book.  It's--it's--it isn't mine, sir!\"  \"It isn't yours, sir?\" cried Mr Prichard, indignantly.  \"Have you the face to contradict me flatly, sir, and say the book does not belong to you?  Whose name is that?\" he cried, holding the delectus-translation, open at its fly-leaf, to Harry.  And there plain enough it was--_Harry Campbell_.  \"No, sir, no; it isn't mine,\" persisted Harry, through his tears.  \"It isn't mine.  I never saw it till this"]]]
