This last is of course ordinary Theism in the form in which it is commonly {25} held by those who are not Idealists.  From a practical and religious point of view there is nothing to be said against such a view.  Still it involves a Dualism, the philosophical difficulties of which I have attempted to suggest to you.  I confess that for my own part the only way in which I can conceive of a single ultimate Reality which combines the attributes of what we call mind with those of what we know as matter is by thinking of a Mind conscious of a world or nature which has no existence except in and for that Mind and whatever less complete consciousnesses that may be.  I trust that those who have failed to follow my sketch of the arguments which lead to this idealistic conclusion may at least be led by it to see the difficulties either of Materialism or of that kind of agnostic Pantheism which, while admitting in words that the ultimate Reality is not matter, refuses to invest it with the attributes of mind.  The argument may be reduced to its simplest form by saying we believe that the ultimate Reality is Mind because mind will explain matter, while matter will not explain mind: while the idea of a Something which is neither in mind nor matter is both unintelligible and gratuitous.  And this line of thought may be supplemented by another.  Whatever may be thought of the existence of matter apart from mind, every one will {26} admit that matter possesses no value or worth apart from mind. When we bring into account our moral judgements or judgements of value, we have no difficulty in recognizing mind as the highest or best kind of existence known to us.  There is, surely, a certain intrinsic probability in supposing that the Reality from which all being is derived must possess at least as much worth or value as the derived being; and that in thinking of that Reality by the analogy of the highest kind of existence known to us we shall come nearer to a true thought of it than by any other way of thinking possible to us.  This is a line of argument which I hope to develope further when I come to examine the bearing upon the religious problem of what is as real a part of our experience as any other--our moral experience.  I will remind you in conclusion, that our argument for the existence of God is at present incomplete.  I have tried to lead you to the idea that the ultimate Reality is spiritual, that it is a Mind which knows, or is conscious of, matter.  I have tried to lead you with the Idealist to think of the physical Universe as having no existence except in the mind of God, or at all events (for those who fail to follow the idealistic line of thought) to believe that the Universe does not exist without such a Mind.  What further relation exists between physical nature and this Universal Spirit, I shall hope in the next lecture {27} to consider; and in so doing to suggest a line of argument which will independently lead to the same result, and which does not necessarily presuppose the acceptance of the idealistic creed.   LITERATURE  The reader who wishes to have the idealistic argument sketched in the foregoing chapter developed more fully should read Berkeley's _Principles of Human Knowledge_.  For the correction of Berkeley's sensationalistic mistakes the best course is to read Kant's _Critique of Pure Reason_ or the shorter _Prolegomena to any future Metaphysic_ or any of the numerous expositions or commentaries upon Kant.  (One of the best is the 'Reproduction' prefixed to Dr. Hutchison Stirling's _Text-book to Kant_.)  The non-metaphysical reader should, however, be informed that Kant is very hard reading, and is scarcely intelligible without some slight knowledge of the previous history of Philosophy, especially of Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, while some acquaintance with elementary Logic is also desirable.  He will find the argument for non-sensationalistic Idealism re-stated in a post-Kantian but much easier form in Ferrier's _Institutes of Metaphysic_.  The argument for a theistic Idealism is powerfully stated (though it is not easy reading) in the late Prof. T. H. Green's _Prolegomena to Ethics_, Book I.  In view of recent realistic revivals I may add that the earlier chapters of Mr. Bradley's _Appearance and Reality_ still seem to me to contain an unanswerable defence of Idealism as against Materialism or any form of Realism, though his Idealism is not of the theistic type defended in the above lecture.  The idealistic argument is stated in a way which makes strongly for Theism by Professor Ward in _Naturalism and Agnosticism_--a work which would perhaps be the best sequel to these lectures for any reader {28} who does not want to undertake a whole course of philosophical reading: readers entirely unacquainted with Physical Science might do well to begin with Part II.  A more elementary and very clear defence of Theism from the idealistic point of view is to be found in Dr. Illingworth's _Personality Human and Divine_.  Representatives of non-idealistic Theism will be mentioned at the end of the next lecture.    [1] _Mind_, vol. iv. (U.S.), 1885.  [2] I do not mean of course that in the earliest stages of consciousness this distinction is actually made; but, if there are stages of consciousness in which the  'I' is not realized, the idea of matter or even of an 'object' or 'not-self' existing apart from consciousness must be supposed to be equally absent.  [3] I have dealt at length with this forgotten thinker in a Presidential Address to the Aristotelian Society, printed in their _Proceedings_ for 1907.  [4] _Principles of Human Knowledge_, pt. i., Sections 18, 20.  [5] _Principles of Human Knowledge_, pt. 1., Section 23.  [6] See Lecture IV., pp. 96-101, 123-6.  [7] I have attempted to meet this line of argument somewhat more adequately, in the form in which it has recently been taken up by Professor HÃ¶ffding in his _Philosophy of Religion_, in a review in the Review of Theology and Philosophy for November, 1907 (vol. iii.).     {29}  LECTURE II  THE UNIVERSAL CAUSE  In my last lecture I endeavoured to show that matter, so far from constituting the ultimate Reality, cannot reasonably be thought of as existing at all without mind; and that we cannot explain the world without assuming the existence of a Mind in which and for which everything that is not mind has its being.  But we are still very far from having fully cleared up the relation between the divine Mind and that Nature which exists in it and for it: while we have hardly dealt at all with the relation between the universal Mind and those lesser minds which we have treated--so far without much argument--as in some way derived from, or dependent upon, that Mind.  So far as our previous line of argument goes, we might have to look upon the world as the thought of God, but not as caused by Him or due to His will.  We might speak of God as 'making Nature,' but only in the sense in which you or I make Nature when we think it or experience it.  {30} 'The world is as necessary to God as God is to the world,' we are often told--for instance by my own revered teacher, the late Professor Green.  How unsatisfactory this position is from a religious point of view I need hardly insist.  For all that such a theory has to say to the contrary, we might have to suppose that, though God is perfectly good, the world which He is compelled to think is very bad, and going from bad to worse.  To think of God merely as the Mind which eternally contemplates Nature, without having any power whatever of determining what sort of Nature it is to be, supplies no ground for hope or aspiration--still less for worship, adoration, imitation.  I suggested the possibility that from such a point of view God might be thought of as good, and the world as bad.  But that is really to concede too much.  A being without a will could as little be bad as he could be good: he would be simply a being without a character. From an intellectual point such a way of looking at the Universe might be more intelligent or intelligible than that of pure Materialism or pure Agnosticism; but morally and religiously I don't know that, when its consequences are fully realized, it is any great improvement upon either of them.[1] {31} Moreover, even intellectually it fails to satisfy the demand which most reflecting people feel, that the world shall be regarded as a Unity of some kind.  If God is thought of as linked by some inexplicable fate to a Nature over which He has no sort of control--not so much control as a mere human being who can produce limited changes in the world,--we can hardly be said to have reduced the world to a Unity. The old Dualism has broken out again: after all we still have God and the world confronting one another; neither of them is in any way explained by the other.  Still less could such a world be supposed to have a purpose or rational end.  For our own mere intellectual satisfaction as well as for the satisfaction of our religious needs we must go on to ask whether we are not justified in thinking of God as the Cause or Creator of the world, as well as the Thinker of it.  This enquiry introduces us to the whole problem of Causality.  The sketch which I gave you last time of Bishop Berkeley's argument was a very imperfect one.  Bishop Berkeley was from one point of view a great philosophic iconoclast, though he destroyed only that he might build up. He destroyed the superstition of a self-existing matter: {32} he also waged war against what I will venture to call the kindred superstition of a mysterious causal nexus between the physical antecedent and the physical consequent.  On this side his work was carried on by Hume."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21995"],["title","Philosophy and Religion (#6)"],["body"," Berkeley resolved our knowledge into a succession of 'ideas.'  He did, no doubt, fall into the mistake of treating our knowledge as if it were a mere succession of feelings: he ignored far too much--though he did not do so completely--that other element in our knowledge, the element of intellectual relation, of which I said something last time.  Here, no doubt, Berkeley has been corrected by Kant; and, so far, practically all modern Idealists will own their indebtedness to Kant.  Even in the apprehension of a succession of ideas, in the mere recognition that this feeling comes after that, there is an element which cannot be explained by mere feeling.  The apprehension that this feeling came after that feeling is not itself a feeling.  But can I detect any relation between these experiences of mine except that of succession?  We commonly speak of fire as the cause of the melting of the wax, but what do we really know about the matter?  Surely on reflection we must admit that we know nothing but this--that, so far as our experience goes, the application of fire is always followed by the melting of the wax.  Where this is the case we do, from the point of view of {33} ordinary life, speak of the one phenomenon as the cause of the other.  Where we don't discover such an invariable succession, we don't think of the one event as the cause of the other.  I shall be told, perhaps, that on this view of the nature of Causality we ought to speak of night as the cause of day.  So perhaps we should, if the result to which we are led by a more limited experience were not corrected by the results of a larger experience.  To say nothing of the valuable correction afforded by the polar winter and the polar summer, we have learned by a more comprehensive experience to replace the law that day follows night by the wider generalisation that the visibility of objects is invariably coincident upon the presence of some luminous body and not upon a previous state of darkness.  But between cases of what we call mere succession and what is commonly called causal sequence the difference lies merely in the observed fact that in some cases the sequence varies, while in others no exception has ever been discovered. No matter how frequently we observe that a sensation of red follows the impact upon the aural nerve of a shock derived from a wave of ether of such and such a length, we see no reason why it should do so.  We may, no doubt, make a still wider generalization, and say that every event in Nature is invariably preceded by some definite complex of conditions, {34} and so arrive at a general law of the Uniformity of Nature.  And such a law is undoubtedly the express or implied basis of all inference in the Physical Sciences.  When we have once accepted that law (as the whole mass of our experience in the purely physical region inclines us to do), then a single instance of A B C being followed by D (when we are quite sure that we have included all the antecedents which we do not know from other experience to be irrelevant) will warrant our concluding that we have discovered a law of nature.  On the next occasion of A B C's occurrence we confidently predict that D will follow.  But, however often we have observed such a sequence, and however many similar sequences we may have observed, we are no nearer to knowing _why_ D should follow ABC: we can only know that it always does: and on the strength of that knowledge we infer, with a probability which we do no doubt for practical purposes treat as a certainty, that it always will.  But on reflection we can see no reason why a wave of ether of a certain length should produce red rather than blue, a colour rather than a sound.  There, as always, we discover nothing but succession, not necessary connexion.  These cases of unvaried succession among phenomena, it should be observed, are quite different from cases of real necessary connexion.  We don't want to examine thousands of instances of two {35} added to two to be quite sure that they always make four, nor in making the inference do we appeal to any more general law of Uniformity.  We simply see that it is and always must be so.  Mill no doubt tells us he has no difficulty in supposing that in the region of the fixed stars two and two might make five, but nobody believes him.  At all events few of us can pretend to such feats of intellectual elasticity.  No amount of contradictory testimony from travellers to the fixed stars, no matter whether they were Bishops of the highest character or trained as Professors of physical Science, would induce us to give a moment's credence to such a story.  We simply see that two and two must make four, and that it is inconceivable they should ever, however exceptionally, make five.  It is quite otherwise with any case of succession among external phenomena, no matter how unvaried.  So long as we confine ourselves to merely physical phenomena (I put aside for the moment the case of conscious or other living beings) nowhere can we discover anything but succession; nowhere do we discover Causality in the sense of a necessary connexion the reversal of which is inconceivable.  Are we then to conclude that there is no such thing as Causality, that in searching for a cause of everything that happens, we are pursuing a mere will o' the wisp, using a mere _vox nihili_ which has {36} as little meaning for the reflecting mind as fate or fortune?  Surely, in the very act of making the distinction between succession and causality, in the very act of denying that we can discover any causal connexion between one physical phenomenon and another, we imply that we have got the idea of Causality in our minds; and that, however little we may have discovered a genuine cause, we could not believe that anything could happen without a cause.  For my own part, I find it quite possible to believe that a phenomenon which has been followed by another phenomenon 9999 times should on the 10,000th time be followed by some other phenomenon.  Give me the requisite experience, and belief would follow; give me even any adequate evidence that another person has had such an experience (though I should be very particular about the evidence), and I should find no difficulty in believing it.  But to tell me that the exception to an observed law might take place without any cause at all for the variation would seem to be pure nonsense.  Put the matter in another way.  Let us suppose an empty world, if one can speak of such a thing without contradiction--let us suppose that at one time nothing whatever had existed, neither mind nor matter nor any of that mysterious entity which some people find it possible to believe in which is {37} neither mind nor matter.  Let us suppose literally nobody and nothing to have existed.  Now could you under these conditions rationally suppose that anything could have come into existence?  Could you for one moment admit the possibility that after countless aeons of nothingness a flash of lightning should occur or an animal be born?  Surely, on reflection those who are most suspicious of _a priori_ knowledge, who are most unwilling to carry their speculations beyond the limits of actual experience, will be prepared to say, 'No, the thing is utterly for ever impossible.'  _Ex nihilo nihil fit_: for every event there must be a cause.  Those who profess to reject all other _a priori_ or self-evident knowledge, show by their every thought and every act that they never really doubt that much.  Now, it would be just possible to contend that we have got the bare abstract concept or category of Causality in our minds, and yet that there is nothing within our experience to give it any positive content--so that we should have to say, 'Every event must have a cause, but we never know or can know what that cause is.  If we are to talk about causes at all, we can only say \"The Unknowable is the cause of all things.\"'  Such a position can be barely stated without a contradiction. But surely it is a very difficult one.  Nature does not generally supply us with categories of thought, while it gives us no power {38} or opportunity of using them.  It would be like holding, for instance, that we have indeed been endowed with the idea of number in general, but that we cannot discover within our experience any numerable things; that we have got the idea of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., but have no capacity whatever for actually counting--for saying that here are three apples, and there four marbles.  And, psychologically, it would be difficult to find any parallel to anything of the kind.  Nature does not first supply us with clearly defined categories of thought, and then give us a material to exercise them upon.  In general we discover these abstract categories by using them in our actual thinking.  We count beads or men or horses before we evolve an abstract idea of number, or an abstract multiplication table.  It is very difficult to see how this idea of Cause could possibly have got into our heads if we had never in the whole course of our experience come into any sort of contact with any actual concrete cause.  Where then, within our experience, if not in the succession of external events, shall we look for a cause--for something to which we can apply this category or abstract notion of causality?  I answer 'We must look within: it is in our experience of volition that we actually find something answering to our idea of causal connexion.'  And here, I would invite you not to think so much of our consciousness of actually {39} moving our limbs.  Here it is possible to argue plausibly that the experience of exercising causality is a delusion.  I imagine that, if I will to do so, I can move my arm; but I will to stretch out my arm, and lo! it remains glued to my side, for I have suddenly been paralysed.  Or I may be told that the consciousness of exerting power is a mere experience of muscular contraction, and the like.  I would ask you to"]]]
