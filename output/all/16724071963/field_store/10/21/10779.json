Tell Mr Alcock I am afraid I will never be able      to repay him his kindness in procuring me this sum upon my very      cavalier notice. With regard to yourself, you know, I suppose, we      have a pretty long account together, and the balance somewhat      against me, as it will always remain.       \"I suppose you will have received my hurried note of last night. I      thought you had entirely forgot my £20 amid the other weighty      matters you had to settle for me. I am still preparing and covering      the Civil Law with rapid strides, but to make one's self master of      a subject so intricate in a fortnight is something of a      consideration; however, I do not despair. I am doing my best, and      if I do not use my utmost endeavour, after what has been done for      me by others, I will allow you to call me anything you please.       \"Still I beg you will not make yourself too sanguine of my success.      In the meantime tell _no one_, not even Robertson, what I am      attempting, that in the case of my being remitted to my studies      (that is the term), it may not be generally known. I give in my      name for examination on Monday next--it takes place on Tuesday      fortnight. But I do not know when I will be acquainted with the      issue. Do not be afraid that I will confuse or disturb myself much      about it. You know I have been accustomed to such things, as eels      are to be skinned.       \"While writing, I have been interrupted by a porter who has come      seething in with a large box. To open a parcel is a most      interesting thing, and the imagination revels with pleasure over      its uncertain contents; but the rich and varied stores of this have      exceeded expectation. I am glad you sent the certificate of      baptism. I do not consider it at all necessary to write by post, as      this goes by a most careful hand; but should I not hear next week      of your having received it, then I _shall_ write by post. Perhaps I      may enclose a receipt to Mr Alcock. He 'hinted,' it seems, 'the      danger of placing so much money,' &c. I have not time to let my      imagination run loose just now, or else I might have pictured to      myself the thousand things which might be done with such a      treasure; but I assure you I never should have thought of anything      (as things now stand) but the intended destination of it, and of      _that_ I shall have enough to think. But you know the fable, or      story rather, of the Priest and the Hostler. I have not time to      tell it you now, but perhaps Robertson can furnish you with it....       \"I remain, my dear mother, your sincerely affectionate son, J. HILL      BURTON.\"         *       *       *       *       *       \"EDINBURGH, _15th December 1830_.       \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--If you had not been in expectation of such an      event, I might have commenced my letter after William's manner,      with saying, 'You will be surprised to hear I have passed,' but as      the matter stands, I must begin with--'I have the satisfaction of      informing you, &c.' It is just about a quarter of an hour since I      was examined, the time being deferred from yesterday to to-day. The      questions were very easy, at least I thought them so, and I think I      answered each. If there were any I did not answer, it was from      abstracting my attention from the more trifling to the more      difficult branches of the law. So far of my examinations are over;      but you must hold in mind that if I do not pass my SCOTS Law trial      in a year, the £50 must still be paid. One thing I have lost by      preparation, the chance of gaining the prize in the Civil Law      class. This is given by the greatest number of correct answers to      one hundred questions. Ten of these have already been answered. _I_      only accomplished _seven_ of them, and consider I have forfeited my      chance. Seven is a good proportion out of ten difficult questions;      but as the person who gains the prize is seldom deficient by above      two or three, I do not conceive I have a chance. You may now tell      whom you please that I have passed, but need not be publishing it      to all the world. Had I _not_ passed, I should have been called a      rash foolish fellow for attempting it; but as it is, it will be      said I have done quite right. You may tell Robertson 'and them,'      and Mrs Brown; and tell Mrs B. I will now have time to write her,      and send a barrel of oysters.... Ask Robertson and Sim and      Cordiner, and so on, to drink my health. I go to a party at Mr      Constable's to-night, the only place (excepting Mr Dauney's) I have      been engaged at since I arrived. I have had nothing whatever to      interfere with my studies for this last fortnight. Tell James and      Mary I can now have time to read their letters. On Saturday Mr G.B.      called on me, asking me to attend a prayer-meeting, and finding I      was busy, told me if I saw things in as clear a light as he did, I      would see the vanity of attending to these earthly things. I trust,      without irreligion, one may say he is mistaken. I write from Mr      Constable's, which is near the Post-office. My dinner-hour is long      past, and the post is just going, so I must bid you adieu. Write me      soon, and inform me how you are pleased with the contents of this.      My 'passage' only cost me 10s. of fee, and 2s. 6d. as fine for      being absent from the Society. I hope you are all well, and remain,      my dear mother, your affectionate and dutiful son, J. HILL BURTON.\"         *       *       *       *       *       \"EDINBURGH, _17th December 1830_.       \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I supposed you received my last letter, written      somewhat hurriedly, but of which I suppose you were able to      discover the principal fact. Since writing, I have been relaxing      myself a little, and going about making a few calls, a thing I have      neglected of late; but I beg you will not suppose this to be a hint      that I am to grow idle. I intend, indeed, to be very busy all      winter. I expect to hear from you soon, and to know what is doing      in Aberdeen. I called upon Mrs H. to-night, who told me my      grand-aunt had been very unwell lately. I trust this is a mistake;      but not having heard from your quarter for some days, the fact may      be so, without my having known it.... I just despatched the      oysters, and I would wish that you could send to Mr Dyce, and      inquire whether they have come free of expense, as I left money      with the seller to pay the coach-hire. I have not sent you any, as      they are rather dear--8s. 8d. for a barrel with two hundred. Now, I      presume you might buy the same number in Aberdeen for about quarter      the sum.       \"I live here in a sort of honourable solitude--few acquaintances,      and few annoyances; it is just the sort of life I like. I am to      have one or two of the young men I know to spend Saturday evening      with me, and to discuss your nice plum-cakes which I have just cut.      Among them is a young Pole--a Count Lubienski, a very agreeable and      intelligent gentleman--a class-fellow.       \"I may now, by the way, give you the history of my discoveries with      respect to the Widows' Fund, &c., which I presume have proved      rather mysteriously annoying to you. When I first heard the report      of the matter, I called on the librarian and requested information.      He told me that those who did not pass before 1832, had to pay it.      _I_ then said it was due at passing the Civil Law trials, and so,      &c.; and then the man shrugged his shoulders, and allowed I had      convinced him it was only payable by those who did not pass their      _Civil Law_ trials before 1832, and I said no more about the      matter. Dining, however, with Dauney on Tuesday fortnight last, I      heard an observation which led me to a different conclusion, so I      procured the Act as soon as might be, and saw how the matter lay.       \"Presuming I had a whole month before me, I determined to try the      thing, notwithstanding the shaking of heads of those to whom I was      _obliged_ to communicate it.       \"Finding, on inquiry, that there would be no opportunity of being      examined after the 14th, I will allow I was a little startled, but      still stuck fast, and had a sort of feeling I would be able to      pass, as I do not like setting about what I cannot perform.       \"Proceeding in my labours, I gathered confidence, and when the day      came thought it would be rather hard were I rejected. There were      four examined at the same time, and being before myself, I had to      stand their statements of the difficulty and minuteness of the      questions, and they stared not a little when I told them I had      studied the subject for a fortnight and two days; for previous to      that time I had been engaged in the _History_ of Roman Law at      college, and had commenced with the Principles. After the first      question I felt myself secure; yet I will allow I felt a little      easy (_i.e. relieved_) when each of the examiners shook hands with      me, and told me I had given perfect satisfaction.       \"The librarian tells me some"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22136"],["title","The Book-Hunter (#6)"],["body"," rejected in the Civil Law trials,      but _none_ in the Scotch Law, for which I must next year be      prepared. I hope the saving will counter-balance the trouble of      raising the money. I believe I shall enclose you my acknowledgment      for the £200 (the £13 goes to the library, or something of that      sort, which, though rather apocryphal in my nomenclature, shows the      destination of the money). Tell the children[7] if they will write      I will answer them soon, and enclose them something. Pray remember      me to Mr Alcock, and repeat my sense of obligation to him.

This would not be the case, however,      were I to prove fickle, so I must consider my steps taken, and all      thoughts of the Aberdeen law as ended; however, I shall finish my      apprenticeship in summer. Had I time, I should like to go a week or      two to the Continent (Norway or so). J.H.B.\"     CHAPTER III.  BEGINNING OF LITERARY LIFE.  _Particulars regarding passing of Civil Law trial--Letters containing account of first years in Edinburgh and beginning of literary life--First marriage--Wife's death--Publications during married life and widowhood--Political Economy._   If genius is to be defined as the power of taking a great deal of trouble, Dr Burton certainly possessed genius. His most remarkable power was that of mental labour. It did not seem to fatigue or excite him. In his best years his capability for mental work was limited only by the need of food and sleep, and he could reduce these needs to a minimum, and apparently without any future reaction.  He has told the writer that he did not go to bed at all during the fortnight's preparation for his Civil Law trial, described in the last chapter, but worked continuously, day and night, living almost entirely on strong tea and coffee. After his examination was over, he felt no actual fatigue or discomfort. He went to bed at his usual hour, but slept till the night of the second day was falling, a period of wellnigh forty-eight hours. He sustained no injury to health, and became entitled to style himself Advocate.  He never had much practice at the bar; and the need of earning a livelihood first led him to literary publication.  The two letters next offered refer to the following years of his life, when the little family was reunited in Edinburgh. Their mother's absence on a visit to relations in Aberdeen gave occasion for the letters.       \"3 HOWARD PLACE, SOUTH,      _14th July 1833_.       \"MY DEAR MOTHER,--I take the opportunity of Spalding's[8] going to      Aberdeen to write you a few lines. James received the other day two      letters--one from you, and one from Mary.       [Footnote 8: William Spalding, author of a History of English      Literature and other works; a close friend till his too early      death.]       \"The latter mentioned you had sent a letter for me, which has not      yet arrived. I hope to receive it soon, or that you will write me      another, giving a more particular account of your health than the      letters to James have stated.       \"I am at all events glad to hear yourself say you are not worse,      and hope that a little such exertion and variety as you must meet      will tend to strengthen you. We have been going on just as usual;      perhaps I have been a little more idle than usual during the past      week, being the last of the session. I have had one or two friends      in to dine, but did not give them very splendid entertainments.      James is most particular in his care of the cat, and we both prowl      about occasionally looking for gooseberries.       \"I caught a hedgehog the other evening, which has been let loose in      the garden. I have been unable to discover his place of abode, but      we sometimes meet him taking an evening stroll through the walks.      He is an object of great interest to the cat, whose curiosity,      however, he seems decidedly to baffle....       \"I am sorry to hear Robertson is unwell, but I suppose he is able      to write, and he must really be at the trouble of sending me a      letter before I can trouble myself farther about his trunks.       \"I shall be engaged to-morrow and next day in the Justiciary Court,      and shall be otherwise very busy during the rest of the month....       \"By the way, could you ascertain anything about the next Circuit?      You might perhaps send a note to Daniel (Alexander Daniel, Esq.,      advocate, Farquhar's Court, Upperkirkgate), asking him to call on      you and see if he can get me a case or two....       \"With kindest remembrances to grand-aunt and Mrs Brown.--My dear      mother, your affectionate son,       \"JOHN HILL BURTON.\"  The fondness for animals and for gooseberries were lifelong tastes. That for animals did not extend to taking much trouble about them; but Dr Burton had none of a student's nervousness about slight noises or interruptions. He would have thought a house dull without the sounds of birds or other pets in it, and one of his favourite amusements was to watch the ways of animals. He had examples, in his acquaintance among dogs and cats, of heart and conscience in the two species respectively, too trivial for notice here.  Dr Burton has stated in the letters previously quoted some of the studies which he pursued at college in Edinburgh. His contribution to Mrs Gordon's 'Life of Professor Wilson' furnishes a lively picture of college life and experience in Edinburgh. He attended the course of the late Sir William Hamilton, and gained some distinction in the study of moral philosophy and metaphysics, so much that his appointment as assistant and successor to Sir William was seriously considered by himself and others. Had he become Professor of Logic and Metaphysics, he would no doubt have discharged the duties of the situation well. At that time of his life, great versatility, along with extraordinary diligence, was the chief characteristic of his mind. In later years he did not pursue the study of mental science.  Before the period in Dr Burton's life which we have now reached, he had contributed many articles to the 'Aberdeen Magazine,' published by his kind old friend Lewis Smith. These were lately collected and republished by Mr Smith; but, to judge from such specimens as the writer has seen, they are not, on the whole, of a character to increase Dr Burton's present reputation. He seems to have tried his hand at every kind of composition--romance, drama, poetry. In the last mentioned he had most success. His sentimental verses are pretty. His romances are so much crowded with incident as to be almost unintelligible. He was true to his own peculiar taste in novels. If a novel was recommended to him he used to inquire, \"Is there plenty of murder in it?\" He disliked almost equally the philosophical novel, and the domestic or social novel. Of the former he used to say he preferred to read _either_ philosophy or fiction; he could not endure them combined. To hear even a sentence of the best social or domestic novel read irritated him intolerably. He would ask, \"How any one could feel interest in the talk of a set of ordinary silly people, such as one must meet with every day. It was bad enough to hear them talk when one could not help it.\"  Quantities of early works, never printed, are still preserved by his family. The habit of writing--_not_ letter-writing--seems to have begun as soon as he could use a pen, and while his orthography--never a strong point--was excessively weak. \"The Rosted Baron\" remains a popular work in a small circle. It is a tale, crowded, as its title indicates, with blood and flames. The idea may have been taken from the burning of Frendraught. It was written when Dr Burton was quite a boy, and is now one of a heap of manuscripts in a childish hand on very yellow paper remaining in his repositories.       \"3 HOWARD PLACE, SOUTH,      _24th July 1833_.       \"MY DEAR MOTHER,-- ... I was extremely glad to receive your letter      by post this morning, showing me that you are able to go about, and      that you are enjoying yourself as much as possible. James[9] and I      have been getting on very well and very comfortably.       [Footnote 9: Dr Burton's eight years younger brother.]       \"I am obliged to delay our proposed jaunt till Monday next, as I      find it impossible to get my work finished before Friday, the day I      had fixed on. You are aware that I have long delayed an article on      Criminal Trials for the 'Westminster Review.' I have now set about      it seriously, and am resolved not to stir until it is finished,      which I hope may be on Saturday. I have likewise some things to      finish for Chambers before I go, and then I think I shall be able      to enjoy a few days of a stravaig.... I got a slight interruption      last night; just as the twilight came on, Alex. Smith came in. Now      I had been living like a hermit for some time, and though he has      been more than a fortnight returned I had not seen Smith for ten      days. The matter was irresistible. We set to and got very jolly      together. He complained of having low spirits, but they were soon      elevated, and before he went away he was leaping over the chairs,      and very anxious to leap out at the window. I received on Monday      the enclosed letter from Miss H. to you, and wrote by way of answer      that I should send it to Aberdeen intimating my intended visit.
