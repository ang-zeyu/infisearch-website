On our arrival at Fort Warren we were assigned quarters in one of the casemates. Little more than a year had passed away since I had planted a signal staff upon its parapet to _angle_ upon; being then engaged, as chief of a hydrographic surveying party, in surveying the approaches to Boston Harbor. _Then_ its garrison consisted of a superannuated sergeant whose office was a sinecure; _now_ it held an armed garrison, who drilled and paraded every day, with all the \"pomp and circumstance\" of war, to the patriotic tune of \"John Brown's body lies a-moulding in the grave, but his spirit is marching on;\" and it was crowded with southern prisoners of war.  For a few days, in pursuance of Commodore Porter's policy, we were closely confined; but all exceptional restrictions were then removed and we fell into the monotonous routine of prison life. The following correspondence took place previous to the removal of the restrictions, and explains the reason of their withdrawal.                               FORT WARREN, Boston Harbor, May 25, 1862.       Sir,--I was much surprised last evening on being informed by      Colonel Dimmick that Lieutenants Wilkinson, Warly, Ward, Whittle      and Harris, together with myself, have been, by your order, denied      the \"privileges and courtesies that are extended to other      prisoners,\" on the ground that the act of burning the Confederate      States Battery \"Louisiana,\" late under my command, was held by the      United States Navy Department as \"infamous.\" In my letter to the      Department, dated on board of the United States Steamer Rhode      Island, Key West, May 14th, 1862, and forwarded through Commander      Trenchard on the arrival of that vessel in Hampton Roads, together      with a copy of my letter to Flag officer Farragut, and his reply      thereto, I felt assured that all the facts connected with the      destruction of the Louisiana were placed in such a light as not to      be mistaken, nor my motives misconstrued. To render the affair      still more clear I enclose herewith a memorandum of W. C. Whittle      Jr., Confederate States Navy, who was the bearer of my message to      Commodore Porter respecting my fears that the magazine of the      Louisiana had not been effectually drowned. With all these      statements forwarded by me to the United States Navy Department I      am perfectly willing to rest the case with impartial and      unprejudiced minds, as well as with my own Government, satisfied      that nothing has been done by the foregoing officers, nor myself,      militating at all against the strictest rules of military honor and      usage.       Though I will not affect an indifference to the personal annoyance      to us by the action of the United States Navy Department in our      case as prisoners of war, yet my chief solicitude is to have placed      on file in that office such a statement of facts as will, on a fair      investigation, vindicate all the officers of the Confederate States      Navy concerned from the odium of infamous conduct unjustly      attempted to be fixed upon them by those of the United States Navy;      against which and the infliction of punishment as directed by the      Navy Department I enter my solemn protest.       I most emphatically assert that the Louisiana, when abandoned and      fired by my order, was not only not \"turned adrift\" or intended to      injure the United States forces as charged by Commander Porter; but      that she was actually left secured to the opposite bank of the      river and distant quite three-fourths of a mile from the said      forces, for the very reason that they were flying a flag of truce,      and for that reason I dispatched the warning message to Commander      Porter respecting the magazine. That it is not only the right, but      the duty, of an officer to destroy public property to prevent its      falling into the hands of an enemy does not admit of question; and      in addition to all which, it must not be overlooked that the forces      under my command flew no flag of truce, and that I was not in any      way a party to the surrender of Forts Jackson and St. Philip.           I have the honor to be             Very respectfully your obedient servant,               (Signed)                          JNO. K. MITCHELL,                                         _Commander C. S. Navy._       Hon. GIDEON WELLES,        Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.                            _Copy in Substance._                         NAVY DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON, May 29, 1862       SIR,--The explanations of Commodore J. K. Mitchell are      satisfactory, and the restrictions imposed on him and his      associates by the department's order of the 2d instant will be      removed, and they will be treated as prisoners of war.       This does not relieve Beverly Kennon from the restrictions imposed      on him.             (Signed)                             GIDEON WELLES.       Colonel Justin Dimmick,        Commanding Fort Warren, Boston.                                 (_Copy._)                                    NAVY DEPARTMENT, June 25, 1862.       SIR,--The letter of John K. Mitchell of the 20th inst., concerning      the restrictions imposed on you, by order of this Department, at      Fort Warren, has been received.       Will you please furnish the Department with the particulars of the      destruction of the gunboat of which you had command in the      engagement below New Orleans, with _wounded_ men on board.          I am respectfully your obedient servant,            (Signed)                             GIDEON WELLES.      BEVERLY KENNON, Fort Warren, Boston.                       (_Copy_) FORT WARREN, BOSTON, June 28, 1862.       HON. GIDEON WELLES, _Secretary U. S. Navy_.       Sir,--Colonel Dimmick, the commander of this post, delivered to me      yesterday a letter signed by you under date of June 25th directed      to me as \"Beverly Kennon\" and referring to a communication      addressed to you on the 20th inst. by my superior officer,      Commander J. K. Mitchell, of the Confederate States Navy, whom you      are pleased to designate as \"John K. Mitchell.\"       The purport of your letter is a request that I will furnish your      Department of the United States Government with the \"particulars of      the destruction of the gunboat of which I had command in the      engagement below New Orleans with _wounded_ men on board.\"       When I destroyed and left the vessel which I had commanded on the      occasion referred to, all the wounded men had been removed, the      most of them lowered into boats by my own hands. I was, myself, the      last person to leave the vessel. _Any_ statements which you may      have received to the contrary are wholly without foundation. It      would not be proper, under any circumstances, that I should report      to you the \"particulars\" of her destruction; that being a matter      which concerns my own Government exclusively, and with which yours      can have nothing to do. Should any charges be made against me,      however, of which you have a right to take cognizance under the      laws of war, I will with pleasure, respond to any respectful      communication which you may address me on the subject. Indeed I      shall be glad of the opportunity to vindicate my character as an      officer from the unjust and unfounded imputations which have been      cast upon it in the connection to which you allude, and upon the      faith of which I have already been disparaged by unusual      restrictions and confinements, here and elsewhere, since I have      been a prisoner of war, without having been furnished an      opportunity for such vindication. But your letter of the 20th inst.      so studiously denies, both to Commander Mitchell and myself, not      only our official designations, but those of common courtesy, that      while I am unwilling to believe you would intentionally offer an      indignity to prisoners of war in your power, I can not now make      further reply without failing in respect to myself as well as to my      superior officer and Government.         I am Sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,            (Signed)                             BEVERLY KENNON,                            Commander in Provisional Navy of the State                               of Louisiana in the Confederate service.   The restrictions were removed from Kennon in a few days after the close of this correspondence.  Many distinguished political prisoners were at that time confined at Fort Warren; and all of the officers captured at Fort Donelson. Among the former class, were those members of the Maryland Legislature, and of the Baltimore City Council, who had been arrested and imprisoned by the United States Government for alleged treason. It was my good fortune to be invited into this mess. It is not my purpose to inflict upon the reader a detailed account of prison life during the war, which has been described by far abler pens than mine. All the members of our mess took their turns, either at carving or waiting upon the table, and guests were never better served. The graceful and accomplished old Commodore B. and General T. shone conspicuous as carvers; while Colonels, Majors and Captains, with spotless napkins on their arms, anticipated every wish of the guests at the table. Colonel Dimmick was honored and beloved by the prisoners for his humanity, and he and his family will ever be held in affectionate remembrance by them; many of us having received special acts of kindness, while suffering from sickness. When his son was ordered to active service in the field I believe there was an unanimous prayer by the prisoners that his life would be spared through the perils"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21977"],["title","The Narrative of a Blockade-Runner (#8)"],["body","was about to encounter. The prisoners, first giving their parole not to attempt to escape, were allowed the range of nearly the whole island during the day; and not unfrequently suffered to see relatives and friends who had received permission from the proper authorities to visit them. In happier \"ante bellum\" times, I had known some of the good people of Boston, and had spent a portion of a summer with several families at that pleasant watering place, Nahant. One of my most esteemed friends--Mrs. L.--with the charity of a noble and Christian heart, wrote to me as soon as she learned that I was a prisoner; but she was too loyal to the flag not to express regret and distress at what she believed to be a mistaken sense of duty. The reader may remember the definition once given of \"Orthodoxy\" by a dignitary of the church of England to an inquiring nobleman. \"Orthodoxy, my Lord, is _my_ doxy, heterodoxy is _your_ doxy if you differ from me.\" The same authority, it has always appeared to me, was assumed by a large portion of the Northern people. They demanded a Government to suit their ideas, and disloyalty consisted in opposing them.  We were permitted to write once a month to our friends in the Confederacy; the letters being left open for inspection. There were a few Northerners among us, but I know of only a single case where the individual concerned so far yielded to the persuasion of his friends outside, as to renounce the cause which he had sworn to defend.  Aside from the confinement, and the earnest desire to be doing our part in the war, there could be no cause to repine at our lot. We were allowed, at our own expense, to supply our tables from the Boston market, not only abundantly, but luxuriously; the Government furnishing the usual rations; and the prisoners grew robust upon the good fare and the bracing climate. A tug plied daily between Boston and the island on which Fort Warren is situated. We were permitted to receive the daily papers and to purchase clothing and other necessaries, either from the sutler, or from outside; and many of the prisoners were indebted to a noble charity for the means of supplying many of these needs; of clothing especially, which was chiefly furnished by the firm of Noah Walker & Co. of Baltimore. The firm itself was said to be most liberal, not merely dispensing the donations received in Baltimore and elsewhere, but supplying a large amount of clothing gratuitously. The policy of retaliation had not then been adopted. It is conceded that the United States Government, towards the close of the war, subjected the Confederate prisoners in their hands to harsh treatment in pursuance of this policy; but in justice to the Confederate authorities it should be borne in mind that they repeatedly proposed an exchange of prisoners upon the ground of humanity, seeing that neither provisions nor medicine were procurable; and, I believe, it is also a conceded fact that General Grant opposed exchanges. The testimony of General Lee given before the \"reconstruction\" Committee, clearly establishes the fact that _he_ did all in his power to effect this object. In answer to a question he says: \"I offered to General Grant around Richmond that we should ourselves exchange all the prisoners in our hands, and to show that I would do whatever was in my power, I offered them to send to City Point all the prisoners in Virginia and North Carolina, over which my command extended, providing they returned an equal number of mine, man for man. I reported this to the War Department, and received for answer, that they would place at my command all the prisoners at the South, if the proposition was accepted.\" The Rev. J. Wm. Jones, D.D., author of \"Personal Reminiscences of General R. E. Lee,\" writes as follows upon this subject (page 194, et seq.) viz:  \"1st--The Confederate authorities gave to prisoners in their hands the same rations which they issued to their own soldiers, and gave them the very best accommodations which their scant means afforded.  \"2d. They were always anxious to exchange prisoners, man for man, and when this was rejected by the Federal authorities, they offered to send home the prisoners in their hands without any equivalent.  \"3d. By refusing all propositions to exchange prisoners, and declining even to receive their own men without equivalent the Federal authorities made themselves responsible for all the suffering, of both Federal and Confederate prisoners, that ensued.  \"4th. And yet notwithstanding these facts, it is susceptible of proof, from the official records of the Federal Department, that the suffering of Confederate prisoners in Federal prisons was much greater than that of Federal prisoners in Confederate prisons. Without going more fully into the question, the following figures, from the report of Mr. Stanton, Secretary of War, in response to a resolution of the House of Representatives, calling for the number of prisoners on both sides and their mortality, are triumphantly submitted.                           In prison.        Died.       U. S. Soldiers      260,940         22,526      Confederates        200,000         26,500   That is, the Confederate States held as prisoners nearly 61,000 more men than the Federals; and yet the death of Federal prisoners fell below those of the Confederates four thousand.\"  Lastly, the Southern Historical Society, Richmond, Va., has recently published a \"Vindication of the Confederacy against the Charge of Cruelty to Prisoners,\" which is conclusive on the whole question. It was compiled by the Secretary of the Society, the Rev. J. Wm. Jones, just quoted, who concludes with the following summing up of his argument. \"We think that we have established the following points:  \"1st. The laws of the Confederate Congress, the orders of the War Department, the Regulations of the Surgeon General, the action of our Generals in the field, and the orders of those who had the immediate charge of the prisoners, all provided that prisoners in the hands of the Confederates should be kindly treated, supplied with the same rations which our soldiers had, and cared for, when sick, in hospitals placed on _precisely the same footing as the hospitals for Confederate soldiers_.  \"2d. If these regulations were violated in individual instances, and if subordinates were sometimes cruel to prisoners, it was without the knowledge or consent of the Confederate Government, which always took prompt action on any case reported to them.  \"3d. If the prisoners failed to get their full rations, and had those of inferior quality, the Confederate soldiers suffered in precisely the same way and to the same extent; and it resulted from that system of warfare adopted by the Federal authorities, which carried desolation and ruin to every part of the South they could reach, and which in starving the Confederates into submission, brought the same evils upon their own men in Southern prisons.  \"4th. The mortality in Southern prisons (fearfully large, although over three per cent less than the mortality in Northern prisons) resulted from causes beyond the control of our authorities, from epidemics, etc., which might have been avoided or greatly mitigated had not the Federal Government declared medicines \"contraband of war,\" refused the proposition of Judge Ould, that each Government should send its own surgeons with medicines, hospital stores, etc., to minister to soldiers in prison, declined his proposition to send medicines to its own men in southern prisons, without being required to allow the Confederates the same privileges--refused to allow the Confederate Government to buy medicines for gold, tobacco, or cotton, which it offered to pledge its honor should be used only for Federal prisoners in its hands, refused to exchange sick and wounded, and neglected from August to December, 1864, to accede to Judge Ould's proposition to send transportation to Savannah and receive _without equivalent_ from ten to fifteen thousand Federal prisoners, notwithstanding the fact that this offer was accompanied with a statement of the utter inability of the Confederacy to provide for these prisoners, and a detailed report of the monthly mortality at Andersonville, and that Judge Ould, again and again, urged compliance with his humane proposal.  \"5th. We have proven by the most unimpeachable testimony, that the sufferings of Confederate prisoners in Northern \"prison pens,\" were terrible beyond description; that they were starved in a land of plenty, that they were frozen where fuel and clothing were abundant; that they suffered untold horrors for want of medicines, hospital stores and proper medical attention; that they were shot by sentinels, beaten by officers, and subjected to the most cruel punishments upon the slightest pretexts; that friends at the North were refused the privilege of clothing their nakedness or feeding them when starving; and that these outrages were perpetrated not only with the full knowledge of, but under the orders of E. M. Stanton, United States Secretary of War. We have proven these things by Federal as well as Confederate testimony.  \"6th. We have shown that all the suffering of prisoners on both sides could have been avoided by simply carrying out the terms of the cartel, and that for the failure to do this, the _Federal authorities alone_ were responsible; that the Confederate Government originally proposed the cartel, and were always ready to carry it out both in letter and spirit; that the Federal authorities observed its terms only so long as it was to their interest to do so, and then repudiated their plighted faith and proposed other terms which were greatly to the disadvantage of the Confederates; that when the Government at Richmond agreed to accept the hard terms of exchange offered them, these were at once repudiated by the Federal authorities; that when Judge Ould agreed upon a new cartel with General Butler, Lieutenant-General Grant refused"]]]
