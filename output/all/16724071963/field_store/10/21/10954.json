Start Things Moving (#8)"],["body"," sight of the man whom he presumed to be the driver. The fellow was standing staring fixedly ahead.  \"If he had been looking the other way he would have caught us coming down the street,\" flashed through Prescott's mind.  Then he turned, nodding swiftly, silently, at his companions.  They had found Myra, these Grammar School lads, but in a desperate fight, Dexter and the driver would prove overwhelming odds. The pair of rascals could knock these youngsters senseless and whip up the horses for a dash.  What was to be done?  In sheer nervousness Dave Darrin began to try the handle of the cab door. Then, understanding coming to him, Dave tried in earnest to see whether he could unfasten the door with out making the least noise.  All three of the lads realized that it was a ticklish moment. Even Myra, if startled, might give the scream that would betray and defeat them.  Steadily Dave worked at his problem. Dick and Greg, quivering, stood alertly on guard on either side of him.  Squeak! That cab-door handle needed oiling sadly. Even under Darrin's cautious handling it gave forth a noise that sounded startling in the stillness.  \"What's that?\" they heard the driver mutter, as he started. Then came the sound of footsteps, as the driver wheeled and ran around behind the cab.  He was bearing down straight upon them!     CHAPTER VII  DICK LEADS A SPIRITED RUSH   \"Hustle, Dave--into the cab!\" shouted Dick Prescott lustily.  Darrin obeyed like a flash, pulling the door shut.  \"What are you young monkeys doing here?\" yelled the driver hoarsely. Then, as he caught better sight of them, he snarled:  \"Oh, I know you boys! You belong to the Butt-insky family!\"  The driver's next remark was \"ouch!\" as Greg darted in and struck him fairly at the belt line. In the same instant young Prescott managed to trip the fellow.  \"Boss!\" bawled the driver, as he struck the pavement.  \"Into the cab with you, Greg!\" shouted Dick.  Dave swung the door open, and in the same instant Greg bolted inside, while Dick Prescott made a single bound at the front wheel, from which he mounted to the driver's seat.  \"None of that!\" yelled the driver, getting upon his feet and moving forward. At the same moment another man came to the door of the drug store.  That man was--must have been--Abner Dexter. He wore the same clothes that Dick remembered, but over his head and face were drawn a wig and beard that made him look some one else.  Whish! Dick's left hand clutched at the reins, but his right hand grasped the whip. That useful implement described an arc downward and caught the driver roundly, judging by the yell that the fellow let out.  \"Gid-dap!\" yelled young Prescott, completing the swing of the whip by bringing it down across the horses' backs.  The startled animals leaped forward, the lurch almost throwing Dick from the box; in fact, it nearly overturned the cab.  But the vehicle soon righted itself, and Dick, somewhat scared, yet steady, pulled the horses down to a steady trot and reined them in closer together.  The disguised man who had come out of the drug store succeeded in resting one hand for an instant on the body of the cab. But the springing horses carried it away from him. For a few rods the man pursued, the smarting driver bringing up the rear.  Then both pursuers halted, panting, cursing, at the same time, as only foul-mouthed ruffians can.  Inside, Myra was shrieking with fright.  \"We're your mother's friends, Myra, and are taking you back to her,\" explained Dave, holding the small child on his knee and trying to quiet her.  Greg Holmes, in the meantime, was more concerned with looking out of the window.  \"Why, say,\" muttered Greg. \"Dick ain't driving to Mrs. Dexter's, not by a long shot. He seems to be heading straight into the business part of the town.\"  \"You leave Dick Prescott alone to know what he's doing,\" advised Dave Darrin calmly.  \"Yes; I guess that's right,\" assented Greg.  \"Dick is the longest-headed fellow in our school.\"  \"Except me,\" grinned Greg modestly.  \"You? Huh! I'm glad you're not outside on the box.\"  \"I reckon it's the first time Dick ever drove cab horses.\"  \"He'll do it right, anyway.\"  \"But I wonder why he isn't going to the Dexter house,\" pursued young Holmes.  Then Myra took fright again.  \"Take me home!\" she cried. \"I want to see my mamma!\"  From that she passed into wild sobbing, taxing all Dave Darrin's powers to ease her mind.  [Illustration: The Whip Caught the Driver Roundly.]  \"You're going home, Myra,\" he wound up. \"You're going to see your mother.\"  \"My papa is a bad man!\"  \"Well, he's not here now,\" smiled Dave. \"Did you ever hear of Dick Prescott?\"  \"Yes; he's a nice boy.\"  \"You're right he is,\" added Dave with enthusiasm. \"Well, Dick is up outside, driving the horses, and he'll take us home by the way that it's best to go.\"  \"Here we are in Main Street,\" announced Greg wonderingly.  Dave thought he began to understand Prescott's plan, but he said nothing. A few moments later the cab turned down one of the side streets, then halted before a cluster of lights.  \"The police station!\" exploded Greg.  \"Of course,\" nodded Dave.  \"Why 'of course'?\"  \"Because it's part of Dick's plan.\"  \"Come out, fellows,\" called Dick. \"We're at the end of our trip, thank goodness.\"  Greg opened the door, Dave stepping out with Myra in his arms.  \"My mamma doesn't live here,\" cried the child uneasily.  \"No, but it's all right,\" Dave urged soothingly. \"You come right along and see if it isn't.\"  Dick led the way up the police-station steps. In the office three uniformed members of the force were talking excitedly. One of them was the night lieutenant, Janeway.  \"I tell you, Lieutenant, the thing was done so slickly that the child ain't going to be found to-night,\" one of the patrolmen was saying.  \"If you're talking about Myra Dexter, guess again,\" laughed young Prescott. \"Here she is now.\"  Three astounded policemen turned to regard the happy-faced Grammar School boys.  \"Then she wasn't stolen at all?\" demanded one of the patrolmen. \"Just strolled away and got lost, eh?\"  \"Oh, no!\" Dick retorted. \"Myra was stolen, all right; but we stole her back again.\"  \"How?\"  \"We took her away from her father and a cab-driver,\" chuckled Greg Holmes.  \"Stop telling us any nonsense like that,\" interposed the lieutenant sternly. \"Tell us where you found the child.\"  Dick related the story briefly. The policemen were at first inclined to doubt the story, but one of them glanced outside and saw the cab.  \"If you'll let me offer a suggestion,\" went on Dick, \"there's a mother at home who is nearly crazy with grief. Hadn't you better call Mrs. Dexter on the telephone and tell her that Myra is safe with you?\"  The lieutenant quickly wheeled to his 'phone, calling for Mrs. Dexter's number. One of the policemen, in the meantime, received Myra in his arms.  \"Mrs. Dexter?\" called the lieutenant into the transmitter. \"This is the police station. We have your little girl here, all safe and sound. How was she found? Three schoolboys, Dick Prescott, Dave Dar---- Oh, you know the names? Well, they trailed the cab to where it had stopped outside of a drug store. They knocked the driver down and got away with the cab. How did three boys manage to do such a deed? Wait! I'll let Master Prescott himself tell you over the 'phone.\"  The lieutenant wheeled about.  \"Where in the name of mischief are those boys?\" he demanded. The two policemen turned in equal confusion. Certain it was that the Grammar School boys had bolted.  So the lieutenant sent out to find a driver, and one of his policemen got inside with Myra, to take her home. The policeman was also instructed to remain on guard outside through the night, in case Dexter and his confederate should feel inclined to make another attempt to abduct the little one.  Dick and his chums, after leaving the station house silently, had run until they found themselves around the corner on Main Street.  \"We don't want to be thanked any more by Mrs. Dexter to-night,\" Dick ventured to his friends.  \"We certainly don't,\" agreed Dave.  \"What'll we do now?\" asked Greg.  \"We'll go home,\" suggested young Prescott. \"Our folks will be wondering where we are.\"  \"Whee! But we'll have a lot to tell the folks!\" chuckled Greg. \"When my mother hears what we've been through to-night the chances are ten to one that she'll make me stay in nights.\"  \"Not if she pauses to think what you did to help another mother out,\" hinted Dave.  \"Well, good night, fellows,\" called Dick as he reached his corner. \"We've had a bully time, but that won't get us up early in the morning.\"  The bookstore was due to close at nine o'clock, but it was twenty-five minutes after that hour when Dick swung in through the front door.  \"Mother, here's the boy,\" called Mr. Prescott, being the first to espy the returning son. \"Young man, you'll have to give your mother a good account of yourself. She's been worrying about you.\"  \"Oh, I knew Dick was in no great danger,\" laughed Mrs. Prescott, coming forward to kiss her son, now that her worry had ended pleasantly. \"But, Richard, you're still a bit young to stay out so late.\"  \"I suppose, mother, that depends a bit upon what I've been doing, doesn't it?\"  \"Why, has anything happened out of the usual?\"  \"I'll tell you about it,\" agreed the lad.  \"Wait until I put up the shutters and lock the door,\" directed his father. \"Then we'll all go upstairs.\"  Gathered on the floor above, the Prescotts listened in amazement to what their son narrated.  \"Why, I never heard of so much happening before in one day,\" gasped Mrs. Prescott.  \"It never happened to me, before, anyway,\" laughed Dick. \"However, I hope I've brought home a good excuse for being out a little late.\"  \"Dick,\" broke in his father solemnly, \"the next time any such train of events happens you have my permission to be out until--let me see. Well, say, until quarter of ten. But don't let such things happen too often. And now, to bed with you!\"  \"Dick is not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22323"],["title","Impressions of South Africa (#0)"],["body","OF SOUTH AFRICA  BY  JAMES BRYCE  AUTHOR OF \"THE HOLY ROMAN EMPIRE,\" \"TRANSCAUCASIA AND ARARAT,\" \"THE AMERICAN COMMONWEALTH,\" ETC.   _With Three Maps._   THIRD EDITION, REVISED THROUGHOUT  WITH A NEW PREFATORY CHAPTER, AND WITH THE TRANSVAAL CONVENTIONS OF 1881 AND 1884   London MACMILLAN AND CO., Limited 1899  _All rights reserved_   RICHARD CLAY AND SONS, LIMITED, LONDON AND BUNGAY.  _First Edition, 8vo. November 1897_  _Reprinted, November 1897_  _Second Edition, January 1898_  _Third Edition, Crown 8vo. November 1899_  _Reprinted, December 1899_     TO  THE COMPANION OF MY JOURNEY     PREFATORY CHAPTER   This new edition has been carefully revised throughout, and, as far as possible, brought up to date by noting, in their proper places, the chief events of importance that have occurred since the book first appeared. In the historical chapters, however, and in those which deal with recent politics, no changes have been made save such as were needed for the correction of one or two slight errors of fact, and for the mention of new facts, later in date than the first edition. I have left the statements of my own views exactly as they were first written, even where I thought that the form of a statement might be verbally improved, not only because I still adhere to those views, but also because I desire it to be clearly understood that they were formed and expressed before the events of the last few months, and without any reference to the controversies of the moment.  When the first edition of the book was published (at the end of 1897) there was strong reason to believe as well as to hope that a race conflict in South Africa would be avoided, and that the political problems it presents, acute as they had become early in 1896, would be solved in a peaceable way. To this belief and hope I gave expression in the concluding chapter of the book, indicating \"tact, coolness and patience, above all, patience,\" as the qualities needed to attain that result which all friends of the country must unite in desiring.  Now, however, (October 1899), Britain and her South African Colonies and territories find themselves at war with the South African Republic and the Orange Free State. A new chapter is opened in the history of the country which completely alters the situation, and must necessarily leave things very different from what it found them. Readers of this new edition may reasonably expect to find in it some account of the events which have within the last two years led up to this catastrophe, or at any rate some estimate of that conduct of affairs by the three governments concerned which has brought about a result all three ought to have sought to avert.  There are, however, conclusive reasons against attempting to continue down to the outbreak of the war (October 11th) the historical sketch given in Chapters II to XII. The materials for the historian are still scanty and imperfect, leaving him with data scarcely sufficient for judging the intention and motives with which some things were done. Round the acts and words of the representatives of the three governments concerned, there rages such a storm of controversy, that whoever places a particular construction upon those acts and words must need support his construction by citations from documents and arguments based on those citations. To do this would need a space much larger than I can command. The most serious difficulty, however, is that when events are close to us and excite strong feelings, men distrust the impartiality of a historian even when he does his best to be impartial. I shall not, therefore, attempt to write a history of the last two fateful years, but content myself first, with calling the reader's attention to a few salient facts that have occurred since 1896, and to some aspects of the case which have been little considered in England; and secondly, with describing as clearly and estimating as cautiously as I can, the forces that have worked during those years with such swift and deadly effect.  Some of these facts may be dismissed with a word or two, because they lie outside the present crisis. One is the entrance of the Colony of Natal into the South African Customs Union, an event which created one uniform tariff system for the whole of British and Dutch South Africa except the Transvaal. Another is the extension of the two great lines of railway from the coast into the interior. This extension has given Bulawayo and Matabililand a swift and easy communication with Cape Town, thereby strengthening immensely the hold of Britain upon the interior, and lessening any risk that might be feared of future native risings. It has also opened up a new and quick route from the coast of the Indian Ocean at Beira into the heart of Mashonaland, and brought the construction of a railway from Mashonaland across the Zambesi to Lake Tanganyika within the horizon of practicable enterprises. A scheme of government has been settled for the territories of the British South Africa Company south of the Zambesi (Southern Rhodesia), which is now at work. The prospects of gold mining in that region are believed to have improved, and the increase of gold production in the mines of the Witwatersrand has proved even more rapid than was expected in 1896. An agreement has been concluded between Britain and the German Empire relating to their interests on the coast of the Indian Ocean, which, though its terms have not been disclosed, is generally understood to have removed an obstacle which might have been feared to the acquisition by Britain of such rights at Delagoa Bay as she may be able to obtain from Portugal, and to have withdrawn from the South African Republic any hope that State might have cherished of support from Germany in the event of a breach with Britain.  These events, however, great as is their bearing on the future, are of less present moment than those which have sprung from Dr. Jameson's expedition into the Transvaal in December, 1895, and the internal troubles in that State which caused and accompanied his enterprise. It rekindled race feeling all over South Africa, and has had the most disastrous effects upon every part of the country. To understand these effects it is necessary to understand the state of opinion in the British Colonies and in the two Republics before it took place. Let us examine these communities separately.  In Cape Colony and Natal there was before December, 1895, no hostility at all between the British and the Dutch elements. Political parties in Cape Colony were, in a broad sense, British and Dutch, but the distinction was really based not so much on racial differences as on economic interests. The rural element which desired a protective tariff and laws regulating native labour, was mainly Dutch, the commercial element almost wholly British. Mr. Rhodes, the embodiment of British Imperialism, was Prime Minister through the support of the Dutch element and the Africander Bond. Englishmen and Dutchmen were everywhere in the best social relations. The old blood sympathy of the Dutch element for the Transvaal Boers which had been so strongly manifested in 1881, when the latter were struggling for their independence, had been superseded, or at least thrown into the background, by displeasure at the unneighbourly policy of the Transvaal Government in refusing public employment to Cape Dutchmen as well as to Englishmen, and in throwing obstacles in the way of trade in agricultural products. This displeasure culminated when the Transvaal Government, in the summer of 1895, closed the Drifts (fords) on the Vaal River, to the detriment of imports from the Colony and the Orange Free State.  In the Orange Free State there was, as has been pointed out in Chapter XIX., perfect good feeling and cordial co-operation in all public matters between the Dutch and the English elements. There was also perfect friendliness to Britain, the old grievances of the Diamond Fields dispute (see page 144) and of the arrest of the Free State conquest of Basutoland having been virtually forgotten. Towards the Transvaal there was a political sympathy based partly on kinship, partly on a similarity of republican institutions. But there was also some annoyance at the policy which the Transvaal Government, and especially its Hollander advisers, were pursuing; coupled with a desire to see reforms effected in the Transvaal, and the franchise granted to immigrants on more liberal terms.  Of the Transvaal itself I need say the less, because its condition is fully described in Chapter XXV. There was of course much irritation among the Uitlanders of English and Colonial stock, with an arrogant refusal on the part of the ruling section and the more extreme old-fashioned Boers to admit the claims of these new-comers. But there was also a party among the burghers, important more by the character and ability of its members than by its numbers, yet growing in influence, which desired reform, perceived that the existing state of things could not continue, and was ready to join the Uitlanders in agitating for sweeping changes in the Constitution and in administration.  The events of December, 1895, changed the face of things swiftly and decisively in all these communities.  In Cape Colony Dutch feeling, which as a political force was almost expiring, revived at once. The unexpected attack on the Transvaal evolved an outburst of sympathy for it, in which the faults of its government were forgotten. Mr. Rhodes retired from office. The reconstructed Ministry which succeeded fell in 1898, and a new Ministry supported by the Africander Bond came into power after a general election. Its majority was narrow, and was accused of not fairly representing the country, owing to the nature of the electoral areas. A Redistribution Bill was passed by a species of compromise, and in the elections to the new constituencies which followed the Dutch party slightly increased its"]]]
