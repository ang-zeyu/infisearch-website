It seemed that Bruce caught him on the fly. Now the big fellow was fully aroused, and he swung the stranger over his head and gave him a terrific heave.  The man whirled through the air, passed clean over the launch, struck the water beyond and disappeared from view.  At that very moment Frank Merriwell got another crack at Parker Flynn, who had not learned his lesson by his first experience, and again tried to board.  Smack!--the blow sounded, and, with a groan, Flynn dropped down into the launch.  The man who was running the launch seemed satisfied, for he suddenly let go with the boat hook, and the yacht swung away from her foe.  The self-styled sheriff came to the surface and was pulled aboard the launch. The ducking seemed to have taken the spirit out of him. He glared at the yacht, but all his eagerness to board her seemed gone. Parker Flynn sat up and swore, holding onto his aching jaw. He had not realized that there was a set of fighters on board the _White Wings_, although Wat Snell had warned him to that effect. Now he realized that the yacht could not easily be captured in the manner in which he had attempted to accomplish the feat.  The meeting of Flynn and Snell came about in this way. Snell, on finding Frank and his friends were in Boston, had played the spy on the party. He followed them to the pier the morning they went aboard the _White Wings_, and he saw the encounter between Frank and Flynn. When Flynn left the pier, Snell followed and spoke to him. After that it did not take Wat long to work into the good graces of Flynn.  Infuriated by his failure to obtain possession of the yacht, Flynn proceeded to get drunk and stay so. On the second day of his spree, he determined to pursue Merriwell and take the yacht by force, if it could not be obtained in any other manner. Then he hunted up Snell, and it was not hard to induce Wat to accompany him.  Flynn knew the \"poker gang\" in Rockland, and he knew there were a few desperate fellows among those who made up the gang. He had \"dropped his roll\" in Rockland once when he struck the town with an idea in his head that he was \"getting against a lot of jays,\" and on that occasion he became friendly with Peter McSwatt and Hunk Gardman. Gardman did not belong in Rockland, but he came in frequently from an adjoining town to play poker. He was a crook and a sneak, and he showed it in his face. McSwatt was not quite as \"smooth\" as Gardman; he could not \"handle the cards\" as well, but he could sit in a game with Gardman and play what his crooked pal dealt him, so that, after every game, there was usually an ill-gotten pot to be divided. If there was any trouble, McSwatt did the fighting.  Flynn telephoned McSwatt and told him when he would be in Rockland, asking to be met at the boat by McSwatt and a good man who would stand by in a scrap. He ended by saying there was good money in it, and his offered inducements led McSwatt and Gardman to be on hand at the time set.  Flynn was still under the influence of liquor. Had it been otherwise, he would not have fired at the _White Wings_ from the deck of the _City of Bangor_.  On arriving in Rockland, he found his chosen tools waiting for him, and he explained that the yacht _White Wings_ had been stolen from him. To convince McSwatt and Gardman, he showed the bill of sale which he held. He explained that he could not afford the time to recover the boat by regular process of law, and said that it would be an easy thing to take it from the boys who were on board. He showed money and paid his tools something in advance. A few drinks of liquor put them in the mood for almost anything, and then the steam launch was hired to go out in search of the _White Wings_, as Flynn feared the yacht might not come into Rockland at all.  The owner of the launch was convinced that Flynn really owned the yacht, and had a right to take her by force if necessary, but he did not agree to have anything to do with the seizing of the boat further than putting the party alongside.  Snell had warned Flynn that the party on the _White Wings_ was made up of fighters, but the man sneered at them as a lot of boys. It was not believed that there would be any real difficulty in obtaining possession of the yacht, but it was thought best that McSwatt should claim to be an officer.  Thus it came about that the _White Wings_ was met by the steam launch as she headed into Rockland harbor. But the crew on board the launch met with the surprise of their lives, and they were thoroughly disgusted when they were beaten off without much difficulty.  The two cracks Frank had given Flynn knocked some of the conceit and bravado out of him, and for some time after the yacht and the launch swung apart he sat still and swore.  McSwatt was not in a pleasant mood as he wrung the water out of his clothes. He glared at Flynn and snarled:  \"Thought you said they were a lot of boys who could be scared out of their skins! Boys! Why, they are young devils! The fellow I went against is a regular Samson!\"  \"They're in a bad scrape now,\" said Flynn, with an attempt at fierceness. \"They have resisted the rightful owner of that yacht, and they shall smart for it.\"  \"That's all right, but they might have been fooled in a different way. Here they are running right into the harbor, and they will stop there. We might have watched till the most of them went ashore, and then we could have taken her easily.\"  \"How did I know they would run in here? They might have kept on up the bay. And I didn't suppose a lot of beardless chaps could put up such a scrap.\"  \"Well, we have done all you asked of us, and we want our pay.\"  \"Done! You haven't done anything! I hired you to help me take the yacht.\"  \"And misrepresented the case to us. You will pay me, or I'll chuck you overboard!\"  There was a glare in McSwatt's eyes that cowed Flynn.  \"Oh, we mustn't quarrel,\" he quickly said. \"Of course, I will pay you, as I agreed.\"  \"I thought so.\"  \"And I will double the sum if you stand by me a while longer. I tell you I can't fool with those chaps--I can't waste time. I must get possession of my boat at once.\"  \"Well, if you are thinking of attempting to board her again, you'll have to get somebody in my place. I have had enough of that kind of work.\"  Flynn saw that McSwatt meant it.  \"All right,\" he growled. \"We'll stay out and keep watch of her till she drops anchor. I want to be sure they mean to stop here.\"  So the launch cruised about, keeping in sight of the _White Wings_ till the yacht ran slowly into the harbor and let fall her anchor in the vicinity of half a dozen other pleasure yachts laying near together.     CHAPTER VII.  ARRESTED IN ROCKLAND.   There were some indignant lads on board the _White Wings_.  \"A regular case of piracy!\" declared Diamond. \"If we had not been too much for that gang, they would have seized the boat.\"  \"Sure,\" nodded Hodge, whose eyes were gleaming, while his breast, across which his arms were folded, rose and fell with excitement.  \"We handled them too easy,\" grunted Browning. \"It would have served them right if we had split the skull of every man who tried to come over our rail.\"  \"Der pig poom come britty near sblitting der skull uf one,\" grinned Hans. \"You pet dot chap half a swelt head on me.\"  Frank had returned to the wheel. He did not say much, but his cheeks were flushed with excitement and his lips were pressed together.  \"Remember what the truckman told you, Merry?\" questioned Diamond.  \"What was that?\"  \"Why, about this boat being hoodooed.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"It begins to look as if he was right.\"  \"Oh, I don't know.\"  \"Well, if this hasn't been a hoodoo cruise from Boston, I don't know a thing!\"  \"It has been rather eventful,\" admitted Frank, his face relaxing somewhat.  \"Uf you vos lookin' oxcitement for, we haf found him,\" put in Hans.  \"Those chaps are keeping watch of us now,\" said Frank. \"I suppose they think of trying the trick again.\"  \"Don't believe they will,\" said Hodge. \"We'll be in the harbor pretty soon, and they won't dare make another attempt like that.\"  As they ran in the mist lifted and vanished, and they saw the city stretched before them. To the north was the breakwater that protects the harbor, and away in the distance loomed some mountains.  \"What are those hills there?\" asked Diamond.  \"Those are the famous Camden mountains,\" answered Frank. \"The town lies at the foot of those mountains, and Thomas Wentworth Higginson says the scenery in the vicinity of Camden is the most varied and beautiful to be found anywhere in the world.\"  \"Are we going to stop at Camden?\"  \"Well, that is on the program. We'll run up there to-morrow.\"  They anchored near the other yachts and vessels, purposely running into the very midst of them.  \"As long as one of us stays on board, those chaps will not attempt to seize the yacht by force while we remain here,\" said Merriwell.  \"Don't be too sure of that,\" warned Hodge. \"They are desperate characters, and there is no telling what they will try.\"  They watched the launch run into a wharf and saw the party leave her. Not one of the baffled boarders remained in the vicinity, but all quickly disappeared.  \"I believe they are afraid of the consequences now,\" said Merry. \"They are getting out of the way in a hurry.\"  It was not long before the others were of the same opinion. However, Frank was not certain but this movement on the part of the enemy was a ruse to lull their suspicions.  \"Three of us will remain on the yacht,\" he said. \"Jack and I are going ashore.\"  \"How?\" asked Diamond. \"We have no boat, and we are anchored off here in the bay.\"  \"I am going to buy a boat here. I think we can get one of the boats from some of these vessels"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22265"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Cruise (#7)"],["body"," set us ashore.\"  The nearest vessel was hailed, and it did not take long to get a sailor with a boat to come over to the yacht and take Frank and Jack off. He rowed them to the steamboat wharf, and would not take a cent for doing so.  \"All right, mates,\" he said, in a hearty way. \"I'll want a turn sometime, perhaps.\" Then, after telling them that, if they did not get a boat, they could whistle him up and he would bring them off to their yacht, he rowed away.  There were a number of truck teams about the wharf, loading with the freight left there that morning by the steamer. Frank inquired of one of the truckmen where to find a man who would sell them a first-class rowboat, and the truckman directed him to a man who had boats to let and to sell.  This man the boys sought without delay, but he was not at his shop. They were told that he had gone uptown, and so they walked up Sea Street into the heart of the city.  As they came out on Main Street, Diamond halted with an exclamation of astonishment.  \"Great Scott!\" burst from his lips. \"Is this real?\"  \"Is what real?\" asked Frank.  \"Do I really see a trolley car running along the street here, or am I dreaming?\"  \"Oh, come along!\" laughed Frank. \"They have trolley cars down in this country, and I don't think it looks quite as wild and uncivilized as you expected.\"  They entered the Thorndike Hotel together, and, just as they passed through the door, Frank suddenly clutched his friend's arm, giving a gasp of astonishment himself.  Jack saw Merry was staring toward the flight of stairs. He looked up, and there on the stairs, descending toward them, were two girls, Inza Burrage and Paula Benjamin!  Merriwell recovered his composure immediately and stepped forward to meet the girls at the foot of the stairs, accompanied by Diamond. The boys lifted their hats, and Frank said:  \"Another unexpected pleasure! We didn't dream of this. Supposed you were in Bar Harbor.\"  The girls shook hands with them, and both seemed to show confusion.  \"It is a pleasure,\" declared Inza. \"We are stopping here in Rockland a few days.\"  Frank longed to ask questions, but he knew it would be an act of rudeness, and he refrained. However, Paula seemed to think that Inza's explanation was not sufficient, and she added:  \"Yes, we decided to stop off here a day, and we are so interested with the city and the surrounding country that we will remain a little longer.\"  \"That will be pleasant,\" said Frank. \"We've just got in, and are rather salty now, but we mean to brace up and get some of the brine out of us. Perhaps we may have the pleasure of seeing you often while we remain here.\"  \"I hope we may,\" put in Jack, quickly, looking earnestly at Paula, who let her eyes droop before his gaze.  \"I am sure it will be agreeable to us,\" smiled Inza. \"Tell us something about your voyage. Did you have a nice time?\"  \"Nice isn't any name for it,\" laughed Frank.  \"That's right,\" nodded Jack; \"it isn't.\"  \"We have encountered excitements galore.\"  \"Such as fogs and storms and steamboats and pirates.\"  \"Mercy! Pirates!\"  \"Well, they attempted to board us and seize the yacht.\"  \"What did you do?\"  \"We gave them a jolly good welcome.\"  A uniformed policeman entered the hotel and stepped up to the boys.  \"Which one of you is Frank Merriwell?\" he asked.  \"I am, sir,\" said Frank.  \"Then,\" said the officer, \"I shall have to take you.\"  \"Take me?\" cried Frank. \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean that you are under arrest.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  A STIR IN LIMEROCK CITY.   Both girls uttered a little cry of amazement and alarm, and Paula shrank close to Inza, clasping her about the waist.  \"Under arrest?\" repeated Frank, slowly. \"For what?\"  \"Stealing a yacht and resisting the real owner when he attempted to regain possession of it.\"  Merry laughed heartily.  \"This is a joke!\" he exclaimed.  The officer seemed puzzled, but he frowned at Frank, saying:  \"You are not likely to find it a joke, young man. It is a serious offense, and, if you have not some rich folks who will settle handsomely for your little lark, you will go to jail.\"  \"My dear sir,\" said Merriwell, with perfect coolness, \"you are taking too much for granted. You are standing on the ground that the charge against me is true. It will be the easiest thing in the world to prove that it is not.\"  \"You will have to prove that to the judge,\" said the officer, with his hand on Frank's shoulder. \"Just now you'll have to accompany me. If you resist or make any trouble, it will be worse for you.\"  He produced handcuffs.  \"What do you mean to do?\" hoarsely demanded Diamond, his eyes bulging. \"You're not going to handcuff him?\"  \"It is necessary. I am not taking any chances. A chap who will steal a yacht is liable to be pretty desperate.\"  \"I will go along with you quietly,\" said Frank, paling a bit at the thought of being led shackled through the streets. \"I give you my word on that.\"  \"It's an outrage!\" cried Diamond.  \"I advise you to keep still,\" said the officer, sternly. \"You may be arrested as an accomplice.\"  \"I don't care if I am!\" came fiercely from Jack's lips. \"I say it is an outrage, and I will stand by it. Mr. Merriwell purchased the yacht and paid his money for it, as he can prove. He is the rightful owner of the boat.\"  \"I am not going to discuss that.\"  The officer was about to put the irons on Frank, when Jack cut in with:  \"Have a little decency about this, Mr. Officer. If you believe this young man such a desperate fellow, call an assistant. Surely two of you ought to be able to take him to the lockup without handcuffing him.\"  The policeman was angry, and Frank saw that what Jack was saying was not making things any better, so he asked his friend to be quiet. Then he said something in a low tone to the officer. The latter hesitated.  \"Put yourself in my place,\" said Frank. \"You are not sure this charge is true. Think how you would feel to be dragged along the street with irons on your wrists when you had not been guilty of committing a crime.\"  \"And he tells you the truth, sir, when he says he bought the yacht,\" broke in Inza, fearlessly. \"I know it! He purchased it of my friend's brother.\"  \"That is true,\" spoke up Paula, with sudden braveness. \"My brother sold him the yacht. He never stole it! Why, he is Frank Merriwell, of Yale, and everybody knows Frank Merriwell would not steal anything.\"  She was startled by her own boldness, but her words brought about a good result.  Of course, the arrest of Frank had attracted the attention of all who were in the office of the hotel, among whom were several commercial men. One of the latter stepped forward quickly.  \"Frank Merriwell, of Yale?\" he exclaimed. \"Is this the famous Yale pitcher? By Jove, it is! I have seen him pitch several games, but I didn't know him in this yachting suit. Mr. Merriwell, I am glad to see you, but sorry you are in trouble. However, if I can aid you in any way, you may count on me.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Frank. \"It's pleasant to know I am not quite unknown and friendless down here.\"  \"Unknown!\" exclaimed another man. \"If you are Frank Merriwell, we all know about you. We have read about you in the papers. You are the best known college man in this country. Officer, I don't believe this young gentleman is either a thief or a desperado. If he says he will go along with you, I'll vouch for him.\"  \"If you say so, Mr. Franch----\"  \"I do. I will be responsible for him.\"  The officer put his handcuffs out of sight.  \"All right,\" he said. \"Come along, young man.\"  By this time the report had gone abroad that there had been an arrest in the Thorndike, and a crowd was gathering outside the door. In the crowd were a number of excited small boys, for they had heard that the person arrested was the famous Yale football and baseball player, Frank Merriwell.  One of the boys in the crowd saw a friend on the opposite side of the street, and yelled:  \"Hey, Charley, get a wiggle on an' come over here! W'at yer t'ink! Ther cop has nabbed that feller we've been readin' about--Frank Merriwell!\"  \"Aw! w'at yer givin' us!\" flung back the other.  \"This ain't no fust of April!\"  \"It's dead straight, Charley! Frank Merriwell is right here in ther Thorndike, an' Old Briggs has pinched him. Don't yer want ter see him?\"  \"Don't I?\" gasped the one across the street, as he bolted from the sidewalk. \"I'd rudder see Frank Merriwell than have a season ticket to der ball games!\"  And he could not get over quick enough.  By the time the officer was ready to bring Frank out of the hotel, all the men and boys outside knew who had been arrested, and the excitement was great. The crowd grew swiftly, and everybody was eager to get a look at the Yale athlete of whom they had heard such wonderful stories.  The young men of the town were no less excited than the boys. There was scarcely one of them who did not know something about Frank Merriwell and his record, and, even before they could find out why he had been arrested, they denounced the arrest as an outrage.  Another policeman came along and attempted to clear the sidewalk in front of the hotel, but the crowd did not want to disperse.  The officer who had arrested Frank came out with Merriwell at his side, a hand on his arm.  \"There he is!\" was the cry that went up. \"That is Frank Merriwell!\"  Jack Diamond, who walked beside Frank, was amazed at the crowd and to hear them call Frank's name.  \"They know you, Merriwell,\" he said.  \"It seems so,\" said Frank, with a faint smile.  \"It's a shame!\" cried one of the young men. \"What's he arrested for?\"  \"Don't know,\" admitted another; \"but I'll bet my clothes he is all right! Frank Merriwell is on the level!\"  \"That's so!\" shouted twenty voices.  The crowd followed the officer and his prisoner. Somebody proposed a cheer for Frank Merriwell, and it seemed that every human being in that following crowd cheered as loudly as he could.  Then somebody proposed three groans for Old Briggs, the officer, and the crowd groaned in a most"]]]
