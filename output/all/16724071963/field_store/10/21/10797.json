Weather Men (#8)"],["body","done, Mr. Levin?\"  \"There's only one thing to do,\" the Weather Man answered, \"and that's to build up the levee system, year after year, steadily and without pause, making allowances for the tributaries flowing into the Mississippi and paying especial heed to the rainfall that may be expected in the basin. Wherever possible, forestry must be undertaken to keep the slopes from erosion. Reservoirs might be built with great profit, from which water could be let down during the low water periods.  \"When the river channels are accurately adjusted to the amount of rainfall in the river basin, destructive floods will be averted. We can never expect that the Mississippi will be absolutely put in harness. The basin is too huge, the amount of water that has to be carried down is too great. Permanent dredging and permanent levee construction and repair will always be necessary, and a close co-ordination between the Weather Bureau and the government and state engineers is a first need in the problem.\"  \"Just how does the Weather Bureau come in,\" asked Ross, \"the rainfall?\"  \"It isn't only the rainfall of the few days in advance,\" the Forecaster answered, \"it's the rain that has fallen before and the rain that's going to fall. If there should be twelve inches of rainfall after a long drought throughout the Mississippi basin, it would make comparatively little difference, for all the rain that fell on the dry ground would be sucked up by it and only a very little would flow into the rivers and streams that feed the Mississippi.  \"On the other hand, if there had been slight but frequent rains for weeks and weeks, those twelve inches of water would make an entirely different story. No one, except the Weather Bureau, would have kept track of the amount of rain that had fallen.  \"If the ground has been steadily soaked, even by light occasional showers, twelve inches more of rain cannot soak in. Therefore, the entire amount of rain will flow directly into the stream channels and thus into the Mississippi. Flood warnings will be sent out, the height of the flood crest can be estimated, the length of the period of the danger will be known in advance and the proper preparations can be made. If further rain is threatened, that information can be sent out, also, and the entire Mississippi valley is completely prepared. That's the true preparedness, my boy, being ready for the foe that you know will come. Stupidity or cowardice are the only causes for not being willing and ready to help in time of danger.\"  \"What can a chap do?\" asked Ross, aflame with eagerness.  The Forecaster looked at him thoughtfully, but before he answered, Anton piped in, with a plaintive note in his voice:  \"Is there anything that I could do?\"  In spite of himself, the Forecaster's glance fell on the crutch. Anton's intent gaze followed the look and he flushed. A sudden silence fell, the silence of an abiding tragedy from which all eyes are always turned, the tragedy of the disabled.  \"Yes,\" he said with grave quietness, \"there's a great deal that you can do.\"  The crippled lad regarded him steadily.  The steady rushing of the Mississippi in flood could be heard near by with its thousand miles of menace.  \"We need work,\" the weather expert said, at last, \"work with the heart behind it. Even now, the United States Weather Bureau has over four thousand co-operative observers, who work without pay, who work with their hearts behind their duties. Still, this is all too few.\"  Anton's gaze never wavered, but a question crept into his eyes.  \"Yes,\" answered the Forecaster, \"you can be one. I know your father well, and I'm sure that he will be guaranty for the instruments. The work of making and recording observations will be yours. Never late, never forgetting, never swerving from your duty, your post at the rain-gauge and the barometer will be as honorable and responsible a post as the soldier's at sentry-post or behind the gun.\"  The lad's eyes glowed more deeply.  \"Storms, frosts, and droughts will be your enemies,\" the Forecaster continued, \"and they never sleep and never give quarter. The lighthouse-keeper who lets his light go out and permits a ship to go unwarned to wreck upon the rocks is not more guilty than the Weather Observer who allows disaster to sweep, unwarned, upon his district. It is a trust, Anton. Can you and will you take it?\"  The sun broke through the clouds, lighting up the yellow wood of the crutch and turning it into gold. It caught the boy's eye, but with a new significance. No longer would it stand between him and his future. There was something he could do for his country, as well as though he were the strongest and best-built lad in all the neighborhood. Life, with its promises of work, opened before him.  \"I'll take the trust,\" he answered simply.     CHAPTER III  PUTTING THE SUN TO WORK   \"Fo' the land's sake, Mistah Anton, what fo' yo' puttin' up that pole on the grass?\"  \"So that I can find the sun, Dan'l,\" the crippled lad answered cheerily, as he held upright the pole, while Ross began to fill in the deep hole that the two boys had spent the morning in making.  \"Yo' don't need no pole to find the sun,\" the old darky answered; \"why, yonder's the sun, right up over yo' head.\"  \"Is it right over my head, Dan'l?\" the boy asked.  The negro, an old family servant, put his hand above his eyes and squinted at the sky.  \"Not right over,\" he corrected himself, \"but mighty near it.\"  \"How near?\"  Dan'l looked at the boy with a puzzled air.  \"Ah don't jest know how near,\" he answered.  \"That's the idea, exactly,\" Anton rejoined, \"I want to know how near.\"  \"Is this hyar another of your contraptions to tell what the weather's goin' to be like the year after next?\" the plantation hand queried, taking advantage of his position as an old family appanage. The instruments had been a point of discussion all summer, for Dan'l prided himself on being a weather prophet, though he based most of his predictions on the behavior of the animals and birds around the farm.  \"This is to tell time, not weather, Dan'l,\" Anton answered, \"but we'll use it for weather, too.\"  The darky shook his head.  \"Ah don't hold with none o' them glass things with silver runnin' up an' down in their insides, what you calls 'fermometers,\" he declared, \"they're not nateral. Ah believe in signs. When, in the evenin', a rooster crows like he's done goin' to bust, ah knows sho' it's goin' to rain befo' mornin'.\"  He ambled up to Ross, who was busily shovelling in the earth.  \"Hyar, Mist' Ross,\" he said, \"let me do that for yo'. Yo' ought to ask old Dan'l when yo' got a job like that.\"  \"That's all right,\" the older boy answered, readily yielding up the spade, however, and wiping the perspiration from his brow, \"it is pretty hot, though.\"  \"Yo' got no call to be workin' right near noon,\" the negro protested, \"that's not fo' white folks. Fust thing yo' know, yo'll be havin' a sunstroke.\"  He shoveled vigorously as he talked, tamping the earth down hard.  \"It's sho' goin' to be a hot summer,\" he said, \"yo' only find the field-mouse nests where the shadder's thickest. Thar,\" he continued, patting down the earth level with his spade, \"that's done now. Yas, suh, it's hot.\"  He wiped the perspiration from his forehead with the back of his hand.  \"You bet the sun's hot,\" the boy agreed, \"but Mr. Levin told me the other day that we only get a two-billionth part of the heat put out by the sun. Did you know that, Ross? The sun has heat enough to warm two billion Earths as big as this one. Even at that, Dan'l, the amount of heat we get from the sun would make thirty-seven billion tons of freezing water boil in one minute.\"  The negro's jaw dropped.  \"Yo' not fooling?\" he said.  \"Not a bit.\"  \"Ah's hot,\" he said. \"Ah's goin' to boil, soon.\"  \"Cheer up, Dan'l. You'll cool off tonight,\" suggested the older lad. \"Nearly everything that takes in heat has to give it out again. The earth, the sea and the dust in the air, all gradually let out some of the heat during the night. If it wasn't for that, everything would stay at the same temperature all night long. That's why it's always colder an hour before dawn than an hour after sunset.  \"See, Dan'l, the earth and the air which take in heat easily and give off heat easily, by the end of the night, have got rid of a lot of their heat. At sea, though, where the water lets go its heat less easily, it is never as cold as on land. The thermometer shows when it's hot and when it's cold.\"  \"Ah don't hold with none o' them fermometers,\" the old darky repeated.  \"That's because you don't understand them,\" the crippled lad replied. \"It's dead easy, though. You see, Dan'l, when a thing is hot it gets bigger and when it's cold it gets smaller, that is, most things do.\"  \"Ah don't see that, nohow,\" the negro answered. \"A red hot stove is just 'zackly the same size as when the fire's out.\"  \"No, it isn't, as a matter of fact,\" the lad replied, \"but you can't always see the difference. Iron does get bigger as it gets hot. You've seen the steel rails on railroad tracks, haven't you, Dan'l.\"  \"Sho'.\"  \"Did you ever notice that there's a little crack between each rail? In winter, the crack is quite wide.\"  The negro thought for a moment.  \"Is that the crack that makes a train bump?\"  \"Yes, that's it. Now, Dan'l, on a hot day in summer, you can't see any crack there at all, the rail has expanded or got bigger, and filled it up. On a frosty day in winter, there's a big crack, so big that you could drop a lead pencil between the ends of the rails. That's the difference of expansion on a steel rail between winter and summer.\"  \"That's powehful little!\"  \"It's quite a good deal. I'll show you. Suppose, Dan'l, you had a small rubber ball filled with ink and there was a pipe out of the ball sticking straight up in the air, and suppose you put that little rubber ball in the crack between the rails.\"  \"Yes?\"  \"Then, on a cold day, the rubber ball would have room enough.

CHARLIER  SCIENTIA PUBLISHER LUND 1921   HAMBURG 1921 PRINTED BY _LÜTCKE & WULFF_     CHAPTER I.  APPARENT ATTRIBUTES OF THE STARS.   1. Our knowledge of the stars is based on their _apparent_ attributes, obtained from the astronomical observations. The object of astronomy is to deduce herefrom the real or _absolute_ attributes of the stars, which are their position in space, their movement, and their physical nature.  The apparent attributes of the stars are studied by the aid of their _radiation_. The characteristics of this radiation may be described in different ways, according as the nature of the light is defined. (Undulatory theory, Emission theory.)  From the statistical point of view it will be convenient to consider the radiation as consisting of an emanation of small particles from the radiating body (the star). These particles are characterized by certain attributes, which may differ in degree from one particle to another. These attributes may be, for instance, the diameter and form of the particles, their mode of rotation, &c. By these attributes the optical and electrical properties of the radiation are to be explained. I shall not here attempt any such explanation, but shall confine myself to the property which the particles have of possessing a different mode of deviating from the rectilinear path as they pass from one medium to another. This deviation depends in some way on one or more attributes of the particles. Let us suppose that it depends on a single attribute, which, with a terminology derived from the undulatory theory of HUYGHENS, may be called the _wave-length_ (λ) of the particle.  The statistical characteristics of the radiation are then in the first place:--  (1) the total number of particles or the _intensity_ of the radiation;  (2) the _mean wave-length_ (λ_0) of the radiation, also called (or nearly identical with) the _effective_ wave-length or the colour;  (3) _the dispersion of the wave-length_. This characteristic of the radiation may be determined from the _spectrum_, which also gives the variation of the radiation with λ, and hence may also determine the mean wave-length of the radiation.  Moreover we may find from the radiation of a star its apparent place on the sky.  The intensity, the mean wave-length, and the dispersion of the wave-length are in a simple manner connected with the _temperature_ (_T_) of the star. According to the radiation laws of STEPHAN and WIEN we find, indeed (compare L. M. 41[1]) that the intensity is proportional to the fourth power of _T_, whereas the mean wave-length and the dispersion of the wave-length are both inversely proportional to _T_. It follows that with increasing temperature the mean wave-length diminishes--the colour changing into violet--and simultaneously the dispersion of the wave-length and also even the total length of the spectrum are reduced (decrease).   2. _The apparent position of a star_ is generally denoted by its right ascension (α) and its declination (δ). Taking into account the apparent distribution of the stars in space, it is, however, more practical to characterize the position of a star by its galactic longitude (_l_) and its galactic latitude (_b_). Before defining these coordinates, which will be generally used in the following pages, it should be pointed out that we shall also generally give the coordinates α and δ of the stars in a particular manner. We shall therefore use an abridged notation, so that if for instance α = 17h 44m.7 and δ = +35°.84, we shall write      (αδ) = (174435).  If δ is negative, for instance δ = -35°.84, we write      (αδ) = (1744{35}),  so that the last two figures are in italics.  [Transcriber's Note: In this version of the text, the last two figures are enclosed in braces to represent the italics.]  This notation has been introduced by PICKERING for variable stars and is used by him everywhere in the Annals of the Harvard Observatory, but it is also well suited to all stars. This notation gives, simultaneously, the characteristic _numero_ of the stars. It is true that two or more stars may in this manner obtain the same characteristic _numero_. They are, however, easily distinguishable from each other through other attributes.  The _galactic_ coordinates _l_ and _b_ are referred to the Milky Way (the Galaxy) as plane of reference. The pole of the Milky Way has according to HOUZEAU and GOULD the position (αδ) = (124527). From the distribution of the stars of the spectral type B I have in L. M. II, 14[2] found a somewhat different position. But having ascertained later that the real position of the galactic plane requires a greater number of stars for an accurate determination of its value, I have preferred to employ the position used by PICKERING in the Harvard catalogues, namely (αδ) = (124028), or      α = 12h 40m = 190°, δ = +28°,  which position is now exclusively used in the stellar statistical investigations at the Observatory of Lund and is also used in these lectures.  The galactic longitude (_l_) is reckoned from the ascending node of the Milky Way on the equator, which is situated in the constellation _Aquila_. The galactic latitude (_b_) gives the angular distance of the star from the Galaxy. On plate I, at the end of these lectures, will be found a fairly detailed diagram from which the conversion of α and δ of a star into _l_ and _b_ may be easily performed. All stars having an apparent magnitude brighter than 4m are directly drawn.  Instead of giving the galactic longitude and latitude of a star we may content ourselves with giving the galactic _square_ in which the star is situated. For this purpose we assume the sky to be divided into 48 squares, all having the same surface. Two of these squares lie at the northern pole of the Galaxy and are designated GA_1 and GA_2. Twelve lie north of the galactic plane, between 0° and 30° galactic latitude, and are designated GC_1, GC_2, ..., GC_12. The corresponding squares south of the galactic equator (the plane of the Galaxy) are called GD_1, GD_2, ..., GD_12. The two polar squares at the south pole are called GF_1 and GF_2. Finally we have 10 B-squares, between the A- and C-squares and 10 corresponding E-squares in the southern hemisphere.  The distribution of the squares in the heavens is here graphically represented in the projection of FLAMSTEED, which has the advantage of giving areas proportional to the corresponding spherical areas, an arrangement necessary, or at least highly desirable, for all stellar statistical researches. It has also the advantage of affording a continuous representation of the whole sky.  The correspondence between squares and stellar constellations is seen from plate II. Arranging the constellations according to their galactic longitude we find north of the galactic equator (in the C-squares) the constellations:--      Hercules, Cygnus, Cepheus, Cassiopæa, Auriga, Gemini, Canis Minor,     Pyxis, Vela, Centaurus, Scorpius, Ophiuchus,  and south of this equator (in the D-squares):--      Aquila, Cygnus, Lacerta, Andromeda, Perseus, Orion, Canis Major,     Puppis, Carina, Circinus, Corona australis, Sagittarius,  mentioning only one constellation for each square.  At the north galactic pole (in the two A-squares) we have:--      Canes Venatici and Coma Berenices,  and at the south galactic pole (in the two F-squares):--      Cetus and Sculptor.   3. _Changes in the position of a star._ From the positions of a star on two or more occasions we obtain its apparent motion, also called the _proper motion_ of the star. We may distinguish between a _secular_ part of this motion and a _periodical_ part. In both cases the motion may be either a reflex of the motion of the observer, and is then called _parallactic_ motion, or it may be caused by a real motion of the star. From the parallactic motion of the star it is possible to deduce its distance from the sun, or its parallax. The periodic parallactic proper motion is caused by the motion of the earth around the sun, and gives the _annual parallax_ (π). In order to obtain available annual parallaxes of a star it is usually necessary for the star to be nearer to us than 5 siriometers, corresponding to a parallax greater than 0″.04. More seldom we may in this manner obtain trustworthy values for a distance amounting to 10 siriometers (π = 0″.02), or even still greater values. For such large distances the _secular_ parallax, which is caused by the progressive motion of the sun in space, may give better results, especially if the mean distance of a group of stars is simultaneously determined. Such a value of the secular parallax is also called, by KAPTEYN, the _systematic_ parallax of the stars.  When we speak of the proper motion of a star, without further specification, we mean always the secular proper motion.   4. Terrestrial distances are now, at least in scientific researches, universally expressed in kilometres. A kilometre is, however, an inappropriate unit for celestial distances. When dealing with distances in our planetary system, the astronomers, since the time of NEWTON, have always used the mean distance of "]]]
