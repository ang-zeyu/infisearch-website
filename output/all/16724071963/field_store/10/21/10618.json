Trinity to Advent (#2)"],["body","father desire his dear little one to be taken into the arms of Christ and blessed, still His answer is--\"Lo, I come.\"  Does any man need direction, guidance, help in the way of life?  He says, \"Lo, I come; I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.\"  Does any desire sustaining food by the way?  He says--\"Lo, I come, and the Bread I give is My flesh, which I give for the life of the world.\"  Is any burdened with the weight of sin, and desires pardon and reconciliation, He says--\"Lo, I come, though thy sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as wool.\"  Is any in sorrow, and heart sore?  He says, \"Lo, I come to bind up the broken-hearted.\"  Is any dying?--He is still ready with His answer, \"Lo, I come, when thou goest through the waters I am with thee.\"  You see how striking is the readiness of Our Blessed Lord.  Now look at to-day's Gospel, and see how this is met by man.  Christ is represented as having made a great supper, the Holy Eucharist, and to that he invites all Christians, and He sends forth His messengers to bid them come, then they all with one consent begin to make excuse.  The messengers go to the man who has bought oxen, and invite him to the supper of his lord, and his answer is, \"I pray thee, have me excused.\" They go to a man who has bought a farm, and his answer is, \"I pray thee, have me excused.\"  They go to a man who has married a wife, and his answer is, \"I cannot come.\"  \"Lo, I come!\" says Christ.  \"I cannot come,\" says man.  \"Lo, I come to man,\" says Christ.  \"I cannot come to Christ,\" says man.  I.  It was the rule among the early Christians to communicate every Lord's Day.  The rule of the Church, as laid down in the service-books, then ordered that all those who were open and scandalous livers, all those who had committed some deadly sin, and had not been reconciled to God, should leave church before the Consecration, after the reading of the Gospel.  Now suppose some good old bishop of that day were to rise from the dead, and come into this church, what would he see?--Directly the sermon is over,--a rush of almost all in the church, men, women, and children, running out of the door, and only three or four, or at most a dozen, remaining to partake of the Lord's Body.  That is what he would see.  Now, what would he say?--He would lift up his hands in horror, and say, \"What is this?  All these notorious sinners!  All these open profligates!  All these burdened with mortal sin, cutting them off from the grace of God!  Take me back to my grave, I do not want to see any more of such horrible days.\"  But if I happened to be present, I would say to him.  \"You are jumping to conclusions too rashly.  Times are altered.  It is not the criminals and profligates who go out of church before the Consecration of the Blessed Sacrament, and are unworthy to eat of the Lord's Body, it is those who cannot make up their minds to do exactly what the Lord commanded; it is those who are half-hearted, who wish to serve God, but do not want to serve Him very much.\"  Then, I doubt not, the old bishop would turn upon me with a wrathful face, and say, \"Let me go back to my grave!  This is worse!  A thousand times worse!  The whole Christian world has grown cold of heart, and dead of faith, if all with one consent begin to make excuse, and say, 'I cannot come.'  I had rather they were either hot or cold, but because they are neither hot nor cold--away!  I cannot bear to look at their faces!  Let me go back to my grave.\"  III.  I know what is passing in your minds as well as if you had got glass skulls.  And this is what I see that not a few of you are thinking.  \"Ha! there is the Parson at it again! always hammering away at Communion.  Can he not leave us alone?  Let him talk to us of other matters; let him preach to us some real stinging gospel truth, and make us wince.  Anything but this eternal preaching about coming to Communion.\"  Now I will tell you why I preach about this, and hammer, hammer, at it.  Because it is good stinging gospel truth, and the grumbling that is going on is because your consciences really are wincing at what I say.  Listen:--other folks talked like you in olden times.  When the children of Israel came out of Egypt, God in mercy sent them Bread from Heaven, the manna, to feed them on their way through the wilderness.  What said the people in return for the blessing?  Were they very grateful?  Were they very eager to gather up the Angels' food?  By no means, they sat grumbling in their tents and said, \"Our soul is dried away; there is nothing beside this manna before our eyes.\"  Put into modern language that is, \"Our souls have dried up for want of preaching of free justification, and no good at all in keeping the law; we don't want any of your Sacramental teaching, no Communion for us, we can do very well without that, our soul abhorreth this light food, as for this Holy Communion, there is nothing but that preached to us, year in, year out.\"  Well!  If this Sacramental teaching be not God's own blessed Gospel, there is no meaning in words.  Listen to this!  I never said anything so strong, and this is what Christ Himself spake:--\"I am the Bread of Life.  Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.  I am the living bread which came down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is My flesh, which I give for the life of the world.\"  \"Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, ye have no life in you.  Whoso eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.  For My flesh is meat indeed, and My blood is drink indeed.\"  Now--mark you.  When Jesus said this, many of His disciples said, \"This is a hard saying\"--and, from that time they went back, and walked no more with Him.  It is so still, it will be so always.  Just as many of the old Israelites loathed the manna and said, \"Our souls are dried away; there is nothing but this manna before our eyes,\" so there always will be faithless disciples who when they hear the invitation to partake of the Body of Christ, the true Manna, will say, \"This is a hard saying,\" and will thenceforth no more walk with Him.     XL.  _RECEIVING AND REJECTING._  3rd Sunday after Trinity.  S. Luke, xv. 2.  \"This Man receiveth sinners.\"   INTRODUCTION.--In to-day's Gospel our Lord represents Himself as a Good Shepherd seeking His lost sheep, going out into the wilderness after them, to bring them back into the fold.  The fold is that place where He keeps His flock shut behind the hurdles of the Ten Commandments.  Every now and then a sheep leaps one of these hurdles, or pushes his way between them, and runs away into forbidden pastures.  Then the Good Shepherd goes after the erring sheep, and brings it back.  \"And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.\"  SUBJECT.--Christ is not always to be regarded as the Saviour receiving sinners.  The time will come when He will be the Judge, rejecting them. He is a shepherd now, bringing back the straying sheep, and replacing them in the fold, but one day He will do just the contrary, He will go to His fold, and pick out the incorrigibly bad sheep, and cast them out.  I.  We will consider Him now as the Good Shepherd.  What is His purpose in bringing back the straying sheep?  That they may remain within bounds for the future.  Christ has come to save sinners, that is to say, He brings them to repentance, and pardons their transgressions, in order that, for the future, they may walk in newness of life, and not commit the sins of which they were guilty before.  Thus if He brings back one who has been a liar, it is to truth that he returns, and Christ expects him to speak the truth ever after.  If He brings back a drunkard, it is to temperance, and He expects him to be sober for the future.  If He brings back one who has sinned through impurity, it is to chastity and modesty.  This is what S. Paul means when he says, \"Put off concerning the former conversation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind.  Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour.  Let him that stole steal no more, let no corrupt conversation proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying.  Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice.  And be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another.\"  II.  We will consider Christ as the Judge.  The time will come when He will separate the bad from the good, when He will go over His fold, and pick out all those diseased sheep which are good for nothing, and which taint and infect the others, and will cast them outside.  That is to say, the time will come, when Christ will no more call sinners to Him, and bring them to His Church, but will examine those who are in His Church, and unless they have mended their ways, unless they have become better for being there, He will throw them out, and have nothing further to do with them.  When Joshua was leading the people of God into the Promised Land, God said to Joshua, \"Up!  Sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow.\"  In what did this sanctification consist?  \"Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken: and he brought the family of Judah; and took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken: and he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi was taken.\"  Then Joshua learned how this man had sinned and incurred the anger of God, and he and all Israel carried him and his family outside the camp unto the valley of Achor, \"and all Israel stoned "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21987"],["title","The Village Pulpit, Volume II. Trinity to Advent (#3)"],["body","with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.\"  That was the sanctification of Israel,--the putting away the black sheep out of the flock.  When Jesus sat with His Twelve in the supper chamber, at the Last Supper, Judas rose and went out, and when he was gone forth, Jesus said, \"Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.\" A little while before, while Judas was in the room, we are told, \"Jesus was troubled in spirit.\"  But the moment the evil one among the Apostles was cast forth, the glorification of the Son of Man began.  So it is now, and so will it be hereafter.  Now, as long as there is evil in the Church, as long as there are sinners who will not amend, as long as there are tares growing up with the wheat,--so long \"Jesus is troubled in spirit.\"  But when the great Day comes, when our true Joshua will lead the people of God into the Promised Land, then He will sanctify His people by casting out from among them the Achans; then from the company of His Elect the Judases will be banished, and the Son of Man will be glorified indeed.  CONCLUSION.--Therefore, my Brethren, be careful to amend.  You may have been strayed sheep who have been mercifully brought back to the fold, if so, amend your ways, and grow in holiness and in spiritual health; or in the Last Day you will be thrust forth as incurable, and the Children of God will be sanctified, whilst you are buried in the valley of Achor.     XLI.  _RASH DECISIONS._  4th Sunday after Trinity.  S. Luke vi. 37.  \"Judge not--condemn not--forgive.\"   INTRODUCTION.--Our Lord here condemns all rash judgments.  We know not the motives of other men's actions, and therefore have no right to pass a sweeping condemnation upon them.  From our ignorance, we ought to be cautious and merciful in our judgments, and from our own weakness, we should be forgiving to those who have trespassed against us.  Rash judgments arise from pride.  It is because we are puffed up with a high opinion of our own selves, our own goodness, the soundness of our judgment, the sharpness of our perception, that we are so prompt to pass judgment on others.  SUBJECT.--This same Pride urges us to something else, Persistency in maintaining that on which we have determined, even after we know it is unwise.  It is of this which I am going to speak to-day.  This fault is so closely akin to rash judgment of others, that I may well address you on the subject upon a Sunday when our Lord warns against the other.  I.  Many a man, out of pride, sticks to what he says after he knows that it is wrong.  He will not admit that he is wrong, or he is moved by a false sense of what is due to himself to hold to his word, or to his opinion, when his conscience tells him that he is in error.  You must have met with those stubborn persons who are not to be moved by any argument, not to be convinced by any proof, that they are wrong. They have made up their minds once for all, and are no longer open to reverse their decision.  Let us look to Scripture, and see if we have any examples of such.  I find two; and one of these is in a man of whom we might have hoped better things--King David.  I.  When David came to the kingdom, he was very anxious to show kindness to any son of Jonathan whom he might find; and he heard of Mephibosheth, who was lame in both his feet, and at once made over to him all the landed property that had belonged to King Saul, his grandfather.  After seven years, Absalom, David's son, conspired against his father, and David was obliged to fly from Jerusalem, with a few friends.  As David was escaping, there came to him Ziba, a servant of Mephibosheth, with a couple of asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine.  Then David asked Ziba what these were for, and Ziba answered that he had brought them to the king as a present, thinking he might need them in his flight.  And the king asked after Mephibosheth; then Ziba said, \"O! he is at home in Jerusalem, he said in my hearing, A good time is coming to me.  To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.\"  Now all this was a wicked lie.  Mephibosheth had sent the present, and Ziba had promised to tell David why his master could not come with him, because he was crippled in both his feet, and could not get about.  As for any idea of recovering the throne of Saul, it had not once entered his head.  Now when David heard the slander of Ziba, he was very angry with Mephibosheth, and at once he judged him, and condemned him, without waiting to hear more, and said to Ziba, \"Behold, I will give thee all that belonged to Mephibosheth, if ever I get back to Jerusalem and recover my power.\"  Not long after there was a great battle, and Absalom was slain, and the enemies of David put to flight.  Then David returned over Jordan from the wilderness where he had taken refuge, and Mephibosheth met him. This good man, full of love for David, \"had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes,\" all the time of David's absence, to shew his great grief.  David at once reproached him for his disloyalty, and then only he heard how great a lie Ziba had told.  Then David answered, \"Why speakest thou any more of thy matters?  I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.\"  Mark the wicked injustice.  The lying, slanderous servant is rewarded with half the property of poor Mephibosheth,--why?--because David had promised him the whole when misinformed.  David knows that Ziba has acted falsely, yet, because he had said to him that he should be given the land of his master, he keeps his word to him, though he knows he is doing an injustice to Mephibosheth.  There you have a pretty example of an obstinate man sticking to what he has said, after he is convinced that he has been misled, and doing a great wrong rather than acknowledge that he had judged rashly, and condemned on no good grounds.  II.  I can give you another example.  King Herod was pleased with the dancing of the daughter of Herodias one evening at a supper, and he swore to her, when he was half tipsy, that he would give her what she liked in reward for her display.  Then she asked him to cut off the head of S. John the Baptist, and give it her in a dish.  Now, as soon as she asked this, the king was sorry, for he knew that S. John was a good man, and he knew also that he had no right to have a man murdered in prison to please the whim of a wicked woman; however, because he had passed his word, he was too proud and cowardly to go back from it, and refuse her what she had no right to ask.  Then he sent an executioner, and he cut off the head of the saint, and put it in a dish, and it was brought thus to the girl, and she carried it to her mother.  III.  A man is right to stick to his word, if his word be right.  He is right to stick to his promise, if he have promised that over which he has a just right.  He is right to stick to his opinion if his opinion be founded on good grounds, and if he have heard nothing that ought to cause him to alter it.  But--no man has any right to stick to his opinion simply because it is his opinion.  He has no right to hold a promise which he had no right to make.  He has no right to adhere to a harsh judgment simply because he has formed that judgment.  When our Lord bids us not judge, He bids us be very cautious in forming a decided opinion, and in sticking to it through thick and thin.  We know so little here, and so imperfectly, that our opinions must be formed on uncertain grounds, and therefore we have no right to be tenacious about them.  Yet many persons are as touchy about their opinions as though it were a sacrilege to dispute them.  Some of the greatest injustices have been done through obstinacy, in clinging to opinions that have become untenable.  CONCLUSION.--Remember then the lessons taught you by our Lord in this day's Gospel, and also by the conduct of David.  Be very cautious of forming a judgment, and when you have formed one, do not allow Pride to stand in the way of confessing your fault, and changing your opinion, when you are given reasonable grounds for so doing.     XLII.  _THE SECRET OF SUCCESS._  5th Sunday after Trinity  S. Luke v. 5.  \"We have taken nothing; nevertheless at Thy word, I will let down the net.\"   INTRODUCTION.--S. Peter and the other Apostles had been fishing all night, and had met with no success at all, then Jesus entered into the boat of Simon, and bade him launch out and let down his net.  S. Peter did not hesitate.  He had met with no success when fishing in the night, nevertheless now, at the word of Christ, he fishes again, and this time the net encloses a great multitude, so that the net breaks. No doubt our Lord desired to show those who were to become fishers of men that there were two ways of doing a thing, and that one way would be successful and the other would not.  If they were going to become fishers of men, they must try to catch them by carrying Christ, _i.e._ a Christlike spirit, with them, and the spirit of Christ is love and gentleness.  If they were to be successful in winning souls, they must have a loving zeal, and that would gain more than hard work without love.  SUBJECT.--We are all of us, in our several callings, fishers of souls. Of course, especially are the clergy fishers, but not they only, every man who loves God must seek to win souls for God, every man who is in the net of the Church must seek to draw others into the same net.  If the fisher is to be successful, he must fish in the spirit of Christ, that is, actuated by love, and must deal gently with the souls he desires to gain.  I.  I say, we are all fishers.  Those of us who are parents desire to draw to Christ the souls of our children, those who are masters, the souls of their servants.  The husband seeks to win the wife, and the believing wife the husband.  \"W"]]]
