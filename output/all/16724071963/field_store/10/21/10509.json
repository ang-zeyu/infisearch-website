The Hon. Andrew was smiling with undisguised cheerfulness.  \"We are all loyal--thoroughly loyal,\" said the latter. \"I've bought some Liberty Bonds already, my girl, but you can put me down for a hundred dollars more. We must support our country in every possible way, with effort, with money, with our flesh and blood. I have no children, but my two nephews and a second cousin are now in France!\"  \"For my part,\" added Professor Dyer, \"I have hesitated as to how much of my meagre salary I can afford to spend. But I think I can handle five hundred dollars' worth.\"  \"Thank you,\" said Mary Louise, somewhat puzzled by these offers. \"It isn't like risking the money; it's a solid investment in the best securities in the world.\"  \"I know,\" returned the Professor, nodding gravely, \"But I'm not thinking of that. I'm a poor man, as you probably know, but what I have is at my country's disposal, since it is evident that my country needs it.\"  \"Doesn't that shame you, sir?\" asked Mary Louise brightly, as she turned to Silas Herring. \"You're a business man, and they say--although I confess I doubt it--that you're a loyal American. You can convince me of the fact by purchasing a liberal share of bonds. Then I can forget your dreadful words. Then I can carry to everyone the news that you've made a splendid investment in Liberty Bonds. Even if you honestly think the administration has been at fault, it won't do any good to grumble. We are in this war, sir, and we've got to win it, that you and every other American may enjoy prosperity and freedom. How much shall I say that you have subscribed, Mr. Herring?\"  He studied her face, his expression never changing. Mary Louise wondered if he could read her suspicion and dislike of him, despite her efforts to smother those feelings in the cause of Liberty. Then Herring looked at Professor Dyer, who stood meekly, with downcast eyes. Next the grocer gazed at the supervisor, who smiled in a shrewd way and gave a brief nod.  Mr. Herring frowned. He drummed nervously with his fingers on his mahogany desk. Then he reached for his check-book and with grim deliberation wrote a check and handed it to Mary Louise.  \"You've won, young lady,\" he admitted. \"I'm too good an American to approve what has been done down at Washington, but I'll help keep our flag waving, as the Professor suggests. When we've won our war--and of course we shall win--there will be a day of reckoning for every official who is judged by our citizens to have been disloyal, however high his station. Good afternoon!\"  The first impulse of Mary Louise was to crumple up the check and throw it in the man's face, to show her resentment of his base insinuations. But as she glanced at the check she saw it was for ten thousand dollars, and that meant sinews of war--help for our soldiers and our allies. She couldn't thank the man, but she bowed coldly and left the private office. Professor Dyer accompanied her and at the outer door he said to the girl:  \"Silas Herring's heart is in the right place, as you see by his generous check. Of course, he might have bought more bonds than that, as he is very wealthy, but he is an obstinate man and it is a triumph for our sacred cause that he was induced to buy at all. You are doing a noble work, my child, and I admire you for having undertaken the task. If I can be of service to you, pray command me.\"  \"Urge everyone you meet to buy bonds,\" suggested Mary Louise. She did not care to discuss Silas Herring.  \"I'll do that, indeed,\" promised the school superintendent. But as he watched her depart, there was a queer expression on his lean face that it was well Mary Louise did not see.   CHAPTER IV THE TRAITOR  When the Liberty Girls met that evening at the home of Alora Jones, it was found that Mary Louise had sold more bonds than any of the others, although Laura Hilton had secured one subscription of fifty thousand dollars from the Dorfield National Steel Works, the manager of which industry, Mr. Colton, was a relative of the girl. Altogether, the day's work had netted them two hundred and fourteen thousand dollars, and as soon as she could escape Mary Louise rushed home to report their success to her grandfather.  \"In one day, Gran'pa Jim!\" she cried exultantly, and the old colonel's eyes sparkled as he replied:  \"That makes our great mass-meeting look pretty small; doesn't it, my dear? I consider it wonderful! With four more such days our quota would be over-subscribed.\"  \"That's what we shall try for,\" she declared, and then told him who the biggest bond buyers had been--mostly those who had refused to listen to the regular Committee or had not been influenced by their carefully prepared arguments.  \"It's just because we are girls, and they are ashamed to refuse us,\" she acknowledged. \"It seems like taking an unfair advantage of them, I know, but those who need urging and shaming, to induce them to respond loyally to the nation's needs, deserve no consideration. We're not robbing them, either,\" she added, \"but just inducing them to make a safe investment. Isn't that true, Gran'pa Jim?\"  \"What surprises me most,\" he responded, \"is how you ever managed to load your little head with so much mature wisdom. I'd no idea, Mary Louise, you were so interested in the war and our national propaganda for waging it successfully.\"  \"Why, I read the newspapers, you know, and I've listened to you spout patriotism, and ever since we joined the Allies against Germany, my girl chums and I have been secretly organized as a band of Liberty Girls, determined to do our bit in winning the war. This is the first chance, though, that we've ever had to show what we can do, and we are very proud and happy to-night to realize that we're backing Uncle Sam to some purpose.\"  \"This war,\" remarked the old soldier, thoughtfully, \"is bringing the women of all nations into marked prominence, for it is undeniable that their fervid patriotism outranks that of the men. But you are mere girls, and I marvel at your sagacity and devotion, heretofore unsuspected. If you can follow to-day's success until Saturday, and secure our quota of subscriptions to the bonds, not only Dorfield but all the nation will be proud of your achievement.\"  \"We shall do our best,\" replied the girl, simply, although her cheeks glowed pink under such praise. \"There are enough slackers still to be interviewed to bring the quota up to the required amount and with to-day's success to hearten us, I am sure we shall end the week triumphantly.\"  Next morning the Liberty Girls sallied forth early, all six aglow with enthusiasm. Mary Louise consulted her carefully prepared list and found that her first calf was to be at McGill's drug store. She found Mr. McGill looking over his morning's mail, but moments were precious, so she at once stated her errand.  The old druggist glanced up at the girl under his spectacles, noted her patriotic attire and the eager look on her pretty face, and slowly shook his head.  \"I'm sorry, Miss Burrows, but I can't afford it,\" he said evasively.  \"Oh, Mr. McGill! I'm sure you are mistaken,\" she replied. \"You can afford insurance, you know, to protect your stock, and this money for Uncle Sam is an insurance that your home and business will be protected from the ravages of a ruthless foe.\"  He stared at her thoughtfully a moment. Then he selected a paper from his mail and handed it to her.  \"Read that,\" he said briefly.  Mary Louise read it. It was a circular, printed in small, open-faced, capital type on plain white paper, and unsigned. It said:  \"The Treasury Department is asking us to invest billions in what are termed Liberty Bonds. It has the 'liberty' to lend these billions to irresponsible or bankrupt nations of Europe, who are fighting an unprofitable war. Some of our dollars will equip an army of Amer- ican boys to fight on Europe's battle- fields. This may be good business. Our excited politicians down at Washington may think they are acting for our best good. But what becomes of the money, finally? Will our millionaire government contractors become billionaires when the money--our money--is spent? Do you think the days of graft are past and gone? Have politicians become honest now that they are handling untold sums? Let us consider these questions when we are asked to subscribe for Liberty Bonds.\"  \"Why, this is treason!\" cried Mary Louise, gasping from sheer amazement and indignation. \"It's a--a--treacherous, vile, disloyal insinuation. Some German spy wrote that, and he ought to be hanged for it!\"  The druggist nodded. He picked up the envelope that had contained the circular and scrutinized it closely.  \"Really, it looks like foreign handwriting; doesn't it?\" he agreed, handing her the envelope. \"It is postmarked 'Dorfield' and was posted last evening. The whole town is buzzing about the wonderful work of the Liberty Girls yesterday. Perhaps your success is responsible for this-- this--opposition.\"  Mary Louise's cheeks were burning. Her eyes flashed.  \"May I keep this--_thing?\"_ she asked, with a shudder of disgust as she thrust the circular into its envelope.  \"Certainly, if you wish.\"  \"And will you let an enemy attack like that influence you, Mr. McGill?\"  He smiled, rather grimly.  \"Yes. I'll invest five hundred in the bonds. I had already decided to put in a hundred dollars, but for a moment this veiled accusation bewildered me. You're right; it's treasonable. It will be hard for me to raise five hundred, just now, but I'll do it. I want that to be my answer to the German.\"  Mary Louise thanked him"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21876"],["title","Mary Louise and the Liberty Girls (#4)"],["body"," hurried away. Next door was Lacey's Shoe Store, and Mr. Lacey was reading a duplicate of that identical circular when the Liberty Girl approached him.  The man bowed low to Mary Louise, a deference she felt rendered to her red-white-and-blue uniform.  \"Good morning!\" he said pleasantly, recognizing the girl as one of his good customers. \"Glad to see you, Mary Louise, for if I give you a good fat check it may take a nasty taste out of my mouth, acquired by reading a bit of German propaganda.\"  \"I know, Mr. Lacey,\" she replied earnestly. \"I've seen that circular before. Do you mind my having it--and the envelope?\"  \"I wouldn't touch the filth, if I were you,\" he protested.  \"I'm going to run the traitor down,\" she said. \"No man has the right to live in Dorfield--or in America--who could be guilty of such disloyalty.\"  He gave her the circular and his check for Liberty Bonds, and she passed on to the next store. During the morning Mary Louise discovered several more of the traitorous circulars. Some merchants would not admit having received the warning; others, through their arguments, convinced the girl they had not only read the screed but had been influenced by it. Perhaps it did not seriously affect her sales of bonds, but she felt that it did and her indignation grew steadily. By noon she was tingling with resentment and when she joined the other Liberty Girls at luncheon, she found them all excited over the circular and demanding vengeance on the offender--whoever he might happen to be.  \"Isn't it dreadful!\" exclaimed Lucile Neal, \"and what could the person hope to gain by it?\"  \"Why, he wanted to kill the Liberty Bond sale,\" explained Alora Jones.  \"A suspicion that this money is to be misapplied, or that officials will steal part of it, is likely to prevent a lot of foolish people from investing in the bonds. All this morning I could see that men were influenced by this circular, which has been pretty generally distributed.\"  \"Yes; one or two repeated the very words of the circular to me,\" said Laura Hilton; \"but I just asked them if they considered the United States able to pay its bonds and they were forced to admit it was a safe investment, however the money might be used.\"  \"I'd like to know who sent that circular,\" exclaimed Edna Barlow.  \"I'm going to find out!\" asserted Mary Louise.  \"How, my dear?\"  \"There must be ways of tracing such a bunch of circulars as were mailed last evening. I'm going to see the Chief of Police and put him on the trail.\"  \"Do you know,\" said Edna, a thoughtful and rather quiet girl, \"I already have a suspicion who the traitor is.\"  \"Who?\" an eager chorus.  \"I'm not sure I ought to speak his name, for it's only a suspicion and I may be wrong. It would be an awful thing to accuse one unjustly of such a dastardly act, wouldn't it? But--think, girls!--who is known to be against the war, and pro-German? Who did we consider an enemy to the cause of liberty until--until he happened to buy some bonds the other night and indulge in some peanut patriotism to disarm a criticism he knew was becoming dangerous?\"  They looked at one another, half frightened at the suggestion, for all knew whom she meant.  \"Perhaps,\" said Alora, slowly, \"Jake Kasker really believes in the bonds. He certainly set the example to others and led them to buy a lot of bonds. It doesn't seem reasonable, after that, to credit him with trying to prevent their sale.\"  \"Those pro-Germans,\" remarked little Jane Donovan, \"are clever and sly. They work in the dark. Kasker said he hated the war but loved the flag.\"  \"I'm afraid of those people who think devotion to our flag can cover disloyalty to our President,\" said Mary Louise earnestly.  \"But the flag represents the President, and Kasker said he'd stand by the flag to the last.\"  \"All buncombe, my dear,\" said Edna decidedly. \"That flag talk didn't take the curse off the statement that the war is all wrong.\"  \"He had to say something patriotic, or he'd have been mobbed,\" was Lucile's serious comment. \"I hadn't thought of Jake Kasker, before, but he may be the culprit.\"  \"Isn't he the only German in town who has denounced our going into the European war?\" demanded Edna.  \"No,\" said Mary Louise; \"Gran'pa has told me of several others; but none has spoken so frankly as Kasker. Anyhow, there's no harm in suspecting him, for if he is really innocent he can blame his own disloyal speeches for the suspicion. But now let us check up the morning's work and get busy again as soon as possible. We mustn't lose a single minute.\"  \"And, as we go around,\" suggested Alora, \"let us keep our eyes and ears open for traces of the traitor. There may be more than one pro-German in the conspiracy, for the circular was printed by somebody, and there are several kinds of handwriting on the addressed envelopes we have gathered. We've no time to do detective work, just now, but we can watch out, just the same.\"  Mary Louise did not mention the circular to Colonel Hathaway that evening, for he was still ill and she did not wish to annoy him.  The next day she found another circular had been put in the mails, printed from the same queer open-faced type as the first. Not so many had been sent out of these, but they were even more malicious in their suggestions. The girls were able to collect several of them for evidence and were 'more angry and resentful than ever, but they did not allow such outrageous antagonism to discourage them in their work.  Of course the Liberty Girls were not the only ones in Dorfield trying to sell bonds. Mr. Jaswell and other bankers promoted the bond sale vigorously and the regular Committee did not flag in its endeavors to secure subscriptions. On account of Colonel Hathaway's illness, Professor Dyer was selected to fill his place on the Committee and proved himself exceedingly industrious. The only trouble with the Professor was his reluctance to argue. He seemed to work early and late, visiting the wealthier and more prosperous citizens, but he accepted too easily their refusals to buy. On several occasions the Liberty Girls succeeded in making important sales where Professor Dyer had signally failed. He seemed astonished at this and told Mary Louise, with a deprecating shrug, that he feared his talents did not lie in the direction of salesmanship.  Despite the natural proportion of failures--for not all will buy bonds in any community--on the fourth day following the mass-meeting Dorfield's quota of one million was fully subscribed, and on Saturday another hundred and fifty thousand was added, creating jubilation among the loyal citizens and reflecting great credit on the Liberty Girls, the Committee, and all who had labored so well for the cause.  \"Really,\" said Professor Dyer, his voice sounding regretful when he congratulated the girls, \"our success is due principally to your patriotic organization. The figures show that you secured subscriptions for over half a million. Dear me, what a remarkable fact!\"  \"More than that,\" added Jason Jones, Alora's father, who was a wealthy artist and himself a member of the Committee, \"our girls encouraged the faltering ones to do their duty. Many a man who coldly turned our Committee down smiled at the pretty faces and dainty costumes of our Liberty Girls and wrote their checks without a murmur.\"  \"All the credit is due Mary Louise,\" declared Alora. \"It was she who proposed the idea, and who organized us and trained us and designed our Liberty costumes. Also, Mary Louise made the most sales.\"  \"Nonsense!\" cried Mary Louise, blushing red. \"I couldn't have done anything at all without the help of you girls. No one of us is entitled to more credit than the others, but all six of us may well feel proud of our success. We've done our bit to help Uncle Sam win the war.\"   CHAPTER V UNCONVINCING TESTIMONY  On Sunday \"Gran'pa Jim,\" relieved of all worry, felt \"quite himself again,\" as he expressed it, and the old gentleman strutted somewhat proudly as he marched to church with his lovely granddaughter beside him, although her uniform was to-day discarded for a neat tailor-suit. Mary Louise had always been a favorite in Dorfield, but the past week had made her a heroine in the eyes of all patriotic citizens. Many were the looks of admiration and approval cast at the young girl this morning as she passed along the streets beside the old colonel.  In the afternoon, as they sat in the cosy study at home, the girl for the first time showed her grandfather the disloyal circulars, relating how indignant the Liberty Girls had been at encountering such dastardly opposition.  Colonel Hathaway studied the circulars carefully. He compared the handwritings on the different envelopes, and when Mary Louise said positively: \"That man must be discovered and arrested!\" her grandfather nodded his head and replied:  \"He is a dangerous man. Not especially on account of these mischievous utterances, which are too foolish to be considered seriously, but because such a person is sure to attempt other venomous deeds which might prove more important. German propaganda must be dealt with sternly and all opposition to the administration thoroughly crushed. It will never do to allow a man like this to go unrebuked and unpunished.\"  \"What, then, would you suggest?\" asked the girl.  \"The police should be notified. Chief Farnum is a clever officer and intensely patriotic, from all I have heard. I think he will have no difficulty in discovering who is responsible for these circulars.\"  \"I shall go to him to-morrow,\" decided Mary Louise. \"I had the same idea, Gran'pa Jim; it's a matter for the police to handle.\"  But when she had obtained an interview with Chief of Police Farnum the next morning and had silently laid one of the circulars on his desk before him, an announcement of her errand, Farnum merely glanced at it, smiled and then flashed a shrewd look into the girl's face.  \"Well!\" said the Chief, in an interrogative tone.  \"Those treasonable circulars"]]]
