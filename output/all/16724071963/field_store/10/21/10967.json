Their joint pen-name, derived from their middle names (Philip and Mark), was coined soon after their original meeting, at a science-fiction convention. Both men were drunk at the time, which explains a good deal, and only one has ever sobered up. A matter for constant contention between the collaborators is which one.  They have been collaborating for some time now, and have devised an interesting method of work: Mr. Garrett handles the verbs, the adverbs and the interjections, Mr. Janifer the nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. Conjunctions are a matter of joint decision, and in the case of a tie, the entire game is replayed at Fenway Park, Boston, early in the following year.  BRAIN TWISTER was fifteen years in the making, of which time three days were spent in the actual writing. When the book was finished, both authors relaxed in the mutual pleasure of nervous breakdowns, from which it is not certain that either has ever recovered.  Mr. Garrett is a large, roundish fellow with a beard. He wears flowered vests and always carries a small talisman which no one has ever seen. Mr. Janifer is a somewhat shorter and thinner type, with a shorter and thinner beard. His vests are in solid colors, he wears horn-rimmed glasses because he has always done so, and he is never found without a souvenir subway token from the City of New York.  The personal lives of the authors differ widely. Mr. Garrett's hobbies, for instance, include such sports as close-order drill and river pollution. Mr. Janifer, a less active type, prefers sedentary games such as humming or blinking.  Mr. Garrett is engaged to an exotically beautiful creature, and the two plan to be married as soon as they run out of excuses. Mr. Janifer, on the other hand, is fascinated by women, and hopes some day to meet one.                              Brain Twister                              Mark Phillips         A shorter version of this work appeared in _Astounding        Science Fiction_ under the title of _That Sweet Little        Old Lady_.                                 Prologue  In nineteen-fourteen, it was enemy aliens.  In nineteen-thirty, it was Wobblies.  In nineteen-fifty-seven, it was fellow-travelers.  And, in nineteen seventy-one, Kenneth J. Malone rolled wearily out of bed wondering what the hell it was going to be now.  One thing, he told himself, was absolutely certain: it was going to be terrible. It always was.  He managed to stand up, although he was swaying slightly when he walked across the room to the mirror for his usual morning look at himself. He didn't much like staring at his own face, first thing in the morning, but then, he told himself, it was part of the toughening- up process every FBI agent had to go through. You had to learn to stand up and take it when things got rough, he reminded himself. He blinked and looked into the mirror.  His image blinked back.  He tried a smile. It looked pretty horrible, he thought--but, then, the mirror had a slight ripple in it, and the ripple distorted everything. Malone's face looked as if it had been gently patted with a waffle-iron.  And, of course, it was still early morning, and that meant he was having a little difficulty in focusing his eyes.  Vaguely, he tried to remember the night before. He was just ending his vacation, and he thought he recalled having a final farewell party for two or three lovely female types he had chanced to meet in what was still the world's finest City of Opportunity, Washington, D.C. (latest female-to-male ratio, five-and-a-half to one). The party had been a classic of its kind, complete with hot and cold running ideas of all sorts, and lots and lots of nice powerful liquor.  Malone decided sadly that the ripple wasn't in the mirror, but in his head. He stared at his unshaven face blearily.  Blink. Ripple.  Quite impossible, he told himself. Nobody could conceivably look as horrible as Kenneth J. Malone thought he did. Things just couldn't be as bad as all that.  Ignoring a still, small voice which asked persistently: \"Why not?\" he turned away from the mirror and set about finding his clothes. He determined to take his time about getting ready for work: after all, nobody could really complain if he arrived late on his first day after vacation. Everybody knew how tired vacations made a person.  And, besides, there was probably nothing happening anyway. Things had, he recalled with faint pleasure, been pretty quiet lately. Ever since the counterfeiting gang he'd caught had been put away, crime seemed to have dropped to the nice, simple levels of the 1950's and '60's. Maybe, he hoped suddenly, he'd be able to spend some time catching up on his scientific techniques, or his math, or pistol practice....  The thought of pistol practice made his head begin to throb with the authority of a true hangover. There were fifty or sixty small gnomes inside his skull, he realized, all of them with tiny little hammers. They were mining for lead.  \"The lead,\" Malone said aloud, \"is farther down. Not in the skull.\"  The gnomes paid him no attention. He shut his eyes and tried to relax. The gnomes went right ahead with their work, and microscopic regiments of Eagle Scouts began marching steadily along his nerves.  There were people, Malone had always understood, who bounced out of their beds and greeted each new day with a smile. It didn't sound possible, but then again there were some pretty strange people. The head of that counterfeiting ring, for instance: where had he got the idea of picking an alias like Andr√© Gide?  Clutching at his whirling thoughts, Malone opened his eyes, winced, and began to get dressed. At least, he thought, it was going to be a peaceful day.  It was at this second that his private intercom buzzed.  Malone winced again. \"To hell with you,\" he called at the thing, but the buzz went on, ignoring the code shut-off. That meant, he knew, an emergency call, maybe from his Chief of Section. Maybe even from higher up.  \"I'm not even late for work yet,\" he complained. \"I will be, but I'm not yet. What are they screaming about?\"  There was, of course, only one way to find out. He shuffled painfully across the room, flipped the switch and said:  \"Malone here.\" Vaguely, he wondered if it were true. He certainly didn't feel as if he were here. Or there. Or anywhere at all, in fact.  A familiar voice came tinnily out of the receiver. \"Malone, get down here right away!\"  The voice belonged to Andrew J. Burris. Malone sighed deeply and felt grateful, for the fiftieth time, that he had never had a TV pickup installed in the intercom. He didn't want the FBI chief to see him looking as horrible as he did now, all rippled and everything. It wasn't--well, it wasn't professional, that was all.  \"I'll get dressed right away,\" he assured the intercom. \"I should be there in--\"  \"Don't bother to get dressed,\" Burris snapped. \"This is an emergency!\"  \"But, Chief--\"  \"And don't call me Chief!\"  \"Okay,\" Malone said. \"Sure. You want me to come down in my pyjamas. Right?\"  \"I want you to--\" Burris stopped. \"All right, Malone. If you want to waste time while our country's life is at stake, you go ahead. Get dressed. After all, Malone, when I say something is an emergency--\"  \"I won't get dressed, then,\" Malone said. \"Whatever you say.\"  \"Just do something!\" Burris told him desperately. \"Your country needs you. Pyjamas and all. Malone, it's a crisis!\"  Conversations with Burris, Malone told himself, were bound to be a little confusing. \"I'll be right down,\" he said.  \"Fine,\" Burris said, and hesitated. Then he added: \"Malone, do you wear the tops or the bottoms?\"  \"The what?\"  \"Of your pyjamas,\" Burris explained hurriedly. \"The top part or the bottom part?\"  \"Oh,\" Malone said. \"As a matter of fact, I wear both.\"  \"Good,\" Burris said with satisfaction. \"I wouldn't want an agent of mine arrested for indecent exposure.\" He rang off.  Malone blinked at the intercom for a minute, shut it off and then, ignoring the trip-hammers in his skull and the Eagle Scouts on his nerves, began to get dressed. Somehow, in spite of Burris' feelings of crisis, he couldn't see himself trying to flag a taxi on the streets of Washington in his pyjamas. Anyhow, not while he was awake. I dreamed I was an FBI agent, he thought sadly, in my drafty BVDs.  Besides, it was probably nothing important. These things, he told himself severely, have a way of evaporating as soon as a clear, cold intelligence got hold of them.  Then he began wondering where in hell he was going to find a clear, cold intelligence. Or even, for that matter, what one was.                                     1  \"They could be anywhere,\" Burris said, with an expression which bordered on exasperated horror. \"They could be all around us. Heaven only knows.\"  He pushed his chair back from his desk and stood up, a chunky little man with bright blue eyes and large hands. He paced to the window and looked out at Washington, and then he came back to the desk. A persistent office rumor held that he had become head of the FBI purely because he happened to have an initial _J_ in his name, but in his case the J stood for Jeremiah. And, at the moment, his tone expressed all the hopelessness of that Old Testament prophet's lamentations.  \"We're helpless,\" he said, looking at the young man with the crisp brown hair who was sitting across the desk. \"That's what it is, we're helpless.\"  Kenneth Malone tried to look dependable. \"Just tell me what to do,\" he said.  \"You're a good agent, Kenneth,\" Burris said. \"You're one of the best. That's why you've been picked for this job."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22332"],["title","Brain Twister (#1)"],["body","I want to say that I picked you personally. Believe me, there's never been anything like it before.\"  \"I'll do my best,\" Malone said at random. He was twenty-six, and he had been an FBI agent for three years. In that time, he had, among other things, managed to break up a gang of smugglers, track down a counterfeiting ring, and capture three kidnappers. For reasons which he could neither understand nor explain, no one seemed willing to attribute his record to luck.  \"I know you will,\" Burris said. \"And if anybody can crack this case, Malone, you're the man. It's just that--everything sounds so _impossible_. Even after all the conferences we've had.\"  \"Conferences?\" Malone said vaguely. He wished the Chief would get to the point. Any point. He smiled gently across the desk and tried to look competent and dependable and reassuring. Burris' expression didn't change.  \"You'll get the conference tapes later,\" Burris said. \"You can study them before you leave. I suggest you study them very carefully, Malone. Don't be like me. Don't get confused.\" He buried his face in his hands. Malone waited patiently. After a few seconds, Burris looked up. \"Did you read books when you were a child?\" he asked.  Malone said: \"What?\"  \"Books,\" Burris said. \"When you were a child. Read them.\"  \"Sure I did,\" Malone said. _\"Bomba the Jungle Boy_, and _Doctor Doolittle_, and _Lucky Starr_, and _Little Women_--\"  _\"Little Women?\"_  \"When Beth died,\" Malone said, \"I wanted to cry. But I didn't. My father said big boys don't cry.\"  \"And your father was right,\" Burris said. \"Why, when I was a--never mind. Forget about Beth and your father. Think about Lucky Starr for a minute. Remember him?\"  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"I liked those books. You know it's funny, but the books you read when you're a kid, they kind of stay with you. Know what I mean? I can still remember that one about Venus, for instance. Gee, that was--\"  \"Never mind about Venus, too,\" Burris said sharply. \"Keep your mind on the problem.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. He paused. \"What problem, sir?\" he added.  \"The problem we're discussing,\" Burris said. He gave Malone a bright, blank stare. \"My God,\" he said. \"Just listen to me.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"All right, then.\" Burris took a deep breath. He seemed nervous. Once again he stood up and went to the window. This time, he spoke without turning. \"Remember how everybody used to laugh about spaceships, and orbital satellites, and life on other planets? That was just in those Lucky Starr books. That was all just for kids, wasn't it?\"  \"Well, I don't know,\" Malone said slowly.  \"Sure it was all for kids,\" Burris said. \"It was laughable. Nobody took it seriously.\"  \"Well, _somebody_ must--\"  \"You just keep quiet and listen,\" Burris said.  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said.  Burris nodded. His hands were clasped behind his back. \"We're not laughing any more, are we, Malone?\" he said without moving.  There was silence.  \"Well, are we?\"  \"Did you want me to answer, sir?\"  \"Of course I did!\" Burris snapped.  \"You told me to keep quiet and--\"  \"Never mind what I told you,\" Burris said. \"Just do what I told you.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said. \"No, sir,\" he added after a second.  \"No, sir, what?\" Burris asked softly.  \"No, sir, we're not laughing any more,\" Malone said.  \"Ah,\" Burris said. \"And why aren't we laughing any more?\"  There was a little pause. Malone said, tentatively: \"Because there's nothing to laugh about, sir?\"  Burris whirled. \"On the head!\" he said happily. \"You've hit the nail on the head, Kenneth. I knew I could depend on you.\" His voice grew serious again, and thoughtful. \"We're not laughing any more because there's nothing to laugh about. We have orbital satellites, and we've landed on the Moon with an atomic rocket. The planets are the next step, and after that the stars. Man's heritage, Kenneth. The stars. And the stars, Kenneth, belong to Man--not to the Russians!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said soberly.  \"So,\" Burris said, \"we should learn not to laugh any more. But have we?\"  \"I don't know, sir.\"  \"We haven't,\" Burris said with decision. \"Can you read my mind?\"  \"No, sir,\" Malone said.  \"Can I read your mind?\"  Malone hesitated. At last he said: \"Not that I know of, sir.\"  \"Well, I can't,\" Burris snapped. \"And can any of us read each other's mind?\"  Malone shook his head. \"No, sir,\" he said.  Burris nodded. \"That's the problem,\" he said. \"That's the case I'm sending you out to crack.\"  This time, the silence was a long one.  At last, Malone said: \"What problem, sir?\"  \"Mind reading,\" Burris said. \"There's a spy at work in the Nevada plant, Kenneth. And the spy is a telepath.\"                                * * * * *  The video tapes were very clear and very complete. There were a great many of them, and it was long after nine o'clock when Kenneth Malone decided to take a break and get some fresh air. Washington was a good city for walking, even at night, and Malone liked to walk. Sometimes he pretended, even to himself, that he got his best ideas while walking, but he knew perfectly well that wasn't true. His best ideas just seemed to come to him, out of nowhere, precisely as the situation demanded them.  He was just lucky, that was all. He had a talent for being lucky. But nobody would ever believe that. A record like his was spectacular, even in the annals of the FBI, and Burris himself believed that the record showed some kind of superior ability.  Malone knew that wasn't true, but what could he do about it? After all, he didn't want to resign, did he? It was kind of romantic and exciting to be an FBI agent, even after three years. A man got a chance to travel around a lot and see things, and it was interesting. The pay was pretty good, too.  The only trouble was that, if he didn't quit, he was going to have to find a telepath.  The notion of telepathic spies just didn't sound right to Malone. It bothered him in a remote sort of way. Not that the idea of telepathy itself was alien to him--after all, he was even more aware than the average citizen that research had been going on in that field for something over a quarter of a century, and that the research was even speeding up.  But the cold fact that a telepathy-detecting device had been invented somehow shocked his sense of propriety, and his notions of privacy. It wasn't decent, that was all.  There ought to be something sacred, he told himself angrily.  He stopped walking and looked up. He was on Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward the White House.  That was no good. He went to the corner and turned off, down the block. He had, he told himself, nothing at all to see the President about.  Not yet, anyhow.  The streets were dark and very peaceful. _I get my best ideas while walking_, Malone said without convincing himself. He thought back to the video tapes.  The report on the original use of the machine itself had been on one of the first tapes, and Malone could still see and hear it. That was one thing he did have, he reflected; his memory was pretty good.  Burris had been the first speaker on the tapes, and he'd given the serial and reference number in a cold, matter-of-fact voice. His face had been perfectly blank, and he looked just like the head of the FBI people were accustomed to seeing on their TV and newsreel screens. Malone wondered what had happened to him between the time the tapes had been made and the time he'd sent for Malone.  Maybe the whole notion of telepathy was beginning to get him, Malone thought.  Burris recited the standard tape-opening in a rapid mumble, like a priest involved in the formula of the Mass: \"Any person or agent unauthorized for this tape please refrain from viewing further, under penalties as prescribed by law.\" Then he looked off, out past the screen to the left, and said: \"Dr. Thomas O'Connor, of Westinghouse Laboratories. Will you come here, Dr. O'Connor?\"  Dr. O'Connor came into the lighted square of screen slowly, looking all around him. \"This is very fascinating,\" he said, blinking in the lamplight. \"I hadn't realized that you people took so many precautions--\"  He was, Malone thought, somewhere between fifty and sixty, tall and thin with skin so transparent that he nearly looked like a living X- ray. He had pale blue eyes and pale white hair, and, Malone thought, if there ever were a contest for the best-looking ghost, Dr. Thomas O'Connor would win it hands (or phalanges) down.  \"This is all necessary for the national security,\" Burris said, a little sternly.  \"Oh,\" Dr. O'Connor said quickly. \"I realize that, of course. Naturally. I can certainly see that.\"  \"Let's go ahead, shall we?\" Burris said.  O'Connor nodded. \"Certainly. Certainly.\"  Burris said: \"Well, then,\" and paused. After a second he started again: \"Now, Dr. O'Connor, would you please give us a sort of verbal rundown on this for our records?\"  \"Of course,\" Dr. O'Connor said. He smiled into the video cameras and cleared his throat. \"I take it you don't want an explanation of how this machine works. I mean: you don't want a technical exposition, do you?\"  \"No,\" Burris said, and added: \"Not by any means. Just tell us what it does.\"  Dr. O'Connor suddenly reminded Malone of a professor he'd had in college for one of the law courses. He had, Malone thought, the same smiling gravity of demeanor, the same condescending attitude of absolute authority. It was clear that Dr. O'Connor lived in a world of his own, a world that was not even touched by the common run of men.  \"Well,\" he began, \"to put it very simply, the device indicates whether or not a man's mental--ah--processes are being influenced by outside-- by outside influences.\" He gave the cameras another little smile. \"If you will allow me, I will demonstrate on the machine itself.\"  He took two steps that carried him out of camera range, and returned wheeling a large heavy-looking box. Dangling from the metal covering were a number of wires and attachments. A long cord led from the box to the floor and snaked out of sight to the"]]]
