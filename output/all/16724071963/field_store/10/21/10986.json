Klaft and the police officers peered from their respective windows, in calculated withdrawal. Kinton, disturbed, tried to remember whether he had spoken in Terran or Tepoktan.  Would Birken listen if he tried reasoning, he asked himself. Maybe if he showed the man how they had proved the unpredictability of openings through the shifting Dome of Eyes--  An exclamation from the constable drew his attention. He rose, and room was made for him at the opposite window.         *       *       *       *       *  In the distance, beyond the town landing field they were now approaching, Kinton saw a halted ground car. Across the plain which was colored a yellowish tan by a short, grass-like growth, a lone figure plodded toward the upthrust bulk of the spaceship that had never flown.  \"Never mind landing at the town!\" snapped Kinton. \"Go directly out to the ship!\"  Klaft relayed the command to the pilot. The helicopter swept in a descending curve across the plain toward the gleaming hull.  As they passed the man below, Birken looked up. He continued to limp along at a brisk pace with the aid of what looked like a short spear.  \"Go down!\" Kinton ordered.  The pilot landed about a hundred yards from the spaceship. By the time his passengers had alighted, however, Birken had drawn level with them, about fifty feet away.  \"Birken!\" shouted Kinton. \"Where do you think you're going?\"  Seeing that no one ran after him, Birken slowed his pace, but kept walking toward the ship. He watched them over his shoulder.  \"Sorry, Kinton,\" he shouted with no noticeable tone of regret. \"I figure I better travel on for my health.\"  \"It's not so damn healthy up there!\" called Kinton. \"I told you how there's no clear path--\"  \"Yeah, yeah, you told me. That don't mean I gotta believe it.\"  \"Wait! Don't you think they tried sending unmanned rockets up? Every one was struck and exploded.\"  Birken showed no more change of expression than if the other had commented on the weather.  Kinton had stepped forward six or eight paces, irritated despite his anxiety at the way Birken persisted in drifting before him.  Kinton couldn't just grab him--bad leg or not, he could probably break the older man in two.  He glanced back at the Tepoktans beside the helicopter, Klaft, the pilot, the officer, the constable with the rocket weapon.  They stood quietly, looking back at him.  The call for help that had risen to his lips died there.  \"Not _their_ party,\" he muttered. He turned again to Birken, who still retreated toward the ship. \"But he'll only get himself killed _and_ destroy the ship! Or if some miracle gets him through, that's worse! He's nothing to turn loose on a civilized colony again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  A twinge of shame tugged down the corners of his mouth as he realized that keeping Birken here would also expose a highly cultured people to an unscrupulous criminal who had already committed murder the very first time he had been crossed.  \"Birken!\" he shouted. \"For the last time! Do you want me to send them to drag you back here?\"  Birken stopped at that. He regarded the motionless Tepoktans with a derisive sneer.  \"They don't look too eager to me,\" he taunted.  Kinton growled a Tepoktan expression the meaning of which he had deduced after hearing it used by the dam workers.  He whirled to run toward the helicopter. Hardly had he taken two steps, however, when he saw startled changes in the carefully blank looks of his escort. The constable half raised his heavy weapon, and Klaft sprang forward with a hissing cry.  By the time Kinton's aging muscles obeyed his impulse to sidestep, the spear had already hurtled past. It had missed him by an error of over six feet.  He felt his face flushing with sudden anger. Birken was running as best he could toward the spaceship, and had covered nearly half the distance.  Kinton ran at the Tepoktans, brushing aside the concerned Klaft. He snatched the heavy weapon from the surprised constable.  He turned and raised it to his chest. Because of the shortness of Tepoktan arms, the launcher was constructed so that the butt rested against the chest with the sighting loops before the eyes. The little rocket tubes were above head height, to prevent the handler's catching the blast.  The circles of the sights weaved and danced about the running figure. Kinton realized to his surprise that the effort of seizing the weapon had him panting. Or was it the fright at having a spear thrown at him? He decided that Birken had not come close enough for that, and wondered if he was afraid of his own impending action.  It wasn't fair, he complained to himself. The poor slob only had a spear, and a man couldn't blame him for wanting to get back to his own sort. He was limping ... hurt ... how could they expect him to realize--?  Then, abruptly, his lips tightened to a thin line. The sights steadied on Birken as the latter approached the foot of the ladder leading to the entrance port of the spaceship.  Kinton pressed the firing stud.  Across the hundred-yard space streaked four flaring little projectiles. Kinton, without exactly seeing each, was aware of the general lines of flight diverging gradually to bracket the figure of Birken.  One struck the ground beside the man just as he set one foot on the bottom rung of the ladder, and skittered away past one fin of the ship before exploding. Two others burst against the hull, scattering metal fragments, and another puffed on the upright of the ladder just above Birken's head.         *       *       *       *       *  The spaceman was blown back from the ladder. He balanced on his heels for a moment with outstretched fingers reaching toward the grips from which they had been torn. Then he crumpled into a limp huddle on the yellowing turf.  Kinton sighed.  The constable took the weapon from him, reloaded deftly, and proffered it again. When the Terran did not reach for it, the officer held out a clawed hand to receive it. He gestured silently, and the constable trotted across the intervening ground to bend over Birken.  \"He is dead,\" said Klaft when the constable straightened up with a curt wave.  \"Will ... will you have someone see to him, please?\" Kinton requested, turning toward the helicopter.  \"Yes, George,\" said Klaft. \"George...?\"  \"Well?\"  \"It would be very instructive--that is, I believe Dr. Chuxolkhee would like to--\"  \"All right!\" yielded Kinton, surprised at the harshness of his own voice. \"Just tell him not to bring around any sketches of the various organs for a few months!\"  He climbed into the helicopter and slumped into his seat. Presently, he was aware of Klaft edging into the seat across the aisle. He looked up.  \"The police will stay until cars from town arrive. They are coming now,\" said his aide.         *       *       *       *       *  Kinton stared at his hands, wondering at the fact that they were not shaking. He felt dejected, empty, not like a man who had just been at a high pitch of excitement.  \"Why did you not let him go, George?\"  \"What? Why ... why ... he would have destroyed the ship you worked so hard to build. There is no safe path through the Dome of Eyes.\"  \"No predictable path,\" Klaft corrected. \"But what then? We would have built you another ship, George, for it was you who showed us how.\"  Kinton flexed his fingers slowly.  \"He was just no good. You know the murder he did here; we can only guess what he did among my own ... among Terrans. Should he have a chance to go back and commit more crimes?\"  \"I understand, George, the logic of it,\" said Klaft. \"I meant ... it is not my place to say this ... but you seem unhappy.\"  \"Possibly,\" grunted Kinton wrily.  \"We, too, have criminals,\" said the aide, as gently as was possible in his clicking language. \"We do not think it necessary to grieve for the pain they bring upon themselves.\"  \"No, I suppose not,\" sighed Kinton. \"I ... it's just--\"  He looked up at the pointed visage, at the strange eyes regarding him sympathetically from beneath the sloping, purple-scaled forehead.  \"It's just that now I'm lonely ... again,\" he said.

Norwood Press J.S. Cushing & Co.--Berwick & Smith Co. Norwood, Mass., U.S.A.     PREFACE   The life of Theodore Roosevelt is one well worth studying by any American boy who wishes to make something of himself and mount high on the ladder of success.  The twenty-sixth President of our country is a fine type of the true American of to-day, full of vim and vigor, quick to comprehend, and equally quick to act, not afraid to defend his opinions against all comers when satisfied that he is in the right, independent, and yet not lacking in fine social qualities, physically and morally courageous, and with a faith in himself and his God that is bound to make for good so long as he clings to it.  Theodore Roosevelt comes from countless generations of fighting stock, both in this country and abroad. And yet as a youth the future hero of San Juan Hill was a delicate lad, and many fears were entertained that he might not live to manhood. But life in the open air, with judicious athletic exercise, accomplished wonders, and he became strong and hardy to an astonishing degree.  The boyhood days of the future President were spent in New York City and at the family's country home, Oyster Bay, Long Island. From there he went to Harvard College, from which he graduated with high honors. Still somewhat delicate in health, he travelled in Europe, studied for a short time at Dresden, and took to climbing the Alps and other noted mountains.  His mind had gravitated toward literature, and he was writing a naval history of the War of 1812 when something prompted him to take up politics, and almost before he knew it he was elected a New York State assemblyman. He served in this capacity for three terms, and many are the stories told of how he fought against corruption first, last, and all the time.  The death of his first wife and of his beloved mother were at this time a great blow to him, and leaving his one little daughter with relatives, he struck out for the great West, where, in the Bad Lands, so called, he located as ranchman and hunter, filling in his spare hours by studying and by writing on various outdoor subjects, works which have become decidedly popular, and which show well his gifts as an author and as an observer of nature.  While still in great part a successful ranchman, he ran for mayor of New York and was defeated. He now devoted himself with increased energy to his literary labors until, soon after, he was appointed by President Harrison a member of the Civil Service Commission. He served on this commission with marked ability for six years, when he resigned to become police commissioner of New York City.  Theodore Roosevelt's work as a police commissioner will not be readily forgotten. The whole tone of the service was at once raised, and for the first time in many years the metropolis had \"dry\" Sundays, when every saloon in the city was tightly closed. This strict compliance with the law made him some enemies, but to these he paid no heed, for he was doing only his duty.  When William McKinley was nominated for the Presidency the first time, Theodore Roosevelt was one of his most enthusiastic supporters. Upon the election of McKinley, John D. Long was appointed Secretary of the Navy and Theodore Roosevelt became the First Assistant Secretary. Ever since writing his naval history the newly appointed assistant had made a close study of naval matters, and now he applied himself with vigor to the duties of his office; and it was primarily through his efforts that when the war with Spain came, our war-ships and our coast defences were in much better condition than they had been at any time previous in our history.  With the outbreak of the war, Theodore Roosevelt resigned. \"My duty here is done,\" he said. \"My place is in the field.\" And without loss of time he and his intimate friend, Dr. Leonard Wood, began the organization of that body of troops which was officially designated as the First United States Volunteer Cavalry, but which speedily became known everywhere as the Rough Riders,--a body as unique as the world has ever seen, being made up of men from all over the Union, but principally from four Territories, and including hunters, cowboys, soldiers of fortune, foot-ball and base-ball champions, college graduates, ex-policemen, with American, Irish, Dutch, German, Mexican, and Indian blood in their veins,--truly a remarkable collection, but every man and officer strong and hardy, full of courage, a good horseman, and a fine shot.  From the very start, the Rough Riders were anxious to get into the fight, and the opportunity was not long in coming. From Florida the command was transported to Daiquiri, on the southern coast of Cuba, and then began the advance upon the city of Santiago, which brought on the engagement at La Guasima, followed by the thrilling battle of San Juan Hill, in which the Rough Riders distinguished themselves in a manner that will never be forgotten. In the very thickest of this fight was Colonel Roosevelt, urging his men forward to victory, regardless of the shot and shell falling upon all sides. A hero truly, and such heroes are not forgotten.  Upon the close of the war Theodore Roosevelt thought to retire to private life, but this was not to be. Arriving at New York, he was hailed with delight by thousands, and at the next election was made governor of the Empire State. As governor he made friends in both of the leading political parties by his straightforwardness and his sterling honesty. Men might differ with him politically, but they could never accuse him of doing that which he himself did not firmly believe was right.  His term as governor had not yet expired when President McKinley was nominated for a second term. Again the people at large clamored for Roosevelt, and against his earnest protestations he was forced to accept the nomination for the Vice-Presidency. He was elected, and at the proper time took his seat as presiding officer of the Senate.  It was at this time a blow fell upon our nation from which we have scarcely yet recovered. President McKinley was struck down by the cowardly hand of an assassin. The Vice-President was at this time off on one of his favorite outings, but with all possible speed he came back and was sworn in as President. It was a great responsibility, and many feared that great changes in our government might result. But the fears proved groundless. Young as he was,--and he is the youngest of all of our Presidents,--he took upon himself the duty of carrying out the intentions of his predecessor, and proving to the world once again that, even though a President die, \"the government at Washington still lives.\"  There is another side to the character of our President which must not be overlooked. He is of strong religious convictions and a member of the Dutch Reformed Church. It is seldom that he is given to preaching, but when he does his words have a sincerity that proves much for the foundation of his character. He stands for what is honest and upright in political and private life, and although, being but human, he may make mistakes, he remains a Chief Magistrate well deserving the highest honors our nation can bestow.
