The boys were struck by the stones and got some of the dirt in their eyes. Then down came a second mass of the same sort.  \"Sto--stop that!\" spluttered Tom, when he could speak. \"Do you want to kill us?\"  There was no answer, but down came more dirt and stones, until the boys were almost covered. What to do they did not know, until Dick suggested they drop from the ledge and seek safety in the cave. As they went down, a fair-sized rock followed, scraping Tom's shoulder and causing him to utter a sharp cry of pain.  \"Are you hurt, Tom?\" asked his two brothers.  \"Oh, it isn't much,\" panted Tom. \"But I wish I could get my hands on that rascal, that's all!\"  \"I am sure now that it must be Dangler,\" said Dick. \"Nobody else around here would try to injure us. He is mad because we have exposed him. He must know the officers of the law are looking for him.\"  \"I wish we could catch the rascal,\" muttered Tom.  \"Supposing we climb the mountain from the outside?\" suggested Sam. \"It is a perfectly clear day and is early yet. We'll know enough to look out for pitfalls. If we can catch this Dangler the three of us ought to be able to manage him.\"  \"If we are going to try anything like that we want to hurry,\" returned Dick. \"He won't remain in this locality long--now he knows he is discovered.\"  \"Maybe he thinks we didn't see him,\" came from Tom.  \"Well, that will be in our favor. But he'll know somebody will be after him, for throwing down the dirt and stones.\"  Having eaten a hasty lunch and washed it down with water from a nearby spring, the three lads began the ascent of the mountain. This was hard work and caused them to perspire freely.  \"I'm glad I'm not fat,\" said Tom. \"If I was I'd be winded sure.\"  \"I think we'd better keep quiet as soon as we reach the vicinity of the holes,\" cautioned Dick.  Half an hour of hard climbing brought the boys to the vicinity where they had first fallen into the holes leading to the cave, and then they advanced cautiously and in almost absolute silence. They stopped to listen several times, but heard nothing but the calls of some birds and the trickling of water over the rocks.  Arriving at the top of the hole from where the dirt and stones had been thrown, they gazed around with interest. Where the soil was soft they could see the footprints of shoes much larger than those they themselves wore.  \"Here is his trail, going away,\" said Dick, after a close examination.  \"There is your tin box!\" cried Sam, pointing to the object, still dangling from a distant tree.  \"Wait till I see what is in it,\" answered his big brother. \"It won't take but a minute or two.\"  \"Beware of holes!\" cautioned Tom.  Feeling his way through the brushwood, Dick approached the dangling tin box. It was a small affair and now hung open. He felt certain in his mind that when he had seen it before it had been closed.  The box proved to be empty and Dick was, somehow, disappointed. He glanced on the ground and saw a number of bits of paper, some old looking and some new. He picked up some of the bits and saw they had been written on in pencil, but the words or parts of words were undecipherable.  \"Well, what do you make of it?\" questioned Sam, as he and Tom came up.  \"I think I know what this is,\" answered Dick.  \"What?\"  \"A sort of a private post-office. Somebody was in the habit of leaving messages here, and Dangler or somebody else got the messages from time to time.\"     CHAPTER VIII  LAST DAYS ON THE FARM   \"I believe you are right,\" said Tom, after he, too, had looked over some of the bits of paper strewn around. \"Here is the word 'box' and here is the word 'Saturday.'\"  \"Yes, and here are the words, 'fast freight,'\" added Sam. \"This was nothing more than a letter box for the freight thieves.\"  \"But why was it placed here?\" questioned Dick. \"It's a very out-of-the-way place and hard to get to.\"  \"Maybe somebody had to come this way,\" answered Tom. \"See, here is something of a trail.\"  \"Yes, and here are those same big footprints!\" exclaimed Sam. \"For all we know they may lead to some house or hut on the mountainside.\"  Having picked up the majority of the bits of paper and put them in their pockets for future examination, the three Rover boys followed the path or trail they had discovered. It led along the mountainside to where there was a small clearing, backed up by a series of rocks from which a spring gushed forth, sparkling brightly in the sunshine.  \"I'd like to get another drink,\" said Sam; \"I am terribly thirsty to-day.\"  \"Wait!\" warned Dick, and caught his youngest brother by the arm.  \"What's up, Dick?\"  \"I see a log cabin--over yonder, among the trees.\"  \"Yes, and I see Dangler!\" yelled Tom, suddenly. \"There he goes, with a big bundle over his shoulder!\" And he pointed to the rear of the log cabin. A man was just disappearing behind a fringe of brushwood. The bundle he carried appeared to be tied up in a horse blanket. He was running as hard as he could.  For a moment the boys did not know what to do. Then they ran to the cabin and entered. It contained but one room, and this they soon discovered was deserted. In the chimney a fire was smouldering, and the remains of a meal lay scattered over a box that did duty as a table.  \"This must have been Dangler's hangout,\" was Dick's comment. \"He must have come back for his things.\"  \"Yes, and this explains why the queer letter box was stationed back there,\" said Tom.  \"Aren't you going to try to catch him?\" asked Sam, impatiently.  \"To be sure,\" answered Dick, and rushed out, and the others after him.  \"Keep back there!\" they heard Dangler cry, as they appeared on the trail back of the log cabin. \"Keep back, or it will be the worse for you!\"  \"Stop!\" called Dick. \"You might as well give up Dangler; you are bound to be caught some time.\"  \"Not much! I am armed and I warn you to keep back,\" answered the freight thief, and then a bend of the trail hid him from view.  \"Do you think he'd dare to shoot?\" asked Tom.  \"There is no telling what a desperate man will do,\" replied Dick. \"We had better be cautious.\"  After that they advanced with care. Presently the trail came out on a mountain road and this passed over some rocks and crossed two other roads. They saw no more of Dangler, and the footprints had disappeared.  \"He has slipped us,\" said Tom, coming to a halt and resting on a fallen tree. \"Hang the luck anyway!\"  \"He came back to the cabin for his things,\" mused Sam. \"I guess he is going to leave the neighborhood, and maybe for good.\"  Chagrined over their failure to catch the freight thief, the boys looked around that neighborhood for awhile and then retraced their steps to the log cabin. Here they found several old articles of wearing apparel and a few newspapers.  \"Here is an envelope,\" said Sam, fishing the object out from behind the box that had done duty as a table. \"It is addressed to William Dangler. Must have been some letter he got.\"  \"Anything in it?\"  \"No.\"  \"What is the postmark?\"  \"It is almost blurred out,\" said Sam. He took the envelope to the light. \"Well, I declare! Ithaca!\"  \"Ithaca!\" cried Tom.  \"Why, that's the city we stop at to take the boat for Putnam Hall,\" exclaimed Dick.  \"I know it.\"  \"This is interesting, to say the least,\" was the comment of the oldest Rover boy. \"Wonder if Dangler has friends or confederates in Ithaca?\"  \"We must notify the police of this,\" said Tom. \"And the sooner the better.\"  Satisfied that they could learn nothing more by remaining around the log cabin, the boys departed, and inside of an hour were on their buckboard and bound for the farm. From that place they called up the authorities and informed them of what they had learned. Another search was at once instituted for Bill Dangler, but the rascal was not captured.  The next day Mr. Anderson Rover came home, and the boys and Randolph Rover had to acquaint him with all that had taken place. He shook his head when he heard of the unregistered bonds.  \"I am afraid you will never see them again, Randolph,\" he said to his brother.  \"I am afraid so myself,\" was the mournful reply.  Anderson Rover had come home to see his boys off to school.  \"I want you to make the most of your opportunities while at Putnam Hall this term,\" he said, \"for it is to be your last.\"  \"Yes, I know that,\" answered Tom. \"But after that, what?\"  \"We will talk that over later, Tom. You must either go to college or get ready to go into business.\"  \"I'd like to go to college!\" put in Dick.  \"So would I--if I knew what kind of a place it was,\" added Tom.  \"If it was as fine a place as Putnam Hall I'd jump at it,\" came from Sam.  The next few days flew by quickly. During that time Dick received a letter from Dan Baxter, the former bully of Putnam Hall, which interested him not a little. This letter ran, in part, as follows:  \"I am glad to say that I am now doing fairly well. I tried several positions and am now a traveling salesman for a large carpet house. I get fifteen dollars per week, all my expenses, and a commission on sales, so I consider myself lucky.  \"When I look back on what I once was, Dick, I can scarcely realize what a change has come. But I feel happier than I ever was, and I am in hopes that I shall live to make a man of myself yet. I am trying to give up all my bad habits, and I haven't smoked, or drank a glass of liquor, since I left you in the south.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"That's the kind of a letter I like to get,\" said Dick, as he let his brothers peruse the communication. \"It does a fellow's heart good, doesn't it?\"  \"I am glad we let him have that hundred dollars,\" said Sam. \"Do you think he'll pay it back?\"  \"Here is a postscript in which he says he will send a money order next week.\"  \"He certainly means to pull himself"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22163"],["title","The Rover Boys on the Farm; or, Last Days at Putnam Hall (#7)"],["body","ether,\" said Tom. \"Well, now he has turned over a new leaf, I wish him the best of luck.\"  Almost before they knew it, it was time to leave the farm and journey to Putnam Hall. Everybody was sorry to see them go.  \"I can't abide yo' boys being away nohow!\" wailed Aleck Pop. \"It jess don't seem natural to have yo' gone, dat's wot it don't!\"  \"Oh, we'll be back some day, Aleck,\" answered Dick. \"And if we go off on some trip later, maybe we'll take you along.\"  \"I most wish I was a waiter ag'in at de Hall,\" sighed the colored man.  \"They can't spare you from here,\" said Sam.  \"Oh, I know dat, Sam.\"  The boys' trunks had been packed and sent on ahead, so all they carried with them were their dress-suit cases. Their father drove them to the railroad station at Oak Run, and their aunt and uncle and the others around the farm came out on the piazza to see them off.  \"Now be good boys,\" admonished their Aunt Martha. \"And take care and don't get sick.\"  \"And be sure and study all you can,\" said their Uncle Randolph. \"Remember nothing is quite so grand as learning in this world.\"  \"Yo' keep out ob mischief!\" cried Aleck Pop, shaking a warning finger at Tom, who grinned broadly.  And then the carriage started off, and the journey to Putnam Hall was begun.     CHAPTER IX  AT THE WILD WEST SHOW   As my old readers know, Putnam Hall was located not far from the village of Cedarville on Cayuga Lake. To get to the school the boys had to take a train to Ithaca and then board a little lake steamer stopping at Cedarville and various other points along the shore.  \"It seems a long time since we were at the Hall,\" observed Dick, as they settled down in the train.  \"And what a lot of things have happened since then!\" exclaimed Sam. \"I can tell you what, we'll have a story to tell to the others, won't we?\"  \"I guess Songbird, Fred, and Hans Mueller have already told everything,\" returned Tom. \"More than likely Songbird has concocted some verses about it.\"  The run to Ithaca took several hours, and they lunched at noon in the dining car. It was a beautiful day, and the boys enjoyed the scenery as much as if they had never seen it before.  \"I hope we can make a good connection for Cedarville,\" said Sam as they left the train and started for the dock from which the _Golden Star_ made her trips on the lake. But they were doomed to disappointment, the steamboat had had a break-down and would be delayed two hours or more.  As there was nothing to do but to wait, the boys checked their dress-suit cases and then started for a stroll through the city. They soon learned that a wild west show was giving an exhibition there and consequently the place was crowded with folks from the surrounding districts.  \"I shouldn't mind going to the wild west show,\" observed Tom. \"Do you think we have time?\"  \"We could spend an hour there anyway,\" answered Sam.  \"It depends on where the show is to be held,\" came from Dick.  They soon ascertained that the show grounds were not far off, and made their way thither. The exhibition had already started, and they got inside the big tent-like enclosure as speedily as possible.  The show was a fairly good one, and the boys thoroughly enjoyed the trick riding by cowboys, and the fancy rifle shooting. Then came some wild riding by real Indians.  \"Almost makes a fellow feel as if he'd like to be on a horse himself,\" said Tom. He liked horseback riding very well.  \"Say, I want you to look over there,\" said Sam, pointing to the seats some distance away. \"Do you see that man sitting near the bottom--right beside that boy with the basket of peanuts?\"  Tom and Dick looked in the direction pointed out, and the eldest Rover gave a start.  \"Sam, do you think it is the fellow called Merrick?\" he exclaimed.  \"Doesn't he look like it?\"  \"He certainly does--now you speak of it,\" came from Tom. \"And, by the way, don't you remember about that envelope picked up in the log cabin? It was postmarked Ithaca.\"  \"So it was! Perhaps this Merrick lives here.\"  \"Let us go over and get a closer look at him,\" said Dick, and left his seat, followed by the others.  There was a large crowd, so they had some difficulty in making their way to where the man was located. In his haste, Dick bumped against a waiter selling lemonade and spilled the contents of two glasses on the ground.  \"Excuse me,\" he said.  \"Hi! you've got to pay for the lemonade,\" roared the waiter, angrily. \"You pay up, you clumsy clown!\"  \"See here, my man, I'll pay you, but I want you to understand you can't call me a clown,\" said Dick, angrily.  \"Ah! go on wid yer! Pay up, see?\"  \"Here's your money,\" and Dick held out ten cents. \"Now, am I a clown or not?\"  \"Well, er----\"  \"Am I or not?\" And the eldest Rover boy doubled up his fists. He knew he must \"take the bull by the horns\" with such an individual as that before him.  \"Excuse me,\" mumbled the fellow and moved away. \"I--er--suppose yer couldn't help it.\"  Sam and Tom had gone ahead and they were now close to the man they took to be Merrick.  \"No mistake here!\" declared Sam, as he got a good, square look at the fellow's face.  \"He sees us!\" exclaimed Tom, a second later. \"He is trying to get away.\"  The boy was right, Merrick had seen them. He was greatly amazed, for he had not dreamed of their being in that vicinity. He left his seat in a hurry, and, elbowing his way through the crowd, started for the entrance to the big tent-like enclosure.  By this time Dick was coming up and Sam and Tom quickly acquainted him with what was going on. All three of the Rovers pushed through the big crowd after Merrick, but, before they could draw near, the rascal was outside and running between a number of carriages and wagons standing in that vicinity.  \"Come on after him!\" cried Tom. \"We must capture him if we can!\"  They set off on a smart run, but Merrick could run also, and fear now lent speed to his flying feet. On and on went the swindler, with the Rover boys less than a square behind him. Then, as they came to a number of tall buildings, Merrick darted around a corner and out of sight.  When the Rover boys reached the corner they looked in every direction for the man. Only a few people were about, the majority of the town folks being at the show.  \"Wonder if he went straight on, or took to some side street?\" mused Dick.  \"I'll go straight on,\" said Sam. \"Dick, you can take one side street and Tom can take the other,\" and away went the youngest Rover, at a fresh burst of speed.  Sam's advice was considered good, and soon all of the boys had scattered. The street Tom followed was lined with tall tenements and ended in little more than an alleyway.  Coming to another corner, Tom paused and gazed in all directions. As he turned his head he saw a man look out from a tenement doorway. Then the head was drawn back quickly.  \"Merrick!\" muttered Tom to himself, and turned back to the tenement, which was a building four stories high. On one side was something of an alleyway and beyond were other tenements, and the rear of a big building used for a factory and offices.  Tom found the front door of the tenement wide open and he did not hesitate to go in. Nobody was in sight, but he heard hasty footsteps on the floor above.  \"Merrick! you might as well give up!\" he called out. \"Come down here!\"  \"Go on about your business, young fellow!\" came the reply. \"If you try to follow me you'll get the worst of it.\"  Undaunted by this threat, Tom mounted the stairs two steps at a time. As he did so he heard Merrick go up a second flight and then a third.  \"Must think he can hide on the roof,\" thought Tom. \"Well, I'll corner him if I can.\"  As Tom ran through the hallway on the third floor a door opened and an old woman confronted him.  \"What do yez want here?\" she demanded, in strong Irish accents.  \"I am after a thief,\" answered Tom.  \"A thafe! Sure an' there's no thafe in this house.\"  \"He just ran in here from the street.\"  \"Bedad, is that true now? Where did he go to?\"  \"I don't know. How do you get to the roof?\"  \"Be the laddher at the back av the hall.\"  The old woman pointed in the direction, and Tom sped on. Soon he reached a common wooden ladder leading to a scuttle, which was wide open. As the youth mounted the ladder the scuttle was banged shut, almost hitting him on the top of the head. Then he heard hasty footsteps across the roof.  \"Maybe he thinks he can jump to one of the other buildings,\" said Tom to himself. \"Well, if he can do it, so can I.\"  He pushed the scuttle up with difficulty, for it was heavy. Then with caution, for he did not want to receive a kick in the head, he gazed around the roof of the tenement. Nobody was in sight.  With caution Tom stepped out on the roof. A number of chimneys were not far off, and he wondered if Merrick was concealed behind them.  \"I wish I had a club or something,\" he thought. \"I'd have a tough time of it up here, if it came to a hand-to-hand struggle.\"  With eyes on the alert, Tom made his way to one chimney and then another. The swindler was not there, nor was he on the adjoining roof. Then the youth got down on his hands and knees and looked over the edge of the tenement, on the alleyway side. Here was an iron fire escape, running from the fourth story to the second. On the fire escape he saw Merrick, descending to the bottom with all possible rapidity.     CHAPTER X  JOLLY OLD SCHOOLMATES   Evidently the swindler had dropped from the roof to the upper landing of the fire escape. He was now almost to the bottom.  \"Stop!\" cried Tom, but he knew the command was a useless one. At the sound of his voice Merrick looked up and muttered something the boy could not catch. Then he swung himself from the bottom landing of the fire escape and dropped to the ground.  \"If he can get down that way, so can I,\" thought Tom, and in another moment he was descending the escape in the same fashion as the swindler had done. As he reached the second landing of the escape he saw Merrick turn the corner of the alleyway"]]]
