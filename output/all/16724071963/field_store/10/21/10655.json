They are pretty lonely now that our dads are over in France.\"  \"Oh, I'm going home myself first. But we can have at least three weeks up there, because the school is going to be closed more than a month before and after Christmas.\"  Gif's announcement was such a pleasing one that the Rovers found it hard work after that to settle down to their studies. Letters were at once written to their mothers, and presently word came back that they might go to the camp immediately after Christmas if they wanted to do so. Then Jack telephoned to his sister at Clearwater Hall and got word back that Ruth and May would go down to New York with Mary and Martha and remain there until it was time to return to the girls' school.  \"It's too bad we can't be at home while the girls are there,\" remarked Jack to his cousins. He sighed deeply.  \"You mean it's too bad you can't be there while Ruth is there,\" put in Andy slyly.  \"That's the time you struck the nail on the head!\" cried Randy.  \"Humph! you needn't rap me about it,\" returned the young captain briefly. \"I guess you'd like to see the girls yourselves.\"  Now that they knew what they were going to do during the midwinter holidays, the Rover boys and their chums were eager to have the school session come to an end. But they did not neglect their studies, nor did Jack and Fred neglect their duties as officers.  Jack had an essay to write on \"The Real Training of a Soldier,\" and he spent a great deal of time over this.  \"Not but what there is a good deal about it that I don't know,\" said Jack to his cousins. \"I guess dad could write a better essay than I can turn out. He's seen some of the real side of a soldier's life.\"  \"What wonderful things our dads will have to tell when they get back,\" said Fred. \"That is, if they ever do get back,\" he added anxiously.  \"Oh, they've got to come back, Fred! They've simply got to!\" returned Jack. But his face, too, showed his worry. The Rover boys did not care to admit it to each other, yet each day every one of them worried over their parents. It was dreadful to think that one's father, or one's beloved uncle, might be killed by the Germans, or even badly wounded.  On the Saturday following the bobsled contest the boys assembled once more on the long Hill, and this time they were accompanied by many of the girls from Clearwater Hall. Jack and his cousins gave Ruth and the others many rides down the hill, much to their mutual delight.  \"Here comes Bill Glutts with his _Yellow Streak_,\" cried Fred presently.  \"Here's a chance to have another race with him, Jack,\" said Fatty Hendry. \"He says you won the other race by a foul.\"  \"That's the talk, Jack!\" cried Dan Soppinger. \"Show him and the whole crowd that you beat him fairly.\"  At first Jack did not care to pit himself again against Glutts. But there was so much talk that at length he consented, but insisted upon it that the whole course of the slide must be policed by the cadets.  \"All right, we'll do that,\" said Major Ralph Mason, and then ordered all the cadets he could collect to station themselves on each side of the slide from the top to where it ran out on the lake.  \"Oh, Jack, I hope you do win again!\" said Ruth anxiously.  \"I intend to do my best,\" he answered.  \"You have got to win, Jack Rover!\" cried his sister Martha. \"If you don't beat that great big clumsy Glutts, I'll never speak to you again.\"  With so many cadets stationed along the course, Bill Glutts felt that his chances of winning the race were diminishing. He had thought that he could crowd Jack as he had done before, but now Walt Baxter laid down the law in such a manner that it could not be misunderstood.  \"I will toss up a coin,\" said Walt, \"and if you guess right, Glutts, you can take your choice of sides, and whichever side you or Jack Rover select, that side you must stick to from start to finish.\"  The coin was tossed up, and Bill Glutts called out \"tails\" and won. Then he said he would take the right side of the slide, that which Jack Rover and his chums had previously used.  \"All right, then, Glutts,\" announced Walt. \"Now then, remember that you have got to keep to the right all the way down; and you, Jack Rover, must keep to the left. If either of you crosses the middle of the course, that one will be disqualified and the race will be given to the other.\"  \"All right, Walt, I will stick to the left from start to finish; just watch me and see,\" declared Jack.  \"And I'll stick to the right,\" announced Bill Glutts. But his face showed anything but a happy expression as he spoke.  Jack had the same crowd on board that he had before, but Glutts made several changes. He retained Nick Carncross and Codfish, but for the other three cadets substituted youths who were slightly built, and consequently rather light in weight.  \"He's saving all the pounds he can,\" whispered Randy.  \"Jack, do you think the right side of the course is better than the left?\" questioned Gif.  \"I don't know. One looks about as good as the other to me,\" was the young captain's reply.  Professor Frank Grawson had come up and was quite interested in the proposed contest.  \"I used to do a lot of bobsledding myself,\" said the professor, who was well liked by nearly all the cadets. \"I used to have a home-made sled which was my pride for several seasons. Now, to make this more interesting, I'll put up a prize for the winner.\"  \"Fine, Professor! Fine!\" was the cry.  \"What's the prize?\"  The teacher thought for a moment.  \"Well, every boy likes a good pocket knife,\" he said presently. \"Now, to the one who wins this race I'll give a first-class, four-bladed, buck-handled knife. I saw some very good ones down in the hardware store at the Point, and I'll get one Monday.\"  \"That's splendid, Professor!\" cried Jack. \"I'll do my best to win that knife.\"  \"You'll see that knife coming to me!\" exclaimed Bill Glutts, glaring at the young captain.  Walt Baxter now called for the contestants to get ready. In a minute more the two bobsleds stood side by side, each with its load of passengers, and with Fred ready to push one to the front and Nick Carncross ready to shove the other.  \"All ready!\" shouted Walt. \"One--two--three! Go!\"  And away both bobsleds dashed, and the great race was on.     CHAPTER V  THE DEFEAT OF THE BULLY   \"Go ahead, Jack! You've got to win!\"  \"Don't let 'em beat you, Bill. Put it all over those Rovers.\"  \"Oh, Jack, don't let them get the best of you!\" cried Ruth.  \"You've got to win!\" screamed Martha.  \"Here is where Glutts shows 'em what the _Yellow Streak_ can do!\"  So the cries ran on as the two bobsleds slowly gathered momentum and started down the long slope leading to Clearwater Lake.  At the beginning Glutts had a little the better of it, because the right side of the slide seemed to be more slippery than the other. He was the first to gain the top of the nearest rise and he shot over this while Jack's bobsled was still climbing the slope.  \"Hurrah! Bill Glutts is ahead!\"  \"He said the _Yellow Streak_ could beat any thing in this vicinity.\"  \"Oh, do you really think Glutts will win?\" questioned Ruth anxiously, as she turned to Dan Soppinger.  \"Well, I should hope not!\" answered Dan.  \"If he does win there will be no holding him down,\" put in Ned Lowe, another chum of the Rovers. \"He'll crow to beat the band all winter.\"  Forward went the two bobsleds, each steersman doing his best to guide his sled where running might be the easiest.  Just as Jack topped the first rise and started to speed down on the other side, he saw Bill Glutts start to resume his old tactics. The bully was running close to the center of the course, and now he overlapped the other side by at least six inches.  \"Hi, there, Glutts! Get over on your side!\" yelled one of the cadets who was helping to police the course.  \"That's right, Bill. Get over, or you'll be disqualified,\" added another.  \"Keep to the right! Keep to the right!\" was the cry from several others. And then, knowing that the eyes of all the cadets in that vicinity were upon him, the bully slowly steered over to his side of the course. And he was not any too quick, for otherwise there might have been a serious disaster. Down the slope of the first hill rushed the _Blue Moon_. Jack was on his side, but had not more than six inches to spare. Had Glutts kept on as he was running the _Blue Moon_ would have sideswiped the _Yellow Streak_, and there would undoubtedly have been a serious accident.  \"Here comes the _Blue Moon_!\"  \"Say, but they are gathering some speed!\"  \"Hurrah, the Rovers are ahead!\"  \"Go on, Glutts! Go on! Don't let 'em beat you!\"  It was true that the _Blue Moon_ was now ahead and was slowly but surely increasing the distance between the Rovers and those aboard the _Yellow Streak_.  \"Push her ahead, Bill! Push her ahead!\" yelled Nick Carncross desperately.  \"We've got to win!\" cried Codfish.  \"I'm doing the best I can,\" muttered Bill Glutts between his set teeth, and his eyes glowed with hatred as he saw the _Blue Moon_ vanishing over the second rise of the course.  After that, as Fatty Hendry remarked, \"it was all over but the shouting.\" Down toward the highway skirting the lake shot the _Blue Moon_. Then it ran swiftly along the final lap of the course and came out on Clearwater Lake, shooting several hundred feet beyond the finishing mark. The line was crossed while the _Yellow Streak_ was still on the roadway beyond the lake shore.  [Illustration: DOWN TOWARD THE HIGHWAY SHOT THE _BLUE MOON_.]  \"Hurrah! The _Blue Moon_ wins!\"  \"My, but that was some run, believe me!\"  \"What will Bill Glutts have to say now?\"  \"He can't say this wasn't a fair race.\"  The run for the _Blue Moon_ had certainly been a swift one, and while Jack was congratulated on his victory, he was also praised for the way in which he had handled his speedy bobsled.  \"We certainly came down fast,\" remarked Randy. \"I thought my ears were going to blow right"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22012"],["title","The Rover Boys on a Hunt; or, The Mysterious House in the Woods (#5)"],["body","my head,\" and this remark caused a general laugh.  Glutts had finished the race twelve seconds behind his opponent and was in anything but a happy frame of mind.  \"There were a number of sticks and stones on my side of the slide, and they held us back,\" he protested lamely. \"I guess some of the fellows who didn't want to see the _Yellow Streak_ win put 'em there.\"  \"I can't believe that, Glutts,\" answered Major Mason flatly. \"I looked over the course, and it was just as clear on one side as it was on the other.\"  \"Don't be a sorehead, Bill, just because you lost,\" put in Fatty Hendry. \"Be a good sport and shake hands with Jack over your defeat.\"  \"I'll do as I please,\" roared the bully. \"I don't need any advice from you. You fellows are all against me.\" And with this remark he turned his back on the crowd, and soon he and his cronies were making their way up along the lake shore, dragging the _Yellow Streak_ behind them.  \"It was a well won race, Captain Rover,\" said Professor Grawson. \"You can be proud of being the possessor of such a speedy bobsled. On Monday I shall take great pleasure in getting that knife for you.\"  \"Thank you, Professor. And I'll take great pleasure in accepting the knife,\" said Jack, with a grin.  \"Well, that's the time you squared up with Bill Glutts,\" remarked Spouter, after the fun on Long Hill had come to an end and the boys had said good-bye to the girls and were on the return to Colby Hall. \"You certainly paid him back for shoving you into that snowbank.\"  \"I don't know whether I did or not,\" answered the young captain. \"Evidently Glutts doesn't know when he's had enough. I suppose he'll be more bitter now than ever against me.\"  \"Oh, I wouldn't worry about Glutts,\" put in Gif. \"He's nothing but a great big overgrown butcher boy.\" He said this because it was a well-known fact that Bill Glutts was the only son of a wholesale butcher who had made a small fortune in manufacturing and selling frankfurters.  \"I don't see how a fellow like Nick Carncross can take up with him,\" remarked Fatty Hendry.  \"I know why he does that,\" came from Ned Lowe. \"Bill has had plenty of money to spend lately--an uncle or somebody sent him quite a wad--and Nick's pocketbook, I imagine, is rather thin.\"  \"Say, Ned, come around to our rooms to-night and give us some music just to celebrate this glorious event!\" cried Fred, for Ned Lowe was quite a performer on the mandolin and usually had some very funny songs to sing.  \"All right, I'll be glad to come,\" answered the mandolin player. \"Any eats?\"  \"Oh, maybe we can scrape up something,\" answered Randy. The idea of a little spread on the quiet appealed to him.  The idea of a little spread appealed to the others, too, and as a consequence it was arranged between the Rovers and their chums that two of them should go to Haven Point for some things for the spread. This task was delegated to Andy and Fred, and they hurried off early in the evening, returning with several packages containing sandwiches, cake, candy, nuts and a large hand of bananas. In the meantime, the other Rover boys and Ned Lowe had gathered in Gif Garrison's room, and there enjoyed themselves singing and listening to Ned's playing of the mandolin.  As soon as the monitors had gone their rounds to see that everything was quiet for the night, Spouter, Gif, Fatty, Ned, Dan, Walt and several others found their way to the Rover boys' suite.  \"Now, don't make too much noise,\" admonished Fred, who let them in. \"Remember Bill Glutts and his gang will be only too glad to find out what is going on and report us.\"  \"And we don't want to get any black marks when it's so near the end of the term,\" added Jack.  \"Right-o,\" came from Andy.  The new arrivals proceeded to make themselves at home, and then the Rovers passed around the good things which had been obtained.  \"Say, this is all right,\" declared Walt, munching a tongue sandwich.  \"Couldn't be beat,\" came from Gif, who had his mouth full of layer cake.  \"Here, Fatty, have some nuts!\" cried Andy gayly, and let several almonds slide down the fat youth's collar.  \"Hi, there! Let up!\" cried Fatty. \"I don't eat nuts that way,\" and he made a pass at Andy with a pillow.  \"No horseplay, now! Cut it out, Andy,\" warned Jack.  After that the cadets conversed in low tones and at the same time enjoyed the many good things to eat.  \"What are you going to do with those banana skins, Andy?\" questioned his twin, as he saw the youth place several of the skins in a bit of newspaper.  \"Oh, I've got a plan to use them,\" was the answer.  \"Well, if there is any fun on foot, let me in on it,\" went on Randy promptly.  \"I was thinking we might send some of these good things over to Bill Glutts, Codfish and Nick Carncross,\" went on the fun-loving Rover. \"It might make 'em feel better over their defeat.\"  \"What! Give up some of these good eats to them?\" demanded Fred.  \"Well, I don't know whether they would be very good eats or not,\" answered Andy, closing one eye suggestively. \"Do you see what I've got in this little package?\" he went on, bringing a small paper bag from his pocket. \"Smell it.\"  Fred did so, but with caution. Then he gave a sudden sneeze.  \"Cayenne pepper!\"  \"Right you are, Freddie boy! How did you guess it?\" and Andy grinned broadly.  \"Say, that's the talk!\" burst out Randy. \"Let's send them over a few sandwiches and a couple of slices of cake, all well doctored with cayenne pepper.\"  \"They'll be suspicious, especially if you take them over,\" remarked Jack. \"We ought to get some outsider to do the job.\"  \"I'll do it if you want me too,\" responded Walt Baxter promptly. \"I don't love those chaps any more than you do. You just fix up some sandwiches and the cake, and I'll go around and explain that Dan and Ned and Fatty, and some of the rest of us, are giving the Rovers a little spread in honor of the victory and that we don't think it any more than right that they should have some of the good things.\"  So it was decided, and a little while later the cover of a pasteboard box was fixed up as a tray, containing several tempting looking sandwiches, some slices of layer cake, and two bananas. Then Walt Baxter marched off with the things in the direction of the room occupied by Bill Glutts.  \"Come on and listen to what happens,\" said Andy, and presently, having slipped off their shoes, he and the others followed Walt down the corridor, but kept well in the background.  When Baxter arrived at Bill Glutts' room he heard low voices, and was much pleased to learn that Glutts was talking to Nick Carncross. When he knocked lightly on the door there was an uneasy stir within.  \"Maybe it's one of the monitors come back,\" whispered Carncross uneasily.  \"Who is there?\" questioned Glutts sharply.  \"It's I--Walt Baxter,\" was the answer. \"Open the door, Glutts. I've got something good for you fellows.\"  The door was opened cautiously, and Walt explained his errand, at the same time holding out the improvised tray.  \"I don't know that we want anything,\" said Glutts rather sourly.  \"Oh, well, we might as well take it,\" put in Carncross hastily. He was a growing cadet, and always hungry.  \"We'd like to have Codfish have some of this, too,\" said Walt. \"Will you see that he gets some?\"  \"Sure!\" answered Carncross readily. \"He's right across the hall. I'll call him.\"  In a few minutes more Codfish came from his room clad in his pajamas and slippers. He sneaked over into the room occupied by Glutts and Carncross, and then the three began dividing the things Walt had brought for them.  \"I'll have to go now,\" said Walt hastily. \"Remember, this is with regards from our whole crowd,\" he added significantly.  \"Thanks,\" muttered Carncross briefly, while Glutts and Codfish said nothing.  Then the bully closed the door and he and his cronies prepared to enjoy the things which had been brought to them.     CHAPTER VI  AT THE MOVING PICTURE THEATRE   \"There'll be something doing in a minute or two,\" murmured Randy, as he and the others came to a halt before Bill Glutts' door.  \"You fellows be careful and don't step on any of these,\" whispered Andy, as he bent down and laid the banana skins he had saved on the floor. \"Splendid doormat for them when they come out,\" he added, grinning.  Fortunately, those within the room were so busy dividing the sandwiches and cake that they paid no attention to what was going on outside.  \"Rather nice of them to remember us,\" remarked Codfish. \"Thank you, I don't think I care for any sandwiches, but I'll take that piece of cake instead.\"  \"Me for a sandwich, Bill,\" murmured Carncross. \"I'm quite hungry.\"  Then the three began to munch away on the sandwiches and the cake at a lively rate.  All had their mouths full when suddenly Codfish began to splutter.  \"Hello! what's the matter?\" cried Glutts. \"Trying to swallow too much at once?\"  \"You don't want to make a pig of yourself, Codfish,\" admonished Carncross.  \"Oh! Oh!\" cried the sneak of the school. \"Oh!\"  \"What's wrong?\"  \"Oh, I'm burning up! Oh, they must have poisoned me!\"  \"Gee! do you suppose they put something in that cake?\" cried Carncross, in sudden alarm.  \"Oh, my mouth is on fire!\" groaned Codfish.  To this neither Glutts nor Carncross made any answer. Each was beginning to feel a sudden strange sensation on his tongue and in his throat. Both began to feel as if their mouths were burning up.  \"It's something they've put in the eats!\" exclaimed Glutts. \"They're trying to poison us, or something!\"  \"It's pepper! That's what it is--cayenne pepper!\" came from Codfish. \"Oh, give me a drink of water, or something! This is dreadful!\"  The sneak made a dash across the room to where a water pitcher stood on a stand with a glass beside it. But the pitcher proved to be empty.  \"My gracious, this is terrible!\" spluttered Carncross, and began to cough.  In the meantime Glutts smelled of the food that remained on the improvised tray, and suddenly gave a loud sneeze, followed by several others.  \"Hurrah! they are"]]]
