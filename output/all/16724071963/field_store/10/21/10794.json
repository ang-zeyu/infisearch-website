Ross picked up the terrier and heaved him into the boat. Rex gave a snort of satisfaction, shook himself so that he sent a trundling spray of water clear in his master's face and then took his post in the bow of the boat and set himself to barking with all his might and main. It seemed almost as though he really knew that he was at the head of a rescue expedition and wanted to convey the information. When at last Rex ceased barking, which was not for some minutes, Ross gave a shout.  Instantly, at one of the upper windows, something white appeared. In the darkness the boy could not tell what it might be, but he guessed, and rightly, that it was Anton's shirt, and he heard again, though faintly, the answering call across the river.  \"Keep up your nerve, Anton,\" he yelled, through the storm, \"I'll be over there in a minute.\"  Faintly, again, came the answering cry,  \"Hello, Ross! Is that you? I wondered who it was that was coming.\"  The slow progress made by shoving the boat along, however, was not at all to Rex's liking. He turned and looked at his master doubtfully, then barked again. To his disgust, in turn, the boy found that the slope of the hollow curved away from the house a great deal. He was tempted, time after time, to jump into the boat and pull straight across, but he knew that if the force of the current drifted him below the house, he could never hope to go upstream against it. His only chance was to make sure that he could reach the middle of the torrent above the house and drift right down upon it. A few yards' extra leeway would enable him to steer his cranky craft to the desired spot. So, though it seemed to him as if he were going away from Anton, and though, indeed, he was now so far away that the crippled boy's shouts no longer could be heard, Ross stuck to his intentions, and, still wading, pushed the little craft up-stream.  Rex protested vigorously. He ran back from the bow and looked into Ross's face with a reproachful and almost angry bark, as much as to say:  \"You silly! Can't you tell what I brought you here for?\"  The boy knew better than the dog.  \"Lie down!\" he ordered sharply.  Rex, understanding in a doggish way that he was in the wrong somewhere, went back to his post in the bow, where he stood dejectedly, his tail no longer at the jaunty angle than it had been before.  At last Ross felt that he had reached a point high enough up the flooded bank to justify him in the attempt to get across. He jumped into the home-made skiff, and, setting his strength to the clumsy oars, began to pull with all his might.  He had not over-estimated the force of the current. As the light craft got into the swirl, the black water caught it like a feather. Ross pulled with all his might, but the banks slipped by as though he were in tow of one of the river steamboats. Never had the boy tugged at a pair of oars as he did now, and never had he so wished for a good boat and for real oars. He was only two-thirds of the distance across to the house when it came into sight, only a little distance below him.  He would not reach it!  With the energy of despair, Ross tugged on his oars, every muscle of his body tense with the strain.  Rex, divining the struggle, stood silent, not looking forward over the bow as he had been doing, but watching his master as he toiled with his oars.  Then, out from the darkness, shot the long black menace of a floating tree trunk. Straight for the boat it sped.  From the window, now close at hand, came a cry:  \"Look out, Ross! Look out!\"  Ross saw the danger. He knew, if he backed water, or halted long enough to let the tree go by, he would infallibly be swept past the house and all hope of rescuing Anton would be gone. He saw, too, that if the tree struck the frail boat, it would sink it as a battleship's ram sinks a fishing-boat in a fog at sea. He might win through, but if it struck--  The oars creaked with the sudden strain thrown on them.  On came the tree, but, just as it was about to strike the boat, it checked and turned half over, as the projecting stump of a broken bough caught on the ground below. For an instant, only, the tree halted and began to swing.  The halt gave a moment's respite, one more chance for an extra pull with the oars. The big log, thus poised, made a backwater eddy on the surface of the river, checking the force of the current. Ross reached back for another stroke, with every ounce of his muscle behind it.  The tree turned over sullenly and charged down the river anew. Yet that brief pause, that second of delay, that back-water ripple as the log hung in suspension, had given Ross just the advantage that was needed. The branches of the upper part of the tree swept round, one of them catching the stern of the boat and almost pulling it under. Peril had been near, but victory was nearer. The bow of the boat touched the wall of the house.  The current, swirling around the rocking walls, carried the boat to the lee of the house, and, as it spun round, Ross leaped on to the porch, chest-deep in water, and took a quick turn with the boat's painter around the corner post of the porch.  The torrent took his feet from under him, and swept him down-stream, floating, but Ross held a firm grip on the rope and dragged himself back. There, clasping the post tightly, he got back his breath. After a moment's groping he found the railing of the porch. By standing on this and holding fast to the corner post, he was, for the moment, out of danger.  He had reached the house, but how was Anton to be rescued?  The crippled boy was on the second story and the upper window could not be reached from the boat, even if the boat could have been held in place directly under it. Fortunately, Ross knew the arrangements of his chum's house as well as he did those of his own. Stepping gingerly along the porch railing, he came close to the window of the sitting room. The glass was still in the window frame, but as the front door was swinging wide open, though partly choked with d√©bris, Ross knew that the sitting room must be full of water. He kicked the glass out and then, with a heavier kick, broke away the middle part of the window-sash. The water did not come quite to the top of the window frame, sure evidence that there was room for air between the water and the ceiling.  Taking a long breath, but with his heart knocking against his ribs, Ross dived through the broken window. It is one thing to be able to swim and dive, it is another to plunge through a splintered window-frame into a dark house in the middle of the night, with a flood roaring on all sides.  Was the door into the hall open? On that, success depended.  The boy turned sharply to the left as he came up to the surface and took breath. His hand struck the top of the door jamb. The door was open, but the casing was only three inches above the water. Ross dived again through the door, and, under water, turned to the right. One swimming stroke brought him to the staircase and he rushed up the few steps at the top to the room above.  There, by the light of a single candle, he saw Anton, his eager eyes shining out of his pale face. The crippled boy hobbled across the room on his crutch and grasped his chum tightly by the shoulder. He was trembling like an aspen-leaf in the wind.  \"Scared, Anton?\" said Ross. \"I'm not surprised. You've a good right to be.\"  \"I wasn't so scared,\" the younger lad replied, with the characteristic desire of a boy not to be thought cowardly, \"I just got to wondering, that was all.\"  \"Wondering if any one was going to come for you?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"How did you get left behind, anyhow?\" queried Ross.  \"Oh, it was my own fault, all right,\" the crippled lad replied. \"It was all because of the dog. You know, Ross, Lassie had pups, last Monday.\"  \"No, I didn't know about it,\" responded the older boy. \"Why didn't you tell a fellow?\"  \"I haven't seen you since,\" Anton explained. \"Well, when the levee broke and the water commenced to come into the house, Dad and Uncle Jack went and got the two boats we always keep on the river. Dad picked me up and carried me down on to the porch. I heard him call to Uncle Jack:  \"'You go ahead and get Clara; I've got Anton safe with me.'\"  \"Then you were with him, weren't you?\" queried Ross.  \"Sure I was. Just as I was getting into the boat, though, I thought of Lassie and her puppies and I went back to get them. I called to Dad and said:  \"'I'm just going to fetch Lassie, Dad, and I'll go in Uncle Jack's boat.'  \"So, Dad, he called to Uncle, saying that I was to go with him. His boat was pretty well crowded up, too. Back I went to get Lassie. As soon as I'd picked up the pups, Lassie was willing enough to come along. The water was running over the floor and made it slippery. My crutch slithered on the wet wood and I tumbled down. It was pretty dark, and I had a job finding the four puppies again. When I did gather 'em up and started for the porch again, Uncle Jack was gone.\"  \"Without you?\"  \"He thought I was with Dad, and I suppose Dad was sure I was with Uncle Jack.\"  \"They ought to have found out and come back after you as soon as they got together.\"  \"I thought of that,\" the crippled lad answered, \"and that's what I expected would happen. I suppose, though, they didn't land at the same place, and so each bunch thinks I'm with the other and isn't doing any worrying.\"  \"It's a mighty awkward mix-up,\" declared Ross. \"There's no saying what might have happened to you if Rex hadn't been on the job.\"  \"Was it Rex who brought you here?\"  \"It sure was,\" Ross replied, and he described how the terrier had pulled him by the leg and insisted on his coming over to the house in the hollow.  \"Where's Rex now,\" queried Anton, \"down in our old boat?\"  \"Yes, he's down there, keeping watch, good old scout,\" answered Ross. \"He ought to be satisfied now, he certainly made fuss enough to bring me here. But, look"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22156"],["title","The Boy with the U. S. Weather Men (#3)"],["body","ere, Anton, how are we going to get you out? You don't swim.\"  \"No,\" answered his chum mournfully, \"I can't swim.\"  \"If there was room enough down that stair,\" said Ross, thoughtfully, \"I could take you on my back, but we'd never get through that door, and the window would be even worse.\"  \"I'd been thinking of that,\" Anton answered. \"I wondered how Dad would get me when he found out that I wasn't with Uncle Jack and came for me. So I made a long rope out of strips of my sheets.\"  \"What's the good of that?\"  \"Well,\" said the younger boy, \"I was wondering if I couldn't get out of the window. My arms are awful strong, you know, Ross.\"  \"Yes,\" the other agreed, \"you've plenty of muscle there.\"  \"I thought if I could drop that line out of the window, Dad could grab it and hold the boat there. Then I could chuck down Lassie and the pups in a basket--I've got the basket--and slide down the rope of sheets into the boat.\"  Ross thought for a minute.  \"I don't see why we couldn't do that now,\" he said. \"Suppose we tied a piece of wood to the end of this rope of sheets, so that it would float, the current would curl it around the corner of the house so that I could get hold of it from the boat. If your end of the line was made fast up here, I could hand over hand the boat right under your window, the way you say. Why, I could get you out without any trouble at all! Let's see how it goes.\"  Suiting the action to the word, Ross tied one end of the line of sheets around the hinge of the door, passed it through the window, and, to the other end, tied a spare crutch. Then he leaned out of the window and watched it. The current snatched the crutch down and, as Ross expected, swung it around the corner of the house.  \"Fine,\" said the lad. \"We can work that all right. I'll have you out of here in two shakes, Anton. Where are the pups?\"  Anton pointed to the bed, on which a basket was lying.  \"Aren't they dandies?\" he said.  Ross took the candle over and picked up one of the pups. Lassie growled in a low voice.  \"All right, Lassie,\" said Ross, \"you ought to know me.\"  He bent down and patted her.  The dog smelt his hand and whacked her tail on the floor in token of recognition, but growled again, nevertheless.  \"I won't hurt your pup,\" declared Ross, putting the blind little creature back in the basket.  \"Nicely marked, Anton,\" he said, \"they look great. But we've got to get busy.\"  He went to the head of the staircase and stared down.  \"It doesn't look a bit nice,\" he declared, \"I sort of hate to go through there again.\"  \"Why do you?\" queried Anton. \"You could go down the line and reach the boat that way.\"  \"That's an idea,\" declared Ross thoughtfully, then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said, \"my weight would swing the crutch out clear away from the house. I'd better go down the way I came up. I can always get back, anyway.\"  He ran down the staircase until the water reached to his chest and then struck out. The water had risen slightly, but he got through the door without any trouble. Passing through the window he was not so lucky, for a projecting splinter of glass scraped him as he dived through, making a long but shallow cut in the upper part of his arm.  Rex welcomed him back with short joyful barks.  \"I'm not a bit sure,\" said Ross as he patted the dog, \"whether it was Anton or the pups that you wanted me to rescue, eh? Which was it?\"  For answer Rex only wagged his tail and jumped up on his young master.  \"Down, Rex, down,\" ordered Ross, \"this boat's too cranky for that sort of thing. Now, where's that crutch?\"  In the darkness and the pouring rain it was hard to distinguish anything, but the white gleam of the sheets showed where the crutch was floating.  \"Out of reach,\" muttered Ross in disgust. \"Just my luck! How am I going to get it?\"  It was a problem. The crutch was floating on the current above twelve feet beyond the reach of the boat's painter, let out to its utmost length. By stretching out with one of the oars, Ross was about four feet short. Just four feet, but so far as success was concerned, it might as well have been four miles.  If he jumped from the boat and swam for it, there was always a chance that the current would pluck him down before he could grasp the line, and then he would not only be in danger himself, but he would have lost all chance of saving his crippled friend. As long as he stayed either with the boat or with the house, there was a chance. It would be foolhardy to lose connection with both.  Then a brilliant idea struck him. Suppose he tied the painter of the boat under his arms, loosed the boat from the post and jumped into the water. He ought to reach the floating line before the current had taken up the slack of the boat's painter. If he left loose a long enough end, with a loop knot, he could fasten the rope from the boat to the line of sheets, and the boat would be made fast. The loop knot would unfasten itself and he could easily clamber into the boat, from the stern, since it was fastened to the line coming out from Anton's window. Then he could haul up the boat, hand over hand, as agreed upon, take Anton and the puppies aboard and strike out straight for the shore.  No sooner was the idea conceived than Ross proceeded to put it into action. Slipping the line around his arms, once, he tied a loop knot in front of his chest, where it would be easy to reach, leaving about three feet of rope hanging, untied the painter and shoved off the boat. The instant that the boat felt the current it yawed around, but, at the same moment, Ross jumped out and forward with all his might. The action sent the boat down-stream all the quicker, but in a second's time, Ross had grasped the floating crutch and had taken a turn with the loose end of the rope around it.  He was not an instant too soon, for a sharp tug at his chest, followed by a sudden release of the weight, told him that the loop knot had untied itself, as he hoped it would. Holding on to the sheet line with one hand, he rapidly passed the rope once under and through. Ross had not learned his knots from the Mississippi sailors for nothing, and as the boat came to the end of its tether and jerked on the line, the boy had the satisfaction of seeing the knot tighten. With the strain off, it was easy to take another half-hitch around the line, and the knot was secure beyond peradventure. He climbed aboard, raised a cheery cry to Anton, and commenced to pull the boat hand over hand along the line of sheets. It was only a moment before the little craft was bobbing on the flood, immediately beneath the window.  \"Let's have the puppies first,\" cried Ross.  Anton's head disappeared from the window, and reappeared in a moment.  \"Catch!\" he cried and held out the basket.  Ross balanced himself as best he could and caught the falling basket. It was not more than a five feet drop and the basket landed squarely in his arms. He placed it in the boat. Loud barking overhead announced that Lassie was displeased and worried over the sudden departure of her offspring.  \"How am I going to get Lassie out?\" queried Anton. \"I'd never thought of that. She'll strangle if I let her down by the collar.\"  \"That's easy,\" Ross called back. \"Tie a bit of string to her collar, chuck me the end of the string, and then throw her into the water. It won't hurt her, and I can easily haul her aboard.\"  \"All right, then,\" the other answered, \"get the boat out of the way.\"  \"Chuck me down the end of the string first,\" warned Ross, and, as he spoke, a ball of stout twine fell in the boat. \"Out with her now,\" he continued, slackening away on the line, so that the boat was no longer directly out of the window.  There was a moment's pause and then the big dog appeared in the opening, struggling in Anton's strong, if clumsy, grasp. She clawed at the window-sill, not understanding what was happening, but Anton gave her a push, and half turning as she fell, Lassie struck the water all of a heap. The instant she was afloat, however, her natural swimming instincts asserted themselves and she started for the shore.  \"Here, Lassie!\" called Ross, with a whistle, and pulled gently on the string that was fastened to her collar. The dog felt the pull and turned around, swimming directly for the boat. Ross stooped down and lifted her in. The mother immediately smelt the puppies and scrambled along the bottom of the boat to the basket. She smelt her children, nosed them over, one by one, then, satisfied that everything was all right, muzzled against Rex, and lay down contentedly.  This feat accomplished, Ross pulled the boat under the window again.  \"Now, Anton,\" he called, \"it's your turn.\"  \"All right,\" the younger lad replied, \"I'm coming.\"  Ross heard him drag a chair to the window, to make it easier for him to clamber out.  Just at that instant, there came a cracking from the front of the house, the corner-post of the porch, to which the boat had been fastened less than five minutes before, fell with a crash and the front of the house crumbled. There was a moment's pause, and then the whole structure keeled over, away from the boat, and with a rending and cracking of timbers, broke from its foundation. Over and over it heeled, and it looked as though it would go to pieces. From the window overhead came a scream of terror.  Realizing that Anton could never save himself, if the house were collapsing, Ross leaped for the rope of linen that was hanging out of the window and went up it like a monkey.  The chair on which Anton had climbed, to get out of the window, had slid to the far end of the room and fallen on the sloping floor, the lower edge of which was now in the water, and the crippled lad was pinned down and unable to get out. The candle had been thrown down on the table and fire was beginning to lick some paper that had not slipped to the floor.  Ross dashed in, grabbed Anton by the arm, picked him up with the \"firemen's carry\" and staggered up the sloping floor to the window.  Had"]]]
