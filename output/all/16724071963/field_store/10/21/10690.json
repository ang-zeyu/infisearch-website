Miriam, with her wide, sensitive mouth, her tip-tilted nose, her hazel eyes, her air of some quaint, bright garden flower swaying on its stem, was for war and music, and both her brothers to become generals. \"Or Richard can be the general, and you be a cavalryman like Cousin Fauquier! Richard can fight like Napoleon and you may fight like Ney!\"  The cadet stiffened. \"Thank you for nothing, Missy! Anyhow, I shan't sulk in my tents like your precious Achilles--just for a girl! Richard! 'Old Jack' says--\"  \"I wish, Will,\" murmured his mother, \"that you'd say 'Major Jackson.'\"  The boy laughed. \"'Old Jack' is what we call him, ma'am! The other wouldn't be respectful. He's never 'Major Jackson' except when he's trying to teach natural philosophy. On the drill ground he's 'Old Jack.' Richard, he says--Old Jack says--that not a man since Napoleon has understood the use of cavalry.\"  Cleave, sitting with his eyes upon the portrait of his grandfather, answered dreamily: \"Old Jack is probably in the right of it, Will. Cavalry is a great arm, but I shall choose the artillery.\"  His mother set down her coffee cup with a little noise, Miriam shook her hair out of her eyes and came back from her own dream of the story she was reading, and Will turned as sharply as if he were on the parade ground at Lexington.  \"You don't think, then, that it is just all talk, Richard! You are sure that we're going to fight!\"  \"You fight!\" cried Miriam. \"Why, you aren't sixteen!\"  Will flared up. \"Plenty of soldiers have _died_ at sixteen, Missy! 'Old Jack' knows, if you don't--\"  \"Children, children!\" said Margaret Cleave, in a quivering voice. \"It is enough to know that not a man of this family but would fight now for Virginia, just as they fought eighty odd years ago! Yes, and we women did our part then, and we would do it now! But I pray God, night and day--and Miriam, you should pray too--that this storm will not burst! As for you two who've always been sheltered and fed, who've never had a blow struck you, who've grown like tended plants in a garden--you don't know what war is! It's a great and deep Cup of Trembling! It's a scourge that reaches the backs of all! It's universal destruction--and the gift that the world should pray for is to build in peace! That is true, isn't it, Richard?\"  \"Yes, it is true,\" said Richard. \"Don't, Will,\" as the boy began to speak. \"Don't let's talk any more about it to-night. After all, a deal of storms go by--and it's a wise man who can read Time's order-book.\" He rose from the table. \"It's like the fable. The King may die, the Ass may die, the Philosopher may die--and next Christmas maybe the peacefullest on record! I'm going to ride to Lauderdale for a little while, and, if you like, I'll ask about that shotgun for you.\"  A few minutes later and he was out on the starlit road to Lauderdale. As he rode he thought, not of the Botetourt Resolutions, nor of Fauquier Cary, nor of Allan Gold, nor of the supper table at Three Oaks, nor of a case which he must fight through at the court house three days hence, but of Judith Cary. Dundee's hoofs beat it out on the frosty ground. _Judith Cary--Judith Cary--Judith Cary!_ He thought of Greenwood, of the garden there, of a week last summer, of Maury Stafford--Stafford whom at first meeting he had thought most likable! He did not think him so to-night, there at Silver Hill, ready to go to Lauderdale to-morrow!--_Judith Cary--Judith Cary--Judith Cary._ He saw Stafford beside her--Stafford beside her--Stafford beside her--  \"If she love him,\" said Cleave, half aloud, \"he must be worthy. I will not be so petty nor so bitter! I wish her happiness.--_Judith Cary--Judith Cary._ If she love him--\"  To the left a little stream brawled through frosty meadows; to the right rose a low hill black with cedars. Along the southern horizon stretched the Blue Ridge, a wall of the Titans, a rampart in the night. The line was long and clean; behind it was an effect of light, a steel-like gleaming. Above blazed the winter stars. \"If she love him--if she love him--\" He determined that to-night at Lauderdale he would try to see her alone for a minute. He would find out--he must find out--if there were any doubt he would resolve it.  The air was very still and clear. He heard a carriage before him on the road. It was coming toward him--a horseman, too, evidently riding beside it. Just ahead the road crossed a bridge--not a good place for passing in the night-time. Cleave drew a little aside, reining in Dundee. With a hollow rumbling the carriage passed the streams. It proved to be an old-fashioned coach with lamps, drawn by strong, slow grey horses. Cleave recognized the Silver Hill equipage. Silver Hill must have been supping with Lauderdale. Immediately he divined who was the horseman. The carriage drew alongside, the lamps making a small ring of light. \"Good-evening, Mr. Stafford!\" said Cleave. The other raised his hat. \"Mr. Cleave, is it not? Good-evening, sir!\" A voice spoke within the coach. \"It's Richard Cleave now! Stop, Ephraim!\"  The slow grey horses came to a stand. Cleave dismounted, and came, hat in hand, to the coach window. The mistress of Silver Hill, a young married woman, frank and sweet, put out a hand. \"Good-evening, Mr. Cleave! You are on your way to Lauderdale? My sister and Maury Stafford and I are carrying Judith off to Silver Hill for the night.--She wants to give you a message--\"  She moved aside and Judith took her place--Judith in fur cap and cloak, her beautiful face just lit by the coach lamp. \"It's not a message, Richard. I--I did not know that you were coming to Lauderdale to-night. Had I known it, I--Give my love, my dear love, to Cousin Margaret. I would have come to Three Oaks, only--\"  \"You are going home to-morrow?\"  \"Yes. Fauquier wishes to get back to Albemarle--\"  \"Will you start from Lauderdale?\"  \"No, from Silver Hill. He will come by for me. But had I known,\" said Judith clearly, \"had I known that you would ride to Lauderdale to-night--\"  \"You would dutifully have stayed to see a cousin,\" thought Cleave in savage pain. He spoke quietly, in the controlled but vibrant voice he had used on the hilltop. \"I am sorry that I will not see you to-night. I will ride on, however, and talk to Fauquier. You will give my love, will you not, to all my cousins at Greenwood? I do not forget how good all were to me last summer!--Good-bye, Judith.\"  She gave him her hand. It trembled a little in her glove. \"Come again to Greenwood! Winter or summer, it will be glad to see you!--Good-bye, Richard.\"  Fur cap, cloak, beautiful face, drew back. \"Go on, Ephraim!\" said the mistress of Silver Hill.  The slow grey horses put themselves into motion, the coach passed on. Maury Stafford waited until Cleave had remounted. \"It has been an exciting day!\" he said. \"I think that we are at the parting of the ways.\"  \"I think so. You will be at Silver Hill throughout the week?\"  \"No, I think that I, too, will ride toward Albemarle to-morrow. It is worth something to be with Fauquier Cary a little longer.\"  \"That is quite true,\" said Cleave slowly. \"I do not ride to Albemarle to-morrow, and so I will pursue my road to Lauderdale and make the most of him to-night!\" He turned his horse, lifted his hat. Stafford did likewise. They parted, and Cleave presently heard the rapid hoofbeat overtake the Silver Hill coach and at once change to a slower rhythm. \"Now _he_ is speaking with her through the window!\" The sound of wheel and hoof died away. Cleave shook Dundee's reins and went on toward Lauderdale. _Judith Cary--Judith Cary--There are other things in life than love--other things than love--other things than love.... Judith Cary--Judith Cary...._  At Three Oaks Margaret Cleave rested upon her couch by the fire. Miriam was curled on the rug with a book, an apple, and Tabitha the cat. Will mended a skate-strap and discoursed of \"Old Jack.\" \"It's a fact, ma'am! Wilson worked the problem, gave the solution, and got from Old Jack a regular withering up! They'll all tell you, ma'am, that he excels in withering up! 'You are wrong, Mr. Wilson,' says he, in that tone of his--dry as tinder, and makes you stop like a musket-shot! 'You are always wrong. Go to your seat, sir.' Well, old Wilson went, of course, and sat there so angry he was shivering. You see he was right, and he knew it. Well, the day went on about as usual. It set in to snow, and by night there was what a western man we've got calls a 'blizzard.' Barracks like an ice house, and snowing so you couldn't see across the Campus! 'T was so deadly cold and the lights so dismal that we rather looked forward to taps. Up comes an orderly. 'Mr. Wilson to the Commandant's office!'--Well, old Wilson looked startled, for he hadn't done anything; but off he marches, the rest of us predicting hanging. Well, whom d' ye reckon he found in the Commandant's office?\"  \"Old Jack?\"  \"Good marksmanship! It was Old Jack--snow all over, snow on his coat, on his big boots, on his beard, on his cap. He lives most a mile from the Institute, and the weather was bad, sure enough! Well, old Wilson didn't know what to expect--most likely hot shot, grape and canister with musketry fire thrown in--but he saluted and stood fast. 'Mr. Wilson,' says Old Jack, 'upon returning home and going over with closed eyes after supper as is my custom the day's work, I discovered that you were right this morning and I was wrong. Your solution was correct. I felt it to be your due that I should tell you of my mistake as soon as I discovered it. I apologise for the statement that you were always wrong. You may go, sir.' Well, old Wilson never could tell what he said, but anyhow he accepted the apology, and saluted, and got out of the room somehow and back to barracks, and we breathed on the window and made a place through which we watched Old Jack over the Campus, ploughing back to Mrs."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22066"],["title","The Long Roll (#6)"],["body","through the blizzard! So you see, ma'am, things like that make us lenient to Old Jack sometimes--though he is awfully dull and has very peculiar notions.\"  Margaret Cleave sat up. \"Is that you, Richard?\" Miriam put down Tabitha and rose to her knees. \"Did you see Cousin Judith? Is she as beautiful as ever?\" Will hospitably gave up the big chair. \"You must have galloped Dundee both ways! Did you ask about the shotgun?\"  Cleave took his seat at the foot of his mother's couch. \"Yes, Will, you may have it.--Fauquier sent his love to you, Mother, and to Miriam. They leave for Greenwood to-morrow.\"  \"And Cousin Judith,\" persisted Miriam. \"What did she have on? Did she sing to you?\"  Cleave picked up her fallen book and smoothed the leaves. \"She was not there. The Silver Hill people had taken her for the night. I passed them on the road.... There'll be thick ice, Will, if this weather lasts.\"  Later, when good-night had been said and he was alone in his bare, high-ceiled room, he looked, not at his law books nor at the poet's words, left lying on the table, but he drew a chair before the fireplace, and from its depths he raised his eyes to his grandfather's sword slung above the mantel-shelf. He sat there, long, with the sword before him; then he rose, took a book from the case, trimmed the candles, and for an hour read of the campaigns of Fabius and Hannibal.     CHAPTER IV  GREENWOOD   The April sunshine, streaming in at the long windows, filled the Greenwood drawing-room with dreamy gold. It lit the ancient wall-paper where the shepherds and shepherdesses wooed between garlands of roses, and it aided the tone of time among the portraits. The boughs of peach and cherry blossoms in the old potpourri jars made it welcome, and the dark, waxed floor let it lie in faded pools. Miss Lucy Cary was glad to see it as she sat by the fire knitting fine white wool into a sacque for a baby. There was a fire of hickory, but it burned low, as though it knew the winter was over. The knitter's needles glinted in the sunshine. She was forty-eight and unmarried, and it was her delight to make beautiful, soft little sacques and shoes and coverlets for every actual or prospective baby in all the wide circle of her kindred and friends.  A tap at the door, and the old Greenwood butler entered with the mail-bag. Miss Lucy, laying down her knitting, took it from him with eager fingers. _Place a la poste_--in eighteen hundred and sixty-one! She untied the string, emptied letters and papers upon the table beside her, and began to sort them. Julius, a spare and venerable piece of grey-headed ebony, an autocrat of exquisite manners and great family pride, stood back a little and waited for directions.  Miss Lucy, taking up one after another the contents of the bag, made her comments half aloud. \"Newspapers, newspapers! Nothing but the twelfth and Fort Sumter! _The Whig._--'South Carolina is too hot-headed!--but when all's said, the North remains the aggressor.' _The Examiner._--'Seward's promises are not worth the paper they are written upon.' '_Faith as to Sumter fully kept--wait and see._' That which was seen was a fleet of eleven vessels, with two hundred and eighty-five guns and twenty-four hundred men--'_carrying provisions to a starving garrison!_' Have done with cant, and welcome open war! _The Enquirer._--'Virginia will still succeed in mediating. Virginia from her curule chair, tranquil and fast in the Union, will persuade, will reconcile these differences!' Amen to that!\" said Miss Lucy, and took up another bundle. \"_The Staunton Gazette_--_The Farmer's Magazine_--_The Literary Messenger_--My _Blackwood_--Julius!\"  \"Yaas, Miss Lucy.\"  \"Julius, the Reverend Mr. Corbin Wood will be here for supper and to spend the night. Let Car'line know.\"  \"Yaas, Miss Lucy. Easter's Jim hab obsarved to me dat Marse Edward am conducin' home a gent'man from Kentucky.\"  \"Very well,\" said Miss Lucy, still sorting. \"_The Winchester Times_--_The Baltimore Sun._--The mint's best, Julius, in the lower bed. I walked by there this morning.--Letters for my brother! I'll readdress these, and Easter's Jim must take them to town in time for the Richmond train.\"  \"Yaas, Miss Lucy. Easter's Jim hab imported dat Marse Berkeley Cyarter done recompense him on de road dis mahnin' ter know when Marster's comin' home.\"  \"Just as soon,\" said Miss Lucy, \"as the Convention brings everybody to their senses.--Three letters for Edward--one in young Beaufort Porcher's writing. Now we'll hear the Charleston version--probably he fired the first shot!--A note for me.--Julius, the Palo Alto ladies will stop by for dinner to-morrow. Tell Car'line.\"  \"Yaas, Miss Lucy.\"  Miss Lucy took up a thick, bluish envelope. \"From Fauquier at last--from the Red River.\" She opened the letter, ran rapidly over the half-dozen sheets, then laid them aside for a more leisurely perusal. \"It's one of his swift, light, amusing letters! He hasn't heard about Sumter.--There'll be a message for you, Julius. There always is.\"  Julius's smile was as bland as sunshine. \"Yaas, Miss Lucy. I 'spects dar'll be some excommunication fer me. Marse Fauquier sho' do favour Old Marster in dat.--He don' never forgit! 'Pears ter me he'd better come home--all dis heah congratulatin' backwards an' forwards wid gunpowder over de kintry! Gunpowder gwine burn ef folk git reckless!\"  Miss Lucy sighed. \"It will that, Julius,--it's burning now. Edward from Sally Hampton. More Charleston news!--One for Molly, three for Unity, five for Judith--\"  \"Miss Judith jes' sont er 'lumination by one of de chillern at de gate. She an' Marse Maury Stafford'll be back by five. Dey ain' gwine ride furder'n Monticello.\"  \"Very well. Mr. Stafford will be here to supper, then. Hairston Breckinridge, too, I imagine. Tell Car'line.\"  Miss Lucy readdressed the letters for her brother, a year older than herself, and the master of Greenwood, a strong Whig influence in his section of the State, and now in Richmond, in the Convention there, speaking earnestly for amity, a better understanding between Sovereign States, and a happily restored Union. His wife, upon whom he had lavished an intense and chivalric devotion, was long dead, and for years his sister had taken the head of his table and cared like a mother for his children.  She sat now, at work, beneath the portrait of her own mother. As good as gold, as true as steel, warm-hearted and large-natured, active, capable, and of a sunny humour, she kept her place in the hearts of all who knew her. Not a great beauty as had been her mother, she was yet a handsome woman, clear brunette with bright, dark eyes and a most likable mouth. Miss Lucy never undertook to explain why she had not married, but her brothers thought they knew. She finished the letters and gave them to Julius. \"Let Easter's Jim take them right away, in time for the evening train.--Have you seen Miss Unity?\"  \"Yaas, ma'am. Miss Unity am in de flower gyarden wid Marse Hairston Breckinridge. Dey're training roses.\"  \"Where is Miss Molly?\"  \"Miss Molly am in er reverence over er big book in de library.\"  The youngest Miss Cary's voice floated in from the hall. \"No, I'm not, Uncle Julius. Open the door wider, please!\" Julius obeyed, and she entered the drawing-room with a great atlas outspread upon her arms. \"Aunt Lucy, where _are_ all these places? I can't find them. The Island and Fort Moultrie and Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens, and the rest of them! I wish when bombardments and surrenders and exciting things happen they'd happen nearer home!\"  \"Child, child!\" cried Miss Lucy, \"don't you ever say such a thing as that again! The way you young people talk is enough to bring down a judgment upon us! It's like Sir Walter crying 'Bonny bonny!' to the jagged lightnings. You are eighty years away from a great war, and you don't know what you are talking about, and may you never be any nearer!--Yes, Julius, that's all. Tell Easter's Jim to go right away.--Now, Molly, this is the island, and here is Fort Moultrie and here Fort Sumter. I used to know Charleston, when I was a girl. I can see now the Battery, and the blue sky, and the roses,--and the roses.\"  She took up her knitting and made a few stitches mechanically, then laid it down and applied herself to Fauquier Cary's letter. Molly, ensconced in a window, was already busy with her own. Presently she spoke. \"Miriam Cleave says that Will passed his examination higher than any one.\"  \"That is good!\" said Miss Lucy. \"They all have fine minds--the Cleaves. What else does she say?\"  \"She says that Richard has given her a silk dress for her birthday, and she's going to have it made with angel sleeves, and wear a hoop with it. She's sixteen--just like me.\"  \"Richard's a good brother.\"  \"She says that Richard has gone to Richmond--something about arms for his Company of Volunteers. Aunt Lucy--\"  \"Yes, dear.\"  \"I think that Richard loves Judith.\"  \"Molly, Molly, stop romancing!\"  \"I am not romancing. I don't believe in it. That week last summer he used to watch her and Mr. Stafford--and there was a look in his eyes like the knight's in the 'Arcadia'--\"  \"Molly! Molly!\"  \"And everybody knew that Mr. Stafford was a suitor. _I_ knew it--Easter told me. And everybody thought that Judith was going to make him happy, only she doesn't seem to have done so--at least, not yet. And there was the big tournament, and Richard and Dundee took all the rings, though I know that Mr. Stafford had expected to, and Judith let Richard crown her queen, but she looked just as pale and still! and Richard had a line between his brows, and I think he thought she would rather have had the Maid of Honour's crown that Mr. Stafford won and gave to just a little girl--\"  \"Molly, I am going to lock up every poetry book in the house--\"  \"And that was one day, and the next morning Richard looked stern and fine, and rode away. He isn't really handsome--not like Edward, that is--only he has a way of looking so. And Judith--\"  \"Molly,"]]]
