Paul, \"whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?\"  The servant seeks to win the fellow-servant, the labourer in the field has the welfare of his fellow-labourer at heart, and seeks to draw him to God.  It was Cain who said, \"Am I my brother's keeper?\"  And the same isolating, selfish spirit is in those who take no interest in those they associate with, and do not seek their good.  I was much struck last spring with something a gentleman said to me, who had been a good deal in America; he was much surprised and struck with the interest felt in England by the rich for the poor, by the master and mistress for their servants, by the landowner for his tenants, and he said to me, \"This seems to me the most marvellous thing I have seen in England.  With us a master cares not one snap of the fingers what becomes of the man he employs, he no more thinks of what becomes of him than he does of a dollar that passes through his hands. He sees that he does his work, and if the man dies, the master gets another in his place to-morrow, and asks nothing about the man who has disappeared.\"  Well!  I thank God we are not come to that yet, however advanced we may be in our independent ways; and it is not right and Christian that we should.  II.  Now we come to the way in which we are to try to draw other souls to Christ, the souls of our children, of our servants, of our companions, of our fellow-workers.  The first principle of success is gentleness.  In the 4th chapter of the 2nd book of Kings we have this story.  There was a Shunammite woman who had an only son.  She was a good kind-hearted woman, who had shown much hospitality to the prophet Elijah [Transcriber's note: Elisha?].  One day the little boy ran out into the harvest field, when the sun was hot, and he had a sunstroke, and was very ill.  \"He said unto his father, My head, my head.  And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.  And when he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then he died.  And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.\"  Then she ordered one of the servants to saddle an ass, and drive her to the prophet; and when she found him, she told him the piteous story, and how the poor little fellow whom she loved so dearly, and who was such a darling of his father, and such a pet of the old Elisha when he paid them his visits, was lying white and dead upstairs on the bed.  Then Elisha was sorely troubled, and he gave his staff to his servant, Gehazi, and made him run as fast as he could to the house of the Shunammite.  \"Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again; and lay my staff upon the face of the child.\"  Gehazi obeyed, but it was of no use.  \"He laid the staff upon the face of the child: but there was neither voice, nor hearing.\"  Then Elisha came himself, and he shut the door, and laid himself beside the little body, and put his lips to the lips of the child, and his warm loving heart against the little dead heart, and took the chill hands in his.  Then the spirit of the child came back into him again, and he sat up, and Elisha delivered him alive to his mother.  Now this story contains some lesson for us.  And this is the short comment on the miracle by an old writer, \"Him whom the rod of terror will not rouse, _love_ will.\"  Or in other words, we may learn by this that gentleness will succeed where harshness will fail.  In the time when all the north of England was heathen, there was an assembly held at Iona to decide who should preach the gospel to the English of Northumbria.  Then one missionary was sent, and after having laboured for some years, he came back to give an account of his mission.  And a council was held, and he said, \"Those Northumbrians are a stiff-necked, hard-hearted people.  I threatened them with God's wrath, I spoke to them of Hell-fire, I warned them of the terrors of judgment, I denounced the vengeance of God on them, and they would not be converted.\"  Then one sitting in a bark seat said, \"My brother, it seems to me that you went the wrong way to work.  You should have gone in love, and not in wrath.  You should have tried to win, and not to drive.\"  All eyes were turned en the speaker, and it was decided with one voice that he should be sent, and he went.  His name was Aidan--and he was the Apostle of all Northumberland, Durham, and Yorkshire.  He had the joy to see the whole people bow their necks to receive the yoke of Christ.  What says S. Paul?  \"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?\"  If he had come with the rod, he would have gone back disappointed.  CONCLUSION.--Let us then, dear brethren, in dealing with the souls of others, approach them, not with the rod, or we shall fail to awake them to a new and better life, but in love, and in the spirit of gentleness, and then we shall meet, I doubt not, with good success.     XLIII.  _PERSISTENCY IN WRONG DOING._  6th Sunday after Trinity.  S. Matt. v. 25.  \"Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him.\"   INTRODUCTION.--I spoke to you the Sunday before last about the obstinacy of persisting in an opinion after you have good cause to believe that this opinion is unjust, or unreasonable.  I am going to speak to you to-day of another form of obstinacy.  SUBJECT.--My subject is Persistency in doing wrong, because you have begun wrong.  This is only another form of the same fault.  The other is thinking wrong persistently, this is perseverance in doing wrong. And the source of both is the same, Pride.  Pride stands in the way of altering an erroneous opinion, and in the way of altering a wrongful course of action.  I.  In the tenth chapter of the second book of Samuel we have a striking story of the way in which a man having once done a wrong, persists in it, and it brings about his ruin.  King David, when firmly established on his throne, began to look about him to see who had been kind to him in his day of adversity, and to reward, or thank them.  He showed his gratitude to the memory of his friend Jonathan by investing his son Mephibosheth with his grandfather's property.  Then he remembered that Nahash the King of Ammon had shown him hospitality, and he heard also that he was just dead.  So David said, \"I will show kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed kindness unto me.\"  And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father.  The message was kindly intended.  David wished to show that he was not forgetful of past favours, that he was ready to make a lasting friendship with Hanun, and he desired to exhibit his sympathy with the son for the loss of his father.  These were the three motives actuating David, all good.  Now, how did Hanun act?  One would naturally suppose that he would appreciate these motives, and that he would be glad, when scarce settled on his throne, to secure the powerful friendship of King David.  No!--he was young, insolent, inconsiderate, and fond of practical joking,--a vulgar-minded fellow, puffed up with conceit at his elevation to power.  Hanun took the servants, the ambassadors of David, and shaved off half their beards, and cut off the lower half of all their clothes, and sent them back to David.  And when it was told unto David that his messengers had been thus ignominiously treated, \"he sent to meet them, because the men were greatly ashamed, and said, Tarry at Jericho, until your beards be grown, and then return.\"  As soon as Hanun and his Ammonites had done this, what was their next step?--As perhaps you are aware, by the laws of civilized and uncivilized people, the persons of ambassadors are held to be sacred. Therefore Hanun had not only done an insolent, and utterly blackguard trick, but he had gone against one of the first laws of nations.  What he ought to have done, was at once to send to David a most humble apology, with an acknowledgment that he had acted wrongly.  But he was too proud for this.  He would not admit that he had erred.  He at once sent and hired the Syrians of Beth-rehob, and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand foot soldiers, and of King Maacah a thousand men, and of Ish-tob twelve thousand men, so that this malicious trick began to shew that it was an expensive one.  Then David's army drew up in array against this army of Ammon and their hired allies, and at once, all the mercenaries ran away.  So then there was nothing for it but for the Ammonites to return as quickly as possible within the walls of their city.  Now, what should Hanun have done?  It was clear that David was not eager to punish him, for he had not even sent his army against Ammon till Hanun had collected the great host against him, and as soon as the Ammonites, deserted by their auxiliaries, had retired within their walls, the army of David had not pressed them, but gone quietly back to Jerusalem.  What then ought Hanun to have done?  Of course, he should now have sent his apology, and said how wrongly he had acted, how ashamed of himself he was, and how desirous he was to have the past forgotten.  But no, having done wrong once, his pride would not let him acknowledge it, and he went on.  He now engaged Hadarezar, King of the Syrians, and this time there was a great battle, and David slew of the Syrians seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and smote the captain of their host, so that he was left dead on the field, and all the Syrians who could escape ran away for their lives.  Then Hadarezer had had quite enough of fighting against Israel, and he made peace with David, and \"So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.\"  Now the Ammonites were left completely without auxiliaries.  What chance was there for "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/21987"],["title","The Village Pulpit, Volume II. Trinity to Advent (#5)"],["body","them?  Still David did not press them.  A whole year passed, and he made no move.  He was waiting for an apology.  But no.  That headstrong Hanun was still too proud to make it.  He would die with all his people rather than say he had done wrong.  So, at the end of a year, David sent his army against the Ammonites, and destroyed them utterly.  He killed Hanun, and took away his crown, and plundered his capital town, and ruined all his cities. That was the end of one practical joke unapologised for.  II.  In the Gospel for to-day, our Lord warns against the same hard-headedness in persisting in refusing an apology, and to make up friendship that has been broken.  \"Agree with thine adversary quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.  Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.\"  He urges Christians when they have done an injury to any, frankly to confess it, to put their pride in their pocket, and to ask forgiveness. It is not an easy thing to do, to acknowledge that you have done wrong, but there is more true courage in doing so, than in persevering in spite of the consequences, in wrong doing.  Many a lasting and miserable quarrel has arisen because at the outset one little word has not been said, which would have made all things smooth.  Two families become estranged and bitterly hostile, because some one has reported to the mother in one, that the mother in the other had made a disparaging remark about her.  A little word, and all would be explained, and set to rights.  \"Let not the sun go down on your wrath,\" says the Apostle, and an excellent piece of advice this is:--Make up all quarrels the same day that they break out.  There was a good old bishop of Alexandria called John the Almsgiver, and he and the Governor of the city were great friends.  Something occurred which made a breach between them.  If I remember aright, it was this.  The bishop was very charitable, and was always urging the rich people to give to the poor, and they were constantly sending him money to distribute among the sick and needy.  Now at this time the Governor had experienced some difficulty in raising the taxes, and this ruffled his temper.  He was on a visit to the Bishop, when he saw on the stairs a number of servants of a rich lady bringing up, as a present to the bishop some pots, labelled \"Virgin Honey.\"  The Governor said he did not believe they were pots of honey, but pots of gold, and when the bishop offered to open them and let him see for himself, he dashed out of the door in a rage, and said, \"No wonder I can't get money in taxes when you swindle it out of the people, to feed the beggars on honey.\"  When the Governor was gone, the old Bishop was very troubled, and he sat in his room all the rest of the day, waiting for the Governor to come and make it up with him.  But no! the Governor was fuming with anger and would do no such thing.  That evening the Governor had a party, and as he was sitting at table with the guests, a little scrap of paper was put on his plate, a servant of the Bishop had brought it.  The Governor took it up and saw, \"Dear old Friend--THE SUN IS SETTING.\"  Then his heart relented, he excused himself to his guests, and ran to the house of the Bishop, and they fell into one another's arms and made friends again.  CONCLUSION.--Now remember this story.  Whenever you have a quarrel with another, let not the sun go down on your wrath.  Make it up before set of sun.     XLIV.  THE MEASURE OF SIN.  7th Sunday after Trinity.  S. Mark viii. 2.  \"I have compassion on the multitude.\"   INTRODUCTION.--In to-day's Gospel we see the tender compassion of our Lord for those who came into the wilderness to hear Him.  This is only one example out of many of His great love and mercy: and indeed \"His mercy is over all His works.\"  \"Thou, O Lord,\" says David, \"art full of compassion and mercy, long-suffering and truth.\"  This is a verity of which we are so convinced that it is quite possible we may overlook the other truth, that His mercy, though unlimited in extent, is limited in its application.  His mercy is extended for a definite purpose, and when it ceases to avail for this purpose, then it ceases to flow.  What that purpose is, S. Paul tells us.  \"Knowest thou not,\" he says, \"that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance.\"  That is, God is merciful that we may amend, not in order that we may continue in sin. Now, if men thought that when they had fallen into grievous sin there was no more a hope of recovery, then they would sink into despair, and become hard and impenitent.  But that this may not be the case, God assures us of His mercy, but he assures us of His mercy only to insure our amendment.  SUBJECT.--It seems plain from Holy Scripture that to each man there is a fixed measure of sin, and that if he fills that measure, after that there is no place for repentance, and no more pardon.  This is a very terrible truth,--but a truth it is, as I shall show you.  I.  There was a nation of Canaan called the Amorites, and God promised to Abraham that He would give their land to his descendants, but that He could not give it yet without injustice.  The land was in the possession of the Amorites, a people on their trial, and till the day of their probation was expired, their kingdom could not be taken from them.  \"In the fourth generation,\" God said, \"thy seed shall come hither, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.\"  Now actually it was not till four hundred and seventy years later that the destruction of the Amorites was accomplished.  Four generations after Abraham, that is some two hundred and forty years after, the measure of their iniquities was full, and yet they existed on till Joshua crossed Jordan with the Israelites, and then they were all put to the sword.  In the New Testament we hear the Jews addressed as though they also had a measure of sin they must fill up before God would forsake them.  Our Lord says to them, \"Ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.  Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.  Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of Hell? Behold I send unto you prophets, and wise-men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify: and persecute them from city to city: that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.\"  The Jewish nation had done great wickedness, but the measure of their iniquities was not full till they had rejected Christ, and had refused to listen to His Apostles, and the Holy Ghost speaking through their mouths. Till then He would not cast them off entirely.  II.  David prays to God, \"Lord, let me know the number of my days, that I may be certified how long I have to live.\"  No doubt, God has fixed for all men a certain length of life.  No doubt also He has set for each a certain limit of forbearance; a line, an invisible line drawn somewhere, and He says to man, Thus far mayest thou go, and I will still be merciful and pardon, but no further.  Transgress that line, and I forgive no more.  My Spirit will not always strive with man.  In those cases which I have quoted to you, God is dealing with nations, but He deals with individuals in the same way.  His laws are uniform; as He deals with an assemblage of people, so He deals with single individuals.  If He fixes a bound to nations, beyond which they cannot go without His forsaking them, it is because there is the law, which is of general application to all human beings; a law applying to single persons, and to persons in the aggregate.  In the Prophet Amos we read a message from God to Judah, \"Thus saith the Lord: For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof.\"  This means, if I mistake not, Judah has committed some two or three gross sins, and I was ready to turn away the punishment, had there been a sign of repentance, but when to the three they added a fourth, then it was too late.  The time of repentance was past, and the punishment threatened must fall.  And now perhaps you can understand a saying of S. John in his first Epistle.  He says:--\"If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.  There is a sin unto death, I do not say that he shall pray for it.\"  S. John is not speaking here of what we call mortal sins, but of mortal sins continued till the measure is filled up, and when the last sin has been added which completes the measure, that is the sin unto death, which it avails nothing to pray for, for that sin ends in death.  Before, there was life, spiritual life, perhaps flickering, but extant, then comes the last sin, and the life is gone out, all is dark, and dead, and cold, no more fanning of the black ashes is of any avail, the fire is out and cannot be revived.  III.  How does God deal with those who have gone beyond this measure? In one of two ways.  Either:--  1.  There comes a sudden call,--a sudden death-sickness or accident cuts them off.  Or:--  2.  Dead impenitence settles over the soul, which no longer wishes for anything better, which feels no desire for pardon.  Of the first case, we have instances in Scripture.  King Belshazzar had committed many transgressions, he was weighed in the balances, but still found wanting in the final and irreversible act of wickedness, till that night when he brought out the sacred vessels used in the temple to drink out of them at his riotous banquet in his palace.  That act of sacrilege was the one sin which weighed down the balance.  What says the sacred text?  \"In that night was Belshazzar the King of the Chaldeans"]]]
