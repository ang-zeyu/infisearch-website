Marmaduke, much astonished and bewildered, muttered a paternoster in great haste; and even the clerical rank of the prelate did not preserve him from the suspicion of magical practices in the youth's mind.  Remote from all his train, in a little arbour overgrown with the honeysuckle and white rose, a small table before him bearing fruits, confectionery, and spiced wines (for the prelate was a celebrated epicure, though still in the glow of youth), they found George Nevile, reading lazily a Latin manuscript.  \"Well, my dear lord and brother,\" said Montagu, laying his arm on the prelate's shoulder, \"first let me present to thy favour a gallant youth, Marmaduke Nevile, worthy his name and thy love.\"  \"He is welcome, Montagu, to our poor house,\" said the archbishop, rising, and complacently glancing at his palace, splendidly gleaming through the trellis-work. 'Puer ingenui vultus.'  Thou art acquainted, doubtless, young sir, with the Humaner Letters?\"  \"Well-a-day, my lord, my nurturing was somewhat neglected in the province,\" said Marmaduke, disconcerted, and deeply blushing, \"and only of late have I deemed the languages fit study for those not reared for our Mother Church.\"  \"Fie, sir, fie!  Correct that error, I pray thee.  Latin teaches the courtier how to thrive, the soldier how to manoeuvre, the husbandman how to sow; and if we churchmen are more cunning, as the profane call us (and the prelate smiled) than ye of the laity, the Latin must answer for the sins of our learning.\"  With this, the archbishop passed his arm affectionately through his brother's, and said, \"Beshrew me, Montagu, thou lookest worn and weary.  Surely thou lackest food, and supper shall be hastened.  Even I, who have but slender appetite, grow hungered in these cool gloaming hours.\"  \"Dismiss my comrade, George,--I would speak to thee,\" whispered Montagu.  \"Thou knowest not Latin?\" said the archbishop, turning with a compassionate eye to Nevile, whose own eye was amorously fixed on the delicate confectioneries,--\"never too late to learn.  Hold, here is a grammar of the verbs, that, with mine own hand, I have drawn up for youth.  Study thine amo and thy moneo, while I confer on Church matters with giddy Montagu.  I shall expect, ere we sup, that thou wilt have mastered the first tenses.\"  \"But--\"  \"Oh, nay, nay; but me no buts.  Thou art too tough, I fear me, for flagellation, a wondrous improver of tender youth,\"--and the prelate forced his grammar into the reluctant hands of Marmaduke, and sauntered down one of the solitary alleys with his brother.  Long and earnest was their conference, and at one time keen were their dispute's.  The archbishop had very little of the energy of Montagu or the impetuosity of Warwick, but he had far more of what we now call mind, as distinct from talent, than either; that is, he had not their capacities for action, but he had a judgment and sagacity that made him considered a wise and sound adviser: this he owed principally to the churchman's love of ease, and to his freedom from the wear and tear of the passions which gnawed the great minister and the aspiring courtier; his natural intellect was also fostered by much learning. George Nevile had been reared, by an Italian ecclesiastic, in all the subtle diplomacy of the Church; and his ambition, despising lay objects (though he consented to hold the office of chancellor), was concentrated in that kingdom over kings which had animated the august dominators of religious Rome.  Though, as we have said, still in that age when the affections are usually vivid, [He was consecrated Bishop of Exeter at the age of twenty; at twenty-six he became Archbishop of York, and was under thirty at the time referred to in the text.] George Nevile loved no human creature,--not even his brothers; not even King Edward, who, with all his vices, possessed so eminently the secret that wins men's hearts.  His early and entire absorption in the great religious community, which stood apart from the laymen in order to control them, alienated him from his kind; and his superior instruction only served to feed him with a calm and icy contempt for all that prejudice, as he termed it, held dear and precious.  He despised the knight's wayward honour, the burgher's crafty honesty. For him no such thing as principle existed; and conscience itself lay dead in the folds of a fancied exemption from all responsibility to the dull herd, that were but as wool and meat to the churchman shepherd.  But withal, if somewhat pedantic, he had in his manner a suavity and elegance and polish which suited well his high station, and gave persuasion to his counsels.  In all externals he was as little like a priest as the high-born prelates of that day usually were.  In dress he rivalled the fopperies of the Plantagenet brothers; in the chase he was more ardent than Warwick had been in his earlier youth; and a dry sarcastic humour, sometimes elevated into wit, gave liveliness to his sagacious converse.  Montagu desired that the archbishop and himself should demand solemn audience of Edward, and gravely remonstrate with the king on the impropriety of receiving the brother of a rival suitor, while Warwick was negotiating the marriage of Margaret with a prince of France.  \"Nay,\" said the archbishop, with a bland smile, that fretted Montagu to the quick, \"surely even a baron, a knight, a franklin, a poor priest like myself, would rise against the man who dictated to his hospitality.  Is a king less irritable than baron, knight, franklin, and priest,--or rather, being, as it were, per legem, lord of all, hath he not irritability eno' for all four?  Ay, tut and tush as thou wilt, John, but thy sense must do justice to my counsel at the last. I know Edward well; he hath something of mine own idlesse and ease of temper, but with more of the dozing lion than priests, who have only, look you, the mildness of the dove.  Prick up his higher spirit, not by sharp remonstrance, but by seeming trust. Observe to him, with thy gay, careless laugh--which, methinks, thou hast somewhat lost of late --that with any other prince Warwick might suspect some snare, some humiliating overthrow of his embassage, but that all men know how steadfast in faith and honour is Edward IV.\"  \"Truly,\" said Montagu, with a forced smile, \"you understand mankind; but yet, bethink you--suppose this fail, and Warwick return to England to hear that he hath been cajoled and fooled; that the Margaret he had crossed the seas to affiance to the brother of Louis is betrothed to Charolois--bethink you, I say, what manner of heart beats under our brother's mail.\"  \"Impiger, iracundus!\" said the archbishop; \"a very Achilles, to whom our English Agamemnon, if he cross him, is a baby.  All this is sad truth; our parents spoilt him in his childhood, and glory in his youth, and wealth, power, success, in his manhood.  Ay! if Warwick be chafed, it will be as the stir of the sea-serpent, which, according to the Icelanders, moves a world.  Still, the best way to prevent the danger is to enlist the honour of the king in his behalf,--to show that our eyes are open, but that we disdain to doubt, and are frank to confide.  Meanwhile send messages and warnings privately to Warwick.\"  These reasonings finally prevailed with Montagu, and the brothers returned with one mind to the house.  Here, as after their ablutions they sat down to the evening meal, the archbishop remembered poor Marmaduke, and despatched to him one of his thirty household chaplains.  Marmaduke was found fast asleep over the second tense of the verb amo.     CHAPTER VI.  THE ARRIVAL OF THE COUNT DE LA ROCHE, AND THE VARIOUS EXCITEMENT PRODUCED ON MANY PERSONAGES BY THAT EVENT.  The prudence of the archbishop's counsel was so far made manifest, that on the next day Montagu found all remonstrance would have been too late.  The Count de la Roche had already landed, and was on his way to London.  The citizens, led by Rivers partially to suspect the object of the visit, were delighted not only by the prospect of a brilliant pageant, but by the promise such a visit conveyed of a continued peace with their commercial ally; and the preparations made by the wealthy merchants increased the bitterness and discontent of Montagu.  At length, at the head of a gallant and princely retinue, the Count de la Roche entered London.  Though Hastings made no secret of his distaste to the Count de la Roche's visit, it became his office as lord chamberlain to meet the count at Blackwall, and escort him and his train, in gilded barges, to the palace.  In the great hall of the Tower, in which the story of Antiochus was painted by the great artists employed under Henry III., and on the elevation of the dais, behind which, across Gothic columns, stretched draperies of cloth-of-gold, was placed Edward's chair of state. Around him were grouped the Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester, the Lords Worcester, Montagu, Rivers, D'Eyncourt, St. John, Raoul de Fulke, and others.  But at the threshold of the chamber stood Anthony Woodville, the knightly challenger, his knee bound by the ladye-badge of the S. S., and his fine person clad in white-flowered velvet of Genoa, adorned with pearls.  Stepping forward, as the count appeared, the gallant Englishman bent his knee half-way to the ground, and raising the count's hand to his lips, said in French, \"Deign, noble sir, to accept the gratitude of one who were not worthy of encounter from so peerless a hand, save by the favour of the ladies of England, and your own courtesy, which ennobles him whom it stoops to.\"  So saying, he led the count towards the king.  De la Roche, an experienced and profound courtier, and justly deserving Hall's praise as a man of \"great witte, courage, valiantness, and liberalitie,\" did not affect to conceal the admiration which the remarkable presence of Edward never failed to excite; lifting his hand to his eyes, as if to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7719"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 05 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger      BOOK V.     CHAPTER I.  RURAL ENGLAND IN THE MIDDLE AGES--NOBLE VISITORS SEEK THE CASTLE OF MIDDLEHAM.  Autumn had succeeded to summer, winter to autumn, and the spring of 1468 was green in England, when a gallant cavalcade was seen slowly winding the ascent of a long and gradual hill, towards the decline of day.  Different, indeed, from the aspect which that part of the country now presents was the landscape that lay around them, bathed in the smiles of the westering sun.  In a valley to the left, a full view of which the steep road commanded (where now roars the din of trade through a thousand factories), lay a long, secluded village.  The houses, if so they might be called, were constructed entirely of wood, and that of the more perishable kind,--willow, sallow, elm, and plum- tree.  Not one could boast a chimney; but the smoke from the single fire in each, after duly darkening the atmosphere within, sent its surplusage lazily and fitfully through a circular aperture in the roof.  In fact, there was long in the provinces a prejudice against chimneys!  The smoke was considered good both for house and owner; the first it was supposed to season, and the last to guard \"from rheums, catarrhs, and poses.\"  [So worthy Hollinshed, Book II. c. 22.--\"Then had we none but reredosses, and our heads did never ache.  For as the smoke, in those days, was supposed to be a sufficient hardening for the timber of the house, so it was reputed a far better medicine to keep the goodman and his familie from the quacke, or pose, wherewith as then very few were oft acquainted.\"]  Neither did one of these habitations boast the comfort of a glazed window, the substitute being lattice, or chequer-work,--even in the house of the franklin, which rose statelily above the rest, encompassed with barns and outsheds. And yet greatly should we err did we conceive that these deficiencies were an index to the general condition of the working class.  Far better off was the labourer when employed, than now.  Wages were enormously high, meat extremely low; [See Hallam: Middle Ages, Chap. xx. Part II.  So also Hollinsbed, Book XI., c. 12, comments on the amazement of the Spaniards, in Queen Mary's time, when they saw \"what large diet was used in these so homelie cottages,\" and reports one of the Spaniards to have said, \"These English have their houses of sticks and dirt, but they fare commonlie so well as the king!\"] and our motherland bountifully maintained her children.  On that greensward, before the village (now foul and reeking with the squalid population whom commerce rears up,--the victims, as the movers, of the modern world) were assembled youth and age; for it was a holiday evening, and the stern Puritan had not yet risen to sour the face of Mirth.  Well clad in leathern jerkin, or even broadcloth, the young peasants vied with each other in quoits and wrestling; while the merry laughter of the girls, in their gay-coloured kirtles and ribboned hair, rose oft and cheerily to the ears of the cavalcade. From a gentle eminence beyond the village, and half veiled by trees, on which the first verdure of spring was budding (where now, around the gin-shop, gather the fierce and sickly children of toil and of discontent), rose the venerable walls of a monastery, and the chime of its heavy bell swung far and sweet over the pastoral landscape.  To the right of the road (where now stands the sober meeting-house) was one of those small shrines so frequent in Italy, with an image of the Virgin gaudily painted, and before it each cavalier in the procession halted an instant to cross himself and mutter an ave.  Beyond, still to the right, extended vast chains of woodland, interspersed with strips of pasture, upon which numerous flocks were grazing, with horses, as yet unbroken to bit and selle, that neighed and snorted as they caught scent of their more civilized brethren pacing up the road.  In front of the cavalcade rode two, evidently of superior rank to the rest,--the one small and slight, with his long hair flowing over his shoulders; and the other, though still young, many years older, and indicating his clerical profession by the absence of all love-locks, compensated by a curled and glossy beard, trimmed with the greatest care.  But the dress of the ecclesiastic was as little according to our modern notions of what beseems the Church as can well be conceived: his tunic and surcoat, of a rich amber, contrasted well with the clear darkness of his complexion; his piked shoes, or beakers, as they were called, turned up half-way to the knee; the buckles of his dress were of gold, inlaid with gems; and the housings of his horse, which was of great power, were edged with gold fringe. By the side of his steed walked a tall greyhound, upon which he ever and anon glanced with affection.  Behind these rode two gentlemen, whose golden spurs announced knighthood; and then followed a long train of squires and pages, richly clad and accoutred, bearing generally the Nevile badge of the Bull; though interspersed amongst the retinue might be seen the grim Boar's head, which Richard of Gloucester, in right of his duchy, had assumed as his cognizance.  \"Nay, sweet prince,\" said the ecclesiastic, \"I pray thee to consider that a greyhound is far more of a gentleman than any other of the canine species.  Mark his stately yet delicate length of limb, his sleek coat, his keen eye, his haughty neck.\"  \"These are but the externals, my noble friend.  Will the greyhound attack the lion, as our mastiff doth?  The true character of the gentleman is to know no fear, and to rush through all danger at the throat of his foe; wherefore I uphold the dignity of the mastiff above all his tribe, though others have a daintier hide and a statelier crest. Enough of such matters, archbishop,--we are nearing Middleham.\"  \"The saints be praised! for I am hungered,\" observed the archbishop, piously: \"but, sooth to say, my cook at the More far excelleth what we can hope to find at the board of my brother.  He hath some faults, our Warwick!  Hasty and careless, he hath not thought eno' of the blessings he might enjoy, and many a poor abbot hath daintier fare on his humble table.\"  \"Oh, George Nevile! who that heard thee, when thou talkest of hounds and interments, [entremets (side dishes)] would recognize the Lord Chancellor of England,--the most learned dignitary, the most subtle statesman?\"  \"And oh, Richard Plantagenet!\" retorted the archbishop, dropping the mincing and affected tone, which he, in common with the coxcombs of that day, usually assumed, \"who that heard thee when thou talkest of humility and devotion, would recognize the sternest heart and the most daring ambition God ever gave to prince?\"  Richard started at these words, and his eye shot fire as it met the keen calm glance of the prelate.  \"Nay, your Grace wrongs me,\" he said, gnawing his lip,--\"or I should not say wrongs, but flatters; for sternness and ambition are no vices in a Nevile's eyes.\"  \"Fairly answered, royal son,\" said the archbishop, laughing; \"but let us be frank.  Thou hast persuaded me to accompany thee to Lord Warwick as a mediator; the provinces in the North are disturbed; the intrigues of Margaret of Anjou are restless; the king reaps what he has sown in the Court of France, and, as Warwick foretold, the emissaries and gold of Louis are ever at work against his throne; the great barons are moody and discontented; and our liege King Edward is at last aware that, if the Earl of Warwick do not return to his councils, the first blast of a hostile trumpet may drive him from his throne.  Well, I attend thee: my fortunes are woven with those of York, and my interest and my loyalty go hand in hand.  Be equally frank with me.  Hast thou, Lord Richard, no interest to serve in this mission save that of the public weal?\"  \"Thou forgettest that the Lady Isabel is dearly loved by Clarence, and that I would fain see removed all barrier to his nuptial bliss.  But yonder rise the towers of Middleham.  Beloved walls, which sheltered my childhood! and, by holy Paul, a noble pile, which would resist an army, or hold one.\"  While thus conversed the prince and the archbishop, the Earl of Warwick, musing and alone, slowly paced the lofty terrace that crested the battlements of his outer fortifications.  In vain had that restless and powerful spirit sought content in retirement.  Trained from his childhood to active life, to move mankind to and fro at his beck, this single and sudden interval of repose in the prime of his existence, at the height of his fame, served but to swell the turbulent and dangerous passions to which all vent was forbidden.  The statesman of modern days has at least food for intellect in letters when deprived of action; but with all his talents, and thoroughly cultivated as his mind was in the camp, the council, and the state, the great earl cared for nothing in book-lore except some rude ballad that told of Charlemagne or Rollo.  The sports that had pleased the leisure of his earlier youth were tedious and flat to one snatched from so mighty a career.  His hound lay idle at his feet, his falcon took holiday on the perch, his jester was banished to the page's table.  Behold the repose of this great unlettered spirit!  But while his mind was thus debarred from its native sphere, all tended to pamper Lord Warwick's infirmity of pride.  The ungrateful Edward might forget him; but the king seemed to stand alone in that oblivion.  The mightiest peers, the most renowned knights, gathered to his hall. Middleham,--not Windsor nor Shene nor Westminster nor the Tower-- seemed the COURT OF ENGLAND.  As the Last of the Barons paced his terrace, far as his eye could reach, his broad domains extended, studded with villages and towns and castles swarming with his retainers.  The whole country seemed in mourning for his absence.  The name of Warwick was in all "]]]
