And I, as King of England, will set all Cymry free, and restore to the realm of Gryffyth the shires of Hereford and Worcester.  Ride fast, O Meredydd, and heed well all I have said.\"  \"Dost thou promise and swear, that wert thou king of England, Cymry should be free from all service?\"  \"Free as air, free as under Arthur and Uther: I swear it.  And remember well how Harold addressed the Cymrian chiefs, when he accepted Gryffyth's oaths of service.\"  \"Remember it--ay,\" cried Meredydd, his face lighting up with intense ire and revenge; \"the stern Saxon said, 'Heed well, ye chiefs of Cymry, and thou Gryffyth the King, that if again ye force, by ravage and rapine, by sacrilege and murther, the majesty of England to enter your borders, duty must be done: God grant that your Cymrian lion may leave us in peace--if not, it is mercy to Human life that bids us cut the talons, and draw the fangs.\"  \"Harold, like all calm and mild men, ever says less than he means,\" returned Algar; \"and were Harold king, small pretext would he need for cutting the talons and drawing the fangs.\"  \"It is well,\" said Meredydd, with a fierce smile.  \"I will now go to my men who are lodged yonder; and it is better that thou shouldst not be seen with me.\"  \"Right; so St. David be with you--and forget not a word of my message to Gryffyth my son-in-law.\"  \"Not a word,\" returned Meredydd, as with a wave of his hand he moved towards an hostelry, to which, as kept by one of their own countrymen, the Welch habitually resorted in the visits to the capital which the various intrigues and dissensions in their unhappy land made frequent.  The chief's train, which consisted of ten men, all of high birth, were not drinking in the tavern--for sorry customers to mine host were the abstemious Welch.  Stretched on the grass under the trees of an orchard that backed the hostelry, and utterly indifferent to all the rejoicings that animated the population of Southwark and London, they were listening to a wild song of the old hero-days from one of their number; and round them grazed the rough shagged ponies which they had used for their journey.  Meredydd, approaching, gazed round, and seeing no stranger was present, raised his hand to hush the song, and then addressed his countrymen briefly in Welch--briefly, but with a passion that was evident in his flashing eyes and vehement gestures. The passion was contagious; they all sprang to their feet with a low but fierce cry, and in a few moments they had caught and saddled their diminutive palfreys, while one of the band, who seemed singled out by Meredydd, sallied forth alone from the orchard, and took his way, on foot, to the bridge.  He did not tarry there long; at the sight of a single horseman, whom a shout of welcome, on that swarming thoroughfare, proclaimed to be Earl Harold, the Welcbman turned, and with a fleet foot regained his companions.  Meanwhile Harold, smilingly, returned the greetings he received, cleared the bridge, passed the suburbs, and soon gained the wild forest land that lay along the great Kentish road.  He rode somewhat slowly, for he was evidently in deep thought; and he had arrived about half-way towards Hilda's house when he heard behind quick pattering sounds, as of small unshod hoofs: he turned, and saw the Welchmen at the distance of some fifty yards.  But at that moment there passed, along the road in front, several persons bustling into London to share in the festivities of the day.  This seemed to disconcert the Welch in the rear, and, after a few whispered words, they left the high road and entered the forest land.  Various groups from time to time continued to pass along the thoroughfare.  But still, ever through the glades, Harold caught glimpses of the riders; now distant, now near. Sometimes he heard the snort of their small horses, and saw a fierce eye glaring through the bushes; then, as at the sight or sound of approaching passengers, the riders wheeled, and shot off through the brakes.  The Earl's suspicions were aroused; for (though he knew of no enemy to apprehend, and the extreme severity of the laws against robbers made the high roads much safer in the latter days of the Saxon domination than they were for centuries under that of the subsequent dynasty, when Saxon thegns themselves had turned kings of the greenwood,) the various insurrections in Edward's reign had necessarily thrown upon society many turbulent disbanded mercenaries.  Harold was unarmed, save the spear which, even on occasions of state, the Saxon noble rarely laid aside, and the ateghar in his belt; and, seeing now that the road had become deserted, he set spurs to his horse, and was just in sight of the Druid temple, when a javelin whizzed close by his breast, and another transfixed his horse, which fell head foremost to the ground.  The Earl gained his feet in an instant, and that haste was needed to save his life; for while he rose ten swords flashed around him.  The Welchmen had sprung from their palfreys as Harold's horse fell. Fortunately for him, only two of the party bore javelins, (a weapon which the Welch wielded with deadly skill,) and those already wasted, they drew their short swords, which were probably imitated from the Romans, and rushed upon him in simultaneous onset.  Versed in all the weapons of the time, with his right hand seeking by his spear to keep off the rush, with the ateghar in his left parrying the strokes aimed at him, the brave Earl transfixed the first assailant, and sore wounded the next; but his tunic was dyed red with three gashes, and his sole chance of life was in the power yet left him to force his way through the ring.  Dropping his spear, shifting his ateghar into the right hand, wrapping round his left arm his gonna as a shield, he sprang fiercely on the onslaught, and on the flashing swords.  Pierced to the heart fell one of his foes--dashed to the earth another--from the hand of a third (dropping his own ateghar) he wrenched the sword. Loud rose Harold's cry for aid, and swiftly he strode towards the hillock, turning back, and striking as he turned; and again fell a foe, and again new blood oozed through his own garb.  At that moment his cry was echoed by a shriek so sharp and so piercing that it startled the assailants, it arrested the assault; and, ere the unequal strife could be resumed, a woman was in the midst of the fray; a woman stood dauntless between the Earl and his foes.  \"Back! Edith.  Oh, God!  Back, back!\" cried the Earl, recovering all his strength in the sole fear which that strife had yet stricken into his bold heart; and drawing Edith aside with his strong arm, he again confronted the assailants.  \"Die!\" cried, in the Cymrian tongue, the fiercest of the foes, whose sword had already twice drawn the Earl's blood; \"Die, that Cymry may be free!\"  Meredydd sprang, with him sprang the survivors of his band; and, by a sudden movement, Edith had thrown herself on Harold's breast, leaving his right arm free, but sheltering his form with her own.  At that sight every sword rested still in air.  These Cymrians, hesitating not at the murder of the man whose death seemed to their false virtue a sacrifice due to their hopes of freedom, were still the descendants of Heroes, and the children of noble Song, and their swords were harmless against a woman.  The same pause which saved the life of Harold, saved that of Meredydd; for the Cymrian's lifted sword had left his breast defenceless, and Harold, despite his wrath, and his fears for Edith, touched by that sudden forbearance, forbore himself the blow.  \"Why seek ye my life?\" said he.  \"Whom in broad England hath Harold wronged?\"  That speech broke the charm, revived the suspense of vengeance.  With a sudden aim, Meredydd smote at the head which Edith's embrace left unprotected.  The sword shivered on the steel of that which parried the stroke, and the next moment, pierced to the heart, Meredydd fell to the earth, bathed in his gore.  Even as he fell, aid was at hand. The ceorls in the Roman house had caught the alarm, and were hurrying down the knoll, with arms snatched in haste, while a loud whoop broke from the forest land hard by; and a troop of horse, headed by Vebba, rushed through the bushes and brakes.  Those of the Welch still surviving, no longer animated by their fiery chief, turned on the instant, and fled with that wonderful speed of foot which characterised their active race; calling, as they fled, to their Welch pigmy steeds, which, snorting loud, and lashing out, came at once to the call.  Seizing the nearest at hand, the fugitives sprang to selle, while the animals unchosen paused by the corpses of their former riders, neighing piteously, and shaking their long manes.  And then, after wheeling round and round the coming horsemen, with many a plunge, and lash, and savage cry, they darted after their companions, and disappeared amongst the bushwood.  Some of the Kentish men gave chase to the fugitives, but in vain; for the nature of the ground favoured flight.  Vebba, and the rest, now joined by Hilda's lithsmen, gained the spot where Harold, bleeding fast, yet strove to keep his footing, and, forgetful of his own wounds, was joyfully assuring himself of Edith's safety.  Vebba dismounted, and recognising the Earl, exclaimed:  \"Saints in heaven! are we in tine?  You bleed--you faint!--Speak, Lord Harold.  How fares it?\"  \"Blood enow yet left here for our merrie England!\" said Harold, with a smile.  But as he spoke, his head drooped, and he was borne senseless into the house of Hilda.     CHAPTER II.   The Vala met them at the threshold, and testified so little surprise at the sight of the bleeding and unconscious Earl, that Vebba, who had heard strange tales of Hilda's unlawful"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7677"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings — Volume 06 (#3)"],["body","ts, half-suspected that those wild-looking foes, with their uncanny diminutive horses, were imps conjured by her to punish a wooer to her grandchild--who had been perhaps too successful in the wooing.  And fears so reasonable were not a little increased when Hilda, after leading the way up the steep ladder to the chamber in which Harold had dreamed his fearful dream, bade them all depart, and leave the wounded man to her care.  \"Not so,\" said Vebba, bluffly.  \"A life like this is not to be left in the hands of woman, or wicca.  I shall go back to the great town, and summon the Earl's own leach.  And I beg thee to heed, meanwhile, that every head in this house shall answer for Harold's.\"  The great Vala, and highborn Hleafdian, little accustomed to be accosted thus, turned round abruptly, with so stern an eye and so imperious a mien, that even the stout Kent man felt abashed.  She pointed to the door opening on the ladder, and said, briefly:  \"Depart!  Thy lord's life hath been saved already, and by woman. Depart!\"  \"Depart, and fear not for the Earl, brave and true friend in need,\" said Edith, looking up from Harold's pale lips, over which she bent; and her sweet voice so touched the good thegn, that, murmuring a blessing on her fair face, he turned and departed.  Hilda then proceeded, with a light and skilful hand, to examine the wounds of her patient.  She opened the tunic, and washed away the blood from four gaping orifices on the breast and shoulders.  And as she did so, Edith uttered a faint cry, and falling on her knees, bowed her head over the drooping hand, and kissed it with stifling emotions, of which perhaps grateful joy was the strongest; for over the heart of Harold was punctured, after the fashion of the Saxons, a device--and that device was the knot of betrothal, and in the centre of the knot was graven the word \"Edith.\"     CHAPTER III.   Whether, owing to Hilda's runes, or to the merely human arts which accompanied them, the Earl's recovery was rapid, though the great loss of blood he had sustained left him awhile weak and exhausted.  But, perhaps, he blessed the excuse which detained him still in the house of Hilda, and under the eyes of Edith.  He dismissed the leach sent to him by Vebba, and confided, not without reason, to the Vala's skill.  And how happily went his hours beneath the old Roman roof!  It was not without a superstition, more characterised, however, by tenderness than awe, that Harold learned that Edith had been undefinably impressed with a foreboding of danger to her betrothed, and all that morning she had watched his coming from the old legendary hill.  Was it not in that watch that his good Fylgia had saved his life?  Indeed, there seemed a strange truth in Hilda's assertions, that in the form of his betrothed, his tutelary spirit lived and guarded.  For smooth every step, and bright every day, in his career, since their troth had been plighted.  And gradually the sweet superstition had mingled with human passion to hallow and refine it. There was a purity and a depth in the love of these two, which, if not uncommon in women, is most rare in men.  Harold, in sober truth, had learned to look on Edith as on his better angel; and, calming his strong manly heart in the hour of temptation, would have recoiled, as a sacrilege, from aught that could have sullied that image of celestial love.  With a noble and sublime patience, of which perhaps only a character so thoroughly English in its habits of self-control and steadfast endurance could have been capable, he saw the months and the years glide away, and still contented himself with hope;--hope, the sole godlike joy that belongs to men!  As the opinion of an age influences even those who affect to despise it, so, perhaps, this holy and unselfish passion was preserved and guarded by that peculiar veneration for purity which formed the characteristic fanaticism of the last days of the Anglo-Saxons,--when still, as Aldhelm had previously sung in Latin less barbarous than perhaps any priest in the reign of Edward could command:      \"Virginitas castam servans sine crimine carnem      Caetera virtutem vincit praeconia laudi--      Spiritus altithroni templum sibi vindicat almus;\" [149]  when, amidst a great dissoluteness of manners, alike common to Church and laity, the opposite virtues were, as is invariable in such epochs of society, carried by the few purer natures into heroic extremes. \"And as gold, the adorner of the world, springs from the sordid bosom of earth, so chastity, the image of gold, rose bright and unsullied from the clay of human desire.\" [150]  And Edith, though yet in the tenderest flush of beautiful youth, had, under the influence of that sanctifying and scarce earthly affection, perfected her full nature as woman.  She had learned so to live in Harold's life, that--less, it seemed, by study than intuition--a knowledge graver than that which belonged to her sex and her time, seemed to fall upon her soul--fall as the sunlight falls on the blossoms, expanding their petals, and brightening the glory of their hues.  Hitherto, living under the shade of Hilda's dreary creed, Edith, as we have seen, had been rather Christian by name and instinct than acquainted with the doctrines of the Gospel, or penetrated by its faith.  But the soul of Harold lifted her own out of the Valley of the Shadow up to the Heavenly Hill.  For the character of their love was so pre-eminently Christian, so, by the circumstances that surrounded it--so by hope and self-denial, elevated out of the empire, not only of the senses, but even of that sentiment which springs from them, and which made the sole refined and poetic element of the heathen's love, that but for Christianity it would have withered and died.  It required all the aliment of prayer; it needed that patient endurance which comes from the soul's consciousness of immortality; it could not have resisted earth, but from the forts and armies it won from heaven. Thus from Harold might Edith be said to have taken her very soul.  And with the soul, and through the soul, woke the mind from the mists of childhood.  In the intense desire to be worthy the love of the foremost man of her land; to be the companion of his mind, as well as the mistress of his heart, she had acquired, she knew not how, strange stores of thought, and intelligence, and pure, gentle wisdom.  In opening to her confidence his own high aims and projects, he himself was scarcely conscious how often he confided but to consult--how often and how insensibly she coloured his reflections and shaped his designs. Whatever was highest and purest, that, Edith ever, as by instinct, beheld as the wisest.  She grew to him like a second conscience, diviner than his own.  Each, therefore, reflected virtue on the other, as planet illumines planet.  All these years of probation then, which might have soured a love less holy, changed into weariness a love less intense, had only served to wed them more intimately soul to soul; and in that spotless union what happiness there was! what rapture in word and glance, and the slight, restrained caress of innocence, beyond all the transports love only human can bestow!     CHAPTER IV.   It was a bright still summer noon, when Harold sate with Edith amidst the columns of the Druid temple, and in the shade which those vast and mournful relics of a faith departed cast along the sward.  And there, conversing over the past, and planning the future, they had sate long, when Hilda approached from the house, and entering the circle, leant her arm upon the altar of the war-god, and gazing on Harold with a calm triumph in her aspect, said:  \"Did I not smile, son of Godwin, when, with thy short-sighted wisdom, thou didst think to guard thy land and secure thy love, by urging the monk-king to send over the seas for the Atheling?  Did I not tell thee, 'Thou dost right, for in obeying thy judgment thou art but the instrument of fate; and the coming of the Atheling shall speed thee nearer to the ends of thy life, but not from the Atheling shalt thou take the crown of thy love, and not by the Atheling shall the throne of Athelstan be filled'?\"  \"Alas,\" said Harold, rising in agitation, \"let me not hear of mischance to that noble prince.  He seemed sick and feeble when I parted from him; but joy is a great restorer, and the air of the native land gives quick health to the exile.\"  \"Hark!\" said Hilda, \"you hear the passing bell for the soul of the son of Ironsides!\"  The mournful knell, as she spoke, came dull from the roofs of the city afar, borne to their ears by the exceeding stillness of the atmosphere.  Edith crossed herself, and murmured a prayer according to the custom of the age; then raising her eyes to Harold, she murmured, as she clasped her hands:  \"Be not saddened, Harold; hope still.\"  \"Hope!\" repeated Hilda, rising proudly from her recumbent position, \"Hope! in that knell from St. Paul's, dull indeed is thine ear, O Harold, if thou hearest not the joy-bells that inaugurate a future king!\"  The Earl started; his eyes shot fire; his breast heaved.  \"Leave us, Edith,\" said Hilda, in a low voice; and after watching her grandchild's slow reluctant steps descend the knoll, she turned to Harold, and leading him towards the gravestone of the Saxon chief, said:  \"Rememberest thou the spectre that rose from this mound?--rememberest thou the dream that followed it?\"  \"The spectre, or deceit of mine eye, I remember well,\" answered the Earl; \"the dream, not;--or only in confused and jarring fragments.\"  \"I told thee then, that I could not unriddle the dream by the light of the moment; and that the dead who slept below never appeared to men, save for some portent of doom to the house of Cerdic.  The portent is fulfilled; the Heir of Cerdic is no more.  To whom appeared the great Scin-laeca, but to him who shall lead a new race of kings to the Saxon throne!\"  Harold breathed hard, and the colour mounted bright"]]]
