FREEDOM PROCLAIMED TO ALL.   While mentally revolving the question of Emancipation--now, evidently \"coming to a head,\"--no inconsiderable portion of Mr. Lincoln's thoughts centered upon, and his perplexities grew out of, his assumption that the \"physical difference\" between the Black and White--the  African and Caucasian races, precluded the idea of their living together in the one land as Free men and equals.  In his speeches during the great Lincoln-Douglas debate we have seen this idea frequently advanced, and so, in his later public utterances as President.  As in his appeal to the Congressional delegations from the Border-States on the 12th of July, 1862, he had held out to them the hope that \"the Freed people will not be so reluctant to go\" to his projected colony in South America, when their \"numbers shall be large enough to be company and encouragement for one another,\" so, at a later date--on the 14th of August following--he appealed to the Colored Free men themselves to help him found a proposed Negro colony in New Granada, and thus aid in the solution of this part of the knotty problem, by the disenthrallment of the new race from its unhappy environments here.  The substance of the President's interesting address, at the White House, to the delegation of Colored men, for whom he had sent, was thus reported at the time:  \"Having all been seated, the President, after a few preliminary observations, informed them that a sum of money had been appropriated by Congress, and placed at his disposition, for the purpose of aiding the colonization in some country of the people, or a portion of them, of African descent, thereby making it his duty, as it had for a long time been his inclination, to favor that cause; and why, he asked, should the people of your race be colonized, and where?  \"Why should they leave this Country?  This is perhaps the first question for proper consideration.  You and we are different races.  We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races.  Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss; but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think. Your race suffers very greatly, many of them by living among us, while ours suffers from your presence.  In a word we suffer on each side.  If this is admitted, it affords a reason, at least, why we should be separated.  You here are Freemen, I suppose?  \"A VOICE--Yes, Sir.  \"THE PRESIDENT--Perhaps you have long been free, or all your lives. Your race are suffering, in my judgment, the greatest wrong inflicted on any people.  But even when you cease to be Slaves, you are yet far removed from being placed on an equality with the White race.  You are cut off from many of the advantages which the other race enjoys.  The aspiration of men is to enjoy equality with the best when free; but on this broad continent not a single man of your race is made the equal of a single man of ours.  Go where you are treated the best, and the ban is still upon you.  I do not propose to discuss this, but to present it as a fact, with which we have to deal.  I cannot alter it if I would.  It is a fact about which we all think and feel alike, I and you.  We look to our condition.  \"Owing to the existence of the two races on this continent, I need not recount to you the effects upon White men, growing out of the institution of Slavery.  I believe in its general evil effects on the White race.  See our present condition--the Country engaged in War!  our white men cutting one another's throats--none knowing how far it will extend--and then consider what we know to be the truth.  But for your race among us there could not be War, although many men engaged on either side do not care for you one way or the other.  Nevertheless, I repeat, without the institution of Slavery, and the Colored race as a basis, the War could not have an existence.  It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated.  \"I know that there are Free men among you who, even if they could better their condition, are not as much inclined to go out of the Country as those who, being Slaves, could obtain their Freedom on this condition. I suppose one of the principal difficulties in the way of colonization is that the free colored man cannot see that his comfort would be advanced by it.  You may believe that you can live in Washington, or elsewhere in the United States, the remainder of your life; perhaps more so than you can in any foreign country, and hence you may come to the conclusion that you have nothing to do with the idea of going to a foreign country.  \"This is, (I speak in no unkind sense) an extremely selfish view of the case.  But you ought to do something to help those who are not so fortunate as yourselves.  There is an unwillingness on the part of our People, harsh as it may be, for you free Colored people to remain with us.  Now if you could give a start to the White people you would open a wide door for many to be made free.  If we deal with those who are not free at the beginning, and whose intellects are clouded by Slavery, we have very poor material to start with.  \"If intelligent Colored men, such as are before me, could move in this matter, much might be accomplished.  It is exceedingly important that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as White men, and not those who have been systematically oppressed.  There is much to encourage you.  \"For the sake of your race you should sacrifice something of your present comfort for the purpose of being as grand in that respect as the White people.  It is a cheering thought throughout life, that something can be done to ameliorate the condition of those who have been subject to the hard usages of the World.  It is difficult to make a man miserable while he feels he is worthy of himself and claims kindred to the great God who made him.  \"In the American Revolutionary War, sacrifices were made by men engaged in it, but they were cheered by the future.  General Washington himself endured greater physical hardships than if he had remained a British subject, yet he was a happy man, because he was engaged in benefiting his race, in doing something for the children of his neighbors, having none of his own.  \"The Colony of Liberia has been in existence a long time.  In a certain sense it is a success.  The old President of Liberia, Roberts, has just been with me the first time I ever saw him.  He says they have, within the bounds of that Colony, between three and four hundred thousand people, or more than in some of our old States, such as Rhode Island, or Delaware, or in some of our newer States, and less than in some of our larger ones.  They are not all American colonists or their descendants. Something less than 12,000 have been sent thither from this Country. Many of the original settlers have died, yet, like people elsewhere, their offspring outnumber those deceased.  \"The question is, if the Colored people are persuaded to go anywhere, why not there?  One reason for unwillingness to do so is that some of you would rather remain within reach of the country of your nativity.  I do not know how much attachment you may have toward our race.  It does not strike me that you have the greatest reason to love them.  But still you are attached to them at all events.  \"The place I am thinking about having for a colony, is in Central America.  It is nearer to us than Liberia--not much more than one-fourth as far as Liberia, and within seven days' run by steamers.  Unlike Liberia, it is a great line of travel--it is a highway.  The country is a very excellent one for any people, and with great natural resources and advantages, and especially because of the similarity of climate with your native soil, thus being suited to your physical condition.  \"The particular place I have in view, is to be a great highway from the Atlantic or Caribbean Sea to the Pacific Ocean, and this particular place has all the advantages for a colony.  On both sides there are harbors among the finest in the World.  Again, there is evidence of very rich coal mines.  A certain amount of coal is valuable in any country. Why I attach so much importance to coal is, it will afford an opportunity to the inhabitants for immediate employment till they get ready to settle permanently in their homes.  \"If you take colonists where there is no good landing, there is a bad show; and so, where there is nothing to cultivate, and of which to make a farm.  But if something is started so that you can get your daily bread as soon as you reach there, it is a great advantage.  Coal land is the best thing I know of, with which to commence an enterprise.  \"To return--you have been talked to upon this subject, and told that a speculation is intended by gentlemen who have an interest in the country, including the coal mines.  We have been mistaken all our lives if we do not know Whites, as well as Blacks, look to their self-interest.  Unless among those deficient of intellect, everybody you trade with makes something.  You meet with these things here and everywhere.  If such persons have what will be an advantage to them, the question is, whether it cannot be made of advantage to you?  \"You are intelligent, and know that success does not as much depend on external help, as on self-reliance.  Much, therefore, depends upon yourselves.  As to the coal mines, I think I see the means available for your self-reliance.  I shall, if I get a sufficient number of you engaged, have provision made that you shall not be wronged.  If you will engage in the enterprise, I will spend some of the money intrusted to me.  I am not sure you will succeed.  The Government may lose the money, but"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7137"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 5 (#1)"],["body","cannot succeed unless we try; but we think, with care, we can succeed.  \"The political affairs in Central America are not in quite as satisfactory condition as I wish.  There are contending factions in that quarter; but it is true, all the factions are agreed alike on the subject of colonization, and want it; and are more generous than we are here.  To your Colored race they have no objection.  Besides, I would endeavor to have you made equals, and have the best assurance that you should be the equals of the best.  \"The practical thing I want to ascertain is, whether I can get a number of able-bodied men, with their wives and children, who are willing to go, when I present evidence of encouragement and protection.  Could I get a hundred tolerably intelligent men, with their wives and children, and able to 'cut their own fodder' so to speak?  Can I have fifty?  If I could find twenty-five able-bodied men, with a mixture of women and children--good things in the family relation, I think I could make a successful commencement.  \"I want you to let me know whether this can be done or not.  This is the practical part of my wish to see you.  These are subjects of very great importance--worthy of a month's study, of a speech delivered in an hour. I ask you, then, to consider seriously, not as pertaining to yourselves merely, nor for your race, and ours, for the present time, but as one of the things, if successfully managed, for the good of mankind--not confined to the present generation, but as:                \"From age to age descends the lay                To millions yet to be,                Till far its echoes roll away                Into eternity.\"'  President Lincoln's well-meant colored colonization project, however, fell through, owing partly to opposition to it in Central America, and partly to the very natural and deeply-rooted disinclination of the Colored free men to leave the land of their birth.  Meanwhile, limited Military Emancipation of Slaves was announced and regulated, on the 22d July, 1862, by the following Executive Instructions, which were issued from the War Department by order of the President--the issue of which was assigned by Jefferson Davis as one reason for his Order of August 1, 1862, directing \"that the commissioned officers of Pope's and Steinwehr's commands be not entitled, when captured, to be treated as soldiers and entitled to the benefit of the cartel of exchange:\"   \"WAR DEPARTMENT, \"WASHINGTON, D.C., July 22, 1862.  \"First.  Ordered that Military Commanders within the States of Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas, in an orderly manner seize and use any property, real or personal, which may be necessary or convenient for their several commands, for supplies, or for other Military purposes; and that while property may be destroyed for proper Military objects, none shall be destroyed in wantonness or malice.  \"Second.  That Military and Naval Commanders shall employ as laborers, within and from said States, so many Persons of African descent as can be advantageously used for Military or Naval purposes, giving them reasonable wages for their labor.  \"Third.  That, as to both property, and Persons of African descent, accounts shall be kept sufficiently accurate and in detail to show quantities and amounts, and from whom both property and such Persons shall have come, as a basis upon which compensation can be made in proper cases; and the several departments of this Government shall attend to and perform their appropriate parts towards the execution of these orders.  \"By Order of the President:                           \"EDWIN M. STANTON,                          \"Secretary of War.\"   On the 9th of August, 1862, Major General McClellan promulgated the Executive Order of July 22, 1862, from his Headquarters at Harrison's Landing, Va., with certain directions of his own, among which were the following:  \"Inhabitants, especially women and children, remaining peaceably at their homes, must not be molested; and wherever commanding officers find families peculiarly exposed in their persons or property to marauding from this Army, they will, as heretofore, so far as they can do with safety and without detriment to the service, post guards for their protection.  \"In protecting private property, no reference is intended to Persons held to service or labor by reason of African Descent.  Such Persons will be regarded by this Army, as they heretofore have been, as occupying simply a peculiar legal status under State laws, which condition the Military authorities of the United States are not required to regard at all in districts where Military operations are made necessary by the rebellious action of the State governments.  \"Persons subject to suspicion of hostile purposes, residing or being near our Forces, will be, as heretofore, subject to arrest and detention, until the cause or necessity is removed.  All such arrested parties will be sent, as usual, to the Provost-Marshal General, with a statement of the facts in each case.  \"The General Commanding takes this occasion to remind the officers and soldiers of this Army that we are engaged in supporting the Constitution and the Laws of the United States and suppressing Rebellion against their authority; that we are not engaged in a War of rapine, revenge, or subjugation; that this is not a contest against populations, but against armed forces and political organizations; that it is a struggle carried on with the United States, and should be conducted by us upon the highest principles known to Christian civilization.  \"Since this Army commenced active operations, Persons of African descent, including those held to service or labor under State laws, have always been received, protected, and employed as laborers at wages. Hereafter it shall be the duty of the Provost-Marshal General to cause lists to be made of all persons of African descent employed in this Army as laborers for Military purposes--such lists being made sufficiently accurate and in detail to show from whom such persons shall have come.  \"Persons so subject and so employed have always understood that after being received into the Military service of the United States, in any capacity, they could never be reclaimed by their former holders.  Except upon such understanding on their part, the order of the President, as to this class of Persons, would be inoperative.  The General Commanding therefore feels authorized to declare to all such employees, that they will receive permanent Military protection against any compulsory return to a condition of servitude.\"  Public opinion was now rapidly advancing, under the pressure of Military necessity, and the energetic efforts of the immediate Emancipationists, to a belief that Emancipation by Presidential Proclamation would be wise and efficacious as an instrumentality toward subduing the Rebellion; that it must come, sooner or later--and the sooner, the better.  Indeed, great fault was found, by some of these, with what they characterized as President Lincoln's \"obstinate slowness\" to come up to their advanced ideas on the subject.  He was even accused of failing to execute existing laws touching confiscation of Slaves of Rebels coming within the lines of the Union Armies.  On the 19th of August, 1862, a letter was addressed to him by Horace Greeley which concluded thus:  \"On the face of this wide Earth, Mr. President, there is not one disinterested, determined, intelligent champion of the Union Cause who does not feel that all attempts to put down the Rebellion, and at the same time uphold its inciting cause, are preposterous and futile--that the Rebellion, if crushed out to-morrow, would be renewed within a year if Slavery were left in full vigor--that Army officers, who remain to this day devoted to Slavery, can at best be but half-way loyal to the Union--and that every hour of deference to Slavery is an hour of added and deepened peril to the Union.  \"I appeal to the testimony of your embassadors in Europe.  It is freely at your service, not mine.  Ask them to tell you candidly whether the seeming subserviency of your policy to the Slaveholding, Slavery-upholding interest, is not the perplexity, the despair, of Statesmen of all parties; and be admonished by the general answer.  \"I close, as I began, with the statement that what an immense majority of the loyal millions of your countrymen require of you, is a frank, declared, unqualified, ungrudging execution of the Laws of the Land, more especially of the Confiscation Act.  That Act gives Freedom to the Slaves of Rebels coming within our lines, or whom those lines may at any time inclose.  We ask you to render it due obedience by publicly requiring all your subordinates to recognize and obey it.  \"The Rebels are everywhere using the late Anti-Negro riots in the North --as they have long used your officers' treatment of Negroes in the South--to convince the Slaves that they have nothing to hope from a Union success--that we mean in that case to sell them into a bitter Bondage to defray the cost of the War.  \"Let them impress this as a truth on the great mass of their ignorant and credulous Bondmen, and the Union will never be restored--never.  We can not conquer ten millions of people united in solid phalanx against us, powerfully aided by Northern sympathizers and European allies.  \"We must have scouts, guides, spies, cooks, teamsters, diggers, and choppers, from the Blacks of the South--whether we allow them to fight for us or not--or we shall be baffled and repelled.  \"As one of the Millions who would gladly have avoided this struggle, at any sacrifice but that of principle and honor, but who now feel that the triumph of the Union is indispensable not only to the existence of our Country, but to the well-being of mankind, I entreat you to render a hearty and unequivocal obedience to the Law of the Land.
