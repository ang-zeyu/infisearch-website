He resumed:  \"Thy brother Tostig, as so nearly allied to my House, would, I am advised, back my claims; and wert thou absent from England, Tostig, I conceive, would be in thy place as the head of the great party of Godwin.  But to prove how little I care for thy brother's aid compared with thine, and how implicitly I count on thee, I have openly told thee what a wilier plotter would have concealed--viz., the danger to which thy brother is menaced in his own earldom.  To the point, then, I pass at once.  I might, as my ransomed captive, detain thee here, until, without thee, I had won my English throne, and I know that thou alone couldst obstruct my just claims, or interfere with the King's will, by which that appanage will be left to me.  Nevertheless, I unbosom myself to thee, and would owe my crown solely to thine aid.  I pass on to treat with thee, dear Harold, not as lord with vassal, but as prince with prince.  On thy part, thou shalt hold for me the castle of Dover, to yield to my fleet when the hour comes; thou shalt aid me in peace, and through thy National Witan, to succeed to Edward, by whose laws I will reign in all things conformably with the English rites, habits, and decrees.  A stronger king to guard England from the Dane, and a more practised head to improve her prosperity, I am vain eno' to say thou wilt not find in Christendom.  On my part, I offer to thee my fairest daughter, Adeliza, to whom thou shalt be straightway betrothed: thine own young unwedded sister, Thyra, thou shalt give to one of my greatest barons: all the lands, dignities, and possessions thou holdest now, thou shalt still retain; and if, as I suspect, thy brother Tostig cannot keep his vast principality north the Humber, it shall pass to thee.  Whatever else thou canst demand in guarantee of my love and gratitude, or so to confirm thy power that thou shalt rule over thy countships as free and as powerful as the great Counts of Provence or Anjou reign in France over theirs, subject only to the mere form of holding in fief to the Suzerain, as I, stormy subject, hold Normandy under Philip of France,--shall be given to thee.  In truth, there will be two kings in England, though in name but one. And far from losing by the death of Edward, thou shalt gain by the subjection of every meaner rival, and the cordial love of thy grateful William.--Splendour of God, Earl, thou keepest me long for thine answer!\"  \"What thou offerest,\" said the Earl, fortifying himself with the resolution of the previous night, and compressing his lips, livid with rage, \"is beyond my deserts, and all that the greatest chief under royalty could desire.  But England is not Edward's to leave, nor mine to give: its throne rests with the Witan.\"  \"And the Witan rests with thee,\" exclaimed William sharply.  \"I ask but for possibilities, man; I ask but all thine influence on my behalf; and if it be less than I deem, mine is the loss.  What dost thou resign?  I will not presume to menace thee; but thou wouldst indeed despise my folly, if now, knowing my designs, I let thee forth --not to aid, but betray them.  I know thou lovest England, so do I. Thou deemest me a foreigner; true, but the Norman and Dane are of precisely the same origin.  Thou, of the race of Canute, knowest how popular was the reign of that King.  Why should William's be less so? Canute had no right whatsoever, save that of the sword.  My right will be kinship to Edward--Edward's wish in my favour--the consent through thee of the Witan--the absence of all other worthy heir--my wife's clear descent from Alfred, which, in my children, restore the Saxon line, through its purest and noblest ancestry, to the throne.  Think over all this, and then wilt thou tell me that I merit not this crown?\"  Harold yet paused, and the fiery Duke resumed:  \"Are the terms I give not tempting eno' to my captive--to the son of the great Godwin, who, no doubt falsely, but still by the popular voice of all Europe, had power of life and death over my cousin Alfred and my Norman knights? or dost thou thyself covet the English crown; and is it to a rival that I have opened my heart?\"  \"Nay,\" said Harold in the crowning effort of his new and fatal lesson in simulation.  \"Thou hast convinced me, Duke William: let it be as thou sayest.\"  The Duke gave way to his joy by a loud exclamation, and then recapitulated the articles of the engagement, to which Harold simply bowed his head.  Amicably then the Duke embraced the Earl, and the two returned towards the tent.  While the steeds were brought forth, William took the opportunity to draw Odo apart; and, after a short whispered conference, the prelate hastened to his barb, and spurred fast to Bayeux in advance of the party.  All that day, and all that night, and all the next morn till noon, courtiers and riders went abroad, north and south, east and west, to all the more famous abbeys and churches in Normandy, and holy and awful was the spoil with which they returned for the ceremony of the next day.     CHAPTER VII.   The stately mirth of the evening banquet seemed to Harold as the malign revel of some demoniac orgy.  He thought he read in every face the exultation over the sale of England.  Every light laugh in the proverbial ease of the social Normans rang on his ear like the joy of a ghastly Sabbat.  All his senses preternaturally sharpened to that magnetic keenness in which we less hear and see than conceive and divine, the lowest murmur William breathed in the ear of Odo boomed clear to his own; the slightest interchange of glance between some dark-browed priest and large-breasted warrior, flashed upon his vision.  The irritation of his recent and neglected wound combined with his mental excitement to quicken, yet to confuse, his faculties. Body and soul were fevered.  He floated, as it were, between a delirium and a dream.  Late in the evening he was led into the chamber where the Duchess sat alone with Adeliza and her second son William--a boy who had the red hair and florid hues of the ancestral Dane, but was not without a certain bold and strange kind of beauty, and who, even in childhood, all covered with broidery and gems, betrayed the passion for that extravagant and fantastic foppery for which William the Red King, to the scandal of Church and pulpit, exchanged the decorous pomp of his father's generation.  A formal presentation of Harold to the little maid was followed by a brief ceremony of words, which conveyed what to the scornful sense of the Earl seemed the mockery of betrothal between infant and bearded man.  Glozing congratulations buzzed around him; then there was a flash of lights on his dizzy eyes, he found himself moving through a corridor between Odo and William.  He was in his room hung with arras and strewed with rushes; before him in niches, various images of the Virgin, the Archangel Michael, St. Stephen, St. Peter, St. John, St. Valery; and from the bells in the monastic edifice hard by tolled the third watch [201] of the night--the narrow casement was out of reach, high in the massive wall, and the starlight was darkened by the great church tower.  Harold longed for air.  All his earldom had he given at that moment, to feel the cold blast of his native skies moaning round his Saxon wolds.  He opened his door, and looked forth.  A lanthorn swung on high from the groined roof of the corridor.  By the lanthorn stood a tall sentry in arms, and its gleam fell red upon an iron grate that jealously closed the egress.  The Earl closed the door, and sat down on his bed, covering his face with his clenched hand.  The veins throbbed in every pulse, his own touch seemed to him like fire.  The prophecies of Hilda on the fatal night by the bautastein, which had decided him to reject the prayer of Gurth, the fears of Edith, and the cautions of Edward, came back to him, dark, haunting, and overmasteringly.  They rose between him and his sober sense, whenever he sought to re-collect his thoughts, now to madden him with the sense of his folly in belief, now to divert his mind from the perilous present to the triumphant future they foretold; and of all the varying chaunts of the Vala, ever two lines seemed to burn into his memory, and to knell upon his ear, as if they contained the counsel they ordained him to pursue:      \"GUILE BY GUILE OPPOSE, and never      Crown and brow shall Force dissever!\"  So there he sat, locked and rigid, not reclining, not disrobing, till in that posture a haggard, troubled, fitful sleep came over him; nor did he wake till the hour of prime [202], when ringing bells and tramping feet, and the hum of prayer from the neighbouring chapel, roused him into waking yet more troubled, and well-nigh as dreamy. But now Godrith and Haco entered the room, and the former inquired with some surprise in his tone, if he had arranged with the Duke to depart that day; \"For,\" said he, \"the Duke's hors-thegn has just been with me, to say that the Duke himself, and a stately retinue, are to accompany you this evening towards Harfleur, where a ship will be in readiness for our transport; and I know that the chamberlain (a courteous and pleasant man) is going round to my fellow-thegns in your train, with gifts of hawks, and chains, and broidered palls.\"  \"It is so,\" said Haco, in answer to Harold's brightening and appealing eye.  \"Go then, at once, Godrith,\" exclaimed the Earl, bounding to his feet, \"have all in order to part at the first break of the trump.  Never, I ween, did trump sound so cheerily as the blast that shall announce our return to England.  Haste--haste!\"  As Godrith, pleased in the Earl's pleasure, though himself already much fascinated by the honours he had received and the splendor he had witnessed, withdrew, Haco said, \"Thou has taken my counsel, noble"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7680"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 09 (#8)"],["body","insman?\"  \"Question me not, Haco!  Out of my memory, all that hath passed here!\"  \"Not yet,\" said Haco, with that gloomy and intense seriousness of voice and aspect, which was so at variance with his years, and which impressed all he said with an indescribable authority.  \"Not yet; for even while the chamberlain went his round with the parting gifts, I, standing in the angle of the wall in the yard, heard the Duke's deep whisper to Roger Bigod, who has the guard of the keape, 'Have the men all armed at noon in the passage below the council-hall, to mount at the stamp of my foot: and if then I give thee a prisoner--wonder not, but lodge him--' The Duke paused; and Bigod said, 'Where, my liege?' And the Duke answered fiercely, 'Where? why, where but in the Tour noir?--where but in the cell in which Malvoisin rotted out his last hour?'  Not yet, then, let the memory of Norman wile pass away; let the lip guard the freedom still.\"  All the bright native soul that before Haco spoke had dawned gradually back on the Earl's fair face, now closed itself up, as the leaves of a poisoned flower; and the pupil of the eye receding, left to the orb that secret and strange expression which had baffled all readers of the heart in the look of his impenetrable father.  \"Guile by guile oppose!\" he muttered vaguely; then started, clenched his hand, and smiled.  In a few moments, more than the usual levee of Norman nobles thronged into the room; and what with the wonted order of the morning, in the repast, the church service of tierce, and a ceremonial visit to Matilda, who confirmed the intelligence that all was in preparation for his departure, and charged him with gifts of her own needlework to his sister the Queen, and various messages of gracious nature, the time waxed late into noon without his having yet seen either William or Odo.  He was still with Matilda, when the Lords Fitzosborne and Raoul de Tancarville entered in full robes of state, and with countenances unusually composed and grave, and prayed the Earl to accompany them into the Duke's presence.  Harold obeyed in silence, not unprepared for covert danger, by the formality of the counts, as by the warnings of Haco; but, indeed, undivining the solemnity of the appointed snare.  On entering the lofty hall, he beheld William seated in state; his sword of office in his hand, his ducal robe on his imposing form, and with that peculiarly erect air of the head which he assumed upon all ceremonial occasions [203].  Behind him stood Odo of Bayeux, in aube and gallium; some score of the Duke's greatest vassals; and at a little distance from the throne chair, was what seemed a table; or vast chest, covered all over with cloth of gold.  Small time for wonder or self-collection did the Duke give the Saxon.  \"Approach, Harold,\" said he, in the full tones of that voice, so singularly effective in command; \"approach, and without fear, as without regret.  Before the members of this noble assembly--all witnesses of thy faith, and all guarantees of mine--I summon thee to confirm by oath the promises thou mad'st me yesterday; namely, to aid me to obtain the kingdom of England on the death of King Edward, my cousin; to marry my daughter Adeliza; and to send thy sister hither, that I may wed her, as we agreed, to one of my worthiest and prowest counts.  Advance thou, Odo, my brother, and repeat to the noble Earl the Norman form by which he will take the oath.\"  Then Odo stood forth by that mysterious receptacle covered with the cloth of gold, and said briefly, \"Thou wilt swear, as far as is in thy power, to fulfil thy agreement with William, Duke of the Normans, if thou live, and God aid thee; and in witness of that oath thou wilt lay thy hand upon the reliquaire,\" pointing to a small box that lay on the cloth of gold.  All this was so sudden--all flashed so rapidly upon the Earl, whose natural intellect, however great, was, as we have often seen, more deliberate than prompt--so thoroughly was the bold heart, which no siege could have sapped, taken by surprise and guile--so paramount through all the whirl and tumult of his mind, rose the thought of England irrevocably lost, if he who alone could save her was in the Norman dungeons--so darkly did all Haco's fears, and his own just suspicions, quell and master him, that mechanically, dizzily, dreamily, he laid his hand on the reliquaire, and repeated, with automaton lips:  \"If I live, and if God aid me to it!\"  Then all the assembly repeated solemnly:  \"God aid him!\"  And suddenly, at a sign from William, Odo and Raoul de Tancarville raised the gold cloth, and the Duke's voice bade Harold look below.  As when man descends from the gilded sepulchre to the loathsome charnel, so at the lifting of that cloth, all the dread ghastliness of Death was revealed.  There, from abbey and from church, from cyst and from shrine, had been collected all the relics of human nothingness in which superstition adored the mementos of saints divine; there lay, pell mell and huddled, skeleton and mummy--the dry dark skin, the white gleaming bones of the dead, mockingly cased in gold, and decked with rubies; there, grim fingers protruded through the hideous chaos, and pointed towards the living man ensnared; there, the skull grinned scoff under the holy mitre;--and suddenly rushed back, luminous and searing upon Harold's memory, the dream long forgotten, or but dimly remembered in the healthful business of life--the gibe and the wirble of the dead men's bones.  \"At that sight,\" say the Norman chronicles, \"the Earl shuddered and trembled.\"  \"Awful, indeed, thine oath, and natural thine emotion,\" said the Duke; \"for in that cyst are all those relics which religion deems the holiest in our land.  The dead have heard thine oath, and the saints even now record it in the halls of heaven!  Cover again the holy bones!\""]]]
