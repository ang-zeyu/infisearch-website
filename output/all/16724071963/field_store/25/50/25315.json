In his great address at Bethel he held out the hope to Israel that God might forgive His people for their crimes and sins if they began to lead godly lives. His continued failure to impress the people with this message, however, finally led him to the belief that God would measure out the severest justice to Israel, in accordance with their sins, and without mercy.  Amos had become a well-known figure at all the sanctuaries. Most of the people thought him to be one of those wandering dervishes, known as \"Sons of the Prophets,\" who made their living by a kind of fortune telling, or forecasting the future, as did Samuel in the early days when he told Saul where the lost asses were; only, that Amos was one of the Sons of the Prophets run mad, judging from the way he talked and the strange things he said.  This did not trouble Amos. What worried him was the fact that the people would not listen to his addresses.  So, in the year 745, he journeyed again to Bethel, where a great festival was to be celebrated. He was determined that the people should hear. He was well prepared, too. Instead of beginning with a condemnation of Israel, he used new tactics:  \"Thus saith God,\" he began. \"For three transgressions of Damascus, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof.\"  That was interesting. We always like to hear about the punishments that others will receive for their misdeeds, even if we close our ears to those that threaten us.  And, as for Damascus, she was Israel's ancient foe, and the listeners rather liked the idea that God was to visit her with destruction.  When Amos had recounted the sins of Damascus and announced that \"the people of Syria shall go into captivity into Kir,\" there was loud applause.  Some cried, \"Let the Prophet speak!\"  Amos continued. He mentioned the sins for which God would punish Gaza, Tyre, Idumia, Ammon, Moab, and each period was greeted with volleys of applause.  Amos paused for a moment. He swallowed a lump that had risen in his throat and lowered his voice. He spoke, sadly and regretfully:     \"Thus saith God,     For three transgressions of Judah,     Yea, for four, I will not revoke its punishment.     Because they reject God's law,     And do not keep His statutes;     Because their lies have caused them to err,     (The lies) After which their fathers did walk.     Therefore, I will send a fire upon Judah     And it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.\"  Poor, weak little Judah! The Prophet was declaring the doom of his own country! It was a thing to laugh at! And how they did laugh!  But it was no laughing matter for Amos. His heart was wrung with woe from his own people. He waited for the uproar to subside, and then went on to the very point which he had come to make:     \"Thus saith God,     For three transgressions of Israel,     Yea, for four, I will not revoke its punishment.     Because they sell the righteous for money,     And the needy for a pair of shoes;     Who trample on the head of the poor,     And turn aside the way of the humble.     Upon garments taken in pledge they stretch themselves beside         every altar,     And the wine of those who have been fined they drink in the house         of their God.\"  Jeers and threatening cries were hurled at Amos from all directions, but he stood his ground.  With the art of a master orator he won back his displeased audience. Passionately he poured forth the story of Israel and its relationship to God--a story he knew so well--and brought the people back to breathless attention. He recounted the wonders God had done with and for Israel from the days when He brought them out of Egypt, poor, miserable slaves, until this day of their wealth and glory.  Here someone stepped out from the crowd and took up the argument for the people. If all this beautiful story is true, he claimed, then God may punish and destroy all the nations that Amos had mentioned; but Israel, to whom God had shown special favors, even up to this day, God will not destroy.  Quick as a flash the Prophet answered:     \"Are ye not as the Cushites to me,     O children of Israel? saith God.     Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt     And the Philistines from Caphtor     And the Syrians from Kir?     (But) you, especially, have I known of all the races of the earth,     Therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities.     Behold, the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom,     And I will destroy it from the face of the earth.     An adversary shall surround the land,     And shall strip from thee thy strength;     And thy palaces shall be plundered.     Verily, I am now raising up against you     O house of Israel, a nation,     And they shall oppress you     From the entrance of Hamath     Even to the brook of the Arabah,     Saith the Lord, God of hosts.\"  \"Treason! Treason!\" rose up the cry from the several army men who had been listening.  \"Treason! Treason!\" was shouted immediately from many directions.  The army officers who had raised the cry now rushed toward Amos, threatening him with bodily harm.  \"Treason! Treason!\" was echoed by most of the crowd. Hundreds now surged forward and things looked bad for the Prophet.  To meet this danger, Amos brought into play all the strength and power that he had stored up during his shepherding days. Out in the wilderness near Tekoah he had often fought with robbers who had stolen his sheep, and, like David, even with wild beasts that had stolen his lambs.  Prepared just for this kind of an emergency, keen of eye and alert of mind, he met the leaders as they came on.  Unfortunately for Amos, there was nothing that could afford him protection from the rear. He could meet any number that might attack him face to face; but while he was guarding in front someone might strike him in the back--and he was surrounded by the mob.  \"Traitor! Traitor!\" they shouted.  His blood boiled with anger. He, a traitor! He, guilty of treason! Why, he was the only man who saw the danger of his people and had ventured to warn them!  \"Seek God and ye shall live!\" kept flashing through his mind. But this was no time for preaching, not even for thinking. It was time for action.  And act he did!  The weak, undergrown army officers were like men of straw before Amos and he disposed of them as easily. With the speed of lightning he turned face, fearing an attack from the rear. There, however, the people had not awakened to what was going on.  Facing front again, he saw that the army officers had not yet recovered from his blows. They were sprawled on the ground before him and a few of the people were laughing at their discomfiture.  Amos had no desire to continue the fight and started to help the officers up; but, at that moment, he felt two pairs of hands lay hold of his mantle at the neck.  A sudden turn, a quick stretching of his brawny arms, like a swimmer making for speed, and the two men, merchants, clad in their holiday finery, were pushed to either side into the crowd.  Now, as soon as the bystanders saw with what ease Amos was handling his opponents, they began to laugh and take sides. A crowd always does that. Some urged Amos to go on fighting; others urged the sprawling victims to attack.  Amos, however, was not there to fight, nor did his opponents fancy a good beating at his hands. In the meantime a small group of the king's guard came up, post haste, and began to disperse the crowd.  The crowd scattered, but gathered again in various streets, in small groups, discussing the unusual occurrences of the day.  They spoke, in whispers, overawed by the fearlessness of the Prophet--some by his ability in self-defense; some by the force of his speeches.  In the palaces of the rich and mighty, gathered in Bethel at that time, Amos--what he said and what he did--was the topic of conversation no less than he was in the streets, only in one of these palaces was hatched a clever scheme for the Prophet's undoing.                                   CHAPTER V.                     _Priest Against Prophet._   That very night the most prominent people in Israel--military and civilian--assembled at Bethel, and decided that something must be done to get rid of the Prophet. They considered Amos crazy, and, therefore, dangerous. A little group of leaders gathered in the house of one of the merchant princes of Samaria to adopt a definite plan of action.  The High Priest, Amaziah, was called into consultation. He saw the seriousness of the matter, as they all did. Such preaching must be stopped!  \"This man,\" spoke one of the priests, \"is destroying the worship of God in Israel. If we are no longer to bring sacrifices on God's chosen altars, wherewith shall we worship him? Besides,\" he added very pointedly, \"without sacrifices the income of the priesthood will be ruined, and the sons of Aaron will be reduced from their high and holy office to beggary.\"  \"Nay, this is not the worst,\" began another priest, who did not think so much of his income from the sacrifices as the former speaker. \"The sons of Aaron can work, as do other men.\"  \"What is more serious,\" he continued, \"is, that this Prophet proclaims all other people as equal in the sight of God with Israel; that God has performed wonders for them, as for us. I fear,\" he concluded solemnly and with bowed head, \"that if such teaching will continue, Israel will lose faith in its God.\"  A captain of the host sprang to his feet. \"You priests,\" he said, savagely, \"worry about many minor things. This man is telling the people that God, Himself, is raising up a powerful nation to destroy our great empire. He is filling our peaceful people with dread and fear of the imagined enemy and will disturb the peace of our country.\"  \"Yea,\" cried a wealthy merchant, \"and its business prosperity.\"  \"All of which,\" added another merchant and slave dealer, \"is, as our friend has said,\" looking at the captain, \"simply imagination. The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7482"],["title","Stories of the Prophets (Before the Exile) (#5)"],["body","danger lies in his arousing the common people. He tells the poor that they are not getting their rights; that they are not being judged honestly; that the weak and the needy ought to be protected and helped--by us, by us! As if we have anything to do with them! I tell you that it is here the danger lurks. If this crazy Prophet is not silenced immediately, the merchant and military classes will face open rebellion on the part of the common horde.\"  The last speaker seemed to have said the final word on the subject. All were silent, their eyes turned toward Amaziah. The aged priest had not yet ventured an opinion; but he had been thinking deeply on what was said by the others. He agreed, for the most part, with the speakers who had preceded him; but he counseled caution and delay. \"Perhaps, now that the Prophet has seen opposition,\" Amaziah concluded, \"he will quit and go home to Judah.\"  But Amos did not quit, nor did he go home. The fight, that morning, was a mere incident, to be forgotten; but his mission to his people burned deep in his soul, a flame that could not be quenched.  On the day of the conclusion of the great festival, Amos again appeared in the sanctuary. This time it did not take long for a crowd to gather. In fact, most of the people were looking for him to appear. Even the richest and most exclusive, who usually are not interested in such men, had heard about Amos and had come to see and hear him, expecting something unusual to occur.  Amos did not waste any time. Without preparatory remarks, he gave voice to his warning call:  \"Prepare to meet thy God, O Israel!\"  Hardly had the words left the Prophet's lips, when a man stepped forward from the crowd, and facing Amos with threatening fists, exclaimed:  \"Hold thy peace! Thou art a false Prophet. Who hath sent thee to prophesy?\"  Here was a challenge to Amos. Who, indeed, had appointed him a Prophet? Who had set him up to judge the people's wrongdoing? Who had commanded him to declare Israel's doom? What entitled him to speak in the name of God?  This challenge, however, was just what Amos was looking for. He had wanted a number of times to correct the mistaken idea the people had of him.  There were, in the land, the long-established Schools of Prophets. These schools were under the protection of the king. At the head of each was a leader, like Samuel, Elijah and Elisha of the olden days. The leader was called \"The Seer\" and his pupils \"Sons of the Prophets.\"  Now, the Seers and Sons of the Prophets, with the exception of such strong and powerful characters as the three great men mentioned, usually did the bidding of the king and his officers, and prophesied to please them.  Amos was not a member of any of these established schools. He was a free lance--in truth, the first of the independent Prophets, who cried out against the evils of their day and who, fearlessly and without favor, laid the blame where it belonged--on king, on priest, and on people.  Amos, therefore, grasped this opportunity to set himself aright. He answered his questioner with a series of beautiful similes:     \"Do two walk together unless they be agreed?     Does a lion roar in the forest when there is no prey for him?     Does a young lion cry out in his den unless he has taken something?     Can a trumpet be blown in a city and the people not tremble?     Can calamity befall a city and God hath not sent it?     Surely, the Lord doeth nothing,     Unless He revealeth His purpose to His servants, the Prophets.     The lion hath roared; who does not fear?     The Lord God hath spoken; who can but prophesy?\"  God, then, it was, not the head of a School of Prophets, or a king, or a priest, who had sent Amos to prophesy! He, himself, had no desire to speak these terrible things he was saying to his people. A force over which he had no control--God, had impelled him to his task. It was the still, small voice of which Elijah spoke. Though his heart bled, while delivering the message, Amos could not help himself. God had commanded him; he had but to obey!  Before the challenger could continue the argument, there was a disturbance on the outskirts of the crowd. A murmur arose and all craned their necks to see what was going on. The crowd opened, forming a wide aisle, through which there advanced a tall, majestic figure, with flowing robe and gray beard.  \"The High Priest!\"  \"Amaziah!\"  \"The High Priest!\"  The people whispered to each other and an expectant silence followed, as the venerable priest walked through the row of bowed heads, toward the sanctuary. He stopped in front of Amos and looked at him curiously.  Amaziah was an old man, but as erect as a cedar in Lebanon. He was dressed in an ephod, the holy garment of his office. The robe was of fine twined linen, with threads of blue, scarlet and purple, embroidered in gold. Two shoulder pieces, fastened to the shoulders of the ephod with cords of \"wreathed gold,\" came down the front of the garment to just above the girdle, where they were fastened with two golden rings. Held by these cords above, and by blue ribbons through the golden rings below, was the breastplate, the insignia of the High Priest. On the front of the breastplate, in gold settings, were twelve precious stones, four rows of three stones each, on each of which was engraved the name of one of the tribes of Israel. A mitre on his head completed the High Priest's holy vestments.  Thus brilliantly arrayed, \"for glory and for beauty,\" Amaziah made a great contrast to the simply clad shepherd, robed in his woolen mantle, as they faced each other.  The splendor of Amaziah, his age and his authority, the tension caused by the struggle that was imminent between the Priest and the Prophet, overawed the assembly. There was a deep silence, like the calm before a heavy downpour.  Amos, cool and collected, always prepared for an emergency, bowed low to Amaziah out of respect to his gray head. Amaziah, who was equally prepared for an emergency, smiled at Amos, kindly, in greeting.  Amos, of course, did not know that Amaziah was working out a plan that had been outlined previous to his starting for the sanctuary. Only those who were in the Priest's confidence knew that he had sent a message to King Jeroboam, when it was reported that a crowd had gathered about Amos and that the Prophet would, no doubt, deliver another address. The message to Jeroboam read:     \"Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house     of Israel; the land is not able to bear his words. For thus     hath Amos said, 'Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel     shall surely be led away captive out of his land.'\"  The messenger proceeded, post haste, to the palace of the king, and Amaziah, quietly and with dignity, went to the sanctuary.  Hardly had Amos lifted his head from his low salute, when Amaziah addressed him:     \"O seer! Go, flee away to the land of Judah, and there eat     bread, and prophesy there; but prophesy not again any more     in Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the     royal residence.\"  How the Priest misunderstood the Prophet! Just because Bethel was the king's sanctuary and the royal residence and the seat of all the mighty in the land of Israel, Amos had selected it, above all other places, to preach his message there.  But Amaziah's little speech contained something more important to Amos than this. Amaziah had addressed the Prophet as \"seer,\" he had taken him for the leader of a \"School of Prophets.\" Amos immediately disclaimed such a questionable distinction. He answered Amaziah:     \"I am no Prophet, nor am I the son of a Prophet; but I was a     herdsman and a dresser of sycamore trees, when God took me     from following the flock and God said to me, 'Go, prophesy     against My people Israel.'\"  Entirely unprepared for such an answer, and not quite certain whether he understood what Amos meant by his claim that he had taken his orders direct from God, Amaziah was disconcerted. Amos did not give the Priest a chance to recover from his surprise and continued:     \"Now, therefore, hear thou the word of God: 'Thou sayest,     \"Prophesy not against Israel, nor preach against the house     of Isaac.\"' Therefore, thus saith God, 'Thy sons and thy     daughters shall fall by the sword and thy land shall be     divided by line; and thou shall die upon an unclean soil,     and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of this land.'\"  The fearlessness of the Prophet in attacking the High Priest dismayed Amaziah and his followers greatly. The crowd, too, by its acclamations, was evidently siding with Amos. Amaziah was, therefore, placed on the defensive. In broken and halting sentences he defended himself and the people. The ancient laws of Israel, he pointed out, were being adhered to by all Israelites. He, for one, was not afraid, even if the Day of God, the judgment day, should come to-morrow.  Now, a man like Amaziah might not fear the strict judgment which, Amos said, God was to visit upon Israel; but, how about those who were guilty of the crimes of which God, through the Prophet, was accusing Israel? Amos understood this, though Amaziah did not. The Prophet was speaking to all the people and not to one man in particular. Therefore, he continued:     \"Woe unto those that desire the Day of God!     Wherefore would ye have the Day of God?     It is darkness and not light.     It is when one flees from a lion,     And a bear meets him;     Or goes into a house and leans his hand upon a wall,     And a serpent bites him.     Shall not the Day of God be darkness and not light,     Yea, murky darkness, without a ray of light?\"  That is why, retorted the High Priest, the people come to Bethel and Gilgal and the other sanctuaries. They bring their sacrifices to God, that He may forgive their sins, against the coming of the Day of God, when all the guilty shall be judged and punished.  Amos did not interrupt Amaziah because he was an old man, and"]]]
