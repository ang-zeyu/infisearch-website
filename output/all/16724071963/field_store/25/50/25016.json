The Conference ended without result.\"  In his communication to the Rebel Congress at Richmond, February 6. 1865, Jefferson Davis, after mentioning his appointment of Messrs. Stephens, Hunter and Campbell, for the purpose stated, proceeded to say:  \"I herewith transmit, for the information of Congress, the report of the eminent citizens above named, showing that the Enemy refused to enter into negotiations with the Confederate States, or any one of them separately, or to give to our people any other terms or guarantees than those which the conqueror may grant, or to permit us to have Peace on any other basis than our unconditional submission to their rule, coupled with the acceptance of their recent legislation on the subject of the relations between the White and Black population of each State.\"  On the 5th and 9th of February, public meetings were held at Richmond, in connection with these Peace negotiations.  At the first, Jefferson Davis made a speech in which the Richmond Dispatch reported him as emphatically asserting that no conditions of Peace \"save the Independence of the Confederacy could ever receive his sanction.  He doubted not that victory would yet crown our labors, * * * and sooner than we should ever be united again he would be willing to yield up everything he had on Earth, and if it were possible would sacrifice a thousand lives before he would succumb.\"  Thereupon the meeting of Rebels passed resolutions \"spurning\" Mr. Lincoln's terms \"with the indignation due to so gross an insult;\" declared that the circumstances connected with his offer could only \"add to the outrage and stamp it as a designed and premeditated indignity\" offered to them; and invoking \"the aid of Almighty God\" to carry out their \"resolve to maintain\" their \"Liberties and Independence\"--to which, said they, \"we mutually pledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.\"  So too, at the second of these meetings, presided over by R. M. T. Hunter, and addressed by the Rebel Secretary Judah P. Benjamin, resolutions were adopted amid \"wild and long continued cheering,\" one of which stated that they would \"never lay down\" their \"arms until\" their \"Independence\" had \"been won,\" while another declared a full confidence in the sufficiency of their resources to \"conduct the War successfully and to that issue,\" and invoked \"the People, in the name of the holiest of all causes, to spare neither their blood nor their treasure in its maintenance and support.\"  As during these Peace negotiations, General Grant, by express direction of President Lincoln, had not changed, hindered, nor delayed, any of his \"Military movements or plans,\" so, now that the negotiations had failed, those Military movements were pressed more strenuously than ever.       [The main object of this Conference on the part of the Rebels was      to secure an immediate truce, or breathing spell, during which they      could get themselves in better condition for continuing the War.      Indeed a portion of Mr. Seward's letter of Feb. 7, 1865, to Mr.      Adams, our Minister at the Court of St. James, giving him an      account of the Conference with the party of Insurgent      Commissioners, would not alone indicate this, but also that it was      proposed by that \"Insurgent party,\" that both sides, during the      time they would thus cease to fight one another, might profitably      combine their forces to drive the French invaders out of Mexico and      annex that valuable country.  At least, the following passage in      that letter will bear that construction:       \"What the Insurgent party seemed chiefly to favor was a      postponement of the question of separation, upon which the War is      waged, and a mutual direction of efforts of the Government, as well      as those of the Insurgents, to some extrinsic policy or scheme for      a season, during which passions might be expected to subside, and      the Armies be reduced, and trade and intercourse between the People      of both Sections resumed.  It was suggested by them that through      such postponements we might now have immediate Peace, with some not      very certain prospect of an ultimate satisfactory adjustment of      political relations between this Government, and the States,      Section, or People, now engaged in conflict with it.\"       For the whole of this letter see McPherson's History of the      Rebellion, p.  570.]  Fort Fisher, North Carolina, had already been captured by a combined Military and Naval attack of the Union forces under General Terry and Admiral Porter; and Sherman's Army was now victoriously advancing from Savannah, Georgia, Northwardly through South Carolina.  On the 17th of February, Columbia, the capital of the latter State, surrendered, and, the day following, Charleston was evacuated, and its defenses, including historic Fort Sumter, were once more under that glorious old flag of the Union which four years before had been driven away, by shot and shell and flame, amid the frantic exultations of the temporarily successful armed Conspirators of South Carolina.  On the 22nd of February, General Schofield, who had been sent by Grant with his 23rd Corps, by water, to form a junction with Terry's troops about Fort Fisher, and capture Wilmington, North Carolina, had also accomplished his purpose successfully.  The Rebel Cause now began to look pretty desperate, even to Rebel eyes.       [Hundreds of Rebels were now deserting from Lee's Armies about      Richmond, every night, owing partly to despondency.  \"These      desertions,\" wrote Lee, on the 24th February, \"have a very bad      effect upon the troops who remain, and give rise to painful      apprehensions.\"  Another cause was the lack of food and clothing.      Says Badeau (Military History of Ulysses S. Grant, vol.  iii., p.      399): \"On the 8th of January, Lee wrote to the Rebel Government      that the entire Right Wing of his Army had been in line for three      days and nights, in the most inclement weather of the season.      'Under these circumstances,' he said, 'heightened by assaults and      fire of the Enemy, some of the men had been without meat for three      days, and all were suffering from reduced rations and scant      clothing.  Colonel Cole, chief commissary, reports that he has not      a pound of meat at his disposal.  If some change is not made, and      the commissary department reorganized, I apprehend dire results.      The physical strength of the men, if their courage survives, must      fail under this treatment.  Our Cavalry has to be dispersed for      want of forage.  Fitz Lee's and Lomax's Divisions are scattered      because supplies cannot be transported where their services are      required.  I had to bring Fitz Lee's Division sixty miles Sunday      night, to get them in position.  Taking these facts in connection      with the paucity of our numbers, you must not be surprised if      calamity befalls us.'\" Badeau's (Grant, vol.  iii., p. 401,)]  Toward the end of February, the Rebel General Longstreet having requested an interview with General Ord \"to arrange for the exchange of citizen prisoners, and prisoners of war, improperly captured,\" General Grant authorized General Ord to hold such interview t and \"to arrange definitely for such as were confined in his department, arrangements for all others to be submitted for approval.\"  In the course of that interview \"a general conversation ensued on the subject of the War,\" when it would seem that Longstreet suggested the idea of a composition of the questions at issue, and Peace between the United States and the Rebels, by means of a Military Convention.  It is quite probable that this idea originated with Jefferson Davis, as a /dernier resort/; for Longstreet appears to have communicated directly with Davis concerning his interview or \"interviews\" with Ord.  On the 28th of February, 1865 the Rebel Chief wrote to Lee, as follows:                           \"RICHMOND, VA., February 28.  \"Gen. R. E. LEE, Commanding, etc.,  \"GENERAL: You will learn by the letter of General Longstreet the result of his second interview with General Ord.  The points as to whether yourself or General Grant should invite the other to a Conference is not worth discussing.  If you think the statements of General Ord render it probably useful that the Conference suggested should be had, you will proceed as you may prefer, and are clothed with all the supplemental authority you may need in the consideration of any proposition for a Military Convention, or the appointment of a Commissioner to enter into such an arrangement as will cause at least temporary suspension of hostilities.                          \"Very truly yours                                    \"JEFFERSON DAVIS.\"   Thereupon General Lee wrote, and sent to General Grant, the following communication:                 \"HEADQUARTERS C. S. ARMIES, March 2, 1865. \"Lieut. Gen. U. S. GRANT, \"Commanding United States Armies:  \"GENERAL: Lieut.-Gen. Longstreet has informed me that, in a recent conversation between himself and Maj.-Gen. Ord, as to the possibility of arriving at a satisfactory adjustment of the present unhappy difficulties by means of a Military Convention, General Ord stated that if I desired to have an interview with you on the subject, you would not decline, provided I had authority to act.  Sincerely desirous to leave nothing untried which may put an end to the calamities of War, I propose to meet you at such convenient time and place as you may designate, with the hope that, upon an interchange of views, it may be found practicable to submit the subjects of controversy between the belligerents to a Convention of the kind mentioned.  \"In such event, I am authorized to do whatever the result of the proposed interview may render necessary or advisable.  Should you accede to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7139"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 7 (#5)"],["body","proposition, I would suggest that, if agreeable to you, we meet at the place selected by Generals Ord and Longstreet, for the interview, at 11 A.M., on Monday next.                 \"Very respectfully your obedient servant,                               \"R. E. LEE, General.\"   Upon receipt of this letter, General Grant sent a telegraphic dispatch to Secretary Stanton, informing him of Lee's proposition.  It reached the Secretary of War just before midnight of March 3rd.  He, and the other members of the Cabinet were with the President, in the latter's room at the Capitol, whither they had gone on this, the last, night of the last Session of the Thirty-Eighth Congress, the Cabinet to advise, and the President to act, upon bills submitted to him for approval.  The Secretary, after reading the dispatch, handed it to Mr. Lincoln.  The latter read and thought over it briefly, and then himself  wrote the following reply:  \"WASHINGTON, March, 3, 1865, 12 P.M.  \"LIEUTENANT GENERAL GRANT: The President directs me to say to you that he wishes you to have no Conference with General Lee, unless it be for the capitulation of General Lee's Army, or on some other minor and purely Military matter.  He instructs me to say to you that you are not to decide, discuss, or confer upon any political question.  Such questions the President holds in his own hands, and will submit them to no Military Conferences or Conventions.  Meanwhile you are to press to the utmost your Military advantages.                               \"EDWIN M. STANTON,                               \"Secretary of War.\"   General Grant received this dispatch, on the day following, and at once wrote and sent to General Lee a communication in which, after referring to the subject of the exchange of prisoners, he said: \"In regard to meeting you on the 6th inst., I would state that--I have no authority to accede to your proposition for a Conference on the subject proposed. Such authority is vested in the President of the United States alone. General Ord could only have meant that I would not refuse an interview on any subject on which I have a right to act; which, of course, would be such as are purely of a Military character, and on the subject of exchange, which has been entrusted to me.\"  Thus perished the last reasonable hope entertained by the Rebel Chieftains to ward off the inevitable and mortal blow that was about to smite their Cause.  The 4th of March, 1865, had come.  The Thirty-Eighth Congress was no more.  Mr. Lincoln was about to be inaugurated, for a second term, as President of the United States.  The previous night had been vexed with a stormy snow-fall.  The morning had also been stormy and rainy.  By mid-day, however, as if to mark the event auspiciously, the skies cleared and the sun shone gloriously upon the thousands and tens of thousands who had come to Washington, to witness the second Inauguration of him whom the people had now, long since, learned to affectionately term \"Father Abraham\"--of him who had become the veritable Father of his People.  As the President left the White House, to join the grand procession to the Capitol, a brilliant meteor shot athwart the heavens, above his head.  At the time, the superstitious thought it an Omen of triumph--of coming Peace--but in the sad after-days when armed Rebellion had ceased and Peace had come, it was remembered, with a shudder, as a portent of ill.  When, at last, Mr. Lincoln stood, with bared head, upon the platform at the eastern portico of the Capitol, where four years before, he had made his vows before the People, under such very different circumstances and surroundings, the contrast between that time and this--and all the terrible and eventful history of the interim --could not fail to present itself to every mind of all those congregated, whether upon the platform among the gorgeously costumed foreign diplomats, the full-uniformed Military and Naval officers of the United States, and the more soberly-clad statesmen and Civic and Judicial functionaries of the Land, or in the vast and indiscriminate mass of the enthusiastic people in front and on both sides of it.  As Chief Justice Chase administered the oath, and Abraham Lincoln, in view of all the people, reverently bowed his head and kissed the open Bible, at a passage in Isaiah (27th and 28th verses of the 5th Chapter) which it was thought \"admonished him to be on his guard, and not to relax at all, in his efforts,\" the people, whose first cheers of welcome had been stayed by the President's uplifted hand, broke forth in a tumult of cheering, until again hushed by the clear, strong, even voice of the President, as he delivered that second Inaugural Address, whose touching tenderness, religious resignation, and Christian charity, were clad in these imperishable words:  \"FELLOW COUNTRYMEN: At this second appearing to take the Oath of the Presidential office, there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first.  Then, a statement, somewhat in detail, of a course to be pursued, seemed fitting and proper.  Now, at the expiration of four years, during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energy of the Nation, little that is new could be presented.  The progress of our Arms, upon which all else depends, is as well known to the public as to myself; and it is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all.  With high hope for the future, no prediction in regard to it is ventured.  \"On the occasion corresponding to this, four years ago, all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending Civil War.  All dreaded it--all sought to avert it.  While the Inaugural Address was being delivered from this place, devoted altogether to saving the Union without War, Insurgent agents were in the city, seeking to destroy it without War --seeking to dissolve the Union, and divide the effects, by negotiation. Both parties deprecated War; but one of them would make War rather than let the Nation survive; and the other would accept War rather than let it perish--and the War came.  \"One-eighth of the whole population were colored Slaves, not distributed generally over the Union, but localized in the Southern part of it. These Slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest.  All knew that this interest was, somehow, the cause of the War.  To strengthen, perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the Insurgents would rend the Union, even by War; while the Government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it.  Neither Party expected for the War the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained.  Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with, or even before, the conflict itself should cease.  Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding.  Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.  It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not, that we be not judged.  The prayers of both could not be answered--that of neither has been answered fully.  The Almighty has His own purposes.  'Woe unto the World because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh.'  If we shall suppose that American Slavery is one of those offences which, in the providence of God, must needs come, but which, having continued through His appointed time, He now wills to remove, and that He gives to both North and South this terrible War, as the woe due to those by Whom the offence came, shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to Him?  Fondly do we hope--fervently do we pray --that this mighty scourge of War may speedily pass away.  Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, 'The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'  \"With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan--to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting Peace among ourselves, and with all Nations.\"  With utterances so just and fair, so firm and hopeful, so penitent and humble, so benignant and charitable, so mournfully tender and sweetly solemn, so full of the fervor of true piety and the very pathos of patriotism, small wonder is it that among those numberless thousands who, on this memorable occasion, gazed upon the tall, gaunt form of Abraham Lincoln, and heard his clear, sad voice, were some who almost imagined they saw the form and heard the voice of one of the great prophets and leaders of Israel; while others were more reminded of one of the Holy Apostles of the later Dispensation who preached the glorious Gospel \"On Earth, Peace, good will toward Men,\" and received in the end the crown of Christian martyrdom.  But not one soul of those present --unless his own felt such presentiment--dreamed for a moment that, all too soon, the light of those brave and kindly eyes was fated to go out in darkness, that sad voice to be hushed forever, that form to lie bleeding and dead, a martyred sacrifice indeed, upon the altar of his Country!
