From that son came the punishment of all his offences,--the black drop at the bottom of a bowl seemingly so sparkling.  To him, as the father grew old and desirous of quiet, Vavasour had transferred all his selfishness, as if to a securer and more durable firm.  The child, when young, had been singularly handsome and intelligent; and Vavasour, as he toiled and toiled at his ingenious and graceful cheateries, pleased himself with anticipating the importance and advantages the heir to his labours would enjoy.  For that son he certainly had persevered more arduously than otherwise he might have done in the lawsuit, of the justice of which he better satisfied the world than his own breast; for that son he rejoiced as he looked around the stately halls and noble domain from which the rightful possessor had been driven; for that son he extended economy into penuriousness, and hope into anxiety; and, too old to expect much more from the world himself, for that son he anticipated, with a wearing and feverish fancy, whatever wealth could purchase, beauty win, or intellect command.  But as if, like the Castle of Otranto, there was something in Mordaunt Court which contained a penalty and a doom for the usurper, no sooner had Vavasour possessed himself of his kinsman's estate, than the prosperity of his life dried and withered away, like Jonah's gourd, in a single night.  His son, at the age of thirteen, fell from a scaffold, on which the workmen were making some extensive alterations in the old house, and became a cripple and a valetudinarian for life. But still Vavasour, always of a sanguine temperament, cherished a hope that surgical assistance might restore him: from place to place, from professor to professor, from quack to quack, he carried the unhappy boy, and as each remedy failed he was only the more impatient to devise a new one.  But as it was the mind as well as person of his son in which the father had stored up his ambition; so, in despite of this fearful accident and the wretched health by which it was followed, Vavasour never suffered his son to rest from the tasks and tuitions and lectures of the various masters by whom he was surrounded.  The poor boy, it is true, deprived of physical exertion and naturally of a serious disposition, required very little urging to second his father's wishes for his mental improvement; and as the tutors were all of the orthodox university calibre, who imagine that there is no knowledge (but vanity) in any other works than those in which their own education has consisted, so Henry Vavasour became at once the victor and victim of Bentleys and Scaligers, word-weighers and metre- scanners, till, utterly ignorant of everything which could have softened his temper, dignified his misfortunes, and reconciled him to his lot, he was sinking fast into the grave, soured by incessant pain into moroseness, envy, and bitterness; exhausted by an unwholesome and useless application to unprofitable studies; an excellent scholar (as it is termed), with the worst regulated and worst informed mind of almost any of his contemporaries equal to himself in the advantages of ability, original goodness of disposition, and the costly and profuse expenditure of education.  But the vain father, as he heard, on all sides, of his son's talents, saw nothing sinister in their direction; and though the poor boy grew daily more contracted in mind and broken in frame, Vavasour yet hugged more and more closely to his breast the hope of ultimate cure for the latter and future glory for the former.  So he went on heaping money and extending acres, and planting and improving and building and hoping and anticipating, for one at whose very feet the grave was already dug!  But we left Mr. Brown in the study, making his bow and professions of service to Mr. Vavasour Mordaunt and his son.  \"Good day, honest Brown,\" said the former, a middle-sized and rather stout man, with a well-powdered head, and a sharp, shrewd, and very sallow countenance; \"good day; have you brought any of the foreign liqueurs you spoke of, for Mr. Henry?\"  \"Yes, sir, I have some curiously fine eau d'or and liqueur des files, besides the marasquino and curacoa.  The late Lady Waddilove honoured my taste in these matters with her especial approbation.\"  \"My dear boy,\" said Vavasour, turning to his son, who lay extended on the couch, reading not the \"Prometheus\" (that most noble drama ever created), but the notes upon it, \"my dear boy, as you are fond of liqueurs, I desired Brown to get some peculiarly fine; perhaps--\"  \"Pish!\" said the son, fretfully interrupting him, \"do, I beseech you, take your hand off my shoulder.  See now, you have made me lose my place.  I really do wish you would leave me alone for one moment in the day.\"  \"I beg your pardon, Henry,\" said the father, looking reverently on the Greek characters which his son preferred to the newspaper.  \"It is very vexatious, I own; but do taste these liqueurs.  Dr. Lukewarm said you might have everything you liked--\"  \"But quiet!\" muttered the cripple.  \"I assure you, sir,\" said the wandering merchant, \"that they are excellent; allow me, Mr. Vavasour Mordaunt, to ring for a corkscrew. I really do think, sir, that Mr. Henry looks much better.  I declare he has quite a colour.\"  \"No, indeed!\" said Vavasour, eagerly.  \"Well, it seems to me, too, that he is getting better.  I intend him to try Mr. E----'s patent collar in a day or two; but that will in some measure prevent his reading.  A great pity; for I am very anxious that he should lose no time in his studies just at present.  He goes to Cambridge in October.\"  \"Indeed, sir!  Well, he will set the town in a blaze, I guess, sir! Everybody says what a fine scholar Mr. Henry is,--even in the servants' hall!\"  \"Ay, ay,\" said Vavasour, gratified even by this praise, \"he is clever enough, Brown; and, what is more\" (and here Vavasour's look grew sanctified), \"he is good enough.  His principles do equal honour to his head and heart.  He would be no son of mine if he were not as much the gentleman as the scholar.\"  The youth lifted his heavy and distorted face from his book, and a sneer raised his lip for a moment; but a sudden spasm of pain seizing him, the expression changed, and Vavasour, whose eyes were fixed upon him, hastened to his assistance.  \"Throw open the window, Brown, ring the bell, call--\"  \"Pooh, Father,\" cried the boy, with a sharp, angry voice, \"I am not going to die yet, nor faint either; but it is all your fault.  If you will have those odious, vulgar people here for your own pleasure, at least suffer me, another day, to retire.\"  \"My son, my son!\" said the grieved father, in reproachful anger, \"it was my anxiety to give you some trifling enjoyment that brought Brown here: you must be sensible of that!\"  \"You tease me to death,\" grumbled the peevish unfortunate.  \"Well, sir,\" said Mr. Brown, \"shall I leave the bottles here? or do you please that I shall give them to the butler?  I see that I am displeasing and troublesome to Mr. Henry; but as my worthy friend and patroness, the late Lady--\"  \"Go, go, honest Brown!\" said Vavasour (who desired every man's good word), \"go, and give the liqueurs to Preston.  Mr. Henry is extremely sorry that he is too unwell to see you now; and I--I have the heart of a father for his sufferings.\"  Mr. Brown withdrew.  \"'Odious and vulgar,'\" said he to himself, in a little fury,--for Mr. Brown peculiarly valued himself on his gentility,--\"'odious and vulgar!'  To think of his little lordship uttering such shameful words!  However, I will go into the steward's room, and abuse him there.  But, I suppose, I shall get no dinner in this house,--no, not so much as a crust of bread; for while the old gentleman is launching out into such prodigious expenses on a great scale,--making heathenish temples, and spoiling the fine old house with his new picture gallery and nonsense,--he is so close in small matters, that I warrant not a candle-end escapes him; griping and pinching and squeezing with one hand, and scattering money, as if it were dirt, with the other,--and all for that cross, ugly, deformed, little whippersnapper of a son.  'Odious and vulgar,' indeed!  What shocking language!  Mr. Algernon Mordaunt would never have made use of such words, I know.  And, bless me, now I think of it, I wonder where that poor gentleman is.  The young heir here is not long for this world, I can see; and who knows but what Mr. Algernon may be in great distress; and I am sure, as far as four hundred pounds, or even a thousand, go, I would not mind lending it him, only upon the post- obits of Squire Vavasour and his hopeful.  I like doing a kind thing; and Mr. Algernon was always very good to me; and I am sure I don't care about the security, though I think it will be as sure as sixpence; for the old gentleman must be past sixty, and the young one is the worse life of the two.  And when he's gone, what relation so near as Mr. Algernon?  We should help one another; it is but one's duty: and if he is in great distress he would not mind a handsome premium.  Well, nobody can say Morris Brown is not as charitable as the best Christian breathing; and, as the late Lady Waddilove very justly observed, 'Brown, believe me, a prudent risk is the surest gain!'  I will lose no time in finding the late squire out.\"  Muttering over these reflections, Mr. Brown took his way to the steward's room.     CHAPTER LV.  Clar.--How, two letters?--The Lover's Progress.  LETTER FROM CLARENCE LINDEN, ESQ., TO THE DUKE OF HAVERFIELD.  HOTEL ----, CALAIS.  My Dear Duke,--After your kind letter, you will forgive me for not having called upon you before I left England, for you have led me to hope that I may dispense with ceremony towards you; and, in sad and sober earnest, I was in no mood to visit even you during the few days I was in London, previous to my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7635"],["title","The Disowned — Volume 05 (#7)"],["body",".  Some French philosopher has said that, 'the best compliment we can pay our friends, when in sickness or misfortune, is to avoid them.'  I will not say how far I disagree with this sentiment, but I know that a French philosopher will be an unanswerable authority with you; and so I will take shelter even under the battery of an enemy.  I am waiting here for some days in expectation of Lord Aspeden's arrival.  Sick as I was of England and all that has lately occurred to me there, I was glad to have an opportunity of leaving it sooner than my chief could do; and I amuse myself very indifferently in this dull town, with reading all the morning, plays all the evening, and dreams of my happier friends all the night.  And so you are sorry that I did not destroy Lord Borodaile.  My dear duke, you would have been much more sorry if I had!  What could you then have done for a living Pasquin for your stray lampoons and vagrant sarcasms?  Had an unfortunate bullet carried away--      \"That peer of England, pillar of the state,\"  as you term him, pray on whom could 'Duke Humphrey unfold his griefs'?--Ah, Duke, better as it is, believe me; and, whenever you are at a loss for a subject for wit, you will find cause to bless my forbearance, and congratulate yourself upon the existence of its object.  Dare I hope that, amidst all the gayeties which court you, you will find time to write to me?  If so, you shall have in return the earliest intelligence of every new soprano, and the most elaborate criticisms on every budding figurante of our court.  Have you met Trollolop lately, and in what new pursuit are his intellectual energies engaged?  There, you see, I have fairly entrapped your Grace into a question which common courtesy will oblige you to answer.  Adieu, ever, my dear Duke.  Most truly yours, etc.  LETTER FROM THE DUKE OF HAVERFIELD TO CLARENCE LINDEN, ESQ.  A thousand thanks, mon cher, for your letter, though it was certainly less amusing and animated than I could have wished it for your sake, as well as my own; yet it could not have been more welcomely received, had it been as witty as your conversation itself.  I heard that you had accepted the place of secretary to Lord Aspeden, and that you had passed through London on your way to the Continent, looking (the amiable Callythorpe, 'who never flatters,' is my authority) more like a ghost than yourself.  So you may be sure, my dear Linden, that I was very anxious to be convinced under your own hand of your carnal existence.  Take care of yourself, my good fellow, and don't imagine, as I am apt to do, that youth is like my hunter, Fearnought, and will carry you over everything.  In return for your philosophical maxim, I will give you another.  \"In age we should remember that we have been young, and in youth that we are to be old.\"  Ehem!--am I not profound as a moralist?  I think a few such sentences would become my long face well; and, to say truth, I am tired of being witty; every one thinks he can be that: so I will borrow Trollolop's philosophy,--take snuff, wear a wig out of curl, and grow wise instead of merry.  A propos of Trollolop; let me not forget that you honour him with your inquiries.  I saw him three days since, and he asked me if I had been impressed lately with the idea vulgarly called Clarence Linden; and he then proceeded to inform me that he had heard the atoms which composed your frame were about to be resolved into a new form.  While I was knitting my brows very wisely at this intelligence, he passed on to apprise me that I had neither length, breadth, nor extension, nor anything but mind.  Flattered by so delicate a compliment to my understanding, I yielded my assent: and he then shifted his ground, and told me that there was no such thing as mind; that we were but modifications of matter; and that, in a word, I was all body.  I took advantage of this doctrine, and forthwith removed my modification of matter from his.  Findlater has just lost his younger brother in a duel.  You have no idea how shocking it was.  Sir Christopher one day heard his brother, who had just entered the ---- Dragoons, ridiculed for his want of spirit, by Major Elton, who professed to be the youth's best friend. The honest heart of our worthy baronet was shocked beyond measure at this perfidy, and the next time his brother mentioned Elton's name with praise, out came the story.  You may guess the rest: young Findlater called out Elton, who shot him through the lungs!  \"I did it for the best,\" cried Sir Christopher.  La pauvre petite Meronville!  What an Ariadne!  Just as I was thinking to play the Bacchus to your Theseus, up steps an old gentleman from Yorkshire, who hears it is fashionable to marry bonas robas, proposes honourable matrimony, and deprives me and the world of La Meronville! The wedding took place on Monday last, and the happy pair set out to their seat in the North.  Verily, we shall have quite a new race in the next generation; I expect all the babes will skip into the world with a pas de zephyr, singing in sweet trebles,--      \"Little dancing loves we are!      Who the deuce is our papa?\"  I think you will be surprised to hear that Lord Borodaile is beginning to thaw; I saw him smile the other day!  Certainly, we are not so near the North Pole as we were!  He is going, and so am I, in the course of the autumn, to your old friends the Westboroughs.  Report says that he is un peu epris de la belle Flore; but, then, Report is such a liar! For my own part I always contradict her.  I eagerly embrace your offer of correspondence, and assure you that there are few people by whose friendship I conceive myself so much honoured as by yours.  You will believe this; for you know that, like Callythorpe, I never flatter.  Farewell for the present.  Sincerely yours,                                   HAVERFIELD.     CHAPTER LVI.      Q. Eliz.--Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?     K. Rich.--Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.     Q. Eliz.--Shall I forget myself to be myself?--SHAKSPEARE.  It wanted one hour to midnight, as Crauford walked slowly to the lonely and humble street where he had appointed his meeting with Glendower.  It was a stormy and fearful night.  The day had been uncommonly sultry, and, as it died away, thick masses of cloud came labouring along the air, which lay heavy and breathless, as if under a spell,--as if in those dense and haggard vapours the rider of the storm sat, like an incubus, upon the atmosphere beneath, and paralyzed the motion and wholesomeness of the sleeping winds.  And about the hour of twilight, or rather when twilight should have been, instead of its quiet star, from one obscure corner of the heavens flashed a solitary gleam of lightning, lingered a moment,--      \"And ere a man had power to say, Behold!      The jaws of darkness did devour it up.\"  But then, as if awakened from a torpor by a signal universally acknowledged, from the courts and quarters of heaven, came, blaze after blaze, and peal upon peal, the light and voices of the Elements when they walk abroad.  The rain fell not: all was dry and arid; the mood of Nature seemed not gentle enough for tears; and the lightning, livid and forked, flashed from the sullen clouds with a deadly fierceness, made trebly perilous by the panting drought and stagnation of the air.  The streets were empty and silent, as if the huge city had been doomed and delivered to the wrath of the tempest; and ever and anon the lightnings paused upon the housetops, shook and quivered as if meditating their stroke, and then, baffled as it were, by some superior and guardian agency, vanished into their gloomy tents, and made their next descent from some opposite corner of the skies.  It was a remarkable instance of the force with which a cherished object occupies the thoughts, and of the all-sufficiency of the human mind to itself, the slowness and unconsciousness of danger with which Crauford, a man luxurious as well as naturally timid, moved amidst the angry fires of heaven and brooded, undisturbed and sullenly serene, over the project at his heart.  \"A rare night for our meeting,\" thought he; \"I suppose he will not fail me.  Now let me con over my task.  I must not tell him all yet. Such babes must be led into error before they can walk: just a little inkling will suffice, a glimpse into the arcana of my scheme.  Well, it is indeed fortunate that I met him, for verily I am surrounded with danger, and a very little delay in the assistance I am forced to seek might exalt me to a higher elevation than the peerage.\"  Such was the meditation of this man, as with a slow, shufling walk, characteristic of his mind, he proceeded to the appointed spot.  A cessation of unusual length in the series of the lightnings, and the consequent darkness, against which the dull and scanty lamps vainly struggled, prevented Crauford and another figure approaching from the opposite quarter seeing each other till they almost touched.  Crauford stopped abruptly.  \"Is it you?\" said he.  \"It is a man who has outlived fortune!\" answered Glendower, in the exaggerated and metaphorical language which the thoughts of men who imagine warmly, and are excited powerfully, so often assume.  \"Then,\" rejoined Crauford, \"you are the more suited for my purpose.  A little urging of necessity behind is a marvellous whetter of the appetite to danger before, he! he!\"  And as he said this, his low chuckling laugh jarringly enough contrasted with the character of the night and his companion.  Glendower replied not: a pause ensued; and the lightning which, spreading on a sudden from east to west, hung over the city a burning and ghastly canopy, showed the face of each to the other, working and almost haggard as it was with the conception of dark thoughts, and rendered wan and unearthly by the spectral light in which it was beheld.  \"It is an awful night,\" said Glendower.  \"True,\" answered Crauford, \"a very awful night; but we are all"]]]
