But how to provide for thee till my return I know not.\"  \"Dare I not hope, then, to make one of your embassage, noble earl?\"  Warwick bent his brows, and looked at him in surprise.  \"Of our embassage!  Why, thou art haughty, indeed!  Nay, and so a soldier's son and a Nevile should be!  I blame thee not; but I could not make thee one of my train, without creating a hundred enemies--to me (but that's nothing) and to thee, which were much.  Knowest thou not that there is scarce a gentleman of my train below the state of a peer's son, and that I have made, by refusals, malcontents eno', as it is?-- Yet, bold! there is my learned brother, the Archbishop of York. Knowest thou Latin and the schools?\"  \"'Fore Heaven, my lord,\" said the Nevile, bluntly, \"I see already I had best go back to green Westmoreland, for I am as unfit for his grace the archbishop as I am for my Lord Montagu.\"  \"Well, then,\" said the earl, dryly, \"since thou hast not yet station enough for my train, nor glosing for Northumberland, nor wit and lere for the archbishop, I suppose, my poor youth, I must e'en make you only a gentleman about the king!  It is not a post so sure of quick rising and full gipsires as one about myself or my brethren, but it will be less envied, and is good for thy first essay.  How goes the clock?  Oh, here is Nick Alwyn's new horologe.  He tells me that the English will soon rival the Dutch in these baubles.  [Clockwork appears to have been introduced into England in the reign of Edward III., when three Dutch horologers were invited over from Delft.  They must soon have passed into common use, for Chaucer thus familiarly speaks of them:--\"Full sickerer was his crowing in his loge                   Than is a clock or any abbey orloge.\"] The more the pity!--our red-faced yeomen, alas, are fast sinking into lank-jawed mechanics!  We shall find the king in his garden within the next half-hour.  Thou shalt attend me.\"  Marmaduke expressed, with more feeling than eloquence, the thanks he owed for an offer that, he was about to say, exceeded his hopes; but he had already, since his departure from Westmoreland, acquired sufficient wit to think twice of his words.  And so eagerly, at that time, did the youth of the nobility contend for the honour of posts about the person of Warwick, and even of his brothers, and so strong was the belief that the earl's power to make or to mar fortune was all-paramount in England, that even a place in the king's household was considered an inferior appointment to that which made Warwick the immediate patron and protector.  This was more especially the case amongst the more haughty and ancient gentry since the favour shown by Edward to the relations of his wife, and his own indifference to the rank and birth of his associates.  Warwick had therefore spoken with truth when he expressed a comparative pity for the youth, whom he could not better provide for than by a place about the court of his sovereign!  The earl then drew from Marmaduke some account of his early training, his dependence on his brother, his adventures at the archery-ground, his misadventure with the robbers, and even his sojourn with Warner,-- though Marmaduke was discreetly silent as to the very existence of Sibyll.  The earl, in the mean while, walked to and fro the chamber with a light, careless stride, every moment pausing to laugh at the frank simplicity of his kinsman, or to throw in some shrewd remark, which he cast purposely in the rough Westmoreland dialect; for no man ever attains to the popularity that rejoiced or accursed the Earl of Warwick, without a tendency to broad and familiar humour, without a certain commonplace of character in its shallower and more every-day properties.  This charm--always great in the great--Warwick possessed to perfection; and in him--such was his native and unaffected majesty of bearing, and such the splendour that surrounded his name--it never seemed coarse or unfamiliar, but \"everything he did became him best.\" Marmaduke had just brought his narrative to a conclusion, when, after a slight tap at the door, which Warwick did not hear, two fair young forms bounded joyously in, and not seeing the stranger, threw themselves upon Warwick's breast with the caressing familiarity of infancy.  \"Ah, Father,\" said the elder of these two girls, as Warwick's hand smoothed her hair fondly, \"you promised you would take us in your barge to see the sports on the river, and now it will be too late.\"  \"Make your peace with your young cousins here,\" said the earl, turning to Marmaduke; \"you will cost them an hour's joyaunce.  This is my eldest daughter, Isabel; and this soft-eyed, pale-cheeked damozel--too loyal for a leaf of the red rose--is the Lady Anne.\"  The two girls had started from their father's arms at the first address to Marmaduke, and their countenances had relapsed from their caressing and childlike expression into all the stately demureness with which they had been brought up to regard a stranger.  Howbeit, this reserve, to which he was accustomed, awed Marmaduke less than the alternate gayety and sadness of the wilder Sibyll, and he addressed them with all the gallantry to the exercise of which he had been reared, concluding his compliments with a declaration that he would rather forego the advantage proffered him by the earl's favour with the king, than foster one obnoxious and ungracious memory in damozels so fair and honoured.  A haughty smile flitted for a moment over the proud young face of Isabel Nevile; but the softer Anne blushed, and drew bashfully behind her sister.  As yet these girls, born for the highest and fated to the most wretched fortunes, were in all the bloom of earliest youth; but the difference between their characters might be already observable in their mien and countenance.  Isabel; of tall and commanding stature, had some resemblance to her father, in her aquiline features, rich, dark hair, and the lustrous brilliancy of her eyes; while Anne, less striking, yet not less lovely, of smaller size and slighter proportions, bore in her pale, clear face, her dove-like eyes, and her gentle brow an expression of yielding meekness not unmixed with melancholy, which, conjoined with an exquisite symmetry of features, could not fail of exciting interest where her sister commanded admiration.  Not a word, however, from either did Marmaduke abstract in return for his courtesies, nor did either he or the earl seem to expect it; for the latter, seating himself and drawing Anne on his knee, while Isabella walked with stately grace towards the table that bore her father's warlike accoutrements, and played, as it were, unconsciously with the black plume on his black burgonet, said to Nevile,  \"Well, thou hast seen enough of the Lancastrian raptrils to make thee true to the Yorkists.  I would I could say as much for the king himself, who is already crowding the court with that venomous faction, in honour of Dame Elizabeth Gray, born Mistress Woodville, and now Queen of England.  Ha, my proud Isabel, thou wouldst have better filled the throne that thy father built!\"  And at these words a proud flash broke from the earl's dark eyes, betraying even to Marmaduke the secret of perhaps his earliest alienation from Edward IV.  Isabella pouted her rich lip, but said nothing.  \"As for thee, Anne,\" continued the earl, \"it is a pity that monks cannot marry,--thou wouldst have suited some sober priest better than a mailed knight. 'Fore George, I would not ask thee to buckle my baldrick when the war- steeds were snorting, but I would trust Isabel with the links of my hauberk.\"  \"Nay, Father,\" said the low, timid voice of Anne, \"if thou wert going to danger, I could be brave in all that could guard thee!\"  \"Why, that's my girl! kiss me!  Thou hast a look of thy mother now,-- so thou hast! and I will not chide thee the next time I hear thee muttering soft treason in pity of Henry of Windsor.\"  \"Is he not to be pitied?--Crown, wife, son, and Earl Warwick's stout arm lost--lost!\"  \"No!\" said Isabel, suddenly; no, sweet sister Anne, and fie on thee for the words!  He lost all, because he had neither the hand of a knight nor the heart of a man!  For the rest--Margaret of Anjou, or her butchers, beheaded our father's father.\"  \"And may God and Saint George forget me, when I forget those gray and gory hairs!\" exclaimed the earl; and putting away the Lady Anne somewhat roughly, he made a stride across the room, and stood by his hearth.  \"And yet Edward, the son of Richard of York, who fell by my father's side--he forgets, he forgives!  And the minions of Rivers the Lancastrian tread the heels of Richard of Warwick.\"  At this unexpected turn in the conversation, peculiarly unwelcome, as it may be supposed, to the son of one who had fought on the Lancastrian side in the very battle referred to, Marmaduke felt somewhat uneasy; and turning to the Lady Anne, he said, with the gravity of wounded pride, \"I owe more to my lord, your father, than I even wist of,--how much he must have overlooked to--\"  \"Not so!\" interrupted Warwick, who overheard him,--\"not so; thou wrongest me!  Thy father was shocked at those butcheries; thy father recoiled from that accursed standard; thy father was of a stock ancient and noble as my own!  But, these Woodvilles!--tush! my passion overmasters me.  We will go to the king,--it is time.\"  Warwick here rang the hand-bell on his table, and on the entrance of his attendant gentleman, bade him see that the barge was in readiness; then beckoning to his kinsman, and with a nod to his daughters, he caught up his plumed cap, and passed at once into the garden.  \"Anne,\" said Isabel, when the two girls were alone, \"thou hast vexed my father, and what marvel?  If the Lancastrians can be pitied, the Earl of Warwick must be condemned!\"  \"Unkind!\" said Anne, shedding tears; \"I can pity woe and mischance, without blaming those whose hard duty it might be to achieve them.\"  \"In good sooth"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7716"],["title","The Last of the Barons â€” Volume 02 (#3)"],["body","I!  Thou wouldst pity and pardon till thou leftst no distinction between foeman and friend, leife and loathing. Be it mine, like my great father, to love and to hate!\"  \"Yet why art thou so attached to the White Rose?\" said Anne, stung, if not to malice, at least to archness.  \"Thou knowest my father's nearest wish was that his eldest daughter might be betrothed to King Edward.  Dost thou not pay good for evil when thou seest no excellence out of the House of York?\"  \"Saucy Anne,\" answered Isabel, with a half smile, \"I am not raught by thy shafts, for I was a child for the nurses when King Edward sought a wife for his love.  But were I chafed--as I may be vain enough to know myself--whom should I blame?--Not the king, but the Lancastrian who witched him!\"  She paused a moment, and, looking away, added in a low tone, \"Didst thou hear, sister Anne, if the Duke of Clarence visited my father the forenoon?\"  \"Ah, Isabel, Isabel!\"  \"Ah, sister Anne, sister Anne!  Wilt thou know all my secrets ere I know them myself?\"--and Isabel, with something of her father's playfulness, put her hands to Anne's laughing lips.  Meanwhile Warwick, after walking musingly a few moments along the garden, which was formed by plots of sward, bordered with fruit-trees, and white rose-trees not yet in blossom, turned to his silent kinsman, and said, \"Forgive me, cousin mine, my mannerless burst against thy brave father's faction; but when thou hast been a short while at court, thou wilt see where the sore is.  Certes, I love this king!\" Here his dark face lighted up.  \"Love him as a king,--ay, and as a son!  And who would not love him; brave as his sword, gallant, and winning, and gracious as the noonday in summer?  Besides, I placed him on his throne; I honour myself in him!\"  The earl's stature dilated as he spoke the last sentence, and his hand rested on his dagger hilt.  He resumed, with the same daring and incautious candour that stamped his dauntless, soldier-like nature, \"God hath given me no son.  Isabel of Warwick had been a mate for William the Norman; and my grandson, if heir to his grandsire's soul, should have ruled from the throne of England over the realms of Charlemagne!  But it hath pleased Him whom the Christian knight alone bows to without shame, to order otherwise.  So be it.  I forgot my just pretensions,--forgot my blood, and counselled the king to strengthen his throne with the alliance of Louis XI.  He rejected the Princess Bona of Savoy, to marry widow Elizabeth Gray; I sorrowed for his sake, and forgave the slight to my counsels.  At his prayer I followed the train of his queen, and hushed the proud hearts of our barons to obeisance.  But since then, this Dame Woodville, whom I queened, if her husband mated, must dispute this roiaulme with mine and me,--a Nevile, nowadays, must vail his plume to a Woodville!  And not the great barons whom it will suit Edward's policy to win from the Lancastrians--not the Exeters and the Somersets--but the craven varlets and lackeys and dross of the camp--false alike to Henry and to Edward--are to be fondled into lordships and dandled into power. Young man, I am speaking hotly--Richard Nevile never lies nor conceals; but I am speaking to a kinsman, am I not?  Thou hearest,-- thou wilt not repeat?\"  \"Sooner would I pluck forth my tongue by the roots.\"  \"Enough!\" returned the earl, with a pleased smile.  \"When I come from France, I will speak more to thee.  Meanwhile be courteous to all men, servile to none.  Now to the king.\"  So speaking, he shook back his surcoat, drew his cap over his brow, and passed to the broad stairs, at the foot of which fifty rowers, with their badges on their shoulders, waited in the huge barge, gilt richly at prow and stern, and with an awning of silk, wrought with the earl's arms and cognizance.  As they pushed off, six musicians, placed towards the helm, began a slow and half Eastern march, which, doubtless, some crusader of the Temple had brought from the cymbals and trumps of Palestine.     CHAPTER II.  KING EDWARD THE FOURTH.  The Tower of London, more consecrated to associations of gloom and blood than those of gayety and splendour, was, nevertheless, during the reign of Edward IV., the seat of a gallant and gorgeous court. That king, from the first to the last so dear to the people of London, made it his principal residence when in his metropolis; and its ancient halls and towers were then the scene of many a brawl and galliard.  As Warwick's barge now approached its huge walls, rising from the river, there was much that might either animate or awe, according to the mood of the spectator.  The king's barge, with many lesser craft reserved for the use of the courtiers, gay with awnings and streamers and painting and gilding, lay below the wharfs, not far from the gate of St. Thomas, now called the Traitor's Gate.  On the walk raised above the battlemented wall of the inner ward, not only paced the sentries, but there dames and knights were inhaling the noonday breezes, and the gleam of their rich dresses of cloth-of-gold glanced upon the eye at frequent intervals from tower to tower.  Over the vast round turret, behind the Traitor's Gate, now called \"The Bloody Tower,\" floated cheerily in the light wind the royal banner. Near the Lion's Tower, two or three of the keepers of the menagerie, in the king's livery, were leading forth, by a strong chain, the huge white bear that made one of the boasts of the collection, and was an especial favourite with the king and his brother Richard.  The sheriffs of London were bound to find this grisly minion his chain and his cord, when he deigned to amuse himself with bathing or \"fishing\" in the river; and several boats, filled with gape-mouthed passengers, lay near the wharf, to witness the diversions of Bruin.  These folks set up a loud shout of--\"A Warwick! a Warwick!\"  \"The stout earl, and God bless him!\" as the gorgeous barge shot towards the fortress.  The earl acknowledged their greeting by vailing his plumed cap; and passing the keepers with a merry allusion to their care of his own badge, and a friendly compliment to the grunting bear, he stepped ashore, followed by his kinsman.  Now, however, he paused a moment; and a more thoughtful shade passed over his countenance, as, glancing his eye carelessly aloft towards the standard of King Edward, he caught sight of the casement in the neighbouring tower, of the very room in which the sovereign of his youth, Henry the Sixth, was a prisoner, almost within hearing of the revels of his successor; then, with a quick stride, he hurried on through the vast court, and, passing the White Tower, gained the royal lodge.  Here, in the great hall, he left his companion, amidst a group of squires and gentlemen, to whom he formally presented the Nevile as his friend and kinsman, and was ushered by the deputy-chamberlain (with an apology for the absence of his chief, the Lord Hastings, who had gone abroad to fly his falcon) into the small garden, where Edward was idling away the interval between the noon and evening meals,--repasts to which already the young king inclined with that intemperate zest and ardour which he carried into all his pleasures, and which finally destroyed the handsomest person and embruted one of the most vigorous intellects of the age.  The garden, if bare of flowers, supplied their place by the various and brilliant-coloured garbs of the living beauties assembled on its straight walks and smooth sward.  Under one of those graceful cloisters, which were the taste of the day, and had been recently built and gayly decorated, the earl was stopped in his path by a group of ladies playing at closheys (ninepins) of ivory; [Narrative of Louis of Bruges, Lord Grauthuse.  Edited by Sir F. Madden, \"Archaelogia,\" 1836.] and one of these fair dames, who excelled the rest in her skill, had just bowled down the central or crowned pin,--the king of the closheys.  This lady, no less a person than Elizabeth, the Queen of England, was then in her thirty-sixth year,--ten years older than her lord; but the peculiar fairness and delicacy of her complexion still preserved to her beauty the aspect and bloom of youth.  From a lofty headgear, embroidered with fleur-de-lis, round which wreathed a light diadem of pearls, her hair, of the pale yellow considered then the perfection of beauty, flowed so straight and so shining down her shoulders, almost to the knees, that it seemed like a mantle of gold. The baudekin stripes (blue and gold) of her tunic attested her royalty.  The blue courtpie of satin was bordered with ermine, and the sleeves, sitting close to an arm of exquisite contour, shone with seed pearls.  Her features were straight and regular, yet would have been insipid, but for an expression rather of cunning than intellect; and the high arch of her eyebrows, with a slight curve downward of a mouth otherwise beautiful, did not improve the expression, by an addition of something supercilious and contemptuous, rather than haughty or majestic.  \"My lord of Warwick,\" said Elizabeth, pointing to the fallen closhey, \"what would my enemies say if they heard I had toppled down the king?\"  \"They would content themselves with asking which of your Grace's brothers you would place in his stead,\" answered the hardy earl, unable to restrain the sarcasm.  The queen blushed, and glanced round her ladies with an eye which never looked direct or straight upon its object, but wandered sidelong with a furtive and stealthy expression, that did much to obtain for her the popular character of falseness and self-seeking.  Her displeasure was yet more increased by observing the ill-concealed smile which the taunt had called forth.  \"Nay, my lord,\" she said, after a short pause, \"we value the peace of our roiaulme too much for so high an ambition.  Were we to make a brother even the prince of the closheys, we should disappoint the hopes of a Nevile.\"  The earl disdained pursuing the war of"]]]
