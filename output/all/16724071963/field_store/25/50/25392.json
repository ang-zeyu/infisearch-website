And of all human beings, for that one to be singled out; that one in whom passion and sin were, if they existed, nipped in their earliest germ, and seemingly rendered barren of all fruit!  If too, almost against the evidence of sight and sense, an innate feeling has marked in that most altered form the traces of a dread recognition, would not his memory have been yet more vigilant than mine?  Am I so changed that he should have looked me in the face so wistfully, and found there naught save the lineaments of a stranger?\"  And, actuated by this thought, I placed the light by the small mirror which graced my chamber.  I recalled, as I gazed, my features as they had been in earliest youth.  \"No,\" I said, with a sigh, \"there is nothing here that he should recognize.\"  And I said aright: my features, originally small and delicate, had grown enlarged and prominent.  The long locks of my youth (for only upon state occasions did my early vanity consent to the fashion of the day) were succeeded by curls, short and crisped; the hues, alternately pale and hectic, that the dreams of romance had once spread over my cheek, had settled into the unchanging bronze of manhood; the smooth lip and unshaven chin were clothed with a thick hair; the once unfurrowed brow was habitually knit in thought; and the ardent, restless expression that boyhood wore had yielded to the quiet unmoved countenance of one in whom long custom has subdued all outward sign of emotion, and many and various events left no prevalent token of the mind save that of an habitual but latent resolution.  My frame, too, once scarcely less slight than a woman's, was become knit and muscular; and nothing was left by which, in the foreign air, the quiet brow, and the athletic form, my very mother could have recognized the slender figure and changeable face of the boy she had last beheld.  The very sarcasm of the eye was gone; and I had learned the world's easy lesson,--the dissimulation of composure.  I have noted one thing in others, and it was particularly noticeable in me; namely, that few who mix very largely with men, and with the courtier's or the citizen's design, ever retain the key and tone of their original voice.  The voice of a young man is as yet modulated by nature, and expresses the passion of the moment; that of the matured pupil of art expresses rather the customary occupation of his life. Whether he aims at persuading, convincing, or commanding others, his voice irrevocably settles into the key he ordinarily employs; and, as persuasion is the means men chiefly employ in their commerce with each other, especially in the regions of a court, so a tone of artificial blandness and subdued insinuation is chiefly that in which the accents of worldly men are clothed; the artificial intonation, long continued, grows into nature, and the very pith and basis of the original sound fritter themselves away.  The change was great in me, for at that time which I brought in comparison with the present my age was one in which the voice is yet confused and undecided, struggling between the accents of youth and boyhood; so that even this most powerful and unchanging of all claims upon the memory was in a great measure absent in me; and nothing but an occasional and rare tone could have produced even that faint and unconscious recognition which the Hermit had confessed.  I must be pardoned these egotisms, which the nature of my story renders necessary.  With what eager impatience did I watch the hours to the appointed interview with the Hermit languish themselves away!  However, before that time arrived and towards the evening of the next day, I was surprised by the rare honour of a visit from Anselmo himself.  He came attended by two of the mendicant friars of his order, and they carried between them a basket of tolerable size, which, as mine hostess afterwards informed me, with many a tear, went back somewhat heavier than it came, from the load of certain /receptacula/ of that rarer wine which she had had the evening before the indiscreet hospitality to produce.  The Abbot came to inform me that the Hermit had been with him that morning, making many inquiries respecting me.  \"I told him,\" said he, \"that I was acquainted with your name and birth, but that I was under a solemn promise not to reveal them, without your consent; and I am now here, my Son, to learn from you whether that consent may be obtained?\"  \"Assuredly not, holy Father!\" said I, hastily; nor was I contented until I had obtained a renewal of his promise to that effect.  This seemed to give the Abbot some little chagrin: perhaps the Hermit had offered a reward for my discovery.  However, I knew that Anselmo, though a griping was a trustworthy man, and I felt safe in his renewed promise.  I saw him depart with great satisfaction, and gave myself once more to conjectures respecting the strange recluse.  As the next evening I prepared to depart towards the hermitage, I took peculiar pains to give my person a foreign and disguised appearance.  A loose dress, of rude and simple material, and a high cap of fur, were pretty successful in accomplishing this purpose.  And, as I gave the last look at the glass before I left the house, I said inly, \"If there be any truth in my wild and improbable conjecture respecting the identity of the anchorite, I think time and this dress are sufficient wizards to secure me from a chance of discovery.  I will keep a guard upon my words and tones, until, if my thought be verified, a moment fit for unmasking myself arrives.  But would to God that the thought be groundless!  In such circumstances, and after such an absence, to meet /him/!  No; and yet--Well, this meeting will decide.\"    CHAPTER IV.  THE SOLUTION OF MANY MYSTERIES.--A DARK VIEW OF THE LIFE AND NATURE OF MAN.  POWERFUL, though not clearly developed in my own mind, was the motive which made me so strongly desire to preserve the /incognito/ during my interview with the Hermit.  I have before said that I could not resist a vague but intense belief that he was a person whom I had long believed in the grave; and I had more than once struggled against a dark but passing suspicion that that person was in some measure--mediately, though not directly--connected with the mysteries of my former life.  If both these conjectures were true, I thought it possible that the communication the Hermit wished to make might be made yet more willingly to me as a stranger than if he knew who was in reality his confidant. And, at all events, if I could curb the impetuous gushings of my own heart, which yearned for immediate disclosure, I might by hint and prelude ascertain the advantages and disadvantages of revealing myself.  I arrived at the well: the Hermit was already at the place of rendezvous, seated in the same posture in which I had before seen him. I made my reverence and accosted him.  \"I have not failed you, Father.\"  \"That is rarely a true boast with men,\" said the Hermit, smiling mournfully, but without sarcasm; \"and were the promise of greater avail, it might not have been so rigidly kept.\"  \"The promise, Father, seemed to me of greater weight than you would intimate,\" answered I.  \"How mean you?\" said the Hermit, hastily.  \"Why, that we may perhaps serve each other by our meeting: you, Father, may comfort me by your counsels; I you by my readiness to obey your request.\"  The Hermit looked at me for some moments, and, as well as I could, I turned away my face from his gaze.  I might have spared myself the effort.  He seemed to recognize nothing familiar in my countenance; perhaps his mental malady assisted my own alteration.  \"I have inquired respecting you,\" he said, after a pause, \"and I hear that you are a learned and wise man, who has seen much of the world, and played the part both of soldier and of scholar in its various theatres: is my information true?\"  \"Not true with the respect to the learning, Father, but true with regard to the experience.  I have been a pilgrim in many countries of Europe.\"  \"Indeed!\" said the Hermit, eagerly.  \"Come with me to my home, and tell me of the wonders you have seen.\"  I assisted the Hermit to rise, and he walked slowly towards the cavern, leaning upon my arm.  Ob, how that light touch thrilled through my frame!  How I longed to cry, \"Are you not the one whom I have loved, and mourned, and believed buried in the tomb?\"  But I checked myself.  We moved on in silence.  The Hermit's hand was on the door of the cavern, when he said, in a calm tone, but with evident effort, and turning his face from me while he spoke:--  \"And did your wanderings ever carry you into the farther regions of the north?  Did the fame of the great Czar ever lead you to the city he has founded?\"  \"I am right!  I am right! \" thought I, as I answered, \"In truth, holy Father, I spent not a long time at Petersburg; but I am not a stranger either to its wonders or its inhabitants.\"  \"Possibly, then, you may have met with the English favourite of the Czar of whom I hear in my retreat that men have lately spoken somewhat largely?\"  The Hermit paused again.  We were now in a long, low passage, almost in darkness.  I scarcely saw him, yet I heard a convulsed movement in his throat before he uttered the remainder of the sentence. \"He is called the Count Devereux.\"  \"Father,\" said I, calmly, \"I have both seen and known the man.\"  \"Ha!\" said the Hermit, and he leaned for a moment against the wall; \"known him--and--how--how--I mean, where is he at this present time?\"  \"That, Father, is a difficult question respecting one who has led so active a life.  He was ambassador at the court of ------ just before I left it.\"  We had now passed the passage and gained a room of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7629"],["title","Devereux â€” Volume 06 (#5)"],["body","size; an iron lamp burned within, and afforded a sufficient but somewhat dim light.  The Hermit, as I concluded my reply, sank down on a long stone bench, beside a table of the same substance, and leaning his face on his hand, so that the long, large sleeve he wore perfectly concealed his features, said, \"Pardon me; my breath is short, and my frame weak; I am quite exhausted, but will speak to you more anon.\"  I uttered a short answer, and drew a small wooden stool within a few feet of the Hermit's seat.  After a brief silence he rose, placed wine, bread, and preserved fruits before me and bade me eat.  I seemed to comply with his request, and the apparent diversion of my attention from himself somewhat relieved the embarrassment under which he evidently laboured.  \"May I hope,\" he said, \"that were my commission to this--to the Count Devereux--you would execute it faithfully and with speed?  Yet stay: you have a high mien, as of one above fortune, but your garb is rude and poor; and if aught of gold could compensate your trouble, the Hermit has other treasuries besides this cell.\"  \"I will do your bidding, Father, without robbing the poor.  You wish, then, that I should seek Morton Devereux; you wish that I should summon him hither; you wish to see and to confer with him?\"  \"God of mercy forbid!\" cried the Hermit, and with such a vehemence that I was startled from the design of revealing myself, which I was on the point of executing.  \"I would rather that these walls would crush me into dust, or that this solid stone would crumble beneath my feet,--ay, even into a bottomless pit, than meet the glance of Morton Devereux!\"  \"Is it even so?\" said I, stooping over the wine-cup; \"ye have been foes then, I suspect.  Well, it matters not: tell me your errand, and it shall be done.\"  \"Done!\" cried the Hermit, and a new and certainly a most natural suspicion darted within him, \"done! and--fool that I am!--who or what are you that I should believe you take so keen an interest in the wishes of a man utterly unknown to you?  I tell you that my wish is that you should cross seas and traverse lands until you find the man I have named to you.  Will a stranger do this, and without hire?  No--no--I was a fool, and will trust the monks, and give gold, and then my errand will be sped.\"  \"Father, or rather brother,\" said I, with a slow and firm voice, \"for you are of mine own age, and you have the passion and the infirmity which make brethren of all mankind, I am one to whom all places are alike: it matters not whether I visit a northern or a southern clime; I have wealth, which is sufficient to smooth toil; I have leisure, which makes occupation an enjoyment.  More than this, I am one who in his gayest and wildest moments has ever loved mankind, and would have renounced at any time his own pleasure for the advantage of another. But at this time, above all others, I am most disposed to forget myself, and there is a passion in your words which leads me to hope that it may be a great benefit which I can confer upon you.\"  \"You speak well,\" said the Hermit, musingly, \"and I may trust you; I will consider yet a little longer, and to-morrow at this hour you shall have my final answer.  If you execute the charge I entrust to you, may the blessing of a dying and most wretched man cleave to you forever! But hush; the clock strikes: it is my hour of prayer.\"  And, pointing to a huge black clock that hung opposite the door, and indicated the hour of nine (according to our English mode of numbering the hours), the Hermit fell on his knees, and, clasping his hands tightly, bent his face over them in the attitude of humiliation and devotion.  I followed his example.  After a few minutes he rose: \"Once in every three hours,\" said he, with a ghastly expression, \"for the last twelve years have I bowed my soul in anguish before God, and risen to feel that it was in vain: I am cursed without and within!\"  \"My Father, my Father, is this your faith in the mercies of the Redeemer who died for man?\"  \"Talk not to me of faith!\" cried the Hermit, wildly.  \"Ye laymen and worldlings know nothing of its mysteries and its powers.  But begone! the dread hour is upon me, when my tongue is loosed and my brain darkened, and I know not my words and shudder at my own thoughts. Begone! no human being shall witness those moments: they are only for Heaven and my own soul.\"  So saying, this unhappy and strange being seized me by the arm and dragged me towards the passage we had entered.  I was in doubt whether to yield to or contend with him; but there was a glare in his eye and a flush upon his brow, which, while it betrayed the dreadful disease of his mind, made me fear that resistance to his wishes might operate dangerously upon a frame so feeble and reduced.  I therefore mechanically obeyed him.  He opened again the entrance to his rugged home, and the moonlight streamed wanly over his dark robes and spectral figure.  \"Go,\" said he, more mildly than before, \"go, and forgive the vehemence of one whose mind and heart alike are broken within him.  Go, but return to-morrow at sunset.  Your air disposes me to trust you.\"  So saying, he closed the door upon me, and I stood without the cavern alone.  But did I return home?  Did I hasten to press my couch in sleep and sweet forgetfulness, while he was in that gloomy sepulture of the living, a prey to anguish, and torn by the fangs of madness and a fierce disease?  No: on the damp grass, beneath the silent skies, I passed a night which could scarcely have been less wretched than his own.  My conjecture was now and in full confirmed.  Heavens! how I loved that man! how, from my youngest years, had my soul's fondest affections interlaced themselves with him! with what anguish had I wept his imagined death! and now to know that he lay within those walls, smitten from brain to heart with so fearful and mysterious a curse,--to know, too, that he dreaded the sight of me,--of me who would have laid down my life for his! the grave, which I imagined his home, had been a mercy to a doom like this.  \"He fears,\" I murmured, and I wept as I said it, \"to look on one who would watch over, and soothe, and bear with him, with more than a woman's love!  By what awful fate has this calamity fallen on one so holy and so pure? or by what preordered destiny did I come to these solitudes, to find at the same time a new charm for the earth and a spell to change it again into a desert and a place of woe?\"  All night I kept vigil by the cave, and listened if I could catch moan or sound; but everything was silent: the thick walls of the rock kept even the voice of despair from my ear. The day dawned, and I retired among the trees, lest the Hermit might come out unawares and see me.  At sunrise I saw him appear for a few moments and again retire, and I then hastened home, exhausted and wearied by the internal conflicts of the night, to gather coolness and composure for the ensuing interview, which I contemplated at once with eagerness and dread.  At the appointed hour I repaired to the cavern: the door was partially closed; I opened it, hearing no answer to my knock, and walked gently along the passage; but I now heard shrieks and groans and wild laughter as I neared the rude chamber.  I paused for a moment, and then in terror and dismay entered the apartment.  It was empty, but I saw near the clock a small door, from within which the sounds that alarmed me proceeded.  I had no scruple in opening it, and found myself in the Hermit's sleeping chamber,--a small dark room, where, upon a straw pallet, lay the wretched occupant in a state of frantic delirium.  I stood mute and horror-struck, while his exclamations of frenzy burst upon my ear.  \"There--there!\" he cried, \"I have struck thee to the heart, and now I will kneel, and kiss those white lips, and bathe my hands in that blood!  Ha!--do I hate thee?--hate--ay--hate,--abhor, detest!  Have you the beads there?--let me tell them.  Yes, I will go to the confessional--confess?--No, no--all the priests in the world could not lift up a soul so heavy with guilt.  Help--help--help!  I am falling--falling--there is the pit, and the fire, and the devils! Do you hear them laugh?--I can laugh too!--ha! ha! ha!  Hush, I have written it all out, in a fair hand; he shall read it; and then, O God! what curses he will heap upon my head!  Blessed Saint Francis, hear me! Lazarus, Lazarus, speak for me!\"  Thus did the Hermit rave, while my flesh crept to hear him.  I stood by his bedside, and called on him, but he neither heard nor saw me.  Upon the ground, by the bed's head, as if it had dropped from under the pillow, was a packet seated and directed to myself.  I knew the handwriting at a glance, even though the letters were blotted and irregular, and possibly traced in the first moment that his present curse fell upon the writer.  I placed the packet in my bosom; the Hermit saw not the motion; he lay back on the bed, seemingly in utter exhaustion.  I turned away, and hastened to the monastery for assistance.  As I hurried through the passage, the Hermit's shrieks again broke upon me, with a fiercer vehemence than before.  I flew from them, as if they were sounds from the abyss of Hades.  I flew till, breathless, and half-senseless myself, I fell down exhausted by the gate of the monastery.  The two most skilled in physic of the brethren were immediately summoned, and they lost not a moment in accompanying me to the cavern. All that evening, until midnight, the frenzy of the maniac seemed rather to increase than abate.  But at that hour, exactly indeed as the clock struck twelve, he fell all at once into a deep sleep.  Then for the first time, but not till the weary brethren had at this favourable symptom permitted themselves to return for a brief interval to the monastery, to seek refreshment for themselves and to bring down new medicines for the patient,--then, for the first time, I rose from the Hermit's "]]]
