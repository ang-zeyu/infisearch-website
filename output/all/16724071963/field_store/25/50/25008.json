POPULATION.  1870   42,323,041  1880   56,967,216  1890   76,677,872  1900  103,208,415  1910  138,918,526  1920  186,984,335  1930  251,680,914  \"These figures show that our Country may be as populous as Europe now is at some point between 1920 and 1930--say about 1925--our territory, at seventy-three and a third persons to the square mile, being of capacity to contain 217,186,000.  \"And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance by the folly and evils of Disunion or by long and exhausting War springing from the only great element of National discord among us. While it cannot be foreseen exactly how much one huge example of Secession, breeding lesser ones indefinitely, would retard population, civilization and prosperity, no one can doubt that the extent of it would be very great and injurious.  \"The proposed Emancipation would shorten the War, perpetuate Peace, insure this increase of population, and proportionately the wealth of the Country.  With these, we should pay all the Emancipation would cost, together with our other debt, easier than we should pay our other debt without it.  \"If we had allowed our old National debt to run at six per cent. per annum, simple interest, from the end of our Revolutionary Struggle until to-day, without paying anything on either principal or interest, each man of us would owe less upon that debt now than each man owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men through the whole period has been greater than six per cent.; has run faster than the interest upon the debt.  Thus, time alone, relieves a debtor Nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumulates on its debt.  \"This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due, but it shows the great importance of time in this connection--the great advantage of a policy by which we shall not have to pay until we number a hundred millions, what, by a different policy, we would have to pay now, when we number but thirty-one millions.  In a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the War, than will be a dollar for Emancipation on the proposed plan.  And then the latter will cost no blood, no precious life.  It will be a saving of both.  \"As to the Second Article, I think it would be impracticable to return to Bondage the class of Persons therein contemplated.  Some of them, doubtless, in the property sense, belong to loyal owners and hence provision is made in this Article for compensating such.  \"The Third Article relates to the future of the Freed people.  It does not oblige, but merely authorizes, Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent.  This ought not to be regarded as objectionable on the one hand or on the other, insomuch as it comes to nothing, unless by the mutual consent of the people to be deported, and the American voters, through their Representatives in Congress.  \"I cannot make it better known than it already is, that I strongly favor colonization.  And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free Colored persons remaining in the Country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious.  \"It is insisted that their presence would injure and displace White labor and White laborers.  If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely is not now.  In times like the present men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through Time and in Eternity.  \"Is it true, then, that Colored people can displace any more White labor by being Free, than by remaining Slaves?  If they stay in their old places, they jostle no White laborers; if they leave their old places, they leave them open to White laborers.  Logically, there is neither more nor less of it.  \"Emancipation, even without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of White labor, and, very surely would not reduce them.  Thus, the customary amount of labor would still have to be performed; the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it and, very probably, for a time would do less, leaving an increased part to White laborers, bringing their labor into greater demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it.  \"With deportation, even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to White labor is mathematically certain.  Labor is like any other commodity in the market-increase the demand for it and you increase the price of it. Reduce the supply of Black labor by colonizing the Black laborer out of the Country, and by precisely so much you increase the demand for and wages of White labor.  \"But it is dreaded that the freed people will swarm forth and cover the whole Land!  Are they not already in the Land?  Will liberation make them any more numerous?  Equally distributed among the Whites of the whole Country, there would be but one Colored, in seven Whites.  Could the one, in any way, greatly disturb the seven?  \"There are many communities now, having more than one free Colored person to seven Whites; and this, without any apparent consciousness of evil from it.  The District of Columbia, and the States of Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condition.  The District has more than one free Colored to six Whites; and yet, in its frequent petitions to Congress I believe it has never presented the presence of free Colored persons as one of its grievances.  \"But why should Emancipation South, send the freed people North? people of any color, seldom run, unless there be something to run from. Heretofore, Colored people, to some extent, have fled North from bondage, and now, perhaps, from both bondage and destitution.  But if gradual Emancipation and deportation be adopted, they will have neither to flee from.  \"Their old masters will give them wages at least until new laborers can be procured; and the freed men, in turn, will gladly give their labor for the wages, till new homes can be found for them, in congenial climes, and with people of their own blood and race.  \"This proposition can be trusted on the mutual interests involved.  And, in any event, cannot the North decide for itself, whether to receive them?  \"Again, as practice proves more than theory, in any case, has there been any irruption of Colored people Northward because of the abolishment of Slavery in this District last Spring?  What I have said of the proportion of free Colored persons to the Whites in the District is from the census of 1860, having no reference to persons called Contrabands, nor to those made free by the Act of Congress abolishing Slavery here.  \"The plan consisting of these Articles is recommended, not but that a restoration of the National authority would be accepted without its adoption.  \"Nor will the War, nor proceedings under the Proclamation of September 22, 1862, be stayed because of the recommendation of this plan.  Its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring restoration, and thereby stay both.  \"And, notwithstanding this plan, the recommendation that Congress provides by law for compensating any State which may adopt Emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed.  Such would be only an advance part of the plan, and the same arguments apply to both.  \"This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others, for restoring and preserving the National authority throughout the Union.  The subject is presented exclusively in its economical aspect.  \"The plan would, I am confident, secure Peace more speedily, and maintain it more permanently, than can be done by force alone; while all it would cost, considering amounts, and manner of payment, and times of payment, would be easier paid than will be the additional cost of the War, if we rely solely upon force.  It is much, very much, that it would cost no blood at all.  \"The plan is proposed as permanent Constitutional Law.  It cannot become such without the concurrence of, first, two-thirds of Congress, and afterward, three-fourths of the Slave States.  The requisite three-fourths of the States will necessarily include seven of the Slave States.  Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting Emancipation at no very distant day upon the new Constitutional terms.  This assurance would end the struggle now and save the Union forever.  \"I do not forget the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the Nation by the Chief Magistrate of the Nation. Nor do I forget that some of you are my seniors, nor that many of you have more experience than I in the conduct of public affairs.  Yet I trust that in view of the great responsibility resting upon me, you will perceive no want of respect to yourselves in any undue earnestness I may seem to display.  \"Is it doubted, then, that the plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the War, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood?  Is it doubted that it would restore the National authority and National prosperity, and perpetuate both indefinitely?  Is it doubted that we here--Congress and Executive--can secure its adoption; will not the good people respond to a united and earnest appeal from us?  Can we, can they, by any other means so certainly or so speedily assure these vital objects; we can succeed only by concert.  \"It is not, 'Can any of us imagine better?' but,'Can we all do better?' Object whatsoever is possible, still the question recurs, 'Can we do better?  The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present.  The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.  As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.  We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our Country.  \"Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7137"],["title","The Great Conspiracy, Volume 5 (#7)"],["body",", of this Congress and this Administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves.  No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us.  The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.  \"We say we are for the Union.  The World will not forget that we say this.  We know how to save the Union.  \"The World knows we do know how to save it.  We even we here--hold the power, and bear the responsibility.  \"In giving Freedom to the Slave, we assure Freedom to the Free-Honorable alike in what we give and what we preserve.  We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last, best hope of Earth.  Other means may succeed; this could not fail.  The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just--a way which, if followed, the World would forever applaud, and God must forever bless.                                \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.\"   The popular Branch of Congress responded with heartiness to what Mr. Lincoln had done.  On December 11, 1862, resolutions were offered by Mr. Yeaman in the House of Representatives, as follows:  \"Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate Concurring), That the Proclamation of the President of the United States, of date the 22d of September, 1862, is not warranted by the Constitution.  \"Resolved, That the policy of Emancipation as indicated in that Proclamation, is not calculated to hasten the restoration of Peace, was not well chosen as a War measure, and is an assumption of power dangerous to the rights of citizens and to the perpetuity of a Free People.\"  These resolutions were laid on the table by 95 yeas to 47 nays--the yeas all Republicans, save three, and the nays all Democrats save five.  On December 15, 1862, Mr. S. C. Fessenden, of Maine, offered resolutions to the House, in these words:  \"Resolved, That the Proclamation of the President of the United States, of the date of 22d September, 1862, is warranted by the Constitution.  \"Resolved, That the policy of Emancipation, as indicated in that Proclamation, is well adapted to hasten the restoration of Peace, was well chosen as a War measure, and is an exercise of power with proper regard for the rights of the States, and the perpetuity of Free Government.\"  These resolutions were adopted by 78 yeas to 52 nays--the yeas all Republicans, save two, and the nays all Democrats, save seven.  The Proclamation of September 22d, 1862, was very generally endorsed and upheld by the People at large; and, in accordance with its promise, it was followed at the appointed time, January 1st, 1863, by the supplemental Proclamation specifically Emancipating the Slaves in the rebellious parts of the United States--in the following terms:  \"WHEREAS, On the twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-two, a Proclamation was issued by the President of the United States, containing, among other things, the following, to wit:  \"'That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all Persons held as Slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in Rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever Free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the Military and Naval Authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the Freedom of such Persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such Persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual Freedom.  \"'That the Executive will, on the First day of January aforesaid, by Proclamation, designate the States and parts of States, if any, in which the people thereof, respectively, shall then be in Rebellion against the United States; and the fact that any State, or the people thereof, shall on that day be in good faith represented in the Congress of the United States, by members chosen thereto at elections wherein a majority of the qualified voters of such States shall have participated, shall, in the absence of strong countervailing testimony, be deemed conclusive evidence that such State, and the people thereof, are not then in Rebellion against the United States.'  \"Now, therefore, I ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, in time of actual armed Rebellion against the authority and Government of the United States, and as a fit and necessary War measure for suppressing said Rebellion, do, on this First day of January, in the Year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and in accordance with my purpose so to do, publicly proclaimed for the full period of one hundred days from the day first above mentioned, Order and designate as the States and parts of States wherein the people thereof, respectively, are this day in Rebellion against the United States, the following, to wit:  \"Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana (except the parishes of St.  Bernard, Plaquemines, Jefferson, St. John, St. Charles, St. James, Ascension, Assumption, Terre Bonne, Lafouche, St. Mary, St. Martin, and Orleans, including the City of New Orleans,) Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia, and also the counties of Berkeley, Accomac, Northampton, Elizabeth City, York, Princess Ann, and Norfolk, including the cities of Norfolk and Portsmouth), and which excepted parts are for the present left precisely as if this Proclamation were not issued.  \"And by virtue of the power and for the purpose aforesaid, I do Order and declare that all Persons held as Slaves within said designated States and parts of States are, and henceforward shall be, Free; and that the Executive Government of the United States, including the Military and Naval authorities thereof; will recognize and maintain the Freedom of said Persons.  \"And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be Free, to abstain from all violence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages.  \"And I further declare and make known that such Persons, of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man vessels of all sorts in said service.  \"And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Constitution upon Military necessity, I invoke the considerate judgment of mankind and the gracious favor of Almighty God.  \"In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand, and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.  \"Done at the City of Washington, this First day of January, in the year of Our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the eighty-seventh.  \"By the President: \"ABRAHAM LINCOLN.  \"WILLIAM H.  SEWARD,  Secretary of State.\"                                   CHAPTER XIX.                             HISTORICAL REVIEW.   Let us now refresh recollection by glancing backward over the history of our Country, and we shall see, as recorded in these pages, that, from the first, there existed in this Nation a class of individuals greedily ambitious of power and determined to secure and maintain control of this Government; that they left unturned no stone which would contribute to the fostering and to the extension of African Slavery; that, hand in hand with African Slavery--and as a natural corollary to it--they advocated Free Trade as a means of degrading Free White labor to the level of Black Slave labor, and thus increasing their own power; that from the first, ever taking advantage of the general necessities of the Union, they arrogantly demanded and received from a brow-beaten People, concession after concession, and compromise after compromise; that every possible pretext and occasion was seized by them to increase, consolidate, and secure their power, and to extend the territorial limits over which their peculiar Pro-Slavery and Pro-Free-Trade doctrines prevailed; and that their nature was so exacting, and their greed so rapacious, that it was impossible ever to satisfy them.  Nor were they burdened with over-much of that high sense of honor--a quality of which they often vaunted themselves--which impelled others to stand by their agreements.  It seemed as though they considered the most sacred promises and covenants of no account, and made only to be trampled upon, when in the way of their Moloch.  We remember the bitter Slavery agitation in Congress over the admission of the State of Missouri, and how it eventuated in the Missouri Compromise.  That compromise, we have seen, they afterward trod upon, and broke, with as little compunction as they would have stepped upon and crushed a toad.  They felt their own growing power, and gloried in their strength and arrogance; and Northern timidity became a scoff and by-word in their mouths.  The fact is, that from its very conception, as well as birth, they hated and opposed the Union, because they disliked a Republican and preferred a Monarchical form of Government.  Their very inability to prevent the consummation of that Union, imbittered them.  Hence their determination to seize every possible occasion and pretext afterward to destroy it, believing, as they doubtless did, that upon the crumbled and mouldering ruins of a dissevered Union and ruptured Republic, Monarchical ideas might the more easily take root and grow.  But experience had already taught them that it would be long before their real object could even be covertly hinted at, and that in the meantime it must be kept out of sight by the agitation of other political issues.
