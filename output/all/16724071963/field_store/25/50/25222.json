They went in that direction when they left the camp.\"  \"That may be the reason for their delay,\" Ned answered. \"We should have attended to that signal ourselves,\" he added. \"There may have been some one in serious trouble down there. I hope the boys did go--that is, if nothing happens to them because of their going. Boy Scouts should assist each other at every opportunity.\"  After a little more talk regarding the boy who had been sent to Mary Brady by her son in Washington, and after Buck had been given a couple of cups of steaming hot coffee, the four started down the slope to the west.  \"Did any one say how far it was to the old lady's cabin?\" asked Jack of his chum, as they nestled down by the fire, the mountain air being cold, even in June.  \"Buck said it was three whoops and a holler!\" almost shrieked Oliver. \"Do you know what he meant by that?\"  \"I don't know,\" answered Jack, \"but I should think, from what she said, that the boys won't feel like walking back up the mountain to-night. Therefore, if Jimmie and Teddy don't come, well be alone.\"  \"I wonder if they would know the prince if they met him in the road?\" laughed Oliver. \"That kid down there is just as much the prince as I am. What did they steal the kid for, anyway?\"  \"Politics!\" yawned Jack.  \"What did they send him over here for, anyway?\"  \"Politics!\" with another yawn.  \"Aw, go on to bed!\" grinned Oliver. \"I'll build up another fire, to serve as a sort of lighthouse for the boys and sit up for them.\"  So Jack went into the tent, pulled down a great heap of blankets, drew off his coat and shoes and stockings, and was soon asleep in a neat little nest!  Oliver sat by the fire for a short time and then went up to the summit to look over the valley. The moon was rising now, and he could see the four who had recently left the camp working their way over a ridge to the south and west.  Straight down, in a canyon made by an outcropping ledge of rock, he saw a faint light, as from a campfire which had been allowed to die down.  \"The mountains are full of people to-night!\" he mused. \"If I thought I could make Uncle Ike behave himself, I'd ride down there and see who those campers are.\"  The boy stood undecided for some moments, then his eyes opened wider and he moved downward toward the fire. He was thinking of the Boy Scout signals for help which Ned and Frank had mentioned seeing!  \"I wonder if Jack would go down there with me!\"  When he reached the camp Jack was in the land of dreams, and he decided not to awake him. He could go alone just as well!  He went on down to the feeding ground and presented Uncle Ike with a lump of sugar. The mule thanked him with wiggling ears and dived a soft muzzle into his coat pocket for another lump.  \"Not until you come back, Uncle Ike!\" Oliver explained. \"If you do a good job traveling up and down the mountainside, you're going to have another piece of sugar when we get back!\"  The boy saddled and bridled the animal, mounted, and urged him away from the feeding ground. Uncle Ike, thinking his day's work finished, objected to being put into harness again, and reared and kicked until Oliver was obliged to dismount and bribe him with more sugar.  \"Will you go now, you fool mule?\" he asked.  Uncle Ike finally decided to go, and his sure feet were soon pressing the slope toward the campfire. Oliver struck the canyon just about where Jimmie and Teddy had entered it.  He left Uncle Ike there and advanced toward the campfire on foot. There were only a few embers left, and no signs of the fires which had sent up the two columns of smoke! There was no one in sight from the place where Oliver first came in direct view of the blaze.  He stepped along cautiously, listening as he walked, and soon came to a second fire. This, too, was burned down low. Beyond this he saw the dark opening of a cave in the outcropping ridge.  As Oliver stepped toward it, thinking the boys might have taken refuge there for the night, he stumbled over something which rolled under his foot and nearly fell to the ground. When he stooped over to see what it was that had tripped him, he saw an electric flashlight lying before him.  \"The boys have been here, all right,\" he mused. \"Now, I wonder if this was taken from them, or whether they lost it, or whether it was placed here to mark the trail? Either supposition may be the correct one!\"  The question was settled in a moment, for a voice which he knew came out of the darkness.  \"Found it, eh? Give it to me!\"  \"Jimmie!\" whispered Oliver.  \"Get in here out of the light of the fire!\" Jimmie whispered, \"and bring the electric in with you. Come on in, and see what we've found.\"  The opening in the ridge was a shallow one, Oliver discovered as he entered it. To his surprise he found three lads there instead of the two he had been looking for.  \"You saw the fires?\" asked Jimmie, in a low tone.  \"Of course I did. Why didn't you come to camp?\"  \"This is the boy that built the Boy Scout signals!\" Jimmie said, bringing the other forward. \"His name is Dode Surratt, and he's a bold, bad boy, being at present lookout for a gang of counterfeiters!\"  \"That's a nice clean job,\" Oliver replied. \"Where are the counterfeiters?\"  \"At work in a hole in the ground. Hear the click of their machines? They are turning out silver dollars faster than we can spend them. We hid around until they went to work, then came up to talk with Dode.\"  Jimmie pointed to a crevice in the rock and invited Oliver to look. A lance of light came up into the cave, and the boy's eyes followed it. He could see a square room below, with a bright fire burning at one end and figures moving about it.  \"Making counterfeit money, are they?\" asked Oliver.  \"That's what they're doing! We were just thinking of getting out when you came. Dode wants to go with us, but we tell him to remain with the gang until they can be rounded up by the officers.\"  Dode started to make some remark, but Jimmie stopped him.  \"They haven't got any consideration coming from you, have they?\" he asked. \"They stole you, didn't they? They brought you here from Washington to make a thief of you, didn't they?\"  \"And they beat you up for making the signals, too,\" Teddy put in. \"And they're coming out now!\" he added. \"So we'll all git--but Dode!\"     CHAPTER VIII  UNCLE IKE PRESENTS HIMSELF   Mrs. Brady and Buck walking together, Ned and Frank discussed the situation thoroughly as they descended the mountainside.  \"This may be a frame-up,\" Ned observed, \"but it is up to us to see it through. The boy who has just been brought in may be the prince, or he may be the grandson, and we are here to get the answer.\"  \"Or there may be no boy at the cabin at all!\" Frank suggested. \"The conspirators know that we are in the mountains for the purpose of looking up the prince. What better plan than the one now working could they have settled on? If they are sharp at all, they would understand that a story of a child brought on from Washington would set us in motion--would be likely to get us into a trap!\"  They scrambled on down the slope for some distance, too busy keeping upright to do any talking, then Frank went on.  \"You know very well that I'm no prophet of evil, Ned, but it looks to me that we have betrayed our mission here by taking such an interest in the child. Would a lot of boys looking for snap-shots trail off in the night to see a boy when they might have taken a look at him the next day?\"  \"If I know anything about human nature,\" Ned answered, \"those two people ahead of us are honest. If it is a frame-up, they are not in it.\"  \"Anyway,\" Frank went on, \"I'm glad the plans were changed by the arrival of Buck. It is much better for us to meet whatever is coming to us side by side than to have me sneaking back in the distance!\"  Ned agreed to this, and the two quickened their pace in order to come up with Buck and Mrs. Brady, who were now turning from the west to the south, keeping along the slope of the mountain. Directly they came to a narrow trail which led into a green valley.  Following this, they soon came to a couple of acres of cleared land, in the middle of which stood a rough cabin of peeled logs. A dim light came from a square window by the door, and there came from the interior the sound of a man's voice humming a song.  The woman drew up and looked suspiciously at Buck.  \"Who is that?\" she asked. \"You didn't tell me my son came, too.\"  \"No,\" replied Buck, \"I didn't, because, you see, Mike didn't come! He sent this young fellow in with the kid, bringing word that he would be along later.\"  \"And who is it?\" demanded the woman.  \"A likely young chap,\" was the reply. \"He asked me to get you home to-night, because he wants to leave early in the morning.\"  \"He won't leave early in the morning if he sees us here,\" Ned whispered to Frank. \"If that is the prince in there, the man with him may be the fellow who made his way into Jack's house and listened from the attic.\"  \"What are we going to do about it, then?\" asked Frank, anxiously.  \"We've got to meet him,\" Ned replied. \"Whoever he is, he knows from Buck that Mrs. Brady went up the mountain to visit a camp of strangers. We've got to go in and face him! I wish we had kept away from here to-night.\"  Mrs. Brady and Buck now opened the door and entered the cabin, the boys close behind them. A log fire was burning on a stone hearth, and a tall, rather handsome young man with light hair and blue eyes was sitting in a homemade chair before it.  He stirred the fire to a brighter blaze as they entered, and the leaping flames disclosed a dark-haired child of perhaps seven years asleep on a bed in a corner of the small room. Without speaking, without so much as a glance at the visitor, the old lady walked swiftly to the bed and took the child in her arms.  The boy opened his eyes and started to cry, but she quieted him with low words and sat down on the edge of the bed, swinging him back and forth with a motion"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7356"],["title","The Boy Scout Camera Club; Or, the Confession of a Photograph (#8)"],["body"," her arms and shoulders. The man at the fire glanced sharply at the woman and then turned his eyes to the boys, now standing not far from the bed.  \"The little dear!\" the woman cried, mothering the child. \"He's all tired out with his long journey!\"  \"This is the man that brung the boy in,\" Buck said, pointing to the figure by the fire. \"A mess of a time he must have had of it, too.\"  \"You are the grandmother?\" asked the stranger. \"Yes, I understand. And are these boys your sons, too?\" he added, nodding at Ned and Frank, suspiciously.  \"Only New York boys spending a vacation in the mountains,\" Ned said, answering the question. \"Mrs. Brady came to our camp tonight looking for her son and we came home with her. We are looking for good pictures,\" he added.  The stranger pointed to the old lady, sitting with the sleeping child on her breast.  \"There is one,\" he said.  \"Yes, and I'm sorry I haven't my camera with me.\"  \"Are you thinking of remaining in this section long?\" the visitor asked.  \"We can't say,\" laughed Ned. \"We may move on to-morrow, and may stay here a week.\"  The man's suspicions seemed to have vanished. He talked frankly with the boys, and occasionally addressed a word to the old lady. He gave her, briefly, a good report of her son's progress in Washington, and handed her a roll of bank-notes.  \"He is coming here himself soon,\" he said, \"and he will bring more. He is doing very nicely there.\"  Ned was wishing the boy would waken when the old lady arose from the bed and laid him gently down. He stirred uneasily in his sleep and she stood by his side, smoothing his dark hair away from his forehead.  \"He favors my side of the family, being dark,\" she said. \"The Stileses are all dark. If one of you boys will sit with him a moment,\" she added, with mountain hospitality, \"I'll get you all a snack. It was a long road over the mountains.\"  Ned accepted the invitation eagerly and sat down by the child. The face was dark and slender, the eyebrows turned up a trifle at the outer comers.  \"Is it Mike III., or is it the prince?\" he was asking himself when the boy awoke and sat up in bed with a jerk.  \"What's comin' off here?\" he demanded, rubbing his sleepy eyes. \"What kind of a bum game is this? I want my daddy.\"  The visitor by the fire laughed.  \"He's up in city slum talk,\" he said. \"And he's learned something of French, too, knocking around with the boys in school.\"  \"I can talk Franch like a native,\" asserted the boy.  \"And what else?\" asked the man by the fire.  \"Any old thing!\" boasted the child. \"They keep me at books all the time. I'm glad I'm with grandmother in the hills. Are you my grandmother?\" he asked, pointing to the old woman, now bending over the fire.  \"Yes, deary,\" was the reply. \"I'm going to take care of you now.\"  \"I'm glad!\"  The boy tumbled back on the bed again and closed his eyes. Frank looked at Ned significantly.  \"There's no doubt about it!\" his eyes said. \"This child is Mike III.\"  The old lady made hot corn bread and brewed a pot of mountain tea. The boys were not at all hungry, but managed to eat and drink moderately. Then Ned arose.  \"We've got to be on our way,\" he said. \"It will be morning before we get back to camp if we don't start pretty soon!\"  When the boys, after a cordial good night from Mrs. Brady and Buck, left the cabin the visitor followed them out. Ned stopped breathing, almost, as he took him by the arm.  \"There's one thing I want you to explain to the old lady after a time,\" the man said. \"I suppose I might do it myself, but I prefer to let her know from personal observation something of the case first. That boy is not exactly right.\"  \"Not mentally sound, you mean?\" asked Ned. \"He appeared to be all right just now.\"  \"Oh, he's bright enough,\" answered the other, \"but he's been ill and has been in a hospital at Washington, and has been cuddled and humored so long that he likes to boss! Not good people to boss, the attendants in a hospital, you will say, but I guess they let this kid have his way. When he was delirious they told him all sorts of fairy tales about kings and princes, and he actually thinks some of them are true. If he breaks out in any of his tantrums before you leave, kindly tell the old lady what I am telling you, will you?\"  Ned almost gasped! So the boy was likely to talk of kings and princes! He was likely to become masterful in his manners!  \"I may have to change my mind,\" he thought. \"This may be the prince, and not Mike III. But the boy's English, and there's his street slang! What about that? I reckon that we have a job on our hands!\"  The two stood talking together in the moonlight for some moments, the stranger evidently resolved to make a good impression on the boys, while Frank walked on along the trail, looking back now and then to see if his chum was coming.  \"This boy's father,\" the man went on, \"has permitted him to have his own way about everything. That was a mistake, of course, but he is trying to rectify it now by placing him under the care of his grandmother, who, if I mistake not, will see that he is properly disciplined.\"  \"It has been a long time since the father left here,\" Ned suggested.  \"Yes, along time.\"  \"He is doing well in Washington?\"  \"Yes, he is connected with the State department.\"  Ned made a mental note of that!  \"And is receiving a fair salary?\" he asked.  \"Oh, yes; he's doing nicely, far better than his mother has any notion of.\"  Here was more food for thought. Why had the father delegated the pleasant duty of taking the boy back to the old mountain home to another if he had been situated so that he might have taken the journey himself?  \"Is it the prince, or is it Mike III.?\" he kept asking himself.  While they stood there together a great clattering came down the trail, and they saw Frank turn aside and stand at attention, as if waiting for some object, seen in the distance, to come up. Directly the sounds settled down to the rattling of stones and the steady pounding of hoofs.  \"Look what's here!\" Frank shouted, pointing.  Ned moved forward, closer to the trail, and in a moment caught sight of a tall, lank, ungainly mule coming galloping toward him!  \"What do you think of him?\" called Frank. \"He's come to tell us that it is time we were home and in bed.\"  \"Uncle Ike!\" called Ned. \"Come here, you foolish mule!\"  Uncle Ike, now in plain sight, kicked up his heels in derision but finally came to an abrupt halt in front of Ned, and stood with ears pitched forward and forelegs braced back, evidently very much frightened.     CHAPTER IX  A LANK MULE AS A DECOY   Judd Bradley, the young man who had brought the boy into the mountains, stood for a moment watching the mule curiously. Then he stepped nearer to Ned, who was trying to quiet the fractious animal.  \"Be careful,\" Ned warned, as Bradley approached. \"Uncle Ike doesn't take to strangers. He may kick if you come within reach.\"  \"Hell kick you whether you come within reach or not!\" grumbled Buck, who had been brought from the cabin by the clatter of the mule's hoofs. \"He reached over forty acres of rock to hand me one on the laig!\" he added, rubbing his left thigh.  Mrs. Brady came to the doorway of the cabin and stood there, outlined against the red firelight within, with the boy in her arms. The child reached forth his arms impatiently, then began beating the old woman with his small fists.  \"Go an' get me the horse!\" he commanded. \"Mike wants a ride!\"  \"That's the prince, all right!\" whispered Frank to Ned. \"That's the prince of some slum alley in Washington. What he needs is a club, applied just before and after meals, and just before retiring, with a dose at intervals during the night!\"  \"I'm not thinking of the prince now,\" Ned returned, still in a low tone, for the others were not far off, \"I'm wondering how Uncle Ike came to be here.\"  \"Broke away and eloped with himself, probably,\" laughed Frank.  \"Yes,\" grinned Ned, \"and put on saddle and bridle before he started!\"  Frank's eyes now began to stick out.  \"S-a-a-y!\" he whispered. \"We'd better be getting back to camp! There's something out of whack there! If the mule could only talk!\"  Bradley, who had backed away at Ned's warning, now came up to the mule's head.  \"He doesn't kick with his ears, does he?\" he asked, with a smile.  \"He's an outlaw,\" Ned answered, wishing Bradley would return to the cabin. \"He's thrown one of the boys, and we must be on our way. If you have time before you leave, come up to the camp. We've got the latest things in cameras and photographic material.\"  \"I may get up there in the morning,\" was the reply.  Bradley and Mrs. Brady entered the house and closed the door, and Ned turned to his chum with an odd look on his face.  \"I've seen that man somewhere before tonight!\" he said.  \"Then you'd better try hard to place him,\" Frank answered, \"for we are going to see more of him in the future, if I'm not mistaken. Perhaps you saw him on one of your visits to Washington.\"  \"That may be,\" Ned replied. \"Anyway, I may be able to think it out before morning.\"  Uncle Ike laid his nose against Ned's shoulder and gave him a push.  \"He's in a hurry!\" the boy laughed. \"We ought to be, too! Is it possible that one of the boys saddled him for a ride on the mountain in the night?\"  \"Just like Jack or Oliver. Or Jimmie may have returned and planned one of his midnight expeditions!\"  \"Get up and ride,\" Ned advised. \"I'll walk and try to place that man's face.\"  \"You might have seen it in the rogue's gallery,\" suggested Frank, leaping into the saddle and starting away, the mule pulling and rearing every moment.  Finally Ned called out to him to stop, and walked up to his side.  \"What is the matter with Uncle Ike?\" he asked.  \"He insists on keeping down toward the canyon,\" was Frank's reply. \"We came cat-cornering down the slope, didn't we?\"  \"We certainly did,\" Ned answered, considering the matter gravely. \"Tell you what you do,\" he went on, \"let the mule have his head! Let him go just where he"]]]
