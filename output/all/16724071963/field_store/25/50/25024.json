When it was over he led Tom to a stool and said, “You waits there, Tom. I must go home for somedings. You sits there still and waits twenty minutes;” then he got on his horse and rode off muttering to himself; “Dot man moost gry, dot man moost gry.” He was back inside of twenty minutes with a bottle of wine and a cornet under his overcoat. He poured the wine into two pint-pots, made Tom drink, drank himself, and then took his cornet, stood up at the door, and played a German march into the rain after the retreating storm. The hail had passed over his vineyard and he was a ruined man too. Tom did “gry” and was all right. He was a bit disheartened, but he did another job of fencing, and was just beginning to think about “puttin' in a few vines an' fruit-trees”  when the government surveyors--whom he'd forgotten all about--had a resurrection and came and surveyed, and found that the real selection was located amongst some barren ridges across the creek. Tom reckoned it was lucky he didn't plant the orchard, and he set about shifting his home and fences to the new site. But the squatter interfered at this point, entered into possession of the farm and all on it, and took action against the selector for trespass--laying the damages at L2500.  Tom was admitted to the lunatic asylum at Parramatta next year, and the squatter was sent there the following summer, having been ruined by the drought, the rabbits, the banks, and a wool-ring. The two became very friendly, and had many a sociable argument about the feasibility--or otherwise--of blowing open the flood-gates of Heaven in a dry season with dynamite.  Tom was discharged a few years since. He knocks about certain suburbs a good deal. He is seen in daylight seldom, and at night mostly in connection with a dray and a lantern. He says his one great regret is that he wasn't found to be of unsound mind before he went up-country.    ENTER MITCHELL   The Western train had just arrived at Redfern railway station with a lot of ordinary passengers and one swagman.  He was short, and stout, and bow-legged, and freckled, and sandy. He had red hair and small, twinkling, grey eyes, and--what often goes with such things--the expression of a born comedian. He was dressed in a ragged, well-washed print shirt, an old black waistcoat with a calico back, a pair of cloudy moleskins patched at the knees and held up by a plaited greenhide belt buckled loosely round his hips, a pair of well-worn, fuzzy blucher boots, and a soft felt hat, green with age, and with no brim worth mentioning, and no crown to speak of. He swung a swag on to the platform, shouldered it, pulled out a billy and water-bag, and then went to a dog-box in the brake van.  Five minutes later he appeared on the edge of the cab platform, with an anxious-looking cattle-dog crouching against his legs, and one end of the chain in his hand. He eased down the swag against a post, turned his face to the city, tilted his hat forward, and scratched the well-developed back of his head with a little finger. He seemed undecided what track to take.  “Cab, Sir!”  The swagman turned slowly and regarded cabby with a quiet grin.  “Now, do I look as if I want a cab?”  “Well, why not? No harm, anyway--I thought you might want a cab.”  Swaggy scratched his head, reflectively.  “Well,” he said, “you're the first man that has thought so these ten years. What do I want with a cab?”  “To go where you're going, of course.”  “Do I look knocked up?”  “I didn't say you did.”  “And I didn't say you said I did.... Now, I've been on the track this five years. I've tramped two thousan' miles since last Chris'mas, and I don't see why I can't tramp the last mile. Do you think my old dog wants a cab?”  The dog shivered and whimpered; he seemed to want to get away from the crowd.  “But then, you see, you ain't going to carry that swag through the streets, are you?” asked the cabman.  “Why not? Who'll stop me! There ain't no law agin it, I b'lieve?”  “But then, you see, it don't look well, you know.”  “Ah! I thought we'd get to it at last.”  The traveller up-ended his bluey against his knee, gave it an affectionate pat, and then straightened himself up and looked fixedly at the cabman.  “Now, look here!” he said, sternly and impressively, “can you see anything wrong with that old swag o' mine?”  It was a stout, dumpy swag, with a red blanket outside, patched with blue, and the edge of a blue blanket showing in the inner rings at the end. The swag might have been newer; it might have been cleaner; it might have been hooped with decent straps, instead of bits of clothes-line and greenhide--but otherwise there was nothing the matter with it, as swags go.  “I've humped that old swag for years,” continued the bushman; “I've carried that old swag thousands of miles--as that old dog knows--an' no one ever bothered about the look of it, or of me, or of my old dog, neither; and do you think I'm going to be ashamed of that old swag, for a cabby or anyone else? Do you think I'm going to study anybody's feelings? No one ever studied mine! I'm in two minds to summon you for using insulting language towards me!”  He lifted the swag by the twisted towel which served for a shoulder-strap, swung it into the cab, got in himself and hauled the dog after him.  “You can drive me somewhere where I can leave my swag and dog while I get some decent clothes to see a tailor in,” he said to the cabman. “My old dog ain't used to cabs, you see.”  Then he added, reflectively: “I drove a cab myself, once, for five years in Sydney.”    Stiffner and Jim  (Thirdly, Bill)   We were tramping down in Canterbury, Maoriland, at the time, swagging it--me and Bill--looking for work on the new railway line. Well, one afternoon, after a long, hot tramp, we comes to Stiffner's Hotel--between Christchurch and that other place--I forget the name of it--with throats on us like sunstruck bones, and not the price of a stick of tobacco.  We had to have a drink, anyway, so we chanced it. We walked right into the bar, handed over our swags, put up four drinks, and tried to look as if we'd just drawn our cheques and didn't care a curse for any man. We looked solvent enough, as far as swagmen go. We were dirty and haggard and ragged and tired-looking, and that was all the more reason why we might have our cheques all right.  This Stiffner was a hard customer. He'd been a spieler, fighting man, bush parson, temperance preacher, and a policeman, and a commercial traveller, and everything else that was damnable; he'd been a journalist, and an editor; he'd been a lawyer, too. He was an ugly brute to look at, and uglier to have a row with--about six-foot-six, wide in proportion, and stronger than Donald Dinnie.  He was meaner than a gold-field Chinaman, and sharper than a sewer rat: he wouldn't give his own father a feed, nor lend him a sprat--unless some safe person backed the old man's I.O.U.  We knew that we needn't expect any mercy from Stiffner; but something had to be done, so I said to Bill:  “Something's got to be done, Bill! What do you think of it?”  Bill was mostly a quiet young chap, from Sydney, except when he got drunk--which was seldom--and then he was a customer, from all round. He was cracked on the subject of spielers. He held that the population of the world was divided into two classes--one was spielers and the other was the mugs. He reckoned that he wasn't a mug. At first I thought he was a spieler, and afterwards I thought that he was a mug. He used to say that a man had to do it these times; that he was honest once and a fool, and was robbed and starved in consequences by his friends and relations; but now he intended to take all that he could get. He said that you either had to have or be had; that men were driven to be sharps, and there was no help for it.  Bill said:  “We'll have to sharpen our teeth, that's all, and chew somebody's lug.”  “How?” I asked.  There was a lot of navvies at the pub, and I knew one or two by sight, so Bill says:  “You know one or two of these mugs. Bite one of their ears.”  So I took aside a chap that I knowed and bit his ear for ten bob, and gave it to Bill to mind, for I thought it would be safer with him than with me.  “Hang on to that,” I says, “and don't lose it for your natural life's sake, or Stiffner'll stiffen us.”  We put up about nine bob's worth of drinks that night--me and Bill--and Stiffner didn't squeal: he was too sharp. He shouted once or twice.  By-and-by I left Bill and turned in, and in the morning when I woke up there was Bill sitting alongside of me, and looking about as lively as the fighting kangaroo in London in fog time. He had a black eye and eighteen pence. He'd been taking down some of the mugs.  “Well, what's to be done now?” I asked. “Stiffner can smash us both with one hand, and if we don't pay up he'll pound our swags and cripple us. He's just the man to do it. He loves a fight even more than he hates being had.”  “There's only one thing to be done, Jim,” says Bill, in a tired, disinterested tone that made me mad.  “Well, what's than” I said.  “Smoke!”  “Smoke be damned,” I snarled, losing my temper.  “You know dashed well that our swags are in the bar, and we can't smoke without them.  “Well, then,” says Bill, “I'll toss you to see who's to face the landlord.”  “Well, I'll be blessed!” I says. “I'll see you further first. You have got a front. You mugged that stuff away, and you'll have to get us out of the mess.”  It made him wild to be called a mug, and we swore and growled at each other for a while; but we daren't speak loud enough to have a fight, so at last I agreed to toss up for it, and I lost.  Bill started to give me some of his points, but I shut him up quick.  “You've had your turn, and made a mess of it,” I said. “For God's sake give me a show. Now, I'll go into the bar and ask for the swags, and carry them out on to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7144"],["title","While the Billy Boils (#3)"],["body","a, and then go back to settle up. You keep him talking all the time. You dump the two swags together, and smoke like sheol. That's all you've got to do.”  I went into the bar, got the swags front the missus, carried them out on to the veranda, and then went back.  Stiffner came in.  “Good morning!”  “Good morning, sir,” says Stiffner.  “It'll be a nice day, I think?”  “Yes, I think so. I suppose you are going on?”  “Yes, we'll have to make a move to-day.”  Then I hooked carelessly on to the counter with one elbow, and looked dreamy-like out across the clearing, and presently I gave a sort of sigh and said: “Ah, well! I think I'll have a beer.”  “Right you are! Where's your mate?”  “Oh, he's round at the back. He'll be round directly; but he ain't drinking this morning.”  Stiffner laughed that nasty empty laugh of his. He thought Bill was whipping the cat.  “What's yours, boss?” I said.  “Thankee!... Here's luck!”  “Here's luck!”  The country was pretty open round there--the nearest timber was better than a mile away, and I wanted to give Bill a good start across the flat before the go-as-you-can commenced; so I talked for a while, and while we were talking I thought I might as well go the whole hog--I might as well die for a pound as a penny, if I had to die; and if I hadn't I'd have the pound to the good, anyway, so to speak. Anyhow, the risk would be about the same, or less, for I might have the spirit to run harder the more I had to run for--the more spirits I had to run for, in fact, as it turned out--so I says:  “I think I'll take one of them there flasks of whisky to last us on the road.”  “Right y'are,” says Stiffner. “What'll ye have--a small one or a big one?”  “Oh, a big one, I think--if I can get it into my pocket.”  “It'll be a tight squeeze,” he said, and he laughed.  “I'll try,” I said. “Bet you two drinks I'll get it in.”  “Done!” he says. “The top inside coat-pocket, and no tearing.”  It was a big bottle, and all my pockets were small; but I got it into the pocket he'd betted against. It was a tight squeeze, but I got it in.  Then we both laughed, but his laugh was nastier than usual, because it was meant to be pleasant, and he'd lost two drinks; and my laugh wasn't easy--I was anxious as to which of us would laugh next.  Just then I noticed something, and an idea struck me--about the most up-to-date idea that ever struck me in my life. I noticed that Stiffner was limping on his right foot this morning, so I said to him:  “What's up with your foot?” putting my hand in my pocket. “Oh, it's a crimson nail in my boot,” he said. “I thought I got the blanky thing out this morning; but I didn't.”  There just happened to be an old bag of shoemaker's tools in the bar, belonging to an old cobbler who was lying dead drunk on the veranda. So I said, taking my hand out of my pocket again:  “Lend us the boot, and I'll fix it in a minute. That's my old trade.”  “Oh, so you're a shoemaker,” he said. “I'd never have thought it.”  He laughs one of his useless laughs that wasn't wanted, and slips off the boot--he hadn't laced it up--and hands it across the bar to me. It was an ugly brute--a great thick, iron-bound, boiler-plated navvy's boot. It made me feel sore when I looked at it.  I got the bag and pretended to fix the nail; but I didn't.  “There's a couple of nails gone from the sole,” I said. “I'll put 'em in if I can find any hobnails, and it'll save the sole,” and I rooted in the bag and found a good long nail, and shoved it right through the sole on the sly. He'd been a bit of a sprinter in his time, and I thought it might be better for me in the near future if the spikes of his running-shoes were inside.  “There, you'll find that better, I fancy,” I said, standing the boot on the bar counter, but keeping my hand on it in an absent-minded kind of way. Presently I yawned and stretched myself, and said in a careless way:  “Ah, well! How's the slate?” He scratched the back of his head and pretended to think.  “Oh, well, we'll call it thirty bob.”  Perhaps he thought I'd slap down two quid.  “Well,” I says, “and what will you do supposing we don't pay you?”  He looked blank for a moment. Then he fired up and gasped and choked once or twice; and then he cooled down suddenly and laughed his nastiest laugh--he was one of those men who always laugh when they're wild--and said in a nasty, quiet tone:  “You thundering, jumped-up crawlers! If you don't (something) well part up I'll take your swags and (something) well kick your gory pants so you won't be able to sit down for a month--or stand up either!”  “Well, the sooner you begin the better,” I said; and I chucked the boot into a corner and bolted.   He jumped the bar counter, got his boot, and came after me. He paused to slip the boot on--but he only made one step, and then gave a howl and slung the boot off and rushed back. When I looked round again he'd got a slipper on, and was coming--and gaining on me, too. I shifted scenery pretty quick the next five minutes. But I was soon pumped. My heart began to beat against the ceiling of my head, and my lungs all choked up in my throat. When I guessed he was getting within kicking distance I glanced round so's to dodge the kick. He let out; but I shied just in time. He missed fire, and the slipper went about twenty feet up in the air and fell in a waterhole.  He was done then, for the ground was stubbly and stony. I seen Bill on ahead pegging out for the horizon, and I took after him and reached for the timber for all I was worth, for I'd seen Stiffner's missus coming with a shovel--to bury the remains, I suppose; and those two were a good match--Stiffner and his missus, I mean.  Bill looked round once, and melted into the bush pretty soon after that. When I caught up he was about done; but I grabbed my swag and we pushed on, for I told Bill that I'd seen Stiffner making for the stables when I'd last looked round; and Bill thought that we'd better get lost in the bush as soon as ever we could, and stay lost, too, for Stiffner was a man that couldn't stand being had.  The first thing that Bill said when we got safe into camp was: “I told you that we'd pull through all right. You need never be frightened when you're travelling with me. Just take my advice and leave things to me, and we'll hang out all right. Now-.”  But I shut him up. He made me mad.  “Why, you--! What the sheol did _you_ do?”  “Do?” he says. “I got away with the swags, didn't I? Where'd they be now if it wasn't for me?”  Then I sat on him pretty hard for his pretensions, and paid him out for all the patronage he'd worked off on me, and called him a mug straight, and walked round him, so to speak, and blowed, and told him never to pretend to me again that he was a battler.  Then, when I thought I'd licked him into form, I cooled down and soaped him up a bit; but I never thought that he had three climaxes and a crisis in store for me.  He took it all pretty cool; he let me have my fling, and gave me time to get breath; then he leaned languidly over on his right side, shoved his left hand down into his left trouserpocket, and brought up a boot-lace, a box of matches, and nine-and-six.  As soon as I got the focus of it I gasped:  “Where the deuce did you get that?”  “I had it all along,” he said, “but I seen at the pub that you had the show to chew a lug, so I thought we'd save it--nine-and-sixpences ain't picked up every day.”  Then he leaned over on his left, went down into the other pocket, and came up with a piece of tobacco and half-a-sovereign.  My eyes bulged out.  “Where the blazes did you get that from?” I yelled.  “That,” he said, “was the half-quid you give me last night. Half-quids ain't to be thrown away these times; and, besides, I had a down on Stiffner, and meant to pay him out; I reckoned that if we wasn't sharp enough to take him down we hadn't any business to be supposed to be alive. Anyway, I guessed we'd do it; and so we did--and got a bottle of whisky into the bargain.”  Then he leaned back, tired-like, against the log, and dredged his upper left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and brought up a sovereign wrapped in a pound note. Then he waited for me to speak; but I couldn't. I got my mouth open, but couldn't get it shut again.  “I got that out of the mugs last night, but I thought that we'd want it, and might as well keep it. Quids ain't so easily picked up, nowadays; and, besides, we need stuff more'n Stiffner does, and so--”  “And did he know you had the stuff?” I gasped.  “Oh, yes, that's the fun of it. That's what made him so excited. He was in the parlour all the time I was playing. But we might as well have a drink!  “We did. I wanted it.”   Bill turned in by-and-by, and looked like a sleeping innocent in the moonlight. I sat up late, and smoked, and thought hard, and watched Bill, and turned in, and thought till near daylight, and then went to sleep, and had a nightmare about it. I dreamed I chased Stiffner forty miles to buy his pub, and that Bill turned out to be his nephew.  Bill divvied up all right, and gave me half a crown over, but I didn't travel with him long after that. He was a decent young fellow as far as chaps go, and a good mate as far as mates go; but he was too far ahead for a peaceful, easy-going chap like me. It would have worn me out in a year to keep up to him.  P.S.--The name of this should have been: 'Bill and Stiffner (thirdly, Jim)'     WHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN   Jack Drew sat on the edge of the shaft, with his foot in the loop and one hand on the rope, ready to descend. His elder brother, Tom, stood at one end of the windlass and the third mate at the other. Jack paused before swinging off, looked up at his brother, and impulsively held out his hand:  “You ain't going to let the sun go down, are you, Tom?”  But Tom kept both hands on the windlass-handle and said nothing.  “Lower away!”  They lowered him to the bottom, and Tom shouldered his pick in silence and walked off to the tent. He found the tin plate, "]]]
