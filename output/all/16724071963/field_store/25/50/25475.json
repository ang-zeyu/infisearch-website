Our knowledge of the intellectual spirit of the age, therefore, only becomes perfect when we contrast the success of the Impostor with the fate of the true Genius.  And as the prejudices of the populace ran high against all mechanical contrivances for altering the settled conditions of labour, [Even in the article of bonnets and hats, it appears that certain wicked fulling mills were deemed worthy of a special anathema in the reign of Edward IV. These engines are accused of having sought, \"by subtle imagination,\" the destruction of the original makers of hats and bonnets\" by man's strength,--that is, with hands and feet; \"and an act of parliament was passed (22d of Edward IV.) to put down the fabrication of the said hats and bonnets by mechanical contrivance.] so probably, in the very instinct and destiny of Genius which ever drive it to a war with popular prejudice, it would be towards such contrivances that a man of great ingenuity and intellect, if studying the physical sciences, would direct his ambition.  Whether the author, in the invention he has assigned to his philosopher (Adam Warner), has too boldly assumed the possibility of a conception so much in advance of the time, they who have examined such of the works of Roger Bacon as are yet given to the world can best decide; but the assumption in itself belongs strictly to the most acknowledged prerogatives of Fiction; and the true and important question will obviously be, not whether Adam Warner could have constructed his model, but whether, having so constructed it, the fate that befell him was probable and natural.  Such characters as I have here alluded to seemed, then, to me, in meditating the treatment of the high and brilliant subject which your eloquence animated me to attempt, the proper Representatives of the multiform Truths which the time of Warwick the King-maker affords to our interests and suggests for our instruction; and I can only wish that the powers of the author were worthier of the theme.  It is necessary that I now state briefly the foundation of the Historical portions of this narrative.  The charming and popular \"History of Hume,\" which, however, in its treatment of the reign of Edward IV. is more than ordinarily incorrect, has probably left upon the minds of many of my readers, who may not have directed their attention to more recent and accurate researches into that obscure period, an erroneous impression of the causes which led to the breach between Edward IV. and his great kinsman and subject, the Earl of Warwick.  The general notion is probably still strong that it was the marriage of the young king to Elizabeth Gray, during Warwick's negotiations in France for the alliance of Bona of Savoy (sister-in- law to Louis XI.), which exasperated the fiery earl, and induced his union with the House of Lancaster.  All our more recent historians have justly rejected this groundless fable, which even Hume (his extreme penetration supplying the defects of his superficial research) admits with reserve.  [\"There may even some doubt arise with regard to the proposal of marriage made to Bona of Savoy,\" etc.--HUME, note to p. 222, vol. iii. edit. 1825.]  A short summary of the reasons for this rejection is given by Dr. Lingard, and annexed below.  [\"Many writers tell us that the enmity of Warwick arose from his disappointment caused by Edward's clandestine marriage with Elizabeth. If we may believe them, the earl was at the very time in France negotiating on the part of the king a marriage with Bona of Savoy, sister to the Queen of France; and having succeeded in his mission, brought back with him the Count of Dampmartin as ambassador from Louis.  To me the whole story appears a fiction.  1. It is not to be found in the more ancient historians.  2. Warwick was not at the time in France.  On the 20th of April, ten days before the marriage, he was employed in negotiating a truce with the French envoys in London (Rym. xi. 521), and on the 26th of May, about three weeks after it, was appointed to treat of another truce with the King of Scots (Rym. xi. 424).  3. Nor could he bring Dampmartin with him to England; for that nobleman was committed a prisoner to the Bastile in September, 1463, and remained there till May, 1465 (Monstrel. iii. 97, 109).  Three contemporary and well-informed writers, the two continuators of the History of Croyland and Wyrcester, attribute his discontent to the marriages and honours granted to the Wydeviles, and the marriage of the princess Margaret with the Duke of Burgundy.\"--LINGARD, vol. iii. c. 24, pp. 5, 19, 4to ed.]  And, indeed, it is a matter of wonder that so many of our chroniclers could have gravely admitted a legend contradicted by all the subsequent conduct of Warwick himself; for we find the earl specially doing honour to the publication of Edward's marriage, standing godfather to his first-born (the Princess Elizabeth), employed as ambassador or acting as minister, and fighting for Edward, and against the Lancastrians, during the five years that elapsed between the coronation of Elizabeth and Warwick's rebellion.  The real causes of this memorable quarrel, in which Warwick acquired his title of King-maker, appear to have been these.  It is probable enough, as Sharon Turner suggests, [Sharon Turner: History of England, vol. iii. p. 269.] that Warwick was disappointed that, since Edward chose a subject for his wife, he neglected the more suitable marriage he might have formed with the earl's eldest daughter; and it is impossible but that the earl should have been greatly chafed, in common with all his order, by the promotion of the queen's relations, [W. Wyr. 506, 7.  Croyl. 542.] new men and apostate Lancastrians.  But it is clear that these causes for discontent never weakened his zeal for Edward till the year 1467, when we chance upon the true origin of the romance concerning Bona of Savoy, and the first open dissension between Edward and the earl.  In that year Warwick went to France, to conclude an alliance with Louis XI., and to secure the hand of one of the French princes [Which of the princes this was does not appear, and can scarcely be conjectured.  The \"Pictorial History of England\" (Book v. 102) in a tone of easy decision says \"it was one of the sons of Louis XI.\"  But Louis had no living sons at all at the time.  The Dauphin was not born till three years afterwards.  The most probable person was the Duke of Guienne, Louis's brother.] for Margaret, sister to Edward IV.; during this period, Edward received the bastard brother of Charles, Count of Charolois, afterwards Duke of Burgundy, and arranged a marriage between Margaret and the count.  Warwick's embassy was thus dishonoured, and the dishonour was aggravated by personal enmity to the bridegroom Edward had preferred. [The Croyland Historian, who, as far as his brief and meagre record extends, is the best authority for the time of Edward IV., very decidedly states the Burgundian alliance to be the original cause of Warwick's displeasure, rather than the king's marriage with Elizabeth: \"Upon which (the marriage of Margaret with Charolois) Richard Nevile, Earl of Warwick, who had for so many years taken party with the French against the Burgundians, conceived great indignation; and I hold this to be the truer cause of his resentment than the king's marriage with Elizabeth, for he had rather have procured a husband for the aforesaid princess Margaret in the kingdom of France.\"  The Croyland Historian also speaks emphatically of the strong animosity existing between Charolois and Warwick.--Cont. Croyl. 551.]  The earl retired in disgust to his castle.  But Warwick's nature, which Hume has happily described as one of \"undesigning frankness and openness,\" [Hume, \"Henry VI.,\" vol. iii. p. 172, edit. 1825.] does not seem to have long harboured this resentment.  By the intercession of the Archbishop of York and others, a reconciliation was effected, and the next year, 1468, we find Warwick again in favour, and even so far forgetting his own former cause of complaint as to accompany the procession in honour of Margaret's nuptials with his private foe.  [Lingard.]  In the following year, however, arose the second dissension between the king and his minister,--namely, in the king's refusal to sanction the marriage of his brother Clarence with the earl's daughter Isabel,--a refusal which was attended with a resolute opposition that must greatly have galled the pride of the earl, since Edward even went so far as to solicit the Pope to refuse his sanction, on the ground of relationship.  [Carte.  Wm. Wyr.]  The Pope, nevertheless, grants the dispensation, and the marriage takes place at Calais.  A popular rebellion then breaks out in England.  Some of Warwick's kinsmen-- those, however, belonging to the branch of the Nevile family that had always been Lancastrians, and at variance with the earl's party--are found at its head.  The king, who is in imminent danger, writes a supplicating letter to Warwick to come to his aid.  [\"Paston Letters,\" cxcviii. vol. ii., Knight's ed.  See Lingard, c. 24, for the true date of Edward's letters to Warwick, Clarence, and the Archbishop of York.] The earl again forgets former causes for resentment, hastens from Calais, rescues the king, and quells the rebellion by the influence of his popular name.  We next find Edward at Warwick's castle of Middleham, where, according to some historians, he is forcibly detained,--an assertion treated by others as a contemptible invention.  This question will be examined in the course of this work; [See Note II.] but whatever the true construction of the story, we find that Warwick and the king are still on such friendly terms, that the earl marches in person against a rebellion on the borders, obtains a signal victory, and that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7715"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 01 (#2)"],["body","rebel leader (the earl's own kinsman) is beheaded by Edward at York.  We find that, immediately after this supposed detention, Edward speaks of Warwick and his brothers \"as his best friends;\" [\"Paston Letters,\" cciv. vol. ii., Knight's ed.  The date of this letter, which puzzled the worthy annotator, is clearly to be referred to Edward's return from York, after his visit to Middleham in 1469.  No mention is therein made by the gossiping contemporary of any rumour that Edward had suffered imprisonment.  He enters the city in state, as having returned safe and victorious from a formidable rebellion.  The letter goes on to say: \"The king himself hath (that is, holds) good language of the Lords Clarence, of Warwick, etc., saying 'they be his best friends.'\"  Would he say this if just escaped from a prison?  Sir John Paston, the writer of the letter, adds, it is true, \"But his household men have (hold) other language.\" very probably, for the household men were the court creatures always at variance with Warwick, and held, no doubt, the same language they had been in the habit of holding before.] that he betroths his eldest daughter to Warwick's nephew, the male heir of the family.  And then suddenly, only three months afterwards (in February, 1470), and without any clear and apparent cause, we find Warwick in open rebellion, animated by a deadly hatred to the king, refusing, from first to last, all overtures of conciliation; and so determined is his vengeance, that he bows a pride, hitherto morbidly susceptible, to the vehement insolence of Margaret of Anjou, and forms the closest alliance with the Lancastrian party, in the destruction of which his whole life had previously been employed.  Here, then, where History leaves us in the dark, where our curiosity is the most excited, Fiction gropes amidst the ancient chronicles, and seeks to detect and to guess the truth.  And then Fiction, accustomed to deal with the human heart, seizes upon the paramount importance of a Fact which the modern historian has been contented to place amongst dubious and collateral causes of dissension.  We find it broadly and strongly stated by Hall and others, that Edward had coarsely attempted the virtue of one of the earl's female relations.  \"And farther it erreth not from the truth,\" says Hall,  \"that the king did attempt a thing once in the earl's house, which was much against the earl's honesty; but whether it was the daughter or the niece,\" adds the chronicler, \"was not, for both their honours, openly known; but surely such a thing WAS attempted by King Edward,\" etc.  Any one at all familiar with Hall (and, indeed, with all our principal chroniclers, except Fabyan), will not expect any accurate precision as to the date he assigns for the outrage.  He awards to it, therefore, the same date he erroneously gives to Warwick's other grudges (namely, a period brought some years lower by all judicious historians) a date at which Warwick was still Edward's fastest friend.  Once grant the probability of this insult to the earl (the probability is conceded at once by the more recent historians, and received without scruple as a fact by Rapia, Habington, and Carte), and the whole obscurity which involves this memorable quarrel vanishes at once.  Here was, indeed, a wrong never to be forgiven, and yet never to be proclaimed.  As Hall implies, the honour of the earl was implicated in hushing the scandal, and the honour of Edward in concealing the offence.  That if ever the insult were attempted, it must have been just previous to the earl's declared hostility is clear.  Offences of that kind hurry men to immediate action at the first, or else, if they stoop to dissimulation the more effectually to avenge afterwards, the outbreak bides its seasonable time.  But the time selected by the earl for his outbreak was the very worst he could have chosen, and attests the influence of a sudden passion,--a new and uncalculated cause of resentment.  He had no forces collected; he had not even sounded his own brother-in-law, Lord Stanley (since he was uncertain of his intentions); while, but a few months before, had he felt any desire to dethrone the king, he could either have suffered him to be crushed by the popular rebellion the earl himself had quelled, or have disposed of his person as he pleased when a guest at his own castle of Middleham.  His evident want of all preparation and forethought--a want which drove into rapid and compulsory flight from England the baron to whose banner, a few months afterwards, flocked sixty thousand men--proves that the cause of his alienation was fresh and recent.  If, then, the cause we have referred to, as mentioned by Hall and others, seems the most probable we can find (no other cause for such abrupt hostility being discernible), the date for it must be placed where it is in this work,--namely, just prior to the earl's revolt. The next question is, who could have been the lady thus offended, whether a niece or daughter.  Scarcely a niece, for Warwick had one married brother, Lord Montagu, and several sisters; but the sisters were married to lords who remained friendly to Edward, [Except the sisters married to Lord Fitzhugh and Lord Oxford.  But though Fitzhugh, or rather his son, broke into rebellion, it was for some cause in which Warwick did not sympathize, for by Warwick himself was that rebellion put down; nor could the aggrieved lady have been a daughter of Lord Oxford, for he was a stanch, though not avowed, Lancastrian, and seems to have carefully kept aloof from the court.] and Montagu seems to have had no daughter out of childhood, [Montagu's wife could have been little more than thirty at the time of his death. She married again, and had a family by her second husband.] while that nobleman himself did not share Warwick's rebellion at the first, but continued to enjoy the confidence of Edward.  We cannot reasonably, then, conceive the uncle to have been so much more revengeful than the parents,--the legitimate guardians of the honour of a daughter.  It is, therefore, more probable that the insulted maiden should have been one of Lord Warwick's daughters; and this is the general belief. Carte plainly declares it was Isabel.  But Isabel it could hardly have been.  She was then married to Edward's brother, the Duke of Clarence, and within a month of her confinement.  The earl had only one other daughter, Anne, then in the flower of her youth; and though Isabel appears to have possessed a more striking character of beauty, Anne must have had no inconsiderable charms to have won the love of the Lancastrian Prince Edward, and to have inspired a tender and human affection in Richard Duke of Gloucester.  [Not only does Majerus, the Flemish annalist, speak of Richard's early affection to Anne, but Richard's pertinacity in marrying her, at a time when her family was crushed and fallen, seems to sanction the assertion.  True, that Richard received with her a considerable portion of the estates of her parents.  But both Anne herself and her parents were attainted, and the whole property at the disposal of the Crown.  Richard at that time had conferred the most important services on Edward.  He had remained faithful to him during the rebellion of Clarence; he had been the hero of the day both at Barnet and Tewksbury.  His reputation was then exceedingly high, and if he had demanded, as a legitimate reward, the lands of Middleham, without the bride, Edward could not well have refused them.  He certainly had a much better claim than the only other competitor for the confiscated estates,--namely, the perjured and despicable Clarence.  For Anne's reluctance to marry Richard, and the disguise she assumed, see Miss Strickland's \"Life of Anne of Warwick.\"  For the honour of Anne, rather than of Richard, to whose memory one crime more or less matters but little, it may here be observed that so far from there being any ground to suppose that Gloucester was an accomplice in the assassination of the young prince Edward of Lancaster, there is some ground to believe that that prince was not assassinated at all, but died (as we would fain hope the grandson of Henry V. did die) fighting manfully in the field.-- \"Harleian Manuscripts;\" Stowe, \"Chronicle of Tewksbury;\" Sharon Turner, vol. iii. p. 335.]  It is also noticeable, that when, not as Shakspeare represents, but after long solicitation, and apparently by positive coercion, Anne formed her second marriage, she seems to have been kept carefully by Richard from his gay brother's court, and rarely, if ever, to have appeared in London till Edward was no more.  That considerable obscurity should always rest upon the facts connected with Edward's meditated crime,--that they should never be published amongst the grievances of the haughty rebel is natural from the very dignity of the parties, and the character of the offence; that in such obscurity sober History should not venture too far on the hypothesis suggested by the chronicler, is right and laudable.  But probably it will be conceded by all, that here Fiction finds its lawful province, and that it may reasonably help, by no improbable nor groundless conjecture, to render connected and clear the most broken and the darkest fragments of our annals.  I have judged it better partially to forestall the interest of the reader in my narrative, by stating thus openly what he may expect, than to encounter the far less favourable impression (if he had been hitherto a believer in the old romance of Bona of Savoy), [I say the old romance of Bona of Savoy, so far as Edward's rejection of her hand for that of Elizabeth Gray is stated to have made the cause of his quarrel with Warwick.  But I do not deny the possibility that such a marriage had been contemplated and advised by Warwick, though he neither sought to negotiate it, nor was wronged by Edward's preference of his fair subject.] that the author was taking an unwarrantable liberty"]]]
