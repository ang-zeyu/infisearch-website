INTRIGUES OF THE COURT OF EDWARD IV.     CHAPTER I.  MARGARET OF ANJOU.  The day after the events recorded in the last section of this narrative, and about the hour of noon, Robert Hilyard (still in the reverend disguise in which he had accosted Hastings) bent his way through the labyrinth of alleys that wound in dingy confusion from the Chepe towards the river.  The purlieus of the Thames, in that day of ineffective police, sheltered many who either lived upon plunder, or sought abodes that proffered, at alarm, the facility of flight.  Here, sauntering in twos or threes, or lazily reclined by the threshold of plaster huts, might be seen that refuse population which is the unholy offspring of civil war,--disbanded soldiers of either Rose, too inured to violence and strife for peaceful employment, and ready for any enterprise by which keen steel wins bright gold.  At length our friend stopped before the gate of a small house, on the very marge of the river, which belonged to one of the many religious orders then existing; but from its site and aspect denoted the poverty seldom their characteristic.  Here he knocked; the door was opened by a lay-brother; a sign and a smile were interchanged, and the visitor was ushered into a room belonging to the superior, but given up for the last few days to a foreign priest, to whom the whole community appeared to consider the reverence of a saint was due.  And yet this priest, who, seated alone, by a casement which commanded a partial view of the distant Tower of London, received the conspirator, was clad in the humblest serge.  His face was smooth and delicate; and the animation of the aspect, the vehement impatience of the gesture, evinced little of the holy calm that should belong to those who have relinquished the affairs of earth for meditation on the things of heaven.  To this personage the sturdy Hilyard bowed his manly knees; and casting himself at the priest's feet, his eyes, his countenance, changed from their customary hardihood and recklessness into an expression at once of reverence and of pity.  \"Well, man--well, friend--good friend, tried and leal friend, speak! speak!\" exclaimed the priest, in an accent that plainly revealed a foreign birth.  \"Oh, gracious lady! all hope is over; I come but to bid you fly.  Adam Warner was brought before the usurper; he escaped, indeed, the torture, and was faithful to the trust. But the papers--the secret of the rising--are in the hands of Hastings.\"  \"How long, O Lord,\" said Margaret of Anjou, for she it was, under that reverend disguise, \"how long wilt Thou delay the hour of triumph and revenge?\"  The princess as she spoke had suffered her hood to fall back, and her pale, commanding countenance, so well fitted to express fiery and terrible emotion, wore that aspect in which many a sentenced man had read his doom,--an aspect the more fearful, inasmuch as the passion that pervaded it did not distort the features, but left them locked, rigid, and marble-like in beauty, as the head of the Medusa.  \"The day will dawn at last,\" said Hilyard; \"but the judgments of Heaven are slow.  We are favoured, at the least, that our secret is confined to a man more merciful than his tribe.\"  He then related to Margaret his interview with Hastings at the house of the Lady Lougueville, and continued: \"This morning, not an hour since, I sought him (for last evening he did not leave Edward, a council met at the Tower), and learned that he had detected the documents in the recesses of Warner's engine.  Knowing from your Highness and your spies that he had been open to the gifts of Charolois, I spoke to him plainly of the guerdon that should await his silence.  'Friar,' he answered, 'if in this court and this world I have found it were a fool's virtue to be more pure than others, and if I know that I should but provoke the wrath of those who profit by Burgundian gold, were I alone to disdain its glitter, I have still eno' of my younger conscience left me not to make barter of human flesh.  Did I give these papers to King Edward, the heads of fifty gallant men, whose error is but loyalty to their ancient sovereign, would glut the doomsman; but,' he continued, 'I am yet true to my king and his cause; I shall know how to advise Edward to the frustrating all your schemes.  The districts where you hoped a rising will be guarded, the men ye count upon will be watched: the Duke of Gloucester, whose vigilance never sleeps, has learned that the Lady Margaret is in England, disguised as a priest.  To-morrow all the religious houses will be searched; if thou knowest where she lies concealed, bid her lose not an hour to fly.'\"  \"I Will NOT fly!\" exclaimed Margaret; \"let Edward, if he dare, proclaim to my people that their queen is in her city of London.  Let him send his hirelings to seize her.  Not in this dress shall she be found.  In robes of state, the sceptre in her hand, shall they drag the consort of their king to the prison-house of her palace.\"  \"On my knees, great queen, I implore you to be calm; with the loss of your liberty ends indeed all hope of victory, all chance even of struggle.  Think not Edward's fears would leave to Margaret the life that his disdain has spared to your royal spouse.  Between your prison and your grave, but one secret and bloody step!  Be ruled; no time to lose!  My trusty Hugh even now waits with his boat below.  Relays of horses are ready, night and day, to bear you to the coast; while seeking your restoration, I have never neglected the facilities for flight.  Pause not, O gracious lady; let not your son say, 'My mother's passion has lost me the hope of my grandsire's crown.'\"  \"My boy; my princely boy, my Edward!\" exclaimed Margaret, bursting into tears, all the warrior-queen merged in the remembrance of the fond mother.  \"Ah, faithful friend! he is so gallant and so beautiful! Oh, he shall reward thee well hereafter!\"  \"May he live to crush these barons, and raise this people!\" said the demagogue of Redesdale.  \"But now, save thyself!\"  \"But what! is it not possible yet to strike the blow?  Rather let us spur to the north; rather let us hasten the hour of action, and raise the Red Rose through the length and breadth of England!\"  \"Ah, lady, if without warrant from your lord; if without foreign subsidies; if without having yet ripened the time; if without gold, without arms, and without one great baron on our side, we forestall a rising, all that we have gained is lost; and instead of war, you can scarcely provoke a riot.  But for this accursed alliance of Edward's daughter with the brother of icy-hearted Louis, our triumph had been secure.  The French king's gold would have manned a camp, bribed the discontented lords, and his support have sustained the hopes of the more leal Lancastrians.  But it is in vain to deny, that if Lord Warwick win Louis--\"  \"He will not! he shall not!--Louis, mine own kinsman!\" exclaimed Margaret, in a voice in which the anguish pierced through the louder tone of resentment and disdain.  \"Let us hope that he will not,\" replied Hilyard, soothingly; some chance may yet break off these nuptials, and once more give us France as our firm ally.  But now we must be patient.  Already Edward is fast wearing away the gloss of his crown; already the great lords desert his court; already, in the rural provinces, peasant and franklin complain of the exactions of his minions; already the mighty House of Nevile frowns sullen on the throne it built.  Another year, and who knows but the Earl of Warwick,--the beloved and the fearless, whose statesman-art alone hath severed from you the arms and aid of France, at whose lifted finger all England would bristle with armed men--may ride by the side of Margaret through the gates of London?\"  \"Evil-omened consoler, never!\" exclaimed the princess, starting to her feet, with eyes that literally shot fire.  \"Thinkest thou that the spirit of a queen lies in me so low and crushed, that I, the descendant of Charlemagne, could forgive the wrongs endured from Warwick and his father?  But thou, though wise and loyal, art of the Commons; thou knowest not how they feel through whose veins rolls the blood of kings!\"  A dark and cold shade fell over the bold face of Robin of Redesdale at these words.  \"Ah, lady,\" he said, with bitterness, \"if no misfortune can curb thy pride, in vain would we rebuild thy throne.  It is these Commons, Margaret of Anjou--these English Commons--this Saxon People, that can alone secure to thee the holding of the realm which the right arm wins.  And, beshrew me, much as I love thy cause, much as thou hast with thy sorrows and thy princely beauty glamoured and spelled my heart and my hand,--ay, so that I, the son of a Lollard, forget the wrongs the Lollards sustained from the House of Lancaster; so that I, who have seen the glorious fruitage of a Republic, yet labour for thee, to overshadow the land with the throne of ONE--yet--yet, lady-- yet, if I thought thou wert to be the same Margaret as of old, looking back to thy dead kings, and contemptuous of thy living people, I would not bid one mother's son lift lance or bill on thy behalf.\"  So resolutely did Robin of Redesdale utter these words, that the queen's haughty eye fell abashed as he spoke; and her craft, or her intellect, which was keen and prompt where her passions did not deafen and blind her judgment, instantly returned to her.  Few women equalled this once idol of knight and minstrel, in the subduing fascination that she could exert in her happier moments.  Her affability was as gracious as her wrath was savage; and with a dignified and winning frankness, she extended her hand to her ally, as she answered, in a sweet, humble, womanly, and almost penitent voice,--  \"O bravest and lealest of friends, forgive thy wretched queen.  Her troubles distract her brain,--chide her not if they sour her speech.

Then, with a sigh, she turned to Hilyard, and resumed more calmly, \"Yes, thou art right, --adversity hath taught me much.  And though adversity will too often but feed and not starve our pride, yet thou--thou hast made me know that there is more of true nobility in the blunt Children of the People than in many a breast over which flows the kingly robe. Forgive me, and the daughter of Charlemagne shall yet be a mother to the Commons, who claim thee as their brother!\"  Thoroughly melted, Robin of Redesdale bowed over the hand held to his lips, and his rough voice trembled as he answered, though that answer took but the shape of prayer.  \"And now,\" said the princess, smiling, \"to make peace lasting between us, I conquer myself, I yield to thy counsels.  Once more the fugitive, I abandon the city that contains Henry's unheeded prison. See, I am ready.  Who will know Margaret in this attire?  Lead on!\"  Rejoiced to seize advantage of this altered and submissive mood, Robin instantly took the way through a narrow passage, to a small door communicating with the river.  There Hugh was waiting in a small boat, moored to the damp and discoloured stairs.  Robin, by a gesture, checked the man's impulse to throw himself at the feet of the pretended priest, and bade him put forth his best speed. The princess seated herself by the helm, and the little boat cut rapidly through the noble stream.  Galleys, gay and gilded, with armorial streamers, and filled with nobles and gallants, passed them, noisy with mirth or music, on their way.  These the fallen sovereign heeded not; but, with all her faults, the woman's heart beating in her bosom--she who in prosperity had so often wrought ruin, and shame, and woe to her gentle lord; she who had been reckless of her trust as queen; and incurred grave--but, let us charitably hope, unjust-- suspicion of her faith as wife, still fixed her eyes on the gloomy tower that contained her captive husband, and felt that she could have forgotten a while even the loss of power if but permitted to fall on that plighted heart, and weep over the past with the woe-worn bridegroom of her youth.     CHAPTER II.  IN WHICH ARE LAID OPEN TO THE READER THE CHARACTER OF EDWARD THE FOURTH AND THAT OF HIS COURT, WITH THE MACHINATIONS OF THE WOODVILLES AGAINST THE EARL OF WARWICK.  Scarcely need it be said to those who have looked with some philosophy upon human life, that the young existence of Master Marmaduke Nevile, once fairly merged in the great common sea, will rarely reappear before us individualized and distinct.  The type of the provincial cadet of the day hastening courtwards to seek his fortune, he becomes lost amidst the gigantic characters and fervid passions that alone stand forth in history.  And as, in reading biography, we first take interest in the individual who narrates, but if his career shall pass into that broader and more stirring life, in which he mingles with men who have left a more dazzling memory than his own, we find the interest change from the narrator to those by whom he is surrounded and eclipsed,--so, in this record of a time, we scarce follow our young adventurer into the court of the brilliant Edward ere the scene itself allures and separates us from our guide; his mission is, as it were, well-nigh done.  We leave, then, for a while this bold, frank nature-fresh from the health of the rural life--gradually to improve, or deprave itself, in the companionship it finds.  The example of the Lords Hastings, Scales, and Worcester, and the accomplishments of the two younger Princes of York, especially the Duke of Gloucester, had diffused among the younger and gayer part of the court that growing taste for letters which had somewhat slept during the dynasty of the House of Lancaster; and Marmaduke's mind became aware that learning was no longer the peculiar distinction of the Church, and that Warwick was behind his age when he boasted \"that the sword was more familiar to him than the pen.\"  He had the sagacity to perceive that the alliance with the great earl did not conduce to his popularity at court; and even in the king's presence, the courtiers permitted themselves many taunts and jests at the fiery Warwick, which they would have bitten out their tongues ere they would have vented before the earl himself.  But though the Nevile sufficiently controlled his native candour not to incur unprofitable quarrel by ill-mannered and unseasonable defence of the hero-baron when sneered at or assailed, he had enough of the soldier and the man in him not to be tainted by the envy of the time and place,--not to lose his gratitude to his patron, nor his respect for the bulwark of the country.  Rather, it may be said, that Warwick gained in his estimation whenever compared with the gay and silken personages who avenged themselves by words for his superiority in deeds.  Not only as a soldier, but as a statesman, the great and peculiar merits of the earl were visible in all those measures which emanated solely from himself.  Though so indifferently educated, his busy, practical career, his affable mixing with all classes, and his hearty, national sympathies made him so well acquainted with the interests of his country and the habits of his countrymen, that he was far more fitted to rule than the scientific Worcester or the learned Scales.  The Young Duke of Gloucester presented a marked contrast to the general levity of the court, in speaking of this powerful nobleman.  He never named him but with respect, and was pointedly courteous to even the humblest member of the earl's family.  In this he appeared to advantage by the side of Clarence, whose weakness of disposition made him take the tone of the society in which he was thrown, and who, while really loving Warwick, often smiled at the jests against him,--not, indeed, if uttered by the queen or her family, of whom he ill concealed his jealousy and hatred.  The whole court was animated and pregnant with a spirit of intrigue, which the artful cunning of the queen, the astute policy of Jacquetta, and the animosity of the different factions had fomented to a degree quite unknown under former reigns.  It was a place in which the wit of young men grew old rapidly; amidst stratagem, and plot, and ambitious design, and stealthy overreaching, the boyhood of Richard III.  passed to its relentless manhood: such is the inevitable fruit of that era in civilization when a martial aristocracy first begins to merge into a voluptuous court.  Through this moving and shifting web of ambition and intrigue the royal Edward moved with a careless grace: simple himself, because his object was won, and pleasure had supplanted ambition.  His indolent, joyous temper served to deaden his powerful intellect; or, rather, his intellect was now lost in the sensual stream through which it flowed. Ever in pursuit of some new face, his schemes and counterschemes were limited to cheat a husband or deceive a wife; and dexterous and successful no doubt they were.  But a vice always more destructive than the love of women began also to reign over him,--namely, the intemperance of the table.  The fastidious and graceful epicurism of the early Normans, inclined to dainties but abhorring excess, and regarding with astonished disdain the heavy meals and deep draughts of the Saxon, had long ceased to characterize the offspring of that noblest of all noble races.  Warwick, whose stately manliness was disgusted with whatever savoured of effeminacy or debauch, used to declare that he would rather fight fifty battles for Edward IV. than once sup with him!  Feasts were prolonged for hours, and the banquets of this king of the Middle Ages almost resembled those of the later Roman emperors.  The Lord Montagu did not share the abstemiousness of his brother of Warwick.  He was, next to Hastings, the king's chosen and most favourite companion.  He ate almost as much as the king, and drank very little less.  Of few courtiers could the same be said! Over the lavish profligacy and excess of the court, however, a veil dazzling to the young and high-spirited was thrown.  Edward was thoroughly the cavalier, deeply imbued with the romance of chivalry, and, while making the absolute woman his plaything, always treated the ideal woman as a goddess.  A refined gallantry, a deferential courtesy to dame and demoiselle, united the language of an Amadis with the licentiousness of a Gaolor; and a far more alluring contrast than the court of Charles II. presented to the grim Commonwealth seduced the vulgar in that of this most brave and most beautiful prince, when compared with the mournful and lugubrious circles in which Henry VI. had reigned and prayed.  Edward himself, too, it was so impossible to judge with severe justice, that his extraordinary popularity in London, where he was daily seen, was never diminished by his faults; he was so bold in the field, yet so mild in the chamber; when his passions slept, he was so thoroughly good-natured and social, so kind to all about his person, so hearty and gladsome in his talk and in his vices, so magnificent and so generous withal; and, despite his indolence, his capacities for business were marvellous,--and these last commanded the reverence of the good Londoners; he often administered justice himself, like the caliphs of the East, and with great acuteness and address.  Like most extravagant men, he had a wholesome touch of avarice.  That contempt for commerce which characterizes a modern aristocracy was little felt by the nobles of that day, with the exception of such blunt patricians as Lord Warwick or Raoul de Fulke.
