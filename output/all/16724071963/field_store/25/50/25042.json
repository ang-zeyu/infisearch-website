(#1)"],["body"," the woman's strong grasp, and now and then cried out in vexation--  \"Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of thy paltry goods.\"  The crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a brawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows, made a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson; but just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing force upon the man's arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it remarking pleasantly, at the same time--  \"Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and uncharitable words.  This is matter for the law's consideration, not private and unofficial handling.  Loose thy hold from the boy, goodwife.\"  The blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went muttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy's wrist reluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently closed their mouths.  The King sprang to his deliverer's side, with flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming--  \"Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir Miles; carve me this rabble to rags!\"    Chapter XXIII. The Prince a prisoner.  Hendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King's ear--  \"Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily--nay, suffer it not to wag at all.  Trust in me--all shall go well in the end.\" Then he added to himself:  \"SIR Miles!  Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a knight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth take upon his quaint and crazy fancies! . . . An empty and foolish title is mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is more honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of the REAL kingdoms of this world.\"  The crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about to lay his hand upon the King's shoulder, when Hendon said--  \"Gently, good friend, withhold your hand--he shall go peaceably; I am responsible for that.  Lead on, we will follow.\"  The officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King followed after, with the crowd at their heels.  The King was inclined to rebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice--  \"Reflect, Sire--your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty; shall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect them? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on his throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was seemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and submitted to its authority?\"  \"Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King of England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself suffer while he holdeth the station of a subject.\"  When the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the peace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who had committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so the King stood convicted.  The bundle was now unrolled, and when the contents proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked troubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an electric shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected by his ignorance.  The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then turned to the woman, with the question--  \"What dost thou hold this property to be worth?\"  The woman courtesied and replied--  \"Three shillings and eightpence, your worship--I could not abate a penny and set forth the value honestly.\"  The justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to the constable, and said--  \"Clear the court and close the doors.\"  It was done.  None remained but the two officials, the accused, the accuser, and Miles Hendon.  This latter was rigid and colourless, and on his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended together, and trickled down his face.  The judge turned to the woman again, and said, in a compassionate voice--  \"'Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for these be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an evil face--but when hunger driveth--Good woman! dost know that when one steals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha'penny the law saith he shall HANG for it?\"  The little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled himself and held his peace; but not so the woman.  She sprang to her feet, shaking with fright, and cried out--  \"Oh, good lack, what have I done!  God-a-mercy, I would not hang the poor thing for the whole world!  Ah, save me from this, your worship--what shall I do, what CAN I do?\"  The justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said--  \"Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ upon the record.\"  \"Then in God's name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day that freed my conscience of this awesome thing!\"  Miles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King and wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging him. The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig; and when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into the narrow hall.  The justice proceeded to write in his record book.  Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer followed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and listened.  He heard a conversation to this effect--  \"It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here is the eightpence.\"  \"Eightpence, indeed!  Thou'lt do no such thing.  It cost me three shillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old Harry that's just dead ne'er touched or tampered with.  A fig for thy eightpence!\"  \"Stands the wind in that quarter?  Thou wast under oath, and so swore falsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence.  Come straightway back with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!--and then the lad will hang.\"  \"There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content.  Give me the eightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter.\"  The woman went off crying:  Hendon slipped back into the court room, and the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some convenient place.  The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King a wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment in the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging.  The astounded King opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to be beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and succeeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it. Hendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the two departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail.  The moment the street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his hand, and exclaimed--  \"Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail ALIVE?\"  Hendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply--  \"WILL you trust in me?  Peace! and forbear to worsen our chances with dangerous speech.  What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it, thou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient--'twill be time enow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened.\" {1}    Chapter XXIV. The escape.  The short winter day was nearly ended.  The streets were deserted, save for a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the intent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands as quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising wind and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to the right nor to the left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem to see them. Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his way to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before. By-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and proceeded to cross it.  When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon laid his hand upon his arm, and said in a low voice--  \"Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a word to thee.\"  \"My duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on.\"  \"Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly.  Turn thy back a moment and seem not to see:  LET THIS POOR LAD ESCAPE.\"  \"This to me, sir!  I arrest thee in--\"  \"Nay, be not too hasty.  See thou be careful and commit no foolish error\"--then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man's ear--\"the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck, man!\"  The poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then found his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon was tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then said--  \"I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee come to harm.  Observe, I heard it all--every word.  I will prove it to thee.\" Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman had had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with--  \"There--have I set it forth correctly?  Should not I be able to set it forth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?\"  The man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied, and said with forced lightness--  \"'Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the woman for mine amusement.\"  \"Kept you the woman's pig for amusement?\"  The man answered sharply--  \"Nought else, good sir--I tell thee 'twas but a jest.\"  \"I do begin to believe thee,\" said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of mockery and half-conviction in his tone; \"but tarry thou here a moment whilst I run and ask his worship--for"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7160"],["title","The Prince and the Pauper, Part 7. (#2)"],["body","s, he being a man experienced in law, in jests, in--\"  He was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted, spat out an oath or two, then cried out--  \"Hold, hold, good sir--prithee wait a little--the judge!  Why, man, he hath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!--come, and we will speak further.  Ods body!  I seem to be in evil case--and all for an innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my wife and little ones--List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst thou of me?\"  \"Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a hundred thousand--counting slowly,\" said Hendon, with the expression of a man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one.  \"It is my destruction!\" said the constable despairingly.  \"Ah, be reasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and see how mere a jest it is--how manifestly and how plainly it is so.  And even if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that e'en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and warning from the judge's lips.\"  Hendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him--  \"This jest of thine hath a name, in law,--wot you what it is?\"  \"I knew it not!  Peradventure I have been unwise.  I never dreamed it had a name--ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original.\"  \"Yes, it hath a name.  In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis lex talionis sic transit gloria mundi.\"  \"Ah, my God!\"  \"And the penalty is death!\"  \"God be merciful to me a sinner!\"  \"By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy, thou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha'penny, paying but a trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive barratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem expurgatis in statu quo--and the penalty is death by the halter, without ransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy.\"  \"Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me!  Be thou merciful--spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought that shall happen.\"  \"Good! now thou'rt wise and reasonable.  And thou'lt restore the pig?\"  \"I will, I will indeed--nor ever touch another, though heaven send it and an archangel fetch it.  Go--I am blind for thy sake--I see nothing.  I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by force.  It is but a crazy, ancient door--I will batter it down myself betwixt midnight and the morning.\"  \"Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving charity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer's bones for his escape.\"    Chapter XXV. Hendon Hall.  As soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his Majesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and wait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account. Half an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on Hendon's sorry steeds.  The King was warm and comfortable, now, for he had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which Hendon had bought on London Bridge.  Hendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that hard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be bad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise would be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken intellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the tormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages toward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying the impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day.  When he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a considerable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn. The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King's chair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was ready for bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept athwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.  The next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking over the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily enjoying each other's narratives.  Hendon detailed all his wide wanderings in search of the King, and described how the archangel had led him a fool's journey all over the forest, and taken him back to the hut, finally, when he found he could not get rid of him.  Then--he said--the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back looking broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy had returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so.  Hendon had waited at the hut all day; hope of the King's return died out, then, and he departed upon the quest again.  \"And old Sanctum Sanctorum WAS truly sorry your highness came not back,\" said Hendon; \"I saw it in his face.\"  \"Marry I will never doubt THAT!\" said the King--and then told his own story; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.  During the last day of the trip, Hendon's spirits were soaring. His tongue ran constantly.  He talked about his old father, and his brother Arthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and generous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith, and was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and brotherly things about Hugh.  He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting at Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody, and what an outburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.  It was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road led through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with gentle elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding undulations of the sea.  In the afternoon the returning prodigal made constant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock he might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home.  At last he was successful, and cried out excitedly--  \"There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You may see the towers from here; and that wood there--that is my father's park. Ah, NOW thou'lt know what state and grandeur be! A house with seventy rooms--think of that!--and seven and twenty servants!  A brave lodging for such as we, is it not so?  Come, let us speed--my impatience will not brook further delay.\"  All possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o'clock before the village was reached.  The travellers scampered through it, Hendon's tongue going all the time.  \"Here is the church--covered with the same ivy--none gone, none added.\"  \"Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,--and yonder is the market-place.\"  \"Here is the Maypole, and here the pump --nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years make a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know me.\"  So his chat ran on. The end of the village was soon reached; then the travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall hedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a vast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars bore sculptured armorial devices.  A noble mansion was before them.  \"Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!\" exclaimed Miles.  \"Ah, 'tis a great day!  My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with joy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first transports of the meeting, and so thou'lt seem but coldly welcomed--but mind it not; 'twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my ward, and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou'lt see them take thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon's sake, and make their house and hearts thy home for ever after!\"  The next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door, helped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within. A few steps brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King with more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a writing-table in front of a generous fire of logs.  \"Embrace me, Hugh,\" he cried, \"and say thou'rt glad I am come again! and call our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and see his face, and hear his voice once more!\"  But Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent a grave stare upon the intruder--a stare which indicated somewhat of offended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward thought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with a real or assumed compassion.  Presently he said, in a mild voice--  \"Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered privations and rude buffetings at the world's hands; thy looks and dress betoken it.  Whom dost thou take me to be?\"  \"Take thee?  Prithee for whom else than whom thou art?  I take thee to be Hugh Hendon,\" said Miles, sharply.  The other continued, in the same soft tone--  \"And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?\"  \"Imagination hath nought to do with it!  Dost thou pretend thou knowest me not for thy brother Miles Hendon?\"  An expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh's face, and he exclaimed--  \"What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life?  God be praised if it be so!  Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these cruel years!  Ah, it seems too good to be true, it IS too good to be true--I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me!  Quick--come to the light--let me scan thee well!\"  He seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to devour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and that, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him from all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with gladness, smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying--  \"G"]]]
