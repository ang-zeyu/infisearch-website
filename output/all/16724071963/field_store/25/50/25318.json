So you understand why it was that Alice did not start and show any fear when she looked around and saw the warrior standing less than ten feet off, and attentively watching her.  \"You can't play Jack Stones as well as I,\" she said, looking saucily up at him.  \"I beat you,\" was his reply, as he strode forward and sat down cross legged on the grass.  \"I'd like to see you do it! You think you're very smart, don't you?\"  A shadowy smile played around the stern mouth, and the Delaware, who had studied the simple game long enough to understand it, began the sport under the observant eyes of his little mistress.  While both were intent on the amusement, Mrs. Ripley came to the door and stood wonderingly looking at them.  \"It does seem as if Indians are human beings like the rest of us,\" was her thought; \"but who could resist her gentle ways?\"  Up went the single stone in the air, and Omas grabbed the batch that were lying on the ground, and then caught the first as it came down.  \"That won't do!\" called Alice, seizing the brawny hand, which--sad to say--had been stained with blood as innocent as hers; \"you didn't do that fair!\"  \"What de matter?\" he asked, looking reproachfully into the round face almost against his own.  \"I'll show you how. Now, I lay those three on the ground like that. Then I toss up this, pick up one without touching any of the others, keep it in my hand and pick up the next--see?\"  She illustrated her instruction by her work, while her pupil listened and stared.  \"I know--I know,\" he said quickly. \"I show you.\" Then the wag of a Delaware tossed the first stone fully twenty feet aloft, caught up the others, and took that on the fly.  \"I never saw anybody as dumb as you,\" was the comment. \"What is the use of your trying? You couldn't learn to play Jack Stones in ever so long.\"  She was about to try him again, when, childlike, she darted off upon a widely different subject, for it had just come into her little head.  \"Omas, when you were here the other day, you promised that the next time you came to see me you would bring Linna.\"  \"Dat so--Omas promise.\"  \"Then why haven't you done as you said?\"  \"Omas never speak with double tongue; he bring Linna with him.\"  \"You did?--where is she?\" asked Alice, springing to her feet, clasping her hands, and looking expectantly around.  The Delaware emitted a shrill, tremulous whistle, and immediately from the wood several rods behind them came running the oddest looking little girl anyone could have met in a long time.  Her face was as round as that of Alice, her long, black hair hung loosely over her shoulders, her small eyes were as black as jet, her nose a pug, her teeth as white and regular as were ever seen, while her dress was a rude imitation of her father's except the skirt came below her knees. Her feet were as small as a doll's, and encased in the beaded little moccasins, were as pretty as they could be.  \"That is Linna,\" said the proud father as she came obediently forward.    CHAPTER TWO: DANGER IN THE AIR  Little Linna, daughter of Omas, the Delaware warrior, was of the same age as Alice Ripley. The weather was warm although she wore tiny moccasins to protect her feet, she scorned the superfluous stockings and undergarments that formed a part of the other's apparel.  Her hair was as black, abundant, and almost as long as her father's; but her face was clean, and, perhaps in honor of the occasion, she, too, sported a gaudy eagle feather in her hair.  She bounded out of the green wood like a fawn, but as she drew near her parent and Alice, her footsteps became slower, and she halted a few paces away, hung her head, with her forefinger between her pretty white teeth--for all the world like any white girl of her years.  But Alice did not allow her to remain embarrassed. She had been begging for this visit, and now, when she saw her friend, she ran forward, took her little plump hand and said--\"Linna, I am real glad you have come!\"  Omas had risen to his feet, and watched the girls with an affection and interest which found no expression on his painted face. His child looked timidly up to him and walked slowly forward, her hand clasped in that of Alice. She did not speak, but when her escort sat down on the grass, she did the same.  \"Linna, do you know how to play Jack Stones?\" asked Alice, picking up the pebbles.  Linna shook her head quickly several times, but her lips remained mute.  \"Your father thought he knew how, but he don't; he doesn't play fair, either. Let me show you, so you can beat him when you go home.\"  Alice set to work, while the bright black eyes watched every movement.  \"Now do you want to try it?\" she asked, after going through the game several times.  Linna nodded her head with the same birdlike quickness, and reached out her chubby hand.  Her father and Alice watched her closely. She made several failures at first, all of which were patiently explained by her tutor; by and by she went through the performance from beginning to end without a break.  Alice clapped her hands with delight, and Omas--certain that no grownup person saw him--smiled with pleasure.  \"Doesn't she know how to talk?\" asked Alice, looking up at the warrior. Omas spoke somewhat sharply to his child in the Delaware tongue. She startled, and looking at Alice, asked--  \"Do--yoo think me play well?\"  Alice was delighted to find she could make herself understood so easily. It was wonderful how she had learned to speak English so early in life.  \"I guess you can,\" was the ready reply of Alice; \"your father can't begin to play as well. When you go home you can show your mamma how to play Jack Stones. Have you any brothers and sisters?\"  \"No; me have no brother--no sister.\"  \"That's too bad! I've got a big brother Ben. He isn't home now, but he will be here to supper. He's a nice boy, and you will like him. Let's go in the house now to see mamma, and you can teach me how to talk Indian.\"  Both girls bounded to their feet, and hand in hand, walked to the door, with Omas gravely stalking after them.  Mrs. Ripley had learned of the visitor, and stood on the threshold to welcome her. She took her by the hand and led her inside. Omas paused, as if in doubt whether he should follow; but her invitation to him was so cordial, that he stepped within and seated himself on a chair.  That afternoon and night could never be forgotten by Alice Ripley. In a very little while she and her visitor were on the best of terms; laughing, romping, and chasing each other in and out of doors, just as if they were twin sisters that had never been separated from each other.  When Mrs. Ripley asked Omas for how long a time he could leave his child with them, he said he must take her back that evening. His wigwam was a good many miles away in the woods, and he would have to travel all night to reach the village of his tribe.  Mrs. Ripley, however, pleaded so hard, that he consented to let his child stay until he came back the next day or soon thereafter for her.  When he rose to go, the long summer day was drawing to a close. He spoke to Linna in their native tongue. She was sitting on the floor just then, playing with a wonderful rag baby, but was up in a flash, and followed him outside.  \"Wait a moment and she will come back,\" said Mrs. Ripley to her own child. She knew what the movement meant: Omas did not wish anyone to see him and Linna.  On the outside he moved to the left, and glanced around to make sure that no person was looking that way. Then he lifted the little one from the ground; she threw her arms around his neck, and he pressed her to his breast and kissed her several times with great warmth. Then he set her down, and she ran laughing into the house, while he strode off to the woods.  But at the moment of entering them he stopped abruptly, wheeled about, and walked slowly back toward the cabin.  Upon the return of Linna, Mrs. Ripley stepped to the front door to look for her son. He was not in sight, but Omas had stopped again hardly a rod distant. He stood a moment, looking fixedly at her, and then beckoned with his free hand for her to approach.  Without hesitation she stepped off the broad flat stone and went to him.  \"What is it, Omas?\" she asked in an undertone, pausing in front of him, and gazing up into the grim, painted countenance.  The Delaware returned the look for a few seconds, as if studying how to say what was in his mind. Then in a voice lower even than hers, he said--\"You--little girl--big boy--go way soon--must not stay here.\"  \"Why do you say that, Omas?\"  \"Iroquois like leaves on trees--white men, call Tories--soon come down here--kill all white people--kill you--kill little girl, big boy--if you stay here.\"  The pioneer's wife had heard the same rumors for days past. She knew there was cause for fear, for nearly all the able bodied men in Wyoming were absent with the patriot army, fighting for independence. The inhabitants in the valley had begged Congress to send some soldiers to protect them, and the relatives of the women and children had asked again and again that they might go home to save their loved ones from the Tories and Indians; but the prayer was refused. The soldiers in the army were too few to be spared, and no one away from Wyoming believed the danger as great as it was.  But the people themselves knew the peril, and did their best to prepare for it. But who should know more about the Indians and Tories than Omas, the great Delaware warrior?  When, therefore, he said these words to Mrs. Ripley, that woman's heart beat faster. She heard the laughter and prattle of the children in the house, and she thought of that bright boy, playing with his young friends not far away.  \"Where can we go?\" she asked, in the same guarded voice.  \"With Omas,\" was the prompt reply; \"hide in wigwam of Omas. Nobody hurt palefaced friend of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7493"],["title","The Daughter of the Chieftain : the Story of an Indian Girl (#2)"],["body",".\"  It was a trying situation. The brave woman, who had passed through many dangers with her husband, knew what a visit from the Tories and Indians meant; but she shrank from leaving Wyoming, and all her friends and neighbors.  \"When will they come?\" she asked; \"will it be in a few weeks or in a few days?\"  \"Getting ready now; Brandt with Iroquois--Butler with Tory--soon be here.\"  \"But do you mean that we shall all go with you tonight?\"  The Delaware was silent for a few seconds. His active brain was busy, reviewing the situation.  \"No,\" he finally said; \"stay here till Omas come back; then go with him--all go--den no one be hurt.\"  \"Very well; we will wait till you come to us again. We will take good care of Linna.\"  And without another word the Delaware turned once more, strode to the forest, which was then in fullest leaf, and vanished among the trees.  Mrs. Ripley walked slowly back to the door. On the threshold she halted, and looked around again for her absent boy. It was growing dark, and she began to feel a vague alarm for him.  A whistle fell on her ear. It was the sweetest music she had ever heard, for it came from the lips of her boy.  He was in sight, coming along the well worn path that led in front of the other dwellings and to her own door. When he saw her, he waved his hand in salutation, but could not afford to break in on the vigorous melody which kept his lips puckered.  She saw he was carrying something on his shoulder. A second glance showed that it was one of the heavy rifles used by the pioneers a hundred years ago. The sight--taken with what Omas had just said--filled her heart with forebodings.  She waited until the lad came up. He kissed her affectionately, and then in the offhand manner of a big boy, let the butt of the gun drop on the ground, leaned the top away from him, and glancing from it to his mother, asked--\"What do you think of it?\"  \"It seems to be a good gun. Whose is it?\"  \"Mine,\" was the proud response. \"Colonel Butler ordered that it be given to me, and I'm to use it, too, mother.\"  \"For what purpose?\"  \"The other Colonel Butler--you know he is a cousin to ours--has got a whole lot of Tories\" (who, you know, were Americans fighting against their countrymen) \"and Indians, and they're coming down to wipe out Wyoming; but I guess they will find it a harder job than they think.\"  And to show his contempt for the danger, the muscular lad lifted his weighty weapon to a level, and pretended to sight it at a tree.  \"I wish that was a Tory or one of those Six Nation Indians--wouldn't I drop him!\"  The mother could not share the buoyancy of her son. She stepped outside, so as to be beyond the hearing of the little ones.  \"Omas has been here; that is his little girl that you hear laughing with Alice. He has told me the same as you--the Tories and Indians are coming, and he wants us to flee with him.\"  \"What does he mean by that?\" asked the half indignant boy.  \"He says they will put us all to death, and if we do not go with him, we will be killed too.\"  The handsome face of Benjamin Ripley took on an expression of scorn, and as he straightened up, he seemed to become several inches taller.  \"He forgets that I am with you! Omas is very kind; but he and his Tory friends had better look out for themselves. Why, with the men at the fort, Colonel Butler will have several hundred.\"  \"But they are mostly old men and boys.\"  \"Well,\" said the high spirited lad, with a twinkle of his fine hazel eyes, \"add up a lot of old men and boys, and the average is the same number of middle aged men, isn't it? Don't you worry, mother--things are all right. If Omas comes back, give him our thanks, and tell him we are not going to sneak off when we are needed at home.\"  It was hard to resist the contagion of Ben's hopefulness. The mother not only loved but respected him as much as she could have done had he been several years older. He had been her mainstay for the two years past, during which the father was absent with the patriot army; and she came to lean upon him more and more, though her heart sank when Ben began to talk of following his father into the ranks, to help in the struggle for independence.  She found herself looking upon the situation as Ben did. If so great danger threatened Wyoming, it would be cowardly for them to leave their friends to their fate. It was clear all could not find safety by going, and she would feel she was doing wrong if she gave no heed to the others.  Ben was tall and strong for his years, and the fact that he had taken the gun from Colonel Butler to be used in taking care of the settlement bound the youth in honor to do so.  \"It shall be as you say,\" said the mother; \"I cannot be as hopeful as you, but it is our duty to stay. We will not talk about it before the children.\"  \"I want to see how a little Indian girl looks,\" muttered Ben with a laugh, following his mother into the house.  Alice caught sight of him, and was in his arms the next instant, while Linna rose to her feet, and stood with her forefinger between her teeth, shyly studying the newcomer.  \"Helloa, Linna! how are you?\" he called, setting down his young sister and catching up the little Indian. Not only that, but he gave her a resounding smack on her dusky cheek.  \"I always like pretty little girls, and I'm going to be your beau: what do you say? Is it a bargain?\"  It is not to be supposed that the Delaware miss caught the whole meaning of this momentous question. She was a little overwhelmed by the rush of the big boy's manner, and nodded her head about a dozen times.  \"There, Alice; do you understand that?\" he asked, making the room ring with his merry laughter; \"I'm to be Linna's beau. How do you like it?\"  \"I'm glad for you, but I--guess--I oughter be sorry for Linna.\"    CHAPTER THREE: JULY THIRD, 1778  While Ben Ripley was frolicking with little Alice and her Indian friend Linna, the mother prepared the evening meal.  The candles were lighted, and they took their places at the table.  All this was new and strange to Linna. In her own home, she was accustomed to sit on the ground, and use only her fingers for knife and fork when taking food; but she was observant and quick, and knowing how it had been with her, her friends soon did away with her embarrassment. The mother cut her meat into small pieces, spread butter--which the visitor looked at askance--on the brown bread, and she had but to do as the rest, and all went well.  A few minutes after supper both girls became drowsy, and Mrs. Ripley, candle in hand, conducted them upstairs to the small room set apart for their use.  This was another novel experience for the visitor. She insisted at first upon lying on the hard floor, for never in her life had she touched a bed; but after awhile, she became willing to share the couch with her playmate.  Alice knelt down by the side of the little trundle bed and said her prayers, as she always did; but Linna could not understand what it meant. She wonderingly watched her until she was through, and then with some misgiving, clambered among the clothes, and the mother tucked her up, though the night was so warm they needed little covering.  Mrs. Ripley felt that she ought to tell the dusky child about her heavenly Father, and to teach her to pray. She therefore sat down on the edge of the bed, and in simple words began the wonderful story of the Saviour, who gave His life to save her as well as all others.  Alice dropped asleep right away, but Linna lay motionless, with her round black eyes fixed on the face of the lady, drinking in every word she said. By and by, however, the eyelids began to droop, and the good woman ceased. Who shall tell what precious seed was thus sown in that cabin in Wyoming, more than a hundred years ago?  While Mrs. Ripley was talking upstairs, she heard voices below; so that she knew Ben had a visitor. As she descended, she recognized a neighbor who lived on the other side of the river.  \"I called,\" said he, \"to tell you that you must lose no time in moving into Forty Fort with your little girl.\"  \"You do not mean right away?\"  \"Not tonight, but the first thing in the morning.\"  \"Is the danger so close as that?\"  \"Our scouts report the Tory Colonel Butler with a large force of whites and Indians marching down the valley.\"  \"But do you not expect to repel them?\"  \"We are sure of that,\" was the confident reply; \"but it won't do for any of the women and children to be exposed. The Indians will scatter, and cut off all they can. Others of our friends are out warning the people, and we must have them all in a safe place.\"  \"Will you wait for your enemies to attack the fort?\"  \"I believe our Colonel Butler favors that; but others, and among them myself and Ben, favor marching out and meeting them.\"  \"That's it,\" added the lad, shaking his head. \"I believe in showing them we are not scared. Colonel Butler got leave of absence to come to Wyoming; he has some regulars with him, and with all our men and boys we'll teach the other Colonel Butler a lesson he won't forget as long as he lives.\"  \"Well, if you think it best, we will move into the fort with the other people until the danger is past.\"  \"Yes, mother; I will fight better knowing that you and Alice are safe. There's Linna! What about her?\"  \"Who's Linna?\" asked the visitor.  \"She is the little child of Omas, the Delaware warrior. He brought her here this afternoon to make Alice a visit, and promised to call tomorrow for her. Will it be safe to wait until he comes?\"  The neighbor shook his head.  \"You mustn't take any chances. Why don't you turn her loose to take care of herself? She can do it.\"  \"I couldn't,\" the mother hastened to say; \"Omas left her in our care, and I must not neglect her. She will go with us.\"  \"I don't think it will be safe for her father to come after her, when the flurry is over.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"He will be with the Iroquois, even though his tribe doesn't like them any too well; for the Iroquois are the"]]]
