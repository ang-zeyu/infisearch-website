As I grew, the thought of the master grew with me. In meditation I would often see his photographic image emerge from its small frame and, taking a living form, sit before me. When I attempted to touch the feet of his luminous body, it would change and again become the picture. As childhood slipped into boyhood, I found Lahiri Mahasaya transformed in my mind from a little image, cribbed in a frame, to a living, enlightening presence. I frequently prayed to him in moments of trial or confusion, finding within me his solacing direction. At first I grieved because he was no longer physically living. As I began to discover his secret omnipresence, I lamented no more. He had often written to those of his disciples who were over-anxious to see him: \"Why come to view my bones and flesh, when I am ever within range of your KUTASTHA (spiritual sight)?\"  I was blessed about the age of eight with a wonderful healing through the photograph of Lahiri Mahasaya. This experience gave intensification to my love. While at our family estate in Ichapur, Bengal, I was stricken with Asiatic cholera. My life was despaired of; the doctors could do nothing. At my bedside, Mother frantically motioned me to look at Lahiri Mahasaya's picture on the wall above my head.  \"Bow to him mentally!\" She knew I was too feeble even to lift my hands in salutation. \"If you really show your devotion and inwardly kneel before him, your life will be spared!\"  I gazed at his photograph and saw there a blinding light, enveloping my body and the entire room. My nausea and other uncontrollable symptoms disappeared; I was well. At once I felt strong enough to bend over and touch Mother's feet in appreciation of her immeasurable faith in her guru. Mother pressed her head repeatedly against the little picture.  \"O Omnipresent Master, I thank thee that thy light hath healed my son!\"  I realized that she too had witnessed the luminous blaze through which I had instantly recovered from a usually fatal disease.  One of my most precious possessions is that same photograph. Given to Father by Lahiri Mahasaya himself, it carries a holy vibration. The picture had a miraculous origin. I heard the story from Father's brother disciple, Kali Kumar Roy.  It appears that the master had an aversion to being photographed. Over his protest, a group picture was once taken of him and a cluster of devotees, including Kali Kumar Roy. It was an amazed photographer who discovered that the plate which had clear images of all the disciples, revealed nothing more than a blank space in the center where he had reasonably expected to find the outlines of Lahiri Mahasaya. The phenomenon was widely discussed.  A certain student and expert photographer, Ganga Dhar Babu, boasted that the fugitive figure would not escape him. The next morning, as the guru sat in lotus posture on a wooden bench with a screen behind him, Ganga Dhar Babu arrived with his equipment. Taking every precaution for success, he greedily exposed twelve plates. On each one he soon found the imprint of the wooden bench and screen, but once again the master's form was missing.  With tears and shattered pride, Ganga Dhar Babu sought out his guru.  It was many hours before Lahiri Mahasaya broke his silence with a pregnant comment:  \"I am Spirit. Can your camera reflect the omnipresent Invisible?\"  \"I see it cannot! But, Holy Sir, I lovingly desire a picture of the bodily temple where alone, to my narrow vision, that Spirit appears fully to dwell.\"  \"Come, then, tomorrow morning. I will pose for you.\"  Again the photographer focused his camera. This time the sacred figure, not cloaked with mysterious imperceptibility, was sharp on the plate. The master never posed for another picture; at least, I have seen none.  The photograph is reproduced in this book. Lahiri Mahasaya's fair features, of a universal cast, hardly suggest to what race he belonged. His intense joy of God-communion is slightly revealed in a somewhat enigmatic smile. His eyes, half open to denote a nominal direction on the outer world, are half closed also. Completely oblivious to the poor lures of the earth, he was fully awake at all times to the spiritual problems of seekers who approached for his bounty.  Shortly after my healing through the potency of the guru's picture, I had an influential spiritual vision. Sitting on my bed one morning, I fell into a deep reverie.  \"What is behind the darkness of closed eyes?\" This probing thought came powerfully into my mind. An immense flash of light at once manifested to my inward gaze. Divine shapes of saints, sitting in meditation posture in mountain caves, formed like miniature cinema pictures on the large screen of radiance within my forehead.  \"Who are you?\" I spoke aloud.  \"We are the Himalayan yogis.\" The celestial response is difficult to describe; my heart was thrilled.  \"Ah, I long to go to the Himalayas and become like you!\" The vision vanished, but the silvery beams expanded in ever-widening circles to infinity.  \"What is this wondrous glow?\"  \"I am Iswara.{FN1-11} I am Light.\" The voice was as murmuring clouds.  \"I want to be one with Thee!\"  Out of the slow dwindling of my divine ecstasy, I salvaged a permanent legacy of inspiration to seek God. \"He is eternal, ever-new Joy!\" This memory persisted long after the day of rapture.  Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated in the early morning under a NEEM tree in our Gorakhpur compound. She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.  \"Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?\"  \"Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear.\"  \"You little liar!\"  \"Sis, don't call me a liar until you see what happens in the morning.\" Indignation filled me.  Uma was unimpressed, and thrice repeated her taunt. An adamant resolution sounded in my voice as I made slow reply.  \"By the power of will in me, I say that tomorrow I shall have a fairly large boil in this exact place on my arm; and YOUR boil shall swell to twice its present size!\"  Morning found me with a stalwart boil on the indicated spot; the dimensions of Uma's boil had doubled. With a shriek, my sister rushed to Mother. \"Mukunda has become a necromancer!\" Gravely, Mother instructed me never to use the power of words for doing harm. I have always remembered her counsel, and followed it.  My boil was surgically treated. A noticeable scar, left by the doctor's incision, is present today. On my right forearm is a constant reminder of the power in man's sheer word.  Those simple and apparently harmless phrases to Uma, spoken with deep concentration, had possessed sufficient hidden force to explode like bombs and produce definite, though injurious, effects. I understood, later, that the explosive vibratory power in speech could be wisely directed to free one's life from difficulties, and thus operate without scar or rebuke. {FN1-12}  Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab. There I acquired a picture of the Divine Mother in the form of the Goddess Kali. {FN1-13} It sanctified a small informal shrine on the balcony of our home. An unequivocal conviction came over me that fulfillment would crown any of my prayers uttered in that sacred spot. Standing there with Uma one day, I watched two kites flying over the roofs of the buildings on the opposite side of the very narrow lane.  \"Why are you so quiet?\" Uma pushed me playfully.  \"I am just thinking how wonderful it is that Divine Mother gives me whatever I ask.\"  \"I suppose She would give you those two kites!\" My sister laughed derisively.  \"Why not?\" I began silent prayers for their possession.  Matches are played in India with kites whose strings are covered with glue and ground glass. Each player attempts to sever the string of his opponent. A freed kite sails over the roofs; there is great fun in catching it. Inasmuch as Uma and I were on the balcony, it seemed impossible that any loosed kite could come into our hands; its string would naturally dangle over the roofs.  The players across the lane began their match. One string was cut; immediately the kite floated in my direction. It was stationary for a moment, through sudden abatement of breeze, which sufficed to firmly entangle the string with a cactus plant on top of the opposite house.  A perfect loop was formed for my seizure. I handed the prize to Uma.  \"It was just an extraordinary accident, and not an answer to your prayer. If the other kite comes to you, then I shall believe.\" Sister's dark eyes conveyed more amazement than her words.  I continued my prayers with a crescendo intensity. A forcible tug by the other player resulted in the abrupt loss of his kite. It headed toward me, dancing in the wind. My helpful assistant, the cactus plant, again secured the kite string in the necessary loop by which I could grasp it. I presented my second trophy to Uma.  \"Indeed, Divine Mother listens to you! This is all too uncanny for me!\" Sister bolted away like a frightened fawn.  {FN1-2} Spiritual teacher; from Sanskrit root GUR, to raise, to uplift.  {FN1-3} A practitioner of yoga, \"union,\" ancient Indian science of meditation on God.  {FN1-4} My name was changed to Yogananda when I entered the ancient monastic Swami Order in 1914. My guru bestowed the religious title of PARAMHANSA on me in 1935 (see ../chapters 24 and 42).  {FN1-5} Traditionally, the second caste of warriors and rulers.  {FN1-6} These ancient epics are the hoard of India's history, mythology, and philosophy. An \"Everyman's Library\" volume, RAMAYANA AND MAHABHARATA, is a condensation in English verse by Romesh Dutt (New "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7452"],["title","Autobiography of a Yogi (#3)"],["body","York: E. P. Dutton).  {FN1-7} This noble Sanskrit poem, which occurs as part of the MAHABHARATA epic, is the Hindu Bible. The most poetical English translation is Edwin Arnold's THE SONG CELESTIAL (Philadelphia: David McKay, 75 cents). One of the best translations with detailed commentary is Sri Aurobindo's MESSAGE OF THE GITA (Jupiter Press, 16 Semudoss St., Madras, India, $3.50).  {FN1-8} BABU (Mister) is placed in Bengali names at the end.  {FN1-9} The phenomenal powers possessed by great masters are explained in chapter 30, \"The Law of Miracles.\"  {FN1-10} A yogic technique whereby the sensory tumult is stilled, permitting man to achieve an ever-increasing identity with cosmic consciousness. (See p. 243.)  {FN1-11} A Sanskrit name for God as Ruler of the universe; from the root IS, to rule. There are 108 names for God in the Hindu scriptures, each one carrying a different shade of philosophical meaning.  {FN1-12} The infinite potencies of sound derive from the Creative Word, AUM, the cosmic vibratory power behind all atomic energies. Any word spoken with clear realization and deep concentration has a materializing value. Loud or silent repetition of inspiring words has been found effective in Coueism and similar systems of psychotherapy; the secret lies in the stepping-up of the mind's vibratory rate. The poet Tennyson has left us, in his MEMOIRS, an account of his repetitious device for passing beyond the conscious mind into superconsciousness:  \"A kind of waking trance-this for lack of a better word-I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone,\" Tennyson wrote. \"This has come upon me through REPEATING my own name to myself silently, till all at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this not a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the surest, utterly beyond words-where death was an almost laughable impossibility-the loss of personality (if so it were) seeming no extinction, but the only true life.\" He wrote further: \"It is no nebulous ecstasy, but a state of transcendent wonder, associated with absolute clearness of mind.\"  {FN1-13} Kali is a symbol of God in the aspect of eternal Mother Nature.    CHAPTER: 2  MY MOTHER'S DEATH AND THE MYSTIC AMULET  My mother's greatest desire was the marriage of my elder brother. \"Ah, when I behold the face of Ananta's wife, I shall find heaven on this earth!\" I frequently heard Mother express in these words her strong Indian sentiment for family continuity.  I was about eleven years old at the time of Ananta's betrothal. Mother was in Calcutta, joyously supervising the wedding preparations. Father and I alone remained at our home in Bareilly in northern India, whence Father had been transferred after two years at Lahore.  I had previously witnessed the splendor of nuptial rites for my two elder sisters, Roma and Uma; but for Ananta, as the eldest son, plans were truly elaborate. Mother was welcoming numerous relatives, daily arriving in Calcutta from distant homes. She lodged them comfortably in a large, newly acquired house at 50 Amherst Street. Everything was in readiness-the banquet delicacies, the gay throne on which Brother was to be carried to the home of the bride-to-be, the rows of colorful lights, the mammoth cardboard elephants and camels, the English, Scottish and Indian orchestras, the professional entertainers, the priests for the ancient rituals.  Father and I, in gala spirits, were planning to join the family in time for the ceremony. Shortly before the great day, however, I had an ominous vision.  It was in Bareilly on a midnight. As I slept beside Father on the piazza of our bungalow, I was awakened by a peculiar flutter of the mosquito netting over the bed. The flimsy curtains parted and I saw the beloved form of my mother.  \"Awaken your father!\" Her voice was only a whisper. \"Take the first available train, at four o'clock this morning. Rush to Calcutta if you would see me!\" The wraithlike figure vanished.  \"Father, Father! Mother is dying!\" The terror in my tone aroused him instantly. I sobbed out the fatal tidings.  \"Never mind that hallucination of yours.\" Father gave his characteristic negation to a new situation. \"Your mother is in excellent health. If we get any bad news, we shall leave tomorrow.\"  \"You shall never forgive yourself for not starting now!\" Anguish caused me to add bitterly, \"Nor shall I ever forgive you!\"  The melancholy morning came with explicit words: \"Mother dangerously ill; marriage postponed; come at once.\"  Father and I left distractedly. One of my uncles met us en route at a transfer point. A train thundered toward us, looming with telescopic increase. From my inner tumult, an abrupt determination arose to hurl myself on the railroad tracks. Already bereft, I felt, of my mother, I could not endure a world suddenly barren to the bone. I loved Mother as my dearest friend on earth. Her solacing black eyes had been my surest refuge in the trifling tragedies of childhood.  \"Does she yet live?\" I stopped for one last question to my uncle.  \"Of course she is alive!\" He was not slow to interpret the desperation in my face. But I scarcely believed him.  When we reached our Calcutta home, it was only to confront the stunning mystery of death. I collapsed into an almost lifeless state.  Years passed before any reconciliation entered my heart. Storming the very gates of heaven, my cries at last summoned the Divine Mother. Her words brought final healing to my suppurating wounds:  \"It is I who have watched over thee, life after life, in the tenderness of many mothers! See in My gaze the two black eyes, the lost beautiful eyes, thou seekest!\"  Father and I returned to Bareilly soon after the crematory rites for the well-beloved. Early every morning I made a pathetic memorial--pilgrimage to a large SHEOLI tree which shaded the smooth, green-gold lawn before our bungalow. In poetical moments, I thought that the white SHEOLI flowers were strewing themselves with a willing devotion over the grassy altar. Mingling tears with the dew, I often observed a strange other-worldly light emerging from the dawn. Intense pangs of longing for God assailed me. I felt powerfully drawn to the Himalayas.  One of my cousins, fresh from a period of travel in the holy hills, visited us in Bareilly. I listened eagerly to his tales about the high mountain abode of yogis and swamis. {FN2-1}  \"Let us run away to the Himalayas.\" My suggestion one day to Dwarka Prasad, the young son of our landlord in Bareilly, fell on unsympathetic ears. He revealed my plan to my elder brother, who had just arrived to see Father. Instead of laughing lightly over this impractical scheme of a small boy, Ananta made it a definite point to ridicule me.  \"Where is your orange robe? You can't be a swami without that!\"  But I was inexplicably thrilled by his words. They brought a clear picture of myself roaming about India as a monk. Perhaps they awakened memories of a past life; in any case, I began to see with what natural ease I would wear the garb of that anciently-founded monastic order.  Chatting one morning with Dwarka, I felt a love for God descending with avalanchic force. My companion was only partly attentive to the ensuing eloquence, but I was wholeheartedly listening to myself.  I fled that afternoon toward Naini Tal in the Himalayan foothills. Ananta gave determined chase; I was forced to return sadly to Bareilly. The only pilgrimage permitted me was the customary one at dawn to the SHEOLI tree. My heart wept for the lost Mothers, human and divine.  The rent left in the family fabric by Mother's death was irreparable. Father never remarried during his nearly forty remaining years. Assuming the difficult role of Father-Mother to his little flock, he grew noticeably more tender, more approachable. With calmness and insight, he solved the various family problems. After office hours he retired like a hermit to the cell of his room, practicing KRIYA YOGA in a sweet serenity. Long after Mother's death, I attempted to engage an English nurse to attend to details that would make my parent's life more comfortable. But Father shook his head.  [Illustration: My Mother, A Disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya--see mother.jpg]  \"Service to me ended with your mother.\" His eyes were remote with a lifelong devotion. \"I will not accept ministrations from any other woman.\"  Fourteen months after Mother's passing, I learned that she had left me a momentous message. Ananta was present at her deathbed and had recorded her words. Although she had asked that the disclosure be made to me in one year, my brother delayed. He was soon to leave Bareilly for Calcutta, to marry the girl Mother had chosen for him. {FN2-2} One evening he summoned me to his side.  \"Mukunda, I have been reluctant to give you strange tidings.\" Ananta's tone held a note of resignation. \"My fear was to inflame your desire to leave home. But in any case you are bristling with divine ardor.  When I captured you recently on your way to the Himalayas, I came to a definite resolve. I must not further postpone the fulfillment of my solemn promise.\" My brother handed me a small box, and delivered Mother's message.  \"Let these words be my final blessing, my beloved son Mukunda!\" Mother had said. \"The hour is here when I must relate a number of phenomenal events following your birth. I first knew your destined path when you were but a babe in my arms. I carried you then to the home of my guru in Benares. Almost hidden behind a throng of disciples, I could barely see Lahiri Mahasaya as he sat in deep meditation.  \"While I patted you, I was praying that the great guru take notice and bestow a blessing. As my silent devotional demand grew in intensity, he opened his eyes and beckoned me to approach. The others made a way for me; I bowed at the sacred feet. My master seated you on his lap,"]]]
