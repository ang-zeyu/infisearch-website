The love for things ancient--creed, lineage, and name, is better steel against the stranger than your smiths ever welded.\"  Therewith, and not waiting for Sexwolf's reply, he clapped spurs to his palfrey, and soon entered the courtyard of the convent.  A monk of the order of St. Benedict, then most in favour [153], ushered the noble visitor into the cell of the abbot; who, after gazing at him a moment in wonder and delight, clasped him to his breast and kissed him heartily on brow and cheek.  \"Ah, Guillaume,\" he exclaimed in the Norman tongue, this is indeed a grace for which to sing Jubilate.  Thou canst not guess how welcome is the face of a countryman in this horrible land of ill-cooking and exile.\"  \"Talking of grace, my dear father, and food,\" said De Graville, loosening the cincture of the tight vest which gave him the shape of a wasp--for even at that early period, small waists were in vogue with the warlike fops of the French Continent--\"talking of grace, the sooner thou say'st it over some friendly refection, the more will the Latin sound unctuous and musical.  I have journeyed since daybreak, and am now hungered and faint.\"  \"Alack, alack!\" cried the abbot, plaintively, \"thou knowest little, my son, what hardships we endure in these parts, how larded our larders, and how nefarious our fare.  The flesh of swine salted--\"  \"The flesh of Beelzebub,\" cried Mallet de Graville, aghast. \"But comfort thee, I have stores on my sumpter-mules--poulardes and fishes, and other not despicable comestibles, and a few flasks of wine, not pressed, laud the saints! from the vines of this country: wherefore, wilt thou see to it, and instruct thy cooks how to season the cheer?\"  \"No cooks have I to trust to,\" replied the abbot; \"of cooking know they here as much as of Latin; nathless, I will go and do my best with the stew-pans.  Meanwhile, thou wilt at least have rest and the bath. For the Saxons, even in their convents, are a clean race, and learned the bath from the Dane.\"  \"That I have noted,\" said the knight, \"for even at the smallest house at which I lodged in my way from London, the host hath courteously offered me the bath, and the hostess linen curious and fragrant; and to say truth, the poor people are hospitable and kind, despite their uncouth hate of the foreigner; nor is their meat to be despised, plentiful and succulent; but pardex, as thou sayest, little helped by the art of dressing.  Wherefore, my father, I will while the time till the poulardes be roasted, and the fish broiled or stewed, by the ablutions thou profferest me.  I shall tarry with thee some hours, for I have much to learn.\"  The abbot then led the Sire de Graville by the hand to the cell of honour and guestship, and having seen that the bath prepared was of warmth sufficient, for both Norman and Saxon (hardy men as they seem to us from afar) so shuddered at the touch of cold water, that a bath of natural temperature (as well as a hard bed) was sometimes imposed as a penance,--the good father went his way, to examine the sumpter- mules, and admonish the much suffering and bewildered lay-brother who officiated as cook,--and who, speaking neither Norman nor Latin, scarce made out one word in ten of his superior's elaborate exhortations.  Mallet's squire, with a change of raiment, and goodly coffers of soaps, unguents, and odours, took his way to the knight, for a Norman of birth was accustomed to much personal attendance, and had all respect for the body; and it was nearly an hour before, in long gown of fur, reshaven, dainty, and decked, the Sire de Graville bowed, and sighed, and prayed before the refection set out in the abbot's cell.  The two Normans, despite the sharp appetite of the layman, ate with great gravity and decorum, drawing forth the morsels served to them on spits with silent examination; seldom more than tasting, with looks of patient dissatisfaction, each of the comestibles; sipping rather than drinking, nibbling rather than devouring, washing their fingers in rose water with nice care at the close, and waving them afterwards gracefully in the air, to allow the moisture somewhat to exhale before they wiped off the lingering dews with their napkins.  Then they exchanged looks and sighed in concert, as if recalling the polished manners of Normandy, still retained in that desolate exile.  And their temperate meal thus concluded, dishes, wines, and attendants vanished, and their talk commenced.  \"How camest thou in England?\" asked the abbot abruptly.  \"Sauf your reverence,\" answered De Graville, \"not wholly for reason different from those that bring thee hither.  When, after the death of that truculent and orgulous Godwin, King Edward entreated Harold to let him have back some of his dear Norman favourites, thou, then little pleased with the plain fare and sharp discipline of the convent of Bec, didst pray Bishop William of London to accompany such train as Harold, moved by his poor king's supplication, was pleased to permit. The bishop consented, and thou wert enabled to change monk's cowl for abbot's mitre.  In a word, ambition brought thee to England, and ambition brings me hither.\"  \"Hem! and how?  Mayst thou thrive better than I in this swine-sty!\"  \"You remember,\" renewed De Graville, \"that Lanfranc, the Lombard, was pleased to take interest in my fortunes, then not the most flourishing, and after his return from Rome, with the Pope's dispensation for Count William's marriage with his cousin, he became William's most trusted adviser.  Both William and Lanfranc were desirous to set an example of learning to our Latinless nobles, and therefore my scholarship found grace in their eyes.  In brief since then I have prospered and thriven.  I have fair lands by the Seine, free from clutch of merchant and Jew.  I have founded a convent, and slain some hundreds of Breton marauders.  Need I say that I am in high favour?  Now it so chanced that a cousin of mine, Hugo de Magnaville, a brave lance and franc-rider, chanced to murder his brother in a little domestic affray, and, being of conscience tender and nice, the deed preyed on him, and he gave his lands to Odo of Bayeux, and set off to Jerusalem.  There, having prayed at the tomb,\" (the knight crossed himself,) \"he felt at once miraculously cheered and relieved; but, journeying back, mishaps befell him.  He was made slave by some infidel, to one of whose wives he sought to be gallant, par amours, and only escaped at last by setting fire to paynim and prison.  Now, by the aid of the Virgin, he has got back to Rouen, and holds his own land again in fief from proud Odo, as a knight of the bishop's.  It so happened that, passing homeward through Lycia, before these misfortunes befell him, he made friends with a fellow-pilgrim who had just returned, like himself, from the Sepulchre, but not lightened, like him, of the load of his crime.  This poor palmer lay broken- hearted and dying in the hut of an eremite, where my cousin took shelter; and, learning that Hugo was on his way to Normandy, he made himself known as Sweyn, the once fair and proud Earl of England, eldest son to old Godwin, and father to Haco, whom our Count still holds as a hostage.  He besought Hugo to intercede with the Count for Haco's release and return, if King Edward assented thereto; and charged my cousin, moreover, with a letter to Harold, his brother, which Hugo undertook to send over.  By good luck, it so chanced that, through all his sore trials, cousin Hugo kept safe round his neck a leaden effigy of the Virgin.  The infidels disdained to rob him of lead, little dreaming the worth which the sanctity gave to the metal. To the back of the image Hugo fastened the letter, and so, though somewhat tattered and damaged, he had it still with him on arriving in Rouen.\"  \"Knowing, then, my grace with the Count, and not, despite absolution and pilgrimage, much wishing to trust himself in the presence of William, who thinks gravely of fratricide, he prayed me to deliver the message, and ask leave to send to England the letter.\"  \"It is a long tale,\" quoth the abbot.  \"Patience, my father!  I am nearly at the end.  Nothing more in season could chance for my fortunes.  Know that William has been long moody and anxious as to matters in England.  The secret accounts he receives from the Bishop of London make him see that Edward's heart is much alienated from him, especially since the Count has had daughters and sons; for, as thou knowest, William and Edward both took vows of chastity in youth [154], and William got absolved from his, while Edward hath kept firm to the plight.  Not long ere my cousin came back, William had heard that Edward had acknowledged his kinsman as natural heir to his throne.  Grieved and troubled at this, William had said in my hearing, 'Would that amidst yon statues of steel, there were some cool head and wise tongue I could trust with my interests in England! and would that I could devise fitting plea and excuse for an envoy to Harold the Earl!'  Much had I mused over these words, and a light-hearted man was Mallet de Graville when, with Sweyn's letter in hand, he went to Lanfranc the abbot and said, 'Patron and father! thou knowest that I, almost alone of the Norman knights, have studied the Saxon language.  And if the Duke wants messenger and plea, here stands the messenger, and in his hand is the plea.  Then I told my tale. Lanfranc went at once to Duke William.  By this time, news of the Atheling's death had arrived, and things looked more bright to my liege.  Duke William was pleased to summon me straightway, and give me his instructions.  So over the sea I came alone, save a single squire, reached London, learned the King and his court were at Winchester (but with them I had little to do),"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7677"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 06 (#7)"],["body"," that Harold the Earl was at the head of his forces in Wales against Gryffyth the Lion King.  The Earl had sent in haste for a picked and chosen band of his own retainers, on his demesnes near the city.  These I joined, and learning thy name at the monastery at Gloucester, I stopped here to tell thee my news and hear thine.\"  \"Dear brother,\" said the abbot, looking enviously on the knight, \"would that, like thee, instead of entering the Church, I had taken up arms!  Alike once was our lot, well born and penniless.  Ah me!--Thou art now as the swan on the river, and I as the shell on the rock.\"  \"But,\" quoth the knight, \"though the canons, it is true, forbid monks to knock people on the head, except in self-preservation, thou knowest well that, even in Normandy, (which, I take it, is the sacred college of all priestly lore, on this side the Alps,) those canons are deemed too rigorous for practice: and, at all events, it is not forbidden thee to look on the pastime with sword or mace by thy side in case of need.  Wherefore, remembering thee in times past, I little counted on finding thee--like a slug in thy cell!  No; but with mail on thy back, the canons clean forgotten, and helping stout Harold to sliver and brain these turbulent Welchmen.\"  \"Ah me! ah me!  No such good fortune!\" sighed the tall abbot. \"Little, despite thy former sojourn in London, and thy lore of their tongue, knowest thou of these unmannerly Saxons.  Rarely indeed do abbot and prelate ride to the battle [155]; and were it not for a huge Danish monk, who took refuge here to escape mutilation for robbery, and who mistakes the Virgin for a Valkyr, and St. Peter for Thor,-- were it not, I say, that we now and then have a bout at sword-play together, my arm would be quite out of practice.\"  \"Cheer thee, old friend,\" said the knight, pityingly, \"better times may come yet.  Meanwhile, now to affairs.  For all I hear strengthens all William has heard, that Harold the Earl is the first man in England.  Is it not so?\"  \"Truly, and without dispute.\"  \"Is he married, or celibate?  For that is a question which even his own men seem to answer equivocally.\"  \"Why, all the wandering minstrels have songs, I am told by those who comprehend this poor barbarous tongue, of the beauty of Editha pulchra, to whom it is said the Earl is betrothed, or it may be worse. But he is certainly not married, for the dame is akin to him within the degrees of the Church.\"  \"Hem, not married! that is well; and this Algar, or Elgar, he is not now with the Welch, I hear.\"  \"No; sore ill at Chester with wounds and much chafing, for he hath sense to see that his cause is lost.  The Norwegian fleet have been scattered over the seas by the Earl's ships, like birds in a storm. The rebel Saxons who joined Gryffyth under Algar have been so beaten, that those who survive have deserted their chief, and Gryffyth himself is penned up in his last defiles, and cannot much longer resist the stout foe, who, by valorous St. Michael, is truly a great captain.  As soon as Gryffyth is subdued, Algar will be crushed in his retreat, like a bloated spider in his web; and then England will have rest, unless our liege, as thou hintest, set her to work again.\"  The Norman knight mused a few moments, before he said:  \"I understand, then, that there is no man in the land who is peer to Harold:--not, I suppose, Tostig his brother?\"  \"Not Tostig, surely, whom nought but Harold's repute keeps a day in his earldom.  But of late--for he is brave and skilful in war--he hath done much to command the respect, though he cannot win back the love, of his fierce Northumbrians, for he hath holpen the Earl gallantly in this invasion of Wales, both by sea and by land.  But Tostig shines only from his brother's light; and if Gurth were more ambitious, Gurth alone could be Harold's rival.\"  The Norman, much satisfied with the information thus gleaned from the abbot, who, despite his ignorance of the Saxon tongue, was, like all his countrymen, acute and curious, now rose to depart.  The abbot, detaining him a few moments, and looking at him wistfully, said, in a low voice:  \"What thinkest thou are Count William's chances of England?\"  \"Good, if he have recourse to stratagem; sure, if he can win Harold.\"  \"Yet, take my word, the English love not the Normans, and will fight stiffly.\"  \"That I believe.  But if fighting must be, I see that it will be the fight of a single battle, for there is neither fortress nor mountain to admit of long warfare.  And look you, my friend, everything here is worn out!  The royal line is extinct with Edward, save in a child, whom I hear no man name as a successor; the old nobility are gone, there is no reverence for old names; the Church is as decrepit in the spirit as thy lath monastery is decayed in its timbers; the martial spirit of the Saxon is half rotted away in the subjugation to a clergy, not brave and learned, but timid and ignorant; the desire for money eats up all manhood; the people have been accustomed to foreign monarchs under the Danes; and William, once victor, would have but to promise to retain the old laws and liberties, to establish himself as firmly as Canute.  The Anglo-Danes might trouble him somewhat, but rebellion would become a weapon in the hands of a schemer like William.  He would bristle all the land with castles and forts, and hold it as a camp.  My poor friend, we shall live yet to exchange gratulations,--thou prelate of some fair English see, and I baron of broad English lands.\"  \"I think thou art right,\" said the tall abbot, cheerily, and marry, when the day comes, I will at least fight for the Duke.  Yea--thou art right,\" he continued, looking round the dilapidated walls of the cell; \"all here is worn out, and naught can restore the realm, save the Norman William, or----\"  \"Or who?\"  \"Or the Saxon Harold.  But thou goest to see him--judge for thyself.\"  \"I will do so, and heedfully,\" said the Sire de Graville; and embracing his friend he renewed his journey.     CHAPTER VII.   Messire Mallet de Graville possessed in perfection that cunning astuteness which characterised the Normans, as it did all the old pirate races of the Baltic; and if, O reader, thou, peradveuture, shouldst ever in this remote day have dealings with the tall men of Ebor or Yorkshire, there wilt thou yet find the old Dane-father's wit --it may be to thy cost--more especially if treating for those animals which the ancestors ate, and which the sons, without eating, still manage to fatten on.  But though the crafty knight did his best, during his progress from London into Wales, to extract from Sexwolf all such particulars respecting Harold and his brethren as he had reasons for wishing to learn, he found the stubborn sagacity or caution of the Saxon more than a match for him.  Sexwolf had a dog's instinct in all that related to his master; and he felt, though he scarce knew why, that the Norman cloaked some design upon Harold in all the cross- questionings so carelessly ventured.  And his stiff silence, or bluff replies, when Harold was mentioned, contrasted much the unreserve of his talk when it turned upon the general topics of the day, or the peculiarities of Saxon manners.  By degrees, therefore, the knight, chafed and foiled, drew into himself; and seeing no farther use could be made of the Saxon, suffered his own national scorn of villein companionship to replace his artificial urbanity.  He therefore rode alone, and a little in advance of the rest, noticing with a soldier's eye the characteristics of the country, and marvelling, while he rejoiced, at the insignificance of the defences which, even on the Marches, guarded the English country from the Cymrian ravager [156].  In musings of no very auspicious and friendly nature towards the land he thus visited, the Norman, on the second day from that in which he had conversed with the abbot, found himself amongst the savage defiles of North Wales.  Pausing there in a narrow pass overhung with wild and desolate rocks, the knight deliberately summoned his squires, clad himself in his ring mail, and mounted his great destrier.  \"Thou dost wrong, Norman,\" said Sexwolf, \"thou fatiguest thyself in vain--heavy arms here are needless.  I have fought in this country before: and as for thy steed, thou wilt soon have to forsake it, and march on foot.\"  \"Know, friend,\" retorted the knight, \"that I come not here to learn the horn-book of war; and for the rest, know also, that a noble of Normandy parts with his life ere he forsakes his good steed.\"  \"Ye outlanders and Frenchmen,\" said Sexwolf, showing the whole of his teeth through his forest of beard, \"love boast and big talk; and, on my troth, thou mayest have thy belly full of them yet; for we are still in the track of Harold, and Harold never leaves behind him a foe.  Thou art as safe here, as if singing psalms in a convent.\"  \"For thy jests, let them pass, courteous sir,\" said the Norman; \"but I pray thee only not to call me Frenchman [157].  I impute it to thy ignorance in things comely and martial, and not to thy design to insult me.  Though my own mother was French, learn that a Norman despises a Frank only less than he doth a Jew.\"  \"Crave your grace,\" said the Saxon, \"but I thought all ye outlanders were the same, rib and rib, sibbe and sibbe.\"  \"Thou wilt know better, one of these days.  March on, master Sexwolf.\"  The pass gradually opened on a wide patch of rugged and herbless waste; and Sexwolf, riding up to the knight, directed his attention to a stone, on which was inscribed the words, \"Hic victor fuit Haroldus,\"--Here Harold conquered.  \"In sight of a stone like that, no Walloon dare come,\" said the Saxon.  \"A simple and classical trophy,\" remarked the Norman, complacently, \"and saith much.  I am glad to see thy lord knows the Latin.\"  \"I say not that he knows Latin,\" replied the prudent Saxon; fearing that that could be no wholesome information on his lord's part, which was of a kind "]]]
