His vest, of a cramoisay so dark, that it seemed black beside the snowy garb of the Confessor, was edged by a deep band of embroidered gold; leaving perfectly bare his firm, full throat--firm and full as a column of granite,--a short jacket or manteline of fur, pendant from the shoulders, left developed in all its breadth a breast, that seemed meet to stay the march of an army; and on the left arm, curved to support the falcon, the vast muscles rose, round and gnarled, through the close sleeve.  In height, he was really but little above the stature of many of those present; nevertheless, so did his port [13], his air, the nobility of his large proportions, fill the eye, that he seemed to tower immeasurably above the rest.  His countenance was yet more remarkable than his form; still in the prime of youth, he seemed at the first glance younger, at the second older, than he was.  At the first glance younger; for his face was perfectly shaven, without even the moustache which the Saxon courtier, in imitating the Norman, still declined to surrender; and the smooth visage and bare throat sufficed in themselves to give the air of youth to that dominant and imperious presence.  His small skull-cap left unconcealed his forehead, shaded with short thick hair, uncurled, but black and glossy as the wings of a raven.  It was on that forehead that time had set its trace; it was knit into a frown over the eyebrows; lines deep as furrows crossed its broad, but not elevated expanse.  That frown spoke of hasty ire and the habit of stern command; those furrows spoke of deep thought and plotting scheme; the one betrayed but temper and circumstance; the other, more noble, spoke of the character and the intellect.  The face was square, and the regard lion-like; the mouth--small, and even beautiful in outline--had a sinister expression in its exceeding firmness; and the jaw--vast, solid, as if bound in iron--showed obstinate, ruthless, determined will; such a jaw as belongs to the tiger amongst beasts, and the conqueror amongst men; such as it is seen in the effigies of Caesar, of Cortes, of Napoleon.  That presence was well calculated to command the admiration of women, not less than the awe of men.  But no admiration mingled with the terror that seized the girl as she gazed long and wistful upon the knight.  The fascination of the serpent on the bird held her mute and frozen.  Never was that face forgotten; often in after-life it haunted her in the noon-day, it frowned upon her dreams.  \"Fair child,\" said the knight, fatigued at length by the obstinacy of the gaze, while that smile peculiar to those who have commanded men relaxed his brow, and restored the native beauty to his lip, \"fair child, learn not from thy peevish grandam so uncourteous a lesson as hate of the foreigner.  As thou growest into womanhood, know that Norman knight is sworn slave to lady fair;\" and, doffing his cap, he took from it an uncut jewel, set in Byzantine filigree work.  \"Hold out thy lap, my child; and when thou nearest the foreigner scoffed, set this bauble in thy locks, and think kindly of William, Count of the Normans.\" [14]  He dropped the jewel on the ground as he spoke; for Edith, shrinking and unsoftened towards him, held no lap to receive it; and Hilda, to whom Edward had been speaking in a low voice, advanced to the spot and struck the jewel with her staff under the hoofs of the king's palfrey.  \"Son of Emma, the Norman woman, who sent thy youth into exile, trample on the gifts of thy Norman kinsman.  And if, as men say, thou art of such gifted holiness that Heaven grants thy hand the power to heal, and thy voice the power to curse, heal thy country, and curse the stranger!\"  She extended her right arm to William as she spoke, and such was the dignity of her passion, and such its force, that an awe fell upon all. Then dropping her hood over her face, she slowly turned away, regained the summit of the knoll, and stood erect beside the altar of the Northern god, her face invisible through the hood drawn completely over it, and her form motionless as a statue.  \"Ride on,\" said Edward, crossing himself.  \"Now by the bones of St. Valery,\" said William, after a pause, in which his dark keen eye noted the gloom upon the King's gentle face, \"it moves much my simple wonder how even presence so saintly can hear without wrath words so unleal and foul.  Gramercy, an the proudest dame in Normandy (and I take her to be wife to my stoutest baron, William Fitzosborne) had spoken thus to me--\"  \"Thou wouldst have done as I, my brother,\" interrupted Edward; \"prayed to our Lord to pardon her, and rode on pitying.\"  William's lip quivered with ire, yet he curbed the reply that sprang to it, and he looked with affection genuinely more akin to admiration than scorn, upon his fellow-prince.  For, fierce and relentless as the Duke's deeds were, his faith was notably sincere; and while this made, indeed, the prince's chief attraction to the pious Edward, so, on the other hand, this bowed the Duke in a kind of involuntary and superstitious homage to the man who sought to square deeds to faith. It is ever the case with stern and stormy spirits, that the meek ones which contrast them steal strangely into their affections.  This principle of human nature can alone account for the enthusiastic devotion which the mild sufferings of the Saviour awoke in the fiercest exterminators of the North.  In proportion, often, to the warrior's ferocity, was his love to that Divine model, at whose sufferings he wept, to whose tomb he wandered barefoot, and whose example of compassionate forgiveness he would have thought himself the basest of men to follow!  \"Now, by my halidame, I honour and love thee, Edward,\" cried the Duke, with a heartiness more frank than was usual to him: \"and were I thy subject, woe to man or woman that wagged tongue to wound thee by a breath.  But who and what is this same Hilda? one of thy kith and kin?--surely not less than kingly blood runs so bold?\"  \"William, bien aime,\" [15] said the King, \"it is true that Hilda, whom the saints assoil, is of kingly blood, though not of our kingly line. It is feared,\" added Edward, in a timid whisper, as he cast a hurried glance around him, \"that this unhappy woman has ever been more addicted to the rites of her pagan ancestors than to those of Holy Church; and men do say that she hath thus acquired from fiend or charm secrets devoutly to be eschewed by the righteous.  Nathless, let us rather hope that her mind is somewhat distraught with her misfortunes.\"  The King sighed, and the Duke sighed too, but the Duke's sigh spoke impatience.  He swept behind him a stern and withering look towards the proud figure of Hilda, still seen through the glades, and said in a sinister voice: \"Of kingly blood; but this witch of Woden hath no sons or kinsmen, I trust, who pretend to the throne of the Saxon:\"  \"She is sibbe to Githa, wife of Godwin,\" answered the King, \"and that is her most perilous connection; for the banished Earl, as thou knowest, did not pretend to fill the throne, but he was content with nought less than governing our people.\"  The King then proceeded to sketch an outline of the history of Hilda, but his narrative was so deformed both by his superstitions and prejudices, and his imperfect information in all the leading events and characters in his own kingdom, that we will venture to take upon ourselves his task; and while the train ride on through glade and mead, we will briefly narrate, from our own special sources of knowledge, the chronicle of Hilda, the Scandinavian Vala.     CHAPTER II.   A magnificent race of men were those war sons of the old North, whom our popular histories, so superficial in their accounts of this age, include in the common name of the \"Danes.\"  They replunged into barbarism the nations over which they swept; but from that barbarism they reproduced the noblest elements of civilisation.  Swede, Norwegian, and Dane, differing in some minor points, when closely examined, had yet one common character viewed at a distance.  They had the same prodigious energy, the same passion for freedom, individual and civil, the same splendid errors in the thirst for fame and the \"point of honour;\" and above all, as a main cause of civilisation, they were wonderfully pliant and malleable in their admixtures with the peoples they overran.  This is their true distinction from the stubborn Celt, who refuses to mingle, and disdains to improve.  Frankes, the archbishop, baptised Rolf-ganger [16]: and within a little more than a century afterwards, the descendants of those terrible heathens who had spared neither priest nor altar, were the most redoubtable defenders of the Christian Church; their old language forgotten (save by a few in the town of Bayeux), their ancestral names [17] (save among a few of the noblest) changed into French titles, and little else but the indomitable valour of the Scandinavian remained unaltered amongst the arts and manners of the Frankish-Norman.  In like manner their kindred tribes, who had poured into Saxon England to ravage and lay desolate, had no sooner obtained from Alfred the Great permanent homes, than they became perhaps the most powerful, and in a short time not the least patriotic, part of the Anglo-Saxon population [18].  At the time our story opens, these Northmen, under the common name of Danes, were peaceably settled in no less than fifteen [19] counties in England; their nobles abounded in towns and cities beyond the boundaries of those counties which bore the distinct appellation of Danelagh."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7672"],["title","Harold : the Last of the Saxon Kings â€” Volume 01 (#6)"],["body","were numerous in London: in the precincts of which they had their own burial-place, to the chief municipal court of which they gave their own appellation--the Hustings [20]. Their power in the national assembly of the Witan had decided the choice of kings.  Thus, with some differences of law and dialect, these once turbulent invaders had amalgamated amicably with the native race [21].  And to this day, the gentry, traders, and farmers of more than one-third of England, and in those counties most confessed to be in the van of improvement, descend from Saxon mothers indeed, but from Viking fathers.  There was in reality little difference in race between the Norman knight of the time of Henry I. and the Saxon franklin of Norfolk and York.  Both on the mother's side would most probably have been Saxon, both on the father's would have traced to the Scandinavian.  But though this character of adaptability was general, exceptions in some points were necessarily found, and these were obstinate in proportion to the adherence to the old pagan faith, or the sincere conversion to Christianity.  The Norwegian chronicles, and passages in our own history, show how false and hollow was the assumed Christianity of many of these fierce Odin-worshippers.  They willingly enough accepted the outward sign of baptism, but the holy water changed little of the inner man.  Even Harold, the son of Canute, scarce seventeen years before the date we have now entered, being unable to obtain from the Archbishop of Canterbury--who had espoused the cause of his brother Hardicanute--the consecrating benediction, lived and reigned as one who had abjured Christianity. [22]  The priests, especially on the Scandinavian continent, were often forced to compound with their grim converts, by indulgence to certain habits, such as indiscriminate polygamy.  To eat horse-flesh in honour of Odin, and to marry wives ad libitum, were the main stipulations of the neophytes.  And the puzzled monks, often driven to a choice, yielded the point of the wives, but stood firm on the graver article of the horse-flesh.  With their new religion, very imperfectly understood, even when genuinely received, they retained all that host of heathen superstition which knits itself with the most obstinate instincts in the human breast.  Not many years before the reign of the Confessor, the laws of the great Canute against witchcraft and charms, the worship of stones, fountains, runes by ash and elm, and the incantations that do homage to the dead, were obviously rather intended to apply to the recent Danish converts, than to the Anglo- Saxons, already subjugated for centuries, body and soul, to the domination of the Christian monks.  Hilda, a daughter of the royalty of Denmark, and cousin to Githa (niece to Canute, whom that king had bestowed in second spousals upon Godwin), had come over to England with a fierce Jarl, her husband, a year after Canute's accession to the throne--both converted nominally, both secret believers in Thor and Odin.  Hilda's husband had fallen in one of the actions in the Northern seas, between Canute and St. Olave, King of Norway (that saint himself, by the bye, a most ruthless persecutor of his forefathers' faith, and a most unqualified assertor of his heathen privilege to extend his domestic affections beyond the severe pale which should have confined them to a single wife.  His natural son Magnus then sat on the Danish throne).  The Jarl died as he had wished to die, the last man on board his ship, with the soothing conviction that the Valkyrs would bear him to Valhalla.  Hilda was left with an only daughter, whom Canute bestowed on Ethelwolf, a Saxon Earl of large domains, and tracing his descent from Penda, that old King of Mercia who refused to be converted, but said so discreetly, that he had no objection to his neighbours being Christians, if they would practise that peace and forgiveness which the monks told him were the elements of the faith.  Ethelwolf fell under the displeasure of Hardicanute, perhaps because he was more Saxon than Danish; and though that savage king did not dare openly to arraign him before the Witan, he gave secret orders by which he was butchered on his own hearthstone, in the arms of his wife, who died shortly afterwards of grief and terror.  The only orphan of this unhappy pair, Edith, was thus consigned to the charge of Hilda.  It was a necessary and invaluable characteristic of that \"adaptability\" which distinguished the Danes, that they transferred to the land in which they settled all the love they had borne to that of their ancestors; and so far as attachment to soil was concerned, Hilda had grown no less in heart an Englishwoman than if she had been born and reared amidst the glades and knolls from which the smoke of her hearth rose through the old Roman compluvium.  But in all else she was a Dane.  Dane in her creed and her habits-- Dane in her intense and brooding imagination--in the poetry that filled her soul, peopled the air with spectres, and covered the leaves of the trees with charms.  Living in austere seclusion after the death of her lord, to whom she had borne a Scandinavian woman's devoted but heroic love,--sorrowing, indeed, for his death, but rejoicing that he fell amidst the feast of ravens,--her mind settled more and more year by year, and day by day, upon those visions of the unknown world, which in every faith conjure up the companions of solitude and grief.  Witchcraft in the Scandinavian North assumed many forms, and was connected by many degrees.  There was the old and withered hag, on whom, in our later mediaeval ages the character was mainly bestowed; there was the terrific witch-wife, or wolf-witch, who seems wholly apart from human birth and attributes, like the weird sisters of Macbeth--creatures who entered the house at night and seized warriors to devour them, who might be seen gliding over the sea, with the carcase of the wolf dripping blood from their giant jaws; and there was the more serene, classical, and awful vala, or sibyl, who, honoured by chiefs and revered by nations, foretold the future, and advised the deeds of heroes.  Of these last, the Norse chronicles tell us much.  They were often of rank and wealth, they were accompanied by trains of handmaids and servants--kings led them (when their counsel was sought) to the place of honour in the hall, and their heads were sacred, as those of ministers to the gods.  This last state in the grisly realm of the Wig-laer (wizard-lore) was the one naturally appertaining to the high rank, and the soul, lofty though blind and perverted, of the daughter of warrior-kings.  All practice of the art to which now for long years she had devoted herself, that touched upon the humble destinies of the vulgar, the child of Odin [23] haughtily disdained.  Her reveries were upon the fate of kings and kingdoms; she aspired to save or to rear the dynasties which should rule the races yet unborn.  In youth proud and ambitious,--common faults with her countrywomen,--on her entrance into the darker world, she carried with her the prejudices and passions that she had known in that coloured by the external sun.  All her human affections were centred in her grandchild Edith, the last of a race royal on either side.  Her researches into the future had assured her, that the life and death of this fair child were entwined with the fates of a king, and the same oracles had intimated a mysterious and inseparable connection between her own shattered house and the flourishing one of Earl Godwin, the spouse of her kinswoman Githa: so that with this great family she was as intimately bound by the links of superstition as by the ties of blood.  The eldest born of Godwin, Sweyn, had been at first especially her care and her favourite; and he, of more poetic temperament than his brothers, had willingly submitted to her influence.  But of all the brethren, as will be seen hereafter, the career of Sweyn had been most noxious and ill-omened; and at that moment, while the rest of the house carried with it into exile the deep and indignant sympathy of England, no man said of Sweyn, \"God bless him!\"  But as the second son, Harold, had grown from childhood into youth, Hilda had singled him out with a preference even more marked than that she had bestowed upon Sweyn.  The stars and the runes assured her of his future greatness, and the qualities and talents of the young Earl had, at the very onset of his career, confirmed the accuracy of their predictions.  Her interest in Harold became the more intense, partly because whenever she consulted the future for the lot of her grandchild Edith, she invariably found it associated with the fate of Harold--partly because all her arts had failed to penetrate beyond a certain point in their joint destinies, and left her mind agitated and perplexed between hope and terror.  As yet, however, she had wholly failed in gaining any ascendancy over the young Earl's vigorous and healthful mind: and though, before his exile, he came more often than any of Godwin's sons to the old Roman house, he had smiled with proud incredulity at her vague prophecies, and rejected all her offers of aid from invisible agencies with the calm reply--\"The brave man wants no charms to encourage him to his duty, and the good man scorns all warnings that would deter him from fulfilling it.\"  Indeed, though Hilda's magic was not of the malevolent kind, and sought the source of its oracles not in fiends but gods, (at least the gods in whom she believed,) it was noticeable that all over whom her influence had prevailed had come to miserable and untimely ends;--not alone her husband and her son-in-law, (both of whom had been as wax to her counsel,) but such other chiefs as rank or ambition permitted to appeal to her lore.  Nevertheless, such was the ascendancy she had gained over the popular mind, that it would have been dangerous in the highest degree to put into"]]]
