He certainly has in him very little of the great man; nor do I know anywhere so striking an instance of this truth,--that in that game of honours which is played at courts, we obtain success less by our talents than our tempers.  He laughed, with a graceful turn of /badinage/, at the political peculiarities of Madame de Balzac; and said that it was not for the uppermost party to feel resentment at the chafings of the under one. Sliding from this topic, he then questioned me as to the gayeties I had witnessed.  I gave him a description of the party at Boulainvilliers'. He seemed much interested in this, and showed more shrewdness than I should have given him credit for in discussing the various characters of the /literati/ of the day.  After some general conversation on works of fiction, he artfully glided into treating on those of statistics and politics, and I then caught a sudden but thorough insight into the depths of his policy.  I saw that, while he affected to be indifferent to the difficulties and puzzles of state, he lost no opportunity of gaining every particle of information respecting them; and that he made conversation, in which he was skilled, a vehicle for acquiring that knowledge which he had not the force of mind to create from his own intellect, or to work out from the written labours of others.  If this made him a superficial statesman, it made him a prompt one; and there was never so lucky a minister with so little trouble to himself.*   * At his death appeared the following pnnning epigram:--            \"/Floruit/ sine fructu;            /Defloruit/ sine luctu.\"  \"He flowered without fruit, and faded without regret.\"--ED.   As we approached the end of our destination, we talked of the King.  On this subject he was jealously cautious.  But I gleaned from him, despite of his sagacity, that it was high time to make all use of one's acquaintance with Madame de Maintenon that one could be enabled to do; and that it was so difficult to guess the exact places in which power would rest after the death of the old King that supineness and silence made at present the most profound policy.  As we alighted from the carriage and I first set my foot within the palace, I could not but feel involuntarily yet powerfully impressed with the sense of the spirit of the place.  I was in the precincts of that mighty court which had gathered into one dazzling focus all the rays of genius which half a century had emitted,--the court at which time had passed at once from the morn of civilization into its full noon and glory,--the court of Conde and Turenne, of Villars and of Tourville,--the court where, over the wit of Grammont, the profusion of Fouquet, the fatal genius of Louvois (fatal to humanity and to France), Love, real Love, had not disdained to shed its pathos and its truth, and to consecrate the hollow pageantries of royal pomp, with the tenderness, the beauty, and the repentance of La Valliere.  Still over that scene hung the spells of a genius which, if artificial and cold, was also vast, stately, and magnificent,--a genius which had swelled in the rich music of Racine, which had raised the nobler spirit and the freer thought of Pierre Corneille,* which had given edge to the polished weapon of Boileau, which had lavished over the bright page of Moliere,--Moliere, more wonderful than all--a knowledge of the humours and the hearts of men, which no dramatist, save Shakspeare, has surpassed.  Within those walls still glowed, though now waxing faint and dim, the fame of that monarch who had enjoyed, at least till his later day, the fortune of Augustus unsullied by the crimes of Octavius.  Nine times, since the sun of that monarch rose, had the Papal Chair received a new occupant!  Six sovereigns had reigned over the Ottoman hordes! The fourth emperor since the birth of the same era bore sway over Germany!  Five czars, from Michael Romanoff to the Great Peter, had held, over their enormous territory, the precarious tenure of their iron power!  Six kings had borne the painful cincture of the English crown;** two of those kings had been fugitives to that court; to the son of the last it was an asylum at that moment.   * Rigidly speaking, Corneille belongs to a period later than that of Louis XIV., though he has been included in the era formed by that reign.--ED.   ** Besides Cromwell; namely, Charles I., Charles II., James II., William and Mary, Anne, George I.   What wonderful changes had passed over the face of Europe during that single reign!  In England only, what a vast leap in the waste of events, from the reign of the first Charles to that of George the First!  I still lingered, I still gazed, as these thoughts, linked to one another in an electric chain, flashed over me!  I still paused on the threshold of those stately halls which Nature herself had been conquered to rear! Where, through the whole earth, could I find so meet a symbol for the character and the name which that sovereign would leave to posterity as this palace itself afforded?  A gorgeous monument of regal state raised from a desert; crowded alike with empty pageantries and illustrious names; a prodigy of elaborate artifice, grand in its whole effect, petty in its small details; a solitary oblation to a splendid selfishness, and most remarkable for the revenues which it exhausted and the poverty by which it is surrounded!  Fleuri, with his usual urbanity--an urbanity that, on a great scale, would have been benevolence--had hitherto indulged me in my emotions: he now laid his hand upon my arm, and recalled me to myself.  Before I could apologize for my abstraction, the Bishop was accosted by an old man of evident rank, but of a countenance more strikingly demonstrative of the little cares of a mere courtier than any I ever beheld.  \"What news, Monsieur le Marquis?\" said Fleuri, smiling.  \"Oh! the greatest imaginable! the King talks of receiving the Danish minister on /Thursday/, which, you know, is his day of /domestic business/!  What /can/ this portend?  Besides,\" and here the speaker's voice lowered into a whisper, \"I am told by the Duc de la Rochefoucauld that the king intends, out of all ordinary rule and practice, to take physic to-morrow: I can't believe it; no, I positively can't; but don't let this go further!\"  \"Heaven forbid!\" answered Fleuri, bowing, and the courtier passed on to whisper his intelligence to others.  \"Who's that gentleman?\" I asked.  \"The Marquis de Dangeau,\" answered Fleuri; \"a nobleman of great quality, who keeps a diary of all the king says and does.  It will perhaps be a posthumous publication, and will show the world of what importance nothings can be made.  I dare say, Count, you have already, in England, seen enough of a court to know that there are some people who are as human echoes, and have no existence except in the noise occasioned by another.\"  I took care that my answer should not be a witticism, lest Fleuri should think I was attempting to rival him; and so we passed on in an excellent humour with each other.  We mounted the grand staircase, and came to an ante-chamber, which, though costly and rich, was not remarkably conspicuous for splendour. Here the Bishop requested me to wait for a moment.  Accordingly, I amused myself with looking over some engravings of different saints. Meanwhile, my companion passed through another door, and I was alone.  After an absence of nearly ten minutes, he returned.  \"Madame de Maintenon,\" said he in a whisper, \"is but poorly to-day.  However, she has eagerly consented to see you; follow me!\"  So saying, the ecclesiastical courtier passed on, with myself at his heels.  We came to the door of a second chamber, at which Fleuri /scraped/ gently.  We were admitted, and found therein three ladies, one of whom was reading, a second laughing, and a third yawning, and entered into another chamber, where, alone and seated by the window in a large chair, with one foot on a stool, in an attitude that rather reminded me of my mother, and which seems to me a favourite position with all devotees, we found an old woman without /rouge/, plainly dressed, with spectacles on her nose and a large book on a little table before her. With a most profound salutation, Frejus approached, and taking me by the hand, said,--  \"Will Madame suffer me to present to her the Count Devereux?\"  Madame de Maintenon, with an air of great meekness and humility, bowed a return to the salutation.  \"The son of Madame la Marechale de Devereux will always be most welcome to me!\"  Then, turning towards us, she pointed to two stools, and, while we were seating ourselves, said,--  \"And how did you leave my excellent friend?\"  \"When, Madame, I last saw my mother, which is now nearly a year ago, she was in health, and consoling herself for the advance of years by that tendency to wean the thoughts from this world which (in her own language) is the divinest comfort of old age!\"  \"Admirable woman!\" said Madame de Maintenon, casting down her eyes; \"such are indeed the sentiments in which I recognize the Marechale.  And how does her beauty wear?  Those golden locks, and blue eyes, and that snowy skin, are not yet, I suppose, wholly changed for an adequate compensation of the beauties within?\"  \"Time, Madame, has been gentle with her; and I have often thought, though never perhaps more strongly than at this moment, that there is in those divine studies, which bring calm and light to the mind, something which preserves and embalms, as it were, the beauty of the body.\"  A faint blush passed over the face of the devotee.  No, no,--not even at eighty years of age is a compliment to a woman's beauty misplaced! There was a slight pause.  I thought that respect forbade me to break it.  \"His Majesty,\" said the Bishop, in the tone of one who is sensible that he encroaches a little, and does it with consequent"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7628"],["title","Devereux — Volume 05 (#0)"],["body","eBook was produced by Dagny,                and David Widger,      BOOK V.    CHAPTER I.  A PORTRAIT.  MYSTERIOUS impulse at the heart, which never suffers us to be at rest, which urges us onward as by an unseen yet irresistible law--human planets in a petty orbit, hurried forever and forever, till our course is run and our light is quenched--through the circle of a dark and impenetrable destiny! art thou not some faint forecast and type of our wanderings hereafter; of the unslumbering nature of the soul; of the everlasting progress which we are predoomed to make through the countless steps and realms and harmonies in the infinite creation?  Oh, often in my rovings have I dared to dream so,--often have I soared on the wild wings of thought above the \"smoke and stir\" of this dim earth, and wrought, from the restless visions of my mind, a chart of the glories and the wonders which the released spirit may hereafter visit and behold!  What a glad awakening from self,--what a sparkling and fresh draught from a new source of being,--what a wheel within wheel, animating, impelling, arousing all the rest of this animal machine, is the first excitement of Travel! the first free escape from the bonds of the linked and tame life of cities and social vices,--the jaded pleasure and the hollow love, the monotonous round of sordid objects and dull desires,--the eternal chain that binds us to things and beings, mockeries of ourselves,--alike, but oh, how different! the shock that brings us nearer to men only to make us strive against them, and learn, from the harsh contest of veiled deceit and open force, that the more we share the aims of others, the more deeply and basely rooted we grow to the littleness of self!  I passed more lingeringly through France than I did through the other portions of my route.  I had dwelt long enough in the capital to be anxious to survey the country.  It was then that the last scale which the magic of Louis Quatorze and the memory of his gorgeous court had left upon the mortal eye fell off, and I saw the real essence of that monarch's greatness and the true relics of his reign.  I saw the poor, and the degraded, and the racked, and the priest-ridden, tillers and peoplers of the soil, which made the substance beneath the glittering and false surface,--the body of that vast empire, of which I had hitherto beheld only the face, and THAT darkly, and for the most part covered by a mask!  No man can look upon France, beautiful France,--her rich soil, her temperate yet maturing clime, the gallant and bold spirits which she produces, her boundaries so indicated and protected by Nature itself, her advantages of ocean and land, of commerce and agriculture,--and not wonder that her prosperity should be so bloated, and her real state so wretched and diseased.  Let England draw the moral, and beware not only of wars which exhaust, but of governments which impoverish.  A waste of the public wealth is the most lasting of public afflictions; and \"the treasury which is drained by extravagance must be refilled by crime.\"*   * Tacitus.   I remember one beautiful evening an accident to my carriage occasioned my sojourn for a whole afternoon in a small village.  The Cure honoured me with a visit; and we strolled, after a slight repast, into the hamlet.  The priest was complaisant, quiet in manner, and not ill informed for his obscure station and scanty opportunities of knowledge; he did not seem, however, to possess the vivacity of his countrymen, but was rather melancholy and pensive, not only in his expression of countenance, but his cast of thought.  \"You have a charming scene here: I almost feel as if it were a sin to leave it so soon.\"  We were, indeed, in a pleasant and alluring spot at the time I addressed this observation to the good Cure.  A little rivulet emerged from the copse to the left, and ran sparkling and dimpling beneath our feet, to deck with a more living verdure the village green, which it intersected with a winding nor unmelodious stream.  We had paused, and I was leaning against an old and solitary chestnut-tree, which commanded the whole scene.  The village was a little in the rear, and the smoke from its few chimneys rose slowly to the silent and deep skies, not wholly unlike the human wishes, which, though they spring from the grossness and the fumes of earth, purify themselves as they ascend to heaven.  And from the village (when other sounds, which I shall note presently, were for an instant still) came the whoop of children, mellowed by distance into a confused yet thrilling sound, which fell upon the heart like the voice of our gone childhood itself.  Before, in the far expanse, stretched a chain of hills on which the autumn sun sank slowly, pouring its yellow beams over groups of peasantry, which, on the opposite side of the rivulet and at some interval from us, were scattered, partly over the green, and partly gathered beneath the shade of a little grove.  The former were of the young, and those to whom youth's sports are dear, and were dancing to the merry music, which (ever and anon blended with the laugh and the tone of a louder jest) floated joyously on our ears.  The fathers and matrons of the hamlet were inhaling a more quiet joy beneath the trees, and I involuntarily gave a tenderer interest to their converse by supposing them to sanction to each other the rustic loves which they might survey among their children.  \"Will not Monsieur draw nearer to the dancers?\" said the Cure; \"there is a plank thrown over the rivulet a little lower down.\"  \"No!\" said I, \"perhaps they are seen to better advantage where we are: what mirth will bear too close an inspection?\"  True, Sir,\" remarked the priest, and he sighed.  \"Yet,\" I resumed musingly, and I spoke rather to myself than to my companion, \"yet, how happy do they seem! what a revival of our Arcadian dreams are the flute and the dance, the glossy trees all glowing in the autumn sunset, the green sod, and the murmuring rill, and the buoyant laugh, startling the satyr in his leafy haunts; and the rural loves which will grow sweeter still when the sun has set, and the twilight has made the sigh more tender and the blush of a mellower hue!  Ah, why is it only the revival of a dream? why must it be only an interval of labour and woe, the brief saturnalia of slaves, the green resting-spot in a dreary and long road of travail and toil?\"  \"You are the first stranger I have met,\" said the Cure, \"who seems to pierce beneath the thin veil of our Gallic gayety; the first to whom the scene we now survey is fraught with other feelings than a belief in the happiness of our peasantry, and an envy at its imagined exuberance.  But as it is not the happiest individuals, so I fear it is not the happiest nations, that are the gayest.\"  I looked at the Cure with some surprise.  \"Your remark is deeper than the ordinary wisdom of your tribe, my Father,\" said I.  \"I have travelled over three parts of the globe,\" answered the Cure: \"I was not always intended for what I am;\" and the priest's mild eyes flashed with a sudden light that as suddenly died away.  \"Yes, I have travelled over the greater part of the known world,\" he repeated, in a more quiet tone; \"and I have noted that where a man has many comforts to guard, and many rights to defend, he necessarily shares the thought and the seriousness of those who feel the value of a treasure which they possess, and whose most earnest meditations are intent upon providing against its loss.  I have noted, too, that the joy produced by a momentary suspense of labour is naturally great in proportion to the toil; hence it is that no European mirth is so wild as that of the Indian slave, when a brief holiday releases him from his task.  Alas! that very mirth is the strongest evidence of the weight of the previous chains; even as, in ourselves, we find the happiest moment we enjoy is that immediately succeeding the cessation of deep sorrow to the mind or violent torture to the body.\"*   * This reflection, if true, may console us for the loss of those village dances and pleasant holidays for which \"merry England\" was once celebrated.  The loss of them has been ascribed to the gloomy influence of the Puritans; but it has never occurred to the good poets, who have so mourned over that loss, that it is also to be ascribed to the /liberty/ which those Puritans /generalized/, if they did not introduce.--ED.   I was struck by this observation of the priest.  \"I see now,\" said I, \"that as an Englishman I have no reason to repine at the proverbial gravity of my countrymen, or to envy the lighter spirit of the sons of Italy and France.\"  \"No,\" said the Cure; \"the happiest nations are those in whose people you witness the least sensible reverses from gayety to dejection; and that /thought/, which is the noblest characteristic of the isolated man, is also that of a people.  Freemen are serious; they have objects at their heart worthy to engross attention.  It is reserved for slaves to indulge in groans at one moment and laughter at another.\"  \"At that rate,\" said I, \"the best sign for France will be when the gayety of her sons is no longer a just proverb, and the laughing lip is succeeded by the thoughtful brow.\"  We remained silent for several minutes; our conversation had shed a gloom over the light scene before us, and the voice of the flute no longer sounded musically on my ear.  I proposed to the Cure to return to my inn.  As we walked slowly in that direction, I surveyed my companion more attentively than I had hitherto done.  He was a model of masculine vigour and grace of form; and, had I not looked earnestly upon his cheek, I should have thought him likely to outlive the very oaks around the hamlet church where he presided.  But the cheek was worn and hectic, and seemed to indicate that the keen fire which burns at the deep heart, unseen, but unslaking, would consume the mortal fuel, long before Time should even have"]]]
