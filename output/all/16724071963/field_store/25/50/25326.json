Polly didn't speak, only half hearing the words, her heart on the rest of the party, every instant being carried further from her.  \"And you must have seen--'pon me word it is impossible that you didn't see that--that\"--  \"Oh, dear,\" burst out Polly suddenly, and peering anxiously down the white winding highway. \"If there should be a drift on the road!\"  Livingston Bayley bit his lip angrily. \"'Pon me word, Miss Mary,\" he began, \"you are the first girl I ever cared to speak to, and now you can't think of anything but the roads.\"  Still Polly peered into the unbroken whiteness of the thoroughfare, lined by the snow-laden pines and spruces, all inextricably mixed as the sleigh spun by. It was too late to turn back now, she knew; the best that could be done, was to hurry on--and she began to count the hoof-beats and to speculate how long it would be before they would see the lights of the little station, and find the lost party again.  \"I might have spoken to a great many other girls,\" Livingston Bayley was saying, \"and I really don't know why I didn't choose one of them. Another man in my place would, and you must do me the justice to acknowledge it; 'pon me word, you must, Miss Mary.\"  Polly tore off her gaze from the snowy fields where the branches of the trees were making little zigzag paths in the moonlight, to fasten it on as much of his face as was visible between his cap and his high collar.  \"And I really shouldn't think you would play with me,\" declared Mr. Bayley, nervously fingering the whip-handle, \"I shouldn't, don't you know, because you are not the sort of girl to do that thing. 'Pon me word, you're not, Miss Mary.\"  \"I? what do you mean?\" cried poor Polly, growing more and more bewildered.  \"Why I--I--of course you must know; 'pon me word, you must, Miss Mary, for it began five years ago, before you went abroad, don't you know?\"  Polly sank back among her fur robes while he went on.  \"And I've done what no other fellow would, I'm sure,\" he said incoherently, \"in my place, kept constant, don't you know, to one idea. Been with other girls, of course, but only really made up my mind to marry you. 'Pon me word, I didn't, Miss Mary.\"  \"And you've brought me out, away from the rest of the party, to tell me this,\" exclaimed Polly, springing forward to sit erect with flashing eyes. \"How good of you, Mr. Bayley, to announce your intention to marry me.\"  \"You can't blame me,\" cried Mr. Bayley in an injured way. \"That cad of a Loughead means to speak soon--'pon me word, the fellow does. And I've never changed my mind about it since I made it up, even when you began to give music lessons.\"  \"Oh, how extremely kind,\" cried Polly.  \"Don't put it that way,\" he began deprecatingly. \"I couldn't help it, don't you know, for I liked you awfully from the first, and always intended to marry you. You shall have everything in the world that you want, and go everywhere. And my family, you know, has an _entree_ to any society that's worth anything.\"  \"I wouldn't marry you,\" cried Polly stormily, \"if you could give me all the gold in the world; and as for family,\" here she sat quite erect with shining eyes, \"the Peppers have always been the loveliest people that ever lived--the very loveliest--oh\"--she broke off suddenly, starting forward--\"there's something on the road; see, Mr. Bayley!\"  And spinning along, the horse now making up his mind to get to the depot in time, they both saw a big wagon out of which protruded two or three bags evidently containing apples and potatoes; one of the wheels determining to perform no more service for its master, was resting independently on the snowy thoroughfare, for horse and driver were gone.  \"I beg your pardon,\" exclaimed Mr. Livingston Bayley suddenly, at sight of this, \"for bringing you around here. But how was I to know of that beastly wreck?\"  \"We must get out,\" said Polly, springing off from her side of the sleigh, \"and lead the horse around.\"  But this was not so easy a matter; for the farmer's wagon had stopped in the narrowest part of the road, either side shelving off, under its treacherous covering of snow. At last, after all sorts of ineffectual attempts on Mr. Bayley's part to induce the horse to stir a step, Polly desperately laid her hand on the bridle. \"Let me try,\" she said. \"There, you good creature,\" patting the horse's nose; \"come, that's a dear old fellow,\" and they never knew quite how, but in the course of time, they were all on the other side of the wreck, and Mr. Livingston Bayley was helping her into the sleigh, and showering her with profuse apologies for the whole thing.  \"Never mind,\" said Polly, as she saw his distress, \"only never say such perfectly dreadful things to me again. And now, hurry just as fast as you can, please!\"  And presently a swift turn brought the twinkling lights of the little station to view, and there was the entire party calling to them as they now spied their approach, to \"Hurry up!\" and there also was the train, holding its breath in curbed impatience to be off.     CHAPTER V.  BAD NEWS.   \"Oh, Mamsie,\" cried Polly in dismay, \"must Papa Fisher know?\"  \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Fisher firmly, \"your father must be told every thing.\"  \"Dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, turning off in dismay, \"it seems so--so unfair to Mr. Bayley. Mightn't it be just as if he hadn't spoken, Mamsie?\" She came back now to her mother's side, and looked anxiously into the black eyes.  \"But he has spoken,\" said Mother Fisher, \"and your father must be told. Why, Polly, that isn't like you, child, to want to keep anything from him,\" she added reproachfully.  \"Oh! I don't--I couldn't ever in all this world keep anything from Father Fisher,\" declared Polly vehemently, \"only,\" and the color flew in rosy waves over her face, \"this doesn't seem like my secret, Mamsie. And Mr. Bayley would feel so badly to have it known,\" and her head drooped.  \"Still it must be known by your father,\" said her mother firmly, \"and I must tell Mr. King. Then it need go no further.\"  \"Oh, Mamsie!\" exclaimed Polly, in a sharp tone of distress, \"you wouldn't ever in all this world tell Grandpapa!\"  \"I most certainly shall,\" declared Mrs. Fisher. \"He ought to know everything that concerns you, Polly, and each one of you children. It is his right.\"  Polly sat down in the nearest chair and clasped her hands. \"Grandpapa will show Mr. Bayley that he doesn't like it,\" she mourned, \"and it will hurt his feelings.\"  Mrs. Fisher's lip curled. \"No more do I like it,\" she said curtly. \"In the first place to speak to you at all; and then to take such a way to do it; it wasn't a nice thing at all, child, for Mr. Bayley to do,\" here Mrs. Fisher walked to the window, her irritation getting the better of her, so that Polly might not see her face.  \"But he didn't mean to speak then--that is\"--began Polly.  \"He should have spoken to your father or to Mr. King,\" said Mrs. Fisher, coming back to face Polly, \"but I presume the young man didn't know any better, or at least, he didn't think, and that's enough to say about that. But as for not telling Mr. King about it, why, it isn't to be thought of for a minute. So I best have it over with at once.\" And with a reassuring smile at Polly she went out, and closed the door.  \"Oh, dear me,\" cried poor Polly, left alone; and springing out of her chair, she began to pace the floor. \"Now it will be perfectly dreadful for Mr. Bayley. Grandpapa will be very angry; he never liked him; and now he can't help showing what he feels. Oh! why did Mr. Bayley speak.\"  \"Polly,\" called Jasper's voice, out in the hall.  For the first time in her life, she felt like running away from his call. \"Oh! I can't go out; he'll guess something is the matter,\" she cried to herself.  \"Polly?\" and there was a rap at the door.  \"Yes,\" said Polly from within.  \"Can I see you a minute?\"  Polly slowly opened the door, and tried to lift her brown eyes to his face.  \"Oh, Polly,\" he pretended not to notice any thing amiss with her, \"I came to tell you first; and you can help me to break it to father.\"  \"Oh, what is it?\" cried Polly, looking up quickly. \"Oh, Jasper,\" as she saw that his face was drawn with the effort not to let her see the distress he was in.  He tried to cover up his anxiety, but she saw a yellow paper in his hand. \"Oh, Jasper, you've a telegram,\" she cried breathlessly.  \"Polly,\" said Jasper. He took her hand and held it firmly, \"you will help father and me to bear it, I know.\"  \"Oh, Jasper, I will,\" promised Polly, clinging to his hand. \"Don't be afraid to tell me, Jasper.\"  \"Listen; Marian has been thrown from her sleigh this morning; the horses ran,\" said Jasper hurriedly. \"The telegram says 'Come.' She may be living, Polly; don't look so.\"  For the room grew suddenly so dark to her that she wavered and would have fallen had he not caught her. \"I won't faint,\" she cried, \"Jasper, don't be afraid. There, I'm all right. Now, oh, what can I do?\"  \"Could you go with me when I tell father?\" asked Jasper. \"I am so afraid I shall break it to him too sharply; and you know it won't do for him to be startled. If you could, Polly.\"  For the second time, everything seemed to turn black before her eyes, but Polly said bravely, \"Yes, I'll go, Jasper.\" And presently, they hardly knew how, the two found themselves at old Mr. King's door.  There was a sound of voices within. \"Oh, dear me!\" exclaimed Polly, \"I forgot Mamsie was here.\"  Jasper looked his surprise, but said nothing, and as they stood there irresolutely, Mrs. Fisher opened the door and came out.  \"Why, Polly!\" she exclaimed.  \"Oh, Mrs. Fisher,\" cried Jasper, \"we can't explain now, we must see father. But Polly will go and tell you,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7499"],["title","Through Five Republics on Horseback, Being an Account of Many Wanderings in (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: THE AUTHOR AND HIS GUIDES THREE FAITHFUL MEN]     THROUGH FIVE REPUBLICS ON HORSEBACK  BEING AN ACCOUNT OF MANY WANDERINGS IN SOUTH AMERICA   BY   G. WHITFIELD RAY, F. R. G. S. Pioneer Missionary and Government Explorer   With an Introduction by the Rev. J. G. Brown, D. D. Secretary for the Foreign Missions of the Canadian Baptist Church   TWELFTH EDITION--REVISED  EVANGELICAL PUBLISHING HOUSE C. HAUSER, Agent CLEVELAND, OHIO, U. S. A. 1915     [Illustration: SOUTH AMERICA]     PREFACE  The _Missionary Review of the World_ has described South America as THE DARKEST LAND. That I have been able to penetrate into part of its unexplored interior, and visit tribes of people hitherto untouched and unknown, was urged as sufficient reason for the publishing of this work. In perils oft, through hunger and thirst and fever, consequent on the many wanderings in unhealthy climes herein recorded, the writer wishes publicly to record his deep thankfulness to Almighty God for His unfailing help. If the accounts are used to stimulate missionary enterprise, and if they give the reader a clearer conception of and fuller sympathy with the conditions and needs of those South American countries, those years of travel will not have been in vain.  \"Of the making of books there is no end,\" so when one is acceptably received, and commands a ready sale, the author is satisfied that his labor is well repaid. The 4th edition was scarcely dry when the Consul-General of the Argentine Republic at Ottawa ordered a large number of copies to send to the members of his Government. Much of it has been translated into German, and I know not what other languages. Even the _Catholic Register_ of Toronto has boosted its sale by printing much in abuse of it, at the same time telling its readers that the book \"sold like hot cakes.\" A wiser editor would have been discreet enough not to refer to \"Through Five Republics on Horseback.\" His readers bought it, and--had their eyes opened, for the statements made in this work, and the authorities quoted, are unanswerable.  Seeing that there is such an alarming ignorance regarding Latin America, I have, for this edition, written an Introductory Chapter on South America, and also a short Foreword especially relating to each of the Five Republics here treated. As my portrayal of Romanism there has caused some discussion, I have, in those pages, sought to incorporate the words of other authorities on South American life and religion.  That the following narratives, now again revised, and sent forth in new garb, may be increasingly helpful in promoting knowledge, is the earnest wish of the author.  G. W. R.  Toronto, Ont.     INTRODUCTION  \"Through Five Republics on Horseback\" has all the elements of a great missionary book. It is written by an author who is an eye-witness of practically all that he records, and one who by his explorations and travels has won for himself the title of the \"Livingstone of South America.\" The scenes depicted by the writer and the glimpses into the social, political and religious conditions prevailing in the Republics in the great Southern continent are of thrilling interest to all lovers of mankind. We doubt if there is another book in print that within the compass of three hundred pages begins to give as much valuable information as is contained in Mr. Ray's volume. The writer wields a facile pen, and every page glows with the passion of a man on fire with zeal for the evangelization of the great \"Neglected Continent.\" We are sure that no one can read this book and be indifferent to the claims of South America upon the Christian Church of this generation.  To those who desire to learn just what the fruits of Romanism as a system are, when left to itself and uninfluenced by Protestantism, this book will prove a real eye-opener. We doubt if any Christian man, after reading \"Through Five Republics on Horseback,\" will any longer conclude that Romanism is good enough for Romanists and that Missions to Roman Catholic countries are an impertinence. We trust the book will awaken a great interest in the evangelization of the Latin Republics of South America.  Of course, this volume will have interest for others besides missionary enthusiasts. Apart from the religious and missionary purpose of the book, it contains very much in the way of geographical, historical and scientific information, and that, too, in regard to a field of which as yet comparatively little is known. The writer has kept an open mind in his extensive travels, and his record abounds in facts of great scientific value.  We have known Mr. Ray for several years and delight to bear testimony to his ability and faithfulness as a preacher and pastor. As a lecturer on his experiences in South America he is unexcelled. We commend \"Through Five Republics on Horseback\" especially to parents who are anxious to put into the hands of their children inspiring and character-forming reading. A copy of the book ought to be in every Sunday School Library.  J. G. Brown.  626 Confederation Life Building, Toronto.     A PRELIMINARY WORD ON SOUTH AMERICA  The Continent of South America was discovered by Spanish navigators towards the end of the fifteenth century. When the tidings of a new world beyond the seas reached Europe, Spanish and Portuguese expeditions vied with each other in exploring its coasts and sailing up its mighty rivers.  In 1494 the Pope decided that these new lands, which were nearly twice the size of Europe, should become the possession of the monarchs of Spain and Portugal. Thus by right of conquest and gift South America with its seven and a half million miles of territory and its millions of Indian inhabitants was divided between Spain and Portugal. The eastern northern half, now called Brazil, became the possession of the Portuguese crown and the rest of the continent went to the crown of Spain. South America is 4,600 miles from north to south, and its greatest breadth from east to west is 3,500 miles. It is a country of plains and mountains and rivers. The Andean range of mountains is 4,400 miles long. Twelve peaks tower three miles or more above ocean level, and some reach into the sky for more than four miles. Many of these are burning mountains; the volcano of Cotopaxi is three miles higher than Vesuvius. Its rivers are among the longest in the world. The Amazon, Orinoco and La Plata systems drain an area of 3,686,400 square miles. Its plains are almost boundless and its forests limitless. There are deserts where no rain ever falls, and there are stretches of coast line where no day ever passes without rain. It is a country where all climates can be found. As the northern part of the continent is equatorial the greatest degree of heat is there experienced, while the south stretches its length toward the Pole Quito, the capital of Ecuador, is on the equator, and Punta Arenas, in Chile, is the southernmost town in the world.  For hundreds of years Spain and Portugal exploited and ruled with an iron hand their new and vast possessions. Their coffers were enriched by fabulous sums of gold and treasure, for the wildest dream of riches indulged in by its discoverers fell infinitely short of the actual reality. Large numbers of colonists left the Iberian peninsula for the newer and richer lands. Priests, monks and nuns went in every vessel, and the Roman Catholicism of the Dark Ages was soon firmly established as the only religion. The aborigines were compelled to bow before the crucifix and worship Mary until, in a peculiar sense, South America became the Pope's favorite parish. For the benefit of any, native or colonist, who thought that a purer religion should be, at any rate, permitted, the Inquisition was established at Lima, and later on at Cartagena, where, Colombian history informs us, 400,000 were condemned to death. Free thought was soon stamped out when death became the penalty.  Such was the wild state of the country and the power vested in the priests that abuses were tolerated which, even in Rome, had not been dreamed of. The priests, as anxious for spiritual conquest as the rest were for physical, joined hands with the heathenism of the Indians, accepted their gods of wood and stone as saints, set up the crucifix side by side with the images of the sun and moon, formerly worshipped; and while in Europe the sun of the Reformation arose and dispelled the terrible night of religious error and superstition, South America sank from bad to worse. Thus the anomaly presented itself of the old, effete lands throwing off the yoke of religious domination while the younger ones were for centuries to be content with sinking lower and lower. [Footnote: History is repeating itself, for here in Canada we see Quebec more Catholic and intolerant than Italy. The Mayor of Rome dared to criticize the Pope in 1910, but in the same year at the Eucharistic Congress at Montreal his emissaries receive reverent \"homage\" from those in authority. No wonder, therefore, that, while the Romans are being more enlightened every year, a Quebec young man, who is now a theological student in McMaster University, Toronto, declared, while staying in the writer's home, that, as a child he was always taught that Protestants grew horns on their heads, and that he attained the age of 15 before ever he discovered that such was not the case. Even backward Portugal has had its eyes opened to see that Rome and progress cannot walk together, but the President of Brazil is so \"faithful\" that the Pope, in 1910, made him a \"Knight of the Golden Spur.\"]  If the religious emancipation of the old world did not find its echo in South America, ideas of freedom from kingly oppression began to take root in the hearts of the people, and before the year 1825 the Spanish colonies had risen against the mother country and had formed themselves into several independent republics, while three years before that the independence of Brazil from Portugal had"]]]
