If ever man needed it, I do. Goodwin--can you imagine yourself in another world, alien, unfamiliar, a world of terror, whose unknown joy is its greatest terror of all; you all alone there, a stranger! As such a man would need help, so I need--\"  He paused abruptly and arose; the cigarette dropped from his fingers. The moon had again broken through the clouds, and this time much nearer. Not a mile away was the patch of light that it threw upon the waves. Back of it, to the rim of the sea was a lane of moonlight; a gigantic gleaming serpent racing over the edge of the world straight and surely toward the ship.  Throckmartin stiffened to it as a pointer does to a hidden covey.  To me from him pulsed a thrill of horror--but horror tinged with an unfamiliar, an infernal joy. It came to me and passed away--leaving me trembling with its shock of bitter sweet.  He bent forward, all his soul in his eyes.  The moon path swept closer, closer still. It was now less than half a mile away. From it the ship fled--almost as though pursued. Down upon it, swift and straight, a radiant torrent cleaving the waves, raced the moon stream.  \"Good God!\" breathed Throckmartin, and if ever the words were a prayer and an invocation they were.  And then, for the first time--I saw--_it_!  The moon path stretched to the horizon and was bordered by darkness. It was as though the clouds above had been parted to form a lane-drawn aside like curtains or as the waters of the Red Sea were held back to let the hosts of Israel through. On each side of the stream was the black shadow cast by the folds of the high canopies And straight as a road between the opaque walls gleamed, shimmered, and danced the shining, racing, rapids of the moonlight.  Far, it seemed immeasurably far, along this stream of silver fire I sensed, rather than saw, something coming. It drew first into sight as a deeper glow within the light. On and on it swept toward us--an opalescent mistiness that sped with the suggestion of some winged creature in arrowed flight. Dimly there crept into my mind memory of the Dyak legend of the winged messenger of Buddha--the Akla bird whose feathers are woven of the moon rays, whose heart is a living opal, whose wings in flight echo the crystal clear music of the white stars--but whose beak is of frozen flame and shreds the souls of unbelievers.  Closer it drew and now there came to me sweet, insistent tinklings--like pizzicati on violins of glass; crystal clear; diamonds melting into sounds!  Now the Thing was close to the end of the white path; close up to the barrier of darkness still between the ship and the sparkling head of the moon stream. Now it beat up against that barrier as a bird against the bars of its cage. It whirled with shimmering plumes, with swirls of lacy light, with spirals of living vapour. It held within it odd, unfamiliar gleams as of shifting mother-of-pearl. Coruscations and glittering atoms drifted through it as though it drew them from the rays that bathed it.  Nearer and nearer it came, borne on the sparkling waves, and ever thinner shrank the protecting wall of shadow between it and us. Within the mistiness was a core, a nucleus of intenser light--veined, opaline, effulgent, intensely alive. And above it, tangled in the plumes and spirals that throbbed and whirled were seven glowing lights.  Through all the incessant but strangely ordered movement of the--_thing_--these lights held firm and steady. They were seven--like seven little moons. One was of a pearly pink, one of a delicate nacreous blue, one of lambent saffron, one of the emerald you see in the shallow waters of tropic isles; a deathly white; a ghostly amethyst; and one of the silver that is seen only when the flying fish leap beneath the moon.  The tinkling music was louder still.  It pierced the ears with a shower of tiny lances; it made the heart beat jubilantly--and checked it dolorously. It closed the throat with a throb of rapture and gripped it tight with the hand of infinite sorrow!  Came to me now a murmuring cry, stilling the crystal notes.  It was articulate--but as though from something utterly foreign to this world. The ear took the cry and translated with conscious labour into the sounds of earth. And even as it compassed, the brain shrank from it irresistibly, and simultaneously it seemed reached toward it with irresistible eagerness.  Throckmartin strode toward the front of the deck, straight toward the vision, now but a few yards away from the stern. His face had lost all human semblance. Utter agony and utter ecstasy--there they were side by side, not resisting each other; unholy inhuman companions blending into a look that none of God's creatures should wear--and deep, deep as his soul! A devil and a God dwelling harmoniously side by side! So must Satan, newly fallen, still divine, seeing heaven and contemplating hell, have appeared.  And then--swiftly the moon path faded!  The clouds swept over the sky as though a hand had drawn them together. Up from the south came a roaring squall. As the moon vanished what I had seen vanished with it--blotted out as an image on a magic lantern; the tinkling ceased abruptly--leaving a silence like that which follows an abrupt thunder clap. There was nothing about us but silence and blackness!  Through me passed a trembling as one who has stood on the very verge of the gulf wherein the men of the Louisades says lurks the fisher of the souls of men, and has been plucked back by sheerest chance.  Throckmartin passed an arm around me.  \"It is as I thought,\" he said.  In his voice was a new note; the calm certainty that has swept aside a waiting terror of the unknown. \"Now I know! Come with me to my cabin, old friend. For now that you too have seen I can tell you\"--he hesitated--\"what it was you saw,\" he ended.  As we passed through the door we met the ship's first officer. Throckmartin composed his face into at least a semblance of normality.  \"Going to have much of a storm?\" he asked.  \"Yes,\" said the mate.  \"Probably all the way to Melbourne.\"  Throckmartin straightened as though with a new thought. He gripped the officer's sleeve eagerly.  \"You mean at least cloudy weather--for\"--he hesitated--\"for the next three nights, say?\"  \"And for three more,\" replied the mate.  \"Thank God!\" cried Throckmartin, and I think I never heard such relief and hope as was in his voice.  The sailor stood amazed.  \"Thank God?\" he repeated. \"Thank--what d'ye mean?\"  But Throckmartin was moving onward to his cabin.  I started to follow. The first officer stopped me.  \"Your friend,\" he said, \"is he ill?\"  \"The sea!\" I answered hurriedly.  \"He's not used to it.  I am going to look after him.\"  Doubt and disbelief were plain in the seaman's eyes but I hurried on. For I knew now that Throckmartin was ill indeed--but with a sickness the ship's doctor nor any other could heal.    CHAPTER II  \"Dead!  All Dead!\"  He was sitting, face in hands, on the side of his berth as I entered. He had taken off his coat.  \"Throck,\" I cried.  \"What was it?  What are you flying from, man? Where is your wife--and Stanton?\"  \"Dead!\" he replied monotonously.  \"Dead!  All dead!\" Then as I recoiled from him--\"All dead. Edith, Stanton, Thora--dead--or worse. And Edith in the Moon Pool--with them--drawn by what you saw on the moon path--that has put its brand upon me--and follows me!\"  He ripped open his shirt.  \"Look at this,\" he said.  Around his chest, above his heart, the skin was white as pearl. This whiteness was sharply defined against the healthy tint of the body. It circled him with an even cincture about two inches wide.  \"Burn it!\" he said, and offered me his cigarette.  I drew back.  He gestured--peremptorily. I pressed the glowing end of the cigarette into the ribbon of white flesh. He did not flinch nor was there odour of burning nor, as I drew the little cylinder away, any mark upon the whiteness.  \"Feel it!\" he commanded again.  I placed my fingers upon the band.  It was cold--like frozen marble.  He drew his shirt around him.  \"Two things you have seen,\" he said.  \"_It_--and its mark. Seeing, you must believe my story. Goodwin, I tell you again that my wife is dead--or worse--I do not know; the prey of--what you saw; so, too, is Stanton; so Thora. How--\"  Tears rolled down the seared face.  \"Why did God let it conquer us?  Why did He let it take my Edith?\" he cried in utter bitterness. \"Are there things stronger than God, do you think, Walter?\"  I hesitated.  \"Are there?  Are there?\" His wild eyes searched me.  \"I do not know just how you define God,\" I managed at last through my astonishment to make answer. \"If you mean the will to know, working through science--\"  He waved me aside impatiently.  \"Science,\" he said.  \"What is our science against--that? Or against the science of whatever devils that made it--or made the way for it to enter this world of ours?\"  With an effort he regained control.  \"Goodwin,\" he said, \"do you know at all of the ruins on the Carolines; the cyclopean, megalithic cities and harbours of Ponape and Lele, of Kusaie, of Ruk and Hogolu, and a score of other islets there? Particularly, do you know of the Nan-Matal and the Metalanim?\"  \"Of the Metalanim I have heard and seen photographs,\" I said.  \"They call it, don't they, the Lost Venice of the Pacific?\"  \"Look at this map,\" said Throckmartin.  \"That,\" he went on, \"is Christian's chart of Metalanim harbour and the Nan-Matal. Do you see the rectangles marked Nan-Tauach?\"  \"Yes,\" I said.  \"There,\" he said, \"under those walls is the Moon Pool and the seven gleaming lights that raise the Dweller in the Pool, and the altar and shrine of the Dweller. And there in the Moon Pool with it lie Edith and Stanton and Thora.\"  \"The Dweller in the Moon Pool?\" I repeated half-incredulously.  \"The Thing you saw,\" said Throckmartin solemnly.  A"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/765"],["title","The Moon Pool (#2)"],["body","sheet of rain swept the ports, and the Southern Queen began to roll on the rising swells. Throckmartin drew another deep breath of relief, and drawing aside a curtain peered out into the night. Its blackness seemed to reassure him. At any rate, when he sat again he was entirely calm.  \"There are no more wonderful ruins in the world,\" he began almost casually. \"They take in some fifty islets and cover with their intersecting canals and lagoons about twelve square miles. Who built them? None knows. When were they built? Ages before the memory of present man, that is sure. Ten thousand, twenty thousand, a hundred thousand years ago--the last more likely.  \"All these islets, Walter, are squared, and their shores are frowning seawalls of gigantic basalt blocks hewn and put in place by the hands of ancient man. Each inner water-front is faced with a terrace of those basalt blocks which stand out six feet above the shallow canals that meander between them. On the islets behind these walls are time-shattered fortresses, palaces, terraces, pyramids; immense courtyards strewn with ruins--and all so old that they seem to wither the eyes of those who look on them.  \"There has been a great subsidence.  You can stand out of Metalanim harbour for three miles and look down upon the tops of similar monolithic structures and walls twenty feet below you in the water.  \"And all about, strung on their canals, are the bulwarked islets with their enigmatic walls peering through the dense growths of mangroves--dead, deserted for incalculable ages; shunned by those who live near.  \"You as a botanist are familiar with the evidence that a vast shadowy continent existed in the Pacific--a continent that was not rent asunder by volcanic forces as was that legendary one of Atlantis in the Eastern Ocean.[1] My work in Java, in Papua, and in the Ladrones had set my mind upon this Pacific lost land. Just as the Azores are believed to be the last high peaks of Atlantis, so hints came to me steadily that Ponape and Lele and their basalt bulwarked islets were the last points of the slowly sunken western land clinging still to the sunlight, and had been the last refuge and sacred places of the rulers of that race which had lost their immemorial home under the rising waters of the Pacific.  \"I believed that under these ruins I might find the evidence that I sought.  \"My--my wife and I had talked before we were married of making this our great work. After the honeymoon we prepared for the expedition. Stanton was as enthusiastic as ourselves. We sailed, as you know, last May for fulfilment of my dreams.  \"At Ponape we selected, not without difficulty, workmen to help us--diggers. I had to make extraordinary inducements before I could get together my force. Their beliefs are gloomy, these Ponapeans. They people their swamps, their forests, their mountains, and shores, with malignant spirits--ani they call them. And they are afraid--bitterly afraid of the isles of ruins and what they think the ruins hide. I do not wonder--now!  \"When they were told where they were to go, and how long we expected to stay, they murmured. Those who, at last, were tempted made what I thought then merely a superstitious proviso that they were to be allowed to go away on the three nights of the full moon. Would to God we had heeded them and gone too!\"  \"We passed into Metalanim harbour.  Off to our left--a mile away arose a massive quadrangle. Its walls were all of forty feet high and hundreds of feet on each side. As we drew by, our natives grew very silent; watched it furtively, fearfully. I knew it for the ruins that are called Nan-Tauach, the 'place of frowning walls.' And at the silence of my men I recalled what Christian had written of this place; of how he had come upon its 'ancient platforms and tetragonal enclosures of stonework; its wonder of tortuous alleyways and labyrinth of shallow canals; grim masses of stonework peering out from behind verdant screens; cyclopean barricades,' and of how, when he had turned 'into its ghostly shadows, straight-way the merriment of guides was hushed and conversation died down to whispers.'\"  He was silent for a little time.  \"Of course I wanted to pitch our camp there,\" he went on again quietly, \"but I soon gave up that idea. The natives were panic-stricken--threatened to turn back. 'No,' they said, 'too great ani there. We go to any other place--but not there.'  \"We finally picked for our base the islet called Uschen-Tau.  It was close to the isle of desire, but far enough away from it to satisfy our men. There was an excellent camping-place and a spring of fresh water. We pitched our tents, and in a couple of days the work was in full swing.\"   [1] For more detailed observations on these points refer to G.

CHAPTER III  The Moon Rock  \"I do not intend to tell you now,\" Throckmartin continued, \"the results of the next two weeks, nor of what we found. Later--if I am allowed, I will lay all that before you. It is sufficient to say that at the end of those two weeks I had found confirmation for many of my theories.  \"The place, for all its decay and desolation, had not infected us with any touch of morbidity--that is not Edith, Stanton, or myself. But Thora was very unhappy. She was a Swede, as you know, and in her blood ran the beliefs and superstitions of the Northland--some of them so strangely akin to those of this far southern land; beliefs of spirits of mountain and forest and water werewolves and beings malign. From the first she showed a curious sensitivity to what, I suppose, may be called the 'influences' of the place. She said it 'smelled' of ghosts and warlocks.  \"I laughed at her then--  \"Two weeks slipped by, and at their end the spokesman for our natives came to us. The next night was the full of the moon, he said. He reminded me of my promise. They would go back to their village in the morning; they would return after the third night, when the moon had begun to wane. They left us sundry charms for our 'protection,' and solemnly cautioned us to keep as far away as possible from Nan-Tauach during their absence. Half-exasperated, half-amused I watched them go.  \"No work could be done without them, of course, so we decided to spend the days of their absence junketing about the southern islets of the group. We marked down several spots for subsequent exploration, and on the morning of the third day set forth along the east face of the breakwater for our camp on Uschen-Tau, planning to have everything in readiness for the return of our men the next day.  \"We landed just before dusk, tired and ready for our cots. It was only a little after ten o'clock that Edith awakened me.  \"'Listen!' she said.  'Lean over with your ear close to the ground!'  \"I did so, and seemed to hear, far, far below, as though coming up from great distances, a faint chanting. It gathered strength, died down, ended; began, gathered volume, faded away into silence.  \"'It's the waves rolling on rocks somewhere,' I said.  'We're probably over some ledge of rock that carries the sound.'  \"'It's the first time I've heard it,' replied my wife doubtfully.  We listened again. Then through the dim rhythms, deep beneath us, another sound came. It drifted across the lagoon that lay between us and Nan-Tauach in little tinkling waves. It was music--of a sort; I won't describe the strange effect it had upon me. You've felt it--\"  \"You mean on the deck?\" I asked.  Throckmartin nodded.  \"I went to the flap of the tent,\" he continued, \"and peered out. As I did so Stanton lifted his flap and walked out into the moonlight, looking over to the other islet and listening. I called to him.  \"'That's the queerest sound!' he said.  He listened again. 'Crystalline! Like little notes of translucent glass. Like the bells of crystal on the sistrums of Isis at Dendarah Temple,' he added half-dreamily. We gazed intently at the island. Suddenly, on the sea-wall, moving slowly, rhythmically, we saw a little group of lights. Stanton laughed.  \"'The beggars!' he exclaimed.  'That's why they wanted to get away, is it? Don't you see, Dave, it's some sort of a festival--rites of some kind that they hold during the full moon! That's why they were so eager to have us _keep_ away, too.'  \"The explanation seemed good.  I felt a curious sense of relief, although I had not been sensible of any oppression.  \"'Let's slip over,' suggested Stanton--but I would not.  \"'They're a difficult lot as it is,' I said.  'If we break into one of their religious ceremonies they'll probably never forgive us. Let's keep out of any family party where we haven't been invited.'  \"'That's so,' agreed Stanton.  \"The strange tinkling rose and fell, rose and fell--  \"'There's something--something very unsettling about it,' said Edith at last soberly. 'I wonder what they make those sounds with. They frighten me half to death, and, at the same time, they make me feel as though some enormous rapture were just around the corner.'  \"'It's devilish uncanny!' broke in Stanton.  \"And as he spoke the flap of Thora's tent was raised and out into the moonlight strode the old Swede. She was the great Norse type--tall, deep-breasted, moulded on the old Viking lines. Her sixty years had slipped from her. She looked like some ancient priestess of Odin.  \"She stood there, her eyes wide, brilliant, staring.  She thrust her head forward toward Nan-Tauach, regarding the moving lights; she listened. Suddenly she raised her arms and made a curious gesture to the moon. It was--an archaic--movement; she seemed to drag it from remote antiquity--yet in it was a strange suggestion of power, Twice she repeated this gesture and--the tinklings died away! She turned"]]]
