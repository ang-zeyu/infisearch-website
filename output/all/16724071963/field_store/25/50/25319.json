On the other side stood Fort Wintermoot and Forty Fort, the former being at the upper end of the valley. That would be the first one reached by the invaders, and the expectation was that it would give up whenever ordered to do so, for nearly all in it were friends of the Tories.  It was evident that when Omas left his child with her friends, and spoke of returning the next day, or soon thereafter, he did not know how near the invasion was. Mrs. Ripley expected that when he did learn it, he would hasten back for her.  The night, however, passed without his appearance, and the hot July sun came up over the forests on the eastern bank of the river, and still he remained away. It looked as if he had decided to let her take her chances while he joined the invaders in their work of destruction and woe.  Mrs. Ripley would have been willing to wait longer, but she was urged not to lose another hour. The frightened settlers were not allowed to take anything but their actual necessaries with them, for the cramped quarters in Forty Fort, where a number of cabins were erected, would be crowded to the utmost to make room for the hundreds who might clamor for admission. The quarters, indeed, were so scant that many camped outside, holding themselves ready to rush within should it become necessary.  Little Linna was filled with wonder when she saw her friends preparing to move and knew she was going with them. But she helped in her way as much as she could and asked no questions. There was no need, in fact, for Alice asked enough for both.  And just here I must relate to you a little history.  On the last days of June, 1778, Colonel John Butler, with about four hundred soldiers--partly made up of Tories--and six or seven hundred Indians, entered the head of Wyoming Valley. As I have said, he was a cousin of Colonel Zebulon Butler, who commanded the patriots and did all he could to check the invaders. Reaching Fort Wintermoot, the British officer sent in a demand for its surrender. The submission was made, and the invaders then came down the valley and ordered the Connecticut people to surrender Forty Fort and the settlements. Colonel Zebulon Butler had under him, to quote the historical account, \"two hundred and thirty enrolled men, and seventy old people, boys, civil magistrates, and other volunteers.\" They formed six companies, which were mustered at Forty Fort, where the families of the settlers on the east side of the river had taken refuge.  Colonel Zebulon Butler, upon receiving the summons, called a council of war. This was on the 3rd of July. The officers believed that a little delay would be best, in the hope of the arrival of reinforcements; but nearly all the men were so clamorous to march out and give the invaders battle, that it was decided to do so.  \"You are going into great danger,\" remarked the leader, as he mounted his horse and placed himself at the head of the patriots, \"but I will go as far as any of you.\"  At three o'clock in the afternoon the column, numbering about three hundred, marched from the fort with drums beating and colors flying. They moved up the valley, with the river on the right and a marsh on the left, until they arrived at Fort Wintermoot, which had been set on fire by the enemy to give the impression they were withdrawing from the neighborhood.  As you may well believe, the movements of the patriots were watched with deep interest by those left behind. The women and children clustered along the river bank and strained their eyes in the direction of Fort Wintermoot, the black smoke from which rolled down the valley and helped to shut out their view.  There was hardly one among the spectators that had not a loved relative with the defenders. It might be a tottering grandfather, a sturdy son, who, though a boy, was inspired with the deepest fervor, and eager to risk his life for the sake of his mother or sister, whose hearts almost stopped beating in the painful suspense which must continue until the battle was decided.  Alice was too young fully to understand the peril in which Ben was placed. She had kissed him goodbye when he ran to take his place with the others, and, with a light jest on his lips about her and Linna, he had snatched a kiss from the little Delaware's swarthy cheek.  The mother added a few cheering words to the children, and it was a striking sight when they and a number of others, about their age or under, began playing with all the merriment of children who never dream that the world contains such afflictions as sorrow, woe, and death.  It was easy to follow the course of the patriots for a time after they were beyond sight, by the sound of their drums and the shrill whistling of several fifes.  In those days it was much more common than now for people to drink intoxicating liquors. Just before the patriots started up the valley, I am sorry to say, a few of the men drank more than they should. It has been claimed by some that but for this things would have gone differently on that day, which will live for ever as one of the saddest in American history.  By and by the anxious people near the fort noticed that the sound of drums and fifes had ceased, and the reports of firearms were heard.  They knew from this that the opposing forces were making ready for the conflict, and the suspense became painful indeed.  Then amid the rattle of musketry sounded the whoops of the Iroquois. The battle was on. Fighting began about four o'clock in the afternoon. Colonel Zebulon Butler ordered his men to fire, and at each discharge to advance a step. The fire was regular and steady, and the Americans continued to gain ground, having the advantage where it was open. Despite the exertions of the invaders, their line gave way, and but for the help of the Indians they would have been routed.  The flanking party of red men kept up a galling fire on the right, and the patriots dropped fast. The Indians on the Tory left were divided into six bands who kept up a continuous yelling which did much to inspirit each other, while the deadly aim told sadly upon the Americans.  The most powerful body of Indians was in a swamp on the left of the patriots, and by and by they outflanked them. The Americans tried to manoeuvre so as to face the new danger, but some of them mistook the order for one to retreat. Everything was thrown into confusion.  Colonel Zebulon Butler, seeing how things were going, galloped up and down between the opposing lines, calling out--\"Don't leave me, my children. Stand by me and the victory is ours!\"  But it was too late. The patriots could not be rallied. They were far outnumbered, and once thrown into a panic, with the captain of every company slain, the day was lost.  You cannot picture the distress of the women, children, and feeble old men waiting at Forty Fort the issue of the battle.  The sorrowful groups on the bank of the river listened to the sounds of conflict, and read the meaning as they came to their ears.  The steady, regular firing raised their hopes at first. They knew their sons and friends were fighting well, despite the shouts of the Indians borne down the valley on the sultry afternoon.  By and by the firing grew more scattering, and instead of being so far up the river as at first, it was coming closer.  This could mean but one thing; the patriots were retreating before the Tories and Indians.  One old man, nearly four score years of age, who pleaded to go into the battle, but was too feeble, could not restrain his feelings. He walked back and forth, inspired with new strength and full of hope, until the scattered firing and its approach left no doubt of its meaning.  He paused in his nervous, hobbling pace, and said to the white faced women standing breathlessly near--\"Our boys are retreating: they have been beaten--all hope is gone!\"  The next moment two horsemen galloped into sight. \"Colonel Butler and Colonel Denison!\" said the old man, recognizing them; \"they bring sad news.\"  It was true. They rode their horses on a dead run, and reining up at the fort, where the people crowded around them, they leaped to the ground, and Colonel Butler said--\"Our boys have been driven from the field, and the Tories and Indians are at their heels!\"    CHAPTER FOUR: THE EASTERN SHORE  Young Ben Ripley made a good record on that eventful 3rd of July. He loaded and fired as steadily as a veteran. The smoke of the guns, the wild whooping of the Iroquois Indians, the sight of his friends and neighbors continually dropping to the ground, some of them at his elbow, the deafening discharge of the rifles--all these and the dreadful swirl and rush of events dazed him at times; but he kept at it with a steadiness which caused more than one expression of praise from the officers nearest him.  All at once he found himself mixed up in the confusion caused by the attempt to wheel a part of the line to face the flanking assailants, and the mistake of many that it was an order to retreat.  He did not know what it meant, for it seemed to him that a dozen officers were shouting conflicting orders at the same moment. A number of men threw down their guns and made a wild rush to get away, several falling over each other in the frantic scramble; others bumped together, and above the din of the conflict sounded the voices of Colonel Butler, as he rode back and forth through the smoke, begging his troops not to leave him, and victory would be theirs.  Seeing the hopeless tangle, the Indians swarmed out of the swamp, and by their savage attack and renewed shouts made the hubbub and confusion tenfold worse.  Somebody ran so violently against Ben that he was thrown to the ground. He was on his feet in an instant and turned to see who did it."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7493"],["title","The Daughter of the Chieftain : the Story of an Indian Girl (#4)"],["body","was a soldier fleeing for life from an Iroquois warrior.  Ben raised his gun, took quick aim and pulled the trigger, but no report followed. He had forgotten his weapon was unloaded.  Other forms obtruded between him and the couple, and he could not see the result of the pursuit and attack. Despite all he could do, he was forced back by the panic stricken rush around and against him.  Suddenly a wild cry reached him. An Iroquois with painted face rushed upon him with uplifted tomahawk, but he was yet several paces away, when another warrior seized his arm and wrenched him to one side.  \"Run--go fast--don't stay!\" commanded the Indian that had saved the youth, furiously motioning to him.  \"If my gun were loaded,\" replied Ben, though his voice was unheard in the din, \"I wouldn't go till I did something more. Helloa! is that you, Omas?\"  It was the Delaware that had turned the assault aside.  A couple of bounds placed him beside he lad, and he caught his arm with a grip of iron.  It was of no use trying to hold back. Omas half running, half leaping, drove his way like a wedge through the surging swarm. His left hand closed around the upper arm of Ben, while his right grasped his tomahawk, he having thrown aside his rifle.  The boy was repeatedly jerked almost off his feet. He could run fast, but was not equal to this warrior, who forged along with resistless might. Twice did an Iroquois make for the young prisoner, as he supposed the lad to be, but a warning motion of the tomahawk upheld by Omas repelled him.  The Delaware was prudent, and instead of keeping in the midst of the surging mass, worked to one side, so that they were soon comparatively free from the tumultuous throng.  There was no attempt at conversation between the Delaware and Ben. The boy knew what was meant by this rough kindness. The day was lost, and his thoughts went out to the loved ones waiting down the valley to learn the result of the battle. He wanted to get to them as quickly as he could.  The rush carried them beyond the main body of fugitives, though not out of danger, for the Iroquois were pursuing hard; but soon Omas loosened his grip and dropped the arm of the lad. They were far enough removed from the swirl to exchange words.  \"Where moder--where Alice?\", asked the Delaware, as if he had no concern for his own child.  \"At Forty Fort.\"  \"Linna with them?\"  \"Yes; they are together with the other folks.\"  \"Go dere--tell cross riber--make haste to Del'mware.\"  This command meant that the little party should hurry to the eastern side of the Susquehanna, and start for the settlements on the Upper Delaware. The nearest town was Stroudsburg, sixty miles distant, and the way led through a dismal forest.  The words of Omas showed, too, that he knew what was coming. Though the British Colonel Butler might accept the surrender and strive to give fair treatment to the prisoners, he would find it hard to restrain the Tories and Indians.  All that could be done was for the fugitives to flee, without an hour's delay. They were already flocking to the river in the effort to reach the other side. A good many hid among the grass and undergrowth on Monacacy Island, where the Tories and Indians followed, and hunted them out without mercy.  Those who were wise enough to set out in time had a chance of arriving at the settlements on the Upper Delaware, though much suffering was sure to follow, since there was no time to prepare food to take with them.  The remark of Omas prompted Ben's words--\"How can I get mother, and Alice and Linna, to the other side? They cannot swim the river.\"  \"Linna swim,\" was the somewhat proud answer; \"she take care of Alice you take care of moder.\"  \"I might at any other time, but with the people crowding around us, and the Indians at our heels and shooting down all they can, what chance have we? Why can't you come with me and help them?\"  No doubt the Delaware had asked himself the question, for he answered it not by words, but by breaking into a loping trot for Forty Fort, with Ben running at his side. He halted before reaching the refuge, and turned aside among the bushes overhanging the edge of the river, his actions showing he was searching for something.  He speedily found a canoe, probably his own. It had been so skillfully hidden among the dense undergrowth that one might have passed within a couple of paces without seeing it.  He picked it up as if it were a toy boat and set it down in the water.  \"Go bring moder--bring Alice--bring Linna.\"  Ben was off like a shot, for he knew there was not a minute to throw away. It was the season when the days were longest, and two or three hours must pass before it would be fully night.  It would not do for Omas to go with Ben. His appearance at the fort would add to the panic, and be almost certain to bring about a conflict with some of the whites. It was his province to guard the precious canoe from being taken by other fugitives.  Ben Ripley now thought only of his loved ones. He knew the anguish his mother would suffer until she learned he was safe, and he forced his way to the spot where he had parted from her.  It was a sad experience. Old men, women and children, with white faces, were rushing to and fro, wringing their hands and wailing, searching for those whom they never again would see in this life; crowding into the little fort, as if they knew a minute's delay would be fatal; some making for the river, into which they plunged in a wild effort to reach the eastern shore, while among the frantic masses appeared here and there a fugitive from the scene of battle, perhaps wounded and telling his dreadful story of the defeat, with all the woeful consequences that were certain to follow.  With much difficulty and some rough work the lad reached the spot where he had bidden his mother and the children goodbye, but none of the three was in sight. They had been swept aside by the rush of the terrified people.  A cry sounded above the tumult, and before he could learn where it came from, the arms of his mother were about his neck.  \"Thank Heaven! my boy is safe! You do not know what I have suffered. I could learn nothing about you. Are you hurt?\"  \"Not a scratch--which is more than many other poor fellows can say. Where are the children?\"  A tiny hand was slipped into his own, and looking down, there stood Linna, with her forefinger between her teeth, looking shyly up at him. There could be no doubt she felt fully acquainted.  Alice came forward on the other side. Neither understood the cause of the turmoil about them. They were not scared, but were awed into silence.  \"I saw Omas,\" explained Ben to his mother; \"he saved me from the fate of many others.\"  \"Where is he?\"  \"A little way off, under the bank, waiting with his canoe, to take us across the river.  \"He says we must hurry through the woods for the settlements on the Upper Delaware. Every hour that we stay increases our danger.\"  \"Let me take Alice; lead the way.\"  Clasping tight the hand of Linna, with his mother at his heels, Ben pushed for the point where he had left the Delaware a few minutes before.  Strange that though the distance was not far, and the confusion seemed to be increasing every minute, the little party had not gone half way when they were checked by one of the men that had been in the battle. He was slightly wounded, and under the influence of liquor.  \"Who's that you've got with you?\" he demanded, looking down at Linna, who saw no danger in the act.  \"A friend of Alice and me.\"  \"She looks like an Injin,\" added the soldier, scowling threateningly at her; \"if she is, I want her.\"  \"I told you she is a friend of ours--get out of my way!\"  The soldier's condition enabled Ben to tumble him over on his back by means of a vigorous shove. Before he could steady himself and get upon his feet again, the others were beyond reach.  I am sure he would not have acted that way, had he been in the possession of his senses.  When Ben parted from Omas, he was without a rifle, but on joining him again, the warrior had a fine weapon in his hand. It was not the one with which he appeared at the house. The lad might have guessed how he got it, but he did not ask any questions, nor seem to notice it.  As the party came up, Omas merely glanced at Mrs. Ripley and her child, but did not speak. As for his own little girl, he gave her no notice. Young as she was, she understood him, and did not claim any attention from him. If they had been alone, she would have been in his arms with their cheeks together.  \"Go 'cross,\" said he, pointing toward the other shore.  \"Ben has told me what you said: we are ready,\" replied Mrs. Ripley.  He held the canoe steady and motioned her to take her place in it. She did so, and Alice nestled at her feet, being careful not to stir, for such frail craft are easily upset.  The canoe was small, and the weight of the mother and child sank it quite low, though it would hold another adult.  \"Get in,\" added Omas to the lad.  Ben obeyed. He knew all about such boats, and could have paddled it across had there been a paddle to use, but there was none.  When the Delaware laid his rifle inside with Ben's, it was evident he intended to swim, towing or shoving the boat.  \"Come, Linna, there's just room for you,\" added the youth, reaching out his hand for the dusky little girl.  Instead of obeying, she looked up at her father and said something to which he made answer brusquely, as it sounded to the others.  Retreating several paces from shore, she ran nimbly to the edge of the bank, and with a leap splashed away beyond the bow of the canoe, and began swimming like a fish for the eastern shore.  It was a real treat for her, even though she did not remove any of her clothing. The weather was sultry, and the bath refreshingly cool. Not comprehending the sad scenes around her, she dived, and splashed, and frolicked, easily keeping in advance of the boat.  Truth to tell, the canoe had all it could hold, and "]]]
