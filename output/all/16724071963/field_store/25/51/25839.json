You would be sent to bed, or something equally undignified. Again, how would you support us?’  The pirate-colonel replied in a courageous voice, ‘By rapine!’  But his bride retorted, ‘Suppose the grown-up people wouldn’t be rapined?’ ‘Then,’ said the colonel, ‘they should pay the penalty in blood.’—‘But suppose they should object,’ retorted his bride, ‘and wouldn’t pay the penalty in blood or anything else?’  A mournful silence ensued.  ‘Then do you no longer love me, Alice?’ asked the colonel.  ‘Redforth!  I am ever thine,’ returned his bride.  ‘Then do you no longer love me, Nettie?’ asked the present writer.  ‘Tinkling!  I am ever thine,’ returned my bride.  We all four embraced.  Let me not be misunderstood by the giddy.  The colonel embraced his own bride, and I embraced mine.  But two times two make four.  ‘Nettie and I,’ said Alice mournfully, ‘have been considering our position.  The grown-up people are too strong for us.  They make us ridiculous.  Besides, they have changed the times.  William Tinkling’s baby brother was christened yesterday.  What took place?  Was any king present?  Answer, William.’  I said No, unless disguised as Great-uncle Chopper.  ‘Any queen?’  There had been no queen that I knew of at our house.  There might have been one in the kitchen: but I didn’t think so, or the servants would have mentioned it.  ‘Any fairies?’  None that were visible.  ‘We had an idea among us, I think,’ said Alice, with a melancholy smile, ‘we four, that Miss Grimmer would prove to be the wicked fairy, and would come in at the christening with her crutch-stick, and give the child a bad gift.  Was there anything of that sort?  Answer, William.’  I said that ma had said afterwards (and so she had), that Great-uncle Chopper’s gift was a shabby one; but she hadn’t said a bad one.  She had called it shabby, electrotyped, second-hand, and below his income.  ‘It must be the grown-up people who have changed all this,’ said Alice. ‘_We_ couldn’t have changed it, if we had been so inclined, and we never should have been.  Or perhaps Miss Grimmer _is_ a wicked fairy after all, and won’t act up to it because the grown-up people have persuaded her not to.  Either way, they would make us ridiculous if we told them what we expected.’  ‘Tyrants!’ muttered the pirate-colonel.  ‘Nay, my Redforth,’ said Alice, ‘say not so.  Call not names, my Redforth, or they will apply to pa.’  ‘Let ’em,’ said the colonel.  ‘I do not care.  Who’s he?’  Tinkling here undertook the perilous task of remonstrating with his lawless friend, who consented to withdraw the moody expressions above quoted.  ‘What remains for us to do?’ Alice went on in her mild, wise way.  ‘We must educate, we must pretend in a new manner, we must wait.’  The colonel clenched his teeth,—four out in front, and a piece of another, and he had been twice dragged to the door of a dentist-despot, but had escaped from his guards.  ‘How educate?  How pretend in a new manner?  How wait?’  ‘Educate the grown-up people,’ replied Alice.  ‘We part to-night.  Yes, Redforth,’—for the colonel tucked up his cuffs,—‘part to-night!  Let us in these next holidays, now going to begin, throw our thoughts into something educational for the grown-up people, hinting to them how things ought to be.  Let us veil our meaning under a mask of romance; you, I, and Nettie.  William Tinkling being the plainest and quickest writer, shall copy out.  Is it agreed?’  The colonel answered sulkily, ‘I don’t mind.’  He then asked, ‘How about pretending?’  ‘We will pretend,’ said Alice, ‘that we are children; not that we are those grown-up people who won’t help us out as they ought, and who understand us so badly.’  The colonel, still much dissatisfied, growled, ‘How about waiting?’  ‘We will wait,’ answered little Alice, taking Nettie’s hand in hers, and looking up to the sky, ‘we will wait—ever constant and true—till the times have got so changed as that everything helps us out, and nothing makes us ridiculous, and the fairies have come back.  We will wait—ever constant and true—till we are eighty, ninety, or one hundred.  And then the fairies will send _us_ children, and we will help them out, poor pretty little creatures, if they pretend ever so much.’  ‘So we will, dear,’ said Nettie Ashford, taking her round the waist with both arms and kissing her.  ‘And now if my husband will go and buy some cherries for us, I have got some money.’  In the friendliest manner I invited the colonel to go with me; but he so far forgot himself as to acknowledge the invitation by kicking out behind, and then lying down on his stomach on the grass, pulling it up and chewing it.  When I came back, however, Alice had nearly brought him out of his vexation, and was soothing him by telling him how soon we should all be ninety.  As we sat under the willow-tree and ate the cherries (fair, for Alice shared them out), we played at being ninety.  Nettie complained that she had a bone in her old back, and it made her hobble; and Alice sang a song in an old woman’s way, but it was very pretty, and we were all merry.  At least, I don’t know about merry exactly, but all comfortable.  There was a most tremendous lot of cherries; and Alice always had with her some neat little bag or box or case, to hold things.  In it that night was a tiny wine-glass.  So Alice and Nettie said they would make some cherry-wine to drink our love at parting.  Each of us had a glassful, and it was delicious; and each of us drank the toast, ‘Our love at parting.’  The colonel drank his wine last; and it got into my head directly that it got into his directly.  Anyhow, his eyes rolled immediately after he had turned the glass upside down; and he took me on one side and proposed in a hoarse whisper, that we should ‘Cut ‘em out still.’  ‘How did he mean?’ I asked my lawless friend.  ‘Cut our brides out,’ said the colonel, ‘and then cut our way, without going down a single turning, bang to the Spanish main!’  We might have tried it, though I didn’t think it would answer; only we looked round and saw that there was nothing but moon-light under the willow-tree, and that our pretty, pretty wives were gone.  We burst out crying.  The colonel gave in second, and came to first; but he gave in strong.  We were ashamed of our red eyes, and hung about for half-an-hour to whiten them.  Likewise a piece of chalk round the rims, I doing the colonel’s, and he mine, but afterwards found in the bedroom looking-glass not natural, besides inflammation.  Our conversation turned on being ninety.  The colonel told me he had a pair of boots that wanted soling and heeling; but he thought it hardly worth while to mention it to his father, as he himself should so soon be ninety, when he thought shoes would be more convenient.  The colonel also told me, with his hand upon his hip, that he felt himself already getting on in life, and turning rheumatic.  And I told him the same.  And when they said at our house at supper (they are always bothering about something) that I stooped, I felt so glad!  This is the end of the beginning-part that you were to believe most.     PART II. ROMANCE.  FROM THE PEN OF MISS ALICE RAINBIRD {258}   THERE was once a king, and he had a queen; and he was the manliest of his sex, and she was the loveliest of hers.  The king was, in his private profession, under government.  The queen’s father had been a medical man out of town.  They had nineteen children, and were always having more.  Seventeen of these children took care of the baby; and Alicia, the eldest, took care of them all.  Their ages varied from seven years to seven months.  Let us now resume our story.  One day the king was going to the office, when he stopped at the fishmonger’s to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail, which the queen (who was a careful housekeeper) had requested him to send home.  Mr. Pickles, the fishmonger, said, ‘Certainly, sir; is there any other article?  Good-morning.’  The king went on towards the office in a melancholy mood; for quarter-day was such a long way off, and several of the dear children were growing out of their clothes.  He had not proceeded far, when Mr. Pickles’s errand-boy came running after him, and said, ‘Sir, you didn’t notice the old lady in our shop.’  ‘What old lady?’ inquired the king.  ‘I saw none.’  Now the king had not seen any old lady, because this old lady had been invisible to him, though visible to Mr. Pickles’s boy.  Probably because he messed and splashed the water about to that degree, and flopped the pairs of soles down in that violent manner, that, if she had not been visible to him, he would have spoilt her clothes.  Just then the old lady came trotting up.  She was dressed in shot-silk of the richest quality, smelling of dried lavender.  ‘King Watkins the First, I believe?’ said the old lady.  ‘Watkins,’ replied the king, ‘is my name.’  ‘Papa, if I am not mistaken, of the beautiful Princess Alicia?’ said the old lady.  ‘And of eighteen other darlings,’ replied the king.  ‘Listen.  You are going to the office,’ said the old lady.  It instantly flashed upon the king that she must be a fairy, or how could she know that?  ‘You are right,’ said the old lady, answering his thoughts.  ‘I am the good Fairy Grandmarina.  Attend!  When you return home to dinner, politely invite the Princess Alicia to have some of the salmon you bought just now.’  ‘It may disagree with her,’ said the king.  The old lady became so very angry at this absurd idea, that the king was quite alarmed, and humbly begged her pardon.  ‘We hear a great deal too much about this thing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/809"],["title","Holiday Romance (#2)"],["body","agreeing, and that thing disagreeing,’ said the old lady, with the greatest contempt it was possible to express.  ‘Don’t be greedy.  I think you want it all yourself.’  The king hung his head under this reproof, and said he wouldn’t talk about things disagreeing any more.  ‘Be good, then,’ said the Fairy Grandmarina, ‘and don’t.  When the beautiful Princess Alicia consents to partake of the salmon,—as I think she will,—you will find she will leave a fish-bone on her plate.  Tell her to dry it, and to rub it, and to polish it till it shines like mother-of-pearl, and to take care of it as a present from me.’  ‘Is that all?’ asked the king.  ‘Don’t be impatient, sir,’ returned the Fairy Grandmarina, scolding him severely.  ‘Don’t catch people short, before they have done speaking. Just the way with you grown-up persons.  You are always doing it.’  The king again hung his head, and said he wouldn’t do so any more.  ‘Be good, then,’ said the Fairy Grandmarina, ‘and don’t!  Tell the Princess Alicia, with my love, that the fish-bone is a magic present which can only be used once; but that it will bring her, that once, whatever she wishes for, PROVIDED SHE WISHES FOR IT AT THE RIGHT TIME. That is the message.  Take care of it.’  The king was beginning, ‘Might I ask the reason?’ when the fairy became absolutely furious.  ‘_Will_ you be good, sir?’ she exclaimed, stamping her foot on the ground.  ‘The reason for this, and the reason for that, indeed!  You are always wanting the reason.  No reason.  There!  Hoity toity me!  I am sick of your grown-up reasons.’  The king was extremely frightened by the old lady’s flying into such a passion, and said he was very sorry to have offended her, and he wouldn’t ask for reasons any more.  ‘Be good, then,’ said the old lady, ‘and don’t!’  With those words, Grandmarina vanished, and the king went on and on and on, till he came to the office.  There he wrote and wrote and wrote, till it was time to go home again.  Then he politely invited the Princess Alicia, as the fairy had directed him, to partake of the salmon.  And when she had enjoyed it very much, he saw the fish-bone on her plate, as the fairy had told him he would, and he delivered the fairy’s message, and the Princess Alicia took care to dry the bone, and to rub it, and to polish it, till it shone like mother-of-pearl.  And so, when the queen was going to get up in the morning, she said, ‘O, dear me, dear me; my head, my head!’ and then she fainted away.  The Princess Alicia, who happened to be looking in at the chamber-door, asking about breakfast, was very much alarmed when she saw her royal mamma in this state, and she rang the bell for Peggy, which was the name of the lord chamberlain.  But remembering where the smelling-bottle was, she climbed on a chair and got it; and after that she climbed on another chair by the bedside, and held the smelling-bottle to the queen’s nose; and after that she jumped down and got some water; and after that she jumped up again and wetted the queen’s forehead; and, in short, when the lord chamberlain came in, that dear old woman said to the little princess, ‘What a trot you are!  I couldn’t have done it better myself!’  But that was not the worst of the good queen’s illness.  O, no!  She was very ill indeed, for a long time.  The Princess Alicia kept the seventeen young princes and princesses quiet, and dressed and undressed and danced the baby, and made the kettle boil, and heated the soup, and swept the hearth, and poured out the medicine, and nursed the queen, and did all that ever she could, and was as busy, busy, busy as busy could be; for there were not many servants at that palace for three reasons: because the king was short of money, because a rise in his office never seemed to come, and because quarter-day was so far off that it looked almost as far off and as little as one of the stars.  But on the morning when the queen fainted away, where was the magic fish-bone?  Why, there it was in the Princess Alicia’s pocket!  She had almost taken it out to bring the queen to life again, when she put it back, and looked for the smelling-bottle.  After the queen had come out of her swoon that morning, and was dozing, the Princess Alicia hurried up-stairs to tell a most particular secret to a most particularly confidential friend of hers, who was a duchess. People did suppose her to be a doll; but she was really a duchess, though nobody knew it except the princess.  This most particular secret was the secret about the magic fish-bone, the history of which was well known to the duchess, because the princess told her everything.  The princess kneeled down by the bed on which the duchess was lying, full-dressed and wide awake, and whispered the secret to her.  The duchess smiled and nodded.  People might have supposed that she never smiled and nodded; but she often did, though nobody knew it except the princess.  Then the Princess Alicia hurried down-stairs again, to keep watch in the queen’s room.  She often kept watch by herself in the queen’s room; but every evening, while the illness lasted, she sat there watching with the king.  And every evening the king sat looking at her with a cross look, wondering why she never brought out the magic fish-bone.  As often as she noticed this, she ran up-stairs, whispered the secret to the duchess over again, and said to the duchess besides, ‘They think we children never have a reason or a meaning!’  And the duchess, though the most fashionable duchess that ever was heard of, winked her eye.  ‘Alicia,’ said the king, one evening, when she wished him good-night.  ‘Yes, papa.’  ‘What is become of the magic fish-bone?’  ‘In my pocket, papa!’  ‘I thought you had lost it?’  ‘O, no, papa!’  ‘Or forgotten it?’  ‘No, indeed, papa.’  And so another time the dreadful little snapping pug-dog, next door, made a rush at one of the young princes as he stood on the steps coming home from school, and terrified him out of his wits; and he put his hand through a pane of glass, and bled, bled, bled.  When the seventeen other young princes and princesses saw him bleed, bleed, bleed, they were terrified out of their wits too, and screamed themselves black in their seventeen faces all at once.  But the Princess Alicia put her hands over all their seventeen mouths, one after another, and persuaded them to be quiet because of the sick queen.  And then she put the wounded prince’s hand in a basin of fresh cold water, while they stared with their twice seventeen are thirty-four, put down four and carry three, eyes, and then she looked in the hand for bits of glass, and there were fortunately no bits of glass there.  And then she said to two chubby-legged princes, who were sturdy though small, ‘Bring me in the royal rag-bag: I must snip and stitch and cut and contrive.’  So these two young princes tugged at the royal rag-bag, and lugged it in; and the Princess Alicia sat down on the floor, with a large pair of scissors and a needle and thread, and snipped and stitched and cut and contrived, and made a bandage, and put it on, and it fitted beautifully; and so when it was all done, she saw the king her papa looking on by the door.  ‘Alicia.’  ‘Yes, papa.’  ‘What have you been doing?’  ‘Snipping, stitching, cutting, and contriving, papa.’  ‘Where is the magic fish-bone?’  ‘In my pocket, papa.’  ‘I thought you had lost it?’  ‘O, no, papa.’  ‘Or forgotten it?’  ‘No, indeed, papa.’  After that, she ran up-stairs to the duchess, and told her what had passed, and told her the secret over again; and the duchess shook her flaxen curls, and laughed with her rosy lips.  Well! and so another time the baby fell under the grate.  The seventeen young princes and princesses were used to it; for they were almost always falling under the grate or down the stairs; but the baby was not used to it yet, and it gave him a swelled face and a black eye.  The way the poor little darling came to tumble was, that he was out of the Princess Alicia’s lap just as she was sitting, in a great coarse apron that quite smothered her, in front of the kitchen-fire, beginning to peel the turnips for the broth for dinner; and the way she came to be doing that was, that the king’s cook had run away that morning with her own true love, who was a very tall but very tipsy soldier.  Then the seventeen young princes and princesses, who cried at everything that happened, cried and roared.  But the Princess Alicia (who couldn’t help crying a little herself) quietly called to them to be still, on account of not throwing back the queen up-stairs, who was fast getting well, and said, ‘Hold your tongues, you wicked little monkeys, every one of you, while I examine baby!’  Then she examined baby, and found that he hadn’t broken anything; and she held cold iron to his poor dear eye, and smoothed his poor dear face, and he presently fell asleep in her arms.  Then she said to the seventeen princes and princesses, ‘I am afraid to let him down yet, lest he should wake and feel pain; be good, and you shall all be cooks.’  They jumped for joy when they heard that, and began making themselves cooks’ caps out of old newspapers.  So to one she gave the salt-box, and to one she gave the barley, and to one she gave the herbs, and to one she gave the turnips, and to one she gave the carrots, and to one she gave the onions, and to one she gave the spice-box, till they were all cooks, and all running about at work, she sitting in the middle, smothered in the great coarse apron, nursing baby.  By and by the broth was done; and the baby woke up, smiling, like an angel, and was trusted to the sedatest princess to hold, while the other princes and princesses were squeezed into a far-off corner to look at the Princess Alicia turning out the saucepanful of broth, for fear (as they were always getting into trouble) they should get splashed and scalded.  When the broth came tumbling out, steaming beautifully, and smelling like a nosegay good to eat,"]]]
