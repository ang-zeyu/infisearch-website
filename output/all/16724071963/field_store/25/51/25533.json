Nor was even this margin safe, nor the property out of peril; for the principal mortgagee, who was a capitalist in Paris named Louvier, having had during the life of the late Marquis more than once to wait for his half-yearly interest longer than suited his patience,--and his patience was not enduring,--plainly declared that if the same delay recurred he should put his right of seizure in force; and in France still more than in England, bad seasons seriously affect the security of rents.  To pay away L9,600 a year regularly out of L10,000, with the penalty of forfeiting the whole if not paid,--whether crops may fail, farmers procrastinate, and timber fall in price,--is to live with the sword of Damocles over one's head.  For two years and more, however, Alain met his difficulties with prudence and vigour; he retrenched the establishment hitherto kept at the chateau, resigned such rural pleasures as he had been accustomed to indulge, and lived like one of his petty farmers.  But the risks of the future remained undiminished.  \"There is but one way, Monsieur le Marquis,\" said the family notary, M. Hebert, \"by which you can put your estate in comparative safety. Your father raised his mortgages from time to time, as he wanted money, and often at interest above the average market interest.  You may add considerably to your income by consolidating all these mortgages into one at a lower percentage, and in so doing pay off this formidable mortgagee, M. Louvier, who, I shrewdly suspect, is bent upon becoming the proprietor of Rochebriant.  Unfortunately those few portions of your land which were but lightly charged, and, lying contiguous to small proprietors, were coveted by them, and could be advantageously sold, are already gone to pay the debts of Monsieur the late Marquis.  There are, however, two small farms which, bordering close on the town of S_____, I think I could dispose of for building purposes at high rates; but these lands are covered by M. Louvier's general mortgage, and he has refused to release them, unless the whole debt be paid.  Were that debt therefore transferred to another mortgagee, we might stipulate for their exception, and in so doing secure a sum of more than 100,000 francs, which you could keep in reserve for a pressing or unforeseen occasion, and make the nucleus of a capital devoted to the gradual liquidation of the charges on the estate.  For with a little capital, Monsieur le Marquis, your rent- roll might be very greatly increased, the forests and orchards improved, those meadows round S_____  drained and irrigated.  Agriculture is beginning to be understood in Bretagne, and your estate would soon double its value in the hands of a spirited capitalist.  My advice to you, therefore, is to go to Paris, employ a good 'avoue,' practised in such branch of his profession, to negotiate the consolidation of your mortgages upon terms that will enable you to sell outlying portions, and so pay off the charge by instalments agreed upon; to see if some safe company or rich individual can be found to undertake for a term of years the management of your forests, the draining of the S_____  meadows, the superintendence of your fisheries, etc.  They, it is true, will monopolize the profits for many years,--perhaps twenty; but you are a young man: at the end of that time you will reenter on your estate with a rental so improved that the mortgages, now so awful, will seem to you comparatively trivial.\"  In pursuance of this advice, the young Marquis had come to Paris fortified with a letter from M. Hebert to an 'avoue' of eminence, and with many letters from his aunt to the nobles of the Faubourg connected with his house.  Now one reason why M. Hebert had urged his client to undertake this important business in person, rather than volunteer his own services in Paris, was somewhat extra-professional.  He had a sincere and profound affection for Alain; he felt compassion for that young life so barrenly wasted in seclusion and severe privations; he respected, but was too practical a man of business to share, those chivalrous sentiments of loyalty to an exiled dynasty which disqualified the man for the age he lived in, and, if not greatly modified, would cut him off from the hopes and aspirations of his eager generation.  He thought plausibly enough that the air of the grand metropolis was necessary to the mental health, enfeebled and withering amidst the feudal mists of Bretagne; that once in Paris, Alain would imbibe the ideas of Paris, adapt himself to some career leading to honour and to fortune, for which he took facilities from his high birth, an historical name too national for any dynasty not to welcome among its adherents, and an intellect not yet sharpened by contact and competition with others, but in itself vigorous, habituated to thought, and vivified by the noble aspirations which belong to imaginative natures.  At the least, Alain would be at Paris in the social position which would afford him the opportunities of a marriage, in which his birth and rank would be readily accepted as an equivalent to some ample fortune that would serve to redeem the endangered seigneuries.  He therefore warned Alain that the affair for which he went to Paris might be tedious, that lawyers were always slow, and advised him to calculate on remaining several months, perhaps a year; delicately suggesting that his rearing hitherto had been too secluded for his age and rank, and that a year at Paris, even if he failed in the object which took him there, would not be thrown away in the knowledge of men and things that would fit him better to grapple with his difficulties on his return.  Alain divided his spare income between his aunt and himself, and had come to Paris resolutely determined to live within the L200 a year which remained to his share.  He felt the revolution in his whole being that commenced when out of sight of the petty principality in which he was the object of that feudal reverence, still surviving in the more unfrequented parts of Bretagne, for the representatives of illustrious names connected with the immemorial legends of the province.  The very bustle of a railway, with its crowd and quickness and unceremonious democracy of travel, served to pain and confound and humiliate that sense of individual dignity in which he had been nurtured. He felt that, once away from Rochebriant, he was but a cipher in the sum of human beings.  Arrived at Paris, and reaching the gloomy hotel to which he had been recommended, he greeted even the desolation of that solitude which is usually so oppressive to a stranger in the metropolis of his native land.  Loneliness was better than the loss of self in the reek and pressure of an unfamiliar throng.  For the first few days he had wandered over Paris without calling even on the 'avoue' to whom M. Hebert had directed him.  He felt with the instinctive acuteness of a mind which, under sounder training, would have achieved no mean distinction, that it was a safe precaution to imbue himself with the atmosphere of the place, and seize on those general ideas which in great capitals are so contagious that they are often more accurately caught by the first impressions than by subsequent habit, before he brought his mind into collision with those of the individuals he had practically to deal with.  At last he repaired to the 'avoue,' M. Gandrin, Rue St. Florentin.  He had mechanically formed his idea of the abode and person of an 'avoue' from his association with M. Hebert.  He expected to find a dull house in a dull street near the centre of business, remote from the haunts of idlers, and a grave man of unpretending exterior and matured years.  He arrived at a hotel newly fronted, richly decorated, in the fashionable quartier close by the Tuileries.  He entered a wide 'porte cochere,' and was directed by the concierge to mount 'au premier.'  There, first detained in an office faultlessly neat, with spruce young men at smart desks, he was at length admitted into a noble salon, and into the presence of a gentleman lounging in an easy-chair before a magnificent bureau of 'marqueterie, genre Louis Seize,' engaged in patting a white curly lapdog, with a pointed nose and a shrill bark.  The gentleman rose politely on his entrance, and released the dog, who, after sniffing the Marquis, condescended not to bite.  \"Monsieur le Marquis,\" said M. Gandrin, glancing at the card and the introductory note from M. Hebert, which Alain had sent in, and which lay on the 'secretaire' beside heaps of letters nicely arranged and labelled, \"charmed to make the honour of your acquaintance; just arrived at Paris? So M. Hebert--a very worthy person whom I have never seen, but with whom I have had correspondence--tells me you wish for my advice; in fact, he wrote to me some days ago, mentioning the business in question,-- consolidation of mortgages.  A very large sum wanted, Monsieur le Marquis, and not to be had easily.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said Alain, quietly, \"I should imagine that there must be many capitalists in Paris willing to invest in good securities at fair interest.\"  \"You are mistaken, Marquis; very few such capitalists.  Men worth money nowadays like quick returns and large profits, thanks to the magnificent system of 'Credit Mobilier,' in which, as you are aware, a man may place his money in any trade or speculation without liabilities beyond his share.  Capitalists are nearly all traders or speculators.\"  \"Then,\" said the Marquis, half rising, \"I am to presume, sir, that you are not likely to assist me.\"  \"No, I don't say that, Marquis.  I will look with care into the matter. Doubtless you have with you an abstract of the, necessary documents, the conditions"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7737"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 01 (#6)"],["body"," the present mortgages, the rental of the estate, its probable prospects, and so forth.\"  \"Sir, I have such an abstract with me at Paris; and having gone into it myself with M. Hebert, I can pledge you my word that it is strictly faithful to the facts.\"  The Marquis said this with naive simplicity, as if his word were quite sufficient to set that part of the question at rest.  M. Gandrin smiled politely and said, \"'Eh bien,' M. le Marquis: favour me with the abstract; in a week's time you shall have my opinion.  You enjoy Paris? Greatly improved under the Emperor.  'Apropos,' Madame Gandrin receives tomorrow evening; allow me that opportunity to present you to her.\" Unprepared for the proffered hospitality, the Marquis had no option but to murmur his gratification and assent.  In a minute more he was in the streets.  The next evening he went to Madame Gandrin's,--a brilliant reception,--a whole moving flower-bed of \"decorations\" there.  Having gone through the ceremony of presentation to Madame Gandrin,--a handsome woman dressed to perfection, and conversing with the secretary to an embassy,--the young noble ensconced himself in an obscure and quiet corner, observing all and imagining that he escaped observation.  And as the young men of his own years glided by him, or as their talk reached his ears, he became aware that from top to toe, within and without, he was old-fashioned, obsolete, not of his race, not of his day.  His rank itself seemed to him a waste-paper title-deed to a heritage long lapsed.  Not thus the princely seigneurs of Rochebriant made their 'debut' at the capital of their nation.  They had had the 'entree' to the cabinets of their kings; they had glittered in the halls of Versailles; they had held high posts of distinction in court and camp; the great Order of St. Louis had seemed their hereditary appanage.  His father, though a voluntary exile in manhood, had been in childhood a king's page, and throughout life remained the associate of princes; and here, in an 'avoue's soiree,' unknown, unregarded, an expectant on an 'avoue's' patronage, stood the last lord of Rochebriant.  It is easy to conceive that Alain did not stay long.  But he stayed long enough to convince him that on L200 a year the polite society of Paris, even as seen at M. Gandrin's, was not for him.  Nevertheless, a day or two after, he resolved to call upon the nearest of his kinsmen to whom his aunt had given him letters.  With the Count de Vandemar, one of his fellow-nobles of the sacred Faubourg, he should be no less Rochebriant, whether in a garret or a palace.  The Vandemars, in fact, though for many generations before the First Revolution a puissant and brilliant family, had always recognized the Rochebriants as the head of their house,--the trunk from which they had been slipped in the fifteenth century, when a younger son of the Rochebriants married a wealthy heiress and took the title with the lands of Vandemar.  Since then the two families had often intermarried.  The present count had a reputation for ability, was himself a large proprietor, and might furnish advice to guide Alain in his negotiations with M. Gandrin.  The Hotel do Vandemar stood facing the old Hotel de Rochebriant; it was less spacious, but not less venerable, gloomy, and prison-like.  As he turned his eyes from the armorial scutcheon which still rested, though chipped and mouldering, over the portals of his lost ancestral house, and was about to cross the street, two young men, who seemed two or three years older than himself, emerged on horseback from the Hotel de Vandemar.  Handsome young men, with the lofty look of the old race, dressed with the punctilious care of person which is not foppery in men of birth, but seems part of the self-respect that appertains to the old chivalric point of honour.  The horse of one of these cavaliers made a caracole which brought it nearly upon Alain as he was about to cross.  The rider, checking his steed, lifted his hat to Alain and uttered a word of apology in the courtesy of ancient high-breeding, but still with condescension as to an inferior.  This little incident, and the slighting kind of notice received from coevals of his own birth, and doubtless his own blood,--for he divined truly that they were the sons of the Count de Vandemar,-- disconcerted Alain to a degree which perhaps a Frenchman alone can comprehend.  He had even half a mind to give up his visit and turn back. However, his native manhood prevailed over that morbid sensitiveness which, born out of the union of pride and poverty, has all the effects of vanity, and yet is not vanity itself.  The Count was at home, a thin spare man with a narrow but high forehead, and an expression of countenance keen, severe, and 'un peu moqueuse.'  He received the Marquis, however, at first with great cordiality, kissed him on both sides of his cheek, called him \"cousin,\" expressed immeasurable regret that the Countess was gone out on one of the missions of charity in which the great ladies of the Faubourg religiously interest themselves, and that his sons had just ridden forth to the Bois.  As Alain, however, proceeded, simply and without false shame, to communicate the object of his visit at Paris, the extent of his liabilities, and the penury of his means, the smile vanished from the Count's face.  He somewhat drew back his fauteuil in the movement common to men who wish to estrange themselves from some other man's difficulties; and when Alain came to a close, the Count remained some moments seized with a slight cough; and, gazing intently on the carpet, at length he said, \"My dear young friend, your father behaved extremely ill to you,--dishonourably, fraudulently.\"  \"Hold!\" said the Marquis, colouring high.  \"Those are words no man can apply to my father in my presence.\"  The Count stared, shrugged his shoulders, and replied with 'sang froid,' \"Marquis, if you are contented with your father's conduct, of course it is no business of mine: he never injured me.  I presume, however, that, considering my years and my character, you come to me for advice: is it so?\"  Alain bowed his head in assent.  \"There are four courses for one in your position to take,\" said the Count, placing the index of the right hand successively on the thumb and three fingers of the left,--\"four courses, and no more.  \"First.  To do as your notary recommended: consolidate your mortgages, patch up your income as you best can, return to Rochebriant, and devote the rest of your existence to the preservation of your property.  By that course your life will be one of permanent privation, severe struggle; and the probability is that you will not succeed: there will come one or two bad seasons, the farmers will fail to pay, the mortgagee will foreclose, and you may find yourself, after twenty years of anxiety and torment, prematurely old and without a sou.  \"Course the second.  Rochebriant, though so heavily encumbered as to yield you some such income as your father gave to his chef de cuisine, is still one of those superb 'terres' which bankers and Jews and stock- jobbers court and hunt after, for which they will give enormous sums. If you place it in good hands, I do not doubt that you could dispose of the property within three months, on terms that would leave you a considerable surplus, which, invested with judgment, would afford you whereon you could live at Paris in a way suitable to your rank and age. Need we go further?--does this course smile to you?\"  \"Pass on, Count; I will defend to the last what I take from my ancestors, and cannot voluntarily sell their roof-tree and their tombs.\"  \"Your name would still remain, and you would be just as well received in Paris, and your 'noblesse' just as implicitly conceded, if all Judaea encamped upon Rochebriant.  Consider how few of us 'gentilshommes' of the old regime have any domains left to us.  Our names alone survive: no revolution can efface them.\"  \"It may be so, but pardon me; there are subjects on which we cannot reason,--we can but feel.  Rochebriant may be torn from me, but I cannot yield it.\"  \"I proceed to the third course.  Keep the chateau and give up its traditions; remain 'de facto' Marquis of Rochebriant, but accept the new order of things.  Make yourself known to the people in power.  They will be charmed to welcome you a convert from the old noblesse is a guarantee of stability to the new system.  You will be placed in diplomacy; effloresce into an ambassador, a minister,--and ministers nowadays have opportunities to become enormously rich.\"  \"That course is not less impossible than the last.  Till Henry V. formally resign his right to the throne of Saint Louis, I can be servant to no other man seated on that throne.\"  \"Such, too, is my creed,\" said the Count, \"and I cling to it; but my estate is not mortgaged, and I have neither the tastes nor the age for public employments.  The last course is perhaps better than the rest; at all events it is the easiest.  A wealthy marriage; even if it must be a 'mesalliance.'  I think at your age, with your appearance, that your name is worth at least two million francs in the eyes of a rich 'roturier' with an ambitious daughter.\"  \"Alas!\" said the young man, rising, \"I see I shall have to go back to Rochebriant.  I cannot sell my castle, I cannot sell my creed, and I cannot sell my name and myself.\"  \"The last all of us did in the old 'regime,' Marquis.  Though I still retain the title of Vandemar, my property comes from the Farmer-General's daughter, whom my great-grandfather, happily for us, married in the days of Louis Quinze.  Marriages with people of sense and rank have always been 'marriages de convenance' in France.  It is only in 'le petit monde' that men having nothing marry girls having nothing, and I don't believe they are a bit the happier for it.  On the contrary, the 'quarrels de menage' leading to frightful crimes appear by the 'Gazette des Tribunaux' to be chiefly"]]]
