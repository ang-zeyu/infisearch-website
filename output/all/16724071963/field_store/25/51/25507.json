Dost thou think that Lord Hastings, the vain, the dissolute--\"  \"Cease, sir!\" said Sibyll, proudly;  \"me reprove if thou wilt, but lower not my esteem for thee by slander against another!\"  \"What!\" said Alwyn, bitterly; \"doth even one word of counsel chafe thee?  I tell thee that if thou dreamest that Lord Hastings loves Sibyll Warner as man loves the maiden he would wed, thou deceivest thyself to thine own misery.  If thou wouldst prove it, go to him now,--go and say, 'Wilt thou give me that home of peace and honour, that shelter for my father's old age under a son's roof which the trader I despise proffers me in vain?\"  \"If it were already proffered me--by him?\" said Sibyll, in a low voice, and blushing deeply.  Alwyn started.  \"Then I wronged him; and--and--\" he added generously, though with a faint sickness at his heart, \"I can yet be happy in thinking thou art so.  Farewell, maiden, the saints guard thee from one memory of regret at what hath passed between us!\"  He pulled his bonnet hastily over his brows, and departed with unequal and rapid strides.  As he passed the spot where Hastings stood leaning his arm upon the wall, and his face upon his hand, the nobleman looked up, and said,--  \"Well, Sir Goldsmith, own at least that thy trial hath been a fair one!\" Then struck with the anguish written upon Alwyn's face, he walked up to him, and, with a frank, compassionate impulse, laid his hand on his shoulder.  \"Alwyn,\" he said, \"I have felt what you feel now; I have survived it, and the world hath not prospered with me less!  Take with you a compassion that respects, and does not degrade you.\"  \"Do not deceive her, my lord,--she trusts and loves you!  You never deceived man,--the wide world says it,--do not deceive woman!  Deeds kill men, words women!\"  Speaking thus simply, Alwyn strode on, and vanished.  Hastings slowly and silently advanced to Sibyll.  Her rejection of Alwyn had by no means tended to reconcile him to the marriage he himself had proffered.  He might well suppose that the girl, even if unguided by affection, would not hesitate between a mighty nobleman and an obscure goldsmith.  His pride was sorely wounded that the latter should have even thought himself the equal of one whom he had proposed, though but in a passionate impulse, to raise to his own state.  And yet as he neared Sibyll, and, with a light footstep, she sprang forward to meet him, her eyes full of sweet joy and confidence, he shrank from an avowal which must wither up a heart opening thus all its bloom of youth and love to greet him.  \"Ah, fair lord,\" said the maiden, \"was it kindly in thee to permit poor Alwyn to inflict on me so sharp a pain, and thou to stand calmly distant?  Sure, alas! that had thy humble rival proffered a crown, it had been the same to Sibyll!  Oh, how the grief it was mine to cause grieved me; and yet, through all, I had one selfish, guilty gleam of pleasure,--to think that I had not been loved so well, if I were all unworthy the sole love I desire or covet!\"  \"And yet, Sibyll, this young man can in all, save wealth and a sounding name, give thee more than I can,--a heart undarkened by moody memories, a temper unsoured by the world's dread and bitter lore of man's frailty and earth's sorrow.  Ye are not far separated by ungenial years, and might glide to a common grave hand in hand; but I, older in heart than in age, am yet so far thine elder in the last, that these hairs will be gray, and this form bent, while thy beauty is in its prime, and--but thou weepest!\"  \"I weep that thou shouldst bring one thought of time to sadden my thoughts, which are of eternity.  Love knows no age, it foresees no grave! its happiness and its trust behold on the earth but one glory, melting into the hues of heaven, where they who love lastingly pass calmly on to live forever!  See, I weep not now!\"  \"And did not this honest burgher,\" pursued Hastings, softened and embarrassed, but striving to retain his cruel purpose, \"tell thee to distrust me; tell thee that my vows were false?\"  \"Methinks, if an angel told me so, I should disbelieve!\"  \"Why, look thee, Sibyll, suppose his warning true; suppose that at this hour I sought thee with intent to say that that destiny which ambition weaves for itself forbade me to fulfil a word hotly spoken; that I could not wed thee,--should I not seem to thee a false wooer, a poor trifler with thy earnest heart; and so, couldst thou not recall the love of him whose truer and worthier homage yet lingers in thine ear, and with him be happy?\"  Sibyll lifted her dark eyes, yet humid, upon the unrevealing face of the speaker, and gazed on him with wistful and inquiring sadness; then, shrinking from his side, she crossed her arms meekly on her bosom, and thus said,--  \"If ever, since we parted, one such thought hath glanced across thee-- one thought of repentance at the sacrifice of pride, or the lessening of power--which (she faltered, broke off the sentence, and resumed)-- in one word, if thou wouldst retract, say it now, and I will not accuse thy falsehood, but bless thy truth.\"  \"Thou couldst be consoled, then, by thy pride of woman, for the loss of an unworthy lover?\"  \"My lord, are these questions fair?\"  Hastings was silent.  The gentler part of his nature struggled severely with the harder.  The pride of Sibyll moved him no less than her trust; and her love in both was so evident, so deep, so exquisitely contrasting the cold and frivolous natures amidst which his lot had fallen, that he recoiled from casting away forever a heart never to be replaced.  Standing on that bridge of life, with age before and youth behind, he felt that never again could he be so loved, or, if so loved by one so worthy of whatever of pure affection, of young romance, was yet left to his melancholy and lonely soul.  He took her hand, and, as she felt its touch, her firmness forsook her, her head drooped upon her bosom, and she burst into an agony of tears.  \"Oh, Sibyll, forgive me!  Smile on me again, Sibyll!\" exclaimed Hastings, subdued and melted.  But, alas! the heart once bruised and galled recovers itself but slowly, and it was many minutes before the softest words the eloquent lover could shape to sound sufficed to dry those burning tears, and bring back the enchanting smile,--nay, even then the smile was forced and joyless.  They walked on for some moments, both in thought, till Hastings said: \"Thou lovest me, Sibyll, and art worthy of all the love that man can feel for maid; and yet, canst thou solve me this question, nor chide me that I ask it, Dost thou not love the world and the world's judgments more than me?  What is that which women call honour?  What makes them shrink from all love that takes not the form and circumstance of the world's hollow rites? Does love cease to be love, unless over its wealth of trust and emotion the priest mouths his empty blessing?  Thou in thy graceful pride art angered if I, in wedding thee, should remember the sacrifice which men like me--I own it fairly--deem as great as man can make; and yet thou wouldst fly my love if it wooed thee to a sacrifice of thine own.\"  Artfully was the question put, and Hastings smiled to himself in imagining the reply it must bring; and then Sibyll answered, with the blush which the very subject called forth,  \"Alas, my lord, I am but a poor casuist, but I feel that if I asked thee to forfeit whatever men respect,--honour and repute for valour, to be traitor and dastard,--thou couldst love me no more; and marvel you if, when man woos woman to forfeit all that her sex holds highest,--to be in woman what dastard and traitor is in man,--she hears her conscience and her God speak in a louder voice than can come from a human lip?  The goods and pomps of the world we are free to sacrifice, and true love heeds and counts them not; but true love cannot sacrifice that which makes up love,--it cannot sacrifice the right to be loved below; the hope to love on in the realm above; the power to pray with a pure soul for the happiness it yearns to make; the blessing to seem ever good and honoured in the eyes of the one by whom alone it would be judged.  And therefore, sweet lord, true love never contemplates this sacrifice; and if once it believes itself truly loved, it trusts with a fearless faith in the love on which it leans.\"  \"Sibyll, would to Heaven I had seen thee in my youth!  Would to Heaven I were more worthy of thee!\" And in that interview Hastings had no heart to utter what he had resolved, \"Sibyll, I sought thee but to say Farewell.\"     CHAPTER VI.  WARWICK RETURNS--APPEASES A DISCONTENTED PRINCE--AND CONFERS WITH A REVENGEFUL CONSPIRATOR.  It was not till late in the evening that Warwick arrived at his vast residence in London, where he found not only Marmaduke Nevile ready to receive him, but a more august expectant, in George Duke of Clarence. Scarcely had the earl crossed the threshold, when the duke seized his arm, and leading him into the room that adjoined the hall, said,--  \"Verily, Edward is besotted no less than ever by his wife's leech-like family.  Thou knowest my appointment to the government of Ireland; Isabel, like myself, cannot endure the subordinate vassalage we must brook at the court, with the queen's cold looks and sour words.  Thou knowest, also, with what vain pretexts Edward has put me of; and now, this very day, he tells me that he hath changed his humour,--that I am not stern enough for the Irish kernes; that he loves me too well to banish me, forsooth; and that Worcester, the people's butcher but the queen's favourite, must have the post so sacredly pledged to me.  I see in this Elizabeth's crafty malice.  Is this struggle between king's blood and queen's kith to go on forever?\"  \"Calm thyself, George; I will confer with the king tomorrow, and hope to compass thy not too arrogant desire.  Certes, a king's brother is the fittest "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7722"],["title","The Last of the Barons — Volume 08 (#8)"],["body","vice-king for the turbulent kernes of Ireland, who are ever flattered into obeisance by ceremony and show.  The government was pledged to thee--Edward can scarcely be serious.  Moreover, Worcester, though forsooth a learned man--Mort-Dieu! methinks that same learning fills the head to drain the heart!--is so abhorred for his cruelties that his very landing in Ireland will bring a new rebellion to add to our already festering broils and sores.  Calm thyself, I say.  Where didst thou leave Isabel?\"  \"With my mother.\"  \"And Anne?--the queen chills not her young heart with cold grace?\"  \"Nay, the queen dare not unleash her malice against Edward's will; and, to do him justice, he hath shown all honour to Lord Warwick's daughter.\"  \"He is a gallant prince, with all his faults,\" said the father, heartily, \"and we must bear with him, George; for verily he hath bound men by a charm to love him.  Stay thou and share my hasty repast, and over the wine we will talk of thy views.  Spare me now for a moment; I have to prepare work eno' for a sleepless night.  This Lincolnshire rebellion promises much trouble.  Lord Willoughby has joined it; more than twenty thousand men are in arms.  I have already sent to convene the knights and barons on whom the king can best depend, and must urge their instant departure for their halls, to raise men and meet the foe.  While Edward feasts, his minister must toil.  Tarry a while till I return.\"  The earl re-entered the hall, and beckoned to Marmaduke, who stood amongst a group of squires.  \"Follow me; I may have work for thee.\"  Warwick took a taper from one of the servitors, and led the way to his own more private apartment. On the landing of the staircase, by a small door, stood his body- squire--\"Is the prisoner within?\"  \"Yes, my lord.\"  \"Good!\"--The earl opened the door by which the squire had mounted guard, and bade Marmaduke wait without.  The inmate of the chamber, whose dress bore the stains of fresh travel and hard riding, lifted his face hastily as the earl entered.  \"Robin Hilyard,\" said Warwick, \"I have mused much how to reconcile my service to the king with the gratitude I owe to a man who saved me from great danger.  In the midst of thy unhappy and rebellious designs thou wert captured and brought to me; the papers found on thee attest a Lancastrian revolt, so ripening towards a mighty gathering, and so formidable from the adherents whom the gold and intrigues of King Louis have persuaded to risk land and life for the Red Rose, that all the king's friends can do to save his throne is now needed.  In this revolt thou hast been the scheming brain, the master hand, the match to the bombard, the fire brand to the flax.  Thou smilest, man!  Alas! seest thou not that it is my stern duty to send thee bound hand and foot before the king's council, for the brake to wring from thee thy guilty secrets, and the gibbet to close thy days?\"  \"I am prepared,\" said Hilyard; \"when the bombard explodes, the match has become useless; when the flame smites the welkin, the firebrand is consumed!\"  \"Bold man! what seest thou in this rebellion that can profit thee?\"  \"I see, looming through the chasms and rents made in the feudal order by civil war, the giant image of a free people.\"  \"And thou wouldst be a martyr for the multitude, who deserted thee at Olney?\"  \"As thou for the king who dishonoured thee at Shene!\"  Warwick frowned, and there was a moment's pause; at last, said the earl: \"Look you, Robin, I would fain not have on my hands the blood of a man who saved my life.  I believe thee, though a fanatic and half madman,--I believe thee true in word as rash of deed.  Swear to me on the cross of this dagger that thou wilt lay aside all scheme and plot for this rebellion, all aid and share in civil broil and dissension, and thy life and liberty are restored to thee.  In that intent, I have summoned my own kinsman, Marmaduke Nevile.  He waits without the door; he shall conduct thee safely to the seashore; thou shalt gain in peace my government of Calais, and my seneschal there shall find thee all thou canst need,--meat for thy hunger and moneys for thy pastime. Accept my mercy, take the oath, and begone.\"  \"My lord,\" answered Hilyard, much touched and affected, \"blame not thyself if this carcass feed the crows--my blood be on mine own head! I cannot take this oath; I cannot live in peace; strife and broil are grown to me food and drink.  Oh, my lord! thou knowest not what dark and baleful memories made me an agent in God's hand against this ruthless Edward!\" and then passionately, with whitening lips and convulsive features, Hilyard recounted to the startled Warwick the same tale which had roused the sympathy of Adam Warner.  The earl, whose affections were so essentially homely and domestic, was even more shocked than the scholar by the fearful narrative.  \"Unhappy man!\" he said with moistened eyes, \"from the core of my heart I pity thee.  But thou, the scathed sufferer from civil war, wilt thou be now its dread reviver?\"  \"If Edward had wronged thee, great earl, as me, poor franklin, what would be thine answer?  In vain moralize to him whom the spectre of a murdered child and the shriek of a maniac wife haunt and hound on to vengeance!  So send me to rack and halter.  Be there one curse more on the soul of Edward!\"  \"Thou shalt not die through my witness,\" said the earl, abruptly; and he quitted the chamber.  Securing the door by a heavy bolt on the outside, he gave orders to his squire to attend to the comforts of the prisoner; and then turning into his closet with Marmaduke, said: \"I sent for thee, young cousin, with design to commit to thy charge one whose absence from England I deemed needful--that design I must abandon.  Go back to the palace, and see, if thou canst, the king before he sleeps; say that this rising in Lincolnshire is more than a riot,--it is the first burst of a revolution! that I hold council here to-night, and every shire, ere the morrow, shall have its appointed captain.  I will see the king at morning.  Yet stay--gain sight of my child Anne; she will leave the court to-morrow.  I will come for her; bid her train be prepared; she and the countess must away to Calais,--England again hath ceased to be a home for women!  What to do with this poor rebel?\" muttered the earl, when alone; \"release him I cannot; slay him I will not.  Hum, there is space enough in these walls to inclose a captive.\"     CHAPTER VII.  THE FEAR AND THE FLIGHT.  King Edward feasted high, and Sibyll sat in her father's chamber,--she silent with thought of love, Adam silent in the toils of science.  The Eureka was well-nigh finished, rising from its ruins more perfect, more elaborate, than before.  Maiden and scholar, each seeming near to the cherished goal,--one to love's genial altar, the other to fame's lonely shrine.  Evening advanced, night began, night deepened.  King Edward's feast was over, but still in his perfumed chamber the wine sparkled in the golden cup.  It was announced to him that Sir Marmaduke Nevile, just arrived from the earl's house, craved an audience.  The king, pre- occupied in deep revery, impatiently postponed it till the morrow.  \"To-morrow,\" said the gentleman in attendance, \"Sir Marmaduke bids me say, fearful that the late hour would forbid his audience, that Lord Warwick himself will visit your Grace.  I fear, sire, that the disturbances are great indeed, for the squires and gentlemen in Lady Anne's train have orders to accompany her to Calais to-morrow.\"  \"To-morrow, to-morrow!\" repeated the king--\"well, sir, you are dismissed.\"  The Lady Anne (to whom Sibyll had previously communicated the king's kindly consideration for Master Warner) had just seen Marmaduke, and learned the new dangers that awaited the throne and the realm.  The Lancastrians were then openly in arms for the prince of her love, and against her mighty father!  The Lady Anne sat a while, sorrowful and musing, and then, before yon crucifix, the Lady Anne knelt in prayer.  Sir Marmaduke Nevile descends to the court below, and some three or four busy, curious gentlemen, not yet a-bed, seize him by the arm, and pray him to say what storm is in the wind.  The night deepened still.  The wine is drained in King Edward's goblet; King Edward has left his chamber; and Sibyll, entreating her father, but in vain, to suspend his toil, has kissed the damps from his brow, and is about to retire to her neighbouring room.  She has turned to the threshold, when, hark! a faint--a distant cry, a woman's shriek, the noise of a clapping door!  The voice--it is the voice of Anne!  Sibyll passed the threshold, she is in the corridor; the winter moon shines through the open arches, the air is white and cold with frost. Suddenly the door at the farther end is thrown wide open, a form rushes into the corridor, it passes Sibyll, halts, turns round. \"Oh, Sibyll!\"  cried the Lady Anne, in a voice wild with horror, \"save me--aid--help!  Merciful Heaven, the king!\"  Instinctively, wonderingly, tremblingly, Sibyll drew Anne into the chamber she had just quitted, and as they gained its shelter, as Anne sank upon the floor, the gleam of cloth-of-gold flashed through the dim atmosphere, and Edward, yet in the royal robe in which he had dazzled all the eyes at his kingly feast, stood within the chamber. His countenance was agitated with passion, and its clear hues flushed red with wine.  At his entrance Anne sprang from the floor, and rushed to Warner, who, in dumb bewilderment, had suspended his task, and stood before the Eureka, from which steamed and rushed the dark, rapid smoke, while round and round, labouring and groaning, rolled its fairy wheels.  [The gentle reader will doubtless bear in mind that Master Warner's complicated model had but little resemblance to the models of the steam-engine in our own day, and that it was usually connected with other contrivances, for the better display of the principle it was intended to"]]]
