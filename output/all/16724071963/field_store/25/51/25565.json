Louvier can put, and has put, a great deal of money into M. Gandrin's pocket.  The purchaser of your wood does not pay more than his deposit, and has just left the country insolvent.  Your purchaser, M. Collot, was an adventurous speculator; he would have bought anything at any price, provided he had time to pay; if his speculations had been lucky he would have paid. M. Louvier knew, as I knew, that M. Collot was a gambler, and the chances were that he would not pay.  M. Louvier allows a year's interest on his hypotheque to become due-notice thereof duly given to you by his agent-- now you come under the operation of the law.  Of course, you know what the law is?\"  \"Not exactly,\" answered Alain, feeling frostbitten by the congealing words of his counsellor; \"but I take it for granted that if I cannot pay the interest of a sum borrowed on my property, that property itself is forfeited.\"  \"No, not quite that--the law is mild.  If the interest which should be paid half-yearly remains unpaid at the end of a year, the mortgagee has a right to be impatient, has he not?\"  \"Certainly he has.\"  \"Well, then, _on fait un commandement tendant de saisie immobiliere_, viz: The mortgagee gives a notice that the property shall be put up for sale.  Then it is put up for sale, and in most cases the mortgagee buys it in.  Here, certainly, no competitors in the mere business way would vie with Louvier; the mortgage at three and a half per cent. covers more than the estate is apparently worth.  Ah! but stop, M. le Marquis; the notice is not yet served: the whole process would take six months from the day it is served to the taking possession after the sale; in the meanwhile, if you pay the interest due, the action drops.  Courage, M. le Marquis!  Hope yet, if you condescend to call me friend.\"  \"And me,\" cried Lemercier; \"I will sell out of my railway shares to- morrow-see to it, Duplessis--enough to pay off the damnable interest. See to it, _mon ami_.\"  \"Agree to that, M. le Marquis, and you are safe for another year,\" said Duplessis, folding up the paper on which he had made his notes, but fixing on Alain quiet eyes half concealed under drooping lids.  \"Agree to that!\" cried Rochebriant, rising--\"agree to allow even my worst enemy to pay for me moneys I could never hope to repay--agree to allow the oldest and most confiding friends to do so--M. Duplessis, never! If I carried the porter's knot of an Auverguat, I should still remain gentilhomme and Breton.\"  Duplessis, habitually the driest of men, rose with a moistened eye and flushing cheek--\"Monsieur le Marquis, vouchsafe me the honour to shake hands with you.  I, too, am by descent gentilhomme, by profession a speculator on the Bourse.  In both capacities I approve the sentiment you have uttered.  Certainly, if our friend Frederic lent you 7000 Louis or so this year, it would be impossible for you even to foresee the year in which you could repay it; but,\"--here Duplessis paused a minute, and then lowering the tone of his voice, which had been somewhat vehement and enthusiastic, into that of a colloquial good-fellowship, equally rare to the measured reserve of the financier, he asked, with a lively twinkle of his grey eye, \"Did you never hear, Marquis, of a little encounter between me and M. Louvier?\"  \"Encounter at arms--does Louvier fight?\" asked Alain, innocently.  \"In his own way he is always fighting; but I speak metaphorically.  You see this small house of mine--so pinched in by the houses next to it that I can neither get space for a ball-room for Valerie, nor a dining-room for more than a friendly party like that which has honoured me to-day. _Eh bien_!  I bought this house a few years ago, meaning to buy the one next to it and throw the two into one.  I went to the proprietor of the next house, who, as I knew, wished to sell.  'Aha,' he thought, 'this is the rich Monsieur Duplessis;' and he asked me 2000 louis more than the house was worth.  We men of business cannot bear to be too much cheated; a little cheating we submit to--much cheating raises our gall. _Bref_-- this was on Monday.  I offered the man 1000 louis above the fair price, and gave him till Thursday to decide.  Somehow or other Louvier hears of this.  'Hillo!' says Louvier, 'here is a financier who desires a hotel to vie with mine!'  He goes on Wednesday to my next-door neighbour. 'Friend, you want to sell your house.  I want to buy--the price?'  The proprietor, who does not know him by sight, says: 'It is as good as sold. M. Duplessis and I shall agree.'  'Bah!  What sum did you ask M. Duplessis?'  He names the sum; 2000 louis more than he can get elsewhere. 'But M. Duplessis will give me the sum.'  'You ask too little.  I will give 3000.  A fig for M. Duplessis.  I am Monsieur Louvier.'  So when I call on Thursday the house is sold.  I reconcile myself easily enough to the loss of space for a larger dining-room; but though Valerie was then a child at a convent, I was sadly disconcerted by the thought that I could have no _salle de bal_ ready for her when she came to reside with me. Well, I say to myself, patience; I owe M. Louvier a good turn; my time to pay him off will come.  It does come, and very soon.  M. Louvier buys an estate near Paris--builds a superb villa.  Close to his property is a rising forest ground for sale.  He goes to the proprietor: says the proprietor to himself, 'The great Louvier wants this,' and adds 5000 louis to its market price.  Louvier, like myself, can't bear to be cheated egregiously.  Louvier offers 2000 louis more than the man could fairly get, and leaves him till Saturday to consider.  I hear of this-- speculators hear of everything.  On Friday night I go to the man and I give him 6000 louis, where he had asked 5000.  Fancy Louvier's face the next day!  But there my revenge only begins,\" continued Duplessis, chuckling inwardly.  \"My forest looks down on the villa he is building. I only wait till his villa is built, in order to send to my architect and say, Build me a villa at least twice as grand as M. Louvier's, then clear away the forest trees, so that every morning he may see my palace dwarfing into insignificance his own.\"  \"Bravo!\" cried Lemercier, clapping his hands.  Lemercier had the spirit of party, and felt for Duplessis against Louvier much as in England Whig feels against Tory, or vice versa.  \"Perhaps now,\" resumed Duplessis, more soberly,--\"perhaps now, M. le Marquis, you may understand why I humiliate you by no sense of obligation if I say that M. Louvier shall not be the Seigneur de Rochebriant if I can help it.  Give me a line of introduction to your Breton lawyer and to Mademoiselle your aunt--let me have your letters early to-morrow.  I will take the afternoon train.  I know not how many days I may be absent, but I shall not return till I have carefully examined the nature and conditions of your property.  If I see my way to save your estate, and give a _mauvais quart d'heure_ to Louvier, so much the better for you, M. le Marquis; if I cannot, I will say frankly, 'Make the best terms you can with your creditor.'\"  \"Nothing can be more delicately generous than the way you put it,\" said Alain; \"but pardon me, if I say that the pleasantry with which you narrate your grudge against M. Louvier does not answer its purpose in diminishing my sense of obligation.\"  So, linking his arm in Lemercier's, Alain made his bow and withdrew.  When his guests had gone, Duplessis remained seated in meditation-- apparently pleasant meditation, for he smiled while indulging it; he then passed through the reception-rooms to one at the far end appropriated to Valerie as a boudoir or morning-room, adjoining her bed-chamber; he knocked gently at the door, and, all remaining silent within, he opened it noiselessly and entered.  Valerie was reclining on the sofa near the window-her head drooping, her hands clasped on her knees.  Duplessis neared her with tender stealthy steps, passed his arm round her, and drew her head towards his bosom.  \"Child!\" he murmured; \"my child, my only one!\"  At that soft loving voice, Valerie flung her arms round him, and wept aloud like an infant in trouble.  He seated himself beside her, and wisely suffered her to weep on, till her passion had exhausted itself; he then said, half fondly, half chillingly: \"Have you forgotten our conversation only three days ago?  Have you forgotten that I then drew forth the secret of your heart?  Have you forgotten what I promised you in return for your confidence?  and a promise to you have I ever yet broken?\"  \"Father! father!  I am so wretched and so ashamed of myself for being wretched!  Forgive me.  No, I do not forget your promise; but who can promise to dispose of the heart of another?  and that heart will never be mine.  But bear with me a little, I shall soon recover.\"  \"Valerie, when I made you the promise you now think I cannot keep, I spoke only from that conviction of power to promote the happiness of a child which nature implants in the heart of parents; and it may be also from the experience of my own strength of will, since that which I have willed I have always won.  Now I speak on yet surer ground.  Before the year is out you shall be the beloved wife of Alain de Rochebriant.  Dry your tears and smile on me, Valerie.  If you will not see in me mother and father both, I have double love for you, motherless child of her who shared the poverty of my youth, and did not live to enjoy the wealth which I hold as a trust for that heir to mine all which she left me.\"  As this man thus spoke you would scarcely have recognized in him the old saturnine Duplessis, his countenance became so beautified by the one soft feeling which care and contest, ambition and money-seeking, had left unaltered in his heart.  Perhaps there is no country in which the love of parent and child, especially of father and daughter, is so strong as"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7744"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 08 (#7)"],["body"," is in France; even in the most arid soil, among the avaricious, even among the profligate, it forces itself into flower.  Other loves fade away: in the heart of the true Frenchman that parent love blooms to the last.  Valerie felt the presence of that love as a divine protecting guardianship.  She sank on her knees and covered his hand with grateful kisses.  \"Do not torture yourself, my child, with jealous fears of the fair Italian.  Her lot and Alain de Rochebriant's can never unite; and whatever you may think of their whispered converse, Alain's heart at this moment is too filled with anxious troubles to leave one spot in it accessible even to a frivolous gallantry.  It is for us to remove these troubles; and then, when he turns his eyes towards you, it will be with the gaze of one who beholds his happiness.  You do not weep now, Valerie!\"        PREFATORY NOTE.  (BY THE AUTHOR'S SON.)  The Parisians and Kenelm Chillingly were begun about the same time, and had their common origin in the same central idea.  That idea first found fantastic expression in The Coming Race; and the three books, taken together, constitute a special group distinctly apart from all the other works of their author.  The satire of his earlier novels is a protest against false social respectabilities; the humour of his later ones is a protest against the disrespect of social realities.  By the first he sought to promote social sincerity, and the free play of personal character; by the last, to encourage mutual charity and sympathy amongst all classes on whose interrelation depends the character of society itself.  But in these three books, his latest fictions, the moral purpose is more definite and exclusive.  Each of them is an expostulation against what seemed to him the perilous popularity of certain social and political theories, or a warning against the influence of certain intellectual tendencies upon individual character and national life.  This purpose, however, though common to the three fictions, is worked out in each of them by a different method.  The Coming Race is a work of pure fancy, and the satire of it is vague and sportive.  The outlines of a definite purpose are more distinctly drawn in Chillingly-a romance which has the source of its effect in a highly-wrought imagination.  The humour and pathos of Chillingly are of a kind incompatible with the design of The Parisians, which is a work of dramatised observation.  Chillingly is a romance; The Parisians is a Novel.  The subject of Chillingly is psychological; that of The Parisians is social.  The author's object in Chillingly being to illustrate the effects of \"modern ideas\" upon an individual character, he has confined his narrative to the biography of that one character. Hence the simplicity of plot and small number of dramatis personae; whereby the work gains in height and depth what it loses in breadth of surface.  The Parisians, on the contrary, is designed to illustrate the effect of \"modern ideas\" upon a whole community.  This novel is therefore panoramic in the profusion and variety of figures presented by it to the reader's imagination.  No exclusive prominence is vouchsafed to any of these figures.  All of them are drawn and coloured with an equal care, but by means of the bold broad touches necessary for their effective presentation on a canvas so large and so crowded.  Such figures are, indeed, but the component features of one great Form, and their actions only so many modes of one collective impersonal character-that of the Parisian Society of Imperial and Democratic France;-a character everywhere present and busy throughout the story, of which it is the real hero or heroine.  This society was doubtless selected for characteristic illustration as being the most advanced in the progress of \"modern ideas.\"  Thus, for a complete perception of its writer's fundamental purpose, The Parisians should be read in connection with Chillingly, and these two books in connection with The Coming Race.  It will then be perceived that, through the medium of alternate fancy, sentiment, and observation assisted by humour and passion, these three books (in all other respects so different from each other) complete the presentation of the same purpose under different aspects; and thereby constitute a group of fictions which claims a separate place of its own in any thoughtful classification of their author's works.  One last word to those who will miss from these pages the connecting and completing touches of the master's hand.  It may be hoped that such a disadvantage, though irreparable, is somewhat mitigated by the essential character of the work itself.  The aesthetic merit of this kind of novel is in the vivacity of a general effect produced by large swift strokes of character; and in such strokes, if they be by a great artist, force and freedom of style must still be apparent, even when they are left rough and unfinished.  Nor can any lack of final verbal correction much diminish the intellectual value which many of the more thoughtful passages of the present work derive from a long, keen, and practical study of political phenomena, guided by personal experience of public life, and enlightened by a large, instinctive knowledge of the human heart.  Such a belief is, at least, encouraged by the private communications spontaneously made, to him who expresses it, by persons of political experience and social position in France; who have acknowledged the general accuracy of the author's descriptions, and noticed the suggestive sagacity and penetration of his occasional comments on the circumstances and sentiments he describes."]]]
