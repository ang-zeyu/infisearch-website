He fizzes!  He does backflips and breaks the furniture! Science fiction needs Cory Doctorow!  Bruce Sterling Author, The Hacker Crackdown and Distraction  #  In the true spirit of Walt Disney, Doctorow has ripped a part of our common culture, mixed it with a brilliant story, and burned into our culture a new set of memes that will be with us for a generation at least.  Lawrence Lessig Author, The Future of Ideas  #  Cory Doctorow doesn't just write about the future - I think he lives there. Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom isn't just a really good read, it's also, like the best kind of fiction, a kind of guide book. See the Tomorrowland of Tomorrow today, and while you're there, why not drop by Frontierland, and the Haunted Mansion as well? (It's the Mansion that's the haunted heart of this book.) Cory makes me feel nostalgic for the future - a dizzying, yet rather pleasant sensation, as if I'm spiraling down the tracks of Space Mountain over and over again. Visit the Magic Kingdom and live forever!  Kelly Link Author, Stranger Things Happen  #  Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom is the most entertaining and exciting science fiction story I've read in the last few years. I love page- turners, especially when they are as unusual as this novel. I predict big things for Down and Out -- it could easily become a breakout genre- buster.  Mark Frauenfelder Contributing Editor, Wired Magazine  #  Imagine you woke up one day and Walt Disney had taken over the world. Not only that, but money's been abolished and somebody's developed the Cure for Death.  Welcome to the Bitchun Society--and make sure you're strapped in tight, because it's going to be a wild ride.  In a world where everyone's wishes can come true, one man returns to the original, crumbling city of dreams--Disney World.   Here in the spiritual center of the Bitchun Society he struggles to find and preserve the original, human face of the Magic Kingdom against the young, post-human and increasingly alien inheritors of the Earth.  Now that any experience can be simulated, human relationships become ever more fragile; and to Julius, the corny, mechanical ghosts of the Haunted Mansion have come to seem like a precious link to a past when we could tell the real from the simulated, the true from the false.  Cory Doctorow--cultural critic, Disneyphile, and ultimate Early Adopter --uses language with the reckless confidence of the Beat poets.  Yet behind the dazzling prose and vibrant characters lie ideas we should all pay heed to.  The future rushes on like a plummeting roller coaster, and it's hard to see where we're going.  But at least with this book Doctorow has given us a map of the park.  Karl Schroeder Author, Permanence  #  Cory Doctorow is the most interesting new SF writer I've come across in years.Ê He starts out at the point where older SF writers' speculations end.Ê It's a distinct pleasure to give him some Whuffie.  Rudy Rucker Author, Spaceland  #  Cory Doctorow rocks! I check his blog about ten times a day, because he's always one of the first to notice a major incursion from the social-technological-pop-cultural future, and his voice is a compelling vehicle for news from the future. Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom is about a world that is visible in its outlines today, if you know where to look, from reputation systems to peer-to-peer adhocracies. Doctorow knows where to look, and how to word-paint the rest of us into the picture.  Howard Rheingold Author, Smart Mobs  #  Doctorow is more than just a sick mind looking to twist the perceptions of those whose realities remain uncorrupted - though that should be enough recommendation to read his work. *Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom* is black comedic, sci-fi prophecy on the dangers of surrendering our consensual hallucination to the regime. Fun to read, but difficult to sleep afterwards.  Douglas Rushkoff Author of Cyberia and Media Virus!  #  \"Wow! Disney imagineering meets nanotechnology, the reputation economy, and Ray Kurzweil's transhuman future.  As much fun as Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, and as packed with mind bending ideas about social changes cascading from the frontiers of science.\"  Tim O'Reilly Publisher and Founder, O'Reilly and Associates  #  Doctorow has created a rich and exciting vision of the future, and then wrote a page-turner of a story in it.  I couldn't put the book down.  Bruce Schneier Author, Secrets and Lies  #  Cory Doctorow is one of our best new writers: smart, daring, savvy, entertaining, ambitious, plugged-in, and as good a guide to the wired world of the twenty-first century that stretches out before us as you're going to find.  Gardner Dozois Editor, Asimov's SF  #  Cory Doctorow's \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" tells a gripping, fast-paced story that hinges on thought-provoking extrapolation from today's technical realities. This is the sort of book that captures and defines the spirit of a turning point in human history when our tools remake ourselves and our world.  Mitch Kapor Founder, Lotus, Inc., co-founder Electronic Frontier Foundation  --  ======================= A note about this book: =======================  \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" is my first novel. It's an actual, no-foolin' words-on-paper book, published by the good people at Tor Books in New York City. You can buy this book in stores or online, by following links like this one:  http://www.craphound.com/down/buy.php  So, what's with this file? Good question.  I'm releasing the entire text of this book as a free, freely redistributable e-book. You can download it, put it on a P2P net, put it on your site, email it to a friend, and, if you're addicted to dead trees, you can even print it.  Why am I doing this thing? Well, it's a long story, but to shorten it up: first-time novelists have a tough row to hoe. Our publishers don't have a lot of promotional budget to throw at unknown factors like us. Mostly, we rise and fall based on word-of-mouth. I'm not bad at word-of- mouth. I have a blog, Boing Boing (http://boingboing.net), where I do a *lot* of word-of-mouthing. I compulsively tell friends and strangers about things that I like.  And telling people about stuff I like is *way*, *way* easier if I can just send it to 'em. Way easier.  What's more, P2P nets kick all kinds of ass. Most of the books, music and movies ever released are not available for sale, anywhere in the world. In the brief time that P2P nets have flourished, the ad-hoc masses of the Internet have managed to put just about *everything* online. What's more, they've done it for cheaper than any other archiving/revival effort ever. I'm a stone infovore and this kinda Internet mishegas gives me a serious frisson of futurosity.  Yeah, there are legal problems. Yeah, it's hard to figure out how people are gonna make money doing it. Yeah, there is a lot of social upheaval and a serious threat to innovation, freedom, business, and whatnot. It's your basic end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario, and as a science fiction writer, end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenaria are my stock-in- trade.  I'm especially grateful to my publisher, Tor Books (http://www.tor.com) and my editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden (http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite) for being hep enough to let me try out this experiment.

I never thought I'd live to see the day when Keep A-Movin' Dan would decide to deadhead until the heat death of the Universe.  Dan was in his second or third blush of youth when I first met him, sometime late-XXI. He was a rangy cowpoke, apparent 25 or so, all rawhide squint-lines and sunburned neck, boots worn thin and infinitely comfortable. I was in the middle of my Chem thesis, my fourth Doctorate, and he was taking a break from Saving the World, chilling on campus in Toronto and core-dumping for some poor Anthro major. We hooked up at the Grad Students' Union -- the GSU, or Gazoo for those who knew -- on a busy Friday night, spring-ish. I was fighting a coral-slow battle for a stool at the scratched bar, inching my way closer every time the press of bodies shifted, and he had one of the few seats, surrounded by a litter of cigarette junk and empties, clearly encamped.  Some duration into my foray, he cocked his head at me and raised a sun- bleached eyebrow. \"You get any closer, son, and we're going to have to get a pre-nup.\"  I was apparent forty or so, and I thought about bridling at being called son, but I looked into his eyes and decided that he had enough realtime that he could call me son anytime he wanted. I backed off a little and apologized.  He struck a cig and blew a pungent, strong plume over the bartender's head. \"Don't worry about it. I'm probably a little over accustomed to personal space.\"  I couldn't remember the last time I'd heard anyone on-world talk about personal space. With the mortality rate at zero and the birth-rate at non-zero, the world was inexorably accreting a dense carpet of"]]]
