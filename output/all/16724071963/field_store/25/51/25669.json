It was very sad, and said, \"I will not have gold leaves and I will not have glass leaves. I want green leaves. I want to be like the other trees.\"  And the little tree went to sleep. When it woke, it was like other trees. It had green leaves.  A goat came by. He saw the green leaves on the little tree. The goat was hungry and he ate all the leaves.

I like my needles best.\"  [Illustration: THE PINE TREE WITH NEEDLES.]  And the little tree went to sleep. The fairy gave it what it wanted.  When it woke, it had its needles again. Then the little pine tree was happy.     THE LITTLE MATCH GIRL.             almost        match           across           dark          running         bare           year          slippers        fell  It was very cold. The snow fell and it was almost dark.  It was the last day of the year.  A little match girl was running in the street. Her name was Gretchen. She had no hat on.  Her feet were bare. When she left home, she had on some big slippers of her mama's. But they were so large that she lost them when she ran across the street.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            apron         curly           lights           bunch         about           smelled           could         matches         cooking  Gretchen had a lot of matches in her old apron.  She had a little bunch in her hand.  But she could not sell her matches. No one would buy them.  Poor little Gretchen!  She was cold and hungry.  The snow fell on her curly hair. But she did not think about that.  She saw lights in the houses.  She smelled good things cooking.  She said to herself, \"This is the last night of the year.\"         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            knew          window          fire           money         even            pile  Gretchen got colder and colder.  She was afraid to go home. She knew her papa would whip her, if she did not take some money to him.  It was as cold at home as in the street. They were too poor to have a fire. They had to put rags in the windows to keep out the wind.  Gretchen did not even have a bed. She had to sleep on a pile of rags.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            frozen        candle          sitting           lighted       thought         stove           near          think           step  She sat down on a door step.  [Illustration: GRETCHEN ON THE DOOR STEP.]  Her little hands were almost frozen.  She took a match and lighted it to warm her hands. The match looked like a little candle.  Gretchen thought she was sitting by a big stove. It was so bright.  She put the match near her feet, to warm them. Then the light went out. She did not think that she was by the stove any more.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            another       dishes          roast           table         cloth           ready           fork          knife           turkey  Gretchen lighted another match.  Now she thought she could look into a room. In this room was a table.  A white cloth and pretty dishes were on the table. There was a roast turkey, too. It was cooked and ready to eat. The knife and fork were in his back. The turkey jumped from the dish and ran to the little girl.  The light went out and she was in the cold and dark again.            Christmas     candles           many          until  Gretchen lighted another match. Then she thought she was sitting by a Christmas tree. Very many candles were on the tree. It was full of pretty things.  Gretchen put up her little hands. The light went out.  The lights on the Christmas tree went up, up--until she saw they were the stars.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            grandma       never           before           dying         going           been  Then she saw a star fall.  \"Some one is dying,\" said little Gretchen.  Her grandma had been very good to the little girl. But she was dead.  The grandma had said, \"When a star falls some one is going to God.\"  The little girl lighted another match. It made a big light.  Gretchen thought she saw her grandma. She never looked so pretty before. She looked so sweet and happy.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            take          goes  \"O grandma,\" said the little girl, \"take me. When the light goes out you will go away. The stove and the turkey and the Christmas tree all went away.\"  Then Gretchen lighted a bunch of matches. She wanted to keep her grandma with her. The matches made it very light.  The grandma took the little girl in her arms. They went up, up--where they would never be cold or hungry.  They were with God.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            found         next            burned           dead          froze           death  The next day came.  Some men found a little girl in the street. She was dead.  In her hand were the burned matches.  They said, \"Poor little thing, she froze to death.\"  They did not know how happy she was in heaven.     LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD.             six           take            cake           coat          butter          basket           hood          always          off  When May was six years old, her grandma made her a red coat with a hood. She looked so pretty in it that the children all called her \"Red Riding-Hood.\"  One day her mama said, \"I want you to take this cake and some butter to grandma.\"  Red Riding-Hood was very glad to go. She always had a good time at grandma's.  [Illustration: LITTLE RED RIDING-HOOD AND HER MOTHER]  She put the things into her little basket and ran off.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            wolf          mill            shall           going         first           wood  When Red Riding-Hood came to the wood, she met a big wolf.  [Illustration: SHE MEETS THE WOLF.]  \"Where are you going?\" said the wolf.  Red Riding-Hood said, \"I am going to see my grandma. Mama has made her a cake and some butter.\"  \"Does she live far?\" said the wolf.  \"Yes,\" said Red Riding-Hood, \"in the white house by the mill.\"  \"I will go too, and we shall see who will get there first,\" said the wolf.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            short         flowers         soft           stopped       tapped          pull           pick          voice           string  The wolf ran off and took a short way, but Red Riding-Hood stopped to pick some flowers.  When the wolf got to the house, he tapped on the door.  The grandma said, \"Who is there?\" The wolf made his voice as soft as he could. He said, \"It is little Red Riding-Hood, grandma.\"  Then the old lady said, \"Pull the string and the door will open.\"  The wolf pulled the string and the door opened.  He ran in and ate the poor old lady.  Then he jumped into her bed and put on her cap.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            tapped        thank           dear            arms          hug             called  When Red Riding-Hood tapped on the door, the wolf called out, \"Who is there?\" Red Riding-Hood said, \"It is your little Red Riding-Hood, grandma.\"  Then the wolf said, \"Pull the string and the door will open.\"  When she went in, she said, \"Look, grandma, see the cake and butter mama has sent you.\"  \"Thank you, dear, put them on the table and come here.\"         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            better        hear            eyes           ears          how             teeth           ate           cruel           poor  When Red Riding-Hood went near the bed, she said, \"Oh, grandma, how big your arms are!\"  \"The better to hug you, my dear.\"  \"How big your ears are, grandma.\"  \"The better to hear you, my dear.\"  \"How big your eyes are, grandma.\"  \"The better to see you, my dear.\"  \"How big your teeth are, grandma!\"  \"The better to eat you.\"  Then the cruel wolf jumped up and ate poor little Red Riding-Hood.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            just          hunter          scream           killed        heard           open  Just then a hunter came by. He heard Red Riding-Hood scream. The hunter ran into the house and killed the old wolf.  [Illustration: THE GRANDMOTHER, THE HUNTER AND LITTLE RED RIDING- HOOD.]  When he cut the wolf open, out jumped Little Red Riding-Hood and her grandma.     THE APPLES OF IDUN.             once          hills           field           journey       rocks           cattle           walked        pieces          three  Once upon a time three of the gods went on a journey.  One was Thor and one was Loki. Loki was ugly and mean.  The gods liked to walk over the hills and rocks. They could go very fast for they were so big.  The gods walked on and on.  At last they got very hungry. Then they came to a field with cattle.  [Illustration: LOKI AND ANOTHER GOD TAKE A WALK.]  Thor killed a big ox and put the pieces into a pot.         *       *       *       *       *            meat          share           talking           cross         eagle           right  They made a big fire but the meat would not cook. They made the fire bigger and bigger, but the meat would not cook.  Then the gods were very cross.  Some one said, \"Give me my share, and I will make the meat cook.\"  The gods looked to see who was talking. There in an oak tree was a big eagle.  [Illustration: THE THREE GODS TRY TO COOK THE OX.]  The gods were so hungry that they said, \"Well, we will.\"         *       *       *       *       *            supper     "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7841"],["title","A Primary Reader: Old-time Stories, Fairy Tales and Myths Retold (#2)"],["body","   stuck           enough           minute        claws           stones           pole          against         flew  The supper was ready in a minute.  Then the eagle flew down to get his share. He took the four legs and there was not much left but the ribs.  This made Loki cross for he was very hungry. He took a long pole to hit the eagle. But the pole stuck to the eagle's claws. The other end stuck to Loki.  Then the eagle flew away. He did not fly high. He flew just high enough for Loki to hit against the stones.         *       *       *       *       *            please        giant           flying           tried         feathers        suit  Loki said, \"Please let me go! Oh, please let me go!\"  But the eagle said, \"No, you tried to kill me. I will not let you go.\"  And the eagle hit him against the stones.  Loki said again, \"Please let me go!\"  But the eagle said, \"No, I have you now.\"  Then Loki knew the eagle was a giant and not a bird.  This giant had a suit of eagle's feathers. He was flying in his eagle suit when he saw Loki.         *       *       *       *       *            city          beautiful       apples           felt          growing         young  Now the gods lived in a city named Asgard.  In this city Idun kept the beautiful golden apples. When the gods felt they were growing old, they ate the apples and were young again.  The giant wanted to be like the gods. So he said to Loki, \"I will let you go, if you will get me the apples of Idun.\"  [Illustration: IDUN WITH HER APPLES.]  But Loki said, \"I can't do that.\"          *       *       *       *       *            bumped        gate            putting           stayed        golden          morning  So the eagle bumped him on the stones again.  Then Loki said, \"I can't stand this. I will get the apples for you.\"  Loki and the eagle went to the city. The eagle stayed by the gate, but Loki went into the city. He went up to Idun. She was putting the apples into a beautiful golden box.  [Illustration: LOKI AND IDUN]  Loki said, \"Good morning, Idun Those are beautiful apples.\"  And Idun said, \"Yes, they are beautiful.\" \"I saw some just like them, the other day,\" said Loki.  [Illustration: IDUN WITH HER APPLES.]            strange       show           bring         picked  Idun knew there were no other apples like these, and she said, \"That is strange. I would like to see them.\"  Loki said, \"Come with me and I will show them to you. It is only a little way. Bring your apples with you.\"  As soon as Idun was out of the gates the eagle flew down. He picked her up in his claws. Then he flew away with her to his home.          *       *       *       *       *            after         pale            falcon           passed        story           began  Day after day passed and Idun did not come back. The gods did not have the golden apples to eat, so they began to get old.  At last they said, \"Who let the apples go?\"  Then Loki looked pale and the gods said, \"Loki, you did it.\" And Loki said, \"Yes, I did.\"  [Illustration: THE GODS ASK WHERE IDUN IS.]  He did not tell a story that time.  Then Loki said, \"I will get Idun and the apples back, if I may have the falcon suit.\"          *       *       *       *       *            changed       faster  The gods said, \"You may have it, if you will bring the apples back.\"  Loki put on the falcon suit and flew away. He looked like a big bird flying.  When Loki came to the giant's home, he was glad the giant was not there. He changed Idun into a nut and then flew away with the nut.  [Illustration: THE GIANT SEES THE BIRD FLY AWAY]  When the giant came home, Idun was gone. The golden apples were gone, too.  Then the giant put on his eagle suit and flew after Loki.  Loki heard the eagle coming. Loki flew faster.         *       *       *       *       *            breath        over            changed           walls         blazed          burned  Poor Loki was all out of breath. The eagle flew faster and faster.  Then the gods got on the walls to look for Loki. They saw him coming and the eagle after him.  So they made fires on the walls. At last Loki flew over the walls.  Then the gods lighted the fires. The fires blazed up.  The eagle flew into the fire and was burned.  As soon as Loki put the nut down, it changed to Idun.  The gods ate the beautiful golden apples and were young again.  [Illustration]     HOW THOR GOT THE HAMMER.             proud         porch           lying           journeys      tricks          wife           always        alone           asleep  Sif was Thor's wife.  Sif had long golden hair. Thor was very proud of Sif's golden hair.  Thor was always going on long journeys. One day he went off and left Sif alone. She went out on the porch and fell asleep.  Loki came along. He was always playing tricks.  He saw Sif lying asleep. He said, \"I am going to cut off her hair.\"  [Illustration]  So Loki went up on the porch and cut off Sif's golden hair.          *       *       *       *       *            where         around          crying           answer        found           somebody  When Sif woke up and saw that her hair was gone, she cried and cried. Then she ran to hide. She did not want Thor to see her.  When Thor came home, he could not find Sif.  \"Sif! Sif!\" he called, \"Where are you?\"  But Sif did not answer.  Thor looked all around the house. At last he found her crying.  [Illustration: \"OH THOR, ALL MY HAIR, IS GONE!\"]  \"Oh, Thor, look, all my hair is gone! Somebody has cut it off. It was a man. He ran away with it.\"          *       *       *       *       *            angry         mischief        right           getting       cutting         something  Then Thor was very angry. He said, \"I know it was Loki. He is always getting into mischief. Just wait until I get him!\"  And Thor went out to find Loki. Pretty soon he found him.  Thor said, \"Did you cut off Sif's hair?\" Loki said, \"Yes, I did.\"  \"Then you must pay for cutting off my wife's hair,\" said Thor.  [Illustration: \"DID YOU CUT OFF SIF'S HAIR?\"]  \"All right,\" said Loki, \"I will get you something better than the hair.\"          *       *       *       *       *            ground        thumb           beads           dwarfs        crooked         crown                         worked  Loki went down, down into the ground to the home of the dwarfs. It was very dark down there. The only light came from the dwarfs' fires.  The dwarfs were ugly little black men. They were not any bigger than your thumb. They had crooked backs and crooked legs. Their eyes looked like black beads.  [Illustration: LOKI AND THE DWARFS.]  Loki said, \"Can you make me a gold crown that will grow like real hair?\"  The dwarfs said, \"Yes, we can.\" So the busy little dwarfs worked all night.         *       *       *       *       *            morning       showed          laughed           spear         wonderful       three           ship          standing        brother           nobody        stepped         else  When morning came the dwarfs gave Loki his crown of golden hair. They gave him a spear and a ship, too.  [Illustration: THE DWARFS BRING TO LOKI THE SHIP, THE SPEAR AND THE CROWN OF HAIR.]  Loki took the things up to Asgard, where the gods all lived.  Then the gods all came up to him. He showed them the things.  The gods said, \"They are very wonderful.\"  And Loki said, \"Oh, nobody else can make such things as my little dwarfs.\"  A little dwarf, named Brok, was standing near by. He heard Loki say that. Then he stepped up and said, \"My brother can make just as good things as these.\"  Loki laughed and said, \"If you can get three things as wonderful as these, I will give you my head.\"  [Illustration: BROK TELLS LOKI THAT HIS BROTHER CAN MAKE BETTER GIFTS]          *       *       *       *       *            anywhere      misses           spear         mark  Brok went down into the ground where his little dwarfs were working.  Brok's brother was named Sindre. He said to his brother, \"Loki says that you can't make such nice things as his dwarfs can. He said that he would give me his head if I could get him such wonderful things as his.\"  This made the dwarfs angry. Their eyes grew big. They said, \"He will see what we can do.\"  Sindre wanted to know what the wonderful things were.  Brok said, \"Loki has a golden crown that will grow like real hair. A ship that can go anywhere. A spear that never misses the mark.\"  \"We will show him,\" said the dwarfs.         *       *       *       *       *       *            burning       blow            pigskin           bellows       blew            blowing  The dwarfs soon had the fires burning. Then Sindre put a pigskin into the fire.  He gave the bellows to Brok and said, \"Now blow as hard as you can.\"  Then Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew.  A little fly came in and bit him on the hand.  The fly bit him so hard that Brok thought he would have to stop blowing, but he did not.  Then Sindre came back. He took out a golden pig from the fire.        *       *       *       *       *            stand         lump            ring  He next put a lump of gold into the fire.  He said to Brok, \"Blow and blow and blow, and do not stop.\"  Then Sindre went out again.  So Brok blew as hard as he could.  Then the same fly came in and bit him again.  Brok thought that he could not stand it, but he kept on.  When Sindre came back, he took a gold ring from the fire.         *       *       *       *       *            hard          forehead        brush           iron          blood           hammer           handle        spoiled         mean  Then Sindre put a lump of iron into the fire.  He said to Brok, \"Now blow as hard as you can.\"  And Sindre went out. Brok blew and blew. The same mean fly came again, and bit him on the forehead. It bit so hard that the blood ran into his eyes.  Brok put up his hand to brush away the fly.  Just then Sindre came back.  He took the hammer out of the fire.  [Illustration"]]]
