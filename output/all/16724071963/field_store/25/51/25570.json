It is astonishing how money does spoil a man.\"  \"He had come into  his fortune when he was here.  Money had not spoiled him then.\"  Isaura paused, pressing her hands tightly together; then she suddenly rose to her feet, the colour on her cheek mantling and receding rapidly, and fixing on her startled visitor eyes no longer dim, but with something half fierce, half imploring in the passion of their gaze, said: \"Your husband spoke of me to Mr. Vane: I know he did.  What did Mr. Vane answer?  Do not evade my question.  The truth! the truth!  I only ask the truth!\"  \"Give me your hand; sit here beside me, dearest child.\"  \"Child!--no, I am a woman!--weak as a woman, but strong as a woman too!-- The truth!\"  Mrs. Morley had come prepared to carry out the resolution she had formed and \"break\" to Isaura \"the truth,\" that which the girl now demanded.  But then she had meant to break the truth in her own gentle, gradual way. Thus suddenly called upon, her courage failed her.  She burst into tears. Isaura gazed at her dry-eyed.  \"Your tears answer me.  Mr. Vane has heard that I have been insulted.  A man like him does not stoop to love for a woman who has known an insult. I do not blame him; I honour him the more--he is right.\"  \"No-no-no!--you insulted!  Who dared to insult you?  (Mrs. Morley had never heard the story about the Russian Prince.)  Mr. Vane spoke to Frank, and writes of you to me as of one whom it is impossible not to admire, to respect; but--I cannot say it--you will have the truth,-- there, read and judge for yourself.\"  And Mrs. Morley drew forth and thrust into Isaura's hands the letter she had concealed from her husband. The letter was not very long; it began with expressions of warm gratitude to Mrs. Morley, not for her invitation only, but for the interest she had conceived in his happiness.  It went on thus \"I join with my whole heart in all that you say, with such eloquent justice, of the mental and personal gifts so bounteously lavished by nature on the young lady whom you name.  \"No one can feel more sensible than I of the charm of so exquisite a loveliness; no one can more sincerely join in the belief that the praise which greets the commencement of her career is but the whisper of the praise that will cheer its progress with louder and louder plaudits.  \"He only would be worthy of her hand, who, if not equal to herself in genius, would feel raised into partnership with it by sympathy with its objects and joy in its triumphs.  For myself, the same pain with which I should have learned she had adopted the profession which she originally contemplated, saddened and stung me when, choosing a career that confers a renown yet more lasting than the stage, she no less left behind her the peaceful immunities of private life.  Were I even free to consult only my own heart in the choice of the one sole partner of my destinies (which I cannot at present honestly say that I am, though I had expected to be so ere this, when I last saw you at Paris); could I even hope--which I have no right to do--that I could chain to myself any private portion of thoughts which now flow into the large channels by which poets enrich the blood of the world,--still (I say it in self-reproach, it may be the fault of my English rearing, it may rather be the fault of an egotism peculiar to myself)--still I doubt if I could render happy any woman whose world could not be narrowed to the Home that she adorned and blessed.  \"And yet not even the jealous tyranny of man's love could dare to say to natures like hers of whom we speak, 'Limit to the household glory of one the light which genius has placed in its firmament for the use and enjoyment of all.'\"  \"I thank you so much,\" said Isaura, calmly; \"suspense makes a woman so weak--certainty so strong.\"  Mechanically she smoothed and refolded the letter--mechanically, with slow, lingering hands--then she extended it to her friend, smiling.  \"Nay, will you not keep it yourself?\" said Mrs. Morley.  \"The more you examine the narrow-minded prejudices, the English arrogant man's jealous dread of superiority--nay, of equality--in the woman he 'can only value as he does his house or his horse, because she is his exclusive property, the more you will be rejoiced to find yourself free for a more worthy choice.  Keep the letter; read it till you feel for the writer forgiveness and disdain.\"  Isaura took back the letter, and leaned her cheek on her hand, looking dreamily into space.  It was some moments before she replied, and her words then had no reference to Mrs. Morley's consolatory exhortation.  \"He was so pleased when he learned that I renounced the career on which I had set my ambition.  I thought he would have been so pleased when I sought in another career to raise myself nearer to his level--I see now how sadly I was mistaken.  All that perplexed me before in him is explained.  I did not guess how foolishly I had deceived myself till three days ago,--then I did guess it; and it was that guess which tortured me so terribly that I could not keep my heart to myself when I saw you to-day; in spite of all womanly pride it would force its way--to the truth.  \"Hush!  I must tell you what was said to me by another friend of mine-- a good friend, a wise and kind one.  Yet I was so angry when she said it that I thought I could never see her more.\"  \"My sweet darling!  who was this friend, and what did she say to you?\"  \"The friend was Madame Savarin.\"  \"No woman loves you more except myself--and she said?\"  \"That she would have suffered no daughter of hers to commit her name to the talk of the world as I have done--be exposed to the risk of insult as I have been--until she had the shelter and protection denied to me.  And I have thus overleaped the bound that a prudent mother would prescribe to her child, have become one whose hand men do not seek, unless they themselves take the same roads to notoriety.  Do you not think she was right?\"  \"Not as you so morbidly put it, silly girl,--certainly not right.  But I do wish that you had the shelter and protection which Madame Savarin meant to express; I do wish that you were happily married to one very different from Mr. Vane--one who would be more proud of your genius than of your beauty--one who would say, 'My name, safer far in its enduring nobility than those that depend on titles and lands--which are held on the tenure of the popular breath--must be honoured by posterity, for She has deigned to make it hers.  No democratic revolution can disennoble me.\"  \"Ay, ay, you believe that men will be found to think with complacency that they owe to a wife a name they could not achieve for themselves. Possibly there are such men.  Where?--among those that are already united by sympathies in the same callings, the same labours, the same hopes and fears with the women who have left behind them the privacies of home. Madame de Grantmesnil was wrong.  Artists should wed with artists. True--true!\"  Here she passed her hand over her forehead--it was a pretty way of hers when seeking to concentrate thought--and was silent a moment or so.  \"Did you ever feel,\" she then asked dreamily, \"that there are moments in life when a dark curtain seems to fall over one's past that a day before was so clear, so blended with the present?  One cannot any longer look behind; the gaze is attracted onward, and a track of fire flashes upon the future,--the future which yesterday was invisible.  There is a line by some English poet--Mr. Vane once quoted it, not to me, but to M. Savarin, and in illustration of his argument, that the most complicated recesses of thought are best reached by the simplest forms of expression. I said to myself, 'I will study that truth if ever I take to literature as I have taken to song;' and--yes--it was that evening that the ambition fatal to woman fixed on me its relentless fangs--at Enghien--we were on the lake--the sun was setting.\"  \"But you do not tell me the line that so impressed you,\" said Mrs. Morley, with a woman's kindly tact.  \"The line--which line?  Oh, I remember; the line was this:  \"'I see as from a tower the end of all.\"  \"And now--kiss me, dearest--never a word again to me about this conversation: never a word about Mr. Vane--the dark curtain has fallen on the past.\"     CHAPTER XI.  Men and women are much more like each other in certain large elements of character than is generally supposed, but it is that very resemblance which makes their differences the more incomprehensible to each other; just as in politics, theology, or that most disputatious of all things disputable, metaphysics, the nearer the reasoners approach each other in points that to an uncritical bystander seem the most important, the more sure they are to start off in opposite directions upon reaching the speck of a pin-prick.  Now there are certain grand meeting-places between man and woman--the grandest of all is on the ground of love, and yet here also is the great field of quarrel.  And here the teller of a tale such as mine ought, if he is sufficiently wise to be humble, to know that it is almost profanation if, as man, he presumes to enter the penetralia of a woman's innermost heart, and repeat, as a man would repeat, all the vibrations of sound which the heart of a woman sends forth undistinguishable even to her own ear.  I know Isaura as intimately as if I had rocked her in her cradle, played with her in her childhood, educated and trained her in her youth; and yet I can no more tell you faithfully what passed in her mind during the forty-eight hours that intervened between her conversation with that American lady and her reappearance in some commonplace drawing-room, than I can tell you what the Man in the Moon might feel if the sun that his world reflected were blotted out of creation.  I can only say that when she reappeared in that commonplace drawing-room world, there was a change in her face not very perceptible to the ordinary observer.

CHAPTER I.  Graham Vane had heard nothing for months from M. Renard, when one morning he received the letter I translate:  \"MONSIEUR,--I am happy to inform you that I have at last obtained one piece of information which may lead to a more important discovery.  When we parted after our fruitless research in Vienna, we had both concurred in the persuasion that, for some reason known only to the two ladies themselves, Madame Marigny and Madame Duval had exchanged names--that it was Madame Marigny who had deceased in the name of Madame Duval, and Madame Duval who had survived in that of Marigny.  \"It was clear to me that the _beau Monsieur_ who had visited the false Duval must have been cognisant of this exchange of name, and that, if his name and whereabouts could be ascertained, he, in all probability, would know what had become of the lady who is the object of our research; and after the lapse of so many years he would probably have very slight motive to preserve the concealment of facts which might, no doubt, have been convenient at the time.  The lover of the _soi-disant_ Mademoiselle Duval was by such accounts as we could gain a man of some rank--very possibly a married man; and the liaison, in short, was one of those which, while they last, necessitate precautions and secrecy.  \"Therefore, dismissing all attempts at further trace of the missing lady, I resolved to return to Vienna as soon as the business that recalled me to Paris was concluded, and devote myself exclusively to the search after the amorous and mysterious Monsieur.  \"I did not state this determination to you, because, possibly, I might be in error--or, if not in error, at least too sanguine in my expectations-- and it is best to avoid disappointing an honourable client.  \"One thing was clear, that, at the time of the _soi-disant_ Duval's decease, the _beau Monsieur_ was at Vienna.  \"It appeared also tolerably clear that when the lady friend of the deceased quitted Munich so privately, it was to Vienna she repaired, and from Vienna comes the letter demanding the certificates of Madame Duval's death.  Pardon me, if I remind you of all these circumstances no doubt fresh in your recollection.  I repeat them in order to justify the conclusions to which they led me.  \"I could not, however, get permission to absent myself from Paris for the time I might require till the end of last April.  I had meanwhile sought all private means of ascertaining what Frenchmen of rank and station were in that capital in the autumn of 1849.  Among the list of the very few such Messieurs I fixed upon one as the most likely to be the mysterious Achille--Achille was, indeed, his _nom de bapteme_.  \"A man of intrigue--a _bonnes fortunes_--of lavish expenditure withal; very tenacious of his dignity, and avoiding any petty scandals by which it might be lowered; just the man who, in some passing affair of gallantry with a lady of doubtful repute, would never have signed his titular designation to a letter, and would have kept himself as much incognito as he could.  But this man was dead--had been dead some years. He had not died at Vienna--never visited that capital for some years before his death.  He was then, and had long been, the _ami de la maison_ of one of those grandes dames of whose intimacy _grands seigneurs_ are not ashamed.  They parade there the _bonnes fortunes_ they conceal elsewhere.  Monsieur and the grande dame were at Baden when the former died.  Now, Monsieur, a Don Juan of that stamp is pretty sure always to have a confidential Leporello.  If I could find Leporello alive I might learn the secrets not to be extracted from a Don Juan defunct.  I ascertained, in truth, both at Vienna, to which I first repaired in order to verify the renseignements I had obtained at Paris, and at Baden, to which I then bent my way, that this brilliant noble had a favourite valet who had lived with him from his youth--an Italian, who had contrived in the course of his service to lay by savings enough to set up a hotel somewhere in Italy, supposed to be Pisa.  To Pisa I repaired, but the man had left some years; his hotel had not prospered--he had left in debt. No one could say what had become of him.  At last, after a long and tedious research, I found him installed as manager of a small hotel at Genoa--a pleasant fellow enough; and after friendly intercourse with him (of course I lodged at his hotel), I easily led him to talk of his earlier life and adventures, and especially of his former master, of whose splendid career in the army of '_La Belle Deesse_' he was not a little proud.  It was not very easy to get him to the particular subject in question.  In fact, the affair with the poor false Duval had been so brief and undistinguished an episode in his master's life, that it was not without a strain of memory that he reached it.  \"By little and little, however, in the course of two or three evenings, and by the aid of many flasks of Orviette or bottles of Lacrima (wines, Monsieur, that I do not commend to any one who desires to keep his stomach sound and his secrets safe), I gathered these particulars.  \"Our Don Juan, since the loss of a wife in the first year of marriage, had rarely visited Paris where he had a domicile--his ancestral hotel there he had sold.  \"But happening to visit that capital of Europe a few months before we come to our dates at Aix-la-Chapelle, he made acquaintance with Madame Marigny, a natural daughter of high-placed parents, by whom, of course, she had never been acknowledged, but who had contrived that she should receive a good education at a convent; and on leaving it also contrived that an old soldier of fortune--which means an officer without fortune-- who had served in Algiers with some distinction, should offer her his hand, and add the modest dot they assigned her to his yet more modest income.  They contrived also that she should understand the offer must be accepted.  Thus Mademoiselle 'Quelque Chose' became Madame Marigny, and she, on her part, contrived that a year or so later she should be left a widow.  After a marriage, of course the parents washed their hands of her--they had done their duty.  At the time Don Juan made this lady's acquaintance nothing could be said against her character; but the milliners and butchers had begun to imply that they would rather have her money than trust to her character.  Don Juan fell in love with her, satisfied the immediate claims of milliner and butcher, and when they quitted Paris it was agreed that they should meet later at Aix-la- Chapelle.  But when he resorted to that sultry and, to my mind, unalluring spa, he was surprised by a line from her saying that she had changed her name of Marigny for that of Duval.  \"'I recollect,' said Leporello, 'that two days afterwards my master said to me, 'Caution and secrecy.  Don't mention my name at the house to which I may send you with any note for Madame Duval.  I don't announce my name when I call. _La petite_ Marigny has exchanged her name for that of Louise Duval; and I find that there is a Louise Duval here, her friend, who is niece to a relation of my own, and a terrible relation to quarrel with--a dead shot and unrivalled swordsman--Victor de Mauleon.  My master was brave enough, but he enjoyed life, and he did not think _la petite_ Marigny worth being killed for.'  \"Leporello remembered very little of what followed.  All he did remember is that Don Juan, when at Vienna, said to him one morning, looking less gay than usual, 'It is finished with _ca petite_ Marigny_-she is no more.'  Then he ordered his bath, wrote a note, and said with tears in his eyes, 'Take this to Mademoiselle Celeste; not to be compared to _la petite_ Marigny; but _la petite_ Celeste is still alive.'  Ah, Monsieur! if only any man in France could be as proud of his ruler as that Italian was of my countrymen!  Alas! we Frenchmen are all made to command--or at least we think ourselves so--and we are insulted by one who says to us, 'Serve and obey.'  Nowadays, in France, we find all Don Juans and no Leporellos.  \"After strenuous exertions upon my part to recall to Leporello's mind the important question whether he had ever seen the true Duval, passing under the name of Marigny--whether she had not presented herself to his master at Vienna or elsewhere--he rubbed his forehead, and drew from it these reminiscences.  \"'On the day that his Excellency,'--Leporello generally so styled his master--'Excellency,' as you are aware, is the title an Italian would give to Satan if taking his wages,'told me that _la petite_ Marigny was no more, he had received previously a lady veiled and mantled, whom I did not recognise as any one I had seen before, but I noticed her way of carrying herself--haughtily--her head thrown back; and I thought to myself, that lady is one of his grandes dames.  She did call again two or three times, never announcing her name; then she did not reappear.  She might be Madame Duval--I can't say.'  \"'But did you never hear his Excellency speak of the real Duval after that time?'  \"'No--_non mi ricordo_--I don't remember.'  \"'Nor of some living Madame Marigny, though the real one was dead?'  \"'Stop, I do recollect; not that he ever named such a person to me, but that I have posted letters for him to a Madame Marigny--oh, yes! even years after the said _petite_ Marigny was dead; and once I did venture to say, 'Pardon me, Eccellenza, but may I ask if that poor lady is really dead, since I have to prepay this letter to her?'\"  \"'Oh,' said he, 'Madame Marigny!  Of course the one you know is dead, but there are others of the same name; this lady is of my family. Indeed, her house, though noble in itself, recognises the representative of mine as its head, and I am too _bon prince_ not to acknowledge and serve any one who branches out of my own tree.'\"  \"A day after"]]]
