Van says he hasn't seen a real mountain since he came East. Then we want to be on hand for the maple-sugar making. Why, ten days won't be half long enough to do everything we ought to do.\"  His mother laughed.  \"You must have a good sleigh ride, too,\" she put in.  \"I draw the line on a sleigh ride if we have to go with that horse that brought us up from the station,\" announced Bob.  \"Me, too!\" Van echoed.  \"It would take you the entire ten days to get anywhere and back if you went sleighing with the Admiral,\" said Mr. Carlton.  Every one smiled.  \"I'd advise your seizing upon the first clear day for your Monadnock tramp,\" Mr. Carlton continued. \"You'd better make sure of good weather when you get it. It won't make so much difference with your other plans; but for the mountain trip you must have a good day.\"  \"I do want Van to get the view from the top if he makes the climb,\" Bob answered.  So the chat went merrily on.  Yet despite the gaiety of the evening and Mr. Carlton's evident interest in the boys' holiday schemes Bob more than once caught his father furtively studying Van's profile. Obviously something either puzzled or annoyed him. There was, however, no want of cordiality in his hearty goodnight or in the zest with which he advocated that if the next morning proved to be unclouded the two lads better make certain of their mountain excursion. He even helped lay out the walk and offered many helpful suggestions. Bob's uneasiness lest his father should not like his chum vanished, and when he dropped into bed the last vague misgiving took flight, and he fell into a slumber so profound that morning came only too soon.  It was David who, entering softly to start the fire in the bedroom fireplace, awakened Bob.  He sat up and rubbed his eyes sleepily.  \"What sort of a day is it, David?\" he questioned in a whisper that he might not arouse Van, who was lying motionless beside him.  \"It's a grand day, Mr. Bob. There ain't a cobweb in the sky.\"  David tiptoed out and Bob nestled down once more beneath the blankets. It was fun to lie there watching the logs blaze up and see your breath rise on the chilly air; it was fun, too, to know that no gong would sound as it did at school and compel you to rush madly into your clothes lest you be late for breakfast and chapel, and receive a black mark in consequence. No, for ten delicious days there was to be no such thing as hurry. Bob lay very still luxuriating in the thought. Then he glanced at Van, who was still immovable, his arm beneath his cheek. His friend's obliviousness to the world was irresistible. Bob raised himself carefully; caught up his pillow; took accurate aim; and let it fly.  It struck Van in the head, routing further possibility of sleep.  \"Can't you let a fellow alone?\" he snapped.  \"Wake up, you old mummy!\" shouted Bob. \"A great mountain climber you are, sleeping here all day. Have you forgotten you're going up Monadnock to-day?\"  \"Hang Monadnock! I was sound asleep when you lammed that pillow at me, you heathen. What's the good of waking me up at this unearthly hour?\" yawned Van.  \"It's seven o'clock.\"  \"Seven o'clock!\" Van straightened up and stared. \"Why, man alive, I haven't been asleep fifteen minutes.\"  \"You've been lying like a log for nine mortal hours,\" chuckled Bob.  \"Great Scott! Some sleep, isn't it? That's better than I do at Colversham.\"  \"Rat_her!_\"  \"Well, I need sleep. I'm worn out with over-study.\"  \"You are, like--\"  \"I am. I'm an intellectual wreck,\" moaned Van. \"It's the Latin.\"  Bob burst into a shout, which was cut short by a rap at the door.  \"Time to get up, boys,\" called the cheery voice of Mr. Carlton. \"Step lively, please. Here's a can of hot water.\"  The boys wasted no more time in fooling.  They bathed, dressed, and almost before they knew it were at the table partaking of a hearty breakfast which was capped by heaps of golden brown pancakes rendered even more golden by the sea of maple-syrup in which they floated.  \"I'll never be able to climb anything after this meal,\" Van gasped as he left the table and was thrusting his arms into his sweater.  Bob grinned.  \"Don't expect us back before late afternoon, Father,\" he called over his shoulder. \"We've a long slow climb ahead of us because of the snow. Probably we shall find it drifted in lots of places. Then we shall want some time at the top of the mountain, you know. Besides, we're going to stop and cook chops, and that will delay us. So don't worry if we don't turn up much before dinner time.\"  \"You're sure you know the trail, Bob?\" his mother called as the trampers went down the steps.  \"Why, Mother dear, what a question! Know the trail? Haven't I climbed that mountain so many times that I could go up it backwards and with my eyes shut?\"  \"I guess that's true, Mother,\" agreed Mr. Carlton reassuringly.  \"Good-bye, then,\" said Bob's mother. \"Have a fine day and don't freeze your noses.\"  The boys waved, and with a scuff of their snow-shoes were off.  The climb was indeed a stiff one. At first the trail led through low, flat woods, fragrant with hemlock and balsam; here it was sheltered and warm. But soon the real ascent began.  \"We follow the bed of this brook almost to the top,\" explained Bob who was leading the way. \"We come into it here, you see. In summer it is a narrow path clearly marked by rough stones; you wouldn't believe how different it looks now all covered with snow. It doesn't seem like the same place. I didn't realize what a difference the snow would make in everything. But, anyway, we can't miss the way with these great boulders along the sides of the path; and even if we did the trees are blazed.\"  They pushed on for some time.  Then the strap of Van's snow-shoe broke.  \"Oh, thunder! Got a knife, Bob?\" he called. \"This darn thing's busted. I'll have to haul to for repairs.\"  Bob stopped impatiently.  \"Why didn't you look at it before you started?\" he said.  \"Never thought of it, Old Preparedness,\" was the good-natured reply. \"No matter, I have some string and I think I can fix it.\"  It took some time, however, to make the fastening to the shoe and moccasin secure, and in the meantime the sun went behind a cloud.  \"I guess Father wasn't a very good weather prophet,\" remarked Bob, glancing at the sky. \"It seems to be clouding up.\"  \"Don't fret. What do we care?\" was Van's easy answer. \"We're not really after the view. I don't give a hurrah for what we see when we get to the top; what I want is the fun of doing it.\"  They shuffled on.  \"I'll be glad when this luncheon is inside instead of outside of me, won't you?\" puffed Bob. \"It's almighty heavy to carry.\"  \"It isn't the lunch I mind. It's all these infernal clothes,\" was Van's retort. \"I don't see what on earth I wore so many things for.\"  \"You'll want them by and by.\"  \"I bet I won't!\" protested Van. \"I'm going to tie my red sweater to this tree and leave it here; I can't be bothered with so much stuff.\"  \"You'll be cold when you get to the top.\"  \"No, I won't. And anyway I'd rather be too cold then than too hot now. One's no better than the other.\"  Deaf to Bob's counsel Van resolutely wound the offending sweater about a great white birch tree that stood at a fork of the path.  \"You'll be sorry,\" was Bob's parting thrust as they plodded on.  The trail was now steep and so narrow that frequently Bob had to stop and search for the blazing on the trees.  \"Of course I know my way, all right,\" he insisted. \"Still, it is mighty different in winter from what it is at other seasons of the year, I'll admit that. Remember, I've never climbed this hill when the snow was on the ground. However, when we once get to the top the coming down will be a cinch, because we can follow our own tracks.\"  It was nearly two o'clock before the boys reached the top of the mountain. Over the landscape hung a mass of heavy gray clouds beneath which the sun was hidden; the wind was cutting as a knife, and while Van sought the shelter of an old shack Bob roamed about, delighting in the familiar scene.  \"Why don't you come over here and look at the view?\" he called to his companion. \"It is fairly clear in spite of the clouds.\"  Van shivered.  \"Oh, I don't want to. I don't care a hang for the view--I told you that before. I'm just hungry. Let's get a fire going and cook the chops. What do you say?\"  \"You're cold. I said you would be.\"  \"I'm not. I'm starved, though. Where can we get some wood?\"  Bob glanced about.  \"There seems to be plenty of undergrowth down in that hollow. Take my knife and cut away some of it. There's a piece of an old stump, too, that ought to burn well if it isn't too wet.\"  \"That thing would never burn; but the brush will. Sling me the knife and I'll cut an armful. Let's build it in that little rocky shelter. Thanks to my camping training I'm right at home on this job.\"  Van's boast was no idle one. Soon the fire was crackling merrily and the chops and bacon were sizzling in the frying-pan. Bob unpacked the sandwiches and the thermos bottle of hot chocolate.  It was a regal luncheon.  How good everything tasted!  \"I believe I was cold,\" Van admitted, rubbing his hands over the dying embers of the blaze. \"But I'm warm as toast now. Is there any more grub left to eat?\"  \"Not a crumb--why? Are you still hungry?\" queried Bob who was packing up the camping kit.  Van chuckled.  \"Well, not exactly. I only thought we ought not to waste anything.\"  Bob glanced up and laughed; then his face grew sober.  \"I say, there's a snowflake!\" he cried. \"And another! Jove, Van, it's begun to snow!\"  \"We better be getting down, I suppose,\" drawled Van.  \"Just that, old man; fast as we can, too. Come on.\"  \"What's your hurry? It will be a lark.\"  \"It will be no lark if it snows much--I'll tell you that,\" replied Bob seriously. \"Besides, the folks will worry. Come ahead.\"  They turned back down the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7803"],["title","The Story of Sugar (#3)"],["body","ail.  The snowfall increased.  \"You can hardly see our tracks already,\" Bob called over his shoulder. \"And this wind is fierce. I had no idea it would snow. It is awfully wet and sticky snow, too; see how it clings to the trees.\"  They sped on.  The descent was far easier than the climb, and they could go quickly.  \"I don't remember that big rock,\" exclaimed Van suddenly, pointing to a huge boulder that fronted them. \"Isn't it a whacker! Odd that I didn't notice it when we came up. Could we have passed it and not seen it?\"  [Illustration: \"I DON'T REMEMBER THAT BIG ROCK\"]  \"I suppose we must have,\" Bob answered. \"I don't remember it, though. Everything looks queer and different in the storm. It's a regular squall. How quickly it came!\"  \"Can you still see our tracks?\"  \"No. But of course we're right; I couldn't miss my way after coming over this path so many times.\"  \"Can you see the blazes on the trees?\"  \"No, silly. How could I when they are all plastered over thick with snow?\" was Bob's scornful retort. He was silent for a moment. \"But don't you worry,\" he declared. \"I am certain we came this way--at least I _think_ we did.\"  His tone, however, was less convincing.  They went on.  \"We don't seem to be coming out anywhere, do we?\" Van finally asked.  \"No.\"  \"Didn't we pass a little clearing somewhere on the way up?\"  \"Yes, there was one.\"  \"Have we passed it?\"  \"No.\"  \"Then it's ahead of us.\"  \"It ought to be. I say, suppose we stop a minute and brush the snow off these trees so to make sure we really are on the trail.\"  \"A bully idea!\"  The boys put down their packs and reconnoitred.  \"There don't seem to be any marks on these trees,\" Van asserted after an interval of search.  \"But there must be.\"  \"Find them then--if you can.\"  Bob nervously scrutinized several gnarled trunks.  \"You're right, Van,\" he owned at last. \"We're off the trail; missed it somehow. We'd better go back; we can't be far wrong. Or better yet, you wait here while I hunt.\"  Bob was very grave.  \"You bet I'm not going to be left here to be buried in snow like the Babes in the Wood,\" protested Van gaily. \"No sir-ee! I don't stay here. I'll help hunt for the path too. Now don't go getting nervous, Bobbie, old chap. Two of us can't very well get lost on this mountain. We'll separate enough to keep within hallooing distance, and we'll tie a handkerchief on this tree so we can get back to it again if we want to. We know we're part way down, anyway. That's certain.\"  \"I don't feel so sure,\" was Bob's answer. \"We ought to have turned back when it began to cloud up; but I never dreamed of snow. The family will be having a blue fit about us.\"  \"Cheer up! We'll get down all right, only it may take us a little longer,\" Van asserted.  They branched into a side path.  The snow swirled about them in blinding sheets, and their footing became heavy and slippery.  Wandering on, they scanned the trees.  Not a mark appeared.  Both boys were chilled now, and their spirits drooped.  The possibility of being lost on the mountain began to definitely form itself in their minds.  \"I'm mighty sorry I got you into this scrape, Van,\" Bob said after a long pause. \"I was too cock-sure of myself. That comes of thinking you know it all.\"  \"Pooh! It wasn't your fault, Bob. I'd give a cent, though, to know where we are. Do you suppose we've been making any progress all this time, or just going round in a circle?\"  \"Search me. I'll bet we've walked miles,\" groaned Bob. \"I've got to rest if we never find the trail.\"  He spoke wearily.  \"You're not going to sit down, Bob,\" Van retorted sharply. \"Brace up. You've got to keep moving.\"  \"But I can't. I'm tired and--and--sleepy.\"  His voice trailed off into a yawn.  \"I don't care.\" Van wheeled on his friend fiercely and striding up to him shook him violently by the shoulders. \"Now pull yourself together!\" he commanded. \"Where's your nerve? Brace up or I'll rattle the daylights out of you.\"  \"I can't go another step.\"  \"You've got to. Start on ahead. Don't crawl that way--walk! Faster! Faster than that, do you hear? I'm just behind you, and I shall step on your heels if you lag. Keep it up. Go on.\"  Panting, Bob obeyed.  Suddenly he gave a cry.  \"What's the matter?\" demanded Van.  \"There! There on the tree!\" He pointed before him with trembling hand. \"Your sweater!\"  Van pushed past him.  \"Sure as fate! My sweater! Blamed if it isn't.\"  They both laughed weakly.  \"Then we've found the trail!\" Bob almost sobbed the words.  \"We sure have! And hark, don't you hear voices? It's David, as I'm alive; and your father!\"  Aid had indeed come.  \"Father!\" Bob shouted the word and then laughed again--this time a bit hysterically.  \"The rescuing party's right here!\" called Mr. Carlton.  He said it lightly, but as he came up and joined them Van saw that his face was drawn and his eyes suspiciously bright.  \"David has the sledge just at the foot of the hill,\" he remarked, appearing not to notice the boy's fatigue. \"I guess you'd just as soon ride the rest of the way.\"  He slipped an arm around Bob.  \"It's not much farther, son. Move right along as fast as you can. Hurry, boy. Your mother's pretty worried. Thank goodness we found you in time.\"     CHAPTER III  SUGARING OFF   The next morning, incredible as it seemed, Bob and Van were none the worse for their mountain trip, and Mr. Carlton, who had worried no little about them, and who was still feeling the effects of his hours of anxiety, remarked somewhat wrathfully:  \"You two fellows come to the surface like a pair of corks! Any one would think that being lost on a mountain was an every-day occurrence with you. That is the difference between sixteen and forty-six, I suppose. My poor old nerves rebel at being jolted in such casual fashion.\"  Bob smiled.  \"We're fit as two fighting cocks to-day, Father,\" he declared. \"In fact, this very minute we're going out to help David collect sap. They are going to boil a lot of it down to-day.\"  \"I imagined as much when I saw the smoke rising from the sugar-house chimney. Well, you seem to have your morning's work mapped out. Just don't get lost again, for I have no mind to go scouring the country a second time to find you.\"  \"We'll take good care, Mr. Carlton,\" Van replied, giving a final tug at his long rubber boots.  \"You may not lose yourself, Van,\" Bob chuckled, \"but I am morally certain you'll lose your boots. You will just walk off and leave them in some snow-drift or mud puddle and never miss them. They are big enough for an elephant. Where did you get them, anyway?\"  \"They're an old pair David lent me; your father said I'd better wear them.\"  \"He's dead right, too. The snow is still deep in spots, and it is thawing everywhere. It is not the boots I'm quarreling with; it's their size. I guess, though, you can get on somehow. We want to cut across the road and make for that hill over to the right. That's where the sugar-house is; it stands in the middle of an orchard of maples which were planted by my grandfather. Of course we have other maple trees scattered about the farm and David taps those, too; but most of our sugar comes from this orchard.\"  \"Did your grandfather make maple-sugar to sell?\"  \"Goodness, no! He made it to use. White sugar, you must understand, was not so common in the olden days as it is now. Very little of it was grown in our country; and so, as it had to be brought from the East Indies, Spain, and South America, it was pretty expensive. Grandfather told me once that when he was a boy people used brown sugar or maple-sugar to sweeten their food, and sometimes they even used cheap molasses. White sugar was looked upon as a great luxury.\"  \"I don't think I ever realized that before,\" said Van thoughtfully.  \"Why, even my father remembers when, as a little shaver, he used to have white sugar spread on his bread for a treat.\"  \"Seems queer, doesn't it?\" Van mused.  \"Yes. But it isn't so queer when you consider that all the sugar-cane now growing in America first had to be brought to the West Indies from Spain, the Canary Islands, or Madeira and then transplanted along the Mississippi delta. Dad says that originally sugar-cane came from Africa or India and that doubtless it was the Crusaders who introduced it into Europe.\"  \"Do you mean to tell me that people never knew about sugar until then?\" inquired Van incredulously, halting in the middle of the road.  \"The Chinese were practically the only people who did, and they did not use it at all as we do; they just sweetened things with the thin sap.\"  Van regarded his chum steadily for a moment.  \"Say,\" he demanded at last, \"how did you come to know so much, Bobbie?\"  \"What? Oh, about sugar? I don't know much. I just happen to remember a few scraps Father has told me from time to time. He's in the sugar business, you know.\"  \"Really? No, I didn't know. You never said anything about it. Cane-sugar?\"  \"Yes.\" Bob watched Van curiously.  \"That's odd.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Oh, because my father is in the sugar business too. Don't you recall my telling your father so? Yes, my dad makes beet sugar.\"  \"Then that's how my father happened to know your father!\" exclaimed Bob quickly. \"I suppose they're business friends. I've been wondering why Father kept watching you. Probably he sees in you some resemblance to your father. Do you look like him?\"  \"I hardly know. Some people think I do. My mother says so,\" was Van's indifferent response. \"But say, tell me more about sugar. You'd think with my father right in the business I'd know something about it; but I don't. Do they get sugar from anything beside beets, and sugar-cane, and maple sap?\"  \"Oh, my, yes. There's sugar in ever so many other things: in grapes, and milk, and the date palm, and in maize; but it is from the beet and cane that the most sugar can be extracted.\"  Van nodded.  \"You're quite a lecturer, Bobbie,\" he said. \"Wait until I get back home and astonish my father with all this knowledge. I'll make his eyes stick out.\"  Van broke into"]]]
