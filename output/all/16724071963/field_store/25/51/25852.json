FAUSTUS. Valdes, as resolute am I in this      As thou to live:  therefore object it not.       CORNELIUS. The miracles that magic will perform      Will make thee vow to study nothing else.      He that is grounded in astrology,      Enrich'd with tongues, well seen in minerals,      Hath all the principles magic doth require:      Then doubt not, Faustus, but to be renowm'd, [23]      And more frequented for this mystery      Than heretofore the Delphian oracle.      The spirits tell me they can dry the sea,      And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks,      Yea, all the wealth that our forefathers hid      Within the massy entrails of the earth:      Then tell me, Faustus, what shall we three want?       FAUSTUS. Nothing, Cornelius.  O, this cheers my soul!      Come, shew me some demonstrations magical,      That I may conjure in some bushy grove,      And have these joys in full possession.       VALDES. Then haste thee to some solitary grove,      And bear wise Bacon's and Albertus' [24] works,      The Hebrew Psalter, and New Testament;      And whatsoever else is requisite      We will inform thee ere our conference cease.       CORNELIUS. Valdes, first let him know the words of art;      And then, all other ceremonies learn'd,      Faustus may try his cunning by himself.       VALDES. First I'll instruct thee in the rudiments,      And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.       FAUSTUS. Then come and dine with me, and, after meat,      We'll canvass every quiddity thereof;      For, ere I sleep, I'll try what I can do:      This night I'll conjure, though I die therefore.           [Exeunt.]            Enter two SCHOLARS.       FIRST SCHOLAR. I wonder what's become of Faustus, that was wont      to make our schools ring with sic probo.       SECOND SCHOLAR. That shall we presently know; here comes his boy.            Enter WAGNER.       FIRST SCHOLAR. How now, sirrah! where's thy master?       WAGNER. God in heaven knows.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Why, dost not thou know, then?       WAGNER. Yes, I know; but that follows not.       FIRST SCHOLAR. Go to, sirrah! leave your jesting, and tell us      where he is.       WAGNER. That follows not by force of argument, which you, being      licentiates, should stand upon:  therefore acknowledge your      error, and be attentive.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Then you will not tell us?       WAGNER. You are deceived, for I will tell you:  yet, if you were      not dunces, you would never ask me such a question; for is he not      corpus naturale? and is not that mobile? then wherefore should      you ask me such a question?  But that I am by nature phlegmatic,      slow to wrath, and prone to lechery (to love, I would say), it      were not for you to come within forty foot of the place of      execution, although I do not doubt but to see you both hanged      the next sessions.  Thus having triumphed over you, I will set      my countenance like a precisian, and begin to speak thus:--      Truly, my dear brethren, my master is within at dinner, with      Valdes and Cornelius, as this wine, if it could speak, would      inform your worships:  and so, the Lord bless you, preserve you,      and keep you, my dear brethren!           [Exit.]       FIRST SCHOLAR. O Faustus!      Then I fear that which I have long suspected,      That thou art fall'n into that [25] damned art      For which they two are infamous through the world.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Were he a stranger, not allied to me,      The danger of his soul would make me mourn.      But, come, let us go and inform the Rector:      It may be his grave counsel may reclaim him. [26]       FIRST SCHOLAR. I fear me nothing will reclaim him now.       SECOND SCHOLAR. Yet let us see what we can do.           [Exeunt.]            Enter FAUSTUS. [27]       FAUSTUS. Now that the gloomy shadow of the night,      Longing to view Orion's drizzling look,      Leaps from th' antartic world unto the sky,      And dims the welkin with her [28] pitchy breath,      Faustus, begin thine incantations,      And try if devils will obey thy hest,      Seeing thou hast pray'd and sacrific'd to them.      Within this circle is Jehovah's name,      Forward and backward anagrammatiz'd,      Th' abbreviated names of holy saints,      Figures of every adjunct to the heavens,      And characters of signs and erring [29] stars,      By which the spirits are enforc'd to rise:      Then fear not, Faustus, to be resolute,      And try the utmost magic can perform.           [Thunder.]      Sint mihi dii Acherontis propitii!  Valeat numen triplex Jehovoe!      Ignei, aerii, aquatani spiritus, salvete!  Orientis princeps      Belzebub, inferni ardentis monarcha, et Demogorgon, propitiamus      vos, ut appareat et surgat Mephistophilis Dragon, quod tumeraris: [30]      per Jehovam, Gehennam, et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo,      signumque crucis quod nunc facio, et per vota nostra, ipse nunc      surgat nobis dicatus [31] Mephistophilis!            Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.       I charge thee to return, and change thy shape;      Thou art too ugly to attend on me:      Go, and return an old Franciscan friar;      That holy shape becomes a devil best.           [Exit MEPHISTOPHILIS.]       I see there's virtue in my heavenly words.      Who would not be proficient in this art?      How pliant is this Mephistophilis,      Full of obedience and humility!      Such is the force of magic and my spells.            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS like a Franciscan friar.       MEPHIST. Now, Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?       FAUSTUS. I charge thee wait upon me whilst I live,      To do whatever Faustus shall command,      Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere,      Or the ocean to overwhelm the world.       MEPHIST. I am a servant to great Lucifer,      And may not follow thee without his leave:      No more than he commands must we perform.       FAUSTUS. Did not he charge thee to appear to me?       MEPHIST. No, I came hither [32] of mine own accord.       FAUSTUS. Did not my conjuring speeches [33] raise thee? speak!       MEPHIST. That was the cause, but yet per accidens; [34]      For, when we hear one rack the name of God,      Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ,      We fly, in hope to get his glorious soul;      Nor will we come, unless he use such means      Whereby he is in danger to be damn'd.      Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring      Is stoutly to abjure all godliness,      And pray devoutly to the prince of hell.       FAUSTUS. So Faustus hath      Already done; and holds this principle,      There is no chief but only Belzebub;      To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself.      This word \"damnation\" terrifies not me,      For I confound hell in Elysium:      My ghost be with the old philosophers!      But, leaving these vain trifles of men's souls,      Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord?       MEPHIST. Arch-regent and commander of all spirits.       FAUSTUS. Was not that Lucifer an angel once?       MEPHIST. Yes, Faustus, and most dearly lov'd of God.       FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that he is prince of devils?       MEPHIST. O, by aspiring pride and insolence;      For which God threw him from the face of heaven.       FAUSTUS. And what are you that live with Lucifer?       MEPHIST. Unhappy spirits that fell [35] with Lucifer,      Conspir'd against our God with Lucifer,      And are for ever damn'd with Lucifer.       FAUSTUS. Where are you damn'd?       MEPHIST. In hell.       FAUSTUS. How comes it, then, that thou art out of hell?       MEPHIST. Why, this is hell, nor am I out of it:      Think'st thou that I, that saw the face of God,      And tasted the eternal joys of heaven,      Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,      In being depriv'd of everlasting bliss?      O, Faustus, leave these frivolous demands,      Which strike [36] a terror to my fainting soul!       FAUSTUS. What, is great Mephistophilis so passionate      For being deprived of the joys of heaven?      Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude,      And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess.      Go bear these tidings to great Lucifer:      Seeing Faustus hath incurr'd eternal death      By desperate thoughts against Jove's deity,      Say, he surrenders up to him his soul,      So he will spare him four and twenty years,      Letting him live in all voluptuousness;      Having thee ever to attend on me,      To give me whatsoever I shall ask,      To tell me whatsoever I demand,      To slay mine enemies, and to aid my friends,      And always be obedient to my will.      Go, and return to mighty Lucifer,      And meet me in my study at midnight,      And then resolve me of thy master's mind.       MEPHIST. I will, Faustus.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. Had I as many souls as there be stars,      I'd give them all for Mephistophilis.      By him I'll be great emperor of the world,      And make a bridge thorough [37] the moving air,      To pass the ocean with a band of men;      I'll join the hills that bind the Afric shore,      And make that country continent to Spain,      And both contributary to my crown:      The Emperor shall not live but by my leave,      Nor any potentate of Germany.      Now that I have obtain'd what I desir'd,      I'll live in speculation of this art,      Till Mephistophilis return again.           [Exit.]            Enter WAGNER and CLOWN.       WAGNER. Come hither, sirrah boy.       CLOWN. Boy!  O, disgrace to my person! zounds, boy in your face!      You have seen many boys with beards, I am sure.       WAGNER. Sirrah, [38] hast thou no comings in?       CLOWN. Yes, and goings out too, you may see, sir.       WAGNER. Alas, poor slave! see how poverty jests in his nakedness!

CLOWN. Not so neither:  I had need to have it well roasted, and      good sauce to it, if I pay so dear, I can tell you.       WAGNER. Sirrah, wilt thou be my man, and wait on me, and I will      make thee go like Qui mihi discipulus?       CLOWN. What, in verse?       WAGNER. No, slave; in beaten silk and staves-acre.       CLOWN. Staves-acre! that's good to kill vermin:  then, belike,      if I serve you, I shall be lousy.       WAGNER. Why, so thou shalt be, whether thou dost it or no; for,      sirrah, if thou dost not presently bind thyself to me for seven      years, I'll turn all the lice about thee into familiars, and make      them tear thee in pieces.       CLOWN. Nay, sir, you may save [39] yourself a labour, for they      are as familiar with me as if they paid for their meat and drink,      I can tell you.       WAGNER. Well, sirrah, leave your jesting, and take these guilders.           [Gives money.]       CLOWN. Yes, marry, sir; and I thank you too.       WAGNER. So, now thou art to be at an hour's warning, whensoever      and wheresoever the devil shall fetch thee.       CLOWN. Here, take your guilders again; [40] I'll none of 'em.       WAGNER. Not I; thou art pressed:  prepare thyself, or [41] I will      presently raise up two devils to carry thee away.--Banio!  Belcher!       CLOWN. Belcher! an Belcher come here, I'll belch him:  I am not      afraid of a devil.            Enter two DEVILS.       WAGNER. How now, sir! will you serve me now?       CLOWN. Ay, good Wagner; take away the devil[s], then.       WAGNER. Spirits, away!           [Exeunt DEVILS.]      Now, sirrah, follow me.       CLOWN. I will, sir:  but hark you, master; will you teach me this      conjuring occupation?       WAGNER. Ay, sirrah, I'll teach thee to turn thyself to a dog,      or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat, or any thing.       CLOWN. A dog, or a cat, or a mouse, or a rat!      O, brave, Wagner!       WAGNER. Villain, call me Master Wagner, and see that you walk      attentively, and let your right eye be always diametrally fixed      upon my left heel, that thou mayst quasi vestigiis nostris [42]      insistere.       CLOWN. Well, sir, I warrant you.           [Exeunt.]            FAUSTUS discovered in his study.       FAUSTUS. Now, Faustus,      Must thou needs be damn'd, canst thou not be sav'd.      What boots it, then, to think on God or heaven?      Away with such vain fancies, and despair;      Despair in God, and trust in Belzebub:      Now, go not backward, [43] Faustus; be resolute:      Why [44] waver'st thou?  O, something soundeth in mine ear,      \"Abjure this magic, turn to God again!\"      Why, he loves thee not;      The god thou serv'st is thine own appetite,      Wherein is fix'd the love of Belzebub:      To him I'll build an altar and a church,      And offer lukewarm blood of new-born babes.            Enter GOOD ANGEL and EVIL ANGEL.       EVIL ANGEL. Go forward, Faustus, in that famous [45] art.       GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, leave that execrable art.       FAUSTUS. Contrition, prayer, repentance--what of [46] these?       GOOD ANGEL. O, they are means to bring thee unto heaven!       EVIL ANGEL. Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy,      That make men [47] foolish that do use them most.       GOOD ANGEL. Sweet Faustus, think of heaven and heavenly things.       EVIL ANGEL. No, Faustus; think of honour and of wealth.           [Exeunt ANGELS.]       FAUSTUS. Wealth!      Why, the signiory of Embden shall be mine.      When Mephistophilis shall stand by me,      What power can hurt me?  Faustus, thou art safe:      Cast no more doubts.--Mephistophilis, come,      And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--      Is't not midnight?--come Mephistophilis,      And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer;--      Is't not midnight?--come Mephistophilis,      Veni, veni, Mephistophile! [48]            Enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.       Now tell me what saith Lucifer, thy lord?       MEPHIST. That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives,      So he will buy my service with his soul.       FAUSTUS. Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee.       MEPHIST. But now thou must bequeath it solemnly,      And write a deed of gift with thine own blood;      For that security craves Lucifer.      If thou deny it, I must back to hell.       FAUSTUS. Stay, Mephistophilis, and tell me, what good will my      soul do thy lord?       MEPHIST. Enlarge his kingdom.       FAUSTUS. Is that the reason why he tempts us thus?       MEPHIST. Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris.       FAUSTUS. Why, have you any pain that torture others?       MEPHIST. As great as have the human souls of men.      But, tell me, Faustus, shall I have thy soul?      And I will be thy slave, and wait on thee,      And give thee more than thou hast wit to ask.       FAUSTUS. Ay, Mephistophilis, I'll give it thee. [49]       MEPHIST. Then, Faustus, stab thine [50] arm courageously,      And bind thy soul, that at some certain day      Great Lucifer may claim it as his own;      And [51] then be thou as great as Lucifer.       FAUSTUS. [Stabbing his arm] Lo, Mephistophilis, for love of thee,      Faustus hath cut his arm, and with his proper blood      Assures his soul to be great Lucifer's,      Chief lord and regent of perpetual night!      View here this blood that trickles from mine arm,      And let it be propitious for my [52] wish.       MEPHIST. But, Faustus,      Write it in manner of a deed of gift.       FAUSTUS. [Writing] Ay, so I do.  But, Mephistophilis,      My blood congeals, and I can write no more.       MEPHIST. I'll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight.           [Exit.]       FAUSTUS. What might the staying of my blood portend?      Is it [53] unwilling I should write this bill?      Why streams it not, that I may write afresh?      FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL:  O, there it stay'd!      Why shouldst thou not? is not thy soul thine own?      Then write again, FAUSTUS GIVES TO THEE HIS SOUL. [54]            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS with the chafer of fire.       MEPHIST. See, Faustus, here is fire; set it on.       FAUSTUS. So, now the blood begins to clear again;      Now will I make an [55] end immediately.           [Writes.]       MEPHIST. What will not I do to obtain his soul?           [Aside.]       FAUSTUS. Consummatum est; this bill is ended,      And Faustus hath bequeath'd his soul to Lucifer.      But what is this inscription on mine arm?      Homo, fuge:  whither should [56] I fly?      If unto God, [57] he'll throw me down to hell.      My senses are deceiv'd; here's nothing writ:--      O, yes, I see it plain; even here is writ,      Homo, fuge:  yet shall not Faustus fly.       MEPHIST. I'll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind.           [Aside, and then exit.]            Enter DEVILS, giving crowns and rich apparel to FAUSTUS.           They dance, and then depart.            Re-enter MEPHISTOPHILIS.       FAUSTUS. What means this show? speak, Mephistophilis.       MEPHIST. Nothing, Faustus, but to delight thy mind,      And let thee see what magic can perform.       FAUSTUS. But may I raise such spirits when I please?       MEPHIST. Ay, Faustus, and do greater things than these.       FAUSTUS. Then, Mephistophilis, receive this scroll, [58]      A deed of gift of body and of soul:      But yet conditionally that thou perform      All covenants and articles between us both!       MEPHIST. Faustus, I swear by hell and Lucifer      To effect all promises between us both!       FAUSTUS. Then hear me read it, Mephistophilis.           [Reads.]      ON THESE CONDITIONS FOLLOWING.  FIRST, THAT FAUSTUS MAY BE A      SPIRIT IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE.  SECONDLY, THAT MEPHISTOPHILIS      SHALL BE HIS SERVANT, AND BE BY HIM COMMANDED.  THIRDLY, THAT      MEPHISTOPHILIS SHALL DO FOR HIM, AND BRING HIM WHATSOEVER HE      DESIRES. [59]  FOURTHLY, THAT HE SHALL BE IN HIS CHAMBER OR HOUSE      INVISIBLE.  LASTLY, THAT HE SHALL APPEAR TO THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS,      AT ALL TIMES, IN WHAT SHAPE AND FORM SOEVER HE PLEASE.  I, JOHN      FAUSTUS, OF WITTENBERG, DOCTOR, BY THESE PRESENTS, DO GIVE BOTH      BODY AND SOUL TO LUCIFER PRINCE OF THE EAST, AND HIS MINISTER      MEPHISTOPHILIS; AND FURTHERMORE GRANT UNTO THEM, THAT, FOUR-AND-      TWENTY YEARS BEING EXPIRED, AND THESE ARTICLES ABOVE-WRITTEN      BEING INVIOLATE, FULL POWER TO FETCH OR CARRY THE SAID JOHN FAUSTUS,      BODY AND SOUL, FLESH AND [60] BLOOD, INTO THEIR HABITATION WHERESOEVER.      BY ME, JOHN FAUSTUS.       MEPHIST. Speak, Faustus, do you deliver this as your deed?       FAUSTUS. Ay, take it, and the devil give thee good of it!       MEPHIST. So, now, Faustus, ask me what thou wilt.       FAUSTUS. First I will question with [61] thee about hell.      Tell me, where is the [62] place that men call hell?       MEPHIST. Under the heavens.       FAUSTUS. Ay, so are all things else; but whereabouts?       MEPHIST. Within the bowels of these elements,      Where we are tortur'd and remain for ever:      Hell hath no limits, nor is circumscrib'd      In one self-place; but where we are is hell,      And where hell is, there must we ever be:      And, to be short, when all the world dissolves,      And every creature shall be purified,      All places shall be hell that are [63] not heaven.       FAUSTUS. I think hell's a fable. [64]       MEPHIST. Ay, think so still, till experience change thy mind.       FAUSTUS. Why, dost thou think that Faustus shall be damn'd?       MEPHIST. Ay, of necessity, for here's the scroll      In which thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer.       FAUSTUS. Ay, and body too; and what of that?      Think'st thou that Faustus is so fond to imagine      That, after this life, there is any pain?      No, these are trifles and mere old wives' tales.       MEPHIST. But I am an instance"]]]
