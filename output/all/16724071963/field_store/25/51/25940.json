Look round you and see how everywhere earnest and godly ministers have sprung up, of all sects and opinions, as well as of the Church of England, not only to preach the gospel in the pulpit, but to carry it to the sick bedside of the lonely cottage, to the prison, and to those fearful sties, worse than prisons, where in our great cities the heathen poor live crowded together.  Look at the teaching which the poor man can get now, compared to what he used to—the sermons, the Bibles, the tracts, the lending libraries, the schools—just consider the hundreds of thousands of pounds which are subscribed every year to educate the children of the poor, and then say whether Christ is not working a mighty work among us in these days.  I know that not half as much is done as ought to be done in that way; not half as much as will be done; and what is done will have to be done better than it has been done yet; but still, can anyone in this church who is fifty years old deny that there is a most enormous and blessed improvement which is growing and spreading every year?  Can anyone deny that the gospel is preached to the poor now in a way that it never was before within the memory of man?  Now, recollect that this is an Advent sermon—a sermon which proclaims to you that Christ is _come_; yes, He is come—come never to leave mankind again!  Christ reigns over the earth, and will reign for ever.  At certain great and important times in the world’s history, like this present time, times which He Himself calls “days of the Lord,” He shows forth His power, and the mightiness and mercy of His kingdom, more than at others.  But still He is always with us; we have no need to run up and down to look for Christ: to say, Who shall ascend into heaven to bring Him down?  Who shall descend into the deep to bring Him up?  For the kingdom of God, as He told us Himself, is among us, and within us.  Yes, within us.  All these wonderful improvements and discoveries, all things beneficial to men which are found out year by year, though they seem to be of men’s invention, are really of Christ’s revealing, the fruits of the kingdom of God within us, of the Spirit of God, who is teaching men, though they too often will not believe it; though they disclaim God’s Spirit and take all the glory to themselves.  Truly Christ is among us; and our eyes are held, and we see Him not.  That is our English sin—the sin of unbelief, the root of every other sin.  Christ works among us, and we will not own Him.  Truly, Jesus Christ may well say of us English at this day, There were ten cleansed, but where are the nine?  How few are there, who return to give glory to God!  Oh, consider what I say; the kingdom of God is among us now; its blessings are growing richer, fuller among us every day.  Beware, lest if we refuse to acknowledge that kingdom and Christ the King of it, it be taken away from us, and given to some other nation, who will bring forth the fruits of it, fellow-help and brotherly kindness, purity and sobriety, and all the fruits of the Spirit of God.     IV. A PREPARATION FOR CHRISTMAS.                            FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT.                  Rejoice in the Lord always.—PHILIPPIANS iv. 4.  THIS is the beginning of the Epistle for to-day, the Sunday before Christmas.  We will try to find out why it was chosen for to-day, and what lesson we may learn from it.  Now Christmas-time was always a time of rejoicing among many heathen nations, and long before the Lord Jesus Christ came.  That was natural and reasonable enough, if you will consider it.  For now the shortest day is past.  The sun is just beginning to climb higher and higher in the sky each day, and bring back with him longer sunshine, and shorter darkness, and spring flowers, and summer crops, and a whole new year, with new hopes, new work, new lessons, new blessings.  The old year, with all its labours and all its pleasures, and all its sorrows and all its sins, is dying, all but gone.  It lies behind us, never to return.  The tears which we shed, we never can shed again.  The mistakes we made, we have a chance of mending in the year to come.  And so the heathens felt, and rejoiced that another year was dying, another year going to be born.  And Christmas was a time of rejoicing too, because the farming work was done.  The last year’s crop was housed; the next year’s wheat was sown; the cattle were safe in yard and stall; and men had time to rest, and draw round the fire in the long winter nights, and make merry over the earnings of the past year, and the hopes and plans of the year to come. And so over all this northern half of the world Christmas was a merry time.  But the poor heathens did not know the Lord.  They did not know who to thank for all their Christmas blessings.  And so some used to thank the earth for the crops, and the sun for coming back again to lengthen the days, as if the earth and sun moved of themselves.  And some used to thank false gods and ancient heroes, who, perhaps, never really lived at all.  And some, perhaps the greater number, thanked nothing and no one, but just enjoyed themselves, and took no thought, as too many do now at Christmas-time.  So the world went on, Christmas after Christmas; and the times of that ignorance, as St. Paul says, God winked at.  But when the fulness of time was come, He sent forth His Son, made of a woman, to be the judge and ruler of the world; and commanded all men everywhere to repent, and turn from all their vanities to serve the living God, who had made heaven and earth, and all things in them.  He did not wish them to give up their Christmas mirth.  No: all along He had been trying to teach them by it about His love to them.  As St. Paul told them once, God had not left Himself without witness, in that He gave them rain and fruitful seasons, filling their hearts with joy and gladness.  God did not wish them, or us, to give up Christmas mirth.  The apostles did not wish it.  The great men, true followers of the apostles, who shaped our Prayer-book for us, and sealed it with their life-blood, did not wish it.  They did not wish farmers, labourers, servants, masters, to give up one of the old Christmas customs; but to remember who made Christmas, and its blessings; in short, to rejoice in The Lord.  Our forefathers had been thanking the wrong persons for Christmas. Henceforward we were to thank the right person, The Lord, and rejoice in Him.  Our forefathers had been rejoicing in the sun, and moon, and earth; in wise and valiant kings who had lived ages before; in their own strength, and industry, and cunning.  Now they were to rejoice in Him who made sun, and moon, and earth; in Him who sent wise and valiant kings and leaders; in Him who gives all strength, and industry, and cunning; by whose inspiration comes all knowledge of agriculture, and manufacture, and all the arts which raise men above the beasts that perish.  So their Christmas joys were to go on, year by year while the world lasted: but they were to go on rightly, and not wrongly.  Men were to rejoice in The Lord, and then His blessing would be on them, and the thanks and praise which they offered Him, He would return with interest, in fresh blessings for the coming year.  Therefore, I think, this Epistle was chosen for to-day, the Sunday before Christmas, to show us in whom we are to rejoice; and, therefore, to show us how we are to rejoice.  For we must not take the first verse of the Epistle and forget the rest.  That would neither be wise nor reverent toward St. Paul, who wrote the whole, and meant the whole to stand together as one discourse; or to the blessed and holy men who chose it for our lesson on this day.  Let us go on, then, with the Epistle, line by line, throughout.  “Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, rejoice.”  As much as to say, you cannot rejoice too much, you cannot overdo your happiness, thankfulness, merriment.  You do not know half—no, not the thousandth part of God’s love and mercy to you, and you never will know.  So do not be afraid of being too happy, or think that you honour God by wearing a sour face, when He is heaping blessings on you, and calling on you to smile and sing.  But “let your moderation be known unto all men.”  There is a right and a wrong way of being merry.  There is a mirth, which is no mirth; whereof it is written, in the midst of that laughter there is a heaviness, and the end thereof is death.  Drunkenness, gluttony, indecent words and jests and actions, these are out of place on Christmas-day, and in the merriment to which the pure and holy Lord Jesus calls you all. They are rejoicing in the flesh and the devil, and not in the Lord at all; and whosoever indulges in them, and fancies them merriment, is keeping the devil’s Christmas, and not Jesus Christ’s.  So let your moderation be known to all men.  Be _merry and wise_.  The fool lets his mirth master him, and carry him away, till he forgets himself, and says and does things of which he is ashamed when he gets up next morning, sick and sad at heart.  The wise man remembers that, let the occasion be as joyful a one as it may, “the Lord is at hand.”  Christ’s eye is on him, while he is eating, and drinking, and laughing.  He is not afraid of Christ’s eye, because, though it is Divine it is a human, loving, smiling eye; rejoicing in the happiness of His poor, hard-worked brothers here below.  But he remembers that it is a holy eye, too; an eye which looks with sadness and horror on anything which is wrong; on all drunkenness, quarrelling, indecency; and so on in all his merriment, he is still master of himself.  He remembers that his soul is nobler than his body; that his will must be stronger than his appetite; and so he keeps himself in check; he keeps his tongue from evil, and his stomach from sottishness, and though he may be, and ought to be, the merriest of the whole party, yet"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8202"],["title","Sermons on National Subjects (#6)"],["body"," takes care to let his moderation, his sobriety, be known and plain to everyone, remembering that the Lord is at hand.  And that man—I will stand surety for him—will be the one who will rise from his bed next morning, best able to carry out the next verse of the Epistle, and “be careful for nothing.”  Now that is no easy matter here in England; to rich and poor, Christmas is the time for settling accounts and paying debts.  And therefore in England, where living is dear, and everyone, more or less, struggling to pay his way, Christmas is often a very anxious, disturbing time of year. Many a family, for all their economy, cannot clear themselves at the year’s end; and though they are able to forget that now and then, thank God, through great part of the year, yet they cannot forget it at Christmas.  But, as I said, the man who at Christmas-time will be most able to be careful for nothing, will be the man whose moderation has been known to everyone; for he will, if he has lived the year through in the same temper in which he has spent Christmas, have been moderate in his expenses; he will have kept himself from empty show, and pretending to be richer than he is.  He will have kept himself from throwing away his money in drink, and kept his daughters from throwing away money in dress, which is just what too many, in their foolish, godless, indecent hurry to get rid of their own children off their hands do not do.  And he will be the man who will be in the best humour, and have the clearest brain, to kneel down when he gets up to his daily work, and “in everything, by prayer and supplication, make his requests known to God.” And then, whether he can make both ends meet or not, whether he can begin next year free from debt or not, still “the peace of God will keep his heart.”  He may be unable to clear himself, but still he will know that he has a loving and merciful Father in heaven, who has allowed distress and difficulty to come on him only as a lesson and an education.  That this distress came because God chose, and that when God chooses it will go away—and that till then—considering that the Lord God sent it—it had better _not_ go away.  He will believe that God’s gracious promises stand true—that the Lord will never let those who trust in Him be confounded and brought to shame—that He will let none of us be tempted beyond what we are able, but will always with the temptation make a way for us to escape, that we may be able to bear it.  And so the peace of God which passes understanding, will keep that man’s mind.  And in whom?  “In Jesus Christ.”  Now what did St. Paul mean by putting in the Lord Jesus Christ’s name there? what is the meaning of “in Jesus Christ”?  This is what it means; it means what Christmas-day means.  A man may say, “Your sermon promises fine things, but I am miserable and poor; it promises a holy and noble rejoicing to everyone, but I am unholy and mean.  It promises peace from God, and I am sure I am not at peace: I am always fretting and quarrelling; I quarrel with my wife, my children, and my neighbours, and they quarrel with me; and worst of all,” says the poor man, “I quarrel with myself.  I am full of discontented, angry, sulky, anxious, unhappy thoughts; my heart is dark and sad and restless within me—would God I were peaceful, but I am not: look in my face and see!”  True, my friend, but on Christmas-day the Son of God was born into the world, a man like you.  “Well,” says the poor man, “but what has that to do with my anxiety and my ill-temper?”  It would take the whole year through, my friend, to show you all that it has to do with you and your unhappiness.  All the Lessons, Epistles, and Gospels of the year are set out to show you what it has to do with you. But in the meanwhile, before Christmas-day comes, consider this one thing: Why are you anxious?  Because you do not know what is to happen to you?  Then Christmas-day is a witness to you, that whatsoever happens to you, happens to you by the will and rule of Jesus Christ, The perfect man; think of that.  _The perfect man_—who understands men’s hearts and wants, and all that is good for them, and has all the wisdom and power to give us what is good, which we want ourselves.  And what makes you unhappy, my friends?  Is it not at heart just this one thing—you are unhappy because you are not pleased with yourselves?  And you are not pleased with yourselves because you know you ought not to be pleased with yourselves; and you know you ought not to be pleased with yourselves, because you know, in the bottom of your hearts, that God is not pleased with you?  What cure, what comfort for such thoughts can we find?—This.  The child who was born in a manger on Christmas-day, and grew up in poverty, and had not where to lay his head, went through all shame and sorrow to which man is heir.  He, Jesus, the poor child of Bethlehem, is Lord and King of heaven and earth.  He will feel for us; He will understand our temptations; He has been poor himself, that He might feel for the poor; He has been evil spoken of, that He might feel for those whose tempers are sorely tried.  He bore the sins and felt the miseries of the whole world, that He might feel for us when we are wearied with the burden of life, and confounded by the remembrance of our own sins.  Oh, my friends, consider only Who was born into the world on Christmas-day; and that thought alone will be enough to fill you with rejoicing and hope for yourselves and all the world, and with the peace of God which passes understanding, the peace which the angels proclaimed to the shepherds on the first Christmas night—“On earth peace, and good will toward men”—and if God wills us good, my friend; what matter who wishes us evil?     V. CHRISTMAS-DAY.       He made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a     slave.—PHILIPPIANS ii. 7.  ON Christmas-day, 1851 years ago, if we had been at Rome, the great capital city, and mistress of the whole world, we should have seen a strange sight—strange, and yet pleasant.  All the courts of law were shut; no war was allowed to be proclaimed, and no criminals punished. The sorrow and the strife of that great city had stopped, in great part, for three days, and all people were giving themselves up to merriment and good cheer—making up quarrels, and giving and receiving presents from house to house.  And we should have seen, too, a pleasanter sight than that.  For those three days of Christmas-time were days of safety and merriment for the poor slaves—tens of thousands of whom—men, women, and children—the Romans had brought out of all the countries in the world—many of our forefathers and mothers among them—and kept them there in cruel bondage and shame, worked and fed, bought and sold, like beasts, and not like human beings, not able to call their lives or their bodies their own, forced to endure any shame or sin which their tyrants required of them, and liable any moment to be beaten, tortured, or crucified at the mercy of cruel and foul masters and mistresses.  But on that Christmas-day, according to an old custom, they were allowed for once in the whole year to play at being free, to dress in their masters’ and mistresses’ clothes, to say what they thought of them boldly, without fear of punishment, and to eat and drink at their masters’ tables, while their masters and mistresses waited on them.  It was an old custom, that, among the heathen Romans, which their forefathers, who were wiser and better than they, had handed down to them.  They had forgotten, perhaps, what it meant: but still we may see what it must have meant: That the old forefathers of the Romans had intended to remind their children every year by that custom, that their poor hard-worked slaves were, after all, men and women as much as their masters; that they had hearts and consciences, and sense in them, and a right to speak what they thought, as much as their masters; that they, as much as their masters, could enjoy the good things of God’s earth, from which man’s tyranny had shut them out; and to remind those cruel masters, by making them once every year wait on their own slaves at table, that they were, after all, equal in the sight of God, and that it was more noble for those who were rich, and called themselves gentlemen, to help others, than to make others slave for them.  I do not mean, of course, that those old heathens understood all this clearly.  You will see, by the latter part of my sermon, why they could not understand it clearly.  But there must have been some sort of dim, confused suspicion in their minds that it was wrong and cruel to treat human beings like brute beasts, which made them set up that strange old custom of letting their slaves play at being free once every Christmas-tide.  But if on this same day, 1851 years ago, instead of being in the great city of Rome, we had been in the little village of Bethlehem in Judæa, we might have seen a sight stranger still; a sight which we could not have fancied had anything to do with that merrymaking of the slaves at Rome, and yet which had everything to do with it.  We should have seen, in a mean stable, among the oxen and the asses, a poor maiden, with her newborn baby laid in the manger, for want of any better cradle, and by her her husband, a poor carpenter, whom all men thought to be the father of her child. . . .  There, in the stable, amid the straw, through the cold winter days and nights, in want of many a comfort which the poorest woman, and the poorest woman’s child would need, they stayed there, that young maiden and her newborn babe.  That young maiden was the Blessed Virgin Mary, and that poor baby was the Son of God.  The Son of God, in whose likeness all men were made at the beginning; the Son of God, who had been ruling the whole world all along; who brought the Jews out of slavery, a thousand years before, and destroyed their cruel tyrants in the Red Sea; the Son of God, who had"]]]
