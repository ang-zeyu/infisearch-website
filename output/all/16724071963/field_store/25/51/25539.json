Gandrin, I guess this pineapple is English,--it is superb.\"  \"You are right,--a present from the Marquis of H-------.\"  \"Ah!  instead of a fee, I wager.  The Marquis gives nothing for nothing, dear man!  Droll people the English.  You have never visited England, I presume, _cher_ Rochebriant?\"  The affable financier had already made vast progress in familiarity with his silent fellow-guest.  When the dinner was over and the three men had reentered the salon for coffee and liqueurs, Gandrin left Louvier and Alain alone, saying he was going to his cabinet for cigars which he could recommend.  Then Louvier, lightly patting the Marquis on the shoulder, said with what the French call effusion, \"My dear Rochebriant, your father and I did not quite understand each other.  He took a tone of grand seigneur that sometimes wounded me; and I in turn was perhaps too rude in asserting my rights--as creditor, shall I say?--no, as fellow-citizen; and Frenchmen are so vain, so over-susceptible; fire up at a word; take offence when none is meant. We two, my dear boy, should be superior to such national foibles. _Bref_ --I have a mortgage on your lands.  Why should that thought mar our friendship?  At my age, though I am not yet old, one is flattered if the young like us, pleased if we can oblige them, and remove from their career any little obstacle in its way.  Gandrin tells me you wish to consolidate all the charges on your estate into one on a lower rate of interest.  Is it so?\"  \"I am so advised,\" said the Marquis.  \"And very rightly advised; come and talk with me about it some day next week.  I hope to have a large sum of money set free in a few days.  Of course, mortgages on land don't pay like speculations at the Bourse; but I am rich enough to please myself.  We will see, we will see.\"  Here Gandrin returned with the cigars; but Alain at that time never smoked, and Louvier excused himself, with a laugh and a sly wink, on the plea that he was going to pay his respects--as doubtless that _joli garcon_ was going to do likewise--to a belle dame who did not reckon the smell of tobacco among the perfumes of Houbigant or Arabia.  \"Meanwhile,\" added Louvier, turning to Gandrin, \"I have something to say to you on business about the contract for that new street of mine.  No hurry,--after our young friend has gone to his 'assignation.'\"  Alain could not misinterpret the hint; and in a few moments took leave of his host, more surprised than disappointed that the financier had not invited him, as Graham had assumed he would, to his soiree the following evening.  When Alain was gone, Louvier's jovial manner disappeared also, and became bluffly rude rather than bluntly cordial.  \"Gandrin, what did you mean by saying that that young man was no _muscadin_! _Muscadin, aristocrate_, offensive from top to toe.\"  \"You amaze me; you seemed to take to him so cordially.\"  \"And pray, were you too blind to remark with what cold reserve he responded to my condescensions; how he winced when I called him Rochebriant; how he coloured when I called him 'dear boy'?  These aristocrats think we ought to thank them on our knees when they take our money, and\" here Louvier's face darkened--\"seduce our women.\"  \"Monsieur Louvier, in all France I do not know a greater aristocrat than yourself.\"  I don't know whether M. Gandrin meant that speech as a compliment, but M. Louvier took it as such,--laughed complacently and rubbed his hands. \"Ay, ay, _millionnaires_ are the real aristocrats, for they have power, as my _beau Marquis_ will soon find.  I must bid you good night.  Of course I shall see Madame Gandrin and yourself to-morrow.  Prepare for a motley gathering,--lots of democrats and foreigners, with artists and authors, and such creatures.\"  \"Is that the reason why you did not invite the Marquis?\"  \"To be sure; I would not shock so pure a Legitimist by contact with the sons of the people, and make him still colder to myself.  No; when he comes to my house he shall meet lions and _viveurs_ of the _haut ton_, who will play into my hands by teaching him how to ruin himself in the quickest manner and in the _genre Regence_.  _Bon soir, mon vieux._\"     CHAPTER VI.  The next night Graham in vain looked round for Alain in M. Louvier's salons, and missed his high-bred mien and melancholy countenance. M. Louvier had been for some four years a childless widower, but his receptions were not the less numerously attended, nor his establishment less magnificently monde for the absence of a presiding lady: very much the contrary; it was noticeable how much he had increased his status and prestige as a social personage since the death of his unlamented spouse.  To say truth, she had been rather a heavy drag on his triumphal car.  She had been the heiress of a man who had amassed a great deal of money,--not in the higher walks of commerce, but in a retail trade.  Louvier himself was the son of a rich money-lender; he had entered life with an ample fortune and an intense desire to be admitted into those more brilliant circles in which fortune can be dissipated with _eclat_. He might not have attained this object but for the friendly countenance of a young noble who was then--                 \"The glass of fashion and the mould of form;\"  but this young noble, of whom later we shall hear more, came suddenly to grief, and when the money-lender's son lost that potent protector, the dandies, previously so civil, showed him a very cold shoulder.  Louvier then became an ardent democrat, and recruited the fortune he had impaired by the aforesaid marriage, launched into colossal speculations, and became enormously rich.  His aspirations for social rank now revived, but his wife sadly interfered with them.  She was thrifty by nature; sympathized little with her husband's genius for accumulation; always said he would end in a hospital; hated Republicans; despised authors and artists, and by the ladies of the _beau monde_ was pronounced common and vulgar.  So long as she lived, it was impossible for Louvier to realize his ambition of having one of the salons which at Paris establish celebrity and position.  He could not then command those advantages of wealth which he especially coveted.  He was eminently successful in doing this now. As soon as she was safe in Pere la Chaise, he enlarged his hotel by the purchase and annexation of an adjoining house; redecorated and refurnished it, and in this task displayed, it must be said to his credit, or to that of the administrators he selected for the purpose, a nobleness of taste rarely exhibited nowadays.  His collection of pictures was not large, and consisted exclusively of the French school, ancient and modern, for in all things Louvier affected the patriot.  But each of those pictures was a gem; such Watteaus, such Greuzes, such landscapes by Patel, and, above all, such masterpieces by Ingres, Horace Vernet, and Delaroche were worth all the doubtful originals of Flemish and Italian art which make the ordinary boast of private collectors.  These pictures occupied two rooms of moderate size, built for their reception, and lighted from above.  The great salon to which they led contained treasures scarcely less precious; the walls were covered with the richest silks which the looms of Lyons could produce.  Every piece of furniture here was a work of art in its way: console-tables of Florentine mosaic, inlaid with pearl and lapis-lazuli; cabinets in which the exquisite designs of the Renaissance were carved in ebony; colossal vases of Russian malachite, but wrought by French artists.  The very knick- knacks scattered carelessly about the room might have been admired in the cabinets of the Palazzo Pitti.  Beyond this room lay the _salle de danse_, its ceiling painted by ------, supported by white marble columns, the glazed balcony and the angles of the room filled with tiers of exotics.  In the dining-room, on the same floor, on the other side of the landing-place, were stored in glazed buffets not only vessels and salvers of plate, silver and gold, but, more costly still, matchless specimens of Sevres and Limoges, and mediaeval varieties of Venetian glass.  On the ground-floor, which opened on the lawn of a large garden, Louvier had his suite of private apartments, furnished, as he said, \"simply, according to English notions of comfort;\"--Englishmen would have said, \"according to French notions of luxury.\"  Enough of these details, which a writer cannot give without feeling himself somewhat vulgarized in doing so, but without a loose general idea of which a reader would not have an accurate conception of something not vulgar,--of something grave, historical, possibly tragical,--the existence of a Parisian millionaire at the date of this narrative.  The evidence of wealth was everywhere manifest at M. Louvier's, but it was everywhere refined by an equal evidence of taste.  The apartments devoted to hospitality ministered to the delighted study of artists, to whom free access was given, and of whom two or three might be seen daily in the \"show-rooms,\" copying pictures or taking sketches of rare articles of furniture or effects for palatian interiors.  Among the things which rich English visitors of Paris most coveted to see was M. Louvier's hotel, and few among the richest left it without a sigh of envy and despair.  Only in such London houses as belong to a Sutherland or a Holford could our metropolis exhibit a splendour as opulent and a taste as refined.  M. Louvier had his set evenings for popular assemblies.  At these were entertained the Liberals of every shade, from tricolor to rouge, with the artists and writers most in vogue, pele-mele with decorated diplomatists, ex-ministers, Orleanists, and Republicans, distinguished foreigners, plutocrats of the Bourse, and lions male and female from the arid nurse of that race, the Chaussee d'Antin.  Of his more select reunions something will be"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7739"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 03 (#0)"],["body","PARISIANS                           By Edward Bulwer-Lytton                                   BOOK III.   CHAPTER I.  The next day the guests at the Morleys' had assembled when Vane entered. His apology for unpunctuality was cut short by the lively hostess.  \"Your pardon is granted without the humiliation of asking for it; we know that the characteristic of the English is always to be a little behindhand.\"  She then proceeded to introduce him to the American Minister, to a distinguished American poet, with a countenance striking for mingled sweetness and power, and one or two other of her countrymen sojourning at Paris; and this ceremony over, dinner was announced, and she bade Graham offer his arm to Mademoiselle Cicogna.  \"Have you ever visited the United States, Mademoiselle?\" asked Vane, as they seated themselves at the table.  \"No.\"  \"It is a voyage you are sure to make soon.\"  \"Why so?\"  \"Because report says you will create a great sensation at the very commencement of your career; and the New World is ever eager to welcome each celebrity that is achieved in the Old,--more especially that which belongs to your enchanting art.\"  \"True, sir,\" said an American senator, solemnly striking into the conversation; \"we are an appreciative people; and if that lady be as fine a singer as I am told, she might command any amount of dollars.\"  Isaura coloured, and turning to Graham, asked him in a low voice if he were fond of music.  \"I ought of course to say 'yes,' answered Graham, in the same tone; \"but I doubt if that 'yes' would be an honest one.  In some moods, music--if a kind of music I like--affects me very deeply; in other moods, not at all. And I cannot bear much at a time.  A concert wearies me shamefully; even an opera always seems to me a great deal too long.  But I ought to add that I am no judge of music; that music was never admitted into my education; and, between ourselves, I doubt if there be one Englishman in five hundred who would care for opera or concert if it were not the fashion to say he did.  Does my frankness revolt you?\"  \"On the contrary, I sometimes doubt, especially of late, if I am fond of music myself.\"  \"Signorina,--pardon me,--it is impossible that you should not be.  Genius can never be untrue to itself, and must love that in which it excels, that by which it communicates joy, and,\" he added, with a half-suppressed sigh, \"attains to glory.\"  \"Genius is a divine word, and not to be applied to a singer,\" said Isaura, with a humility in which there was an earnest sadness.  Graham was touched and startled; but before he could answer, the American Minister appealed to him across the table, asking if he had quoted accurately a passage in a speech by Graham's distinguished father, in regard to the share which England ought to take in the political affairs of Europe.  The conversation now became general, very political and very serious. Graham was drawn into it, and grew animated and eloquent.  Isaura listened to him with admiration.  She was struck by what seemed to her a nobleness of sentiment which elevated his theme above the level of commonplace polemics.  She was pleased to notice, in the attentive silence of his intelligent listeners, that they shared the effect produced on herself.  In fact, Graham Vane was a born orator, and his studies had been those of a political thinker.  In common talk he was but the accomplished man of the world, easy and frank and genial, with a touch of good-natured sarcasm; but when the subject started drew him upward to those heights in which politics become the science of humanity, he seemed a changed being.  His cheek glowed, his eye brightened, his voice mellowed into richer tones, his language be came unconsciously adorned.  In such moments there might scarcely be an audience, even differing from him in opinion, which would not have acknowledged his spell.  When the party adjourned to the salon, Isaura said softly to Graham, \"I understand why you did not cultivate music; and I think, too, that I can now understand what effects the human voice can produce on human minds without recurring to the art of song.\"  \"Ah,\" said Graham, with a pleased smile, \"do not make me ashamed of my former rudeness by the revenge of compliment; and, above all, do not disparage your own art by supposing that any prose effect of voice in its utterance of mind can interpret that which music alone can express, even to listeners so uncultured as myself.  Am I not told truly by musical composers, when I ask them to explain in words what they say in their music, that such explanation is impossible, that music has a language of its own untranslatable by words?\"  \"Yes,\" said Isaura, with thoughtful brow but brightening eyes, \"you are told truly.  It was only the other day that I was pondering over that truth.\"  \"But what recesses of mind, of heart, of soul, this untranslatable language penetrates and brightens up!  How incomplete the grand nature of man--though man the grandest--would be, if you struck out of his reason the comprehension of poetry, music, and religion!  In each are reached and are sounded deeps in his reason otherwise concealed from himself. History, knowledge, science, stop at the point in which mystery begins. There they meet with the world of shadow.  Not an inch of that world can they penetrate without the aid of poetry and religion, two necessities of intellectual man much more nearly allied than the votaries of the practical and the positive suppose.  To the aid and elevation of both those necessities comes in music, and there has never existed a religion in the world which has not demanded music as its ally.  If, as I said frankly, it is only in certain moods of my mind that I enjoy music, it is only because in certain moods of my mind I am capable of quitting the guidance of prosaic reason for the world of shadow; that I am so susceptible as at every hour, were my nature perfect, I should be to the mysterious influences of poetry and religion.  Do you understand what I wish to express?\"  \"Yes, I do, and clearly.\"  \"Then, Signorina, you are forbidden to undervalue the gift of song.  You must feel its power over the heart, when you enter the opera-house; over the soul, when you kneel in a cathedral.\"  \"Oh,\" cried Isaura, with enthusiasm, a rich glow mantling over her lovely face, \"how I thank you!  Is it you who say you do not love music?  How much better you understand it than I did till this moment!\"  Here Mrs. Morley, joined by the American poet, came to the corner in which the Englishman and the singer had niched themselves.  The poet began to talk, the other guests gathered round, and every one listened reverentially till the party broke up.  Colonel Morley handed Isaura to her carriage; the she-mountebank again fell to the lot of Graham.  \"Signor,\" said she, as he respectfully placed her shawl round her scarlet-and-gilt jacket, \"are we so far from Paris that you cannot spare the time to call?  My child does not sing in public, but at home you can hear her.  It is not every woman's voice that is sweetest at home.\"  Graham bowed, and said he would call on the morrow.  Isaura mused in silent delight over the words which had so extolled the art of the singer.  Alas, poor child! she could not guess that in those words, reconciling her to the profession of the stage, the speaker was pleading against his own heart.  There was in Graham's nature, as I think it commonly is in that of most true orators, a wonderful degree of intellectual conscience which impelled him to acknowledge the benignant influences of song, and to set before the young singer the noblest incentives to the profession to which he deemed her assuredly destined; but in so doing he must have felt that he was widening the gulf between her life and his own.  Perhaps he wished to widen it in proportion as he dreaded to listen to any voice in his heart which asked if the gulf might not be overleapt.     CHAPTER II.  ON the morrow Graham called at the villa at A------.  The two ladies received him in Isaura's chosen sitting-room.  Somehow or other, conversation at first languished.  Graham was reserved and distant, Isaura shy and embarrassed.  The Venosta had the frais of making talk to herself.  Probably at another time Graham would have been amused and interested in the observation of a character new to him, and thoroughly southern,--lovable not more from its naive simplicity of kindliness than from various little foibles and vanities, all of which were harmless, and some of them endearing as those of a child whom it is easy to make happy, and whom it seems so cruel to pain; and with all the Venosta's deviations from the polished and tranquil good taste of the beau monde, she had that indescribable grace which rarely deserts a Florentine, so that you might call her odd but not vulgar; while, though uneducated, except in the way of her old profession, and never having troubled herself to read anything but a libretto and the pious books commended to her by her confessor, the artless babble of her talk every now and then flashed out with a quaint humour, lighting up terse fragments of the old Italian wisdom which had mysteriously embedded themselves in the groundwork of her mind.  But Graham was not at this time disposed to judge the poor Venosta kindly or fairly.  Isaura had taken high rank in his thoughts.  He felt an impatient resentment mingled with anxiety and compassionate tenderness at a companionship which seemed to him derogatory to the position he would have assigned to a creature so gifted, and unsafe as a guide amidst the perils and trials to which the youth, the beauty, and the destined profession of Isaura were exposed.  Like most Englishmen--especially Englishmen wise in the knowledge of life--he held in fastidious regard the proprieties and conventions by which the dignity of woman is fenced round; and of those proprieties and conventions the Venosta naturally appeared to him a "]]]
