And they rose up at once in the Golden street, they rose from reading the message that they had carved upon gold. \"The last who came,\" they said, \"came with a wreath of laurels carved out of emeralds, as only the Muses can carve. You are not from the Muses.\" And even as they had stoned the last so also they stoned him. And afterwards they carved his message on gold and laid it up in their temples.  When will the Muses rest? When are they weary? Even yet once again they sent a messenger under the gateway into the Golden Town. And for all that he wore a garland of gold that the high Muses gave him, a garland of kingcups soft and yellow on his head, yet fashioned of pure gold and by whom but the Muses, yet did they stone him in the Golden Town. But they had the message, and what care the Muses?  And yet they will not rest, for some while since I heard them call to me.  \"Go take our message,\" they said, \"unto the Golden Town.\"  But I would not go. And they spake a second time. \"Go take our message,\" they said.  And still I would not go, and they cried out a third time: \"Go take our message.\"  And though they cried a third time I would not go. But morning and night they cried and through long evenings.  When will the Muses rest? When are they weary? And when they would not cease to call to me I went to them and I said: \"The Golden Town is the Golden Town no longer. They have sold their pillars for brass and their temples for money, they have made coins out of their golden doors. It is become a dark town full of trouble, there is no ease in its streets, beauty has left it and the old songs are gone.\"  \"Go take our message,\" they cried.  And I said to the high Muses: \"You do not understand. You have no message for the Golden Town, the holy city no longer.\"  \"Go take our message,\" they cried.  \"What is your message?\" I said to the high Muses.  And when I heard their message I made excuses, dreading to speak such things in the Golden Town; and again they bade me go.  And I said: \"I will not go. None will believe me.\"  And still the Muses cry to me all night long.  They do not understand. How should they know?     THE THREE TALL SONS   And at last Man raised on high the final glory of his civilization, the towering edifice of the ultimate city.  Softly beneath him in the deeps of the earth purred his machinery fulfilling all his needs, there was no more toil for man. There he sat at ease discussing the Sex Problem.  And sometimes painfully out of forgotten fields, there came to his outer door, came to the furthest rampart of the final glory of Man, a poor old woman begging. And always they turned her away. This glory of Man's achievement, this city was not for her.  It was Nature that came thus begging in from the fields, whom they always turned away.  And away she went again alone to her fields.  And one day she came again, and again they sent her hence. But her three tall sons came too.  \"These shall go in,\" she said. \"Even these my sons to your city.\"  And the three tall sons went in.  And these are Nature's sons, the forlorn one's terrible children, War, Famine and Plague.  Yea and they went in there and found Man unawares in his city still poring over his Problems, obsessed with his civilization, and never hearing their tread as those three came up behind.     COMPROMISE   They built their gorgeous home, their city of glory, above the lair of the earthquake. They built it of marble and gold in the shining youth of the world. There they feasted and fought and called their city immortal, and danced and sang songs to the gods. None heeded the earthquake in all those joyous streets. And down in the deeps of the earth, on the black feet of the abyss, they that would conquer Man mumbled long in the darkness, mumbled and goaded the earthquake to try his strength with that city, to go forth blithely at night and to gnaw its pillars like bones. And down in those grimy deeps the earthquake answered them, and would not do their pleasure and would not stir from thence, for who knew who they were who danced all day where he rumbled, and what if the lords of that city that had no fear of his anger were haply even the gods!  And the centuries plodded by, on and on round the world, and one day they that had danced, they that had sung in that city, remembered the lair of the earthquake in the deeps down under their feet, and made plans one with another and sought to avert the danger, sought to appease the earthquake and turn his anger away.  They sent down singing girls, and priests with oats and wine, they sent down garlands and propitious berries, down by dark steps to the black depths of the earth, they sent peacocks newly slain, and boys with burning spices, and their thin white sacred cats with collars of pearls all newly drawn from sea, they sent huge diamonds down in coffers of teak, and ointment and strange oriental dyes, arrows and armor and the rings of their queen.  \"Oho,\" said the earthquake in the coolth of the earth, \"so they are not the gods.\"     WHAT WE HAVE COME TO   When the advertiser saw the cathedral spires over the downs in the distance, he looked at them and wept.  \"If only,\" he said, \"this were an advertisement of Beefo, so nice, so nutritious, try it in your soup, ladies like it.\"     THE TOMB OF PAN   \"Seeing,\" they said, \"that old-time Pan is dead, let us now make a tomb for him and a monument, that the dreadful worship of long ago may be remembered and avoided by all.\"  So said the people of the enlightened lands. And they built a white and mighty tomb of marble. Slowly it rose under the hands of the builders and longer every evening after sunset it gleamed with rays of the departed sun.  And many mourned for Pan while the builders built; many reviled him. Some called the builders to cease and to weep for Pan and others called them to leave no memorial at all of so infamous a god. But the builders built on steadily.  And one day all was finished, and the tomb stood there like a steep sea-cliff. And Pan was carved thereon with humbled head and the feet of angels pressed upon his neck. And when the tomb was finished the sun had already set, but the afterglow was rosy on the huge bulk of Pan.  And presently all the enlightened people came, and saw the tomb and remembered Pan who was dead, and all deplored him and his wicked age. But a few wept apart because of the death of Pan.  But at evening as he stole out of the forest, and slipped like a shadow softly along the hills, Pan saw the tomb and laughed."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7841"],["title","A Primary Reader: Old-time Stories, Fairy Tales and Myths Retold (#0)"],["body","PRIMARY READER  Old-time Stories, Fairy Tales and Myths Retold by Children  By  E. LOUISE SMYTHE     PREFACE.   This book originated in a series of little reading lessons prepared for the first grade pupils in the Santa Rosa public schools. The object of the lessons was three-fold: to provide reading matter for the little ones who had only a small vocabulary of sight-words; to acquaint them early with the heroes who have come down to us in song and story; and to create a desire for literature.  It has been my endeavor to follow Dr. G. Stanley Hall's suggestions in his monograph, \"How to Teach Reading,\" where he asks for \"true child-editions, made by testing many children with the work piece-meal and cutting and adapting the material till it really and closely fitted the minds and hearts of the children.\"  Various stories were given to the pupils; discussions followed. After a time the story was produced orally by the children. Notes were made on expressions used and points of interest dwelt upon. Later the story was either written on the blackboard or mimeographed and put into the pupils' hands to read.  It gave great delight to the children to recognize an old friend in a new dress, and as interest was aroused, but little difficulty was encountered in recognizing words that were indeed \"new\" in their sight vocabulary, but old servants in their oral vocabulary.  The spirit of the book may be illustrated by referring to the roast turkey in the story of The Little Match Girl. The story was told as dear old Hans Christian Andersen gave it to the little German children of fifty years ago. But American children have a different idea of the fowl which graces the table at Christmas time. The story as it came from the lips of the children referred to the \"turkey,\" and \"goose\" was used in only one instance. As the story was to appeal to our children, the word was changed to suit their ideas.  Again, in the story of Red Riding-Hood we preferred to use the German ending, as it leaves a far happier impression on the minds of the children than the accepted English version. The incongruity of the wolf's swallowing whole the grandmother and child does not destroy the child's enjoyment of the story, while the happy release of both grandmother and little girl forms a suitable close.  Also, as this old story handed down in so many languages is an interpretation of one of the Sun myths, it seems better to cling to the original, especially when it meets so entirely with the child's approval.  Before presenting the Norse myths for reading, they had been the subject of many conversations, queries and illustrations. Some were even dramatized--in a childlike way, of course. Detailed descriptions of Mt. Ida, Asgard, and some of the principal heroes, were given. But, though the little audience seemed interested in the introductory remarks, these never came back when the children were called upon to reproduce the story. The narrator at once plunged into the story part. It is for this reason descriptions of heroes and places have been omitted in these stories. It is thus left for each teacher who uses this book to employ her own method of introducing the gods of the hardy Norseman to her pupils.  The following works will be found useful and quite available to most teachers: Andersen's Norse Mythology, Mabie's Norse Stories, Mara Pratt's Stories from Norseland, Fiske's Myths and Myth Makers, Taylor's Primitive Culture, Vol. I.; and Longfellow's Poems.  Hoping these stories will interest other children as they have interested those who helped build them, I send them forth.  E. LOUISE SMYTHE.  _Santa Rosa, California._     CONTENTS.

[Illustration: THE DUCK'S NEST.]  She sat on the eggs to keep them warm.  At last the eggs broke, one after the other. Little ducks came out.  Only one egg was left. It was a very large one.  At last it broke, and out came a big, ugly duckling.  \"What a big duckling!\" said the old duck. \"He does not look like us. Can he be a turkey?--We will see. If he does not like the water, he is not a duck.\"         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            mother         jumped         duckling           splash         swim           bigger           called         began          little   The next day the mother duck took her ducklings to the pond.  [Illustration: THE DUCK TAKES HER DUCKLINGS TO SWIM.]  Splash! Splash! The mother duck was in the water. Then she called the ducklings to come in. They all jumped in and began to swim. The big, ugly duckling swam, too.  The mother duck said, \"He is not a turkey. He is my own little duck. He will not be so ugly when he is bigger.\"         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            yard          alone         while           noise         hurt          that           eating        know          want  Then she said to the ducklings, \"Come with me. I want you to see the other ducks. Stay by me and look out for the cat.\"  They all went into the duck yard. What a noise the ducks made!  While the mother duck was eating a big bug, an old duck bit the ugly duckling.  \"Let him alone,\" said the mother duck. \"He did not hurt you.\"  [Illustration: \"HE DID NOT HURT YOU,\" SAID THE MOTHER DUCK.]  \"I know that,\" said the duck, \"but he is so ugly, I bit him.\"         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            lovely        help            there           walked        bushes          afraid  The next duck they met, said, \"You have lovely ducklings. They are all pretty but one. He is very ugly.\"  [Illustration: \"YOUR CHILDREN ARE ALL PRETTY EXCEPT ONE.\"]  The mother duck said, \"I know he is not pretty. But he is very good.\"  Then she said to the ducklings, \"Now, my dears, have a good time.\"  But the poor, big, ugly duckling did not have a good time.  The hens all bit him. The big ducks walked on him.  The poor duckling was very sad. He did not want to be so ugly. But he could not help it.  He ran to hide under some bushes. The little birds in the bushes were afraid and flew away.         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            because       house           would           away          hard            lived  \"It is all because I am so ugly,\" said the duckling. So he ran away.  At night he came to an old house. The house looked as if it would fall down. It was so old. But the wind blew so hard that the duckling went into the house.  [Illustration: THE UGLY DUCKLING FINDS THE OLD HOUSE.]  An old woman lived there with her cat and her hen.  The old woman said, \"I will keep the duck. I will have some eggs.\"         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            growl         walk           corner        animals  The next day, the cat saw the duckling and began to growl.  The hen said, \"Can you lay eggs?\" The duckling said, \"No.\"  \"Then keep still,\" said the hen. The cat said, \"Can you growl?\"  [Illustration: THE CAT SAID, \"CAN YOU GROWL?\"]  \"No,\" said the duckling.  \"Then keep still,\" said the cat.  And the duckling hid in a corner. The next day he went for a walk. He saw a big pond. He said, \"I will have a good swim.\"  But all of the animals made fun of him. He was so ugly.         *       *       *       *       *            summer        away            cake           winter        swans           spring           flew          bread           leaves  The summer went by.  Then the leaves fell and it was very cold. The poor duckling had a hard time.  It is too sad to tell what he did all winter.  At last it was spring.  The birds sang. The ugly duckling was big now.  One day he flew far away.  [Illustration: \"OH, SEE THE LOVELY SWAN!\"]  Soon he saw three white swans on the lake.  He said, \"I am going to see those birds. I am afraid they will kill me, for I am so ugly.\"  He put his head down to the water. What did he see? He saw himself in the water. But he was not an ugly duck. He was a white swan.  The other swans came to see him.  The children said, \"Oh, see the lovely swans. The one that came last is the best.\"  And they gave him bread and cake.  It was a happy time for the ugly duckling.

It had no leaves. It had needles.  The little tree said, \"I do not like needles. All the other trees in the woods have pretty leaves. I want leaves, too. But I will have better leaves. I want gold leaves.\"  Night came and the little tree went to sleep. A fairy came by and gave it gold leaves.

The poor little tree cried, \"I do not want gold leaves again. I will have glass leaves.\"         *       *       *       *       *       *       *            night         sunshine        bright           looked        wind            blew  So the little tree went to sleep.
