A fresh charm was added by the new metal to the personal adornment of women, and an enhanced splendor to the pageants of society. Gold in its palmiest days had never enjoyed such a vogue. A crowded reception room or a dinner party where artemisium abounded possessed an indescribable atmosphere of luxury and richness, refined in quality, yet captivating to every sense. Imaginative persons went so far as to aver that the sight and presence of the metal exercised a strangely soothing and dreamy power over the mind, like the influence of moonlight streaming through the tree-tops on a still, balmy night.  The public curiosity in regard to the origin of artemisium was boundless. The various nations published official bulletins in which the general facts--omitting, of course, such incidents as the singular exhibition seen by the visiting financiers on the wall of Dr. Syx's office--were detailed to gratify the universal desire for information.  President Boon not only submitted the specimens of ore-bearing rock which he had brought from the mine to careful analysis, but also appealed to several of the greatest living chemists and mineralogists to aid him; but they were all equally mystified. The green substance contained in the ore, although differing slightly from ordinary chrysolite, answered all the known tests of that mineral. It was remembered, however, that Dr. Syx had said that they would be likely to mistake the substance for chrysolite, and the result of their experiments justified his prediction. Evidently the doctor had gone a stone's-cast beyond the chemistry of the day, and, just as evidently, he did not mean to reveal his discovery for the benefit of science, nor for the benefit of any pockets except his own.  Notwithstanding the failure of the chemists to extract anything from Dr. Syx's ore, the public at large never doubted that the secret would be discovered in good time, and thousands of prospectors flocked to the Teton Mountains in search of the ore. And without much difficulty they found it. Evidently the doctor had been mistaken in thinking that his mine might be the only one. The new miners hurried specimens of the green-speckled rock to the chemical laboratories for experimentation, and meanwhile began to lay up stores of the ore in anticipation of the time when the proper way to extract the metal should be discovered.  But, alas! that time did not come. The fresh ore proved to be as refractory as that which had been obtained from Dr. Syx. But in the midst of the universal disappointment there came a new sensation.  One morning the newspapers glared with a despatch from Grand Teton station announcing that the metal itself had been discovered by prospectors on the eastern slope of the main peak.  \"It outcrops in many places,\" ran the despatch, \"and many small nuggets have been picked out of crevices in the rocks.\"  The excitement produced by this news was even greater than when gold was discovered at the south pole. Again a mad rush was made for the Tetons. The heights around Jackson's Hole and the shores of Jackson's and Jenny's lakes were quickly dotted with camps, and the military force had to be doubled to keep off the curious, and occasionally menacing, crowds which gathered in the vicinity and seemed bent on unearthing the great secret locked behind the windowless walls of the mill, where the column of black smoke and the roar of the engine served as reminders of the incredible wealth which the sole possessor of that secret was rolling up.  This time no mistake had been made. It was a fact that the metal, in virgin purity, had been discovered scattered in various places on the ledges of the Grand Teton. In a little while thousands had obtained specimens with their own hands. The quantity was distressingly small, considering the number and the eagerness of the seekers, but that it was genuine artemisium not even Dr. Syx could have denied. He, however, made no attempt to deny it.  \"Yes,\" he said, when questioned, \"I find that I have been deceived. At first I thought the metal existed only in the form of the green ore, but of late I have come upon veins of pure artemisium in my mine. I am glad for your sakes, but sorry for my own. Still, it may turn out that there is no great amount of free artemisium after all.\"  While the doctor talked in this manner close observers detected a lurking sneer which his acquaintances had not noticed since artemisium was first adopted as the money basis of the world.  The crowd that swarmed upon the mountain quickly exhausted all of the visible supply of the metal. Sometimes they found it in a thin stratum at the bottom of crevices, where it could be detached in opalescent plates and leaves of the thickness of paper. These superficial deposits evidently might have been formed from water holding the metal in solution. Occasionally, deep cracks contained nuggets and wiry masses which looked as if they had run together when molten.  The most promising spots were soon staked out in miners' claims, machinery was procured, stock companies were formed, and borings were begun. The enthusiasm arising from the earlier finds and the flattering surface indications caused everybody to work with feverish haste and energy, and within two months one hundred tunnels were piercing the mountain.  For a long time nobody was willing to admit the truth which gradually forced itself upon the attention of the miners. The deeper they went the scarcer became the indications of artemisium! In fact, such deposits as were found were confined to fissures near the surface. But Dr. Syx continued to report a surprising increase in the amount of free metal in his mine, and this encouraged all who had not exhausted their capital to push on their tunnels in the hope of finally striking a vein. At length, however, the smaller operators gave up in despair, until only one heavily capitalized company remained at work.    VI  A STRANGE DISCOVERY  \"It is my belief that Dr. Max Syx is a deceiver.\"  The person who uttered this opinion was a young engineer, Andrew Hall, who had charge of the operations of one of the mining companies which were driving tunnels into the Grand Teton.  \"What do you mean by that?\" asked President Boon, who was the principal backer of the enterprise.  \"I mean,\" replied Hall, \"that there is no free metal in this mountain, and Dr. Syx knows there is none.\"  \"But he is getting it himself from his mine,\" retorted President Boon.  \"So he says, but who has seen it? No one is admitted into the Syx mine, his foremen are forbidden to talk, and his workmen are specially imported negroes who do not understand the English language.\"  \"But,\" persisted Mr. Boon, \"how, then, do you account for the nuggets scattered over the mountain? And, beside, what object could Dr. Syx have in pretending that there is free metal to be had for the digging?\"  \"He may have salted the mountain, for all I know,\" said Hall. \"As for his object, I confess I am entirely in the dark; but, for all that, I am convinced that we shall find no more metal if we dig ten miles for it.\"  \"Nonsense,\" said the president; \"if we keep on we shall strike it. Did not Dr. Syx himself admit that he found no free artemisium until his tunnel had reached the core of the peak? We must go as deep as he has gone before we give up.\"  \"I fear the depths he attains are beyond most people's reach,\" was Hall's answer, while a thoughtful look crossed his clear-cut brow, \"but since you desire it, of course the work shall go on. I should like, however, to change the direction of the tunnel.\"  \"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Boon; \"bore in whatever direction you think proper, only don't despair.\"  About a month after this conversation Andrew Hall, with whom a community of tastes in many things had made me intimately acquainted, asked me one morning to accompany him into his tunnel.  \"I want to have a trusty friend at my elbow,\" he said, \"for, unless I am a dreamer, something remarkable will happen within the next hour, and two witnesses are better than one.\"  I knew Hall was not the person to make such a remark carelessly, and my curiosity was intensely excited, but, knowing his peculiarities, I did not press him for an explanation. When we arrived at the head of the tunnel I was surprised at finding no workmen there.  \"I stopped blasting some time ago,\" said Hall, in explanation, \"for a reason which, I hope, will become evident to you very soon. Lately I have been boring very slowly, and yesterday I paid off the men and dismissed them with the announcement, which, I am confident, President Boon will sanction after he hears my report of this morning's work, that the tunnel is abandoned. You see, I am now using a drill which I can manage without assistance. I believe the work is almost completed, and I want you to witness the end of it.\"  He then carefully applied the drill, which noiselessly screwed its nose into the rock. When it had sunk to a depth of a few inches he withdrew it, and, taking a hand-drill capable of making a hole not more than an eighth of an inch in diameter, cautiously began boring in the centre of the larger cavity. He had made hardly a hundred turns of the handle when the drill shot through the rock! A gratified smile illuminated his features, and he said in a suppressed voice:  \"Don't be alarmed; I'm going to put out the light.\"  Instantly we were in complete darkness, but being close at Hall's side I could detect his movements. He pulled out the drill, and for half a minute remained motionless as if listening. There was no sound.  \"I must enlarge the opening,\" he whispered, and immediately the faint grating of a sharp tool cutting through the rock informed me of his progress.  \"There,\" at last he said, \"I think that will do; now for a look.\"  I could tell that he had placed his eye at the hole and was gazing with breathless attention. Presently he pulled my sleeve.  \"Put your eye here,\" he whispered,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8199"],["title","The Moon Metal (#5)"],["body","me into the proper position for looking through the hole.  At first I could discern nothing except a smoky blue glow. But soon my vision cleared a little, and then I perceived that I was gazing into a narrow tunnel which met ours directly end to end. Glancing along the axis of this gallery I saw, some two hundred yards away, a faint light which evidently indicated the mouth of the tunnel.  At the end where we had met it the mysterious tunnel was considerably widened at one side, as if the excavators had started to change direction and then abandoned the work, and in this elbow I could just see the outlines of two or three flat cars loaded with broken stone, while a heap of the same material lay near them. Through the centre of the tunnel ran a railway track.  \"Do you know what you are looking at?\" asked Hall in my ear.  \"I begin to suspect,\" I replied, \"that you have accidentally run into Dr. Syx's mine.\"  \"If Dr. Syx had been on his guard this accident wouldn't have happened,\" replied Hall, with an almost inaudible chuckle.  \"I heard you remark a month ago,\" I said, \"that you were changing the direction of your tunnel. Has this been the aim of your labors ever since?\"  \"You have hit it,\" he replied. \"Long ago I became convinced that my company was throwing away its money in a vain attempt to strike a lode of pure artemisium. But President Boon has great faith in Dr. Syx, and would not give up the work. So I adopted what I regarded as the only practicable method of proving the truth of my opinion and saving the company's funds. An electric indicator, of my invention, enabled me to locate the Syx tunnel when I got near it, and I have met it end on, and opened this peep-hole in order to observe the doctor's operations. I feel that such spying is entirely justified in the circumstances. Although I cannot yet explain just how or why I feel sure that Dr. Syx was the cause of the sudden discovery of the surface nuggets, and that he has encouraged the miners for his own ends, until he has brought ruin to thousands who have spent their last cent in driving useless tunnels into this mountain. It is a righteous thing to expose him.\"  \"But,\" I interposed, \"I do not see that you have exposed anything yet except the interior of a tunnel.\"  \"You will see more clearly after a while,\" was the reply.  Hall now placed his eye again at the aperture, and was unable entirely to repress the exclamation that rose to his lips. He remained staring through the hole for several minutes without uttering a word. Presently I noticed that the lenses of his eye were illuminated by a ray of light coming through the hole, but he did not stir.  After a long inspection he suddenly applied his ear to the hole and listened intently for at least five minutes. Not a sound was audible to me, but, by an occasional pressure of the hand, Hall signified that some important disclosure was reaching his sense of hearing. At length he removed his ear.  \"Pardon me,\" he whispered, \"for keeping you so long in waiting, but what I have just seen and overheard was of a nature to admit of no interruption. He is still talking, and by pressing your ear against the hole you may be able to catch what he says.\"  \"Who is 'he'?\"  \"Look for yourself.\"  I placed my eye at the aperture, and almost recoiled with the violence of my surprise. The tunnel before me was brilliantly illuminated, and within three feet of the wall of rock behind which we crouched stood Dr. Syx, his dark profile looking almost satanic in the sharp contrast of light and shadow. He was talking to one of his foremen, and the two were the only visible occupants of the tunnel. Putting my ear to the little opening, I heard his words distinctly:  --\"end of their rope. Well, they've spent a pretty lot of money for their experience, and I rather think we shall not be troubled again by artemisium-seekers for some time to come.\"  The doctor's voice ceased, and instantly I clapped my eye to the hole. He had changed his position so that his black eyes now looked straight at the aperture. My heart was in my mouth, for at first I believed from his expression that he had detected the gleam of my eyeball. But if so, he probably mistook it for a bit of mica in the rock, and paid no further attention. Then his lips moved, and I put my ear again to the hole. He seemed to be replying to a question that the foreman had asked.  \"If they do,\" he said, \"they will never guess the real secret.\"  Thereupon he turned on his heel, kicked a bit of rock off the track, and strode away towards the entrance. The foreman paused long enough to turn out the electric lamp, and then followed the doctor.  \"Well,\" asked Hall, \"what have you heard?\"  I told him everything.  \"It fully corroborates the evidence of my own eyes and ears,\" he remarked, \"and we may count ourselves extremely lucky. It is not likely that Dr. Syx will be heard a second time proclaiming his deception with his own lips. It is plain that he was led to talk as he did to the foreman on account of the latter's having informed him of the sudden discharge of my men this morning. Their presence within ear-shot of our hiding-place during their conversation was, of course, pure accident, and so you can see how kind fortune has been to us. I expected to have to watch and listen and form deductions for a week, at least, before getting the information which five lucky minutes have placed in our hands.\"  While he was speaking my companion busied himself in carefully plugging up the hole in the rock. When it was closed to his satisfaction he turned on the light in our tunnel.  \"Did you observe,\" he asked, \"that there was a second tunnel?\"  \"What do you say?\"  \"When the light was on in there I saw the mouth of a smaller tunnel entering the main one behind the cars on the right. Did you notice it?\"  \"Oh yes,\" I replied. \"I did observe some kind of a dark hole there, but I paid no attention to it because I was so absorbed in the doctor.\"  \"Well,\" rejoined Hall, smiling, \"it was worth considerably more than a glance. As a subject of thought I find it even more absorbing than Dr. Syx. Did you see the track in it?\"  \"No,\" I had to acknowledge, \"I did not notice that. But,\" I continued, a little piqued by his manner, \"being a branch of the main tunnel, I don't see anything remarkable in its having a track also.\"  \"It was rather dim in that hole,\" said Hall, still smiling in a somewhat provoking way, \"but the railroad track was there plain enough. And, whether you think it remarkable or not, I should like to lay you a wager that that track leads to a secret worth a dozen of the one we have just overheard.\"  \"My good friend,\" I retorted, still smarting a little, \"I shall not presume to match my stupidity against your perspicacity. I haven't cat's eyes in the dark.\"  Hall immediately broke out laughing, and, slapping me good-naturedly on the shoulder, exclaimed:  \"Come, come now! If you go to kicking back at a fellow like that, I shall be sorry I ever undertook this adventure.\"    VII  A MYSTERY INDEED!  When President Boon had heard our story he promptly approved Hall's dismissal of the men. He expressed great surprise that Dr. Syx should have resorted to a deception which had been so disastrous to innocent people, and at first he talked of legal proceedings. But, after thinking the matter over, he concluded that Syx was too powerful to be attacked with success, especially when the only evidence against him was that he had claimed to find artemisium in his mine at a time when, as everybody knew, artemisium actually was found outside the mine. There was no apparent motive for the deception, and no proof of malicious intent. In short, Mr. Boon decided that the best thing for him and his stockholders to do was to keep silent about their losses and await events. And, at Hall's suggestion, he also determined to say nothing to anybody about the discovery we had made.  \"It could do no good,\" said Hall, in making the suggestion, \"and it might spoil a plan I have in mind.\"  \"What plan?\" asked the president.  \"I prefer not to tell just yet,\" was the reply.  I observed that, in our interview with Mr. Boon, Hall made no reference to the side tunnel to which he had appeared to attach so much importance, and I concluded that he now regarded it as lacking significance. In this I was mistaken.  A few days afterwards I received an invitation from Hall to accompany him once more into the abandoned tunnel.  \"I have found out what that sidetrack means,\" he said, \"and it has plunged me into another mystery so dark and profound that I cannot see my way through it. I must beg you to say no word to any one concerning the things I am about to show you.\"  I gave the required promise, and we entered the tunnel, which nobody had visited since our former adventure. Having extinguished our lamp, my companion opened the peep-hole, and a thin ray of light streamed through from the tunnel on the opposite side of the wall. He applied his eye to the hole.  \"Yes,\" he said, quickly stepping back and pushing me into his place, \"they are still at it. Look, and tell me what you see.\"  \"I see,\" I replied, after placing my eye at the aperture, \"a gang of men unloading a car which has just come out of the side tunnel, and putting its contents upon another car standing on the track of the main tunnel.\"  \"Yes, and what are they handling?\"  \"Why, ore, of course.\"  \"And do you see nothing significant in that?\"  \"To be sure!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, that ore--\"  \"Hush! hush!\" admonished Hall, putting his hand over my mouth; \"don't talk so loud. Now go on, in a whisper.\"  \"The ore,\" I resumed, \"may have come back from the furnace-room, because the side tunnel turns off so as to run parallel with the other.\"  \"It not only may have come back, it actually has come back,\" said Hall.  \"How can you be sure?\"  \"Because I have been over the track, and know that it leads to a secret apartment directly under the furnace in which Dr. Syx pretends to "]]]
