Love in our hearts makes us one, as the genuine need there stays constant;      Only returning desire knows oscillation or change.    Gently her hand presses mine, now she opens her eyes and is looking      Into my own eyes. No--don't. Let my thoughts rest on your form!    Please close your eyes. They're inebriation, confusion, they rob me      All too soon of the joy quiet reflection affords.    Grand are the forms of this body and nobly positioned each member.      Had Ariadne lain thus, Theseus never had fled.    Only a single kiss for these lips and then, O Theseus, leave her;      Look at her eyes--she's awake! Now you're eternally bound.     XVI    Boy, won't you light me a lamp. \"But dear master, there's light in the sky yet.      Don't waste your oil and the wick. Don't close the shutters so soon.    Only the houses are blocking the sun there, it's not yet the mountains.      Until the curfew shall ring, full half an hour must pass.\"    Wretched young fellow, be gone and obey me! My loved one is coming.      Lamplight, console me till then, harbinger warm of the night.     XVII    Poets of old in chorus cried out against those two serpents,      Making them horrible names, hated in all of the world:    Python the one, the other the Hydra of Lerna. These monsters      Both have now been destroyed, thanks to the deeds of the gods.    Fire-breathing, venomous once, they no longer now depredate our      Flocks and meadows and woods, fields of golden grain.    How is it then that some spiteful god in his wrath has      Raised from the poisonous slime offspring so monstrous again?    There's an insidious viper creeps into the loveliest gardens,      Lying in wait to attack all who seek pleasure therein.    Noble Hesperian dragon, I call you courageous and forthright.      Boldly defending your own beautiful apples of gold.    As for this worm, why he is not guarding at all, for his presence      Sullies both garden and fruit, till they deserve no defense.    Secretly coiled beneath bushes, where he befouls the sweet wellsprings,      Turning to poisonous drool Cupid's lifegiving dew.    Happy Lucretius knew how in his day to forego love completely,      Fearing not to enjoy pleasure in anyone's arms.    Fortunate Ancient, Propertius, for you a slave fetched the girls down      From the Aventine Hill, from Tarpeia's grove.    Cynthia then, when driving you out of such unchaste embraces,      Found you unfaithful, it's true, but she did find you whole.    Who would today dare attempt to escape from fidelity's ennui?      Love does not hold one back--only concern for one's health.    Even the woman we love may afford us uncertain enjoyment;      Nowhere can feminine lap safely encouch a man's head.    Matrimonial bed's insecure and so's fornication;      Husband, lover and wife pass to each other the hurt.    Think of those ages of gold when Jupiter followed his urges,      Chose Callisto one day, turned to Semel the next.    It was important to him to find thresholds of temples so sacred      Pure when, enamoured, he sought powerful entry to them.    Can you imagine the ragings of Juno if in love's skirmish      Poisonous weapons on her by her own spouse had been turned?    But we neo-pagans may not after all be abandoned entirely:      Yet there is speeding a god mercifully over the earth,    Quick and assiduous. Everyone knows him and ought to adore him,      Herald of Zeus: Hermes, the healing god.    Although his father's temple be fallen, and though of its pillars      Scarcely a pair yet records ancient glory adored,    Nevertheless the son's place of worship still stands, and forever      Will there the ardent requests alternate with the thanks.    Only one favor I beg of you, Graces (I ask it in secret--      Fervent my prayer and deep, out of a passionate breast):    My little garden, my sweet one, protect it and do not let any      Evil come near it nor me. Cupid will hold out his hand:    O, and entrusting myself to the rascal, I beg you please may I      Do so in pleasure with no danger or worry or fear.     XVIII    I cannot think I'd have gone with Julius Caesar to Britain;      To the Popina right here, Florus would tug me with ease.    Fogs of the dreary north remain a more baleful remembrance      Than in the kitchens of Rome tribes of assiduous fleas.    After today, I'll remember you even more kindly, tavernas,      You osterias, as you are called, aptly by those here in Rome.    That was the place I encountered my mistress today with the uncle      Whom she so often deceives, so that she can have me.    Here's where I sat at a table surrounded by good-natured Germans;      Over on that side the girl, finding a seat for herself    Next to her mother where, frequently shifting her bench, she arranged      Nicely for me to perceive profile and curve of her neck;    Speaks just a little more loudly than women in Rome are accustomed;      Significant glance as she pours--misses the glass with the wine    So that it spills on the table, and she with a delicate finger      Over its surface can draw circles in damp arabesque:    Her name entwining in mine, while my eyes most eagerly follow      All that her fingertip writes. She is of course well aware    That I am watching, so finally makes the V of the Roman      Five, with a virgule before. Quickly, as soon as I've seen,    She interlaces the circles, reducing them all to ornatest      Patterns--but still the sweet IV stood as engraved in my eye.    I sat there mutely and biting my passionate lips almost bloody      Half from delight at the ruse, partly from stifled desire:    Such a long time until dark, then another four hours of waiting.      --Sun, who tarries on high, contemplating Rome:    Greater never you've nor shall you in future see greater      Than Rome, O sun, as your priest, Horace, enraptured foretold.    Tarry no longer today. Go seek other realms beneath heaven.      Sooner depart and leave Rome's seven famed hills to me.    Please do the poet a favor and shorten the glorious hours      Which the painter devours, eagerly filling his eyes.    Cast now but one ardent glance, while descending, on noble façades and      Cupolas, pillars, and--last--up at the obelisks. Then    Hastily plunge to the ocean. Come view all the sooner tomorrow      That which, for centuries now, gods have let you enjoy:    Italy's shoreline so long overgrown with moist reeds, elevations      Somberly rising to shades cast by the bushes and trees.    First were but few simple dwellings here, suddenly sunlight discovered      Nations enlivening hills teeming with fortunate thieves.    Onto this spot they assembled such plunder, in your eye so splendid      All earth's remaining orb scarcely was worthy of note.    You watched a world being born here, watched the same world sink to ruin,      And from those ruins yet arise world again greater, perhaps.    O may I long by your light now behold this Rome. May the Parcæ      Spin the fine thread of my life slowly, taking great care.    O but come rushing the moment my love designated so sweetly.      Wonderful! Sound already the chimes? --No, but I heard at least three.    Thus, my dear muses, again you've beguiled the monotony for me.      Of this long interval while I was apart from my love.    All of you now, farewell! I'll be going now--don't be offended.      For, though you're proud, you'll concede: Cupid in my heart comes first.     XIX    Why did you fail to appear at the cot in the vineyard today, Love?      As I had promised I would, long I awaited you there.    \"Dear, I had almost arrived when I saw, by good fortune, your uncle      Standing right there by the vines, looking now this way, now that.    Stealthily I slipped away.\" --Alas, what a misapprehension!      You saw the scarecrow, that's all. Nothing else drove you away.    Reeds and some discarded garments all hastily cobbled together--      I helped to make it myself: diligent in my own grief.    \"Well, now his wish is fulfilled. The old gardner's most dissolute crow has      Left on this day unscathed nice little garden and niece.\"     XX    While there is many an unpleasant sound, I hate to hear barking      Worse than anything else. Bellowing dogs split my ears.    Nevertheless I do like to hear, and take pleasure in listening      To the loud howl of the dog raised from a pup next door.    That is the dog that so bayed one time at my girl that he almost      Gave our secret away (when she was visiting me).    Now, when I hear the dog barking I think my beloved is coming--      Or I remember the time, when long awaited she came.     XXI    I can tell not only about a discomfort far greater than others,      But of a horror besides, thinking of which will arouse    Every fiber in me to revulsion. My friends, I confess it:      Great displeasure I take lying alone in my bed.    But it's a horror to fear on the pathways of love you'll discover      Snakes and their venom beneath roses of eager desire--    That at the moment supreme, when I'm yielding to pleasure so fully,      Right at my head as it droops, hissing disease may approach.    That's why Faustina as my companion in bed makes me happy:      Loving she always remains faithful, as I am to her.    Young men are aroused in their passions by obstacles and by excitement;      I prefer to go slow, savoring pleasures secure.    Is it not bliss to exchange tender kisses containing no dangers,      Sucking into our lungs, carefree, our partner's own life?    That is the way our long nights of enjoyment are passed. We listen,      Breast against breast, to the storm, pouring down rain in the wind    Morning begins to dawn, we expect from these hours approaching      Blossoms "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7889"],["title","Erotica Romana (#3)"],["body","will adorn festive the coming new day.    Quirites, permit me the joy, and may this, of all pleasures on earth the      First and the last, be vouchsafed all of mankind by the god.     XXII    Ah, to uphold one's respectable name is not easy. The Lady      Fame has an ancient foe: Cupid, my master and lord.    Oh, by the way, have you heard of the cause of their mutual hatred?      It's an old story, I think--Let me just tell it again.    Powerful ever the goddess, but nevertheless to her fellows      Overbearing and rude, quite unendurable. She    Had by the gods since time out of mind at their banquets been dreaded,      Yelling with brassiest voice orders to great and to small.    Once, in her arrogance even maintained that she had subjected      To her own will, as her slave, Jove's most illustrious son.    \"One of these days, O father of deities,\" cried she in triumph,      \"I shall be bringing you my--Hercules, as if new born.    Don't think that Hercules be still that boy whom Alcmene once bore you;      His adulation of me makes him now god upon earth.    When toward Olympus he gazes, I've no doubt you hope that he's looking      Piously toward your knees. Hardly. He's looking for me.    Worthiest man! O the vision of winning my favor makes easy      Hitherto unexplored paths, under that powerful foot.    I do my part, for I meet him halfway and proclaim his adventures      Praising his name in advance, even before he's begun.    One day you'll wed me to Hercules.  Hero who Amazons conquered      That day will overwhelm me. Happily I'll call him:  spouse.\"    All of the gods kept their counsel, and none would reply to the braggart,      Lest in a pique she devise vengeance against one of them.    Cupid, escaping attention, slipped off to enslave, however, her hero:      Artlessly conquering by--force of a beautiful girl,    Afterward decked out his couple in mute masquerade:  lionskin      Over her shoulders, the club leaned (by much toil) at her side;    Wiry stiff hair of the hero larded with blossoms, a distaff      Laid in his fist, to conform strength to the dalliance of love.    Scene now completed and ready to tease, he goes scampering, shouting      For all Olympus to hear: \"Come, see these glorious deeds!    Heaven and Earth and the Sun on his indefatigable journey      Over that infinite path never did witness the like!\"    Everyone hastened, gulled by the dissolute boy, who feigning      Earnest, had summoned them all (Fame by no means lagged behind).    Which of the gods will now smile in sweet condescension on Cupid?      --Juno! delighted, of course, seeing a man humbled so.    Fame, on the other hand, stood there ashamed, embarrassed, despairing.      First she just laughed, saying: \"Gods, be not deceived. It's a masque.    I know my hero too well to be fooled by disguises of actors.\"      Soon, though, in pain she perceived: Hercules, none but he.    (Vulcan had not been one thousandth so vexed to discover his playmate      Under his meshes ensnared, caught with his own lusty friend,    Lying just as the wiles of the net at the most crucial moment      Deftly embraced their embrace, trapping their instant of joy.    How those boys, Bacchus and Mercury, guffawed, and freely admitted:      Sweet must be the repose, lying on bosom so fine    Of this magnificent woman. They turned to Vulcan entreating:      \"Do not release them just yet. Let us inspect them once more.\"    And the old cuckold was cuckold enough to comply with their wishes.)      As for poor Fame, in all haste, burning with wrath she must flee.    Since then no armistice has been proclaimed to the feuding between them.      Let her but favor a man, hot in pursuit is the boy.    He whom Fame honors most can least defend against Cupid,      And her most dang'rous attacks strike the most morally proud.    Whoever tries to escape him is dragged down from bad deeds to worse ones.      Yes, he will offer you girls--if like a fool you despise    These, only then do you feel from his bow the arrows most vicious:      Heat of man's love for man, ardent desires toward beasts.    For those ashamed of him Cupid reserves the bitterest passions,      Mingling for hypocrites their pleasure in vice and remorse.    But, at the same time, the goddess seeks him, she's watching and list'ning.      Should find him with you, ill disposed will she be:    Frighten you, frowning austerely, contemptuously, violently casting      Into the worst of repute houses he's known to frequent.    Ah, it's the same with me, too. I haven't escaped her, the goddess.      Jealously she seeks me out, sweet secret love to expose.    I will submit to the ancient law and in silence revere her,      For, when great lords fall out, I like the Greeks must atone.     XXIII    However comely be strength, or free and undaunted comportment,      Secrecy is for a man most important of all.    Mighty subduer of cities, Discretion, O princess of nations,      Goddess whom I adore, safely you've led me thus far.    Now, though, what fate shall befall me? My frivolous muse has now opened      --Cupid, the scamp--opens lips hitherto sealed so well.    Difficult is it, alas, to conceal the shame of a monarch;      Hide it can neither his crown, nor a tight Phrygian cap:    Midas has asses ears! the first servant discovers--O horror!      Shame of this secret so weighs, Midas unburdens his heart.    Into the earth for safekeeping the servant must bury the story,      Easing in this way the king:  earth must conceal the tale.    Reeds in a trice are sprouting and rustling in murmuring breezes:      \"Midas, o Midas the King--bears the ears of an ass!\"    Mine is a secret more pleasant, but even more difficult keeping:      Out of abundance of heart eagerly speaketh my mouth.    None of my ladyfriends dare I confide in, for they would but chide me;      Nor any gentleman friend, lest he be rival to me.    Rapture proclaim to the grove, to the echoing cliffs perorate it?      One can do that if one's young, or if one's lonely enough.    I to hexameters tell, in pentameters I will confide it:      During the day she was joy, happiness all the night long.    Courted by so many suitors, avoided the snares that were set her      Now by one bolder than I, now by another in guile,    Cleverly, daintily, always slipped past them, and sure of the byways,      Comes to her lover's embrace, where he so eagerly waits.    Luna! Don't rise yet. She's coming, and must not be seen by the neighbor!      Breezes, rustle the leaves: muffle the sound of her feet.    And as for you, little poems, o grow and flower, your blossoms      Cradling themselves in the air, tepid and soft with love's breath.    Wafting, betray to Quirites, as Midas' reeds did with cheap gossip,      One happy couple in love, and their sweet secret, at last.     XXIV    I in the back of the garden, the last of the gods, in a corner,      Ineptly formed, must I stand. Evil the inroads of time.    Cucumber vines grow entwining about this primeval lingam,      Cracking it almost in two under the weight of the fruit.    Faggots are heaped all about me against the cold of the winter,      Which I so hate for the crows settling then down on my head,    Which they befoul very shamefully. Summer's no better: the servants      Empty their bowels and show insolent, naked behinds.    Filth, above and below! I was clearly in danger of turning      Into filth myself, toadstool, rotten wood!    Now, by your efforts, O noblest of artists, I shall recover      With fellow gods my just place. And it's no more than my due.    Jupiter's throne, so dishonestly won, it was I who secured it:      Color and ivory, marble and bronze, not to mention the poems.    Now, all intelligent men look upon me in kindness. They like to      Form their own image of me, just as the poet has done.    Nor do the girls take offense when they see me--by no means the matrons.      None finds me ugly today, though I am monstrously strong.    Half a foot long, as reward, your glorious rod (dear poet)      Proudly shall strut from your loins, when but your dearest commands,    Nor shall your member grow weary until you've enjoyed the full dozen      Artful positions the great poet Philainis describes.     ABOUT THE ELEGIES   Goethe cultivated a special, italianate hand for this portfolio of twenty-four \"elegies,\" so called because he was emulating the elegiasts of Imperial Rome, Tibullus, Propertius, Catullus.  The Elegies have never before been published as here, together in the cyclical form of their original conception.  Experts even denied that the two priapeia (I & XXIV) were by Goethe at all, although they are in the same hand as the rest.  To be sure, these two are not numbered, so that I was long undecided as to just what their proper position might be.  At one time I imagined they must belong at the middle of the cycle where at the end of Elegy XIII Priapus' mother summons her son.  Obviously Goethe, just returned north from his two years in Italy (1786-88), and alienated from prim, courtly friends (especially since he had taken a girlfriend into his cottage), had no thought of publication when he indited these remembrances of Ancient Rome.  But he did show them to close friends, one of whom was the wonderful dramatist Friedrich Schiller.  In 1795, Schiller undertook a new periodical, Die Horen.  This thoughtful and responsible man initiated the journal with an essay of his own, explaining how forms of entertainment are actually at the same time our primary modes of education.  It makes for pretty difficult reading in our present, less interested epoch.  But he did break the essay up with diversions solicited from the best minds of his era.  For a discussion of all this, see  _Professor Worthy's Page_  For now, it is enough to say that among Schiller's examples for \"aesthetic education,\" as he called it, were these Elegies by his much admired friend, Wolfgang"]]]
