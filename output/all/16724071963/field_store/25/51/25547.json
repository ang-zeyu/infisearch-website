Altogether, the situation was unpleasant.  There were many times in which Madame Savarin presumed to scold her distinguished husband for his want of prudence and thrift.  But those were never the times when scolding could be of no use.  It could clearly be of no use now.  Now was the moment to cheer and encourage him; to reassure him as to his own undiminished powers and popularity, for he talked dejectedly of himself as obsolete and passing out of fashion; to convince him also of the impossibility that the ungrateful publisher whom Savarin's more brilliant successes had enriched could encounter the odium of hostile proceedings; and to remind him of all the authors, all the artists, whom he in their earlier difficulties had so liberally assisted, and from whom a sum sufficing to pay the bourgeois creditor when the day arrived could now be honourably asked and would be readily contributed. In this last suggestion the homely prudent good-sense of Madame Savarin failed her.  She did not comprehend that delicate pride of honour which, with all his Parisian frivolities and cynicism, dignified the Parisian man of genius.  Savarin could not, to save his neck from a rope, have sent round the begging-hat to friends whom he had obliged.  Madame Savarin was one of those women with large-lobed ears, who can be wonderfully affectionate, wonderfully sensible, admirable wives and mothers, and yet are deficient in artistic sympathies with artistic natures.  Still, a really good honest wife is such an incalculable blessing to her lord, that, at the end of the talk in the solitary alley, this man of exquisite finesse, of the undefinably high-bred temperament, and, alas! the painful morbid susceptibility, which belongs to the genuine artistic character, emerged into the open sunlit lawn with his crest uplifted, his lip curved upward in its joyous mockery, and perfectly persuaded that somehow or other he should put down the offensive publisher, and pay off the unoffending creditor when the day for payment came.  Still he had judgment enough to know that to do this he must get back to Paris, and could not dawdle away precious hours in discussing the principles of poetry with Graham Vane.  There was only one thing, apart from \"the begging-hat,\" in which Savarin dissented from his wife.--She suggested his starting a new journal in conjunction with Gustave Rameau, upon whose genius and the expectations to be formed from it (here she was tacitly thinking of Isaura wedded to Rameau, and more than a Malibran on the stage) she insisted vehemently. Savarin did not thus estimate Gustave Rameau, thought him a clever, promising young writer in a very bad school of writing, who might do well some day or other.  But that a Rameau could help a Savarin to make a fortune!  No; at that idea he opened his eyes, patted his wife's shoulder, and called her \"enfant.\"  Graham's letter was from M. Renard, and ran thus:--       MONSIEUR,--I had the honour to call at your apartment this morning,      and I write this line to the address given to me by your concierge      to say that I have been fortunate enough to ascertain that the      relation of the missing lady is now at Paris.  I shall hold myself      in readiness to attend your summons.  Deign to accept, Monsieur, the      assurance of my profound consideration.                                              J.  RENARD.  This communication sufficed to put Graham into very high spirits. Anything that promised success to his research seemed to deliver his thoughts from a burden and his will from a fetter.  Perhaps in a few days he might frankly and honourably say to Isaura words which would justify his retaining longer, and pressing more ardently, the delicate hand which trembled in his as they took leave.  On arriving at Paris, Graham despatched a note to M. Renard requesting to see him, and received a brief line in reply that M. Renard feared he should be detained on other and important business till the evening, but hoped to call at eight o'clock.  A few minutes before that hour he entered Graham's apartment.  \"You have discovered the uncle of Louise Duval!\" exclaimed Graham; \"of course you mean M. de Mauleon, and he is at Paris?\"  \"True so far, Monsieur; but do not be too sanguine as to the results of the information I can give you.  Permit me, as briefly as possible, to state the circumstances.  When you acquainted me with the fact that M. de Mauleon was the uncle of Louise Duval, I told you that I was not without hopes of finding him out, though so long absent from Paris.  I will now explain why.  Some months ago, one of my colleagues engaged in the political department (which I am not) was sent to Lyons, in consequence of some suspicions conceived by the loyal authorities there of a plot against the emperor's life.  The suspicions were groundless, the plot a mare's nest.  But my colleague's attention was especially drawn towards a man not mixed up with the circumstances from which a plot had been inferred, but deemed in some way or other a dangerous enemy to the Government.  Ostensibly, he exercised a modest and small calling as a sort of courtier or _agent de change_; but it was noticed that certain persons familiarly frequenting his apartment, or to whose houses he used to go at night, were disaffected to the Government,--not by any means of the lowest rank,--some of them rich malcontents who had been devoted Orleanists; others, disappointed aspirants to office or the 'cross;' one or two well-born and opulent fanatics dreaming of another Republic. Certain very able articles in the journals of the excitable _Midi_, though bearing another signature, were composed or dictated by this man, --articles evading the censure and penalties of the law, but very mischievous in their tone.  All who had come into familiar communication with this person were impressed with a sense of his powers; and also with a vague belief that he belonged to a higher class in breeding and education than that of a petty _agent de change_.  My colleague set himself to watch the man, and took occasions of business at his little office to enter into talk with him.  Not by personal appearance, but by voice, he came to a conclusion that the man was not wholly a stranger to him,--a peculiar voice with a slight Norman breadth of pronunciation, though a Parisian accent; a voice very low, yet very distinct; very masculine, yet very gentle.  My colleague was puzzled till late one evening he observed the man coming out of the house of one of these rich malcontents, the rich malcontent himself accompanying him.  My colleague, availing himself of the dimness of light, as the two passed into a lane which led to the agent's apartment, contrived to keep close behind and listen to their conversation; but of this he heard nothing,--only, when at the end of the lane, the rich man turned abruptly, shook his companion warmly by the hand, and parted from him, saying, 'Never fear; all shall go right with you, my dear Victor.' At the sound of that name 'Victor,' my colleague's memories, before so confused, became instantaneously clear.  Previous to entering our service, he had been in the horse business, a votary of the turf; as such he had often seen the brilliant 'sportman,' Victor de Mauleon; sometimes talked to him.  Yes, that was the voice,--the slight Norman intonation (Victor de Mauleon's father had it strongly, and Victor had passed some of his early childhood in Normandy), the subdued modulation of speech which had made so polite the offence to men, or so winning the courtship to women,--that was Victor de Mauleon.  But why there in that disguise?  What was his real business and object?  My confrere had no time allowed to him to prosecute such inquiries.  Whether Victor or the rich malcontent had observed him at their heels, and feared he might have overheard their words, I know not; but the next day appeared in one of the popular journals circulating among the _ouvriers_ a paragraph stating that a Paris spy had been seen at Lyons, warning all honest men against his machinations, and containing a tolerably accurate description of his person.  And that very day, on venturing forth, my estimable colleague suddenly found himself hustled by a ferocious throng, from whose hands he was with great difficulty rescued by the municipal guard.  He left Lyons that night; and for recompense of his services received a sharp reprimand from his chief.  He had committed the worst offence in our profession, _trop de zele_.  Having only heard the outlines of this story from another, I repaired to my _confrere_ after my last interview with Monsieur, and learned what I now tell you from his own lips.  As he was not in my branch of the service, I could not order him to return to Lyons; and I doubt whether his chief would have allowed it.  But I went to Lyons myself, and there ascertained that our supposed Vicomte had left that town for Paris some months ago, not long after the adventure of my colleague.  The man bore a very good character generally,--was said to be very honest and inoffensive; and the notice taken of him by persons of higher rank was attributed generally to a respect for his talents, and not on account of any sympathy in political opinions.  I found that the confrere mentioned, and who alone could identify M. de Mauleon in the disguise which the Vicomte had assumed, was absent on one of those missions abroad in which he is chiefly employed.  I had to wait for his return, and it was only the day before yesterday that I obtained the following particulars.  M. de Mauleon bears the same name as he did at Lyons,--that name is Jean Lebeau; he exercises the ostensible"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7740"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 04 (#7)"],["body","of a 'letter-writer,' and a sort of adviser on business among the workmen and petty bourgeoisie, and he nightly frequents the cafe Jean Jacques, Rue Faubourg Montmartre. It is not yet quite half-past eight, and, no doubt, you could see him at the cafe this very night, if you thought proper to go.\"  \"Excellent!  I will go!  Describe him!\"  \"Alas! that is exactly what I cannot do at present; for after hearing what I now tell you, I put the same request you do to my colleague, when, before he could answer me, he was summoned to the bureau of his chief, promising to return and give me the requisite description.  He did not return; and I find that he was compelled, on quitting his chief, to seize the first train starting for Lille upon an important political investigation which brooked no delay.  He will be back in a few days, and then Monsieur shall have the description.\"  \"Nay; I think I will seize time by the forelock, and try my chance tonight.  If the man be really a conspirator, and it looks likely enough, who knows but what he may see quick reason to take alarm and vanish from Paris at any hour?--Cafe Jean Jacques, Rue ------; I will go.  Stay; you have seen Victor de Mauleon in his youth: what was he like then?\"  \"Tall, slender, but broad-shouldered, very erect, carrying his head high, a profusion of dark curls, a small black mustache, fair clear complexion, light-coloured eyes with dark lashes, _fort bel homme_.  But he will not look like that now.\"  \"His present age?\"  \"Forty-seven or forty-eight.  But before you go, I must beg you to consider well what you are about.  It is evident that M. de Mauleon has some strong reason, whatever it be, for merging his identity in that of Jean Lebeau.  I presume, therefore, that you could scarcely go up to M. Lebeau, when you have discovered him, and say, 'Pray, Monsieur le Vicomte, can you give me some tidings of your niece, Louise Duval?'  If you thus accosted him, you might possibly bring some danger on yourself, but you would certainly gain no information from him.\"  \"True.\"  On the other hand, if you make his acquaintance as M. Lebeau, how can you assume him to know anything about Louise Duval?\"  \"Parbleu!  Monsieur Renard, you try to toss me aside on both horns of the dilemma; but it seems to me that, if I once make his acquaintance as M. Lebeau, I might gradually and cautiously feel my way as to the best mode of putting the question to which I seek reply.  I suppose, too, that the man must be in very poor circumstances to adopt so humble a calling, and that a small sum of money may smooth all difficulties.\"  \"I am not so sure of that,\" said M. Renard, thoughtfully; \"but grant that money may do so, and grant also that the Vicomte, being a needy man, has become a very unscrupulous one,--is there anything in your motives for discovering Louise Duval which might occasion you trouble and annoyance, if it were divined by a needy and unscrupulous man; anything which might give him a power of threat or exaction?  Mind, I am not asking you to tell me any secret you have reasons for concealing, but I suggest that it might be prudent if you did not let M. Lebeau know your real name and rank; if, in short, you could follow his example, and adopt a disguise. But no; when I think of it, you would doubtless be so unpractised in the art of disguise that he would detect you at once to be other than you seem; and if suspecting you of spying into his secrets, and if those secrets be really of a political nature, your very life might not be safe.\"  \"Thank you for your hint; the disguise is an excellent idea, and combines amusement with precaution.  That this Victor de Mauleon must be a very unprincipled and dangerous man is, I think, abundantly clear.  Granting that he was innocent of all design of robbery in the affair of the jewels, still, the offence which he did own--that of admitting himself at night by a false key into the rooms of a wife, whom he sought to surprise or terrify into dishonour--was a villanous action; and his present course of life is sufficiently mysterious to warrant the most unfavourable supposition.  Besides, there is another motive for concealing my name from him: you say that he once had a duel with a Vane, who was very probably my father, and I have no wish to expose myself to the chance of his turning up in London some day, and seeking to renew there the acquaintance that I had courted at Paris.  As for my skill in playing any part I may assume, do not fear; I am no novice in that.  In my younger days I was thought clever in private theatricals, especially in the transformations of appearance which belong to light comedy and farce. Wait a few minutes, and you shall see.\"  Graham then retreated into his bedroom, and in a few minutes reappeared so changed, that Renard at first glance took him for a stranger.  He had doffed his dress--which habitually, when in Capitals, was characterized by the quiet, indefinable elegance that to a man of the great world, high-bred and young, seems \"to the manner born\"--for one of those coarse suits which Englishmen are wont to wear in their travels, and by which they are represented in French or German caricatures,--loose jacket of tweed with redundant pockets, waistcoat to match, short dust-coloured trousers.  He had combed his hair straight over his forehead, which, as I have said somewhere before, appeared in itself to alter the character of his countenance, and, without any resort to paints or cosmetics, had somehow or other given to the expression of his face an impudent, low- bred expression, with a glass screwed on to his right eye,--such a look as a cockney journeyman, wishing to pass for a \"swell\" about town, may cast on a servant-maid in the pit of a suburban theatre.  \"Will it do, old fellow?\" he exclaimed, in a rollicking, swaggering tone of voice, speaking French with a villanous British accent.  \"Perfectly,\" said Renard, laughing.  \"I offer my compliments, and if ever you are ruined, Monsieur, I will promise you a place in our police.  Only one caution,--take care not to overdo your part.\"  \"Right.  A quarter to nine; I'm off.\"     CHAPTER VI.  There is generally a brisk exhilaration of spirits in the return to any special amusement or light accomplishment associated with the pleasant memories of earlier youth; and remarkably so, I believe, when the amusement or accomplishment has been that of the amateur stage-player. Certainly I have known persons of very grave pursuits, of very dignified character and position, who seem to regain the vivacity of boyhood when disguising look and voice for a part in some drawing-room comedy or charade.  I might name statesmen of solemn repute rejoicing to raise and to join in a laugh at their expense in such travesty of their habitual selves.  The reader must not therefore be surprised, nor, I trust, deem it inconsistent with the more serious attributes of Graham's character, if the Englishman felt the sort of joyful excitement I describe, as, in his way to the cafe Jean Jacques, he meditated the role he had undertaken; and the joyousness was heightened beyond the mere holiday sense of humouristic pleasantry by the sanguine hope that much to effect his lasting happiness might result from the success of the object for which his disguise was assumed.  It was just twenty minutes past nine when he arrived at the cafe Jean Jacques.  He dismissed the _fiacre_ and entered.  The apartment devoted to customers comprised two large rooms.  The first was the cafe properly speaking; the second, opening on it, was the billiard-room.  Conjecturing that he should probably find the person of whom he was in quest employed at the billiard-table, Graham passed thither at once.  A tall man, who might be seven-and-forty, with a long black beard, slightly grizzled, was at play with a young man of perhaps twenty-eight, who gave him odds,--as better players of twenty-eight ought to give odds to a player, though originally of equal force, whose eye is not so quick, whose hand is not so steady, as they were twenty years ago. Said Graham to himself, \"The bearded man is my Vicomte.\"  He called for a cup of coffee, and seated himself on a bench at the end of the room.  The bearded man was far behind in the game.  It was his turn to play; the balls were placed in the most awkward position for him.  Graham himself was a fair billiard-player, both in the English and the French game.  He said to himself, \"No man who can make a cannon there should accept odds.\"  The bearded man made a cannon; the bearded man continued to make cannons; the bearded man did not stop till he had won the game. The gallery of spectators was enthusiastic.  Taking care to speak in very bad, very English-French, Graham expressed to one of the enthusiasts seated beside him his admiration of the bearded man's playing, and ventured to ask if the bearded man were a professional or an amateur player.  \"Monsieur,\" replied the enthusiast, taking a short cutty-pipe from his mouth, \"it is an amateur, who has been a great player in his day, and is so proud that he always takes less odds than he ought of a younger man. It is not once in a month that he comes out as he has done to-night; but to-night he has steadied his hand.  He has had six petits verres.\"  \"Ah, indeed!  Do you know his name?\"  \"I should think so: he buried my father, my two aunts, and my wife.\"  \"Buried?\" said Graham, more and more British in his accent; \"I don't understand.\"  \"Monsieur, you are English.\"  \"I confess it.\"  \"And a stranger to the Faubourg Montmartre.\"  \"True.\"  \"Or you would have heard of M. Giraud, the liveliest member of the State Company for conducting funerals.  They are going to play La Poule.\"  Much disconcerted, Graham retreated into the cafe, and seated himself haphazard at one of the small tables.  Glancing round the room, he saw no one in whom he could conjecture the once brilliant Vicomte.  The company appeared to him sufficiently decent,"]]]
