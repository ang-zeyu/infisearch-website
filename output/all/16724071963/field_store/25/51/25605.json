And of course then he was.'  'How awful!' said the children all together.  'Only till sunset, of course,' the Psammead said; 'still it was quite enough for his father and mother.  And he caught it when he woke up - I can tell you.  He didn't turn to stone - I forget why - but there must have been some reason.  They didn't know being dead is only being asleep, and you're bound to wake up somewhere or other, either where you go to sleep or in some better place.  You may be sure he caught it, giving them such a turn.  Why, he wasn't allowed to taste Megatherium for a month after that.  Nothing but oysters and periwinkles, and common things like that.'  All the children were quite crushed by this terrible tale.  They looked at the Psammead in horror.  Suddenly the Lamb perceived that something brown and furry was near him.  'Poof, poof, poofy,' he said, and made a grab.  'It's not a pussy,' Anthea was beginning, when the Sand-fairy leaped back.  'Oh, my left whisker!' it said; 'don't let him touch me.  He's wet.'  Its fur stood on end with horror - and indeed a good deal of the ginger-beer had been spilt on the blue smock of the Lamb.  The Psammead dug with its hands and feet, and vanished in an instant and a whirl of sand.  The children marked the spot with a ring of stones.  'We may as well get along home,' said Robert.  'I'll say I'm sorry; but anyway if it's no good it's no harm, and we know where the sandy thing is for to-morrow.'  The others were noble.  No one reproached Robert at all.  Cyril picked up the Lamb, who was now quite himself again, and off they went by the safe cart-road.  The cart-road from the gravel-pits joins the road almost directly.  At the gate into the road the party stopped to shift the Lamb from Cyril's back to Robert's.  And as they paused a very smart open carriage came in sight, with a coachman and a groom on the box, and inside the carriage a lady - very grand indeed, with a dress all white lace and red ribbons and a parasol all red and white - and a white fluffy dog on her lap with a red ribbon round its neck.  She looked at the children, and particularly at the Baby, and she smiled at him.  The children were used to this, for the Lamb was, as all the servants said, a 'very taking child'.  So they waved their hands politely to the lady and expected her to drive on.  But she did not.  Instead she made the coachman stop.  And she beckoned to Cyril, and when he went up to the carriage she said:  'What a dear darling duck of a baby!  Oh, I SHOULD so like to adopt it!  Do you think its mother would mind?'  'She'd mind very much indeed,' said Anthea shortly.  'Oh, but I should bring it up in luxury, you know.  I am Lady Chittenden.  You must have seen my photograph in the illustrated papers.  They call me a beauty, you know, but of course that's all nonsense.  Anyway -'  She opened the carriage door and jumped out.  She had the wonderfullest red high-heeled shoes with silver buckles.  'Let me hold him a minute,' she said.  And she took the Lamb and held him very awkwardly, as if she was not used to babies.  Then suddenly she jumped into the carriage with the Lamb in her arms and slammed the door and said, 'Drive on!'  The Lamb roared, the little white dog barked, and the coachman hesitated.  'Drive on, I tell you!' cried the lady; and the coachman did, for, as he said afterwards, it was as much as his place was worth not to.  The four children looked at each other, and then with one accord they rushed after the carriage and held on behind.  Down the dusty road went the smart carriage, and after it, at double-quick time, ran the twinkling legs of the Lamb's brothers and sisters.  The Lamb howled louder and louder, but presently his howls changed by slow degree to hiccupy gurgles, and then all was still and they knew he had gone to sleep.  The carriage went on, and the eight feet that twinkled through the dust were growing quite stiff and tired before the carriage stopped at the lodge of a grand park.  The children crouched down behind the carriage, and the lady got out.  She looked at the Baby as it lay on the carriage seat, and hesitated.  'The darling - I won't disturb it,' she said, and went into the lodge to talk to the woman there about a setting of Buff Orpington eggs that had not turned out well.  The coachman and footman sprang from the box and bent over the sleeping Lamb.  'Fine boy - wish he was mine,' said the coachman.  'He wouldn't favour YOU much,' said the groom sourly; 'too 'andsome.'  The coachman pretended not to hear.  He said:  'Wonder at her now - I do really!  Hates kids.  Got none of her own, and can't abide other folkses'.'  The children, crouching in the white dust under the carriage, exchanged uncomfortable glances.  'Tell you what,' the coachman went on firmly, 'blowed if I don't hide the little nipper in the hedge and tell her his brothers took 'im!  Then I'll come back for him afterwards.'  'No, you don't,' said the footman.  'I've took to that kid so as never was.  If anyone's to have him, it's me - so there!'  'Stow your gab!' the coachman rejoined.  'You don't want no kids, and, if you did, one kid's the same as another to you.  But I'm a married man and a judge of breed.  I knows a first-rate yearling when I sees him.  I'm a-goin' to 'ave him, an' least said soonest mended.'  'I should 'a' thought,' said the footman sneeringly, you'd a'most enough.  What with Alfred, an' Albert, an' Louise, an' Victor Stanley, and Helena Beatrice, and another -'  The coachman hit the footman in the chin - the foot- man hit the coachman in the waistcoat - the next minute the two were fighting here and there, in and out, up and down, and all over everywhere, and the little dog jumped on the box of the carriage and began barking like mad.  Cyril, still crouching in the dust, waddled on bent legs to the side of the carriage farthest from the battlefield.  He unfastened the door of the carriage - the two men were far too much occupied with their quarrel to notice anything - took the Lamb in his arms, and, still stooping, carried the sleeping baby a dozen yards along the road to where a stile led into a wood.  The others followed, and there among the hazels and young oaks and sweet chestnuts, covered by high strong-scented bracken, they all lay hidden till the angry voices of the men were hushed at the angry voice of the red-and-white lady, and, after a long and anxious search, the carriage at last drove away.  'My only hat!' said Cyril, drawing a deep breath as the sound of wheels at last died away.  'Everyone DOES want him now - and no mistake!  That Sammyadd has done us again!  Tricky brute!  For any sake, let's get the kid safe home.'  So they peeped out, and finding on the right hand only lonely white road, and nothing but lonely white road on the left, they took courage, and the road, Anthea carrying the sleeping Lamb.  Adventures dogged their footsteps.  A boy with a bundle of faggots on his back dropped his bundle by the roadside and asked to look at the Baby, and then offered to carry him; but Anthea was not to be caught that way twice.  They all walked on, but the boy followed, and Cyril and Robert couldn't make him go away till they had more than once invited him to smell their fists.  Afterwards a little girl in a blue-and-white checked pinafore actually followed them for a quarter of a mile crying for 'the precious Baby', and then she was only got rid of by threats of tying her to a tree in the wood with all their pocket-handkerchiefs.  'So that the bears can come and eat you as soon as it gets dark,' said Cyril severely. Then she went off crying.  It presently seemed wise, to the brothers and sisters of the Baby, who was wanted by everyone, to hide in the hedge whenever they saw anyone coming, and thus they managed to prevent the Lamb from arousing the inconvenient affection of a milkman, a stone-breaker, and a man who drove a cart with a paraffin barrel at the back of it.  They were nearly home when the worst thing of all happened.  Turning a corner suddenly they came upon two vans, a tent, and a company of gipsies encamped by the side of the road.  The vans were hung all round with wicker chairs and cradles, and flower-stands and feather brushes.  A lot of ragged children were industriously making dust-pies in the road, two men lay on the grass smoking, and three women were doing the family washing in an old red watering-can with the top broken off.  In a moment all the gipsies, men, women, and children, surrounded Anthea and the Baby.  'Let me hold him, little lady,' said one of the gipsy women, who had a mahogany-coloured face and dust-coloured hair; 'I won't hurt a hair of his head, the little picture!'  'I'd rather not,' said Anthea.  'Let me have him,' said the other woman, whose face was also of the hue of mahogany, and her hair jet-black, in greasy curls.  'I've nineteen of my own, so I have.'  'No,' said Anthea bravely, but her heart beat so that it nearly choked her.  Then one of the men pushed forward.  'Swelp me if it ain't!' he cried, 'my own long-lost cheild!  Have he a strawberry mark on his left ear?  No?  Then he's my own babby, stolen from me in hinnocent hinfancy.  'And 'im over - and we'll not 'ave the law on yer this time.'  He snatched the Baby from Anthea, who turned scarlet and burst into tears of pure rage.  The others were standing quite still; this was much the most terrible thing that had ever happened to them.  Even being taken up by the police in Rochester was nothing to this.  Cyril was quite white, and his hands trembled a little, but he made a sign to the others to shut up.  He was silent a minute, thinking hard.  Then he said:  'We don't want to keep him if he's yours.  But you see he's used to us.  You shall have him if you want him.'  'No, no!' cried Anthea - and Cyril glared at her.  'Of course we want him,' said"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7787"],["title","A Complete Grammar of Esperanto (#0)"],["body","TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:  The Esperanto alphabet contains 28 characters. These are the characters of English, but with \"q\", \"w\", \"x\", and \"y\" removed, and six diacritical letters added. The diacritical letters are \"c\", \"g\", \"h\", \"j\" and \"s\" with circumflexes (or \"hats\", as Esperantists fondly call them), and \"u\" with a breve. Zamenhof himself suggested that where the diacritical letters caused difficulty, one could instead use \"ch\", \"gh\", \"hh\", \"jh\", \"sh\" and \"u\". A plain ASCII file is one such place; there are no ASCII codes for Esperanto's special letters.  However, there are two problems with Zamenhof's \"h-method\". There is no difference between \"u\" and \"u\" with a breve, and there is no way to determine (without prior knowledge of the word(s) involved, and sometimes a bit of context) whether an \"h\" following one of those other five letters is really the second half of a diacritical pair, or just an \"h\" that happened to find itself next to one of them. Consequently other, unambiguous, methods have been used over the years. One is the \"x-method\", which uses the digraphs \"cx\", \"gx\", \"hx\", \"jx\", \"sx\" and \"ux\" to represent the special letters. There is no ambiguity because the letter \"x\" is not an Esperanto letter, and each diacritical letter has a unique transliteration. This is the method used in this Project Gutenberg e-text.

L. L. ZAMENHOF                               THE AUTHOR OF                                ESPERANTO                      *       *       *       *       *                                   PREFACE.  This volume has been prepared to meet a twofold need. An adequate presentation of the International Language has become an imperative necessity. Such presentation, including full and accurate grammatical explanations, suitably graded reading lessons, and similarly graded material for translation from English, has not heretofore been accessible within the compass of a single volume, or in fact within the compass of any two or three volumes.  The combination of grammar and reader here offered is therefore unique. It is to furnish not merely an introduction to Esperanto, or a superficial acquaintance with it, but a genuine understanding of the language and mastery of its use without recourse to additional textbooks, readers, etc. In other words, this one volume affords as complete a knowledge of Esperanto as several years' study of a grammar and various readers will accomplish for any national language. Inflection, word-formation and syntax are presented clearly and concisely, yet with a degree of completeness and in a systematic order that constitute a new feature. Other points worthy of note are the following:  The reasons for syntactical usages are given, instead of mere statements that such usages exist. For example, clauses of purpose and of result are really explained, instead of being dismissed with the unsatisfactory remark that \"the imperative follows 'por ke,'\" or the \"use of 'tiel ... ke' and 'tia ... ke' must be distinguished from that of 'tiel ... kiel' and 'tia ... kia,'\" etc., with but little intimation of when and why \"por ke\", \"tiel ... ke\" and \"tia ... ke\" are likely to occur.  Affixes are not mentioned until some familiarity with the general character of the language is assured, as well as the possession of a fair vocabulary. They are introduced gradually, with adequate explanation and illustration. Of importance in connection with word-formation is an element distinctly new--the explanation and classification of compound words. Such words, like affixes, are withheld until the use of simple words is familiar.  Another new feature is the gradual introduction of correlative words in their logical order, and in their proper grammatical categories, before they are called \"correlatives,\" or tabulated. The tabulation finally presented is a real classification, with regard to the meaning and grammatical character of the words, not merely an arbitrary alphabetical arrangement. The use of primary adverbs precedes the explanation of adverb derivation; prepositions, especially \"de\", \"da\", \"je\", etc., receive careful attention, also the verb system, and the differentiation of words whose English equivalents are ambiguous.  A general characteristic of obvious advantage is that almost without exception new forms and constructions are illustrated by means of words or roots already familiar. Likewise, the new words or roots of each lesson recur at least once in the next lesson, and usually in some lesson thereafter as well. Each reading exercise gives not only a thorough application of the grammatical principles of the lesson, but a review of those in the preceding lesson, and no use is made of words or constructions not yet explained. The comparative ease of the language, and the lack of necessity for reciting paradigms, permit the reading exercises to be long enough for the student to feel that he has really mastered something. These exercises are further unique, in that each after the fifth is a coherent narrative, and nearly every one is a story of genuine interest in itself. These stories, if bound separately, would alone constitute a reader equivalent to those used in first and second year work in national languages. (For list of titles, see Table of Contents.)  The second element of the twofold need which this volume meets is the necessity for a presentation of Esperanto, not as a thing apart, but in that form which will make it most serviceable as an introduction to national tongues. A stepping-stone to both ancient and modern languages, Esperanto may render invaluable aid, and pave the way for surmounting the many difficulties confronting both student and teacher. Through Esperanto, the labor in the acquirement of these languages may be reduced in the same proportion in which the pleasure and thoroughness of such acquirement are increased. For this reason, the grammatical constructions of Esperanto are here explained as consistently as possible in accordance with the usage of national languages, especially those in the school curriculum, and precise names are assigned to them. Such matters as \"contrary to fact conditions\", \"indirect quotations\", \"clauses of purpose\" and \"of result\", \"accusatives of time\" and \"measure\", \"expressions of separation\", \"reference\", etc., thus become familiar to the student, long before he meets them in the more difficult garb of a national tongue, whose exceptions seem to outnumber its rules, and whose idioms prove more puzzling than its exceptions, unless approached by the smooth and gradual ascent of the International Language, Esperanto.
