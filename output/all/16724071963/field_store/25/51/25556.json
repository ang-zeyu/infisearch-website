His taste acknowledged the beauty of form which clothed them; his heart envied the ideal that inspired them.  But they seemed so remote from him; they put the dreamland of the writer farther and farther from his workday real life.  In this frame of mind, then, he had written to Savarin, and the answer he received hardened it still more.  Savarin had replied, as was his laudable wont in correspondence, the very day he received Graham's letter, and therefore before he had even seen Isaura.  In his reply, he spoke much of the success her work had obtained; of the invitations showered upon her, and the sensation she caused in the salons; of her future career, with hope that she might even rival Madame de Grantmesnil some day, when her ideas became emboldened by maturer experience, and a closer study of that model of eloquent style,--saying that the young editor was evidently becoming enamoured of his fair contributor; and that Madame Savarin had ventured the prediction that the Signorina's _roman_ would end in the death of the heroine, and the marriage of the writer.     CHAPTER V.  And still the weeks glided on: autumn succeeded to summer, the winter to autumn; the season of Paris was at its height.  The wondrous capital seemed to repay its Imperial embellisher by the splendour and the joy of its _fetes_.  But the smiles on the face of Paris were hypocritical and hollow.  The Empire itself had passed out of fashion.  Grave men and impartial observers felt anxious.  Napoleon had renounced _les ideas Napoleoniennes_.  He was passing into the category of constitutional sovereigns, and reigning, not by his old undivided prestige, but by the grace of party.  The press was free to circulate complaints as to the past and demands as to the future, beneath which the present reeled, ominous of earthquake.  People asked themselves if it were possible that the Empire could co-exist with forms of government not imperial, yet not genuinely constitutional, with a majority daily yielding to a minority. The basis of universal suffrage was sapped.  About this time the articles in the \"Sens Commun\" signed Pierre Firmin were creating not only considerable sensation, but marked effect on opinion; and the sale of the journal was immense.  Necessarily the repute and the position of Gustave Rameau, as the avowed editor of this potent journal, rose with its success.  Nor only his repute and position; bank-notes of considerable value were transmitted to him by the publisher, with the brief statement that they were sent by the sole proprietor of the paper as the editor's fair share of profit.  The proprietor was never named, but Rameau took it for granted that it was M. Lebeau.  M. Lebeau he had never seen since the day he had brought him the list of contributors, and was then referred to the publisher, whom he supposed M. Lebeau had secured, and received the first quarter of his salary in advance.  The salary was a trifle compared to the extra profits thus generously volunteered.  He called at Lebeau's office, and saw only the clerk, who said that his chef was abroad.  Prosperity produced a marked change for the better, if not in the substance of Rameau's character, at least in his manners and social converse.  He no longer exhibited that restless envy of rivals, which is the most repulsive symptom of vanity diseased.  He pardoned Isaura her success; nay, he was even pleased at it.  The nature of her work did not clash with his own kind of writing.  It was so thoroughly woman like that one could not compare it to a man's.  Moreover, that success had contributed largely to the profits by which he had benefited, and to his renown as editor of the journal which accorded place to this new-found genius.  But there was a deeper and more potent cause for sympathy with the success of his fair young contributor.  He had imperceptibly glided into love with her,--a love very different from that with which poor Julie Caumartin flattered herself she had inspired the young poet. Isaura was one of those women for whom, even in natures the least chivalric, love, however ardent, cannot fail to be accompanied with a certain reverence,--the reverence with which the ancient knighthood, in its love for women, honoured the ideal purity of womanhood itself.  Till then Rameau had never revered any one.  On her side, brought so frequently into communication with the young conductor of the journal in which she wrote, Isaura entertained for him a friendly, almost sister-like affection.  I do not think that, even if she had never known the Englishman, she would have really become in love with Rameau, despite the picturesque beauty of his countenance and the congeniality of literary pursuits; but perhaps she might have fancied herself in love with him.  And till one, whether man or woman, has known real love, fancy is readily mistaken for it.  But little as she had seen of Graham, and that little not in itself wholly favourable to him, she knew in her heart of hearts that his image would never be replaced by one equally dear.  Perhaps in those qualities that placed him in opposition to her she felt his attractions.  The poetical in woman exaggerates the worth of the practical in man.  Still for Rameau her exquisitely kind and sympathizing nature conceived one of those sentiments which in woman are almost angel-like.  We have seen in her letters to Madame de Grantmesnil that from the first he inspired her with a compassionate interest; then the compassion was checked by her perception of his more unamiable and envious attributes.  But now those attributes, if still existent, had ceased to be apparent to her, and the compassion became unalloyed.  Indeed, it was thus so far increased that it was impossible for any friendly observer to look at the beautiful face of this youth, prematurely wasted and worn, without the kindliness of pity.  His prosperity had brightened and sweetened the expression of that face, but it had not effaced the vestiges of decay; rather perhaps deepened them, for the duties of his post necessitated a regular labour, to which he had been unaccustomed, and the regular labour necessitated, or seemed to him to necessitate, an increase of fatal stimulants.  He imbibed absinthe with everything he drank, and to absinthe he united opium.  This, of course, Isaura knew not, any more than she knew of his _liaison_ with the \"Ondine\" of his muse; she saw only the increasing delicacy of his face and form, contrasted by his increased geniality and liveliness of spirits, and the contrast saddened her.  Intellectually, too, she felt for him compassion.  She recognized and respected in him the yearnings of a genius too weak to perform a tithe of what, in the arrogance of youth, it promised to its ambition.  She saw, too, those struggles between a higher and a lower self, to which a weak degree of genius united with a strong degree of arrogance is so often subjected. Perhaps she overestimated the degree of genius, and what, if rightly guided, it could do; but she did, in the desire of her own heavenlier instinct, aspire to guide it heavenward.  And as if she were twenty years older than himself, she obeyed that desire in remonstrating and warning and urging, and the young man took all these \"preachments\" with a pleased submissive patience.  Such, as the new year dawned upon the grave of the, old one, was the position between these two.  And nothing more was heard from Graham Vane.     CHAPTER VI.  It has now become due to Graham Vane, and to his place in the estimation of my readers, to explain somewhat more distinctly the nature of the quest in prosecution of which he had sought the aid of the Parisian police, and under an assumed name made the acquaintance of M. Lebeau.  The best way of discharging this duty will perhaps be to place before the reader the contents of the letter which passed under Graham's eyes on the day in which the heart of the writer ceased to beat.   (Confidential.  To be opened immediately after my death, and before the perusal of my will.--Richard King.)  TO GRAHAM VANE, Esq.  My DEAR GRAHAM,--By the direction on the envelope of this letter, \"Before the perusal of my will,\" I have wished to save you from the disappointment you would naturally experience if you learned my bequest without being prevised of the conditions which I am about to impose upon your honour.  You will see ere you conclude this letter that you are the only man living to whom I could intrust the secret it contains and the task it enjoins.  You are aware that I was not born to the fortune that passed to me by the death of a distant relation, who had, in my earlier youth, children of his own.  I was an only son, left an orphan at the age of sixteen with a very slender pittance.  My guardians designed me for the medical profession.  I began my studies at Edinburgh, and was sent to Paris to complete them,  It so chanced that there I lodged in the same house with an artist named Auguste Duval, who, failing to gain his livelihood as a painter, in what--for his style was ambitious--is termed the Historical School, had accepted the humbler calling of a drawing-master.  He had practised in that branch of the profession for several years at Tours, having a good clientele among English families settled there.  This clientele, as he frankly confessed, he had lost from some irregularities of conduct.  He was not a bad man, but of convivial temper, and easily led into temptation.  He had removed to Paris a few months before I made his acquaintance.  He obtained a few pupils, and often lost them as soon as gained.  He was unpunctual and addicted to drink.  But he had a small pension,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7742"],["title","The Parisians — Volume 06 (#7)"],["body","to him, he was wont to say mysteriously, by some high- born kinsfolk, too proud to own connection with a drawing-master, and on the condition that he should never name them.  He never did name them to me, and I do not know to this day whether the story of this noble relationship was true or false.  A pension, however, he did receive quarterly from some person or other, and it was an unhappy provision for him.  It tended to make him an idler in his proper calling; and whenever he received the payment he spent it in debauch, to the neglect, while it lasted, of his pupils.  This man had residing with him a young daughter, singularly beautiful.  You may divine the rest.  I fell in love with her,--a love deepened by the compassion with which she inspired me.  Her father left her so frequently that, living on the same floor, we saw much of each other.  Parent and child were often in great need,--lacking even fuel or food.  Of course I assisted them to the utmost of my scanty means Much as I was fascinated by Louise Duval, I was not blind to great defects in her character.  She was capricious, vain, aware of her beauty, and sighing for the pleasures or the gauds beyond her reach.  I knew that she did not love me,--there was little, indeed, to  captivate  her fancy in  a poor, thread-bare medical student,--and yet I fondly imagined that my own persevering devotion would at length win her affections,  I spoke to her father more than once of my hope some day to make Louise my wife. This hope, I must frankly acknowledge, he never encouraged.  On the contrary, he treated it with scorn,--\"His child with her beauty would look much higher;\" but be continued all the same to accept my assistance, and to sanction my visits.  At length my slender purse was pretty well exhausted, and the luckless drawing-master was so harassed with petty debts that further credit became impossible.  At this time I happened to hear from a fellow-student that his sister, who was the principal of a lady's school in Cheltenham, bad commissioned him to look out for a first-rate teacher of drawing with whom her elder pupils could converse in French, but who should be sufficiently acquainted with English to make his instructions intelligible to the young.  The salary was liberal, the school large and of high repute, and his appointment to it would open to an able teacher no inconsiderable connection among private families.  I communicated this intelligence to Duval.  He caught at it eagerly.  He had learned at Tours to speak English fluently; and as his professional skill was of high order, and he was popular with several eminent artists, he obtained certificates as to his talents, which my fellow-student forwarded to England with specimens of Duval's drawings.  In a few days the offer of an engagement arrived, was accepted, and Duval and his daughter set out for Cheltenham.  At the eve of their departure, Louise, profoundly dejected at the prospect of banishment to a foreign country, and placing no trust in her father's reform to steady habits, evinced a tenderness for me hitherto new; she wept bitterly; she allowed me to believe that her tears flowed at the thought of parting with me, and even besought me to accompany them to Cheltenham, if only for a few days.  You may suppose how delightedly I complied with the request.  Duval had been about a week at the watering place, and was discharging the duties he had undertaken with such unwonted steadiness and regularity that I began sorrowfully to feel I had no longer an excuse for not returning to my studies at Paris, when the poor teacher was seized with a fit of paralysis.  He lost the power of movement, and his mind was affected. The medical attendant called in said that he might linger thus for some time, but that, even if he recovered his intellect, which was more than doubtful, he would never be able to resume his profession.  I could not leave Louise in circumstances so distressing,--I remained.  The little money Duval had brought from Paris was now exhausted; and when the day on which he had been in the habit of receiving his quarter's pension came round, Louise was unable even to conjecture how it was to be applied for. It seems he had always gone for it in perscn; but to whom he went was a secret which he bad never divulged, and at this critical juncture his mind was too enfeebled even to comprehend us when we inquired.  I had already drawn from the small capital on the interest of which I had maintained myself; I now drew out most of the remainder.  But this was a resource that could not last long.  Nor could I, without seriously compromising Louise's character, be constantly in the house with a girl so young, and whose sole legitimate protector was thus afflicted.  There seemed but one alternative to that of abandoning her altogether,--namely, to make her my wife, to conclude the studies necessary to obtain my diploma, and purchase some partnership in a small country practice with the scanty surplus that might be left of my capital.  I placed this option before Louise timidly, for I could not bear the thought of forcing her inclinations.  She seemed much moved by what she called my generosity: she consented; we were married.  I was, as you may conceive, wholly ignorant of French law.  We were married according to the English ceremony and the Protestant ritual.  Shortly after our marriage we all three returned to Paris, taking an apartment in a quarter remote from that in which we had before lodged, in order to avoid any, harassment to which such small creditors as Duval had left behind him might subject us. I resumed my studies with redoubled energy, and Louise was necessarily left much alone with her poor father in the daytime.  The defects in her character became more and more visible.  She reproached me for the solitude to which I condemned her; our poverty galled her; she had no kind greeting for me when I returned at evening, wearied out.  Before marriage she had not loved me; after marriage, alas!  I fear she hated. We had been returned to Paris some months when poor Duval died; he had never recovered his faculties, nor had we ever learned from whom his pension had been received.  Very soon after her father's death I observed a singular change in the humour and manner of Louise.  She was no longer peevish, irascible, reproachful; but taciturn and thoughtful.  She seemed to me under the influence of some suppressed excitement, her cheeks flushed and her eye abstracted.  At length, one evening when I returned I found her gone.  She did not come back that night nor the next day. It was impossible for me to conjecture what had become of her.  She had no friends, so far as I knew; no one had visited at our squalid apartment.  The poor house in which we lodged had no concierge whom I could question; but the ground-floor was occupied by a small tobacconist's shop, and the woman at the counter told me that for some days before my wife's disappearance, she had observed her pass the shop- window in going out in the afternoon and returning towards the evening. Two terrible conjectures beset me either in her walk she had met some admirer, with whom she had fled; or, unable to bear the companionship and poverty of a union which she had begun to loathe, she had gone forth to drown herself in the Seine.  On the third day from her flight I received the letter I enclose.  Possibly the handwriting may serve you as a guide in the mission I intrust to you.       MONSIEUR,--You have deceived me vilely,--taken advantage of my      inexperienced youth and friendless position to decoy me into an      illegal marriage.  My only consolation under my calamity and      disgrace is, that I am at least free from a detested bond.  You will      not see me again,--it is idle to attempt to do so.  I have obtained      refuge with relations whom I have been fortunate enough to discover,      and to whom I intrust my fate; and even if you could learn the      shelter I have sought, and have the audacity to molest me, you would      but subject yourself to the chastisement you so richly deserve.                                          Louise DUVAL.  At the perusal of this cold-hearted, ungrateful letter, the love I had felt for this woman--already much shaken by her wayward and perverse temper--vanished from my heart, never to return.  But as an honest man, my conscience was terribly stung.  Could it be possible that I had unknowingly deceived her,--that our marriage was not legal?  When I recovered from the stun which was the first effect of her letter, I sought the opinion of an _avoue_ in the neighbourbood, named Sartiges, and to my dismay, I learned that while I, marrying according to the customs of my own country, was legally bound to Louise in England, and could not marry another, the marriage was in all ways illegal for her,-- being without the consent of her relations while she was under age; without the ceremonials of the Roman Catholic Church,--to which, though I never heard any profession of religious belief from her or her father, it might fairly be presumed that she belonged; and, above all, without the form of civil contract which is indispensable to the legal marriage of a French subject.  The _avoue_ said that the marriage, therefore, in itself was null, and that Louise could, without incurring legal penalties for bigamy, marry again in France according to the French laws; but that under the circumstances it was probable that her next of kin would apply on her behalf to the proper court for the formal annulment of the marriage, which would be the most effectual mode of saving her from any molestation on my part, and remove all possible questions hereafter as to her single state and absolute right to remarry.  I had better remain quiet, and wait for intimation of further proceedings.  I knew not what else to do, and necessarily submitted.  From this wretched listlessness of mind, alternated now by"]]]
