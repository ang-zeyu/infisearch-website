I am timid in expressing this opinion, because I cannot form a sober judgment about an author whose personality I dislike.  In 1865, before the final breach with Turgenieff, he wrote, again to Fet: \"I do not like 'Enough'!\" A personal subjective treatment is never good unless it is full of life and passion; but the subjectivity in this case is full of lifeless suffering.  In the autumn of 1883, after Turgenieff's death, when the family had gone into Moscow for the winter, my father stayed at Yasnaya Polyana alone, with Agafya Mikhailovna, and set earnestly about reading through all Turgenieff's works.  This is what he wrote to my mother at the time:  I am always thinking about Turgenieff. I am intensely fond of him, and sorry for him, and do nothing but read him. I live entirely with him. I shall certainly give a lecture on him, or write it to be read; tell Yuryef.  \"Enough\"--read it; it is perfectly charming.  Unfortunately, my father's intended lecture on Turgenieff never came off. The Government forbade him to pay this last tribute to his dead friend, with whom he had quarreled all his life only because he could not be indifferent to him.                       (To be continued)      REMINISCENCES OF TOLSTOY (Part III.)  BY HIS SON, COUNT ILYA TOLSTOY  TRANSLATED BY GEORGE CALDERON  AT this point I shall turn back and try to trace the influence which my father had on my upbringing, and I shall recall as well as I can the impressions that he left on my mind in my childhood, and later in the melancholy days of my early manhood, which happened to coincide with the radical change in his whole philosophy of life.  In 1852, tired of life in the Caucasus and remembering his old home at Yasnaya Polyana, he wrote to his aunt, Tatyana Alexandrovna:  After some years, I shall find myself, neither very young nor very old, back at Yasnaya Polyana again: my affairs will all be in order; I shall have no anxieties for the future and no troubles in the present.  You also will be living at Yasnaya. You will be getting a little old, but you will be healthy and vigorous. We shall lead the life we led in the old days; I shall work in the mornings, but we shall meet and see each other almost all day.  We shall dine together in the evening. I shall read you something that interests you. Then we shall talk: I shall tell you about my life in the Caucasus; you will give me reminiscences of my father and mother; you will tell me some of those \"terrible stories\" to which we used to listen in the old days with frightened eyes and open mouths.  We shall talk about the people that we loved and who are no more.  You will cry, and I, too; but our tears will be refreshing, tranquilizing tears. We shall talk about my brothers, who will visit us from time to time, and about dear Masha, who will also spend several months every year at Yasnaya, which she loves, with all her children.  We shall have no acquaintances; no one will come in to bore us with gossip.  It is a wonderful dream; but that is not all that I let myself dream of.   I shall be married.  My wife will be gentle, kind, and affectionate; she will love you as I do; we shall have children who will call you granny; you will live in the big house, in the same room on the top floor where my grandmother lived before.  The whole house will be run on the same lines as it was in my father's time, and we shall begin the same life over again, but with a change of roles.   You will take my grandmother's place, but you will be better still than she was; I shall take my father's place, though I can never hope to be worthy of the honor.  My wife will take my mother's place, and the children ours.  Masha will fill the part of both my aunts, except for their sorrow; and there will even be Gasha there to take the place of Prashovya Ilyinitchna.  The only thing lacking will be some one to take the part you played in the life of our family. We shall never find such a noble and loving heart as yours. There is no one to succeed you.  There will be three new faces that will appear among us from time to time: my brothers, especially one who will often be with us, Nikolenka, who will be an old bachelor, bald, retired, always the same kindly, noble fellow.   Just ten years after this letter, my father married, and almost all his dreams were realized, just as he had wished. Only the big house, with his grandmother's room, was missing, and his brother Nikolenka, with the dirty hands, for he died two years before, in 1860. In his family life my father witnessed a repetition of the life of his parents, and in us children he sought to find a repetition of himself and his brothers. We were brought up as regular gentlefolk, proud of our social position and holding aloof from all the outer world. Everything that was not us was below us, and therefore unworthy of imitation. I knew that my father felt very earnestly about the chastity of young people; I knew how much strength he laid on purity. An early marriage seemed to me the best solution of the difficult question that must harass every thoughtful boy when he attains to man's estate.  Two or three years later, when I was eighteen and we were living in Moscow, I fell in love with a young lady I knew, my present wife, and went almost every Saturday to her father's house.  My father knew, but said nothing. One day when he was going out for a walk I asked if I might go with him. As I very seldom went for walks with him in Moscow, he guessed that I wanted to have a serious talk with him about something, and after walking some distance in silence, evidently feeling that I was shy about it and did not like to break the ice, he suddenly began:  \"You seem to go pretty often to the F----s'.\"  I said that I was very fond of the eldest daughter.  \"Oh, do you want to marry her?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Is she a good girl? Well, mind you don't make a mistake, and don't be false to her,\" he said with a curious gentleness and thoughtfulness.  I left him at once and ran back home, delighted, along the Arbat. I was glad that I had told him the truth, and his affectionate and cautious way of taking it strengthened my affection both for him, to whom I was boundlessly grateful for his cordiality, and for her, whom I loved still more warmly from that moment, and to whom I resolved still more fervently never to be untrue.  My father's tactfulness toward us amounted almost to timidity. There were certain questions which he could never bring himself to touch on for fear of causing us pain. I shall never forget how once in Moscow I found him sitting writing at the table in my room when I dashed in suddenly to change my clothes.  My bed stood behind a screen, which hid him from me.  When he heard my footsteps he said, without looking round:  \"Is that you, Ilya?\"  \"Yes, it's I.\"  \"Are you alone? Shut the door. There's no one to hear us, and we can't see each other, so we shall not feel ashamed. Tell me, did you ever have anything to do with women?\"  When I said no, I suddenly heard him break out sobbing, like a little child.  I sobbed and cried, too, and for a long time we stayed weeping tears of joy, with the screen between us, and we were neither of us ashamed, but both so joyful that I look on that moment as one of the happiest in my whole life.  No arguments or homilies could ever have effected what the emotion I experienced at that moment did. Such tears as those shed by a father of sixty can never be forgotten even in moments of the strongest temptation.  My father observed my inward life most attentively between the ages of sixteen and twenty, noted all my doubts and hesitations, encouraged me in my good impulses, and often found fault with me for inconsistency.  I still have some of his letters written at that time. Here are two:   I had just written you, my dear friend Ilya, a letter that was true to my own feelings, but, I am afraid, unjust, and I am not sending it. I said unpleasant things in it, but I have no right to do so. I do not know you as I should like to and as I ought to know you. That is my fault. And I wish to remedy it. I know much in you that I do not like, but I do not know everything. As for your proposed journey home, I think that in your position of student, not only student of a gymnase, but at the age of study, it is better to gad about as little as possible; moreover, all useless expenditure of money that you can easily refrain from is immoral, in my opinion, and in yours, too, if you only consider it. If you come, I shall be glad for my own sake, so long as you are not inseparable from G----.  Do as you think best. But you must work, both with your head, thinking and reading, and with your heart; that is, find out for yourself what is really good and what is bad, although it seems to be good. I kiss you.                                                         L. T.  Dear Friend Ilya:  There is always somebody or something that prevents me from answering your two letters, which are important and dear to me, especially the last. First it was Baturlin, then bad health, insomnia, then the arrival of D----, the friend of H---- that I wrote you about. He is sitting at tea talking to the ladies, neither understanding the other; so I left them, and want to write what little I can of all that I think about you.  Even supposing that S---- A---- demands too much of you, [19] there is no harm in waiting; especially from the point of view of fortifying your opinions, your faith. That is the one important thing. If you don't, it is a fearful disaster to put off from one shore and not reach the other.  The one shore is an honest and good life, for your own delight and the profit of others. But there is a bad life, too--a life so sugared, so common to all, that if you follow it, you do not notice that it is a bad life, and suffer only in your conscience, if you have one; but if you leave it, and do not reach the real shore, you will be made"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8153"],["title","The Young Engineers in Arizona; or, Laying Tracks on the Man-killer Quicksand (#0)"],["body","YOUNG ENGINEERS IN ARIZONA  or  LAYING TRACKS ON THE MAN-KILLER QUICKSAND    By H. Irving Handcock      CHAPTER I. THE MAN OF “CARD HONOR”   “I'll wager you ten dollars that my fly gets off the mirror before yours does.”  “I'll take that bet, friend.”  The dozen or so of waiting customers lounging in Abe Morris's barber shop looked up with signs of renewed life.  “I'll make it twenty,” continued the first speaker.  “I follow you,” assented the second speaker.  *Truly, if men must do so trivial a thing as squander their money on idle bets, here was a novel enough contest.  Each of the bettors sat in a chair, tucked up in white to the chin. Each was having his hair cut.  At the same moment a fly had lighted on each of the mirrors before the two customers.  The man who had offered the bet was a well known local character--Jim Duff by name, by occupation one of the meanest and most dishonorable gamblers who had ever disgraced Arizona by his presence.  There is an old tradition about “honest gamblers” and “players of square games.” The man who has been much about the world soon learns to understand that the really honest and “square” gambler is a creature of the imagination. The gambler makes his living by his wits, and he who lives by anything so intangible speedily finds the road to cheating and trickery.  Jim Duff had been no exception. His reputation was such that he could find few men among the residents of this part of Arizona who would meet him at the gaming table. He plied his trade mostly among simple-minded tourists from the east--the class of men who are known in Arizona as “tenderfeet.”  Rumor had it that Jim Duff, in addition to his many years of unblushing cheating for a living, had also shot and killed three men in the past on as many different occasions.  Yet he was a sleek, well-groomed fellow, tall and slim, and, in the matter of years, somewhere in his forties. Duff always dressed well--with a foundation of the late styles of the east, with something of the swagger of the plains added to his raiment.  “Stranger, you might as well hand me your money now,” drawled Duff, after a few moments had passed. “It'll save time.”  “Your fly hasn't hopped yet,” retorted the second man, with the air and tone of one who could afford to lose thousands on such stupid bets.  The second man was of the kind on which Jim Duff fattened his purse. Clarence Farnsworth, about twenty-five years of age, was as verdant a “tenderfoot” as had lately graced Paloma, Arizona, with his presence.  Even the name of Clarence had moved so many men to laughter in this sweltering little desert town that Farnsworth had lately chopped his name to “Clare.” Yet this latter had proved even worse; it sounded too nearly like a girl's name.  So far as his financial condition went, Clarence had the look of one who possessed money to spend. He was well-dressed, lived at the Mansion House, often hired automobiles, entertained his friends lavishly, and was voted a good enough fellow, though a simpleton.  “My fly's growing skittish, stranger,” smiled Jim Duff. “He's on the point of moving. You'd better whisper to your fly.”  “I believe, friend,” rejoined Clarence, “that my fly is taking nap. He appears to be sound asleep. You certainly picked the more healthy fly.”  Jim Duff gave his barber an all but imperceptible nudge in one elbow. Though he gave no sign in return, that barber understood, and shifted his shears in a way that, even at distance, alarmed the fly on the mirror before Duff.  “Buzz-zz!” The fly in front of the gambler took wing and vanished toward the rear of the store.  Some of the Arizona men looking on smiled knowingly. They had realized from the start that young Farnsworth had stood no show of winning the stupid wager.  “You win,” stated young Clarence, in a tone that betrayed no annoyance.  Drawing a roll of bills from his pocket, he fumbled until he found a twenty. This he passed to Duff, sitting in the next chair.  “You're not playing in luck to-day,” smiled Duff gently, as he tucked away the money in one of his coat pockets. “You're a good sportsman, Farnsworth, at any rate.”  “I flatter myself that I am,” replied Clarence, blushing slightly.  Jim Duff continued calmly puffing at the cigar that rested between his teeth. They were handsome teeth, though, in some way, they made one think of the teeth of a vicious dog.  “Coming over to the hotel this afternoon?” continued Duff.  “I--I--” hesitated Clarence.  “Coming, did you say?” persisted Duff gently.  “I shall have to see my mail first. There may be letters--”  “Oh,” nodded Duff, with just a trace of irony as the younger man again hesitated.  “Life is not all playtime for me, you know,” Farnsworth continued, looking rather shame-faced. “I--er--have some business affairs attention at times.”  “Oh, don't try to join me at the hotel this if you have more interesting matters in prospect,” smiled the gambler.  Again Clarence flushed. He looked up to Jim Duff as a thorough “man of the world,” and wanted to stand well in the gambler's good opinion. Clarence Farnsworth was, as yet, too green to know that, too often, the man who has seen much of the world has seen only its seamy and worthless side. Possibly Farnsworth was destined to learn this later on--after the gambler had coolly fleeced him.  “Before long,” Farnsworth went on, changing the subject, “I must get out on the desert and take a look at the quicksand that the railroad folks are trying to cross.”  “The railroad people will probably never cross that quicksand,” remarked Jim Duff, the lids closing over his eyes for a moment.  “Oh, I don't know about that,” continued Farnsworth argumentatively.  “I think I do,” declared Jim Duff easily. “My belief, Farnsworth, is that the railroad people might dig up the whole of New Mexico, transport the dirt here and dump it on top of that quicksand, and still the quicksand would settle lower and lower and the tracks would still break up and disappear. There's no bottom to that quicksand.”  “Of course you ought to know all about it, Duff,” Clarence made haste to answer. “You've lived here for years, and you know all about this section of the country.”  That didn't quite suit the gambler. What he sought to do was to raise an argument with the young man--who still had some money left.  “What makes you think, Farnsworth, that the railroad can win out with the desert and lay tracks across the quicksand? That's a bad quicksand, you know. It has been called the 'Man-killer.' Many a prospector or cow-puncher has lost his life in trying to get over that sand.”  “The real Man-killer quicksand is a mile to the south of where the tracks go, isn't it?” asked Farnsworth.  “Yes; and the first party of railway surveyors who went over the line for their track thought they had dodged the Man-killer. Yet what they'll find, in the end, is that the Man-killer is a bad affair, and that it extends, under the earth, in many directions and for long distances. I am certain that railway tracks will never be laid over any part of the Man-killer.”  “Perhaps not,” assented Clarence meekly.  “What makes you think that the railroad can ever get across the Man-killer?” persisted Duff.  “Why, for one thing, the very hopeful report of the new engineers who have taken charge.”  “Humph!” retorted Duff, as though that one word of contempt disposed of the matter.  “Reade and Hazelton are very good engineers, are they not?” inquired young Farnsworth.  “Humph! A pair of mere boys,” sneered Jim Duff.  “Young fellows of about my age, you mean?” asked Farnsworth.  “Of your age?” repeated Duff, in a tone of wonder. “No! You're a man. Reade and Hazelton, as I've told you, are mere boys. They're not of age. They've never voted.”  “Oh, I had no idea that they were as young as that,” replied Clarence, much pleased at hearing himself styled a man. “But these young engineers come from one of the Colorado, railroads, don't they!”  “I wouldn't be surprised,” nodded the gambler. “However, the Man-killer is no task for boys. It is a job for giants to put through, if the job ever can be finished.”  “Then, if it's so difficult, why doesn't the road shift the track by two or three miles?” inquired Clarence.  “You certainly are a newcomer here,” laughed Duff easily. “Why, my son, the railroad was chartered on condition that it run through certain towns. Paloma, here, is one of the towns. So the road has to come here.”  “But couldn't the road shift, just after it leaves here?” insisted Clarence.  “Oh, certainly. Yet, if the road shifted enough to avoid any possibility of resting on the big Man-killer, then it would have to go through the range beyond here--would have to tunnel under the hills for a distance of three miles. That would cost millions of dollars. No, sir; the railroad will have to lay tracks across the Man-killer, or else it will have to stand a loss so great as to cripple the road.”  “Excuse me, sir,” interrupted a keen, brisk, breezy-looking man, who had entered the shop only a moment or two before. “There's a way that the railroad can get over the Man-killer.”  “What is that?” asked Duff, eyeing the newcomer's reflected image in the mirror.  “The first thing to do,” replied the stranger, “is to drop these boy engineers out of the game. These youngsters came down here four days ago, looked over the scene, and promised that they could get the tracks laid-safely--for about two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.”  “Pooh!” jeered Duff, with a sidelong glance at young Farnsworth.  “Of course it is pooh!” laughed the stranger. “The thing can it be done for any such amount as that, and it is a crazy idea, to take the opinions of boys, anyway, on any such subject as that. Now, there's a Chicago firm of contractors, the Colthwaite Construction Company, which has proposed to take over the whole contract for laying tracks across the Man-killer. These boys figure on using dirt and then more dirt, and still more, until they've satisfied"]]]
