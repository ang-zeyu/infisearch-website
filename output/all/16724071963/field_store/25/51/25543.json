They might entail a sacrifice, and not a small one to a man of Graham's views and ambition.  But what is love if it can think any sacrifice, short of duty and honour, too great to offer up unknown uncomprehended, to the one beloved?  Still, while thus softened in his feelings towards Isaura, he became, perhaps in consequence of such softening, more and more restlessly impatient to fulfil the object for which he had come to Paris, the great step towards which was the discovery of the undiscoverable Louise Duval.  He had written more than once to M. Renard since the interview with that functionary already recorded, demanding whether Renard had not made some progress in the research on which he was employed, and had received short unsatisfactory replies preaching patience and implying hope.  The plain truth, however, was that M. Renard had taken no further pains in the matter.  He considered it utter waste of time and thought to attempt a discovery to which the traces were so faint and so obsolete. If the discovery were effected, it must be by one of those chances which occur without labour or forethought of our own.  He trusted only to such a chance in continuing the charge he had undertaken.  But during the last day or two Graham had become yet more impatient than before, and peremptorily requested another visit from this dilatory confidant.  In that visit, finding himself pressed hard, and though naturally willing, if possible, to retain a client unusually generous, yet being on the whole an honest member of his profession, and feeling it to be somewhat unfair to accept large remuneration for doing nothing, M. Renard said frankly, \"Monsieur, this affair is beyond me; the keenest agent of our police could make nothing of it.  Unless you can tell me more than you have done, I am utterly without a clew.  I resign, therefore, the task with which you honoured me, willing to resume it again if you can give me information that could render me of use.\"  \"What sort of information?\"  \"At least the names of some of the lady's relations who may yet be living.\"  \"But it strikes me that, if I could get at that piece of knowledge, I should not require the services of the police.  The relations would tell me what had become of Louise Duval quite as readily as they would tell a police agent.\"  \"Quite true, Monsieur.  It would really be picking your pockets if I did not at once retire from your service.  Nay, Monsieur, pardon me, no further payments; I have already accepted too much.  Your most obedient servant.\"  Graham, left alone, fell into a very gloomy revery.  He could not but be sensible of the difficulties in the way of the object which had brought him to Paris, with somewhat sanguine expectations of success founded on a belief in the omniscience of the Parisian police, which is only to be justified when they have to deal with a murderess or a political incendiary.  But the name of Louise Duval is about as common in France as that of Mary Smith in England; and the English reader may judge what would be the likely result of inquiring through the ablest of our detectives after some Mary Smith of whom you could give little more information than that she was the daughter of a drawing-master who had died twenty years ago, that it was about fifteen years since anything had been heard of her, that you could not say if through marriage or for other causes she had changed her name or not, and you had reasons for declining resort to public advertisements.  In the course of inquiry so instituted, the probability would be that you might hear of a great many Mary Smiths, in the pursuit of whom your employee would lose all sight and scent of the one Mary Smith for whom the chase was instituted.  In the midst of Graham's despairing reflections his laquais announced M. Frederic Lemercier.  \"_Cher_ Grarm-Varn.  A thousand pardons if I disturb you at this late hour of the evening; but you remember the request you made me when you first arrived in Paris this season?\"  \"Of course I do,--in case you should ever chance in your wide round of acquaintance to fall in with a Madame or Mademoiselle Duval of about the age of forty, or a year or so less, to let me know; and you did fall in with two ladies of that name, but they were not the right one, not the person whom my friend begged me to discover; both much too young.\"  \"_Eh bien, mon cher_.  If you will come with me to the _bal champetre_ in the Champs Elysees to-night, I can show you a third Madame Duval,--her Christian name is Louise, too, of the age you mention,--though she does her best to look younger, and is still very handsome.  You said your Duval was handsome.  It was only last evening that I met this lady at a _soiree_ given by Mademoiselle Julie Caumartin, _coryphee distinguee_, in love with young Rameau.\"  \"In love with young Rameau?  I am very glad to hear it.  He returns the love?\"  \"I suppose so.  He seems very proud of it.  But apropos of Madame Duval, she has been long absent from Paris, just returned, and looking out for conquests.  She says she has a great penchant for the English; promises me to be at this ball.  Come.\"  \"Hearty thanks, my dear Lemercier.  I am at your service.\"     CHAPTER IX.  The _bal champetre_ was gay and brilliant, as such festal scenes are at Paris.  A lovely night in the midst of May, lamps below and stars above; the society mixed, of course.  Evidently, when Graham has singled out Frederic Lemercier from all his acquaintances at Paris to conjoin with the official aid of M. Renard in search of the mysterious lady, he had conjectured the probability that she might be found in the Bohemian world so familiar to Frederic; if not as an inhabitant, at least as an explorer.  Bohemia was largely represented at the _bal champetre_, but not without a fair sprinkling of what we call the \"respectable classes,\" especially English and Americans, who brought their wives there to take care of them.  Frenchmen, not needing such care, prudently left their wives at home.  Among the Frenchmen of station were the Comte de Passy and the Vicomte de Breze.  On first entering the gardens, Graham's eye was attracted and dazzled by a brilliant form.  It was standing under a festoon of flowers extended from tree to tree, and a gas jet opposite shone full upon the face,--the face of a girl in all the freshness of youth.  If the freshness owed anything to art, the art was so well disguised that it seemed nature. The beauty of the countenance was Hebe-like, joyous, and radiant; and yet one could not look at the girl without a sentiment of deep mournfulness. She was surrounded by a group of young men, and the ring of her laugh jarred upon Graham's ear.  He pressed Frederic's arm, and directing his attention to the girl, asked who she was.  \"Who?  Don't you know?  That is Julie Caumartin.  A little while ago her equipage was the most admired in the Bois, and great ladies condescended to copy her dress or her coiffure; but she has lost her splendour, and dismissed the rich admirer who supplied the fuel for its blaze, since she fell in love with Gustave Rameau.  Doubtless she is expecting him to-night.  You ought to know her; shall I present you?\"  \"No,\" answered Graham, with a compassionate expression in his manly face. \"So young; seemingly so gay.  How I pity her!\"  \"What! for throwing herself away on Rameau?  True.  There is a great deal of good in that girl's nature, if she had been properly trained.  Rameau wrote a pretty poem on her which turned her head and won her heart, in which she is styled the 'Ondine of Paris,'--a nymph-like type of Paris itself.\"  \"Vanishing type, like her namesake; born of the spray, and vanishing soon into the deep,\" said Graham.  \"Pray go and look for the Duval; you will find me seated yonder.\"  Graham passed into a retired alley, and threw himself on a solitary bench, while Lemercier went in search of Madame Duval.  In a few minutes the Frenchman reappeared.  By his side was a lady well dressed, and as she passed under the lamps Graham perceived that, though of a certain age, she was undeniably handsome.  His heart beat more quickly.  Surely this was the Louise Duval he sought.  He rose from his seat, and was presented in due form to the lady, with whom Frederic then discreetly left him.  \"M. Lemercier tells me that you think that we were once acquainted with each other.\"  \"Nay, Madame; I should not fail to recognize you were that the case.  A friend of mine had the honour of knowing a lady of your name; and should I be fortunate enough to meet that lady, I am charged with a commission that may not be unwelcome to her.  M. Lemercier tells me your nom de bapteme is Louise.\"  \"Louise Corinne, Monsieur.\"  \"And I presume that Duval is the name you take from your parents?\"  \"No; my father's name was Bernard.  I married, when I was a mere child, M. Duval, in the wine trade at Bordeaux.\"  \"Ah, indeed!\" said Graham, much disappointed, but looking at her with a keen, searching eye, which she met with a decided frankness.  Evidently, in his judgment, she was speaking the truth.  \"You know English, I think, Madame,\" he resumed, addressing her in that language.  \"A leetle; speak un peu.\"  \"Only a little?\"  Madame Duval looked puzzled, and replied in French, with a laugh, \"Is it that you were told that I spoke English by your countryman, Milord Sare Boulby? _Petit scelerat_, I hope he is well.  He sends you a commission for me,--so he ought; he behaved to me like a monster.\"  \"Alas!  I know nothing of Milord Sir Boulby.  Were you never in England yourself?\"  \"Never,\" with a coquettish side-glance; \"I should like so much to go.  I have a foible for the English in spite of that _vilain petit Boulby_. Who is it gave you the commission for me?  Ha!  I guess, le Capitaine Nelton.\"  \"No.  What year, Madame, if not impertinent, were you at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7739"],["title","The Parisians â€” Volume 03 (#8)"],["body","-la- Chapelle?\"  \"You mean Baden?  I was there seven years ago, when I met le Capitaine Nelton, _bel homme aux cheveux rouges_.\"  \"But you have been at Aix?\"  \"Never.\"  \"I have, then, been mistaken, Madame, and have only to offer my most humble apologies.\"  \"But perhaps you will favour me with a visit, and we may on further conversation find that you are not mistaken.  I can't stay now, for I am engaged to dance with the Belgian of whom, no doubt, M. Lemercier has told you.\"  \"No, Madame, he has not.\"  \"Well, then, he will tell you.  The Belgian is very jealous; but I am always at home between three and four; this is my card.\"  Graham eagerly took the card, and exclaimed, \"Is this you're your own handwriting, Madame?\"  \"Yes, indeed.\"  \"_Tres belle ecriture_,\" said Graham, and receded with a ceremonious bow. \"Anything so unlike her handwriting!  Another disappointment,\" muttered the Englishman as the lady went back to the ball.  A few minutes later Graham joined Lemercier, who was talking with De Passy and De Breze.  \"Well,\" said Lemercier, when his eye rested on Graham, \"I hit the right nail on the head this time, eh?\"  Graham shook his head.  \"What! is she not the right Louise Duval?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  The Count de Passy overheard the name, and turned.  \"Louise Duval,\" he said; \"does Monsieur Vane know a Louise Duval?\"  \"No; but a friend asked me to inquire after a lady of that name whom he had met many years ago at Paris.\"  The Count mused a moment, and said, \"Is it possible that your friend knew the family De Mauleon?\"  \"I really can't say.  What then?\"  \"The old Vicomte de Mauleon was one of my most intimate associates.  In fact, our houses are connected.  And he was extremely grieved, poor man, when his daughter Louise married her drawing-master, Auguste Duval.\"  \"Her drawing-master, Auguste Duval?  Pray say on.  I think the Louise Duval my friend knew must have been her daughter.  She was the only child of a drawing-master or artist named Auguste Duval, and probably enough her Christian name would have been derived from her mother.  A Mademoiselle de Mauleon, then, married M. Auguste Duval?\"  \"Yes; the old Vicomte had espoused _en premieres noces_ Mademoiselle Camille de Chavigny, a lady of birth equal to his own; had by her one daughter, Louise.  I recollect her well,--a plain girl, with a high nose and a sour expression.  She was just of age when the first Vicomtesse died, and by the marriage settlement she succeeded at once to her mother's fortune, which was not large.  The Vicomte was, however, so poor that the loss of that income was no trifle to him.  Though much past fifty, he was still very handsome.  Men of that generation did not age soon, Monsieur,\" said the Count, expanding his fine chest and laughing exultingly.  \"He married, _en secondes noces_, a lady of still higher birth than the first, and with a much larger _dot_.  Louise was indignant at this, hated her stepmother; and when a son was born by the second marriage she left the paternal roof, went to reside with an old female relative near the Luxembourg, and there married this drawing-master.  Her father and the family did all they could to prevent it; but in these democratic days a woman who has attained her majority can, if she persist in her determination, marry to please herself and disgrace her ancestors.  After that _mesalliance_ her father never would see her again.  I tried in vain to soften him.  All his parental affections settled on his handsome Victor.  \"Ah!  you are too young to have known Victor de Mauleon during his short reign at Paris, as _roi des viveurs_.\"  \"Yes, he was before my time; but I have heard of him as a young man of great fashion; said to be very clever, a duellist, and a sort of Don Juan.\"  \"Exactly.\"  \"And then I remember vaguely to have heard that he committed, or was said to have committed, some villanous action connected with a great lady's jewels, and to have left Paris in consequence.\"  \"Ah, yes; a sad scrape.  At that time there was a political crisis; we were under a Republic; anything against a noble was believed.  But I am sure Victor de Mauleon was not the man to commit a larceny.  However, it is quite true that he left Paris, and I don't know what has become of him since.\"  Here he touched De Breze, who, though still near, had not been listening to this conversation, but interchanging jest and laughter with Lemercier on the motley scene of the dance.  \"De Breze, have you ever heard what became of poor dear Victor de Mauleon?--you knew him.\"  \"Knew him?  I should think so.  Who could be in the great world and not know _le beau_ Victor?  No; after he vanished I never heard more of him; doubtless long since dead.  A good-hearted fellow in spite of all his sins.\"  \"My dear Monsieur de Breze, did you know his half-sister?\" asked Graham, --\"a Madame Duval?\"  \"No.  I never heard he had a half-sister.  Halt there; I recollect that I met Victor once, in the garden at Versailles, walking arm-in-arm with the most beautiful girl I ever saw; and when I complimented him afterwards at the Jockey Club on his new conquest, he replied very gravely that the young lady was his niece.  'Niece!' said I; 'why, there can't be more than five or six years between you.'  'About that, I suppose,' said he; 'my half-sister, her mother, was more than twenty years older than I at the time of my birth.'  I doubted the truth of his story at the time; but since you say he really had a sister, my doubt wronged him.\"  \"Have you never seen that same young lady since?\"  \"Never.\"  \"How many years ago was this?\"  \"Let me see, about twenty or twenty-one years ago.  How time flies!\"  Graham still continued to question, but could learn no further particulars.  He turned to quit the gardens just as the band was striking up for a fresh dance, a wild German waltz air; and mingled with that German music his ear caught the sprightly sounds of the French laugh, one laugh distinguished from the rest by a more genuine ring of light-hearted joy, the laugh that he had heard on entering the gardens, and the sound of which had then saddened him.  Looking towards the quarter from which it came, he again saw the \"Ondine of Paris.\"  She was not now the centre of a group.  She had just found Gustave Rameau, and was clinging to his arm with a look of happiness in her face, frank and innocent as a child's; and so they passed amid the dancers down a solitary lamplit alley, till lost to the Englishman's lingering gaze.     CHAPTER X.  The next morning Graham sent again for M. Renard.  \"Well,\" he cried, when that dignitary appeared and took a seat beside him, \"chance has favoured me.\"  \"I always counted on chance, Monsieur.  Chance has more wit in its little finger than the Paris police in its whole body.\"  \"I have ascertained the relations, on the mother's side, of Louise Duval, and the only question is how to get at them.\"  Here Graham related what he had heard, and ended by saying, \"This Victor de Mauleon is therefore my Louise Duval's uncle.  He was, no doubt, taking charge of her in the year that the persons interested in her discovery lost sight of her in Paris; and surely he must know what became of her afterwards.\"  \"Very probably; and chance may befriend us yet in the discovery of Victor de Mauleon.  You seem not to know the particulars of that story about the jewels which brought him into some connection with the police, and resulted in his disappearance from Paris.\"  \"No; tell me the particulars.\"  \"Victor de Mauleon was heir to some 60,000 or 70,000 francs a year, chiefly on the mother's side; for his father, though the representative of one of the most ancient houses in Normandy, was very poor, having little of his own except the emoluments of an appointment in the Court of Louis Philippe.  \"But before, by the death of his parents, Victor came into that inheritance, he very largely forestalled it.  His tastes were magnificent.  He took to 'sport,' kept a famous stud, was a great favourite with the English, and spoke their language fluently.  Indeed he was considered very accomplished, and of considerable intellectual powers.  It was generally said that some day or other, when he had sown his wild oats, he would, if he took to politics, be an eminent man. Altogether he was a very strong creature.  That was a very strong age under Louis Philippe.  The _viveurs_ of Paris were fine types for the heroes of Dumas and Sue,--full of animal life and spirits.  Victor de Mauleon was a romance of Dumas, incarnated.\"  \"Monsieur Renard, forgive me that I did not before do justice to your taste in polite literature.\"  \"Monsieur, a man in my profession does not attain even to my humble eminence if he be not something else than a professional.  He must study mankind wherever they are described, even in _les romans_.  To return to Victor de Mauleon.  Though he was a 'sportman,' a gambler, a Don Juan, a duel list, nothing was ever said against his honour.  On the contrary, on matters of honour he was a received oracle; and even though he had fought several duels (that was the age of duels), and was reported without a superior, almost without an equal, in either weapon, the sword or the pistol, he is said never to have wantonly provoked an encounter, and to have so used his skill that he contrived never to slay, nor even gravely to wound, an antagonist.  \"I remember one instance of his generosity in this respect; for it was much talked of at the time.  One of your countrymen, who had never handled a fencing-foil nor fired a pistol, took offence at something M. de Mauleon had said in disparagement of the Duke of Wellington, and called him out.  Victor de Mauleon accepted the challenge, discharged his pistol, not in the air--that might have been an affront--but so as to be wide of the mark, walked up to the lines to be shot at, and when missed, said, 'Excuse the susceptibility of a Frenchman loath to believe that his countryman can be beaten save by accident, and"]]]
