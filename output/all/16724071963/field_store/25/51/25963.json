Everybody was out       of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the       shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank account had caused me to       postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country       nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved       to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his       filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to       every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation       of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only       change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town       to track down his brother of the country.        Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had       tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I       fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion’s voice broke in       upon my thoughts:        “You are right, Watson,” said he. “It does seem a most       preposterous way of settling a dispute.”        “Most preposterous!” I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how       he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair       and stared at him in blank amazement.        “What is this, Holmes?” I cried. “This is beyond anything which I       could have imagined.”        He laughed heartily at my perplexity.        “You remember,” he said, “that some little time ago when I read       you the passage in one of Poe’s sketches in which a close       reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were       inclined to treat the matter as a mere _tour-de-force_ of the       author. On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of       doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.”        “Oh, no!”        “Perhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with       your eyebrows. So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter       upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity       of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof       that I had been in rapport with you.”        But I was still far from satisfied. “In the example which you       read to me,” said I, “the reasoner drew his conclusions from the       actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he       stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so       on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues       can I have given you?”        “You do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as       the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are       faithful servants.”        “Do you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my       features?”        “Your features and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot       yourself recall how your reverie commenced?”        “No, I cannot.”        “Then I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was       the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a       minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves       upon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by       the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been       started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes flashed across       to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon       the top of your books. Then you glanced up at the wall, and of       course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the       portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and       correspond with Gordon’s picture over there.”        “You have followed me wonderfully!” I exclaimed.        “So far I could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts       went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were       studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to       pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was       thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher’s career.       I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of       the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time       of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your passionate       indignation at the way in which he was received by the more       turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I       knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that       also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the       picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil       War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled,       and your hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed       thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that       desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you       shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror       and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old       wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the       ridiculous side of this method of settling international       questions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I       agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find       that all my deductions had been correct.”        “Absolutely!” said I. “And now that you have explained it, I       confess that I am as amazed as before.”        “It was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. I should       not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some       incredulity the other day. But I have in my hands here a little       problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my       small essay in thought reading. Have you observed in the paper a       short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet       sent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?”        “No, I saw nothing.”        “Ah! then you must have overlooked it. Just toss it over to me.       Here it is, under the financial column. Perhaps you would be good       enough to read it aloud.”        I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the       paragraph indicated. It was headed, “A Gruesome Packet.”        “Miss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been       made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly       revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should       prove to be attached to the incident. At two o’clock yesterday       afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in       by the postman. A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with       coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find       two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. The box had       been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before.       There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the       more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty,       has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or       correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive       anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she       resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young       medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account       of their noisy and irregular habits. The police are of opinion       that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by       these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her       by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some       probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these       students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss       Cushing’s belief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the matter is       being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very       smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.”        “So much for the _Daily Chronicle_,” said Holmes as I finished       reading. “Now for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this       morning, in which he says: ‘I think that this case is very much       in your line. We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but       we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. We       have, of course, wired to the Belfast post-office, but a large       number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no       means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the       sender. The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does       not help us in any way. The medical student theory still appears       to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours       to spare I should be very happy to see you out here. I shall be       either at the house or in the police-station all day.’ What say       you, Watson? Can you rise superior to the heat and run down to       Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?”        “I was longing for something to do.”        “You shall have it then. Ring for our boots and tell them to       order a cab. I’ll be back in a moment when I have changed my       dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.”        A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat       was far less oppressive in Croydon than in town. Holmes had sent       on a wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as       ferret-like as ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of       five minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.        It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and       prim, with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned       women gossiping at the doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and       tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. Miss       Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/834"],["title","The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (#7)"],["body","ushered. She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes,       and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. A       worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured       silks stood upon a stool beside her.        “They are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,” said she as       Lestrade entered. “I wish that you would take them away       altogether.”        “So I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them here until my friend,       Mr. Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.”        “Why in my presence, sir?”        “In case he wished to ask any questions.”        “What is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know       nothing whatever about it?”        “Quite so, madam,” said Holmes in his soothing way. “I have no       doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over       this business.”        “Indeed, I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life.       It is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to       find the police in my house. I won’t have those things in here,       Mr. Lestrade. If you wish to see them you must go to the       outhouse.”        It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the       house. Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box,       with a piece of brown paper and some string. There was a bench at       the end of the path, and we all sat down while Holmes examined,       one by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him.        “The string is exceedingly interesting,” he remarked, holding it       up to the light and sniffing at it. “What do you make of this       string, Lestrade?”        “It has been tarred.”        “Precisely. It is a piece of tarred twine. You have also, no       doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a       scissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side. This is       of importance.”        “I cannot see the importance,” said Lestrade.        “The importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact,       and that this knot is of a peculiar character.”        “It is very neatly tied. I had already made a note to that       effect,” said Lestrade complacently.        “So much for the string, then,” said Holmes, smiling, “now for       the box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee.       What, did you not observe it? I think there can be no doubt of       it. Address printed in rather straggling characters: ‘Miss S.       Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.’ Done with a broad-pointed pen,       probably a J, and with very inferior ink. The word ‘Croydon’ has       been originally spelled with an ‘i,’ which has been changed to       ‘y.’ The parcel was directed, then, by a man—the printing is       distinctly masculine—of limited education and unacquainted with       the town of Croydon. So far, so good! The box is a yellow       half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb       marks at the left bottom corner. It is filled with rough salt of       the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser       commercial purposes. And embedded in it are these very singular       enclosures.”        He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across       his knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending       forward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these       dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our       companion. Finally he returned them to the box once more and sat       for a while in deep meditation.        “You have observed, of course,” said he at last, “that the ears       are not a pair.”        “Yes, I have noticed that. But if this were the practical joke of       some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for       them to send two odd ears as a pair.”        “Precisely. But this is not a practical joke.”        “You are sure of it?”        “The presumption is strongly against it. Bodies in the       dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid. These ears       bear no signs of this. They are fresh, too. They have been cut       off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a       student had done it. Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would       be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the       medical mind, certainly not rough salt. I repeat that there is no       practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious       crime.”        A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion’s       words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features.       This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and       inexplicable horror in the background. Lestrade, however, shook       his head like a man who is only half convinced.        “There are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,” said he,       “but there are much stronger reasons against the other. We know       that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at       Penge and here for the last twenty years. She has hardly been       away from her home for a day during that time. Why on earth,       then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt,       especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she       understands quite as little of the matter as we do?”        “That is the problem which we have to solve,” Holmes answered,       “and for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my       reasoning is correct, and that a double murder has been       committed. One of these ears is a woman’s, small, finely formed,       and pierced for an earring. The other is a man’s, sun-burned,       discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. These two people       are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before       now. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on Thursday morning.       The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday or earlier.       If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would       have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing? We may take it       that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he       must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this       packet. What reason then? It must have been to tell her that the       deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps. But in that case she       knows who it is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew, why       should she call the police in? She might have buried the ears,       and no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have       done if she had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does       not wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle       here which needs straightening out.” He had been talking in a       high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but       now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.        “I have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,” said he.        “In that case I may leave you here,” said Lestrade, “for I have       another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing       further to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the       police-station.”        “We shall look in on our way to the train,” answered Holmes. A       moment later he and I were back in the front room, where the       impassive lady was still quietly working away at her       antimacassar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked       at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.        “I am convinced, sir,” she said, “that this matter is a mistake,       and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. I have said       this several times to the gentleman from Scotland Yard, but he       simply laughs at me. I have not an enemy in the world, as far as       I know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?”        “I am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,” said       Holmes, taking a seat beside her. “I think that it is more than       probable——” he paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to       see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady’s       profile. Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be       read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find       out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. I       stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her       little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see       nothing which could account for my companion’s evident       excitement.        “There were one or two questions——”        “Oh, I am weary of questions!” cried Miss Cushing impatiently.        “You have two sisters, I believe.”        “How could you know that?”        “I observed the very instant that I entered the room that you       have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one       of whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so       exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the       relationship.”        “Yes, you are quite right. Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.”        “And here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at Liverpool, of       your younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a       steward by his uniform. I observe that she was unmarried at the       time.”        “You are very quick at observing.”        “That is my trade.”        “Well, you are quite right. But she was married to Mr. Browner a       few days afterwards. He was on the South American line when that       was taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn’t abide to       leave her for so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London       boats.”        “Ah, the _Conqueror_, perhaps?”        “No, the _May Day_, when last I heard. Jim came down here to see       me once. That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he       would always take drink when he was ashore, and a"]]]
