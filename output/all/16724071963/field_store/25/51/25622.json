This liquid drips through into troughs from which it is carried to evaporators where the water portion of the sap is eliminated and the juice left; you would be surprised if you were to see this liquid. It looks like nothing so much as the soapy, bluish-gray dish-water that is left in the pan after the dishes have been washed.\"  \"A tempting picture!\" Van exclaimed.  \"I know it. Sugar isn't very attractive during its process of preparation,\" agreed Mr. Hennessey. \"The sweet liquid left after the water has been extracted is then poured into vacuum pans to be boiled until the crystals form in it, after which it is put into whirling machines, called centrifugal machines, that separate the dry sugar from the syrup with which it is mixed. This syrup is later boiled into molasses. The sugar is then dried and packed in these burlap sacks such as you see here, or in hogsheads, and shipped to refineries to be cleansed and whitened.\"  \"Isn't any of the sugar refined in the places where it grows?\" queried Bob.  \"Practically none. Large refining plants are too expensive to be erected everywhere; it therefore seems better that they should be built in our large cities, where the shipping facilities are good not only for receiving sugar in its raw state but for distributing it after it has been refined and is ready for sale. Here, too, machinery can more easily be bought and the business handled with less difficulty.\"  \"You spoke of a central sugar mill,\" began Bob.  \"Yes. Each plantation does not have a mill of its own or, indeed, need one. Frequently a planter will raise too small a crop to pay him to operate a mill; so a mill is constructed in the center of a sugar district, and to this growers may carry their wares and be paid in bulk. It saves much trouble and expense. It also encourages small growers who could not afford to build mills and might in consequence abandon sugar raising. The leaves are all stripped off before the cane is shipped so that nothing but the stalks are sent. As the largest portion of sugar is in the part of the cane nearest the ground it is cut as close to the root as possible. After the juice has been crushed from the stalks by putting them several times through the rollers the cane, or _begass_, as it is called, is so dry that it can be used as fuel for running the mill machinery.\"  \"How clever!\"  \"Clever and economical as well,\" agreed Mr. Hennessey. \"Moreover, it does away with a waste product that otherwise would accumulate.\"  Bob nodded.  \"Raw sugar has usually been shipped to the northern refineries by water, as that mode of transportation is cheaper; but during the Great War ships have been so scarce that in 1916 a large consignment of Hawaiian sugar was for the first time sent overland across the American continent by train; this of course made the freight rates higher, and if such a condition were to continue the price of sugar would of necessity have to be advanced.\"  \"I never thought of such things affecting us,\" murmured Van.  \"We live in a network of interdependence,\" Mr. Hennessey replied. \"Scarcely anything can be done in any land that does not affect us. Commercial conditions react upon us all, for there is not one of us who is not indebted to the four corners of the globe for what he eats, wears, and uses. Therefore, you see, world prosperity and comfort can be at their height only when there is world peace under which all nations are friends, maintaining cordial trade relation with one another.\"  \"What political party do you belong to, Mr. Hennessey?\" asked Bob, glancing into the superintendent's earnest face.  \"I do not know just what label you would put on me,\" the big man replied evasively. \"But this I do know: first, last, and all the time I am for a universe where each country shall work for the good of the whole.\"  He spoke slowly and with impressiveness; then breaking off abruptly he led the way up a winding iron staircase and the boys, still pondering his words, followed him silently and thoughtfully.     CHAPTER V  VAN SPRINGS A SURPRISE   The room into which they emerged was at the top of the factory, and it was here in great vats that the dry sugar was melted.  \"We often melt down as many as two million pounds of raw sugar a day,\" said Mr. Hennessey. \"The United States, you know, is the greatest sugar consuming nation in the world. No other country devours so much of it. One reason is because here even the poorer classes have money enough so they can afford sugar for household use; in many countries this is not the case. Only the well-to-do take sugar in tea or coffee and have it for common use. Our Americans also eat quantities of candy. At the present time children eat three times as many sweets as did their parents, and the amount is constantly increasing. Doctors tell us sugar is one of the fuels necessary to the human system; it generates both heat and energy. Possibly it is because our people work so hard and are driven at such high nervous tension that they demand so much of this sort of food.\"  \"I never knew before that candy was good for us,\" ejaculated Bob in surprise.  \"Oh, bless you, yes! But you must take it in moderation if you wish to benefit from it and escape illness. Used intelligently sugar is an excellent food, but of course you must prescribe it for yourself in the proper proportions,\" laughed Mr. Hennessey. \"We all constantly take more or less sugar into our systems through the ordinary foods we eat. But here in America over and above this each individual annually averages about eighty pounds of sugar. You will agree that that is a good deal.\"  \"I should think so! Why, that is a tremendous amount!\" Van declared.  \"It seems so when you see it in figures, doesn't it?\" returned the superintendent. \"Next to the United States in sugar consumption comes England, the reason for this being that the English manufacture such vast amounts of jam for the market. England is a great fruit growing country, you must remember. The damp, moderate climate results in wonderful strawberries, gooseberries, plums, and other small fruits. With these products cheap, fine, and plenty, the English have taken up fruit canning as one of their industries, and they turn out some of the best jams and marmalades that are made.\"  The boys listened intently.  \"The Germans and the French are much more frugal than we Americans,\" went on Mr. Hennessey. \"Sugar is not so common in their countries. Often when in Germany you will notice people in the restaurants and cafå»¥ who carry away in their pockets the loaf sugar which has been allotted them and which they have not had occasion to use. It is a common occurrence, and considered quite proper, although it looks strange to us. Doubtless, too, if you have traveled abroad you have discovered how few candy shops there are. Foreigners regard the wholesale fashion in which we devour sweets with wonder and often with disgust. They consider it a form of self-indulgence, and indeed I myself think we are at times a bit immoderate.\"  \"My father says we are an immoderate people,\" Van put in.  \"I am afraid he is right,\" nodded Mr. Hennessey. \"We seem to proceed on the principle that if a thing is good we must have a great deal of it. However, the vice--if vice it be--is good for the sugar business.\"  He paused a moment and stood looking down into the great foaming vats before him.  \"You can't see the steam coils that are melting this raw sugar,\" he remarked. \"They go round the inside of the tanks. But after the liquid is drawn off you can see them. When first melted the sugar is far from pure; you would be astonished at the amount of dirt mixed with it. Many of these impurities boil up to the surface and over and over again we skim them off. But even after that we have to wash the sugar by various processes. After it has been separated, clarified, and filtered it comes out a clear white liquid, and is ready for the vacuum pans, where the water is evaporated and the sugar crystallized.\"  \"How do you get the liquid clear?\" asked Bob.  \"After it has been skimmed as carefully as possible we first settle it through the agency of chemicals,\" answered Mr. Hennessey. \"We use milk of lime as a foundation, but we put other things with it. Our exact formula is a secret, but since you are in the family I guess there would be no objection to my telling you that we use---\"  \"Don't tell us! Don't tell us!\" cried Van suddenly. \"I don't want to know. I'd rather not. I mustn't listen.\"  Covering his ears the boy turned away.  His companions regarded him with amazement.  \"Don't tell me, Mr. Hennessey,\" he pleaded. \"Don't tell me anything that is secret. I can't listen. It wouldn't be right.\"  It was evident both to the superintendent and to Bob that his distress was real, and although neither of them understood it Mr. Hennessey cut short his explanation.  Try as they would the strange interruption left a jarring note behind it, and to ease the tenseness the older man stepped forward and, taking from a rack near by one of several glass tubes filled with yellow liquid, held it up to the light.  \"You see much must still be done to this stuff before it comes out white,\" he said. \"We squeeze the liquid through a series of filter bags and also send it through other filters filled with black bone coal.\"  \"What is black bone coal?\" Bob demanded.  \"Bone coal is a product made by burning and pulverizing the large bones left at the abbatoirs until a coarse-grained black powder not unlike emery sand is made; if this is not allowed to become too fine with using it is an excellent sugar filter. In fact, strangely enough, nothing has ever been found to take its place, and it has become a necessary but expensive agency employed in every sugar refinery. Quantities of it are used; in our refinery alone we have about a hundred bone coal filters and each one holds thirty tons of black bone coal. That will give you some idea how much of it is needed. We get nothing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7803"],["title","The Story of Sugar (#7)"],["body","on it, either, for in the process of using it becomes finer, and after that it is good for nothing unless, perhaps, to be made into cheap shoe-dressing. Unlike many of the other industries sugar refining has no by-products; by that I mean nothing on which the manufacturer may recover money. On the contrary in the leather business, for example, almost every scrap of material can either be utilized or sold for cash; odds and ends of the hides go into glue stock, small bits of leather are made into heel-taps or hardware fittings. But in refining cane-sugar there is nothing to be turned back into money to reimburse the manufacturer for his outlay. What isn't sugar is dead loss.\"  The three now moved on and saw how the heated juice traveled by means of pipes from one vat to another, and how it constantly became thicker and clearer.  \"One of the greatest dangers to successful sugar making is fermentation,\" observed Mr. Hennessey. \"Sugar must continually be stirred by revolving paddles to keep it from fermenting; we also are obliged to take the greatest care that our vats and all other receptacles are clean, and that the plant is immaculate. Frequently we wash down all the walls with a solution of lime in order that the entire interior of the refinery may be quite fresh.\"  \"I didn't dream it was so much work to make white sugar,\" ventured Bob, a little awed. \"Our maple-sugar making was much simpler.\"  \"I'll venture to say it was,\" agreed Mr. Hennessey. \"In the first place, you did not make such a quantity of it; then you did not try to get it white. Furthermore, you were content to take it in cakes. Making cane-sugar is, however, easy enough if one is careful and knows the exact way to do it. There is plenty of opportunity to spoil it--I'll admit that; but it is seldom that a batch of our sugar goes back on us. We have fine chemists who watch every step of the process and who constantly test samples of the liquid at every stage into which it passes until it comes out water-white.\"  \"And then?\"  \"Then follows crystallization, and this too requires skilled workmen and extreme care. The water is evaporated and the sugar crystallized in the vacuum pans, the size crystal depending upon the temperature at which the liquid is boiled. It takes a lower temperature to form a small crystal and a higher one to form a large crystal. An expert who takes the temperature of the boiling sugar regulates what we call fine-grain or coarse-grain sugar by regulating the size of the crystals. By drawing off some of the liquid and examining it on a glass slide by electric light he can tell the precise moment at which the crystals are the right size. Each size has a name by which it is known in the trade: Diamond A; Fine Granulated; Coarse Granulated; Crystal Domino; Confectioners' A and so on.\"  They were walking as Mr. Hennessey talked. \"After the sugar has been crystallized in the pans it passes into a mixer, where it is stirred and kept from caking until it is put into the centrifugal machines, which actually spin off the crystals. These machines are lined with gauze, and as they whirl at tremendous velocity they force out through this gauze the liquid part of the sugar and leave the sugar crystals inside the machine. When these are quite dry the bottom of the receptacle opens, and the granular sugar is dropped through into a large bin.\"  \"But I should think it would stick together,\" objected Van.  \"That's an intelligent objection, my boy,\" declared Mr. Hennessey, much pleased at Van's grasp of the subject. \"It would stick if it were not dried off by a degree of heat just right to keep the particles separate and not allow them to cake. After this any dust or dirt adhering to the sugar is blown off by an air blast. The product is then ready to be pressed into moulds or cut; boxed in small packages of varying weights; or put into bags or barrels.\"  Mr. Hennessey led the way to another floor of the refinery.  [Illustration: \"I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD STICK TOGETHER.\"]  Here were automatic machines upon which empty boxes traveled along until they reached a device that filled each one with the exact number of pounds to be contained in it, the package afterward passed to women who sealed it tightly and gave it the final touch before it was shipped. Other women were packing loaf or domino sugar, while down-stairs in a cooper shop men moved about constructing with great rapidity the barrels that were to carry larger quantities of sugar to the wholesale and retail stores.  \"I guess by this time you've had all the sugar-making you want for one day,\" declared the superintendent. \"I'm afraid I've given you quite a stiff lesson. You see I am so interested in it myself that I forget to have mercy on my listeners.\"  He smiled down at the boys.  \"I'm sure we have had a fine morning with you, Mr. Hennessey, and we certainly have learned a lot,\" Bob said, putting out his hand. \"I can't swear, though, that we could make white sugar even now.\"  \"Faith, I'd be sorry if I thought I could teach any one the whole process in three hours. It would make my twenty years of study and hard work brand me as pretty stupid,\" chuckled the big superintendent.     CHAPTER VI  A FAMILY TANGLE   It was not until the boys were in the motor-car and returning home that Bob ventured to mention to Van his strange behavior of the morning.  \"What on earth was the matter with you, Van?\" he asked.  Van stirred uneasily.  \"Bobbie,\" he said, \"I'm going to tell you something. I've been wondering whether I'd better or not, and at last I've decided to. I didn't want to go to your father's refinery to-day or, in fact, at all. You've all been very kind to me, although it was not until I got a letter from my father this morning that I realized how kind.\"  He paused.  \"Has your dad told you anything about my people?\" he asked abruptly. \"Of course he knows, but he may have thought best to keep it to himself; at any rate it has not prevented him from giving me as cordial a welcome to your home as he would if--\"  \"If what?\"  \"Well, if I weren't the person I am.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"Why, he's trusted me and treated me as if he really liked me; and yet under the circumstances you can't expect him actually to mean it.\"  \"Mean what? What are you talking about?\"  \"Hasn't he spoken to you about my father?\"  \"Of course not; why should he?\"  \"Then you haven't heard anything?\"  \"Not a word. I don't understand what you are driving at at all,\" Bob declared, somewhat irritated. \"Out with it. What's the matter?\"  Van hesitated as if uncertain how to begin.  \"That's mighty white of your father,\" he murmured, breaking the pause. \"You see, it is this way. When I wrote home that I was going to New Hampshire to visit my roommate the family wrote me to go ahead. I recall now that I didn't mention your last name; in fact I guess I haven't in any of my letters. When I did happen to write (which wasn't often) I've always spoken of you as _Bob_. So when I got to Allenville I dropped a line to Father to say I'd arrived safely and in the note I put something about Mr. Carlton. Father lit on it right away; he wished to know who these Carltons were. I replied they were Mr. and Mrs. Carlton, of course--the parents of my roommate. Upon that I got another letter from home in which Father inquired if your father was in the sugar business, and said that years ago he used to have a partner named James Carlton, who started in the sugar trade with him and with whom he later quarreled. He supposed this could not be the same person, but he just wondered if by any chance it was.\"  Van stopped.  \"Was that all he said?\"  \"No, but I don't like to tell you the rest, Bobbie.\"  \"Fire away--unless it is something about Dad,\" Bob replied. \"If it is I shan't listen, or at least I shan't believe it.\"  \"It isn't exactly against your father. I do not understand it very well myself. My father just said that if your father was Mr. James Carlton and he was in the sugar business he felt that because of family misunderstandings it would be better if I did not visit here again. He was very sorry I had done it this time, but of course that could not be helped now.\"  \"You don't mean to say he wants you to break off your friendship with me?\" Bob gasped tremulously.  \"No, he didn't seem to be opposed to you; he just was hot at your dad. He added that he didn't believe your family could have known who I was when they asked me here, and I am afraid that's true, Bobbie.\"  \"Why, of course they knew! Haven't I spoken of you over and over again?\" Bob protested indignantly.  Van shook his head.  \"They knew I was your chum all right, Bob; but so far as details were concerned your family did not know much more about me than mine knew about you. Don't you recall how, when I arrived at Allenville, your father asked if I was one of the _Sugar Blakes_--Asa Blake's son?\"  \"Yes, I do remember that now, but--\"  \"That, you will recollect, was after I was landed at Allenville and your guest. Your father didn't know until that moment who I was, and when he found out he was too decent to say anything, or make it evident he didn't want me in the house. What could he do?\"  \"But--but--\"  Bob broke off from sheer inability to continue. He was much too bewildered.  \"Your father sensed the awkwardness of the situation at once. Here you had gone to school and as ill luck would have it you had picked from out the entire bunch of boys the son of his worst enemy for a chum. Neither your father nor mine realized the truth until you innocently carted me home with you for a holiday visit. When your father found out the fact he was too polite to turn me out-of-doors; he just acted the gentleman and made the best of a bad dilemma,\" explained Van with appalling convincingness. \"He even had the goodness to save my life the day we got lost on one of your New Hampshire mountains. He didn't tell you any of this because he didn't want to spoil your pleasure; but I am certain that if he"]]]
