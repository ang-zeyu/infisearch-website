But he had not been long enough in Germany to be advised that knowledge is not expected there to enter into the inner life. What one is has little in common with what one knows or can dexterously do. Study does not pass into character. The German, with all his acquirements, does not look for moral or esthetic effect upon the heart or soul.  German women esteem the strong fighter, the rugged accomplisher the boisterous enthusiast, among their men. Whether these are atheistic, immoral, boorish, cruel, are considerations of secondary importance. The daughters marry them with little hesitation. Men are men, supreme, to be adored. Women are to be tolerated, stepped on, sat upon. Man is the master, woman is the willing servant.     CHAPTER IX  A JOURNALIST   Gard's experience in perfecting himself in German met with another rebuff. Under the prompting of his parental friends in Villa Elsa he concluded at length to attend a course of lectures given by a celebrated professor who was, however, known to be of an exceptionally cantankerous disposition. Kirtley had become aware of the querulous restrictions and exactions attending the most peaceful German activities and made sure of his ground at the class room, whither he went one morning with encouraging expectations. He asked the janitor if the hearings were free and public. They were.  It was the usual amphitheater and Gard entered to find only a few regular students down in the front rows. He decided on a seat alone in the center. Herr Professor, be-spectacled, soon clambered up on the rostrum and squatted dumpily. Blear-eyed he scanned the place and blurted out:  \"There is a stranger in the room. The lecture will not proceed until he departs.\" Gard, having been assured by the janitor, could not imagine that he himself was meant. The man of prodigious learning shouted angrily, throwing out his arm toward Kirtley:  \"Must I repeat that there is a foreigner in the audience? I shall not begin until his presence has been removed.\"  Gard went away, incensed. Surely, he swore to himself, Teuton erudition acts so often like a mad bear ready to claw away at men and things. He never attended another day lecture.  But he had to get on with his German. He decided to put an advertisement for an instructor in the Dresden _Nachrichten_. At its _bureau_ he ran counter to a lot of ifs and ands at the hands of a surly young clerk. A German, naturally gruff, only needs a small position to increase his acerbity. His newspapers display, likewise, a disagreeable officiousness, being nearly always, to some extent, bureaucratic organs. They are lords, not servants, of the public. They do not appear to want your business, your money.  Gard's imperfect German balked him, too. After he had been back and forth to the little window three or four times, trying to alter his \"ad\" to suit the rasping individual whose face Gard could scarcely catch a glimpse of by stooping down to the aperture, an American stepped forward. He was a steel gray man of about sixty and was inserting a notice. He said he was familiar with all the rigors of such a proceeding, being a correspondent for the Chicago _Gazette_.  \"Perhaps I can help,\" volunteered Miles Anderson. \"After having had scraps and fights about this sort of thing around this country for seven years--though the Germans won't fight--I've finally got the hang of it. You can save three or four words by a different jargon. I can see you are an American because you take up more room about this than necessary. German economy, you must remember.\"  Gard was glad to find a friend of his race. And after the advertisement was disposed of, they repaired to a neighboring beer hall to refresh and relieve their feelings. Anderson was smooth-shaven, with piercing gray eyes under bushy eyebrows, his head presenting the appearance of just having been in a barber's chair. With the insistent curiosity of a practiced interviewer he wanted to know why Kirtley had come to this godless land; where he was hanging out; and all about the Buchers.  A bachelor, Anderson had become toughened by hotel and _pension_. He thought Kirtley very fortunate in getting right into a family where the veritable German bloom had not been rubbed off by foreigners, by boarders. It would be a most fragrant experience. Here Kirtley would see on the native heath the genuine German of the great middle class that makes up the might of the nation.  \"Can you read German comfortably?\" asked Anderson. \"What do you make of it? I've been studying it for seven years and sometimes it seems as if I hadn't got much further than the verb to hate.\"  \"You can't give me any short cuts about it, then?\" laughed Gard.  \"Yes, I can--yes, I can. Here's a little compilation and analysis of the irregular verbs,\" explained his new acquaintance, pulling a green brochure from his pocket. \"Only costs a mark. You can get a second-hand one at the book stalls by the Augustus bridge. I always carry it with me and con it over and over. Good for the pronunciation. If you get the irregular verbs of a language well fed into your system, you've got the language by the windpipe.  \"Then buy _Simplicissimus_. You'll pick up a good deal from that--the popular expressions, the phrases and exclamations that are going. If you learn to use the exclamations, it makes you interesting and well-liked. It gives the other fellow the chance to do the talking. _Simplicissimus_ and that kind of thing are better than the dry, stilted German classics--'Ekkehard,' 'Nathan der Weise' and all that discarded stuff. But remember that _esprit_ was not given the Germans, because it would hide their Boeotian stupidity.\"  \"I haven't yet seen--I suppose I shall see\"--said Kirtley, \"why the general American student like me is so persistently encouraged to come to Germany. Why is it?\"  \"Because we are damn fools,\" heartily rejoined Anderson. \"The Germans don't have education. They have instruction. The one makes gentlemen. The other makes experts. It is hard for an expert to be a gentleman. They don't have gentlemen in Germany. No such word in their language. It is a nation of experts, but that's precisely the reason it should be feared. Why, education would teach a German not to slobber at his meals.  \"It is his strenuous ingrowing instruction that cultivates his extreme national egotism until it has become like a boil. His racial egoism helps obscure the obscure sunlight here in Germany and blinds him. He has to wear spectacles. It is a natural cry, his cry for a place in the sun.\"  \"Should I have gone to England or France?\" suggested Gard.  \"Yes. At any rate, not here. The German procedure roughens the fiber and lowers the moral standards of the general student. Instruction here is along mental and manual lines. The Teuton is meant to be a specialist. He is competent but not refined.\"  The two compatriots gossiped along about this and that.  \"I'm having a devil of a time sleeping on my bed,\" confessed Gard. \"You ought to know about German beds. How do you get on with them?\"  \"The German bed helps to give the German his bad disposition. I put two beds side by side and sleep across the middle. That's one way to fool the German bed. If I saw yours I might be able to suggest something.\"  Anderson frankly expressed a desire to visit the Loschwitz home. So on Gard's invitation they had lunch and went out to his suburb.     CHAPTER X  SPIES AND WAR   They took off the bed clothes, including the two huge feather bolsters in the center.  \"These bolsters are for the gingerbread effect that the German likes everywhere,\" explained the visitor. They examined the remaining construction. It was narrow and short. It suggested a granite-like base.  \"Rock of Ages!\" commented Anderson. \"As you can't ask for an additional bed, all I can see is for you to swill beer and then you don't care where you sleep. That's the way the Germans do.\"  The journalist appeared disappointed in not meeting any of the family that first day. Frau was overwhelmed in kitchen duties and not presentable. The other members were away, working, working. Anderson had to be contented with Gard's description of them, after the latter had passed the cigars.  \"Who's the spy in your family?\" abruptly asked the elder.  \"The spy?\"  \"Yes, the spy. Every well-regulated German family should have a spy in it.\"  \"What for?\" queried Kirtley in surprise.  \"Why, for the Kaiser, of course. Who else? The Teutons call him euphemistically the Government. But without Wilhelm there wouldn't be any German Government.\"  \"Why should he want spies in his own German families?\" interrogated Gard innocently.  \"Didn't every medieval feudal lord keep close tab on his subjects--the people he owned? The Kaiser wants to know of any signs of disloyalty. If a household harbors any foreigners, as your family is doing, he wants to know what they are up to.\"  \"Do you mean to say that the Government knows about me--that I'm being watched?\"  \"They are at least ready to watch you. Mind you, Germany is a real block-house, and the elaborate spy system is an integral part of it. I should say, from what you tell me of the Buchers, that young Rudolph is the sleuth here.\"  \"Rudolph?\"  \"Yes. He's doubtless keeping an eye on you and reporting to the authorities if there's anything suspicious about you and your actions.\"  And then the journalist, pleased to have a fresh listener, launched upon his pet idea.  \"The Kaiser is preparing an abysmal pitfall for the world and it won't take heed. I tell you, Kirtley--and I want you to mark my words--Deutschland is going to spring at Europe like a tiger. The army and navy are ready for the onslaught. When they spring, it will be farewell to civilization--except the German--unless something like a miracle supervenes. The French army is being moth-eaten by the Socialists, the British navy has dry rot. I look to see Wilhelm"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19946"],["title","Villa Elsa (#8)"],["body","the ruler of the earth. If not, he will cause it to pay a cost that will make the next fifty years groggy.\"  Kirtley thought this was jesting. He later learned that the \"old man\" was regarded as \"cracked\" on this topic. Every spring he prophesied war, but it had not come. The Kaiser failed to rush to Paris and there dictate terms to an astounded and cowed universe. People politely laughed in their sleeves. Yes, Anderson was a fine fellow, but they wearied of his dismal forebodings that came to naught. Some said it was because German had been hard for him to learn. He had taken it up when more than fifty and had become tangled in its snarling roots--its beer-drunken syntax. \"He had got mad at the language.\" It was natural that he should get mad at the people.  Gard saw a light.  \"Perhaps,\" he said, \"that's what the Buchers really mean about the German army conquering everybody whenever it wants to.\"  \"That's it, that's it!\" Anderson was gratified by the confirmation. He went on with grave seriousness.  \"I'm a journalist. I have opportunities to see behind the curtain, haven't I? I have been at the army maneuvers, at the officers' messes and dinners, when they were sober and when they were drunk. Beer loosened their tongues and they did not care. They talk of it, boast of it, and the civilian, too. I'm telling no secrets. They are very frank about it. Don't you hear the Buchers openly discussing it? They all give us warning and we say it's a fine day. Did you ever read any of the Kaiser's speeches in German? There you find it all. But he's crazy, they say. Crazy or not, he has the most thoroughly organized and powerful nation behind him that the globe ever saw. And behind him to a man.\"  \"Why don't you write it up, then--tell people over home?\" Gard ventured, somewhat impressed.  \"Write it up? Tell people? That's what I _have_ been doing for five years. But what's the use of shouting to a world of fools? No one will pay any attention to it. My paper sends my stuff back and says it don't want war talk--it wants peace talk. Americans are happy and they don't want to be disturbed. They only want to hear about what they want to believe. So it seems to be everywhere.\"  \"I guess you are right about that,\" Gard testified. \"I have been a pretty fair reader of our papers and periodicals and have never been made to feel there was any need for alarm.\"  \"Exactly,\" Anderson scolded. \"Why, look at our Exchange professors. They are coming over here, ready to swallow the Germans whole. The Kaiser invites them to lunch on his yacht, gives them a pat on the shoulder blade, and they are his. While the Germans plainly despise us, our educators go home crying Great is Germany! How superior are her people! Let us send our sons over there to drink of her wisdom and grandeur! What inanity! Bah!\"  \"And so here I am,\" Gard smiled. \"But I have bunted into you almost the first thing.\"  \"Couldn't do better--couldn't do better,\" repeated Anderson with a cheering turn. \"I'll tell you what to do. I'll give you a little practical advice--free.\"  \"It won't be worth much if it's free, will it?\"  \"Well, it's worth this rotten German cigar you've given me. Read the editorials and correspondence in the Dresden papers. They're a good sample. There you'll see what the German attitude toward us is officially, and what German hatred feeds on day by day. The trouble with Americans over here is they don't read anything serious. Of course our students study their text books. But generally our people just fly around, hear music, drink beer in the cafés, but they don't read. Too nervous--afraid of being bored. So they don't learn much.\"  Anderson ran on into other subjects.  \"One great thing about the German system is that it would make such people work to some purpose. We don't. It also makes its plodders work. This Government recognizes frankly that most of its population, like all populations, are plodders, and it gives them something regularly to do and sees that they do it. This converts this dull element into an organized strength--a source of power. The Germans practice their wonderful economies with respect to the poorest kind of human energy. They kick something into their drones. So they are such a mighty nation in a small land.  \"In America, in other countries, this element is rather a disorganized weakness. It is not pushed. It is for the most part waste material or neglected material. Our public system, when economies are concerned, first considers money, property. It seems sometimes as if our free individualistic plan of government were, after all, adapted for the minority of the bright-witted.\"     CHAPTER XI  GERMAN WAYS   \"Had the Buchers ever known an American before you came?\" Anderson interrupted himself.  \"No.\"  \"How do you think they like you?\"  \"I guess if I dropped out of their lives, I would not create much of a splash.\"  \"You'll find they hate you. Hate is the German religion. The Germans can hate people they've never known, never seen. They hate on principle and without principle. Of course it's the proper precursor for their programme of conquering the world. If they were trying to love the world, they could not be preparing to demolish it and expecting to.\"  Though Anderson had lived so long among the Teutons, he had not become Teutonized. He was a marked exception. He viewed the nation with a metallic aplomb that at times sent shivers down Kirtley's spine.  \"Now this family of yours,\" he went on discursively--\"don't you notice about them and in them and behind them something tremendously unifying and propelling that is lacking in our American home?\"  \"I certainly do,\" responded Gard. \"I can't make it out--their dynamic, conscientious industry. What is it for? It's not with the idea of making money--like Americans, eager to accumulate the dollars. It's not for personal fame. It's not for any ambitious social position. It does not seem to be for any of the reasons that inspire an American household. And yet it is here, in this house, in every room, behind every chair at table, night and morning. It's bigger than anything we find in our Yankee life because it's beyond and higher than mere individuality. It makes the Buchers satisfied and still is something that has fearfulness lurking about it. It's not religious or divine--they are not actuated by such motives, do not speak of them. What in the world is it that the Germans have that is so wonderful and we do not seem to have?\"  Kirtley had thought a great deal about this and talked almost fluently.  \"I'll tell you,\" and the old correspondent, bent forward toward him earnestly, glad that he had a young, receptive mind opened out toward him. \"I'll tell you. It's simply the Hohenzollern in his mad and unconcealed pride about ruling the universe. He is in every German home like this, driving each individual to work the best, to make the most of himself and of herself, and without loss of time. He makes them understand that it's for the great German race--that they may become the potent force everywhere--leaders of mankind as he has taught them they deserve to be. It is for the benefit of their more and more deserving nation. But it is first and foremost for himself and his family. He has a burning, itching desire to reign everywhere. He is not a normal man physically and is unbalanced by a monumental vanity--arrogance--egotism.  \"When your Frau is so busily sewing, she is sewing for her household, it is true, but she is consciously and unconsciously sewing for Wilhelm. When your Fräulein goes out to her etching lesson, she is aware of being of the magnificent German people, and shares a part of the national ambition to excel. It's this that we haven't got in America and can't well have under our system. But it's this unified, disciplined zeal that enables two or three ordinary Germans to do what it takes four ordinary Yankees to do. Clad in armor and with a glistening sword in hand, Germania ought to scare men, and they are not taking the warning.  \"But, Kirtley, it scares me. I feel--see--something awful coming. In the universal German hate, the national boundary stops any flow outward of sympathy, good faith, equity. All peoples outside are human insects whom it is proper for the Teuton to tread on if he can, crush the life out of, because they are in his pathway to glory.\"  Kirtley, who had stared at his new friend in this solemnity, turned a serious face toward the clawlike branches of his linden in its gauntness of late autumn-tide. This meaning of the animus that was impelling his odd and yet so normal German household, he began to see, was substantiated by a score of acts and attitudes in its daily life. He scarcely deemed it proper to tell of them.  Besides, he did not want to fire up Anderson who already was so unsettled, so comfortless, on the subject. But Kirtley was reasoning out how this animus gave a solidity, a solidarity, to the German household--a satisfied contentment--because it was working toward a definite racial goal. Any such incentive was almost absent in the American family.  \"And so,\" wound up Anderson with epigrams, \"the years will be left humanity to weep these days of _insouciance_ and neglect. You can see that Germany is a man-made nation. It is not the kind God or Nature would make. God must have turned His face when the Teuton species was manufactured. Germany is like a man-made hot air register. When it isn't throwing up hot air, it is throwing up cold air. It is always throwing up.\"  To change the somewhat painful theme, Kirtley soon began:  \"I don't see any sports--such as we know them--in Germany. How do they get along without them?\" Like all Yankee college men he was alert on these lines.  \"No sports in Deutschland. Go out on the Dresden golf links of a morning and you'll find hardly a German soul playing. It's the same in Vienna--the same in Berlin. They have links because it's the fashion in England. The Germans ape everything. Go out on"]]]
