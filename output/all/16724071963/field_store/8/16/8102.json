Then to royal Damayanti--Virasena's kingly son,     To that slender waisted damsel--spake he comfort in his joy;     \"Since thou'st own'd me for thine husband--in the presence of the gods,     For thy faithful consort know me--aye delighting in thy words.     While this spirit fills this body--maiden with the smile serene!     Thine am I, so long thine only--this the solemn truth I vow.\"     Thus he gladdened Damayanti--with the assurance of his faith;     And the happy pair devoutly[49]--worshipped then the present gods.       Chosen thus Nishadha's monarch--the bright guardians of the world,     In their gladness all on Nala--eight transcendant gifts bestowed;     To discern the visible godhead--in the sacrifice, a gait     Firm and noble, Sachi's husband--Indra to king Nala gave.     Agni gave his own bright presence[50]--whensoe'er the monarch called.     All the worlds instinct with splendour--through his power Hutasa gave.     Subtle taste in food gave Yama--and in virtue eminence;     Varun gave obedient water--to be present at his call;     Garlands too of matchless fragrance;--each his double blessing gave.[51]     Thus bestowed their gracious favours--to the heavens the gods returned;     And the rajas, who with wonder--Nala's marriage saw confirmed     With the gentle Damayanti--as they came, in joy returned.     Thus the kings of earth departed;--Bhima in his joy and pride,     Solemnized the stately bridals--of the maiden and the king.     Fitting time when there he'd sojourned,--best of men, Nishadha's king;     Courteous parting with king Bhima--to his native city went.     Having gained the pearl of women--the majestic lord of earth     Lived in bliss, as with his Sachi,[52]--he that those old giants slew.     In his joy the elated monarch--shining radiant as the sun,     Ruled the subjects of his kingdom--with a just and equal sway.     Of the horse the famous offering[53]--like Nahucha's mighty son,     Every sacrifice performed he--with rich gifts to holy men.     And full oft in flowering gardens--and delicious shady groves,     Like a god, the royal Nala--took with Damayanti joy.     So begat from Damayanti--Nala, of heroic soul,     Indrasena one fair daughter--Indrasen one beauteous son.     Thus in sacrifice and pleasance--took his joy the king of men,     So the earth with riches teeming--ruled the sovereign of the earth.     BOOK VI.       Nala, chosen by Bhima's daughter--the bright guardians of the world,     As they parted thence, with Kali[54]--Dwapara approaching saw.     Kali as he saw, did Indra--did the giant-killer say,     \"Here, with Dwapara attended--whither, Kali, dost thou go?\"     Kali spake, \"the Swayembara--we of Damayanti seek;     Her I go to make my consort--into her mine heart hath passed.\"     \"Closed and ended is that bridal,\"--Indra answered with a smile,     \"Nala she hath chosen for husband--in the presence of us all.\"     Thus addressed by Indra, Kali--in the transport of his wrath,     All the heavenly gods saluting,--thus his malediction spake,     \"Since before the Immortals' presence--she a mortal spouse did choose,     Of her impious crime most justly--heavy be the penal doom.\"     Kali hardly thus had spoken--than the heaven-born gods replied:     \"With our full and liberal sanction--Damayanti chose her lord.     Who to Nala, with all virtue--rich endowed, would not incline?     He that rightly knows each duty--he who ever rightly acts,     He who reads the whole four Vedas--the Puranas too the fifth,[55]     In his palace with pure offerings--ever are the gods adored,     Gentle to all living creatures--true in word and strict in vow;     Good and constant he, and generous--holy, temperate, patient, pure;     His are all these virtues ever--equal to the earth-guarding gods.     Thus endowed, the noble Nala--he, O Kali, that would curse,     On himself recoil his curses--only fatal to himself.     Nala, gifted with such virtues--he, O Kali, who would curse--     Be he plunged in hell's dark torments--in the deep and vasty lake.\"     Thus the gods to Kali speaking--to their native heavens arose.     Soon as they had parted, Kali--thus to Dwapara began:     \"I my wrath can curb no longer--I henceforth in Nala dwell;     From his kingdom will I cast him--from his bliss with his sweet bride.     Thou within the dice embodied--Dwapara my cause assist.\"     BOOK VII.       Bound by that malignant treaty--Kali with his dark ally,     Haunted they the stately palace--where Nishadha's monarch ruled;     Watching still the fatal instant--in Nishadha long they dwelt.     Twelve long years had passed ere Kali--saw that fatal instant come.     Nala after act uncleanly--the ablution half performed,[56]     Prayed at eve, with feet unwashen--Kali seized the fatal hour.     Into Nala straight he entered--and possessed his inmost soul.     Pushkara in haste he summoned--come with Nala play at dice,     Ever in the gainful hazard--by my subtle aid thou'lt win,     Even the kingdom of Nishadha--even from Nala all his realm.     Pushkara by Kali summoned--to his brother Nala came,     In the dice of dice embodied[57]--Dwapara stood silent by.     Pushkara the hero-slayer--to king Nala standing near:     \"Play we with the dice, my brother,\"--thus again, again he said.     Long the lofty-minded raja--that bold challenge might not brook,     In Vidarbha's princess' presence--deemed he now the time for play.     For his wealth, his golden treasures--for his chariots, for his robes,     Then possessed by Kali, Nala--in the game was worsted still.     He with love of gaming maddened,--of his faithful friends not one     Might arrest the desperate frenzy--of the conqueror of his foes.     Came the citizens assembling--with the counsellors of state,     To behold the king approached they--to restrain his dread disease.     Then the charioteer advancing[58]--thus to Damayanti spake:     \"All the city, noble princess--stands assembled at the gate,     Say thou to Nishadha's monarch--'All his subjects here are met;     Ill they brook this dire misfortune[59]--in their justice-loving king'.\"     Then, her voice half choked with anguish--spake the sorrow-stricken queen,     Spirit-broken, Bhima's daughter--to Nishadha's sovereign spake,     \"Raja, lo! the assembled city--at the gate their king to see:     With the counsellors of wisdom--by their loyal duty led.     Deign thou, monarch, to admit them,\"--thus again, again she said.     To the queen with beauteous eyelids--uttering thus her sad lament,     Still possessed by wicked Kali--answered not the king a word.     Then those counsellors of wisdom--and those loyal citizens,     \"'Tis not he,\" exclaimed in sorrow,--and in shame and grief went home.     Thus of Pushkara and Nala--still went on that fatal play;     Many a weary month it lasted--and still lost the king of men.     BOOK VIII.       Damayanti then beholding--Punyasloka, king of men,[60]     Undistracted, him distracted--with the maddening love of play.     In her dread and in her sorrow--thus did Bhima's daughter speak;     Pondering on the weighty business--that concerned the king of men.     Trembling at his guilty frenzy--yet to please him still intent.     Nala, 'reft of all his treasures--when the noble woman saw,     Thus addressed she Vrihatsena,--her old faithful slave and nurse,     Friendly in all business dextrous--most devoted, wise in speech:     \"Vrihatsena, go, the council--as at Nala's call convene,     Say what he hath lost of treasure--and what treasure yet remains.\"     Then did all that reverend council--Nala's summons as they heard,     \"Our own fate is now in peril\"--speaking thus, approach the king.     And a second time his subjects--all assembling, crowded near,     And the queen announced their presence;--of her words he took no heed.     All her words thus disregarded--when king Bhima's daughter found,     To the palace, Damayanti--to conceal her shame returned.     When the dice she heard for ever--adverse to the king of men,     And of all bereft, her Nala--to the nurse again she spake:     \"Go again, my Vrihatsena,--in the name of Nala, go,     To the charioteer, Varshneya,--great the deed must now be done.\"     Vrihatsena on the instant--Damayanti's words she heard,     Caused the charioteer be summoned--by her messengers of trust.     Bhima's daughter to Varshneya--winning with her gentle voice,     Spake, the time, the place well choosing--for the deed, nor spake in vain:     \"Well thou know'st the full reliance--that in thee the king hath placed,     In his fatal hour of peril--wilt not thou stand forth to aid?     As by Pushkara is worsted--ever more and more the king,     More and more the fatal frenzy--maddens in his heart for play.     As to Pushkara obedient--ever fall the lucky dice,     Thus those dice to royal Nala--still with adverse fortune fall.     Nor the voice of friend or kindred--as beseems him, will he hear;     Even to me he will not listen--in the madness of his heart.     Of the lofty-minded Nala--well I know 'tis not the sin,     That my words this senseless monarch--in his frenzy will not hear.     Charioteer, to thee my refuge--come I, do thou my behest;     I am not o'er calm in spirit--haply he may perish thus.     Yoke the much-loved steeds of Nala--fleet of foot, as thought, are they,     In the chariot place our children--to Cundina's city go.[61]     Leave the children with my kindred--and the chariot and the steeds;     Then or dwell there at thy pleasure--or depart where'er thou wilt.\"     When the speech of Damayanti--heard king Nala's charioteer,     He, the chief of Nala's council--thus in full divan addressed,     Weighed within their solemn conclave--and their full assent obtained,     With the children in the chariot--to Vidarbha straight he drove.     There he rendered up the horses--with the chariot there he left.

To king Bhima paid his homage--sad, for Nala's fall distressed,     Thence departing, to Ayodhya[62]--took the charioteer his way.     In his grief to Rituparna--that illustrious king, he came,     As his charioteer, the service--entered of the lord of earth.     BOOK IX.       Scarce Varshneya had departed--still the king of men played on,     Till to Pushkara his kingdom--all that he possessed, was lost.     Nala then, despoiled of kingdom--smiling Pushkara bespake:     \"Throw we yet another hazard--Nala, where is now thy stake?     There remains but Damayanti--all thou hast beside, is mine.     Throw we now for Damayanti--come, once more the hazard try.\"     Thus as Pushkara addressed him--Punyasloka's inmost heart     By his grief was rent asunder--not a single word he spake.     And on Pushkara, king Nala--in his silent anguish gazed.     All his ornaments of splendour--from his person stripped he off,     With a single vest, scarce covered,--'mid the sorrow of his friends.     Slowly wandered forth the monarch--fallen from such an height of bliss.     Damayanti with one garment--slowly followed him behind.     Three long nights Nishadha's monarch--there without the gates had dwelt.     Proclamation through the city--then did Pushkara bid make,     \"Whosoe'er befriendeth Nala--shall to instant death be doomed.\"     Thus, as Pushkara gave order--in the terror of his power,     Might the citizens no longer--hospitably serve the king.     Near the walls, of kind reception--worthiest, but by none received;     Three nights longer staid the monarch--water was his only drink,     He in unfastidious hunger--plucked the fruits, the roots of earth.     Then went forth again the outcast:--Damayanti followed slow.     In the agony of famine--Nala, after many days,     Saw some birds around him settling--with their golden tinctured wings.     Then the monarch of Nishadha--thought within his secret heart,     These to-day my welcome banquet--and my treasure these will be.     Over them his single garment--spreading light he wrapped them round:     Up that single garment bearing--to the air they sprang away;     And the birds above him hovering--thus in human accents spake,     Naked as they saw him standing--on the earth, and sad, and lone:--     \"Lo, we are the dice, to spoil thee--thus descended, foolish king!     While thou hadst a single garment--all our joy was incomplete.\"     When the dice he saw departing--and himself without his robe,     Mournfully did Punyasloka--thus to Damayanti speak:     \"They, O blameless, by whose anger--from my kingdom I am driven,     Life-sustaining food unable--in my misery to find--     They, through whom Nishadha's people--may not house their outcast king--     They, the forms of birds assuming--my one robe have borne away.     In the dark extreme of misery--sad and frantic as I am,     Hear me, princess, hear and profit--by thy husband's best advice.     Hence are many roads diverging--to the region of the south,[63]     Passing by Avanti's city[64]--and the height of Rishavàn;     Vindhya here, the mighty mountain[65]--and Payoshni's seaward stream;[66]     And the lone retreats of hermits--on the fruits of earth that live;     This will lead thee to Vidarbha--this to Cosala away,[67]     Far beyond the region stretches--southward to the southward clime.\"     In these words to Damayanti--did the royal Nala speak,     More than once to Bhima's daughter--anxious pointing out the way.     She, with voice half choked with sorrow--with her weight of woe oppressed,     These sad words did Damayanti--to Nishadha's monarch speak:--     \"My afflicted heart is breaking--and my sinking members fail,     When, O king, thy desperate counsel--once I think of, once again.     Robbed of kingdom, robbed of riches--naked, thirst and hunger worn;     How shall I depart and leave thee--in the wood by man untrod.     When thou sad and famine-stricken--thinkest of thy former bliss,     In the wild wood, oh, my husband,--I thy weariness will soothe.     Like a wife, in every sorrow--this the wise physicians own,     Healing herb is none or balsam--Nala, 'tis the truth I speak.\"      NALA _spake_.      Slender-waisted Damayanti--true, indeed, is all thou'st said;     Like a wife no friendly medicine--to afflicted man is given.     Fear not that I thee abandon--Wherefore, timid, dread'st thou this?     Oh, myself might I abandon--and not thee, thou unreproached.      DAMAYANTI _spake_.      If indeed, oh mighty monarch--thou wilt ne'er abandon me,     Wherefore then towards Vidarbha--dost thou point me out the way.     Well, I know thee, noble Nala--to desert me far too true,     Only with a soul distracted--would'st thou leave me, lord of earth.     Yet, again, the way thou pointest--yet, again, thou best of men,     Thus my sorrow still enhancing--oh, thou like the immortal gods;     If this be thy better counsel--'to her kindred let her go,'     Be it so, and both together--to Vidarbha set we forth.     Thee Vidarbha's king will honour--honour'd in his turn by thee;     Held in high respect and happy--in our mansion thou shall dwell.     BOOK X.       NALA _spake_.      \"Mighty is thy father's kingdom--once was mine as mighty too;     Never will I there seek refuge--in my base extremity.     There I once appeared in glory--to the exalting of thy pride;     Shall I now appear in misery--to the increasing of thy shame?\"     Nala thus to Damayanti--spake again, and yet again,     Comforting the noble lady--scant in half a garment clad.     Both together by one garment[68]--covered, roamed they here and there;     Wearied out by thirst and famine--to a cabin drew they near.     When they reached that lowly cabin--then did great Nishadha's king     With the princess of Vidarbha--on the hard earth seat them down;     Naked, with no mat to rest on--wet with mire and stained with dust.     Weary then with Damayanti--on the earth he fell asleep.     Sank the lovely Damayanti--by his side with sleep opprest,     She thus plunged in sudden misery--she the tender, the devout.     But while on the cold earth slumbered--Damayanti, all distraught     Nala in his mind by sorrow--might no longer calmly sleep;     For the losing of his kingdom--the desertion of his friends,     And his weary forest wanderings--painful on his thought arose;     \"If I do it, what may follow?--what if I refuse to do?     Were my instant death the better--or to abandon her I love.     But to me too deep devoted--suffers she distress and shame;     Reft of me she home may wander--to her royal father's house;     Faithful wandering ever with me--certain sorrow will she bear,     But if separated from me--chance of solace may be hers.\"     Long within his heart he pondered--and again, again weighed o'er.     Best he thought it Damayanti--to desert, that wretched king.     From her virtue none dare harm her[69]--in the lonely forest way,     Her the fortunate, the noble--my devoted wedded wife.     Thus his mind on Damayanti--dwelt in its perverted thought,     Wrought by Kali's evil influence--to desert his lovely wife.     Of himself without a garment--and of her with only one.     As he thought, approached he near her--to divide that single robe.     \"How shall I divide the garment--by my loved one unperceived?\"     Pondering this within his spirit--round the cabin Nala went;     In that narrow cabin's circuit--Nala wandered here and there,     Till he found without a scabbard--shining, a well-tempered sword.     Then when half that only garment--he had severed, and put on,     In her sleep Vidarbha's princess--with bewildered mind he fled.     Yet, his cruel heart relenting--to the cabin turns he back;     On the slumbering Damayanti--gazing, sadly wept the king;     \"Thou, that sun nor wind hath ever--roughly visited, my love!     On the hard earth in a cabin--sleepest with thy guardian gone.     Thus attired in half a garment--she that aye so sweetly smiled,     Like to one distracted, beauteous--how at length will she awake?     How will't fare with Bhima's daughter--lone, abandoned by her lord,     Wandering in the savage forest--where wild beasts and serpents dwell.     May the suns and winds of heaven--may the genii of the woods,[70]     Noblest, may they all protect thee--thine own virtue thy best guard.\"     To his wife of peerless beauty--on the earth, 'twas thus he spoke.     Then of sense bereft by Kali--Nala hastily set forth;     And departing, still departing--he returned again, again;     Dragged away by that bad demon--ever by his love drawn back.     Nala, thus his heart divided--into two conflicting parts,     Like a swing goes backward, forward--from the cabin, to and fro.     Torn away at length by Kali--flies afar the frantic king,     Leaving there his wife in slumber--making miserable moans.     Reft of sense, possessed by Kali--thinking still on her he left,     Passed he in the lonely forest--leaving his deserted wife.     BOOK XI.       Scarcely had king Nala parted--Damayanti now refreshed,     Wakened up, the slender-waisted--timorous in the desert wood.     When she did not see her husband--overpowered with grief and pain,     Loud she shriek'd in her first anguish--\"Where art thou, Nishadha's king?     Mighty king! my soul-protector--O, my lord! desert'st thou me.     Oh, I'm lost! undone for ever--helpless in the wild wood left;     Faithful once to every duty--wert thou not, and true in word.     Art thou faithful to thy promise--to desert me thus in sleep.     Could'st thou then depart, forsaking--thy devoted, constant wife;     Her in sooth that never wronged thee--wronged indeed, but not by her.     Keep'st thou thus thy solemn promise--oh, unfaithful lord of men,     There, when all the gods were present--plighted to thy wedded wife?     Death is but decreed to mortals--at its own appointed time,     Hence one moment, thus deserted[71]--one brief"]]]
