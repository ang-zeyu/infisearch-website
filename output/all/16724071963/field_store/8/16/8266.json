It chanced, that the lady was a vehement Unionist, and \"rose,\" very freely, on the subject of the war. Sincere in her honest patriotism, I doubt if she ever guessed at the real object of her opponent in the arguments which not unfrequently arose. If there be any indiscretion in this pen-and-ink sketch from nature, I should bitterly regret the involuntary error, though its subject, to the world in general, remains nameless as Lenore.  There is another peculiarity of Baltimore society, which a stranger will only perceive when he has passed withinside its porches. It is divided, not only into sets, but, as it were, into clans. Several of the leading families, generally belonging to the territorial aristocracy (let the word stand) that took root in the State at, or soon after, its settlement, have so intermarried, as to create the most curious net of cousinship, the meshes of which are yearly becoming more intricate and numerous. Yet there are no especial indications of exclusiveness or spirit of _clique_; rather it is the homely feeling of kinsmanship, which makes the intercourse of relations more familiar and unceremonious, than that of intimate acquaintances or friends.  Cadets from many powerful houses in all the three kingdoms, were among the early colonists of Maryland. It is good to mark, how gallantly the \"old blood\" hold its own, even here; how, the descendants of soldiers and statesmen have already attained the pride of place that their ancestors won at home centuries ago, by a like valiance of sword, tongue, or pen. Take one family, for instance, with whose members I was fortunate enough to be especially intimate.  For generations past, the Howards have been men of mark in Maryland. Wherever hard or famous work was to be done, in field or senate, one, at least, of the name was sure to be found in the front. The present head of the family sustains right well the reputations of the worthies who went before him. A staunch friend and an uncompromising adversary--valuing political honesty no more lightly than private honor--liberal and unsuspicious to a fault in his social relations--very frank and simple in speech--in manner always courteous and cordial--it would be hard to find, in Europe, an apter representative of the ancient régime. I believe, that those who really know General Howard, will not consider this sketch a flattery or an exaggeration. He was a candidate for the Governorship at the last election, and so powerful was his acknowledged personal _prestige_, that, in despite of overt intimidation and secret influences, which made a free voting an absurdity, the Black Republicans exulted over his withdrawal as an important victory.  Though ordinary business is so slack in Baltimore just at present, almost every male resident, not engaged in law or physic, has, or supposes himself to have, something to do. Instances of absolute idleness are very rare. So, by ten, A. M., all the men betake themselves to their offices, and there busy themselves about their affairs, after a fashion, energetic or desultory, till after two o'clock. The dinner hour varies from three to half-past five. Post-prandial labor is generally declined; wisely, too, for few American digestions will bear trifling with; though Nature must have gifted some of my acquaintance with a marvellous internal mechanism. How, otherwise, could they stand a long unbroken course of free living, with such infinitesimal correctives of exercise? The evening is spent after each man's fancy--at the club, or at one of the many houses where a familiar is certain to meet a welcome, and more or less of pleasant company. The entertainments are often more extensive and formal, embracing, of course, music, and such are invariably wound up by a supper. I have heard certain of our seniors grow quite pathetic over the abolition of those social, if unsalubrious, repasts. I wonder at such regrets no longer, if I cannot share them. There is surely an hilarious informality about these _media-nochi_ that attaches to no antecedent feast; the freedom of a picnic, without its manifold inconveniences: as the witching hour draws nearer, the \"brightest eyes that ever have shone\" glitter yet more gloriously, till in their nearer and dearer splendor a Chaldean would forget the stars; and the \"sweetest lips that ever were kissed\" sip the creaming Verzenay, or savor the delicate \"olio,\" with a keener honesty of zest. The supper-tables are almost always adorned by some of the pretty, quaint conceits of an artist, whose fame extends far beyond Baltimore. Mr. Hermann's ice-imitations of all fruits and flowers, are marvellously vivid and natural: I have never seen them equalled by any continental _glaciers_.  I have lingered, perhaps, too long over too trifling details; and yet, I wish I had done my subject more justice. Be it remembered, that I visited Baltimore at a season of unusual social depression. I do not speak of the stagnation in commerce, and the ruin of Southern interests and possessions, from which many have suffered heavy pecuniary loss: the effects of the war come home to the fair city yet more sharply. For months past the best part of her _jeunesse dorèe_ have been fighting--as only the daintily born and bred _can_ fight, at bitter need--in the van of Southern armies.  Every fresh rumor of battle adds to the crowd of pale, anxious faces, and every bulletin lengthens the list of mourners. There are few families, Federal or Secessionist, who have not relatives--none that have not dear friends--exposed to hourly peril, from disease, if not from lead or steel. The suspense felt in England during the Crimean or Indian wars, cannot be compared to that which many here are forced to endure. _We_ knew, at least, where our soldiers were, and heard often how they fared: their sickness, wounds, and deaths were all recorded. But the scenes of this war's vast theatre are so often shifted, and communication with the remoter parts of the Southwest is so uncertain, that months will elapse without a line of tidings from the absent; the grass has grown and withered again, over many graves, before the weary hearts at home knew that the time was past, for waiting, and watching, and prayers.  The last season in New York, they say, has been the gayest known for many years. The _nouveaux riches_ have been spending their ill or well gotten gains right royally. But the temptations to exuberant festivity are few indeed in Baltimore, just now: with all that they have to endure and fear, it speaks well for the hardihood of her citizens, that they can maintain even a chastened cheerfulness.     CHAPTER IV.  FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.   I may not deny that I found the places in which my lines were just then cast exceedingly pleasant: if no serious purpose had been before me I could have been contented to sojourn there till spring had waned. But it is some satisfaction now to be able to think and say--I do say it, in perfect honesty and sincerity--that I did not lose sight of my journey's main object for one single day from first to last. Indeed I should have felt far more impatient of delay had it not been for the continuance of foul weather, and recurrence of heavy storms, which made armies no less than individuals, impotent to act or move. On the morning following my arrival, I took counsel with one who was, perhaps, better able to advise me as to my future course than any one then resident in Baltimore: certainly none could have been more heartily willing to help, both in word and deed. I owe to that man much more than a debt of ordinary hospitality. To say that his courtesy and cordiality were marked, where benevolence to a stranger is the rule, would very faintly express the personal trouble he undertook and the personal risk he incurred in his efforts to facilitate and further my purposes. Up to this moment I do not believe that he has grudged one whit of all this, much as he may have chafed at all having proved unavailing. I am right sorry that prudence forbids my chronicling here a name which will always stand high on my muster-roll of friends; but the memory of almost any Englishman who has visited Baltimore will fill up the blank that I must leave perforce.  It seemed that there was a choice of two routes into Secessia. The first--in many respects the easiest, and far the most traveled--lay through the lower counties of Maryland: the narrow peninsula on which Leonardstown is situated forming the starting point, whence the blockade-runner took to cross the Lower Potomac--there, from four to eight miles wide. It was necessary to run the gauntlet of several gun-boats and smaller craft; but traffic at that particular time was carried on with tolerable regularity, and captures, though not unfrequent, were, so far, exceptions to a rule. On the land route, before reaching the point of embarkation, lay the chief difficulties. A horseman traveling with saddle-bags, became at once a suspicious personage, liable everywhere to jealous scrutiny. The main roads were already becoming so cut up as to be traversed only with great toil and difficulty by ordinary vehicles, while the cross roads were simply impassable by wheels. The principal turnpikes still hard enough to carry a \"stage,\" _e. g._, that from Washington to Leonardstown, were more carefully guarded, and picketed at certain points, especially bridges. At any one of these points, a search might be apprehended, and anything beyond the simplest necessaries was liable to seizure as contraband of war; personal arrest might possibly follow, but the Federal outposts were said to content themselves, as a rule, with confiscation and appropriation, unless any documents of a compromising nature were found. Such a course was obviously pleasanter for all parties, than sending in prisoners--with their effects. Now it so chanced, that in the modest--not to say scanty--outfit, which I thought it worth while to bring out from home, was a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19706"],["title","Brood of the Witch-Queen (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                                       BROOD OF THE                               WITCH-QUEEN                                      BY                                SAX ROHMER                                     LONDON                        C.

In no case do the powers attributed to him exceed those which are claimed for a fully equipped Adept.  S. R.         *       *       *       *       *     BROOD OF THE WITCH-QUEEN  CHAPTER I  ANTONY FERRARA   Robert Cairn looked out across the quadrangle. The moon had just arisen, and it softened the beauty of the old college buildings, mellowed the harshness of time, casting shadow pools beneath the cloisteresque arches to the west and setting out the ivy in stronger relief upon the ancient walls. The barred shadow on the lichened stones beyond the elm was cast by the hidden gate; and straight ahead, where, between a quaint chimney-stack and a bartizan, a triangular patch of blue showed like spangled velvet, lay the Thames. It was from there the cooling breeze came.  But Cairn's gaze was set upon a window almost directly ahead, and west below the chimneys. Within the room to which it belonged a lambent light played.  Cairn turned to his companion, a ruddy and athletic looking man, somewhat bovine in type, who at the moment was busily tracing out sections on a human skull and checking his calculations from Ross's _Diseases of the Nervous System_.  \"Sime,\" he said, \"what does Ferrara always have a fire in his rooms for at this time of the year?\"  Sime glanced up irritably at the speaker. Cairn was a tall, thin Scotsman, clean-shaven, square jawed, and with the crisp light hair and grey eyes which often bespeak unusual virility.  \"Aren't you going to do any work?\" he inquired pathetically. \"I thought you'd come to give me a hand with my _basal ganglia_. I shall go down on that; and there you've been stuck staring out of the window!\"  \"Wilson, in the end house, has got a most unusual brain,\" said Cairn, with apparent irrelevance.  \"Has he!\" snapped Sime.  \"Yes, in a bottle. His governor is at Bart's; he sent it up yesterday. You ought to see it.\"  \"Nobody will ever want to put _your_ brain in a bottle,\" predicted the scowling Sime, and resumed his studies.  Cairn relighted his pipe, staring across the quadrangle again. Then--  \"You've never been in Ferrara's rooms, have you?\" he inquired.  Followed a muffled curse, crash, and the skull went rolling across the floor.  \"Look here, Cairn,\" cried Sime, \"I've only got a week or so now, and my nervous system is frantically rocky; I shall go all to pieces on my nervous system. If you want to talk, go ahead. When you're finished, I can begin work.\"  \"Right-oh,\" said Cairn calmly, and tossed his pouch across. \"I want to talk to you about Ferrara.\"  \"Go ahead then. What is the matter with Ferrara?\"  \"Well,\" replied Cairn, \"he's queer.\"  \"That's no news,\" said Sime, filling his pipe; \"we all know he's a queer chap. But he's popular with women. He'd make a fortune as a nerve specialist.\"  \"He doesn't have to; he inherits a fortune when Sir Michael dies.\"  \"There's a pretty cousin, too, isn't there?\" inquired Sime slyly.  \"There is,\" replied Cairn. \"Of course,\" he continued, \"my governor and Sir Michael are bosom friends, and although I've never seen much of young Ferrara, at the same time I've got nothing against him. But--\" he hesitated.  \"Spit it out,\" urged Sime, watching him oddly.  \"Well, it's silly, I suppose, but what does he want with a fire on a blazing night like this?\"  Sime stared.  \"Perhaps he's a throw-back,\" he suggested lightly. \"The Ferraras, although they're counted Scotch--aren't they?--must have been Italian originally--\"  \"Spanish,\" corrected Cairn. \"They date from the son of Andrea Ferrara, the sword-maker, who was a Spaniard. Cæsar Ferrara came with the Armada in 1588 as armourer. His ship was wrecked up in the Bay of Tobermory and he got ashore--and stopped.\"  \"Married a Scotch lassie?\"  \"Exactly. But the genealogy of the family doesn't account for Antony's habits.\"  \"What habits?\"  \"Well, look.\" Cairn waved in the direction of the open window. \"What does he do in the dark all night, with a fire going?\"  \"Influenza?\"  \"Nonsense! You've never been in his rooms, have you?\"  \"No. Very few men have. But as I said before, he's popular with the women.\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"I mean there have been complaints. Any other man would have been sent down.\"  \"You think he has influence--\"  \"Influence of some sort, undoubtedly.\"  \"Well, I can see you have serious doubts about the man, as I have myself, so I can unburden my mind. You recall that sudden thunderstorm on Thursday?\"  \"Rather; quite upset me for work.\"  \"I was out in it. I was lying in a punt in the backwater--you know, _our_ backwater.\"  \"Lazy dog.\"  \"To tell you the truth, I was trying to make up my mind whether I should abandon bones and take the post on the _Planet_ which has been offered me.\"  \"Pills for the pen--Harley for Fleet? Did you decide?\"  \"Not then; something happened which quite changed my line of reflection.\"  The room was becoming cloudy with tobacco smoke.  \"It was delightfully still,\" Cairn resumed. \"A water rat rose within a foot of me and a kingfisher was busy on a twig almost at my elbow. Twilight was just creeping along, and I could hear nothing but faint creakings of sculls from the river and sometimes the drip of a punt-pole. I thought the river seemed to become suddenly deserted; it grew quite abnormally quiet--and abnormally dark. But I was so deep in reflection that it never occurred to me to move.  \"Then the flotilla of swans came round the bend, with Apollo--you know Apollo, the king-swan?--at their head. By this time it had grown tremendously dark, but it never occurred to me to ask myself why. The swans, gliding along so noiselessly, might have been phantoms. A hush, a perfect hush, settled down. Sime, that hush was the prelude to a strange thing--an unholy thing!\"  Cairn rose excitedly and strode across to the table, kicking the skull out of his way.  \"It was the storm gathering,\" snapped Sime.  \"It was something else gathering! Listen! It got yet darker, but for some inexplicable reason, although I must have heard the thunder muttering, I couldn't take my eyes off the swans. Then it happened--the thing I came here to tell you about; I must tell somebody--the thing that I am not going to forget in a hurry.\"  He began to knock out the ash from his pipe.  \"Go on,\" directed Sime tersely.  \"The big swan--Apollo--was within ten feet of me; he swam in open water, clear of the others; no living thing touched him. Suddenly, uttering a cry that chilled my very blood, a cry that I never heard from a swan in my life, he rose in the air, his huge wings extended--like a tortured phantom, Sime; I can never forget it--six feet clear of the water. The uncanny wail became a stifled hiss, and sending up a perfect fountain of water--I was deluged--the poor old king-swan fell, beat the surface with his wings--and was still.\"  \"Well?\"  \"The other swans glided off like ghosts. Several heavy raindrops pattered on the leaves above. I admit I was scared. Apollo lay with one wing right in the punt. I was standing up; I had jumped to my feet when the thing occurred. I stooped and touched the wing. The bird was quite dead! Sime, I pulled the swan's head out of the water, and--his neck was broken; no fewer than three vertebrae fractured!\"  A cloud of tobacco smoke was wafted towards the open window.  \"It isn't one in a million who could wring the neck of a bird like Apollo, Sime; but it was done before my eyes without the visible agency of God or man! As I dropped him and took to the pole, the storm burst. A clap of thunder spoke with the voice of a thousand cannon, and I poled for bare life from that haunted backwater. I was drenched to the skin when I got in, and I ran up all the way from the stage.\"  \"Well?\" rapped the other again, as Cairn paused to refill his pipe.  \"It was seeing the firelight flickering at Ferrara's window that led me to do it. I don't often call on him; but I thought that a rub down before the fire and a glass of toddy would put me right. The storm had abated as I got to the foot of his stair--only a distant rolling of thunder.  \"Then, out of the shadows--it was quite dark--into the flickering light of the lamp came somebody all muffled up. I started horribly. It was a girl, quite a pretty girl, too, but very pale, and with over-bright eyes. She gave one quick glance up into my face, muttered something, an apology, I think, and drew back again into her hiding-place.\"  \"He's been warned,\" growled Sime. \"It"]]]
