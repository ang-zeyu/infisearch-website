After the loss of its mainmast at the very beginning Roger's craft had no more mishaps. It slid alongside of James's and together they bobbed gently across life's stormy seas.  \"It looks as if you and I were going into partnership, old man,\" James interpreted their behavior.  The other boats seemed to need no especial companionship but floated on independently, only Gregory's coming to an untimely end from a heavy wave that washed over it and capsized it.  \"I seem to hear a summons from the Witches' Cave,\" murmured Helen in an awed whisper as a sound like the wind whistling through pine trees fell on their ears, resolving itself as they listened into the words, \"Come! Come! Come!\"  Quietly they arose and tiptoed their way toward the dining room. They could only enter it by penetrating the thicket of boughs that barred the door. As they came nearer the voice retreated--\"Almost as if it were going into the kitchen,\" whispered Margaret to Tom who happened to be next to her. The only light in the room came from a pan of alcohol and salt burning greenly in a corner and casting an unnatural hue over their faces. The black cats, their eyes touched with phosphorus, glared down from the plate rail.  Again the voice was heard:--\"Gather, gather about the festal board.\"  \"We must obey the witches,\" urged Helen, and they sat down in the chairs which they found placed at the table in just the right number. Into the dim room from the kitchen came two figures dressed in long black capes and pointed red hats and bearing each a dish heaped high with cakes of some sort.  \"I just have to tell you what these are,\" said Ethel Brown in her natural voice as she and Ethel Blue marched around the table and placed one dish before Roger at one end and another before Helen at the other. \"It's sowens.\"  \"Sowens? What in the world are sowens?\" everybody questioned.  \"Grandfather told us that Burns says that sowens eaten with butter always make the Hallowe'en supper, so we looked up in the Century Dictionary how to make them and this is the result.\"  \"Do you think they're safe?\" inquired Della.  \"There's a doctor here to take care of us if anything happens,\" laughed James. \"I'm game. Give me a chance at them.\"  Roger and Helen began a distribution of the cakes.  \"Sowens is--or are--good,\" decided Dr. Watkins, tasting his cake slowly, and pronouncing judgment on it after due deliberation.  \"We tried them yesterday to make sure they were eatable by Americans, and we thought they were pretty good, smoking hot, with butter on them, just as Burns directed.\"  \"Right. They are,\" agreed all the boys promptly, and the girls agreed with them, though they were not quite so enthusiastic in their expression of appreciation as the boys.  Baked apples, nuts and raisins, countless cookies of various lands and hot gingerbread made an appetizing meal. As it was coming to an end Helen rapped on the table.  \"Please let me pretend this is a club meeting for a minute or two instead of a party. I want to tell the people here who aren't members of the U. S. C. what it is we are trying to do.\"  \"We know,\" responded George. \"You're working for the Christmas Ship. Didn't I dance in your minuet?\"  \"We are working for the Christmas Ship, but that is only one thing that the Club does.\"  \"What do the initials mean?\" asked Gregory.  \"United Service Club. You see Father is in the Navy and Uncle Richard is in the Army so we have the United Service in the family. But that is just a family pun. The real purpose of the Club is to do some service for somebody whenever we can.\"  \"Something on the Boy Scout idea of doing a kindness every day,\" nodded Dr. Watkins.  \"Just now it's the Christmas Ship and after that sails we'll hunt up something else. Why I told you about it now is because we planned to go out in a few minutes and go up and down some of the streets, and--\"  \"Lift gates?\" asked Gregory.  \"No, not lift gates. That's the point. We couldn't very well be a service club and do mean things to people just for the fun of it.\"  \"Oh, lifting gates isn't mean.\"  \"Isn't it! I don't believe you'd find it enormously entertaining to hunt up your gate the next day and re-hang it, would you?\"  Gregory admitted that perhaps it would not.  \"So we're going out to play good fairies instead of bad ones, and if any of you knows anybody we can do a good turn to, please speak up.\"  \"That's the best scheme I've heard in some time,\" said Edward Watkins admiringly. \"Let's start. I'm all impatience to be a good fairy.\"  So they said \"good-night\" to Dicky, bundled into their coats and each one of the boys took a jack-o'-lantern to light the way. Roger also carried a kit that bulged with queer shapes, and the girls each had a parcel whose contents was not explained by the president.  \"Lead the way, Roger,\" she commanded as they left the house.  \"Church Street first,\" he answered.  \"Church Street? I wonder if he's going to do Mother and me a good turn,\" giggled Dorothy.  It proved that he was not, for he passed the Smith cottage and went on until he came to the house in which lived the Misses Clark. Roger was taking care of their furnace, together with his mother's and his Aunt Louise's, in order to earn money for the expenses of the Club, and he had discovered that these old ladies were not very happy in spite of living in a comfortable house and apparently having everything they needed.  \"These Misses Clark are lonely,\" he whispered as they gathered before the door. \"They think nobody cares for them--and nobody does much, to tell the honest truth. So here's where we sing two songs for them,\" and without waiting for any possible objections he broke into \"The Christmas Ship\" which they all knew, and followed it with \"Sister Susie's Sewing Shirts for Soldiers.\"  \"Not very appropriate, but they'll do,\" whispered Roger to Dr. Watkins, whose clear tenor supported him. Dorothy's sweet voice soared high, Tom's croak made a heavy background, and the more or less tuneful voices of the others added a hearty body of sound. There was no response from the house except that a corner of an upstairs curtain was drawn aside for an instant.  \"They probably think they won't find anything left on their front porch when they come down in the morning. They've had Hallowe'en visits before, poor ladies,\" said Gregory as they tramped away.  The next visit was to a different part of the town. Here the girls left two of their bundles which proved to contain apples and cookies.  \"I don't believe these people ever have a cent they can afford to spend on foolishness like this,\" Helen explained to Dr. Watkins, \"but they aren't the sort of people you can give things to openly, so we thought we'd take this opportunity,\" and she smiled happily and went on behind Roger's leadership.  This time the visit was to the Atwoods, the old couple down by the bridge. Roger had been interested in them for a long time. They were not suffering, for a son supported them, but both were almost crippled with rheumatism and sometimes the old man found the little daily chores about the house hard to do, and often the old woman longed for a little amusement of which she was deprived because she could not go to visit her friends. It was here that Roger's kit came into play. He took from it several hatchets and distributed them to the boys.  \"We're going to chop the gentleman's kindling and stack up the wood that's lying round here while the girls sing to the old people,\" he announced.  So the plan was carried out. The girls gathered about the doorstep, and, led by Dorothy, sang cradle songs and folk songs and a hymn or two, while the boys toiled away behind the house. Again there was no response.  \"Probably they've gone to bed,\" guessed Ethel Brown.  \"I imagine they're lying awake, though,\" said Ethel Blue softly.  It is an old adage that \"many hands make light work,\" and it is equally true that they turn off a lot of it, so at the end of half an hour the old peoples' wood pile was in apple pie order and the yard was in a spick and span condition.  There were two more calls before the procession turned home and at both houses bundles of goodies were left for children who would not be apt to have them. On the way back to the house the U. S. C.'s came across the trail of a Hallowe'en party of the usual kind, and they pleased themselves mightily by hanging two gates which they found unhung, and by restoring to their proper places several signs which some village wit--\"or witling,\" suggested Dr. Watkins--had misplaced.  The evening ended with the cutting of a cake in which was baked a ring.  \"The one who gets the ring in his slice will be married first,\" announced Mrs. Morton, who had prepared the cake as a surprise for those who had been surprising others.  They cut it with the greatest care and slowly, one after the other. To the delight of all Dr. Watkins's slice proved to contain the ring.  \"I rather imagine that's the most suitable arrangement the ring could have made,\" laughed Mrs. Smith.  \"If one of these youngsters had found it, it would have meant that I'd have to wait a long time for my turn,\" he laughed back. \"Wish me luck.\"     CHAPTER III  MISS MERRIAM   The first fortnight of November rushed by with the final preparations for the sailing of the Christmas Ship filling every moment of the time of the members of the United Service Club. When at last their three packing cases of gifts were expressed to Brooklyn, they drew a sigh of relief, but when the _Jason_ actually left the pier they felt as if all purpose had been taken out of their lives.  This feeling did not linger with them long, however, for it was not many days later that there appeared at the Morton's a Red Cross nurse, invalided home from Belgium, bringing with her the Belgian baby which they had begged their teacher, Mademoiselle Millerand, who had joined the French Red Cross, to send them.  Truth to tell,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19834"],["title","Ethel Morton's Holidays (#4)"],["body"," arrival of the baby was entirely unexpected. It had come about in this way. When the club went to bid farewell to Mademoiselle Millerand on the steamer they learned that she hoped to be sent to some hospital in Belgium. Ethel Blue, who had been reading a great deal about the suffering of the women and children in Belgium, cried, \"Belgium! Oh, do send us a Belgian baby!\" The rest had taken up the cry and James had had the discomfiture of being kissed by an enthusiastic French woman on the pier who was delighted with their warmheartedness.  At intervals they mentioned the Belgian baby, but quite as a joke and not at all as a possibility. So when the Red Cross nurse came with her tiny charge and told them how Mademoiselle Millerand had not been able to resist taking their offer seriously since it meant help and perhaps life itself for this little warworn child, they were thoroughly surprised.  Their surprise, however, did not prevent them from rising to meet the situation. Indeed, it would have been hard for any one to resist the appeal made by the pale little creature whose hands were too weak to do more than clutch faintly at a finger and whose eyes were too weary to smile.  Mrs. Morton took her to her arms and heart at once. So did all the members of the Club and it was when they gave a cheer for \"Elisabeth of Belgium,\" that she made her first attempt at laughter. Mademoiselle had written that her name was Elisabeth and the nurse said that she called herself that, but, so far as her new friends could find out, that was the extent of her vocabulary. \"Ayleesabet,\" she certainly was, but the remainder of her remarks were not only few but so uncertain that they could not tell whether she was trying to speak Flemish or French or a language of her own.  The nurse was obliged to return at once to New York, and the Mortons found themselves at nightfall in the position of having an unexpected guest for whom there was no provision. Even the wardrobe of the new member of the family was almost nothing, consisting of the garments she was wearing and an extra gingham dress which a woman in the steerage of the ship had taken from her own much larger child to give to the waif.  \"Ayleesabet\" ate her supper daintily, like one who has been so near the borderland of starvation that he cannot understand the uses of plenty, and then she went heavily to sleep in Ethel Blue's lap before the fire in the living room.  Aunt Louise and Dorothy came over from their cottage to join the conference.  \"It is really a considerable problem,\" said Mrs. Morton thoughtfully. \"These children here say they are going to attend to her clothing, and it's right they should, for she is the Club baby; but there are other questions that are serious. Where, for instance, is she going to sleep?\"  A laugh rippled over the room as she asked the question, for the sleeping accommodations of the Morton house were regarded as a joke since the family was so large and the house was so small that a guest always meant a considerable process of rearrangement.  \"It isn't any laughing matter, girls. She can have Dicky's old crib, of course, but where shall we put it?\"  \"It's perfectly clear to me,\" said Mrs. Smith, responding to an appealing glance from Dorothy, \"that the baby must come to us. Dorothy and I have plenty of room in the cottage, and it would be a very great happiness to both of us--the greatest happiness that has come to me since--since--\"  She hesitated and Dorothy knew that she was thinking about the baby brother who had died years ago.  \"It does seem the best way,\" replied Mrs. Morton, \"but--\"  \"'But me no buts',\" quoted Mrs. Smith, smiling. \"The baby's coming is equally sudden to all of us, only I happen to be a bit better prepared for an unexpected guest, because I have more space. Then Dorothy has been just as crazy as the other girls to have a 'Belgian baby,' and she shouted just as loudly as anybody at the pier--I heard her.\"  \"Always excepting James,\" Ethel Brown reminded them and they all laughed, remembering James and his Gallic salute.  \"Don't take her tonight, Aunt Louise,\" begged Ethel Blue. \"Let us have her just one night. We can put Dicky's crib into our room between Ethel Brown's bed and mine.\"  It was finally decided that Elisabeth should not be taken to Dorothy's until the next day, but Mrs. Morton insisted on keeping her in her own room for the night.  \"She has such a slight hold on life that she ought to have an experienced eye watching her for some time to come,\" she said.  All the girls assisted at the baby's going to bed ceremonies, and tall Helen felt a catch in her throat no less than Ethel Blue at sight of the wasted legs and arms and hollow chest.  \"I wonder, now,\" said Aunt Louise when they had gone down stairs again, leaving Ethel Blue and Ethel Brown to sit in the next room until their own bedtime, so that the faintest whimper might not go unheard. \"I wonder where we are going to find some one competent to take care of this baby. A child in such a condition needs more than ordinary care; she needs skilled care.\"  \"Mary might have some relatives,\" Dorothy began, when Helen made a rushing suggestion.  \"Why not go to the School of Mothercraft? You remember, it was at Chautauqua for the summer? And it's back in New York now. I've been meaning to ask you or Grandmother or Aunt Louise to take me there some Saturday, only we've been so busy with the Ship we didn't have time for anything else. You remember it?\" she asked anxiously, for she had especial reasons for wanting her mother to remember the School of Mothercraft.  \"Certainly I remember it, and I believe it will give us just what we want now. It's a new sort of school,\" she explained to Mrs. Smith. \"The students are young women who are studying the science and art of home-making. They are working out home problems in a real home in which there are real children.\"  \"Babies and all?\"  \"Babies and children of other sizes. I'm going to study there when I leave college. Mother says I may,\" cried Helen, delighted that her favorite school was on the point of proving its usefulness in her own family.  \"Can you get mother helpers from there?\"  \"You can, and they're scientifically trained young women. Many of them are college graduates who are taking this as graduate work.\"  \"Then I should say that the thing for us to do,\" said Mrs. Smith, \"was to leave the baby in Mary's care tomorrow and go in to New York and see what we can find at the School of Mothercraft. Will the students be willing to break in on their course?\"  \"Perhaps not, but the Director of the school is sure to know of some of her former pupils who will be available. That was a brilliant idea of yours, Helen,\" and Helen sank back into her chair pleased at the gentle stroke of approval that went from her mother's hand to hers.  Dorothy and Mrs. Smith were just preparing to go home when the bell rang and Dr. Hancock was announced.  \"James and Margaret came home with a wonderful tale of a foundling with big eyes,\" he said when, he had greeted everybody, \"and I thought I'd better come over and have a look at her. I should judge she'd need pretty close watching for a long time.\"  \"She will,\" assented Mrs. Morton, and told him of their plan to secure a helper from the School of Mothercraft.  \"The very best thing you can do,\" the doctor agreed heartily. \"I'm on the Advisory Board of the School with several other physicians and I don't know any institution I approve of more heartily.\"  \"Ayleesabet\" was found to be sleeping deeply, but her breathing was even and her skin properly moist and the physician was satisfied.  \"I'll run over every day for a week or two,\" he promised. \"We must make the little creature believe American air is the best tonic in the world.\"  If the U. S. C. had had its way every member would have gone with Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Smith when they made their trip of inquiry on the next day. As it was, they decided that it was of some importance that Helen should go with them, and so they went at a later hour than they had at first intended, so that she might join them.  \"There's no recitation at the last period,\" she explained, \"and I can make up the study hour in the evening.\"  When the news of the baby's arrival was telephoned to Mrs. Emerson she suggested a farther change of plan.  \"Let me go, too,\" she said; \"I'll call in the car for you and Louise and we'll pick up Helen at the schoolhouse and we shall travel so fast that it will make up for the later start.\"  Everybody thought that a capital suggestion, and Mrs. Emerson arrived half an hour early so that she might make the acquaintance of Elisabeth. The waif was not demonstrative but she was entirely friendly.  \"She seems to have forgotten how to play, if she ever knew,\" said Mrs. Morton, \"but we hope she'll learn soon.\"  \"She sees so many new faces it's a wonder she doesn't howl continually,\" said Mary to whose kindly finger Elisabeth was clinging steadfastly as she gazed seriously into Mrs. Emerson's smiling face. Then for the second time since her arrival she smiled. It was a smile that brought tears to their eyes, so faint and sad was it, but it was a smile after all, and they all stood about, happy in her approval.  \"You two have your own children and Father and I are all alone now,\" said Grandmother, wiping her eyes. \"Let us have Elisabeth. We need her--and we should love her so.\"  \"Oh!\" cried both of the younger women in tones of such disappointment that Mrs. Emerson saw at once that if she wanted a nursling she must look for another, not Elisabeth of Belgium.  \"After all, perhaps it is better for her,\" she admitted. \"Here she will have the children and will grow up among young people. Are you ready?\"  When they picked up Helen she had a request to make of her grandmother.  \"I telephoned about the baby to Margaret at recess, just to tell her Elisabeth was well this morning, and she was awfully interested in the idea of the helper from the School of"]]]
