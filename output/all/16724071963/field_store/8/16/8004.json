Animals, elements, every observable thing of the solar system, all natural phenomena, are deified and revered. Like all primitive people, not understanding the laws of nature, the Apache ascribe to the supernatural all things passing their understanding. The medicine-men consider disease evil, hence why try to treat evil with drugs? Disease is of divine origin, so to the beneficent and healing gods the Apache naturally make supplication for cure.  The Apache, even if willing, could not directly impart their religious beliefs or their philosophy. It is only by study of their myths, myth songs, and medicine practices, and by close observance of their life, that a comprehensive idea of such beliefs can be gained.  A concise outline of the mythology of the Apache is given in the following description of the painted medicine skin(2) shown in the accompanying plate.  A—The nucleus of the universe, called Chalhké̆lh Nalíín, Night Girl. In the beginning it was merely a spot of color in which, during the course of time, a form appeared, and later emerged. This was Kútĕrastan, the Creator.  B—Kútĕrastan, the Creator of All, is standing on the clouds, his first home, holding lightning in each hand. To his left is the _tus_, or water bottle, in which the people of the earth took refuge from the flood shortly after their creation. Above him are four clouds, those into which he departed when leaving the earth for his celestial abode. He first created several assistants, who in turn created others by rubbing sweat and small particles of cuticle from the face and body.  C—Stĕnátlĭhăn, the chief goddess, first helper of Kútĕrastan, is seen standing on the clouds. In her right hand is a piñon tree, from the branches and gum of which the large _tus_ was made at the time of the deluge. Above her flies Dátĭlyĕ, the Humming-bird, who was sent as a messenger about the world to note how its creation progressed.  D—Chuganaái Skhĭn was the second person created by Kútĕrastan. He followed Stĕnátlĭhăn, and is therefore third in importance of the many deities. Not only does he give light to the day, but he has the power to relieve and cure disease with the aid of the first beams of his morning light. The Apache ask his blessing before sunrise, generally imploring his beneficence \"as soon as you look upon me.\" The serrated circles typify the abodes of these gods, which are protected by insurmountable barriers.  E—Here the sun as first made by the great creator is pictured. As time wore on, it grew to become the full round disc it now is.  F—The moon as first made by Stĕnátlĭhăn, at the behest of Kútĕrastan, who asked that she make something to illumine the night. The streaks represent catamenia, and the gradual growth of the moon is assumed to be parallel with prenatal growth.  G—This single symbol, a maltese cross, represents the four personages who made the stars. They have to do with the stars only, and are not prayed to as deities having power over the people on earth.

They are supposed to communicate with the medicine-men, bringing to them words of wisdom from the several gods as they sit and chant in ceremony, or when they are fasting. Their name, Nigostú̆n Bĭká Bĭnálzĕ, Earth Messengers, indicates that their powers extend to both the earth and the sky.  I and J symbolize spirits of the air who reveal to the medicine-men the wonders they claim to know in a priestly way. Such revelations are made to them in visions as they sit and drum and sing when endeavoring to discover some new cure for an affliction, or to initiate new customs that might be pleasing to the gods. The priests often take a medicine skin of this sort and go out into the mountains, where they fast and sing over it for hours at a time, awaiting the coming of the spirits.  K—It is supposed that any of the various gods have the power of calling on the lightning to carry messages from one to the other. Wherever shown in the symbolism of the Apache, lightning lines are drawn to indicate communication from one god to another.  Disc L 1—Nayé̆nĕzganĭ is the first son of Stĕnátlĭhăn, who was made to conceive by the sun’s rays as she lay asleep on the eastern slope of a mountain. He is the War God and miracle performer, the culture hero who in parallel legends appears in many North American aboriginal cults. Great monsters in the form of giant antelopes, rolling stones, and beasts of hideous conception are supposed to have inhabited the earth for a time, destroying its people. These monsters typify only the evils of this life; in fact death itself is spoken of in many legends as one of the monsters, in such form engaging in a long discussion with the miracle performer to prove that he should not be destroyed; if he were, the earth would become overpopulated. With his bow and arrow and turquoise lance Nayé̆nĕzganĭ banished these curses from earth. He himself was invulnerable as he appeared before these monsters, for the reason that he always buried his veins near a tree before attacking them. After he had killed them all, he and his younger brother, Tubadzĭschí̆nĭ, quarrelled. The Bluebird revealed to the latter the spot where Nayé̆nĕzganĭ kept his veins buried, so he sought them out and shot arrows into them, thus killing him. Other myths relate how Nayé̆nĕzganĭ was later resurrected, and he is still prayed to as the chief War God.

He took part in the creation, assisting Kútĕrastan and Stĕnátlĭhăn in finishing their work. At their direction he made a few people and many birds and animals.  3—To Yólkai Skhĭn is attributed the creation of all white things. He himself was brought into existence in the white cloud, and on emerging therefrom immediately began the work of making white rock and shells under the direction of Kútĕrastan and Stĕnátlĭhăn.  4—Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn is the God of Disease and Health. It is he who causes much sickness and he who can cure any disease, if he be so disposed. Especial care is taken by the Apache not to arouse his displeasure, and he is supplicated and propitiated whenever disease appears among them.  Disc M 1—Tubadzĭschí̆nĭ, the second son of Stĕnátlĭhăn, is the God of Water, because his mother conceived as she slept one afternoon under a ledge of rock from which drops of water trickled upon her. In the dance for rain all prayers and songs are addressed to him. It was he who created the ocean.  2—Yádĭlhkĭh Skhĭn is Chief of the Sky. In the origin story the Lightning was sent to encircle the earth to find how things appeared on all sides. On his return he brought back with him a large turquoise bowl containing three ill-formed persons, one of whom was Sky Boy. Later all three were put through a sweat-bath and their bodies perfected.  3—Yólkai Skhĭn, described above.  4—Hádĭntĭn Skhĭn, described above.

She is the Goddess of Death, or rather of the after-life, for she controls all souls that pass on to the future world. The road to this afterworld is supposed to cross her shoulders and is symbolized by the Milky Way, a trail made by the departing spirits. The Apache will not utter the name of a deceased person, because they say the dead have gone on to Yólkai Nalí̆n and are her people.

The scene of the drama is laid in the Low Countries at the beginning of the revolt against Spain. In the fifteenth century Philip of Burgundy had usurped dominion over several of the provinces of the Netherlands, and through him they had passed into the power of his descendant, the Emperor Charles V. This powerful ruler abolished the constitutional rights of the provinces, and introduced the Inquisition in order to stamp out Protestantism. Prominent among his officers was the Fleming, Lamoral, Count Egmont, upon whom he lavished honors and opportunities of service--opportunities so well improved that, by his victories over the French at Saint-Quentin (1557) and Gravelines (1558) Egmont made a reputation as one of the most brilliant generals in Europe, and became the idol of his countrymen. When in 1559 a new Regent of the Netherlands was to be created, the people hoped that Philip II, who had succeeded Charles, would choose Egmont; but instead he appointed his half-sister Margaret, Duchess of Parma. Under the new Regent the persecution of the Protestants was rigorously pressed, and in 1565 Egmont, though a Catholic, was sent to Madrid to plead for clemency. He was received by the King with every appearance of cordiality, but shortly after his return home the Duke of Alva was sent to the Netherlands with instructions to put down with an iron hand all resistance to his master's will. How terribly he carried out his orders has been told by Prescott and Motley. Egmont was an early victim, but his martyrdom, with that of Count Horn, and later the assassination of William of Orange, roused the Netherlands to a resistance that ended only with the complete throwing off of the Spanish yoke.  Such in outline is the background chosen by Goethe for his tragedy. With many changes in detail, the dramatist has still preserved a picture of a historical situation of absorbing interest, and has painted a group of admirable portraits. The drama has long been a favorite on the stage, where it enjoys the advantage of Beethoven's musical setting.     EGMONT     DRAMATIS PERSONAE    Margaret of Parma, (Daughter of Charles V., and Regent of the   Netherlands)   Count Egmont, (Prince of Gaure)   The Duke of Alva   William of Orange   Ferdinand, (his natural Son)   Machiavel, in the service of the Regent   Richard, (Egmont's Private Secretary)    Silva, Gomez, (in the service of Alva)   Clara, (the Beloved of Egmont)   Her Mother   Brackenburg, (a Citizen's Son), and Vansen, (a Clerk)   Soest, (a Shopkeeper), Jetter, (a Tailor), A Carpenter, A Soapboiler   (Citizens of Brussels)   Buyck, (a Hollander), a Soldier under Egmont   Ruysum, (a Frieslander), an invalid Soldier, and deaf   People, Attendants, Guards, &c.    The Scene is laid in Brussels.     ACT I    SCENE I.--Soldiers and Citizens (with cross-bows)  Jetter (steps forward, and bends his cross-bow). Soest, Buyck, Ruysum  Soest. Come, shoot away, and have done with it! You won't beat me! Three black rings, you never made such a shot in all your life. And so I'm master for this year.  Jetter. Master and king to boot; who envies you? You'll have to pay double reckoning; 'tis only fair you should pay for your dexterity.  Buyck. Jetter, I'll buy your shot, share the prize, and treat the company. I have already been here so long, and am a debtor for so many civilities. If I miss, then it shall be as if you had shot.  Soest. I ought to have a voice, for in fact I am the loser. No matter! Come, Buyck, shoot away.  Buyck (shoots). Now, corporal, look out!--One! Two! Three! Four!  Soest. Four rings! So be it!  All. Hurrah! Long live the King! Hurrah! Hurrah!  Buyck. Thanks, sirs, master even were too much! Thanks for the honour.  Jetter. You have no one to thank but yourself. Ruysum. Let me tell you--  Soest. How now, grey-beard?  Ruysum. Let me tell you!--He shoots like his master, he shoots like Egmont.  Buyck. Compared with him I am only a bungler. He aims with the rifle as no one else does. Not only when he's lucky or in the vein; no! he levels, and the bull's-eye is pierced. I have learned from him. He were indeed a blockhead, who could serve under him and learn nothing!--But, sirs, let us not forget! A king maintains his followers; and so, wine here, at the king's charge!  Jetter. We have agreed among ourselves that each--  Buyck. I am a foreigner, and a king, and care not a jot for your laws and customs.  Jetter. Why, you are worse than the Spaniard, who has not yet ventured to meddle with them.  Ruysum. What does he say?  Soest (loud to Ruysum). He wants to treat us; he will not hear of our clubbing together, the king paying only a double share.  Ruysum. Let him! under protest, however! 'Tis his master's fashion, too, to be munificent, and to let the money flow in a good cause. (Wine is brought.)  All. Here's to his Majesty! Hurrah!  Jetter (to Buyck). That means your Majesty, of course, Buyck. My hearty thanks, if it be so.  Soest. Assuredly! A Netherlander does not find it easy to drink the health of his Spanish majesty from his heart.  Ruysum. Who?  Soest (aloud). Philip the Second, King of Spain.  Ruysum. Our most gracious king and master! Long life to him.  Soest. Did you not like his father, Charles the Fifth, better?  Ruysum. God bless him! He was a king indeed! His hand reached over the whole earth, and he was all in all. Yet, when he met you, he'd greet you just as one neighbour greets another,--and if you were frightened, he knew so well how to put you at your ease--ay, you understand me--he walked out, rode out, just as it came into his head, with very few followers. We all wept when he resigned the government here to his son. You understand me--he is another sort of man, he's more majestic.  Jetter. When he was here, he never appeared in public, except in pomp and royal state. He speaks little, they say.  Soest. He is no king for us Netherlanders. Our princes must be joyous and free like ourselves, must live and let live. We will neither be despised nor oppressed, good-natured fools though we be.  Jetter. The king, methinks, were a gracious sovereign enough, if he had only better counsellors.  Soest. No, no! He has no affection for us Netherlanders; he has no heart for the people; he loves us not; how then can we love him? Why is everybody so fond of Count Egmont? Why are we all so devoted to him? Why, because one can read in his face that he loves us; because joyousness, open-heartedness, and good-nature, speak in his eyes; because he possesses nothing that he does not share with him who needs it, ay, and with him who needs it not. Long live Count Egmont! Buyck, it is for you to give the first toast; give us your master's health.  Buyck. With all my heart; here's to Count Egmont! Hurrah!  Ruysum Conqueror of St. Quintin.  Buyck. The hero of Gravelines.  All. Hurrah!  Ruysum. St. Quintin was my last battle. I was hardly able to crawl along, and could with difficulty carry my heavy rifle. I managed, notwithstanding, to singe the skin of the French once more, and, as a parting gift, received a grazing shot in my right leg.  Buyck. Gravelines! Ha, my friends, we had sharp work of it there! The victory was all our own. Did not those French dogs carry fire and desolation into the very heart of Flanders? We gave it them, however! The old hard-listed veterans held out bravely for a while, but we pushed on, fired away, and laid about us, till they made wry faces, and their lines gave way. Then Egmont's horse was shot under him; and for a long time we fought pell-mell, man to man, horse to horse, troop to troop, on the broad, flat, sea-sand. Suddenly, as if from heaven, down came the cannon shot from the mouth of the river, bang, bang, right into the midst of the French. These were English, who, under Admiral Malin, happened to be sailing past from Dunkirk. They did not help us much, 'tis true; they could only approach with their smallest vessels, and that not near enough;--besides, their shot fell sometimes among our troops. It did some good, however! It broke the French lines, and raised our courage. Away it went. Helter-skelter! topsy-turvy! all struck dead, or forced into the water; the fellows were drowned the moment they tasted the water, while we Hollanders dashed in after them. Being amphibious, we were as much in our element as frogs, and hacked away at the enemy, and shot them down as if they had been ducks. The few who struggled through, were struck dead in their flight by the peasant women, armed with hoes and pitchforks. His Gallic majesty was compelled at once to hold out his paw and make peace. And that peace you owe to us, to the great Egmont.  All. Hurrah, for the great Egmont! Hurrah! Hurrah!  Jetter. Had they but appointed him Regent, instead of Margaret of Parma!  Soest. Not so! Truth is truth! I'll not hear Margaret abused. Now it is my turn. Long live our gracious lady!  All. Long life to her!  Soest. Truly, there are excellent women in that family. Long live the Regent!  Jetter. Prudent is she, and moderate in all she does; if she would only not hold so fast and stiffly with the priests. It is partly her fault, too, that we have the fourteen new mitres in the land. Of what use are they, I should like to know? Why, that foreigners may be shoved into the good benefices, where formerly abbots were chosen out of the chapters! And we're to believe it's for the sake of religion. We know better. Three bishops were enough for us; things went on decently and reputably. Now each must busy himself as if he were needed; and this gives rise every moment to dissensions and ill-will. And the more you agitate the matter, so much the worse it grows. (They drink.)  Soest.
