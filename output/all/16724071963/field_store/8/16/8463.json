Examples of archaic work survive to us only by virtue of exceptionally favorable circumstances; it rarely happened that mound fabrics were so conditioned, as the soil in which they were buried is generally porous and moist; they were in some cases preserved through contact with objects of copper, the oxides of that metal having a tendency to arrest decay. The custom of burial in caves and rock shelters has led to the preservation of numerous fabrics through the agency of certain salts with which the soil is charged. Preservation by charring is common, and it is held by some that carbonization without the agency of fire has in some cases taken place.  Considerable knowledge of the fabrics of the ancient North American tribes is preserved in a way wholly distinct from the preceding. The primitive potter employed woven textiles in the manufacture of earthenware; during the processes of construction the fabrics were impressed on the soft clay, and when the vessels were baked the impressions became fixed. The study of these impressions led to meager results until the idea was conceived of taking castings from them in clay, wax, or paper; through this device the negative impression becomes a positive reproduction and the fabrics are shown in relief, every feature coming out with surprising distinctness; it is possible even to discover the nature of the threads employed and to detect the manner of their combination.  Evidence of the practice of textile arts by many ancient nations is preserved to us by such implements of weaving as happened to be of enduring materials; spindle-whorls in clay and stone are perhaps the most common of these relics. These objects tell us definitely of the practice of the art, but give little insight into the character of the products. It is a notable fact that evidence of this class is almost wholly wanting in the United States; spindle-whorls have in rare cases been reported from southern localities, and a few writers have mentioned their use by modern tribes.  It happens that in some cases we may learn something of the progress made by vanished peoples in this art by a study of the forms of such of their earthen vessels as were manifestly derived from baskets, or made in imitation of them. The ornamental art of peoples well advanced in culture often bears evidence of the influence of the system of combination of parts followed originally in the textile arts, and little art, ancient or modern, in which men have endeavored to embody beauty, is without strongly marked traces of this influence. By the study of archaic ornament embodied in clay, wood, and stone, therefore, the archeologist may hope to add something to the sum of his knowledge of ancient textiles. It should be noted that the pottery of the mound-builders shows less evidence of the influence of textile forms than does that of most other nations, and some groups of their ware appear to present no recognizable traces of it whatever.  Although much information has been brought together from all of the sources mentioned, it is not at all certain that we can form anything like a complete or correct notion of the character and scope of the art as practiced by the mound-builders. No doubt the finest articles of apparel were often buried with the dead, but a very small fraction only of the mortuary wrappings or costumes has been preserved, and from vast areas once thickly inhabited by the most advanced tribes nothing whatever has been collected. Of embroideries, featherwork, and the like, so frequently mentioned by early travelers, hardly a trace is left.  The relations of our historic tribes to the ancient peoples of our continent and to all of the nations, ancient and modern, who built mounds and earthworks, are now generally considered so intimate that no objection can be raised to the utilization of the accounts of early explorers in the elucidation of such features of the art as archeology has failed to record. The first step in this study may consist quite properly of a review of what is recorded of the historic art. Subsequently the purely archeologic data will be given.     PRODUCTS OF THE ART.   In undertaking to classify the textile fabrics of the mound region it is found that, although there is an unbroken gradation from the rudest and heaviest textile constructions to the most delicate and refined textures, a number of well-marked divisions may be made. The broadest of these is based on the use of spun as opposed to unspun strands or parts, a classification corresponding somewhat closely to the division into rigid and pliable forms. Material, method of combination of parts, and function may each be made the basis of classification, but for present purposes a simple presentation of the whole body of products, beginning with the rudest or most primitive forms and ending with the most elaborate and artistic products, is sufficient. The material will be presented in the following order: (1) Wattle work; (2) basketry; (3) matting; (4) pliable fabrics or cloths.   WATTLE WORK.  The term wattling is applied to such constructions as employ by interlacing, plaiting, etc., somewhat heavy, rigid, or slightly pliable parts, as rods, boughs, canes, and vines. Primitive shelters and dwellings are very often constructed in this manner, and rafts, cages, bridges, fish weirs, and inclosures of various kinds were and still are made or partly made in this manner. As a matter of course, few of these constructions are known to us save through historic channels; but traces of wattle work are found in the mounds of the lower Mississippi valley, where imprints of the interlaced canes occur in the baked clay plaster with which the dwellings were finished. When we consider the nature of the materials at hand, and the close correspondence in habits and customs of our prehistoric peoples with the tribes found living by the earliest explorers and settlers, we naturally conclude that this class of construction was very common at all known periods of native American history.  The constructors of native dwellings generally employed pliable branches or saplings, which are bound together with vines, twigs, and other more pliable woody forms. John Smith says of the Indians of Virginia[1] that--      Their houses are built like our Arbors, of small young     springs bowed and tyed, and so close covered with Mats, or     the barkes of trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding     either winde, raine, or weather, they are as warm as stooues,     but very smoaky, yet at the toppe of the house there is a     hole made for the smoake to goe into right over the fire.     [1] Hist. Virginia, John Smith. Richmond, 1819, vol. I, p.    130.  Butel-Dumont also, in describing the dwellings of the Natchez Indians of the lower Mississippi region, speaks of the door of an Indian cabin \"made of dried canes fastened and interlaced on two other canes placed across.\"[2]  A singular use of wattle work is mentioned by Lafitau. He states that the young men, when going through the ordeal of initiation on attaining their majority, were placed apart in--      An inclosure very strongly built, made expressly for this     purpose, one of which I saw in 1694, which belonged to the     Indians of Paumaünkie. It was in the form of a sugar loaf and     was open on all sides like a trellis to admit the air.[3]  Of a somewhat similar nature was the construction of biers described by Butel-Dumont. Speaking of the Mobilians, he says:      When their chief is dead they proceed as follows: At 15 or 20     feet from his cabin they erect a kind of platform raised     about 4½ feet from the ground. This is composed of four     large forked poles of oak wood planted in the earth, with     others placed across; this is covered with canes bound and     interlaced so as to resemble greatly the bed used by the     natives.[4]  According to John Lawson, similarly constructed \"hurdles\" were in use among the Carolina Indians.  [Illustration: 1.--Fish weir of the Virginia Indiana (after Hariot).]  The tide-water tribes of the Atlantic coast region made very frequent use of fish weirs, which were essentially textile in character. John Smith mentions their use in Virginia, and Hariot gives a number of plates in which the weirs are delineated. The cut here given (figure 1) is from Hariot's plate XIII. It represents a very elaborate trap; much simpler forms are shown in other plates. Slender poles set in the shallow water are held in place by wattling or interlacing of pliable parts.  It is probable that traps of similar character were used by the mound-building tribes wherever the conditions were favorable. The only apparent traces of such weirs yet found in any part of the country are a number of stumps of stakes discovered by H. T. Cresson in Delaware river near Wilmington, but these appear to be much heavier than would have been used for the purpose by the natives.  Another somewhat usual use of wattling is mentioned by various authors. Butel-Dumont speaks of a raft made of poles and canes, and Du Pratz, writing of the Louisiana Indians, says:      The conveniencies for passing rivers would soon be suggested     to them by the floating of wood upon the water. Accordingly     one of their methods of crossing rivers is upon floats of     canes, which are called by them Cajeu, and are formed in this     manner. They cut a great number of canes, which they tie up     into faggots, part of which they fasten together sideways,     and over these they lay a few crossways, binding all close     together, and then launching it into the water.[5]  We learn from various authors that cage-like coffins were constructed of canes and reeds something after the wattle style; and hampers, cages for animals, chests for treasures or regalia, biers, carrying chairs, fish baskets, beds and seats"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19921"],["title","Prehistoric Textile Art of Eastern United States (#2)"],["body","often similarly made. These articles, being generally light and portable, and constructed of delicate parts, can as well be classed with basketry as with wattle work.     [1] Hist. Virginia, John Smith.

This term may be made to cover all woven articles of a portable kind which have sufficient rigidity to retain definite or stable form without distention by contents or by other extraneous form of support. It will readily be seen that in shape, texture, use, size, etc., a very wide range of products is here to be considered. Basketry includes a number of groups of utensils distinguished from one another by the use to which they are devoted. There are baskets proper, hampers, cradles, shields, quivers, sieves, etc. There is frequent historical mention of the use of basketry, but the descriptions of form and construction are meager. An excellent idea of the ancient art can be gained from the art of the present time, and there is every reason to believe that close correspondence exists throughout.   BASKETS.  Lawson refers to basket-making and other textile arts of the Carolina Indians in the following language:      The Indian women's work is to cook the victuals for the whole     family, and to make mats, baskets, girdles, of possum hair,     and such like. * * *      The mats the Indian women make are of rushes, and about five     feet high, and two fathom long, and sewed double, that is,     two together; whereby they become very commodious to lay     under our beds, or to sleep on in the summer season in the     day time, and for our slaves in the night.      There are other mats made of flags, which the Tuskeruro     Indians make, and sell to the inhabitants.      The baskets our neighboring Indians make are all made of a     very fine sort of bullrushes, and sometimes of silk grass,     which they work with figures of beasts, birds, fishes, &c.      A great way up in the country, both baskets and mats are made     of the split reeds, which are only the outward shining part     of the cane. Of these I have seen mats, baskets, and dressing     boxes, very artificially done.[6]  James Adair, although, a comparatively recent writer, gives such definite and valuable information regarding the handiwork of the Southern Indians that the following extracts may well be made. Speaking of the Cherokees, he remarks:      They make the handsomest clothes baskets, I ever saw,     considering their materials. They divide large swamp canes,     into long, thin, narrow splinters, which they dye of several     colours, and manage the workmanship so well, that both the     inside and outside are covered with a beautiful variety of     pleasing figures; and, though for the space of two inches     below the upper edge of each basket, it is worked into one,     through the other parts they are worked asunder, as if they     were two joined a-top by some strong cement. A large nest     consists of eight or ten baskets, contained within each     other. Their dimensions are different, but they usually make     the outside basket about a foot deep, a foot and an half     broad, and almost a yard long.[7]  This statement could in most respects be made with equal truth and propriety of the Cherokee work of the present time; and their pre-Columbian art must have been even more pleasing, as the following paragraph suggests:      The Indians, by reason of our supplying them so cheap with     every sort of goods, have forgotten the chief part of their     ancient mechanical skill, so as not to be well able now, at     least for some years, to live independent of us. Formerly,     those baskets which the Cheerake made, were so highly     esteemed even in South Carolina, the politest of our     colonies, for domestic usefulness, beauty, and skilful     variety, that a large nest of them cost upwards of a     moidore.[8]  That there was much uniformity in the processes and range of products and uses throughout the country is apparent from statements made by numerous writers. Speaking of the Louisiana Indians, Du Pratz says:      The women likewise make a kind of hampers to carry corn,     flesh, fish, or any other thing which they want to transport     from one place to another; they are round, deeper than broad,     and of all sizes. * * * They make baskets with long lids that     roll doubly over them, and in these they place their earrings     and pendants, their bracelets, garters, their ribbands for     their hair, and their vermillion for painting themselves, if     they have any, but when they have no vermillion they boil     ochre, and paint themselves with that.[9]  It happens that few baskets have been recovered from mounds and graves, but they are occasionally reported as having been discovered in caverns and shelters where conditions were especially favorable to their preservation. Such specimens may as reasonably be attributed to the mound-building as to the other Indians. The following statement is from John Haywood:      On the south side of Cumberland river, about 22 miles above     Cairo, * * * is a cave * * *. In this room, near about the     center, were found sitting in baskets made of cane, three     human bodies; the flesh entire, but a little shrivelled, and     not much so. The bodies were those of a man, a female and a     small child. The complexion of all was very fair, and white,     without any intermixture of the copper colour. Their eyes     were blue; their hair auburn, and fine. The teeth were very     white, their stature was delicate, about the size of the     whites of the present day. The man was wrapped in 14 dressed     deer skins. The 14 deer skins were wrapped in what those     present called blankets. They were made of bark, like those     found in the cave in White county. The form of the baskets     which inclosed them, was pyramidal, being larger at the     bottom, and declining to the top. The heads of the skeletons,     from the neck, were above the summits of the blankets.[10]   SIEVES AND STRAINERS.  It is apparent that baskets of open construction were employed as sieves in pre-Columbian as well as in post-Columbian times. Almost any basket could be utilized on occasion for separating fine from coarse particles of food or other pulverulent substances, but special forms were sometimes made for the purpose, having varying degrees of refinement to suit the material to be separated.  Bartram mentions the use of a sieve by the Georgia Indians in straining a \"cooling sort of jelly\" called conti, made by pounding certain roots in a mortar and adding water.  Butel-Dumont describes the sieves and winnowing fans of the Louisiana Indians. The Indian women, he says, make very fine sieves--      With the skin which they take off of the canes; they also     make some with larger holes, which serve as bolters, and     still others without holes, to be used as winnowing fans. * *     * They also make baskets very neatly fashioned, cradles for     holding maize; and with the tail feathers of turkeys, which     they have much skill in arranging, they make fans not only     for their own use, but which even our French women do not     disdain to use.[11]  Le Page Du Pratz says that \"for sifting the flour of their maiz, and for other uses, the natives make sieves of various finenesses of the splits of cane;\"[12] and a similar use by the Indians of Virginia is recorded by John Smith:      They use a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe     the great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the     basket, receive the flowr in a platter of wood scraped to     that forme with burning and shels.[13]  From Hakluyt we have the following:      Their old wheat they firste steepe a night in hot water, and     in the morning pounding yt in a morter, they use a small     baskett for the boulter or searser, and when they have syfted     fourth the finest, they pound againe the great, and so     separating yt by dashing their hand in the baskett, receave     the flower in a platter of wood, which, blending with water,     etc.[14]   CRADLES.  That cradles of textile construction were used by the mound-builders may be taken for granted. The following is from Du Pratz, who is speaking of the work of the inhabitants of the lower Mississippi:      This cradle is about two feet and a half long, nine inches     broad. It is skillfully made of straight canes of the length     desired for the cradle, and at the end they are cut in half     and doubled under to form the foot. The whole is only half a     foot high. This cradle is very light, weighing only two     pounds. * * * The infant being rocked lengthwise, its head is     not shaken as are those who are rocked from side to side, as     in France. * * * The cradle is rocked by means of two ends of     canes, which make two rollers.[15]   SHIELDS.  Woven targets or shields would seem to be rather novel objects, but such are mentioned by John Smith, who used those belonging to friendly Indians in an encounter on the Chesapeake:      Here the Massawomek Targets stood vs in good stead, for vpon     Mosco's words we had set them about the forepart of our Boat     like a forecastle, from whence we securely beat the Salvages     from off the plaine without any hurt. * * * Arming ourselues     with these light Targets (which are made of little small     sticks woven betwixt strings of their hempe and silke grasse,     as is our cloth, but so firmly that no arrow can "]]]
