There's no getting on in this world without it. But I think I shall have to leave you now.\"  \"Then you don't mean to invite me to the wedding, mother?\"  \"It will be a private ceremony.\"  \"Will Jasper be invited?\"  \"His father was anxious to have him at home. Indeed, I have had a great deal of trouble to prevent his sending for him, but at length I have succeeded. I know too well the danger. The boy has a great influence over his father, whose mind is weakened with his body, and I should be afraid that the match would be broken off even at the last moment if the boy got wind of our plan.\"  \"How mad Jasper will be when he hears of it!\" said Thorne, laughing with malicious enjoyment. \"I wish I could tell him.\"  \"Don't breathe a word of it, Nicholas,\" said his mother, in evident alarm.  \"Oh, I'll keep the secret. But it won't do any harm when it's all over, will it?\"  \"Say nothing till I authorize it.\"  \"Well, I won't, then, if I can help it. But I say, mother, the old gentleman will come down handsomely when you're married. You ought to raise my allowance to two dollars a week.\"  \"I will if I can afford it,\" said his mother. \"But I must leave you now, Nicholas. I shall have about time to go to the station and meet the next train.\"  \"Shan't I go with you?\"  \"I should like your company, my dear boy, but we must be prudent. We might meet Jasper Kent.\"  \"That's so. Well, good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye, Nicholas,\" and his mother pressed her lips upon the cheek of her son.  He tolerated the kiss, but did not return it. His heart was not very impressible, and he cared for no one except himself.  \"I won't stop to see Dr. Benton,\" she said, at parting. \"You may tell him that I was in haste.\"  \"All right.\"  Mrs. Thorne emerged from the parlor and from the house. She was tall and erect in figure, and walked rapidly. Her face was concealed by a thick veil, but, for the information of the reader it may be described as narrow and long, with small eyes, like those of Nicholas, and thin, tightly-compressed lips. She was not a woman to yield to misfortune or give way to sentimental sorrow. She looked rather like one who knew how to face fortune and defy it. It was not a pleasant face, but it was decidedly a strong one.  The grounds of the school were extensive, and the house stood back two or three hundred yards from the street. A long avenue led from the house to the main thoroughfare.  Mrs. Thorne looked hurriedly about her as she went out on her way.  \"I shouldn't like to meet Jasper Kent,\" she said to herself. \"It might lead to unpleasant questions and suspicions on his part, and I don't want anything to happen before I am married.\"  It seemed likely that she would escape the encounter which she dreaded. Had there been no interruption or delay she would have done so; but it was not so to be. She met Dr. Benton in front of the house, and was compelled to stop and speak to him.  \"You find Nicholas well?\" he said, politely.  \"Oh, yes, doctor,\" she answered, softly. \"I have no anxiety on that subject, as long as he is under your care. I know that he cannot fail to do well.\"  We all like flattery, and the learned principal was not proof against it.  \"Ahem! Mrs. Thorne,\" he said, pompously, \"we try to do our duty by the young people intrusted to our charge. We do not limit our endeavors to their mental culture, but strive to promote their physical well-being also.\"  \"And you succeed remarkably well, Dr. Benton. But you must excuse my leaving you abruptly. I wish to catch the next train.\"  \"I hope we shall see you again soon, madam,\" said the doctor, politely.  \"I shall endeavor to call again before many weeks, Dr. Benton. Good-morning.\"  \"Good-morning, madam.\"  Mrs. Thorne adjusted her veil and swiftly resumed her course. Her heart gave a bound when, just outside the gate, she espied the well-known figure of Jasper Kent.  \"I hope he won't recognize me,\" she thought  But she forgot her peculiar gait, and the quick, rapid step, which were likely to identify her in the eyes of anyone who had seen her often. Jasper Kent's attention was drawn to her, and he observed these peculiarities.  \"By Jove!\" he said to himself, \"she walks just like the governess.\"  Still, having no reason to suspect the presence of Miss Thorne, as he called her, at the school, he would have thought the resemblance only accidental, but for a whiff of wind which blew the veil aside from her face. That face there was no mistaking.  \"Miss Thorne!\" he exclaimed, in surprise, advancing to meet her.  She was exceedingly vexed, but it would not do to betray it.  \"Jasper!\" she said, with a smile. \"You didn't expect to see me here?\"  \"No; did you come to see me? Is my father unwell?\" he asked, anxiously.  \"Your father is quite well.\"  \"Then--\"  \"Why have I come? I see that is what you wish to ask. I have not come on your account at all. I came to see a nephew of my own.\"  \"At this school?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"You must mean Nicholas Thorne.\"  \"Yes; do you know him?\"  \"A little,\" said Jasper, with reserve.  \"Poor fellow! He has neither father nor mother to look after him, only myself. I am his only relative living.\"  \"I never heard you speak of him before.\"  \"No; I have not cared to intrude my private concerns upon your father or yourself. But I must hurry, or I shall be late at the station. Have you any message to send to your father?\"  \"Give him my love, and tell him to take care of his health for my sake.\"  \"I hope he will do that for all our sakes,\" said the lady, with affected warmth. \"Good-bye.\"  \"Good-bye.\"  Jasper Kent looked after her as she walked rapidly away.  \"Why is it that I distrust her so much?\" he thought to himself. \"So she is Thorne's aunt. Well, he is not a relation to be proud of.\"  \"How vexatious that I should meet him,\" thought Mrs. Thorne. \"I ought not to have run the risk of coming. If he tells Nicholas that I have admitted a relationship it may do harm. Once the wedding is over I shall feel more secure.\"     CHAPTER IV.  THORNE'S REVENGE.   The unexpected communication which Thorne had received from his mother influenced his treatment of Jasper. Under ordinary circumstances he would have resented bitterly the humiliating defeat he had received at the hands of the \"new boy.\" Now, however, he felt sure of ultimate revenge, and was willing to \"bide his time.\"  \"Just wait till his father is dead, and mother is his guardian!\" he said to himself. \"Then, my young gentleman, your pride'll be taken down, see if it ain't!\"  His politic forbearance surprised the other boys, who did not understand the secret cause.  \"Ain't you goin' to lick that new boy?\" asked Tower, a sycophantic follower of Thorne.  \"What for?\" asked Nicholas.  \"Because he licked you the other day.\"  \"Who says he licked me?\" demanded the young tyrant, with a frown.  \"Why, all the boys say so,\" stammered Tower.  \"Do you say so?\" demanded Nicholas, savagely.  \"N-no,\" said Tower, timidly.  \"Lucky you don't,\" said Thorne, significantly. \"I'll lick any boy that tells such a lie about me.\"  Tower was silent.  \"The fact is,\" he continued, in a milder tone, \"we were stopped in the middle of the fight. I was called to see a lady visitor. But for that I should have licked him in the end.\"  \"I guess you can lick him,\" said the young sycophant.  \"Of course I can,\" said Nicholas, loftily.  \"Are you going to try it?\"  \"Why should I? I haven't anything against him. We came out even. What's the use of bearing malice?\"  Tower was astonished to hear such sentiments from Thorne. It did not sound at all like him. He was about the last boy who would be singled out for forbearance or forgiveness of injuries. So the younger boy concluded that his leader was afraid of Jasper. But here he did him wrong. Thorne had learned to respect his adversary's strength and skill, but he would have hazarded a second encounter but for the prudential reasons already suggested. For the present he thought it best to keep quiet.  Jasper also had made a discovery, though, as we know, the information he had received was not correct. He supposed Thorne to be a nephew of his father's governess, whereas she was his mother.  \"Does Thorne know this?\" he asked himself.  He could not feel quite satisfied on this point, nor could he determine precisely how far his feelings were affected by this discovery. He felt a dislike toward Thorne on account of his tyrannical disposition and ill-treatment of younger boys. He cherished a dislike for the governess, the cause of which he could not as well define. Now, it appeared that these two were allied to each other. I beg to say that Jasper was too sensible and gentlemanly to dislike the governess simply because she was poor. That he knew very well had nothing to do with the substantial worth of a person. But he could not rid himself of the feeling that Miss Thorne's residence in his father's family portended misfortune to the parent whom he loved so well.  So a week passed without any new disturbance or outbreak between the two boys. Jasper had been on the lookout, fearing that Thorne would take some opportunity to wreak vengeance on young Cameron when he was not present. But his fears were gradually allayed. Thorne seemed usually peaceable--so much so that his school-mates, who knew him well, thought he had turned over a new leaf, and speculated as to what had produced the change. But neither boys nor men change suddenly and completely, though policy and self-interest may for a time lead them to suppress the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19592"],["title","Frank and Fearless; or, The Fortunes of Jasper Kent (#3)"],["body","of their characteristic traits.  Nine days after the fight recorded in my first chapter, as Jasper was walking in the school-yard, Davies came up hurriedly.  \"Kent,\" he said, \"you're wanted.\"  \"Who wants me?\" asked Jasper. \"Is it Dr. Benton?\"  \"No, the doctor's absent.\"  \"Who wants me, then?\"  \"Little Cameron.\"  \"What! is Thorne at him again?\" asked Jasper, stopping short and looking toward the house.  \"Yes, Thorne's at his old business, bullying him. He took the opportunity when he thought you were out of hearing.\"  \"I must stop it,\" said Jasper. \"Where are they?\"  \"In the back yard.\"  \"I suppose I shall have to fight him again,\" said Kent, regretfully.  \"You needn't be afraid to try it. You are a match for him.\"  \"I think I am. That is not my reason.\"  \"What then?\"  \"I don't like fighting--it's brutal. Besides, I have another reason, which I don't care to mention.\"  By this time they had reached the scene of the difficulty, Little Cameron was half-crying, and Thorne stood over him with upraised arm.  \"Do as I tell you, you little blackguard!\" he was just saying, when a voice he well knew was heard, calm and resolute:  \"Thorne, are you bullying that boy again?\"  Nicholas turned and saw his old antagonist. He was sorry to see him, but he could not well withdraw now.  \"It's none of your business,\" he answered, sullenly.  \"I shall make it my business to protect the weak,\" said Jasper, quietly.  \"You may need to protect yourself,\" sneered Thorne.  \"If necessary, I feel competent to do so. Cameron, come here.\"  \"Don't you go!\" said Thorne, menacingly.  The little boy looked in terror from one to the other. Evidently he dreaded that the immediate result of his obeying Kent would be to precipitate a blow from the bully.  Jasper saw the little boy's quandary, and he quickly advanced to the rescue. Throwing one arm protectingly round Cameron's waist, he regarded Nicholas firmly.  \"Well,\" he said, \"what do you propose to do?\"  Thorne had had time to think. He hated Jasper worse than ever, but he knew that our hero did not care for blows. Moreover, he was likely to give back better than he received. There was another way of wounding him, which prudence would have led him to hold in reserve. But he was too angry to be prudent. Moreover, he had had a note two days before from his mother, from which he learned that the wedding was to be solemnized on that very day. Probably at that moment his mother was Mrs. Kent.  \"I won't fight,\" he said, with an unpleasant smile, \"seeing we're relations.\"  \"Relations!\" repeated Jasper, with a look of surprise and inquiry. \"I don't know what you mean.\"  \"You'll know soon enough,\" said Thorne, mockingly.  A suspicion of the truth entered Jasper's mind. He turned pale, and said:  \"Will you step aside with me, Thorne, and tell me what you mean!\"  \"If you like,\" said Thorne, indifferently.  \"Now,\" said Jasper, when they had withdrawn a few rods from the other boys.  \"It appears you haven't heard the news,\" said Thorne, with malicious enjoyment. \"Your father has married my mother. That makes us step-brothers, doesn't it?\"  \"My father married again!\" said Jasper, recoiling as if he had received a blow.  \"Yes. Strange you wasn't invited to the wedding, isn't it?\"  An hour later Jasper, having obtained special permission from Dr. Benton, was on his way home, sick with apprehension lest this threatened misfortune should prove real.     CHAPTER V.  JASPER'S RETURN HOME.   His father married again, and he left in ignorance of his intention! Jasper felt hurt that his father, for whom he cherished so deep and warm an affection, should have taken such a step without apprising him of it in advance. If he was to marry, certainly his only son ought to have been present at the wedding.  \"But it isn't father's fault,\" he thought, bitterly. \"It's the fault of Miss Thorne. She is more artful and designing even than I thought. She has married my father for his wealth and position, and she was afraid I would dissuade him from such a step.\"  It was certainly a bitter thought that he must look upon this woman as his step-mother--that she was to take the place of the mother whom he tenderly remembered, though six years had passed since she left him. But, after all, was it true? Might it not be the case that Thorne, who evidently disliked him, had fabricated the story in order to annoy him? There was a gleam of comfort in this, and he felt that he would willingly run the risk of being laughed at for having started on a \"wild-goose chase\" if only his fears could be relieved. But, after all, there was the possibility--nay, the probability, considering what he knew of Miss Thorne--that Thorne's story was all true.  The cars stopped for a brief minute at the depot in Morton, Jasper's destination, and he jumped out. He looked eagerly about him to see if there was anyone of whom he could ask information. To his joy he caught sight of John, a serving-man in his father's employ.  \"Halloo, John!\" he cried, \"give me a hand with my valise!\"  \"Why, Master Jasper!\" returned John, in evident surprise, \"I didn't know you were coming home.\"  \"I am not expected,\" said Jasper. \"I came at a moment's notice.\"  \"You're too late for the wedding, Master Jasper.\"  \"For the wedding!\" repeated Jasper, his heart sinking at this confirmation of his worst fears.  \"Yes; didn't you know of it?\"  \"I heard something, but not much. Tell me about it. When did it take place?\"  \"At ten o'clock this morning.\"  \"At the house?\"  \"No; your father and the governess walked over to the church, and were married private like. There was nobody invited, but we were all surprised that you didn't come to it.\"  \"I knew nothing about it,\" said Jasper, sadly.  \"It was Miss Thorne's doings, then--leastways, I must say Mrs. Kent's, now.\"  \"I know it, John. My father would not have treated me that way. How long has it been going on--the--\"  \"The courtship? Well, that was all on the side of Miss Thorne, I'm thinkin'. She wheedled your father into marrying her.\"  \"I wish I had been here.\"  \"Poor man! he felt too weak to resist, and he did it only because she teased him. I can take my oath of that.\"  \"It is infamous!\" said Jasper. \"Have they gone away?\"  \"No; they ain't goin', I've heard. Your father don't feel able to travel, and the governess--I mean your step-mother--she don't care much. They're at home now.\"  \"Then I will go up. I suppose they will be surprised to see me.\"  \"Yes, they will, but your father'll be glad. He sets the world by you, Master Jasper.\"  \"I believe he does, John,\" said Jasper. \"I wish I could have saved him from this misfortune.\"  \"It's too late now entirely.\"  \"You are right. I don't know but it might be best for me to turn round and go back again to school without going to the house at all; but I must face this thing, and see for myself. If you've got nothing else to do, John, you may carry my valise.\"  \"I'll do it, Master Jasper, directly. You go up to the house, and I'll be there in a jiffy.\"  So Jasper walked thoughtfully and sadly homeward.  We must precede him.  In a sunny sitting-room on the second-floor sat Jasper Kent's father in a luxurious arm-chair. He was barely fifty, but evidently a chronic invalid. His constitution had been undermined years before by a residence of several years in Central America, where he had acquired a fortune, but paid a costly price therefor in the loss of his health.  For years he had done no business other than to take care of his property, which was amply sufficient to enable him to live luxuriously. Yet he did not find the time hanging heavily upon his hands. Of a studious taste, he had surrounded himself with books and pictures. He received regularly a New York daily paper, and the leading magazines and reviews, and barring his ill-health, and occasional seasons of pain, passed his time in a placid and agreeable manner. Circumstances, perhaps, had fostered a disposition to indolence, and made it more difficult to resist the artful schemes of Miss Thorne, whom he had admitted into the house as governess of his little niece, Florence Grantley, but who had from the first cherished the ambitious design of making herself mistress of the establishment.  It is needless to recapitulate the steps she took in this direction. It is enough to chronicle her ultimate success.  We introduce the newly-married pair, as they sit conversing in the pleasant sitting-room already referred to.  \"I think Jasper ought to be at once informed of our marriage,\" said Mr. Kent.  \"There is no need of haste, in my opinion, my dear,\" said Mrs. Kent.  \"Indeed, he ought to have been present at the ceremony. I am afraid the poor boy will feel hurt that I should have left him wholly in the dark.\"  Mrs. Kent's lip curled. Evidently she had no particular feeling for the \"poor boy.\"  \"Lay the whole blame upon me, Mr. Kent,\" she said. \"It was I who advised it, and I am willing to take the responsibility.\"  \"I know you advised it, my dear,\" said Mr. Kent, to whom this phrase was yet new; \"but I could not understand why.\"  \"I will explain, and I think you will consider my explanation a good one. It would have taken Jasper's attention from his studies, and it might have been some time before he would have been able to resume them to advantage.\"  \"That may be, but still on an occasion of this kind--\"  \"If the ceremony had not been so private--wholly out of regard to your health--of course he should have been recalled. As it is, it is better on all accounts not to disturb him. Did I tell you that I saw him last week?\"  \"Saw Jasper?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Was he here? Why did I not see him?\" asked Mr. Kent, in surprise.  \"It was not here that I saw him--it was at his school.\"  \"At his school! How came you to go there?\" inquired her husband in still greater surprise.  \"I will tell you, though I have hitherto kept it a secret, as a matter of my own. Now, since I am your wife, it is only proper that I should acquaint you with it. I have a nephew at the"]]]
