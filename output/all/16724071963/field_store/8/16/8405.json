The story grew after the title had been (hastily) given, and so many other incidents gathered round the incident of the purchase of the flat iron as to make it no longer important enough to appear upon the title page. It would, however, be dishonest to change the name of a tale which is reprinted from a Magazine; and I can only apologise for an appearance of affectation in it which was not intended.  As the Dedication may seem to suggest that the character of Mrs. Bundle is a portrait, I may be allowed to say that, except in faithfulness, and tenderness, and high principle, she bears no likeness to my father's dear old nurse.  It may interest some of my child readers to know that the steep street and the farthing wares are real remembrances out of my own childhood. Though whether in these days of \"advanced prices,\" the flat irons, the gridirons with the three fish upon them, and all those other valuable accessories to doll's housekeeping, which I once delighted to purchase, can still be obtained for a farthing each, I have lived too long out of the world of toys to be able to tell.

In the first place, it is about myself, and so I take an interest in it. Secondly, it is about some one very dear to me, as will appear hereafter. Thirdly, it is the only original story in my somewhat limited collection, and I am naturally rather proud of the favour with which it is invariably received. I think it was the foolish fancy of my dear wife and children combined that this most veracious history should be committed to paper. It was either because--being so unused to authorship--I had no notion of composition, and was troubled by a tyro tendency to stray from my subject; or because the part played by the flat iron, though important, was small; or because I and my affairs were most chiefly interesting to myself as writer, and my family as readers; or from a combination of all these reasons together, that my tale outgrew its first title and we had to add a second, and call it \"Some Passages in the Life of an only Son.\"  Yes, I was an only son. I was an only child also, speaking as the world speaks, and not as Wordsworth's \"simple child\" spoke. But let me rather use the \"little maid's\" reckoning, and say that I have, rather than that I had, a sister. \"Her grave is green, it may be seen.\" She peeped into the world, and we called her Alice; then she went away again and took my mother with her. It was my first great, bitter grief.  I remember well the day when I was led with much mysterious solemnity to see my new sister. She was then a week old.  \"You must be quiet, sir,\" said Mrs. Bundle, a new member of our establishment, \"and not on no account make no noise to disturb your dear, pretty mamma.\"  Repressed by this accumulation of negatives, as well as by the size and dignity of Mrs. Bundle's outward woman, I went a-tiptoe under her large shadow to see my new acquisition.  Very young children are not always pretty, but my sister was beautiful beyond the wont of babies. It is an old simile, but she was like a beautiful painting of a cherub. Her little face wore an expression seldom seen except on a few faces of those who have but lately come into this world, or those who are about to go from it. The hair that just gilded the pink head I was allowed to kiss was one shade paler than that which made a great aureole on the pillow about the pale face of my \"dear, pretty\" mother.  Years afterwards--in Belgium--I bought an old mediæval painting of a Madonna. That Madonna had a stiffness, a deadly pallor, a thinness of face incompatible with strict beauty. But on the thin lips there was a smile for which no word is lovely enough; and in the eyes was a pure and far-seeing look, hardly to be imagined except by one who painted (like Fra Angelico) upon his knees. The background (like that of many religious paintings of the date) was gilt. With such a look and such a smile my mother's face shone out of the mass of her golden hair the day she died. For this I bought the picture; for this I keep it still.  But to go back.  I liked Mrs. Bundle. I had taken to her from the evening when she arrived in a red shawl, with several bandboxes. My affection for her was established next day, when she washed my face before dinner. My own nurse was bony, her hands were all knuckles, and she washed my face as she scrubbed the nursery floor on Saturdays. Mrs. Bundle's plump palms were like pincushions, and she washed my face as if it had been a baby's.  On the evening of the day when I first saw Sister Alice, I took tea in the housekeeper's room. My nurse was out for the evening, but Mrs. Cadman from the village was of the party, and neither cakes nor conversation flagged. Mrs. Cadman had hollow eyes, and (on occasion) a hollow voice, which was very impressive. She wore curl-papers continually, which once caused me to ask my nurse if she ever took them out.  \"On Sundays she do,\" said Nurse.  \"She's very religious then, I suppose,\" said I; and I did really think it a great compliment that she paid to the first day of the week.  I was only just four years old at this time--an age when one is apt to ask inconvenient questions and to make strange observations--when one is struggling to understand life through the mist of novelties about one, and the additional confusion of falsehood which it is so common to speak or to insinuate without scruple to very young children.  The housekeeper and Mrs. Cadman had conversed for some time after tea without diverting my attention from the new box of bricks which"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19859"],["title","A Flat Iron for a Farthing; or, Some Passages in the Life of an only Son (#1)"],["body","s. Bundle (commissioned by my father) had brought from the town for me; but when I had put all the round arches on the pairs of pillars, and had made a very successful \"Tower of Babel\" with cross layers of the bricks tapering towards the top, I had leisure to look round and listen.  \"I never know'd one with that look as lived,\" Mrs. Cadman was saying, in her hollow tone. \"It took notice from the first. Mark my words, ma'am, a sweeter child I never saw, but it's _too_ good and _too_ pretty to be long for this world.\"  It is difficult to say exactly how much one understands at four years old, or rather how far one quite comprehends the things one perceives in part. I understood, or felt, enough of what I heard, and of the sympathetic sighs that followed Mrs. Cadman's speech, to make me stumble over the Tower of Babel, and present myself at Mrs. Cadman's knee with the question--  \"Is mamma too pretty and good for this world, Mrs. Cadman?\"  I caught her elderly wink as quickly as the housekeeper, to whom it was directed. I was not completely deceived by her answer.  \"Why, bless his dear heart, Master Reginald. Who did he think I was talking about, love?\"  \"My new baby sister,\" said I, without hesitation.  \"No such thing, lovey,\" said the audacious Mrs. Cadman; \"housekeeper and me was talking about Mrs. Jones's little boy.\"  \"Where does Mrs. Jones live?\" I asked.  \"In London town, my dear.\"  I sighed. I knew nothing of London town, and could not prove that Mrs. Jones had no existence. But I felt dimly dissatisfied, in spite of a slice of sponge-cake, and being put to bed (for a treat) in papa's dressing-room. My sleep was broken by uneasy dreams, in which Mrs. Jones figured with the face of Mrs. Cadman and her hollow voice. I had a sensation that that night the house never went to rest. People came in and out with a pretentious purpose of not awaking me. My father never came to bed. I felt convinced that I heard the doctor's voice in the passage. At last, while it was yet dark, and when I seemed to have been sleeping and waking, waking and falling asleep again in my crib for weeks, my father came in with a strange look upon his face, and took me up in his arms, and wrapped a blanket round me, saying mamma wanted to kiss me, but I must be very good and make no noise. There was little fear of that! I gazed in utter silence at the sweet face that was whiter than the sheet below it, the hair that shone brighter than ever in the candlelight. Only when I kissed her, and she had laid her wan hand on my head, I whispered to my father, \"Why is mamma so cold?\"  With a smothered groan he carried me back to bed, and I cried myself to sleep. It was too true, then. She was too good and too pretty for this world, and before sunrise she was gone.  Before the day was ended Sister Alice left us also. She never knew a harder resting-place than our mother's arms.     CHAPTER II  \"THE LOOK\"--RUBENS--MRS. BUNDLE AGAIN   My widowed father and I were both terribly lonely. The depths of his loss in the lovely and lovable wife who had been his constant companion for nearly six years I could not fathom at the time. For my own part, I was quite as miserable as I have ever been since, and I doubt if I shall ever feel such overwhelming desolation again, unless the same sorrow befalls me as then befell him.  I \"fretted\"--as the servants expressed it--to such an extent as to affect my health; and I fancy it was because my father's attention was called to the fact that I was fast fading after the mother and sister whose death (and my own loneliness) I bewailed, that he roused himself from his own grief to comfort mine. Once more I was \"dressed\" after tea. Of late my bony nurse had not thought it necessary to go through this ceremony, and I had crept about in the same crape-covered frock from breakfast to bedtime.  Now I came down to dessert again, and though I think the empty place at the end of the table gave my father a fresh shock when I took my old post by him, yet I fancy the lonely evening was less lonely for my presence.  From his intense indulgence I think I dimly gathered that he thought me ill. I combined this in my mind with a speech of my nurse's that I had overheard, and which gave me the horrors at the time--\"He's got _the look_! It's his poor ma over again!\"--and I felt a sort of melancholy self-importance not uncommon with children who are out of health.  I may say here that my nurse had a quality very common amongst uneducated people. She was \"sensational;\" and her custom of going over all the circumstances of my mother's death and funeral (down to the price of the black paramatta of which her own dress was composed) with her friends, when she took me out walking, had not tended to make me happier or more cheerful.  That night I ate more from my father's plate than I had eaten for weeks. As I lay after dinner with my head upon his breast, he stroked my curls with a tender touch that seemed to heal my griefs, and said, almost in a tone of remorse,  \"What can papa do for you, my poor dear boy?\"  I looked up quickly into his face.  \"What would Regie like?\" he persisted.  I quite understood him now, and spoke out boldly the desires of my heart.  \"Please, papa, I should like Mrs. Bundle for a nurse; and I do very much want Rubens.\"  \"And who is Rubens?\" asked my father.  \"Oh, please, it's a dog,\" I said. \"It belongs to Mr. Mackenzie at the school. And it's such a little dear, all red and white; and it licked my face when nurse and I were there yesterday, and I put my hand in its mouth, and it rolled over on its back, and it's got long ears, and it followed me all the way home, and I gave it a piece of bread, and it can sit up, and\"--  \"But, my little man,\" interrupted my father--and he had absolutely smiled at my catalogue of marvels--\"if Rubens belongs to Mr. Mackenzie, and is such a wonderful fellow, I'm afraid Mr. Mackenzie won't part with him.\"  \"He would,\" I said, \"but--\" and I paused, for I feared the barrier was insurmountable.  \"But what?\" said my father.  \"He wants ten shillings for him, Nurse says.\"  \"If that's all, Regie,\" said my father, \"you and I will go and buy Rubens to-morrow morning.\"  Rubens was a little red and white spaniel of much beauty and sagacity. He was the prettiest, gentlest, most winning of playfellows. With him by my side, I now ran merrily about, instead of creeping moodily at the heels of nurse and her friends. Abundantly occupied in testing the tricks he knew, and teaching him new ones, I had the less leisure to listen open-mouthed to cadaverous gossip of the Cadman class. Finally, when I had bidden him good-night a hundred times, with absolutely fraternal embraces, I was soothed by the light weight of his head resting on my foot. He seemed to chase the hideous fancies which had hitherto passed from nurse's daytime conversation to trouble my night visions, as he would chase a water-fowl from a reedy marsh, and I slept--as he did--peacefully.  Nor was this all. My other wish was also to be fulfilled, but not without some vexations beforehand. It was by a certain air and tone which my nurse suddenly assumed towards me, and which it is difficult to describe by any other word than \"heighty-teighty,\" and also by dark hints of changes which she hoped (but seemed far from believing) would be for my good, and finally, by downright lamentations and tragic inquiries as to what she had done to be parted from her boy, and \"could her chickabiddy have the heart to drive away his loving and faithful nursey,\" that I learned that it was contemplated to supersede her by some one else, and that if she did not know that I was to blame in the matter, she at any rate believed me to have influence enough to obtain a reversal of the decree. That Mrs. Bundle was to be her successor I gathered from allusions to \"your great fat bouncing women that would eat their heads off; but as to cleaning out a nursery--let them see!\" But her most masterly stroke was a certain conversation with Mrs. Cadman carried on in my hearing.  \"Have you ever notice, Mrs. Cadman,\" inquired my bony nurse of her not less bony visitor--\"Have you ever notice how them stout people as looks so good-natured as if butter wouldn't melt in their mouths is that wicked and cruel underneath?\" And then followed a series of nurse's most ghastly anecdotes, relative to fat mothers who had ill-treated their children, fat nurses who had nearly been the death of their unfortunate charges, fat female murderers, and a fat acquaintance of her own, who was \"taken\" in apoplexy after a fit of rage with her husband.  \"What a warning! what a moral!\" said Mrs. Cadman. She meant it for a pious observation, but I felt that the warning and the moral were for me. And not even the presence of Rubens could dispel the darkness of my dreams that night.  Alternately goaded and caressed by my nurse, who now laid aside a habit she had of beating a tattoo with her knuckles on my head when I was naughty, to the intense confusion and irritation of my brain, I at last resolved to beg my father to let her remain with us. I felt that it was--as she had pointed out--intense ingratitude on my part to wish to part with her, and I said as much when I went down to dessert that evening. Morever, I now lived in vague fear of those terrible qualities which lay hidden beneath Mrs. Bundle's benevolent exterior.  \"If nurse has been teasing you about the matter,\" said my father, with a frown, \"that would decide me to get rid of her, if I had not so decided before. As to your not liking Mrs. Bundle now--My dear little son, you must learn to know your own mind. You told me you wanted Mrs. Bundle--by very good luck I have been able to get hold of her, and when she comes you must make the best of her.\"  She came the next day, and my bony nurse departed. She wept indignantly, I wept remorsefully, and then waited in terror for the manifestation of Mrs. Bundle's cruel propensities.  I waited in vain. The reign of"]]]
