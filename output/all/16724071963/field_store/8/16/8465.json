The same hues are given to blankets.[31]  At Cutifachiqui similar fabrics were observed:      In the barbacoas were large quantities of clothing, shawls of     thread, made from the barks of trees and others of feathers,     white gray, vermilion and yellow, rich and proper for     winter.[32]  The frequent mention of fabrics used by the Indians for shawls, mantles, etc., makes it plain that such were in very general use when the town of Pacaha was captured, and the Spaniards clothed themselves with mantles, cassocks, and gowns made from these native garments. Everywhere woven shawls were a principal feature of the propitiatory gifts of the natives to the Spaniards.  The extent of this manufacture of hempen garments by the Indians of the lower Mississippi is well indicated in the account of the adventures of the expedition on the western side of the Mississippi at Aminoga. The Spaniards undertook the construction of brigantines by means of which they hoped to descend the Mississippi and to pass along the gulf coast to Mexico. A demand was made upon the natives for shawls to be used in the manufacture of sails, and great numbers were brought. Native hemp and the ravelings of shawls were used for calking the boats.[33] What a novel sight must have been this first European fleet on the great river, consisting of five brigantines impelled by sails of native manufacture!  It is worthy of note that in this region (of the lower Mississippi) the Spaniards saw shawls of cotton, brought, it was said, from the west--probably the Pueblo country, as they were accompanied by objects that from the description may have been ornaments of turquois.[34]  The following is from Du Pratz:      Many of the women wear cloaks of the bark of the     mulberry-tree, or of the feathers of swans, turkies, or India     ducks. The bark they take from young mulberry shoots that     rise from the roots of trees that have been cut down; after     it is dried in the sun they beat it to make all the woody     part fall off, and they give the threads that remain a second     beating, after which they bleach them by exposing them to the     dew. When they are well whitened they spin them about the     coarseness of pack-thread, and weave them in the following     manner: they plant two stakes in the ground about a yard and     a half asunder, and having stretched a cord from the one to     the other, they fasten their threads of bark double to this     cord, and then interweave them in a curious manner into a     cloak of about a yard square with a wrought border round the     edges. * * * The girls at the age of eight or ten put on a     little petticoat, which is a kind of fringe made of threads     of mulberry bark.[35]  This is illustrated farther on.  The manner of weaving in the middle and upper Mississippi country is described by Hunter, who, speaking of the Osage Indians and their neighbors, says:      The hair of the buffalo and other animals is sometimes     manufactured into blankets; the hair is first twisted by     hand, and wound into balls. The warp is then laid of a length     to answer the size of the intended blanket, crossed by three     small smooth rods alternately beneath the threads, and     secured at each end to stronger rods supported on forks, at a     short distance above the ground. Thus prepared, the woof is     filled in, thread by thread, and pressed closely together, by     means of a long flattened wooden needle. When the weaving is     finished, the ends of the warp and woof are tied into knots,     and the blanket is ready for use. In the same manner they     construct mats from flags and rushes, on which, particularly     in warm weather, they sleep and sit.[36]  Fabrics of various kinds were employed in burial, although not generally made for that purpose. The wrappings of dead bodies were often very elaborate, and the consignment of these to tombs and graves where the conditions were favorable to preservation has kept them for long periods in a most perfect state. By exhumation we have obtained most of our information on this subject. Our knowledge is, however, greatly increased by descriptions of such burial customs as were witnessed in early times. Extracts already given refer to the use of fabrics in mortuary customs. Many others could be cited but the following seems sufficient:      After the dead person has lain a day and a night in one of     their hurdles of canes, commonly in some out house made for     that purpose, those that officiate about the funeral go into     the town, and the first young men they meet withal, that have     blankets or match coats on, whom they think fit for their     turn, they strip them from their backs, who suffer them so to     do without any resistance. In these they wrap the dead     bodies, and cover them with two or three mats which the     Indians make of rushes or cane; and, last of all, they have a     long web of woven reeds or hollow canes, which is the coffin     of the Indians, and is brought round several times and tied     fast at both ends, which, indeed, looks very decent and well.     Then the corps is brought out of the house into the orchard     of peach trees, where another hurdle is made to receive it,     about which comes all the relations and nation that the dead     person belonged to, besides several from other nations in     alliance with them; all which sit down on the ground upon     mats spread there for that purpose.[37]   NETS.  The manufacture and use of nets by natives in various parts of the country are recorded by early writers, some of whom have already been quoted. Speaking of the Iroquois De la Potherie says:      The old men and those who can not or do not wish to go to war     or the chase, make nets and are fishers. This is a plebian     trade among them. Their nets are made of thread of nettles or     of white wood, the bark of which they make into thread by     means of lye which renders it strong and pliable.[38]  In another place the same author says:      The Sauteurs, who are beyond the Missisakis, take their name     from a Saut (waterfall) which flows from Lake Superior into     Lake Huron by a great fall whose rapids are extremely     violent. These people are very skillful in fishery by which     they obtain white fish as large as salmons. They cross all     these terrible rapids into which they cast a net like a sack,     a little more than half an ell in width by one in depth     attached to a forked stick about 15 feet long.[39]  A novel use of nets is recorded by this author as follows:      For taking pigeons in summer in nets, they make a broad path     in the woods and attach to two trees, one on each side, a     large net made in the shape of a sack well opened.[40]  Du Pratz, speaking of the fishing nets of the Louisiana Indians, states that they \"are meshed like ours and made of lime-tree bark; the large fish are shot with arrows.\"[41]   FEATHER WORK.  Feather work was one of the most remarkable arts of the natives of Mexico and other southern countries at the period of the conquest. The feathers were sometimes woven in with the woof and sometimes applied to a network base after the fashion of embroidery. Rarely, it may be imagined, were either spun or unspun fabrics woven of feathers alone. Very pleasing specimens of ancient Peruvian feather work are recovered from graves at Ancon and elsewhere, and the method of inserting the feathers is illustrated in the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology.[42] In few instances has such work been recovered from mounds or burial places, but there can be no doubt that the mound-building tribes were experts in this art. Frequent mention is made of the feather work of the natives by the earliest explorers of the Mississippi valley, and the character of the work may be gathered from the extracts already given and from those which follow.  John Smith, speaking of the feather work of the Virginia Indians, says:      We haue seene some vse mantels made of Turky feathers, so     prettily wrought and woven with threads that nothing could be     discerned but the feathers.[43]  Lawson mentions a \"doctor\" of the Santee nation who \"was warmly and neatly clad with a match coat, made of turkies feathers, which makes a pretty show, seeming as if it was a garment of the deepest silk shag.\"[44]  In another place the same author says:      Their feather match coats are very pretty, especially some of     them, which are made extraordinary charming, containing     several pretty figures wrought in feathers, making them seem     like a fine flower silk shag; and when new and fresh, they     become a bed very well, instead of a quilt. Some of another     sort are made of hair, raccoon, bever, or squirrel skins,     which are very warm. Others again are made of the greenpart     of the skin of a mallard's head, which they sew perfectly     well together, their thread being either the sinews of a deer     divided very small, or silk grass. When these are finished,     they look very finely, though they must needs be very     troublesome to make.[45]  Du Pratz thus describes the art in Louisiana:      If the women know how to do this kind of work they make     mantles either of feathers or woven of the bark of the     mulberry tree. We will describe their method of doing this.     The feather mantles are made on a frame similar to that on     which the peruke makers work hair; they spread the feathers     in the same manner and fasten them on old fish nets or old     mantles of mulberry bark. They are placed, spread in this     manner, one over the other and on both sides; for this     purpose small turkey feathers are used; women who have     feathers of swans or India ducks, which are white, make these     feather mantles for women of high rank.[46]  Butel-Dumont describes feather"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19921"],["title","Prehistoric Textile Art of Eastern United States (#6)"],["body","of the natives of Louisiana briefly as follows:      They [the women] also, without a spinning wheel or distaff,     spin the hair or wool of cattle of which they make garters     and ribands; and with the thread which they obtain from     lime-tree bark, they make a species of mantle, which they     cover with the finest swan's feathers fastened one by one to     the material. A long task indeed, but they do not count this     trouble and time when it concerns their satisfaction.[47]   EMBROIDERY.  The use of beads, quills, and other articles to beautify the surfaces of fabrics and skins was as common, no doubt, with the ancient as with the modern native inhabitants of the Mississippi valley. In discoursing on the dress of native women of Louisiana Butel-Dumont says that the young girls wear--      * * * a sort of network attached to the waist and terminating     in a point, * * * both sides of which are ornamented with     ribbons of thread made from lime-tree fiber, also made into     network. From the waist to the knees hang several cords of     the same thread, to the ends of which are attached claws of     birds of prey, such as eaglets, crows, etc., so that when the     girls walk these make a rattling noise which is highly     pleasing to them. This kind of ornament does not illy     resemble those nets which we use to cover our horses to     protect them from flies.[48]  From Du Pratz we have the following:      The women make also designs in embroidery with the skin of     the porcupine; they remove for this purpose the skin of this     animal, which is white and black; they split it very fine to     use as embroidery thread, dye a part of the white skin a red     color, another part yellow, and a third part is left white;     they usually work on black skin, and dye the black a reddish     brown; but if they work on bark, the black [threads] remain     the same. Their designs are very similar to some of those     found in Gothic architecture; they are composed of straight     lines which form right angles at their conjunction, which is     commonly called the corner of a square. They also work     similar designs on mantles and coverings which they make with     the bark of the mulberry tree.[49]  John Smith testifies to the same practices in Virginia as shown in the following lines:      For their apparell, they are sometimes covered with the     skinnes of wilde beasts, which in Winter are dressed with the     hayre, but in Sommer without. The better sort use large     mantels of Deare skins, not much differing in fashion from     the Irish mantels. Some imbrodered with white beads, some     with Copper, other painted after their manner. * * * We haue     seene some use mantels made of Turky feathers, so prettily     wrought and woven with threads that nothing could be     discerned but the feathers.[50]     [26] Travels in North America, Peter Kalm.

Contenting myself with the preceding references to the practice of the arts of spinning and weaving in the various regions of the country, I pass on to an examination of the archeologic material which includes traces or remnants of the weaver's work from all sections of the country. As already mentioned, there are a number of ways in which textile articles or data relating to them may be preserved in such manner as to permit examination and study.  [Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY THIRTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL. II MAT OF. SPLIT CANE.]  Through charring by the use of fire in burial rites, and by contact with copper or preservative salts in burial caves, numerous pieces of cloth and parts of costumes have come into our possession. One of the most fertile sources of information has but recently been made available. The ancient potter employed woven fabrics in handling, finishing, and decorating pottery. From mounds, graves, and dwelling sites, all over the country, vases and sherds are found covered with impressions of these fabrics, and so well preserved that by taking casts in clay or wax entirely satisfactory restorations are made. Something may be learned from the recovery of implements of spinning and weaving, but up to this time the only relics secured are a few rather rude spindle whorls.  I shall present in the following paragraphs such portions of the available data as seem calculated to illustrate briefly and clearly the nature of the ancient art.   FABRICS FROM CAVES AND SHELTERS.  At an early date in the history of the country reports began to find their way into print relating to the discovery of mortuary fabrics in caverns and shelters. Extracts from some of these publications may be given.  From the writing of John Haywood historian of Tennessee, we have the following:      In the spring of the year 1811, was found in a copperas cave     in Warren county, in West Tennessee, about 15 miles southwest     from Sparta, and 20 from McMinnville, the bodies of two human     beings, which had been covered by the dirt or ore from which     copperas was made. One of these persons was a male, the other     a female. They were interred in baskets, made of cane,     curiously wrought, and evidencing great mechanic skill. They     were both dislocated at the hip joint, and were placed erect     in the baskets, with a covering made of cane to fit the     baskets in which they were placed. The flesh of these persons     was entire and undecayed, of a brown dryish colour, produced     by time, the flesh having adhered closely to the bones and     sinews. Around the female, next her body, was placed a well     dressed deer skin. Next to this was placed a rug, very     curiously wrought, of the bark of a tree and feathers. The     bark seemed to have been formed of small strands well     twisted. Around each of these strands, feathers were rolled,     and the whole woven into a cloth of firm texture, after the     manner of our common coarse fabrics. This rug was about three     feet wide, and between six and seven feet in length. The     whole of the ligaments thus framed of bark were completely     covered with feathers, forming a body of about one eighth of     an inch in thickness, the feathers extending about one     quarter of an inch in length from the strand to which they     were confined. The appearance was highly diversified by     green, blue, yellow and black, presenting different shades of     colour when reflected upon by the light in different     positions. The next covering was an undressed deer skin,     around which was rolled, in good order, a plain shroud     manufactured after the same order as the one ornamented with     feathers. This article resembled very much in its texture the     bags generally used for the purpose of holding coffee     exported from Havanna to the United States. The female had in     her hand a fan formed of the tail feathers of a turkey. The     points of these feathers were curiously bound by a buckskin     string, well dressed, and were thus closely bound for about     one inch from the points. About three inches from the point     they were again bound, by another deer skin string, in such a     manner that the fan might be closed and expanded at pleasure.     * * *      The cave in which they were found, abounded in nitre,     copperas, alum, and salts. The whole of this covering, with     the baskets, was perfectly sound, without any marks of     decay.[51]      There was also a scoop net made of bark thread; a mockasin     made of the like materials; a mat of the same materials,     enveloping human bones, were found in saltpetre dirt, six     feet below the surface. The net and other things mouldered on     being exposed to the sun.[52]  In the year 1815 a remarkably interesting set of mortuary fabrics was recovered from a saltpeter cave near Glasgow, Kentucky. A letter from Samuel L. Mitchell, published by the American Antiquarian Society, contains the following description of the condition of the human remains and of the nature of its coverings:      The outer envelope of the body is a deer skin, probably dried     in the usual way, and perhaps softened before its     application, by rubbing. The next covering is a deer skin,     whose hair had been cut away by a sharp instrument,     resembling a hatter's knife. The remnant of the hair,"]]]
