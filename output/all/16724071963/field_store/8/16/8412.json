It's only seven or eight miles.\"  \"Hit 'er up, Chip,\" cried the red-headed chap; \"you won't find me taking any of your dust.\"  Once more they got their machines in motion along the trail. The going was none too good, and Merry got his machine going at a pace that might have been reckless had not the brilliant, far-flung rays of the searchlight laid the way so clearly before his eyes.  \"That the best you can do?\" called Clancy, whirring along at his chum's side.  \"This will do,\" Frank answered. \"We're not on a boulevard, remember.\"  Clancy gave a laugh of sheer exhilaration, for the thrill of that wild dash through the night and across the desert was in his veins.  \"We'll be running Porter down before we can see him, Chip,\" he called, the wind of their flight casting his words behind him in splintering echoes.  But Merriwell had no fear of that. If Nick Porter had ridden hard, he would already have had time to cover the distance between the mine and McGurvin's.  McGurvin's ranch was the last place, short of Happenchance in the Picket Post Mountains, where water could be secured. Surely, if Porter had come that way, he would stop at the ranch. He had left the mine too hurriedly to equip himself with water canteens and rations for a prolonged stay in the desert. Frank's hopes were mounting high as the motor cycles devoured the distance that separated their riders front McGurvin's.  At last, in fifteen or twenty minutes--certainly less than half an hour--the mad pace was slowed as the destination hove duskily into sight. A yellow gleam showed at one of the windows of the ranch house, and suggested that the proprietor might be entertaining a caller.  The machines were halted at a little distance from the dwelling, and Merry stole forward to reconnoiter, ere announcing himself in person to McGurvin. There was no curtain at the window through which shone the lamp-light, and the lad crept up to it and looked into the room. Only one man was visible, and that was the ranch owner himself. He sat by a table, reading.  \"I guess we're off the track, Roper,\" said Frank, rejoining Clancy. \"I can't see any one but McGurvin through the window, and he's spelling out the news in a paper. If Porter was there, he and McGurvin would certainly be together.\"  \"Not so certainly, Chip.\" answered Chancy. \"Let's look in the corral for a tired horse. If we find one, then surely it's Porter's, and Porter has got into the house and gone to bed.\"  Only one horse and a burro were found, and the horse showed no evidence of recent hard riding. Frank was deeply puzzled.  \"If the prospector came this way,\" said he, \"there would be nothing else for it but for him to stop here. He wouldn't dare go on into the desert without foot and water.\"  \"Possibly he stopped, got what he wanted, and went on,\" Clancy hazarded.  \"No, Clan. We can't be much more than half an hour from the mine; if we suppose that Porter had a full hour the start of us--it couldn't have been more than that--then he had only an hour and a half to ride here, and no time to pick up food and water and push his tired horse on into the desert. We'd better go back to Loco's and take the fork to Gold Hill.\"  \"Let's not be in a rush, Chip. Now that we're here, we'd better find out what McGurvin has got to say.\"  \"Of course,\" Frank returned, \"we'll have a word or two with the rancher before we turn back.\"  The rancher was not surprised to have visitors drop in on him at that hour. The better part of his income was derived from the sale of water, brought up from his well by burro power, to prospectors and others who happened along that way. Such customers were liable to straggle in from any quarter at any hour.  \"'Pears mighty like I've seen you fellers some place before,\" said the rancher, staring hard at the boys. \"Say,\" and his face cleared, \"wasn't you along this way a few days ago with Barzy Blunt an' some more, runnin' some fool race or other.\"  He referred to the \"relay Marathon,\" which Frank and his chums had run against Blunt and his cowboy friends, to file in Gold Hill a location notice of Borrodaile's claim.  \"Yes,\" smiled Frank, \"we're the fellows.\"  \"Well, sufferin' Mike!\" guffawed McGurvin. \"Sot down an' be sociable, can't ye?\"  \"We're in something of a hurry, McGurvin,\" Frank went on, \"and can't stop long. Do you know a prospector named Porter?\"  McGurvin's face went blank, and he dug his fingers into his tousled hair.  \"Not Andy Porter, from up Phoenix way?\" he asked. \"Squints with his off eye, and walks with a limp?\"  \"No,\" Frank answered, \"this man is a big fellow, whiskers, ropy hair, gray eyes.\"  \"New one on me,\" said McGurvin.  \"Then, you haven't seen anything of him?\"  \"Nary a thing. What's he done? Stole a hoss?\"  \"We don't know what he has done, McGurvin. All we want is to have a talk with him. Can you spare us a couple of canteens, full of water, and a bag of rations--enough for two or three meals?\"  \"Shore,\" answered the rancher, \"that's what I'm here fer. Dollar fer the water in the canteens, an' two dollars fer the canteens; then another two dollars fer the hand-out. Makes five, don't it?\"  McGurvin had the reputation of being more or less of a robber. Having a monopoly of the water in that locality, he set his own prices, and did not fear competition.  \"Five dollars is all right, McGurvin,\" said Frank.  \"Blunt was out this way this afternoon, with a couple his pards,\" remarked McGurvin, unaware of the bomb was exploding. \"They watered up, rested a spell, an' hiked on to the Picket Posts.\"  Merry was startled, but contrived not to show it. Clancy jumped, but his chum gave him a warning glance.  \"Hustle around and get those supplies for us, please,\" urged Frank. \"We're in a hurry.\"  \"Hosses to water?\" queried the rancher, starting for a rear door.  \"No horses, McGurvin.  \"Ottermobile, I reckon,\" deplored McCurvin. \"If them things git too thick in the desert they'll be the ruination of me. I'll have yore stuff ready in ten minutes.\"  He went out through the door, Clancy leaped excitedly toward Merriwell.  \"What's on your mind now, Chip?\" he whispered. \"Why the grub and water?\"  \"I made up my mind, all of a sudden, to extend this of ours to Happenchance.\"  \"You're crazy!\" gasped Clancy. \"How can we find the way? It would be hard enough in broad daylight, but at night we'd get all twisted up, and end by losing ourselves in the foothills. If we're going to Happenchance, Chip, we'd better camp right here until morning, then cross the rough country when we can see what we're about.\"  \"I had made up my mind to go on to-night,\" Merry answered, \"even before McGurvin told us that about Barzy Blunt.\"  \"Gee, but that was a bombshell! What do you suppose Blunt is doing out this way?\"  \"It's possible he may know something about the professor. Why did he go on to the Picket Posts? What business has Barzy Blunt got around the old camp of Happenchance, where the professor's claim is located? Before McGurvin told us Blunt had gone in that direction, I had made up my mind that we ought to take a look at the deserted town; now that I know Blunt is there. I am more anxious than ever to get to the place.\"  \"But what about Porter?\"  \"Where he has gone is a mystery,\" said Merriwell, \"but I think Blunt and his cowboy friends offer a more promising clew to the prof's whereabouts. We'll forget about Porter for the present, and give our attention to Blunt.\"  They talked in whispers for a short time longer, and then sat back suddenly in their chairs as McGurvin came into the room with two filled canteens and a small canvas bag of rations.  Merry exchanged five silver dollars for the supplies, and then the rancher followed the boys out and watched them while they started their machines.  \"A couple o' gasoline go-devils, by thunder!\" muttered McGurvin. \"All kinds o' ways o' beatin' a man that sells water out o' his rights. If ye didn't have them contraptions, ye'd be shackin' along on a couple o' bronks, an my well 'u'd bring me in two bits a head fer each of 'em.\"  The rancher was still sputtering as the boys raced off through the starlight, heading into the desert. As soon as they were well away. McGurvin's wrath died in his throat, and he gave vent to a husky chuckle.  \"On ter Happenchance, or I'm a Piute!\" he muttered jubilantly. \"Go it, you crazy galoots--but I 'opine ye won't find what ye're a-lookin' fer.\"  Still chuckling, he turned back into the house and pounded on a stovepipe that ran through the ceiling and into a room overhead.  \"Have they gone, McGurvin?\" came a muffled voice from above.  \"I reckon they have, Nick,\" laughed the rancher; \"they went pippity-poppin' away, each of 'em on a couple o' wheels run by gasoline.\"  \"Where'd they go?\"  \"Happenchance, I reckon. Leastways, they headed inter the desert, p'intin' thataway.\"  A satisfied grunt echoed from above.  \"Lucky I hitched yore bronk out in the scrub,\" went on McGurvin complacently. \"I'll bet a-plenty them kids was nosin' around afore they come in here. But they didn't find nothin', nary, they didn't.\"  _\"Buenas noches_, Mac,\" called down the man upstairs, \"I'm turnin' in.\"  The words were followed by a faint echo of hoarse laughter. McGurvin caught up the sound with some heartiness as he locked the door, blew out the light, and went groping through the dark for his own bed.    CHAPTER VI.  A STARTLING DISCOVERY.  The entrance of Barzy Blunt into that mystifying tangle had been as sudden as it was unexpected. And yet, knowing Blunt as he did, Merry wondered that he had not thought of the fellow before.  Blunt was a young cow-puncher, who boasted of being a \"homemade\" athlete, and would take a back seat for nobody, least of all young Merriwell. He was not exactly \"cracked\" on the subject of his prowess in athletic sports, but his views were certainly warped. Obsessed with the idea that it was his duty to take Merriwell down a peg. Blunt was continually, and in the most weird and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19867"],["title","Frank Merriwell, Junior's, Golden Trail; Or, The Fugitive Professor (#6)"],["body","ways, contriving to force Merry into tests of strength and skill.  Merry had shown Blunt his heels in a hundred-yard dash, and at least once had put him on his back in a catch-as-catch-can wrestling bout. It was at Blunt's suggestion that the relay Marathon was run, with the professor's claim as the prize: and it was by a plot of Blunt's that Merry had been lured to the Bar Z Ranch, where, as Blunt had planned. Merry pitched against the cowboy in a baseball game. Frank and his chums had won the relay Marathon and Frank had pitched his cowboy team to victory. Yet Blunt still refused to be satisfied.  The \"Cowboy Wonder,\" as Blunt called himself, had been reared by a man who had implanted in his growing mind a vast array of false notions. By these, the Wonder regulated his conduct, with a result that was ludicrous at times, and at other times almost tragic.  There was something about the queer fellow that young Merriwell liked. And yet, while he sympathized with Blunt to a certain extent, he was forced to condemn his rashness and dare-devil behavior.  \"Clan.\" said Merry, as he and his chums moved on into the trackless desert, \"while I sat in McGurvin's adobe it flashed over me, all at once, that we had forgotten something about Professor Borrodaile which might possibly explain his absence.\"  \"What was that?\"  \"Why, you remember how we left Happenchance in such a hurry, the time we went to the place and found the prof?\"  \"We were chased out by Blunt and his puncher friends.\"  \"Not exactly. We were hurrying out ahead of them in order to reach the automobile and beat Blunt to Gold Hill with the professor's location notice. Well we were in such a rush that Professor Borrodaile had to leave his luggage behind. Now, wouldn't it be the natural thing to suppose that the prof returned to Happenchance after his goods and chattels?\"  \"Holy mackerel!\" exclaimed Clancy. \"You've nicked it, Chip! That's just what the harmless old fossil has done. He wanted his trunk, and he slipped out of Gold Hill and went after it. We're thick, all right. It's a wonder that some of us didn't think of that earlier in the game. I shouldn't be surprised if we found the prof back in his old place in the only house left in Happenchance!\"  \"It's possible,\" said Merry. \"Anyhow, that's the idea that flashed through my mind as I sat talking with McGurvin. And that's the reason I contracted for the canteens, the water, and the rations. Then, when McGurvin said what he did about Blunt, I was more anxious than ever to keep on to Happenchance.\"  \"What do you think Blunt has got up his sleeve this time?\"  \"He's so full of wild ideas that there's no telling. If the professor is in Happenchance, then Blunt has some reason for following him there.\"  \"And out of it all, Chip.\" declared Clancy, \"there's going to come a contest of some sort between you and Blunt. The fellow's crazy on the subject of getting the better of you in some feat of strength and skill. Can't he ever be satisfied?\"  \"Seems not,\" Frank answered. \"Sometimes I have a hunch that I ought to hang back and let Blunt make a winning. If that's what he wants, why not humor him?\"  \"Not on your life!\" protested Clancy promptly. \"You've got to meet Blunt at every point, and trim him well. I think he's 'yellow,' anyhow.\"  \"You and I will never agree on that,\" said Merry. \"There's good stuff in Barzy Blunt, and some day he's going to see the error of his way, and reform. When that happens, you'll find he has the making of an all-round star athlete.\"  Clancy muttered something under his breath. Whatever it was it certainty was not creditable to the Cowboy Wonder.  \"We're getting into the hills,\" observed Clancy, shifting the subject, \"and now, if we don't get lost, it will be because your bump of location is a lot better than mine.\"  Merry had the habit, at all times, of keen and careful observation, he had made but one trip to the old camp of Happenchance, but circumstances, at that time, had conspired to fix the route to it firmly in his mind. He had gone to the lost town of the Picket Posts in the Bradlaugh car, guided by Nick Porter, but he had ridden back to McGurvin's on a horse, accompanying the runners in the first lap of the relay race. So he had been able to use his faculty of observation to some purpose.  Could he follow the course by night, with the mountains a constant guide by day, all but blotted out in the starlight? He believed he could; and now the test of his confidence was at hand.  His keen eyes watched the ground as it ruffled into low foothills. Although he laid a zigzag course as his searchlight brought cactus clumps and thorn bushes into view, in the main he succeeded in dodging obstacles, and yet held to a fairly direct route. A mound of rocks, stark and almost shapeless in the gloom, guided him like a fingerboard; or a flat-topped hill, or a peculiar-shaped valley between two uplifts, set him on the right track. Mile by mile the black mountains came closer, and then Clancy himself began to pick up a landmark or two which he recognized.  \"Chip,\" he cried, \"you're a wonder! Unless I'm badly mistaken, we just passed the valley where we left the car when Porter led you, and Ballard, and I into the gap that cuts through the mountain wall to Happenchance.\"  \"That was the valley, Clan,\" replied Merriwell, \"and there's nothing very wonderful about getting back to it, either. It's just a matter of minding your P's and Q's, and remembering a thing or two. We couldn't take the car through the gap, but I believe we can make it with these machines. We'll go around the hills instead of over them.\"  Then began a sinuous weaving back and forth, following the seams in the uplifts and mounting steadily toward the narrow gap. The pace was slow and labored, but Frank unerringly traced the way until the motor-cyle lamps flung their round, yellow eyes squarely into the fissure of the mountain wall.  \"Maybe there isn't anything wonderful about this,\" called Clancy, as Frank led the way into the narrow passage, \"but--well, it gets my goat. Poor old Pink is missing the time of his life. Now, if we can find Borrodaile, and jog him into a realization of where he is and what he has done, we'll just about make a good night's work of it. It's a relief to know that the prof hasn't been in danger of being bunkoed out of his gold mine.\"  \"We don't know that yet,\" Frank called back over his shoulder. \"Don't take too much for granted, Red. This move on Happenchance may be putting us clear off the scent.\"  \"I'll bet something it isn't,\" said Clancy, with supreme conviction.  Emerging from the pass, the boys descended into a circular valley, in whose center shapeless ruins covered all the old-time glories--such as they were--of a once bustling mining camp.  The searchlights pierced the vast heap of debris, and revealed the cluttered lane which had once been the town's main street. Carefully Frank steered through the passage and came at last to a halt in front of the only four walls in the place that remained standing. Here was the building in which they had discovered Professor Phineas Borrodaile, living alone in primitive surroundings and trying to imagine him self a troglodyte.  \"Hello, professor!\" shouted Clancy.  His voice echoed back and forth between the cliffs that rimmed the valley, but brought no answer.  \"Not here!\" he exclaimed, in a voice of profound disappointment.  \"You really expected that yell would bring him?\" Frank asked.  \"I really did. Hang the luck! Say, Chip, I guess the theory won't hold water. The prof is still mysteriously absent, after all.\"  Merry had removed the lamp from his machine, and was standing in front of the old door. It was swinging by one rusty hinge, and he pushed it wide open.  \"Look out for snakes, Chip!\" warned Clancy.  Cautiously the boys pushed through the doorway and into the room that lay beyond. They looked around them, as Merry flashed the beam of light over the ruinous walls. Instinctively a gasp of surprise escaped them.  A cot had once stood at the side of the room, and there had been an oil stove in the place, and a shelf with some books, a chair, a trunk, and a few other odds and ends of primitive housekeeping. But now there was nothing. Every object had been cleaned out of the place and only the bare walls remained.  \"Professor Borrodaile isn't here, Clan,\" said young Merriwell presently. \"But he has been here, and made off with his plunder, that's plain. The question is where is the professor now?\"  It was a startling discovery the boys had made; not in itself alone, but in the question to which it had given rise.    CHAPTER VII.  WHEN DREAMS COME TRUE.  Merry sat down on a chunk of adobe which had fallen out of the wall. Placing the lamp in the niche left by the chunk in its fall, he hooked up a knee between his hands, and grew thoughtful. Clancy found a seat for himself, and waited for the result of his chum's reflections. He waited so long that he became impatient.  \"What's at the back of your head, Chip?\" he asked. \"There isn't a thing at the back of mine.\"  Frank dropped his knee, and looked at his watch.  \"It's one o'clock in the morning,\" said he. \"Let's have lunch.\"  \"An ounce of grub is worth a pound of theory any old time,\" said the red-headed fellow cheerfully. \"I'll lug in the canteens and the chuck bag.\"  He went out and returned with them, and he and Frank got busy with some sardine sandwiches, crackers, and cheese which McGurvin had provided for a \"hand-out.\" The water in the canteens was refreshing, and likewise the fare, rough though it was.  \"In the first place, Clan,\" reasoned Merry, \"we've got to consider that it isn't exactly a cinch that Borrodaile has been here. It's probable, but not absolutely certain. Some desert Arab may have raided the place and carted away his stuff.\"  \"Not likely,\" returned Clancy, swallowing a mouthful of sandwich. As he was about to take another bite, he had a thought that caused him to look up quickly."]]]
