That depressed and aimless wandering about which always afflicts the dogs of the household when any of the family are going away from home was strong upon him. After the new trunk came into my room, Rubens took into his head a fancy for lying upon it; and though the brass nails must have been very uncomfortable, and though my bed was always free to him, on the box he was determined to be, and on the box he lay for hours together.  It was on the box that I found him, in the portico, despite the cords which now added a fresh discomfort to his self-chosen resting-place. I called to him, but though he wagged his tail he seemed disinclined to move, and lay curled up with one eye shut and one fixed on the carriage at the door.  \"He's been trying to get into the carriage, sir,\" said the butler.  \"You want to go too, poor Ruby, don't you?\" I said; and I went in search of meats to console him.  He accepted a good breakfast from my hands with gratitude, and then curled himself up with one eye watchful as before. The reason of his proceedings was finally made evident by his determined struggles to accompany us at the last; and it was not till he had been forcibly shut up in the coach-house that we were able to start. My grief at parting with him was lessened by the distraction of another question.  Of all places about our equipage, I should have preferred riding with the postilion. Short of that, I was most anxious to sit behind in the rumble with my nurse. This favour was at length conceded, and after a long farewell from my father, gilded with a sovereign in my pocket, I was, with a mountain of wraps, consigned to the care of Nurse Bundle in the back seat.  The dew was still on the ground, the birds sang their loudest, the morning air was fresh and delicious, and before we had driven five miles on our way I could have eaten three such breakfasts as the one I had rejected at six o'clock. In the first two villages through which we drove people seemed to be only just getting up and beginning the day's business. In one or two \"genteel\" houses the blinds were still down; in reference to which I resolved that when _I_ grew up I would not waste the best part of the day in bed, with the sun shining, the birds singing, the flowers opening, and country people going about their business, all beyond my closed windows.  \"Nurse, please, I should like always to have breakfast at six o'clock. Do you hear, Nursey?\" I added, for Mrs. Bundle feigned to be absorbed in contemplating a flock of sheep which were being driven past us.  \"Very well, my dear. We'll see.\"  That \"we'll see\" of Nurse Bundle's was a sort of moral soothing-syrup which she kept to allay inconvenient curiosity and over-pertinacious projects in the nursery.  I had soon reason to decide that if I had breakfast at six, luncheon would not be unacceptable at half-past ten, at about which time I lost sight of the scenery and confined my attention to a worsted workbag in which Nurse Bundle had a store of most acceptable buns. Halting shortly after this to water the horses, a glass of milk was got for me from a wayside inn, over the door of which hung a small gate, on whose bars the following legend was painted:--      \"This gate hangs well     And hinders none.     Refresh and pay,     And travel on.\"  \"Did you put that up?\" I inquired of the man who brought my milk.  \"No, sir. It's been there long enough,\" was his reply.  \"What does 'hinders none' mean?\" I asked.  The man looked back, and considered the question.  \"It means as it's not in the way of nothing. It don't hinder nobody,\" he replied at last.  \"It couldn't if it wanted to,\" said I; \"for it doesn't reach across the road. If it did, I suppose it would be a tollbar.\"  \"He's a rum little chap, that!\" said the waiter to Nurse Bundle, when he had taken back my empty glass. And he unmistakably nodded at me.  \"What is a rum little chap, Nurse?\" I inquired when we had fairly started once more.  \"It's very low language,\" said Mrs. Bundle, indignantly; and this fact depressed me for several miles.  At about half-past eleven we rattled into Farnham, and stopped to lunch at \"The Bush.\" I was delighted to get down from my perch, and to stretch my cramped legs by running about in the charming garden behind that celebrated inn. Dim bright memories are with me still of the long-windowed parlour opening into a garden verdant with grass, and stately yew hedges, and formal clipped trees; gay, too, with bright flowers, and mysterious with a walk winding under an arch of the yew hedge to the more distant bowling-green. On one side of this arch an admirably-carved stone figure in broadcoat and ruffles played perpetually upon a stone fiddle to an equally spirited shepherdess in hoop and high heels, who was for ever posed in dancing posture upon her pedestal and never danced away. As I wandered round the garden whilst luncheon was being prepared, I was greatly taken with these figures, and wondered if it might be that they were an enchanted prince and princess turned to stone by some wicked witch, envious of their happiness in the peaceful garden amid the green alleys and fragrant flowers. As I ate my luncheon I felt as if I were consuming what was their property, and pondered the supposition that some day the spell might be broken, and the stone-bound couple came down from those high pedestals, and go dancing and fiddling into the Farnham streets.  They showed no symptoms of moving whilst we remained, and, duly refreshed, we now proceeded on our way. I rejected the offer of a seat inside the carriage with scorn, and Nurse and I clambered back to our perch. No easy matter for either of us, by the way!--Nurse Bundle being so much too large, and I so much too small, to compass the feat with anything approaching to ease.  I was greatly pleased with the dreary beauties of Bagshot Heath, and Nurse Bundle (to whom the whole journey was familiar) enlivened this part of our way by such anecdotes of Dick Turpin, the celebrated highwayman, as she deemed suitable for my amusement. With what interest I gazed at the little house by the roadside where Turpin was wont to lodge, and where, arriving late one night, he demanded beef-steak for supper in terms so peremptory that, there being none in the house, the old woman who acted as his housekeeper was obliged to walk, then and there, to the nearest town to procure it! This and various other incidents of the robber's career I learned from Nurse Bundle, who told me that traditions of his exploits and character were still fresh in the neighbouring villages.  At Virginia Water we dined and changed horses. We stayed here longer than was necessary, that I might see the lake and the ship; and Uncle Ascott gave sixpence to an old man with a wooden leg who told us all about it. And still I declined an inside place, and went back with Nurse Bundle to the rumble. Early rising and the long drive began to make me sleepy. The tame beauties of the valley of the Thames drew little attention from my weary eyes; and I do not remember much about the place where we next halted, except that the tea tasted of hay, and that the bread and butter were good.  I gazed dreamily at Hounslow, despite fresh tales of Dick Turpin; and all the successive \"jogs\" by which Nurse called my incapable attention to the lamplighters, the shops, the bottles in the chemists' windows, and Hyde Park, failed to rouse me to any intelligent appreciation of the great city, now that I had reached it. After a long weary dream of rattle and bustle, and dim lamps, and houses stretching upwards like Jack's beanstalk through the chilly and foggy darkness, the carriage stopped with one final jolt in a quiet and partially-lighted square; and I was lifted down, and staggered into a house where the light was as abundant and overpowering as it was feeble and inefficient without, and, cramped in my limbs, and smothered with shawls, I could only beg in my utter weariness to be put to bed.  Aunt Maria was always sensible, and generally kind.  \"Bring him at once to his room, Mrs. Bundle,\" she said, \"and get his clothes off, and I will bring him some hot wine and water and a few rusks.\" As in a dream, I was undressed, my face and hands washed, my prayers said in a somewhat perfunctory fashion, and my evening hymn commuted in consideration of my fatigues for the beautiful verse, \"I will lay me down in peace, and take my rest,\" etc.; and by the time that I sank luxuriously between the clean sheets, I was almost sufficiently restored to appreciate the dainty appearance of my room. Then Aunt Maria brought me the hot wine and water flavoured with sleep-giving cloves, and Nurse folded my clothes, and tucked me up, and left me, with the friendly reflection of the lamps without to keep me company.  I do not think I had really been to sleep, but I believe I was dozing, when I fancied that I heard the familiar sound of Rubens lapping water from the toilette jug in my room at home. Just conscious that I was not there, and that Rubens could not be here, the sound began to trouble me. At first I was too sleepy to care to look round. Then as I became more awake and the sound not less distinct, I felt fidgety and frightened, and at last called faintly for Nurse Bundle.  Then the sound stopped. I could hardly breathe, and had just resolved upon making a brave sally for assistance, when--plump! _something_ alighted on my bed, and, wildly impossible as it seemed, Rubens himself waggled up to my pillow, and began licking my face as if his life depended on laying my nose and all other projecting parts of my countenance flat with my cheeks.  How he had got to London we never knew. As he made an easy escape from the coach-house at Dacrefield, it was always supposed that he simply followed the carriage, and had the wit to hide himself when we stopped on the road. He was terribly tired. He might well be thirsty!  I levied large contributions on the box"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19859"],["title","A Flat Iron for a Farthing; or, Some Passages in the Life of an only Son (#5)"],["body"," rusks which Aunt Maria had left by my bedside, for his benefit, and he supped well.  Then he curled himself up in his own proper place at my feet. He was intensely self-satisfied, and expressed his high idea of his own exploit by self-gratulatory \"grumphs,\" as after describing many mystic circles, and scraping up the fair Marseilles quilt on some plan of his own, he brought his nose and tail together in a satisfactory position in his nest, and we passed our first night in London in dreamless and profound sleep.     CHAPTER V  MY COUSINS--MISS BLOMFIELD--THE BOY IN BLACK   My first letter to my father was the work of several days, and as my penmanship was not of a rapid order, it cost me a good deal of trouble. When it was finished it ran thus:  MY DEAR PAPA,       I hope you are quite well. i am quite well. Rubens is here      and he is quite well. We dont no how he got here but i am      verry glad. Ant Maria said well he cant be sent back now so      he sleeps on my bed and i like London it is a kweer place      the houses are very big and i like my cussens pretty well      they are all gals their nozes are very big i like Polly.  Nurse is quite well so good-bye.  i am your very loving son,  REGINALD DACRE.  Though I cannot defend the spelling of the above document, I must say that it does not leave much to be added to the portrait of my cousins. But it will be more polite to introduce them separately, as they were presented to me.  I heard them, by the bye, before I saw them. It was whilst I was dressing, the morning after my arrival, that I heard sounds in the room below, which were interpreted by Nurse as being \"Miss Maria doing her music.\" The peculiarity of Miss Maria's music was that after a scramble over the notes, suggestive of some one running to get impetus for a jump, and when the ear waited impatiently for the consummation, Miss Maria baulked her leap, so to speak, and got no farther, and began the scramble again, and stuck once more, and so on. And as, whilst finding the running passage quite too much for one hand, she struggled on with a different phrase in the other hand at the same time, instead of practising the two hands separately, her chances of final success seemed remote indeed. Then I heard the performance in peculiar circumstances. Nurse Bundle had opened my window, and about two minutes after my cousin commenced her practice, an organ-grinder in the street below began his. The subject of poor Maria's piece knew no completion, as she stuck halfway; but the organ-grinder's melodies only stopped for a touch to the mechanism, and Black-Eyed Susan passed into the Old Hundredth, awkwardly, but with hardly a perceptible pause. The effect of the joint performance was at first ludicrous, and by degrees maddening, especially when we had come to the Old Hundredth, which was so familiar in connection with the words of the Psalm.  \"Three and four and--\" began poor Maria afresh, with desperate resolution; and then off she went up the key-board; \"one and two and three and four and, one and two and three and four and--\"  \"--joy--His--courts--un--to,\" ground the organ in the inevitable pause. And then my cousin took courage and made another start--\"Three and four and one and two and,\" etc.; but at the old place the nasal notes of the other instrument evoked \"al--ways,\" from my memory; and Maria pausing in despair, the Old Hundredth finished triumphantly, \"For--it--is--seemly--so--to--do.\"  At half-past eight Maria stopped abruptly in the middle of her run, and Nurse took me down to the school-room for breakfast.  The school-room was high and narrow, with a very old carpet, and a very old piano, some books, two globes, and a good deal of feminine rubbish in the way of old work-baskets, unfinished sewing, etc. There were two long windows, the lower halves of which were covered with paint. This mattered the less as the only view from them was of backyards, roofs, and chimneys. Living as I did, so much alone with my father, I was at first oppressed by the number of petticoats in the room--five girls of ages ranging from twelve to six, and a grown-up lady in a spare brown stuff dress and spectacles.  As we entered she came quickly forward and shook Nurse by the hand.  \"How do you do, Mrs. Bundle? Very glad to see you again, Mrs. Bundle.\"  Nurse Bundle shook hands first, and curtsied afterwards.  \"I'm very well, thank you, ma'am, and hope you're the same. Master Reginald Dacre, ma'am. This lady is Miss Blomfield, Master Reginald; and I hope you'll behave properly, and give the lady no trouble.\"  \"I'm the governess, my dear,\" said Miss Blomfield, emphatically. (She always \"made a point\" of announcing her dependent position to strangers. \"It is best to avoid any awkwardness,\" she was wont to say; and I saw glances and smiles exchanged on this occasion between the girls.) Miss Blomfield was very kind to me. Indeed she was kind to every one. Her other peculiarities were conscientiousness and the fidgets, and tendencies to fine crochet, calomel, and Calvinism, and an abiding quality of harassing and being harassed, which I may here say is, I am convinced, a common and most unfortunate atmosphere of much of the process of education for girls of the upper and middle classes in England.  At this moment my aunt came in.  \"Good morning, Miss Blomfield.\"  \"Good morning, Mrs. Ascott,\" the governess hastily interposed. \"I hope you're well this morning.\"  \"Good morning, girls. Good morning, Nurse. How do you, Regie? All right this morning? Bless me, there's that dog! What an extraordinary affair it is! Mr. Ascott says he shall send it to the 'Gentleman's Magazine.' Well, he can't be sent back now, so I suppose he'll have to stop. And you must keep him out of mischief, Regie. Remember, he's not to come into the drawing-room. Mrs. Bundle, will you see to that? Miss Blomfield, will you kindly speak to Signor Rigi when he comes to-morrow--\"  \"Certainly, Mrs. Ascott,\" interposed the governess.  \"--about that piece of Maria's? She doesn't seem to get on with it a bit.\"  \"No, Mrs. Ascott.\"  \"And I'm sure she's been practising it for a long time.\"  \"Yes, Mrs. Ascott.\"  [Illustration: \"Bless me, there's that dog!\"]  \"Mr. Ascott says it makes his hand quite unsteady when he's shaving in the morning, to hear her always break off at one place.\"  The lines of harass on Miss Blomfield's countenance deepened visibly, and her crochet-needle trembled in her hand, whilst a despondent stolidity settled on Maria's face.  \"Certainly, Mrs. Ascott. I'm very glad you've spoken. Thank you for mentioning it, Mrs. Ascott. It has distressed me very greatly, and been a great trouble on my mind for some time. I spoke very seriously to Maria last Sabbath on the subject\" (symptoms of sniffling on poor Maria's part). \"I believe she wishes to do her duty, and I may say I am anxious to do mine, in my position. Of course, Mrs. Ascott, I know you've a right to expect an improvement, and I shall be most happy to rise half an hour earlier, so as to give her a longer practice than the other young ladies, and only consider it my duty as your governess, Mrs. Ascott. I've felt it a great trouble, for I cannot imagine how it is that Maria does not improve in her music as Jane does, and I give them equal attention exactly; and what makes it more singular still is that Maria is very good at her sums--I have no fault to find whatever. But I regret to say it is not the case with Jane. I told her on Wednesday that I did not wish to make any complaint; but I feel it a duty, Mrs. Ascott, to let you know that her marks for arithmetic are not what you have a right to expect.\"  Here Miss Blomfield paused and wiped her eyes. Not that she was weeping, but over and above her short-sightedness she was troubled with a dimness of vision, which afflicted her more at some times than others. As she was in the habit of endeavouring to counteract the evils of a too constantly laborious and sedentary life, and of an anxious and desponding temperament, by large doses of calomel, her malady increased with painfully rapid strides. On this particular morning she had been busy since five o'clock, and neither she nor the girls (who rose at six) had had anything to eat, and they were all somewhat faint for want of a breakfast which was cooling on the table. Meanwhile a \"humming in the head,\" to which _she_ was subject, rendered Maria mercifully indifferent to the proposal to add an extra half-hour to her distasteful labours; and Miss Blomfield corrugated her eyebrows, and was conscientiously distressed and really puzzled that Mother Nature should give different gifts to her children, when their mother and teachers according to the flesh were so particular to afford them an equality of \"advantages.\"  \"Signor Rigi told me that Maria has not got so good an ear as Jane,\" said Mrs. Ascott. \"However, perhaps it will be well to let Maria practise half an hour, and Jane do half an hour at her arithmetic on Saturday afternoons.\"  \"Certainly, Mrs. Ascott.\"  \"And now,\" said my aunt, \"I must introduce the girls to Reginald. This is Maria, your eldest cousin, and nearly double your age, for she is twelve. This is Jane, two years younger. This is Helen; she is nine, and as tall as Jane, you see. This is Harriet, eight. And this is Mary--Polly, as papa calls her--and she is nineteen months younger than you, and a terrible tomboy already; so don't make her worse. This is your cousin, girls, Reginald Dacre. You must amuse him among you, and don't tease him, for he is not used to children.\"  We \"shook hands\" all round, and I liked Polly's hand the best. It was least froggy, cold, and spiritless.  Then Mrs. Ascott departed, and Maria (overpowered by the humming) \"flopped\" into her chair after a fashion that would certainly have drawn a rebuke from Miss Blomfield if an access of eye-dimness had not carried her to her own seat with little more grace.  Uncle Ascott had a large nose, and my cousins were the"]]]
