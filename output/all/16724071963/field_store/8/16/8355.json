(from \"The Road To Tycho\", a collection of articles about the antecedents of the Lunarian Revolution, published in Luna City in 2096)  For Dan Halbert, the road to Tycho began in college--when Lissa Lenz asked to borrow his computer. Hers had broken down, and unless she could borrow another, she would fail her midterm project. There was no one she dared ask, except Dan.  This put Dan in a dilemma. He had to help her--but if he lent her his computer, she might read his books. Aside from the fact that you could go to prison for many years for letting someone else read your books, the very idea shocked him at first. Like everyone, he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong--something that only pirates would do.  And there wasn't much chance that the SPA--the Software Protection Authority--would fail to catch him. In his software class, Dan had learned that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and where it was read, and by whom, to Central Licensing. (They used this information to catch reading pirates, but also to sell personal interest profiles to retailers.) The next time his computer was networked, Central Licensing would find out. He, as computer owner, would receive the harshest punishment--for not taking pains to prevent the crime.  Of course, Lissa did not necessarily intend to read his books. She might want the computer only to write her midterm. But Dan knew she came from a middle-class family and could hardly afford the tuition, let alone her reading fees. Reading his books might be the only way she could graduate. He understood this situation; he himself had had to borrow to pay for all the research papers he read. (10% of those fees went to the researchers who wrote the papers; since Dan aimed for an academic career, he could hope that his own research papers, if frequently referenced, would bring in enough to repay this loan.)  Later on, Dan would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the library and read journal articles, and even books, without having to pay. There were independent scholars who read thousands of pages without government library grants. But in the 1990s, both commercial and nonprofit journal publishers had begun charging fees for access. By 2047, libraries offering free public access to scholarly literature were a dim memory.  There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central Licensing. They were themselves illegal. Dan had had a classmate in software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool, and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading books. But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were easily tempted into betrayal). In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.  Dan would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have debugging tools. There were even free debugging tools available on CD or downloadable over the net. But ordinary users started using them to bypass copyright monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this had become their principal use in actual practice. This meant they were illegal; the debuggers' developers were sent to prison.  Programmers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger vendors in 2047 distributed numbered copies only, and only to officially licensed and bonded programmers. The debugger Dan used in software class was kept behind a special firewall so that it could be used only for class exercises.  It was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a modified system kernel. Dan would eventually find out about the free kernels, even entire free operating systems, that had existed around the turn of the century. But not only were they illegal, like debuggers--you could not install one if you had one, without knowing your computer's root password. And neither the FBI nor Microsoft Support would tell you that.  Dan concluded that he couldn't simply lend Lissa his computer. But he couldn't refuse to help her, because he loved her. Every chance to speak with her filled him with delight. And that she chose him to ask for help, that could mean she loved him too.  Dan resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable--he lent her the computer, and told her his password. This way, if Lissa read his books, Central Licensing would think he was reading them. It was still a crime, but the SPA would not automatically find out about it. They would only find out if Lissa reported him.  Of course, if the school ever found out that he had given Lissa his own password, it would be curtains for both of them as students, regardless of what she had used it for. School policy was that any interference with their means of monitoring students' computer use was grounds for disciplinary action. It didn't matter whether you did anything harmful--the offense was making it hard for the administrators to check on you. They assumed this meant you were doing something else forbidden, and they did not need to know what it was.  Students were not usually expelled for this--not directly. Instead they were banned from the school computer systems, and would inevitably fail all their classes.  Later, Dan would learn that this kind of university policy started only in the 1980s, when university students in large numbers began using computers. Previously, universities maintained a different approach to student discipline; they punished activities that were harmful, not those that merely raised suspicion.  Lissa did not report Dan to the SPA. His decision to help her led to their marriage, and also led them to question what they had been taught about piracy as children. The couple began reading about the history of copyright, about the Soviet Union and its restrictions on copying, and even the original United States Constitution. They moved to Luna, where they found others who had likewise gravitated away from the long arm of the SPA. When the Tycho Uprising began in 2062, the universal right to read soon became one of its central aims.  Author's Note  The right to read is a battle being fought today. Although it may take 50 years for our present way of life to fade into obscurity, most of the specific laws and practices described above have already been proposed--either by the Clinton Administration or by publishers.  There is one exception: the idea that the FBI and Microsoft will keep the root passwords for personal computers. This is an extrapolation from the Clipper chip and similar Clinton Administration key-escrow proposals, together with a long-term trend: computer systems are increasingly set up to give absentee operators control over the people actually using the computer system.  The SPA, which actually stands for Software Publisher's Association, is not today an official police force. Unofficially, it acts like one. It invites people to inform on their coworkers and friends; like the Clinton Administration, it advocates a policy of collective responsibility whereby computer owners must actively enforce copyright or be punished.  The SPA is currently threatening small Internet service providers, demanding they permit the SPA to monitor all users. Most ISPs surrender when threatened, because they cannot afford to fight back in court. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 1 Oct 96, D3.) At least one ISP, Community ConneXion in Oakland CA, refused the demand and was actually sued. The SPA is said to have dropped this suit recently, but they are sure to continue the campaign in various other ways.  The university security policies described above are not imaginary. For example, a computer at one Chicago-area university prints this message when you log in (quotation marks are in the original):  \"This system is for the use of authorized users only. Individuals using this computer system without authority or in the excess of their authority are subject to having all their activities on this system monitored and recorded by system personnel. In the course of monitoring individuals improperly using this system or in the course of system maintenance, the activities of authorized user may also be monitored. Anyone using this system expressly consents to such monitoring and is advised that if such monitoring reveals possible evidence of illegal activity or violation of University regulations system personnel may provide the evidence of such monitoring to University authorities and/or law enforcement officials.\"  This is an interesting approach to the Fourth Amendment: pressure most everyone to agree, in advance, to waive their rights under it.

The wee Hopeful lived in a Frame House with Box Pillars in front and Hollyhocks leading down toward the Pike.  \"Whither shall I guide you?\" asked Ambition.  \"Are you far enough from the Shell to have any definite Hankering?\"  \"I have spent many Hours brooding over the possibilities of the Future,\" replied the Larva.  \"I want to grow up to be a Joey in a Circus.  I fairly ache to sit in a Red Wagon just behind the Band and drive a Trick Mule with little pieces of Looking Glass in the Harness. I want to pull Mugs at all the scared Country Girls peeking out of the Wagon Beds.  The Town Boys will leave the Elephant and trail behind my comical Chariot.  In my Hour of Triumph the Air will be impregnated with Calliope Music and the Smell of Pop-Corn, modified by Wild Animals.\"  Ambition went out to make the proper Bookings with Destiny.  When he came back the Boy was ten years old.  \"We started wrong,\" whispered Ambition, curling up in the cool grass near the Day-Dreamer.  \"The Trick Mule and the Red Cart are all very well for little Fraidy-Cats and Softies, but a brave Youth of High Spirit should tread the Deck of his own Ship with a Cutlass under his Red Sash.  Aye, that is Blood gauming up the Scuppers, but is the Captain chicken-hearted?  Up with the Black Flag!  Let it be give and take, with Pieces of Eight for the Victor!\"  So it was settled that the Lad was to hurry through the Graded Schools and then get at his Buccaneering.  But Ambition came back with a revised Program.  \"You are now Fifteen Years of Age,\" said the Wonderful Guide with the glittering Suit.  \"It is High Time that you planned a Noble Career, following a Straight Course from which there shall be no Deviation.  The Pirate is a mere swaggering Bravo and almost Unscrupulous at times.  Why not be a great Military Commander?  The Procedure is Simple.  Your Father gives the Finger to the Congressman and then you step off the Boat at West Point. Next thing you know, you are wearing a Nobby Uniform right out on the Parade Ground, while bevies of Debutantes from New York City and other Points admire you for the stern Profile and Military Set-Up.  After that you will subdue many Savage Tribes, and then you will march up Pennsylvania Avenue at the head of the whole Regular Army, and the President of the United States will be waiting on the Front Porch of the White House to present you with a jewelled Sword on behalf of a Grateful Nation.\"  \"You are right,\" said the Stripling.  His eyes were like Saucers, and his Nostrils quivered.  \"I will be Commander-in-Chief, and after I am laid away, with the Cannon booming, the Folks in this very Town will put up a Statue of Me at the corner of Sixth and Main, so the Street- Cars will have to circle to get around it.\"  Consequently, when he was in his 21st Year, he was sitting at a high Desk in an Office watching the Birds on a Telegraph Wire.  The Knowledge he had acquired at the two Prep Schools before being pushed into the Fresh Air ahead of Time had not made him round-shouldered.  He was a likely Chap, but he wore no Plumes.  He became dimly conscious that Ambition was squatted on the Stool next to him.  \"Up to this time we have been Dead Wrong,\" said the Periodical Visitor. \"There is only one Prize worth winning and that is the Love of the Niftiest Nectarine that ever came down a Crystal Stairway from the Celestial Regions to grace this dreary World with her Holy Presence. Yes, I mean the One you passed this morning--the One with her hair in a Net and the Cameo Brooch.  Why not annex her by Legal Routine and settle down in a neat Cottage purchased from the Building and Loan Association?  You could raise your own Vegetables.  Go to it.\"  Four years elapse.  Our Hero now has everything.  The jerry-built home of the Early Bungalow Period stands up bravely under the Mortgage. Little Dorothy is suspended in a Jump Chair on the Veranda facing Myrtle Avenue, along which the Green Cars run direct to City Hall Square.  The Goddess is in the kitchen trying to make preserves out of Watermelon Rinds, with the White House Cook Book propped open in front of her.  Friend Husband is weeding the Azaleas and grieving over the failure of the Egg-Plant.  He finds himself gently prodded, and there is Ambition once more at his Elbow.  \"You are entitled to One Hundred Thousand Dollars,\" murmurs the stealthy Promoter.  \"Why should some other Citizen have his Coal-Bin right in his House while you carry it from a Shed?  Your Wife should sit at her own Dinner Table and make signs at the Maid.  And as you ride to your Work with the other dead-eyed Cattle and see all those Strong-Arm Johnnies coming out of their Brick Mansions to hop into their own Broughams and Coupes, have you not asked yourself why you are in the Horse-Cars with the Plebes when you might be in a Private Rig with the Patricians?\"  For, wot ye, Gentle Reader, all this unwound from the Reel before the first Trolley Car climbed a Hill or the first Horseless Carriage came chugging sternly up the Boulevard.  So Ambition received special Instructions to make Our Hero worth $100,000.  Those were the day of tall Hustling:  If he saw an Opening six inches wide, he held it with his Foot until he could insert his Elbow, and then he braced his Shoulder, and the first thing you knew he was on the Inside demanding a fair cut of the Swag.  The Golden Rule received many a Jolt, but he adhered strictly to the old and favorite Admonition:  If you want Yours, take a short piece of Lead Pipe and go out and Collect.  On a certain January First he made a careful Invoice.  All the Hard- Earned Kale dropped into the Mining Companies or loaned to Relatives of Wife he marked off and put under the Head of Gone but not Forgotten. He was a True Business Guy.  Even after subtracting all Cats and Dogs he could still total the magnificent Sum of One Hundred Thousand Dollars.  When he looked at this Mound of Currency, he felt like a Vag and a Pauper.  For he had climbed to the table-lands of High Finance and taken a peek at the Steam-Roller methods of the Real Tabascos.  \"Make it a Million,\" said Ambition, leaning across the Table and tapping nervously.  \"Are you going to be satisfied with a Station Wagon and a Colored Boy when you might have a long-waisted Vehicle with two pale Simpsons in Livery on the Box?  When you go into your Club and see the Menials kow-towing to a cold-looking Party with rippling Chins who seems to favor his Feet, you know that he gets the Waving Palms and the Frankincense because he is a Millionaire.  You and the other financial Gnats are admitted simply to make a Stage Setting for the Big Squash.\"  \"I always said that when I got a Hundred Thousand I'd take a long Vacation in Europe and learn how to order a Meal,\" suggested Our Hero, holding out weakly.  \"When you came back you would find your hated Rival on the Hill with the Batteries turned against you.  Camp on the Job and work straight toward the High Mark.  And remember that anybody with less than a Million is a Two-Spot in a soiled Deck.\"  From that day the Piking ceased.  No more of the dinky trafficking of the Retailer.  He went out and bought Public Service Utilities on Nerve, treated them with Aqua Pura by the Hogshead, and created Wealth by purely lithographic Methods.  And, if he wanted to reason out a Deal with a contrary-minded Gazook, he began the Negotiations by soaking the Adversary behind the Ear and frisking him before he came to.  A Fairy Wand had been waved above the snide Bungalow, and it was now a Queen Anne Chateau dripping with Dew-dads of Scroll Work and congested with Black Walnut.  The Goddess took her Mocha in the Feathers, and a Music Teacher came twice each week to bridge the awful chasm between Dorothy and Chopin.  Dinner had been moved up to Milking Time.  Sweetbreads and Artichokes came into the Lives of the Trio thus favored by Fortune.  One day the busy Thimble-Rigger took his Helpmate into the lonesome Library and broke the glad Tidings to her.  \"I have unloaded all my Cripples,\" he said.  \"They have been wished on a Group of Philanthropists in New England.  Sound the glad Tocsin.  I have a Million in my Kick.\"  So she began packing the huge Saratogas and reading the Folders on Egypt and the Riviera.  He sat in his Den pulling at a long black Excepcionale.  Through the bluish clouds of Smoke came that old familiar Voice.  \"Let the Missus and the Heiress do the European Thing,\" said Ambition. \"You stick around.  Wait"]]]
