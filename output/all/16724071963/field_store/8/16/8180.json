Jan Six was surrounded from his earliest years with everything which tended to the gratification of his natural taste for culture. Rembrandt's rare talent, however, overbalanced any lack of early advantages, and made him a friend worth having.  Six had come of Huguenot ancestry. His grandfather had fled to Holland during the Huguenot persecution in France, and had become a resident in Amsterdam in 1585. Jan's father, another Jan, had married a Dutch lady of good family, whose maiden name was Anna Wijmer. It was in the service of this good lady that we first hear of Rembrandt's connection with the Six family. He was called to paint her portrait in 1641, and must have then, if not before, made the acquaintance of her young son, Jan. Jan united to a great love of learning a love of everything beautiful, and was an ardent collector of objects of art. Paintings of the old Italian and early Dutch schools, rare prints and curios of various kinds, were his delight. He found in Rembrandt a man after his own heart. Already the painter had gone far beyond his means in filling his own house with costly works of art. So the two men, having a hobby in common, found a strong bond of union in their congenial tastes. We may be sure that they were often together, to show their new purchases and discuss their beauty.  Rembrandt, as an older and more experienced collector, would doubtless have good advice to offer his younger friend, and, an artist himself, would know how to judge correctly a work of art. One record of their friendship in these years is a little etched landscape which Rembrandt made in 1641, showing a bridge near the country estate of the Six family, a place called Elsbroek, near the village of Hillegom.  [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF JAN SIX _Museum of Fine Arts, Boston_]  It was in 1647 that Rembrandt made this portrait of his friend, then twenty-nine years of age. Six had now begun to make a name for himself in the world of letters as a scholar and poet. He had already published a poem on Muiderberg (a village near Amsterdam), and by this time, doubtless, had under way his great literary work, the tragedy of Medæa. Many were the times when Rembrandt, coming to his house to talk over some new treasure-trove, found him in his library with his head buried in a book, and his thoughts far away. It was in such a moment that he must have had the idea of this beautiful portrait. He catches his friend one day in the corner of his library, standing with his back to the window to get the light on the book he is reading. He transfers the picture to a copper plate and hands it down to future generations.  The slender figure of the young man is clad in the picturesque dress of a gentleman of his time, with knee-breeches and low shoes, with wide white collar and cuffs. His abundant wavy blond hair falls to his shoulders; he has the air of a true poet. In his eagerness to read, he has flung his cavalier's cloak on the window seat behind him, a part of it dropping upon a chair beyond. Its voluminous folds make a cushion for him, as he leans gracefully against the window ledge. His sword and belt lie on the chair with the cloak. For the moment the pen is mightier than the sword. The furnishings of the room show the owner's tastes; a pile of folio volumes fill a low chair, an antique picture hangs on the wall.  The young man's face is seen by the light reflected from the pages of his open book. It is a refined, sensitive face, of high intellectual cast, amiable withal, and full of imagination. He is completely absorbed in his reading, a smile playing about his mouth. How little of a fop and how much of a poet he is, we see from his disordered collar. Breathing quickly as he bends over his book, in his excitement he cannot endure the restraint of a close collar. He has unloosed it, as, quite oblivious of any untidiness in his appearance, he hurries on, ruthlessly crushing the pages of the folio back, as he grasps it in his hand.  The friendship between Six and Rembrandt seemed to grow apace; for when the tragedy of Medæa was published, in 1648, it was illustrated by a magnificent etching by Rembrandt, representing the Marriage of Jason and Creusa.  The literary work of Jan Six led the way to various public honors. In 1656 he became commissioner of marriages; in 1667, a member of the Council of the States General of Holland, and in 1691, burgomaster of Amsterdam. His continued friendship for Rembrandt was shown in his purchasing a number of the latter's paintings. Rembrandt at length painted a magnificent portrait of his friend in his old age, which, with the portrait of his mother and the original plate for this etching, still remains in the Six family in Amsterdam. Referring to the portrait of Jan Six, the famous Dutch poet, Vondel, contemporary of Rembrandt and Six, paid a fitting tribute to the great burgomaster, as a \"lover of science, art, and virtue.\"     XII  PORTRAIT OF AN OLD WOMAN   The story is told of a little child who, upon being introduced to a kind-faced lady, looked up brightly into her eyes with the question, \"Whose mother are you?\" When we look into the wrinkled old face of this picture, the same sort of a question springs to mind, and we involuntarily ask, \"Whose grandmother are you?\" We are sure that children and grandchildren have leaned upon that capacious lap. The name of the subject is not known, though the same face appears many times in Rembrandt's works. But there are many people whose names we can quote, of whom we know much less than of this old woman.  The story of her life is written in the picture. Those clasped hands, large and knotted, have done much hard work. They have ministered to the needs of two generations. They have dandled the baby on her knee, and supported the little toddler taking his first steps. They have tended the child and wrought for the youth. They have built the fire on the hearth and swept out the house; they have kneaded the bread and filled the kettle; they have spun and woven, and sewed and mended. They have not even shrunk from the coarser labors of dooryard and field, the care of the cattle, the planting and harvesting. But labor has done nothing to coarsen the innate refinement of the soul which looks out of the fine old face.  She is resting now. The children and grandchildren have grown up to take care of themselves and their grandmother also. She has time to sit down in the twilight of life, just as she used to sit down at the close of each day's work, to think over what has happened. She has a large comfortable chair, and she is neatly dressed, as befits an old woman whose life work is done. A white kerchief is folded across her bosom, a shawl is wrapped about her shoulders, and a hood droops over her forehead. Her thoughts are far away from her present surroundings; something sad occupies them. She dreams of the past and perhaps also of the future. Sorrow as well as work has had a large share in her life, but she has borne it all with patient resignation. She is not one to complain, and does not mean to trouble others with her sadness. But left all alone with her musings, a look of yearning comes into her eyes as for something beautiful and much loved, lost long ago.  Some painters have been at great pains to fashion a countenance sorrowful enough and patient enough to represent the subject of the Mater Dolorosa, that is, the Sorrowing Mother of Christ. Perhaps they would have succeeded better if they had turned away from their own imaginations to some mother in real life, who has loved and worked and suffered like this one. The face answers in part our first question. A woman like this is capable of mothering great sons. Industrious, patient, self-sacrificing, she would spare herself nothing to train them faithfully. And the life of which her face speaks--a life of self-denying toil, ennobled by high ideals of duty--is the stuff of which heroes are made. Some of the great men of history had such mothers.  [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF AN OLD WOMAN _Hermitage Gallery, St. Petersburg_]  The picture illustrates the fact that a face may be interesting and even artistic, if not beautiful. This idea may surprise many, for when one calls a person \"as pretty as a picture,\" it seems to be understood that it is only pretty people who make suitable models for pictures. Rembrandt, however, was of quite another mind. He was a student of character as well as a painter, and he cared to paint faces more for their expression than for beauty of feature.  Now the expression of a face is to a great extent the index of character. We say that the child has \"no character in his face,\" meaning that his skin is still fair and smooth, before his thoughts and feelings have made any record there. Gradually the character impresses itself on his face. Experience acts almost like a sculptor's chisel, carving lines of care and grooving furrows of sorrow, shaping the mouth and the setting of the eyes.  The longer this process continues, the more expressive the face becomes, so that it is the old whose faces tell the most interesting stories of life. Rembrandt understood this perfectly, and none ever succeeded better than he in revealing the poetry and beauty of old age.  His way of showing the character in the face of this old woman is very common with him. The high light of the picture is concentrated on the face and is continued down upon the snowy kerchief. This forms a diamond of light shading by gradations into darker tints. It was the skillful use of light and shadow in the picture, which made a poetic and artistic work of a subject which another painter might have made very commonplace.

In connection with these collections, I am indebted to Mr. Frank H. Cushing for the preparation of the field catalogue for the collection from Zuñi. His thorough knowledge of the Zuñi language enabled him to obtain the Indian name of most of the articles procured, which names are given in this catalogue. I have also to thank him for valuable assistance in making the collection. I also take pleasure in expressing thanks to Mr. Victor Mindeleff for his aid in making the collection, in which labor he rendered faithful assistance.  Col. L. P. Bradley, commandant of Fort Wingate, extended us many courtesies and material aid, for which I am pleased to extend thanks.  Hoping the collections of the season form a contribution equally valuable with those previously procured from the southwest,  I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,    JAMES STEVENSON.       Prof. J. W. POWELL, _Director Bureau of Ethnology_.     ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE OF THE COLLECTIONS OF 1881.  By James Stevenson.   INTRODUCTORY.  The following catalogue contains a descriptive enumeration of the archaeologic and ethnologic specimens collected in Arizona and New Mexico during the season of 1881. These collections were all obtained from the pueblo of Zuñi in Northwestern New Mexico, and the pueblos comprising the province of Tusayan, in Northeastern Arizona. The entire collection contains about four thousand nine hundred specimens.  The articles of stone consist of axes, in various conditions of preservation. Some are quite perfect, while many are more or less impaired by modern uses, for which they were not originally intended. In nearly all instances they are grooved, and a few are provided with double splitting or cutting edges; but as a rule these axes were made with one end blunt for pounding or hammering, while the opposite end is provided with an edge. The large pestles and mortars were designed for crushing grain and food, the small ones for grinding and mixing mineral pigments for ceramic or decorative purposes.  Among the articles of stone are about one hundred and fifty hunting and war amulets. These objects present the most interesting features of the collection, and were among the most difficult articles to obtain. The Indians prize them very highly as keepsakes, which they employ in war, the chase, and sacred ceremonies. Each specimen is specifically referred to in the catalogue, accompanied with some wood-cut illustrations of such specimens as possess the greatest significance.  Mr. Frank H. Cushing has presented a full account of the history, traditions, and uses of these images or gods, in a paper entitled “Zuñi Fetiches,” in the Second Annual Report of the Bureau for 1882, to which the reader is referred.  In these collections, as in those of the two previous seasons, articles of clay predominate. They consist of Tinajas, or large, decorated, vase-shaped water-vessels. These vary in capacity from one to six gallons, and are the principal vessels used for holding and storing water for domestic purposes. These vases do not vary greatly in form, yet the colored designs with which they are ornamented present as many variations as there are specimens. The causes for these variations, both in size and ceramic characters, as well as the method of manufacturing them, are quite fully explained in the notes accompanying my catalogue of collections from these same localities in the Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology for 1880-’81.  The collection also contains a large number of jug-shaped canteens, varying in capacity from one pint to three gallons. These vessels, like an ordinary jug, are provided with a small nozzle, and are used to carry water and to drink from. They vary in their decorative designs, but are seldom as elaborate or beautiful as the vases.  In the collection are also clay spoons, ladles, and dippers of two or three kinds of ware, such as red, white, and black, of various sizes. Many of these are fancifully decorated. Also pitchers, mugs, and cups of different patterns, forms, and sizes, variously ornamented in red, black, and white. A very fine collection of meal or sacred pottery baskets was obtained. These are also of varied forms or types, some with handles, terraced and fluted edges or rims, usually decorated with figures of the tadpole and horned frog, and occasionally with the representation of the road runner, and frequently with the sacred butterfly.  The condiment vessels form no small part of the collection. The forms and styles of these vessels can only be appreciated by reference to the specific descriptions and illustrations in the catalogue.  A large number of cooking bowls and pots were obtained, but these are of less interest, as they are in all cases plain black vessels without ornamentation of any kind. They generally resemble the old-fashioned cast-iron cooking pot used by Europeans. Occasionally one is found which is provided with legs, in imitation probably of the skillet or pots used by the Mexicans of that country.  The vegetal substances comprise utensils and implements of all kinds. Among these are baskets, trays, water-jugs, corn-planters, bows, arrows, sieves, gaming-blocks, &c. The basketry is worthy of inspection for the ingenuity and skill displayed in the manufacture of such articles. These consist of fine meal baskets or trays of all sizes, many of which are curiously ornamented"]]]
