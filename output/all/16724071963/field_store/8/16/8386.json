Anybody got an idea?\"  \"Our minds have been so full of the Christmas Ship that it has squeezed everything else out, I'm afraid,\" admitted Della, with a delicate frown drawing her eyebrows.  \"Why can't we continue to make the Christmas Ship useful somehow?\" inquired Dorothy.  \"Meaning?\"  \"I hardly know. Perhaps we could have our presents for the children in a Christmas Ship instead of on a tree.\"  \"That's good. They'll have one tree anyway; this will be a novelty, and it can be made pretty.\"  \"Can we get enough stuff to fill a ship?\"  \"Depends on the size of the ship.\"  \"It wouldn't have to be full; just the deck could be heaped with parcels.\"  \"And the rigging could be lighted.\"  \"How can we ring in the children so they can have more of a part than singing carols?\"  \"Why not make them do the work themselves--the work of distributing the gifts?\"  \"I know,\" cried Helen. \"Why not tell them about the real Christmas Ship and then tell them that they are to play that they all went over with it on its Christmas errand. We can dress up some of the boys as sailors--\"  \"Child, you don't realize what you're suggesting,\" exclaimed Margaret. \"Do you know there are twenty or twenty-five boys there? We couldn't make all those costumes!\"  \"That's true,\" agreed Helen, dismayed. Her dismay soon turned to cheerfulness, however. \"Why couldn't they wear an arm band marked SAILOR? They can use their imaginations to supply the rest of the costume.\"  \"That would do well enough. And have another group of them marked LONGSHOREMAN.\"  \"We can pick out the tallest boy to represent Commander Courtney and some of the others to be officers.\"  \"You're giving all the work to the boys; what can the girls do?\"  \"Don't let's have any of them play orphan. That would come too near home. They won't follow the story too far. They'll be contented to distribute the gifts to each other.\"  \"Here's where the girls can come in. The officers can bring the good ship into port, and the sailors can make a handsome showing along the side as she comes up to the pier, and the longshoremen can stagger ashore laden with big bundles. On the shore there can be groups of girls who will undo the large bundles and take out the small ones that they contain. Other groups of girls can go about giving out the presents.\"  \"I'll bet they'll have such a good time playing the game they won't notice whether the presents are ten centers or fifties,\" shouted Roger. \"I believe we've got the right notion.\"  \"We must do everything up nicely so they'll have fun opening the parcels,\" insisted Helen.  \"Here's where James begins pasting again. Where's my pastepot, Dorothy?\" inquired James who had done wonders in making boxes to contain the gifts that went in the real Ship.  \"Here are all your arrangements in the corner, and I'll make you some paste right off,\" said Dorothy, pointing out the corner of the attic where a table held cardboard and flowered paper and scissors.  Unless there was some especial reason for a meeting elsewhere the Club always met in Dorothy's attic, where the afternoon sun streamed in cheerfully through the low windows. There the members could leave their unfinished work and it would not be disturbed, and the place had proved to be so great a comfort during the autumn months, that Mrs. Smith had had a radiator put in so that it was warm and snug for winter use. Electric lights had made it possible for them to work there occasionally during the evening and it was as cheerful an apartment as one would care to see, even though its furniture was made largely of boxes converted into useful articles by Dorothy's inventive genius.  \"Some time during Christmas week we ought to cheer up the old couple by the bridge,\" urged Roger.  \"The same people we chopped wood for?\" asked Tom.  \"The Atwoods--yes. It gets on my nerves to see them sitting there so dully, every day when I pass by on my way to school.\"  \"We certainly won't forget them. We can do something that won't make any demand on our treasury, so Tom won't mind our adding them to our Christmas list.\"  \"I dare say we'll think of others before we go much farther. What we need to do now is to decide on things to make for the Glen Pointers,\" and the talk went off into a discussion which proved to be merely a selection from what they had learned to do while they were making up their parcels for the real Christmas Ship. Now, with but a short time before Christmas, they chose articles that could be made quickly. The girls also decided on the candies that each should make to fill the boxes, and they made requisition on the treasury for the materials so that they could go to work at once upon the lasting kinds. Before the afternoon was over the attic resumed once more the busy look it had worn for so many weeks before the sailing of the _Jason_.  \"Ethel Blue!\" came a call up the attic stairs.  Ethel Blue ran down to see what her aunt wanted, and came back beaming, two letters in her hand.  \"Here's a letter from Mrs. Jackson to Aunt Marian saying that Katharine may come to us for a fortnight, and another one from Katharine to me telling how crazy she is to come. Isn't it fine!\"  Ethel threw her arm over Ethel Brown's shoulder and pulled her into the march that was the Mortons' expression of great pleasure: \"One, two, three, back; one, two, three, back,\" around the attic.  \"When is she coming?\" asked Roger, who had never seen Katharine and so was able to endure calmly the prospect of her visit.  \"Two days before Christmas--that's Wednesday in the afternoon.\"  \"We'll ask grandmother to let us have the car to go and get her; it's so much more fun than the train,\" proposed Ethel Brown.  \"Um, glorious.\"  The attic rang with the Ethels' delight--at which they looked back afterwards with some wonder.     CHAPTER V  THE GOOD SHIP \"JASON\"   The Rosemont schools closed for the holidays at noon of the Wednesday before Christmas, so all the Mortons and Dorothy were free to avail themselves of Mrs. Emerson's offer of her car to bring Katharine from Hoboken. It was a pleasant custom of the family to regard any guests as belonging not to one or another member in particular but to all of them. All felt a responsibility for the guest's happiness and all shared in any amusement that he or she might give.  According to this custom, not the Ethels alone went to meet Katharine, but Helen and Roger and Dorothy, too. Mrs. Morton chaperoned them and Dicky was added for good measure. It was a sharp day and the Rosemont group were rosy with cold when they reached the station and lined themselves up on the platform just before the Buffalo train drew in. Katharine and the Jacksons' German maid, Gretchen, were among the first to get off.  \"Gretchen is going to make a holiday visit, too,\" Katharine explained when she had greeted the Ethels, whom she knew, and had been introduced to the other members of the party.  Mrs. Morton and Roger instructed Gretchen how to reach Staten Island where her friends lived and then they got into the car and sped toward home.  Katharine did not seem so much at ease as she had done when she played hostess to the Ethels at Fort Edward. She was accustomed to meeting many people, but she was an only child and being plunged into a big family, all chattering at once, it seemed to her, caused her some embarrassment. In an effort not to show it she was not always happy in her remarks.  \"Is this your car?\" she asked.  \"It's Grandmother Emerson's,\" replied Ethel Brown. \"She lets us have it very often.\"  \"I don't care for a touring car in cold weather. My grandmother has a limousine.\"  \"We're glad to have a ride in any kind of car,\" responded Ethel Blue happily.  \"Roger, get out that other rug for Katharine,\" directed Mrs. Morton, \"she's chilly.\"  \"Oh, no,\" demurred Katharine, now ashamed at having made a remark that seemed to reflect upon the comfort of her friends' automobile. \"I'm used to a Ford, any way.\"  \"I'm afraid you don't know much about cars if you do come from an automobile city,\" commented Roger dryly. \"This car would make about three Fords--though I don't sneeze at a Ford myself. I'd be mighty glad if we had one, wouldn't you, Mother?\"  Mrs. Morton shook her head at him, and he subsided, humming merrily,    He took four spools and an old tin can   And called it a Ford and the strange thing ran.  The Ethels had not paid much attention to the conversation but nevertheless it had struck the wrong note and no one felt entirely at ease. They found themselves wondering whether their guest would find her room to her liking and they remembered uneasily that they had said \"I guess she won't mind\" this and that when they had left some of their belongings in the closet.  The Morton's house was not large and in order to accommodate a guest the Ethels moved upstairs into a tiny room in the attic, where they were to camp for the fortnight of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19834"],["title","Ethel Morton's Holidays (#8)"],["body","arine's stay. They had thought it great fun, and were more than willing to endure the discomfort of crowded quarters for the sake of having the long-desired visit. Now, however, Ethel Brown murmured to Ethel Blue as they went into the house, \"I'm glad we had one of the beds taken upstairs; it will give her more space,\" and Ethel Blue replied, \"I believe we can hang our dancing school dresses in the east corner of the attic if we put a sheet around them.\"  Indeed, Ethel Blue made a point of running upstairs while Katharine was speaking to Dorothy in the living room and removing the dresses from the closet. She looked around the room with new sight. It had seemed pleasant and bright to her in the morning when she and Ethel Brown had added some last touches to the fresh muslin equipment of the bureau, but now she wished that they had had a perfectly new bureau cover, and she was sorry she had not asked Mary to give the window another cleaning although it had been washed only a few days before.  \"Perhaps she won't notice,\" she murmured hopefully, but in her heart of hearts she was pretty sure she would.  Katharine made no comment, however, beyond lifted eyebrows when she noticed anything different from what she had been accustomed to in a house where there was a small family, and, in consequence, plenty of space. She unpacked her trunk and hung up her clothes with care and neatness which the Ethels admired. Ordinarily they would have praised her frankly for doing well what they sometimes failed to do well, but they had not yet recovered from the constraint that her remarks on the way home had thrown over them. It was not lessened when she mentioned that usually Gretchen did her unpacking for her.  \"Mary would love to unpack for us,\" said Ethel Brown, \"but if she did that we'd have to do some of her work, so we'd rather hang up our duds ourselves.\"  Katharine was greatly interested in the Club plans for the Glen Point orphans. She had lived in garrisons in the remote West and in or near large cities, but her experience never had placed her in a comparatively small town like Rosemont or Glen Point where people took a friendly interest in each other and in community institutions. She entered heartily into the final preparations for the imitation Christmas Ship and she and the girls forgot their mutual embarrassment in their work for some one else.  Roger went to Glen Point in the morning of the day before Christmas to meet the other Club boys and build the Ship in the hall of the orphanage. They worked there for several hours and lunched with James and Margaret at the Hancocks'. The rest of the Mortons and Katharine took over the parcels in the early afternoon in the car and arranged them on the deck as had been planned, and then all the young people came back together, for they were to have a part in the lighting of the Rosemont Christmas Tree.  The tree was a huge Norway spruce and it was set up in front of the high school which had a lawn before it large enough to hold a goodly crowd of observers. The choirs of all the churches had volunteered their services for the occasion. They were placed on a stand elevated above the crowd so that they could lead the singing and be heard at a distance.  Except for murmurs of admiration and a long-drawn breath of delight there was no sound from the throng. It was too beautiful for speech; the meaning was too laden with brotherly love and cheer for it to be mistaken. A sad-eyed girl smiled to herself and gazed with new hope in her face; a pickpocket took his hand out of his neighbor's bag that had opened like magic under his practised touch. Babies stretched out their arms to the glitter; grown men stared silently with unaccustomed tears wetting their eyes. The school children sang on and on, \"Oh, come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant;\" then \"Hark, the herald angels sing, Glory to the new-born King;\" and \"It came upon the midnight clear.\" The fresh young voices rang gloriously, strengthened by the more mature voices of the choirs.  The stars were coming out before the first person turned away, and all through the night watchers of the tree's resplendent glory were found by the patrolling policeman gazing, gazing, with thoughts of peace reflected on faces that had long been unknown to peace.  It was after six when the Emerson car whirled the U. S. C. back to the Mortons' for a dinner that had to be eaten hastily, for they were due at the Glen Point orphanage soon after seven so that all might be in order for the doors to be opened to the children at half past. Helen was always urging punctuality as Tom was commanding promptness.  \"If we were small youngsters and had had to wait all day for our Christmas party we'd be wild at having it delayed a minute longer than necessary,\" the President insisted, and Tom added his usual exhortation, \"Run the thing along briskly; don't let it drag. You can 'put over' lots of stupid stuff by rushing it on gayly, and a good 'stunt' may be good for nothing if it goes slowly.\"  \"Helen and Tom can't say that they 'never sing the old, old songs,' can they?\" laughed Ethel Brown. \"The Club has never done anything yet that we haven't heard these same sweet strains from both of them.\"  \"You're very likely to hear them again--my chant, any way,\" declared her sister firmly.  \"It won't do us any harm,\" Ethel Brown yielded good-naturedly.  The boys had made the good ship _Jason_ with some ingenuity. The matron had let them have a table, long and so old that the marks of boots upon it would do no harm. This was important for it was to be used as the forward deck. Because in the days of its youth it had been used in the dining room of the smaller children it was lower than an ordinary table. This made it just the right height, for the ship's rail was to rise above it, and if it had been higher the people on the floor could not have seen the deck comfortably.  At the end of the table was tied the mast--a broom stick with electric light wires strung with tiny bulbs going from its top to the deck. This electrical display was a contribution from Roger who had asked his grandfather to give it to him for his Christmas gift and had requested that he might have it in time for him to lend it to the _Jason_. It was run by a storage battery hidden in a box that was safely bestowed under the deck. Aft of the mainmast were two kitchen chairs placed side by side to give the craft the needed length.  The outside of the boat was made by stretching a double length of war-gray cambric from the bow--two hammock stretchers fastened to the end of the table--along the deck, past the chairs and across their end. The cloth was raised a trifle above the deck by laths nailed on to the edge of the table. The name, \"Jason,\" in black letters, was pinned along the bow.  \"It isn't a striking likeness of a boat,\" confessed Roger, \"but any intelligent person would be able to guess what it was meant to be.\"  When the children and a few other people who had begged to be allowed to come entered the hall they found the ship lighted and with its deck piled high with wooden boxes and parcels of good size. The members of the U. S. C. were gathered beside the ship. When all had entered Helen, as president of the Club, mounted one of the chairs which represented the after part of the boat and told the story of the real ship _Jason_.  \"Children from all over the United States sent Christmas gifts to the European children who otherwise would not have any because of the war. Tonight we are going to pretend that we are all sailing on the _Jason_ to carry the gifts to Europe. We've all got to help--every one of us. First of all we want a captain. I think that boy over there near the door will be the captain, because he's the tallest boy I see here.\"  Embarrassed but pleased the tall boy came forward and Della fastened on his arm a band marked CAPTAIN. Following instructions he mounted the chair from which Helen descended. Two under officers were chosen in the same way, and the Ethels raised them to the ranks of first and second lieutenants by the simple method of fastening on suitable arm bands.  \"Now we want some sailors,\" cried Roger, and he selected ten other boys, who were all rapidly adorned with SAILOR bands by the U. S. C. gifts. The ship was about as full as she could be now, with her officers standing, one on the deck and the others on the two chairs, and the sailors manning the rail. Everybody was beginning to enjoy the game by this time, and the faces that looked out over the gray cambric sides of the _Jason_ were beaming with eagerness to find out what was coming next, while the children who had not yet been assigned to any task were equally curious to find out how they were to help.  \"Now we're on the pier at the Bush Terminal at Brooklyn,\" explained Tom. \"Look out there; don't get in the way of the ropes,\" and he pushed the crowd back from the imaginary ropes, and whistled a shrill call on his fingers.  \"See, she's moving! She's starting!\" cried Ethel Blue. \"Wave your handkerchief! Wave it!\" she directed the children near her, who fell into the spirit of the pretense and gave the Christmas Ship a noisy send-off.  \"Now we'll all turn our backs while the ship is crossing the Atlantic,\" directed James.  It required only a minute for the boat to make the crossing, and when the onlookers turned about after this trip of unparalleled swiftness they were told that now they were not Americans any longer; they were English people at Devonport gathered to watch the arrival of the _Jason_ and to help unload the presents sent to the children of England and Belgium.  \"I want some longshoremen to help unload these boxes,\" said Helen, \"and a set of sorters and a set of distributors. Who'll volunteer as longshoremen?\"  There was a quick response, and this group exhausted all the boys. They were designated by arm bands each marked LONGSHOREMAN. Then she called for girls for the other two detachments"]]]
