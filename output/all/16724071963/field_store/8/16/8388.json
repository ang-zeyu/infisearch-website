The Atlantic shores of Europe, and not the Mediterranean shores of Asia and of Egypt, are called here \"The First Far West\" because the first really Western people grew up in Europe and became quite different from all the Eastern peoples.  The Second Far West, two thousand years later, was America itself.  _Westward Ho!_ is the very good name of a book about adventures in America when this Second Far West was just beginning.  \"Go West!\" was the advice given to adventurous people in America during the nineteenth century.  \"The Last West and Best West\" is what Canadians now call their own North-West.  And it certainly is the very last West of all; for over there, across the Pacific, are the lands of southern Asia from which the first emigrants began moving West so many thousand years ago. Thus the circuit of the World and its migrations is now complete; and we can at last look round and learn the whole story, from Farthest East to Farthest West.  Most of it is an old, old story from the common points of view; and it has been told over and over again by many different people and in many different ways.  But from one point of view, and that a most important point, it is newer now than ever.  Look at it from the seaman's point of view, and the whole meaning changes in the twinkling of an eye, becoming new, true, and complete.  Nearly all books deal with the things of the land, and of the land alone, their writers forgetting or not knowing that the things of the land could never have been what they are had it not been for the things of the sea.  Without the vastly important things of the sea, without the war fleets and merchant fleets of empires old and new, it is perfectly certain that the world could not have been half so good a place to live in; for freedom and the sea tend to go together.  True of all people, this is truer still of us; for the sea has been the very breath of British life and liberty ever since the first hardy Norseman sprang ashore on English soil.  Nobody knows how the Egyptians first learnt ship-building from the people farther East.  But we do know that they were building ships in Egypt seven thousand years ago, that their ninth king was called Betou, which means \"the prow of a ship\", and that his artists carved pictures of boats five hundred years older than the Great Pyramid.  These pictures, carved on the tombs of the kings, are still to be seen, together with some pottery, which, coming from the Balkans, shows that Betou had boats trading across the eastern end of the Mediterranean.  A picture carved more than six thousand years ago shows an Egyptian boat being paddled by fourteen men and steered with paddles by three more on the right-hand side of the stern as you look toward the bow.  Thus the \"steer-board\" (or steering side) was no new thing when its present name of \"starboard\" was used by our Norse ancestors a good many hundred years ago.  The Egyptians, steering on the right-hand side, probably took in cargo on the left side or \"larboard\", that is, the \"load\" or \"lading\" side, now called the \"port\" side, as \"larboard\" and \"starboard\" sounded too much alike when shouted in a gale.  Up in the bow of this old Egyptian boat stood a man with a pole to help in steering down the Nile.  Amidships stood a man with a cat-o'-nine-tails, ready to slash any one of the wretched slave paddlers who was not working hard.  All through the Rowing Age, for thousands and thousands of years, the paddlers and rowers were the same as the well-known galley-slaves kept by the Mediterranean countries to row their galleys in peace and war.  These galleys, or rowing men-of-war, lasted down to modern times, as we shall soon see.  They did use sails; but only when the wind was behind them, and never when it blew really hard.  The mast was made of two long wooden spars set one on each side of the galley, meeting at the head, and strengthened in between by braces from one spar to another.  As time went on better boats and larger ones were built in Egypt.  We can guess how strong they must have been when they carried down the Nile the gigantic blocks of stone used in building the famous Pyramids.  Some of these blocks weigh up to sixty tons; so that both the men who built the barges to bring them down the Nile and those who built these huge blocks into the wonderful Pyramids must have known their business pretty well a thousand years before Noah built his Ark.  The Ark was built in Mesopotamia, less than five thousand years ago, to save Noah from the flooded Euphrates.  The shipwrights seem to have built it like a barge or house-boat.  If so, it must have been about fifteen thousand tons, taking the length of the cubit in the Bible story at eighteen inches.  It was certainly not a ship, only some sort of construction that simply floated about with the wind and current till it ran aground.  But Mesopotamia and the shores of the Persian Gulf were great places for shipbuilding.  They were once the home of adventurers who had come West from southern Asia, and of the famous Phoenicians, who went farther West to find a new seaboard home along the shores of Asia Minor, just north of Palestine, where they were in the shipping business three thousand years ago, about the time of the early Kings of Israel.  These wonderful Phoenicians touch our interest to the very quick; for they were not only the seamen hired by \"Solomon in all his glory\" but they were also the founders of Carthage and the first oversea traders with the Atlantic coasts of France and the British Isles.  Their story thus goes home to all who love the sea, the Bible, and Canada's two Mother Lands.  They had shipping on the Red Sea as well as on the Mediterranean; and it was their Red Sea merchant vessels that coasted Arabia and East Africa in the time of Solomon (1016-976 B.C.).  They also went round to Persia and probably to India.  About 600 B.C. they are said to have coasted round the whole of Africa, starting from the Red Sea and coming back by Gibraltar.  This took them more than two years, as they used to sow wheat and wait on shore till the crop was ripe.  Long before this they had passed Gibraltar and settled the colony of Tarshish, where they found silver in such abundance that \"it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon.\"  We do not know whether it was \"the ships of Tarshish and of the Isles\" that first felt the way north to France and England.  But we do know that many Phoenicians did trade with the French and British Celts, who probably learnt in this way how to build ships of their own.     CHAPTER III  EAST AGAINST WEST  (480-146 B.C.)  For two thousand years Eastern fleets and armies tried to conquer Europe.  Sometimes hundreds of years would pass without an attack.  But the result was always the same--the triumph of West over East; and the cause of each triumph was always the same--the sea-power of the West. Without those Western navies the Europe and America we know today could never have existed.  There could have been no Greek civilization, no Roman government, no British Empire, and no United States.  First, the Persians fought the Greeks at Salamis in 480 B.C.  Then Carthage fought Rome more than two hundred years later.  Finally, the conquering Turks were beaten by the Spaniards at Lepanto more than two thousand years after Salamis, but not far from the same spot, Salamis being ten miles from Athens and Lepanto a hundred.  Long before Salamis the Greeks had been founding colonies along the Mediterranean, among them some on the Asiatic side of the Aegean Sea, where the French and British fleets had so much to do during the Gallipoli campaign of 1915 against the Turks and Germans.  Meanwhile the Persians had been fighting their way north-westwards till they had reached the Aegean and conquered most of the Greeks and Phoenicians there.  Then the Greeks at Athens sent a fleet which landed an army that burnt the city of Sardis, an outpost of Persian power.  Thereupon King Darius, friend of the Prophet Daniel, vowed vengeance on Athens, and caused a trusty servant to whisper in his ear each day, \"Master, remember Athens!\"  Now, the Persians were landsmen, with what was then the greatest army in the world, but with a navy and a merchant fleet mostly manned by conquered Phoenicians and Greek colonists, none of whom wanted to see Greece itself destroyed.  So when Darius met the Greeks at Marathon his fleet and army did not form the same sort of United Service that the British fleet and army form.  He was beaten back to his ships and retired to Asia Minor.  But \"Remember Athens!\" was always in his mind. So for ten years he and his son Xerxes prepared a vast armada against which they thought no other force on earth could stand.  But, like the Spanish Armada against England two thousand years later, this Persian host was very much stronger ashore than afloat.  Its army was so vast that it covered the country like a swarm of locusts.  At the world-famous pass of Thermopylae the Spartan king, Leonidas, waited for the Persians.  Xerxes sent a summons asking the Greeks to surrender their arms.  \"Come and take them,\" said Leonidas.  Then wave after wave of Persians rushed to the attack, only to break against the dauntless Greeks.  At last a vile traitor told Xerxes of another pass (which the Greeks had not men enough to hold, though it was on their flank).  He thus got the chance of forcing them either to retreat or be cut off. Once through this pass the Persians overran the country; and all the Spartans at Thermopylae died fighting to the last.  Only the Grecian fleet remained.  It was vastly out-numbered by the Persian fleet.  But it was manned by patriots trained to fight on the water; while the Persians themselves were nearly all landsmen, and so had to depend on the Phoenicians and colonial Greek seamen, who were none too eager for the fray.  Seeing the Persians too densely massed together on a narrow front the Greek"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19849"],["title","Flag and Fleet: How the British Navy Won the Freedom of the Seas (#3)"],["body","nder, Themistocles, attacked with equal skill and fury, rolled up the Persian front in confusion on the mass behind, and won the battle that saved the Western World.  The Persians lost two hundred vessels against only forty Greek.  But it was not the mere loss of vessels, or even of this battle of Salamis itself, that forced Xerxes to give up all hopes of conquest.  The real reason was his having lost the command of the sea.  He knew that the victorious Greeks could now beat the fighting ships escorting his supply vessels coming overseas from Asia Minor, and that, without the constant supplies of men, arms, food, and everything else an army needs, his army itself must wither away.  Two hundred and twenty years later the sea-power of the Roman West beat both the land- and sea-power of the Carthaginian East; and for the very same reason.  Carthage was an independent colony of Phoenicians which had won an empire in the western Mediterranean by its sea-power.  It held a great part of Spain, the whole of Sardinia, most of Sicily, and many other islands.  The Romans saw that they would never be safe as long as Carthage had the stronger navy; so they began to build one of their own.  They copied a Carthaginian war galley that had been wrecked; and meanwhile taught their men to row on benches set up ashore.  This made the Carthaginians laugh and led them to expect an easy victory.  But the Romans were thorough in everything they did, and they had the best trained soldiers in the world.  They knew the Carthaginians could handle war galleys better than they could themselves; so they tried to give their soldiers the best possible chance when once the galleys closed.  They made a sort of drawbridge that could be let down with a bang on the enemy boats and there held fast by sharp iron spikes biting into the enemy decks.  Then their soldiers charged across and cleared everything before them.  [Illustration: ROMAN TRIREME--A vessel with three benches of oars]  The Carthaginians never recovered from this first fatal defeat at Mylae in 260 B.C., though Carthage itself was not destroyed for more than a century afterwards, and though Hannibal, one of the greatest soldiers who ever lived, often beat the Romans in the meantime.  All sorts of reasons, many of them true enough in their way, are given for Hannibal's final defeat.  But sea-power, the first and greatest of all, is commonly left out.  His march round the shores of the western Mediterranean and his invasion of Italy from across the Alps will remain one of the wonders of war till the end of history.  But the mere fact that he had to go all the way round by land, instead of straight across by water, was the real prime cause of his defeat.  His forces simply wore themselves out.  Why?  Look at the map and you will see that he and his supplies had to go much farther by land than the Romans and their supplies had to go by water because the Roman victory over the Carthaginian fleet had made the shortest seaways safe for Romans and very unsafe for Carthaginians.  Then remember that carrying men and supplies by sea is many times easier than carrying them by land; and you get the perfect answer.     CHAPTER IV  CELTIC BRITAIN UNDER ROME  (55 B.C.-410 A.D.)  When Caesar was conquering the Celts of Western France he found that one of their strongest tribes, the Veneti, had been joined by two hundred and twenty vessels manned by their fellow-Celts from southern Britain.  The united fleets of the Celts were bigger than any Roman force that Caesar could get afloat.  Moreover, Caesar had nothing but rowboats, which he was obliged to build on the spot; while the Celts had real ships, which towered above his rowboats by a good ten feet. But, after cutting the Celtic rigging with scythes lashed to poles, the well-trained Roman soldiers made short work of the Celts.  The Battle of the Loire seems to have been the only big sea fight the Celts of Britain ever fought.  After this they left the sea to their invaders, who thus had a great advantage over them ashore.  The fact is that the Celts of the southern seaports were the only ones who understood shipbuilding, which they had learnt from the Phoenicians, and the only ones who were civilized enough to unite among themselves and with their fellow-Celts in what now is France but then was Gaul.  The rest were mere tribesmen under chiefs who were often squabbling with one another, and who never formed anything like an all-Celtic army.  For most of them a navy was out of the question, as they only used the light, open-work, basket-like coracles covered with skins--about as useful for fighting the Romans at sea as bark canoes would be against real men-of-war.  The Roman conquest of Britain was therefore made by the army, each conqueror, from Caesar on, winning battles farther and farther north, until a fortified Roman wall was built across the narrow neck of land between the Forth and Clyde. Along these thirty-six miles the Romans kept guard against the Picts and other Highland tribes.  The Roman fleet was of course used at all times to guard the seaways between Britain and the rest of the Roman Empire, as well as to carry supplies along the coast when the army was fighting near by.  This gave the Romans the usual immense advantage of sea-transport over land-transport, never less than ten to one and often very much more. The Romans could thus keep their army supplied with everything it needed.  The Celts could not.  Eighteen hundred years after Caesar's first landing in Britain, Wolfe, the victor of Quebec, noticed the same immense advantage enjoyed by King George's army over Prince Charlie's, owing to the same sort of difference in transport, King George's army having a fleet to keep it well supplied, while Prince Charlie's had nothing but slow and scanty land transport, sometimes more dead than alive.  The only real fighting the Romans had to do afloat was against the Norsemen, who sailed out of every harbour from Norway round to Flanders and swooped down on every vessel or coast settlement they thought they had a chance of taking.  To keep these pirates in check Carausius was made \"Count of the Saxon Shore\".  It was a case of setting a thief to catch a thief; for Carausius was a Fleming and a bit of a pirate himself.  He soon became so strong at sea that he not only kept the other Norsemen off but began to set up as a king on his own account. He seized Boulogne, harried the Roman shipping on the coasts of France, and joined forces with those Franks whom the Romans had sent into the Black Sea to check the Scythians and other wild tribes from the East. The Franks were themselves Norsemen, who afterwards settled in Gaul and became the forefathers of the modern French.  So Rome was now threatened by a naval league of hardy Norsemen, from the Black Sea, through the Mediterranean, and all the way round to that \"Saxon Shore\" of eastern Britain which was itself in danger from Norsemen living on the other side of the North Sea.  Once more, however, the Romans won the day.  The Emperor Constantius caught the Franks before they could join Carausius and smashed their fleet near Gibraltar.  He then went to Gaul and made ready a fleet at the mouth of the Seine, near Le Havre, which was a British base during the Great War against the Germans. Meanwhile Carausius was killed by his second-in-command, Allectus, who sailed from the Isle of Wight to attack Constantius, who himself sailed for Britain at the very same time.  A dense fog came on.  The two fleets never met.  Constantius landed.  Allectus then followed him ashore and was beaten and killed in a purely land battle.  This was a little before the year 300; by which time the Roman Empire was beginning to rot away, because the Romans were becoming softer and fewer, and because they were hiring more and more strangers to fight for them, instead of keeping up their own old breed of first-class fighting men.  By 410 Rome itself was in such danger that they took their last ships and soldiers away from Celtic Britain, which at once became the prey of the first good fighting men who came that way; because the Celts, never united enough to make a proper army or navy of their own, were now weaker than ever, after having had their country defended by other people for the last four hundred years.     CHAPTER V  THE HARDY NORSEMAN  (449-1066)  The British Empire leads the whole world both in size and population. It ended the Great War with the greatest of all the armies, the greatest of all the navies, and the greatest of all the mercantile marines.  Better still, it not only did most towards keeping its own--which is by far the oldest--freedom in the world, but it also did most towards helping all its Allies to be free.  There are many reasons why we now enjoy these blessings.  But there are three without which we never could have had a single one.  The first, of course, is sea-power. But this itself depends on the second reason, which, in its turn, depends upon the third.  For we never could have won the greatest sea-power unless we had bred the greatest race of seamen.  And we never could have bred the greatest race of seamen unless we ourselves had been mostly bred from those hardy Norsemen who were both the terror and the glory of the sea.  Many thousands of years ago, when the brown and yellow peoples of the Far South-East were still groping their way about their steamy Asian rivers and hot shores, a race of great, strong, fair-haired seamen was growing in the North.  This Nordic race is the one from which most English-speaking people come, the one whose blood runs in the veins of most first-class seamen to the present day, and the one whose descendants have built up more oversea dominions, past and present, than have been built by all the other races, put together, since the world began.  To the sturdy Nordic stock belonged all who became famous as Vikings, Berserkers, and Hardy Norsemen, as well as all the"]]]
