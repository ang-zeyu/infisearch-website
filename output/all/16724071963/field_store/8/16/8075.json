Thus the hours passed.  By one o'clock Frank was far ahead of the game, but he still played on, for he knew it would not seem right for him to propose stopping.  Dare, Harris and Winslow were nearly broken, but they still hung on, hoping for a turn in their direction.  Snell had plenty of money, for all that he had been the heaviest loser.  Finally there came a good-sized jackpot, which Dare opened.  Snell was the next man, and he promptly raised it fifty cents.  Winslow dropped out, and Hodge raised Snell fifty cents.  Then it came Frank's turn, and he simply staid in.  Harris was dealing, and he dropped out, while Dare simply \"made good.\"  This gave Snell his turn, and he \"boosted\" two dollars.  \"Whew!\" breathed Winslow.  \"That settles me.  I'm out.\"  Hodge was game, and he \"came up\" on a pair of nines.  Snell was watching Merriwell, and the latter quietly pushed in two dollars, which finished the betting till cards were drawn, as Dare dropped out, after some deliberation.  \"How many?\" asked Harris, of Snell.  \"Don't want any,\" was the calm reply.  Hodge took three, as also did Merriwell, which plainly indicated they had a pair each.  \"Snell has this pot in a canter,\" said Harris.  Snell bet five dollars, doing it in a way that seemed to say he was not risking anything.  Hodge dropped his nines, which he had not bettered, and that left Merriwell and Snell to fight it out.  \"This is why I object to a limit being taken off a game,\" said Frank. \"It spoils the fun, and makes it a clean case of gambling.\"  \"It's too late to make that kind of talk,\" sneered Snell.  \"You are in it now.  Do you call?\"  \"No,\" replied Frank, \"but I will see your five dollars, and put in another.\"  This created a stir, but Snell seemed delighted.  \"I admire your blood,\" he said, \"but the bluff won't go with me. Here's the five, and I will raise ten.\"  Now there was excitement.  Frank's cards lay face downward on the table, and every one was wondering what he could have found to go up against Snell's pat hand. He was wonderfully calm, as he turned to Bart, and asked:  \"Will you loan me something?\"  \"Every cent I have,\" was the instant reply, as Hodge took out a roll of bills and threw it on the table.  \"Use what you want.\"  There were thirty-five dollars in the roll.  Frank counted it over carefully, and then put it all into the pot, raising Snell twenty-five dollars!  When he saw this, Snell's nerve suddenly left him.  His face paled and his hands shook.  \"Whoever heard of such infernal luck as that fellow has!\" he grated. \"Held up a pair, and must have fours now!\"  Frank said not a word.  His face was quiet, and he seemed waiting for Snell to do something.  \"If you haven't the money to call him----\" began Harris.  \"I have,\" declared Snell; \"but what's the use.  A man can't beat fool-luck!  Here's my hand, and I'll allow I played it for all it is worth.\"  He threw the cards face upward on the table, and smothered exclamations of astonishment came from the boys.  His hand contained no more than a single pair of four-spots!  \"Then you do not mean to call me?\" asked Prank.  \"Of course not!  Think I'm a blooming idiot!\"  \"The pot is mine?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Well, I will allow I played this hand for all it is worth,\" said the winner, as he turned his cards over so all could see what they were.  Wat Snell nearly fainted.  Merriwell's hand was made up of a king, eight spot, five spot, and one pair of deuces!  It had been a game of bluff, and Frank Merriwell had won.     CHAPTER V.  FRANK'S REVELATION.  \"Great Caesar!\" gasped Harvey Dare.  \"Will you look at that!  That is what I call nerve for you!  That is playing, my boys!\"  Wat Snell rose slowly to his feet, his face very white.  \"It's robbery!\" came hoarsely from his lips.  \"Steady, Snell!\" warned Harvey Dare.  \"You were beaten at your own game--that's all.\"  Snell knew this, but it simply served to make his rage and chagrin all the deeper.  \"I am not a professional card player,\" he said, bitterly, \"and I am no match for a professional.\"  He was more deeply cut by the manner in which he had been beaten than by the loss of his money.  \"Nor am I a professional,\" came quietly from Frank Merriwell's lips, as he quickly sorted from the pot the money he had placed therein.  \"I simply sized you up as on the bluff, and I was right.  I don't want your money, Snell; take it.  I set into this game for amusement, and not with the idea of beating anybody to any such extent as this.\"  Snell hesitated, and then the hot blood mounted quickly to his face, which had been so pale a few moments before.  \"No, I will not take the money!\" he grated.  \"I take the offer as an insult, Merriwell.\"  \"No insult is intended, I assure you.\"  Snell was shrewd enough to know he would stand little chance of getting into another game of poker with that company if he accepted the money, and so he made a desperate effort to control his rage and play the hypocrite.  \"I don't suppose you did mean the offer as an insult, Merriwell; and I presume I was too hasty.  I am rather quick at times, and, as Dare says, I was beaten at my own game, which made me hot.  You had nerve, Merriwell; take the money--keep it.\"  The words almost choked him, but he pretended to be quite sincere, although his heart was full of bitterness and a longing to \"get even.\"  It was some time before Frank could be persuaded to accept his winnings, and, when he did finally take it, he was resolved to return it quietly and secretly to Snell, at such a time that no one else could know anything of it.  This matter was scarcely settled when there came a peculiar rap on the door.  \"Who's that?\" asked Frank, in some alarm.  \"It's our sentinel,\" assured Harris.  \"His time on post is up.\"  The door opened, and Leslie Gage entered the room.  Gage had been Merriwell's bitter enemy at one time during the summer encampment, having made two dastardly attacks on Frank, who had been generous enough to rescue him from death after that, and had saved him from expulsion by refusing to give any testimony against him.  For all of this generosity on Merriwell's part, Gage still bore deep down in his heart a hatred for the plebe who had become so popular at the academy.  This he tried to keep concealed, pretending that he had changed into a friend and admirer.  \"Hello, Merriwell,\" he saluted.  \"Been having a little whirl with the boys?\"  \"I should say he has!\" replied Snell.  \"He has whirled me wrong end up, and I feel as if I am still twisted.\"  Then the whole play was explained to Gage, who chuckled over it, and complimented Frank on his nerve.  For all of this apparent restoration of good feeling, Frank was discerning enough to detect the insincerity of both Snell and Gage.  Gage had done his duty as guard, and there was no one on the watch now. None of the boys felt like taking the place, so it was decided to call the \"session\" over for that night.  \"You must come again, Merriwell,\" said Dare.  \"You have given us the sensation of the evening, and you must let Snell have a chance to get square.\"  \"Yes,\" said Snell, \"all I ask is a fair chance to get square.  If I fail, I won't say a word, and I'll acknowledge you are the best fellow. Let's shake hands, Merriwell, and call it quits for the time being.\"  \"That's the stuff!\" came from Sam Winslow.  \"Now everything is quiet on the Potomac again.\"  Frank shook hands with Snell, and a few moments later the boys began to slip from the room and skurry along the corridors to their rooms, which all reached without being challenged by the sentries.  Bart was filled with satisfaction and delight, and before getting into bed he whispered to Frank, not daring to speak aloud in that room:  \"That was the prettiest trick I ever saw!  And I was delighted to see you rub that fellow.  He hasn't done a thing to me but win every time I have held up a hand against him of late.\"  Frank said nothing, and had there been a light in the room, Bart would have seen that his face bore an expression that was anything but one of satisfaction.  Merriwell did not sleep well during the few hours before reveille.  His slumber was filled with dreams, and he muttered and moaned very often, awaking Hodge once or twice.  \"I guess he is still playing,\" thought Bart.  At reveille Frank was, as a rule, very prompt about springing out of bed and hurrying into his clothes and through his toilet.  On the morning after the game, however, he continued to sleep till Hodge awakened him by a fierce shaking.  \"Come, come, man!\" said Bart; \"turn out.  Are you going to let a little thing like last night break you up?\"  Frank got up wearily and stiffly.  \"I didn't sleep well,\" he said.  He was quite unlike his usual spirited self.  \"Get a brace on,\" urged Bart.  \"You want to be on hand at roll-call.\"  Finding it was necessary to \"get a brace on,\" Frank did so, and was able to leave the room in time to go rushing down the stairway and spring into ranks at the last second.  After breakfast, as Bart was sprucing up the room, and Frank was vainly trying to prepare himself for the first recitation, but simply sat staring in a bewildered way at the book he held, the former said:  \"You don't know what a slick trick you did last night, Merriwell!  Why, I'd given almost anything if I had been the one to soak Snell in that fashion.\"  Frank put down the book, and rose to his feet, pacing twice the length of the room.  All at once he stopped and faced Bart, and his voice was not steady, as he said:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19502"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Chums (#4)"],["body","  \"You didn't mean any harm, old man, but you did me a bad turn last night.\"  Bart stared, and asked:  \"How?\"  \"By taking me where I could sit into a game like that.  I am going to tell you something.  I have one great failing--one terrible fault that quite overshadows all my other failings and faults.  That is my passion for cards--or, to put it more strongly and properly, my passion for gambling.\"  Bart whistled.  \"You don't mean to say that you have a failing or a fault that you cannot govern, do you?\" he asked.  Frank put out one hand, and partly turned away.  Instantly Bart sprang forward and caught the hand, saying swiftly:  \"There, there, Merriwell--don't notice it!  I didn't mean anything. You are sensitive to-day.  Hang it all, man! do you think I want to hurt your feelings without cause!  I shouldn't have said it, for I see you are not yourself.\"  \"No, I am not,\" confessed Frank.  \"You know every fellow has a secret. I did not intend to tell mine.  I believe I was born with an intense passion for gambling.\"  \"And you cannot govern it?\"  \"Well, I have been able to do so during the past year.\"  \"Oh, you are all right; you have a strong mind and----\"  \"Every strong mind has a weak spot.  I began gaming by playing marbles, and the passion grew on me.  When I had money, I gambled for cents and nickels.  As I grew older, I learned to play cards, and I gambled for larger sums.  If I knew that a game was going on I would leave everything to get into it.  Once I 'appropriated' money from my mother's purse to gamble with.\"  Frank stopped.  His face crimsoned as he uttered the words, and he showed his deep shame and humiliation.  But he quickly added:  \"That was my first and last theft.  The shame and disgrace of exposure by my mother was nearly more than I could endure.  But she did not know I played cards for money.  Thank God! she never knew!  She died when I was twelve years old.  \"I never knew much about my father's business.  He was much away from home, and I saw him but little.  After mother's death, I went to live with my uncle.  Still I played cards for money, and the passion grew upon me.  A little more than a year ago I was rapidly developing into a young gambler.  Then came news of my father's sudden death in California, and I swore I would never play cards again.  Last night I broke my oath.\"  \"What was the cause of your father's death?\" asked Bart, by way of saying something.  \"He was shot over a game of cards in a gambling-house,\" replied Frank, hoarsely.     CHAPTER VI.  THE PLOT.  Wat Snell and Leslie Gage were roommates, and they certainly made a delectable pair.  Gage was naturally the leader, being the worse of the two.  He was a daring and reckless sort of fellow--one who would not stop at anything, and who would have recourse to almost any measure to gain his ends.  This revengeful fellow had never forgiven Merriwell for what he considered a great injury.  Gage had been the pitcher on the regular ball team, but, by superior skill, Merriwell had supplanted him.  That was enough to produce in Gage's heart a feeling of undying hatred for the successful plebe.  It made no difference that Frank had, in all probability, saved him from death after he had twice attempted to kill Merriwell.  Gage had been shrewd enough to see that he must dissemble if he would remain in the academy, and so he pretended to be repentant and to think Frank one of the finest fellows in the world, while his hatred and longing for \"revenge\" still lay hidden, black and hideous, in a secret corner of his heart.  Snell was quite a different sort of bad boy.  He regarded Gage as his superior, and he was ready to do almost anything for the fellow, but he could not imitate Leslie's daring, and he kept his own vileness so much concealed that many square, honest lads believed he was a really good fellow.  Bart Hodge had begun to think Snell was a sneak and bad, but he had no proof of it, and so he kept still.  Wat was in anything but a pleasant mood the day after the game of cards.  He flung things round the room in a way that caused Gage to regard him with wonder, as it was so much unlike the usual quiet, crafty roommate he knew.  \"What's the matter with you, Wat?\" he asked, in surprise.  \"You must be ill.  Go directly and place those things where they belong, for we never know when one of those blooming inspectors will pop in.  I am room orderly this week, and am going to have things kept straight, for I can't afford to take any more demerit.  My record is bad enough as it stands.\"  So, with a little grumbling, Wat went about and restored to order the things he had disarranged, but he could not help thinking how often, when he was room orderly, he had been obliged to follow Gage about, and gather up things he had displaced.  \"What's the matter?\" repeated Leslie, who suspected the truth.  \"You don't seem to feel well, old boy.\"  \"Oh, it's nothing,\" replied Wat.  \"I was thinking of last night.\"  \"And raising all this row because you happened to drop a dollar.  Why, that's the run of the cards.\"  \"Oh, it wasn't what I lost that made me mad.\"  \"Then what was it?\"  \"Why, I was thinking that that fellow Merriwell won.\"  \"And I presume you were thinking how he won the last pot, eh?\"  \"Yes\"--sullenly.  \"You don't love Merriwell a great deal?\"  \"I should say not!  I despise the fellow!\"  \"And you'd like to get square?\"  \"Wouldn't I!\"  \"I suppose you mean to do so?\"  \"If I ever get the chance--yes.\"  \"I fancy you are aware that I am not dead stuck on Merriwell myself?\"  \"Yes, I know.\"  \"I have an old score to settle with him, and I will settle it some way. I failed in one or two attempts to do him up, for----\"  \"You were altogether too bold, partner mine; and it's a wonder you were not expelled from the academy.  You would have been if Merriwell had blowed on you.\"  \"That's right, and he would have done so if he had known what was good for him.  He is soft!\"  \"In some things he may be soft, but you must acknowledge he is hard enough in others.  He has a way of coming on top in almost everything.\"  Gage could not deny this, and it made him angry to think of it.  \"You are right,\" he said, fiercely.  \"I suppose I was foolish to fight him in the way I did.  That big bully Bascomb got a hold on me, and he has been blackmailing me ever since.  Hang that fellow!  I'll choke the wind out of him yet!\"  A crafty look came to Snell's face, and he said:  \"There are ways to down a fellow without showing your hand.\"  \"I suppose so; but it usually takes too long to suit me.  I like to jump on an enemy at once, and do him up.\"  \"Well, I hope you are satisfied that Merriwell is the kind of a fellow who will not be jumped on that way?\"  \"It seems so.\"  \"Then it is possible you are ready to try some other method?\"  Their eyes met, and Wat grinned significantly.  \"How do you mean?\" asked Leslie, eagerly.  \"You have some kind of a scheme?\"  \"That fellow won some money off me, and I refused to take it back.  He must show up again, and give me a chance to square the score.  He is bound in honor not to refuse to do so.\"  \"That's right,\" nodded Gage.  \"Well, you are rather handy with the cards, and I reckon you will not find it hard to fleece him.\"  \"Oh, I can beat him out of his money, but that is poor satisfaction when you want to disgrace a fellow and drive him out of the school.\"  \"We'll find a way for that, if we can get him to following the game.\"  \"I don't know as I see how.\"  \"His parents are dead.\"  \"Well?\"  \"He is supported by a rich uncle, who sent him here to this school.\"  \"What of that?\"  \"His uncle gives him a regular allowance.  If Merriwell exceeds that allowance, there will be inquiries as to what he has done with his money.\"  \"I begin to see.\"  \"This uncle is a stern, crusty old fellow, and he would be furious if he should accidentally find out that his nephew is gambling.  The chances are about ten to one that he would take him out of Fardale and turn him adrift to hustle for himself.\"  Gage's eyes began to glitter, and the smile about his mouth was most unpleasant to see.  \"Snell,\" he said, \"you have a head on your shoulders!  You are a dandy schemer!  But how will this uncle find out that Merriwell has been gambling?\"  \"There are several ways for him to find it out.  If we can get hold of a few of Merriwell's IOU's, they might be sent to the uncle for collection.\"  \"I see; but first we must run him out of ready cash.\"  \"Of course.  By the time he has lost all his money, he will be eager to play to win it back.  We must lend him money, and take his IOU's.\"  \"We'll do it!\"  Gage jumped up, struck Snell a blow on the back, and then grasped his hand, giving it a shake.  \"We'll do it!\" he repeated.  \"Merriwell's goose is beautifully cooked!\"  Snell smiled in his crafty way.  \"I am glad you take to the scheme, for with your aid, there ought not to be any trouble in carrying it out.\"  \"Oh, we'll work it!  But how did you find out so much about Merriwell? That's what sticks me.  He has been sort of a mystery here, as none of the fellows knew exactly where he came from, or anything about his folks.\"  \"Oh, I took a fancy to get posted concerning him.  At first I didn't see how I was going to do so.  That was during camp, and Hans Dunnerwust tented with him then.  I cultivated the thick-headed Dutchman, and succeeded in getting into his good graces.  So I often visited Hans in the tent when Merriwell and Mulloy, that Irish clown, who thinks Merriwell the finest fellow in the world, were away.  I kept my eyes open, and one day I spotted a letter to Merriwell.  I swiped it instanter, and it helped me out, for it was from his uncle.\"  \"You're an artist in your line, Wat!\" exclaimed Leslie, approvingly.  \"That letter didn't give me all the information I desired,\" continued Snell, \"but I found I had a friend living in a town adjoining the one Merriwell hails from, so I wrote and asked him to find out a few things for me.  He rode over on his wheel, and"]]]
