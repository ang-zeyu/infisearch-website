A few minutes afterwards, the clock struck nine, and the doors were closed upon all but Captain Ellis and myself. Nothing was too good for us, and to the accompaniment of numerous cups of coffee, brought by Norah, we talked away till ten o'clock. Both the landlord and his wife walked out to our car with us, and continued to offer their regrets for the treatment which we had received.  By the time we got \"home\" we were fairly cooled off, and we went to bed that night with the proud feeling that we had saved the name of Canada.  Another time \"things went wrong\" was one Saturday afternoon when we took a half-day off. It was not that we needed the holiday from overwork, because, for two weeks, three of the four of us had been doing nothing. The fourth man, a captain of Highland descent, had, unlike the rest of us, really been working hard. Yet we all needed the holiday, for loafing anywhere is usually the hardest work in the world; but loafing on the edge of Salisbury Plain with little to see was work even harder than the hardest. Napoleon is said to have remarked that \"war is made up of short periods of intense activity followed by much longer periods of enforced idleness\" or something to that effect. Of the \"intense activity\" of war we as yet had had no experience but with \"enforced idleness,\" we were all too distressingly familiar. In civilian life we had been very busy men; and here we had been plunged into a world where for months at a time there was almost nothing to do--and what was worse, there was no place to go to and forget about it.  So, after a hard two-week's work doing nothing, we studied the map and decided that the sea was within easy range of our four-cylinder thirty. Accordingly we struck out for the sea, followed the track of the little river Avon, which flows past Salisbury Plain, through Amesbury and the ancient city of Salisbury and empties into the British channel at Christchurch.  It was a glorious March afternoon, with intervals of brilliant sunshine; the roads were good, and we rolled along through the little English villages with their thatched-roofs, at a speed which quickly brought us to the New Forest. All of a sudden a strange, familiar tang in the air thrilled us. Every man sat instantly erect and gulped down, in wonderment at his own action, a succession of great, deep satisfying breaths: And then the explanation broke from two of us at the same moment, \"Canada!\" It was the familiar Canadian smell of the autumn forest fires that had for the moment penetrated from the outward senses to the inmost soul of each and it left us for the moment just the least bit homesick.  Less than an hour and a half brought us to the prosperous city of Bournemouth, filled with the omnipresent \"Tommy.\" The sea looked mighty good to us, for we hadn't seen it since our landing in October, though we had seen plenty of water--rain water--since. We raced our car along the beach, got out and snapshotted one another, admired the views, and cut up generally like a gang of boys let loose from school. Then somebody said \"tea,\" and we drove to a little rather suspicious looking \"Pub\" on the beach.  There we got tea and toast but we didn't stay long, for out of the window we could see the chauffeur under-cross-fire of a policeman, and in England that always means trouble.  An itinerant dog fancier had two diminutive \"Norwegian truffle 'unters\" which he was anxious to part with, but we couldn't wait to talk to him. Nor had we time to ask him whether truffle growing was an industry in Norway, or whether the substituting of dogs for pigs in hunting truffles was a recent innovation.  The Cop had been watching for us from across the way, and we were hardly out when he was already upon us. \"Excuse me, sir, but you 'aven't a hidentification number on your car\" said the Cop.  \"We have not\" I replied, \"what is the sense of having a number?\"  \"To hidentify the car, sir,\" said the Cop.  \"Can't you identify the car with that label on\" I queried, pointing to the bonnet upon which was a label reading: _Canadian Government_; the car also had three O.H.M.S. signs upon it.  \"Our orders is, sir, to see that all cars on 'is Majesty's service 'ave Hidentification numbers\" persisted the Cop.  \"We are very sorry,\" I replied, \"that we had our identification all printed out so that you could read it, instead of getting a number; it was stupid of us.\"  \"Orders is orders\" said the Cop.  \"You people make me sick\" suddenly broke in Mac. \"We came over here to fight for you and all you do for us is make it as damned disagreeable as possible; you are a miserable people.\"  \"Pardon me, sir\" said the Cop softly, \"I thought I was speaking to a gentleman.\" During the controversy we had got into our car and without ceremony we drove off, leaving behind us a discomfited policeman. Fortunately Mac had not heard the parting remark of the policeman. Had he done so it is doubtful if we would have left Bournemouth that night, for heaven only knows what would have happened to that policeman. When I chaffed him by repeating the policeman's sally when we were a mile away, Mac was for a moment knocked speechless with anger, then he begged us to go back and help him find the policeman.  Having escaped the arm of the law we went for a little drive about town, with its wonderful shops: the shops of Bournemouth are the best I have seen in England, and are rivalled only by those of Glasgow. Then we drew up at the best hotel in town--\"The Royal Bath Hotel,\" which, with its long low facade and its lack of upper stories looked more like a luxurious club house than a modern hotel.  The main lounge was something to marvel at. Apparently it had been given over to a band of decorators and furnishers gone delirious, for the evidence of their delirium was to be seen on every side. The walls were all broken up: One wall was covered with hangings; two parts of the remainder had an upper border of hand-painted men in battle array; a glass wall through which the dining-room could be seen made a third; and the fourth was occupied by a balcony from which one descended scarlet carpeted stairways into the room.  The woodwork was a hideous golden-oak. The ceiling was broken by a series of beams radiating unevenly from one annular space, in all directions, and with no apparent design. The furniture was rattan and plush, upholstered and plain, and was crowded together with a few writing tables scattered here and there. It was a discordant orgie of decorative effects and the result was unutterably depressing.  We sank into chairs and gazed about us in awe. No hotel had ever affected any of us like this before. At first we talked in whispers; then as our courage revived, we became critical. Then somebody thought of having a \"Scoot\"; tremulously he pressed the button for the waiter. The waiter came and they had two \"Scoots\" each. Then somebody made a funny remark and one of us laughed out loud. Suddenly the laugher stopped and said, \"I feel as if I ought not to laugh; I feel that nobody ever laughed in this place before.\"  Dinner time approached. Old ladies in wonderful dresses began to appear, followed by old English gentlemen in dress clothes. The dining-room began to fill up. We decided to wait till the room was nearly full before going in so that we could get an idea of the fashionable watering place people of England. Somebody thought that it would be as well to reserve a table, and Captain R---- was deputed to do so. In fifteen minutes he came back twisting his black moustache and looking depressed.  \"Nothing doing,\" he reported in disappointment.  \"What!\" we cried.  \"Nothing doing\" he repeated mechanically. \"We may possibly get a table after 8.30.\"  \"Do you mean to say\" cried Mac, jumping from his chair in a rage, \"that we can't get anything to eat?\" Captain R---- nodded. \"Let's leave this d---- morgue; I hate it anyway\" stormed Mac, and we filed sadly out.  In the hall we had a try with the head clerk, and another with the head waiter, but it was no use. \"Guests must be served first\" was the only argument; pointing out that there were a dozen tables yet unset made no difference. Our chauffeur had gone, so we left our address for him, ordered a taxi, and drove to the Burlington Hotel two miles away. Before dismissing the taxi we took the precaution of seeing that we could get dinner, and finding that the hotel authorities agreed to furnish us with a meal we clambered out; after divesting ourselves of our overcoats we were ushered into a dining room crowded with beautiful women and, mostly, ugly men. There were some hummers among the women.  The relief at the change from the dismal, deliriously-decorated hotel to this bright, cheery room, was so great that we suddenly grew exceedingly gay and enjoyed ourselves hugely. A little concert afterwards added to the enjoyment, which was only slightly marred by a bill for forty-two shillings.  Our homeward journey was through little villages all asleep, and silent as the adjacent churchyards; and as we two tumbled into our cots at midnight we voted that we had spent \"a fine day\" in spite of the mischievous tendency of things \"to go wrong.\"  Another of these \"days\" came later. We had been waiting at Bulford Cottage for three weeks for orders from the war office to leave for France, and we were growing decidedly fidgety. The fine weather feeling of Spring in the air may have had something to do with our restlessness. The buds were swelling on the great trees near by, and the leaves had actually broken from their bonds on some of the hedges. The air was full of bird songs; the lark in particular seemed to be mad with the joy of springtime. At Bulford Manor I had picked the first wall-flowers in bloom in the open garden; Roman Hyacinths, Daffodils, Snowdrops, English daisies, and another little unfamiliar white flower were in blossom, and even the Japonica was bursting into scarlet against the sunny walls.

(Grünwald.)]  EXPLANATION OF THE COLORED ILLUSTRATIONS.  They contrast with each other in that the one (upper) is too red; the other, too pale. The upper represents appearances such as one gets with the laryngoscope when the subject has a very severe cold, or even inflammation of the larynx, including the central vocal bands. In this particular case, a young woman of twenty-five years of age, there was inflammation with a certain amount of weakness of the internal thyro-arytenoid muscles. Speaking was almost impossible, and such voice as was produced was of a very rough character. In the lower illustration we have the appearances presented in a man affected with tuberculosis of the lungs and larynx. The pallor of the larynx is characteristic. There is weakness of the internal thyro-arytenoid muscle on the right side, which results in imperfect tension of the vocal band on that side, so that the voice is uncertain and harsh. Such illustrations are introduced to impress the normal by contrast. The reader is strongly advised to compare these figures with others in the body of the work, especially those of Chapter VII.     PREFACE TO THE FOURTH REVISED AND ENLARGED EDITION.   In addition to certain emendations, etc., introduced throughout the work, I have thought it well to add a chapter in which the whole subject is treated in a broad and comprehensive way in the light of the latest scientific knowledge.  In this review the psychological aspects of the subject have not been neglected, and the whole has been related to practice to as great an extent as the character of the book permits.  It is significant that on both sides of the Atlantic there is a growing conviction that the foundations for speaking and singing as an art must be made as scientific as the state of our knowledge will permit.  THE AUTHOR.  January, 1913.     PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.   No preface to the Second Edition was written, so few were the changes that were made in the work, and the same might apply to this Third Edition. However, the fact that within a period of less than two years, a Second English and a Third American Edition have been called for, seems to the Author to be so conclusive an endorsement of the application of science to vocal art, that he may be entitled at least to express his gratification at the progress the cause, to which he has devoted his pen, is making. It would seem that the better portion at least of that public that is interested in the progress of vocal art has made up its mind that the time has come when sense and science must replace tradition and empiricism.  THE AUTHOR.  MONTREAL, September, 1908.     PREFACE.   The present work is based on a life study of the voice, and has grown out of the conviction that all teaching and learning in voice-culture, whether for the purposes of singing or speaking, should as far as possible rest on a scientific foundation.  The author, believing that practice and principles have been too much separated, has endeavored to combine them in this book. His purpose has not been to write an exhaustive work on vocal physiology, with references at every step to the views of various authors; rather has he tried always to keep in mind the real needs of the practical voice-user, and to give him a sure foundation for the principles that must underlie sound practice. A perusal of the first chapter of the work will give the reader a clearer idea of the author's purpose as briefly expressed above.  The writer bespeaks an unprejudiced hearing, being convinced that in art as in all else there is but one ultimate court of appeal: to the scientific, the demonstrable--to what lies at the very foundations of human nature.  In conclusion, the author desires to thank those publishers and authors who have kindly permitted the use of their illustrations.  THE AUTHOR.  MCGILL UNIVERSITY, Montreal, October, 1906.
