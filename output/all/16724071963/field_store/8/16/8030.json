The widow was very grateful for these articles, and no false pride prevented her from accepting the gift of her rich and kind-hearted neighbor.  Riverdale Centre was largely engaged in the manufacturing of boots and shoes, and this business gave employment to a large number of men and women.  Mrs. Bright had for several years \"closed\" shoes--which, my readers who do not live in \"shoe towns\" may not know, means sewing or stitching them. To this business she applied herself with renewed energy. There was a large hotel in Riverdale Centre, where several families from Boston spent the summer. By the aid of Squire Lee, she obtained the washing of these families, which was more profitable than closing shoes.  By these means she not only supported her family very comfortably, but was able to save a little money towards paying for the house. Mr. Hardhand, by the persuasions of Squire Lee, had consented to let the widow keep the house, and pay for it as she could.  John Bright had been dead four years at the time we introduce Bobby to the reader. Mrs. Bright had paid another hundred dollars towards the house, with the interest; so there was now but one hundred due. Bobby had learned to \"close,\" and helped his mother a great deal; but the confinement and the stooping posture did not agree with his health, and his mother was obliged to dispense with his assistance. But the devoted little fellow found a great many ways of helping her. He was now thirteen, and was as handy about the house as a girl. When he was not better occupied, he would often go to the river and catch a mess of fish, which was so much clear gain.  The winter which had just passed had brought a great deal of sickness to the little black house. The children all had the measles, and two of them the scarlet fever, so that Mrs. Bright could not work much. Her affairs were not in a very prosperous condition when the spring opened; but the future was bright, and the widow, trusting in Providence, believed that all would end well.  One thing troubled her. She had not been able to save anything for Mr. Hardhand. She could only pay her interest; but she hoped by the first of July to give him twenty-five dollars of the principal. But the first of July came, and she had only five dollars of the sum she had partly promised her creditor. She could not so easily recover from the disasters of the hard winter, and she had but just paid off the little debts she had contracted. She was nervous and uneasy as the day approached. Mr. Hardhand always abused her when she told him she could not pay him, and she dreaded his coming.  It was the first of July on which Bobby caught those pouts, caught the horse, and on which Tom Spicer had \"caught a Tartar.\"  Bobby hastened home, as we said at the conclusion of the last chapter. He was as happy as a lord. He had fish enough in his basket for dinner, and for breakfast the next morning, and money enough in his pocket to make his mother as happy as a queen, if queens are always happy.  The widow Bright, though she had worried and fretted night and day about the money which was to be paid to Mr. Hardhand on the first of July, had not told her son anything about it. It would only make him unhappy, she reasoned, and it was needless to make the dear boy miserable for nothing; so Bobby ran home all unconscious of the pleasure which was in store for him.  When he reached the front door, as he stopped to scrape his feet on the sharp stone there, as all considerate boys who love their mothers do, before they go into the house, he heard the angry tones of Mr. Hardhand. He was scolding and abusing his mother because she could not pay him the twenty-five dollars.  Bobby's blood boiled with indignation, and his first impulse was to serve him as he had served Tom Spicer, only a few moments before; but Bobby, as we have before intimated, was a peaceful boy, and not disposed to quarrel with any person; so he contented himself with muttering a few hard words.  \"The wretch! What business has he to talk to _my_ mother in that style?\" said he to himself. \"I have a great mind to kick him out of the house.\"  But Bobby's better judgment came to his aid; and perhaps he realized that he and his mother would only get kicked out in return. He could battle with Mr. Hardhand, but not with the power which his wealth gave him; so, like a great many older persons in similar circumstances, he took counsel of prudence rather than impulse.  \"Bear ye one another's burdens,\" saith the Scripture; but Bobby was not old enough or astute enough to realize that Mr. Hardhand's burden was his wealth, his love of money; that it made him little better than a Hottentot; and he could not feel as charitably towards him as a Christian should towards his erring, weak brother.  Setting his pole by the door, he entered the room where Hardhand was abusing his mother.     CHAPTER IV  IN WHICH BOBBY GETS OUT OF ONE SCRAPE, AND INTO ANOTHER   Bobby was so indignant at the conduct of Mr. Hardhand, that he entirely forgot the adventure of the morning; and he did not even think of the gold he had in his pocket. He loved his mother; he knew how hard she had worked for him and his brother and sisters; that she had burned the \"midnight oil\" at her clamps; and it made him feel very bad to hear her abused as Mr. Hardhand was abusing her. It was not her fault that she had not the money to pay him. She had been obliged to spend a large portion of her time over the sick beds of her children, so that she could not earn so much money as usual; while the family expenses were necessarily much greater.  Bobby knew also that Mr. Hardhand was aware of all the circumstances of his mother's position, and the more he considered the case the more brutal and inhuman was his course.  As our hero entered the family room with the basket of fish on his arm, the little crusty old man fixed the glance of his evil eye upon him.  \"There is that boy, marm, idling away his time by the river, and eating you out of house and home,\" said the wretch. \"Why don't you set him to work, and make him earn something?\"  \"Bobby is a very good boy,\" meekly responded the widow Bright.  \"Humph! I should think he was. A great lazy lubber like him, living on his mother!\" and Mr. Hardhand looked contemptuously at Bobby.  \"I am not a lazy lubber,\" interposed the insulted boy with spirit.  \"Yes, you are. Why don't you go to work?\"  \"I do work.\"  \"No, you don't; you waste your time paddling in the river.\"  \"I don't.\"  \"You had better teach this boy manners too, marm,\" said the creditor, who, like all men of small souls, was willing to take advantage of the power which the widow's indebtedness gave him. \"He is saucy.\"  \"I should like to know who taught _you_ manners, Mr. Hardhand,\" replied Bobby, whose indignation was rapidly getting the better of his discretion.  \"What!\" growled Mr. Hardhand, aghast at this unwonted boldness.  \"I heard what you said before I came in; and no decent man would go to the house of a poor woman to insult her.\"  \"Humph! Mighty fine,\" snarled the little old man, his gray eyes twinkling with malice.  \"Don't, Bobby; don't be saucy to the gentleman,\" interposed his mother.  \"Saucy, marm? You ought to horsewhip him for it. If you don't, I will.\"  \"No, you won't!\" replied Bobby, shaking his head significantly. \"I can take care of myself.\"  \"Did any one ever hear such impudence!\" gasped Mr. Hardhand.  \"Don't, Bobby, don't,\" pleaded the anxious mother.  \"I should like to know what right you have to come here and abuse my mother,\" continued Bobby, who could not restrain his anger.  \"Your mother owes me money, and she doesn't pay it, you young scoundrel!\" answered Mr. Hardhand, foaming with rage.  \"That is no reason why you should insult her. You can call _me_ what you please, but you shall not insult my mother while I'm round.\"  \"Your mother is a miserable woman, and----\"  \"Say that again, and though you are an old man, I'll hit you for it. I'm big enough to protect my mother, and I'll do it.\"  Bobby doubled up his fists and edged up to Mr. Hardhand, fully determined to execute his threat if he repeated the offensive expression, or any other of a similar import. He was roused to the highest pitch of anger, and felt as though he had just as lief die as live in defence of his mother's good name.  I am not sure that I could excuse Bobby's violence under any other circumstances. He loved his mother--as the novelists would say, he idolized her; and Mr. Hardhand had certainly applied some very offensive epithets to her--epithets which no good son could calmly hear applied to a mother. Besides, Bobby, though his heart was a large one, and was in the right place, had never been educated into those nice distinctions of moral right and wrong which control the judgment of wise and learned men. He had an idea that violence, resistance with blows, was allowable in certain extreme cases; and he could conceive of no greater provocation than an insult to his mother.  \"Be calm, Bobby; you are in a passion,\" said Mrs. Bright.  \"I am surprised, marm,\" began Mr. Hardhand, who prudently refrained from repeating the offensive language--and I have no doubt he was surprised; for he looked both astonished and alarmed. \"This boy has a most ungovernable temper.\"  \"Don't you worry about my temper, Mr. Hardhand; I'll take care of myself. All I want of you is not to insult my mother. You may say what you like to me; but don't you call her hard names.\"  Mr. Hardhand, like all mean, little men, was a coward; and he was effectually intimidated by the bold and manly conduct of the boy. He changed his tone and manner at once.  \"You have no money for me, marm?\" said he, edging towards the door.  \"No, sir; I am sorry to say that I have been able to save only five dollars since I paid you last; but I hope----\"  \"Never mind, marm, never mind; I shall not trouble myself to come here again, where I am liable to be kicked by this ill-bred cub. No, marm,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19473"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright (#4)"],["body"," shall not come again. Let the law take its course.\"  \"O, mercy! See what you have brought upon us, Bobby,\" exclaimed Mrs. Bright, bursting into tears.  \"Yes, marm, let the law take its course.\"  \"O, Bobby! Stop a moment, Mr. Hardhand; do stop a moment.\"  \"Not a moment, marm. We'll see;\" and Mr. Hardhand placed his hand upon the latch string.  Bobby felt very uneasy and very unhappy at that moment. His passion had subsided, and he realized that he had done a great deal of mischief by his impetuous conduct.  Then the remembrance of his morning adventure on the bridge came like a flash of sunshine to his mind, and he eagerly drew from his pocket the handkerchief in which he had deposited the precious gold,--doubly precious now, because it would enable him to retrieve the error into which he had fallen, and do something towards relieving his mother's embarrassment. With a trembling hand he untied the knot which secured the money.  \"Here, mother, here is thirty-five dollars;\" and he placed it in her hand.  \"Why, Bobby!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bright.  \"Pay him, mother, pay him, and I will tell you all about it by and by.\"  \"Thirty-five dollars! and all in gold! Where _did_ you get it, Bobby?\"  \"Never mind it now, mother.\"  Mr. Hardhand's covetous soul had already grasped the glittering gold; and removing his hand from the latch string, he approached the widow.  \"I shall be able to pay you forty dollars now,\" said Mrs. Bright, taking the five dollars she had saved from her pocket.  \"Yes, marm.\"  Mr. Hardhand took the money, and seating himself at the table, indorsed the amount on the back of the note.  \"You owe me sixty more,\" said he, maliciously, as he returned the note to his pocket book. \"It must be paid immediately.\"  \"You must not be hard with me now, when I have paid more than you demanded.\"  \"I don't wish to come here again. That boy's impudence has put me all out of conceit with you and your family,\" replied Mr. Hardhand, assuming the most benevolent look he could command. \"There was a time when I was very willing to help you. I have waited a great while for my pay for this house; a great deal longer than I would have waited for anybody else.\"  \"Your interest has always been paid punctually,\" suggested the widow, modestly.  \"That's true; but very few people would have waited as long as I have for the principal. I wanted to help you----\"  \"By gracious!\" exclaimed Bobby, interrupting him.  \"Don't be saucy, my son, don't,\" said Mrs. Bright, fearing a repetition of the former scene.  \"_He_ wanted to help us!\" ejaculated Bobby.  It was a very absurd and hypocritical expression on the part of Mr. Hardhand; for he never wanted to help any one but himself; and during the whole period of his relations with the poor widow, he had oppressed, insulted, and abused her to the extent of his capacity, or at least as far as his interest would permit.  He was a malicious and revengeful man. He did not consider the great provocation he had given Bobby for his violent conduct, but determined to be revenged, if it could be accomplished without losing any part of the sixty dollars still due him. He was a wicked man at heart, and would not scruple to turn the widow and her family out of house and home.  Mrs. Bright knew this, and Bobby knew it too; and they felt very uneasy about it. The wretch still had the power to injure them, and he would use it without compunction.  \"Yes, young man, I wanted to help you, and you see what I get for it--contempt and insults! You will hear from me again in a day or two. Perhaps you will change your tune, you young reprobate!\"  \"Perhaps I shall,\" replied Bobby, without much discretion.  \"And you too, marm; you uphold him in his treatment of me. You have not done your duty to him. You have been remiss, marm!\" continued Mr. Hardhand, growing bolder again, as he felt the power he wielded.  \"That will do, sir; you can go!\" said Bobby, springing from his chair, and approaching Mr. Hardhand. \"Go, and do your worst!\"  \"Humph! you stump me,--do you?\"  \"I would rather see my mother kicked out of the house than insulted by such a dried-up old curmudgeon as you are. Go along!\"  \"Now, don't, Bobby,\" pleaded his mother.  \"I am going; and if the money is not paid by twelve o'clock to-morrow, the law shall take its course;\" and Mr. Hardhand rushed out of the house, slamming the door violently after him.  \"O, Bobby, what have you done?\" exclaimed Mrs. Bright, when the hard-hearted creditor had departed.  \"I could not help it, mother; don't cry. I cannot bear to hear you insulted and abused; and I thought when I heard him do it a year ago, that I couldn't stand it again. It is too bad.\"  \"But he will turn us out of the house; and what shall we do then?\"  \"Don't cry, mother; it will come round all right. I have friends who are rich and powerful, and who will help us.\"  \"You don't know what you say, Bobby. Sixty dollars is a great deal of money, and if we should sell all we have, it would scarcely bring that.\"  \"Leave it all to me, mother; I feel as though I could do something now. I am old enough to make money.\"  \"What can you do?\"  \"Now or never!\" replied Bobby, whose mind had wandered from the scene to the busy world, where fortunes are made and lost every day. \"Now or never!\" muttered he again.  \"But, Bobby, you have not told me where you got all that gold.\"  \"Dinner is ready, I see, and I will tell you while we eat.\"  Bobby had been a fishing, and to be hungry is a part of the fisherman's luck; so he seated himself at the table, and gave his mother a full account of all that had occurred at the bridge.  The fond mother trembled when she realized the peril her son had incurred for the sake of the young lady; but her maternal heart swelled with admiration in view of the generous deed, and she thanked God that she was the mother of such a son. She felt more confidence in him then than she had ever felt before, and she realized that he would be the stay and the staff of her declining years.  Bobby finished his dinner, and seated himself on the front door step. His mind was absorbed by a new and brilliant idea; and for half an hour he kept up a most tremendous thinking.  \"Now or never!\" said he, as he rose and walked down the road towards Riverdale Centre.     CHAPTER V  IN WHICH BOBBY GIVES HIS NOTE FOR SIXTY DOLLARS   A great idea was born in Bobby's brain. His mother's weakness and the insecurity of her position were more apparent to him than they had ever been before. She was in the power of her creditor, who might turn her out of the little black house, sell the place at auction, and thus, perhaps, deprive her of the whole or a large part of his father's and her own hard earnings.  But this was not the peculiar hardship of her situation, as her devoted son understood it. It was not the hard work alone which she was called upon to perform, not the coarseness of the fare upon which they lived, not the danger even of being turned out of doors, that distressed Bobby; it was that a wretch like Mr. Hardhand could insult and trample upon his mother. He had just heard him use language to her that made his blood boil with indignation, and he did not, on cool, sober, second thought, regret that he had taken such a decided stand against it.  He cared not for himself. He could live on a crust of bread and a cup of water from the spring; he could sleep in a barn; he could wear coarse and even ragged clothes; but he could not submit to have his mother insulted, and by such a mean and contemptible person as Mr. Hardhand.  Yet what could he do? He was but a boy, and the great world would look with contempt upon his puny form. But he felt that he was not altogether insignificant. He had performed an act that day, which the fair young lady, to whom he had rendered the service, had declared very few men would have undertaken. There was something in him, something that would come out, if he only put his best foot forward. It was a tower of strength within him. It told him that he could do wonders; that he could go out into the world and accomplish all that would be required to free his mother from debt, and relieve her from the severe drudgery of her life.  A great many people think they can \"do wonders.\" The vanity of some very silly people makes them think they can command armies, govern nations, and teach the world what the world never knew before and never would know but for them. But Bobby's something within him was not vanity. It was something more substantial. He was not thinking of becoming a great man, a great general, a great ruler, or a great statesman; not even of making a great fortune. Self was not the idol and the end of his calculations. He was thinking of his mother, and only of her; and the feeling within him was as pure, and holy, and beautiful as the dream of an angel. He wanted to save his mother from insult in the first place, and from a life of ceaseless drudgery in the second.  A legion of angels seemed to have encamped in his soul to give him strength for the great purpose in his mind. His was a holy and a true purpose, and it was this that made him think he could \"do wonders.\"  What Bobby intended to do the reader shall know in due time. It is enough now that he meant to do something. The difficulty with a great many people is, that they never resolve to do something. They wait for \"something to turn up;\" and as \"things\" are often very obstinate, they utterly refuse to \"turn up\" at all. Their lives are spent in waiting for a golden opportunity which never comes.  Now, Bobby Bright repudiated the Micawber philosophy. He would have nothing to do with it. He did not believe corn would grow without being planted, or that pouts would bite the bare hook.  I am not going to tell my young readers now how Bobby came out in the end; but I can confidently say that, if he had waited for \"something to turn up,\" he would have become a vagabond, a loafer, out of money, out at the elbows, and out of patience with himself"]]]
