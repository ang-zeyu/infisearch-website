The Germans, mystified that they should have run against a stone wall of defense just when they believed that their advance would be easiest, had halted, amazed; then prepared to defend the positions they had won with all the stubbornness possible.  In the black recesses of Belleau Wood the Germans had established nest after nest of machine guns.  There in the jungle of matted underbrush, of vines, of heavy foliage, they had placed themselves in positions they believed impregnable.  And this meant that unless they could be routed, unless they could be thrown back, the breaking of the attack of June 2 would mean nothing.  There would come another drive and another.  The battle of Château-Thierry was therefore not won and could not be won until Belleau Wood had been cleared of the enemy.  It was June 6 that the attack of the American troops began against that wood and its adjacent surroundings, with the wood itself and the towns of Torcy and Bouresches forming the objectives.  At 5 o'clock the attack came, and there began the tremendous sacrifices which the Marine Corps gladly suffered that the German fighters might be thrown back.  The marines fought strictly according to American methods--a rush, a halt, a rush again, in four-wave formation, the rear waves taking over the work of those who had fallen before them, passing over the bodies of their dead comrades and plunging ahead, until they, too, should be torn to bits.  But behind those waves were more waves and the attack went on.  \"Men fell like flies\"; the expression is that of an officer writing from the field.  Companies that had entered the battle 250 strong dwindled to fifty and sixty, with a sergeant in command; but the attack did not falter.  At 9:45 o'clock that night Bouresches was taken by Lieutenant James F. Robertson and twenty odd men of his platoon; these soon were joined by two reënforcing platoons.  Then came the enemy counter-attacks, but the marines held.  In Belleau Wood the fighting had been literally from trees to tree, stronghold to stronghold; and it was a fight which must last for weeks before its accomplishment in victory.  Belleau Wood was a jungle, its every rocky formation forming a German machine-gun nest, almost impossible to reach by artillery or grenade fire.  There was only one way to wipe out these nests--by the bayonet.  And by this method they were wiped out, for United States marines, bare chested, shouted their battle cry of \"E-e-e-e-e y-a-a-h-h-h-yip!\" charged straight into the murderous fire from those guns, and won!  Out of the number that charged, in more than one instance, only one would reach the stronghold.  There, with his bayonet as his only weapon, he would either kill or capture the defenders of the nest, and then swinging the gun about in its position, turn it against the remaining German positions in the forest.  Such was the character of the fighting in Belleau Wood, fighting which continued until July 6, when after a short relief the invincible Americans finally were taken back to the rest billet for recuperation.  In all the history of the Marine Corps there is no such battle as that one in Belleau Wood.  Fighting day and night without relief, without sleep, often without water, and for days without hot rations, the marines met and defeated the best divisions that Germany could throw into the line.  The heroism and doggedness of that battle are unparalleled.  Time after time officers seeing their lines cut to pieces, seeing their men so dog tired that they even fell asleep under shell fire, hearing their wounded calling for the water that they were unable to supply, seeing men fight on after they had been wounded and until they dropped unconscious; time after time officers seeing these things, believing that the very limit of human endurance had been reached, would send back messages to their post command that their men were exhausted.  But in answer to this would come the word that the lines must hold, and, if possible, those lines must attack.  And the lines obeyed.  Without water, without food, without rest, they went forward--and forward every time to victory.  Companies had been so torn and lacerated by losses that they were hardly platoons, but they held their lines and advanced them.  In more than one case companies lost every officer, leaving a sergeant and sometimes a corporal to command, and the advance continued.  After thirteen days in this inferno of fire a captured German officer told with his dying breath of a fresh division of Germans that was about to be thrown into the battle to attempt to wrest from the marines that part of the wood they had gained.  The marines, who for days had been fighting only on their sheer nerve, who had been worn out from nights of sleeplessness, from lack of rations, from terrific shell and machine-gun fire, straightened their lines and prepared for the attack. It came--as the dying German officer had predicted.  At 2 o'clock on the morning of June 13 it was launched by the Germans along the whole front.  Without regard for men, the enemy hurled his forces against Bouresches and the Bois de Belleau, and sought to win back what had been taken from Germany by the Americans.  The orders were that these positions must be taken at all costs; that the utmost losses in men must be endured that the Bois de Belleau and Bouresches might fall again into German hands.  But the depleted lines of the marines held; the men who had fought on their nerve alone for days once more showed the mettle of which they were made.  With their backs to the trees and bowlders of the Bois de Belleau, with their sole shelter the scattered ruins of Bouresches, the thinning lines of the marines repelled the attack and crashed back the new division which had sought to wrest the position from them.  And so it went.  Day after day, night after night, while time after time messages like the following traveled to the post command:--  Losses heavy.  Difficult to get runners through.  Some have never returned.  Morale excellent, but troops about all in.  Men exhausted.   Exhausted, but holding on.  And they continued to hold on in spite of every difficulty.  Advancing their lines slowly day by day, the marines finally prepared their positions to such an extent that the last rush for the possession of the wood could be made.  Then, on June 24, following a tremendous barrage, the struggle began.  The barrage literally tore the woods to pieces, but even its immensity could not wipe out all the nests that remained, the emplacements that were behind almost every clump of bushes, every jagged, rough group of bowlders.  But those that remained were wiped out by the American method of the rush and  the bayonet, and in the days that followed every foot of Belleau Wood was cleared of the enemy and held by the frayed lines of the Americans.  It was, therefore, with the feeling of work well done that the depleted lines of the marines were relieved in July, that they might be filled with replacements and made ready for the grand offensive in the vicinity of Soissons, July 18.  And in recognition of their sacrifice and bravery this praise was forthcoming from the French:--  Army Headquarters, June 30, 1918.  In view of the brilliant conduct of the Fourth Brigade of the Second United States Division, which in a spirited fight took Bouresches and the important strong point of Bois de Belleau, stubbornly defended by a large enemy force, the General commanding the Sixth Army orders that henceforth, in all official papers, the Bois de Belleau shall be named \"Bois de la Brigade de Marine.\"  DIVISION GENERAL DEGOUTTE,   Commanding Sixth Army.   On July 18 the marines were again called into action in the vicinity of Soissons, near Tigny and Vierzy.  In the face of a murderous fire from concentrated machine guns, which contested every foot of their advance, the United States marines moved forward until the severity of their casualties necessitated that they dig in and hold the positions they had gained.  Here, again, their valor called forth official praise.  Then came the battle for the St. Mihiel salient.  On the night of Sept. 11 the 2d Division took over a line running from Remenauville to Limey, and on the night of Sept. 14 and the morning of Sept. 15 attacked, with two days' objectives ahead of them.  Overcoming the enemy resistance, they romped through to the Rupt de Mad, a small river, crossed it on stone bridges, occupied Thiacourt, the first day's objective, scaled the heights just beyond it, pushed on to a line running from the Zammes-Joulney Ridges to the Binvaux Forest, and there rested, with the second day's objectives occupied by 2:50 o'clock of the first day.  The casualties of the division were about 1000, of which 134 were killed. Of these, about half were marines.  The captures in which the marines participated were 80 German officers, 3200 men, ninety-odd cannon, and vast stores.  But even further honors were to befall the fighting, landing, and building force, of which the navy is justly proud.  In the early part of October it became necessary for the Allies to capture the bald, jagged ridge twenty miles due east of Rheims, known as Blanc Mont Ridge.  Here the armies of Germany and the Allies had clashed more than once, and attempt after attempt had been made to wrest it from German hands.  It was a keystone of the German defense, the fall of which would have a far-reaching effect upon the enemy armies.  To the glory of the United States marines, let it be said, that they were again a part of that splendid 2d Division which swept forward in the attack which freed Blanc Mont Ridge from German hands, pushed its way down the slopes, and occupied the level ground just beyond, thus assuring a victory, the full import of which can best be judged by the order of General Lejeune, following the battle:--  France, Oct. 11, 1918.  Officers and Men of the 2d Division:--  It is beyond my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19906"],["title","Winning a Cause: World War Stories (#8)"],["body","of expression to describe fitly my admiration for your heroism.  You attacked magnificently and you seized Blanc Mont Ridge, the keystone of the arch constituting the enemy's main position. You advanced beyond the ridge, breaking the enemy's lines, and you held the ground gained with a tenacity which is unsurpassed in the annals of war.  As a direct result of your victory, the German armies east and west of Rheims are in full retreat, and by drawing on yourselves several German divisions from other parts of the front you greatly assisted the victorious advance of the Allied armies between Cambrai and St. Quentin.  Your heroism and the heroism of our comrades who died on the battlefield will live in history forever, and will be emulated by the young men of our country for generations to come.  To be able to say when this war is finished, \"I belonged to the 2d Division; I fought with it at the battle of Blanc Mont Ridge,\" will be the highest honor that can come to any man.  JOHN A. LEJEUNE,   Major General, United States Marine Corps, Commanding.   Thus it is that the United States marines have fulfilled the glorious traditions of their corps in this their latest duty as the \"soldiers who go to sea.\"  Their sharpshooting--and in one regiment 93 per cent of the men wear the medal of a marksman, a sharpshooter, or an expert rifleman--has amazed soldiers of European armies, accustomed merely to shooting in the general direction of the enemy.  Under the fiercest fire they have calmly adjusted their sights, aimed for their man, and killed him, and in bayonet attacks their advance on machine-gun nests has been irresistible.  In the official citation lists more than one American marine is credited with taking an enemy machine gun single handed, bayoneting its crew and then turning the gun against the foe.  In one battle alone, that of Belleau Wood, the citation lists bear the names of fully 500 United States marines who so distinguished themselves in battle as to call forth the official commendation of their superior officers.  More than faithful in every emergency, accepting hardships with admirable morale, proud of the honor of taking their place as shock troops for the American legions, they have fulfilled every glorious tradition of their corps, and they have given to the world a list of heroes whose names will go down to all history.     WHEN THE TIDE TURNED  THE AMERICAN ATTACK AT CHÂTEAU-THIERRY AND BELLEAU WOOD IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE, 1918  BY OTTO H. KAHN  AN ADDRESS AT THE UNITED WAR WORK CAMPAIGN MEETING OF THE BOSTON ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION, NOVEMBER 12, 1918  WHY THE TIDE WAS FATED TO TURN   These are soul-stirring days.  To live through them is a glory and a solemn joy.  The words of the poet resound in our hearts: \"God's in His heaven, all's right with the world.\"  Events have shaped themselves in accordance with the eternal law.  Once again the fundamental lesson of all history is borne in upon the world, that evil--though it may seem to triumph for a while--carries within it the seed of its own dissolution.  Once again it is revealed to us that the God-inspired soul of man is unconquerable and that the power, however formidable, which challenges it is doomed to go down in defeat.  A righteous cause will not only stand unshaken through trials and discomfiture, but it will draw strength from the very setbacks which it may suffer.  A wrongful cause can only stand as long as it is buoyed up by success.  The German people were sustained by a sheer obsession akin to the old-time belief in the potent spell of \"the black arts\" that their military masters were invulnerable and invincible, that by some power--good or evil, they did not care which--they had been made so, and that the world was bound to fall before them.  The nation was immensely strong only as long as that obsession remained unshaken.  With its destruction by a series of defeats which were incapable of being explained as \"strategic retreats,\" their morale crumbled and finally collapsed, because it was not sustained, as that of the Allies was sustained in the darkest days of the war, by the faith that they were fighting for all that men hold most sacred.  To those who were acquainted with German mentality and psychology, it had been manifest all along that when the end foreordained did come, it would come with catastrophic suddenness.   WHERE THE TIDE TURNED  It is the general impression that the tide of victory set in with Marshal Foch's splendid movement against the German flank on July 18th. That movement, it is true, started the irresistible sweep of the wave which was destined to engulf and destroy the hideous power of Prussianism.  But the tide which gathered and drove forward the waters out of which that wave arose, had turned before.  It turned with and through the supreme valor of our marines and other American troops in the _first_ battle at Château-Thierry and at Belleau Wood, _in the first week of June_.  The American force engaged was small, measured by the standard of numbers to which we have become accustomed in this war, but the story of their fighting will remain immortal and in its psychological and strategic consequences the action will take rank, I believe, among the decisive battles of the war.  I am not speaking from hearsay.  I was in France during the week preceding that battle, the most anxious and gloomy period, probably, of the entire war.  What I am about to relate is based either on authoritative information gathered on the spot, or on my own observations.  In telling it, nothing is farther from my thoughts than to wish to take away one tittle from the immortal glory which belongs to the Allied armies, nor from the undying gratitude which we owe to the nations who for four heart-breaking years, with superb heroism, fought the battle of civilization--our battle from the very beginning, no less than theirs--and bore untold sacrifices with never faltering spirit.   JUST BEFORE THE TIDE TURNED  On the 27th of last May the Germans broke through the French position at the Chemin des Dames, a position which had been considered by the Allies as almost impregnable.  They overthrew the French as they had overthrown the British two months earlier.  Day by day they came nearer to Paris, until only thirty-nine miles separated them from their goal. A few days more at the same rate of advance, and Paris was within range of the German guns of terrific destructive power.  Paris, the nerve center of the French railroad system and the seat of many French war industries, not only, but the very heart of France, far more to the French people in its meaning and traditions than merely the capital of the country; Paris in imminent danger of ruthless bombardment like Rheims, in possible danger even of conquest by the brutal invader, drunk with lust and with victory!  As one Frenchman expressed it to me: \"We felt in our faces the very breath of the approaching beast.\"  And whilst the Hunnish hordes came nearer and nearer, and the very roar of the battle could be dimly and ominously heard from time to time in Paris, there were air raids over the city practically every night, and the shells from the long-range monster guns installed some sixty or seventy miles distant fell on its houses, places, and streets almost every day.  They were not afraid, these superb men and women of France.  They do not know the meaning of fear in defense of their beloved soil and their sacred ideals.  There was no outward manifestation even of excitement or apprehension.  Calmly and resolutely they faced what destiny might bring.  But there was deep gloom in their hearts and dire forebodings.  They had fought and dared and suffered and sacrificed for well-nigh four years.  They had buried a million of their sons, brothers, and fathers.  They were bleeding from a million wounds and more.  They said: \"We will fight on to our last drop of blood, but alas! our physical strength is ebbing.  The enemy is more numerous by far than we.  Where can we look for aid?  The British have just suffered grave defeat.  The Italians have their own soil to defend after the disaster of last autumn.  Our troops are in retreat.  The Americans are not ready and they are untried as yet in the fierce ordeal of modern warfare.  The Germans know well that in three months or six months the Americans will be ready and strong in numbers.  That is why they are throwing every ounce of their formidable power against us _now_.  The Hun is at the gate _now_.  Immeasurable consequences are at stake _now_.  It is a question of days, not of weeks or months.  Where can we look for aid _now_?\"  And out of their nooks and corners and hiding places crawled forth the slimy brood of the Bolshevik-Socialists, of the Boloists, Caillauxists, and pacifists, and they hissed into the ears of the people, \"Make peace!  Victory has become impossible.  Why go on shedding rivers of blood uselessly?  The Germans will give you an honorable, even a generous peace.  Save Paris!  Make peace!\"  The holy wrath of France crushed those serpents whenever their heads became visible.  Clemenceau, the embodiment of the dauntless spirit of France, stood forth the very soul of patriotic ardor and indomitable courage.  But the serpents were there, crawling hidden in the grass, ever hissing, \"Make peace!\"  And then, suddenly out of the gloom flashed the lightning of a new sword, sharp and mighty, a sword which had never been drawn except for freedom, a sword which had never known defeat--the sword of America!   THE TURNING OF THE TIDE  A division of marines and other American troops were rushed to the front as a desperate measure to try and stop a gap where flesh and blood, even when animated by French heroism, seemed incapable of further resistance.  They came in trucks, in cattle cars, by any conceivable kind of conveyance, crowded together like sardines.  They had had little food, and less sleep, for days.  When they arrived, the"]]]
