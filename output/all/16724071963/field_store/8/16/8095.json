They had not realized how close they were to Ossining, and the thought of the great prison whose name they had often heard mentioned sobered them a little; the mere suggestion of one of its inmates scaling its frowning wall on such a night and setting forth in an open boat, perhaps lurking near their very shelter, cast a shadow over them.  \"Are you--are you _sure_ you didn't see a--a crouching shadow when you went out and got that gasoline can last night?\" Pee-wee stammered.  \"I'm sorry,\" said Roy, \"but I didn't see one crouching shadow.\"  \"His boat might have upset in the storm,\" Tom suggested. \"The wind even shook this boat; it must have been pretty rough out on the river.\"  \"Like enough,\" said the man. \"Des'pret characters'll take des'pret chances.\"  \"What did he do?\" Pee-wee asked, his imagination thoroughly aroused.  \"Dunno,\" said the man. \"Burglary, like enough. Well now, you youngsters have had yer shelter'n the wust o' the storm's over. It's goin' ter keep right on steady like this till after full moon, an' the ole shebang'll be floppin' roun' the marsh like enough on full moon tide. My advice to you is to git along. Not that you done no damage or what _I'd_ call damage--but it won't do no good fer yer to run amuck o' Ole Man Stanton. 'Cause he's a reg'lar grizzly, as the feller says.\"  The boys were silent a moment. Perhaps the thought of that desperate convict stealing forth amid the wind and rain still gripped them; but it began to dawn upon them also that they had been trespassing and that they had taken great liberties with this ramshackle boat.  That the owner could object to their use of it seemed preposterous. That he could take advantage of the technical \"damage\" done was quite unsupposable. But no one knows better than a boy how many \"grouchy\" men there are in the world, and these very boys had once been ordered out of John Temple's lot with threat and menace.  \"Does _everybody_ call him 'Old Man' Stanton?\" Pee-wee asked. \"Because if they do that's pretty bad. Whenever somebody is known as 'Old Man' it sounds pretty bad for him. They used to say 'Old Man Temple'--he's a man we know that owns a lot of railroads and things; of course, he's reformed now--he's a magnet----\"  \"Magnate,\" corrected Roy.  \"But they _used_ to call him 'Old Man Temple'--everybody did. And it's a sure sign--you can always tell,\" Pee-wee concluded.  \"Wall, they call _me_ 'Ole Man Flint,'\" said the visitor, \"so I guess----\"  \"Oh, of course,\" said Pee-wee, hastily, \"I don't say it's always so, and besides you're a--a----\"  \"Sheriff,\" Mr. Flint volunteered.  \"So you got to be kind of strict--and--and grouchy--like.\"  The sheriff handed his empty cup to Roy and smiled good-naturedly.  \"Where does Old Man Stanton live?\" asked Tom, who had been silent while the others were talking.  \"'Long the Nyack road, but he has his office in Nyack--he's a lawyer,\" said the visitor, as he drew his rubber hat down over his ears.  \"Can we get back to Nyack by that other road?\"  \"Whatcher goin' to do?\"  \"We'll have to go and see Old Man Stanton,\" Tom said, \"then if we don't get pinched we'll start north.\"  Mr. Flint looked at him in astonishment.  \"I wouldn't say we've done any damage,\" said Tom in his stolid way, \"and I believe in that about any port in a storm. But if he's the kind of a man who would think different, then we've got to go and tell him, that's all. We can pay him for the stanchions we chopped up.\"  \"Wall, you're a crazy youngster, that's all, but if yer sot on huntin' fer trouble, yer got only yerself to blame. Ye'll go before a justice uv the peace, the whole three uv year, and be fined ten dollars apiece, likely as not, an' I don't believe ye've got twenty-five dollars between the lot uv yer.\"  \"Right you are,\" said Roy. \"We are poor but honest, and we spurn--don't we, Pee-wee?\"  \"Sure we do,\" agreed Pee-wee.  \"Poverty is no disgrace,\" said Roy dramatically.  The man, though not overburdened with a sense of humor, could not help smiling at Roy and he went away laughing, but scarcely crediting their purpose to venture into the den of \"Old Man Stanton.\" \"They're a queer lot,\" he said to himself.  Within a few minutes the boys had gathered up their belongings, repacked their duffel bags and were picking their way across the marsh toward the drier road.  \"We're likely to land in jail,\" said Pee-wee, mildly protesting.  \"It isn't a question of whether we land in jail or not,\" said Tom, stolidly; \"it's just a question of what we ought to do.\"  \"_We_ should worry,\" said Roy.     CHAPTER VII  THE \"GOOD TURN\"   It was a draggled and exceedingly dubious-looking trio that made their way up the main street of Nyack. They had no difficulty in finding the office of \"Old Man Stanton,\" which bore a conspicuous sign:      WILMOUTH STANTON     COUNSELLOR AT LAW  \"He'd--he'd have to get out a warrant for us first, wouldn't he?\" Pee-wee asked, apprehensively.  \"That'll be easy,\" said Roy. \"If all goes well, I don't see why we shouldn't be in Sing Sing by three o'clock.\"  \"We're big fools to do this,\" said Pee-wee. \"A scout is supposed to be--cautious.\" But he followed the others up the stairs and stepped bravely in when Tom opened the door.  They found themselves in the lion's den with the lion in close proximity glaring upon them. He sat at a desk opening mail and looked frowningly at them over his spectacles. He was thin and wiry, his gray hair was rumpled in a way which suggested perpetual perplexity or annoyance, and his general aspect could not be said to be either conciliatory or inviting.  \"Well, sir,\" he said, crisply.  \"Are you Mr. Stanton?\" Tom asked. \"We are Scouts,\" he added, as the gentleman nodded perfunctorily, \"and we came from Bridgeboro. We're on our way to camp. Last night we got caught in the rain and we ran----\"  \"Took refuge,\" whispered Pee-wee.  \"For that old boat on the marsh. This morning we heard it was yours, so we came to tell you that we camped in it last night. We made a fire in a can, but I don't think we did any harm, except we chopped up a couple of old stanchions. We thought they were no good, but, of course, we shouldn't have taken them without leave.\"  Mr. Stanton stared at him with an ominous frown. \"Built a fire in a can?\" said he. \"Do you mean in the boat?\"  \"We used the exhaust for a draught,\" said Roy.  \"Oh--and what brings you here?\"  \"To tell you,\" said Tom, doggedly. \"A man came and told us you owned the boat. He said you might have us arrested, so we came to let you know about what we did.\"  \"We didn't come because we wanted to be arrested,\" put in Pee-wee.  \"I see,\" said Mr. Stanton, with the faintest suggestion of a smile. \"Isn't it something new,\" he added, \"running into the jaws of death? Boys generally run the other way and don't go hunting for trouble.\"  \"Well, I'll tell you how it is,\" said Pee-wee, making the conversation his own, somewhat to Roy's amusement. \"Of course, a scout has got to be cautious--but he's got to be fearless too. I was kind of scared when I heard you were a lawyer----\"  Mr. Stanton's grim visage relaxed into an unwilling, but unmistakable, smile.  \"And another thing I heard scared me, but----\"  Tom, seeing where Pee-wee was drifting, tried to stop him, but Roy, knowing that Pee-wee always managed to land on top, and seeing the smile on Mr. Stanton's forbidding countenance, encouraged him to go on, and presently the mascot of the Silver Foxes was holding the floor.  \"A scout has to deduce--that's one of the things we learn, and if you heard somebody called 'Old Man Something-or-other,' why, you'd deduce something from it, wouldn't you? And you'd be kind of scared-like. But even if you deduce that a man is going to be mad and gruff, kind of, even still you got to remember that you're a scout and if you damaged his property you got to go and tell him, anyway. You got to go and tell him even if you go to jail. Don't you see? Maybe you don't know much about the scouts----\"  \"No,\" said Mr. Stanton, \"I'm afraid I don't. But I'm glad to know that I am honored by a nickname--even so dubious a one. Do you think you were correct in your deductions?\" he added.  \"Well, I don't know,\" began Pee-wee. \"I can see--well, anyway there's another good thing about a scout--he's got to admit it if he's wrong.\"  Mr. Stanton laughed outright. It was a rusty sort of laugh, for he did not laugh often--but he laughed.  \"The only things I know about Boy Scouts,\" said he, \"I have learned in the last twenty-four hours. You tell me that they can convert an exhaust pipe into a stove flue, and I have learned they can bring a bird down out of a tree without so much as a bullet or a stone (I have to believe what my little daughter tells me), and that they take the road where they think trouble awaits them on account of a principle--that they walk up to the cannon's mouth, as it were--I am a very busy man and no doubt a very hard and disagreeable one, but I can afford to know a little more about these scouts, I believe.\"  \"I'll tell you all about them,\" said Pee-wee, sociably. \"Jiminys, I never dreamed you were that girl's father.\"  Mr. Stanton swung around in his chair and looked at him sharply. \"Who are you boys?\"  \"We came from Bridgeboro in New Jersey,\" spoke up Roy, \"and we're going up the river roads as far as Catskill Landing. Then we're going to hit inland for our summer camp.\"  Mr. Stanton was silent for a few moments, looking keenly at them while they stood in some suspense.  \"Well,\" he said, soberly, \"I see but one way out of the difficulty. The stanchions you destroyed were a part of the boat. The boat is of no use to me without them. I suggest,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19522"],["title","Tom Slade at Temple Camp (#8)"],["body","ore, that you take the boat along with you. It belonged to my son and it has been where it now lies ever since the storm in which his life was lost. I have not seen the inside of it since--I do not want to see the inside of it,\" he added brusquely, moving a paperweight about on his desk. \"It is only three years old,\" he went on after a moment's uncomfortable pause, \"and like some people it is not as bad as it looks.\"  The boys winced a little at this thrust. Mr. Stanton was silent for a few moments and Pee-wee was tempted to ask him something about his son, but did not quite dare to venture.  \"I think the boat can very easily be removed to the river with a little of the ingenuity which you scouts seem to have, and you may continue your journey in her, if you care to. You may consider it a--a present from my daughter, whom you made so happy yesterday.\"  For a moment the boys hardly realized the meaning of his words. Then Tom spoke.  \"We have a rule, Mr. Stanton, that a scout cannot accept anything for a service. If he does, it spoils it all. It's great, your offering us the boat and it seems silly not to take it, but----\"  \"Very well,\" said Mr. Stanton, proceeding to open his letters, \"if you prefer to go to jail for destroying my stanchions, very well. Remember you are dealing with a lawyer.\" Roy fancied he was chuckling a little inwardly.  \"That's right,\" said Pee-wee in Tom's ear. \"There's no use trying to get the best of a lawyer--a scout ought to be--to be modest; we better take it, Tom.\"  \"There's a difference between payment for a service and a token of gratitude,\" said Mr. Stanton, looking at Tom. \"But we will waive all that. I cannot allow the Boy Scouts to be laying down the law for me. By your own confession you have destroyed my stanchions and as a citizen it is my duty to take action. But if I were to give you a paper dated yesterday, assigning the boat to you, then it would appear that you had simply trespassed and burglariously entered your own property and destroyed your own stanchions and I would not have a leg to stand upon. My advice to you as a lawyer is to accept such a transfer of title and avoid trouble.\"  He began ostentatiously to read one of his letters.  \"He's right, Tom,\" whispered Pee-wee, \"It's what you call a teckinality. Gee, we better take the boat. There's no use trying to beat a lawyer. He's got the right on his side.\"  \"I don't know,\" said Tom, doubtfully. He, too, fancied that Mr. Stanton was laughing inwardly, but he was not good at repartee and the lawyer was too much for him. It was Roy who took the situation in hand.  \"It seems ungrateful, Mr. Stanton, even to talk about whether we'll take such a peach of a gift. Tom here is always thinking about the law--our law--and Pee-wee--we call this kid Pee-wee--he's our specialist on doing good turns. They're both cranks in different ways. I know there's a difference, as you say, between just a present and a reward. And it seems silly to say thank you for such a present, just as if it was a penknife or something like that. But we do thank you and we'll take the boat. I just happened to think of a good name for it while you were talking. It was the good turn Pee-wee did yesterday--about the bird, I mean--that made you offer it to us and your giving it to us is a good turn besides, so I guess we'll call it the 'Good Turn.'\"  \"You might call it the 'Teckinality,'\" suggested Mr. Stanton with a glance at Pee-wee.  \"All right,\" he added, \"I'll send one of my men down later in the day to see about getting her in the water. I've an idea a block and falls will do the trick. But you'd better caulk her up with lampwick and give her a coat of paint in the meantime.\"  He went to the door with them and as they turned at the foot of the stairs and called back another \"Thank you,\" Roy noticed something in his face which had not been there before.  \"I bet he's thinking of his son,\" said he.  \"Wonder how he died,\" said Tom.     CHAPTER VIII  BON VOYAGE!   \"Now, you see,\" said Pee-wee, \"how a good turn can evolute.\"  \"Can what?\" said Tom.  \"Evolute.\"  \"It could neverlute with me,\" observed Roy. \"Gee, but we've fallen in soft! You could have knocked me down with a toothpick. I wonder what our sleuth friend, the sheriff, will say.\"  The sheriff said very little; he was too astonished to say much. So were most of the people of the town. When they heard that \"Old Man Stanton\" had given Harry Stanton's boat to some strange boys from out of town, they said that the loss of his son must have affected his mind. The boys of the neighborhood, incredulous, went out on the marsh the next day when the rain held up, and stood about watching the three strangers at work and marvelling at \"Old Man Stanton's\" extraordinary generosity.  \"Aw, he handed 'em a lemon!\" commented the wiseacre. \"That boat'll never run--it won't even float!\"  But Harry Stanton's cruising launch was no lemon. It proved to be staunch and solid. There wasn't a rotten plank in her. Her sorry appearance was merely the superficial shabbiness which comes from disuse and this the boys had neither the time nor the money to remedy; but the hull and the engine were good.  To the latter Roy devoted himself, for he knew something of gas engines by reason of the two automobiles at his own house. They made a list of the things they needed, took another hike into Nyack and came back laden with material and provisions. Roy poured a half-gallon or so of kerosene into each of the two cylinders and left it over night. The next morning when he drained it off the wheel turned over easily enough. A set of eight dry cells, some new wiring, a couple of new plugs, a little session with a pitted coil, a little more gas, a little less air, a little more gas, and finally the welcome first explosion, so dear to the heart of the motor-boatist, rewarded Roy's efforts of half a day.  \"Stop it! Stop it!\" shrieked Pee-wee from outside. \"I hung the paint can on the propeller! I'm getting a green shower bath!\"  He poked his head over the combing, his face, arms and clothing bespattered with copper paint.  \"Never mind, kiddo,\" laughed Roy, \"It's all in the game. She runs like a dream. Step a little closer, ladies and gentlemen, and view the leopard boy. Pee-wee, you're a sight! For goodness' sakes, get some sandpaper!\"  The two days of working on the _Good Turn_ were two days of fun. It was not necessary to caulk her lower seams for the dampness of the marsh had kept them tight, and the seams above were easy. They did not bother about following the water-line and painting her free-board white; a coat of copper paint over the whole hull sufficed. They painted the sheathing of the cockpit a common-sense brown, \"neat but not gaudy,\" as Roy said. The deck received a coat of an unknown color which their friend, the sheriff, brought them saying he had used it on his chicken-coop. The engine they did in aluminum paint, the fly-wheel in a gaudy red, and then they mixed what was left of all the paints.  \"I bet we get a kind of blackish white,\" said Pee-wee.  \"I bet it's green,\" said Tom.  But it turned out to be a weak silvery gray and with this they painted the cabin, or rather half the cabin, for their paint gave out.  They sat until long after midnight in the little cabin after their first day's work, but were up and at it again bright and early in the morning, for Mr. Stanton's men were coming with the block and falls at high tide in the evening to haul the _Good Turn_ back into her watery home.  Pee-wee spent a good part of the day throwing out superfluous junk and tidying up the little cabin, while Tom and Roy repaired the rubbing-rail where it had broken loose and attended to other slight repairs on the outside.  The dying sunlight was beginning to flicker on the river and the three were finishing their supper in the cabin when Tom, looking through the porthole, called, \"Oh, here comes the truck and an automobile just in front of it!\"  Sure enough, there on the road was the truck with its great coil of hempen rope and its big pulleys, accompanied by two men in overalls. Pee-wee could not repress his exuberance as the trio clambered up on the cabin roof and waved to the little cavalcade.  \"In an hour more she'll be in the water,\" he shouted, \"and we'll----\"  \"We'll anchor till daylight,\" concluded Roy.  In another moment a young girl, laden with bundles, had left the automobile and was picking her way across the marsh. It proved to be the owner of the fugitive bird.  \"I've brought you all the things that belong to the boat,\" she said, \"and I'm going to stay and see it launched. My father was coming too but he had a meeting or something or other. Isn't it perfectly glorious how you chopped up the stanchions----\"  \"Great,\" said Roy. \"It shows the good that comes out of breaking the law. If we hadn't chopped up the stanchions----\"  \"Oh, crinkums, look at this!\" interrupted Pee-wee. He was handling the colored bow lamp.  \"And here's the compass, and here's the whistle, and here's the fog-bell,\" said the girl, unloading her burden with a sigh of relief. \"And here's the flag for the stern and here--look--I made this all by myself and sat up till eleven o'clock to do it--see!\"  She unfolded a cheese-cloth pennant with the name _Good Turn_ sewed upon it. \"You have to fly this at the bow in memory of your getting my bird for me,\" she said.  \"We'll fly it at the bow in memory of what you and your father have done for _us_,\" said Tom.  \"And here's some fruit, and here's some salmon, and here's some pickled something or other--I got them all out of the pantry and they weigh a ton!\"  There was no time for talking if the boat was to be got to the river before dark, and the boys fell to with the men while the girl looked about the cabin with exclamations of surprise.  \"Isn't it perfectly lovely,\" she called to Tom, who was outside encircling the hull with a double line of heavy rope, under the men's direction. \"I never saw anything so cute and "]]]
