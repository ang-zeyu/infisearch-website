DEAR PATRICK MACGILL,  There is open in France a wonderful exhibition of the work of the many gallant artists who have been serving in the French trenches through the long months of the War.  There is not a young writer, painter, or sculptor of French blood, who is not risking his life for his country. Can we make the same proud boast?  When I recruited you into the London Irish--one of those splendid regiments that London has sent to Sir John French, himself an Irishman--it was with gratitude and pride.  You had much to give us. The rare experiences of your boyhood, your talents, your brilliant hopes for the future. Upon all these the Western hills and loughs of your native Donegal seemed to have a prior claim. But you gave them to London and to our London Territorials. It was an example and a symbol.  The London Irish will be proud of their young artist in words, and he will for ever be proud of the London Irish Regiment, its deeds and valour, to which he has dedicated such great gifts. May God preserve you.                                     Yours sincerely,                                           ESHER.                                    _President_ County of London  Callander.

I wish that I were back again   In the glens of Donegal;   They'll call me coward if I return,   But a hero if I fall.    \"Is it better to be a living coward,   Or thrice a hero dead?\"   \"It's better to go to sleep, my lad,\"   The Colour Sergeant said.   Night, a grey troubled sky without moon or stars. The shadows lay on the surface of the sea, and the waves moaned beneath the keel of the troopship that was bearing us away on the most momentous journey of our lives. The hour was about ten. Southampton lay astern; by dawn we should be in France, and a day nearer the war for which we had trained so long in the cathedral city of St. Albans.  I had never realized my mission as a rifleman so acutely before.   (p. 014)  \"To the war! to the war!\" I said under my breath. \"Out to France and the fighting!\" The thought raised a certain expectancy in my mind. \"Did I think three years ago that I should ever be a soldier?\" I asked myself. \"Now that I am, can I kill a man; run a bayonet through his body; right through, so that the point, blood red and cruelly keen, comes out at the back? I'll not think of it.\"  But the thoughts could not be chased away. The month was March, and the night was bitterly cold on deck. A sharp penetrating wind swept across the sea and sung eerily about the dun-coloured funnel. With my overcoat buttoned well up about my neck and my Balaclava helmet pulled down over my ears I paced along the deck for quite an hour; then, shivering with cold, I made my way down to the cabin where my mates had taken up their quarters. The cabin was low-roofed and lit with two electric lamps. The corners receded into darkness where the shadows clustered thickly. The floor was covered with sawdust, packs and haversacks hung from pegs in the walls; a gun-rack stood in the centre of the apartment; butts down and muzzles in line, the rifles       (p. 015) stretched in a straight row from stern to cabin stairs. On the benches along the sides the men took their seats, each man under his equipment, and by right of equipment holding the place for the length of the voyage.  My mates were smoking, and the whole place was dim with tobacco smoke. In the thick haze a man three yards away was invisible.  \"Yes,\" said a red-haired sergeant, with a thick blunt nose, and a broken row of tobacco-stained teeth; \"we're off for the doin's now.\"  \"Blurry near time too,\" said a Cockney named Spud Higgles. \"I thought we weren't goin' out at all.\"  \"You'll be there soon enough, my boy,\" said the sergeant. \"It's not all fun, I'm tellin' you, out yonder. I have a brother----\"  \"The same bruvver?\" asked Spud Higgles.  \"What d'ye mean?\" inquired the sergeant.  \"Ye're always speakin' about that bruvver of yours,\" said Spud. \"'E's only in Ally Sloper's Cavalry; no man's ever killed in that mob.\"  \"H'm!\" snorted the sergeant. \"The A.S.C. runs twice as much risk as a line regiment.\"  \"That's why ye didn't join it then, is it?\" asked the Cockney.     (p. 016)  \"Hold yer beastly tongue!\" said the sergeant.  \"Well, it's like this,\" said Spud----  \"Hold your tongue,\" snapped the sergeant, and Spud relapsed into silence.  After a moment he turned to me where I sat. \"It's not only Germans that I'll look for in the trenches,\" he said, \"when I have my rifle loaded and get close to that sergeant----\"  \"You'll put a bullet through him\"; I said, \"just as you vowed you'd do to me some time ago. You were going to put a bullet through the sergeant-major, the company cook, the sanitary inspector, the army tailor and every single man in the regiment. Are you going to destroy the London Irish root and branch?\" I asked.  \"Well, there's some in it as wants a talking to at times,\" said Spud. \"'Ave yer got a fag to spare?\"  Somebody sung a ragtime song, and the cabin took up the chorus. The boys bound for the fields of war were light-hearted and gay. A journey from the Bank to Charing Cross might be undertaken with a more serious air: it looked for all the world as if they were merely out on     (p. 017) some night frolic, determined to throw the whole mad vitality of youth into the escapade.  \"What will it be like out there?\" I asked myself. The war seemed very near now. \"What will it be like, but above all, how shall I conduct myself in the trenches? Maybe I shall be afraid--cowardly. But no! If I can't bear the discomforts and terrors which thousands endure daily I'm not much good. But I'll be all right. Vanity will carry me through where courage fails. It would be such a grand thing to become conspicuous by personal daring. Suppose the men were wavering in an attack, and then I rushed out in front and shouted: 'Boys, we've got to get this job through'--But, I'm a fool. Anyhow I'll lie on the floor and have a sleep.\"  Most of the men were now in a deep slumber. Despite an order against smoking, given a quarter of an hour before, a few of my mates had the \"fags\" lit, and as the lamps had been turned off the cigarettes glowed red through the gloom. The sleepers lay in every conceivable position, some with faces turned upwards, jaws hanging loosely and tongues stretching over the lower lips; some with knees curled up and      (p. 018) heads bent, frozen stiff in the midst of a grotesque movement, some with hands clasped tightly over their breasts and others with their fingers bent as if trying to clutch at something beyond their reach. A few slumbered with their heads on their rifles, more had their heads on the sawdust-covered floor, and these sent the sawdust fluttering whenever they breathed. The atmosphere of the place was close and almost suffocating. Now and again someone coughed and spluttered as if he were going to choke. Perspiration stood out in little beads on the temples of the sleepers, and they turned round from time to time to raise"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19710"],["title","The Red Horizon (#1)"],["body","Balaclava helmets higher over their eyes.  And so the night wore on. What did they dream of lying there? I wondered. Of their journey and the perils that lay before them? Of the glory or the horror of the war? Of their friends whom, perhaps, they would never see again? It was impossible to tell.  For myself I tried not to think too clearly of what I might see to-morrow or the day after. The hour was now past midnight and a new day had come. What did it hold for us all? Nobody knew--I fell asleep.     CHAPTER II                                                         (p. 019)  SOMEWHERE IN FRANCE    When I come back to England,     And times of Peace come round,   I'll surely have a shilling,     And may be have a pound;   I'll walk the whole town over,     And who shall say me nay,   For I'm a British soldier     With a British soldier's pay.   The Rest Camp a city of innumerable bell-tents, stood on the summit of a hill overlooking the town and the sea beyond. We marched up from the quay in the early morning, followed the winding road paved with treacherous cobbles that glory in tripping unwary feet, and sweated to the summit of the hill. Here a new world opened to our eyes: a canvas city, the mushroom growth of our warring times lay before us; tent after tent, large and small, bell-tent and marquee in accurate alignment.  It took us two hours to march to our places; we grounded arms at the word of command and sank on our packs wearily happy. True, a few   (p. 020) had fallen out; they came in as we rested and awkwardly fell into position. They were men who had been sea-sick the night before. We were too excited to rest for long; like dogs in a new locality we were presently nosing round looking for food. Two hours march in full marching order makes men hungry, and hungry men are ardent explorers. The dry and wet canteens faced one another, and each was capable of accommodating a hundred men. Never were canteens crowded so quickly, never have hundreds of the hungry and drouthy clamoured so eagerly for admission as on that day. But time worked marvels; at the end of an hour we fell in again outside a vast amount of victuals, and the sea-sickness of the previous night, and the strain of the morning's march were things over which now we could be humorously reminiscent.  Sheepskin jackets, the winter uniform of the trenches, were served out to us, and all were tried on. They smelt of something chemical and unpleasant, but were very warm and quite polar in appearance.  \"Wish my mother could see me now,\" Bill the Cockney remarked. \"My, she wouldn't think me 'alf a cove. It's a balmy. I discovered the      (p. 021) South Pole, I'm thinkin'.\"  \"More like you're up the pole!\" some one cut in, then continued, \"If they saw us at St. Albans[1] now! Bet yer they wouldn't say as we're for home service.\"                     [Footnote 1: It was at St. Albans that we underwent                    most of our training.]  That night we slept in bell-tents, fourteen men in each, packed tight as herrings in a barrel, our feet festooning the base of the central pole, our heads against the lower rim of the canvas covering. Movement was almost an impossibility; a leg drawn tight in a cramp disturbed the whole fabric of slumbering humanity; the man who turned round came in for a shower of maledictions. In short, fourteen men lying down in a bell-tent cannot agree for very long, and a bell-tent is not a paradise of sympathy and mutual agreement.  We rose early, washed and shaved, and found our way to the canteen, a big marquee under the control of the Expeditionary Force, where bread and butter, bacon and tea were served out for breakfast. Soldiers recovering from wounds worked as waiters, and told, when they had a moment to spare, of hair-breadth adventures in the trenches. They  (p. 022) found us willing listeners; they had lived for long in the locality for which we were bound, and the whole raw regiment had a personal interest in the narratives of the wounded men. Bayonet-charges were discussed.  \"I've been in three of 'em,\" remarked a quiet, inoffensive-looking youth who was sweeping the floor of the room. \"They were a bit 'ot, but nothin' much to write 'ome about. Not like a picture in the papers, none of them wasn't. Not much stickin' of men. You just ops out of your trench and rush and roar, like 'ell. The Germans fire and then run off, and it's all over.\"  After breakfast feet were inspected by the medical officer. We sat down on our packs in the parade ground, took off our boots, and shivered with cold. The day was raw, the wind sharp and penetrating; we forgot that our sheepskins smelt vilely, and snuggled into them, glad of their warmth. The M.O. asked questions: \"Do your boots pinch?\" \"Any blisters?\" \"Do you wear two pairs of socks?\" &c., &c. Two thousand feet passed muster, and boots were put on again.  The quartermaster's stores claimed our attention afterwards, and   (p. 023) the attendants there were almost uncannily kind. \"Are you sure you've got everything you want?\" they asked us. \"There mayn't be a chance to get fitted up after this.\" Socks, pull-throughs, overcoats, regimental buttons, badges, hats, tunics, oil-bottles, gloves, puttees, and laces littered the floor and were piled on the benches. We took what we required; no one superintended our selection.  At St. Albans, where we had been turned into soldiers, we often stood for hours waiting until the quartermaster chose to give us a few inches of rifle-rag; here a full uniform could be obtained by picking it up. And our men were wise in selecting only necessities; they still remembered the march of the day before. All took sparingly and chose wisely. Fancy socks were passed by in silence, the homely woollen article, however, was in great demand. Bond Street was forgotten. The \"nut\" was a being of a past age, or, if he still existed, he was undergoing a complete transformation. Also he knew what socks were best for the trenches.  At noon we were again ready to set out on our journey. A tin of bully-beef and six biscuits, hard as rocks, were given to each man (p. 024) prior to departure. Sheepskins were rolled into shape and fastened on the tops of our packs, and with this additional burden on the shoulder we set out from the rest-camp and took our course down the hill. On the way we met another regiment coming up to fill our place, to sleep in our bell-tents, pick from the socks which we had left behind, and to meet for once, the first and last time perhaps, a quartermaster who is really kind in the discharge of his professional duties. We marched off, and sang our way into the town and station. Our trucks were already waiting, an endless number they seemed lined up in the siding with an engine in front and rear, and the notice \"Hommes 40 chevaux 20\" in white letters on every door. The night before I had slept in a bell-tent where a man's head pointed to each seam in the canvas, to-night it seemed as if I should sleep, if that were possible, in a still more crowded place, where we had now barely standing room, and where it was difficult to move about. But a much-desired relief came before the train started, spare waggons were shunted on, and a number of men were taken from each compartment and given room elsewhere.  (p. 025) In fact, when we moved off we had only twenty-two soldiers in our place, quite enough though when our equipment, pack, rifle, bayonet, haversack, overcoat, and sheepskin tunic were taken into account.  A bale of hay bound with wire was given to us for bedding, and bully-beef, slightly flavoured, and biscuits were doled out for rations. Some of us bought oranges, which were very dear, and paid three halfpence apiece for them; chocolate was also obtained, and one or two adventurous spirits stole out to the street, contrary to orders, and bought _café au lait_ and _pain et beurre_, drank the first in the _estaminet_, and came back to their trucks munching the latter.  At noon we started out on the journey to the trenches, a gay party that found expression for its young vitality in song. The sliding-doors and the windows were open; those of us who were not looking out of the one were looking out of the other. To most it was a new country, a place far away in peace and a favourite resort of the wealthy; but now a country that called for any man, no matter how poor, if he were strong in person and willing to give his life away when called upon to do so. In fact, the poor man was having his first holiday on the Continent, and alas!--perhaps his last; and like    (p. 026) cattle new to the pasture fields in Spring, we were surging full of life and animal gaiety.  We were out on a great adventure, full of thrill and excitement; the curtain which surrounded our private life was being lifted; we stood on the threshold of momentous events. The cottagers who laboured by their humble homes stood for a moment and watched our train go by; now and again a woman shouted out a blessing on our mission, and ancient men seated by their doorsteps pointed in the direction our train was going, and drew lean, skinny hands across their throats, and yelled advice and imprecations in hoarse voices. We understood. The ancient warriors ordered us to cut the Kaiser's throat and envied us the job.  The day wore on, the evening fell dark and stormy. A cold wind from somewhere swept in through chinks in windows and door, and chilled the compartment. The favourite song, _Uncle Joe_, with its catching chorus,    When Uncle Joe plays a rag upon his old banjo,   Eberybody starts aswayin to and fro,   Mummy waddles all around the cabin floor,   Yellin' \"Uncle Joe, give us more! give us more!\"  died away into a melancholy whimper. Sometimes one of the men would rise, open the window and look out at a passing hamlet, where      (p. 027) lights glimmered in the houses and heavy waggons lumbered along the uneven streets, whistle an air into the darkness and close the window again."]]]
