He meant to do something; and after he had made up his mind how and where it was to be done, it was no use to stand thinking about it, like the pendulum of the \"old clock which had stood for fifty years in a farmer's kitchen, without giving its owner any cause of complaint.\"  Bobby walked down the road towards the village with a rapid step. He was thinking very fast, and probably that made him step quick. But as he approached Squire Lee's house, his pace slackened, and he seemed to be very uneasy. When he reached the great gate that led up to the house, he stopped for an instant, and thrust his hands down very deep into his trousers pockets. I cannot tell what the trousers pockets had to do with what he was thinking about; but if he was searching for anything in them, he did not find it; for after an instant's hesitation he drew out his hands, struck one of them against his chest, and in an audible voice exclaimed,--  \"Now or never.\"  All this pantomime, I suppose, meant that Bobby had some misgivings as to the ultimate success of his mission at Squire Lee's, and that when he struck his breast and uttered his favorite expression, they were conquered and driven out.  Marching with a bold and determined step up to the squire's back door,--Bobby's ideas of etiquette would not have answered for the meridian of fashionable society,--he gave three smart raps.  Bobby's heart beat a little wildly as he awaited a response to his summons. It seemed that he still had some doubts as to the practicability of his mission; but they were not permitted to disturb him long, for the door was opened by the squire's pretty daughter Annie, a young miss of twelve.  \"O, Bobby, is it you? I am so glad you have come!\" exclaimed the little lady.  Bobby blushed--he didn't know why, unless it was that the young lady desired to see him. He stammered out a reply, and for the moment forgot the object of his visit.  \"I want you to go down to the village for me, and get some books the expressman was to bring up from Boston for me. Will you go?\"  \"Certainly, Miss Annie, I shall be very glad to go for _you_,\" replied Bobby, with an emphasis that made the little maiden blush in her turn.  \"You are real good, Bobby; but I will give you something for going.\"  \"I don't want anything,\" said Bobby, stoutly.  \"You are too generous! Ah, I heard what you did this forenoon; and pa says that a great many men would not have dared to do what you did. I always thought you were as brave as a lion; now I know it.\"  \"The books are at the express office, I suppose,\" said Bobby, turning as red as a blood beet.  \"Yes, Bobby; I am so anxious to get them that I can't wait till pa goes down this evening.\"  \"I will not be gone long.\"  \"O, you needn't run, Bobby; take your time.\"  \"I will go very quick. But, Miss Annie, is your father at home?\"  \"Not now; he has gone over to the wood lot; but he will be back by the time you return.\"  \"Will you please to tell him that I want to see him about something very particular, when he gets back?\"  \"I will, Bobby.\"  \"Thank you, Miss Annie;\" and Bobby hastened to the village to execute his commission.  \"I wonder what he wants to see pa so very particularly for,\" said the young lady to herself, as she watched his receding form. \"In my opinion, something has happened at the little black house, for I could see that he looked very sober.\"  Either Bobby had a very great regard for the young lady, and wished to relieve her impatience to behold the coveted books, or he was in a hurry to see Squire Lee; for the squire's old roan horse could hardly have gone quicker.  \"You should not have run, Bobby,\" said the little maiden, when he placed the books in her hand; \"I would not have asked you to go if I had thought you would run all the way. You must be very tired.\"  \"Not at all; I didn't run, only walked very quick,\" replied he; but his quick breathing indicated that his words or his walk had been very much exaggerated. \"Has your father returned?\"  \"He has; he is waiting for you in the sitting room. Come in, Bobby.\"  Bobby followed her into the room, and took the chair which Annie offered him.  \"How do you do, Bobby? I am glad to see you,\" said the squire, taking him by the hand, and bestowing a benignant smile upon him--a smile which cheered his heart more than anything else could at that moment. \"I have heard of you before, to-day.\"  \"Have you?\"  \"I have, Bobby; you are a brave little fellow.\"  \"I came over to see you, sir, about something very particular,\" replied Bobby, whose natural modesty induced him to change the topic.  \"Indeed; well, what can I do for you?\"  \"A great deal, sir; perhaps you will think I am very bold, sir, but I can't help it.\"  \"I know you are a very bold little fellow, or you would not have done what you did this forenoon,\" laughed the squire.  \"I didn't mean that, sir,\" answered Bobby, blushing up to the eyes.  \"I know you didn't; but go on.\"  \"I only meant that you would think me presuming, or impudent, or something of that kind.\"  \"O, no, far from it. You cannot be presuming or impudent. Speak out, Bobby; anything under the heavens that I can do for you, I shall be glad to do.\"  \"Well, sir, I am going to leave Riverdale.\"  \"Leave Riverdale!\"  \"Yes, sir; I am going to Boston, where I mean to do something to help mother.\"  \"Bravo! you are a good lad. What do you mean to do?\"  \"I was thinking I should go into the book business.\"  \"Indeed!\" and Squire Lee was much amused by the matter-of-fact manner of the young aspirant.  \"I was talking with a young fellow who went through the place last spring, selling books. He told me that some days he made three or four dollars, and that he averaged twelve dollars a week.\"  \"He did well; perhaps, though, only a few of them make so much.\"  \"I know I can make twelve dollars a week,\" replied Bobby, confidently, for that something within him made him feel capable of great things.  \"I dare say you can. You have energy and perseverance, and people take a liking to you.\"  \"But I wanted to see you about another matter. To speak out at once, I want to borrow sixty dollars of you;\" and Bobby blushed, and seemed very much embarrassed by his own boldness.  \"Sixty dollars!\" exclaimed the squire.  \"I knew you would think me impudent,\" replied our hero, his heart sinking within him.  \"But I don't, Bobby. You want the money to go into business with--to buy your stock of books?\"  \"O, no, sir; I am going to apply to Mr. Bayard for that.\"  \"Just so; Mr. Bayard is the gentleman whose daughter you saved?\"  \"Yes, sir. I want this money to pay off Mr. Hardhand. We owe him but sixty dollars now, and he has threatened to turn us out, if it is not paid by to-morrow noon.\"  \"The old hunks!\"  Bobby briefly related to the squire the events of the morning, much to the indignation and disgust of the honest, kind-hearted man. The courageous boy detailed more clearly his purpose, and doubted not he should be able to pay the loan in a few months.  \"Very well, Bobby, here is the money;\" and the squire took it from his wallet, and gave it to him.  \"Thank you, sir. May Heaven bless you! I shall certainly pay you.\"  \"Don't worry about it, Bobby. Pay it when you get ready.\"  \"I will give you my note, and----\"  The squire laughed heartily at this, and told him that, as he was a minor, his note was not good for anything.  \"You shall see whether it is, or not,\" returned Bobby. \"Let me give it to you, at least, so that we can tell how much I owe you from time to time.\"  \"You shall have your own way.\"  Annie Lee, as much amused as her father at Bobby's big talk, got the writing materials, and the little merchant in embryo wrote and signed the note.  \"Good, Bobby! Now promise that you will come and see me every time you come home, and tell me how you are getting along.\"  \"I will, sir, with the greatest pleasure;\" and with a light heart Bobby tripped away home.     CHAPTER VI  IN WHICH BOBBY SETS OUT ON HIS TRAVELS   Squire Lee, though only a plain farmer, was the richest man in Riverdale. He had taken a great fancy to Bobby, and often employed him to do errands, ride the horse to plough in the cornfields, and such chores about the place as a boy could do. He liked to talk with Bobby because there was a great deal of good sense in him, for one with a small head.  If there was any one thing upon which the squire particularly prided himself, it was his knowledge of human nature. He declared that he only wanted to look a man in the face to know what he was; and as for Bobby Bright, he had summered him and wintered him, and he was satisfied that he would make something in good time.  He was not much astonished when Bobby opened his ambitious scheme of going into business for himself. But he had full faith in his ability to work out a useful and profitable, if not a brilliant, life. He often said that Bobby was worth his weight in gold, and that he would trust him with anything he had. Perhaps he did not suspect that the time was at hand when he would be called upon to verify his words practically; for it was only that morning, when one of the neighbors told him about Bobby's stopping the horse, that he had repeated the expression for the twentieth time.  It was not an idle remark. Sixty dollars was hardly worth mentioning with a man of his wealth and liberal views, though so careful a man as he was would not have been likely to throw away that amount. But as a matter of investment,--Bobby had made the note read \"with interest,\"--he would as readily have let him have it, as the next richest man in the place, so much confidence had he in our hero's integrity, and so sure was he that he would soon have the means of paying him.  Bobby was overjoyed at the fortunate issue of his mission, and he walked into the room where his mother was closing shoes, with a dignity worthy a banker or a great merchant. Mrs. Bright was very sad. Perhaps she felt a little grieved that her son, whom"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19473"],["title","Now or Never; Or, The Adventures of Bobby Bright (#6)"],["body","loved so much, had so thoughtlessly plunged her into a new difficulty.  \"Come, cheer up, mother; it is all right,\" said Bobby, in his usual elastic and gay tones; and at the same time he took the sixty dollars from his pocket and handed it to her. \"There is the money, and you will be forever quit of Mr. Hardhand to-morrow.\"  \"What, Bobby! Why, where did you get all this money?\" asked Mrs. Bright, utterly astonished.  In a few words the ambitious boy told his story, and then informed his mother that he was going to Boston the next Monday morning, to commence business for himself.  \"Why, what can you do, Bobby?\"  \"Do? I can do a great many things;\" and he unfolded his scheme of becoming a little book merchant.  \"You are a courageous fellow! Who would have thought of such a thing?\"  \"I should, and did.\"  \"But you are not old enough.\"  \"O, yes, I am.\"  \"You had better wait a while.\"  \"Now or never, mother! You see I have given my note, and my paper will be dishonored, if I am not up and doing.\"  \"Your paper!\" said Mrs. Bright, with a smile.  \"That is what Mr. Wing, the boot manufacturer, calls it.\"  \"You needn't go away to earn this money; I can pay it myself.\"  \"This note is my affair, and I mean to pay it myself with my own earnings. No objections, mother.\"  Like a sensible woman as she was, she did not make any objections. She was conscious of Bobby's talents; she knew that he had a strong mind of his own, and could take care of himself. It is true, she feared the influence of the great world, and especially of the great city, upon the tender mind of her son; but if he was never tempted, he would never be a conqueror over the foes that beset him.  She determined to do her whole duty towards him; and she carefully pointed out to him the sins and the moral danger to which he would be exposed, and warned him always to resist temptation. She counselled him to think of her when he felt like going astray.  Bobby declared that he would try to be a good boy. He did not speak contemptuously of the anticipated perils, as many boys would have done, because he knew that his mother would not make bug-bears out of things which she knew had no real existence.  The next day, Mr. Hardhand came; and my young readers can judge how astonished and chagrined he was, when the widow Bright offered him the sixty dollars. The Lord was with the widow and the fatherless, and the wretch was cheated out of his revenge. The note was given up, and the mortgage cancelled.  Mr. Hardhand insisted that she should pay the interest on the sixty dollars for one day, as it was then the second day of July; but when Bobby reckoned it up, and found it was less than one cent, even the wretched miser seemed ashamed of himself, and changed the subject of conversation.  He did not dare to say anything saucy to the widow this time. He had lost his power over her, and there stood Bobby, who had come to look just like a young lion to him, coward and knave as he was.  The business was all settled now, and Bobby spent the rest of the week in getting ready for his great enterprise. He visited all his friends, and went each day to talk with Squire Lee and Annie. The little maiden promised to buy a great many books of him, if he would bring his stock to Riverdale, for she was quite as much interested in him as her father was.  Monday morning came, and Bobby was out of bed with the first streak of dawn. The excitement of the great event which was about to happen had not permitted him to sleep for the two hours preceding; yet when he got up, he could not help feeling sad. He was going to leave the little black house, going to leave his mother, going to leave the children, to depart for the great city.  His mother was up before him. She was even more sad than he was, for she could see plainer than he the perils that environed him, and her maternal heart, in spite of the reasonable confidence she had in his integrity and good principles, trembled for his safety.  As he ate his breakfast, his mother repeated the warnings and the good lessons she had before imparted. She particularly cautioned him to keep out of bad company. If he found that his companions would lie and swear, he might depend upon it they would steal, and he had better forsake them at once. This was excellent advice, and Bobby had occasion at a later period to call it to his sorrowing heart.  \"Here is three dollars, Bobby; it is all the money I have. Your fare to Boston will be one dollar, and you will have two left to pay the expenses of your first trip. It is all I have now,\" said Mrs. Bright.  \"I will not take the whole of it. You will want it yourself. One dollar is enough. When I find Mr. Bayard, I shall do very well.\"  \"Yes, Bobby, take the whole of it.\"  \"I will take just one dollar, and no more,\" replied Bobby, resolutely, as he handed her the other two dollars.  \"Do take it, Bobby.\"  \"No, mother; it will only make me lazy and indifferent.\"  Taking a clean shirt, a pair of socks, and a handkerchief in his bundle, he was ready for a start.  \"Good by, mother,\" said he, kissing her and taking her hand. \"I shall try and come home on Saturday, so as to be with you on Sunday.\"  Then kissing the children, who had not yet got up, and to whom he had bidden adieu the night before, he left the house. He had seen the flood of tears that filled his mother's eyes, as he crossed the threshold; and he could not help crying a little himself. It is a sad thing to leave one's home, one's mother, especially, to go out into the great world; and we need not wonder that Bobby, who had hardly been out of Riverdale before, should weep. But he soon restrained the flowing tears.  \"Now or never!\" said he, and he put his best foot forward.  It was an epoch in his history, and though he was too young to realize the importance of the event, he seemed to feel that what he did now was to give character to his whole future life.  It was a bright and beautiful morning--somehow it is always a bright and beautiful morning when boys leave their homes to commence the journey of life; it is typical of the season of youth and hope, and it is meet that the sky should be clear, and the sun shine brightly, when the little pilgrim sets out upon his tour. He will see clouds and storms before he has gone far--let him have a fair start.  He had to walk five miles to the nearest railroad station. His road lay by the house of his friend, Squire Lee; and as he was approaching it, he met Annie. She said she had come out to take her morning walk; but Bobby knew very well that she did not usually walk till an hour later; which, with the fact that she had asked him particularly, the day before, what time he was going, made Bobby believe that she had come out to say good by, and bid him God speed on his journey. At any rate, he was very glad to see her. He said a great many pretty things to her, and talked so big about what he was going to do, that the little maiden could hardly help laughing in his face.  Then at the house he shook hands with the squire and shook hands again with Annie, and resumed his journey. His heart felt lighter for having met them, or at least for having met one of them, if not both; for Annie's eyes were so full of sunshine that they seemed to gladden his heart, and make him feel truer and stronger.  After a pleasant walk, for he scarcely heeded the distance, so full was he of his big thoughts, he reached the railroad station. The cars had not yet arrived, and would not for half an hour.  \"Why should I give them a dollar for carrying me to Boston, when I can just as well walk? If I get tired, I can sit down and rest me. If I save the dollar, I shall have to earn only fifty-nine more to pay my note. So here goes;\" and he started down the track.     CHAPTER VII  IN WHICH BOBBY STANDS UP FOR \"CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS\"   Whether it was wise policy, or \"penny wise and pound foolish\" policy for Bobby to undertake such a long walk, is certainly a debatable question; but as my young readers would probably object to an argument, we will follow him to the city, and let every one settle the point to suit himself.  His cheerful heart made the road smooth beneath his feet. He had always been accustomed to an active, busy life, and had probably often walked more than twenty miles in a day. About ten o'clock, though he did not feel much fatigued, he seated himself on a rock by a brook from which he had just taken a drink, to rest himself. He had walked slowly so as to husband his strength; and he felt confident that he should be able to accomplish the journey without injury to himself.  After resting for half an hour, he resumed his walk. At twelve o'clock he reached a point from which he obtained his first view of the city. His heart bounded at the sight, and his first impulse was to increase his speed so that he should the sooner gratify his curiosity; but a second thought reminded him that he had eaten nothing since breakfast; so, finding a shady tree by the road side, he seated himself on a stone to eat the luncheon which his considerate mother had placed in his bundle.  Thus refreshed, he felt like a new man, and continued his journey again till he was on the very outskirts of the city, where a sign, \"No passing over this bridge,\" interrupted his farther progress. Unlike many others, Bobby took this sign literally, and did not venture to cross the bridge. Having some doubts as to the direct road to the city, he hailed a man in a butcher's cart, who not only pointed the way, but gave him an invitation to ride with him, which Bobby was glad to accept.  They crossed the Milldam, and the little pilgrim forgot the long walk he had taken--forgot Riverdale, his mother, Squire Lee, and Annie, for the time, in the absorbing interest of the exciting scene. The Common beat Riverdale Common all hollow; he had never seen anything like it before. But when the wagon reached Washington Street, the measure of his surprise was filled up.  \"My"]]]
