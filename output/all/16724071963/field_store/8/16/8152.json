Want to see it?\"  \"I think we'd better see if we can get to camp and find some hot stew,\" said Mr. Denny.  \"That's the kind of a charm for me,\" said one of the scouts.  So it fell out that on this occasion, as on most others, Goliath was not permitted to dig down into the remote recess of his pocket to show that wonderful charm.     CHAPTER XI  THE NEW SCOUT   \"Well,\" laughed Mr. Baxton, scoutmaster of the troop to which that little brownie of a boy belonged; \"since we have a hero, we may as well use him. Suppose you stay here, Gilbert, and stop any vehicles that happen along.\"  \"I think one of our boys from camp ought to do that,\" said one of the other scoutmasters. \"How about you, Roy?\"  The boy addressed was of a compact, natty build, with brown curly hair, and with the kind of smile which was positively guaranteed not to wash out in a storm. On his nose, which was of the aggressive and impudent type, were five freckles, set like the stars which form the big dipper, and his even teeth, which were constantly in evidence, were as white as snow. Across the bridge of his nose was a mark such as is seen upon the noses of persons who wear spectacles. But he wore no spectacles, though the imprint between his laughing, dancing eyes was said to have been caused by glasses--soda water glasses which were continually tipped up against his nose in obedience to the dictum that a scout shall be thorough.  \"We'll both stay,\" he said; \"if a Ford comes along we'll carry it across.\"  \"Well, don't leave the spot, that's all,\" said Mr. Denny.  \"Far be it from such,\" said Roy. \"If we go away we'll take it with us. We should worry our young lives about a spot. Only save some stew for us. This night has been full of snap so far, it reminds me of a ginger-snap. We'll sit in one of those old cars, hey?\"  Gilbert Tyson stared at Roy. He thought it wouldn't be half bad to stay here with this sprightly scout. The rest of the party, guided by Mr. Denny, started picking their way along the road to camp, carrying Hervey on a stretcher. Darby Curren, the stage-driver, doubtless tempted by the mention of hot stew, unharnessed his team and leaving the horses to graze in the adjacent field, accompanied the party. Roy and Gilbert Tyson watched the departing cavalcade till it was swallowed in darkness.  The rain had ceased now, and the wind was dying. In the sky was a little silvery break, and by its light flaky clouds were seen hurrying away, all in one direction like a flock of birds. It seemed as if they might be fleeing quietly from the wreck which they had caused.  \"If one of the lights on those cars is working, we might use it for a signal,\" Roy said.  The cars of which he spoke were in the wreckage of Berry's garage. It had not been much of a garage, hardly more than a shack, in fact, and the two cars which now stood more or less damaged and exposed to the weather, had been its only contents, save for a work-bench and a few tools. Mr. Berry's flivver was quite beyond repair, having been overturned and carried some yards and apparently dashed against the bridge. There is no wreck in the world like the wreck of a Ford.  The heavier car had evidently withstood the first onrush of water and had made a stand against the flood, its wheels deep in the mud. This car was a roadster. Its side curtains were up, completely enclosing the single seat. It had evidently been used since the rainy weather started. It was not altogether free from damage, one of the fenders was bent, the bumper in front almost touched the ground on one side, an ornamental figurehead had been broken off the radiator cap, and the face of the radiator was dented. This car was equipped with a searchlight fastened on one end of the windshield, and as Gilbert Tyson handled this it lighted, sending a penetrating shaft of brightness into the night.  \"It's funny the battery works after the soaking it got,\" said Roy. \"Let's keep playing that light on the road. Anybody could see it half a mile off.\"  \"Spell danger with it,\" Gilbert said.  \"Sure, but I don't think anybody from camp will be along.\"  \"You never can tell who knows the Morse Code and who doesn't,\" Gilbert said. \"Keep playing it on the road, anyway.\"  The position of the car was such that this searchlight could be shown upon the road for perhaps the space of a quarter of a mile. It would have been quite sufficient to give pause to any approaching wagon or machine. Roy and Gilbert climbed into the car and sat upon the seat in the cosy enclosure formed by the curtains. It was quite pleasant in there. Since it was more agreeable to be fooling with the light than to let it shine steadily, Roy amused himself by spelling the word DANGER again and again.  Pretty soon one of the curtains opened and a voice said, \"What's all the danger about?\"     CHAPTER XII  THE GRAY ROADSTER   It was Tom Slade. With him was one of the best all-around scouts in camp, patrol leader of the Royal Bengal Tigers, Eagle Scout and winner of the Gold Cross, Bert Winton.  \"What's this? The annual electrical show?\" he asked. \"What's the matter with you kids? Lost, strayed or stolen? Who's this fellow?\"  \"Look at the bridge, it's gone!\" said Roy. \"Don't bother to look at it. It isn't there anyway. We're a couple of pickets--I mean sentinels.\"  \"Well, you guided us through the woods, anyway,\" said Tom.  \"The pleasure is ours,\" said Roy. \"We can sit in a car and guide people through the woods; we're real heroes. What's the news?\"  \"Do you know anything about the stage?\" Tom asked.  \"We know _all_ about it. It's right over there. This fellow comes from Hillsburgh. He got out and walked ahead and stopped it. Didn't you? Hervey Willetts blew in from somewhere or other and they're carrying him to camp. Nothing serious. Got any candy?\"  \"The crowd from the bus is all right then?\"  \"Positively guaranteed.\"  \"And Hervey?\"  \"He's used up another one of his lives, he's only got three left now. He must have hit the trail after Westy and I left the cove. He's going to get called down to-morrow. He should worry, he's used to that.\"  \"Where did they run into him?\" Tom asked.  \"They found him hanging onto one of the horses. Curry thought he was a ghost, that's all _I_ know. This fellow went ahead and shouted back that the bridge had sneaked off. Didn't you, Gilly?\" It was characteristic of Roy that he had already found a nickname for Gilbert Tyson.  \"Hervey say anything?\"  \"Mumbled something, I don't know what.\"  Tom pondered a few moments. \"Humph,\" said he, \"that's all right.\"  He was satisfied about Hervey. The other phases of the episode did not interest him. What scoutmasters said and thought did not greatly concern him. He did not give two thoughts to the fact that Hervey was to be \"called down.\" He had known scouts to be called down before. He had known credit and glory to miscarry. Hervey had done this thing and that was all that the young camp assistant cared about. It would not hurt Hervey to be called down.  The picturesque young assistant, the very spirit and embodiment of adventure and romance, made a good deal of allowance for visiting scoutmasters and handbook scouts. He was broad and kind as the trees are broad and kind; exacting about big things, careless about little things. They knew all about scouting. He was the true scout. They had their manuals and handbooks. The great spirit of the woods was his. Hervey had made good. Why bother more about that?  So he just said, \"Not hurt much, huh? Well, if you kids want to go up to camp, we'll take care of this job.\"  \"Whose car is this, anyway?\" asked Bert Winton. \"I never saw it before. It's got bunged up a little, hey?\"  Tom looked at the roadster rather interestedly, whistling to himself.  \"It's gray,\" said Bert; \"I never saw it before.\"  \"It wasn't damaged in the flood,\" said Tom.  \"Why wasn't it?\" Roy demanded.  \"Because it's facing down stream. Anything that hit it would have hit it in the back. I don't know whose it is, but it came here damaged, if you want to know.\"  \"Sherlock Nobody Holmes, the boy detective,\" vociferated Roy. \"We're not going to let it worry our innocent young lives, anyway, are we, Gilly? Oh, here comes somebody along the road! The plot grows thicker!\"  Tom and Winton had cut through the woods, direct from the cove where they had been assisting in throwing together the makeshift dam. Fortunately the searchlight had made their journey easy. The figure which now approached along the road turned out to be Ebon Berry, owner of the wrecked garage, who had ventured forth from his home as soon as the storm had abated.  \"Well, 'tain't no use cryin' over spilled milk, as the feller says,\" he observed as he contemplated the ruin all about him.  \"You're about cleaned out, Mr. Berry,\" said Winton. \"Whose car is this? I never saw it before.\"  \"That? Well, now, that belongs to a feller that left it here, oh, I dunno, mebbe close onto a week ago. I ain't seed him since. Said he'd be back for it nex' day. I ain't seed nothin' of 'im. I guess that's what you'd call a racer, now, hain't it?\"  \"What are you going to do about it?\" Tom asked. \"It was damaged when it came here, wasn't it?\"  \"Yes, it were. Well, now, I don't jes' know _what_ I'd auter do. Jes' nothin', I guess.\"  \"'Tisn't going to do it any good buried here in the mud,\" Tom said.  \"Well, 'tain't my loss, ony six dollars storage.\"  \"Let's give it the once over,\" Tom said, in a way of half interest. The efforts of the night had been so strenuous that his casual interest in the car was something in the form of relaxation. It interested him as whittling a stick might have interested him."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19590"],["title","Tom Slade's Double Dare (#7)"],["body"," \"Take a squint into that pocket there, Roy.\"  There was nothing but a piece of cotton waste in the flap pocket of the door nearest Roy, but Gilbert Tyson's ransacking of the other one revealed some miscellaneous paraphernalia; there was a pair of motorist's gloves, a road map, a newspaper, and two letters.  \"Here, I'll give you the light,\" said Roy, as Tyson handed these things to Tom.  \"You keep the light on the road,\" said Tom. \"Let's have your flashlight.\"  \"Now we're going to find out where the buried treasure lays hid--I mean hidden,\" said Roy. \"We're going to unravel the mystery, as Pee-wee would say. 'Twas on a dark and stormy night----\"  \"Let's have your flashlight,\" said Tom, dryly.     CHAPTER XIII  THE UNKNOWN TRAIL   Gilbert Tyson and Roy sat in the car. Tyson had removed one curtain and Tom, standing close by, examined the papers in the glare of the flashlight which Tyson held. Bert Winton and Mr. Berry peered curiously over Tom's shoulder.  The map was of the usual folding sort, and on a rather large scale, showing the country for about forty or fifty miles roundabout.  \"There's my little old home town,\" said Tyson, putting his finger on Hillsburgh, \"home, sweet home.\"  \"And here's little old Black Lake--before the flood,\" said Roy. \"There's the camp, right there,\" he added, indicating the spot to Tyson; \"there's where we eat, right there.\"  \"And here's a trail up the mountain,\" said Tom. \"See that lead pencil mark? You go up the back way. See?\"  So there then was indeed a way up that frowning mountain opposite the camp. It was up the less precipitous slope, the slope which did not face the lake. The pencil marking had been made to emphasize the fainter printed line.  \"Humph,\" said Tom, interested. \"There's always _some_ way up a mountain.... Maybe the light we saw up there ... let's have a squint at that letter, will you?\"  \"Have we got a right to read it?\" Winton asked.  \"We may be able to save a life by it,\" said Tom. \"Sure.\"  But the letter did not reveal anything of interest. It was, in fact, only the last page of a letter which had been preserved on account of some trifling memorandums on the back of the sheet. What there was of the letter read as follows:      hope you will come back to England some time or other. I suppose     America seems strange after all these years. You'll have to be     content with shooting Indians and buffaloes now. But we'll save a     fox or two for you. And don't forget how to ride horseback and we'll     try not to forget about the rattle wagons.                                                                    REGGY.  \"That's very kind of Reggy,\" said Roy. \"Indians and buffaloes! Poor Indians. If he ever comes here, we'll teach him to shoot the shutes. If he's a good shot maybe we'll let him shoot the rapids.\"  \"They all think America is full of Indians,\" said Winton.  \"Indian pudding,\" said Roy; \"_mmm, mmm!_\"  \"Well, let's see the newspaper,\" said Tom. \"I don't suppose there's anything particular in that. Somebody that lived in England has been trying to go up the mountain--_maybe_. That's about all we know. We don't know that, even. But anyway, he hasn't come back.\"  \"Maybe he's up there shooting Indians and buffaloes,\" said Roy. \"We should worry.\"  \"When was it he came here?\" Tom asked.  \"'Bout several days ago, I reckon,\" said Mr. Berry.  \"That light's been up there all summer,\" Winton said.  \"Until to-night,\" Tom added.  For a few moments no one spoke.  \"Well, let's see the paper,\" said Tom, as he took it and began looking it over. He had not glanced at many of the headings when one attracted his attention. Following it was an article which he read carefully.                          AUTOIST KILLS CHILD          Negligence and Reckless Driving Responsible for Accident                             DRIVER ESCAPES      An accident which will probably prove fatal occurred on the road     above Hillsburgh yesterday when a car described as a gray     roadster ran down and probably mortally injured Willy Corbett,     the eight-year-old son of Thomas Corbett of that place.      Two laborers in a nearby field, who saw the accident, say     that the machine was running on the left side of the road where     the child was playing and that but for this reckless violation of     the traffic law, the little fellow would not have been run down.     The driver was apparently holding to the left of the road,     because the running was better there.      Exactly what happened no one seems to know. The autoist     stopped, and started again, and when the two laborers had reached     the spot where the child lay, the machine was going at the rate     of at least forty miles an hour.      All efforts of town and county authorities to locate the gray     roadster have failed.  \"That's only about ten miles from where I live,\" said Gilbert Tyson.  Tom seemed to be thinking. \"Let's look at that letter again,\" said he. \"Humph,\" he added and handed it back to Roy.  \"What?\" Roy asked.  \"Nothing,\" said Tom. \"I guess this is the car all right.\"  \"I don't see it,\" said Winton. \"Just because it's a gray roadster----\"  \"Well, there may be other little things about it, too,\" said Tom.  \"About the car or the letter or what?\" Winton asked.  \"Answered in the affirmative,\" said Roy.  \"Well, anyway,\" Tom said, \"it looked as if the owner of the car might have gone up the mountain. And he hasn't come down. At least he hasn't come after his car. I'd like to get a look at him. I'm going to follow that trail up a ways----\"  \"To-night?\"  \"When did you suppose? Next week? I'd like to find out where the trail goes. I'm not saying any more. The bright spot we saw from camp went out to-night. And here's a trail on the other side of the mountain that I never knew of. Here's a man that had a map of it and he went away and hasn't come back. I'm not asking anybody to go with me.\"  \"And I'm not asking you to let me,\" said Roy. \"I'll go just for spite. You don't think you're afraid of me, am I, quoth he. Now that we're here, we might as well be all separated together. What do you say, Gilly? Yes, kind sir, said he. We'll _all_ go, what do you say? Indeed we will, they answered joyously----\"  \"Well, come ahead then,\" said Tom, \"and stop your nonsense.\"  \"Says you,\" Roy answered.     CHAPTER XIV  ON THE SUMMIT   The two facts uppermost in Tom's mind were these: Some one had marked the trail up that mountain, and the patch of brightness on the top of the mountain which had lately been familiar to the boys in camp had that very night disappeared.  The owner of the gray roadster had not come back for it. He might be the fugitive of the newspaper article, and he might not. If Tom had any _particular_ reason for thinking that he was, he did not say so. There are a good many gray roadsters. One thing which puzzled Tom was this: the car had been in storage at Berry's for a few days at the very most, but the bright patch on the mountain had been visible for a month or more. So if the owner of this machine had gone up the mountain, at least he was not the originator of the bright patch there. But perhaps, after all, the bright patch was just some reflection.  [Illustration: SUDDENLY ROY CALLED, \"LOOK HERE! HERE'S A BOARD!\" Tom Slade's Double Dare. Page 83]  \"Let's have another look at that letter,\" said Tom.  He read it again with an interest and satisfaction which certainly were not justified by the simple wording of the missive.  \"Come ahead,\" he said; \"we can't get much wetter than we are already. We might as well finish the night's work. I guess Mr. Berry'll take care of the searchlight.\"  Mr. Berry had no intention of leaving the scene of his ruined possessions to the mercy of vandals. Moreover, it seemed likely that with the abatement of the storm the neighboring village would turn out to view the devastation.  Once the end of the trail was located, the ascent of the mountain was not difficult, and the four explorers made their way up the comparatively easy slope, hindered only by trees which had fallen across the path. The old mountain which frowned so forbiddingly down upon the camp across the lake was very docile when taken from behind. It was just a big bully.  As Tom and the three scouts approached the summit, the devastation caused by the storm became more and more appalling. Great trees had been torn up as if they had been no more than house plants. These had fallen, some to the ground and some against other trees, their spreading roots dislodging big rocks which had gone crashing down against other trees. Some of these rocks remained poised where the least agitation would release them.  Nature cannot be disturbed like this without suffering convulsions afterwards, and the continual low noises of dripping roots and of trees and branches sinking and settling and falling from temporary supports, gave a kind of voice of suffering and anguish to the wilderness.  These strange sounds were on every hand and they made the wrecked and drenched woods to seem haunted. Now and again a sound almost human would startle the cautious wayfarers as they picked their way amid the sodden chaos. In places it seemed as if the merest footfall would dislodge some threatening bowlder which would blot their lives out in a second. And the ragged, gaping chasms left by roots made the soggy ground uncertain support for yards about.  Toward the summit the path was quite obliterated under the jumble of the wreckage, and the party clambered over and threaded their way amid this débris until the tiny but cheering lights of Temple Camp were visible far down across the lake. There the two arriving troops were about finishing their hot stew! Far down and nearer than the camp was a moving speck of light; some one was on the lake. The boys did not venture too near that precipitous descent.  Suddenly Roy, who had been walking along a fallen tree trunk, called, \"Look here! Here's a board!\"  He had hauled it out from under the trunk, and the "]]]
