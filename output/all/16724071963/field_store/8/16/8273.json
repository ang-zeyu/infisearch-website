We call it Goliath on account of its size.  \"Who's to sing the first song,\" asked Goliath. \"A good hearty song!\"  \"One with whiskers on it!\" said the corporal.  \"I'll slash the game up and give a rale ould song, whiskers to the toes of it,\" said Feelan, shoving his sword in its scabbard and throwin' himself flat back on the straw. \"Its a song about the time Irelan' was fightin' for freedom and it's called _The Rising of the Moon_! A great song entirely it is, and I cannot do it justice.\"  Feelan stood up, his legs wide apart and both his thumbs stuck in the upper pockets of his tunic. Behind him the barn stretched out into the gloom that our solitary candle could not pierce. On either side rifles hung from the wall, and packs and haversacks stood high from the straw in which most of the men had buried themselves, leaving nothing but their faces, fringed with the rims of Balaclava helmets, exposed to view. The night was bitterly cold, outside where the sky stood high splashed with countless stars and where the earth gripped tight on (p. 046) itself, the frost fiend was busy; in the barn, with its medley of men, roosting hens and prowling rats all was cosy and warm. Feelan cleared his throat and commenced the song, his voice strong and clear filled the barn:--    \"Arrah! tell me Shan O'Farrel; tell me why you hurry so?\"   \"Hush, my bouchal, hush and listen,\" and his cheeks were all aglow--   \"I've got orders from the Captain to get ready quick and soon   For the pikes must be together at the risin' of the moon,         At the risin' of the moon!         At the risin' of the moon!   And the pikes must be together at the risin' of the moon!\"  \"That's some song,\" said the corporal. \"It has got guts in it. I'm sick of these ragtime rotters!\"  \"The old songs are always the best ones,\" said Feelan, clearing his throat preparatory to commencing a second verse.  \"What about _Uncle Joe_?\" asked Goliath, and was off with a regimental favourite.    When Uncle Joe plays a rag upon his old banjo--       (\"Oh!\" the occupants of the barn yelled.)   Ev'rybody starts a swayin' to and fro--             (\"Ha!\" exclaimed the barn.)   Mummy waddles all around the cabin floor!--               (\"What!\" we chorused.)   Crying, \"Uncle Joe, give us more, give us more!\"  \"Give us no more of that muck!\" exclaimed Feelan, burrowing into   (p. 047) the straw, no doubt a little annoyed at being interrupted in his song. \"Damn ragtime!\"  \"There's ginger in it!\" said Goliath. \"Your old song is as flat as French beer!\"  \"Some decent music is what you want,\" said Bill Sykes, and forthwith began strumming an invisible banjo and humming _Way down upon the Swanee Ribber_.  The candle, the only one in our possession, burned closer to the cheese sconce, a daring rat slipped into the light, stopped still for a moment on top of a sheaf of straw, then scampered off again, shadows danced on the roof, over the joists where the hens were roosting, an unsheathed sword glittered brightly as the light caught it, and Feelan lifted the weapon and glanced at it.  \"Burnished like a lady's nail,\" he muttered.  \"Thumb nail?\" interrogated Goliath.  \"Ragnail, p'raps,\" said the Cockney.  \"I wonder whether we'll have much bayonet-fightin' or not?\" remarked the Jersey boy, looking at each of us in turn and addressing no one in particular.  \"We'll get some now and again to keep us warm!\" said the corporal. (p. 048) \"It'll be 'ot when it comes along.\"  \"'Ot's not the word,\" said Bill; \"I never was much drawn to soldierin' 'fore the war started, but when it came along I felt I'd like to 'ave a 'and in the gime. There, that candle's goin' out!\"  \"Bunk!\" roared the corporal, putting his pipe in his pocket and seizing a blanket, the first to hand. Almost immediately he was under the straw with the blanket wrapped round him. We were not backward in following, and all were in bed when the flame which followed the wax so greedily died for lack of sustenance.  To-morrow night we should be in the trenches.     CHAPTER V                                                          (p. 049)  FIRST BLOOD    The nations like Kilkenny cats,   Full of hate that never dies out,   Tied tail to tail, hung o'er a rope,   Still strive to tear each other's eyes out.   The company came to a halt in the village; we marched for three miles, and the morning being a hot one we were glad to fall out and lie down on the pavement, packs well up under our shoulders and our legs stretched out at full length over the kerbstone into the gutter. The sweat stood out in beads on the men's foreheads and trickled down their cheeks on to their tunics. The white dust of the roadway settled on boots, trousers, and putties, and rested in fine layers on haversack folds and cartridge pouches. Rifles and bayonets, spotless in the morning's inspection, had lost all their polished lustre and were gritty to the touch. We carried a heavy load, two hundred rounds of ball cartridge, a loaded rifle with five rounds in magazine, a pack stocked with overcoat, spare underclothing, and other field        (p. 050) necessaries, a haversack containing twenty-four hours rations, and sword and entrenching tool per man. We were equipped for battle and were on our way towards the firing line.  A low-set man with massive shoulders, bull-neck and heavy jowl had just come out of an _estaminet_, a mess-tin of beer in his hand, and knife and fork stuck in his putties.  \"Going up to the slaughter line, mateys?\" he enquired, an amused smile hovering about his eyes, which took us all in with one penetrating glance.  \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Have you been long out here?\"  \"About a matter of nine months.\"  \"You've been lucky,\" said Mervin, my mate.  \"I haven't gone West yet, if that's what you mean,\" was the answer. \"'Oo are you?\"  \"The London Irish.\"  \"Territorials?\"  \"That's us,\" someone said.  \"First time up this way?\"  \"First time.\"  \"I knew that by the size of your packs,\" said the man, the smile reaching his lips. \"Bloomin' pack-horses you look like. If you want a word of advice, sling your packs over a hedge, keep a tight grip   (p. 051) of your mess-tin, and ram your spoon and fork into your putties. My pack went West at Mons.\"  \"You were there then?\"  \"Blimey, yes.\" was the answer.  \"How did you like it?\"  \"Not so bad,\" said the man. \"'Ave a drink and pass the mess-tin round. There is only one bad shell, that's the one that 'its you, and if you're unlucky it'll come your way. The same about the bullet with your number on it; it can't miss you if it's made for you. And if ever you go into a charge--Think of your pals, matey!\" he roared at the man who was greedily gulping down the contents of the mess-tin, \"You're swigging all the stuff yourself. For myself I don't care much for this beer, it has no guts in it, one good English pint is worth an ocean of this dashed muck. Good-bye\"--we were moving off, \"and good luck to you!\"  Mervin, perspiring profusely, marched by my side. He and I have been great comrades, we have worked, eaten, and slept together, and committed sin in common against regimental regulations. Mervin has been a great traveller, he has dug for gold in the Yukon, grown oranges in Los Angeles, tapped for rubber in Camerango (I don't    (p. 052) know where the place is, but I love the name), and he can eat a tin of bully beef, and relish the meal. He is the only man in our section who can enjoy it, one of us cares only for cheese, and few grind biscuits when they can beg bread.  A battalion is divided into four companies, a company contains four platoons made up of sections of unequal strength; our section consisted of thirteen--there are only four boys left now, Mervin has been killed, five have been wounded, two have become stretcher bearers, and one has left us to join another company in which one of his mates is placed. Poor Mervin! How sad it was to lose him, and much sadder is it for his sweetheart in England. He was engaged; often he told me of his dreams of a farm, a quiet cottage and a garden at home when the war came to an end. Somewhere in a soldier's grave he sleeps. I know not where he lies, but one day, if the fates spare me, I will pay a visit to the resting-place of a true comrade and a staunch friend.  Outside the village we formed into single file. It was reported that the enemy shelled the road daily, and only three days before the Royal Engineers lost thirty-seven men when going up to the trenches on the same route. In the village all was quiet, the _cafés_ were open,   (p. 053) and old men, women, and boys were about their daily work as usual. There were very few young men of military age in the place; all were engaged in the business of war.  A file marched on each side of the road. Mervin was in front of me; Stoner, a slender youth, tall as a lance and lithe as a poplar, marched behind, smoking a cigarette and humming a tune. He worked as a clerk in a large London club whose members were both influential and wealthy. When he joined the army all his pay was stopped, and up to the present he has received from his employers six bars of chocolate and four old magazines. His age is nineteen, and his job is being kept open for him. He is one of the cheeriest souls alive, a great worker, and he loves to listen to the stories which now and again I tell to the section. When at St. Albans he spent six weeks in hospital suffering from tonsilitis. The doctor advised him to stay at home and get his discharge; he is still with us, and once, during our heaviest bombardment, he slept for a whole eight hours in his dug-out. All the rest of us remained awake, feeling certain that our last hour had come.  Teak and Kore, two bosom chums, marched on the other side of the   (p. 054) road. Both are children almost; they may be nineteen, but neither look it; Kore laughs deep down in his throat, and laughs heartiest when his own jokes amuse the listeners."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19710"],["title","The Red Horizon (#5)"],["body"," is not fashioned in a strong mould, but is an elegant marcher, and light of limb; he may be a clerk in business, but as he is naturally secretive we know nothing of his profession. Kore is also a punster who makes abominable puns; these amuse nobody except, perhaps, himself. Teak, a good fellow, is known to us as Bill Sykes. He has a very pale complexion, and has the most delightful nose in all the world; it is like a little white potato. Bill is a good-humored Cockney, and is eternally involved in argument. He carries a Jew's harp and a mouth-organ, and when not fingering one he is blowing music-hall tunes out of the other.  Goliath, six foot three of bone and muscle, is a magnificent animal. The gods forgot little of their old-time cunning in the making of him, in the forging of his shoulders, massive as a bull's withers, in the shaping of his limbs, sturdy as pillars of granite and supple as willows, in the setting of his well-poised head, his heavy jaw,    (p. 055) and muscled neck. But the gods seem to have grown weary of a momentous masterpiece when they came to the man's eyes, and Goliath wears glasses. For all that he is a good marksman and, strange to say, he delights in the trivialities of verse, and carries an earmarked Tennyson about with him.  Pryor is a pessimist, an artist, a poet, a writer of stories; he drifted into our little world on the march and is with us still. He did not like his previous section and applied for a transfer into ours. He gloats over sunsets, colours, unconventional doings, hopes that he will never marry a girl with thick ankles, and is certain that he will never live to see the end of the War. Pryor, Teak, Kore, and Stoner have never used a razor; they are as beardless as babes.  We were coming near the trenches. In front, the two lines of men stretched on as far as the eye could see; we were near the rear and singing _Macnamara's Band_, a favourite song with our regiment. Suddenly a halt was called. A heap of stones bounded the roadway, and we sat down, laying our rifles on the fine gravel.  The crash came from the distance, probably five hundred yards in front, and it sounded like a waggon-load of rubble being emptied on a     (p. 056) landing and clattering down a flight of stairs.  \"What's that?\" asked Stoner, flicking the ash from the tip of his cigarette with the little finger.  \"Some transport has broken down.\"  \"Perhaps it's a shell,\" I ventured, not believing what I said.  \"Oh! your grandmother.\"  Whistling over our head it came with a swish similar to that made by a wet sheet shaken in the wind, and burst in the field on the other side of the road. A ball of white smoke poised for a moment in mid-air, curled slowly upwards, and gradually faded away. I looked at my mates. Stoner was deadly pale; it seemed as if all the blood had rushed away from his face. Teak's mouth was a little open, his cigarette, sticking to his upper lip, hung down quivering, and the ash was falling on his tunic; a smile almost of contempt played on Pryor's face, and Goliath yawned. At the time I wondered if he were posing. He spoke:--  \"There's only one bad shell, you know,\" he said. \"It hasn't come this way yet. See that woman?\" He pointed at the field where the shell  (p. 057) had exploded. At the far end a woman was working with a hoe, her head bowed over her work, and her back bent almost double. Two children, a boy and a girl, came along the road hand in hand, and deep in a childish discussion. The world, the fighting men, and the bursting shells were lost to them. They were intent on their own little affairs. For ourselves we felt more than anything else a sensation of surprise--surprise because we were not more afraid of the bursting shrapnel.  \"Quick march!\"  We got to our feet and resumed our journey. We were now passing through a village where several houses had been shattered, and one was almost levelled to the ground. But beside it, almost intact, although not a pane of glass remained in the windows, stood a _café_. A pale stick of a woman in a white apron, with arms akimbo, stood on the threshold with a toddling infant tugging at her petticoats.  Several French soldiers were inside, seated round a table, drinking beer and smoking. One man, a tall, angular fellow with a heavy beard, seemed to be telling a funny story; all his mates were laughing heartily. A horseman came up at this moment, one of our soldiers,  (p. 058) and his horse was bleeding at the rump, where a red, ugly gash showed on the flesh.  \"Just a splinter of shell,\" he said, in answer to our queries. \"The one that burst there,\" he pointed with his whip towards the field where the shrapnel had exploded: \"'Twas only a whistler.\"  \"What did you think of it,\" I called to Stoner.  \"I didn't know what to think first,\" was the answer, \"then when I came to myself I thought it might have done for me, and I got a kind of shock just like I'd get when I have a narrow shave with a 'bus in London.\"  \"And you, Pryor?\"  \"I went cold all over for a minute.\"  \"Bill?\"  \"Oh! Blast them is what I say!\" was his answer. \"If it's going to do you in 'twill do you in, and that's about the end of it. Well, sing a song to cheer us up,\" and without another word he began to bellow out one of our popular rhymes.    Oh! the Irish boys they are the boys   To drive the Kaiser balmy.   And _we'll_ smash up that fool Von Kluck   And all his bloomin' army!  We came to a halt again, this time alongside a Red Cross motor     (p. 059) ambulance. In front, with the driver, one of our boys was seated; his coat sleeve ripped from the shoulder, and blood trickling down his arm on to his clothes; inside, on the seat, was another with his right leg bare and a red gash showing above the knee. He looked dazed, but was smoking a cigarette.  \"Stopped a packet, matey?\" Stoner enquired.  \"Got a scratch, but it's not worth while talking about,\" was the answer. \"I'll remember you to your English friends when I get back.\"  \"You're all right, matey,\" said a regular soldier who stood on the pavement, addressing the wounded man. \"I'd give five pounds for a wound like that. You're damned lucky, and its your first journey!\"  \"Have you been long out here?\" asked Teak.  \"Only about nine months,\" replied the regular. \"There are seven of the old regiment left, and it makes me wish this damned business was over and done with.\"  \"Ye don't like war, then.\"  \"Like it! Who likes it? only them that's miles away from the stinks, and cold, and heat, and everything connected with the ---- work.\"  (p. 060)  \"But this is a holy war,\" said Pryor, an inscrutable smile playing round his lips. \"God's with us, you know.\"  \"We're placing more reliance on gunpowder than on God,\" I remarked.  \"Blimey! talk about God!\" said the regular.  \"There's more of the damned devil in this than there is of anything else. They take us out of the trenches for a rest, send us to church, and tell us to love our neighbours. Blimey! next day they send you up to the trenches again and tell you to kill like 'ell.\"  \"Have you ever been in a bayonet charge?\" asked Stoner.  \"Four of them,\" we were told, \"and I don't like the blasted work, never could stomach it.\"  The ambulance waggon whirred off, and the march was resumed.  We were now about a mile from the enemy's lines, and well into the province of death and desolation. We passed the last ploughman. He was a mute, impotent figure, a being in rags, guiding his share, and turning up little strips of earth on his furrowed world. The old home, now a jumble of old bricks getting gradually hidden by the green grasses, the old farm holed by a thousand shells, the old plough,  (p. 061) and the old horses held him in bondage. There was no other world for the man; he was a dumb worker, crawling along at the rear of the destructive demon War, repairing, as far as he was able, the damage which had been done.  We came to a village, literally buried. Holes dug by high explosive shells in the roadway were filled up with fallen masonry. This was a point at which the transports stopped. Beyond this, man was the beast of burden--the thing that with scissors-like precision cut off, pace by pace, the distance between him and the trenches. There is something pathetic in the forward crawl, in the automatic motion of boots rising and falling at the same moment; the gleaming sword handles waving backwards and forwards over the hip, and, above all, in the stretcher-bearers with stretchers slung over their shoulders marching along in rear. The march to battle breathes of something of an inevitable event, of forces moving towards a destined end. All individuality is lost, the thinking ego is effaced, the men are spokes in a mighty wheel, one moving because the other must, all fearing death as hearty men fear it, and all bent towards the same goal.  We were marched to a red brick building with a shrapnel-shivered   (p. 062) roof, and picks and shovels were handed out to us.  \"You've got to help to widen the communication trench to-day!\" we were told by an R.E. officer who had taken charge of our platoon.  As we were about to start a sound made quite familiar to me what time I was in England as a marker at our rifle butts, cut through the air, and at the same moment one of the stray dogs which haunt their old and now unfamiliar localities like ghosts, yelled in anguish as he was sniffing the gutter, and dropped limply to the pavement. A French soldier who stood in a near doorway pulled the cigarette from his bearded lips, pointed it at the dead animal, and laughed. A comrade who was with him shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly.  \"That dashed sniper again!\" said the R.E. officer.  \"Where is he?\" somebody asked innocently.  \"I wish we knew,\" said the officer. \"He's behind our lines somewhere, and has been at this game for weeks. Keep clear of the roadway!\" he cried, as another bullet swept through the air, and struck the wall over the head of the laughing Frenchman, who was busily rolling "]]]
