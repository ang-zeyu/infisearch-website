ARMS. It is executed in 3 counts.  Press the butt down quickly and throw the gun diagonally across the body, to the position shown here.  At the command two, lower the gun and assume the next to the last position of order arms. At the command three, come to the order arms.  The common errors in this movement are to move the head to the left and to throw the gun too far to the front.  [Illustration]  Being at port arms: 1. Right shoulder, 2. ARMS. It is executed in three counts.  At the command arms, change the right hand to the butt.  At the command two and three, come to the right shoulder as from order arms.  Being at right shoulder arms: 1. Port, 2. ARMS. It is executed in two counts.  At the command arms, press the butt down quickly and throw the piece to the diagonal position across the body with the left hand grasping it at the balance; the right hand retaining its grasp of the butt.  At the command two, change the right hand to the small of the stock.  Being at right shoulder arms: 1. Present, 2. ARMS. It is executed in three counts.  At the command arms, execute port arms. (This requires two counts.) At the command three, execute present arms.  Being at present arms: 1. Right shoulder, 2. ARMS. It is executed in four counts.  At the command arms, execute port arms. At the command two, three, four, execute right shoulder arms as from port arms.  Being at port arms: 1. Left shoulder, 2. ARMS. It is executed in two counts.  [Illustration: THE NEXT TO THE LAST POSITION OF THE LEFT SHOULDER ARMS]  At the command ARMS, carry the piece with the right hand and place it on the left shoulder; at the same time grasp the butt with the left hand, heel between first and second fingers. Thumb and fingers of right hand closed on the stock. Barrel up, trigger guard in the hollow of the shoulder.  [Illustration: No. 1 No. 2 No.3  COMMON ERRORS IN THE NEXT TO THE LAST POSITION OF LEFT SHOULDER ARMS]  No. 1. Right arm too high. Butt too high.  No. 2. Butt too close to center of body. Not grasping gun correctly with fingers of left hand.  No. 3. Right arm too high. Butt too high.  At the command two, drop the right hand by the side.  [Illustration: THE CORRECT POSITION OF LEFT SHOULDER ARMS]  The incorrect positions are usually the same as are found in the right shoulder arms, and as illustrated here.  [Illustration]  Being at left shoulder arms: 1. Port, 2. ARMS. It is executed in two counts.  At the command arms, grasp the piece with the right hand at the small of the stock.  At the command two, carry the piece, with the right hand to the position of port arms, regrasp it with the left.  Left shoulder arms may be ordered from the order, right shoulder or present, or the reverse. At the command arms, execute port arms and continue to the position ordered.  Being at order arms: 1. Parade, 2. REST. It is executed in one count.  At the command rest, carry muzzle in front of the center of the body, barrel to the left. Grasp piece with the left hand just below the stacking swivel, and with the right hand below and against the left. Left knee slightly bent. Carry the right foot 6 inches straight to the rear.  [Illustration: CORRECT POSITION OF PARADE REST]  Being at parade rest: 1. Squad, 2. ATTENTION. Executed in one count.  At the command attention (it is a custom of the service to execute the movement at the last syllable of the command), resume the order, the left hand quitting the piece opposite the right hip.  Being at order arms: 1. Trail, 2. ARMS.  At the command arms, raise the piece, right arm slightly bent, and incline the muzzle forward so that the barrel makes an angle of about 30° with the vertical.  When it can be done without danger or inconvenience to others, the piece may be grasped at the balance and the muzzle lowered until the piece is horizontal; a similar position in the left hand may be used.  [Illustration: CORRECT POSITION OF TRAIL ARMS  Being at trail arms: 1. Order, 2. ARMS.  At the command arms, lower the gun with the right hand and resume the order.]  Being at right shoulder arms: 1. Rifle, 2. SALUTE. It is executed in two counts.  At the command salute, carry the left hand smartly to the small of the stock, forearm horizontal, palm of hand down, thumb and fingers joined, forefinger touching end of cocking piece. Look toward the person saluted. At the command two, drop the hand by the side; turn the head and eyes to the front.  [Illustration: THE CORRECT POSITION OF RIFLE SALUTE, BEING AT RIGHT SHOULDER ARMS.]  [Illustration: COMMON ERRORS IN RIFLE SALUTE AT RIGHT SHOULDER ARMS.  No. 1. Left elbow too low. Forearm should be horizontal.  No. 2. Left elbow too high. Fingers not extended and joined.]  Being at order or trail arms: 1. Rifle, 2. SALUTE.  At the command salute, carry the left hand smartly to the right side, palm of the hand down, thumb and fingers extended and joined, forefinger against piece near the muzzle; look toward the person saluted. At the command two, drop the left hand by the side; turn the head and eyes to the front.  [Illustration: RIFLE SALUTE BEING AT ORDER ARMS]  [Illustration: COMMON ERRORS IN RIFLE SALUTE AT ORDER OR TRAIL ARMS  No. 1. Fingers not extended and joined.  No. 2. Fingers not joined. Gun held too high.]  Being at order arms: 1. Fix, 2. BAYONET.  If the bayonet scabbard is carried on the belt: execute parade rest; grasp the bayonet with the right hand, back of hand toward the body; draw the bayonet from the scabbard and fix it on the barrel, glancing at the muzzle; resume the order.  If the bayonet is carried on the haversack: draw the bayonet with the left hand and fix it in the most convenient manner.  Being at order arms: 1. Unfix, 2. BAYONET.  If the bayonet scabbard is carried on the belt: Execute parade rest; grasp the handle of the bayonet firmly with the right hand, pressing the spring with the forefinger of the right hand; raise the bayonet until the handle is about 12 inches above the muzzle of the piece; drop the point to the left, back of the hand toward the body, and, glancing at the scabbard, return the bayonet, the blade passing between the left arm and the body; regrasp the piece with the right hand and resume the order.  If the bayonet scabbard is carried on the haversack: Take the bayonet from the rifle with the left hand and return it to the scabbard in the most convenient manner.  If marching or laying down, the bayonet is fixed and unfixed in the most expeditious and convenient manner and the piece returned to the original position.  Fix and unfix bayonet are executed with promptness and regularity but not in cadence.  Exercises for instruction in bayonet combat are prescribed in the Manual for Bayonet Exercise.  Being at order arms: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS.  At the command arms, take the position of port arms; at the command two, seize the bolt handle with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, turn the handle up, draw the bolt back, and glance at the chamber. Having found the chamber empty, or having emptied it, raise the head and eyes to the front. Keep your right hand on the bolt.  [Illustration: INSPECTION ARMS]  It is a very common error to change the position of the piece while drawing the bolt back. Guard against this.  Being at inspection arms: 1. Order (or right shoulder, or port), 2. ARMS.  At the preparatory command (i.e., at the command order), push the bolt forward, turn the handle down, pull the trigger, and resume port arms. At the command arms, complete the movement ordered.    TO DISMISS THE SQUAD   Being at a halt: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Port, 4. ARMS, 5. DISMISSED.  Make a point of becoming sufficiently familiar with the different parts of the rifle to obey the following general rules governing the manual.  The following rules govern the carrying of the piece:  First. the piece is not carried with cartridges in either the chamber or the magazine except when specifically ordered. When so loaded, or supposed to be loaded, it is habitually carried locked; that is, with the safety lock turned to the \"safe.\" At all other times it is carried unlocked with the trigger pulled.  Second. Whenever troops are formed under arms, pieces are immediately inspected at the commands: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Order (right shoulder, port), 4. ARMS.  A similar inspection is made immediately before dismissal.  If cartridges are found in the chamber or magazine they are removed and placed in the belt.  Third. The cut-off is kept turned \"off\" except when cartridges are actually used.  Fourth. The bayonet is not fixed except in bayonet exercise, on guard, or for combat.  Fifth. Fall in is executed with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],["title","The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#5)"],["body","piece at the order arms. Fall out, rest, and at ease are executed as without arms. On resuming attention the position of order arms is taken.  Sixth. If at the order, unless otherwise prescribed, the piece is brought to the right shoulder at the command march, the three motions corresponding with the first three steps. Movements may be executed at the trail by prefacing the preparatory command with the words at trail; as, 1. At trail, forward, 2. MARCH; the trail is taken at the command march.  When the facings, alignments, open and close ranks, taking interval or distance, and assemblings are executed from the order, raise the piece to the trail while in motion and resume the order on halting.  Seventh. The piece is brought to the order on halting. The execution of the order begins when the halt is completed.  Eighth. A disengaged hand in double time is held as when without arms.  The following rules govern the execution of the manual of arms:  First. In all positions of the left hand at the balance (center of gravity, bayonet unfixed) the thumb clasps the piece; the sling is included in the grasp of the hand.  Second. In all positions of the piece, \"diagonally across the body\" the position of the piece, left arm and hand are the same as in port arms.  Third. In resuming the order from any position in the manual, the motion next to the last concludes with the butt of the piece about 3 inches from the ground, barrel to the rear, the left hand above and near the right, steadying the piece, fingers extended and joined, forearm and wrist straight and inclining downward, all fingers of the right hand grasping the piece. To complete the order, lower the piece gently to the ground with the right hand, drop the left quickly by the side, and take the position of order arms.  Allowing the piece to drop through the right hand to the ground, or other similar abuse of the rifle to produce effect in executing the manual, is prohibited.  Fourth. The cadence of the motions is that of quick time; the recruits are first required to give their whole attention to the details of the motions, the cadence being gradually acquired as they become accustomed to handling their pieces. The instructor may require them to count aloud in cadence with the motions.  Fifth. The manual is taught at a halt and the movements are, for the purpose of instruction, divided into motions and executed in detail; in this case the command of execution determines the prompt execution of the first motion, and the commands, two, three, four, that of the other motions.  To execute the movements in detail, the instructor first cautions: By the numbers; all movements divided into motions are then executed as above explained until he cautions: Without the numbers; or commands movements other than those in the manual of arms.  Sixth. Whenever circumstances require, the regular positions of the manual of arms and the firings may be ordered without regard to the previous position of the piece.  Under exceptional conditions of weather or fatigue the rifle may be carried in any manner directed.     CHAPTER IV  SCHOOL OF THE SQUAD  Based on the Infantry Drill Regulations    CLOSE ORDER DRILLS   For several days after reporting you will undergo many hours of close order drill. You will ask yourself, \"Why is all this mental and physical strain necessary when these exercises are not used in battle?\" The answer is: they are disciplinary exercises and are designed to inculcate that prompt and subconscious obedience which is essential to proper military control and to teach you precise and soldierly movements; hence, they are executed at attention.    DEFINITIONS   Deploy. To extend the front. A squad deploys when it goes \"As skirmishers.\" A company likewise deploys when it goes from column into line.  File. Two men, the front rank man and the corresponding man in the rear rank. The front rank man is the file leader. A file which has no rear rank man is a blank file.  Interval. Space between elements of the same line. The interval between men in ranks is 4 inches and is measured from elbow to elbow. It is to get this interval that each man is required to raise his arm when the company is formed.  Distance. Space between elements in the direction of depth. It is measured from the back of the man in front to the breast of the man in rear. The rear rank when in line or column is 40 inches from the front rank.  The guide of a squad in line is right unless otherwise announced.  The guide of a squad deployed, (i.e., skirmishers) is center unless otherwise announced.    TO FORM THE SQUAD   To form the squad the instructor places himself 3 paces in front of where the center is to be and commands: Fall in.  The men assemble at attention, pieces at the order, and are arranged by the corporal in double rank, as nearly as practicable in order of height from right to left, each man dropping his left hand as soon as the man on his left has his interval. The rear rank forms with distance of 40 inches.  The instructor then commands: Count off.  At this command all except the right file execute eyes right, and beginning on the right, the men in each rank count one, two, three, four--one, two, three, four; each man turns his head and eyes to the front as he counts.  Pieces are then inspected.  [Illustration]  The purpose of putting the left hand on the hip is to get enough elbow room. A man should have sufficient space to operate his piece. These four-inch intervals give it to him.  [Illustration]  Note the space between elbows (interval) is 4 inches. The space between the front and rear rank (distance) is 40 inches, and is measured from the back of the man in front to the breast of the man in the rear.    ALIGNMENTS   To align the squad, the base file or files having been established: 1. Right (left), 2. DRESS, 3. FRONT.  At the command dress, all men place the left hand upon the hip (whether dressing to the right or left); each man, except the base file, when on or near the new lines executes eyes right, and, taking steps of 2 or 3 inches, places himself so that his right arm rests lightly against the elbow of the man on his right (vice versa in left dressing), and so that his eyes and shoulders are in line with those of the men on his right, and also that each man can see the eyes of at least two men on his right.  [Illustration]  The instructor verifies the alignment of both ranks from the right flank and orders up or back such men as may be in the rear, or in advance, of the line; only the men designated move.  At the command front, given when the ranks are aligned, each man turns his head and eyes to the front and drops his left hand by his side.  There are in dressing a number of common errors that we should try to avoid. Don't jab the man on your left with your elbow. If you are not on the line, move your feet. Don't lean forward or backward. Be sure to touch gently the man on your right with your right arm. Be certain to keep your left elbow forced well to the front. This is a little uncomfortable at first, but unless we do this our arms will not measure the 4 inches correctly. Don't hump up the left shoulder, and don't turn the shoulders to the right. Keep fingers of left hand extended and joined.  We want to place especial stress on the importance of three movements in the school of the squad. When you have thoroughly mastered these three, you will have a splendid basis for the remainder of the School of the Squad, the full value of which you will later appreciate. These are: Squad right, Squad right about, and Right turn.  The first line drawing in this chapter shows correct proportions of interval and distance. To save space and for convenience, the drawings hereafter are made without regard to proportions (intervals and distances).    First Movement   SQUAD RIGHT  Being in line, to turn and march: 1. Squad right (left), 2. MARCH.  In this movement many instructors have recruit squads step off on the 7th count. When the drill progresses the squad should step off on the 5th count.  [Illustration: This is what we have  This is what we want]  At the command march, No. 1 in the front rank faces to the right in marching and marks time; Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of the front rank turn 45 degrees to the right (right oblique), place themselves abreast (on the same line) of No. 1 and mark time.  Now it is difficult quickly to understand the movements of the rear rank. Give them a lot of study and don't go on until you are certain that you understand.  [Illustration: This is the way it is done.]  No. 3 moves straight to the front.  No. 2 follows No. 3.  No. 1 follows No. 2.  When they (Nos. 3, 2 and 1) arrive in rear of their file leaders, (Nos. 3, 2 and 1, front rank) they face to the right in marching and mark time.  No. 4 of the rear rank moves straight to the front four paces, and places himself abreast of No. 3, rear rank.  When No. 4, front rank, and No. 4, rear rank, are on the line, (and the remainder of the squad must glance toward them to see when that is true), the whole squad moves forward without further command.  Note that we have said that No. 1 front rank marks time. We see that he becomes, temporarily, an immovable pivot for his squad. We, therefore, call him a fixed pivot.  Had the command been squad left, instead of squad right, No. 4 would have been the fixed pivot instead of No. 1.  Being in line, to turn and halt: 1. Squad right (left), 2. MARCH, 3. Squad, 4. HALT.  The turn is executed as prescribed in the preceding case except that all men, on arriving on the new line, mark time until the command halt is given, when all halt.  Whenever the third command (i.e., squad) is given means that the command halt is to follow. This is caution to the squad to prepare to halt. The command halt should be given as No. 4 arrives on the line.    Second Movement   SQUAD RIGHT ABOUT  Being in line, to turn about and march: 1. Squad right (left) about, 2. MARCH.
