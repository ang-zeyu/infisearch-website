Singularly enough, that part of the curious drama which unfolded itself at Temple Camp is the very part which was never material for glaring headlines.  The main occurrence is familiar enough to the inhabitants of the neighborhood about the scout camp, but the sequel has never been told, for scouts do not seek notoriety, and the quiet woodland community in its sequestered hills is as remote from the turmoil and gossip of the world as if it were located at the North Pole.  But I know the story of Aaron Harlowe from beginning to end, and the part that Tom Slade played in it, and all the latter history of Goliath, as they called him. And I purpose to set all these matters down for your entertainment, for I think that first and last they make a pretty good camp-fire yarn.         *       *       *       *       *  For a week it had been raining at Temple Camp, and the ground was soggy from the continuous downpour. The thatched roofs of the more primitive type of cabins looked bedrabbled, like the hair of a bather emerging from the lake, and the more substantial shelters were crowded with the overflow from these and from tents deserted by troops and patrols that had been almost drowned out.  The grub boards out under the elm trees had been removed to the main pavilion. The diving springboard was submerged by the swollen lake, the rowboats rocked logily, half full of water, and the woods across the lake looked weird and dim through the incessant stream of rain, rain, rain.  The spring which supplied the camp and for years had been content to bubble in its modest abode among the rocks, burst forth from its shady and sequestered prison and came tumbling, roaring down out of the woods, like some boisterous marauder, and rushed headlong into the lake.  Being no respecter of persons, the invader swept straight through the cabin of the Silver Fox Patrol, and the Silver Fox Patrol took up their belongings and went over to the pavilion where they sat along the deep veranda with others, their chairs tilted back, watching the gloomy scene across the lake.  \"This is good weather for the race,\" said Roy Blakeley.  \"What race?\" demanded Pee-wee Harris.  \"The human race. No sooner said than stung. It's good weather to study monotony.\"  \"All we can do is eat,\" said Pee-wee.  \"Right the first time,\" Roy responded. \"There's only one thing you don't like about meals and that's the time between them.\"  \"What are we going to do for two hours, waiting for supper?\" a scout asked.  \"Search _me_,\" said Roy; \"tell riddles, I guess. If we had some ham we'd have some ham and eggs, if we only had some eggs. We should worry. It's going to rain for forty-eight hours and three months more. That's what that scout from Walla-Walla told me.\"  \"That's a dickens of a name for a city,\" said Westy Martin of Roy's patrol.  \"It's a nice place, they liked it so much they named it twice,\" Roy said.  \"There's a troop here all the way from Salt Lake,\" said Dorry Benton.  \"They ought to have plenty of pep,\" said Roy.  \"There's a troop came from Hoboken, too,\" Will Dawson observed.  \"I don't blame them,\" Roy said. \"There's a troop coming from Kingston next week. They've got an Eagle Scout, I understand.\"  \"Don't you suppose I know that?\" Pee-wee shouted. \"Uncle Jeb had a letter from them yesterday; I saw it.\"  \"Was it in their own handwriting?\"  \"What do you mean?\" Pee-wee demanded disgustedly. \"How can a troop have a handwriting?\"  \"They must be very ignorant,\" Roy said. \"Can you send an animal by mail?\"  \"Sure you can't!\" Pee-wee shouted.  \"That's where you're wrong,\" said Roy. \"I got a letter with a seal on it.\"  \"Can you unscramble eggs?\" Pee-wee demanded.  \"There you go, talking about eats again. Can't you wait two hours?\"  There was nothing to do but wait, and watch the drops as they pattered down on the lake.  \"This is the longest rain in history except the reign of Queen Elizabeth,\" Roy said. \"If I ever meet Saint Swithin----\"  This sort of talk was a sample of life at Temple Camp for seven days past. Those who were not given to jollying and banter had fallen back on checkers and dominos and other wild sports. A few of the more adventurous and reckless made birchbark ornaments, while those who were in utter despair for something to do wrote letters home.  Several dauntless spirits had braved the rain to catch some fish, but the fish, themselves disgusted, stayed down at the bottom of the lake, out of the wet, as Roy said. It was so wet that even the turtles wouldn't come out without umbrellas.  Rain, rain, rain. It flowed off the pavilion roof like a waterfall. It shrunk tent canvas which pulled on the ropes and lifted the pegs out of the soggy ground. It buried the roads in mud. Hour in and hour out the scouts sat along the back of the deep veranda, beguiling their enforced leisure with banter and riddles and camp gossip.  On Friday afternoon a brisk wind arose and blew the rain sideways so that most of the scouts withdrew from their last entrenchment and went inside. You have to take off your hat to a rain which can drive a scout in out of the open.  It began blowing in across the veranda in fitful little gusts and within an hour the wind had lashed itself into a gale. A few of the hardier spirits, including Roy, held their ground on the veranda, squeezing back against the shingled side whenever an unusually severe gust assailed them.  There is no such thing as twilight in such weather, but the sodden sky grew darker, and the mountainside across the lake became gloomier and more forbidding as the night drew on apace.  The few remaining stragglers on the veranda watched this darkening scene with a kind of idle half interest, ducking the occasional gusts.  \"How would you like to be out on the lake now?\" one asked.  The question directed their gaze out upon the churning, black sheet of water before them. The lake, lying amid those frowning, wooded hills, was somber enough at all times, and a quiet gloom pervaded it which imparted a rare charm. But now, in the grip of the rain and wind, the enshrouding night made the lake seem like a place haunted, and the enclosing mountains desolate and forlorn.  \"I'll swim across with anybody,\" said Hervey Willetts.  He belonged in a troop from western New York and reveled in stunts which bespoke a kind of blithe daring. No one took him up and silence reigned for a few minutes more.  \"There's the little light on the top of the mountain,\" said Will Dawson of Roy's patrol. \"If there's anybody up there, I hope he has an umbrella.\"  But of course there was no one up there. For weeks the tiny light away up on the summit of that mountain"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19590"],["title","Tom Slade's Double Dare (#1)"],["body","had puzzled the scouts of camp. They had not, indeed, been able to determine that it was a light; it seemed rather a tiny patch of brightness which was always brighter when the moon shone. This had led to the belief that it was caused by some kind of natural phenomena.  The scouts fixed their gaze upon it, watching it curiously for a few moments.  \"It isn't a reflection, that's sure,\" said Roy, \"or we wouldn't see it on a night like this.\"  \"It's a phosphate,\" said Pee-wee.  \"It's a chocolate soda,\" said Roy.  \"You're crazy!\" Pee-wee vociferated. \"Phosphate is something that shines in the dark.\"  \"You mean phosphorus,\" said Westy Martin.  That seemed a not unlikely explanation. But the consensus of opinion in camp was that the bright patch was the reflection of some powerful light in the low country on the opposite side of the mountain.  \"It's a mystery,\" said Pee-wee, \"that's what it is.\"  Suddenly, while they gazed, it went out. They watched but it did not come again. And the frowning, jungle-covered, storm beaten summit was enshrouded again in ghostly darkness. And the increasing gale beat the lake, and the driven rain assailed the few stragglers on the veranda with lashing fury. And across the black water, in that ghoul-haunted, trackless wilderness, could be heard the sound of timber being rent in splinters and of great trees crashing down the mountainside.  Suddenly a word from Westy Martin aroused them all like a cannon shot.  \"Look!\" he shouted, \"_Look! Look at the springboard!_\"  Every one of them looked, speechless, astonished, aghast, at the sight which they beheld before their very eyes.     CHAPTER II  THE BRIDGE   There, just below them was the springboard an inch or two above the surface of the lake. Ordinarily it projected from the shore nearly a yard above the water, but lately the swollen lake had risen above it. Now, however, it was visible again just above the surface.  This meant that the water had receded more in an hour than it had risen in a whole week. The strong wind was blowing toward the pavilion and would naturally force the water up along that shore. But in spite of the wind the water in the lake was receding at an alarming rate. Something was wrong. The little trickle from the spring up behind the camp had grown into a torrent and was pouring into the lake. Yet the water in the lake was receding.  Down out of the mountain wilderness across the water came weird noises, caused no doubt by the tumult of the wind in the intricate fastnesses and by the falling of great trees, but the sounds struck upon the ears of the besieged listeners like voices wild and unearthly. The banging of the big shutters of the pavilion was heard in echo as the furious gale bore the sounds back from the mountain and the familiar, homely noise was conjured into a kind of ghostly clamor.  \"There goes Pee-wee's signal tower,\" a scout remarked, and just as he spoke, the little rustic edifice which had been the handiwork and pride of the tenderfoots went crashing to the ground while out of the woods across the water came sounds as of merry laughter at its downfall.  \"Something's wrong over on the other side,\" said Westy Martin of Roy's patrol; \"the lake's breaking through over there.\"  Scarcely had he uttered the words when all the scouts of the little group were at the railing craning their necks and straining their eyes trying to see across the water. But the wind and rain beat in their faces and the driving downpour formed an impenetrable mist.  As they withdrew again into the comparative shelter of the porch they saw a young fellow standing with his bare arm upraised against the door-jam, watching and listening. This was the young camp assistant, Tom Slade. He had evidently come out to fasten the noisy shutters and had paused to contemplate the tempest.  \"Some storm, hey, Tomasso?\" said Roy.  \"I think the water's going out through the cove,\" said Tom. \"It must have washed away the land over there.\"  \"Let it go, we can't stop it,\" said Roy.  \"If it's running out into the valley, it's good-night to Berry's garage, and the bridge too,\" said Tom.  The young assistant was popular with the boys at camp, and struck by this suggestion of imminent catastrophe, they clustered about him, listening eagerly. So loud was the noise of the storm, so deafening the sound of rending timber on that gale-swept height before them, that Tom had to raise his voice to make himself heard. The danger to human life which he had been the first to think of, gave the storm new terror to these young watchers. It needed only this touch of mortal peril in that panorama of dreadfulness to arouse them, good scouts that they were, to the chances of adventure and the possibility of service.  \"We can't do anything, can we?\" one asked. \"It's too late now, isn't it?\"  \"It's either too late or it isn't,\" said Tom Slade; \"and it's for us to see. I was thinking of Berry's place, and I was thinking of the crowd that's coming up tonight on the bus. If the water has broken through across the lake and is pouring into the valley, it'll wash away the bridge. The bus ought to be here now. There are two troops from the four-twenty train at Catskill. Maybe the train is late on account of the weather. If the bridge is down....\"  \"Call up Berry's place and find out,\" said Westy Martin.  \"That's just what has me worrying,\" said Tom; \"Berry's doesn't answer.\"     CHAPTER III  AN IMPORTANT MISSION   Temple Camp was situated on a gentle slope close to the east shore of the lake. Save for this small area of habitable land the lake was entirely surrounded by mountains. And it was the inverted forms of these mountains reflected in the water which gave it the somber hue whence the lake derived its name. On sunless days and in the twilight, the water seemed as black as night.  Directly across the water from the camp, the most forbidding of those surrounding heights reared its deeply wooded summit three thousand feet above the sea level. A wilderness of tangled underbrush, like barbed wire entanglements, baffled the hardiest adventurer. No scout had penetrated those dismal fastnesses which the legend of camp reputed to be haunted.  Beside the rocky base of this mountain was a tiny cove, a dim, romantic little place, where the water was as still as in a pool. Its two sides were the lower reaches of the great mountain and its neighbor, and all that prevented the cove from being an outlet was a little hubble of land which separated this secluded nook from a narrow valley, or gully, beyond.  Sometimes, indeed, after a rainy spell the water in the cove overflowed this little hubble of land enough to trickle through into the gully, and then you could pick fish up with your hands where they flopped about marooned in the channel below. Probably this gully was an old dried-up stream bed.  About a mile from the lake it became wider and was intersected by a road. Here it was that the bridge spanned the hollow. And here it was, right in the hollow near the bridge, that Ebon Berry had his rural garage. Along this road the old bus lumbered daily, bringing new arrivals to camp and touching at villages beyond.  If, indeed, the swollen lake had washed away the inner shore of the cove, the sequel would be serious if not tragic at that quiet road crossing. The question was, had this happened, and if so, had the bus reached the fatal spot? All that the boys knew was that the bus was long overdue and that Berry's \"did not answer.\" And that the fury of the storm was rising with every minute.  Tom Slade spoke calmly as was his wont. No storm could arouse him out of his stolid, thoughtful habit.  \"A couple of scoutmasters have started along the road,\" he said, \"to see what they can find out. How about you, Hervey? Are you game to skirt the lake? How about you, Roy? There may be danger over there.\"  \"Believe me, I hope it'll wait till we get there,\" said Hervey Willetts.  \"I'll go!\" shouted Pee-wee.  \"You'll go--in and get supper,\" said Tom. \"I want just three fellows; I'm not going to overload a boat in this kind of weather. I'll take Roy and Hervey and Westy, if you fellows are game to go. You go in and get a lantern, Pee-wee.\"  \"And don't forget to leave some pie for those two troops that are coming on the bus,\" added Roy.  Pee-wee did better than bring a lantern; he brought also three oilskin jackets and hats which the younger boys donned. He must also have advertised the adventurous expedition during his errand indoors, for a couple of dozen envious scouts followed him out and watched the little party depart.  The four made their way against a blown rain which all but blinded them and streamed from their hats and rendered their storm jackets quite useless. Tom wore khaki trousers and a pongee shirt which clung to him like wet tissue paper. If one cannot be thoroughly dry the next best thing is to be thoroughly wet.  They chose the widest and heaviest of the boats, a stout old tub with two pairs of oarlocks. Each of the four manned an oar and pulled with both hands. It was almost impossible to get started against the wind, and when at last their steady, even pulling overcame the deterring power of the gale they were able to move at but a snail's pace. They followed the shoreline, keeping as close in as they could, preferring the circuitous route to the more perilous row across the lake.  As their roundabout voyage brought them to the opposite shore, their progress became easier, for the mountain rising sheer above them protected them from the wind.  \"Let her drift a minute,\" said Tom, panting; \"lift your oars.\"  It was the first word that any of them had spoken, so intense had been their exertions.  \"She's going straight ahead,\" said Westy.  \"What's that?\" said Roy suddenly. \"Look out!\"  He spoke just in time to enable them to get out of the path of a floating tree which was drifting rapidly in the same direction as the boat. Its great mass of muddy roots brushed against them.  \"It's"]]]
