That much is very simple.  The rear rank has a harder task. Let us have the front and rear rank execute the movement separately:  [Illustration]  The rear rank is to take its place on the dotted line a b.  No. 3 rear rank moves straight to the front until in prolongation of the line to be occupied by the rear rank.  No. 2 follows No. 3.  No. 1 follows No. 2.  When No. 3 arrives on the line to be occupied by the rear rank he changes direction to the right; he moves in the new direction until in rear of No. 3, front rank, when Nos. 3, 2, and 1, rear rank, are in rear of Nos. 3, 2, and 1, front rank, (i.e., when they are in rear of their front rank men), they face to the right in marching and mark time. No. 4 marches on the left of No. 3 to his new position. As he arrives on the line, both ranks execute forward march without command, For the remainder of the squad to know when No. 4 front and rear rank have arrived on the line, they glance to see. The squad should step off on the 9th count.    Third Movement   RIGHT TURN  Being in line: 1. Right (left) turn, 2. MARCH.  [Illustration: THIS IS THE WAY IT IS DONE]  At the command march, No. 1 front rank faces to the right in marching and takes the half step. Nos. 2, 3, and 4 front rank right oblique (turn 45 degrees to the right) until opposite their places in line, then execute a second right oblique and take the half step on arriving abreast of the pivot man. When No. 4 arrives on the line Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 take the full step without further command. (To know when No. 4 arrives on the line it is necessary to glance in his direction.) Full step on the 7th count.  The rear rank executes the movement in the same way and turns on the same ground as the front rank. The rear rank, therefore, moves forward at the command march, or continues to move forward, if already marching, until it arrives at the place where the front turned, when it turns.  Note that the squad turns on No. 1 front rank but that he does not remain in his position even temporarily, as in squad right; he is, therefore, called the moving pivot. No. 4 is called the marching flank.  Had the command been left turn, No. 4 would have been the moving pivot, and No. 1 the marching flank.  Knowing the three above movements, we are prepared for the following:  Being in line at a halt: 1. Take interval, 2. To the right (left), 3. MARCH, 4. Squad, 5. HALT.  [Illustration: BEING IN THIS FORMATION]  At the command to the right (left), the rear rank men march backward four steps (15 inches each step) and halt.  [Illustration: LIKE THIS  Note that the actual distance from the front rank to the rear rank is now 40 plus 4x15 inches, i.e., 100 inches.]  At the command march, all face to the right and No. 1 front and rear rank step off. No. 2, front and rear rank, follow No. 1, front and rear rank, at a distance of four paces. Likewise with the other numbers.  [Illustration: Like this, when No. 1 front and rear rank have gained four paces distance.]  At the command halt, given when No. 3 is three paces distant from No. 4, all halt and face to the front.  [Illustration: The squad looks like this when the movement is completed.]  Being at intervals: 1. Assemble, to the right, (left), 2. MARCH.  At the command march, No. 1 front rank stands fast. No. 1 rear rank closes to 40 inches. The other men face to the right, close by the shortest line, and face to the front.  [Illustration]  Being in line at a halt: 1. Take distance, 2. MARCH, 3. Squad, 4. HALT.  At the command march, No. 1 of the front rank moves straight to the front; Nos. 2, 3, and 4 of the front rank and Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the rear rank, in the order named, move straight to the front, each stepping off so as to follow the preceding man at four paces. The command halt is given when all have their distances.  In case more than one squad is in line, each squad executes the movement as above. The guide of each rank of numbers is right.  [Illustration]  The front rank men should walk straight to the front and their rear rank men should cover them accurately.  Being at distances, to assemble the squad: 1. Assemble, 2. MARCH.  No. 1 of the front rank stands fast; the other numbers move forward to their proper places in line.    THE OBLIQUE MARCH   For the instruction of recruits, the squad being in column or correctly aligned, the instructor causes the squad to face half right (or half left), points out to the men their relative positions, and explains that these are to be maintained in the oblique march.  1. Right (left) oblique, 2. MARCH.  Each man steps off in a direction 45 degrees to the right of his original front. He preserves his relative position, keeping his shoulders parallel to those of the guide (the man on the right front of the line or column), and so regulates his steps that the ranks remain parallel to their original front.  At the command halt, the men halt faced to the front.  To resume the original direction: 1. Forward, 2. MARCH.  [Illustration]  The men half face to the left in marching and then move straight to the front.  If at half step or mark time while obliquing, the oblique march is resumed by the commands: 1. Oblique, 2. MARCH.   TO FOLLOW THE CORPORAL  Being assembled or deployed, to march the squad without unnecessary commands, the corporal places himself in front of it and commands: FOLLOW ME.  If in line or skirmish line, No. 2 of the front rank follows in the track of the corporal at about 3 paces; the other men conform to the movements of No. 2, guiding on him and maintaining their relative positions.  If in column, the head of the column follows the corporal.  [Illustration]  Note that No. 4 rear rank takes the place of the corporal when the corporal is in front of the squad. This a general rule. When any front rank man is absent his rear rank man steps up in the front rank. When the squad is following the corporal No. 4 rear rank remains blank (i.e., No. 3 does not step to the left and cover No. 4).    TO DEPLOY AS SKIRMISHERS   Being in any formation, assembled: 1. As skirmishers, 2. MARCH.  The corporal places himself in front of the squad, if not already there. Moving at a run, the men place themselves abreast of the corporal at half-pace intervals. Nos. 1 and 2 on his right, Nos. 3 and 4 on his left, rear-rank men on the right of their file leaders, extra men on the left of No. 4; all then conform to the corporal's gait.  There is a rule of thumb that must be remembered. The rear-rank man is always on the right of his file leader.  A common error is for beginners to execute the movement at a slow trot which a run is required.  When the squad is acting alone, skirmish line is similarly formed on No. 2 of the front rank, who stands fast or continues the march, as the case may be; the corporal places himself in front of the squad when advancing and in rear when halted.  When deployed as skirmishers, the men march at ease, pieces at the trail unless otherwise ordered.  The corporal is the guide when in the line; otherwise No. 2 front rank is the guide. The guide is center.  The normal interval between skirmishers is one-half pace, resulting practically in one man per yard of front. The front of a squad thus deployed as skirmishers is about 10 paces.  [Illustration: SQUAD DEPLOYED ON CORPORAL  THIS IS THE WAY IT IS DONE]  The common error is to keep an interval of a very few inches when 15 inches are required.    TO INCREASE OR DIMINISH INTERVALS   If assembled, and it is desired to deploy at greater than the normal interval; or if deployed, and it is desired to increase or decrease the interval: 1. As skirmishers, (so many) paces, 2. MARCH.  Intervals are taken at the indicated number of paces. If already deployed, the men move by the flank or away from the guide.  The above command is used but very little.    THE ASSEMBLY   Being deployed: 1. Assemble, 2. MARCH.  The men move toward the corporal and form in their proper places.  If the corporal continues to advance, the men move in double time, form, and follow him.  The assembly while marching to the rear is not executed.       Note. It will be better for the beginner to let the remainder of      this chapter go for awhile. Your instructor will explain all of the      following points in a way that will be easier for you than for you      to try to work them out alone. They will come up in the first      month's work and will be explained and shown as you go along. As      you become more proficient we advise you, then, to take up the      remainder of the chapter.  If standing: KNEEL.  Half face to the right; carry the right toe about 1 foot to the left rear of the left heel; kneel on the right knee, sitting as nearly as possible on the right heel; left forearm across left thigh; piece remains in position of order arms, right hand grasping it above the lower hand.  If standing or kneeling: LIE DOWN.  Kneel, but with right knee against left heel; carry back the left foot and lie flat on the belly, inclining body about 35 degrees to the right; piece horizontal, barrel up, muzzle off the ground and pointed to the front; elbows on the ground; left hand at the balance, right hand grasping the small of the stock opposite the neck. This is the position of order arms, lying down.  If kneeling or lying down: RISE.  If kneeling, stand up, faced to the front, on the ground marked by the left heel.  If lying down, raise body on both knees; stand up, faced to the front, on the ground marked by the knees.  If lying down: KNEEL.  Raise the body on both knees; take the position of kneel.  In double rank, the positions of kneeling and lying down are ordinarily used only for the better utilization of cover.  When deployed as skirmishers, a sitting position may be taken in lieu of the kneeling position."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19552"],["title","The Plattsburg Manual: A Handbook for Military Training (#7)"],["body","AND FIRINGS   The commands for loading and firing are the same whether standing, kneeling, or lying down. The firings are always executed at a halt.  When kneeling or lying down in double rank, the rear rank does not load, aim, or fire.  The instruction in firing will be preceded by a command for loading.  Loadings are executed in line and skirmish line only.  Pieces, having been ordered loaded, are kept loaded without command until the command unload, or inspection arms, fresh clips being inserted when the magazine is exhausted.  The aiming point or target is carefully pointed out. This may be done before or after announcing the sight setting. Both are indicated before giving the command for firing, but may be omitted when the target appears suddenly and is unmistakable; in such case battle sight is used if no sight setting is announced.  The target or aiming point having been designated and the sight setting announced, such designation or announcement need not be repeated until a change of either or both is necessary.  Troops are trained to continue their fire upon the aiming point or target designated, and at the sight setting announced, until a change is ordered.  If the men are not already in the position of load, that position is taken at the announcement of the sight setting; if the announcement is omitted, the position is taken at the first command for firing.  When deployed, the use of the sling as an aid to accurate firing is discretionary with each man.    TO LOAD   Being in line or skirmish line at halt: 1. With dummy (blank or ball) cartridges, 2. LOAD.  At the command load each front-rank man or skirmisher faces half right and carries the right foot to the right, about 1 foot, to such position as will insure the greatest firmness and steadiness of the body; raises, or lowers, the piece and drops it into the left hand at the balance, left thumb extended along the stock, muzzle at the height of the breast, and turns the cut-off up. With the right hand, he turns and draws the bolt back, takes a loaded clip and inserts the end in the clip slots, places the thumb on the powder space of the top cartridge, the fingers extending around the piece and tips resting on the magazine floor plate; forces the cartridges into the magazine by pressing down with the thumb; without removing the clip, thrusts the bolt home, turning down the handle; turns the safety lock to the \"safe\" and carries the hand to the small of the stock. Each rear rank man moves to the right front, takes a similar position opposite the interval to the right of his front rank man, muzzle of the piece extending beyond the front rank, and loads.  A skirmish line may load while moving, the pieces being held as neatly as practicable in the position of load.  If kneeling or sitting, the position of the piece is similar; if kneeling, the left forearm rests on the left thigh; if sitting the elbows are supported by the knees; if lying down, the left hand steadies and supports the piece at the balance, the toe of the butt resting on the ground, the muzzle off the ground.    STACK AND TAKE ARMS   The subject of stack and take arms is less important than the rest of this chapter. It is difficult to be learned from a book. Your company commander will explain it to you. It is given here to serve as a reference.  Being in line at a halt: STACK ARMS.  Each even number of the front rank grasps his piece with the left hand at the upper band and rests the butt between his feet, barrel to the front, muzzle inclined slightly to the front and opposite the center of the interval on his right, the thumb and forefinger raising the stacking swivel; each even number of the rear rank then passes his piece, barrel to the rear, to his file leader, who grasps it between the bands with his right hand and throws the butt about two feet in advance of that of his own piece and opposite the right of the interval, the right hand slipping to the upper band, the thumb and forefinger raising the stacking swivel, which he engages with that of his own piece; each odd number of the front rank raises his piece with the right hand, carries it well forward, barrel to the front; the left hand, guiding the stacking swivel, engages the lower hook of the swivel of his own piece with the free hook of that of the even number of the rear rank; he then turns the barrel outward into the angle formed by the other two pieces and lowers the butt to the ground, to the right of and against the toe of his right shoe.  The stacks made, the loose pieces are laid on them by the even numbers of the front rank.  When each man has finished handling pieces, he takes the position of the soldier.  Being in line behind the stacks: TAKE ARMS.  The loose pieces are returned by the even numbers of the front rank; each even number of the front rank grasps his own piece with the left hand, the piece of his rear-rank man with his right hand, grasping both between the bands; each odd number of the front rank grasps his piece in the same way with the right hand, disengages it by raising the butt from the ground and then, turning the piece to the right, detaches it from the stack; each even number of the front rank disengages and detaches his piece by turning it to the left, and then passes the piece of his rear-rank man to him, and all resume the order.  Should any squad have Nos. 2 and 3 blank files, No. 1 rear rank takes the place of No. 2 rear rank in making and breaking the stack; the stacks made or broken, he resumes his post.  Pieces not used in making the stack are termed loose pieces.  Pieces are never stacked with the bayonet fixed.     CHAPTER V  SCHOOL OF THE COMPANY  Based on the Infantry Drill Regulations   The company in line is formed in double rank with the men arranged, as far as practicable, according to height from right to left, the tallest on the right.  The original division into squads is effected by the command: Count off. The squads, successively from the right, count off as in the School of the Squad, corporals placing themselves as No. 4 of the front rank.  At the formation of the company the platoons or squads are numbered consecutively from right to left, and these designations do not change.  For convenience in giving commands and for reference, the designations, right, center, left, when in line, and leading, center, rear, when in column, are applied to platoons or squads. These designations, right, center, left, when in line, and leading, center, rear, when in column, are applied to the actual right, left, center, head, or rear, in whatever direction the company may be facing. The center squad is the middle or right middle squad of the company. If there are an even number of squads in the company, for instance eight, the center squad would be the fourth.  The designation \"So-and-so's\" squad or platoon may also be used.  [Illustration: This is exactly the same as the photograph. It shows the correct position of every man in the company. man for man.]  During battle, these assignments are not changed; vacancies are filled by non-commissioned officers of the platoon, or by the nearest available officers or non-commissioned officers arriving with reinforcing troops.    CLOSE ORDER   In column of squads, each rank preserves the alignment toward the side of the guide.  Men in the line of file closers do not execute loadings and firings.    TO FORM THE COMPANY   At the sounding of the assembly the first sergeant takes position 6 paces in front of where the center of the company is to be, faces it, draws saber, and commands: Fall in.  The right guide of the company places himself, facing to the front, where the right of the company is to rest, and at such point that the center of the company will be 6 paces from and opposite the first sergeant; the squads form in their proper places on the left of the right guide, superintended by the other sergeants, who then take their posts.  The first sergeant commands: Report. Remaining in position at the order, the squad leaders, in succession from the right, salute and report: All present; or Private(s)---- absent. The first sergeant does not return the salutes of the squad leaders; he then commands: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Order, 4. ARMS, faces about, salutes the captain, reports: Sir, all present or accounted for, or the names of the unauthorized absentees, and without command, takes his post.  If the company cannot be formed by squads, the first sergeant commands: 1. Inspection, 2. ARMS, 3. Right shoulder, 4. ARMS, and calls the roll. Each man, as his name is called, answers here and executes order arms. The sergeant then effects the division into squads and reports the company as prescribed above.  The captain places himself 12 paces in front of the center of, and facing, the company in time to receive the report of the first sergeant, whose salute he returns, and then draws saber.  The lieutenants take their posts when the first sergeant has reported, and draw saber with the captain.  Generally in camp the saber is not worn. The officers and first sergeants carry pistols. The hand salute is rendered when so armed.  In the School of the Squad we gave three movements that formed the basis of the squad drill. There are six movements in the School of the Company that should be thoroughly understood. When the beginner knows these he will have no difficulty with the remainder of the close order.    1ST MOVEMENT ON THE FIXED PIVOT   Being in line, to turn the company: 1. Company right (left), 2. MARCH, 3. Company, 4. HALT; or, 3. Forward, 4. MARCH.  [Illustration: SHOWING MOVEMENT HALF COMPLETED]  Notice that the part of the company which has not completed the movement is perpendicular to the part that has. The common error is for the rear rank to oblique before marching four paces to the front.  At the second command the right-flank man in the front rank faces to the right in marching and marks time; the other front-rank men, oblique to the right,"]]]
