All the window-blinds of his house were closed, as they had been for the last two weeks, since this well-known favorite of Minister von Haugwitz had repaired to the headquarters of the army at Weimar. But Professor Lange had stated, perhaps for the sole purpose of diverting the general attention from himself, and of directing it toward the unpopular cabinet counsellor, that Lombard had returned, and the people believed him.  \"Lombard! Lombard!\" shouted hundreds of voices. Eyes which had hitherto looked only sad and anxious became threatening; many a fist was lifted up to the closed windows, and many an imprecation uttered.  \"If a disaster has taken place, it is Lombard's fault,\" cried one of the crowd.  \"If it is his fault, he shall and must atone for it,\" exclaimed another.  \"He has no heart for Prussia's honor,\" said a third. \"He is a German-Frenchman, and would not object if the whole of Prussia should become a French province. If he knew how to do it, he certainly would not shrink from it, even should he bring captivity and distress upon the king and the queen!\"  \"He has already done much mischief,\" shouted another. \"The Russian army which was to support ours ought to have been here long ago, but he detained the dispatches in which the king informed the czar that our army had advanced against the French. It is his fault that the Russians have not yet arrived.\"  \"It is his fault that the Russians have not yet arrived!\" roared the wild chorus, and the furious men began to rush toward the house. Many armed themselves with stones, hurled them at the walls and broke the windows; others commenced striking with vigorous fists at the closed door.  \"Open the door! open the door! We want to see Lombard! He shall account for what he has done!\" exclaimed the enraged men. \"Woe to him if it be true that we have lost a battle! Woe to him if--\"  \"Silence! silence!\" suddenly thundered a loud, imperious voice. \"See, there is a courier!\"  \"A courier! A courier!\" and all rushed back from the house into the street; every eye turned toward the horseman, who approached at full gallop.  As if obeying a military command, the multitude made way for him, but at every step they closed behind him, and, pressing him on all sides, his progress was exceedingly slow.  But the courier, with his gloomy mien and pale cheeks, looked like a bearer of bad news, and when the people had scanned his features, they murmured, \"He brings bad news! A disaster is written on his forehead!\"  \"Let me pass,\" he said in an imploring voice; \"in the name of the king, let me pass!\" And as he spurred his horse, the bystanders fell back in alarm.  \"'In the name of the king!' the king, then, is still alive?\"  \"Yes, the king is alive!\" replied the courier, sadly. \"I have dispatches from him for the Governor of Berlin and Cabinet Counsellor Lombard.\"  \"And what do these dispatches contain?\" asked a thousand voices.  \"I do not know, and even though I did, I am not at liberty to tell you. The governor will communicate the news to the inhabitants of Berlin.\"  \"Tell us the news!\" demanded the people.  \"I cannot do so; and, moreover, I do not know any thing about it,\" replied the courier, who had now reached Lombard's house, and whose horse was again so closely surrounded that it was scarcely able to move its feet.  \"Do not detain me, my friends, I beseech you--let me dismount here,\" said the courier. \"I must deliver my dispatches to Cabinet Counsellor Lombard.\"  \"Oh, let him deliver his dispatches. We can afterward compel M. Lombard to communicate their contents.\"  \"Yes; let him deliver his dispatches,\" said all; \"Lombard shall presently tell us what they contain.\"  The crowd stood back on both sides of the door, and busy hands were ready to assist the rider in dismounting. But before he had been able to do so, a voice from the rear was heard: \"Ask him where the queen is at present!\"  \"Yes, yes, where is the queen? where is the queen?\"  \"The queen?\" said he. \"I passed her fifteen minutes ago near the city and delivered dispatches to her, too. The queen? Look there!\" And he pointed to the Brandenburg gate.  A carriage, drawn by six horses, was seen rapidly approaching.  \"The queen! It is the queen!\" joyfully shouted every one, and the thousands who had been a moment before so anxious to learn the news, and to call Lombard to account, rushed toward the carriage. Meantime the courier, whose presence seemed to be entirely forgotten, dismounted, and rapped softly at the door. It was at once opened in a cautious manner, and a voice whispered: \"Take your horse into the house. You can afterward ride through the garden, and out of the back gate to the governor's residence.\"  The door was hastily thrown open, and closed as soon as the courier had entered with his horse. No notice was taken of this movement, for every one thought only of the queen, and looked anxiously through the closed coach windows.  \"The queen! It is the queen!\" exclaimed the people, greeting the beloved lady in the most rapturous manner. All arms were raised in sign of respect, and every voice uttered a welcome of \"Long live the queen!\"  The carriage window was lowered, and Louisa's beautiful face appeared; but she looked pale and afflicted; her eyes, generally so radiant, seemed dimmed and tearful; yet she tried to smile, and bowed repeatedly to her enthusiastic friends, who rushed impetuously toward her, and, in their exultation, forgetful of the rules of etiquette, seized the reins and stopped the horses.  \"We want to see our queen! Long live our Queen Louisa!\" cried thousands of voices. Those who stood nearest the carriage, and beheld her countenance, fell on their knees in the fervor of their love, and eyes that never before had wept were filled with tears; for she seemed as an angel of sorrow and suffering. She rose, and, leaning out of the coach door, returned the affectionate greetings of her faithful subjects, and, weeping, stretched out her arms as if to bless them.  \"Long live the queen! Long live Louisa!\" they cried, and those who held the horses, in order to stop the carriage, dropped the reins, rushed toward the coach door, threw up their hats, and joined in the welcome cry. The coachman, profiting by this movement, drove onward. The people, whose desire had been satisfied in having seen their queen, no longer resisted, and permitted the carriage to roll away.  Louisa closed her coach window, and, sinking back upon the cushions, exclaimed in a heart-rending tone, \"Alas! it is perhaps the last time that they thus salute me! Soon, perhaps, I shall be no longer Queen of Prussia!\" She buried her face in her hands, and sobbed aloud.  \"Do not weep,\" whispered Madame von Berg, the queen's intimate friend, who was sitting by her side, \"do not weep. It may be a dispensation of Providence that the crown shall fall from your head for a moment, but He will replace it more firmly, and one day you will again be happy.\"  \"Oh, it is not for the sake of my own majesty, and for my little worldly splendor, that I am lamenting at this moment,\" said the queen, removing her hands from her face. \"I should gladly plunge into obscurity and death if my husband and my children were exempted from humiliation, and if these good people, who love me, and are attached to their king, should not be compelled to recognize a foreigner as their master, and bow to him!\"  \"Even though the people should be subjugated at present,\" said Madame von Berg, solemnly, \"they will rise one day and avenge their disgrace!\"  \"Would you were a true prophetess!\" exclaimed Louisa. \"I hope the people will remain faithful to us in adversity, and never forget their love for their king! Yes, I will hope for that day, and pray that it may come speedily. I will weep no more; but remember that I am a mother, and shall see my children again--not to leave them, but to hasten with them to my husband, who is waiting for me at KÃ¼strin. In half an hour we must continue our journey.\"  Just then the carriage drove past the main guard-house. The soldiers presented arms, and the drums beat.  A melancholy smile overspread the queen's features. \"Do you remember what Prince Louis Ferdinand said to his mother, on the eve of his departure to the army?\" she asked in a low voice.  \"No, your majesty, I do not remember, and it is possible that I never heard of it.\"  \"The princess believed a defeat of our army to be utterly impossible,\" said the queen. \"She thought Prussia was so strong a bulwark that the proud assault of the French empire would be in vain. 'You are mistaken,' exclaimed Prince Louis Ferdinand; 'you think nothing will change, and the drums will always be beaten when you ride out at the gate? On the contrary, I tell you, mamma, one day you will ride out of the gate, and no drums will be beaten!' The same will happen to us, my dear--we will often ride out of the gate, and no drums will be beaten. But here is our house, and I must hide my tears. I will show a smiling face to my children.\"  The queen's carriage stopped for the first time at the doorsteps of the palace without meeting there the ladies and gentlemen of the court, the high dignitaries and functionaries who had formerly never failed to wait on her. She had come without being expected, but on this day of anxiety and terror the announcement of her arrival would have made no difference; for every one thought only of himself, and was occupied with his own safety. Only a few faithful servants, therefore, received her, and bade her welcome with tearful eyes.  \"Where are my children?\" exclaimed the queen, anxiously. \"Why are they not here to receive their mother?\"  \"Your majesty,\" said the palace-steward, in a low voice, \"a courier, sent hither by the king, arrived last night, unfortunately having failed to meet with your majesty on the road. The royal princes and princesses set out two hours ago to Stettin, and thence to Grandenz. Such were his majesty's orders.\"  The queen suppressed the cry of pain "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19564"],["title","The Pirates' Who's Who (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's note.

I do not deal here with the children of fancy; I believe that every man, or woman too--since certain of the gentler sex cut no small figure at the game--mentioned in this volume actually existed.  A time has come when every form of learning, however preposterous it may seem, is made as unlaborious as possible for the would-be student. Knowledge, which is after all but a string of facts, is being arranged, sorted, distilled, and set down in compact form, ready for rapid assimilation. There is little fear that the student who may wish in the future to become master of any subject will have to delve into the original sources in his search after facts and dates.  Surely pirates, taking them in their broadest sense, are as much entitled to a biographical dictionary of their own as are clergymen, race-horses, or artists in ferro-concrete, who all, I am assured, have their own \"Who's Who\"? Have not the medical men their Directory, the lawyers their List, the peers their Peerage? There are books which record the names and the particulars of musicians, schoolmasters, stockbrokers, saints and bookmakers, and I dare say there is an average adjuster's almanac. A peer, a horse, dog, cat, and even a white mouse, if of blood sufficiently blue, has his pedigree recorded somewhere. Above all, there is that astounding and entertaining volume, \"Who's Who,\" found in every club smoking-room, and which grows more bulky year by year, stuffed with information about the careers, the hobbies, and the marriages of all the most distinguished persons in every profession, including very full details about the lives and doings of all our journalists. But on the club table where these books of ready reference stand with \"Whitaker,\" \"ABC,\" and \"Ruff's Guide to the Turf,\" there is just one gap that the compiler of this work has for a long while felt sorely needed filling. There has been until now no work that gives immediate and trustworthy information about the lives, and--so sadly important in their cases--the deaths of our pirates and buccaneers.  In delving in the volumes of the \"Dictionary of National Biography,\" it has been a sad disappointment to the writer to find so little space devoted to the careers of these picturesque if, I must admit, often unseemly persons. There are, of course, to be found a few pirates with household names such as Kidd, Teach, and Avery. A few, too, of the buccaneers, headed by the great Sir Henry Morgan, come in for their share. But I compare with indignation the meagre show of pirates in that monumental work with the rich profusion of divines! Even during the years when piracy was at its height--say from 1680 until 1730--the pirates are utterly swamped by the theologians. Can it be that these two professions flourished most vigorously side by side, and that when one began to languish, the other also began to fade?  Even so there can be no excuse for the past and present neglect of these sea-adventurers. But a change is beginning to show itself. Increasing evidence is to be found that the more intelligent portions of the population of this country, and even more so the enlightened of the great United States of America, are beginning to show a proper interest in the lives of the pirates and buccaneers. That this should be so amongst the Americans is quite natural, when it is remembered what a close intimacy existed between their Puritan forefathers of New England and the pirates, both by blood relation and by trade, since the pirates had no more obliging and ready customers for their spoils of gold dust, stolen slaves, or church ornaments, than the early settlers of New York, Massachusetts, and Carolina.  In beginning to compile such a list as is to be found in this volume, a difficulty is met at once. My original intention was that only pirates and buccaneers should be included. To admit privateers, corsairs, and other sea-rovers would have meant the addition of a vast number of names, and would have made the work unwieldy, and the very object of this volume as a book of ready reference would not have been achieved. But the difficulty has been to define the exact meaning of a pirate and of a buccaneer. In the dictionary a pirate is defined as \"a sea-robber, marauder, one who infringes another's copyright\"; while a buccaneer is described as \"a sea-robber, a pirate, especially of the Spanish-American coasts.\" This seems explicit, but a pirate was not a pirate from the cradle to the gallows. He usually began his life at sea as an honest mariner in the merchant service. He perhaps mutinied with other of the ship's crew, killed or otherwise disposed of the captain, seized the ship, elected a new commander, and sailed off \"on the account.\" Many an honest seaman was captured with the rest of his ship's crew by a pirate, and either voluntarily joined the freebooters by signing their articles, or, being a good navigator or \"sea-artist,\" was compelled by the pirates to lend them his services. Others, again, were in privateer ships, which carried on a legitimate warfare against the shipping of hostile countries, under a commission or letter of marque.  Often the very commission or letter of marque carried about so jealously by some shady privateer was not worth the paper it was written on, nor the handful of dubloons paid for it. One buccaneer sailed about the South Seas, plundering Spanish ships and sacking churches and burning towns, under a commission issued to him, for a consideration, by the Governor of a Danish West India island, himself an ex-pirate. This precious document, adorned with florid scrolls and a big, impressive seal, was written in Danish. Someone with a knowledge of that language had an opportunity and the curiosity to translate it, when he found that all it entitled the bearer to do was to hunt for goats and pigs on the Island of Hispaniola, and nothing more.  When, at the conclusion of hostilities, peace was declared, the crew of a privateer found it exceedingly irksome to give up the roving life, and were liable to drift into piracy. Often it happened that, after a long naval war, crews were disbanded, ships laid up, and navies reduced, thus flooding the countryside with idle mariners, and filling the roads with begging and starving seamen. These were driven to go to sea if they could find a berth, often half starved and brutally treated, and always underpaid, and so easily yielded to the temptation of joining some vessel bound vaguely for the \"South Sea,\" where no questions were asked and no wages paid, but every hand on board had a share in the adventure.  The buccaneers were a great source of piracy also. When a war was on hand the English Government was only too glad to have the help of these daring and skilful seamen; but when peace was declared these allies began to lead to international complications, and means had to be taken to abolish them, and to try and turn them into honest settlers in the islands. But when a man has for years lived the free life, sailed out from Jamaica a pauper, to return in six weeks or less with, perhaps, a bag of gold worth two, three, or four thousand pounds, which he has prided himself on spending in the taverns and gambling-hells of Port Royal in a week, how can he settle down to humdrum uneventful toil, with its small profits? Thus he goes back \"on the account\" and sails to some prearranged rendezvous of the \"brethren of the coast.\"  To write a whole history of piracy would be a great undertaking, but a very interesting one. Piracy must have begun in the far, dim ages, and perhaps when some naked savage, paddling himself across a tropical river, met with another adventurer on a better tree-trunk, or carrying a bigger bunch of bananas, the first act of piracy was committed. Indeed, piracy must surely be the third oldest profession in the world, if we give the honour of the second place to the ancient craft of healing. If such a history were to include the whole of piracy, it would have to refer to the Phoenicians, to the Mediterranean sea-rovers of the days of Rome, who, had they but known it, held the future destiny of the world in their grasp when they, a handful of pirates, took prisoner the young Julius CÃ¦sar, to ransom him and afterwards to be caught and crucified by him.
