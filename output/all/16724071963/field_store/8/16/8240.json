As it is indispensable that the student of Shakespeare and Music should have a clear idea of the social status and influence of music in Shakespearian times, here follows a short sketch of the history of this subject, which the reader is requested to peruse with the deliberate object of finding every detail confirmed in Shakespeare's works.   MUSIC IN SOCIAL LIFE.  (_Temp., 16th and 17th centuries._)  Morley, \"Plain and Easy Introduction to Practical Music,\" 1597, pp. 1 and 2. Here we read of a dinner-party, or \"banket,\" at which the conversation was entirely about music. Also--after supper--_according to custom_--\"parts\" were handed round by the hostess. Philomathes has to make many excuses as to his vocal inability, and finally is obliged to confess that he cannot sing at all. At this the rest of the company \"wonder\"--and some whisper to their neighbours, \"How was he brought up?\" Phil. is ashamed--and goes to seek Gnorimus the music-master. The master is surprised to see him--as Phil. has heretofore distinguished himself by inveighing against music as a \"corrupter of good manners, and an allurement to vices.\" Phil.'s experience of the supper-party has so far changed his views that he wishes as soon as may be to change his character of Stoic for that of Pythagorean. Thereupon the master begins to teach him from the very beginning, \"as though he were a child.\"  Then follows a long lesson--which is brought to an end by Philomathes giving farewell to the master as thus--\"Sir, I thanke you, and meane so diligently to practise till our next meeting, that then I thinke I shall be able to render you a full account of all which you have told me, till the which time I wish you such contentment of mind and ease of body as you desire to yourselfe (Master's health had been very bad for long enough) or mothers use to wish to their children.\" The Master replies--\"I thanke you: and assure your selfe it will not be the smallest part of my contentment to see my schollers go towardly forward in their studies, which I doubt not but you will doe, if you take but reasonable pains in practise.\"  Later on in the Third Part (p. 136) Phil.'s brother Polymathes comes with him to Gnorimus for a lesson in Descant--_i.e._, the art of extemporaneously adding a part to the written plainsong.[1] This brother had had lessons formerly from a master who carried a plainsong book in his pocket, and caused him to do the like; \"and so walking in the fields, hee would sing the plaine song, and cause me to sing the descant, etc.\" Polymathes tells us also that his master had a friend, a descanter himself, who used often to drop in--but \"never came in my maister's companie ... but they fell to contention.... What? (saith the one), you keepe not time in your proportions: you sing them false (saith the other), what proportion is this? (saith hee), sesqui-_paltery_ (saith the other): nay (would the other say), you sing you know not what, it shoulde seeme you came latelie from a Barber's shop, where you had _Gregory Walker_ (derisive name for 'quadrant pavan,' 'which was most common 'mongst the Barbars and Fidlers') or a _curranta_ plaide in the new proportions by them lately found out, called sesqui-_blinda_, and sesqui-_harken-after_.\"  [Footnote 1: See Appendix.]  [These mocking terms, sesqui-_paltery_, sesqui-_blinda_, and sesqui-_harken-after_, are perversions of names of \"proportions\" used in the 16th century--as, sesqui-_altera_ (3 equal notes against 2).]  We find, on p. 208, that both Philomathes and Polymathes are young University gentlemen--looking forward hereafter to be \"admitted to the handling of the weightie affaires of the common wealth.\"  The lessons end with their request to the master to give them \"some songes which may serve both to direct us in our compositions, and by singing them recreate us after our more serious studies.\"  Thus we find that in Elizabeth's reign it was the \"custom\" for a lady's guests to sing unaccompanied music from \"parts,\" after supper; and that inability to take \"a part\" was liable to remark from the rest of the company, and indeed that such inability cast doubt on the person having any title to education at all.  We find that one music master was accustomed to have his gentleman pupils so constantly \"in his company\" that they would practise their singing while \"walking in the fields.\"  Finally--that part-singing from written notes, and also the extempore singing of a second part (descant) to a written plainsong, was a diversion of such young University gentlemen, and was looked on as a proper form of recreation after hard reading.  In the 16th century music was considered an _essential_ part of a clergyman's education. A letter from Sir John Harrington to Prince Henry (brother of Charles I.) about Dr John Still, Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1592, says that no one \"could be admitted to _primam tonsuram_, except he could first _bene le bene con bene can_, as they called it, which is to read well, to conster [construe] well, and to _sing well_, in which last he hath good judgment.\" [The three _bene's_ are of course _le-gere, con-struere, can-tare_.]  Also, according to Hawkins (History of Music, p. 367), the statutes of Trinity College, Cambridge, founded by Henry VIII., make part of the Examination of Candidates for Fellowships to be in \"Quid in Cantando possint\"; indeed, _all members were supposed capable of singing a part in choir service_.[2]  [Footnote 2: This statement of Hawkins' seems a little exaggerated. Mr Aldis Wright tells me that the statutes provided for an examination in singing for Candidates for Fellowships, and that ability gave a candidate an advantage, in case of equality. Singing was not required of all candidates, but the subject was considered on the fourth day of the examination, along with the essay and verse composition.]  (Long before this, in 1463, Thomas Saintwix, _doctor in music_, was elected Master of King's College, Cambridge.)  Accordingly, we find Henry VIII., who, as a younger brother, was intended for the Church, and eventually for the See of Canterbury, was a good practical musician. Erasmus says he composed offices for the church. An anthem, \"O Lord, the maker of all things,\" is ascribed to him; and Hawkins gives a motet in three parts by the king, \"Quam pulchra es.\"  Chappell's Old English Popular Music gives a passage from a letter of Pasqualigo the Ambassador-extraordinary, dated about 1515, which says that Henry VIII. \"plays well on the lute and virginals, sings from book at sight,\" etc. Also in Vol. I. are given two part-songs by the king, 'Pastyme with good companye' and 'Wherto shuld I expresse.'  A somewhat unclerical amusement of Henry VIII.'s is related by Sir John Harrington (temp. James I.). An old monkish rhyme, \"The Blacke Saunctus, or Monkes Hymn to Saunte Satane,\" was set to music in a canon of three parts by Harrington's father (who had married a natural daughter of Henry VIII.); and King Henry was used \"in pleasaunt moode to sing it.\" For the music and words, see Hawkins, pp. 921 and 922.  Anne Boleyn was an enthusiastic musician, and, according to Hawkins, \"doted on the compositions of Jusquin and Mouton, and had collections of them made for the private practice of herself and her maiden companions.\"  It appears from the Diary of King Edward VI. that he was a musician, as he mentions playing on the lute before the French Ambassador as one of the several accomplishments which he displayed before that gentleman, July 19th, 1551.  There is also a letter from Queen Catherine (of Arragon), the mother of Queen Mary, in which she exhorts her \"to use her virginals and lute, if she has any.\"  As for Elizabeth, there is abundant evidence that she was a good virginal player.  The best known MS. collection of virginal music (that in the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge) has at least always been known as Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book, and the following quaint story is quoted by Hawkins from Melvil's Memoirs (Lond. 1752).  \"The same day, after dinner, my Lord of Hunsdean drew me up to a quiet gallery that I might hear some music (but he said he durst not avow it), where I might hear the queen play upon the virginals. After I had hearkened a while I took by [aside] the tapestry that hung before the door of the chamber, and stood a pretty space, hearing her play excellently well; but she left off immediately so soon as she turned her about and saw me. She appeared to be surprised to see me, and came forward, seeming to strike me with her hand, alledging she was not used to play before men, but when she was solitary to shun melancholy.\" [Queen Elizabeth's Virginal is in South Kensington Museum.]  To go on with the Royal musicians (who are interesting as such, because their habit _must have set the fashion of the day_), in James I.'s reign we find that Prince Charles learnt the Viol da Gamba from Coperario (_i.e._, John Cooper). Also Playford (temp. Charles II.) says of Charles I. that the king \"often appointed the service and anthems himself\" in the Royal Chapel; \"and would play his part exactly well on the bass-violl,\"--_i.e._, the viol da gamba.  George Herbert, who was by birth a courtier, found in music \"his chiefest recreation,\" \"and did himself compose many divine hymns and anthems, which he set and sung to his lute or viol.... His love to music was such, that he went usually twice every week ... to the cathedral church in Salisbury; and at his return would say that his time spent in prayer and cathedral music elevated his soul, and was his heaven upon earth.\" But not only was the poet-priest a lover of church music, for (Walton's Life goes on) \"before his return thence to Bemerton, he would usually _sing and play his part at an appointed private music meeting_.\" This was fourteen years after Shakespeare's death.  Anthony Wood, who was at Oxford"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19676"],["title","Shakespeare and Music (#2)"],["body","in 1651, gives a most interesting account of the practice of chamber music for viols (and even violins, which, by Charles II.'s time, had superseded the feebler viols) in Oxford. In his Life, he mentions that \"the gentlemen in privat meetings, which A.W. frequented, play'd three, four, and five Parts with Viols, as, Treble-Viol, Tenor, Counter-Tenor, and Bass, with an Organ, Virginal, or Harpsicon joyn'd with them: and they esteemed a Violin to be an Instrument only belonging to a common Fidler, and could not endure that it should come among them, for feare of making their Meetings to be vaine and fidling.\" Wood went to a _weekly meeting_ of musicians in Oxford. Amongst those whom he names as \"performing their parts\" are four Fellows of New College, a Fellow of All Souls, who was \"an admirable Lutenist,\" \"Ralph Sheldon, Gent., a Rom. Catholick ... living in Halywell neare Oxon., admired for his smooth and admirable way in playing on the Viol,\" and a Master of Arts of Magdalen, who had a weekly meeting at his own college. Besides the amateurs, there were eight or nine professional musicians who frequented these meetings. This was in 1656, and in 1658 Wood gives the names of over sixteen other persons, with whom he used to play and sing, all of whom were Fellows of Colleges, Masters of Arts, or at least members of the University. Amongst them was \"Thom. Ken of New Coll., a Junior\" (afterwards Bishop Ken, one of the seven bishops who were deprived at the Revolution), who could \"sing his part.\" All the rest played either viol, violin, organ, virginals, or harpsichord, or were \"songsters.\"  \"These did frequent the Weekly Meetings, and _by the help of public Masters of Musick_, who were mixed with them, they were much improved.\"  There seems to have been little that was not pure enjoyment in these meetings. Only two persons out of the thirty-two mentioned seem to have had any undesirable quality--viz., Mr Low, organist of Christ Church, who was \"a _proud_ man,\" and \"could not endure any common Musitian to come to the meeting;\" and \"Nathan. Crew, M.A., Fellow of Linc. Coll., a Violinist and Violist, _but alwaies played out of Tune_.\" This last gentleman was afterwards Bishop of Durham.  Thus we find that in the 16th and 17th centuries a practical acquaintance with music was a regular part of the education of both sovereign, gentlemen of rank, and the higher middle class.  We find Henry VIII. composing church music, and at the same time enjoying himself singing in the three-part canon composed by his friend, a gentleman of rank.  We find that a Fellow of Trinity at the same time was expected to sing \"his part\" in chapel as a matter of course. We find Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth to have all been capable players on lute or virginals. We find that it was the merest qualification that an Elizabethan bishop should be able to sing well; and that young University gentlemen of birth thought it nothing out of the way to learn all the mysteries of both prick-song (a _written_ part) and descant (an _extempore_ counterpoint), and to solace their weary hours by singing \"in parts.\"  Immediately after Shakespeare's time, we find a courtier of James I., and the ill-fated Prince Charles himself, both enthusiasts in both church and chamber music; and lastly, two years after the Regicide, we find the University of Oxford to have been a perfect hotbed of musical cultivation. Men who afterwards became Bishops, Archdeacons, Prebendaries, besides sixteen Fellows of Colleges, and sundry gentlemen of family, were not ashamed to practise chamber music and singing to an extent which really has no parallel whatever nowadays.  There is plenty of evidence, though more indirect in kind, that the lower classes were as enthusiastic about music as the higher. A large number of passages in contemporary authors shows clearly that singing in parts (especially of \"catches\") was a common amusement with blacksmiths, colliers, cloth-workers, cobblers, tinkers, watchmen, country parsons, and soldiers.  In _Damon and Pithias_, 1565, Grimme, the _collier_, sings \"a bussing [buzzing] base,\" and two of his friends, Jack and Will, \"quiddel upon it,\" _i.e._, they sing the tune and words, while he buzzes the burden.  Peele's _Old Wives Tale_, 1595, says, \"This _smith_ leads a life as merry as a king; Sirrah Frolic, I am sure you are not without some _round_ or other; no doubt but Clunch [the smith] can _bear his part_.\"  Beaumont and Fletcher's _Coxcomb_ has       \"Where were the _watch_ the while? good sober gentlemen,      They were, like careful members of the city,      Drawing in diligent ale, and _singing catches_.\"  Also in B. and F.'s _Faithful Friends_--       \"_Bell._--Shall's have a _catch_, my hearts?       _Calve._--Aye, good lieutenant.       _Black._--Methinks a _soldier_[3] should sing nothing else;      _catch, that catch may_ is all our life, you know.\"  [Footnote 3: Drayton (James I.'s reign) in his \"Battle of Agincourt,\" l. 1199, has--\"The common Souldiers free-mens _catches_ sing\"--of the French before the battle (_free_men is a corruption of _three_men).]  [In _Bonduca_, a play of B. and F's., altered for operatic setting by Purcell in 1695, there is a catch in three parts, sung by the Roman soldiers.]  In Sir William Davenant's (Davenant flourished 1635) comedy _The Wits_, Snore, one of the characters, says--       \"It must be late, for gossip Nock, the _nailman_,      Had catechized his maids, and _sung three catches      And a song_, ere we set forth.\"  Samuel Harsnet, in his _Declaration of Egregious Impostures_, 1603, mentions a 'merry catch,' 'Now God be with old Simeon' (for which see Rimbault's Rounds, Canons, and Catches of England), which he says was sung by _tinkers_ 'as they sit by the fire, with a pot of good ale between their legs.'  And in _The Merry Devill of Edmonton_, 1631, there is a comical story of how Smug _the miller_ was _singing a catch_ with the _merry Parson_ in an alehouse, and how they 'tost' the words \"_I'll ty my mare in thy ground_,\" 'so long to and fro,' that Smug forgot he was singing a catch, and began to quarrel with the Parson, 'thinking verily, he had meant (as he said in his song) to _ty his mare in his ground_.'  Finally, in _Pammelia_, a collection of Rounds and Catches of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 parts, edited by Thomas Ravenscroft, and published in 1609, there is a curious preface, which states that 'Catches are so _generally affected_ ... because they are so consonant to _all ordinary musical capacity_, being such, indeed, as all such _whose love of musick exceeds their skill_, cannot but commend.' The preface further asserts that the book is 'published only _to please good company_.'  To go on to _instrumental_ music among the lower classes of Elizabethan and Shakespearian times; there is an allusion in the above quoted passage from Morley (1597) to the habit of playing on an instrument in a barber's shop while waiting one's turn to be shaved. This is also referred to in Ben Jonson's _Alchemist_ and _Silent Woman_. In the latter play, Cutberd the barber has recommended a wife to Morose. Morose finds that instead of a mute helpmate he has got one who had 'a tongue with a tang,' and exclaims 'that cursed _barber_! I have married his _cittern_ that is common to all men': meaning that as the barber's cittern was always being played, so his wife was always talking.  There is a poem of the 18th century which speaks of the old times,       'In former time 't hath been upbrayded thus,      That _barber's musick_ was most _barbarous_.'  However true that may have been--at all events it is certain that in the 16th and 17th centuries it was customary to hear instrumental music in a barber's shop, generally of a cittern, which had four strings and frets, like a guitar, and was thought a vulgar instrument.[4]  [Footnote 4: The Cittern of the barber's shop had four double strings of wire, tuned thus--1st, E in 4th space of treble staff; 2nd, D a tone lower; 3rd, G on 2nd line; 4th, B on 3rd line. The instrument had a carved head. See _L.L.L._ V. ii., lines 600-603, of Holofernes' head. Also the frontispiece, where the treble viol and viol-da-gamba have carved heads, both human, but of different types. Fantastic heads, as of dragons or gargoyles, were often put on these instruments.]  Another use of instrumental music was to entertain the guests in a tavern. A pamphlet called _The Actor's Remonstrance_, printed 1643, speaks of the _decay_ of music in taverns, which followed the closing of theatres in 1642, as follows:--\"Our music, that was held so delectable and precious [_i.e._, in Shakespeare's times], that _they scorned to come to a tavern under twenty shillings_ salary _for two hours_, now wander [_i.e._, 1643] with their instruments under their cloaks--I mean, such as have any--into all houses of good fellowship, saluting every room where there is company with, 'Will you have any music, gentlemen?'\"  Finally, in Gosson's \"Short Apologie of the Schoole of Abuse,\" 1587, we find that \"London is so full of unprofitable pipers and fiddlers, that a man can no sooner enter a tavern, than two or three cast of them hang at his heels, to give him a dance before he depart.\" These men sang ballads and catches as well. Also they played during dinner. Lyly says--\"Thou need no more send for a fidler to a feast, than a beggar to a fair.\"  All this leads to the just conclusion, that if ever a country deserved to be called 'musical,' that country was England, in the 16th and 17th centuries. King and courtier, peasant and ploughman, each could 'take his part,' with each music was a part of his daily life; while so far from being above knowing the difference between a minim and a crotchet, a gentleman would have been ashamed not to know it.  In this respect, at any rate, the 'good old days' were indeed better than those that we now see. Even a _public-house song_ in Elizabeth's day was a canon in three parts, a"]]]
