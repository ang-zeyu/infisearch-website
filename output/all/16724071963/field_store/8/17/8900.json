But it cannot be imagined that these wholesale conversions were more than nominal in most cases, though the king's religion was outwardly the tribe's religion. If, as happened among the East Saxons, the king forsook his old gods, returned to them again, and finally forsook them altogether, the tribe followed his lead, and, in public at least, worshipped Christ, Odin, or any other deity whom the king favoured for the moment; but there can be hardly any doubt that in private the mass of the people adhered to the old religion to which they were accustomed. This tribal conversion is clearly marked when a heathen king married a Christian queen, or vice versa; and it must also be noted that a king never changed his religion without careful consultation with his chief men.[3] An example of the two religions existing side by side is found in the account of Redwald, King of the East Saxons, who 'in the same temple had an altar to sacrifice to Christ, and another small one to offer victims to devils'.[4]  The continuity of the ancient religion is proved by the references to it in the classical authors, the ecclesiastical laws, and other legal and historical records.  1st cent. Strabo, 63 B.C.-A.D. 23.       'In an island close to Britain, Demeter and Persephone are venerated      with rites similar to the orgies of Samothrace.'[5]  4th cent. Dionysius says that in islands near Jersey and Guernsey the rites of Bacchus were performed by the women, crowned with leaves; they danced and made an even greater shouting than the Thracians.[6]  7th cent. Theodore, Archbishop of Canterbury, 668-690.  The _Liber Poenitentialis_[7] of Theodore contains the earliest ecclesiastical laws of England. It consists of a list of offences and the penance due for each offence; one whole section is occupied with details of the ancient religion and of its rites. Such are:  Sacrifice to devils.  Eating and drinking in a heathen temple, (_a_) in ignorance, (_b_) after being told by the [Christian] priest that it is sacrilege and the table of devils, (_c_) as a cult of idols and in honour of idols.       'Not only celebrating feasts in the abominable places of the heathen      and offering food there, but also consuming it. Serving this hidden      idolatry, having relinquished Christ. If anyone at the kalends of      January goes about as a stag or a bull; that is, making himself into a      wild animal and dressing in the skin of a herd animal, and putting on      the heads of beasts; those who in such wise transform themselves into      the appearance of a wild animal, penance for three years because this      is devilish.'  _The Laws of Wihtraed_, King of Kent,[8] 690.  Fines inflicted on those who offer to devils.  8th cent. _The Confessionale and Poenitentiale of Ecgberht_, first Archbishop of York,[9] 734-766.  Prohibition of offerings to devils; of witchcraft; of auguries according to the methods of the heathen; of vows paid, loosed, or confirmed at wells, stones, or trees; of the gathering of herbs with any incantation except Christian prayers.  _The Law of the Northumbrian priests._[10]       'If then anyone be found that shall henceforth practise any      heathenship, either by sacrifice or by \"fyrt\", or in any way love      witchcraft, or worship idols, if he be a king's thane, let him pay X      half-marks; half to Christ, half to the king. We are all to love and      worship one God, and strictly hold one Christianity, and totally      renounce all heathenship.'  9th cent. _Decree attributed to a General Council of Ancyra._[11]       'Certain wicked women, reverting to Satan, and seduced by the      illusions and phantasms of demons, believe and profess that they ride      at night with Diana on certain beasts, with an innumerable multitude      of women, passing over immense distances, obeying her commands as      their mistress, and evoked by her on certain nights.'  10th cent. _Laws of Edward and Guthrum._[12] After 901.       'If anyone violate christianity, or reverence heathenism, by word or      by work, let him pay as well _wer_, as _wite_ or _lah-slit_, according      as the deed may be.'  _Laws of King Athelstan_,[13] 924-940.       'We have ordained respecting witchcrafts, and _lyblacs_, and      _morthdaeds_: if anyone should be thereby killed, and he could not      deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at      the threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be cxx days in prison.'  _Ecclesiastical canons of King Edgar_,[14] 959.       'We enjoin, that every priest zealously promote Christianity, and      totally extinguish every heathenism; and forbid well worshipings, and      necromancies, and divinations, and enchantments, and man worshipings,      and the vain practices which are carried on with various spells, and      with \"frithsplots\",[15] and with elders, and also with various other      trees, and with stones, and with many various delusions, with which      men do much of what they should not.—And we enjoin, that every      Christian man zealously accustom his children to Christianity, and      teach them the Paternoster and the Creed. And we enjoin, that on feast      days heathen songs and devil's games be abstained from.'  _Laws of King Ethelred_,[16] 978-1016.       'Let every Christian man do as is needful to him; let him strictly      keep his Christianity.... Let us zealously venerate right      Christianity, and totally despise every heathenism.'  11th cent. _Laws of King Cnut_,[17] 1017-1035.       'We earnestly forbid every heathenism: heathenism is, that men worship      idols; that is, that they worship heathen gods, and the sun or the      moon, fire or rivers, water-wells or stones, or forest trees of any      kind; or love witchcraft, or promote _morth-work_ in any wise.'  13th cent. Witchcraft made into a sect and heresy by the Church. The priest of Inverkeithing presented before the bishop in 1282 for leading a fertility dance at Easter round the phallic figure of a god; he was allowed to retain his benefice.[18]  14th cent. In 1303 the Bishop of Coventry was accused before the Pope for doing homage to the Devil.[19]  _Trial of Dame Alice Kyteler_, 1324.  Tried for both operative and ritual witchcraft, and found guilty.  _Nider's Formicarius_, 1337.  A detailed account of witches and their proceedings in Berne, which had been infested by them for more than sixty years.  15th cent. Joan of Arc burnt as a witch, 1431. Gilles de Rais executed as a witch, 1440.  _Bernardo di Bosco_, 1457.       Sent by Pope Calixtus III to suppress the witches in Brescia and its      neighbourhood.  _Bull of Pope Innocent VIII_, 1484.       'It has come to our ears that numbers of both sexes do not avoid to      have intercourse with demons, Incubi and Succubi; and that by their      sorceries, and by their incantations, charms, and conjurations, they      suffocate, extinguish, and cause to perish the births of women, the      increase of animals, the corn of the ground, the grapes of the      vineyard and the fruit of the trees, as well as men, women, flocks,      herds, and other various kinds of animals, vines and apple trees,      grass, corn and other fruits of the earth; making and procuring that      men and women, flocks and herds and other animals shall suffer and be      tormented both from within and without, so that men beget not, nor      women conceive; and they impede the conjugal action of men and women.'  It will be seen by the foregoing that so far from the Bull of Pope Innocent VIII being the beginning of the 'outbreak of witchcraft', as so many modern writers consider, it is only one of many ordinances against the practices of an earlier cult. It takes no account of the effect of these practices on the morals of the people who believed in them, but lays stress only on their power over fertility; the fertility of human beings, animals, and crops. In short it is exactly the pronouncement which one would expect from a Christian against a heathen form of religion in which the worship of a god of fertility was the central idea. It shows therefore that the witches were considered to deal with fertility only.  Looked upon in the light of a fertility cult, the ritual of the witches becomes comprehensible. Originally for the promotion of fertility, it became gradually degraded into a method for blasting fertility, and thus the witches who had been once the means of bringing prosperity to the people and the land by driving out all evil influences, in process of time were looked upon as being themselves the evil influences, and were held in horror accordingly.  The actual feelings of the witches towards their religion have been recorded in very few cases, but they can be inferred from the few records which remain. The earliest example is from Lorraine in 1408, 'lequel méfait les susdites dames disoient et confessoient avoir enduré à leur contentement et saoulement de plaisir que n'avoient eu onc de leur vie en tel pourchas'.[20] De Lancre took a certain amount of trouble to obtain the opinions of the witches, whereby he was obviously scandalized.       'Vne sorciere entre autres fort insigne nous dict qu'elle auoit      tousiours creu, que la sorcelerie estoit la meilleure      religion.—Ieanne Dibasson aagee de vingt neuf ans nous dict que le      sabbat estoit le vray Paradis, où il y a beaucoup plus de plaisir      qu'on ne peut exprimer. Que ceux qui y vont trouuent le temps si court      à force de plaisir & de contentemẽt, qu'ils n'en peuuent sortir      sans vn merveilleux regret, de maniere qu'il leur tarde infiniment      qu'ils n'y reuiennent.—Marie de la Ralde, aagee de vingt huict ans,      tres belle femme, depose qu'elle auoit vn singulier plaisir d'aller au      sabbat, si bien que"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20411"],["title","The Witch-cult in Western Europe: A Study in Anthropology (#4)"],["body"," on la venoit semondre d'y aller elle y      alloit comme à nopces: non pas tant pour la liberté & licence qu'on a      de s'accointer ensemble (ce que par modestie elle dict n'auoir iamais      faict ny veu faire) mais parce que le Diable tenoit tellement liés      leurs coeurs & leurs volontez qu'à peine y laissoit il entrer nul      autre desir.... Au reste elle dict qu'elle ne croyoit faire aucun mal      d'aller au sabbat, & qu'elle y auoit beaucoup plus de plaisir &      contentement que d'aller à la Messe, parce que le Diable leur faisoit      à croire qu'il estoit le vray Dieu, & que la ioye que les sorciers      prenoyent au sabbat n'estoit qu'vn commencement d'vne beaucoup plus      grande gloire.—Elles disoyent franchement, qu'elles y alloyent &      voyoient toutes ces execrations auec vne volupté admirable, & vn desir      enrager d'y aller & d'y estre, trouuãt les iours trop reculez de la      nuict pour faire le voyage si desiré, & le poinct ou les heures pour y      aller trop lentes, & y estant, trop courtes pour vn si agreable seiour      & delicieux amusement.—En fin il a le faux martyre: & se trouue des      Sorciers si acharnez à son seruice endiablé, qu'il n'y a torture ny      supplice qui les estonne, & diriez qu'ils vont au vray martyre & à la      mort pour l'amour de luy, aussi gayement que s'ils alloient à vn      festin de plaisir & reioüyssance publique.—Quand elles sont preuenues      de la Iustice, elles ne pleurent & ne iettent vne seule larme, voire      leur faux martyre soit de la torture, soit du gibet leur est si      plaisant, qu'il tarde à plusieurs qu'elles ne soiẽt executées à      mort, & souffrẽt fort ioyeusement qu'on leur face le procez, tant      il leur tarde qu'elles ne soient auec le Diable. Et ne s'impatientent      de rien tant en leur prison, que de ce qu'elles ne lui peuuent      tesmoigner cōbiẽ elles souffrent & desirent souffrir pour      luy.'[21]  Bodin says, 'Il y en a d'autres, ausquelles Satan promet qu'elles seront bien heureuses apres cette vie, qui empesche qu'elles ne se repentent, & meurent obstinees en leur mechanceté'.[22]  Madame de Bourignon's girls at Lille (1661) 'had not the least design of changing, to quit these abominable Pleasures, as one of them of Twenty-two Years old one day told me. _No_, said she, _I will not be other than I am; I find too much content in my Condition_.'[23] Though the English and Scotch witches' opinions are not reported, it is clear from the evidence that they were the same as those of the Basses-Pyrénées, for not only did they join of their own free will but in many cases there seems to have been no need of persuasion. In a great number of trials, when the witches acknowledged that they had been asked to become members of the society, there follows an expression of this sort, 'ye freely and willingly accepted and granted thereto'. And that they held to their god as firmly as those de Lancre put to death is equally evident in view of the North Berwick witches, of Rebecca West and Rose Hallybread, who 'dyed very Stuburn, and Refractory without any Remorss, or seeming Terror of Conscience for their abominable Witch-craft';[24] Major Weir, who perished as a witch, renouncing all hope of heaven;[25] and the Northampton witches, Agnes Browne and her daughter, who 'were never heard to pray, or to call vppon God, never asking pardon for their offences either of God or the world in this their dangerous, and desperate Resolution, dyed'; Elinor Shaw and Mary Phillips, at their execution 'being desired to say their Prayers, they both set up a very loud Laughter, calling for the Devil to come and help them in such a Blasphemous manner, as is not fit to Mention; so that the Sherif seeing their presumptious Impenitence, caused them to be Executed with all the Expedition possible; even while they were Cursing and raving, and as they liv'd the Devils true Factors, so they resolutely Dyed in his Service': the rest of the Coven also died 'without any confession or contrition'.[26]  FOOTNOTES:  [Footnote 3: Hunt, vol. i]  [Footnote 4: Bede, Bk.

THE GOD  1. _As God_   It is impossible to understand the witch-cult without first understanding the position of the chief personage of that cult. He was known to the contemporary Christian judges and recorders as the Devil, and was called by them Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, the Foul Fiend, the Enemy of Salvation, and similar names appropriate to the Principle of Evil, the Devil of the Scriptures, with whom they identified him.  This was far from the view of the witches themselves. To them this so-called Devil was God, manifest and incarnate; they adored him on their knees, they addressed their prayers to him, they offered thanks to him as the giver of food and the necessities of life, they dedicated their children to him, and there are indications that, like many another god, he was sacrificed for the good of his people.  The contemporary writers state in so many words that the witches believed in the divinity of their Master. Danaeus, writing in 1575, says, 'The Diuell co[~m]aundeth them that they shall acknowledge him for their god, cal vpõ him, pray to him, and trust in him.—Then doe they all repeate the othe which they haue geuen vnto him; in acknowledging him to be their God.'[27] Gaule, in 1646, nearly a century later, says that the witches vow 'to take him [the Devil] for their God, worship, invoke, obey him'.[28]  The witches are even more explicit, and their evidence proves the belief that their Master was to them their God. The accusation against Elisabeth Vlamyncx of Alost, 1595, was that 'vous n'avez pas eu honte de vous agenouiller devant votre Belzebuth, que vous avez adoré'.[29] The same accusation was made against Marion Grant of Aberdeen, 1596, that 'the Deuill quhome thow callis thy god ... causit the worship him on thy kneis as thy lord'.[30] De Lancre (1609) records, as did all the Inquisitors, the actual words of the witches; when they presented a young child, they fell on their knees and said, 'Grand Seigneur, lequel i'adore', and when the child was old enough to join the society she made her vow in these words: 'Ie me remets de tout poinct en ton pouuoir & entre tes mains, ne recognois autre Dieu: si bien que tu es mon Dieu'.[31] Silvain Nevillon, tried at Orleans in 1614, said, 'On dit au Diable nous vous recognoissons pour nostre maistre, nostre Dieu, nostre Createur'.[32] The Lancashire witch, Margaret Johnson, 1633, said: 'There appeared vnto her a spirit or divell in the similitude and proportion of a man. And the said divell or spirit bidd her call him by the name of Mamillion. And saith, that in all her talke and conferense shee calleth her said Divell Mamillion, my god.'[33] According to Madame Bourignon, 1661, 'Persons who were thus engaged to the Devil by a precise Contract, will allow no other God but him'.[34] Isobel Gowdie confessed that 'he maid vs beliew that ther wes no God besyd him.—We get all this power from the Divell, and when ve seik it from him, ve call him \"owr Lord\".—At each tyme, quhan ve wold meitt with him, we behoowit to ryse and mak our curtesie; and we wold say, \"Ye ar welcom, owr Lord,\" and \"How doe ye, my Lord.\"'[35] The Yorkshire witch, Alice Huson, 1664, stated that the Devil 'appeared like a _Black Man_ upon a Black Horse, with Cloven Feet; and then I fell down, and did Worship him upon my Knees'.[36] Ann Armstrong in Northumberland, 1673, gave a good deal of information about her fellow witches: 'The said Ann Baites hath severall times danced with the divell att the places aforesaid, calling him, sometimes, her protector, and, other sometimes, her blessed saviour.—She saw Forster, Dryden, and Thompson, and the rest, and theire protector, which they call'd their god, sitting at the head of the table.—When this informer used meanes to avoyd theire company, they threatned her, if she would not turne to theire god, the last shift should be the worst.'[37] At Crighton, 1678, the Devil himself preached to the witches, 'and most blasphemously mocked them, if they offered to trust in God who left them miserable in the world, and neither he nor his Son Jesus Christ ever appeared to them when they called on them, as he had, who would not cheat them'.[38] Even in America, 1692, Mary Osgood, the wife of Capt. Osgood, declared that 'the devil told her he was her God, and that she should serve and worship him'.[39]  Prayers were addressed to the Master by his followers, and in some instances the prayer was taught by him. Alice Gooderidge of Stapenhill in Derbyshire, 1597, herself a witch and the daughter of a witch, was charged by Sir Humphrey Ferrers 'with witchcraft about one Michael's Cow: which Cow when shee brake all thinges that they tied her in, ranne to this Alice Gooderige her house, scraping at the walls and windowes to haue come in: her olde mother Elizabeth "]]]
