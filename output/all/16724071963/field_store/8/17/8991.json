We can't have no real Christmas, of course. But I'd planned some little things made out of what I had in the house: things that wouldn't be anything, and yet would seem a little something.\"  Mis' Mortimer Bates swept round at her.  \"Children,\" she said, \"ought to be showed how to do without things. Bennet and Gussie ain't expecting a sliver of nothing for Christmas--not a sliver.\"  Mis' Winslow unexpectedly flared up.  \"Whether it shows through on the outside or not,\" she said, \"I'll bet you they are.\"  \"My three,\" Mis' Emerson Morse put in pacifically, \"have been kept from popping corn and cracking nuts all Fall so's they could do both Christmas night, and it would seem like something that _was_ something.\"  \"That ain't the idea,\" Mis' Bates insisted; \"I want them learnt to do without--\" (\"They'll learn that,\" Mis' Abby Winslow said; \"they'll learn....\") \"Happening as it does to most every one of us not to have no Christmas, they won't be no distinctions drawn. None of the children can brag--and children is limbs of Satan for bragging,\" she added. (She was remembering a brief conversation overheard that day between Gussie and Pep, the minister's son:--  \"I've got a doll,\" said Gussie.  \"I've got a dollar,\" said Pep.  \"My mamma went to a tea party,\" said Gussie.  \"My mamma give one,\" said Pep.  Gussie mustered her forces. \"My papa goes to work every morning,\" she topped it.  \"My papa don't have to,\" said Pep, and closed the incident.)  \"I can't help who's a limb of Satan,\" Mis' Winslow replied doggedly, \"I can't seem to sense Christmas time without Christmas.\"  \"It won't _be_ Christmas time if you don't have any Christmas,\" Mis' Bates persisted.  \"Oh, yes it will,\" Mis' Winslow said. \"Oh, yes, it will. You can't stop that.\"  It was Mis' Bates, who, from the high-backed plush rocker, rapped with the blue glass paperweight on the red glass lamp and, in the absence of Mr. Bates, called the meeting to order. The Old Trail Town Society was organized on a platform of \"membership unlimited, dues nothing but taking turns with the entertaining, officers to consist of: President, the host of the evening (or wife, if any), and no minutes to bother with.\" And it was to a meeting so disposed on the subject of Christmas that Simeon Buck rose to present his argument.  \"Mr. President,\" he addressed the chair.  \"It's Madam President, you ninny geese,\" corrected Buff Miles, _sotto voce_.  \"It had ought to be Madam Chairman,\" objected Mis' Moran; \"she ain't the continuous president.\"  \"Well, for the land sakes, call me Mis' Bates, formal, and go ahead,\" said the lady under discussion. \"Only I bet you've forgot now what you was going to say.\"  \"Not much I did _not_,\" Simeon Buck continued composedly, and, ignoring the interruptions, let his own vocative stand. Then he presented a memorandum of a sum of money. It was not a large sum. But when he quoted it, everybody looked at everybody else, stricken. For it was a sum large enough to have required, in the earning, months of work on the part of an appalling proportion of Old Trail Town.  \"From the day after Thanksgiving to the night before Christmas last year,\" said Simeon, \"that is the amount that the three hundred souls--no, I guess it must have been bodies--in our town spent in the local stores. Now, bare living expenses aside,--which ain't very much for us all, these days,--this amount may be assumed to have been spent by the lot of us for Christmas. Of course there was those,\" continued Mr. Buck, looking intelligently about him, \"who bought most of their Christmas stuff in the City. But these--these economic traitors only make the point of what I say the more so. Without them, the town spent this truly amazing sum in keeping the holidays. Now, I ask you, frank, could the town afford that, or anything like that?\"  Buff Miles spoke out of the extremity of his reflections.  \"That's a funny crack,\" he said, \"for a merchant to make. Why not leave 'em spend and leave 'em pay?\"  \"Oh, I'll leave 'em _pay_ all right,\" rejoined Simeon, significantly, and stood silent and smiling until there were those in the room who uncomfortably shifted.  Then he told them the word he bore from Ebenezer Rule that as they had feared and half expected, the factory was not to open that Winter at all. Hardly a family represented in the rooms was not also representative of a factory employee, now idle these seven months, as they were periodically idle at the times of \"enforced\" suspension of the work.  \"What I'm getting at is this,\" Simeon summed it up, \"and Abel Ames, here, backs me up--don't you, Abel?--that hadn't we all ought to come to some joint conclusion about our Christmas this year, and roust the town up to it, like a town, and not go it blind and either get in up to our necks in debt, same as City folks, or else quit off Christmas, individual, and mebbe hurt folks's feelings? Why not move intelligent, like a town, and all agree out-and-out to leave Christmas go by this year? And have it understood, thorough?\"  It was very still in the little rooms when he had finished. There seems to be no established etiquette of revolutions. But something of the unconsciousness of the enthusiast was upon Mis' Mortimer Bates, and she spoke before she knew:--  \"So's we can be sure everybody else'll know it and not give something either and be disappointed too,\" she assented. \"Well, I bet everybody'd be real relieved.\"  \"The churches has sanctioned us doing away with Christmas this year by doing away with it themselves,\" observed Mis' Jane Moran. \"That'd ought to be enough to go by.\"  \"It don't seem to me Christmas is a thing for the churches to decide about,\" said Simeon, thoughtfully. \"It seems to me the matter is up to the merchants and the grocers and the family providers. We're the ones most concerned. Us providers have got to scratch gravel to get together any Christmas at all, if any. And speaking for us merchants, I may say, we'll lay in the stock if folks'll buy it. But if they can't afford to pay for it, we don't want the stock personally.\"  \"I guess we've all had the experience,\" observed Mis' Jane Moran, \"of announcing we wasn't going to give any gifts _this_ year, and then had somebody send something embroidered by hand, with a solid month's work on it. But if we all agree to secede from Christmas, we can lay down the law to folks so's it'll be understood: _No Christmas for nobody_.\"  \"Not to children?\" said Mis' Abby Winslow, doubtfully.  \"My idea is to teach 'em to do entirely without Christmas,\" harped Mis' Bates. \"We can't afford one. Why not let the children share in the family privation without trying to fool 'em with make-shift presents and boiled sugar?\"  Over in a corner near the window plants, whose dead leaves she had been picking off, sat Ellen Bourne--Mis' Matthew Bourne she was, but nearly everybody called her Ellen Bourne. There is some law about these things: why instinctively we call some folk by the whole name, some by their first names, some by the last, some by shortening the name, some by a name not their own. Perhaps there is a name for each of us, if only we knew where to look, and folk intuitively select the one most like that. Perhaps some of us, by the sort of miracle that is growing every day, got the name that is meant for us. Perhaps some of us struggle along with consonants that spell somebody else. And how did some names get themselves so terrifically overused unless by some strange might, say, a kind of astrological irregularity.... Ellen Bourne sat by the window and suddenly looked over her shoulder at the room.  \"If we've got the things made,\" she said, \"can't we give 'em? If it's to children?\"  \"I think if we're going to omit, we'd ought to omit,\" Mis Bates held her own; \"it can't matter to you, Ellen, with no children, so....\" She caught herself sharply up. Ellen's little boy had died a Christmas or two ago.  \"No,\" Ellen said, \"I ain't any children, of course. But--\"  \"Well, I think,\" said Mis' Jane Moran, \"that we've hit on the only way we could have hit on to chirk each other up over a hard time.\"  \"And get off delicate ourselves same time,\" said Buff Miles. From the first Buff had been advocating what he called \"an open Christmas,\" and there were those near him at the meeting to whom he had confided some plan about \"church choir Christmas carol serenades,\" which he was loath to see set at naught.  Not much afterward Simeon Buck put the motion:--  \"Mis' Chairman,\" he said, \"I move you--and all of us--that the Old Trail Town meeting do and hereby does declare itself in favour of striking Christmas celebrations from its calendar this year. And that we circulate a petition through the town to this effect, headed by our names. And that we all own up that it's for the simple and regretful reason that not a mother's son of us can afford to buy Christmas presents this year, and what's the use of scratching to keep up appearances?\"  For a breath Abel Ames hesitated; then he spoke voluntarily for the first time that evening.  \"Mr. President, I second the hull of that,\" said he, slowly, and without looking at anybody; and then sighed his vast, triple sigh.  There was apparently nobody to vote against the motion. Mis' Winslow did not vote at all. Ellen Bourne said \"No,\" but she said it so faintly that nobody heard save those nearest her, and they felt a bit embarrassed for her because she had spoken alone, and they tried to cover up the minute.  \"Carried,\" said the Chair, and slipped out in the kitchen to put on the coffee.  At the meeting there was almost nobody who,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20516"],["title","Christmas: A Story (#3)"],["body","the course of the evening, did not make or reply to some form of observation on one theme. It was:--  \"Well, I wish Mary Chavah'd been to the meeting. She'd have enjoyed herself.\"  Or, \"Well, won't Mary Chavah be glad of this plan they've got? She's wanted it a good while.\"  Or, \"We all seem to have come to Mary Chavah's way of thinking, don't we? You know, she ain't kept any Christmas for years.\"  Unless it was Abel Ames. He, in fact, made or replied to almost no observations that evening. He drank his coffee without cream, sugar, or spoon,--they are always overlooking somebody's essentials in this way, and such is Old Trail Town's shy courtesy that the omission is never mentioned or repaired by the victim,--and sighed his triple sigh at intervals, and went home.  \"Hetty,\" he said to his wife, who had not gone to the meeting, \"they put it through. We won't have no Christmas creditors this year. We don't have to furnish charged Christmas presents for nobody.\"  She looked up from the towel she was featherstitching--she was a little woman who carried her head back and had large eyes and the long, curved lashes of a child.  \"I s'pose you're real relieved, ain't you, Abel?\" she answered.  \"My, yes,\" said Abel, without expression. \"My, yes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  They all took the news home in different wise.  \"Matthew,\" said Ellen Bourne, \"the town meeting voted not to have any Christmas this year. That is, to ask the folks not to have any--'count of expense.\"  \"Sensible move,\" said Matthew, sharpening his ax by the kitchen stove.  \"It'll be a relief for most folks not to have the muss and the clutter,\" said Ellen's mother.  \"Hey, king and country!\" said Ellen's old father, whittling a stick, \"I ain't done no more'n look on at a Christmas for ten years and more--with no children around so.\"  \"I know,\" said Ellen Bourne, \"I know....\"  The announcement was greeted by Mortimer Bates with a slap of the knee.  \"Good-by, folderol!\" he said. \"We need a sane Christmas in the world a good sight more'n we need a sane Fourth, most places. Good work.\"  But Bennet and Gussie Bates burst into wails.  \"Hush!\" said Mis' Bates, peremptorily. \"You ain't the only ones, remember. It's no Christmas for nobody!\"  \"I thought the rest of 'em would have one an' we could go over to theirs....\" sobbed Gussie.  \"I'd rather p'etend it's Christmas in other houses even if we ain't it!\" mourned Bennet.  \"Be my little man and woman,\" admonished Mis' Mortimer Bates.  At the Morans, little Emily Moran made an unexpected deduction:--  \"I _won't_ stay in bed all day Christmas!\" she gave out.  \"Stay in bed!\" echoed Mis' Moran. \"Why on this earth should you stay in bed?\"  \"Well, if we get up, then it's Christmas and you can't stop it!\" little Emily triumphed.  When they told Pep, the minister's son, after a long preparation by story and other gradual approach, and a Socratic questioning cleverly winning damning admissions from Pep, he looked up in his father's face thoughtfully:--  \"If they ain't no Christ's birthday this year, is it a lie that Christ was born?\" he demanded.  And secretly the children took counsel with one another: Would Buff Miles, the church choir tenor, take them out after dark on Christmas Eve, to sing church choir serenades at folks' gates, or would he not? And when they thought that he might not, because this would be considered Christmas celebration and would only make the absence of present-giving the more conspicuous, as in the case of the Sunday schools themselves, they faced still another theological quandary: For if it was true that Christ was born, then Christmas was his birthday; and if Christmas was his birthday, wasn't it wicked not to pay any attention?  Alone of them all, little Tab Winslow rejoiced. His brothers and sisters made the time tearful with questionings as to the effect on Santa Claus, and how would they get word to him, and would it be Christmas in the City, and why couldn't they move there, and other matters denoting the reversal of this their earth. But Tab slipped out the kitchen door, to the corner of the barn, where the great turkey gobbler who had been named held his empire trustingly.  \"Oh, Theophilus Thistledown,\" said Tab to him, \"you're the only one in this town that's goin' to have a Christmas. You ain't got to be et.\"     IV   The placard was tacked to the Old Trail Town post-office wall, between a summons to join the Army and the Navy of the United States, and the reward offered for an escaped convict--all three manifestoes registering something of the stage of society's development.       NOTICE       Owing to the local business depression and to the current private      decisions to get up very few home Christmas celebrations this year,      and also to the vote of the various lodges, churches, Sunday      schools, etc., etc., etc., to forego the usual Christmas tree      observances, the merchants of this town have one and all united      with most of the folks to petition the rest to omit all Christmas      presents, believing that the Christmas spirit will be kept up best      by all agreeing to act alike. All that's willing may announce it by      signing below and notifying others.                                                             THE COMMITTEE.  There were only three hundred folk living in Old Trail Town. Already two thirds of their signatures were scrawled on the sheets of foolscap tacked beneath the notice.  On the day after her return home, Jenny Wing stood and stared at the notice. Her mother had written to her of the town's talk, but the placard made it seem worse.  \"I'll go in on the way home and see what Mary says,\" she thought, and asked for the letter that lay in Mary Chavah's box, next her own. They gave her the letter without question. All Old Trail Town asks for its neighbour's mail and reads its neighbour's postmarks and gets to know the different Writings and to inquire after them, like persons. (\"He ain't got so much of a curl to his M to-day,\" one will say of a superscription. \"Better write right back and chirk 'im up.\" Or, \"Here's Her that don't seal her letters good. Tell her about that, why don't you?\" Or, \"This Writing's a stranger to me. I'll just wait a minute to see if birth or death gets out of the envelope.\")  As she closed Mary's gate and hurried up the walk, in a keen wind flowing with little pricking flakes, Jenny was startled to see both parlour windows open. The white muslin curtains were blowing idly as if June were in the air. Turning as a matter of course to the path that led to the kitchen, she was hailed by Mary, who came out the front door with a rug in her hands.  \"Step right in this way,\" said Mary; \"this door's unfastened.\"  \"Forevermore!\" Jenny said, \"Mary Chavah! What you got your house all open for? You ain't moving?\"  A gust of wind took Mary's answer. She tossed the rug across the icy railing of the porch and beckoned Jenny into the house, and into the parlour. And when she had greeted Jenny after the months of her absence:--  \"See,\" Mary said exultantly, \"don't it look grand and empty? Look at it first, and then come on in and I'll tell you about it.\"  The white-papered walls of the two rooms were bare of pictures; the floor had been sparingly laid with rugs. The walnut sofa and chairs, the table for the lamp, and the long shelves of her grandfather's books--these were all that the room held. A white arch divided the two chambers, like a benign brow whose face had long been dimmed away. It was all exquisitely clean and icy cold. A little snow drifted in through the muslin curtains. The breath of the two women showed.  \"What on earth you done that for?\" Jenny demanded.  Mary Chavah stood in the empty archway, the satisfaction on her face not veiling its pure austerity. She was not much past thirty-three, but she looked older, for she was gaunt. Her flesh had lost its firmness, her dressmaking had stooped her, her strong frame moved as if it habitually shouldered its way. In her broad forehead and deep eyes and somewhat in her silent mouth, you read the woman--the rest of her was obscured in her gentle reticence. She had a gray shawl, blue-bordered, folded tightly about her head and pinned under her chin, and it wrapped her to her feet.  \"I feel like a thing in a new shell,\" she said. \"Come on in where it's warm.\"  Instead of moving her dining-room table to her kitchen, as most of Old Trail Town did in Winter, Mary had moved her cooking stove into the dining room, had improvised a calico-curtained cupboard for the utensils, and there she lived and sewed. The windows were bare.  \"I'll let the parlour have curtains if it wants to,\" she had said, \"but in the room I live in I want every strip of the sun I can get.\"  There were no plants, though every house in Old Trail Town had a window of green, and slips without number were offered....  \"... You can have flowers all you want,\" she said once; \"I like 'em too well to box 'em up in the house.\"  And there were no books.  \"I don't read,\" she admitted; \"I ain't ever read a book in my life but \"Pilgrim's Progress\" and the first four chapters of \"Ben Hur.\" What's the use of pretending, when books is such a nuisance to dust? Grandfather's books in the parlour--oh, they ain't books. They're furniture.\"  But she had a little bookcase whose shelves were filled with her patterns--in her dressmaking she never used a fashion plate.  \"I like to make 'em up and cut 'em out,\" she sometimes told her friends. \"I don't care nothing whatever about the dresses when they get done--more fool the women for ornamenting themselves up like lamp shades, I always think. But I just do love to fuss with the paper and make it do like I say. Land, I've got my cupboard full of more patterns than I'd ever get orders for if I lived to be born again.\"  She sat down before the cooking stove and drew off her woolen mittens. She folded a hand on her cheek, forcing the cheek out of drawing by her hand's "]]]
