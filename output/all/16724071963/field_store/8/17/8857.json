LADY ---- spoke to the butler to be saving of an excellent cask of small beer, and asked him how it might be best preserved. \"I know no method so effectual, my lady,\" replied the butler, \"as placing a barrel of _good_ ale by it.\"           XI.--NEW RELATIONSHIP.  A STRANGER to law courts hearing a judge call a sergeant \"brother,\" expressed his surprise. \"Oh,\" said one present, \"they are brothers--_brothers-in-law_.\"           XII.--A SMALL INHERITANCE.  IT was the habit of Lord Eldon, when Attorney-General, to close his speeches with some remarks justifying his own character. At the trial of Horne Tooke, speaking of his own reputation, he said: \"It is the little inheritance I have to leave my children, and, by God's help, I will leave it unimpaired.\" Here he shed tears; and, to the astonishment of those present, Mitford, the Solicitor-General, began to weep. \"Just look at Mitford,\" said a by-stander to Horne Tooke; \"what on earth is he crying for?\" Tooke replied, \"He is crying to think what a _small_ inheritance Eldon's children are likely to get.\"           XIII.--A DIFFERENCE.  JERROLD one day met a Scotch gentleman, whose name was Leitch, and who explained that he was not the popular caricaturist, John Leech. \"I'm aware of that; you're the Scotchman with the _i-t-c-h_ in your name,\" said Jerrold.           XIV.--THE LIGHT SUBJECT.  THE government, having threatened to proceed rigorously against those who refused to pay the assessed taxes, offered to them a remission of _one fourth_. \"This at least,\" said a sufferer, \"may be called, giving them some _quarter_.\"           XV.--COMPLIMENTARY.  LORD NORTH, who was very corpulent before a severe sickness, said to his physician after it, \"Sir, I am obliged to you for introducing me to some old acquaintances.\"--\"Who are they, my lord?\"--\"_My ribs_,\" replied his lordship, \"which I have not felt for many years until now.\"           XVI.--A FAIR SUBSTITUTE.  WHEN Lord Sandwich was to present Admiral Campbell, he told him, that probably the king would knight him. The admiral did not much relish the honor. \"Well, but,\" said Lord S., \"perhaps Mrs. Campbell will like it.\"--\"Then let the king _knight her_,\" answered the rough seaman.           XVII.--A CONSTITUTIONAL PUN.  DANIEL PURCELL, the famous punster, was desired to make a pun extempore. \"Upon what subject?\" said Daniel. \"The king,\" answered the other. \"O, sir,\" said he, \"the _king_ is no _subject_.\"           XVIII.--A CONVERT.  A NOTORIOUS miser having heard a very eloquent charity sermon, exclaimed, \"This sermon strongly proves the necessity of alms. I have almost a mind to turn _beggar_.\"           XIX.--INCREDIBLE.  SHERIDAN made his appearance one day in a pair of new boots; these attracting the notice of some of his friends, \"Now guess,\" said he, \"how I came by these boots?\" Many _probable_ guesses then took place. \"No!\" said Sheridan, \"no, you've not hit it, nor ever will,--I bought them, and paid for them!\"           XX.--ALL THE DIFFERENCE.  IN a large party, one evening, the conversation turned upon young men's allowance at college. Tom Sheridan lamented the ill-judging parsimony of many parents in that respect. \"I am sure, Tom,\" said his father, \"you need not complain; I always allowed you eight hundred a year.\"--\"Yes, father, I must confess you _allowed_ it; but then it was never paid.\"           XXI.--SPIRITUAL AND SPIRITUOUS.  DR. PITCAIRN had one Sunday stumbled into a Presbyterian church, probably to beguile a few idle moments (for few will accuse that gentleman of having been a warm admirer of _Calvinism_), and seeing the parson apparently overwhelmed by the importance of his subject: \"What makes the man _greet_?\" said Pitcairn to a fellow that stood near him. \"By my faith, sir,\" answered the other, \"you would perhaps greet, too, if you were in his place, _and had as little to say_.\"--\"Come along with me, friend, and let's have a glass together; you are too good a fellow to be here,\" said Pitcairn, delighted with the man's repartee.           XXII.--A WONDERFUL WOMAN.  WHEN a late Duchess of Bedford was last at Buxton, and then in her eighty-fifth year, it was the medical farce of the day for the faculty to resolve every complaint of whim and caprice into \"a shock of the nervous system.\" Her grace, after inquiring of many of her friends in the rooms what brought them there, and being generally answered for a nervous complaint, was asked in her turn, \"What brought her to Buxton?\"--\"I came only for pleasure,\" answered the healthy duchess; \"for, thank God, I was born before _nerves came into fashion_.\"           XXIII.--A WISE SON WHO KNEW HIS OWN FATHER.  SHERIDAN was very desirous that his son Tom should marry a young woman of large fortune, but knew that Miss Callander had won his son's heart. Sheridan, expatiating on the folly of his son, at length exclaimed, \"Tom, if you marry Caroline Callander, I'll cut you off with a shilling!\" Tom could not resist the opportunity of replying, and looking archly at his father said, \"Then, sir, you must _borrow_ it.\" Sheridan was tickled at the wit, and dropped the subject.           XXIV.--A WRITTEN CHARACTER.  GEORGE III. having purchased a horse, the dealer put into his hands a large sheet of paper, completely written over. \"What's this?\" said his majesty. \"The pedigree of the horse, sire, which you have just bought,\" was the answer. \"Take it back, take it back,\" said the king, laughing; \"it will do very well for the _next horse you sell_.\"           XXV.--WELL MATCHED.  DR. BUSBY, whose figure was beneath the common size, was one day accosted in a public coffee-room by an Irish baronet of colossal stature, with, \"May I pass to my seat, O Giant?\" When the doctor, politely making way, replied, \"Pass, O Pigmy!\"--\"O, sir,\" said the baronet, \"my expression alluded to the _size of your intellect_.\"--\"And my expression, sir,\" said the doctor, \"to the _size of yours_.\"           XXVI.--A PARDONABLE MISTAKE.  A BUTCHER of some eminence was lately in company with several ladies at a game of whist, where, having lost two or three rubbers, one of the ladies addressing him, asked, \"Pray, sir, what are the stakes now?\" To which, ever mindful of his occupation, he immediately replied, \"Madam, the best rump I cannot _sell_ lower than tenpence halfpenny _a pound_.\"           XXVII.--THREE CAUSES.  THREE gentlemen being in a coffee-house, one called for a dram, _because he was hot_. \"Bring me another,\" says his companion, \"_because I am cold_.\" The third, who sat by and heard them, very quietly called out, \"Here, boy, bring me a glass, _because I like it_.\"           XXVIII.--THE CONNOISSEUR.  A PERSON to whom the curiosities, buildings, &c., in Oxford were shown one very hot day, was asked by his companion if he would see the remainder of the University. \"My dear sir,\" replied the connoisseur, \"I am _stone blind_ already.\"           XXIX.--A SYMBOL.  A SATIRIC poet underwent a severe drubbing, and was observed to walk ever afterwards with a stick. \"Mr. P. reminds me,\" says a wag, \"of some of the saints, who are always painted with _the symbols_ of their martyrdom.\"           XXX.--THE ONE THING WANTING.  IN a small party, the subject turning on matrimony, a lady said to her sister, \"I wonder, my dear, you have never made a _match_; I think you want the _brimstone_\";--she replied, \"No, not the _brimstone_, only the _spark_.\"           XXXI.--A HORSE LAUGH.  A COACHMAN, extolling the sagacity of one of his horses, observed, that \"if anybody was to go for to use him ill, he would _bear malice_ like a _Christian_.\"           XXXII.--ONE GOOD TURN DESERVES ANOTHER.  DR. A., physician at Newcastle, being summoned to a vestry, in order to reprimand the sexton for drunkenness, he dwelt so long on the sexton's misconduct, as to draw from him this expression: \"Sir, I thought you would have been the last man alive to appear against me, as _I have covered so many blunders of yours_!\"           XXXIII.--A NOVEL COMPLAINT.  A RICH man sent to call a physician for a slight disorder. The physician felt his pulse, and said, \"Do you eat well?\"--\"Yes,\" said the patient. \"Do you sleep well?\"--\"I do.\"--\"Then,\" said the physician, \"I shall give you something to take away _all that_!\"           XXXIV.--A CONJUGAL CAUTION.  SIR GEORGE ETHEREGE, having run up a score at Lockit's, absented himself from the ordinary. In consequence of this, Mrs. Lockit was sent to dun him and threaten him with an action. He told the messenger that he would certainly kiss her if she stirred a step in it! On this, the message being brought, she called for her hood and scarf, and told her husband, who interposed, \"that she should see if there was any fellow alive that had the impudence!\"--\"Pr'ythee, my dear, don't be so rash,\" replied the good man; \"you don't know what a man may do _in a passion_.\"           XXXV.--A PORTRAIT CAPITALLY EXECUTED.  IN a bookseller's catalogue lately appeared the following article: \"Memoirs of Charles the First,--with, a _head capitally executed_.\"           XXXVI.--MATTER IN HIS MADNESS.  A LUNATIC in Bedlam was asked how he came there? He answered, \"By a dispute.\"--\"What dispute?\" The bedlamite replied, \"The world said I was _mad_; I said the world was _mad_, and they _outwitted me_.\"           XXXVII.--PLEASANT INVITATION.  SOME years ago, says Richardson, in his anecdotes of painting, a gentleman came to me to invite me to his house. \"I have,\" says he, \"a picture of Rubens, and it is a rare good one. Little H. the other day came to see it, and says it is _a copy_. If any one says so again, I'll _break his head_. Pray, Mr. Richardson, will you do me the favor to come, and give me _your real opinion of it_?\"           XXXVIII.--WELL-BRED HORSE.  \"HOW does your new-purchased horse _answer_?\" said the late Duke of Cumberland to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20352"],["title","The Jest Book (#2)"],["body"," Selwyn. \"I _really_ don't know,\" replied George, \"for I never _asked him a question_.\"           XXXIX.--\"ONE FOR HIS NOB.\"  A BARRISTER entered the hall with his wig very much awry, of which he was not at all apprised, but was obliged to endure from almost every observer some remark on its appearance, till at last, addressing himself to Mr. Curran, he asked him, \"Do you see anything ridiculous in this wig.\"--\"Nothing but _the head_,\" was the answer.           XL.--SOUND AND FURY.  A LADY, after performing, with the most brilliant execution, a sonato on the pianoforte, in the presence of Dr. Johnson, turning to the philosopher, took the liberty of asking him if he was fond of music? \"No, madam,\" replied the doctor; \"but of all _noises_, I think music is the least disagreeable.\"           XLI.--COME OF AGE.  A YOUNG man met a rival who was somewhat advanced in years, and, wishing to annoy him, inquired how old he was? \"I can't exactly tell,\" replied the other; \"but I can inform you that _an ass_ is older at twenty than a man at sixty!\"           XLII.--A STRIKING NOTICE.  THE following admonition was addressed by a Quaker to a man who was pouring forth a volley of ill language against him: \"Have a care, friend, thou mayest run _thy face_ against _my fist_.\"           XLIII.--UP IN THE WORLD.  A FELLOW boasting in company of his family, declared even his own father died in an exalted situation. Some of the company looking incredulous, another observed, \"I can bear testimony to the gentleman's veracity, as my father was sheriff for the county when his was _hanged_ for horse-stealing.\"           XLIV.--REVERSE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  WHEN General V---- was quartered in a small town in Ireland, he and his lady were regularly besieged as they got into their carriage by an old beggar-woman, who kept her post at the door, assailing them daily with fresh importunities. One morning, as Mrs. V. stepped into the carriage, the woman began: \"Oh, my lady! success to your ladyship, and success to your honor's honor: for sure I did not _dream_ last night that her ladyship gave me a pound of tea, and your honor gave me a pound of tobacco.\"--\"My good woman,\" said the general, \"dreams go by the rule of contrary.\"--\"Do they so?\" rejoined the old woman; \"then it must mean, that your honor will give me _the tea_, and her ladyship _the tobacco_.\"           XLV.--A DOGGED ANSWER.  BOSWELL, dining one day with Dr. Johnson, asked him if he did not think that a good cook was more essential to the community than a good poet. \"I don't suppose,\" said the doctor, \"that there's a _dog_ in the town but what thinks so.\"           XLVI.--VISIBLE DARKNESS.  A GENTLEMAN at an inn, seeing that the lights were so dim as only to render the darkness visible, called out, \"Here, waiter, let me have a couple of _decent_ candles to _see_ how these others _burn_.\"           XLVII.--HIC-CUPPING.  A GENTLEMAN, at whose house Swift was dining in Ireland, after dinner introduced remarkably small hock-glasses, and at length turning to Swift addressed him: \"Mr. Dean, I shall be happy to take a glass of hic, hæc, hoc, with you.\"--\"Sir,\" rejoined the doctor, \"I shall be happy to comply, but it must be out of a _hujus_ glass.\"           XLVIII.--WORDS THAT BURN.  DR. ROBERTSON observed, that Johnson's jokes were the rebukes of the righteous, described in Scripture as being like excellent oil. \"Yes,\" exclaimed Burke, \"_oil of vitriol_!\"           XLIX.--PASSING THE BOTTLE.  FOOTE being in company, and the wine producing more riot than concord, he observed one gentleman so far gone in debate as to throw the bottle at his antagonist's head; upon which, catching the missile in his hand, he restored the harmony of the company by observing, that \"if _the bottle was passed so quickly_, not one of them would be able to stand out the evening.\"           L.--\"JUNIUS\" DISCOVERED.  MR. ROGERS was requested by Lady Holland to ask Sir Philip Francis whether he was the author of Junius. The poet approached the knight, \"Will you, Sir Philip,--will your kindness excuse my addressing to you a single question?\"--\"At your peril, sir!\" was the harsh and the laconic answer. The intimidated bard retreated to his friends, who eagerly asked him the result of his application. \"I don't know,\" he answered, \"whether he is _Junius_; but, if he be, he is certainly _Junius Brutus_.\"           LI.--A WEAK WOMAN.  A LOVING husband once waited on a physician to request him to prescribe for his wife's eyes, which were very sore. \"Let her wash them,\" said the doctor, \"every morning with a small glass of brandy.\" A few weeks after, the doctor chanced to meet the husband. \"Well, my friend, has your wife followed my advice?\"--\"She has done everything in her power to do it, doctor\"; said the spouse, \"but she never could get the glass _higher than her mouth_.\"           LII.--TOO MANY COOKS.  ELWES, the noted miser, used to say, \"If you keep one servant, your work is done; if you keep two, it is half done; and if you keep three, you may _do it yourself_.\"           LIII.--LOOK IN HIS FACE.  ADMIRAL LORD HOWE, when a captain, was once hastily awakened in the middle of the night by the lieutenant of the watch, who informed him with great agitation that the ship was on fire near the magazine. \"If that be the case,\" said he, rising leisurely to put on his clothes, \"we shall soon know it.\" The lieutenant flew back to the scene of danger, and almost instantly returning, exclaimed, \"You need not, sir, be afraid, the fire is extinguished.\"--\"Afraid!\" exclaimed Howe, \"what do you mean by that, sir? I never was afraid in my life\"; and looking the lieutenant full in the face, he added, \"Pray, how does a man feel, sir, when he is afraid? _I need not ask how he looks_.\"           LIV.--NOTHING BUT THE \"BILL.\"  JOHN HORNE TOOKE'S opinion upon the subject of law was admirable. \"Law,\" he said, \"ought to be, not a luxury for the rich, but a remedy, to be easily, cheaply, and speedily obtained by the poor.\" A person observed to him, how excellent are the English laws, because they are impartial, and our courts of justice are open to all persons without distinction. \"And so,\" said Tooke, \"is the _London Tavern_, to such as can afford to _pay for their entertainment_.\"           LV.--AN EXTINGUISHER.  WHILE Commodore Anson's ship, the Centurion, was engaged in close fight, with the rich Spanish galleon, which he afterwards took, a sailor came running to him, and cried out, \"Sir, our ship is on fire very near the powder magazine.\"--\"Then pray, friend,\" said the commodore, not in the least degree discomposed, \"_run back and assist in putting it out_.\"           LVI.--A BAD SHOT.  A COCKNEY being out one day amusing himself with shooting, happened to fire through a hedge, on the other side of which was a man standing. The shot passed through the man's hat, but missed the bird. \"Did you fire at me, sir?\" he hastily asked. \"O! no, sir,\" said the shrewd sportsman, \"I _never hit_ what I fire at.\"           LVII.--WISE PRECAUTION.  IT is related of the great Dr. Clarke, that when in one of his leisure hours he was unbending himself with a few friends in the most playful and frolicsome manner, he observed Beau Nash approaching; upon which he suddenly stopped: \"My boys,\" said he, \"let us be _grave_: here comes a _fool_.\"           LVIII.--A TRUMP CARD.  AT one of the Holland-house Sunday dinner-parties, a year or two ago, Crockford's Club, then forming, was talked of; and the noble hostess observed, that the female passion for diamonds was surely less ruinous than the rage for play among men. \"In short, you think,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"that _clubs_ are worse than _diamonds_.\" This joke excited a laugh; and when it had subsided, Sydney Smith wrote the following _impromptu_ sermonet--most appropriately _on a card_:--      Thoughtless that \"all that's brightest fades,\"     Unmindful of that _Knave of Spades_,       The Sexton and his Subs:     How foolishly we play our parts!     Our _wives_ on _diamonds_ set their _hearts_,       _We_ set our _hearts_ on _clubs_!           LIX.--MISTAKEN IDENTITY.  A PHYSICIAN attending a lady several times, had received a couple of guineas each visit; at last, when he was going away, she gave him but one; at which he was surprised, and looking on the floor, \"I believe, madam,\" said he, \"I have _dropt a guinea_.\"--\"No, sir,\" replied the lady, \"it is I that have _dropt it_.\"           LX.--ALONE IN HIS GLORY.  A FACETIOUS fellow having unwittingly offended a conceited puppy, the latter told him he was no \"gentleman.\"--\"Are _you_ a gentleman?\" asked the droll one. \"Yes, sir,\" bounced the fop. \"Then, I am very glad _I am not_,\" replied the other.           LXI.--A CAPITAL LETTER.  DR. LLOYD, Bishop of Worcester, so eminent for his prophecies, when by his solicitations and compliance at court he got removed from a poor Welsh bishopric to a rich English one, a reverend dean of the Church said, that he found his brother Lloyd spelt _Prophet_ with an F.           LXII.--A GOOD PARSON.  DR. HICKRINGAL, who was one of King Charles the Second's chaplains, whenever he preached before his Majesty, was sure to tell him of his faults from the pulpit. One day his Majesty met the doctor in the Mall, and said to him, \"Doctor, what have I done to you that you are always quarrelling with me?\"--\"I hope your Majesty is not angry with me,\" quoth the doctor, \"for telling the truth.\"--\"No, no,\" says the king, \"but I would have us for the future be friends.\"--\"Well, well,\" quoth the doctor, \"I will make it up with your Majesty on these terms,--as _you mend I'll mend_.\"           LXIII.--SUBTRACTION AND ADDITION.  A CHIMNEY-SWEEPER'S boy went into a baker's shop for a twopenny loaf, and conceiving it to be diminutive in size, remarked to the baker that he did not believe it was weight. \"Never mind that,\" said the man of dough, \"you will have _the less to carry_.\"--\"True,\" replied the lad, and throwing three half-pence on the counter"]]]
