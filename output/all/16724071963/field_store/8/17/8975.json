ZENO.--The third head of the Eleatic school was ZENO.  He is described by Plato in the _Parmenides_ as accompanying his master to Athens on the visit already referred to (see above, p. 34), and as being then \"nearly forty years of age, of a noble figure and fair aspect.\"  In personal character he was a worthy pupil of his master, being, like him, a devoted patriot.  He is even said to have fallen a victim to his patriotism, and to have suffered bravely the extremest tortures at the hands of a tyrant Nearchus rather than betray his country.  His philosophic position was a very simple one.  He had nothing to add to or to vary in the doctrine of Parmenides.  His function was primarily that of an expositor and defender of that doctrine, and his particular pre-eminence consists in the ingenuity of his dialectic resources of defence.  He is in fact pronounced by Aristotle to have been the inventor of dialectic or systematic logic.  The relation of {43} the two is humorously expressed thus by Plato (Jowett, _Plato_, vol. iv. p. 128); \"I see, Parmenides, said Socrates, that Zeno is your second self in his writings too; he puts what you say in another way, and would fain deceive us into believing that he is telling us what is new.  For you, in your poems, say, All is one, and of this you adduce excellent proofs; and he, on the other hand, says, There is no many; and on behalf of this he offers overwhelming evidence.\"  To this Zeno replies, admitting the fact, and adds: \"These writings of mine were meant to protect the arguments of Parmenides against those who scoff at him, and show the many ridiculous and contradictory results which they suppose to follow from the affirmation of the One.  My answer is an address to the partisans of the many, whose attack I return with interest by retorting upon them that their hypothesis of the being of many if carried out appears in a still more ridiculous light than the hypothesis of the being of one.\"  The arguments of Zeno may therefore be regarded as strictly arguments _in kind_; quibbles if you please, but in answer to quibbles.  The secret of his method was what Aristotle calls Dichotomy--that is, he put side by side two contradictory propositions with respect to any particular supposed real thing in experience, and then proceeded to show that both these contradictories alike imply what is {44} [105] inconceivable.  Thus \"a thing must consist either of a finite number of parts or an infinite number.\"  Assume the number of parts to be finite. Between them there must either be something or nothing.  If there is something between them, then the whole consists of more parts than it consists of.  If there is nothing between them, then they are not separated, therefore they are not parts; therefore the whole has no parts at all; therefore it is nothing.  If, on the other hand, the number of parts is infinite, then, the same kind of argument being applied, the magnitude of the whole is by infinite successive positing of intervening parts shown to be infinite; therefore this one thing, being infinitely large, is everything.  [107]  Take, again, any supposed fact, as that an arrow moves.  An arrow cannot move except in space.  It cannot move in space without being in space.  At any moment of its supposed motion it must be in a particular space.  Being in that space, it must at the time during which it is in it be at rest.  But the total time of its supposed motion is made up of the moments composing that time, and to each of these moments the same argument applies; therefore either the arrow never was anywhere, or it always was at rest.  Or, again, take objects moving at unequal rates, as Achilles and a tortoise.  Let the tortoise have a start of any given length, then Achilles, however {45} much he excel in speed, will never overtake the tortoise.  For, while Achilles has passed over the originally intervening space, the tortoise will have passed over a certain space, and when Achilles has passed over this second space the tortoise will have again passed over some space, and so on _ad infinitum_; therefore in an infinite time there must always be a space, though infinitely diminishing, between the tortoise and Achilles, _i.e._ the tortoise must always be at least a little in front.  These will be sufficient to show the kind of arguments employed by Zeno.  In themselves they are of no utility, and Zeno never pretended that they had any.  But as against those who denied that existence as such was a datum independent of experience, something different from a mere sum of isolated things, his arguments were not only effective, but substantial.  The whole modern sensational or experiential school, who derive our 'abstract ideas,' as they are called, from 'phenomena' or 'sensation,' manifest the same impatience of any analysis of what they mean by phenomena or sensation, as no doubt Zeno's opponents manifested of his analyses.  As in criticising the one, modern critics are ready with their answer that Zeno's quibbles are simply \"a play of words on the well-known properties of infinities,\" so they are quick to tell us that sensation is an \"affection of the sentient organism\"; ignoring in {46} the first case the prior question where the idea of infinity came from, and in the second, where the idea of a sentient organism came from.  Indirectly, as we shall see, Zeno had a great effect on subsequent philosophies by the development of a process of ingenious verbal distinction, which in the hands of so-called sophists and others became a weapon of considerable, if temporary, power.  [109]  IV. MELISSUS.--The fourth and last of the Eleatic philosophers was Melissus, a native of Samos.  His date may be fixed as about 440 B.C. He took an active part in the politics of his native country, and on one occasion was commander of the Samian fleet in a victorious engagement with the Athenians, when Samos was being besieged by Pericles.  He belongs to the Eleatic school in respect of doctrine and method, but we have no evidence of his ever having resided at Elea, nor any reference to his connection with the philosophers there, except the statement that he was a pupil of Parmenides.  He developed very fully what is technically called in the science of Logic [110] the _Dilemma_. Thus, for example, he begins his treatise _On Existence_ or _On Nature_ thus: \"If nothing exists, then there is nothing for us to talk about. But if there is such a thing as existence it must either come into being or be ever-existing.  If it come into being, it must come from the existing or the non-existing.  Now that anything which exists, {47} above all, that which is absolutely existent, should come from what is not, is impossible.  Nor can it come from that which is.  For then it would be already, and would not come into being.  That which exists, therefore, comes not into being; it must therefore be ever-existing.\"  [111]  By similar treatment of other conceivable alternatives he proceeds to show that as the existent had no beginning so it can have no ending in time.  From this, by a curious transition which Aristotle quotes as an example of loose reasoning, he concludes that the existent can have no limit in space [112] either.  As being thus unlimited it must be one, therefore immovable (there being nothing else into which it can move or change), and therefore always self-identical in extent and character. It cannot, therefore, have any body, for body has parts and is not therefore one.  [113]  Being incapable of change one might perhaps conclude that the absolutely existing being is incapable of any mental activity or consciousness.  We have no authority for assuming that Melissus came to this conclusion; but there is a curious remark of Aristotle's respecting this and previous philosophers of the school which certain critics have [114] made to bear some such interpretation.  He says: \"Parmenides seems to hold by a Unity in thought, Melissus by a Material unity.  Hence the first {48} defined the One as limited, the second declared it to be unlimited.  Xenophanes made no clear statement on this question; he simply, gazing up to the arch of heaven, declared, The One is God.\"  But the difference between Melissus and his master can hardly be said to be a difference of doctrine; point for point, they are identical. The difference is a difference of vision or mental picture as to this mighty All which is One.  Melissus, so to speak, places himself at the centre of this Universal being, and sees it stretching out infinitely, unendingly, in space and in time.  Its oneness comes to him as the _sum_ of these infinities.  Parmenides, on the other hand, sees all these endless immensities as related to a centre; he, so to speak, enfolds them all in the grasp of his unifying thought, and as thus equally and necessarily related to a central unity he pronounces the All a sphere, and therefore limited.  The two doctrines, antithetical in terms, are identical in fact.  The absolutely unlimited and the absolutely self-limited are only two ways of saying the same thing.  This difference of view or vision Aristotle in the passage quoted expresses as a difference between _thought_ ((Greek) _logos_) and _matter_ ((Greek) _hule_).  This is just a form of his own radical distinction between Essence and Difference, Form and Matter, of which much will be said later on.  It is like the difference {49} between Deduction and Induction; in the first you start from the universal and see within it the particulars; in the second you start from the particulars and gather them into completeness and reality in a universal.  The substance remains the same, only the point of view is different.  To put the matter in modern mathematical form, one might say, The universe is to be conceived as a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20500"],["title","A Short History of Greek Philosophy (#7)"],["body","(Parmenides) of _infinite radius_ (Melissus).  Aristotle is not blaming Melissus or praising Parmenides.  As for Xenophanes, Aristotle after his manner finds in him the potentiality of both.  He is prior both to the process of thought from universal to particular, and to that from particular to universal.  He does not argue at all; his function is Intuition.  \"He looks out on the mighty sky, and says, The One is God.\"  Melissus applied the results of his analysis in an interesting way to the question already raised by his predecessors, of the trustworthiness of sensation.  His argument is as follows: \"If there were many real existences, to each of them the same reasonings must apply as I have already used with reference to the one existence.  That is to say, if earth really exists, and water and air and iron and gold and fire and things living and things dead; and black and white, and all the various things whose reality men ordinarily assume,--if all these really exist, and our sight and our hearing give us _facts_, then each of these as {50} really existing must be what we concluded the one existence must be; among other things, each must be unchangeable, and can never become other than it really is.  But assuming that sight and hearing and apprehension are true, we find the cold becoming hot and the hot becoming cold; the hard changes to soft, the soft to hard; the living thing dies; and from that which is not living, a living thing comes into being; in short, everything changes, and what now is in no way resembles what was.  It follows therefore that we neither see nor apprehend realities.  \"In fact we cannot pay the slightest regard to experience without being landed in self-contradictions.  We assume that there are all sorts of really existing things, having a permanence both of form and power, and yet we imagine these very things altering and changing according to what we from time to time see about them.  If they were realities as we first perceived them, our sight must now be wrong.  For if they were real, they could not change.  Nothing can be stronger than reality. Whereas to suppose it changed, we must affirm that the real has ceased to be, and that that which was not has displaced it.\"  To Melissus therefore, as to his predecessors, the world of sense was a world of illusion; the very first principles or assumptions of which, as of the truthfulness of the senses and the reality of the various objects which we see, are unthinkable and absurd.  {51}  The weakness as well as the strength of the Eleatic position consisted in its purely negative and critical attitude.  The assumptions of ordinary life and experience could not stand for a moment when assailed in detail by their subtle analysis.  So-called facts were like a world of ghosts, which the sword of truth passed through without resistance. But somehow the sword might pierce them through and through, and show by all manner of arguments their unsubstantiality, but there they were still thronging about the philosopher and refusing to be gone.  The world of sense might be only illusion, but there the illusion was.  You could not lay it or exorcise it by calling it illusion or opinion. What was this opinion?  What was the nature of its subject matter?  How did it operate?  And if its results were not true or real, what was their nature?  These were questions which still remained when the analysis of the idea of absolute existence had been pushed to its completion.  These were the questions which the next school of philosophy attempted to answer.  After the Idealists, the Realists; after the philosophy of mind, the philosophy of matter.     {52}  CHAPTER VI  THE ATOMISTS  _Anaxagoras and the cosmos--Mind in nature--The seeds of existence_   [129]  I. ANAXAGORAS.--Anaxagoras was born at Clazomenae, a city of Ionia, about the year 500 B.C.  At the age of twenty he removed to Athens, of which city Clazomenae was for some time a dependency.  This step on his part may have been connected with the circumstances attending the great invasion of Greece by Xerxes in the year 480.  For Xerxes drew a large contingent of his army from the Ionian cities which he had subdued, and many who were unwilling to serve against their mother-country may have taken refuge about that time in Athens.  At Athens he resided for nearly fifty years, and during that period became the friend and teacher of many eminent men, among the rest of Pericles, the great Athenian [118] statesman, and of Euripides, the dramatist.  Like most of the Ionian philosophers he had a taste for mathematics and astronomy, as well as for certain practical applications of mathematics.  Among other books he is said to have written a treatise on the art {53} of scene-designing for the stage, possibly to oblige his friend and pupil Euripides.  In his case, as in that of his predecessors, only fragments of his philosophic writings have been preserved, and the connection of certain portions of his teaching as they have come down to us remains somewhat uncertain.  [119]  With respect to the constitution of the universe we have the following: \"Origination and destruction are phrases which are generally misunderstood among the Greeks.  Nothing really is originated or destroyed; the only processes which actually take place are combination and separation of elements already existing.  [120] These elements we are to conceive as having been in a state of chaos at first, infinite in number and infinitely small, forming in their immobility a confused and characterless unity.  About this chaos was spread the air and aether, infinite also in the multitude of their particles, and infinitely extended.  Before separation commenced there was no clear colour or appearance in anything, whether of moist or dry, of hot or cold, of bright or dark, but only an infinite number of the seeds of things, having concealed in them all manner of forms and colours and savours.\"  There is a curious resemblance in this to the opening verses of Genesis, \"The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.\"  Nor is the next step in his philosophy without its resemblance to that in the Biblical record.  [122] As summarised by Diogenes Laertius it takes this form, \"All things were as one: then cometh Mind, and by division brought all things into order.\"  [121] \"Conceiving,\" as Aristotle puts it, \"that the original elements of things had no power to generate or develop out of themselves things as they exist, philosophers were forced by the facts themselves to seek the immediate cause of this development.  They were unable to believe that fire, or earth, or any such principle was adequate to account for the order and beauty visible in the frame of things; nor did they think it possible to attribute these to mere innate necessity or chance. _One_ (Anaxagoras) observing how in living creatures Mind is the ordering force, declared that in nature also this must be the cause of order and beauty, and in so declaring he seemed, when compared with those before him, as one sober amidst a crowd of babblers.\"  [122]  Elsewhere, however, Aristotle modifies this commendation. \"Anaxagoras,\" he says, \"uses Mind only as a kind of last resort, dragging it in when he fails otherwise to account for a phenomenon, but never thinking of it else.\"  And in the _Phaedo_ Plato makes Socrates speak of the high hopes with which he had taken to the works of Anaxagoras, and how grievously he had been disappointed.  \"As I proceeded,\" he says, \"I found my philosopher altogether forsaking Mind or any other principle of order, and having {55} recourse to air, and aether, and water, and other eccentricities.\"  Anaxagoras, then, at least on this side of his teaching, must be considered rather as the author of a phrase than as the founder of a philosophy.  The phrase remained, and had a profound influence on subsequent philosophies, but in his own hands it was little more than a dead letter.  His immediate interest was rather in the variety of phenomena than in their conceived principle of unity; he is theoretically, perhaps, 'on the side of the angels,' in practice he is a materialist.  [12]  Mind he conceived as something apart, sitting throned like Zeus upon the heights, giving doubtless the first impulse to the movement of things, but leaving them for the rest to their own inherent tendencies. As distinguished from them it was, he conceived, the one thing which was absolutely pure and unmixed.  All things else had intermixture with every other, the mixtures increasing in complexity towards the centre of things.  On the outmost verge were distributed the finest and least complex forms of things--the sun, the moon, the stars; the more dense gathering together, to form as it were in the centre of the vortex, the earth and its manifold existences.  By the intermixture of air and earth and water, containing in themselves the infinitely varied seeds of things, plants and animals were {56} developed.  The seeds themselves are too minute to be apprehended by the senses, but we can divine their character by the various characters of the visible things themselves, each of these having a necessary correspondence with the nature of the seeds from which they respectively were formed.  [128]  Thus for a true apprehension of things sensation and reason are both necessary--sensation to certify to the apparent characters of objects, reason to pass from these to the nature of the invisible seeds or atoms which cause those characters.  Taken by themselves our sensations are false, inasmuch as they give us only combined impressions, yet they are a necessary stage towards the truth, as providing the materials which reason must separate into their real elements.  From this brief summary we may gather that Mind was conceived, so to speak, as placed at the _beginning_ of existence, inasmuch as it is the first originator of the vortex motions of the atoms or seeds of"]]]
