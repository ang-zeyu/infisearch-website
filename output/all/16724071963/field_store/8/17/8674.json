The original work contained a few phrases or lines of Greek text. These are shown here as UTF characters followed by a Beta-code transliteration, for example: Οῖμοι [Greek: Oi~moi].  The original text also contains two characters not supported by UTF. In note [463], [=N] and [=S] represent letters N and S with a bar above. In a few places superscript letters are shown by carets: May 27^th^.  An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes indexed with letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) show variant forms of Byron's text from manuscripts and other sources. Footnotes indexed with arabic numbers (e.g. [17], [221]) are informational. Text in notes and elsewhere in square brackets is the work of editor E. H. Coleridge. Text not in brackets is by Byron himself.  In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In this etext, footnotes have been collected at the ends of each major section, and have been consecutively numbered throughout. Within each block of footnotes are numbers in braces: {321}. These represent the page number on which following notes originally appeared. To find a note that was originally printed on page 27, search for {27}.  In the work \"Francesca di Rimini\" the original printed lines of the Italian on facing pages opposite the matching lines of Byron's translation. In this etext, the lines of the Italian original have been collected following the translation.  Two minor corrections were made in this etext, both in the note following the title of MANFRED: the year 1348 was corrected to 1834, and the word \"Tschairowsky\" was corrected to \"Tschaikowsky.\"                                      THE WORKS                                      OF                                 LORD BYRON.

EDITED BY                ERNEST HARTLEY COLERIDGE, M.A., HON. F.R.S.L.                                      LONDON:                         JOHN MURRAY, ALBEMARLE STREET.                       NEW YORK: CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS.                                     1901                           PREFACE TO THE FOURTH VOLUME.   The poems included in this volume consist of thirteen longer or more important works, written at various periods between June, 1816, and October, 1821; of eight occasional pieces (_Poems of July-September_, 1816), written in 1816; and of another collection of occasional pieces (_Poems_ 1816-1823), written at intervals between November, 1816, and September, 1823. Of this second group of minor poems five are now printed and published for the first time.  The volume is not co-extensive with the work of the period. The third and fourth cantos of _Childe Harold_ (1816-1817), the first five cantos of _Don Juan_ (1818, 1819, 1820), _Sardanapalus_, _The Two Foscari_, _Cain_, and _Heaven and Earth_ (1821), form parts of other volumes, but, in spite of these notable exceptions, the fourth volume contains the work of the poet's maturity, which is and must ever remain famous. Byron was not content to write on one kind of subject, or to confine himself to one branch or species of poetry. He tracked the footsteps now of this master poet, now of another, far outstripping some of his models; soon spent in the pursuit of others. Even in his own lifetime, and in the heyday of his fame, his friendliest critics, who applauded him to the echo, perceived that the \"manifold motions\" of his versatile and unsleeping talent were not always sanctioned or blessed by his genius. Hence the unevenness of his work, the different values of this or that poem. But, even so, in width of compass, in variety of style, and in measure of success, his achievement was unparalleled. Take such poems as _Manfred_ or _Mazeppa_, which have left their mark on the literature of Europe; as _Beppo_, the _avant courrier_ of _Don Juan_, or the \"inimitable\" _Vision of Judgment_, which the \"hungry generations\" have not trodden down or despoiled of its freshness. Not one of these poems suggests or resembles the other, but each has its crowd of associations, a history and almost a literature of its own.  The whole of this volume was written on foreign soil, in Switzerland or Italy, and, putting aside _The Dream_, _The Monody on the Death of Sheridan_, _The Irish Avatar_, and _The Blues_, the places, the persons and events, the _matériel_ of the volume as a whole, to say nothing of the style and metre of the poems, are derived from the history and the literature of Switzerland and Southern Europe. An unwilling, at times a vindictive exile, he did more than any other poet or writer of his age to familiarize his own countrymen with the scenery, the art and letters of the Continent, and, conversely, to make the existence of English literature, or, at least, the writings of one Englishman, known to Frenchmen and Italians; to the Teuton and the Slav. If he \"taught us little\" as prophet or moralist; as a guide to knowledge; as an educator of the general reader--\"your British blackguard,\" as he was pleased to call him--his teaching and influence were \"in widest commonalty spread.\"  Questions with regard to his personality, his morals, his theological opinions, his qualifications as an artist, his grammar, his technique, and so forth, have, perhaps inevitably, absorbed the attention of friend and foe, and the one point on which all might agree has been overlooked, namely, the fact that he taught us a great deal which it is desirable and agreeable to know--which has passed into common knowledge through the medium of his poetry. It is true that he wrote his plays and poems at lightning speed, and that if he was at pains to correct some obvious blunders, he expended but little labour on picking his phrases or polishing his lines; but it is also true that he read widely and studied diligently, in order to prepare himself for an outpouring of verse, and that so far from being a superficial observer or inaccurate recorder, his authority is worth quoting in questions of fact and points of detail.  The appreciation of poetry is a matter of taste, and still more of temperament. Readers cannot be coerced into admiration, or scolded into disapproval and contempt. But if they are willing or can be persuaded to read with some particularity and attention the writings of the illustrious dead, not entirely as partisans, or with the view to dethroning other \"Monarchs of Parnassus,\" they will divine the secret of their fame, and will understand, perhaps recover, the \"first rapture\" of contemporaries.  Byron sneered and carped at Southey as a \"scribbler of all works.\" He was himself a reader of all works, and without some measure of book-learning and not a little research the force and significance of his various numbers are weakened or obliterated.  It is with the hope of supplying this modicum of book-learning that the Introductions and notes in this and other volumes have been compiled.  I desire to acknowledge, with thanks, the courteous response of Mons. J. Capré, Commandant of the Castle of Chillon, to a letter of inquiry with regard to the \"Souterrains de Chillon.\"  I have to express my gratitude to Sir Henry Irving, to Mr. Joseph Knight, and to Mr. F. E. Taylor, for valuable information concerning the stage representation of _Manfred_ and _Marino Faliero_.  I am deeply indebted to Dr. Richard Garnett, C.B., and to my friend, Mr. Thomas Hutchinson, for assistance in many important particulars during the construction of the volume.  I must also record my thanks to Mr. Oscar Browning, Mr. Josceline Courtenay, and other correspondents, for information and assistance in points of difficulty.  I have consulted and derived valuable information from the following works: _The Prisoner of Chillon_, etc., by the late Professor Kölbing; _Mazeppa_, by Dr. Englaender; _Marino Faliero avanti il Dogado_ and _La Congiura_ (published in the _Nuovo Archivio Veneto_), by Signor Vittorio Lazzarino; and _Selections from the Poetry of Lord Byron_, by Dr. F. I. Carpenter of Chicago, U.S.A.  I take the opportunity of expressing my acknowledgments to Miss K. Schlesinger, Miss De Alberti, and to Signor F. Bianco, for their able and zealous services in the preparation of portions of the volume.  On behalf of the publisher I beg to acknowledge the kindness of Captain the Hon. F. L. King Noel, in sanctioning the examination and collation of the MS. of _Beppo_, now in his possession; and of Mrs. Horace Pym of Foxwold Chace, for permitting the portrait of Sheridan by Sir Joshua Reynolds to be reproduced for this volume.

THE PRISONER OF CHILLON                     INTRODUCTION TO _THE PRISONER OF CHILLON_.   The _Prisoner of Chillon_, says Moore (_Life_, p. 320), was written at Ouchy, near Lausanne, where Byron and Shelley \"were detained two days in a small inn [Hôtel de l'Ancre, now d'Angleterre] by the weather.\" Byron's letter to Murray, dated June 27 (but? 28), 1816, does not precisely tally with Shelley's journal contained in a letter to Peacock, July 12, 1816 (_Prose Works of P. B. Shelley_, 1880, ii. 171, _sq._); but, if Shelley's first date, June 23, is correct, it follows that the two poets visited the Castle of Chillon on Wednesday, June 26, reached Ouchy on Thursday, June 27, and began their homeward voyage on Saturday, June 29 (Shelley misdates it June 30). On this reckoning the _Prisoner of Chillon_ was begun and finished between Thursday, June 27, and Saturday, June 29, 1816. Whenever or wherever begun, it was completed by July 10 (see _Memoir of John Murray_, 1891, i. 364), and was ready for transmission to England by July 25. The MS., in Claire's handwriting, was placed in Murray's hands on October 11, and the poem, with seven others, was published December 5, 1816.  In a final note to the _Prisoner of Chillon_ (First Edition, 1816, p. 59), Byron confesses that when \"the foregoing poem was composed he knew too little of the history of Bonnivard to do justice to his courage and virtues,\" and appends as a note to the \"Sonnet on Chillon,\" \"some account of his life ... furnished by the kindness of a citizen of that Republic,\" i.e. Geneva. The note, which is now entitled \"Advertisement,\" is taken bodily from the pages of a work published in 1786 by the Swiss naturalist, Jean Senebier, who died in 1809. It was not Byron's way to invent imaginary authorities, but rather to give his references with some pride and particularity, and it is possible that this unacknowledged and hitherto unverified \"account\" was supplied by some literary acquaintance, who failed to explain that his information was common property. Be that as it may, Senebier's prose is in some respects as unhistorical as Byron's verse, and stands in need of some corrections and additions.  François Bonivard (there is no contemporary authority for \"Bonnivard\") was born in 1493. In early youth (1510) he became by inheritance Prior of St. Victor, a monastery outside the walls of Geneva, and on reaching manhood (1514) he accepted the office and the benefice, \"la dignité ecclésiastique de Prieur et de la Seigneurie temporelle de St. Victor.\" A lover of independence, a child of the later Renaissance, in a word, a Genevese, he threw in his lot with a band of ardent reformers and patriots, who were conspiring to shake off the yoke of Duke Charles III. of Savoy, and convert the city into a republic. Here is his own testimony: \"Dès que j'eus commencé de lire l'histoire des nations, je me sentis entrainé par un goût prononcé pour les Républiques dont j'épousai toujours les intérêts.\" Hence, in a great measure, the unrelenting enmity of the duke, who not only ousted him from his priory, but caused him to be shut up for two years at Grolée, Gex, and Belley, and again, after he had been liberated on a second occasion, ordered him, a safe conduct notwithstanding, to be seized and confined in the Castle of Chillon. Here he remained from 1530 to February 1, 1536, when he was released by the Bernese.  For the first two years he was lodged in a room near the governor's quarters, and was fairly comfortable; but a day came when the duke paid a visit to Chillon; and \"then,\" he writes, \"the captain thrust me into a cell lower than the lake, where I lived four years.
