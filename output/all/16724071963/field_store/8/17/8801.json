THE KUAHU              In every halau stood the _kuahu_, or altar, as the visible            temporary abode of the deity, whose presence was at once the            inspiration of the performance and the luck-bringer of the            enterprise—a rustic frame embowered in greenery. The            gathering of the green leaves and other sweet finery of [Page 16]  nature for its construction and decoration was a matter of so            great importance that it could not be intrusted to any chance            assemblage of wild youth who might see fit to take the work            in hand. There were formalities that must be observed, songs            to be chanted, prayers to be recited. It was necessary to            bear in mind that when one deflowered the woods of their            fronds of _íe-íe_ and fern or tore the trailing lengths of            _maile_—albeit in honor of Laka herself—the body of the            goddess was being despoiled, and the despoiling must be done            with all tactful grace and etiquette.             It must not be gathered from this that the occasion was made            solemn and oppressive with weight of ceremony, as when a            temple was erected or as when a tabu chief walked abroad, and            all men lay with their mouths in the dust. On the contrary,            it was a time of joy and decorous exultation, a time when in            prayer-songs and ascriptions of praise the poet ransacked all            nature for figures and allusions to be used in caressing the            deity.             The following adulatory prayer (_kánaenáe_) in adoration of            Laka was recited while gathering the woodland decorations for            the altar. It is worthy of preservation for its intrinsic            beauty, for the spirit of trustfulness it breathes. We remark            the petitions it utters for the growth of tree and shrub, as            if Laka had been the alma mater under whose influence all            nature budded and rejoiced.             It would seem as if the physical ecstasy of the dance and the            sensuous joy of all nature’s finery had breathed their spirit            into the aspiration and that the beauty of leaf and flower,            all of them familiar forms of the god’s            metamorphosis—accessible to their touch and for the            regalement of their senses—had brought such nearness and            dearness, of affection between goddess and worshiper that all            fear was removed.                  _He kánaenáe no Laka_                  A ke kua-hiwi, i ke kua-lono,                 Ku ana o Laka i ka mauna;                 Noho ana o Laka i ke po’o o ka ohu.                 O Laka kumu hula,            5    Nana i a’e ka wao-kele,[3]                 Kahi, kahi i moli’a i ka pua’a,                 I ke po’o pua’a,                 He pua’a hiwa na Kane.[4] [Page 17]       He kane na Laka,             10  Na ka wahine i oni a kelakela i ka lani:                 I kupu ke a’a i ke kumu,                 I lau a puka ka mu’o,                 Ka liko, ka ao i-luna.

Nou okoa Kukulu o Kahiki.[13]                 Me ke ano-ai[14] i aloha, e!                 E ola, e!             [Footnote 3: _Wao-kele_. That portion of the mountain forest            where grew the monarch trees was called _wao-kele_ or            _wao-maukele_.]             [Footnote 4: _Na Kane_. Why was the offering, the black roast            porkling, said to be for Kane, who was not a special patron,            _au-makúa_, of the hula? The only answer the author has been            able to obtain from any Hawaiian is that, though Kane was not            a god of the hula, he was a near relative. On reflection, the            author can see a propriety in devoting the reeking flesh of            the swine to god Kane, while to the sylvan deity, Lâkâ,            goddess of the peaceful hula, were devoted the rustic            offerings that were the embodiment of her charms. Her image,            or token—an uncarved block of wood—was set up in a            prominent part of the _kuahu_, and at the close of a            performance the wreaths that had been worn by the actors were            draped about the image. Thus viewed, there is a delicate            propriety and significance in such disposal of the pig.]             [Footnote 5: _Maka-li’i_ (Small eyes). The Pleiades; also the            period of six months, including the rainy season, that began            some time in October or November and was reckoned from the            date when the Pleiades appeared in the East at sunset.            _Maka-li’i_ was also the name of a month, by some reckoned as            the first month of the year.]             [Footnote 6: _Maka-léi_. The name of a famous mythological            tree which had the power of attracting fish. It did not            poison, but only bewitched or fascinated them. There were two            trees bearing this name, one a male, the other a female,            which both grew at a place in Hilo called Pali-uli. One of            these, the female, was, according to tradition, carried from            its root home to the fish ponds in Kailua, Oahu, for the            purpose of attracting fish to the neighboring waters. The            enterprise was eminently successful.]             [Footnote 7: _Po_. Literally night; the period in cosmogony            when darkness and chaos reigned, before the affairs on earth            had become settled under the rule of the gods. Here the word            is used to indicate a period of remote mythologic antiquity.            The use of the word _Po_ in the following verse reminds one            of the French adage, “La nuit porte conseil.”]             [Footnote 8: _Kokúa_. Another form for _kakúa_, to gird on            the _pa-ú_. (See _Pa-ú_ song, pp. 51–53.)]             [Footnote 9: _Uníki_. A word not given in the dictionary. The            debut of an actor at the hula, after passing the _ai-lolo_            test and graduating from the school of the halau, a critical            event.]             [Footnote 10: _Ha-íke-íke_. Equivalent to _ho-íke-íke_, an            exhibition, to exhibit.]             [Footnote 11: _Ou-alii_. The Hawaiians seem to have lost the            meaning of this word. The author has been at some pains to            work it out somewhat conjecturally.]             [Footnote 12: _E Lono, e hu’ ia, mai, etc_. The unelided form            of the word _hu’_ would be _hui_. The final _i_ is dropped            before the similar vowel of _ia_.]             [Footnote 13: _Kukúlu o Kahíki_. The pillars of Kahiki. The            ancient Hawaiians supposed the starry heavens to be a solid            dome supported by a wall or vertical            construction—_kukulu_—set up along the horizon. That            section of the wall that stood over against Kahiki they            termed _Kukulu o Kahiki_. Our geographical name Tahiti is of            course from Kahiki, though it does not apply to the same            region. After the close of what has been termed “the period            of intercourse,” which, came probably during the twelfth and            thirteenth centuries, and during which the ancient Hawaiians            voyaged to and fro between Hawaii and the lands of the South,            geographical ideas became hazy and the term _Kahiki_ came to            be applied to any foreign country.]             [Footnote 14: _Áno-ái_. An old form of salutation, answering            in general to the more modern word aloha, much used at the            present time. _Ano-ai_ seems to have had a shade of meaning            more nearly answering to our word “welcome.” This is the            first instance the author has met with of its use in poetry.]  [Page 18]                                 [Translation.]                     _A Prayer of Adulation to Laka_                  In the forests, on the ridges                 Of the mountains stands Laka;                 Dwelling in the source of the mists.                 Laka, mistress of the hula,             5   Has climbed the wooded haunts of the gods,                 Altars hallowed by the sacrificial swine,                 The head of the boar, the black boar of Kane.                 A partner he with Laka;                 Woman, she by strife gained rank in heaven.            10   That the root may grow from the stem,                 That the young shoot may put forth and leaf,                 Pushing up the fresh enfolded bud,                 The scion-thrust bud and fruit toward the East,                 Like the tree that bewitches the winter fish,            15   Maka-lei, tree famed from the age of night.                 Truth is the counsel of night—                 May it fruit and ripen above.                 A messenger I bring you, O Laka,                 To the girding of paû.            20   An opening festa this for thee and me;                 To show the might of the god,                 The power of the goddess,                 Of Laka, the sister,                 To Lono a wife in the heavenly courts.            25   O Lono, join heaven and earth!                 Thine alone are the pillars of Kahiki.

The cult of god Lono was milder, more humane, than that of            Kane and the other major gods. No human sacrifices were            offered on his altars.—The statement in verse 26 accords            with the general belief of the Hawaiians that Lono dwelt in            foreign parts, _Kukulu o Kahiki_, and that he would some time            come to them from across the waters. When Captain Cook            arrived in his ships, the Hawaiians worshiped him as the god            Lono.  [Illustration: IE-IE (FREYCINETIA ARNOTTI) LEAVES AND FRUIT]             The following song-prayer also is one that was used at the            gathering of the greenery in the mountains and during the            building of the altar in the halau. When recited in the halau            all the pupils took part, and the chorus was a response in            which the whole assembly in the halau were expected to join:                             _Pule Kuahu no Laka_                      Haki pu o ka nahelehele,                     Haki hana maile o ka wao, [Page 19]           Hooulu[15] lei ou, o Laka, e!

[Footnote 15: _Hoo-ulu_. This word has a considerable range of            meaning, well illustrated in this mele. In its simplest form,            _ulu_, it means to grow, to become strong. Joined with the            causative _hoo_, as here, it takes on the spiritual meaning            of causing to prosper, of inspiring. The word “collect,” used            in the translation, has been chosen to express the double            sense of gathering the garlands and of devoting them to the            goddess as a religious offering. In the fourth verse this            word, _hooulu_, is used in the sense of to heal. Compare note            _c_.]             [Footnote 16: _Hiiaka_. The youngest sister of Pele, often            spoken of as _Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele_,            Hiiaka-of-the-bosom-of-Pele. Why she should be spoken of as            capable of healing diseases is not at all clear.]             [Footnote 17: _Ulu_. Here we have the word _ulu_ in its            simple, uncombined form, meaning to enter into and inspire.]             The wildwoods of Hawaii furnished in great abundance and            variety small poles for the framework of the kuahu, the            altar, the holy place of the halau, and sweet-scented leaves            and flowers suitable for its decoration. A spirit of fitness,            however, limited choice among these to certain species that            were deemed acceptable to the goddess because they were            reckoned as among her favorite forms of metamorphosis. To go            outside this ordained and traditional range would have been            an offense, a sacrilege. This critical spirit would have            looked with the greatest disfavor on the practice that in            modern times has crept in, of bedecking the dancers with            garlands of roses, pinks, jessamine, and other nonindigenous            flowers, as being utterly repugnant to the traditional spirit            of the hula.             Among decorations approved and most highly esteemed stood            pre-eminent the fragrant maile (pl. IV) and the star-like            fronds and ruddy drupe of the _íe-íe_ (pl. II) and its            kindred, the _hála-pépe_ (pl. III); the scarlet pompons of            the _lehúa_ (pl. XIII) and _ohi’a_, with the fruit of the            latter (the mountain-apple); many varieties of fern,            including that splendid parasite, the “bird’s nest fern” [Page 20]  (_ekáha_), hailed by the Hawaiians as Mawi’s paddle; to which            must be added the commoner leaves and lemon-colored flowers            of the native hibiscus, the _hau_, the breadfruit, the native            banana and the dracæna (_ti_), plate V; and lastly, richest            of all, in the color that became Hawaii’s favorite, the royal            yellow _ilíma_ (pl. VI), a flower familiar to the eyes of the            tourist to Honolulu.             While deft hands are building and weaving the light framework            of the kuahu, binding its parts with strong vines and            decorating it with nature’s sumptuous embroidery, the _kumu_,            or teacher, under the inspiration of the deity, for whose            residence he has prepared himself by long vigil and fasting            with fleshly abstinence, having spent the previous night            alone in the halau, is chanting or cantillating his adulatory            prayers, _kanaenae_—songs of praise they seem to be—to the            glorification of the gods and goddesses who are invited to            bless the occasion with their presence and inspiration, but            especially of that one, Laka, whose bodily presence is            symbolized by a rude block of wood arrayed in yellow tapa            that is set up on the altar itself. Thus does the kumu sing:                       _Pule Kuahu_                  Ei’ au e Laka mai uka,                 E Laka mai kai;                 O hooulu                 O ka ilio[18] nana e hae,             5   O ka maile hihi i ka wao,                 O ka lau-ki[19] lei o ke akua,                 O na ku’i hauoli                 O Ha’i-ka-manawa.[20]                 O Laka oe,            10   O ke akua i ke kuahu nei, la;                 E ho’i, ho’i mai a noho i kou kuahu!

Thou art Laka,             10  The god of this altar;                 Return, return, abide in thy shrine!             [Footnote 18: _Ilio nana e hae_. The barking of a dog, the            crowing of a cock, the grunting of a pig, the hooting of an            owl, or any such sound occurring at the time of a religious            solemnity, _aha_, broke the spell of the incantation and            vitiated the ceremony. Such an untimely accident was as much            deprecated as were the Turk, the Comet, and the Devil by            pious Christian souls during the Middle Ages.]             [Footnote 19: _Lau-ki_. The leaf of the _ti_ plant—the            same as the _ki_—(Dracæna terminalis), much used as an emblem            of divine power, a charm or defense against malign spiritual            influences. The kahuna often wore about his neck a fillet of            this leaf. The _ti_ leaf was a special emblem of Ha’i-wahine,            or of Li’a-wahine. It was much used as a decoration about the            halau.]             [Footnote 20: _Ha’i-ka-manawa_. It is conjectured that this is            the same as Ha’i-wahine. She was a mythological character,            about whom there is a long and tragic story.]             The prayers which the hula folk of old times chanted while            gathering the material in the woods or while weaving it into            shape in the halau for the construction of a shrine did not            form a rigid liturgy; they formed rather a repertory as            elastic as the sighing of the breeze, or the songs of the            birds whose notes embroidered the pure mountain air. There            were many altar-prayers, so that if a prayer came to an end            before the work was done the priest had but to begin the            recitation of another prayer, or, if the spirit of the            occasion so moved him, he would take up again a prayer            already repeated, for until the work was entirely            accomplished the voice of prayer must continue to be heard.             The _pule_ now to be given seems to be specially suited to            that portion of the service which took place in the woods at            the gathering of the poles and greenery. It was designed            specially for the placating of the little god-folk who from            their number were addressed as _Kini o ke Akua_, the            multitude of the little gods, and who were the counterparts            in old Hawaii of our brownies, elfins, sprites, kobolds,            gnomes, and other woodland imps. These creatures, though            dwarfish and insignificant in person, were in such            numbers—four thousand, forty thousand, four hundred            thousand—and were so impatient of any invasion of their            territory, so jealous of their prerogatives, so spiteful and            revengeful when injured, that it was policy always to keep on            the right side of them.                        _Pule Kuahu_                  E hooulu ana I Kini[21] o ke Akua,                 Ka lehu o ke Akua,                 Ka mano o ke Akua,                 I ka pu-ku’i o ke Akua, "]]]
