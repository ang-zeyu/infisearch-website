But in the fiendish ingenuity of his vengeance on her, the helpless, loving woman, I thought Raoul de Bezers stood alone.  Alas!  it fares ill with the butterfly when the cat has struck it down.  Ill indeed!  Madame Claude rose and put her arms round the girl, dismissing me by a gesture.  I went out, passing through two or three scared servants, and made at once for the terrace.  I felt as if I could only breathe there. I found Marie and St. Croix together, silent, the marks of tears on their faces.  Our eyes met and they told one tale.  We all spoke at the same time.  \"When?\"  we said.  But the others looked to me for an answer.  I was somewhat sobered by that, and paused to consider before I replied.  \"At daybreak to-morrow,\" I decided presently.  \"It is an hour after noon already.  We want money, and the horses are out.  It will take an hour to bring them in.  After that we might still reach Cahors to-night, perhaps; but more haste less speed you know.  At daybreak to-morrow we will start.\"  They nodded assent.  It was a great thing we meditated.  No less than to go to Paris--the unknown city so far beyond the hills--and seek out M. de Pavannes, and warn him.  It would be a race between the Vidame and ourselves; a race for the life of Kit's suitor.  Could we reach Paris first, or even within twenty-four hours of Bezers' arrival, we should in all probability be in time, and be able to put Pavannes on his guard.  It had been the first thought of all of us, to take such men as we could get together and fall upon Bezers wherever we found him, making it our simple object to kill him.  But the lackeys M. le Vicomte had left with us, the times being peaceful and the neighbours friendly, were poor-spirited fellows.  Bezers' handful, on the contrary, were reckless Swiss riders--like master, like men.  We decided that it would be wiser simply to warn Pavannes, and then stand by him if necessary.  We might have despatched a messenger.  But our servants--Gil excepted, and he was too old to bear the journey--were ignorant of Paris.  Nor could any one of them be trusted with a mission so delicate.  We thought of Pavannes' courier indeed.  But he was a Rochellois, and a stranger to the capital.  There was nothing for it but to go ourselves.  Yet we did not determine on this adventure with light hearts, I remember.  Paris loomed big and awesome in the eyes of all of us. The glamour of the court rather frightened than allured us.  We felt that shrinking from contact with the world which a country life engenders, as well as that dread of seeming unlike other people which is peculiar to youth.  It was a great plunge, and a dangerous which we meditated. And we trembled.  If we had known more--especially of the future--we should have trembled more.  But we were young, and with our fears mingled a delicious excitement. We were going on an adventure of knight errantry in which we might win our spurs.  We were going to see the world and play men's parts in it! to save a friend and make our mistress happy!  We gave our orders.  But we said nothing to Catherine or Madame Claude; merely bidding Gil tell them after our departure.  We arranged for the immediate despatch of a message to the Vicomte at Bayonne, and charged Gil until he should hear from him to keep the gates closed, and look well to the shoot of the kitchen midden.  Then, when all was ready, we went to our pallets, but it was with hearts throbbing with excitement and wakeful eyes.  \"Anne!  Anne!\"  said Croisette, rising on his elbow and speaking to me some three hours later, \"what do you think the Vidame meant this morning when he said that about the ten days?\"  \"What about the ten days?\"  I asked peevishly.  He had roused me just when I was at last falling asleep.  \"About the world seeing that his was the true faith--in ten days?\"  \"I am sure I do not know.  For goodness' sake let us go to sleep,\" I replied.  For I had no patience with Croisette, talking such nonsense, when we had our own business to think about.    CHAPTER III.  THE ROAD TO PARIS.  The sun had not yet risen above the hills when we three with a single servant behind us drew rein at the end of the valley; and easing our horses on the ascent, turned in the saddle to take a last look at Caylus--at the huddled grey town, and the towers above it.  A little thoughtful we all were, I think.  The times were rough and our errand was serious.  But youth and early morning are fine dispellers of care; and once on the uplands we trotted gaily forward, now passing through wide glades in the sparse oak forest, where the trees all leaned one way, now over bare, wind-swept downs; or once and again descending into a chalky bottom, where the stream bubbled through deep beds of fern, and a lonely farmhouse nestled amid orchards.  Four hours' riding, and we saw below us Cahors, filling the bend of the river.  We cantered over the Vallandre Bridge, which there crosses the Lot, and so to my uncle's house of call in the square.  Here we ordered breakfast, and announced with pride that we were going to Paris.  Our host raised his hands.  \"Now there!\"  he exclaimed, regret in his voice.  \"And if you had arrived yesterday you could have travelled up with the Vidame de Bezers!  And you a small party--saving your lordships' presence--and the roads but so-so!\"  \"But the Vidame was riding with only half-a-dozen attendants also!\"  I answered, flicking my boot in a careless way.  The landlord shook his head.  \"Ah, M. le Vidame knows the world!\" he answered shrewdly.  \"He is not to be taken off his guard, not he!  One of his men whispered me that twenty staunch fellows would join him at Chateauroux.  They say the wars are over, but\"--and the good man, shrugging his shoulders, cast an expressive glance at some fine flitches of bacon which were hanging in his chimney. \"However, your lordships know better than I do,\" he added briskly.  \"I am a poor man. I only wish to live at peace with my neighbours, whether they go to mass or sermon.\"  This was a sentiment so common in those days and so heartily echoed by most men of substance both in town and country, that we did not stay to assent to it; but having received from the worthy fellow a token which would insure our obtaining fresh cattle at Limoges, we took to the road again, refreshed in body, and with some food for thought.  Five-and-twenty attendants were more than even such a man as Bezers, who had many enemies, travelled with in those days; unless accompanied by ladies.  That the Vidame had provided such a reinforcement seemed to point to a wider scheme than the one with which we had credited him. But we could not guess what his plans were; since he must have ordered his people before he heard of Catherine's engagement.  Either his jealousy therefore had put him on the alert earlier, or his threatened attack on Pavannes was only part of a larger plot.  In either case our errand seemed more urgent, but scarcely more hopeful.  The varied sights and sounds however of the road--many of them new to us--kept us from dwelling over much on this.  Our eyes were young, and whether it was a pretty girl lingering behind a troop of gipsies, or a pair of strollers from Valencia--JONGLEURS they still called themselves--singing in the old dialect of Provence, or a Norman horse-dealer with his string of cattle tied head and tail, or the Puy de Dome to the eastward over the Auvergne hills, or a tattered old soldier wounded in the wars--fighting for either side, according as their lordships inclined--we were pleased with all.  Yet we never forgot our errand.  We never I think rose in the morning--too often stiff and sore--without thinking \"To-day or to-morrow or the next day--\" as the case might be--\"we shall make all right for Kit!\"  For Kit!  Perhaps it was the purest enthusiasm we were ever to feel, the least selfish aim we were ever to pursue.  For Kit!  Meanwhile we met few travellers of rank on the road.  Half the nobility of France were still in Paris enjoying the festivities which were being held to mark the royal marriage.  We obtained horses where we needed them without difficulty.  And though we had heard much of the dangers of the way, infested as it was said to be by disbanded troopers, we were not once stopped or annoyed.  But it is not my intention to chronicle all the events of this my first journey, though I dwell on them with pleasure; or to say what I thought of the towns, all new and strange to me, through which we passed. Enough that we went by way of Limoges, Chateauroux and Orleans, and that at Chateauroux we learned the failure of one hope we had formed. We had thought that Bezers when joined there by his troopers would not be able to get relays; and that on this account we might by travelling post overtake him; and possibly slip by him between that place and Paris.  But we learned at Chateauroux that his troop had received fresh orders to go to Orleans and await him there; the result being that he was able to push forward with relays so far.  He was evidently in hot haste.  For leaving there with his horses fresh he passed through Angerville, forty miles short of Paris, at noon, whereas we reached it on the evening of the same day--the sixth after leaving Caylus.  We rode into the yard of the inn--a large place, seeming larger in the dusk--so tired that we could scarcely slip from our saddles.  Jean, our servant, took the four horses, and led them across to the stables, the poor beasts hanging their heads, and following meekly.  We stood a moment stamping our feet, and stretching our legs.  The place seemed in a bustle, the clatter of pans and dishes proceeding from the windows over the entrance, with a glow of light and the sound of feet hurrying in the passages.  There were men too, half-a-dozen or so standing at the doors of the stables, while others leaned from the windows.  One or two lanthorns just kindled "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2041"],["title","The House of the Wolf: A Romance (#5)"],["body","here and there in the semi-darkness; and in a corner two smiths were shoeing a horse.  We were turning from all this to go in, when we heard Jean's voice raised in altercation, and thinking our rustic servant had fallen into trouble, we walked across to the stables near which he and the horses were still lingering.  \"Well, what is it?\"  I said sharply.  \"They say that there is no room for the horses,\" Jean answered querulously, scratching his head; half sullen, half cowed, a country servant all over.  \"And there is not!\"  cried the foremost of the gang about the door, hastening to confront us in turn.  His tone was insolent, and it needed but half an eye to see that his fellows were inclined to back him up. He stuck his arms akimbo and faced us with an impudent smile.  A lanthorn on the ground beside him throwing an uncertain light on the group, I saw that they all wore the same badge.  \"Come,\" I said sternly, \"the stables are large, and your horses cannot fill them.  Some room must be found for mine.\"  \"To be sure!  Make way for the king!\"  he retorted.  While one jeered \"VIVE LE ROI!\"  and the rest laughed.  Not good-humouredly, but with a touch of spitefulness.  Quarrels between gentlemen's servants were as common then as they are to-day.  But the masters seldom condescended to interfere. \"Let the fellows fight it out,\" was the general sentiment.  Here, however, poor Jean was over-matched, and we had no choice but to see to it ourselves.  \"Come, men, have a care that you do not get into trouble,\" I urged, restraining Croisette by a touch, for I by no means wished to have a repetition of the catastrophe which had happened at Caylus.  \"These horses belong to the Vicomte de Caylus.  If your master be a friend of his, as may very probably be the case, you will run the risk of getting into trouble.\"  I thought I heard, as I stopped speaking, a subdued muttering, and fancied I caught the words, \"PAPEGOT!  Down with the Guises!\" But the spokesman's only answer aloud was \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\" \"Cock-a-doodle-doo!\"  he repeated, flapping his arms in defiance. \"Here is a cock of a fine hackle!\"  And so on, and so forth, while he turned grinning to his companions, looking for their applause.  I was itching to chastise him, and yet hesitating, lest the thing should have its serious side, when a new actor appeared.  \"Shame, you brutes!\"  cried a shrill voice above us in the clouds it seemed.  I looked up, and saw two girls, coarse and handsome, standing at a window over the stable, a light between them.  \"For shame!  Don't you see that they are mere children?  Let them be,\" cried one.  The men laughed louder than ever; and for me, I could not stand by and be called a child.  \"Come here,\" I said, beckoning to the man in the doorway.  \"Come here, you rascal, and I will give you the thrashing you deserve for speaking to a gentleman!\"  He lounged forward, a heavy fellow, taller than myself and six inches wider at the shoulders.  My heart failed me a little as I measured him. But the thing had to be done.  If I was slight, I was wiry as a hound, and in the excitement had forgotten my fatigue.  I snatched from Marie a loaded riding-whip he carried, and stepped forward.  \"Have a care, little man!\"  cried the girl gaily--yet half in pity, I think.  \"Or that fat pig will kill you!\"  My antagonist did not join in the laugh this time.  Indeed it struck me that his eye wandered and that he was not so ready to enter the ring as his mates were to form it.  But before I could try his mettle, a hand was laid on my shoulder.  A man appearing from I do not know where--from the dark fringe of the group, I suppose--pushed me aside, roughly, but not discourteously.  \"Leave this to me!\"  he said, coolly stepping before me.  \"Do not dirty your hands with the knave, master.  I am pining for work and the job will just suit me!  I will fit him for the worms before the nuns above can say an AVE!\"  I looked at the newcomer.  He was a stout fellow; not over tall, nor over big; swarthy, with prominent features.  The plume of his bonnet was broken, but he wore it in a rakish fashion; and altogether he swaggered with so dare-devil an air, clinking his spurs and swinging out his long sword recklessly, that it was no wonder three or four of the nearest fellows gave back a foot.  \"Come on!\"  he cried, boisterously, forming a ring by the simple process of sweeping his blade from side to side, while he made the dagger in his left hand flash round his head.  \"Who is for the game? Who will strike a blow for the little Admiral?  Will you come one, two, three at once; or all together?  Anyway, come on, you--\" And he closed his challenge with a volley of frightful oaths, directed at the group opposite.  \"It is no quarrel of yours,\" said the big man, sulkily; making no show of drawing his sword, but rather drawing back himself.  \"All quarrels are my quarrels!  and no quarrels are your quarrels. That is about the truth, I fancy!\"  was the smart retort; which our champion rendered more emphatic by a playful lunge that caused the big bully to skip again.  There was a loud laugh at this, even among the enemy's backers. \"Bah, the great pig!\"  ejaculated the girl above.  \"Spit him!\" and she spat down on the whilom Hector--who made no great figure now.  \"Shall I bring you a slice of him, my dear?\"  asked my rakehelly friend, looking up and making his sword play round the shrinking wretch.  \"Just a tit-bit, my love?\"  he added persuasively.  \"A mouthful of white liver and caper sauce?\"  \"Not for me, the beast!\"  the girl cried, amid the laughter of the yard.  \"Not a bit?  If I warrant him tender?  Ladies' meat?\"  \"Bah!  no!\"  and she stolidly spat down again.  \"Do you hear?  The lady has no taste for you,\" the tormentor cried. \"Pig of a Gascon!\"  And deftly sheathing his dagger, he seized the big coward by the ear, and turning him round, gave him a heavy kick which sent him spinning over a bucket, and down against the wall.  There the bully remained, swearing and rubbing himself by turns; while the victor cried boastfully, \"Enough of him.  If anyone wants to take up his quarrel, Blaise Bure is his man.  If not, let us have an end of it. Let someone find stalls for the gentlemen's horses before they catch a chill; and have done with it.  As for me,\" he added, and then he turned to us and removed his hat with an exaggerated flourish, \"I am your lordship's servant to command.\"  I thanked him with a heartiness, half-earnest, half-assumed.  His cloak was ragged, his trunk hose, which had once been fine enough, were stained, and almost pointless, He swaggered inimitably, and had led-captain written large upon him.  But he had done us a service, for Jean had no further trouble about the horses.  And besides one has a natural liking for a brave man, and this man was brave beyond question.  \"You are from Orleans,\" he said respectfully enough, but as one asserting a fact, not asking a question.  \"Yes,\" I answered, somewhat astonished, \"Did you see us come in?\"  \"No, but I looked at your boots, gentlemen,\" he replied.  \"White dust, north; red dust, south.  Do you see?\"  \"Yes, I see,\" I said, with admiration.  \"You must have been brought up in a sharp school, M. Bure.\"  \"Sharp masters make sharp scholars,\" he replied, grinning.  And that answer I had occasion to remember afterwards.  \"You are from Orleans, also?\"  I asked, as we prepared to go in.  \"Yes, from Orleans too, gentlemen.  But earlier in the day.  With letters--letters of importance!\"  And bestowing something like a wink of confidence on us, he drew himself up, looked sternly at the stable-folk, patted himself twice on the chest, and finally twirled his moustaches, and smirked at the girl above, who was chewing straws.  I thought it likely enough that we might find it hard to get rid of him.  But this was not so.  After listening with gratification to our repeated thanks, he bowed with the same grotesque flourish, and marched off as grave as a Spaniard, humming--    \"Ce petit homme tant joli!   Qui toujours cause et toujours rit,   Qui toujours baise sa mignonne,   Dieu gard' de mal ce petit homme!\"  On our going in, the landlord met us politely, but with curiosity, and a simmering of excitement also in his manner. \"From Paris, my lords?\" he asked, rubbing his hands and bowing low.  \"Or from the south?\"  \"From the south,\" I answered.  \"From Orleans, and hungry and tired, Master Host.\"  \"Ah!\"  he replied, disregarding the latter part of my answer, while his little eyes twinkled with satisfaction.  \"Then I dare swear, my lords, you have not heard the news?\"  He halted in the narrow passage, and lifting the candle he carried, scanned our faces closely, as if he wished to learn something about us before he spoke.  \"News!\"  I answered brusquely, being both tired, and as I had told him, hungry.  \"We have heard none, and the best you can give us will be that our supper is ready to be served.\"  But even this snub did not check his eagerness to tell his news. \"The Admiral de Coligny,\" he said, breathlessly, \"you have not heard what has happened to him?\"  \"To the admiral?  No, what?\"  I inquired rapidly.  I was interested at last.  For a moment let me digress.  The few of my age will remember, and the many younger will have been told, that at this time the Italian queen-mother was the ruling power in France.  It was Catharine de' Medici's first object to maintain her influence over Charles the Ninth--her son; who, ricketty, weak, and passionate, was already doomed to an early grave.  Her second, to support the royal power by balancing the extreme Catholics against the Huguenots.  For the latter purpose she would coquet first with one party, then with the other.  At the present moment she had committed herself more deeply than was her wont to the Huguenots.  Their leaders, the Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, the King of Navarre, and the Prince of Conde, were supposed to be high in favour, while the chiefs of the other party,"]]]
