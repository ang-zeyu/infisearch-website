Poor Connie felt more than ever that she was a prisoner. More than ever did she long for the old life which she had lived. Notwithstanding her father's drinking bouts, notwithstanding his cruelty and neglect, the free life, the above-board life--even the dull, dull factory life--were all as heaven compared to this terrible, mysterious existence in Mrs. Warren's comfortable rooms.     CHAPTER VIII.  COMPARISONS.   Mrs. Warren and Agnes talked together for quite three quarters of an hour. When they came out of the bedroom, Mrs. Warren was wearing a tight-fitting cloth jacket, which made her look more enormous even than the cloak had done. She had a small black bonnet on her head, over which she had drawn a spotted net veil. Her hands were encased in decent black gloves, her skirt was short, and her boots tidy. She carried in her hand a fair-sized brown leather bag; and telling Connie that she was \"goin' out,\" and would be back when she saw her and not before, left the two girls alone in the little sitting-room.  After she had shut the door behind her, Agnes went over to it, and possessing herself of the key, slipped it into her pocket. Then she stared hard at Connie.  \"Well,\" she said, \"an' 'ow do yer like it?\"  \"I don't like it at all,\" answered Connie, \"I want to go--I will go. I'd rayther a sight be back in the factory. Mrs. Warren--she frightens me.\"  \"You be a silly,\" said Agnes. \"You talk like that 'cos you knows no better. Why, 'ere you are as cosy and well tended as gel could be. Look at this room. Think on the soft chair you're sittin' upon; think on the meals; think on yer bedroom; think on the beautiful walk you 'ad this morning. My word! you be a silly! No work to do, and nothing whatever to trouble yer, except to act the lydy. My word! ef _you're_ discontent, the world'll come to an end. Wish I were in your shoes--that I do.\"  \"Well, Agnes, get into them,\" said Connie. \"I'm sure you're more than welcome. I'm jest--jest pinin' for wot you thinks naught on. I want to see Giles and Sue and--and--father. You git into my shoes--you like it--I don't like it.\"  Agnes burst into a loud laugh.  \"My word!\" she said, \"you're be a gel and a 'arf. Wouldn't I jest jump at gettin' into your shoes if I could? But there! yer shoes don't fit me, and that's the truth.\"  \"Don't fit yer, don't they?\" exclaimed Connie. \"Wot do yer mean by that?\"  \"Too small,\" said Agnes, sticking out her ugly foot in its broken boot--\"too genteel--too neat. No one could make a lydy o' me. Look at my 'ands.\" She spread out her coarse, stumpy fingers. \"Look at my face. Why, yere's a glass; let's stand side by side, an' then let's compare. Big face; no nose to speak of; upper lip two inches long; mouth--slit from ear to ear; freckles; eyes what the boys call pig's eyes; 'air rough and coarse; figure stumpy. Now look at you. Face fair as a lily; nose straight and small; mouth like a rosebud; eyes blue as the sky. No, Connie, it can't be done; what with that face o' yourn, and that gold 'air o' yourn, you're a beauty hout and hout. Yer face is yer fortoon', my purty maid.\"  \"My face ain't my fortune.\"  \"Things don't fit, Connie. You ha' got to stay yere--and be a fine lydy. That's the way you works for yer livin'--I ha' to work in a different sort.\"  \"What sort? Oh, do tel me!\"  \"No; that's my secret. But I've spoke out plain with the old woman, and I'm comin' yere Saturday night--not to stay, bless yer! no, but to do hodd jobs for her; for one thing, to look arter you when she's out. I 'spect she'll get Ronald back now you ha' come.\"  \"Ronald!\" cried Connie. \"Who's he?\"  \"Never you mind; you'll know when yer see of 'im.\"  \"Then I'm a prisoner,\" said Connie--\"that's what it means.\"  \"Well, well! take it like that ef yer like. Ain't it natural that Mrs. Warren should want yer to stay now she ha' got yer? When yer stays willin'-like, as yer will all too soon, then yer'll 'ave yer liberty. Hin an' out then yer may go as yer pleases; there'll be naught to interfere. Yer'll jest do yer dooty then, and yer dooty'll be to please old Mammy Warren.\"  \"Has my father missed me?\" asked Connie, who saw by this time that she could not possibly cope with Agnes; if ever she was to effect her escape from this horrible place, it must be by guile.  \"'Ow is father?\" she asked. \"'Ave he missed me yet?\"  \"Know nothing 'bout him. Don't think he have, for the boys, Dick and Hal, was 'ome when I come back. They 'ad no news for me at all.\"  \"You saw Sue to-day?\"  \"Yus, I saw her, an' I kep' well away from her.\"  \"Agnes,\" said Connie in a very pleading voice, \"ef I must stay 'ere--an' I don't know wot I ha' done to be treated like this--will yer take a message from me to little Giles?\"  \"Wot sort?\" asked Agnes.  \"Tell 'im straight from me that I can't come to see 'im for a few days, an' ax him to pray for me; an' tell him that I 'ears the Woice same as he 'ears the Woice, and tell 'im as it real comforts me. Wull yer do that, Agnes--wull yer, now?\"  \"Maybe,\" said Agnes; then after a pause she added, \"Or maybe I won't. I 'ates yer Methody sort o' weak-minded folks. That's the worst o' you, Connie; you're real weak-minded, for all ye're so purty, what wid yer 'prays' an' yer Woice, indeed!\"  \"Hark! it's sounding now,\" said Connie.  She raised her little delicate hand, and turned her head to listen. The splendid notes filled the air. Connie murmured something under her breath.  \"I know wot Giles 'ud say 'bout the Woice to-night,\" she murmured.  But Agnes burst into a loud laugh.  \"My word!\" she said. \"You 're talkin' o' Big Ben. Well, you be a caution.\"  \"_He that shall endure_,\" whispered Connie; and then a curious hidden sunshine seemed to come out and radiate her small face. She folded her hands. The impatience faded from her eyes. She sat still and quiet.  \"Wot hever's the matter with yer?\" asked Agnes.  \"Naught as yer can understand, Aggie.\"  \"Let's get tea,\" said Agnes. She started up and made vigorous preparations. Soon the tea was served and placed upon the little centre-table. It was an excellent tea, with shrimps and bread-and-butter, and cake and jam. Agnes ate enormously, but Connie was not as hungry as usual.  \"Prime, I call it!\" said Agnes. \"My word! to think of gettin' all this and not workin' a bit for it! You be in luck, Connie Harris--you be in luck.\"  When the meal was over, and Agnes had washed up and made the place tidy, she announced her intention of going to sleep.  \"I'm dead-tired,\" she said, \"and swallerin' sech a fillin' meal have made me drowsy. But I ha' the key in my pocket, so don't you be trying that little gime o'running away.\"  Agnes slept, and snored in her sleep, and Connie restlessly walked to the window and looked out. When Big Ben sounded again her eyes filled with tears. She had never spent such a long and dismal evening in her life.  Mammy Warren did not return home until between ten and eleven o'clock. Immediately on her arrival, Agnes took her departure. Mammy Warren then locked the door, and having provided herself with a stiff glass of whisky-and-water, desired Connie to hurry off to bed.  \"Yer'll be losing yer purty sleep,\" she said, \"and then where'll yer be?\"  The next day Connie again walked abroad with Mrs. Warren. Once more she was dressed in the dark-blue costume, with her golden hair hanging in a great fleece down her back. But when she made her appearance without the little blue handkerchief, Mrs. Warren sent her back for it.  \"I know wot I'm about,\" she said. \"The blue in the 'andkercher'll add to the blue in yer eyes. Pop it on, gel, and be quick.\"  Connie obeyed.  \"I don't--want to,\" she said.  \"And _w'y_ don't yer?\"  The woman's voice was very fierce.  \"I'm somehow sort o' feared.\"  \"Take that for bein' sort o' feared,\" said Mrs. Warren; and she hit the child so fierce a blow on the arm that Connie cried out from the pain.  Poor Connie was a very timorous creature, however, and the effect of the blow was to make her meek and subservient. The blue handkerchief was tied on and arranged to Mrs. Warren's satisfaction, and they both went out into the open air.  They went by 'bus to quite a different part of the town on this occasion, and Mrs. Warren again assured her little companion that she had a great deal of shopping to get through.  \"That is why I wear this cloak,\" she said; \"I ha' bags fastened inside to hold the things as I buy.\"  Once again they got into a crowd, and once again Connie was desired to walk on a little way in front, and once again people turned to look at the slim, fair child with her beautiful face and lovely hair. Once more they entered several shops, and invariably chose the most crowded parts--so crowded that Mrs. Warren whispered to Connie:  \"We must wait till our turn, honey. We must ha' patience, dearie.\"  They had patience. Mrs. Warren did absolutely purchase half-a-dozen very coarse pocket-handkerchiefs, keeping Connie close to her all the time. One of these she straightway presented to the girl, saying in a loud voice as she did so to the attendant:  \"I'm out with the purty dear to give her exercise. I am her nurse. She mustn't walk too far. No, thank you, mum, I'll carry the 'andkerchers 'ome myself; I won't trouble yer to send them to Portland Mansions.--Now, come along, my dear; we mustn't waste our time in this 'ot shop. We must be hout, taking of our exercise.\"  They walked a very, very long way that morning, and Mrs. Warren, contrary to her yesterday's plan, did now and then expend a few pence. Whenever she did so she drew the shop people's attention to Connie, speaking of her as her charge, and a \"dear, delicate young lydy,\" and begging of the people to be quick, as \"'ot air\" was so bad for the dear child; and invariably she refused to allow a parcel to be sent to Portland Mansions, saying that she preferred to carry it. At last, however, she seemed to think"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20071"],["title","Sue, A Little Heroine (#8)"],["body","Connie had had sufficient exercise, and they went home from the corner of Tottenham Court Road on the top of a 'bus.  On their way Connie turned innocently to her companion and said:  \"Why ever did yer say as we lived in Portland Mansions?\" But a sharp pinch on the girl's arm silenced her, and she felt more nervous and frightened than ever.  The moment they got home, Mrs. Warren again returned to her bedroom, and came back neatly dressed in a black and yellow silk, with a keen appreciation of roast pork and apple sauce, which had been preparing in the oven all the morning. Connie too was hungry.  When the meal came to an end Mrs. Warren said:  \"More like a lydy you grows each minute. But, my dear, I must thank yer nivver to open yer mouth when you're out, for yer ain't got the accent. Yer must niver do it until yer has acquired the rightful accent.\"  \"Was that why yer pinched me so 'ard when I axed why yer spoke o' Portland Mansions?\" asked Connie.  Mrs. Warren burst into a loud laugh.  \"Course it were,\" she said. \"Don't yer nivver do nothing o' that sort agin.\"  \"But we don't live in Portland Mansions. Why did yer say so?\" asked Connie.  \"Ax no questions and yer'll be told no lies,\" was Mrs. Warren's response.  She accompanied this apparently innocent speech with a look out of her fierce black eyes which caused poor Connie's heart to sink into her shoes. After a minute Mrs. Warren said:  \"To-morrer's Saturday; we'll go out a bit in the morning, and then we'll take train into the country. I promised yer a jaunt, and yer shall 'ave it. I'm thinking a lot o' yer, my dear, and 'ow I can best help such a beautiful young gel. Yer accent must be 'tended to, and the best way to manage that is for you to have a refoined sort o' companion. Ronald is that sort. We'll go and fetch 'im 'ome to-morrer.\"  \"Whoever is Ronald?\" asked Connie. \"Do tell me, please,\" she added in an interested voice, \"for Agnes spoke of him yesterday.\"  \"You wait till yer see,\" said Mrs. Warren. She nodded good-humoredly.  The rest of the day passed very much like the day before. It was again intensely dull to poor Connie. She had nothing whatever to do but to feed and sit still. Again Mrs. Warren slept until tea-time. Then Agnes made her appearance, and Mrs. Warren went out in a tight-fitting coat, and with a leather bag in her hand. Agnes made tea and scolded Connie; and Connie grumbled and cried, and begged and begged to be given back her liberty.  Mrs. Warren returned a little later than the night before. Agnes went away; Mrs. Warren drank whisky-and-water, and Connie was sent to bed. Oh, it was a miserable night! And would her own people ever find her? Would Sue be satisfied that Connie was not quite lost? And would Father John look for her? Dear, kind, splendid Father John! What would she not give to hear his magnificent voice as he preached to the people once again? Would not her own father search heaven and earth to find his only child? He was so good to Connie when he was not drunk--so proud of her, too, so glad when she kissed him so anxious to do the best he could for her! Would he give her up for ever? \"Oh dear, dear!\" thought the poor child, \"if it was not for the Woice I believe I'd go mad; but the Woice--it holds me up. I'm 'appy enough w'en I 'ears it. Oh, little Giles, thank yer for telling me o' the wonnerful Woice!\"     CHAPTER IX.  A TRIP INTO THE COUNTRY.   Saturday dawned a very bright and beautiful day. Mrs. Warren got up early, and Connie also rose, feeling somehow or other that she was going to have a pleasanter time than she had yet enjoyed since her imprisonment. Oh yes, she was quite certain now that she was imprisoned; but for what object it was impossible for her even to guess.  Mrs. Warren bustled out quite an hour earlier than usual. She did not go far on this occasion. She seemed a little anxious, and once or twice, to Connie's amazement, dodged down a back street as though she were afraid. Her red face turned quite pale when she did this, and she clutched Connie's arm and said in a faltering voice:  \"I'm tuk with a stitch in my side! Oh, my poor, dear young lydy, I'm afeered as I won't be able to take yer for a long walk this blessed morning.\"  But when Connie, later on, inquired after the stitch, she was told to mind her own business, and she began to think that Mrs. Warren had pretended.  They reached Waterloo at quite an early hour, and there they took third-class tickets to a part of the country about thirty miles from London. It took them over an hour to get down, and during that time Connie sat by the window wrapped in contemplation. For the first time she saw green grass and hills and running water, and although it was midwinter she saw trees which seemed to her too magnificent and glorious for words. Her eyes shone with happiness, and she almost forgot Mrs. Warren's existence. At last they reached the little wayside station to which Mrs. Warren had taken tickets. They got out, and walked down a winding country lane.  \"Is this real, real country?\" asked Connie.  \"Yus--too real for me.\"  \"Oh ma'am, it's bootiful! But I dunna see the flowers.\"  \"Flowers don't grow in the winter, silly.\"  \"Don't they? I thought for sure I'd see 'em a-blowin' and a-growin'. Yer said so--yer mind.\"  \"Well, so yer wull, come springtime, ef ye're a good gel. Now, I want to talk wid yer wery serious-like.\"  \"Oh ma'am, don't!\" said poor Connie.  \"None o' yer 'dont's' wid me! You ha' got to be very thankful to me for all I'm a-doin' for yer--feedin yer, and cockerin' yer up, and makin' a fuss o' yer, and brushing out yer 'air, and giving yer blue ties, and boots, and gloves.\"  \"Oh ma'am, yes,\" said Connie; \"and I'm wery much obleeged--I am, truly--but I'd rayther a sight rayther, go 'ome to father; I would, ma'am.\"  \"Wot little gels 'ud like isn't wot little gels 'ull get,\" said Mrs. Warren. \"You come to me of yer own free will, and 'avin' come, yer'll stay. Ef yer makes a fuss, or lets out to anybody that yer don't like it, I've a little room in my house--a room widdout no light and no winder, and so far away from any other room that yer might scream yerself sick and no one 'ud 'ear. Into that room yer goes ef yer makes trouble. And now, listen.\"  Mrs. Warren gripped Connie's arm so tight that the poor child had to suppress a scream.  \"I know wot ye're been saying to Agnes--a-grumblin' and a-grumblin' to Agnes, instead o' down on yer knees and thankin' the Almighty that yer've found Mammy Warren. I know all about it: Yer'll stop that--d'yer 'ear--d'yer 'ear?\"  \"Yus, ma'am,\" said Connie.  \"Do yer, promise?\"  \"Yus, ma'am,\" said the poor child again.  \"I'll see as yer keeps it--yer little good-for-nothing beggar maid as I'm a-pamperin' of! Don't I work for yer, and toil for yer? And am I to have naught but grumbles for my pains? Yer won't like that room--an' it's there!\"  \"I won't grumble,\" said Connie, terrified, and not daring to do anything but propitiate her tyrant.  Mrs. Warren's manner altered.  \"Wull,\" she said, \"I ha' brought yer down all this long way to 'ave a plain talk, and I guess we 'ave 'ad it. You please me, and I'll do my dooty by you; but don't please me, and there ain't a gel in the whole of Lunnon'll be more misrubble than you. Don't think as yer'll git aw'y, for yer won't--no, not a bit o' it. And now I've something else to say. There's a young boy as we're goin' to see to-day. 'Is name is Ronald; he's a special friend o' mine. I ha' had that boy a-wisiting o' me afore now, but he were took bad with a sort of fever. My word! din't I nurse him--the best o' good things didn't I give 'im! But his narves went wrong, and I sent him into the country for change of hair. He's all right now. He's a very purty boy, same as you're a purty gel, and I'm goin' to bring him back to be a companion for yer.\"  \"Oh ma'am!\"  \"Yus,\" said Mrs. Warren. \"Yer'll like that, won't yer?\"  \"Oh yus, ma'am.\"  \"Wull, now--we'll be calling at the cottage in a few minutes, and wot I want yer to do is to have a talk with that yer boy. Ye're to tell him as I'm wonnerful good; ye're to tell him the sort o' things I does for yer. The poor boy--he got a notion in his head w'en he had the fever--that I--I--Mammy Warren--wor cruel to him. You tell him as there ain't a word o' truth in it, for a kinder or more motherly body never lived. Ef yer don't tell him that, I'll soon find out; an' there's the room without winders an' without light real 'andy. Now--do yer promise?\"  These words were accompanied by a violent shake.  \"Do yer promise?\"  \"Yus, I promise,\" said Connie, turning white.  Mrs. Warren had an extraordinary capacity for changing her voice and manner, even the expression of her face. While she had been extracting two promises from poor Connie, she looked like the most awful, wicked old woman that the worst parts of London could produce; but when on two points Connie had faithfully promised to yield to her wishes, she immediately altered her tactics, and became as genial and affectionate and pleasant as she had been the reverse a few minutes back.  \"I believes yer,\" she said, \"and you're a real nice child, and there won't be any one in the 'ole of Lunnun 'appier than you as long as yer take the part of poor old Mammy Warren. Now then, yere's the cottage, and soon we'll see the little man. He'll be a nice companion for yer, Connie, and yer'll like that, won't you?\"  \"Oh yes, ma'am,\" said Connie.  She was not a London child for nothing. She had known a good deal of its ups and downs, although nothing quite so terrible as her present position had ever entered into her mind. But she saw clearly enough that the only chance of deliverance for her, and perhaps for the poor little boy, was to carry out Mammy Warren's injunctions and to keep her promise to the letter. Accordingly, when Mrs. Warren's knock at the cottage door was answered by a kind-looking, pale-faced woman, Connie raised her bright blue eyes to the woman's face and listened with"]]]
