Nay, the malignity of Bezers' tone, the savage gleam of joy in his eyes appalled me to such an extent that I fancied for a moment I saw in him the devil incarnate!  He recovered his composure very quickly, however; and turned carelessly towards the door.  \"If you will follow me,\" he said, \"I will see you disposed of.  You may have to complain of your lodging--I have other things to think of to-night than hospitality, But you shall not need to complain of your supper.\"  He drew aside the curtain as he spoke, and passed into the next room before us, not giving a thought apparently to the possibility that we might strike him from behind.  There certainly was an odd quality apparent in him at times which seemed to contradict what we knew of him.  The room we entered was rather long than wide, hung with tapestry, and lighted by silver lamps.  Rich plate, embossed, I afterwards learned, by Cellini the Florentine--who died that year I remember--and richer glass from Venice, with a crowd of meaner vessels filled with meats and drinks covered the table; disordered as by the attacks of a numerous party.  But save a servant or two by the distant dresser, and an ecclesiastic at the far end of the table, the room was empty.  The priest rose as we entered, the Vidame saluting him as if they had not met that day.  \"You are welcome M. le Coadjuteur,\" he said; saying it coldly, however, I thought.  And the two eyed one another with little favour; rather as birds of prey about to quarrel over the spoil, than as host and guest.  Perhaps the Coadjutor's glittering eyes and great beak-like nose made me think of this.  \"Ho!  ho!\"  he said, looking piercingly at us--and no doubt we must have seemed a miserable and dejected crew enough.  \"Who are these?  Not the first-fruits of the night, eh?\"  The Vidame looked darkly at him.  \"No,\" he answered brusquely. \"They are not.  I am not particular out of doors, Coadjutor, as you know, but this is my house, and we are going to supper. Perhaps you do not comprehend the distinction.  Still it exists--for me,\" with a sneer.  This was as good as Greek to us.  But I so shrank from the priest's malignant eyes, which would not quit us, and felt so much disgust mingled with my anger that when Bezers by a gesture invited me to sit down, I drew back.  \"I will not eat with you,\" I said sullenly; speaking out of a kind of dull obstinacy, or perhaps a childish petulance.  It did not occur to me that this would pierce the Vidame's armour.  Yet a dull red showed for an instant in his cheek, and he eyed me with a look, that was not all ferocity, though the veins in his great temples swelled.  A moment, nevertheless, and he was himself again.  \"Armand,\" he said quietly to the servant, \"these gentlemen will not sup with me. Lay for them at the other end.\"  Men are odd.  The moment he gave way to me I repented of my words.  It was almost with reluctance that I followed the servant to the lower part of the table.  More than this, mingled with the hatred I felt for the Vidame, there was now a strange sentiment towards him--almost of admiration; that had its birth I think in the moment, when I held his life in my hand, and he had not flinched.  We ate in silence; even after Croisette by grasping my hand under the table had begged me not to judge him hastily.  The two at the upper end talked fast, and from the little that reached us, I judged that the priest was pressing some course on his host, which the latter declined to take.  Once Bezers raised his voice.  \"I have my own ends to serve!\"  he broke out angrily, adding a fierce oath which the priest did not rebuke, \"and I shall serve them.  But there I stop.  You have your own.  Well, serve them, but do not talk to me of the cause! The cause?  To hell with the cause!  I have my cause, and you have yours, and my lord of Guise has his!  And you will not make me believe that there is any other!\"  \"The king's?\"  suggested the priest, smiling sourly.  \"Say rather the Italian woman's!\"  the Vidame answered recklessly--meaning the queen-mother, Catharine de' Medici, I supposed.  \"Well, then, the cause of the Church?\"  the priest persisted.  \"Bah!  The Church?  It is you, my friend!\"  Bezers rejoined, rudely tapping his companion--at that moment in the act of crossing himself--on the chest.  \"The Church?\"  he continued; \"no, no, my friend.  I will tell you what you are doing.  You want me to help you to get rid of your branch, and you offer in return to aid me with mine--and then, say you, there will be no stick left to beat either of us.  But you may understand once for all\"--and the Vidame struck his hand heavily down among the glasses--\"that I will have no interference with my work, master Clerk!  None!  Do you hear?  And as for yours, it is no business of mine.  That is plain speaking, is it not?\"  The priest's hand shook as he raised a full glass to his lips, but he made no rejoinder, and the Vidame, seeing we had finished, rose. \"Armand!\"  he cried, his face still dark, \"take these gentlemen to their chamber.  You understand?\"  We stiffly acknowledged his salute--the priest taking no notice of us--and followed the servant from the room; going along a corridor and up a steep flight of stairs, and seeing enough by the way to be sure that resistance was hopeless.  Doors opened silently as we passed, and grim fellows, in corslets and padded coats, peered out.  The clank of arms and murmur of voices sounded continuously about us; and as we passed a window the jingle of bits, and the hollow clang of a restless hoof on the flags below, told us that the great house was for the time a fortress.  I wondered much.  For this was Paris, a city with gates and guards; the night a short August night.  Yet the loneliest manor in Quercy could scarcely have bristled with more pikes and musquetoons, on a winter's night and in time of war.  No doubt these signs impressed us all; and Croisette not least. For suddenly I heard him stop, as he followed us up the narrow staircase, and begin without warning to stumble down again as fast as he could.  I did not know what he was about; but muttering something to Marie, I followed the lad to see.  At the foot of the flight of stairs I looked back, Marie and the servant were standing in suspense, where I had left them.  I heard the latter bid us angrily to return.  But by this time Croisette was at the end of the corridor; and reassuring the fellow by a gesture I hurried on, until brought to a standstill by a man opening a door in my face.  He had heard our returning footsteps, and eyed me suspiciously; but gave way after a moment with a grunt of doubt I hastened on, reaching the door of the room in which we had supped in time to see something which filled me with grim astonishment; so much so that I stood rooted where I was, too proud at any rate to interfere.  Bezers was standing, the leering priest at his elbow.  And Croisette was stooping forward, his hands stretched out in an attitude of supplication.  \"Nay, but M. le Vidame,\" the lad cried, as I stood, the door in my hand, \"it were better to stab her at once than break her heart!  Have pity on her!  If you kill him, you kill her!\"  The Vidame was silent, seeming to glower on the boy.  The priest sneered.  \"Hearts are soon mended--especially women's,\" he said.  \"But not Kit's!\"  Croisette said passionately--otherwise ignoring him. \"Not Kit's!  You do not know her, Vidame!  Indeed you do not!\"  The remark was ill-timed.  I saw a spasm of anger distort Bezers' face. \"Get up, boy!\"  he snarled, \"I wrote to Mademoiselle what I would do, and that I shall do!  A Bezers keeps his word.  By the God above us--if there be a God, and in the devil's name I doubt it to-night!--I shall keep mine!  Go!\"  His great face was full of rage.  He looked over Croisette's head as he spoke, as if appealing to the Great Registrar of his vow, in the very moment in which he all but denied Him.  I turned and stole back the way I had come; and heard Croisette follow.  That little scene completed my misery.  After that I seemed to take no heed of anything or anybody until I was aroused by the grating of our gaoler's key in the lock, and became aware that he was gone, and that we were alone in a small room under the tiles. He had left the candle on the floor, and we three stood round it. Save for the long shadows we cast on the walls and two pallets hastily thrown down in one corner, the place was empty.  I did not look much at it, and I would not look at the others.  I flung myself on one of the pallets and turned my face to the wall, despairing.  I thought bitterly of the failure we had made of it, and of the Vidame's triumph.  I cursed St. Croix especially for that last touch of humiliation he had set to it.  Then, forgetting myself as my anger abated, I thought of Kit so far away at Caylus--of Kit's pale, gentle face, and her sorrow.  And little by little I forgave Croisette.  After all he had not begged for us--he had not stooped for our sakes, but for hers.  I do not know how long I lay at see-saw between these two moods. Or whether during that time the others talked or were silent, moved about the room or lay still.  But it was Croisette's hand on my shoulder, touching me with a quivering eagerness that instantly communicated itself to my limbs, which recalled me to the room and its shadows. \"Anne!\"  he cried.  \"Anne!  Are you awake?\"  \"What is it?\"  I said, sitting up and looking at him.  \"Marie,\" he began, \"has--\"  But there was no need for him to finish.  I saw that Marie was standing at the far side of the room by the unglazed window; which, being in a sloping part of the roof, inclined slightly also.  He had raised the shutter which closed it, and on his tip-toes--for the sill was almost his own height from the floor--was peering out.  I looked sharply at Croisette."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20411"],["title","The Witch-cult in Western Europe: A Study in Anthropology (#0)"],["body","WITCH-CULT IN WESTERN EUROPE  _A Study in Anthropology_  BY  MARGARET ALICE MURRAY  OXFORD AT THE CLARENDON PRESS 1921  Oxford University Press  _London Edinburgh Glasgow Copenhagen New York Toronto Melbourne Cape Town Bombay Calcutta Madras Shanghai_  Humphrey Milford Publisher to the UNIVERSITY     PREFACE   The mass of existing material on this subject is so great that I have not attempted to make a survey of the whole of European 'Witchcraft', but have confined myself to an intensive study of the cult in Great Britain. In order, however, to obtain a clearer understanding of the ritual and beliefs I have had recourse to French and Flemish sources, as the cult appears to have been the same throughout Western Europe. The New England records are unfortunately not published _in extenso_; this is the more unfortunate as the extracts already given to the public occasionally throw light on some of the English practices. It is more difficult to trace the English practices than the Scotch or French, for in England the cult was already in a decadent condition when the records were made; therefore records in a purely English colony would probably contain much of interest.  The sources from which the information is taken are the judicial records and contemporary chroniclers. In the case of the chroniclers I have studied their facts and not their opinions. I have also had access to some unpublished trials among the Edinburgh Justiciary Records and also in the Guernsey Greffe.  The following articles have already appeared in various journals, to whose editors I am indebted for kind permission to republish: 'Organization of Witch Societies' and 'Witches and the number Thirteen' in _Folk Lore_; 'The God of the Witches' in the _Journal of the Manchester Oriental Society_; 'Child Sacrifice', 'Witches' Familiars', 'The Devil's Mark', 'The Devil's Officers', 'Witches' Fertility Rites', 'Witches Transformations', in _Man_; and 'The Devil of North Berwick' in the _Scottish Historical Review_.

On the one hand are the writers who, having heard the evidence at first hand, believe implicitly in the facts and place upon them the unwarranted construction that those facts were due to supernatural power; on the other hand are the writers who, taking the evidence on hearsay and disbelieving the conclusions drawn by their opponents, deny the facts _in toto_. Both parties believed with equal firmness in a personal Devil, and both supported their arguments with quotations from the Bible. But as the believers were able to bring forward more texts than the unbelievers and had in their hands an unanswerable argument in the Witch of Endor, the unbelievers, who dared not contradict the Word of God, were forced to fall back on the theory that the witches suffered from hallucination, hysteria, and, to use the modern word, 'auto-suggestion'. These two classes still persist, the sceptic predominating. Between the believer who believed everything and the unbeliever who disbelieved everything there has been no critical examination of the evidence, which presents a new and untouched field of research to the student of comparative religion.  Among the believers in witchcraft everything which could not be explained by the knowledge at their disposal was laid to the credit of supernatural powers; and as everything incomprehensible is usually supposed to emanate from evil, the witches were believed to be possessed of devilish arts. As also every non-Christian God was, in the eyes of the Christian, the opponent of the Christian God, the witches were considered to worship the Enemy of Salvation, in other words, the Devil. The greater number of these writers, however, obtained the evidence at first hand, and it must therefore be accepted although the statements do not bear the construction put upon them. It is only by a careful comparison with the evidence of anthropology that the facts fall into their proper places and an organized religion stands revealed.  The common beliefs as to the powers of the witches are largely due to the credulous contemporary commentators, who misunderstood the evidence and then exaggerated some of the facts to suit their preconceived ideas of the supernatural powers of the witches; thereby laying themselves open to the ridicule of all their opponents, past and present. Yet the ridicule is not fully deserved, for the facts are there, though the explanation is wrong; for even the two points, which are usually considered the ultimate proof of the absurdity and incredibility of the whole system—the flying on a broomstick through the window or up the chimney, and the transformation into animals—are capable of explanation. The first can be accounted for when the form of early mound-dwellings is taken into consideration, and when it is remembered that among savage tribes there are often taboos connected with the door, the two-faced god being essentially a deity of the door. Besides this the fertility rites connected with the broom should be taken into account. The second should be compared with similar accounts of transformation into animals among the cults of other nations. Mr. A. B. Cook's comment on the Greek ritual applies quite as well to Western as to Eastern Europe: 'We may venture on the general statement that within the bounds of Hellenic mythology _animal-metamorphosis commonly points to a preceding animal cult_.'[1]  It is interesting to note the class of mind among those contemporary writers who believed in the reality of the facts confessed at the trials as compared with those who disbelieved. It will be seen that the most brilliant minds, the keenest intellects, the greatest investigators, were among the believers: Bodin, Lord Bacon, Raleigh, Boyle, Cudworth, Selden, Henry More, Sir Thomas Browne, Matthew Hale, Sir George Mackenzie, and many others, most of whom had heard the evidence at first hand. The sceptics were Weyer, pupil of the occultist Cornelius Agrippa; Reginald Scot, a Kentish country squire; Filmer, whose name was a byword for political bigotry; Wagstaffe, who went mad from drink; and Webster, a fanatical preacher.[2] The sceptics, with the exception of Weyer, appear to have had little or no first-hand evidence; their only weapon was an appeal to common sense and sentiment combined; their only method was a flat denial of every statement which appeared to point to supernatural powers. They could not disprove the statements; they could not explain them without opposing the accepted religious beliefs of their time, and so weakening their cause by exposing themselves to the serious charge of atheism; therefore they denied evidence which in the case of any other accusation would have been accepted as proof.  The evidence which I now bring forward is taken entirely from"]]]
