My practice has scarcely recovered yet from the injury which he did it.\"   \"He seems to have acted on your own principle, and to have considered the main chance to mean the most money.\"  \"And do you suppose Latimer would have remained with you if he could have made better terms for himself?\"  \"I know that during my long illness he was offered double what he was receiving, or could then hope ever to receive from my practice, and his reply to the offer was that the bonds forged by gratitude and affection, no interest could break. He has now built up the business again to far more than it was when he joined me--I know that I owe most of it to him, yet he will not listen to any advice to dissolve our partnership. Gentlemen,\" he said, \"I have a sentiment to propose to you, which you may drink in wine or water as you like best. 'THE MAIN CHANCE--always best secured by obedience to the golden rule--as ye would that others should do unto you, do ye even so to them.'\"     CHAPTER III.   The morning after Mr. Arlington had commenced our Christmas entertainments with the sketch of his friend Herbert Latimer's life, was dark and gloomy. At least, such was its aspect abroad, where leaden clouds covered the sky, and a cold, sleety rain fell fast; but within, all was bright, and warm, and cheerful. Immediately after breakfast we separated, each in search of amusement suited to his or her own tastes: some to the music room, some to the library, and Robert Dudley and Annie Donaldson to a game of battledore and shuttlecock in the wide hall, with Mr. Arlington for a spectator. As the storm increased, however, all seemed to feel the want of companionship, and without any preconcerted plan, we found ourselves, about two hours after breakfast, again assembled in the room in which quiet, patient Mrs. Donaldson sat, ravelling the netting of the last evening.  \"Now for Aunt Nancy's portfolio,\" cried Annie, as soon as conversation began to flag.  The proposal was seconded so warmly that, as I could urge nothing against it, the portfolio was immediately produced, and Annie, taking possession of it, commissioned Robert Dudley to draw forth an engraving:--\"Scene, a chamber by night, a sleeping baby and a sleepy mother, a basket of needle-work--I am sure it is needle-work--on the floor, and a cross suspended from the wall,\" said Annie, describing the engraving which she had taken from Robert.  \"That cross looks promising,\" said Colonel Donaldson, who likes a little romance as well as any of his daughters. \"Let us have the fair lady's history, Aunt Nancy.\"  \"I know nothing about her,\" said I, with a smile at his eagerness.  \"Then why, dear Aunt Nancy, did you keep the engraving?\" asked Annie.  \"I might answer, because of my interest in the scene it depicts--a scene in which religion seems to shed its sanctifying influence over the tenderest affection and the homeliest duties of our common life; but I had another reason.\"  \"Ah! I knew it,\" exclaimed Annie.  \"I first saw this print in company with a very cultivated and interesting German lady, to whose memory the sleeping baby recalled a cradle song written by her countryman, the brave Körner. She sang it for me, and as the German is, I am grieved to say, a sealed book to me, she gave me a literal translation of the words, which--\"  \"Which you have put into English verse, and written here at the back of the engraving in the finest of all fine writing, and which papa will put on his spectacles and read for us.\"  \"No; I commission Mr. Arlington to do that,\" said the Colonel, \"without his spectacles.\"  \"First,\" said I, \"let me assure you that the original is full of a simple, natural tenderness, which I fear, in the double process of translating and versifying, has entirely escaped.\"  Mr. Arlington, taking the paper from Annie, now read,--   THE CRADLE SONG;  A FREE TRANSLATION FROM KÖRNER.      I.      Slumberer! to thy mother's breast,     So fondly folded, sweetly rest!     Within that fair and quiet world,     With downy pinions scarce unfurl'd,     Life gently passes, nor doth bring     One dream of sorrow on its wing.       II.      Pleasant our dreams in early hours,     When Mother-love our life embowers;--     Ah! Mother-love! thy tender light     Hath vanished from my sky of night,     Scarce leaving there one fading ray     To thrill me with, remember'd day.       III.      Thrice, by the smiles of fav'ring Heaven,     To man this holiest joy is given;     Thrice, circled by the arms of love,     With glowing spirit he may prove     The highest rapture heart can feel,     The noblest hopes our lives reveal.       IV.      The earliest blessings that enwreathed     His infant days, 'twas Love that breathed.     In Love's warm smile the nursling blooms,     Nor fears one shade that o'er him glooms,     While flowers unfold and waters dance     In joy, beneath his first, fresh glance.       V.      And when around the youth's bold course     Clouds gather--tempests spend their force--     When his soul darkens with his sky,     Again the Love-God hovers nigh;     And on some gentle maiden's breast     Lulls him, once more, to blissful rest.       VI.      But when his heart bends to the power     Of storm, as bends the summer flower,     'Tis Love that, as the Angel-Death     Wooes from his lips the ling'ring breath,     And gently bears his soul above,     To the bright skies--the home of Love.  \"Poor Körner!\" said Mr. Arlington, as he concluded reading this song--if indeed it may claim that name in its English dress--\"I can sympathize, as few can do, with his mournful memory of mother-love.\"  This was said in a tone of such genuine emotion, that I looked at him with even more pleasure than I had hitherto done.  \"Such tenderness touches us particularly when found, as in Körner, in union with manly and vigorous qualities--perhaps, because it is a rare combination,\" said Mrs. Dudley.  \"Is it rare?\" I asked doubtfully. \"The results of my own observation have led me to believe that it is precisely in manly, vigorous, independent minds that we see the fullest development of our simple, natural, home-affections.\"  \"You are right, Aunt Nancy,\" said Col. Donaldson; \"it is only boys striving to seem manly and men of boyish minds, who fail to acknowledge with reverence and tenderness the value of a mother's love.\"  \"So convinced am I of this,\" I replied, \"that I would ask for no more certain indication of a man's nobility of nature, than his manner to his mother. I remember a striking illustration of the fidelity of such an indication in two brothers of the name of Manning, with whom I was once acquainted. The one was quite a _petit-maître_--a dandy; the other, a fine creature--large-minded and large-hearted. The first betrayed in every look and movement, that he considered himself greatly his mother's superior, and feared every moment that she should detract from his dignity by some sin against the dicta of fashion; the other did honor at once to her and to himself, by his reverent devotion to her. They were a contrast, and a contrast which circumstances brought out most strikingly. Ah, Mr. Arlington! I wish you could have seen them--a sketch of them from your pencil would have been a picture indeed.\"  \"We will take your word-painting instead,\" said Mr. Arlington.  \"A mere description in words could not present them to you in all their strongly marked diversity of character. To do this, I must give you a history of their lives.\"  \"And why not?\"--and--\"Oh, yes, Aunt Nancy, that is just what we want,\" was echoed from one to another. They consented to delay their gratification till the evening, that I might have a little time to arrange my reminiscences; and when \"the hours of long uninterrupted evening\" came, and we had      \"----stirr'd the fire and closed the shutters fast,     Let fall the curtains, wheeled the sofa round,\"  and disposed ourselves in comfort for talking and for listening, I gave them the relation which you will find below under the title of   THE BROTHERS;  OR, IN THE FASHION AND ABOVE THE FASHION.  \"Some men are born to greatness--some achieve greatness--and some have greatness thrust upon them.\" Henry Manning belonged to the second of these three great classes. The son of a mercantile adventurer, who won and lost a fortune by speculation, he found himself at sixteen years of age called on to choose between the life of a Western farmer, with its vigorous action, stirring incident and rough usage--and the life of a clerk in one of the most noted establishments in Broadway, the great source and centre of fashion in New-York. Mr. Morgan, the brother of Mrs. Manning, who had been recalled from the distant West by the death of her husband, and the embarrassments into which that event had plunged her, had obtained the offer of the latter situation for one of his two nephews, and would take the other with him to his prairie-home.  \"I do not ask you to go with me, Matilda,\" he said to his sister, \"because our life is yet too wild and rough to suit a delicate woman, reared, as you have been, in the midst of luxurious refinements. The difficulties and privations of life in the West fall most heavily upon woman, while she has little of that sustaining power which man's more adventurous spirit finds in overcoming difficulty and coping with danger. But let me have one of your boys; and by the time he has arrived at manhood, he will be able, I doubt not, to offer you in his home all the comforts, if not all the elegances of your present abode.\"  Mrs. Manning consented; and now the question was, which"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20018"],["title","Evenings at Donaldson Manor; Or, The Christmas Guest (#6)"],["body","her sons should remain with her, and which should accompany Mr. Morgan. To Henry Manning, older by two years than his brother George, the choice of situations was submitted. He went with his uncle to the Broadway establishment, heard the duties which would be demanded from him, the salary which would be given, saw the grace with which the _élégants_ behind the counter displayed their silks, and satins, and velvets, to the _élégantes_ before the counter, and the decision with which they promulgated the decrees of fashion; and with that just sense of his own powers, which is the accompaniment of true genius, he decided at once that there lay his vocation. George, who had not been without difficulty kept quiet, while his brother was forming his decision, as soon as it was announced, sprang forward with a whoop that would have suited a Western forest better than a New-York drawing-room, threw the Horace he was reading across the table, clasped first his mother and then his uncle in his arms, and exclaimed, \"I am the boy for the West. I will help you fell forests and build cities there, uncle. Why should not we build cities as well as Romulus and Remus?\"  \"I will supply your cities with all their silks, and satins, and velvets, and laces, and charge them nothing, George,\" said Henry Manning, with that air of superiority with which the worldly-wise often look on the sallies of the enthusiast.  \"You make my head ache, my son,\" complained Mrs. Manning, shrinking from his boisterous gratulation;--but Mr. Morgan returned his hearty embrace, and as he gazed into his bold, bright face, with an eye as bright as his own, replied to his burst of enthusiasm, \"You _are_ the very boy for the West, George. It is out of such brave stuff that pioneers and city-builders are always made.\"  Henry Manning soon bowed himself into the favor of the ladies who formed the principal customers of his employer. By his careful and really correct habits, and his elegant taste in the selection and arrangement of goods, he became also a favorite with his employers themselves. They needed an agent for the selection of goods abroad, and they sent him. He purchased cloths for them in England, and silks in France, and came home with the reputation of a travelled man. Having persuaded his mother to advance a capital for him by selling out the bank stock in which Mr. Morgan had founded her little fortune, at twenty-four years of age he commenced business for himself as a French importer. Leaving a partner to attend to the sales at home, he went abroad for the selection of goods, and the further enhancement of his social reputation. He returned in two years with a fashionable figure, a most _recherché_ style of dress, moustachios of the most approved cut, and whiskers of faultless curl--a finished gentleman in his own conceit. With such attractions, the _prestige_ which he derived from his reported travels and long residence abroad, and the _savoir faire_ of one who had made the conventional arrangements of society his study, he quickly arose to the summit of his wishes, to the point which it had been his life's ambition to attain. He became the umpire of taste, and his word was received as the fiat of fashion. He continued to reside with his mother, and paid great attention to her style of dress, and the arrangements of her house, for it was important that his mother should appear properly. Poor Mrs. Manning! she sometimes thought that proud title dearly purchased by listening to his daily criticisms on appearance, language, manners, which had been esteemed stylish enough in their day.  George Manning had visited his mother only once since he left her with all the bright imaginings and boundless confidence of fourteen, and then Henry was in Europe. It was during the first winter after his return, and when the brothers had been separated for nearly twelve years, that Mrs. Manning informed him she had received a letter from George, announcing his intention to be in New-York in December, and to remain with them through most if not all of the winter. Henry Manning was evidently annoyed at the announcement.  \"I wish,\" he said, \"that George had chosen to make his visit in the summer, when most of the people to whom I should hesitate to introduce him would have been absent. I should be sorry to hurt his feelings, but really, to introduce a Western farmer into polished society--\" Henry Manning shuddered, and was silent. \"And then to choose this winter of all winters for his visit, and to come in December, just at the very time that I heard yesterday Miss Harcourt was coming from Washington to spend a few weeks with her friend, Mrs. Duffield!\"  \"And what has Miss Harcourt's visit to Mrs. Duffield to do with George's visit to us?\" asked Mrs. Manning.  \"A great deal--at least it has a great deal to do with my regret that he should come just now. I told you how I became acquainted with Emma Harcourt in Europe, and what a splendid creature she is. Even in Paris, she bore the palm for wit and beauty--and fashion too--that is in English and American society. But I did not tell you that she received me with such distinguished favor, and evinced so much pretty consciousness at my attentions, that had not her father, having been chosen one of the electors of President and Vice-President, hurried from Paris in order to be in this country in time for his vote, I should probably have been induced to marry her. Her father is in Congress this year, and you see, she no sooner learns that I am here, than she comes to spend part of the winter with a friend in New-York.\"  Henry arose at this, walked to a glass, surveyed his elegant figure, and continuing to cast occasional glances at it as he walked backwards and forwards through the room, resumed the conversation, or rather his own communication.  \"All this is very encouraging, doubtless; but Emma Harcourt is so perfectly elegant, so thoroughly refined, that I dread the effect upon her of any _outré_ association--by the by, mother, if I obtain her permission to introduce you to her, you will not wear that brown hat in visiting her--a brown hat is my aversion--it is positively vulgar--but to return to George--how can I introduce him, with his rough, boisterous, Western manner, to this courtly lady?--the very thought chills me\"--and Henry Manning shivered--\"and yet, how can I avoid it, if we should be engaged?\"  With December came the beautiful Emma Harcourt, and Mrs. Duffield's house was thronged with her admirers. Hers was the form and movement of the Huntress Queen rather than of one trained in the halls of fashion. There was a joyous freedom in her air, her step, her glance, which, had she been less beautiful, less talented, less fortunate in social position or in wealth, would have placed her under the ban of fashion; but, as it was, she commanded fashion, and even Henry Manning, the very slave of conventionalism, had no criticism for her. He had been among the first to call on her, and the blush that flitted across her cheek, the smile that played upon her lips, as he was announced, might well have flattered one even of less vanity.  The very next day, before Henry had had time to improve these symptoms in her favor, on returning home, at five o'clock, to his dinner, he found a stranger in the parlor with his mother. The gentleman arose on his entrance, and he had scarcely time to glance at the tall, manly form, the lofty air, the commanding brow, ere he found himself clasped in his arms, with the exclamation, \"Dear Henry! how rejoiced I am to see you again.\"  In George Manning the physical and intellectual man had been developed in rare harmony. He was taller and larger every way than his brother Henry, and the self-reliance which the latter had laboriously attained from the mastery of all conventional rules, was his by virtue of a courageous soul, which held itself above all rules but those prescribed by its own high sense of the right. There was a singular contrast, rendered yet more striking by some points of resemblance, between the pupil of society, and the child of the forest--between the Parisian elegance of Henry, and the proud, free grace of George. His were the step and bearing which we have seen in an Indian chief; but thought had left its impress on his brow, and there was in his countenance that indescribable air of refinement which marks a polished mind. In a very few minutes Henry became reconciled to his brother's arrival, and satisfied with him in all respects but one--his dress. This was of the finest cloth, but made into large, loose trowsers, and a species of hunting-shirt, trimmed with fur, belted around the waist, and descending to the knee, instead of the tight pantaloons and closely fitting body coat prescribed by fashion. The little party lingered long over the table--it was seven o'clock before they arose from it.  \"Dear mother,\" said George Manning, \"I am sorry to leave you this evening, but I will make you rich amends to-morrow by introducing to you the friend I am going to visit, if you will permit me. Henry, it is so long since I was in New-York that I need some direction in finding my way--must I turn up or down Broadway for Number--, in going from this street?\"  \"Number--,\" exclaimed Henry in surprise; \"you must be mistaken--that is Mrs. Duffield's.\"  \"Then I am quite right, for it is at Mrs. Duffield's that I expect to meet my friend this evening.\"  With some curiosity to know what friend of George could have so completely the _entrée_ of the fashionable Mrs. Duffield's house as to make an appointment there, Henry proposed to go with him and show him the way. There was a momentary hesitation in George's manner before he replied, \"Very well, I shall be obliged to you.\"  \"But--excuse me George--you are not surely going in that dress--this is one of Mrs. Duffield's reception evenings, and, early as it is, you will find company there.\"  George laughed as he replied; \"They must take me as I"]]]
