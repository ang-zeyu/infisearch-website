All rights reserved.     PREFACE.   \"YOUNG CAPTAIN JACK\" relates the adventures of a boy waif, who is cast upon the Atlantic shore of one of our Southern States and taken into one of the leading families of the locality. The youth grows up as a member of the family, knowing little or nothing of his past. This is at the time of the Civil War, when the locality is in constant agitation, fearing that a battle will be fought in the immediate vicinity. During this time there appears upon the scene a Confederate surgeon who, for reasons of his own, claims Jack as his son. The youth has had trouble with this man and despises him. He cannot make himself believe that the surgeon is his parent and he refuses to leave his foster mother, who thinks the world of him. Many complications arise, but in the end the truth concerning the youth's identity is uncovered, and all ends happily for the young son of a soldier.  In its original shape Mr. Alger intended this tale of a soldier's son for a juvenile drama, and it is, therefore, full of dramatic situations. But it was not used as a play, and when the gifted author of so many boys' books had laid aside his pen forever the manuscript was placed in the hands of the present writer, to be made over into such a book as would evidently have met with the noted author's approval. The success of other books by Mr. Alger, and finished by the present writer, has been such that my one wish is that this story may meet with equal commendation.  Arthur M.

THE ENCOUNTER ON THE BRIDGE.   \"Get out of the way, boy, or I'll ride over you!\"  \"Wait a second, please, until I haul in this fish. He's such a beauty I don't wish to lose him.\"  \"Do you suppose I'm going to bother with your fish? Get out of the way, I say!\" And the man, who sat astride of a coal-black horse, shook his hand threateningly. He was dressed in the uniform of a surgeon in the Confederate Army, and his face was dark and crafty.  The boy, who was but fourteen and rather slenderly built, looked up in surprise. He was seated on the side of a narrow bridge spanning a mountain stream flowing into the ocean, and near him rested a basket half-filled with fish. He had been on the point of hauling in another fish--of extra size--but now his prize gave a sudden flip and disappeared from view.  \"Gone! and you made me miss him!\" he cried, much vexed.  \"Shut up about your fish and get out of the way!\" stormed the man on the horse. \"Am I to be held up here all day by a mere boy?\"  \"Excuse me, but I have as much right on this bridge as you,\" answered the boy, looking the man straight in the eyes.  \"Have you indeed?\"  \"I have.\"  \"Perhaps you think yourself of just as much importance as a surgeon in the army, on an important mission.\"  \"I didn't say that. I said I had just as much right on this bridge as you. It's a public bridge.\"  \"Bah! get out of the way and let me pass. I've wasted time enough on you.\" The man tugged nervously at his heavy mustache. \"Which is the way to Tanner's Mill?\"  To this the youth made no reply. Gathering up his fishing rod and his basket, he stepped to the river bank and prepared to make another cast into the water.  \"I say, tell me the way to Tanner's Mill,\" repeated the man.  \"I reckon you had better go elsewhere for your information,\" returned the boy quietly, but with a faint smile playing over his handsome, sunburned face.  \"What, you young rascal, you won't tell me?\" stormed the man.  \"No, I won't. And I beg to let you know I am no rascal.\"  \"You are a rascal,\" was the snappy reply. \"Answer my question, or it will be the worse for you,\" and now the man leaped to the ground and advanced with clenched fists. Possibly he thought the youth would retreat; if so, he was mistaken.  \"Don't you dare to touch me, sir. I am not your slave.\"  \"You'll answer my question.\"  \"I will not.\"  \"Why not?\"  \"Because you haven't treated me decently; that's why.\"  \"You hold a mighty big opinion of yourself.\"  \"If I do, that's my own business.\"  \"Perhaps you are a Northern mudsill.\"  \"No, I am just as loyal to the South as you or anybody.\"  \"I wouldn't care to take your word on that point, youngster. I am on an important mission, and if you sympathize with our South in this great war you'll direct me to the short way to Tanner's Mill.\"  \"Do they expect a fight at Tanner's Mill?\"  \"Don't bother me with questions. Show me the road, and I'll be off.\"  \"Keep to the right and you'll be right,\" answered the youth, after a pause, and then he resumed his fishing.  The man scowled darkly as he leaped again into the saddle. \"How I would love to warm you--if I had time,\" he muttered, then put spurs to his steed and galloped off.  \"So he is going to Tanner's Mill,\" mused the boy, when left alone. \"If they have a fight there it will be getting pretty close to home. I don't believe mother will like that.\"  As will be surmised from the scene just described, Jack Ruthven was a manly, self-reliant boy, not easily intimidated by those who would browbeat him.  He lived in a large mansion, set back some distance from the river, upon what was considered at that time one of the richest plantations in South Carolina.  Mrs. Ruthven was a widow, having lost her husband, Colonel Martin Ruthven, at the bloody battle of Gettysburg. She had one daughter, Marion, a beautiful young lady of seventeen. Marion and Jack thought the world of each other and were all but inseparable.  The sudden taking-off of the colonel had proved a great shock both to the children and to Mrs. Ruthven, and for a long time the lady of the house had lain on a bed of sickness, in consequence.  She was now around, but still weak and pale. Her one consolation was the children, and she clung to them closer than ever.  On several occasions Jack had spoken of enlisting as a drummer boy, but Mrs. Ruthven would not listen to it.  \"No, no, Jack! I cannot spare you!\" had been her words. \"One gone out of the family is enough.\"  And Marion, too, had clung to him, so that going away became almost an impossibility, although he longed for the glories of a soldier's life, with never a thought of all the hardships and sufferings such a life entails.  The meeting with the Confederate surgeon had filled Jack's head once more with visions of army life, and as he continued to fish he forgot all about the unpleasant encounter, although he remembered that repulsive face well. He was destined to meet the surgeon again, and under most disagreeable circumstances.  \"I wish mother would let me join the army,\" he thought, after hauling in another fish. \"I am sure our regiments need all the men they can get. Somehow, we seem to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20432"],["title","Young Captain Jack; Or, The Son of a Soldier (#1)"],["body","getting the worst of the fighting lately. I wonder what would happen if the South should be beaten in this struggle?\"  Ten minutes passed, when a merry whistle was heard on the road and another boy appeared, of about Jack's age.  \"Hullo, Darcy!\" cried Jack. \"Come to help me fish?\"  \"I didn't know you were fishing,\" answered Darcy Gilbert, a youth who lived on the plantation next to Jack. \"Are you having good luck?\"  \"First-rate. I was getting ready to go home, but now you have come I'll stay a while longer.\"  \"Do, Jack; I hate to fish alone. But I say, Jack----\" And then Darcy broke off short.  \"What were you going to say?\"  \"Oh, nothing!\"  There was a minute of silence, during which Darcy baited his hook and threw it in.  \"You look as if you had something on your mind. Darcy,\" went on Jack, after his friend had brought in a fine haul apparently without appreciating the sport. \"Did you meet a Confederate surgeon on the road?\"  \"No, I came across the plantation. What of him?\"  \"He came this way, and we got into a regular row because I wouldn't clear right out and give him the whole of the bridge.\"  \"He didn't hit you, did he?\"  \"Not much! If he had I would have pitched into him, I can tell you, big as he was!\" And Jack's eyes flashed in a way that proved he meant what he said.  \"No, I didn't meet him, but I met St. John Ruthven, your cousin. Jack, do you know that that young man is a regular bully, even if he is a dandy?\"  \"Yes, I know it, Darcy.\"  \"And he is down on you.\"  \"I know that too. But why he dislikes me I don't know, excepting that I don't like to see him paying his addresses to my sister Marion. Marion is too good for such a man.\"  \"Is he paying his addresses to her?\"  \"Well, he is with her every chance he can get.\"  \"Does Marion like him?\"  \"Oh! I reckon she does in a way. He is always so nice to her--much nicer than he has ever been to me.\"  \"Has he ever spoken to you about yourself?\" went on Darcy Gilbert, with a peculiar look at Jack.  \"Oh, yes! often.\"  \"I mean about--well, about your past?\" went on Darcy, with some confusion.  \"My past, Darcy? What is wrong about my past?\"  \"Nothing, I hope. But I didn't like what St. John Ruthven said about you.\"  \"But what did he say?\"  \"I don't know as I ought to tell you. I didn't believe him.\"  \"But I want to know what he did say?\" demanded Jack, throwing down his fishing pole and coming up close to his friend.  \"Well, if you must know, Jack, he said you were a nobody, that you didn't belong to the Ruthven family at all, and that you would have to go away some day,\" was the answer, which filled Jack with consternation.     CHAPTER II.  DARCY GILBERT'S STORY.   \"He said I didn't belong to the Ruthven family?\" said Jack slowly, when he felt able to speak.  \"He did, and I told him I didn't believe him.\"  \"But--but--I don't understand you, Darcy. Am I not Jack Ruthven, the son of the late Colonel Martin Ruthven?\"  \"He says not.\"  \"What! Does he mean to say that my mother isn't my mother at all?\" ejaculated Jack, with wide-open eyes.  \"That's it exactly, and he added that Marion wasn't your sister.\"  \"I'll--I'll punch his head for that!\" was the quick return.  \"I felt like doing that, too, Jack, even though he is so much older than either of us. I told him he was a mean fellow and that I wouldn't believe him under oath.\"  \"But how did it all come about?\"  \"Oh, it started at the boathouse back of Old Ben's place. He wanted to bully me, and I told him I wouldn't let him lord it over me any more than you let him bully you. That got him started, for it seems he was sore over the fact that you took Marion out for a boatride one afternoon when he wanted her to go along with him on horseback. One word brought on another, and at last he said he reckoned you would have to clear out some day--that you were only a low upstart anyway, with no real claim on the Ruthvens.\"  \"He said that, did he?\" Jack drew a long breath and set his teeth hard. \"Did he try to prove his words?\"  \"I didn't give him a chance. I was so upset I merely told him I didn't believe him, and came away.\"  \"And where did he go?\"  \"He started off toward town.\"  \"When he comes back I'm going to find out the truth of this matter.\"  \"I don't believe his story, Jack, and I wouldn't worry myself about it.\"  \"But supposing it were true, Darcy--that I was a--a--nobody, as he says?\"  \"I should think just as much of you,\" answered the other lad quickly.  \"Thank you for that.\"  \"St. John always talks too much--don't mind him.\"  \"But I shall. If he tells the truth I want to know it--and, if not, I shall take steps to make him take back the stories he is circulating.\"  \"It's a wonder he hasn't gone to the war. Why doesn't he enlist, like the rest of the young men in this neighborhood?\"  \"He says he must stay with his mother. But the real reason is, I think, that he is a coward.\"  \"Perhaps you are right. I remember once, when there was a cry of mad dog in the town, he hid in a warehouse and was almost scared to death.\"  \"Yes, I remember that, and I remember, too, when Big Bill, the slave, ran away and threatened to kill the first white man he met, St. John hid in the mansion and didn't come outside the door for a week.\"  \"Such a coward wouldn't be above circulating falsehoods.\"  \"I wish I knew just where to find him. I would have it out with him in short order,\" concluded Jack.  The youth was in no humor for further fishing and soon wound up his line and started for home.  As he passed along over the plantation road his thoughts were busy. Could there be any truth in what St. John Ruthven had said? Was he really a nobody, with no claim upon the lady he called mother and the girl he looked upon as his sister? A chill passed down his backbone, and, as he came in sight of the stately old mansion that he called home, he paused to wipe the cold perspiration from his forehead.  \"I will go to mother and ask her the truth,\" he told himself. \"I can't wait to find out in any other way.\" Yet the thought of facing that kind-hearted lady was not a pleasant one. How should he begin to tell her of what was in his mind?  \"Is my mother in?\" he asked of the maid whom he met in the hallway.  \"No, Massah Jack, she dun went to town,\" was the answer of the colored girl.  \"Did she say when she would be back?\"  \"No, sah.\"  \"Do you know if my sister is around?\"  \"She dun gone off not five minutes ago, Massah Jack.\"  \"Where to?\"  \"I heard her say she was gwine down to Ole Ben's boathouse. I 'spect she dun t'ought yo' was dar.\"  Jack said no more, but giving the colored girl the fish, to take around to the cook, he ran upstairs, washed and brushed up, and sallied forth to find Marion.  The boathouse which had been mentioned was an old affair, standing upon the shore of a wide bay overlooking the Atlantic ocean. It belonged to a colored man called \"Old Ben,\" a fellow who had once been a slave on the Ruthven plantation.  As Jack approached it he saw Marion sitting on a bench in the shade, with a book in her lap. Instead of reading, however, the girl was gazing out to sea in a meditative way.  \"Marion, I was looking for you.\"  \"Oh, Jack! is that you? I thought you had gone fishing for the day.\"  \"I just got home, after catching a pretty good mess. Want to go rowing with me?\"  \"Yes, I'd like that very much. I was wishing you or Old Ben would come.\"  \"Or, perhaps, St. John?\" said Jack inquiringly.  \"No; I didn't wish for him, you tease.\"  \"I am glad of it, Marion. I don't want you to give me up for St. John.\"  \"I do not intend to, Jack. But why are you looking so serious. Have you anything on your mind? I never saw you look so thoughtful before.\"  \"Yes, I have a lot on my mind, Marion. Come, I'll tell you when we are out on the bay.\"  A rowboat was handy and oars were in the rack in the boathouse, and soon the pair were out on the water. Although but a boy, Jack took to the water naturally and handled the oars as skillfully as the average sailor.  When they were about halfway across the bay he ceased rowing and looked earnestly at the girl before him.  \"Marion, I want to find out--that is, I've got some questions to ask,\" he blurted out. \"I don't know how to go at it.\"  \"Why, what in the world is the matter, Jack? You were red a moment ago. Now you are as pale as a sheet.\"  \"I want to know about something awfully important.\"  \"I'm sure I cannot imagine what it is.\"  \"Marion, aren't we real sister and brother?\"  The question was out at last, and as he asked it his eyes dropped, for he had not the courage to look into her face. He felt her start and give a shiver.  \"Oh, Jack! what put that in your head,\" she said slowly.  \"Never mind that. Tell me, are we real sister and brother or not?\"  \"Jack, we are not.\"  \"Oh, Marion!\" The words almost choked him, and for the moment he could say no more.  \"We are not real sister and brother, Jack, but to me you will always be as a real brother,\" and Marion caught his hand and held it tightly.  \"And--and mother isn't my--my real mother?\" he faltered.  \"No, Jack; she is only your foster mother. But she thinks just as much of you as if you were her real son. She has told me that over and over again.\"  \"You are sure of this?\"  \"Yes, Jack.\"  \"Sure I am a--a nobody.\" His voice sunk to a mere whisper.  \"Yon are not a nobody, Jack. When you were a mere boy of three or four my father and mother adopted you, and you are now John Ruthven, my own brother,\" and she gave his brown hand another tight squeeze.  He was too confused and bewildered to answer at once. The dreadful news was true, he was not really a Ruthven. He was a nobody--no, he must be _somebody_. But who was he?     CHAPTER III.  A MYSTERY OF THE PAST.   \"I do not know that I have done just right by telling you this,\" went on Marion. \"Mother may not approve of it.\"  \"I am glad you told me. I was bound to find out about it, sooner or later.\"  \"That is true, Jack. But both mother and I dreaded that time. We were afraid you might turn from us. And we both love "]]]
