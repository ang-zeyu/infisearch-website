If Flame had never in her life admired the Lay Reader she certainly would have admired him now for the sheer cold-blooded foresight which had presaged the inevitable reaction of the dogs upon the mush and the mush upon the dogs. With a single sniff at his heels, a prod of paws in his stomach, the onslaught swerved--and passed. Guzzlingly from four separate corners of the room issued sounds of joy and fulfillment.  With an impulse quite surprising even to herself Flame thrust both hands into the Lay Reader's clasp.  \"You _are_ nice, aren't you?\" she quickened. In an instant of weakness one hand crept up to the blinding bandage, and recovered its honor as instantly. \"Oh, I do wish I _could_ see you,\" sighed Flame. \"You're so good-looking! Even Mother thinks you're _so_ good-looking!... Though she does get awfully worked up, of course, about your 'amorous eyes'!\"  \"Does your Mother think I've got ... 'amorous eyes'?\" asked the Lay Reader a bit tersely. Behind his spectacles as he spoke the orbs in question softened and glowed like some rare exotic bloom under glass. \"Does your Mother ... think I've got amorous eyes?\"  \"Oh, yes!\" said Flame.  \"And your Father?\" drawled the Lay Reader.  \"Why, Father says _of course_ you've got 'amorous eyes'!\" confided Flame with the faintest possible tinge of surprise at even being asked such a question. \"That's the funny thing about Mother and Father,\" chuckled Flame. \"They're always saying the same thing and meaning something entirely different by it. Why, when Mother says with her mouth all pursed up, 'I have every reason to believe that Mr. Lorello is engaged to the daughter of the Rector in his former Parish,' Father just puts back his head and howls, and says, 'Why, _of course_, Mr. Lorello is engaged to the daughter of the Rector in his former Parish! All Lay Readers....\"  In the sudden hush that ensued a faint sense of uneasiness flickered through Flame's shoulders.  \"Is it you that have hushed? Or the dogs?\" she asked.  \"The dogs,\" said the Lay Reader.  Very cautiously, absolutely honorably, Flame turned her back to the Lay Reader, and lifted the bandage just far enough to prove the Lay Reader's assertion.  Bulging with mush the four dogs lay at rest on rounding sides with limp legs straggling, or crouched like lions' heads on paws, with limpid eyes blinking above yawny mouths.  \"O--h,\" crooned Flame. \"How sweet! Only, of course, with what's to follow,\" she regretted thriftily, \"it's an awful waste of mush.... Excelsior warmed in the oven would have served just as well.\"  At the threat of a shadow across her eyeball she jerked the bandage back into place.  \"Now, Mr. Lorello,\" she suggested blithely, \"if you'll get the Bibles....\"  \"Bibles?\" stiffened the Lay Reader. \"Bibles? Why, really, Miss Flame, I couldn't countenance any sort of mock service! Even just for--for quaintness,--even for Christmas quaintness!\"  \"Mock service?\" puzzled Flame. \"Bibles?... Oh, I don't want you to preach out of 'em,\" she hastened perfectly amiably to explain. \"All I want them for is to plump-up the chairs.... The seats you see are too low for the dogs.... Oh, I suppose dictionaries would do,\" she compromised reluctantly. \"Only dictionaries are always so scarce.\"  Obediently the Lay Reader raked the parlor book-cases for \"plump-upable\" books. With real dexterity he built Chemistries on Sermons and Ancient Poems on Cook Books till the desired heights were reached.  For a single minute more Flame took another peep at the table.  \"Set a chair for yourself directly opposite me!\" she ordered. For sheer hilarious satisfaction her feet began to dance and her hands to clap. \"And whenever I really feel obliged to look,\" she sparkled, \"you'll just have to leave the table, that's all!... And now...?\" Appraisingly her muffled eye swept the shining vista. \"Perfect!\" she triumphed. \"Perfect!\" Then quite abruptly the eager mouth wilted. \"Why ... Why I've forgotten the carving knife and fork!\" she cried out in real distress. \"Oh, how stupid of me!\" Arduously, but without avail, she searched through all the drawers and cupboards of the Rattle-Pane kitchen. A single alternative occurred to her. \"You'll have to go over to my house and get them,--Mr. Lorello!\" she said. \"Were you ever in my kitchen? Or my pantry?\"  \"No,\" admitted the Lay Reader.  \"Well, you'll have to climb in through the window--someway,\" worried Flame. \"I've mislaid my key somewhere here among all these dishes and boxes. And the pantry,\" she explained very explicitly, \"is the third door on the right as you enter.... You'll see a chest of drawers. Open the second of 'em.... Or maybe you'd better look through all of them.... Only please ... please hurry!\" Imploringly the little head lifted.  \"If I hurry enough,\" said the Lay Reader quite impulsively, \"may I have a kiss when I get back?\"  \"A kiss?\" hooted Flame. In the curve of her cheek a dimple opened suddenly. \"Well ... maybe,\" said Flame.  As though the word were wings the Lay Reader snatched his hat and sped out into the night.  It was astonishing how all the warm housey air seemed to rush out with him, and all the shivery frost rush back.  A little bit listlessly Flame dragged down the bandage from her eyes.  \"It must be the creaks on the stairs that make it so awfully lonely all of a sudden,\" argued Flame. \"It must be because the dogs snore so.... No mere man could make it so empty.\" With a precipitous nudge of the memory she dashed to the door and helloed to the fast retreating figure. \"Oh, Bertrand! Bertrand!\" she called, \"I got sort of mixed up. It's the second door on the left! And if you don't find 'em there you'd better go up in Mother's room and turn out the silver chest! _Hurry_!\"  Rallying back to the bright Christmas kitchen for the real business at hand, an accusing blush rose to the young spot where the dimple had been.  \"Oh, Shucks!\" parried Flame. \"I kissed a Bishop before I was five!--What's a Lay Reader?\" As one humanely willing to condone the future as well as the past she rolled up her white sleeves without further introspection, and dragged out from the protecting shadow of the sink the \"humpiest box\" which had so excited her emotions at home in an earlier hour of the day. Cracklingly under her eager fingers the clumsy cover slid off, exposing once more to her enraptured gaze the gay-colored muslin layer of animal masks leering fatuously up at her.  Only with her hand across her mouth did she keep from crying out. Very swiftly her glance traveled from the grinning muslin faces before her to the solemn fur faces on the other side of the room. The hand across her mouth tightened.  \"Why, it's something like Creation,\" she giggled. \"This having to decide which face to give to which animal!\"  As expeditiously as possible she made her selection.  \"Poor Miss Flora must be so tired of being so plain,\" she thought. \"I'll give her the first choice of everything! Something really lovely! It can't help resting her!\"  With this kind idea in mind she selected for Miss Flora a canary's face.--Softly yellow! Bland as treacle! Its swelling, tender muslin throat fairly reeking with the suggestion of innocent song! No one gazing once upon such ornithological purity would ever speak a harsh word again, even to a sparrow!  Nudging Miss Flora cautiously from her sonorous nap, Flame beguiled her with half a doughnut to her appointed chair, boosted her still cautiously to her pinnacle of books, and with various swift adjustments of fasteners, knotting of tie-strings,--an extra breathing hole jabbed through the beak, slipped the canary's beautiful blond countenance over Miss Flora's frankly grizzled mug.  For a single terrifying instant Miss Flora's crinkled sides tightened,--a snarl like ripped silk slipped through her straining lungs. Then once convinced that the mask was not a gas-box she accepted the liberty with reasonable _sang-froid_ and sat blinking beadily out through the canary's yellow-rimmed eye-sockets with frank curiosity towards such proceedings as were about to follow. It was easy to see she was accustomed to sitting in chairs.  For the Wolf Hound Flame chose a Giraffe's head. Certain anatomical similarities seemed to make the choice wise. With a long vividly striped stockinet neck wrinkling like a mousquetaire glove, the neat small head that so closely fitted his own neat small head, the tweaked, interrogative ears,--Beautiful-Lovely, the Wolf Hound, reared up majestically in his own chair. He also, once convinced that the mask was not a gas-box, resigned himself to the inevitable, and corporeally independent of such vain props as Chemistries or Sermons, lolled his fine height against the mahogany chair-back.  To Blunder-Blot, the trim Dalmatian, Flame assigned the Parrot's head, arrogantly beaked, gorgeously variegated, altogether querulous.  For Lopsy, the crafty Setter, she selected a White Rabbit's artless, pink-eared visage.  Yet out of the whole box of masks it had been the Bengal Tiger's fiercely bewhiskered visage that had fascinated Flame the most. Regretfully from its more or less nondescript companions, she picked up the Bengal Tiger now and pulled at its real, bristle-whiskers. In one of the chairs a dog stirred quite irrelevantly. Cocking her own head towards the wood-shed Flame could not be perfectly sure whether she heard a twinge of cat or a twinge of conscience. The unflinching glare of the Bengal Tiger only served to increase her self-reproach.  \"After all,\" reasoned Flame, \"it would be easy enough to set another place! And pile a few extra books!... I'm almost sure I saw a black plush bag in the parlor.... If the cat could be put in something like a black plush bag,--something perfectly enveloping like that? So that not a single line of its--its figure could be observed?... And it had a new head given it? A perfectly sufficient head--like a Bengal Tiger?--I see no "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20213"],["title","Peace on Earth, Good-will to Dogs (#7)"],["body","why--\"  In five minutes the deed was accomplished. Its lovely sinuous \"figure\" reduced to the stolid contour of a black plush work-bag, its small uneasy head thrust into the roomy muslin cranium of the Bengal Tiger, the astonished Cat found herself slumping soggily on a great teetering pile of books, staring down as best she might through the Bengal Tiger's ear at the weirdest assemblage of animals which any domestic cat of her acquaintance had ever been forced to contemplate.  Coincidental with the appearance of the Cat a faint thrill passed through the rest of the company.... Nothing very much! No more, no less indeed, than passes through any company at the introduction of purely extraneous matter. From the empty plate which she had commandeered as a temporary pillow the Yellow Canary lifted an interrogative beak.... That was all! At Flame's left, the White-Haired Rabbit emitted an incongruous bark.... Scarcely worth reporting! Across the table the Giraffe thumped a white, plumy tail. Thoughtfully the Parrot's hooked nose slanted slightly to one side.  \"Oh, I wish Bertrand would come!\" fretted Flame. \"Maybe this time he'll notice my 'Christmas Crossing' sign!\" she chuckled with sudden triumph. \"Talk about surprises!\" Very diplomatically as she spoke she broke another doughnut in two and drew all the dogs' attention to herself. Almost hysterical with amusement she surveyed the scene before her. \"Well, at least we can have 'grace' before the Preacher comes!\" she laughed. A step on the gravel walk startled her suddenly. In a flash she had jerked down the blind-folding handkerchief across her eyes again, and folding her hands and the doughnut before her burst softly into paraphrase.      'Now we--sit us down to eat     Thrice our share of Flesh and Sweet.     If we should burst before we're through,     Oh what in--Dogdom shall we do?'  Thus it was that the Master of the House, returning unexpectedly to his unfamiliar domicile, stumbled upon a scene that might have shaken the reason of a less sober young man.  Startled first by the unwonted illumination from his kitchen windows, and second by the unprecedented aroma of Fir Balsam that greeted him even through the key-hole of his new front door, his feelings may well be imagined when groping through the dingy hall he first beheld the gallows-like structure reared in the kitchen doorway.  \"My God!\" he ejaculated, \"Barrett is getting ready to hang himself! Gone mad probably--or something!\"  Curdled with horror he forced himself to the object, only to note with convulsive relief but increasing bewilderment the cheerful phrasing and ultimate intent of the structure itself. \"'Christmas Crossing'?\" he repeated blankly. \"'Look out for Surprises'?--'Shop, Cook, and Glisten'?\" With his hand across his eyes he reeled back slightly against the wall. \"It is I that have gone mad!\" he gasped.  A little uncertain whether he was afraid of What-He-Was-About-to-See, or whether What-He-Was-About-to-See ought to be afraid of him, he craned his neck as best he could round the corner of the huge buffet that blocked the kitchen vista. A fresh bewilderment met his eyes. Where he had once seen cobwebs flapping grayly across the chimney-breast loomed now the gay worsted recommendation that _dogs specially_, should be considered in the Christmas Season. Throwing all caution aside he passed the buffet and plunged into the kitchen.  \"Oh, _do_ hurry!\" cried an eager young voice. \"I thought my hair would be white before you came!\"  Like a man paralyzed he stopped short in his tracks to stare at the scene before him! The long, bright table! The absolutely formal food! A blindfolded girl! A perfectly strange blindfolded girl ... with her dark hair forty years this side of white--_begging him to hurry_!... A Black Velvet Bag surmounted by a Tiger's head stirring strangely in a chair piled high with books!... Seated next to the Black Velvet Bag a Canary as big as a Turkey Gobbler!... A Giraffe stepping suddenly forward with--with dog-paws thrust into his soup plate!... A White Rabbit heavily wreathed in holly rousing cautiously from his cushions!... A Parrot with a twitching black and white short-haired tail!... An empty chair facing the Girl! _An empty chair facing the Girl._  \"If this is _madness_,\" thought Delcote quite precipitously, \"I am at least the Master of the Asylum!\"  In another instant, with a prodigious stride he had slipped into the vacant seat.  \"... So sorry to have kept you waiting,\" he murmured.  At the first sound of that unfamiliar voice, Flame yanked the handkerchief from her eyes, took one blank glance at the Stranger, and burst forth into a muffled, but altogether blood-curdling scream.  \"Oh ... Oh ... Owwwwwwww!\" said the scream.  As though waiting only for that one signal to break the spell of their enchantment, the Canary leaped upward and grabbed the Bengal Tiger by his muslin nose,--the White Rabbit sprang to \"point\" on the cooling turkey, and the Red and Green Parrot fell to the floor in a desperate effort to settle once and for all with the black spot that itched so impulsively on his left shoulder!  For a moment only, in comparative quiet, the Concerned struggled with the Concerned. Then true to all Dog Psychology,--absolutely indisputable, absolutely unalterable, the Non-Concerned leaped in upon the Non-Concerned! Half on his guard, but wholely on his itch, the jostled Parrot shot like a catapult across the floor! Lost to all sense of honor or table-manners the benign-faced Giraffe with his benign face still towering blandly in the air, burst through his own neck with a most curious anatomical effect,--locked his teeth in the Parrot's gay throat and rolled with him under the table in mortal combat!  Round and round the room spun the Yellow Canary and the Black Plush Bag!  Retreating as best she could from her muslin nose,--the Bengal Tiger or rather that which was within the Bengal Tiger, waged her war for Freedom! Ripping like a chicken through its shell she succeeded at last in hatching one front paw and one hind paw into action. Wallowing,--stumbling,--rolling,--yowling,--she humped from mantle-piece to chair-top, and from box to table.  Loyally the rabbit-eared Setter took up the chase. Mauled in the scuffle he ran with his meek face upside down! Lost to all reason, defiant of all morale, he proceeded to flush the game!  Dish-pans clattered, stools tipped over, pictures banged on the walls!  From her terrorized perch on the back of her chair Flame watched the fracas with dilated eyes.  Hunched in the hug of his own arms the Stranger sat rocking himself to and fro in uncontrollable, choking mirth,--\"ribald mirth\" was what Flame called it.  \"Stop!\" she begged. \"Stop it! Somebody _stop_ it!\"  It was not until the Black Plush Bag at bay had ripped a red streak down Miss Flora's avid nose that the Stranger rose to interfere.  Very definitely then, with quick deeds, incisive words, he separated the immediate combatants, and ordered the other dogs into submission.  \"Here you, Demon Direful!\" he addressed the white Wolf Hound. \"Drop that, Orion!\" he shouted to the Irish Setter. \"Cut it out, John!\" he thundered at the Coach Dog.  \"Their names are 'Beautiful-Lovely'!\" cried Flame. \"And 'Lopsy!' and 'Blunder-Blot!'\"  With his hand on the Wolf Hound's collar, the Stranger stopped and stared up with frank astonishment, not to say resentment, at the girl's interference.  \"Their names are _what_?\" he said.  Something in the special intonation of the question infuriated Flame.... Maybe she thought his mouth scornful,--his narrowing eyes...? Goodness knows what she thought of his suddenly narrowing eyes!  In an instant she had jumped from her retreat to the floor.  \"Who are you, anyway?\" she demanded. \"How dare you come here like this? Butting into my party!... And--and spoiling my discipline with the dogs! Who are you, I say?\"  With Demon Direful, alias Beautiful-Lovely tugging wildly at his restraint, the Stranger's scornful mouth turned precipitously up, instead of down.  \"Who am I?\" he said. \"Why, no one special at all except just--the Master of the House!\"  \"_What_?\" gasped Flame.  \"Earle Delcote,\" bowed the Stranger.  With a little hand that trembled perfectly palpably Flame reached back to the arm of the big carved chair for support.  \"Why--why, but Mr. Delcote is an old man,\" she gasped. \"I'm almost sure he's an old man.\"  The smile on Delcote's mouth spread suddenly to his eyes.  \"Not yet,--Thank God!\" he bowed.  With a panic-stricken glance at doors, windows, cracks, the chimney pipe itself, Flame sank limply down in her seat again and gestured towards the empty place opposite her.  \"Have a--have a chair,\" she stammered. Great tears welled suddenly to her eyes. \"Oh, I--I know I oughtn't to be here,\" she struggled. \"It's perfectly ... awful! I haven't the slightest right! Not the slightest! It's the--the cheekiest thing that any girl in the world ever did!... But your Butler said...! And he did so want to go away and--And I did so love your dogs! And I did so want to make _one_ Christmas in the world just--exactly the way I wanted it! And--and--Mother and Father will be crazy!... And--and--\"  Without a single glance at anything except herself, the Master of the House slipped back into his chair.  \"Have a heart!\" he said.  Flame did _not_ accept this suggestion. With a very severe frown and downcast eyes she sat staring at the table. It seemed a very cheerless table suddenly, with all the dogs in various stages of disheveled finery grouped blatantly around their Master's chair.  \"I can at least have my cat,\" she thought, \"my--faithful cat!\" In another instant she had slipped from the table, extracted poor Puss from a clutter of pans in the back of a cupboard, stripped the last shred of masquerade from her outraged form, and brought her back growling and bristling to perch on one arm of the high-backed chair. \"Th--ere!\" said Flame.
