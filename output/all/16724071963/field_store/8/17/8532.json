At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him: they shone their torch on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided him. “Zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog: a fine thing that Zarathustra hath turned a grave-digger! For our hands are too cleanly for that roast. Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil? Well then, good luck to the repast! If only the devil is not a better thief than Zarathustra!--he will steal them both, he will eat them both!” And they laughed among themselves, and put their heads together.  Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way. When he had gone on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of the hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry. So he halted at a lonely house in which a light was burning.  “Hunger attacketh me,” said Zarathustra, “like a robber. Among forests and swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.  “Strange humours hath my hunger. Often it cometh to me only after a repast, and all day it hath failed to come: where hath it been?”  And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house. An old man appeared, who carried a light, and asked: “Who cometh unto me and my bad sleep?”  “A living man and a dead one,” said Zarathustra. “Give me something to eat and drink, I forgot it during the day. He that feedeth the hungry refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.”  The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered Zarathustra bread and wine. “A bad country for the hungry,” said he; “that is why I live here. Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite. But bid thy companion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.” Zarathustra answered: “My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him to eat.” “That doth not concern me,” said the old man sullenly; “he that knocketh at my door must take what I offer him. Eat, and fare ye well!”--  Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the path and the light of the stars: for he was an experienced night-walker, and liked to look into the face of all that slept. When the morning dawned, however, Zarathustra found himself in a thick forest, and no path was any longer visible. He then put the dead man in a hollow tree at his head--for he wanted to protect him from the wolves--and laid himself down on the ground and moss. And immediately he fell asleep, tired in body, but with a tranquil soul.  9.  Long slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed over his head, but also the morning. At last, however, his eyes opened, and amazedly he gazed into the forest and the stillness, amazedly he gazed into himself. Then he arose quickly, like a seafarer who all at once seeth the land; and he shouted for joy: for he saw a new truth. And he spake thus to his heart:  A light hath dawned upon me: I need companions--living ones; not dead companions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.  But I need living companions, who will follow me because they want to follow themselves--and to the place where I will.  A light hath dawned upon me. Not to the people is Zarathustra to speak, but to companions! Zarathustra shall not be the herd’s herdsman and hound!  To allure many from the herd--for that purpose have I come. The people and the herd must be angry with me: a robber shall Zarathustra be called by the herdsmen.  Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just. Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief.  Behold the good and just! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker:--he, however, is the creator.  Behold the believers of all beliefs! Whom do they hate most? Him who breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker--he, however, is the creator.  Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses--and not herds or believers either. Fellow-creators the creator seeketh--those who grave new values on new tables.  Companions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers: for everything is ripe for the harvest with him. But he lacketh the hundred sickles: so he plucketh the ears of corn and is vexed.  Companions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to whet their sickles. Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers of good and evil. But they are the reapers and rejoicers.  Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and fellow-rejoicers, Zarathustra seeketh: what hath he to do with herds and herdsmen and corpses!  And thou, my first companion, rest in peace! Well have I buried thee in thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.  But I part from thee; the time hath arrived. ‘Twixt rosy dawn and rosy dawn there came unto me a new truth.  I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger. Not any more will I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto the dead.  With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate: the rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.  To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers; and unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart heavy with my happiness.  I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy will I leap. Thus let my on-going be their down-going!  10.  This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noon-tide. Then he looked inquiringly aloft,--for he heard above him the sharp call of a bird. And behold! An eagle swept through the air in wide circles, and on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend: for it kept itself coiled round the eagle’s neck.  “They are mine animals,” said Zarathustra, and rejoiced in his heart.  “The proudest animal under the sun, and the wisest animal under the sun,--they have come out to reconnoitre.  They want to know whether Zarathustra still liveth. Verily, do I still live?  More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in dangerous paths goeth Zarathustra. Let mine animals lead me!”  When Zarathustra had said this, he remembered the words of the saint in the forest. Then he sighed and spake thus to his heart:  “Would that I were wiser! Would that I were wise from the very heart, like my serpent!  But I am asking the impossible. Therefore do I ask my pride to go always with my wisdom!  And if my wisdom should some day forsake me:--alas! it loveth to fly away!--may my pride then fly with my folly!”  Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going.     ZARATHUSTRA’S DISCOURSES.     I. THE THREE METAMORPHOSES.  Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.  Many heavy things are there for the spirit, the strong load-bearing spirit in which reverence dwelleth: for the heavy and the heaviest longeth its strength.  What is heavy? so asketh the load-bearing spirit; then kneeleth it down like the camel, and wanteth to be well laden.  What is the heaviest thing, ye heroes? asketh the load-bearing spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.  Is it not this: To humiliate oneself in order to mortify one’s pride? To exhibit one’s folly in order to mock at one’s wisdom?  Or is it this: To desert our cause when it celebrateth its triumph? To ascend high mountains to tempt the tempter?  Or is it this: To feed on the acorns and grass of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?  Or is it this: To be sick and dismiss comforters, and make friends of the deaf, who never hear thy requests?  Or is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim cold frogs and hot toads?  Or is it this: To love those who despise us, and give one’s hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?  All these heaviest things the load-bearing spirit taketh upon itself: and like the camel, which, when laden, hasteneth into the wilderness, so hasteneth the spirit into its wilderness.  But in the loneliest wilderness happeneth the second metamorphosis: here the spirit becometh a lion; freedom will it capture, and lordship in its own wilderness.  Its last Lord it here seeketh: hostile will it be to him, and to its last God; for victory will it struggle with the great dragon.  What is the great dragon which the spirit is no longer inclined to call Lord and God? “Thou-shalt,” is the great dragon called. But the spirit of the lion saith, “I will.”  “Thou-shalt,” lieth in its path, sparkling with gold--a scale-covered beast; and on every scale glittereth golden, “Thou shalt!”  The values of a thousand years glitter on those scales, and thus speaketh the mightiest of all dragons: “All the values of things--glitter on me.  All values have already been created, and all created values--do I represent. Verily, there shall be no ‘I will’ any more.” Thus speaketh the dragon.  My brethren, wherefore is there need of the lion in the spirit? Why sufficeth not the beast of burden, which renounceth and is reverent?  To create new values--that, even the lion cannot yet accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating--that can the might of the lion do.  To create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty: for that, my brethren, there is need of the lion.  To assume the right to new values--that is the most formidable assumption for a load-bearing and reverent spirit. Verily, unto such a spirit it is preying, and the work of a beast of prey.  As its holiest, it once loved “Thou-shalt”: now is it forced to find illusion and arbitrariness even in the holiest things, that it may capture freedom from its love: the lion is needed for this capture.  But tell me, my brethren, what the child can do, which even the lion could not do? Why hath the preying "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1998"],["title","Thus Spake Zarathustra: A Book for All and None (#6)"],["body","still to become a child?  Innocence is the child, and forgetfulness, a new beginning, a game, a self-rolling wheel, a first movement, a holy Yea.  Aye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life: ITS OWN will, willeth now the spirit; HIS OWN world winneth the world’s outcast.  Three metamorphoses of the spirit have I designated to you: how the spirit became a camel, the camel a lion, and the lion at last a child.--  Thus spake Zarathustra. And at that time he abode in the town which is called The Pied Cow.     II. THE ACADEMIC CHAIRS OF VIRTUE.  People commended unto Zarathustra a wise man, as one who could discourse well about sleep and virtue: greatly was he honoured and rewarded for it, and all the youths sat before his chair. To him went Zarathustra, and sat among the youths before his chair. And thus spake the wise man:  Respect and modesty in presence of sleep! That is the first thing! And to go out of the way of all who sleep badly and keep awake at night!  Modest is even the thief in presence of sleep: he always stealeth softly through the night. Immodest, however, is the night-watchman; immodestly he carrieth his horn.  No small art is it to sleep: it is necessary for that purpose to keep awake all day.  Ten times a day must thou overcome thyself: that causeth wholesome weariness, and is poppy to the soul.  Ten times must thou reconcile again with thyself; for overcoming is bitterness, and badly sleep the unreconciled.  Ten truths must thou find during the day; otherwise wilt thou seek truth during the night, and thy soul will have been hungry.  Ten times must thou laugh during the day, and be cheerful; otherwise thy stomach, the father of affliction, will disturb thee in the night.  Few people know it, but one must have all the virtues in order to sleep well. Shall I bear false witness? Shall I commit adultery?  Shall I covet my neighbour’s maidservant? All that would ill accord with good sleep.  And even if one have all the virtues, there is still one thing needful: to send the virtues themselves to sleep at the right time.  That they may not quarrel with one another, the good females! And about thee, thou unhappy one!  Peace with God and thy neighbour: so desireth good sleep. And peace also with thy neighbour’s devil! Otherwise it will haunt thee in the night.  Honour to the government, and obedience, and also to the crooked government! So desireth good sleep. How can I help it, if power like to walk on crooked legs?  He who leadeth his sheep to the greenest pasture, shall always be for me the best shepherd: so doth it accord with good sleep.  Many honours I want not, nor great treasures: they excite the spleen. But it is bad sleeping without a good name and a little treasure.  A small company is more welcome to me than a bad one: but they must come and go at the right time. So doth it accord with good sleep.  Well, also, do the poor in spirit please me: they promote sleep. Blessed are they, especially if one always give in to them.  Thus passeth the day unto the virtuous. When night cometh, then take I good care not to summon sleep. It disliketh to be summoned--sleep, the lord of the virtues!  But I think of what I have done and thought during the day. Thus ruminating, patient as a cow, I ask myself: What were thy ten overcomings?  And what were the ten reconciliations, and the ten truths, and the ten laughters with which my heart enjoyed itself?  Thus pondering, and cradled by forty thoughts, it overtaketh me all at once--sleep, the unsummoned, the lord of the virtues.  Sleep tappeth on mine eye, and it turneth heavy. Sleep toucheth my mouth, and it remaineth open.  Verily, on soft soles doth it come to me, the dearest of thieves, and stealeth from me my thoughts: stupid do I then stand, like this academic chair.  But not much longer do I then stand: I already lie.--  When Zarathustra heard the wise man thus speak, he laughed in his heart: for thereby had a light dawned upon him. And thus spake he to his heart:  A fool seemeth this wise man with his forty thoughts: but I believe he knoweth well how to sleep.  Happy even is he who liveth near this wise man! Such sleep is contagious--even through a thick wall it is contagious.  A magic resideth even in his academic chair. And not in vain did the youths sit before the preacher of virtue.  His wisdom is to keep awake in order to sleep well. And verily, if life had no sense, and had I to choose nonsense, this would be the desirablest nonsense for me also.  Now know I well what people sought formerly above all else when they sought teachers of virtue. Good sleep they sought for themselves, and poppy-head virtues to promote it!  To all those belauded sages of the academic chairs, wisdom was sleep without dreams: they knew no higher significance of life.  Even at present, to be sure, there are some like this preacher of virtue, and not always so honourable: but their time is past. And not much longer do they stand: there they already lie.  Blessed are those drowsy ones: for they shall soon nod to sleep.--  Thus spake Zarathustra.     III. BACKWORLDSMEN.  Once on a time, Zarathustra also cast his fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen. The work of a suffering and tortured God, did the world then seem to me.  The dream--and diction--of a God, did the world then seem to me; coloured vapours before the eyes of a divinely dissatisfied one.  Good and evil, and joy and woe, and I and thou--coloured vapours did they seem to me before creative eyes. The creator wished to look away from himself,--thereupon he created the world.  Intoxicating joy is it for the sufferer to look away from his suffering and forget himself. Intoxicating joy and self-forgetting, did the world once seem to me.  This world, the eternally imperfect, an eternal contradiction’s image and imperfect image--an intoxicating joy to its imperfect creator:--thus did the world once seem to me.  Thus, once on a time, did I also cast my fancy beyond man, like all backworldsmen. Beyond man, forsooth?  Ah, ye brethren, that God whom I created was human work and human madness, like all the Gods!  A man was he, and only a poor fragment of a man and ego. Out of mine own ashes and glow it came unto me, that phantom. And verily, it came not unto me from the beyond!  What happened, my brethren? I surpassed myself, the suffering one; I carried mine own ashes to the mountain; a brighter flame I contrived for myself. And lo! Thereupon the phantom WITHDREW from me!  To me the convalescent would it now be suffering and torment to believe in such phantoms: suffering would it now be to me, and humiliation. Thus speak I to backworldsmen.  Suffering was it, and impotence--that created all backworlds; and the short madness of happiness, which only the greatest sufferer experienceth.  Weariness, which seeketh to get to the ultimate with one leap, with a death-leap; a poor ignorant weariness, unwilling even to will any longer: that created all Gods and backworlds.  Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the body--it groped with the fingers of the infatuated spirit at the ultimate walls.  Believe me, my brethren! It was the body which despaired of the earth--it heard the bowels of existence speaking unto it.  And then it sought to get through the ultimate walls with its head--and not with its head only--into “the other world.”  But that “other world” is well concealed from man, that dehumanised, inhuman world, which is a celestial naught; and the bowels of existence do not speak unto man, except as man.  Verily, it is difficult to prove all being, and hard to make it speak. Tell me, ye brethren, is not the strangest of all things best proved?  Yea, this ego, with its contradiction and perplexity, speaketh most uprightly of its being--this creating, willing, evaluing ego, which is the measure and value of things.  And this most upright existence, the ego--it speaketh of the body, and still implieth the body, even when it museth and raveth and fluttereth with broken wings.  Always more uprightly learneth it to speak, the ego; and the more it learneth, the more doth it find titles and honours for the body and the earth.  A new pride taught me mine ego, and that teach I unto men: no longer to thrust one’s head into the sand of celestial things, but to carry it freely, a terrestrial head, which giveth meaning to the earth!  A new will teach I unto men: to choose that path which man hath followed blindly, and to approve of it--and no longer to slink aside from it, like the sick and perishing!  The sick and perishing--it was they who despised the body and the earth, and invented the heavenly world, and the redeeming blood-drops; but even those sweet and sad poisons they borrowed from the body and the earth!  From their misery they sought escape, and the stars were too remote for them. Then they sighed: “O that there were heavenly paths by which to steal into another existence and into happiness!” Then they contrived for themselves their by-paths and bloody draughts!  Beyond the sphere of their body and this earth they now fancied themselves transported, these ungrateful ones. But to what did they owe the convulsion and rapture of their transport? To their body and this earth.  Gentle is Zarathustra to the sickly. Verily, he is not indignant at their modes of consolation and ingratitude. May they become convalescents and overcomers, and create higher bodies for themselves!  Neither is Zarathustra indignant at a convalescent who looketh tenderly on his delusions, and at midnight stealeth round the grave of his God; but sickness and a sick frame remain even in his tears.  Many sickly ones have there always been among those who muse, and languish for God; violently they hate the discerning ones, and the latest of virtues, which is uprightness.  Backward they always gaze toward dark ages: then, indeed, were delusion and faith something different. Raving of the reason was"]]]
