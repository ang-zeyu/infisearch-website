They were both nobly born, and nobly married; and yet the elder was joined to a man, who, to say the very least, shared his love for her with another; and the younger, though requiring, every year of her married state, all the attention and comfort and support of an affectionate husband, yet was more than once left to experience a temporary widowhood. And if we withdraw our thoughts from those of whom this family was then deprived, there is little to lessen our estimate of their loss, when we think of those whom they left behind. Henry's maternal grandmother, indeed, the Countess of Hereford, survived her daughter many years; and we are not without an intimation that she at least interested herself in her grandson's welfare. In his will, dated 1415, he bequeaths to Thomas, Bishop of Durham, \"the missal and portiphorium[18] which we had of the gift of our dear grandmother, the Countess of Hereford.\"[19] We may fairly infer from this circumstance that Henry had at least one    (p. 019) near relation both able and willing to guide him in the right way. How far opportunities were afforded her of exercising her maternal feelings towards him, cannot now be ascertained; and with the exception of this noble lady, there is no other to whom we can turn with entire satisfaction, when we contemplate the salutary effects either of precept or example in the case of Henry of Monmouth.                     [Footnote 18: The portiphorium was a breviary,                    containing directions as to the services of the                    church.]                     [Footnote 19: He bequeaths also, in the same will,                    \"to Joan, Countess of Hereford, our dear                    grandmother, a gold cyphus.\" This lady, however,                    died before Henry. In the Pell Rolls we find the                    payment of \"442_l._ 17_s._ 5_d._ to Robert Darcy                    and others, executors of Joan de Bohun, late                    Countess of Hereford, on account of live and dead                    stock belonging to her, February 27, 1421.\"]  His father indeed was a gallant young knight, often distinguishing himself at justs and tournaments;[20] of an active, ardent and enterprising spirit; nor is any imputation against his moral character found recorded. But we have no ground for believing, that he devoted much of his time and thoughts to the education of his children.                     [Footnote 20: Soon after Henry IV's accession, the                    Pell Rolls, May 8, 1401, record the payment of                    \"10_l._ to Bertolf Vander Eure, who fenced with the                    present lord the King with the long sword, and was                    hurt in the neck by the said lord the King.\" The                    Chronicle of London for 1386 says \"there were                    joustes at Smithfield. There bare him well Sir                    Harry of Derby, the Duke's son of Lancaster.\"]  Henry Beaufort, the natural son of John of Gaunt, a person of commanding talent, and of considerable attainments for that age, whilst there is no reason to believe him to have been that abandoned worldling whose eyes finally closed in black despair without a     (p. 020) hope of Heaven, yet was not the individual to whose training a Christian parent would willingly intrust the education of his child. And in John of Gaunt[21] himself, little perhaps can be discovered either in principle, or judgment, or conduct, which his grandson could imitate with religious and moral profit. Thus we find Henry of Monmouth in his childhood labouring under many disadvantages. Still our knowledge of the domestic arrangements and private circumstances of his family is confessedly very limited; and it would be unwise to conclude that there were no mitigating causes in operation, nor any advantages to put as a counterpoise into the opposite scale. He may have been under the guidance and tuition of a good Christian and   (p. 021) well-informed man; he may have been surrounded by companions whose acquaintance would be a blessing. But this is all conjecture; and probably the question is now beyond the reach of any satisfactory solution.                     [Footnote 21: The Author would gladly have                    presented to the reader a different portrait of the                    religious and moral character of \"Old John of                    Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster;\" but a careful                    examination of the testimony of his enemies and of                    his eulogists, as well as of the authentic                    documents of his own household, seems to leave no                    other alternative, short of the sacrifice of truth.                    Godwin, in his Life of Chaucer, has undertaken his                    defence, but on such unsound principles of morality                    as must be reprobated by every true lover of                    Religion and Virtue. The same domestic register of                    the Duchy which records the wages paid to the                    adulteress, and the duke's losses by gambling,                    proves (as many other family accounts would prove)                    that no fortune however princely can supply the                    unbounded demands of profligacy and dissipation.                    Even John of Gaunt, with his immense possessions,                    was driven to borrow money. This fact is                    accompanied in the record by the curious                    circumstance, that an order is given for the                    employment of three or four stout yeomen, because                    of the danger of the road, to guard the bearers of                    a loan made by the Earl of Arundel to the Duke, and                    sent from Shrewsbury to London.]  With regard to the next step also in young Henry's progress towards manhood, we equally depend upon tradition for the views which we may be induced to take: still it is a tradition in which we shall probably acquiesce without great danger of error. He is said to have been sent to Oxford, and to have studied in \"The Queen's College\" under the tuition of Henry Beaufort, his paternal uncle, then Chancellor of the University. No document is known to exist among the archives of the College or of the University, which can throw any light on this point; except that the fact has been established of Henry Beaufort having been admitted a member of Queen's College, and of his having been chancellor of the university only for the year 1398.  This extraordinary man was consecrated Bishop of Lincoln, July 14, 1398, as appears by the Episcopal Register of that See; after which he did not reside in Oxford. If therefore Henry of Monmouth studied under him in that university, it must have been through the spring and summer of that year, the eleventh of his age. And on this we may rely as the most probable fact. Certainly in the old buildings of Queen's College, a chamber used to be pointed out by successive generations as Henry the Fifth's. It stood over the gateway opposite to St.       (p. 022) Edmund's Hall. A portrait of him in painted glass, commemorative of the circumstance, was seen in the window, with an inscription (as it should seem of comparatively recent date) in Latin:          To record the fact for ever.          The Emperor of Britain,        The Triumphant Lord of France,  The Conqueror of his enemies and of himself,                 Henry V.           Of this little chamber,         Once the great Inhabitant.[22]                     [Footnote 22: Fuller in his Church History, having                    informed us that Henry's chamber over the College                    gate was then inhabited by the historian's friend                    Thomas Barlow, adds \"His picture remaineth there to                    this day in _brass_\".]  It may be observed that in the tender age of Henry involved in this supposition, there is nothing in the least calculated to throw a shade of improbability on this uniform tradition. Many in those days became members of the university at the time of life when they would now be sent to school.[23] And possibly we shall be most right in supposing that Henry (though perhaps without himself being enrolled among the regular academics) lived with his uncle, then chancellor, and studied under his superintendence. There is nothing on record (hitherto    (p. 023) discovered) in the slightest degree inconsistent with this view; whereas if we were inclined to adopt the representation of some (on what authority it does not appear) that Henry was sent to Oxford soon after his father ascended the throne, many and serious difficulties would present themselves. In the first place his uncle, who was legitimated only the year before, was prematurely made Bishop of Lincoln by the Pope, through the interest of John of Gaunt, in the year 1398, and never resided in Oxford afterwards. How old he was at his consecration, has not yet been satisfactorily established; conjecture would lead us to regard him as a few years only (perhaps ten or twelve) older than his nephew. Otterbourne tells us that he was made Bishop[24] when yet a boy.                     [Footnote 23: Those who were designed for the                    military profession were compelled to bear arms,                    and go to the field at the age of fifteen:                    consequently the little education they received was                    confined to their boyhood.]                     [Footnote 24: \"Admodum parvo.\"]  In the next place we can scarcely discover six months in Henry's life after his uncle's consecration, through which we can with equal probability suppose him to have passed his time in Oxford. It is next to certain that before the following October term, he had been removed into King"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20488"],["title","Henry of Monmouth, Volume 1 (#7)"],["body","chard's palace, carefully watched (as we shall see hereafter); whilst in the spring of the following year, 1399, he was unquestionably obliged to accompany that monarch in his expedition to Ireland. Shortly after his return, in the autumn of that year, on his father's accession to the throne, he was created Prince of Wales; and through the following spring the probability is strong that his father was too anxiously engaged in negotiating a marriage between him    (p. 024) and a daughter of the French King, and too deeply interested in providing for him an adequate establishment in the metropolis, to take any measures for improving and cultivating his mind in the university. Independently of which we may be fully assured that had he become a student of the University of Oxford as Prince of Wales, it would not have been left to chance, to deliver his name down to after-ages: the archives of the University would have furnished direct and contemporary evidence of so remarkable a fact; and the College would have with pride enrolled him at the time among its members: as the boy of the Earl of Derby, or the Duke of Hereford, living with his uncle, there is nothing[25] in the omission of his name inconsistent with our hypothesis. At all events, whatever evidence exists of Henry having resided under any circumstances in Oxford, fixes him there under the tuition of the future Cardinal; and that well-known personage is proved not to have resided there subsequently to his appointment to the see[26] of Lincoln, in the summer of 1398.[27]                     [Footnote 25: On the 29th of the preceding                    September 1397, Richard II. \"with the consent of                    the prelates, lords and commons in parliament                    assembled,\" created Bolinbroke, then Earl of Derby,                    Duke of Hereford, with a royal gift of forty marks                    by the year, to him and his heirs for ever. Pell                    Rolls. Pasc. 22 R. II. April 15.]                     [Footnote 26: The Lincoln register (for a copy of                    which the Author is indebted to the present Bishop)                    dates the commencement of the year of Henry                    Beaufort's consecration from July 14, 1398.]                     [Footnote 27: It is a curious fact, not generally                    known, that Henry IV. in the _first_ year of his                    reign took possession of all the property of the                    Provost and Fellows of Queen's College (on the                    ground of mismanagement), and appointed the                    Chancellor, the Chief Justice, the Master of the                    Rolls, and others, guardians of the College. This                    is scarcely consistent with the supposition of his                    son being resident there at the time, or of his                    selecting that college for him afterwards.]  What were Henry's studies in Oxford, whether, like Ingulphus some  (p. 025) centuries before, he drank to his fill of \"Aristotle's[28] Philosophy and Cicero's Rhetoric,\" or whether his mind was chiefly directed to the scholastic theology so prevalent in his day, it were fruitless (p. 026) to inquire. His uncle (as we have already intimated) seems to have been a person of some learning, an excellent man of business, and in the command of a ready eloquence. In establishing his positions    (p. 027) before the parliament, we find him not only quoting from the Bible, (often, it must be acknowledged, without any strict propriety of application,) but also citing facts from ancient Grecian history. We may, however, safely conclude that the Chancellor of Oxford confined himself to the general superintendence of his nephew's education, intrusting the details to others more competent to instruct him in the various branches of literature. It is very probable that to some arrangement of that kind Henry was indebted for his acquaintance with such excellent men as his friends John Carpenter of Oriel, and Thomas Rodman, or Rodburn, of Merton.[29]                     [Footnote 28: The Author trusts to be pardoned, if                    he suffers these conjectures on Henry's studies in                    Oxford to tempt him to digress in this note further                    than the strict rules of unity might approve. They                    brought a lively image to his mind of the                    occupations and confessions of one of the earliest                    known sons of Alma Mater. Perhaps Ingulphus is the                    first upon record who, having laid the foundation                    of his learning at Westminster, proceeded for its                    further cultivation to Oxford. From the                    biographical sketch of his own life, we learn that                    he was born of English parents and a native of the                    fair city of London. Whilst a schoolboy at                    Westminster, he was so happy as to have interested                    in his behalf Egitha, daughter of Earl Godwin, and                    queen of Edward the Confessor. He describes his                    patroness as a lady of great beauty, well versed in                    literature, of most pure chastity and exalted moral                    feeling, together with pious humbleness of mind,                    tainted by no spot of her father's or her brother's                    barbarism, but mild and modest, honest and                    faithful, and the enemy of no human being. In                    confirmation of his estimate of her excellence, he                    quotes a Latin verse current in his day, not very                    complimentary to her sire: \"As a thorn is the                    parent of the rose, so was Godwin of Egitha.\" I                    have often seen her (he continues) when I have been                    visiting my father in the palace. Many a time, as                    she met me on my return from school, would she                    examine me in my scholarship and verses; and                    turning with the most perfect familiarity from the                    solidity of grammar to the playfulness of logic, in                    which she was well skilled, when she had caught me                    and held me fast by some subtle chain, she would                    always direct her maid to give me three or four                    pieces of money, and sending me off to the royal                    refectory would dismiss me after my refreshment.\"                    It is possible that many of our fair countrywomen                    in the highest ranks now, are not aware that, more                    than eight hundred years ago, their fair and noble                    predecessors could play with a Westminster scholar                    in grammar, verses, and logic. Egitha left behind                    her an example of high religious, moral, and                    literary worth, by imitating which, not perhaps in                    its literal application, but certainly in its                    spirit, the noble born among us will best uphold                    and adorn their high station. Ingulphus (in the                    very front of whose work the Author thinks he sees                    the stamp of raciness and originality, though he                    cannot here enter into the question of its                    genuineness) tells us then, how he made proficiency                    beyond many of his equals in mastering the                    doctrines of Aristotle, and covered himself to the                    very ankles in Cicero's Rhetoric. But, alas, for                    the vanity of human nature! His confession here                    might well suggest reflections of practical wisdom                    to many a young man who may be tempted, as was                    Ingulphus, in the university or the wide world, to                    neglect and despise his father's roof and his                    father's person, after success in the world may                    have raised him in society above the humble station                    of his birth,--a station from which perhaps the                    very struggles and privations of that parent                    himself may have enabled him to emerge. \"Growing up                    a young man (he says) I felt a sort of disdainful                    loathing at the straitened and lowly circumstances                    of my parents, and desired to leave my paternal                    hearth, hankering after the halls of kings and of                    the great, and daily longing more and more to array                    myself in the gayest and most luxurious costume.\"                    Ingulphus lived to repent, and to be ashamed of his                    weakness and folly.]                     [Footnote 29: John Carpenter. This learned and good                    man could not have been much, if at all, Henry's                    senior. He was made Bishop of Worcester (not as                    Goodwin says by Henry V. but) in the year 1443. He                    died in 1476; so that if he was in Oxford when we                    suppose Henry to have studied there and to have                    been only his equal in age, he would have been                    nearly ninety when he died. Thomas Rodman was an                    eminent astronomer as well as a learned divine, of                    Merton College. He was not promoted to a bishopric                    till two years after Henry's death.                     Among other learned and pious men who were much                    esteemed by Henry, we find especially mentioned                    Robert Mascall, confessor to his father, and                    Stephen Partington. The latter was a very popular             "]]]
