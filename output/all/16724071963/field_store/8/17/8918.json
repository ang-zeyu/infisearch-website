Thus he explains the absence of external (projecting) ears in birds and reptiles by the fact that their skin is hard and does not easily take on the form of an external ear (_De Partibus_, ii, 12). The fact of the inverse correlation is certain; the explanation is, though very vague, probably correct.  In one passage of the _De Partibus_ Aristotle clearly enunciates the principle of the division of labour, afterwards emphasised by H. Milne-Edwards. In some insects, he says, the proboscis combines the functions of a tongue and a sting, in others the tongue and the sting are quite separate. \"Now it is better,\" he goes on, \"that one and the same instrument shall not be made to serve several dissimilar ends; but that there shall be one organ to serve as a weapon, which can then be very sharp, and a distinct one to serve as a tongue, which can then be of spongy texture and fit to absorb nutriment. Whenever, therefore, Nature is able to provide two separate instruments for two separate uses, without the one hampering the other, she does so, instead of acting like a coppersmith who for cheapness makes a spit and lampholder in one\" (iv., 6, 683^a).  (5) The first sentence of the _Historia Animalium_ formulates, with that simplicity and directness which is so characteristic of Aristotle, the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous parts, in the mass the distinction between tissues and organs. \"Some parts of animals are simple, and these can be divided into like parts, as flesh into pieces of flesh; others are compound, and cannot be divided into like parts, as the hand cannot be divided into hands, nor the face into faces. All the compound parts also are made up of simple parts--the hand, for example, of flesh and sinew and bone\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit_., p. I).  In the _De Partibus Animalium_ he broadens the conception by adding another form of composition. \"Now there are,\" he says, \"three degrees of composition; and of these the first in order, as all will allow, is composition out of what some call the elements, such as earth, air, water, fire.... The second degree of composition is that by which the homogeneous parts of animals, such as bone, flesh, and the like, are constituted out of the primary substances. The third and last stage is the composition which forms the heterogeneous parts, such as face, hand, and the rest\" (ii., 1, 646^a, trans. Ogle).  In the _Historia Animalium_ the homogeneous parts are divided into (1) the soft and moist (or fluid), such as blood, serum, flesh, fat, suet, marrow, semen, gall, milk, phlegm, fæces and urine, and (2) the hard and dry (or solid), such as sinew, vein, hair, bone, cartilage, nail, and horn. It would appear from this enumeration that Aristotle's distinction of simple and complex parts does not altogether coincide with our distinction of tissues and organs. We should not call vein a tissue, nor do we include under this heading non-living secretions. But in the _De Partibus Animalium_ Aristotle, while still holding to the distinction set forth above, is alive to the fact that his simple parts include several different sorts of substances. He distinguishes among the homogeneous parts three sets. The first of these comprises the tissues out of which the heterogeneous parts are constructed, _e.g._, flesh and bone; the second set form the nutriment of the parts, and are invariably fluid; while the third set are the residue of the second and constitute the residual excretions of the body (ii., 2, 647^b). He sees clearly the difficulty of calling vein or blood-vessel a simple part, for while a bloodvessel and a part of it are both blood-vessel, as we should say vascular tissue, yet a part of a blood-vessel is not a bloodvessel. There is form superadded to homogeneity of structure (ii., 2, 647^b). Similarly for the heart and the other viscera. \"The heart, like the other viscera, is one of the homogeneous parts; for, if cut up, its pieces are homogeneous in substance with each other. But it is at the same time heterogeneous in virtue of its definite configuration\" (ii., 1, 647^a, trans. Ogle).  Aristotle, therefore, came very near our conception of tissue. He was of course not a histologist; he describes not the structure of tissues, which he could not know, but rather their distribution within the organism; his section on the homogeneous parts of Sanguinea (_Historia Animalium_, iii., second half) is largely a comparative topographical anatomy; in it, for instance, he describes the venous and skeletal systems.  This distinction which Aristotle drew plays an important part in all his writings on animals, particularly in his theory of development. It was a distinction of immense value, and is full of meaning even at the present day. No one has ever given a better definition of organ than is implied in Aristotle's description of the heterogeneous parts--\"The capacity of action resides in the compound parts\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 7). The heterogeneous parts were distinguished by the faculty of doing something, they were the active or executive parts. The homogeneous parts were distinguished mainly by physical characters (_De Generatione_, i., 18), but certain of them had other than purely physical properties, they were the organs of touch (_De Partibus_, ii., 1, 647^a).  (6) In a passage in the _De Generatione_ (ii, 3) Aristotle says that the embryo is an animal before it is a particular animal, that the general characters appear before the special. This is a foreshadowing of the essential point in von Baer's law (see Chap. IX. below).  He considers also that tissues arise before organs. The homogeneous parts are anterior genetically to the heterogeneous parts and posterior to the elementary material (_De Partibus_, ii., 1, 646^b).  (7) We meet in Aristotle an idea which later acquired considerable vogue, that of the _Échelle des êtres_(or \"scale of beings\"), that organisms, or even all objects organic or inorganic, can be arranged in a single ascending series. The idea is a common one; its first literary expression is found perhaps in primitive creation-myths, in which inorganic things are created before organic, and plants before animals. It may be recognised also in Anaximander's theory that land animals arose from aquatic animals, more clearly still in Anaxagoras' theory that life took its origin on this globe from vegetable germs which fell to earth with the rain. Anaxagoras considered animals higher in the scale than plants, for while the latter participated in pleasure (when they grew) and pain (when they lost their leaves), animals had in addition \"Nous.\" In Empedocles' theory of evolution, the vegetable world preceded the animal. Plato, in the _Timaeus_, describes the whole organic world as being formed by degradation from man, who is created first. Man sinks first into woman, then into brute form, traversing all the stages from the higher to the lower animals, and becoming finally a plant. This is a reversal of the more usual notion, but the idea of gradation is equally present.  Aristotle seems not to have believed in any transformation of species, but he saw that Nature passes gradually from inanimate to animate things without a clear dividing line. \"The race of plants succeeds immediately that of inanimate objects\" (Cresswell, _loc. cit._, p. 94). Within the organic realm the passage from plants to animals is gradual. Some creatures, for example, the sea-anemones and sponges, might belong to either class.  Aristotle recognised also a natural series among the groups of animals, a series of increasing complexity of structure. He begins his study of structure with man, who is the most intricate, and then takes up in turn viviparous and oviparous quadrupeds, then birds, then fishes. After the Sanguinea he considers the Exsanguinea, and of the latter first the most highly organised, the Cephalopods, and last the simplest, the lower members of his class of the Testacea. In treating of generation (in _Hist. Animalium_, v.) he reverses this order. In the _De Generatione_ (Book ii., I) there is given another serial arrangement of animals, this time in relation to their manner of reproduction. There is a gradation, he says, of the following kind:--  1. Internally viviparous Sanguinea  } producing a perfect 2. Externally viviparous Sanguinea  }       animal. 3. Oviparous Sanguinea--producing a perfect egg. 4. Animals producing an imperfect egg (one which      increases in size after being laid). 5. Insects, producing a scolex (or grub).  In Aristotle's view the gradation of organic forms is the consequence, not the cause, of the gradation observable in their activities. Plants have no work to do beside nutrition, growth, and reproduction; they possess only the nutritive soul. Animals possess in addition sensation and the sensitive or perceptive soul--\"their manner of life differs in their having pleasure in sexual intercourse, in their mode of parturition and rearing their young\" (_Hist. Anim._, viii., trans. Cresswell, p. 195). Man alone has the rational soul in addition to the two lower kinds.  As it is put in the _De Partibus_ (ii., 10, 656^a, trans. Ogle), \"Plants, again, inasmuch as they are without locomotion, present no great variety in their heterogeneous parts. For, where the functions are but few, few also are the organs required to effect them.... Animals, however, that not only live but feel, present a greater multiformity of parts, and this diversity is greater in some animals than in others, being most varied in those to whose share has fallen not mere life but life of high degree. Now such an animal is man.\"  With the great exception of Aristotle, the philosophers of Greece and Rome made little contribution to morphological theory. Passing mention may be made of the Atomists--Leucippus, Democritus, and their great disciple Lucretius, who in his magnificent poem \"De Natura Rerum\" gave impassioned expression to the materialistic"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20426"],["title","Form and Function: A Contribution to the History of Animal Morphology (#4)"],["body"," of the universe. But the full effect of materialism upon morphology does not become apparent till the rise of physiology in the 17th and 18th centuries, and reaches its culmination in the 19th century. The evolutionary ideas of Lucretius exercised no immediate influence upon the development of morphology.      [1] E. Zeller, _Greek Philosophy_, Eng. trans., i., 522     f.n., London 1881.

CHAPTER II  COMPARATIVE ANATOMY BEFORE CUVIER   For two thousand years after Aristotle little advance was made upon his comparative anatomy. Knowledge of the human body was increased not long after his death by Herophilus and Erasistratus, but not even Galen more than four centuries later made any essential additions to Aristotle's anatomy.  During the Middle Ages, particularly after the introduction to Europe in the 13th century of the Arab texts and commentaries, Aristotle dominated men's thoughts of Nature. The commentary of Albertus Magnus, based upon that of Avicenna, did much to impose Aristotle upon the learned world. Albertus seems to have contented himself with following closely in the footsteps of his master. There are noted, however, by Bonnier certain improvements made by Albertus on Aristotle's view of the seriation of living things. \"He is the first,\" writes Bonnier, \"to take the correct view that fungi are lower plants allied to the most lowly organised animals. From this point there start, for Albertus Magnus, two series of living creatures, and he regards the plant series as culminating in the trees which have well-developed flowers.\"[9]  Aristotle's influence is predominant also in the work of Edward Wotton (1492-1555), who in his book _De differentiis animalium_ adopted a classification similar to that proposed by Aristotle. He too laid stress upon the gradation shown from the lower to the higher forms.  In the 16th century, two groups of men helped to lay foundations for a future science of comparative anatomy--the great Italian anatomists Vesalius, Fallopius and Fabricius, and the first systematists (though their \"systems\" were little more than catalogues) Rondeletius, Aldrovandus and Gesner.  The anatomists, however, took little interest in problems of pure morphology; the anatomy of the human body was for them simply the necessary preliminary of the discovery of the functions of the parts--they were quite as much physiologists as anatomists.  One of them, Fabricius, made observations on the development of the chick (1615). Harvey, who was a pupil of Fabricius, likewise published an account of the embryology of the chick.[10] In his philosophy and habit of thought Harvey was a follower of Aristotle. It is worth noting that in his _Exercitationes anatomicae de motu cordis_ (1628) there is a passage which dimly foreshadows the law of recapitulation in development which later had so much vogue.[11]  A stimulating contribution to comparative anatomy was made by Belon,[12] who published in 1555 a _Histoire de la nature des Oyseaux_, in which he showed opposite one another a skeleton of a bird and of a mammal, giving the same names to homologous bones. The anatomy of animals other than man was indeed not altogether neglected at this time. Coiter (1535-1600) studied the anatomy of Vertebrates, discovering among other things the fibrous structure of the brain. Carlo Ruini of Bologna wrote in 1598 a book on the anatomy of the horse.[13] Somewhat later Severino, professor at Naples, dissected many animals and came to the conclusion that they were built upon the same plan as man.[14] Willis, of Oxford and London, in his _Cerebri Anatome_ (1659) recognised the necessity for comparative study of the structure of the brain. He found out that the brain of man is very like that of other mammals, the brain of birds, on the contrary, like that of fishes![15] He described the anatomy of the oyster and the crayfish. He had, however, not much feeling for morphology.  The foundation of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris in 1626 and the subsequent addition to it of a Museum of Natural History and a menagerie gave a great impulse to the study of comparative anatomy by supplying a rich material for dissection. Advantage was taken of these facilities, particularly by Claude Perrault and Duverney.[16] In a volume entitled _De la Mécanique des Animaux_, Perrault recognises clearly the idea of unity of type, and even pushes it too far, seeking to prove that in plants there exists an arterial system and veins provided with valves.[17]  The beginning of the 17th century saw the invention of the microscope, which was to have such an enormous influence upon the development of biological studies. It did not come into scientific use until well on in the middle of the century. Just before it came into use Francis Glisson (1597-1677), an Englishman, gave in the introduction to his treatise on the liver an account of the notions then current on the structure of organic bodies. He classifies the parts as \"similar\" and \"organic,\" the former determined by their material, the latter by the form which they assume. The similar parts are divided into the sanguineous or rich in blood and the spermatic. Both sets are further subdivided according to their physical characters,[18] the latter, for instance, into the hard, soft, and tensile tissues. The classification resembles greatly that propounded by Aristotle, though it is notably inferior in the details of its working out.  For Aristotle, as for all anatomists before the days of the microscope, the tissues were not much more than inorganic substances, differing from one another in texture, in hardness, and other physical properties. They possessed indeed properties, such as contractility, which were not inorganic, but as far as their visible structure was concerned there was little to raise them above the inorganic level. The application of the microscope changed all that, for it revealed in the tissues an organic structure as complex in its grade as the gross and visible structure of the whole organism. Of the four men who first made adequate use of the new aid, Malpighi, Hooke, Leeuenhoek, and Swammerdam, the first-named contributed the most to make current the new conceptions of organic structure. He studied in some detail the development of the chick. He described the minute structure of the lungs (1661), demonstrating for the first time, by his discovery of the capillaries, the connection of the arteries with the veins. In his work, _De viscerum structura_ (1666), he describes the histology of the spleen, the kidney, the liver, and the cortex of the brain, establishing among other things the fact that the liver was really a conglomerate gland, and discovering the Malpighian bodies in the kidney. This work was done on a broad comparative basis. \"Since in the higher, more perfect, red-blooded animals, the simplicity of their structure is wont to be involved by many obscurities, it is necessary that we should approach the subject by the observation of the lower, imperfect animals.\"[19] So he wrote in the _De viscerum structura_, and accordingly he studied the liver first in the snail, then in fishes, reptiles, mammals, and finally man. In the introduction to his _Anatome plantarum_ (1675), in which he laid the foundations of plant histology, he vindicates the comparative method in the following words:--\"In the enthusiasm of youth I applied myself to Anatomy, and although I was interested in particular problems, yet I dared to pry into them in the higher animals. But since these matters enveloped in peculiar mystery still lie in obscurity, they require the comparison of simpler conditions, and so the investigation of insects[20] at once attracted me; finally, since this also has its own difficulties I applied my mind to the study of plants, intending after prolonged occupation with this domain, to retrace my steps by way of the vegetable kingdom, and get back to my former studies. But perhaps not even this will be sufficient; since the simpler world of minerals and the elements should have been taken first. In this case, however, the undertaking becomes enormous and far beyond my powers.\"[21] There is something fine in this life of broad outlines, devoted whole-heartedly to an idea, to a plan of research, which required a lifetime to carry out.  An important histological discovery dating from this time is that of the finer structure of muscle, made by Stensen (or Steno) in 1664. He described the structure of muscle-fibres, resolving them into their constituent fibrils.  To the microscope we owe not only histology but the comparative anatomy of the lower animals. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the discovery of structure in the lower animals went on continuously, as may be read in any history of Zoology.[22] We content ourselves here with mentioning only some representative names.  In the 17th century Leeuenhoek, applying the microscope almost at random, discovered fact after fact, his most famous, discovery being that of the \"spermatic animalcules.\"  Swammerdam studied the metamorphoses of insects and made wonderfully minute dissections of all sorts of animals,"]]]
