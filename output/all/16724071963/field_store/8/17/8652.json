[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20126"],["title","The Cave of Gold (#5)"],["body"," words:       Map, showing the location of the Cave of Gold in the Golden Elbow      of Crooked Arm Gulch, which opens into Lot's Canyon near the white      pillar of rock and the big tree, made by John Stackpole, the      discoverer of the Cave of Gold.--1849.  In the lower left-hand corner of the map was a rudely drawn tree, with three huge limbs, and, from near the end of the upper and third limb, an arrow pointed slantingly downward, away from the trunk of the tree. In the lower right-hand corner was a hand holding a flaming torch. Between the tree and the torch was a cross, marked with the four main points of the compass. In the lower left-hand corner of the map itself was a small circle, marked \"Hangtown\"; and from there a crooked line trailed in a northeasterly direction to the upper right-hand quarter of the skin, where a map of Lot's Canyon and Crooked Arm Gulch was drawn with considerable detail.  [Illustration: THE SKIN MAP.]  For a couple of minutes the two boys studied this map in silence, while the conviction that the Cave of Gold was no deathbed hallucination, but a wonderful reality, grew upon them; or else, how came the skin map, which evidently had been made many days ago?  \"Hangtown!\" and Thure pointed excitedly to the name on the map. \"That's the name of the mining camp where dad was when he wrote last. And here,\" and his finger followed up the trail marked on the map, \"is Lot's Canyon! and the Big Tree! and Crooked Arm Gulch! and the Golden Elbow! and--and this black spot, marked 'cave,' right at the point of the Golden Elbow, must be the Cave of Gold! Great Moses, but I believe the miner did actually find that Cave of Gold, just as he said he did!\" and Thure's eyes and face glowed with excitement.  \"So do I,\" Bud agreed emphatically. \"The skin map, the gold nugget--why, even his murder! all go to prove the truth of his tale. The robbers killed him to get this map. They could have got the gold without killing and got away all right; but they knew of the Cave of Gold and the map--the miner said he told them--and, expecting to get the map along with the gold, they killed him to get him out of the way, so that they could have all the gold in the cave to themselves. Say, but let's hurry home and tell our mothers. They can't refuse to let us go to the mines now! And we must start just as soon as possible. Come,\" and, for the moment, in his excitement, forgetting the dead body of the miner, he started to mount his horse.  \"But, we can't leave him there!\" and Thure pointed to the body. \"Just help me to get him up on the horse in front of me and then we'll get home as soon as possible,\" and, picking up the little buckskin bag, he slipped the nugget and the map back into it, thrust it into his pocket, and soon, with the help of Bud, was on his horse, with the body of the dead miner in front of him.  Bud now quickly threw the grizzly bearskin back on his horse, jumped into his saddle, and the homeward journey was resumed.     CHAPTER IV  AT THE CONROYAL RANCHO   When Thure, bearing in his arms the dead body of a man, and Bud, with the huge skin of a grizzly bear hanging across the back of his horse behind the saddle, rode into the open court in front of the Conroyal rancho, there was great excitement; and, even before they could dismount, they were surrounded by a crowd of gesticulating, question-shouting women and children and old decrepit men, all wild with curiosity to know what had happened. In the midst of all this excitement, the door of the house was flung open and two young ladies catapulted themselves through the crowd to where Thure and Bud sat on their horses.  \"Mercy! What has happened?\" and Iola Conroyal, her horrified eyes fixed on the face of the dead miner, came to a sudden halt by the side of Thure, with Ruth Randolph, round-eyed and white-faced, clinging to one of her arms. \"Is--is he dead?\"  \"Yes, he is dead,\" Thure answered gravely. \"Murdered for his gold.\" Then, seeing how white the faces of the two girls had suddenly grown, he added quickly: \"You girls hurry right back into the house and tell your mothers that we found a miner, who had been robbed and stabbed, and started to bring him home with us, but that he died before we got here; and ask them to have some blankets laid on the floor of the sala for the body to lie on and a sheet to cover it. Now, hurry. We'll tell you how it all happened later,\" and not until the two girls were back in the house did Thure make a move to get rid of his ghastly burden. Then, reverently the body of the dead miner was lowered from the horse, and borne into the large hall-like room of the house known as the sala, and laid down on the blankets there prepared for it, and covered over with a sheet.  In the meantime Bud had thrown the great hide of the grizzly to the ground with the information that it was the skin of _El Feroz_ himself.  \"How did you kill him?\" \"Who shot him?\" and, with shouts of wonder and delight, all the men and the boys, who had not gone into the sala with the body of the dead miner, crowded around the skin of the fallen monarch.  \"Thure and I found the old villain just after he had killed a horse, and shot him,\" Bud answered hastily, anxious to get to his mother with the wonderful news of the Cave of Gold as quickly as possible. \"Here, Angelo!\" and he turned to a young Mexican boy standing near, \"Take my horse and see that he is properly cared for. And you, Juan, take the hide of _El Feroz_ and let us see how fine a robe you can make out of it.\"  \"Si, si, señor,\" answered the old Mexican exultingly. \"He, the ugly brute, kill my wife's brother, Pedro, whom I, like my own brother, loved, and 'twill give my soul peace one fine robe to make out of his big skin. A great glory, the killing of _El Feroz_, señor,\" and his old eyes kindled. \"Your fame like a swift horse will travel.\"  \"Shucks! Any hunter could have got him the same as we did,\" and Bud hurried into the house, all care for the glory of killing _El Feroz_ having been driven out of his head by the dying miner's remarkable revelations.  At the door of the house Bud was met by his mother and Mrs. Conroyal, with Ruth and Iola close behind them. The bringing of the dead body of the murdered miner into the house had greatly excited both women.  \"My son,\" Mrs. Randolph cried the moment she caught sight of Bud, \"what means this tale of murder and robbery and the bringing of the dead body of a strange man into the house?\"  \"Oh, mother, mother,\" and Bud excitedly caught hold of his mother's hand, \"the most wonderful, the most marvelous thing has happened!\"  \"What?\" and the astonished and horrified woman caught hold of both of his shoulders and shook him. \"Have you gone clean crazy, Bud Randolph, to speak of murder and robbery like that?\"  \"I--I,\" stammered Bud, \"I forgot the dead miner. We were too late to save him; but he lived long enough to tell us--\" He stopped abruptly and glanced swiftly around the room. The secret of the Cave of Gold must not be proclaimed from the housetops! There was no one in the room with himself, but the two women and the two girls. \"Mother, Mrs. Conroyal,\" he continued, lowering his voice, \"the old miner before he died told Thure and me of a wonderful Cave of Gold that he had discovered in a gulch somewhere in the mountains; and he made Thure and me his heirs, and gave us a map, showing the way to the cave, and a huge gold nugget, which the robbers did not get, that he said he had found in the cave, and he--But here is Thure! He has the--\"  \"Hush! Not so loud!\" and Thure, who at that moment stepped into the room from the sala, where the body of the dead miner lay, lifted a warning hand. \"There are many ears in there,\" and he pointed to the door he had just closed behind him, \"that must not hear what we have to tell. Come, let us go to your room, mother, where there won't be any danger of what we have to tell you being overheard,\" and he started for Mrs. Conroyal's private room, followed by Bud and the two wondering women and the girls.  \"I--I,\" and Thure stopped at the door of his mother's room and looked hesitatingly at Iola and Ruth, \"I--I reckon it is too great a secret to tell you two girls just now. You had better wait--\"  \"No!\"--\"No!\" broke in both girls indignantly, while Ruth, looking as if she would like to box Thure's ears, declared:  \"We girls can keep a secret just as well as you boys can, and you know it; for, haven't we saved you from many a licking by not telling your dads what you had been up to? But if this is the way you are going to treat us, we'll fix you next time,\" and she shook her head threateningly.  \"Besides,\" supplemented Iola triumphantly, \"we know most of the secret already. It's about a Cave of Gold and a map and--\"  \"Oh, Christmas! You couldn't keep nothing from the girls!\" and the face Thure turned to Bud showed his disgust.  \"Well, I reckon the secret is just as safe with them as it is with us,\" protested Bud stoutly, flushing a little, \"especially when they know how important it is to keep it secret. You will never tell a word of it to anybody, will you girls? It--it might mean murder, if you did.\"  \"No, no,\" affirmed Iola emphatically. \"We'll not breathe a word of it to a living human being. We'll die first. We'll not disappoint your trust in us, Bud,\" and she glanced a bit scornfully from Bud to her brother. \"Will we, Ruth?\"  \"Never,\" and Ruth's red lips closed tightly over her pearly teeth. \"Do you suppose we'd betray those we love?\" and her eyes flashed indignantly.  \"All right. See that you don't, then,\" and Thure's face cleared. To tell the truth he was just a little ashamed of the lack of confidence he had shown in his sister and Ruth. \"Anyhow, you know so much now that you might as well be told the rest, so come on,\" and he opened the door and carefully closed and locked it, when all had entered the room.  It did not take many minutes for the two eager boys to tell the story of the day's remarkable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20126"],["title","The Cave of Gold (#6)"],["body",", from the killing of the great grizzly to the death of the old miner; for the narrative, under the lash of their active tongues, proceeded in running jumps, from the beginning to the end and was never allowed to lag an instant.  \"And now,\" concluded Thure excitedly, when the last of the wonderful tale had been told, \"Bud and I must both start for the mines just as soon as we can get ready; and get father and Rex and Dill and Uncle Frank and Hammer Jones to help us find this Cave of Gold; and when we have found it--\"  \"But,\" broke in Mrs. Conroyal, smiling at Thure's enthusiasm, although her own face was flushed and her eyes were sparkling with excitement, \"where is this wonderful gold nugget and skin map, that you tell us the miner gave you in proof of his remarkable story? You seem to forget that you have not yet shown us your proof.\"  \"Here, here it is!\" and the excited boy thrust one hand into his pocket and triumphantly pulled out the small buckskin bag; and, swiftly turning the bag bottom side up, dumped its contents into his mother's lap; and the next moment, the two women and the two girls were as excitedly examining the big nugget and the rude skin map as ever they had been examined by the two boys.  \"And the miner told you that the bottom of the cave was covered with gold nuggets like this?\" queried Mrs. Randolph, her eyes shining, as she held up the nugget.  \"Yes, yes,\" answered Bud. \"Thousands of them, only smaller. Of course he picked up the biggest that he could see. We can go to the mines now, can't we, mother?\"  \"And this queer skin map tells you how to find this wonderful Cave of Gold?\" and Mrs. Conroyal spread out the map on her lap and stared wonderingly at it. \"I can't see how all this jumble of crooked lines and letters can tell you anything.\"  \"Why, it's easy, mother,\" and Thure bent eagerly over the map. \"You see you start from Hangtown and go in a northeasterly direction to Humbug Canyon and Three Tree Mountain and Goose Neck Lake and the Devil's Slide to Lot's Canyon; and then up Lot's Canyon until you come to Crooked Arm Gulch, and then up Crooked Arm Gulch until you come to the Golden Elbow; and the cave, you see, is right in the point of the elbow,\" and Thure's finger rested excitedly on the black spot on the map marked \"cave.\" \"The cave is about five days from Hangtown, the miner said. We can go to the mines now, can't we, mother?\"  \"Hangtown! What a horrid name!\" and Mrs. Conroyal shuddered. \"But,\" and she started to her feet excitedly, \"wasn't your father's last letter sent from Hangtown? I am sure it was,\" and she hurried to her writing desk, picked up a letter and glanced eagerly at its heading. \"See! It was! Here is the name,\" and she pointed triumphantly to the letter.  \"You see, it won't be difficult to find the Cave of Gold from the map, mother, not with dad's help. And, mother, we must start for the mines just as soon as we can get ready to go. You surely will let us go now!\" and Thure caught hold of his mother's hand. \"Say, yes, mother, now; because Bud and I want to start to-morrow morning, and there is much to be done before we go.\"  \"My boy,\" and Mrs. Conroyal's face sobered, \"you are all the man that the mines have left me. Husband, son, servants, all have gone to the mines, until now you and Bud are the only able-bodied men left on the rancho--and now the mines are calling you!\"  \"But, mother, think of what the finding of such a mine means to us all! And father and Mr. Randolph, if they knew about the Cave of Gold and the skin map, I am sure would want us to come; and Old Juan and Manuel and the boys can take care of the rancho; and, you know, if we find the Cave of Gold and get the gold, then all of us, father and the rest, will be back soon; and we will be rich; and dad can build you the new house that you want and furnish it the way that you want it furnished; and Bud and I can go East and get the education that we need to fit us to do a man's work in the great new State of California that is bound to be made out of this country, now that it has become a part of the United States. It is yes, isn't it, mother? And we can start, can't we, to-morrow morning?\" and Thure's arm went round his mother and he drew her appealingly to him.  For a minute or two Mrs. Conroyal did not answer. She was battling with her mother-love. She knew what this quest of the Cave of Gold might mean--hardships, dangers, even death for those she loved. But she was of pioneer stock, had often seen her dearest go forth to face the dangers of the unknown wilderness; and, at last, with something of Spartan-like fortitude, she turned to Thure.  \"Yes, my son, you may go,\" she said. \"You may go to your father and tell him all; and he will decide about the search for the Cave of Gold.\"  \"Hurrah! We can go! Mother says I can go!\" and Thure swung his free hand around his head.  \"And mother says I can go! Hurrah for the gold-mines!\" and Bud clapped his sister on the back, by way of letting off some of the surplus steam of his enthusiasm. \"It will be great! And I'll bring you back a necklace of gold nuggets, sister mine. Now, we must be getting ready.\"  \"But, first we all have a solemn duty to perform,\" Mrs. Conroyal said gravely. \"We must give the dead miner decent burial, as we would wish our own dear ones buried, should they die amongst strangers. See that the grave is dug, my son; and notify all that the funeral will be held in the house-sala at the going down of the sun. Come, we will make ready the house for the funeral,\" and, followed by Mrs. Randolph and the two girls, she hurried from the room.  A half an hour later, all who were left on the rancho gathered in the sala to pay the last respects of the living, who soon must die, to the dead, who but a short time before lived. There was no minister, no priest to be had. Mrs. Conroyal read the church service for the dead over the body of the unfortunate miner; and then six of the oldest and strongest boys gently lifted the boards on which the corpse lay to their shoulders and, just as the rays of the setting sun redden the tops of the western mountains, bore the body slowly to its last resting place, beneath the outstretched arms of a sturdy oak, on the top of a little hillock, near the murmuring waters of a small stream that flowed close by the house.  That night was a busy night at the Conroyal rancho. Everything must be got ready for the going of Thure and Bud in the morning; and it was surprising how many things there were that needed doing. But, at length, long after midnight, everything was in readiness and the two boys entered their sleeping room for their last night's rest, for they knew not how long, in the dear old home-house.  \"I can hardly realize that we are to start for the mines in the morning,\" Thure said, as he quickly undressed and jumped into bed. \"All that has happened to-day seems more like a dream than the reality; and I am almost afraid that I will wake up in the morning and find that I have been only dreaming.\"  \"Well,\" declared Bud, \"if it's only dreaming, I'm going to get into bed and dream some more as quick as I can; so, not meaning to be impolite, shut up and good night,\" and he settled himself down comfortably in the bed and closed his eyes. And, in five minutes, in spite of the feverish excitements of the day, the two tired boys were sound asleep.     CHAPTER V  OFF FOR THE GOLD-MINES   The next morning when the sun rose, in all the golden glory of dawning day in beautiful California, above the tops of the eastern mountains and shone down into the Valley of the Sacramento, its rays fell on an interesting scene in front of the Conroyal house, where nearly all the men, women and children of the place had gathered about two heavily laden pack-horses, four saddled horses, and two boys, and two girls. The two boys were Thure and Bud, ready to start for the mines, the two girls were Iola and Ruth, who were to ride with the boys for an hour or so on their way, the four saddled horses were their riding horses, and the two pack-horses bore the outfits of the young miners, as well as sundry tokens of love and affection sent to the dear ones at the mines. The boys stood at their horses' heads, ready to mount. The very moment of departure had come.  \"Well, I reckon we must be going now. Good-by, mother,\" and Thure turned for a last embrace in those dear arms, and then swung himself up into his saddle.  \"God bless you, and protect you, and bring you safe home, my son,\" and Mrs. Conroyal, trying in vain to keep back the tears from her eyes and the sobs from her voice, embraced and kissed Thure farewell and bravely saw him mount.  Bud tried very hard to control his feelings, but his voice choked a little and there were tears in his eyes, as he kissed his mother good-by and jumped into his saddle; and then, just to break the gloom that seemed to be gathering too thickly about the parting, he jerked off his hat, and, swinging it around his head, shouted: \"Hurrah, for the gold-mines! Hurrah, we're off for the mines!\"  And everybody shouted with him; and, in the midst of the shouting, the two boys, leading their pack-horses and with Iola and Ruth on their horses by their sides, rode out of the house-court and started across the valley toward the distant eastern mountains.  The search for the dead miner's Cave of Gold had begun.  Iola Conroyal and Ruth Randolph were two very lively and high-spirited girls, just old enough to see all the romance and little of the rough reality and danger of such a quest as their two brothers had begun. The wonderful tale of the dying miner, with its Cave of Gold, its rough-drawn map and its big gold nugget, had appealed very strongly to their vivid and romantic imaginations; and the starting of Thure and Bud in search of this marvelous cave had surrounded them, in their eyes, with something of the glamour that gilds the heroes of romance. They envied them their quest; they would have gone joyfully with"]]]
