I--that is exactly what I had planned to do anyhow,\" Thure declared. \"And I'll see that it is a big one, Ruth, the biggest that I can find. And the next nugget I pick up you shall have for a ring; and then I'll pick up a lot of little nuggets and make you a gold necklace out of them.\"  \"That will be glorious,\" and Ruth's eyes shone. \"And--and I shall prize them all very much. Oh, dear, I don't see why we girls were just born girls and not boys! I never wanted to do anything as much as I want to go with you and Bud, and help hunt for this Cave of Gold. I'd go anyway, if mother would let me.\"  \"So would I,\" Iola declared, her dark eyes and cheeks glowing at the thought. \"It is terrible to be just a girl, when there is anything like this to be done. We, at least Ruth and I, do not want to be put in a cage and fed, like canary birds. We want to do things, too; and we could do things, too, if folks would only let us.\"  \"Hoity-toity!\" laughed Thure. \"I reckon God knew what He was about when He made you 'just girls'--just sisters, sweethearts, wives, mothers, the dearest words spoken in every language the world over; and, for one, I am powerful glad that He did make you 'just girls.'\"  \"So am I,\" Bud agreed, so emphatically that all laughed.  \"But, it really does seem too bad that Iola and I have got to stay at home with our mothers, where nothing exciting ever happens,\" persisted Ruth, \"while you two, just because you are boys, can go hunting caves of gold and have all sorts of wonderful adventures--not that I really and truly would like to be a boy,\" she added hastily and a little contradictorily. \"Boys are so awkward and have such big feet and hands, and--and--\"  \"And are such good fellows to wait on girls,\" grinned Bud provokingly.  \"Which shows girls' real superiority,\" smiled back Ruth.  \"Well, if you are satisfied, what are you kicking for? You haven't heard Thure and me wishing that we were girls, have you?\" queried Bud triumphantly.  \"Well, I should say not, not when you are off on a hunt like this anyhow!\" Ruth rejoined. \"Oh, but I do hope you will find that Cave of Gold! And come back covered with gold nuggets and glory!\"  By this time our young friends had reached the foot of the ridge, on whose top it had been agreed they were to say farewell to one another; and the thought of the nearness of the parting was suddenly pressed home to each heart, and they rode to the top of the ridge without speaking a word. Here they pulled up their horses; and, for a moment, their eyes looked wistfully into one another's faces, while they sat silent in their saddles.  \"Oh, come, let's have the agony over!\" and Bud tried to make his voice sound cheery and unconcerned. \"Good-by, Ruth,\" and, urging his horse up close to the side of his sister's horse, he leaned over, threw his arms around her neck and kissed her. Then he turned and quickly served Iola in the same way; and, striking spurs into his horse, started off, his pack-horse tugging at the rope behind him.  Thure hesitated a moment; and then, following Bud's example, quickly kissed Iola and Ruth good-by, and started after Bud.  \"Don't forget that you have promised me the first gold nugget that you pick up in the cave!\" called Ruth.  \"Nor the gold necklace!\" warned Iola.  Thure and Bud waved their hands and shouted in reply; but rode steadily on.  The two girls sat on their horses and watched them, until, with final shouts and the waving of their hats, they passed over the top of a distant ridge and vanished from sight. Then Iola and Ruth turned their horses homeward and rode silently down the other side of the ridge. They did not care to talk, even about the wonderful Cave of Gold, just then.  They had ridden something like a couple of miles on their way homeward and their tongues were just beginning to wag, girl-like, again, when both were considerably startled by a loud hallo, coming from behind. They turned quickly and saw two horsemen, who had just ridden out from behind a small grove of trees, some twenty rods back and to the right, and who were now riding toward them.  \"I wonder who they can be!\" exclaimed Ruth. \"I am sure that I never saw them before; but I suppose we had better wait and find out what they want. They might be lost. They look like strangers to this part of the country,\" and she pulled up her horse.  \"Yes,\" agreed Iola, halting her horse by the side of Ruth. \"They are probably foreigners on their way to the mines; and we had better wait to see if we can be of any help to them.\"  In the holster that hung from the pommel of the saddle of each girl there was a double-barreled pistol, loaded and ready for instant use; and it was not there for ornament. Both girls had been trained to use the rifle and the pistol; and never, since Iola's frightful experience with the Mexican desperado, Padilla, some three years before,[1] had either girl been permitted to ride, even a short distance from the house, without having one or both of these weapons with her. Consequently, trained and armed as they were, they saw nothing to fear in meeting the two strange horsemen, although they were alone in a little valley and out of sight and hearing of every other human being, so far as they knew.  [Footnote 1: For an account of this adventure, see _Fighting With Fremont_, the preceding book of this series.]  The two horsemen came up on a slow gallop; and pulled up their horses a dozen feet from the girls.  \"We asks your pardon, ladies,\" said the larger of the two men--a big red-headed man with a broken nose--as he awkwardly doffed his hat. \"But, seein' you ridin' by, an' thinkin' you might be able tew give us sum information, we bein' strangers in this part of Californy, we made bold tew hallo tew you,\" and he paused, his bold eyes staring admiringly into the dark face of Iola.  \"We will be very glad to help you, if we can,\" answered Iola, a bit shortly, for she did not like the looks of the big man with the broken nose. \"What is it you would like to know?\"  \"Wal,\" answered the man, glancing toward his companion, \"me an' my pardner was tew meet a man over yonder by that big rock that sticks itself out of th' ground, like a nose on a man's face,\" and he pointed to a huge rock a mile or more away that shot up out of the level of the valley, not unlike the nose on a man's face. \"He was tew git thar 'bout noon yisterday; an' we haven't seen hide nor ha'r of him yit; an', gittin' powerful tired of waitin' an' thinkin' you ladies might have seen him, we stops you tew ask.\"  \"An' bein' a leetle afeared he might have come tew harm,\" the other horseman, a small man with a pock-marked face, here broke in, \"seein' that he was a comin' from th' diggin's an' was supposed tew have considerable gold-dust with him, we makes bold tew stop you ladies tew ask about him, jest as my pardner says, thinkin' you might have seen him.\"  \"What--what did he look like?\" Iola asked anxiously, the moment the man paused; for her thoughts had gone instantly to the dead man they had buried last night, when he had spoken of the man they were looking for as being on his way back from the diggings.  \"Wal, he won't exactly what you ladies would call a beauty,\" answered the big man, grinning, \"seein' that he'd let his whiskers an' ha'r grow long an' scraggly all over his face an' head; but you'd a-knowed him, if you'd a-seen him, by a peecoolyer scar over his left eye, shaped sumthin' like a hoss-shoe, with th' ends of th' shoe pointin' t'ord th' corners of th' eye.\"  \"Why,\" and Iola's face whitened, \"he must have been the man our brothers, Thure and Bud, brought home with them yesterday afternoon! He had a scar on his forehead like that. Didn't you notice it?\" and she turned to Ruth.  \"Yes,\" Ruth answered, \"and he was from the mines.\"  \"Wal, now, that's good news,\" declared the big man, glancing out of the corners of his eyes at his companion. \"We was afeared sum harm had come tew him. An' so he's restin' safe an' easy at your home. Now, whar might that be, if I may be so bold as tew ask?\"  \"But, he'd been robbed--murdered!\" exclaimed Iola. \"And it was his dead body that had been brought to our house. We buried him last night.\"  \"Robbed! Murdered!\" almost yelled the big man. \"Do you hear that, Spike?\" and he turned excitedly to his companion. \"Sumone got him for his gold, jest as he was afeared they would. An' you say 'twas your brothers who found him, an' took th' body home with them, an' gave it decent burial. Now I call that decent, don't you, Spike?\" and he glanced sharply at his companion.  \"White an' decent,\" agreed Spike. \"But,\" and his small snake-like eyes shifted swiftly from face to face of the two girls, as he spoke, \"did he--did he leave any message for his friends; or, was he dead when your brothers found him?\"  \"He lived only a little while,\" answered Iola. \"He had been stabbed by one of the cowards, and he died before they could get him to the house. I don't think he left any message. I don't remember of hearing our brothers say anything about a message, do you?\" and she turned to Ruth.  \"No,\" replied Ruth. \"He--he left no word for any friend. He only--\" she stopped abruptly, and just in time; for, unthinkingly, she had been about to speak of the skin map and the Cave of Gold.  Both men started slightly at her words and abrupt stop and flashed swift"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20126"],["title","The Cave of Gold (#8)"],["body"," into each other's eyes.  \"Now, that's tew bad,\" declared the big man. \"We sure thought he would leave a message for us, seein' that he knowed we was here a-waitin' for him. But, I reckon, we'd better ride on tew th' house with you ladies an' see them brothers of your'n personal. You see we wants tew make sart'in 'twas our friend that was robbed and murdered, besides he might have left sum word for Spike an' me, an' your brothers not have mentioned it, bein' naturally excited-like over th' robbery an' murder.\"  \"But, you can't see them now!\" exclaimed Iola, impulsively. \"They left for the mines this very morning. Why, we parted from them not more than an hour ago.\"  Both men started violently at this news, and again the swift suspicious glances flashed from eyes to eyes, and an ugly threatening look came into their faces.  \"Gone tew th' mines! An' started sudden, this very mornin'!\" exclaimed Spike excitedly. \"Did--Did th' old miner say an'thing 'bout whar he found his gold afore he died?\" and his beady black eyes glowed angrily into the faces of the two girls. \"We're his friends, an' have a right tew know, an' we want tew know, an' we're goin' tew know,\" and he urged his horse nearer to the girls.  Both girls were badly frightened by this sudden and unexpected change in the two men; for there was no mistaking the ugly and dangerous look on their faces; but neither girl lost her head.  \"You will not come a step closer than you now are,\" and the white hand of Iola flashed to the pistol in her holster; and Spike, to his evident horror, suddenly found himself looking straight down into two little round holes that seemed to his startled eyes as big as the mouths of cannons.  \"And you, too, stay right where you are,\" and Ruth's pistol suddenly turned the big man with a broken nose into a wildly staring equestrian statue. \"We two girls are not going to take any chances with you two men; and--and now that we have given you all the information that we have for you, you can turn your horses around and ride back the way you came.\"  [Illustration: \"YOU CAN TURN YOUR HORSES AROUND AND RIDE BACK THE WAY YOU CAME.\"]  The faces of both girls had suddenly grown as white as milk; for, almost at the same moment, each had remembered that the dying miner had described his two murderers as a big red-headed man with a broken nose and a small man with a pock-marked face--and they were now looking straight into the faces of two such men. But the hands that held the pistols did not tremble; and there was no mistaking the look in the shining eyes back of the little round holes. They would shoot; and, if they shot, they would not miss; and it did not take the two men two seconds to discover these facts.  \"Oh, come, this ain't no hold up game, is it, ladies?\" and the big man tried to look as if he considered the whole affair a huge joke; but he was very careful not to make a threatening move; and he kept his eyes fixed on the two little round holes of Ruth's pistol, in a horrible staring way that Ruth never forgot.  \"No,\" Ruth answered shortly. \"It is not a hold up; and there is going to be no hold up in this case,\" she added significantly; \"so just turn your horses around and gallop back the way you came; and be very careful not to let your hands go near your belts or to look back while doing it,\" she warned.  \"Oh, say, now,\" began the small man. \"This ain't hospital-like. We ain't meanin' you ladies no harm. We--\"  \"Drop the talk and turn your horses around and get,\" Iola commanded so imperatively, so threateningly that both men, in a sudden panic of fear--like nearly all rascals they were cowards and those two pistols in those two girlish hands might go off at any instant--whirled their horses around and galloped off, while a bullet from one of the barrels of Iola's pistol, whistling between their heads, added to their panic and speed.  \"Do you,\" and Ruth turned her white face to Iola, the moment the two men were at a safe distance, \"do you really think they were the two men who murdered the miner?\"  \"Yes,\" answered Iola, as she began reloading her pistol, with hands that trembled now so that she could hardly pour the powder into the barrel. \"I am sure they were. Ugh! But what a dreadful fright they gave me! I felt certain they were going to murder us, when they started toward us.\"  \"And--and do you suppose they were trying to find out about that skin map and the Cave of Gold?\" and Ruth's face again began whitening.  \"Yes, that is it!\" and Iola started. \"That was what made them so angry and ugly, when we told them that Thure and Bud had already started for the mines. They at once suspicioned that the boys had the map and that they had started out to find the Cave of Gold. Oh, Ruth,\" and a look of horror came into Iola's face, \"do you suppose they will start on the trail of Thure and Bud and try to get the map from them? Why, they might murder them!\"  \"That is exactly what I am afraid they will do,\" declared Ruth, her own face reflecting the horror in Iola's face. \"But you may be sure that two cowards like them will never get the best of our brothers, unless they do it in some sneaking underhanded way; and the boys have been warned to look out for them. It won't take Thure and Bud as long to discover who they are, as it did us. The instant they see that broken nose and pock-marked face, they will be on their guard. But I do wish we had said nothing about the boys starting for the mines. Anyhow that is about all the information they did get from us that will do them any good, thank goodness! And they will have a mighty hard time finding and following their trail, unless they are old hunters and trappers; and they did not look as if they were. Anyhow it can't be helped now; and the best thing that we can do is to get back home as quickly as we can.\"  \"I don't think we had better say anything to our mothers about meeting the two men,\" Iola said, as with a final look in the direction of the two horsemen, who were still galloping up the valley, they turned their horses homeward. \"It wouldn't do any good to tell them and they'd worry a lot.\"  \"You're right. Mum's the word,\" agreed Ruth; and then both girls struck their horses sharply and started on a swift gallop for the Conroyal rancho, where we must leave them for the present and return to Thure and Bud.     CHAPTER VI  THE SIGN OF THE TWO RED THUMBS   At the date of the happenings here recorded, 1849, the greater part of California was still an unbroken wilderness, inhabited only by scattered tribes of Indians and the wild beasts. For some three hundred years the Spaniards and the Mexicans had occupied a few choice spots along the coast, with now and then an isolated ranchero in the great interior valleys of the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers. Then, in 1846, had come the War with Mexico and the Conquest of California by the Americans, swiftly followed by the discovery of gold in 1848 and the great inflow of gold-seekers from all parts of the world of 1849 and later, who, of course, all rushed pell-mell to the gold regions, leaving the rest of California more thinly populated than ever. Indeed, in 1849, all California, except the gold regions, was practically deserted; and, since the gold regions were located in what had been, a few weeks before, a mountainous wilderness, nearly everybody in California was living in the wilderness, and, necessarily, living under primitive wilderness conditions--a wild, free, independent sort of a life that quickly brought to the surface the real character of each individual.  Such, then, was the California of 1849, the California of Thure and Bud; and such were the conditions of the life, the wild romantic life of the wilderness mining camps, toward which we left our young friends hastening, their unwilling pack-horses pulling and tugging on the ropes which were dragging them away from the home-pastures, when we rode a little way on the homeward journey with Iola and Ruth.  Now, to return to Thure and Bud.  The Conroyal rancho was situated in the Lower Sacramento Valley, some two-days' journey from Sutter's Fort, near which the City of Sacramento on the Sacramento River had sprung into a sudden and marvelous existence; and, as Sacramento City was then the final rendezvous of all those bound for the mines, some forty miles in the wilderness of mountains to the east, Thure and Bud, naturally, had headed straight for this town, intending, when there, to find someone going to Hangtown, with whom they might journey to this mining camp, where they hoped to find their fathers and their friends. Both boys were well acquainted with the trail to Sutter's Fort, having been there frequently with their fathers; and, since Sacramento City was only a couple of miles or so from Sutter's Fort, they would have no difficulty in finding their way thither. The trail, for the greater part of the distance, ran through beautiful valleys and over low-lying hills, where nature still reigned unfretted by man and where a human being was seldom seen, consequently Thure and Bud expected to have a lonely ride to Sacramento City.  For some little while after the departure of the two girls neither boy spoke. Somehow they did not feel like talking, not even about the wonderful Cave of Gold, nor the skin map, nor the death of the old miner. They were thinking of home and the dear ones from whom they had parted for they knew not how long; and, when boys are thinking deeply of such things, they do not like talking. But, gloom and sadness cannot long conquer the spirits of any normal boy; and, at the end of an hour's riding they were their own lively and talkative selves again.  \"I wonder if we can make our old camping-ground to-night?\" Thure questioned doubtfully, as they came to a halt, a little before noon, on the top of a steep ridge to give their horses a short rest. \"If I remember right, this ridge is not nearly half-way to the place where dad and I always camped when we went to "]]]
