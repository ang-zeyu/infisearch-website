With them was a newcomer, a portly, ruddy-faced gentleman with a white mustache and goatee, dressed in a white suit. Gail broke away from me and ran toward him. This, I thought, would be her father; now I would be introduced and find out just what her last name was. I followed, more slowly, and saw a waiter, with a wheeled serving-table, move in behind the group which she had joined.  So I saw what none of them did--the waiter suddenly reversed his long carving-knife and poised himself for a blow at President Hutchinson's back. I simply pressed the little silver stud on my belt, the Krupp-Tatta popped obediently out of the holster into my open hand. I thumbed off the safety and swung up; when my sights closed on the rising hand that held the knife, I fired.  Hoddy Ringo, who had been holding a sandwich with one hand and a drink with the other, dropped both and jumped on the man whose hand I had smashed. A couple of Rangers closed in and grabbed him, also. The group around President Hutchinson had all turned and were staring from me to the man I had shot, and from him to the knife with the broken handle, lying on the ground.  Hutchinson spoke first. \"Well, Mr. Ambassador! My Government thanks your Government! That was nice shooting!\"  \"Hey, you been holdin' out on me!\" Hoddy accused. \"I never knew you was that kinda gunfighter!\"  \"There's a new wrinkle,\" the man with the white goatee said. \"We'll have to screen the help at these affairs a little more closely.\" He turned to me. \"Mr. Ambassador, New Texas owes you a great deal for saving the President's life. If you'll get that pistol out of your hand, I'd be proud to shake it, sir.\"  I holstered my automatic, and took his hand. Gail was saying, \"Stephen, this is my father,\" and at the same time, Palme, the Secretary of State, was doing it more formally:  \"Ambassador Silk, may I present one of our leading citizens and large ranchers, Colonel Andrew Jackson Hickock.\"  Dumbarton Oaks had taught me how to maintain the proper diplomat's unchanging expression; drinking superbourbon had been a post-graduate course. I needed that training as I finally learned Gail's last name.     CHAPTER VI   It was early evening before we finally managed to get away from the barbecue. Thrombley had called the Embassy and told them not to wait dinner for us, so the staff had finished eating and were relaxing in the patio when our car came in through the street gate. Stonehenge and another man came over to meet us as we got out--a man I hadn't met before.  He was a little fellow, half-Latin, half-Oriental; in New Texas costume and wearing a pair of pistols like mine, in State Department Special Services holsters. He didn't look like a Dumbarton Oaks product: I thought he was more likely an alumnus of some private detective agency.  \"Mr. Francisco Parros, our Intelligence man,\" Stonehenge introduced him.  \"Sorry I wasn't here when you arrived, Mr. Silk,\" Parros said. \"Out checking on some things. But I saw that bit of shooting, on the telecast screen in a bar over town. You know, there was a camera right over the bandstand that caught the whole thing--you and Miss Hickock coming toward the President and his party, Miss Hickock running forward to her father, the waiter going up behind Hutchinson with the knife, and then that beautiful draw and snap shot. They ran it again a couple of times on the half-hourly newscast. Everybody in New Austin, maybe on New Texas, is talking about it, now.\"  \"Yes, indeed, sir,\" Gomez, the Embassy Secretary, said, joining us. \"You've made yourself more popular in the eight hours since you landed than poor Mr. Cumshaw had been able to do in the ten years he spent here. But, I'm afraid, sir, you've given me a good deal of work, answering your fan-mail.\"  We went over and sat down at one of the big tables under the arches at the side of the patio.  \"Well, that's all to the good,\" I said. \"I'm going to need a lot of local good will, in the next few weeks. No thanks, Mr. Parros,\" I added, as the Intelligence man picked up a bottle and made to pour for me. \"I've been practically swimming in superbourbon all afternoon. A little black coffee, if you don't mind. And now, gentlemen, if you'll all be seated, we'll see what has to be done.\"  \"A council of war, in effect, Mr. Ambassador?\" Stonehenge inquired.  \"Let's call it a council to estimate the situation. But I'll have to find out from you first exactly what the situation here is.\"  Thrombley stirred uneasily. \"But sir, I confess that I don't understand. Your briefing on Luna....\"  \"Was practically nonexistent. I had a total of six hours to get aboard ship, from the moment I was notified that I had been appointed to this Embassy.\"  \"Incredible!\" Thrombley murmured.  I wondered what he'd say if I told him that I thought it was deliberate.  \"Naturally, I spent some time on the ship reading up on this planet, but I know practically nothing about what's been going on here in, say, the last year. And all I know about the death of Mr. Cumshaw is that he is said to have been killed by three brothers named Bonney.\"  \"So you'll want just about everything, Mr. Silk,\" Thrombley said. \"Really, I don't know where to begin.\"  \"Start with why and how Mr. Cumshaw was killed. The rest, I believe, will key into that.\"  So they began; Thrombley, Stonehenge and Parros doing the talking. It came to this:  Ever since we had first established an Embassy on New Texas, the goal of our diplomacy on this planet had been to secure it into the Solar League. And it was a goal which seemed very little closer to realization now than it had been twenty-three years before.  \"You must know, by now, what politics on this planet are like, Mr. Silk,\" Thrombley said.  \"I have an idea. One Ambassador gone native, another gone crazy, the third killed himself, the fourth murdered.\"  \"Yes, indeed. I've been here fifteen years, myself....\"  \"That's entirely too long for anybody to be stationed in this place,\" I told him. \"If I'm not murdered, myself, in the next couple of weeks, I'm going to see that you and any other member of this staff who's been here over ten years are rotated home for a tour of duty at Department Headquarters.\"  \"Oh, would you, Mr. Silk? I would be so happy....\"  Thrombley wasn't much in the way of an ally, but at least he had a sound, selfish motive for helping me stay alive. I assured him I would get him sent back to Luna, and then went on with the discussion.  Up until six months ago, Silas Cumshaw had modeled himself after the typical New Texas politician. He had always worn at least two faces, and had always managed to place himself on every side of every issue at once. Nothing he ever said could possibly be construed as controversial. Naturally, the cause of New Texan annexation to the Solar League had made no progress whatever.  Then, one evening, at a banquet, he had executed a complete 180-degree turn, delivering a speech in which he proclaimed that union with the Solar League was the only possible way in which New Texans could retain even a vestige of local sovereignty. He had talked about an invasion as though the enemy's ships were already coming out of hyperspace, and had named the invader, calling the z'Srauff \"our common enemy.\" The z'Srauff Ambassador, also present, had immediately gotten up and stalked out, amid a derisive chorus of barking and baying from the New Texans. The New Texans were first shocked and then wildly delighted; they had been so used to hearing nothing but inanities and high-order abstractions from their public figures that the Solar League Ambassador had become a hero overnight.  \"Sounds as though there is a really strong sentiment at what used to be called the grass-roots level in favor of annexation,\" I commented.  \"There is,\" Parros told me. \"Of course, there is a very strong isolationist, anti-annexation, sentiment, too. The sentiment in favor of annexation is based on the point Mr. Cumshaw made--the danger of conquest by the z'Srauff. Against that, of course, there is fear of higher taxes, fear of loss of local sovereignty, fear of abrogation of local customs and institutions, and chauvinistic pride.\"  \"We can deal with some of that by furnishing guarantees of local self-government; the emotional objections can be met by convincing them that we need the great planet of New Texas to add glory and luster to the Solar League,\" I said. \"You think, then, that Mr. Cumshaw was assassinated by opponents of annexation?\"  \"Of course, sir,\" Thrombley replied. \"These Bonneys were only hirelings. Here's what happened, on the day of the murder:  \"It was the day after a holiday, a big one here on New Texas, celebrating some military victory by the Texans on Terra, a battle called San Jacinto. We didn't have any business to handle, because all the local officials were home nursing hangovers, so when Colonel Hickock called--\"  \"Who?\" I asked sharply.  \"Colonel Hickock. The father of the young lady you were so attentive to at the barbecue. He and Mr. Cumshaw had become great friends, beginning shortly before the speech the Ambassador made at that banquet. He called about 0900, inviting Mr. Cumshaw out to his ranch for the day, and as there was nothing in the way of official business, Mr. Cumshaw said he'd be out by 1030.  \"When he got there, there was an aircar circling about, near the ranchhouse. As Mr. Cumshaw got out of his car and started up the front steps, somebody in this car landed it on the driveway and began shooting with a twenty-mm auto-rifle. Mr. Cumshaw was hit several times, and killed instantly.\"  \"The fellows who did the shooting were damned lucky,\" Stonehenge took over. \"Hickock's a big rancher. I don't know how much you know about supercow-ranching, sir, but those things have to be herded with tanks and light aircraft, so that every rancher has at his disposal a fairly good small air-armor"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20126"],["title","The Cave of Gold (#0)"],["body","(http://www.archive.org/details/americana)    Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

TO THE DESCENDANTS YOUNG OR OLD OF THE HARDY FORTY-NINERS THIS STORY OF THE EXCITING DAYS OF THE DISCOVERY OF GOLD IN CALIFORNIA IS HOPEFULLY DEDICATED     [Illustration: \"YOU LIE!\" AND THE HARD FIST LANDED SQUARELY ON THE MAN'S CHIN.]     FOREWORD   On a cold January morning of 1848, James Wilson Marshall picked up two yellow bits of metal, about the size and the shape of split peas, from the tail-race of the sawmill he was building on the South Fork of the American River, some forty-five miles northeast of Sutter's Fort, now Sacramento City. These two yellow pellets proved to be gold; and soon it was discovered that all the region thereabouts was thickly sown with shining particles of the same precious yellow metal. A few months later and all the world was pouring its most adventurous spirits into the wilderness of California.  This discovery of gold in California and the remarkable inpouring of men that followed, meant very much to the United States. In a few months it cleared a wilderness and built up a great state. In one step it advanced the interests and the importance of the United States half a century in the policies and the commerce of the Pacific. It threw wide open the great doors of the West and invited the world to enter. It poured into the pockets of the people and into the treasury of the United States a vast amount of gold--alas! soon to be sorely needed to defray the expenses of the most costly war of the ages. Indeed, when the length and the breadth of its influence is considered, this discovery of gold in California becomes one of the most important factors in the developing of our nation, the great corner-stone in the upbuilding of the West; and, as such, it deserves a much more important place in the history of the United States than any historian has yet given to it.  In the present story an attempt has been made, not only to tell an interesting tale, but to interest the younger generation in this remarkable and dramatic phase of our national development, possibly the most picturesque and dramatic period in the history of the nation: to picture to them how these knights of the pick and the shovel lived and worked, how they found and wrested the gold from the hard hand of nature, and to give to them something of an idea of the hardships and the perils they were obliged to endure while doing it.  The period was a dramatic period, crowded with unusual and startling happenings, as far removed as possible from the quiet commonplaceness and routine life of the average boy and girl of to-day; and the reader is cautioned to remember this--if disposed at any time to think the incidents narrated in the present tale too improbable or too startling to have ever happened--that they could not happen to-day, even in California; but they might have all happened then and there in California.  The author is one of those who believe that the boys and the girls of to-day should know something of the foundation stones on which the superstructure of our national greatness rests, and how and with what toils and perils they were laid; and, it is in the hope that the reading of this story will interest them in this, the laying of the great corner-stone in the upbuilding of the West, that this tale of the Discovery of Gold in California has been written.  No nation can afford to forget its builders.     CONTENTS     CHAPTER         I. El Feroz        II. Death of the Miner       III. The Skin Map        IV. At the Conroyal Rancho         V.

Again that same shrill whistling scream of dreadful agony and fear, that had caused them to rein up their horses so suddenly a moment before, came from the valley beyond the brow of the little hill up which they had been slowly riding, and chilled the very marrow in their bones with the terrible intensity of its fear and anguish. Then all was still.  \"What--what was it?\" and Thure turned a startled face to Bud. \"It didn't sound human and I never heard an animal scream like that before. What can it be?\"  \"I don't know,\" Bud answered, his face whitening a little; \"but I am going to find out. Come on,\" and, swinging his rifle into position where it would be ready for instant use, he started up the hill, his eyes fixed in the direction whence had come those fearful screams.  \"We'd better go a little slow, until we find out what it is,\" cautioned Thure, as he quickly fell in by the side of Bud, his own rifle held ready for instant use. \"It might be Indian devilment of some kind. You know dad's last letter from the mines said that the Indians were getting ugly; and if it is hostile Indians, we want to see them first.\"  \"You bet we do,\" was Bud's emphatic rejoinder, as he again pulled up his horse. \"Now, just hold Gray Cloud and I'll scout on ahead and see what's going on down there in the valley before we show ourselves,\" and, sliding swiftly from Gray Cloud's back, he tossed his bridle rein to Thure, and, rifle in hand, started swiftly and as silently as an Indian toward a thick clump of bushes that grew directly on the top of the little hill.  Thure deftly caught the bridle rein; and then sat silent and motionless on the back of his horse, his eyes on his comrade, waiting in tense expectancy for the moment when he would reach the clump of bushes and look down into the valley beyond and see the cause of those strange and terrible cries that had so suddenly and so fearfully startled them.  Bud, carrying his cocked rifle at trail, his form bent so that the least possible part of his body showed above the grass of the hillside, ran swiftly until he had almost reached the brow of the hill and the clump of bushes. Then, crouching closer to the ground, he crept cautiously and slowly to the bushes and, gently working himself into their midst, carefully parted the branches in front of his face until he had a clear view of the little valley below. At the first sight he uttered an exclamation of surprise and wrath and threw his rifle to his shoulder; but, with a regretful shake of his head, he almost instantly lowered the gun, and, turning quickly about, motioned excitedly for Thure to advance with the horses and started on the run to meet him.  \"Indians! Is it Indians?\" Thure cried anxiously, the moment Bud was at his side.  \"No,\" panted the boy, as he leaped into his saddle. \"It's _El Feroz_; and if I've got anything to say about it, he has made his last kill. Come on,\" and his eyes glinted with wrath and excitement, as he dug his spurs into the flanks of Gray Cloud and galloped furiously up the hill.  \"_El Feroz!_ Bully!\" and Thure, with an exultant yell, struck the spurs into his horse and galloped along by his side.  At the top of the hill both boys pulled up their horses and looked down into the valley. The valley was small, not more than half a mile across, and through its center ran a little stream of water, fringed with bushes and small trees. On the near side of this fringe of trees and bushes and only a short distance from where our two young friends sat on the backs of their horses, crouched a huge grizzly bear over the body of a horse that was still quivering in the death agony.  \"The brute!\" exclaimed Thure angrily, the moment his eyes had taken in this scene of violence. \"So that was the death scream of a horse we heard! Well, I never want to hear another! But, we've got you now, you old villain!\" and his eyes swept over the little valley, free, except for the fringe of trees and bushes, of all obstructions, exultingly. \"If we let you get away from this, we'll both deserve to be shot. Now,\" and he turned to Bud, \"you ride to the right and I'll go to the left and we will have the brute between us, so that if he charges either of us, the other can take after him and shoot or rope him.\"  \"Good!\" agreed Bud. \"But, say, let's rope him first. Just shooting is too good for _El Feroz_."]]]
