In a way his feelings went out to meet those of his companion; but the dictator had trusted him, and he had disobeyed, and, for all his disobedience, his soldier's instinct told him that the dictator was right.  Hostilius eyed him sharply and suspiciously, as if trying to divine his thoughts.  \"If you regret--\" he began.  Suddenly a decurion of the allies dashed up beside them.  \"Look!\" he cried, pointing toward the east.  \"There is carrion for the wolves.\"  Both leaders turned at the words.  Far out across the plain was what seemed at first sight like a clump of dark foliage, save that it moved and changed shape too much.  \"Numidians!\" exclaimed the decurion, following his finger with his speech, while the veins in Hostilius' forehead began to swell and grow dark.  \"The signal!  Let it be given,\" he cried to his officer, and, turning, he dug his knees into his horse's sides and galloped toward the distant quarry.  A moment later the cavalry wheeled at the trumpet call, and, in some disorder but full of eagerness, began the pursuit of their leader.  As for Sergius, he, too, gave order and rein, though more deliberately, and his troop followed the cavalry of the allies in somewhat better array.  By his side galloped Decius with an expression hard to analyze upon his weather-beaten face.  Sergius glanced at the old soldier from time to time with a look of inquiry and concern.  At last he ventured to question his grim mentor.  \"Is it well or ill, Marcus?\"  \"Ill for you that command, well for me who obey,\" growled the other, and Sergius flushed and was silent.  \"Shall we catch them?\" he asked, a few moments later, for the clump of Numidians, who had sat motionless upon their horses until the Romans covered half the intervening distance, had now wheeled for flight.  \"If they be too strong for us, we shall catch them,\" replied Decius.  \"It is as they will.\"  And now it became apparent that the marauders were far inferior in numbers to the assailants, and that they recognized the fact; for flight and pursuit began in earnest.  Horses were urged to higher speed.  At one moment the Numidians seemed to be holding their distance; at another, the Romans gained slightly but unmistakably.  All order of detachments and turmae was soon lost; Romans and allies, officers and men, were mingled together in a straggling mass, with naught but the eagerness of the riders and the speed of their animals to marshal them.  Only Decius continued to pound along, with his horse's nose at his tribune's elbow. The thunder of many hundred hoofs rolled across the plain.  \"By Hercules! we shall do it!\" cried Sergius, in whom ardour of the chase had put to flight all sentiments of regret or doubt.  \"Do you not see we are gaining?\"  \"They ride silently yet,\" said Decius.  \"It is but knee-speed with them. Wait till they cry out to their horses, and we shall see.\"  Suddenly, as if to supplement the words, a single shrill cry, half whistle, half scream, rose up ahead.  Had they been closer, they might have noted the pricking ears of the desert steeds; but this much they saw:--one horse and rider darting out of the press, like arrow from bow, and scurrying away over the plain as if their former gait had been but a hand-gallop.  An instant of misgiving came to some few of the Romans, who were not blind to everything but the excitement of the moment, but they, like the rest, only plied knee and thong the harder, and the episode of the single rider was forgotten by all save Marcus Decius and Sergius.  \"It is a trap, master,\" said the former, with an inquiring glance at his leader.  Sergius bowed his head, and his face was troubled, as he replied:--  \"I know it, my Marcus, but we cannot turn back now.  I have accepted the feast: therefore I must recline until my host gives the signal to rise. I pray you pardon me.\"  By a quick movement Decius urged his horse a stride ahead of the tribune's, that he might the better hide his emotion; at the same time growling:--  \"I pardon you?--and for the chance of a blow at the scum?  I thank you many times.\"  And now, from the plain ahead rose a low range of rolling hills over which a light cloud seemed to hover.  Was it the ascent that wearied the horses of the Numidians?  Surely the space between pursuers and pursued was lessening rapidly, and Hostilius leaned far forward, shaking his spear and calling upon his men for a renewed effort.  \"Now! now!\" he cried.  \"See! they are spent!  Up with them ere they top the hill!\"  But the Numidians gained the sought-for ridge, if only by a few spear-lengths' lead, and the cloud, now close ahead, hung so dense that there were those who thought it the smoke of another farm.  Decius' eyes seemed set in a dazed stare.  There was too much red in that cloud, and yet it was not the red of fire, and it was too light and too thin for smoke.  He knew it; he had known it all along, but what did it matter? The last Numidian had disappeared down the opposite slope--no! surely they had turned again, and in a longer line--a thicker one; and the light javelins and naked black bodies had become long, stout spears and glittering corselets, while at their head rode a slender man with forked beard, and his black eyes seemed to burn in his head like coals.  So, with one barbaric roar, the whole array poured down over the allied cavalry, and these were like the dust of the trampled field.     VII.  PUNISHMENT.  Sergius hardly knew what was happening.  He was conscious that the stride of his horse had been checked by a dense mass of plunging animals in front--a mass that grew more dense and more tangled with every instant.  Those behind were still endeavouring to press forward, and those in front were hurled back upon them or were striving frantically to break through the rearmost squadrons and escape; while, shrill above the clash of arms and the shouts and screams, rose a name that Sergius found himself listening to with a sort of curious interest.  \"Maharbal!  Maharbal!\" came the cry, nearer and nearer.  At the first moment of the check, Marcus Decius had pushed the sturdy horse that he rode well to the fore.  He saw Hostilius riding back, waving one arm and crying out incoherent words: his spear was gone, and the head of a Spaniard's lance had been thrust through his shoulder and broken off, so that a third of the shaft hung from the wound.  Then what had happened and the hopelessness of it all became apparent. Like the veriest fools they had ridden into the snare, and Maharbal, the Carthaginian, with at least two thousand Spanish and African horsemen, was thundering on their front and flanks: their front--but in a moment, their rear; for now those who had not been ridden down at the first onset or become inextricably entangled with their fellows broke away over the plain, carrying their officers with them in a mad frenzy of flight; while other Numidians--fresh riders on fresh steeds--urged the pursuit and smote down the hindermost.  Decius found himself riding in the middle of the press.  His face was as imperturbable as ever, though he glanced over his shoulder from time to time as if to note how much nearer death had come.  Sergius galloped close behind him, careless and abstracted, his rein lying loose on his charger's steaming neck.  Then, of a sudden, a resolve seemed to come to him.  Straightening himself, he urged the weary horse forward through the fugitives till he drew up even with Hostilius, who, still frantic with panic, was now swaying in his saddle from the pain and loss of blood.  Sergius leaned over and laid his hand upon the other's arm, and Hostilius started as if he had touched a serpent.  Then he became calmer, and a troubled look was in the eyes that sought the tribune's face.  \"Yes, I know,\" he said at last, speaking hurriedly and in odd, strained accents.  \"I led you into it, and now I am flying.\"  \"Let us turn back,\" said Sergius, mildly.  \"I do not reproach you, but let us turn back.  Surely it is better than the rods and axe.\"  Hostilius shuddered, and, at that moment, Decius, who had overtaken them, broke in with:--  \"By Hercules! there is no fear of those.  They cut us down in flight. The choice is, shall we have it in the face or between the shoulders.\"  \"By the gods of Rome, then!\" shouted the praefect, suddenly reining up, while Sergius and Decius swung their horses in short circles.  There was no trumpet to give the signal, and the little cavalry banner had gone down long ago; but such was the force of Roman training that nearly all of Sergius' men and half of the allies turned in mid-panic with their leaders.  To make head, much less to form was impossible, for the foremost of the enemy were well mingled with the rearmost fugitives.  As Decius had said, it was only a choice of deaths: the one swift and honourable, the other more lingering, but none the less inevitable.  Almost in a moment it was over.  Between two and three hundred of the united detachments had fallen already, and the hundred or so that now sought to face about, went down in a crushed and bleeding mass under the thousands of hoofs that overwhelmed them.  Such was the weight and impetus of the pursuing force that there was no time even to strike, and most of the victims fell unwounded by spear or javelin.  Sergius was vaguely conscious that he had seen the praefect cloven through the head by the short, swordlike Numidian knife, his own horse seemed to collapse under him, and that was the end.  Then he knew that it was dark and cold and that there was a howling in the air, as of beasts of prey, and the shadow of a man fell across him, for the moon was in the heavens, and the man was cursing by all the gods of the Capitol.  Gradually consciousness returned, and he recalled, incident by incident, the happenings of the past day.  He had been lying still, thus far, without further wish than"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20220"],["title","The Mind and Its Education (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations.

Appleton And Company Copyright, 1906, 1916, by D. Appleton and Company Printed in the United States of America       PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION   Authors, no doubt, are always gratified when their works find favorable acceptance. The writer of this text has been doubly gratified, however, at the cordial reception and widespread use accorded to the present volume. This feeling does not arise from any narrow personal pride or selfish interest, but rather from the fact that the warm approval of the educational public has proved an important point; namely, that the fundamental truths of psychology, when put simply and concretely, can be made of interest and value to students of all ages from high school juniors up, and to the general public as well. More encouraging still, it has been demonstrated that the teachings of psychology can become immediately helpful, not only in study or teaching, but also in business or profession, in the control and guidance of the personal life, and in the problems met in the routine of the day's work or its play.  In effecting the present revision, the salient features of the original edition have been kept. The truths presented are the most fundamental and important in the field of psychology. Disputed theories and unsettled opinions are excluded. The subject matter is made concrete and practical by the use of many illustrations and through application to real problems. The style has been kept easy and familiar to facilitate the reading. In short, there has been, while seeking to improve the volume, a conscious purpose to omit none of the characteristics which secured acceptance for the former edition.  On the other hand, certain changes and additions have been made which, it is believed, will add to the strength of the work. First of all, the later psychological studies and investigations have been drawn upon to insure that the matter shall at all points be abreast of the times in scientific accuracy. Because of the wide use of the text in the training of teachers, a more specific educational application to schoolroom problems has been made in various chapters. Exercises for the guidance of observation work and personal introspection are freely used. The chapter on Sensation and Perception has been separated into two chapters, and each subject given more extensive treatment. A new chapter has been added on Association. The various chapters have been subdivided into numbered sections, and cut-in paragraph topics have been used to facilitate the study and teaching of the text. Minor changes and additions occur throughout the volume, thus adding some forty pages to the number in the original edition.  Many of the modifications made in the revision are due to valuable suggestions and kindly criticisms received from many teachers of the text in various types of schools. To all who have thus helped so generously by freely giving the author the fruits of their judgment and experience he gladly renders grateful thanks.  CORNELL COLLEGE,  IOWA.
