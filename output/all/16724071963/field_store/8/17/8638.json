Winnie already had her class before her. \"Now you must do just as I do. You must hold your dress back so,--not grab it, but hold it back nice, and you must bend forward so, and you must point your slippers so,--not stand flat.\"  Very graceful the little dancing-teacher looked, tip-toeing here, gliding there, twinkling through a series of pretty steps down the long garden walk.  But the pupils! Do the best she might, sturdy little Kathie couldn't manage her dress. She grasped it tightly in either fat little fist. \"Mother Bunch!\" Lu giggled behind her back.  Kathie's face got very red over that. It was well enough to be \"Dumpling,\"--everybody loves a dumpling; but \"Mother Bunch!\" So she bounced and shuffled a little longer, and then she said she was going home.  But Miss Lu wasn't ready. She greatly liked the new fun, the hopping and whirling to Winnie's steady \"One, two, _three!_ One, two, _three!_\" There was a grown-up, affected smirk on her delicate little face, at which Mrs. Tennyson laughed every time she looked out. I think Lu would have hopped and minced up and down the walk until night, if Winnie's mother hadn't told them it was time to go.  \"I don't like her old steps,\" said Kathie. They were sitting on a daisy bank near Mr. Medway's.  \"Well, I do,\" said Lu. \"And you would, too, if you wasn't so chunked. You just bounced up and down.\"  Kathie burst out crying. \"I'll bet dancing steps _is_ wicked, for you never was so mean before in your life, so! And you didn't dance near so pretty as Winnie, and you needn't think you ever will, for you _never_ will!\"  \"Oh! I won't, won't I?\" said Lu, teasingly.  \"No, you won't. I won't be wicked and say you are nice, for you're horrid.\"  \"_You_'re wicked this minute, Kathie Dysart, for _you_'re mad.\"  And as she laughed a naughty laugh, and as Kathie glared back at her, then it was that that which happened began to happen. Lu's delicate, rosy mouth commenced drawing up at the corners in an ugly fashion, and her nose commenced drawing down, while her dimpled chin thrust itself out in a taunting manner; but the horror of it was that she couldn't straighten her lips, nor could she draw in her chin when she tried.  \"You _dis'gree'ble_ thing!\" shrieked Kathie, looking at her and feeling dreadfully, her eyebrows knotting up like two little squirming snakes. \"If I'm a Mother Bunch, you're a bean-pole, and you'll be an ugly old witch some day, and you'll dry up and you'll blow away.\"  By this time the two little pink starched sun-bonnets fairly stood on end at each other.  \"Kathie Dysart, I'll tell your Sunday-school teacher, see if I don't.\"  \"Tell her what? you old, _old_, OLD thing!\"  [Illustration: \"They grew older and uglier each moment.\"]  Kathie Dysart loved her Sunday-school teacher, and now she _was_ in a rage. She couldn't begin to scowl as fiercely as she felt; her cheeks sunk in, her lips drew down, her nose grew sharp and long in the effort. And, all at once, as the children say, her face \"froze\" so. Oh! it was perfectly horrid, that which happened to the two little dears, it was indeed. They could not possibly look away from each other, and they grew older and uglier each moment! Why, their very sun-bonnets--those fresh little pink sun-bonnets--shriveled into old women's caps, and even in the hearts of the poor little old crones the hardening process was going on, a fierce fire of hate scorching the last central drop of dew, until nothing would ever, ever grow and bloom again.  It was all over with Lu and Kathie forever and ever.    All this was long ago, of course--indeed, it happened \"once upon a time.\" It would be difficult now to verify each point in the account. On the contrary, I suppose it just possible that there may be a mistake as to the transformation of the children's clothes--the change of the sun-bonnets into caps, for instance.  But, as a whole, I see no reason to doubt the story. Often, and quite recently, too, I have seen little faces in danger of a similar transformation.  Where anger, envy, spite, and some others of the ill-tempers, gain control of the nerves and muscles of the human countenance, they pull and twitch and knot and tie these nerves and muscles, until it is almost impossible to recognize the face.  Sometimes this change has passed off in a minute; but at other times it has lasted for hours, and there is _always_ danger that the face will fail to recover its pleasantness wholly, that traces will remain, like wrinkles in a ribbon that has been tied, and that, at last, the transformation will be final and fatal, and the fair child become and remain \"a horrid old witch.\"  Of one thing we all are certain--that the most gossiping and malicious person now living was once a fair and innocent child; so who shall say that this which I have related did _not_ happen to Lu and Kathie?     FLAXIE FRIZZLE.   Her name was Mary Gray, but they called her Flaxie Frizzle. She had light curly hair, and a curly nose. That is, her nose curled up at the end a wee bit, just enough to make it look cunning.  What kind of a child was she?  Well, I don't want to tell; but I suppose I shall have to. She wasn't gentle and timid and sweet like you little darlings, oh, no! not like you. And Mrs. Willard, who was there visiting from Boston, said she was \"dreadful.\"  She was always talking at the table, for one thing.  \"Mamma,\" said she, one day, from her high chair, \"your littlest one doesn't like fish; what makes you cook him?\"  Mamma shook her head, but Flaxie wouldn't look at it. Mrs. Willard was saying, \"When we go to ride this afternoon we can stop at the slate-quarry.\"  _Who_ was going to ride? And would they take the \"littlest one\" too? Flaxie meant to find out.  [Illustration: Flaxie Frizzle.]  \"Do you love me, mamma?\" said she, beating her mug against her red waiter.  \"When you are a good girl, Flaxie.\"  \"Well, look right in my eyes, mamma. Don't you see I _are_ a good girl? And _mayn't_ I go a-riding?\"  \"Eat your dinner, Mary Gray, and don't talk.\"  Her mother never called her Mary Gray except when she was troublesome.  \"I want to tell you sumpin, mamma,\" whispered she, bending forward and almost scalding herself against the teapot, \"I _won't_ talk; I won't talk _a_ tall.\"  But it was of no use. Mrs. Willard was not fond of little girls, and Mrs. Gray would not take Flaxie; she must stay at home with her sister Ninny.  Now Ninny--or Julia--was almost ten years old, a dear, good, patient little girl, who bore with Flaxie's naughtiness, and hardly ever complained. But this afternoon, at four o'clock, her best friend, Eva Snow, was coming, and Ninny did hope that by that time her mamma would be at home again!  Mrs. Gray and Mrs. Willard rode off in the carriage; and the moment they were gone, Flaxie began to frisk like a wild creature.  First she ran out to the gate, and screamed to a man going by,--  \"How d'ye do, Mr. Man? You _mustn't_ smoke! My mamma don't like it!\"  \"Oh, why _did_ you do that?\" said Ninny, her face covered with blushes, as she darted after Flaxie, and brought her into the house.  \"Well, then, show me your new picture-book, and I won't.\"  As long as she was looking at pictures she was out of mischief, and Ninny turned the leaves very patiently.  But soon the cat came into the room with the new kitten in her mouth, and then Flaxie screamed with terror. She thought the cat was eating it up for a mouse; but instead of that she dropped it gently on the sofa, purring, and looking at the two little girls as if to say,--  \"Isn't it a nice baby?\"  Flaxie thought it was; you could see that by the way she kissed it. But when she picked it up and marched about with it, the old cat mewed fearfully.  \"Put it down,\" said Ninny. \"Don't you see how bad you make its mother feel?\"  \"No. I's goin' to carry it over the bridge, and show it to my grandma; she wants to see this kitty.\"  Ninny looked troubled. She hardly dared say Flaxie must not go, for fear that would make her want to go all the more.  \"What a funny spot kitty has on its face,\" said she, \"white all over; with a yellow star on its forehead.\"  \"Well,\" said Flaxie, \"I'll wash it off.\" And away she flew to the kitchen sink.  \"What are you up to now?\" said Dora, the housemaid, who stood there with her bonnet on. \"You'll drown that poor little creetur, and squeeze it to death too! Miss Ninny, why don't you attend to your little sister?\"  Dear Ninny! as if she were not doing her best! And here it was half-past three, and Eva Snow coming at four!  \"O Dodo!\" said she, \"you're not going off?\"  \"Only just round the corner, Miss Ninny. I'll be right back.\"  But it was a pity she should go out at all. Mrs. Gray did not suppose she would leave the house while she was gone.  As soon as \"Dodo\" was out of sight, Flaxie thought she could have her own way.  \"O Ninny! you're my darlin' sister,\" said she, with a very sweet smile. \"Will you lem me carry my kitty over to grandma's?\"  \"Why, no indeed! You mustn't go 'way over the bridge.\"  \"Yes I mus'. 'Twon't hurt me _a_ tall!\"  \"But I can't let you, Flaxie Frizzle; truly I can't; so don't ask me again.\"  Flaxie's lip curled as well as her nose.  \"Poh! I haven't got so good a sister as I fought I had. Laugh to me, Ninny, and get me my pretty new hat, or I'll shut you up in the closet!\"  Ninny did laugh, it was so funny to hear that speck of a child talk of punishing a big girl like her!  \"Will you lem me go?\" repeated Flaxie.  \"No, indeed! What an idea!\"  \"I've got fi-ive cents, Ninny. I'll buy you anyfing what you want? Now lem me! 'Twon't hurt me _a_ tall!\"  Ninny shook her head, and kept shaking it; and Flaxie began to push her toward"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20112"],["title","Lill's Travels in Santa Claus Land (#3)"],["body","closet door.  \"_Will_ you get my hat, Ninny? 'Cause when I die 'n' go to hebben, then you won't have no little sister.\"  \"No, I will not get your hat, miss, so there!\"  All this while Flaxie was pushing, and Ninny was shaking her head. The closet-door stood open, and, before Ninny thought much about it, she was inside.  \"There you is!\" laughed the baby.  Then rising on her \"tippy-toes,\" Flaxie began to fumble with the key. Ninny smiled to hear her breathe so hard, but never thought the wee, wee fingers could do any harm.  At last the key, after clicking for a good while, turned round in the lock; yes, fairly turned. The door was fastened.  \"Let me out! out! out!\" cried Ninny, pounding with both hands.  Flaxie was perfectly delighted. She had not known till then that the door was locked, and if Ninny had been quiet she would probably have kept fumbling away till she opened it. But now she wouldn't so much as touch the key, you may be sure. O, Flaxie Frizzle was a big rogue, as big as she _could_ be, and be so little! There she stood, hopping up and down, and laughing, with the blind kitty hugged close to her bosom.  \"Laugh to me, Ninny!\"  \"What do I want to laugh for? Let me out, you naughty girl!\"  \"Well, _you_ needn't laugh, but _I_ shall. Now I's goin' to grandma's, and carry my white kitty.\"  \"No, no, you mustn't, you mustn't!\"  \"_You_ can't help it! I _is_ a goin'!\"  \"Flaxie! Flax-ee!\"  Oh! where was Eva Snow? Would she never come? There was a sliding-door in the wall above the middle shelf, and Ninny climbed up and pushed it back. It opened into the parlor-closet, where the china dishes stood. If she could only crawl through that sliding door she might get out by way of the parlor, if she _did_ break the dishes.  But, oh dear! it wasn't half big enough. She could only put her head in, and part of one shoulder. What should she do?  It was of no use screaming to that witch of a Frizzle; but she did scream. She threatened to \"whip her,\" and \"tie her,\" and \"box her ears,\" and \"burn up her dollies.\"  But Flaxie knew she wouldn't; so she calmly pulled off her boots and put on her rubbers.  Then Ninny coaxed. She promised candy and oranges and even wedding-cake, for she forgot she hadn't a speck of wedding-cake in the world.  But, while she was still screaming, Flaxie was out of sight and hearing. She hadn't found her hat; but, with her new rubbers on her feet, and the blind kitty still hugged to her bosom, she was \"going to grandma's.\" She ran with all her might; for what if somebody should catch her before she got there!  \"The faster I hurry the quicker I can't go,\" said she, puffing for breath.  It was a beautiful day. The wind blew over the grass, and the grass moved in green waves; Flaxie thought it was running away like herself.  It was half a mile to the bridge. By the time she reached Mr. Pratt's store, which was half way, she thought she would stop to rest.  \"'Cause he'll give me some candy,\" said she, and walked right into the store, though it was half full of men,--oh fie! Flaxie Frizzle!  Mr. Jones, a lame man, was sitting next the door, and she walked boldly up to him.  \"Mr. _Lame_ Jones, does you want to see my kitty?\"  He laughed, and took it in his hands; and another man pinched its tail. Flaxie screamed out:  \"You mustn't hold it by the handle, Mr. Man!\"  Then they all laughed more than ever, and clapped their hands; and Mr. Jones said:  \"You're a cunning baby!\"  \"Well,\" replied Flaxie, quickly, \"what makes you have turn-about feet?\"  This wasn't a proper thing to say, and it made Mr. Jones look sober, for he was sorry to have such feet. Mr. Pratt was afraid Flaxie would talk more about them; so he frowned at her and said:  \"Good little girls don't run away bare-headed, Miss Frizzle! Is your mamma at home?\"  \"Guess I'll go now,\" said Flaxie; \"some more folks will want to see my kitty.\"  Mr. Pratt's boy ran after her with a stick of candy, but could not catch her. She called now at all the houses along the road, ringing the bells so furiously that people rushed to the doors, afraid something dreadful had happened.  \"I fought you'd want to see my kitty,\" said the runaway, holding up the little blind bundle; and they always laughed then; how could they help it?  But somehow nobody thought of sending her home.  When she reached the bridge she was hungry, and told the \"bridge-man\" she was \"fond of cookies.\" His wife gave her a caraway-cake shaped like a leaf.  \"I'm fond o' that one,\" said she, with her mouth full. \"Please give me _two_ ones.\"  Just fancy it! Begging food at people's houses! Yet her mamma _had_ tried to teach her good manners, little as you may think it.  \"I don't believe she has had any supper. It must be she is running away,\" said the bridge-man's wife, as Flaxie left her door. \"I ought to have stopped her; but somebody will, of course.\"  But nobody did. People only laughed at her kitty, and then passed on.  Soon the sun set, and the new moon shone white against the blue sky. Flaxie had often seen the moon, but it looked larger and rounder than this. What ailed it now?  \"Oh, I know,\" said she, \"God has doubled it up.\"  She had changed her mind, and did not want to go to her grandmother's.  \"Mr. Pratt fought I was bare-headed, and grandma'll fink I'm bare-headed. Guess I won't go to g'andma's, kitty, I'll go to preach-man's house; preach-man will want to see you.\"  On she went till she came to the church. Then she sat down on the big steps, dreadfully tired.  \"Oh, my yubbers ache so! Now go s'eep, Kitty; and when you want to wake up, call me, and I'll wake you.\"  This was the last Flaxie remembered. When the postmaster found her, she was sitting up, fast asleep, with her little tow head against the door, and the kitty in her arms. The kitty was still alive.  Eva Snow had come and let Ninny out of the closet long ago; and lots of people had been hunting ever since for Flaxie Frizzle. When the postmaster and the minister brought her home between them, Mrs. Gray was so very glad that she laughed and cried. Still she thought Flaxie ought to be punished.  \"O mamma,\" said Miss Frizzle next morning, very much surprised to find herself tied by the clothes-line to a knob in the bay-window. \"The men laughed to me, they did! Mr. Lame Jones, he said I was very cunning!\"  But for all that, her mamma did not untie her till afternoon; and then Flaxie promised \"honestly,\" not to run away again.  Would you trust her?     FIVE POUNDS OF CINNAMON.   They don't name girls \"Roxy,\" and \"Polly,\" and \"Patty,\" and \"Sally,\" nowadays; but when the little miss who is my heroine was a lady, those short, funny old names were not at all old-fashioned. \"Roxy,\" especially, was considered a very sweet name indeed. All these new names, \"Eva,\" and \"Ada,\" and \"Sadie,\" and \"Lillie,\" and the rest of the fanciful \"ies\" were not in vogue. Then, if a romantic, highflown young mamma wished to give her tiny girl-baby an unusually fine name, she selected such as \"Sophronia,\" \"Matilda,\" \"Lucretia,\" or \"Ophelia.\" In extreme cases, the baby could be called \"Victoria Adelaide.\"  In this instance baby's mother was a plain, quiet woman; and she thought baby's grandmother's name was quite fine enough for baby; and so baby was called \"Roxy,\" and, when she was ten years old, you would have thought little Roxy fully as old-fashioned as her name.  _I think it is her clothes_ that makes her image look so funny as she rises up before me. She herself had brown hair and eyes, and a good country complexion of milk and roses--such a nice complexion, girls! You see she had plenty of bread and milk to eat; and a big chamber, big as the sitting-room down stairs, to sleep in--all windows--and her bed stood, neat and cool, in the middle of the floor; and she had to walk ever so far to get anywhere--it was a respectable little run even out to the barn for the hens' eggs; and it was half a mile to her cousin Hannah's, and it was three quarters to school, and just a mile to the very nearest stick of candy or cluster of raisins. Nuts were a little nearer; for Roxy's father had a noble butternut orchard, and it was as much a part of the regular farm-work in the fall to gather the \"but'nuts\" as it was to gather the apples.  Don't you see, now, why she had such a nice complexion? But if you think it don't quite account for such plump, rosy cheeks, why, then, she had to chase ever so many ways for the strawberries. Not a strawberry was raised in common folks' gardens in those days. They grew mostly in farmers' meadows; and very angry those farmers used to be at such girls as Roxy in \"strawberry time\"--\"strawberry time\" comes before \"mowing,\" you know--for how they did wallow and trample the grass! Besides, the raspberries and blackberries, instead of being Doolittle Blackcaps, and Kittatinnies, and tied up to nice stakes in civilized little plantations, grew away off upon steep hill-sides, and in the edges of woods, by old logs, and around stumps; and it took at least three girls, and half a day, and a lunch-basket, and torn dresses, and such clambering, and such fun, to get them! _Of course_ Roxy had red cheeks, and a sweet breath, and plump, firm white flesh--_so_ white wherever it wasn't browned by the sunshine.  But otherwise she certainly was old-fashioned, almost quaint. Her hair was braided tight in two long braids, crossed on her neck, and tied with a bit of black thread; there was a pair of precious little blue ribbons in the drawer for Sundays and high days. Roxy's mother would have been awfully shocked at the wavy, flowing hair of you Wide Awake girls, I assure you!  And Roxy's dress. _You_ never saw a \"tow and linen\" dress, I dare say. Roxy's dresses were all \"home-made\"--not merely cut and sewed at home; but Roxy's father raised the flax in the field north of the house, and Roxy's mother spun the flax and tow into thread upon funny little wheels. Then she colored the thread, part of it indigo blue, and part of \"copperas color,\" and after"]]]
