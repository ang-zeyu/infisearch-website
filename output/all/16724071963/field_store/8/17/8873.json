If proper care has been taken, the infusion in the closed vessel will remain unchanged indefinitely; but the other will soon become turbid, and a disagreeable odor will be given off. Microscopic examination shows the first to be free from germs of any kind, while the second is swarming with various forms of bacteria.  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--Bacteria.]  These little organisms have of late years attracted the attention of very many scientists, from the fact that to them is due many, if not all, contagious diseases. The germs of many such diseases have been isolated, and experiments prove beyond doubt that these are alone the causes of the diseases in question.    If a drop of water containing bacteria is examined, we find them to   be excessively small, many of them barely visible with the strongest   lenses. The larger ones (Fig. 8) recall quite strongly the smaller   species of oscillaria, and exhibit similar movements. Others are so   small as to appear as mere lines and dots, even with the strongest   lenses. Among the common forms are small, nearly globular cells;   oblong, rod-shaped or thread-shaped filaments, either straight or   curved, or even spirally twisted. Frequently they show a quick   movement which is probably in all cases due to cilia, which are,   however, too small to be seen in most cases.  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--_Euglena_. _A_, individual in the active condition. _E_, the red \"eye-spot.\" _c_, flagellum. _n_, nucleus. _B_, resting stage. _C_, individual dividing, × 300.]  Reproduction is for the most part by simple transverse division, as in oscillaria; but occasionally spores are produced also.   CLASS III.--GREEN MONADS (_Volvocineæ_).  This group of the protophytes is unquestionably closely related to certain low animals (_Monads_ or _Flagellata_), with which they are sometimes united. They are characterized by being actively motile, and are either strictly unicellular, or the cells are united by a gelatinous envelope into a colony of definite form.  Of the first group, _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), may be selected as a type.    This organism is found frequently among other algæ, and occasionally   forms a green film on stagnant water. It is sometimes regarded as a   plant, sometimes as an animal, and is an elongated, somewhat   worm-like cell without a definite cell wall, so that it can change   its form to some extent. The protoplasm contains oval masses, which   are bright green in color; but the forward pointed end of the cell   is colorless, and has a little depression. At this end there is a   long vibratile protoplasmic filament (_c_), by means of which the   cell moves. There is also to be seen near this end a red speck (_e_)   which is probably sensitive to light. A nucleus can usually be seen   if the cell is first killed with an iodine solution, which often   will render the flagellum (_c_) more evident, this being invisible   while the cell is in motion. The cells multiply by division.   Previous to this the flagellum is withdrawn, and a firm cell wall is   formed about the cell (Fig. 9, _B_). The contents then divide into   two or more parts, which afterwards escape as new individuals.  Of the forms that are united in colonies[2] one of the best known is _Volvox_ (Fig. 10). This plant is sometimes found in quiet water, where it floats on or near the surface as a dark green ball, just large enough to be seen with the naked eye. They may be kept for some time in aquaria, and will sometimes multiply rapidly, but are very susceptible to extremes of temperature, especially of heat.  [2] The term \"colony\" is, perhaps, inappropriate, as the whole mass of cells arises from a single one, and may properly be looked upon as an individual plant.  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Volvox._ _A_, mature colony, containing several smaller ones (_x_), × 50. _B_, Two cells showing the cilia, × 300.]    The colony (Fig. 10, _A_) is a hollow sphere, the numerous green   cells of which it is composed forming a single layer on the outside.   By killing with iodine, and using a strong lens, each cell is seen   to be somewhat pear-shaped (Fig. _B_), with the pointed end out.   Attached to this end are two vibratile filaments (cilia or   _flagella_), and the united movements of these cause the rolling   motion of the whole colony. Usually a number of young colonies   (Fig. _x_) are found within the mother colony. These arise by the   repeated bipartition of a single cell, and escape finally, forming   independent colonies.    Another (sexual) form of reproduction occurs, similar to that found   in many higher plants; but as it only occurs at certain seasons, it   is not likely to be met with by the student.  Other forms related to _Volvox_, and sometimes met with, are _Gonium_, in which there are sixteen cells, forming a flat square; _Pandorina_ and _Eudorina_, with sixteen cells, forming an oval or globular colony like _Volvox_, but much smaller. In all of these the structure of the cells is essentially as in _Volvox_.     CHAPTER IV.  SUB-KINGDOM II.  ALGÆ.[3]   [3] Algæ (sing. _alga_).  In the second sub-kingdom of plants is embraced an enormous assemblage of plants, differing widely in size and complexity, and yet showing a sufficiently complete gradation from the lowest to the highest as to make it impracticable to make more than one sub-kingdom to include them. They are nearly all aquatic forms, although many of them will survive long periods of drying, such forms occurring on moist earth, rocks, or the trunks of trees, but only growing when there is a plentiful supply of water.  All of them possess chlorophyll, which, however, in many forms, is hidden by the presence of a brown or red pigment. They are ordinarily divided into three classes--I. The Green Algæ (_Chlorophyceæ_); II. Brown Algæ (_Phæophyceæ_); III. Red Algæ (_Rhodophyceæ_).   CLASS I.--GREEN ALGÆ.  The green algæ are to be found almost everywhere where there is moisture, but are especially abundant in sluggish or stagnant fresh water, being much less common in salt water. They are for the most part plants of simple structure, many being unicellular, and very few of them plants of large size.  We may recognize five well-marked orders of the green algæ--I. Green slimes (_Protococcaceæ_); II. _Confervaceæ_; III. Pond scums (_Conjugatæ_); IV. _Siphoneæ_; V. Stone-worts (_Characeæ_).   ORDER I.--_Protococcaceæ_.  The members of this order are minute unicellular plants, growing either in water or on the damp surfaces of stones, tree trunks, etc. The plants sometimes grow isolated, but usually the cells are united more or less regularly into colonies.  A common representative of the order is the common green slime, _Protococcus_ (Fig. 11, _A_, _C_), which forms a dark green slimy coating over stones, tree trunks, flower pots, etc. Owing to their minute size the structure can only be made out with the microscope.  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--_Protococcaceæ._ _A_, _C_, Protococcus. _A_, single cells. _B_, cells dividing by fission. _C_, successive steps in the process of internal cell division. In _C_ iv, the young cells have mostly become free. _D_, a full-grown colony of _Pediastrum_. _E_, a young colony still surrounded by the membrane of the mother cell. _F_, _Scenedesmus_. All, × 300. _G_, small portion of a young colony of the water net (_Hydrodictyon_), × 150.]    Scraping off a little of the material mentioned into a drop of water   upon a slide, and carefully separating it with needles, a cover   glass may be placed over the preparation, and it is ready for   examination. When magnified, the green film is found to be composed   of minute globular cells of varying size, which may in places be   found to be united into groups. With a higher power, each cell   (Fig. 11, _A_) is seen to have a distinct cell wall, within which is   colorless protoplasm. Careful examination shows that the chlorophyll   is confined to several roundish bodies that are not usually in   immediate contact with the wall of the cell. These green masses are   called chlorophyll bodies (chloroplasts). Toward the centre of the   cell, especially if it has first been treated with iodine, the   nucleus may be found. The size of the cells, as well as the number   of chloroplasts, varies a good deal.    With a little hunting, specimens in various stages of division may   be found. The division takes place in two ways. In the first   (Fig. 11, _B_), known as fission, a wall is formed across the cell,   dividing it into two cells, which may separate immediately or may   remain united until they have undergone further division. In this   case the original cell wall remains as part of the wall of the   daughter cells. Fission is the commonest form of cell multiplication   throughout the vegetable kingdom.    The second form of cell division or internal cell division is shown   at _C_. Here the protoplasm and nucleus repeatedly divide until a   number of small cells are formed within the old one. These develop   cell walls, and escape by the breaking of the old cell wall, which   is left behind, and takes no part in the process. The cells thus   formed are sometimes provided with two cilia, and are capable of   active movement.    Internal cell division, as we shall see, is found in most plants,   but only at special times.    Closely resembling _Protococcus_, and answering quite as well for   study, are numerous aquatic forms, such as _Chlorococcum_ (Fig. 12).   These are for the most part destitute of a firm cell wall, but are   imbedded in masses of gelatinous substance like many _Cyanophyceæ_.   The chloroplasts are smaller and less distinct than in   _Protococcus_. The cells are here oval rather than round, and often   show a clear space at one end.  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--_Chlorococcum_, a plant related to _Protococcus_, but the naked cells are surrounded by a colorless gelatinous envelope. _A_, motionless cells. _B_, a cell that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],["title","Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#5)"],["body"," escaped from its envelope and is ciliated, × 300.]    Owing to the absence of a definite membrane, a distinction between   fission and internal cell division can scarcely be made here. Often   the cells escape from the gelatinous envelope, and swim actively by   means of two cilia at the colorless end (Fig. 12, _B_). In this   stage they closely resemble the individuals of a _Volvox_ colony, or   other green _Flagellata_, to which there is little doubt that they   are related.    There are a number of curious forms common in fresh water that are   probably related to _Protococcus_, but differ in having the cells   united in colonies of definite form. Among the most striking are   the different species of _Pediastrum_ (Fig. 11, _D_, _E_), often met   with in company with other algæ, and growing readily in aquaria when   once established. They are of very elegant shapes, and the number of   cells some multiple of four, usually sixteen.    The cells form a flat disc, the outer ones being generally provided   with a pair of spines.    New individuals arise by internal division of the cells, the   contents of each forming as many parts as there are cells in the   whole colony. The young cells now escape through a cleft in the wall   of the mother cell, but are still surrounded by a delicate membrane   (Fig. 11, _E_). Within this membrane the young cells arrange   themselves in the form of the original colony, and grow together,   forming a new colony.    A much larger but rarer form is the water net (Fig. 11, _G_), in   which the colony has the form of a hollow net, the spaces being   surrounded by long cylindrical cells placed end to end. Other common   forms belong to the genus _Scenedesmus_ (Fig. 11, _F_), of which   there are many species.   ORDER II.--_Confervaceæ_.  Under this head are included a number of forms of which the simplest ones approach closely, especially in their younger stages, the _Protococcaceæ_. Indeed, some of the so-called _Protococcaceæ_ are known to be only the early stages of these plants.  A common member of this order is _Cladophora_, a coarse-branching alga, growing commonly in running water, where it forms tufts, sometimes a metre or more in length. By floating out a little of it in a saucer, it is easy to see that it is made up of branching filaments.    The microscope shows (Fig. 13, _A_) that these filaments are rows of   cylindrical cells with thick walls showing evident stratification.   At intervals branches are given off, which may in turn branch,   giving rise to a complicated branching system. These branches begin   as little protuberances of the cell wall at the top of the cell.   They increase rapidly in length, and becoming slightly contracted at   the base, a wall is formed across at this point, shutting it off   from the mother cell.    The protoplasm lines the wall of the cell, and extends in the form   of thin plates across the cavity of the cell, dividing it up into a   number of irregular chambers. Imbedded in the protoplasm are   numerous flattened chloroplasts, which are so close together as to   make the protoplasm appear almost uniformly green. Within the   chloroplasts are globular, glistening bodies, called \"pyrenoids.\"   The cell has several nuclei, but they are scarcely evident in the   living cell. By placing the cells for a few hours in a one per cent   watery solution of chromic acid, then washing thoroughly and   staining with borax carmine, the nuclei will be made very evident   (Fig. 13, _B_). Such preparations may be kept permanently in dilute   glycerine.  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--_Cladophora._ _A_, a fragment of a plant, × 50. _B_, a single cell treated with chromic acid, and stained with alum cochineal. _n_, nucleus. _py._ pyrenoid, × 150. _C_, three stages in the division of a cell. i, 1.45 p.m.; ii, 2.55 p.m.; iii, 4.15 p.m., × 150. _D_, a zoöspore × 350.]    If a mass of actively growing filaments is examined, some of the   cells will probably be found in process of fission. The process is   very simple, and may be easily followed (Fig. 13, _C_). A ridge of   cellulose is formed around the cell wall, projecting inward, and   pushing in the protoplasm as it grows. The process is continued   until the ring closes in the middle, cutting the protoplasmic body   completely in two, and forms a firm membrane across the middle of   the cell. The protoplasm at this stage (_C_ iii.) is somewhat   contracted, but soon becomes closely applied to the new wall. The   whole process lasts, at ordinary temperatures (20°-25° C.), from   three to four hours.    At certain times, but unfortunately not often to be met with, the   contents of some of the cells form, by internal division, a large   number of small, naked cells (zoöspores) (Fig. 13, _D_), which   escape and swim about actively for a time, and afterwards become   invested with a cell wall, and grow into a new filament. These cells   are called zoöspores, from their animal-like movements. They are   provided with two cilia, closely resembling the motile cells of the   _Protococcaceæ_ and _Volvocineæ_.  There are very many examples of these simple _Confervaceæ_, some like _Conferva_ being simple rows of cells, others like _Stigeoclonium_ (Fig. 14, _A_), _Chætophora_ and _Draparnaldia_ (Fig. 14, _B_, _C_), very much branched. The two latter forms are surrounded by masses of transparent jelly, which sometimes reach a length of several centimetres.  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--_Confervaceæ_. _A_, _Stigeoclonium_. _B_, _Draparnaldia_, × 50. _C_, a piece of _Draparnaldia_, × 2. _D_, part of a filament of _Conferva_, × 300.]  Among the marine forms related to these may be mentioned the sea lettuce (_Ulva_), shown in Figure 15. The thin, bright-green, leaf-like fronds of this plant are familiar to every seaside student.  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--A plant of sea lettuce (_Ulva_). One-half natural size.]  Somewhat higher than _Cladophora_ and its allies, especially in the differentiation of the reproductive parts, are the various species of _Œdogonium_ and its relatives. There are numerous species of _Œdogonium_ not uncommon in stagnant water growing in company with other algæ, but seldom forming masses by themselves of sufficient size to be recognizable to the naked eye.    The plant is in structure much like _Cladophora_, except that it is   unbranched, and the cells have but a single nucleus (Fig. 16, _E_).   Even when not fruiting the filaments may usually be recognized by   peculiar cap-shaped structures at the top of some of the cells.   These arise as the result of certain peculiarities in the process of   cell division, which are too complicated to be explained here.    There are two forms of reproduction, non-sexual and sexual. In the   first the contents of certain cells escape in the form of large   zoöspores (Fig. 16, _C_), of oval form, having the smaller end   colorless and surrounded by a crown of cilia. After a short period   of active motion, the zoöspore comes to rest, secretes a cell wall   about itself, and the transparent end becomes flattened out into a   disc (_E_, _d_), by which it fastens itself to some object in the   water. The upper part now rapidly elongates, and dividing repeatedly   by cross walls, develops into a filament like the original one. In   many species special zoöspores are formed, smaller than the ordinary   ones, that attach themselves to the filaments bearing the female   reproductive organ (oögonium), and grow into small plants bearing   the male organ (antheridium), (Fig. 16, _B_).  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--_A_, portion of a filament of _Œdogonium_, with two oögonia (_og._). The lower one shows the opening. _B_, a similar filament, to which is attached a small male plant with an antheridium (_an._). _C_, a zoöspore of _Œdogonium_. _D_, a similar spore germinating. _E_, base of a filament showing the disc (_d_) by which it is attached. _F_, another species of _Œdogonium_ with a ripe spore (_sp._). _G_, part of a plant of _Bulbochæte_. _C_, _D_, × 300; the others × 150.]    The sexual reproduction takes place as follows: Certain cells of a   filament become distinguished by their denser contents and by an   increase in size, becoming oval or nearly globular in form (Fig. 16,   _A_, _B_). When fully grown, the contents contract and form a naked   cell, which sometimes shows a clear area at one point on the   surface. This globular mass of protoplasm is the egg cell, or female   cell, and the cell containing it is called the \"oögonium.\" When the   egg cell is ripe, the oögonium opens by means of a little pore at   one side (Fig. 16, _A_).    In other cells, either of the same filament or else of the small   male plants already mentioned, small motile cells, called   spermatozoids, are formed. These are much smaller than the egg cell,   and resemble the zoöspores in form, but are much smaller, and   without chlorophyll. When ripe they are discharged from the cells in   which they were formed, and enter the oögonium. By careful   observation the student may possibly be able to follow the   spermatozoid into the oögonium, where it enters the egg cell at the   clear spot on its surface. As a result of the entrance of the   spermatozoid (fertilization), the egg cell becomes surrounded by a   thick brown wall, and becomes a resting spore. The spore loses its   green color, and the wall becomes dark colored and differentiated   into several layers, the outer one often provided with spines   (Fig. 16, _F_). As these spores do not germinate for a long time,   the process is only known in a comparatively small number of   species, and can hardly be followed by the ordinary student.  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--_A_, plant of _Coleochæte_, × 50. _B_, a few cells from the margin, with one of the hairs.]  Much like _Œdogonium_, but differing in being branched, is the genus _Bulbochæte_, characterized also by hairs swollen at the base, and prolonged into a delicate filament (Fig. 16, _G_).
