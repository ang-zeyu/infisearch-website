Do you want to come to town and see us drill?\"  \"Will it be safe?\"  \"I think so, Marion. I don't believe the enemy are coming here very soon.\"  Soon after this Jack and Marion were on their way to Oldville, a sleepy town containing two general stores, a tavern, and a blacksmith shop.  In front of the tavern was a large green, and here a number of boys were playing various games.  \"Hurrah, here comes Captain Jack!\" was the cry, when our hero appeared.  \"Are we to drill to-day?\" questioned Darcy Gilbert, as he ran up and nodded to Marion.  \"If you will,\" said Jack. His new honors had not made him in the least dictatorial.  \"All right,\" returned Darcy.  He was first lieutenant of the company, which had styled itself the Oldville Home Guard, and he quickly summoned the young soldiers together.  All had uniforms, made of regular home suits with stripes of white sewed down the trouser-legs and around the coat-sleeves. The boys with pistols were placed in the front rank, those with guns in the second rank. One lad had a drum and another a fife.  \"Company, attention!\" ordered Jack, coming to the front with drawn sword, and the boys drew up in straight rows across the green. The drum rattled, and presently quite a crowd of old men, women, and children collected to see the drill.  \"Carry--arms!\" went on Jack, and the guns came to a carry, and likewise the pistols. \"Present--arms! Shoulder--arms! Forward--march!\"  \"Dum! dum! dum, dum, dum!\" went the drummer, and off marched the company to the end of the green.  \"Right--wheel!\" came the next command, and the boys wheeled with the order of a veteran body, for each was enthusiastic to do his best. \"Forward!\" and they marched on again, and so the marching kept up until the square had been covered several times.  \"Halt!\" Thus the commanding went on. \"Load! Take aim! Fire!\"  And twenty-odd gun and pistol hammers came down with a sharp clicking, for none of the weapons were loaded, the boys saving their powder and ball until such time as they might actually be needed. A short parade around the main streets followed, and then Jack dismissed the company.  \"It was splendid!\" cried Marion enthusiastically. \"I declare, Jack, how did you ever get them drilled so nicely?\"  \"Oh! the fellows take to it naturally. Besides, Darcy did as much as I did.\"  \"No, Jack is our chief drillmaster,\" put in Darcy. \"He takes to soldiering as a duck takes to a pond.\"  \"It's wonderful. Still, I hope you never have to go to war,\" concluded Marion.  \"If we do, we'll try to give a good account of ourselves,\" said Darcy, as Marion walked away.  \"Indeed we will!\" cried our hero.  Now she was in town Marion concluded to do some shopping, and accordingly made her way to one of the general stores, a place kept by Lemuel Blackwood, one of the oldest merchants in that part of the State.  Blackwood's store was usually crowded with goods of every description, but the war had all but wrecked his trade, and his stock was scanty and shop-worn.  \"How do you do, Marion?\" said he, when the girl entered. He had known her from childhood.  \"How do you do, Mr. Blackwood?\" she returned.  \"Pretty fairly, for an old man, Marion. That is, so far as my health goes. Business is very poor, though.\"  \"The war has taken the people's money.\"  \"Yes, yes! It is awful! Sometimes I think it will never end.\"  \"Do you think we will win, Mr. Blackwood?\"  At this the old man shook his head slowly.  \"I used to hope so, Marion. But now--the most of our best soldiers have been shot down. The North can get new recruits, but we don't seem to have many more men to go to the front.\"  \"Have you any more calico like that which I got a few weeks ago?\"  \"No, I can't get a single piece, no matter how hard I try.\"  \"What have you in plain dress goods?\"  \"Nothing but what I showed you before. I tried to get something new last week, but the wholesale houses had nothing, and couldn't say when anything new would come in. Their business has been wrecked, just as mine has been. Two of the best houses I used to do business with are bankrupt.\"  \"Then show me what you have again, please. Mamma and I must have something, even if it is out of date. We'll wear it for the honor of the South.\"  At this old Mr. Blackwood smiled. \"You are a loyal girl, Marion. I like to see it in a person, especially in one who is young. It shows the right training.\"  \"But supposing I was a Northerner,\" said Marion, with a sly twinkle in her eye.  \"It would make no difference in my opinion.\"  \"You believe people should be true to their convictions?\"  \"Yes, no matter what side they stand upon. We think we are right, and are willing to fight for our opinions. They think they are right, and they are willing to fight, too.\"  \"But who is right?\"  Mr. Blackwood shrugged his shoulders. \"Let us trust that God will bring this difficulty to a satisfactory conclusion. If we lose in this war, my one hope is that the South will not lose everything--that the North will be generous.\"  \"But they say Grant is a stubborn general. That he will demand everything of General Lee.\"  \"I cannot believe it. I have a cousin who knew Grant, and he said Grant was not so hard-hearted as painted.\"  \"Some say the South, if defeated, will be held in virtual slavery by the North.\"  \"Yes, some hot-heads say everything. I had such a fellow in here yesterday; a surgeon in our army, who gave his name as Dr. Mackey. He was ranting around, declaring that, if we lost, the Northern soldiers would march clear through to New Orleans and loot and burn every village, town, and city, and that neither life nor property would be safe. His talk was enough to scare a timid person most to death.\"  \"A surgeon in our army,\" said Marion. She had been told by Jack of the meeting on the bridge. \"What kind of a looking man was he?\"  As well as he could Mr. Blackwood described the individual.  \"Did he seem to have a finger on one hand doubled up and stiff?\"  \"Yes. Do you know him, Marion?\"  \"I know of him. He met Jack on a bridge some days ago and ordered him off as if Jack were a slave.\"  \"He appeared to be as headstrong as he was unreasonable. I have seen him around here several times, but I cannot make out what he is doing here. He asked me about the wreck on Hemlock Bluff rocks.\"  \"What!\" and Marion showed her surprise.  \"Yes. He said he had heard of the wreck and was curious to visit it.\"  \"That was strange.\"  \"I asked him why he wished to visit the wreck, but he did not answer the question.\"  At this point some other customers came in and the conversation was changed. Marion bought what she wanted and went out, and presently joined Jack on the way home.  \"It was odd that surgeon should want to visit the wreck,\" was our hero's comment, after he had heard what the girl had to say. \"I wonder if he knows anything of the ship and her passengers? If he does, I would like to interview him, uncivil as he is.\"     CHAPTER IX.  DR. MACKEY INVESTIGATES.   A few days later Old Ben was just preparing to go out in his boat when a visitor appeared at the boathouse. The man was clad in the faded uniform of a Confederate surgeon, and proved to be Dr. Mackey.  \"Good-mornin', sah,\" said Old Ben politely, as the doctor leaped from the saddle and came forward.  \"Good-morning,\" returned the surgeon shortly. \"Can you supply me with a glass of good drinking water? I left my flask at camp, and I am dry.\"  \"We has de best ob watah heah, sah,\" returned Old Ben, and proceeded to obtain a goblet. \"Does yo' belong to de army?\"  \"Yes, I am a surgeon attached to the Fifth Virginia regiment.\" The visitor gazed around him curiously. \"Is this your boathouse?\"  \"Kind o', sah. It belongs to de Ruthven plantation. But when my ole massa--Heaben bless his spirit--sot me free, he gib me de right to use de boathouse so long as I pleased. I lives in yonder cabin on de bluff.\"  \"Ah! then you were one of Mr. Ruthven's slaves?\"  \"Colonel Ruthven, sah,\" said the colored man, with emphasis on the military title.  \"He is dead?\"  \"Yes, sah; killed at de bloody battle ob Gettysburg. He was leadin' a charge when a bullet struck him in de head.\"  \"Too bad, truly. Did he leave much of a family?\"  \"A widow, sah, an' two chillen, a boy an' a girl.\"  \"I see.\" The doctor drank the water thoughtfully. \"Did--er--I mean, I think I have seen the two young people. They don't seem to resemble each other very much.\"  \"Well, you see, da aint persackly brother an' sister.\"  \"No?\" and the surgeon raised his heavy eyebrows as if in surprise.  \"No, sah. Massah Jack is only de 'dopted son ob de late colonel.\"  \"Ah, is that really so? A--er--nephew, perhaps?\"  \"No, he aint no kin to de Ruthvens. He was washed ashoah from a wrack ten or 'leben years ago. I wouldn't tell dis, only it has become public property durin' de las' two weeks.\"  Dr. Mackey started back. \"Ha! I have found the boy at last!\" he muttered to himself, as he began to walk the floor.  \"What did you say, sah?\"  \"It's quite like a romance, my man. I should like to hear more of the boy's story.\"  \"Dere aint much to tell, massah. It blowed great guns durin' dat storm. De passengers an' crew was washed ashoah from de wrack, but de only ones wot came to de beach alive was Massah Jack an' his poor dear mother.\"  \"And the mother----\" The doctor paused.  \"She only libed fo' two days. She died up to de house, leabin' de boy to Mrs. Ruthven. De missus promised to look after de boy as her own--an' she has gone dun it, too, sah.\"  \"Then Mrs. Ruthven doesn't know whose son he really is?\"  \"No, sah. De boy's mammy couldn't tell nuffin, she was so much hurt.\"  \"But what of the boy's father?\"  \"He was drowned wid de rest ob de passengers.\"  \"Hard luck--for the boy.\" The surgeon continued to pace the floor.  \"By the way, what is your name?\" he asked presently.  \"Ben, sah.\"  \"There is a dollar for you.\"  \"T'ank yo', massah; you is a real gen'man,\" and Ben's "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20432"],["title","Young Captain Jack; Or, The Son of a Soldier (#7)"],["body","relaxed into a broad smile.  \"You were going out in your boat, I believe.\"  \"Yes, massah. But if I kin do anyt'ing fo' yo'----\"  \"What of this wreck? Is it the same that one can see from the bluff?\"  \"Yes, massah, de werry same.\"  \"It's remarkable that it should survive so long.\"  \"Well, yo' see, sah, de rocks am werry high, so de most ob de storms don't git no chance at de wrack. Dat storm wot put de boat up dar was de mos' powerful dat I eber seen in all my born days.\"  \"Is it possible to board the wreck now?\"  \"Oh, yes, sah! I was ober dar only a few days ago. De ship was struck by lightning in dat las' storm, but de rain put out de fiah.\"  \"I would like to visit the wreck. I have some time to spare to-day, and I am curious to see how such a big vessel looks when cast up high and dry on the rocks.\"  \"I can take yo' ober, sah.\"  \"Very well; do so, and I'll give you another dollar.\"  \"I'll be ready in a minute, as soon as I gits my fishing tackle an' bait out of de boat, sah.\"  Ben hurried to his craft. As he was lifting his things out he saw a man strolling near. The individual proved to be St. John Ruthven, who had come in that direction in hope of seeing Marion alone.  \"Hullo, Ben!\" cried St. John. \"See anything of Marion to-day?\"  \"She dun went out in a boat, sah.\"  \"With Jack?\"  \"Yes, sah.\"  \"What, after that experience in the storm?\"  \"Yes, sah.\"  \"I should think they would be afraid.\"  \"Da aint so afraid as some folks is, Massah St. John.\"  \"Do you mean that as an insult to me, you good-for-nothing nigger?\"  \"No, sah. I mean Miss Marion an' Massah Jack are wery stout-hearted.\"  \"My aunt is foolish to let Marion go out with that boy. Some day Marion will be drowned.\"  \"Jack knows wot he is doin', I rackon, sah.\"  \"You don't know him. He is thoroughly reckless. I presume as a nobody his life isn't worth much, but----\"  \"I rackon his life is as sweet to him as yours is to yo', Massah St. John.\"  \"Can you take me out in a boat after them?\"  \"Sorry, sah, but I'se gwine to take dis gen'man out, sah.\"  St. John turned and saw Dr. Mackey standing near, the surgeon having come from the boathouse to listen in silence to the conversation which was taking place.  He had met the doctor at the Oldville tavern the evening before, and bowed stiffly.  \"I am sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Ruthven,\" said the doctor; \"but I am curious to visit the old wreck on Hemlock Bluff rocks. Perhaps this man has another boat----\"  \"Oh, it doesn't matter, Dr. Mackey,\" answered St. John.  \"You are evidently a cousin to Miss Marion Ruthven.\"  \"I am.\"  \"And a cousin to the lad named Jack.\"  \"He is no cousin of mine--even though my aunt has foolishly treated him as her son.\"  \"Why foolishly?\"  \"He is a waif of the sea--cast up from that wreck; yet my aunt presents him to the world as a Ruthven--when he may be of very low birth.\"  \"Evidently you are proud of your name.\"  \"I am proud, sir, for there is no family in South Carolina which bears a better name. We are descended from St. George Ruthven, one of the knights of Queen Elizabeth's reign.\"  \"I congratulate you, sir, and I now understand how this matter grates upon you. But permit me to state, the boy may prove to be of as high birth as yourself.\"  \"What, Jack? Never!\"  \"Do not say that. Strange things have happened in this world.\"  \"But he looks as if he came of low birth,\" responded St. John haughtily.  \"There I must disagree with you, Mr. Ruthven.\"  \"Dat's de talk!\" muttered Old Ben, as he eyed St. John darkly. \"Massah Jack's as good as dat coward any day!\"  \"As you please, doctor; but I shall hold to my opinion.\"  Dr. Mackey shrugged his shoulders.  \"You have that right. Come, Ben, we will be on the way. Mr. Ruthven, allow me to bid you good-day,\" and the doctor bowed stiffly.  \"Good-day,\" was the curt response.  Soon the surgeon and Old Ben were in the boat, and the negro was rowing swiftly in the direction of the wreck. St. John walked up the shore, but presently turned to view the doctor from a distance.  \"He talks as if he knew a thing or two,\" muttered the spendthrift to himself. \"Can it be possible that he knows something of the past, and is going out to the wreck for a purpose?\"     CHAPTER X.  THE PAPERS ON THE WRECK.   As the waters of the bay were quiet, it did not take Ben long to row Dr. Mackey over to the wreck on the rocks.  \"Be careful how you steps out, sah,\" said the colored man. \"De rocks am slippery, an' you kin twist an ankle widout half tryin', sah.\"  \"I will be careful, Ben. So this is the wreck?\"  \"Yes, sah.\"  \"I presume all that was movable in the ship has been carried off?\"  \"Long ago, sah.\"  \"But the inside of the ship itself was not torn out?\"  \"No, sah. De folks around yeah is too afraid ob ghosteses fo' dat.\"  \"Ah, yes! so I heard--at least, I would suppose so,\" replied the doctor, in some confusion. \"By the way, you need not remain here. I will visit the wreck alone. You can come back in an hour or so.\"  \"Wery well, massah.\"  \"But don't forget to come back. I don't want to be left here all night.\"  \"Don't worry, sah; I'll be back fo' dat dollah, sah,\" and Ben grinned.  \"Oh, yes! I forgot about the dollar. Well, you shall have it when you take me back to shore.\"  The doctor walked slowly toward the wreck, glancing back several times to see if Old Ben was following him.  The colored man rowed away in a thoughtful mood.  \"Somet'ing is on dat man's mind, suah!\" he muttered to himself. \"He's gwine ter do somet'ing.\"  With difficulty the surgeon climbed up to the deck of the wreck. A desolate spectacle presented itself. Everything was charred by the fire.  \"Truly a nice place to come to,\" said the man to himself. \"Now, supposing this thing turns out a wild-goose chase, after all? Let me see, the stateroom was No. 15. I wonder if I can still locate it?\"  With caution he descended the companion way and entered the main cabin of the stranded vessel. Here he drew from his pocket a candle and lit it.  He walked slowly toward the side of the cabin until he reached a stateroom bearing the number 7 upon the door.  \"Seven,\" he murmured. \"And the second from this is eleven. That shows the numbers on this side are all odd. The next must be thirteen, and the next fifteen.\"  He held the candle to the door, but the number plate was gone. Without hesitation he pushed upon the door, which was already partly open. It fell back, exposing the interior of the stateroom, now bare of all things movable, and covered with dust and cobwebs.  \"A dirty job this,\" he murmured, and set the candle down upon a beam running along the side of a wall. He gazed around the stateroom curiously, as if hardly knowing what to do next.  \"The little closet was set in the wall at the foot of the bed. Now which was the foot of the bed? I'll try both ends.\" He did so, tapping on the woodwork with his knuckles. Presently he found a hole where there had once been a small knob.  \"The closet, sure enough!\" he cried, and his face took on a new interest. \"Now where is that door-knob?\"  He hunted on the floor, but no knob came to view. But a bent nail was handy, and this he inserted into the hole sideways, and pulled with all his force. There was a slight creak, and a small door came open, revealing a dark closet about a foot square and equally deep.  If the room was dirty the closet was more so, for a crack at the top had let in both dirt and water, and at first he could see nothing but a solid cake of dirt before him. Digging into this, he presently uncovered a heavy tin box, painted black.  \"Eureka! the box at last!\" he cried, in a tone full of pleasure. \"I am the lucky one, after all!\"  He brought the tin box forth and brushed it off. There was a little padlock in front, and this was locked. Bringing a bunch of keys from his pocket, he began to try them, one after another. At last he found one to fit, and opened the box.  \"The papers at last!\" he murmured, and his eyes gleamed with expectation. \"Let me see what there is.\" He turned them over. \"The marriage certificate for one, and letters from his father about that property. And other letters from her folks--all here, and just what I wanted.\" He shoved the documents back into the box. \"The fortune is mine!\"  Returning to the closet he cleaned it out thoroughly, to learn if it contained anything more of value. But there was nothing more there, and presently he blew out the candle, hid the tin box under his coat, and returned to the deck.  Ben was rowing not far away and saw the doctor wave his hand.  \"Is yo' ready, massah?\" he called out.  \"Yes, Ben.\"  The colored man said no more, but rowed inshore, and in the meantime the doctor hurried down to meet him.  \"Did you find any gold, massah?\" asked the colored man, his white teeth gleaming.  \"Gold! Why, you foolish nigger, what chance is there of finding gold on a wreck over ten years old? The best thing you can do is to break the boat to pieces and take the wood ashore for fuel.\"  \"But de ghosteses, massah! Besides, Mrs. Ruthven wouldn't let us touch dat wrack nohow.\"  \"On account of the boy, I suppose.\"  \"Yes, massah.\"  \"To tell the truth, my man, I have now as much interest in that ship as has that boy or Mrs. Ruthven. It brings back an exciting passage in my life. My visit to the wreck was made to satisfy me concerning several important questions. I was one of the passengers on that ill-fated ship!\"  \"Golly, massah, yo' don't really mean dat?\" And Old Ben's eyes opened widely.  \"Yes, I do. I suspected it before; now I am dead certain of it.\"  At this declaration Old Ben grew quite excited.  \"And did yo' know Massah Jack's fadder, sah?\"  \"Yes, my man, I knew him very well,\" and there was a significant smile on the doctor's face as he spoke.  \"And was he a gen'man, sah? St. John Ruthven t'inks he was common white trash.\"  \"He was a gentleman of high family--the son of an English nobleman, although born in this country.\"  \"An' Jack's mudder, sah?\"  \"Was an American lady--a lady belonging to one of the"]]]
