[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2018"],["title","The Library (#7)"],["body","   covetousness, and the covetous man who is in the extreme state of     book-loving, is the biblioklept, or book-stealer.  Now his vice shows     itself, not in contemplation (for of contemplation there can be no     excess), but in action.  For books are procured, as we say, by     purchase, or by barter, and these are voluntary exchanges, both the     seller and the buyer being willing to deal.  But books are, again,     procured in another way, by involuntary contract—that is, when the     owner of the book is unwilling to part with it, but he whose own the     book is not is determined to take it.  The book-stealer is such a man     as this, and he possesses himself of books with which the owner does     not intend to part, by virtue of a series of involuntary contracts.     Again, the question may be raised, whether is the Robustious     Philistine who despises books, or the biblioklept who adores them out     of measure and excessively, the worse citizen?  Now, if we are to     look to the consequences of actions only (as the followers of Bentham     advise), clearly the Robustious Philistine is the worse citizen, for     he mangles, and dirties, and destroys books which it is the interest     of the State to preserve.  But the biblioklept treasures and adorns     the books he has acquired; and when he dies, or goes to prison, the     State receives the benefit at his sale.  Thus Libri, who was the     greatest of biblioklepts, rescued many of the books he stole from     dirt and misuse, and had them bound royally in purple and gold.     Also, it may be argued that books naturally belong to him who can     appreciate them; and if good books are in a dull or indifferent man’s     keeping, this is the sort of slavery which we call “unnatural” in our     _Politics_, and which is not to be endured.  Shall we say, then, that     the Robustious Philistine is the worse citizen, while the Biblioklept     is the worse man?  But this is perhaps matter for a separate     disquisition.”  This fragment of the lost Aristotelian treatise “Concerning Books,” shows what a difficulty the Stagirite had in determining the precise nature of the moral offence of the biblioklept.  Indeed, both as a collector and as an intuitive moralist, Aristotle must have found it rather difficult to condemn the book-thief.  He, doubtless, went on to draw distinctions between the man who steals books to sell them again for mere pecuniary profit (which he would call “chrematistic,” or “unnatural,” book-stealing), and the man who steals them because he feels that he is their proper and natural possessor.  The same distinction is taken by Jules Janin, who was a more constant student of Horace than of Aristotle. In his imaginary dialogue of bibliophiles, Janin introduces a character who announces the death of M. Libri.  The tolerant person who brings the sad news proposes “to cast a few flowers on the melancholy tomb.  He was a bibliophile, after all.  What do you say to it?  Many a good fellow has stolen books, and died in grace at the last.”  “Yes,” replies the president of the club, “but the good fellows did not sell the books they stole . . . Cest une grande honte, une grande misère.”  This Libri was an Inspector-General of French Libraries under Louis Philippe.  When he was tried, in 1848, it was calculated that the sum of his known thefts amounted to £20,000.  Many of his robberies escaped notice at the time. It is not long since Lord Ashburnham, according to a French journal, “Le Livre,” found in his collection some fragments of a Pentateuch.  These relics had been in the possession of the Lyons Library, whence Libri stole them in 1847.  The late Lord Ashburnham bought them, without the faintest idea of Libri’s dishonesty; and when, after eleven years, the present peer discovered the proper owners of his treasure, he immediately restored the Pentateuch to the Lyons Library.  Many eminent characters have been biblioklepts.  When Innocent X. was still Monsignor Pamphilio, he stole a book—so says Tallemant des Réaux—from Du Monstier, the painter.  The amusing thing is that Du Monstier himself was a book-thief.  He used to tell how he had lifted a book, of which he had long been in search, from a stall on the Pont-Neuf; “but,” says Tallemant (whom Janin does not seem to have consulted), “there are many people who don’t think it thieving to steal a book unless you sell it afterwards.”  But Du Monstier took a less liberal view where his own books were concerned.  The Cardinal Barberini came to Paris as legate, and brought in his suite Monsignor Pamphilio, who afterwards became Innocent X.  The Cardinal paid a visit to Du Monstier in his studio, where Monsignor Pamphilio spied, on a table, “L’Histoire du Concile de Trent”—the good edition, the London one.  “What a pity,” thought the young ecclesiastic, “that such a man should be, by some accident, the possessor of so valuable a book.”  With these sentiments Monsignor Pamphilio slipped the work under his _soutane_.  But little Du Monstier observed him, and said furiously to the Cardinal, that a holy man should not bring thieves and robbers in his company.  With these words, and with others of a violent and libellous character, he recovered the “History of the Council of Trent,” and kicked out the future Pope. Amelot de la Houssaie traces to this incident the hatred borne by Innocent X. to the Crown and the people of France.  Another Pope, while only a cardinal, stole a book from Ménage—so M. Janin reports—but we have not been able to discover Ménage’s own account of the larceny.  The anecdotist is not so truthful that cardinals need flush a deeper scarlet, like the roses in Bion’s “Lament for Adonis,” on account of a scandal resting on the authority of Ménage.  Among Royal persons, Catherine de Medici, according to Brantôme, was a biblioklept.  “The Marshal Strozzi had a very fine library, and after his death the Queen-Mother seized it, promising some day to pay the value to his son, who never got a farthing of the money.”  The Ptolemies, too, were thieves on a large scale.  A department of the Alexandrian Library was called “The Books from the Ships,” and was filled with rare volumes stolen from passengers in vessels that touched at the port.  True, the owners were given copies of their ancient MSS., but the exchange, as Aristotle says, was an “involuntary” one, and not distinct from robbery.  The great pattern of biblioklepts, a man who carried his passion to the most regrettable excesses, was a Spanish priest, Don Vincente, of the convent of Pobla, in Aragon.  When the Spanish revolution despoiled the convent libraries, Don Vincente established himself at Barcelona, under the pillars of Los Encantes, where are the stalls of the merchants of _bric-à-brac_ and the seats of them that sell books.  In a gloomy den the Don stored up treasures which he hated to sell.  Once he was present at an auction where he was out-bid in the competition for a rare, perhaps a unique, volume.  Three nights after that, the people of Barcelona were awakened by cries of “Fire!”  The house and shop of the man who had bought “Ordinacions per los gloriosos reys de Arago” were blazing.  When the fire was extinguished, the body of the owner of the house was found, with a pipe in his blackened hand, and some money beside him.  Every one said, “He must have set the house on fire with a spark from his pipe.” Time went on, and week by week the police found the bodies of slain men, now in the street, now in a ditch, now in the river.  There were young men and old, all had been harmless and inoffensive in their lives, and—all had been _bibliophiles_.  A dagger in an invisible hand had reached their hearts but the assassin had spared their purses, money, and rings.  An organised search was made in the city, and the shop of Don Vincente was examined.  There, in a hidden recess, the police discovered the copy of “Ordinacions per los gloriosis reys de Arago,” which ought by rights to have been burned with the house of its purchaser.  Don Vincente was asked how he got the book.  He replied in a quiet voice, demanded that his collection should be made over to the Barcelona Library, and then confessed a long array of crimes.  He had strangled his rival, stolen the “Ordinacions,” and burned the house.  The slain men were people who had bought from him books which he really could not bear to part with.  At his trial his counsel tried to prove that his confession was false, and that he might have got his books by honest means.  It was objected that there was in the world only one book printed by Lambert Palmart in 1482, and that the prisoner must have stolen this, the only copy, from the library where it was treasured.  The defendant’s counsel proved that there was another copy in the Louvre; that, therefore, there might be more, and that the defendant’s might have been honestly procured.  Here Don Vincente, previously callous, uttered an hysterical cry.  Said the Alcalde:—“At last, Vincente, you begin to understand the enormity of your offence?”  “Ah, Señor Alcalde, my error was clumsy indeed.  If you only knew how miserable I am!”  “If human justice prove inflexible, there is another justice whose pity is inexhaustible. Repentance is never too late.”  “Ah, Señor Alcalde, but my copy was not unique!”  With the story of this impenitent thief we may close the roll of biblioklepts, though Dibdin pretends that Garrick was of the company, and stole Alleyne’s books at Dulwich.  There is a thievish nature more hateful than even the biblioklept.  The Book-Ghoul is he who combines the larceny of the biblioklept with the abominable wickedness of breaking up and mutilating the volumes from which he steals.  He is a collector of title-pages, frontispieces, illustrations, and book-plates.  He prowls furtively among public and private libraries, inserting wetted threads, which slowly eat away the illustrations he covets; and he broods, like the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2018"],["title","The Library (#8)"],["body","demon of Arabian superstitions, over the fragments of the mighty dead.  His disgusting tastes vary.  He prepares books for the American market.  Christmas books are sold in the States stuffed with pictures cut out of honest volumes. Here is a quotation from an American paper:—      “Another style of Christmas book which deserves to be mentioned,     though it is out of the reach of any but the very rich, is the     historical or literary work enriched with inserted plates.  There has     never, to our knowledge, been anything offered in America so     supremely excellent as the $5000 book on Washington, we     think—exhibited by Boston last year, but not a few fine specimens of     books of this class are at present offered to purchasers.  Scribner     has a beautiful copy of Forster’s ‘Life of Dickens,’ enlarged from     three volumes octavo to nine volumes quarto, by taking to pieces,     remounting, and inlaying.  It contains some eight hundred engravings,     portraits, views, playbills, title-pages, catalogues, proof     illustrations from Dickens’s works, a set of the Onwhyn plates, rare     engravings by Cruikshank and ‘Phiz,’ and autograph letters.  Though     this volume does not compare with Harvey’s Dickens, offered for $1750     two years ago, it is an excellent specimen of books of this sort, and     the veriest tyro in bibliographical affairs knows how scarce are     becoming the early editions of Dickens’s works and the plates     illustrating them. {4}  Anything about Dickens in the beginning of     his career is a sound investment from a business point of view.     Another work of the same sort, valued at $240, is Lady Trevelyan’s     edition of Macaulay, illustrated with portraits, many of them very     rare.  Even cheaper, all things considered, is an extra-illustrated     copy of the ‘Histoire de la Gravure,’ which, besides its     seventy-three reproductions of old engravings, is enriched with two     hundred fine specimens of the early engravers, many of the     impressions being in first and second states.  At $155 such a book is     really a bargain, especially for any one who is forming a collection     of engravings.  Another delightful work is the library edition of     Bray’s ‘Evelyn,’ illustrated with some two hundred and fifty     portraits and views, and valued at $175; and still another is     Boydell’s ‘Milton,’ with plates after Westall, and further     illustrations in the shape of twenty-eight portraits of the painter     and one hundred and eighty-one plates, and many of them before     letter.  The price of this book is $325.”  But few book-ghouls are worse than the moral ghoul.  He defaces, with a pen, the passages, in some precious volume, which do not meet his idea of moral propriety.  I have a Pine’s “Horace,” with the engravings from gems, which has fallen into the hands of a moral ghoul.  Not only has he obliterated the verses which hurt his delicate sense, but he has actually scraped away portions of the classical figures, and “the breasts of the nymphs in the brake.”  The soul of Tartuffe had entered into the body of a sinner of the last century.  The antiquarian ghoul steals title-pages and colophons.  The aesthetic ghoul cuts illuminated initials out of manuscripts.  The petty, trivial, and almost idiotic ghoul of our own days, sponges the fly-leaves and boards of books for the purpose of cribbing the book-plates.  An old “Complaint of a Book-plate,” in dread of the wet sponge of the enemy, has been discovered by Mr. Austin Dobson:—{5}                            THE BOOK-PLATE’S PETITION.                         _By a Gentleman of the Temple_.      While cynic CHARLES still trimm’d the vane     ’Twixt Querouaille and Castlemaine,     In days that shocked JOHN EVELYN,     My First Possessor fix’d me in.     In days of Dutchmen and of frost,     The narrow sea with JAMES I cross’d,     Returning when once more began     The Age of Saturn and of ANNE.     I am a part of all the past;     I knew the GEORGES, first and last;     I have been oft where else was none     Save the great wig of ADDISON;     And seen on shelves beneath me grope     The little eager form of POPE.     I lost the Third that own’d me when     French NOAILLES fled at Dettingen;     The year JAMES WOLFE surpris’d Quebec,     The Fourth in hunting broke his neck;     The day that WILLIAM HOGARTH dy’d,     The Fifth one found me in Cheapside.     This was a Scholar, one of those     Whose Greek is sounder than their hose;     He lov’d old Books and nappy ale,     So liv’d at Streatham, next to THRALE.     ’Twas there this stain of grease I boast     Was made by Dr. JOHNSON’S toast.     (He did it, as I think, for Spite;     My Master call’d him Jacobite!)     And now that I so long to-day     Have rested post discrimina,     Safe in the brass-wir’d book-case where     I watch’d the Vicar’s whit’ning hair,     Must I these travell’d bones inter     In some Collector’s sepulchre!     Must I be torn from hence and thrown     With frontispiece and colophon!     With vagrant E’s, and I’s, and O’s,     The spoil of plunder’d Folios!     With scraps and snippets that to ME     Are naught but kitchen company!     Nay, rather, FRIEND, this favour grant me:     Tear me at once; but don’t transplant me.      CHELTENHAM, _Septr_. 31, 1792.  The conceited ghoul writes his notes across our fair white margins, in pencil, or in more baneful ink.  Or he spills his ink bottle at large over the pages, as André Chénier’s friend served his copy of Malherbe. It is scarcely necessary to warn the amateur against the society of book-ghouls, who are generally snuffy and foul in appearance, and by no means so insinuating as that fair lady-ghoul, Amina, of the Arabian Nights.  Another enemy of books must be mentioned with the delicacy that befits the topic.  Almost all women are the inveterate foes, not of novels, of course, nor peerages and popular volumes of history, but of books worthy of the name.  It is true that Isabelle d’Este, and Madame de Pompadour, and Madame de Maintenon, were collectors; and, doubtless, there are other brilliant exceptions to a general rule.  But, broadly speaking, women detest the books which the collector desires and admires.  First, they don’t understand them; second, they are jealous of their mysterious charms; third, books cost money; and it really is a hard thing for a lady to see money expended on what seems a dingy old binding, or yellow paper scored with crabbed characters.  Thus ladies wage a skirmishing war against booksellers’ catalogues, and history speaks of husbands who have had to practise the guile of smugglers when they conveyed a new purchase across their own frontier.  Thus many married men are reduced to collecting Elzevirs, which go readily into the pocket, for you cannot smuggle a folio volume easily.  This inveterate dislike of books often produces a very deplorable result when an old collector dies.  His “womankind,” as the Antiquary called them, sell all his treasures for the price of waste-paper, to the nearest country bookseller.  It is a melancholy duty which forces one to introduce such topics into a volume on “Art at Home.”  But this little work will not have been written in vain if it persuades ladies who inherit books not to sell them hastily, without taking good and disinterested opinion as to their value.  They often dispose of treasures worth thousands, for a ten pound note, and take pride in the bargain.  Here, let history mention with due honour the paragon of her sex and the pattern to all wives of book-collecting men—Madame Fertiault.  It is thus that she addresses her lord in a charming triolet (“Les Amoureux du Livre,” p. xxxv):—      “Le livre a ton esprit . . . tant mieux!     Moi, j’ai ton coeur, et sans partage.     Puis-je désirer davantage?     Le livre a ton esprit . . . tant mieux!     Heureuse de te voir joyeux,     Je t’en voudrais . . . tout un étage.     Le livre a ton esprit . . . tant mieux!     Moi, j’ai ton coeur, et sans partage.”      Books rule thy mind, so let it be!     Thy heart is mine, and mine alone.     What more can I require of thee?     Books rule thy mind, so let it be!     Contented when thy bliss I see,     I wish a world of books thine own.     Books rule thy mind, so let it be!     Thy heart is mine, and mine alone.    [Picture: M. Annei Lucani de Bello Civili Libri X.  Apud Seb. Gryphium                              Lugduni.  1551]  There is one method of preserving books, which, alas, only tempts the borrower, the stealer, the rat, and the book-worm; but which is absolutely necessary as a defence against dust and neglect.  This is binding.  The bookbinder’s art too often destroys books when the artist is careless, but it is the only mode of preventing our volumes from falling to pieces, and from being some day disregarded as waste-paper.  A well-bound book, especially a book from a famous collection, has its price, even if its literary contents be of trifling value.  A leather coat fashioned by Derome, or Le Gascon, or Duseuil, will win respect and careful handling for one specimen of an edition whereof all the others have perished.  Nothing is so slatternly as the aspect of a book merely stitched, in the French fashion, when the threads begin to stretch, and the paper covers to curl and be torn.  Worse consequences follow, whole sheets are lost, the volume becomes worthless, and the owner must often be at the expense of purchasing another copy, if he can, for the edition may now be out of print.  Thus binding of some sort not only adds a grace to the library, presenting to the eye the cheerful gilded rows of our volumes, but is a positive economy.  In the case of our cloth-covered English works, the need of binding is not so immediately obvious.  But our publishers have a taste for clothing their editions in tender tones of colour, stamped, often, with landscapes printed in gold, in white, or what not.  Covers"]]]
