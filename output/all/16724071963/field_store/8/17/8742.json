A couple of minutes later, Bang! bang! bang! bang! and the boom and crash of the guns. Presently you would see the two birds, high up, returning to their aerodrome. They had gone up to the Boche trenches, in the eye of the sun, machine-gunning them and dropping small bombs.  The Butte de Warlencourt looked very beautiful in the afternoon light that summer. Pale gold against the eastern sky, with the mangled remains of trees and houses, which was once Le Sars, on its left. But what must it have looked like when the Somme was covered with snow, and the white-garmented Tommies used to raid it at night? It must surely have been a ghostly sight then, in the winter of 1916.  About this time I went to Paris several week-ends at odd times and painted for the Canadians Generals Burstall, Watson and Lipsett, also Major O'Connor. Poor Lipsett was killed by a shell later. He was a thoughtful, clever, quiet man, and was greatly respected. Burstall was a great, bluff, big, hearty fellow, and Watson was a fine chap, a real \"sport.\" O'Connor was A.D.C. to General Currie, and had been twice wounded.  Paris! What a city!    \"Paree!   That's the place for me.   Just across the sea   From Dover!\"     CHAPTER VII                                                           (p. 050)  WITH THE FLYING CORPS (OCTOBER 1917)   About this time, the C.-in-C. was granted the Order of a Knighthood of the Thistle. It was given to him by the King during his visit to France in a château at Cassel. No one was present when he received this honour. Just afterwards I did a little interior of the room.  General Trenchard and Maurice Baring chose out two flying boys for me to paint, and they sat to me at Cassel. One was 2nd Lieutenant A. P. Rhys Davids, D.S.O., M.C., a great youth. He had brought down a lot of Germans, including two cracks, Schaffer and Voss. The first time I saw him was at the aerodrome at Estre Blanche. I watched him land in his machine, just back from over the lines. Out he got, stuck his hands in his pockets, and laughed and talked about the flight with Hoidge and others of the patrol, and his Major, Bloomfield. A fine lad, Rhys Davids, with a far-seeing, clear eye. He hated fighting, hated flying, loved books and was terribly anxious for the war to be over, so that he could get to Oxford. He had been captain of Eton the year before, so he was an all-round chap, and must have been a magnificent pilot. The 56th Squadron was very sad when he was reported missing, and refused to believe for one moment that he had been killed till they got the certain news. It was a great loss.  The other airman chosen was Captain Hoidge, M.C. and Bar--\"George\"    (p. 051) of Toronto. Hoidge had also brought down a lot of Germans. His face was wonderfully fitted for a man-bird. His eyes were bird's eyes. A good lad was Hoidge, and I became very fond of him afterwards. I arranged with Maurice Baring and Major Bloomfield that Hoidge was to come to Cassel one morning at 11 a.m. to sit to me. The morning arrived and 11 o'clock and no Hoidge. Eleven-thirty, 12--no Hoidge. About 12:30 he strolled into the yard and I heard him asking for me in a slow voice. I was raging with anger by this time. He came upstairs and I told him there was no use doing anything before lunch, and that we had better go down and get some food. We ate silently. I could see he was rather depressed. About halfway through our meal, he said: \"I'm lucky to be here with you this morning!\" \"Why?\" said I. \"Oh,\" he said, \"I made a damned fool of myself this morning. Let an old Boche get on my tail. Damned fool I was--with my experience. Never saw the blighter. I was following an old two-seater at the time. He put a bullet through the box by my head, and cut two of my stays. If old B. hadn't happened to come up and chased him off I was for it. Damned fool! But the morning wasn't wasted, afterwards I got two two-seaters.\" I said: \"Do you realise you have killed four men this morning?\" \"No,\" he said, \"but I winged two damned nice birds.\" Then we went upstairs and he sat like a lamb.  [Illustration: XX. _Lieut. A. P. F. Rhys Davids, D.S.O., M.C._]  One evening, during the King's stay at Cassel, I was working in my room about 7 o'clock, when a little scrap of paper was brought me on which was written, \"I am dining downstairs.--M. B.\" I went downstairs and there was Maurice Baring, and, with luck for me, alone. We had a great dinner. He was in his best form; for after dinner we went up to my room and sat by the open window and talked and talked. Suddenly    (p. 052) Maurice stopped, and said: \"What's that noise?\" \"What noise?\" said I. So we looked down into the courtyard--only about ten feet--and there was \"Boom,\" who had been dining with the King, and Philip Sassoon. \"What the devil are you two doing?\" said \"Boom.\" \"We've both been shouting ourselves hoarse for ten minutes. It's the last damned time you dine with Orpen, Maurice!\" It's true we never heard them--but then Maurice was talking.  One morning, when the wind was very fresh, I got a telephone message from Major Bloomfield telling me to come to the squadron at once and see some \"crashes.\" It was a glorious morning, blue sky, with great white clouds sailing by. I got down to the squadron as quickly as I could. A whole lot of novices from England had been sent out on trials, and the Major expected \"great fun\" when they landed.  The fire was made big and a great line of blue smoke whirled down the aerodrome to give the direction of the wind. Presently they began to come back. Some landed beautifully--one in particular--and the Major said to me: \"Come on, I must go and congratulate that chap,\" and started running for the machine. When we got closer, he stopped and said: \"Damn it! it's Hoidge, I forgot he was out.\"  I remember one poor chap in particular. He circled the aerodrome twelve times, each time coming down for a landing and each time funking it at the last moment. At last he did land, two or three bumps, and then--apparently slowly--the machine's nose went to the ground and gracefully it turned turtle. \"Come along,\" said the Major, and when we got to the machine the wretched pilot was getting out from under it. \"You unspeakable creature,\" said the Major. \"Don't let me see your face again for twenty-four hours.\" And away limped the       (p. 053) \"unspeakable creature,\" covered with oil and dirt. I must add that after lunch the Major went up to him and patted his back and said he hoped he felt none the worse. But the thing that amazed me was, that although the machine seemed to land so gently, the damage to it was terrific--propeller and all sorts of strong things smashed to bits.  [Illustration: XXI. _Lieut. R. T. C. Hoidge, M.C._]  Ping-pong was the great game at this squadron (56th), and I used to play with a lot of them, including Hoidge and McCudden, but I did not know the latter's name at that time. It was before he became famous.  One day I went there with Maurice Baring, and the Major was greatly excited because they had just finished making a little circular saw to cut firewood for the squadron for the winter. The Major had a great idea that, as the A.D.C. to \"Boom\" was lunching, after lunch there would be an \"official\" opening of the circular saw. It was agreed that all officers and men were to attend (no flying was possible that day) and that Maurice should make a speech, after which he was to cut the end of a cigar with the saw, then a box was made with a glass front in which the cigar was to be placed after the A.D.C. had smoked a little of it, and the box was to be hung in the mess of the squadron. It was all a great success. Maurice made a splendid speech. We all cheered, and then the cigar was cut (to bits nearly). Maurice smoked a little, and it was put safely in its box. Then Maurice was given the first log to cut. This was done, but Maurice was now worked up, so he took his cap off and cut this in halves. He was then proceeding to take off his tunic for the same purpose, but was carried away from the scene of execution by a cheering crowd. It was a great day. I remember Maurice saw me back to Cassel about 1 a.m., after much ping-pong and music.   (p. 054) \"I'll go back to the shack where the black-eyed Susans,\" etc., was the song of the moment then in the squadron.  Shortly after this Major Bloomfield was ordered home, promoted and, I think, sent to America. At this loss, a great gloom fell over the 56th Squadron. I never saw any squadron in France that was run nearly so well as the 56th under Bloomfield, nor any Major loved more by his boys.  [Illustration: XXII. _The Return of a Patrol._]     CHAPTER VIII                                                          (p. 055)  CASSEL AND IN HOSPITAL (NOVEMBER 1917)   About this time I went to Paris and met several Generals and Mr. Andrew Weir (now Lord Inverforth), and it was arranged that Aikman was to go home to the War Office and that I, perhaps, might have my brother out later to look after me. Aikman left, and I was very lonely. A better-hearted companion and a kinder man one could not meet, and regarding the intricacies of \"King's Regulations\" and such-like things, he was a past master.  After this, whenever I went to Paris, the great thing was to stop on the way at Clermont and lunch with \"Hunchie.\" \"Hunchie\" kept the buffet at the station. He had a broken back and had been a chemist in Paris, but said he had come to the station at Clermont for excitement. It was so exciting that Maude proposed stopping there for a rest cure! But \"Hunchie's\" lunches were excellent. I remember one day on my way to Paris, I asked him at lunch if he had any Worcestershire Sauce; he had not. He asked me when I was coming back North again. I said the next day, which I did, and stopped for lunch. He had the sauce. He had been to Paris to get it. \"Hunchie\" was a wonder, so was Madame, and "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20215"],["title","An Onlooker in France 1917-1919 (#8)"],["body","was their dog \"Black.\"  One spot in Paris, the Gare du Nord, will always mean a lot to the British Army on the Western Front. What sights one saw there!--masses of humanity, mostly British officers and men, each with their little  (p. 056) \"movement order\": there they were in the heart of the Gay City. Yet that little slip of paper would, in a couple of hours, send them to Amiens, and a little later they would be at the front suffering Hell. Laboreur did a wonderful etching of an officer bidding farewell to his wife at the Gare du Nord. It gave the whole tragedy of the place--the blackness, smoke, smell and crush. There, any night during an air raid, one could not help thinking what would happen if the Boche got a bomb on the Gare, with its thousands of fighting men all jambed together under its glass roof in the semi-darkness. What a slaughter! And yet through it all, if the old Gare could only speak, it could tell some strange and amusing tales of that time--tales that would make one laugh, but with the laughter there would be a catch in the throat and a swimming in the eyes. It is extraordinary how funny sometimes the most tragic things can be.  The weather had become very bad and cold, and I worked on all impossible out-of-door days in my room in the \"Hôtel de la Paix,\" which was known as the \"Bar.\" My only rule was that the \"Bar\" was not open till 6.30 p.m. At times it nearly rivalled \"Charlie's Bar.\" At what hour the \"Bar\" closed I was not always certain, as, no matter who was there, at about 10:30 I used to undress and go to bed, and so accustomed did I get to the clink of glasses and the squirt of the syphons that I slept calmly through it all. Among the regular attendants when in Amiens were Captain Maude, \"Major\" Hogg, Colonel MacDowall of the 42nd G.H., Colonel Woodcock, Colonel Belfield (the Spot King), Captain Ernest Courage (Jorrocks), Captains Hale and Inge (then of the Press), Bedelo (Italian correspondent), and Captain Brickman--a merry lot, taking them all round, and that room heard some good stories; some may have been not quite nice, but none were as     (p. 057) dirty or disreputable as the room itself, with its smell of mud, paint, drink, smoke, and the fumes from the famous \"Flamme Bleue\" stove. The last man to leave the bar had to open the window. This was a firm rule. It sometimes took the last man a long time to do it, but it was always done.  [Illustration: XXIII. _Changing Billets._]  By this period of the war nearly every French girl could speak some English, and great was their anger if one could not understand them. I remember a very nice girl, who worked at the \"Hôtel de la Paix,\" came to me one day and said solemnly, \"My grandfadder he kill him.\" \"Gracious!\" I said, \"whom did he kill?\" \"He kill him,\" was the furious reply. Apparently the poor grandfather, living under German rule at Landrecies, had committed suicide.  I went back to Cassel and began to itch, mildly at first, and I was not in the least put out. My brother came to France, and I went to Boulogne to meet him. His boat was to arrive at 6.15 p.m., but did not get in till just 10 p.m. They had been away down the Channel avoiding something. Driving back to Cassel we had a fine sight of bombing and searchlights. Hardly a night passed at this period that the Boche did not have a \"go\" at St. Omer. One night, just then, they dropped three torpedoes in Cassel as we were having dinner, but Suzanne, the \"Peach,\" at her desk, never fluttered an eyelid. I believe afterwards, during the summer of 1918, when things were quite nasty at Cassel, she never showed any signs of being nervous: just sat at her desk, made out the bills, and occasionally made some lad happy by a look and a smile.  On some evenings we used to give great entertainments in the kitchen of the \"Sauvage.\" I would stand the drinks, and Howlett (my chauffeur) played the mouth-organ, and Green (my batman) step-danced. It was an  (p. 058) amusing sight watching the expressions of those old, fat Flemish workwomen of the hotel.  The itching got worse, so one wet, black evening I went to see the M.O., took off my clothes in a dirty, cold, dark room, and he examined me carefully with the aid of an oil lamp. \"You've got lice,\" he said. \"Really?\" said I. \"Have you got a servant?\" \"Yes,\" said I. \"Well, go back and give him Hell, and tell him to examine your clothes.\" I asked him about my foot, which had a hole in it about the size of a sixpence. \"That's nothing,\" said he. \"Keep it clean.\" So back I went, down the black cobbled street, called up my faithful boys, Howlett and Green, and told them I was lousy. I took my clothes off, and they examined them with electric torches and candles and oil lamps. Not a thing could they find. \"Do you mind my looking at you, sir?\" said Howlett. So he had one look. Said he, \"If it were lice got you into that state, you'd be crawling with them.\"  I stood the pain and itching another couple of days, and sent for the M.O. to come to me. As there was more light in my room, he came and had a look. \"Ah!\" said he, \"I thought last time it might have been that: you've got scabies. You must leave here for X---- in the morning, and have all your bed-clothes sent round to me before you leave.\"  [Illustration: XXIV. _The Receiving-room: 42nd Stationary Hospital._]  In the morning I broke the news gently to Madame that I was a \"dirty dog,\" and that my bed must go for a bit to be purged, and went round to the A.P.M. to say good-bye. When I told him where I was being sent, he said, \"That place! Don't you do it. I was waiting there the other day to see someone, and I counted ten bugs on the wall.\" That put the wind up me, so I wrote to the M.O. and said I had an important        (p. 059) meeting at Amiens that evening at 6 p.m., and that I would report at the X---- hospital immediately after that. He seemed rather hurt at my getting out of his reach, but he let me go (as I mentioned having to see the C.-in-C. on the way. It was wonderful what the mention of the C.-in-C. did for one!). He gave me my slip for the hospital:       \"Herewith Major Orpen, suffering from scabies. Please....\"  and with this I departed for Amiens, where I reported to the Colonel of the X---- Hospital. Over a whisky-and-soda I gave him the \"slip,\" and he looked at my arm and said, \"Yes, scabies,\" and I was put into the isolation ward and treated for this disease. How more people did not die in that hospital beats me. I personally never got any sleep, and left in a fortnight nearly dead. Lights were out at 10 p.m. This sounds good, but there were about eight of us in the ward. I had to have my foot treated every three hours. The man in the next bed to mine was treated for something every two hours; and nearly all the other beds were treated three or four times during the night. For all these treatments the lights blazed about twenty times each night, and some of the treatments were very noisy. At 6.30 a.m., in the dark, the nurse came round, and anyone who was not dying was turned out of bed. Why, I know not: there was no heat in the place. If you were well enough you went off to a soaking sort of scullery and heated some water over a gas-jet and shaved. If you were not well enough, you sat in your dressing-gown on a chair. You were not allowed to sit on your bed. At 8 a.m. you were given an extraordinarily bad breakfast--porridge with no milk, tea with no sugar, bread with--most days--no butter.    (p. 060) After breakfast you could go to bed again, but this was not allowed if you were going to be let out during the day, as I was most of the time. So there you sat again, freezing, till an orderly came and said your bath was ready, usually about 9.30 a.m.--three hours after you had left your bed. The bath was in an outhouse about fifty yards across the yard from the ward. In hail, rain or snow, you had got to go there. In it I was boiled in a bath, scrubbed all over with a nail-brush, and then smothered all over with sulphur--wet, greasy, stinking sulphur rubbed in all over me. I dressed by putting on a pair of pyjamas first. These more or less kept this grease from getting through to my other clothes, and I was allowed out to work--a sick, freezing, wet individual. But my room at the \"Hôtel de la Paix\" was warm, and I sat over my \"Flamme Bleue\" all the morning. After I had been treated with sulphur for \"scabies\" a couple of weeks, a hole came in my throat just like the one I had on my foot--a white hole with a black band round it, and all the flesh for about six inches beyond it a deep scarlet. One morning the boy who washed me said: \"I beg your pardon, sir, but what are you being treated for?\" \"Scabies,\" said I. Said he: \"Don't say I said so, sir, but show the M.O. that thing on your neck. You haven't got scabies, and this sulphur will kill you soon.\" So I waited for the M.O. till he did his rounds. When he came to me he said the usual, \"Everything all right with you?\" \"No,\" said I. \"I've got a scabie on my neck that is worrying me.\" So he had a look at it and said: \"I don't think this treatment is doing you much good. I shall get you dismissed from the hospital to-day.\" So I was chucked out. I happened to have blood-poisoning, not scabies, and I   (p. 061) have it still. During the time I was in hospital, I got four very amusing poems from a General at G.H.Q. They were the bright spots during those days. I am sorry they are too personal to print.  [Illustration: XXV. _A Death among the Wounded in the Snow._]  About this time an officer told me a good story about my friend, Carroll Carstairs. The Cambrai battle was on, and the Grenadier Guards were advancing through a village. Carroll was with a brother officer, and said suddenly, \"Look at the shape of that church now! Isn't it magnificent?\" Another shell shrieked and hit the structure, and he said, \"Damn! the fools have spoilt it.\" I believe it was during this battle he earned the M.C.
