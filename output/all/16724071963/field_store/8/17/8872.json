We shall find that the cells may become very much modified for various purposes, but at first they are almost identical in structure, and essentially the same as the one we have just considered.  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Hairs from the leaf stalk of a wild geranium. _A_, single-celled hair. _B_ and _C_, hairs consisting of a row of cells. The terminal rounded cell secretes a peculiar scented oil that gives the plant its characteristic odor. _B_, × 50; _C_, × 150.]  Very many of the lower forms of life consist of but a single cell which may occasionally be destitute of a cell wall. Such a form is shown in Figure 2. Here we have a mass of protoplasm with a nucleus (_n_) and cavities (vacuoles, _v_) filled with cell sap, but no cell wall. The protoplasm is in constant movement, and by extensions of a portion of the mass and contraction of other parts, the whole creeps slowly along. Other naked cells (Fig. 12, _B_; Fig. 16, _C_) are provided with delicate thread-like processes of protoplasm called \"cilia\" (sing. _cilium_), which are in active vibration, and propel the cell through the water.  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--_A_, cross section. _B_, longitudinal section of the leaf stalk of wild geranium, showing its cellular structure. _Ep._ epidermis. _h_, a hair, × 50. _C_, a cell from the prothallium (young plant) of a fern, × _150_.

The cell wall shows the same thing though in a less   degree, owing to its being much more rigid than the protoplasmic   lining. It is owing to the partial collapsing of the cells,   consequent on loss of water, that plants wither when the supply of   water is cut off.  As cells grow, new ones are formed in various ways. If the new cells remain together, cell aggregates, called tissues, are produced, and of these tissues are built up the various organs of the higher plants. The simplest tissues are rows of cells, such as form the hairs covering the surface of the organs of many flowering plants (Fig. 3), and are due to a division of the cells in a single direction. If the divisions take place in three planes, masses of cells, such as make up the stems, etc., of the higher plants, result (Fig. 4, _A_, _B_).     CHAPTER III.  CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS.--PROTOPHYTES.   For the sake of convenience it is desirable to collect into groups such plants as are evidently related; but as our knowledge of many forms is still very imperfect, any classification we may adopt must be to a great extent only provisional, and subject to change at any time, as new forms are discovered or others become better understood.  The following general divisions are usually accepted: I. Sub-kingdom (or Branch); II. Class; III. Order; IV. Family; V. Genus; VI. Species.  To illustrate: The white pine belongs to the highest great division (sub-kingdom) of the plant kingdom. The plants of this division all produce seeds, and hence are called \"spermaphytes\" (\"seed plants\"). They may be divided into two groups (classes), distinguished by certain peculiarities in the flowers and seeds. These are named respectively \"gymnosperms\" and \"angiosperms,\" and to the first our plant belongs. The gymnosperms may be further divided into several subordinate groups (orders), one of which, the conifers, or cone-bearing evergreens, includes our plant. This order includes several families, among them the fir family (_Abietineæ_), including the pines and firs. Of the sub-divisions (_genera_, sing. _genus_) of the fir family, one of the most familiar is the genus _Pinus_, which embraces all the true pines. Comparing different kinds of pines, we find that they differ in the form of the cones, arrangement of the leaves, and other minor particulars. The form we have selected differs from all other native forms in its cones, and also in having the leaves in fives, instead of twos or threes, as in most other kinds. Therefore to distinguish the white pine from all other pines, it is given a \"specific\" name, _strobus_.  The following table will show more plainly what is meant:                            Sub-kingdom,                         _Spermaphyta_.          /--------------------^---------------------\\           Includes all spermaphytes, or seed plants.

The name Protophytes (_Protophyta_) has been applied to a large number of simple plants, which differ a good deal among themselves. Some of them differ strikingly from the higher plants, and resemble so remarkably certain low forms of animal life as to be quite indistinguishable from them, at least in certain stages. Indeed, there are certain forms that are quite as much animal as vegetable in their attributes, and must be regarded as connecting the two kingdoms. Such forms are the slime moulds (Fig. 5), _Euglena_ (Fig. 9), _Volvox_ (Fig. 10), and others.  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--_A_, a portion of a slime mould growing on a bit of rotten wood, × 3. _B_, outline of a part of the same, × 25. _C_, a small portion showing the densely granular character of the protoplasm, × 150. _D_, a group of spore cases of a slime mould (_Trichia_), of about the natural size. _E_, two spore cases, × 5.

The protophytes may be divided into three classes: I. The slime moulds (_Myxomycetes_); II. The Schizophytes; III. The green monads (_Volvocineæ_).   CLASS I.--THE SLIME MOULDS.  These curious organisms are among the most puzzling forms with which the botanist has to do, as they are so much like some of the lowest forms of animal life as to be scarcely distinguishable from them, and indeed they are sometimes regarded as animals rather than plants. At certain stages they consist of naked masses of protoplasm of very considerable size, not infrequently several centimetres in diameter. These are met with on decaying logs in damp woods, on rotting leaves, and other decaying vegetable matter. The commonest ones are bright yellow or whitish, and form soft, slimy coverings over the substratum (Fig. 5, _A_), penetrating into its crevices and showing sensitiveness toward light. The plasmodium, as the mass of protoplasm is called, may be made to creep upon a slide in the following way: A tumbler is filled with water and placed in a saucer filled with sand. A strip of blotting paper about the width of the slide is now placed with one end in the water, the other hanging over the edge of the glass and against one side of a slide, which is thus held upright, but must not be allowed to touch the side of the tumbler. The strip of blotting paper sucks up the water, which flows slowly down the surface of the slide in contact with the blotting paper. If now a bit of the substance upon which the plasmodium is growing is placed against the bottom of the slide on the side where the stream of water is, the protoplasm will creep up against the current of water and spread over the slide, forming delicate threads in which most active streaming movements of the central granular protoplasm may be seen under the microscope, and the ends of the branches may be seen to push forward much as we saw in the amœba. In order that the experiment may be successful, the whole apparatus should be carefully protected from the light, and allowed to stand for several hours. This power of movement, as well as the power to take in solid food, are eminently animal characteristics, though the former is common to many plants as well.  After a longer or shorter time the mass of protoplasm contracts and gathers into little heaps, each of which develops into a structure that has no resemblance to any animal, but would be at once placed with plants. In one common form (_Trichia_) these are round or pear-shaped bodies of a yellow color, and about as big as a pin head (Fig. 5, _D_), occurring in groups on rotten logs in damp woods. Others are stalked (_Arcyria_, _Stemonitis_) (Fig. 5, _J_, _K_), and of various colors,--red, brown, etc. The outer part of the structure is a more or less firm wall, which breaks when ripe, discharging a powdery mass, mixed in most forms with very fine fibres.    When strongly magnified the fine dust is found to be made up of   innumerable small cells with thick walls, marked with ridges or   processes which differ much in different species. The fibres also   differ"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20390"],["title","Elements of Structural and Systematic Botany (#3)"],["body","in different genera. Sometimes they are simple,   hair-like threads; in others they are hollow tubes with spiral   thickenings, often very regularly placed, running around their   walls.    The spores may sometimes be made to germinate by placing them in a   drop of water, and allowing them to remain in a warm place for about   twenty-four hours. If the experiment has been successful, at the end   of this time the spore membrane will have burst, and the contents   escaped in the form of a naked mass of protoplasm (Zoöspore) with a   nucleus, and often showing a vacuole (Fig. 5, _v_), that   alternately becomes much distended, and then disappears entirely. On   first escaping it is usually provided with a long, whip-like   filament of protoplasm, which is in active movement, and by means of   which the cell swims actively through the water (Fig. 5, _I_ i).   Sometimes such a cell will be seen to divide into two, the process   taking but a short time, so that the numbers of these cells under   favorable conditions may become very large. After a time the lash is   withdrawn, and the cell assumes much the form of a small amœba (_I_   ii).  The succeeding stages are difficult to follow. After repeatedly dividing, a large number of these amœba-like cells run together, coalescing when they come in contact, and forming a mass of protoplasm that grows, and finally assumes the form from which it started.    Of the common forms of slime moulds the species of _Trichia_ (Figs.   _D_, _I_) and _Physarum_ are, perhaps, the best for studying the   germination, as the spores are larger than in most other forms, and   germinate more readily. The experiment is apt to be most successful   if the spores are sown in a drop of water in which has been infused   some vegetable matter, such as a bit of rotten wood, boiling   thoroughly to kill all germs. A drop of this fluid should be placed   on a perfectly clean cover glass, which it is well to pass once or   twice through a flame, and the spores transferred to this drop with   a needle previously heated. By these precautions foreign germs will   be avoided, which otherwise may interfere seriously with the growth   of the young slime moulds. After sowing the spores in the drop of   culture fluid, the whole should be inverted over a so-called \"moist   chamber.\" This is simply a square of thick blotting paper, in which   an opening is cut small enough to be entirely covered by the cover   glass, but large enough so that the drop in the centre of the cover   glass will not touch the sides of the chamber, but will hang   suspended clear in it. The blotting paper should be soaked   thoroughly in pure water (distilled water is preferable), and then   placed on a slide, covering carefully with the cover glass with the   suspended drop of fluid containing the spores. The whole should be   kept under cover so as to prevent loss of water by evaporation. By   this method the spores may be examined conveniently without   disturbing them, and the whole may be kept as long as desired, so   long as the blotting paper is kept wet, so as to prevent the   suspended drop from drying up.   CLASS II.--_Schizophytes_.  The Schizophytes are very small plants, though not infrequently occurring in masses of considerable size. They are among the commonest of all plants, and are found everywhere. They multiply almost entirely by simple transverse division, or splitting of the cells, whence their name. There are two pretty well-marked orders,--the blue-green slimes (_Cyanophyceæ_) and the bacteria (_Schizomycetes_). They are distinguished, primarily, by the first (with a very few exceptions) containing chlorophyll (leaf-green), which is entirely absent from nearly all of the latter.  The blue-green slimes: These are, with few exceptions, green plants of simple structure, but possessing, in addition to the ordinary green pigment (chlorophyll, or leaf-green), another coloring matter, soluble in water, and usually blue in color, though sometimes yellowish or red.  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Blue-green slime (_Oscillaria_). _A_, mass of filaments of the natural size. _B_, single filament, × 300. _C_, a piece of a filament that has become separated. _s_, sheath, × 300.]  As a representative of the group, we will select one of the commonest forms (_Oscillaria_), known sometimes as green slime, from forming a dark blue-green or blackish slimy coat over the mud at the bottom of stagnant or sluggish water, in watering troughs, on damp rocks, or even on moist earth. A search in the places mentioned can hardly fail to secure plenty of specimens for study. If a bit of the slimy mass is transferred to a china dish, or placed with considerable water on a piece of stiff paper, after a short time the edge of the mass will show numerous extremely fine filaments of a dark blue-green color, radiating in all directions from the mass (Fig. 6, _a_). The filaments are the individual plants, and possess considerable power of motion, as is shown by letting the mass remain undisturbed for a day or two, at the end of which time they will have formed a thin film over the surface of the vessel in which they are kept; and the radiating arrangement of the filaments can then be plainly seen.  If the mass is allowed to dry on the paper, it often leaves a bright blue stain, due to the blue pigment in the cells of the filament. This blue color can also be extracted by pulverizing a quantity of the dried plants, and pouring water over them, the water soon becoming tinged with a decided blue. If now the water containing the blue pigment is filtered, and the residue treated with alcohol, the latter will extract the chlorophyll, becoming colored of a yellow-green.    The microscope shows that the filaments of which the mass is   composed (Fig. 6, _B_) are single rows of short cylindrical cells of   uniform diameter, except at the end of the filament, where they   usually become somewhat smaller, so that the tip is more or less   distinctly pointed. The protoplasm of the cells has a few small   granules scattered through it, and is colored uniformly of a pale   blue-green. No nucleus can be seen.    If the filament is broken, there may generally be detected a   delicate, colorless sheath that surrounds it, and extends beyond the   end cells (Fig. 6, _c_). The filament increases in length by the   individual cells undergoing division, this always taking place at   right angles to the axis of the filament. New filaments are produced   simply by the older ones breaking into a number of pieces, each of   which rapidly grows to full size.  The name \"oscillaria\" arises from the peculiar oscillating or swinging movements that the plant exhibits. The most marked movement is a swaying from side to side, combined with a rotary motion of the free ends of the filaments, which are often twisted together like the strands of a rope. If the filaments are entirely free, they may often be observed to move forward with a slow, creeping movement. Just how these movements are caused is still a matter of controversy.  The lowest of the _Cyanophyceæ_ are strictly single-celled, separating as soon as formed, but cohering usually in masses or colonies by means of a thick mucilaginous substance that surrounds them (Fig. 7, _D_).  The higher ones are filaments, in which there may be considerable differentiation. These often occur in masses of considerable size, forming jelly-like lumps, which may be soft or quite firm (Fig. 7, _A_, _B_). They are sometimes found on damp ground, but more commonly attached to plants, stones, etc., in water. The masses vary in color from light brown to deep blackish green, and in size from that of a pin head to several centimetres in diameter.  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Forms of _Cyanophyceæ_. _A_, _Nostoc_. _B_, _Glœotrichia_, × 1. _C_, individual of _Glœotrichia_. _D_, Chroöcoccus. _E_, _Nostoc_. _F_, Oscillaria. _G_, _H_, _Tolypothrix_. All × 300. _y_, heterocyst. _sp._ spore.]  In the higher forms special cells called heterocysts are found. They are colorless, or light yellowish, regularly disposed; but their function is not known. Besides these, certain cells become thick-walled, and form resting cells (spores) for the propagation of the plant (Fig. 7, C. _sp._). In species where the sheath of the filament is well marked (Fig. 7, _H_), groups of cells slip out of the sheath, and develop a new one, thus giving rise to a new plant.  The bacteria (_Schizomycetes_), although among the commonest of organisms, owing to their excessive minuteness, are difficult to study, especially for the beginner. They resemble, in their general structure and methods of reproduction, the blue-green slimes, but are, with very few exceptions, destitute of chlorophyll, although often possessing bright pigments,--blue, violet, red, etc. It is one of these that sometimes forms blood-red spots in flour paste or bits of bread that have been kept very moist and warm. They are universally present where decomposition is going on, and are themselves the principal agents of decay, which is the result of their feeding upon the substance, as, like all plants without chlorophyll, they require organic matter for food. Most of the species are very tenacious of life, and may be completely dried up for a long time without dying, and on being placed in water will quickly revive. Being so extremely small, they are readily carried about in the air in their dried-up condition, and thus fall upon exposed bodies, setting up decomposition if the conditions are favorable.  A simple experiment to show this may be performed by taking two test tubes and partly filling them with an infusion of almost any organic substance (dried leaves or hay, or a bit of meat will answer). The fluid should now be boiled so as to kill any germs that may be in it; and while hot, one of the vessels should be securely stopped up with a plug of cotton wool, and the other left open.
