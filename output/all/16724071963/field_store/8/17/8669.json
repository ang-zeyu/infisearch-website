Rip had plotted orbits before, but never one for actual use. His palms were wet as he laid it out, using prepared tables. When he had finished he pointed to a spaceman. \"That’s it. Will you translate it into analogue figures for the computer, please?\" He assigned to others the task of figuring out the effect Mercury, the sun, and earth would have on the orbit, using an assumed speed for the asteroid.  To the chief analyst he gave the job of putting all the data together in proper form for feeding to the electronic brain.  It would have taken all spacemen present about ten days to complete the job by regular methods, but the electronic computer produced the answer in three minutes.  \"Thanks a million, Chief,\" Rip said. \"I’ll be calling on you again before this is over.\" He tucked the sheets into his pocket.  \"Any time, Lieutenant. We’ll keep rechecking the figures as we go along. If there are any corrections, we’ll send them to you. That will give you a check on your own figures.\"  \"Don’t worry,\" Rip assured him. \"We’ll have plenty of corrections.\"  Deceleration had been dropping steadily. It ceased altogether, leaving them weightless. O’Brine’s voice came over the speaker. \"Get it! Valve crews take stations at landing boats five and six. The Planeteers will depart in five minutes. Lieutenant Foster will report to central control if he cannot be ready in that time.\"  Santos grinned at Rip. \"Here we go, Lieutenant.\"  Rip’s heart would have dropped into his shoes if there had been any gravity. Only a little excitement showed on his face, though. He waved his thanks at the analysts and grinned back at Santos.  \"Show an exhaust, Corporal. High vack is waiting!\"      CHAPTER SIX - RIP’S PERSONAL PLANET   Rip rechecked his space suit before putting on his helmet. The air seal was intact and his heating and ventilating units worked. He slapped his knee pouches to make sure the space knife was handy to his left hand and the pistol to his right.  Koa was already fully dressed. He handed Rip the shoulder case that contained the plotting board. Santos had taken charge of Rip’s astrogation instruments.  A spaceman was waiting with Rip’s bubble. At a nod, the spaceman slipped it on his head. Rip reached up and gave it a quarter turn. The locking mechanism clamped into place. He turned his belt ventilator control on full and the space suit puffed out. When it was fully inflated he watched the pressure gauge. It was steady. No leaks in suit or helmet. He let the pressure go down to normal.  Koa’s voice buzzed in his ears. \"Hear me, sir?\"  Rip turned the volume of his communicator down a little and spoke in a normal voice. \"I hear you. Am I clear?\"  \"Yessir. All men dressed and ready.\"  Rip made a final check. He counted his men, then personally inspected their suits. The boats were next. They were typical landing craft, shaped like rectangular boxes. There was no need for streamlining in the vacuum of space. They were not pressurized. Only men in space suits rode in the ungainly boxes.  He checked all blast tubes to make sure they were clear. There were small single tubes on each side of the craft. A clogged one could explode and blow the boat up.  Koa, he knew, had checked everything, but the final responsibility was his. In space, no officer or sergeant took anyone’s word for anything that might mean lives. Each checked every detail personally.  Rip looked around and saw the Planeteers watching him. There was approval on the faces behind the clear helmets, and he knew they were satisfied with his thoroughness.  At last, certain that everything was in good order, he said quietly, \"Pilots, man your boats.\"  Dowst got into one and a spaceman into the other. Dowst’s boat would stay with them on the asteroid. The spaceman would bring the other to the ship.  Commander O’Brine stepped through the valve into the boat lock. A spaceman handed him a hand communicator. He spoke into it. Rip couldn’t have heard him through the helmet otherwise. \"All set, Foster?\"  \"Ready, sir.\"  \"Good. The long-range screen picked up a blip a few minutes ago. It’s probably that Connie cruiser.\"  Rip swallowed. The Planeteers froze, waiting for the commander’s next words.  \"Our screens are a little better than theirs, so there’s a slim chance they haven’t picked us up yet. We’ll drop you and get out of here. But don’t worry. We have your orbit fixed and we’ll find you when the screens are clear.\"  \"Suppose they find us while you’re gone?\" Rip asked.  \"It’s a chance,\" O’Brine admitted. \"You’ll have to take spaceman’s luck on that one. But we won’t be far away. We’ll duck behind Vesta or another of the big asteroids and hide so their screens won’t pick up our motion. Every now and then we’ll sneak out for a look, if the screen seems clear. If those high-vack vermin do find you, get on the landing boat radio and yell for help. We’ll come blasting.\"  He waved a hand, thumb and forefinger held together in the ancient symbol for \"everything right,\" then ordered, \"Get flaming.\" He stepped through the valve.  \"Clear the lock,\" Rip ordered. \"Open outer valve when ready.\"                    [Illustration: \"Get Flaming, Foster!\"]                            \"Get Flaming, Foster!\"   He took a quick final look around. The pilots were in the boats. His Planeteers were standing by, safety lines already attached to the boats and their belts. He moved into position and snapped his own line to a ring on Dowst’s boat. The spacemen vanished through the valve and the massive door slid closed. The overhead lights flicked out. Rip snapped on his belt light and the others followed suit.  In front of the boxlike landing boats a great door slid open and air from the lock rushed out. Rip knew it was only imagination, but he felt for a moment as though the bitter cold of space, near absolute zero, had penetrated his suit. Beyond the lights from their belts he saw stars, and recognized the constellation for which the space cruiser was named. A superstitious spaceman would have taken that as a good sign. Rip admitted that it was nice to see.  \"Float ’em,\" he ordered.  The Planeteers gripped handholds at the entrance with one hand and launching rails on the boats with the other and heaved. The boats slid into space. As the safety lines tightened, the Planeteers were pulled after the boat.  Rip left his feet with a little spring and shot through the door. Directly below him the asteroid gleamed darkly in the light of the tiny sun. His first reaction was, \"Great Cosmos! What a little chunk of rock!\" But that was because he was used to looking from the space platform at the great curve of Terra or at the big ball of the moon. Actually the asteroid was fair-sized when compared with most of its kind.  The Planeteers hauled themselves into the boats by their safety lines. Rip waited until all were in, then pulled himself along his own line to the black square o£ the door. Koa was waiting to give him a hand into the craft.  The Planeteers were standing, except for Dowst. Rip had never seen an old-type railroad or he might have likened the landing boat to a railroad box car. It was about the same size and shape, but it had huge \"windows\" on both sides and in front of the pilot—windows that were not enclosed. The space-suited men needed no protection.  \"Blast,\" Rip ordered.  A pulse of fire spurted from the top of each boat, driving them bottom-first toward the asteroid.  \"Land at will,\" Rip said.  The asteroid loomed large as he looked through an opening. It was rocky, but there were plenty of smooth places.  Dowst picked one. He was an expert pilot and Rip watched him with pleasure. The exhaust from the top lessened and fire spurted soundlessly from the bottom. Dowst balanced the opposite thrusts of the top and bottom blasts with the delicacy of a man threading a needle. In a few moments the boat was hovering a foot above the asteroid. Dowst cut the exhausts and Rip stepped out onto the tiny planet.  The Planeteers knew what to do. Corporal Pederson produced hardened steel spikes with ring tops. Private Trudeau had a sledge. Driving the first spike would be the hardest, because the action of swinging the hammer would propel the Planeteer like a rocket exhaust. In space, the law that every action has an equal and opposite reaction had to be remembered every moment.  Rip watched, interested in how his men would tackle the problem. He didn’t know the answer himself, because he had never driven a spike on an airless, almost gravityless world and no one had ever mentioned it to him.  Pederson searched the gray metal with his torch and found a slender spur of thorium perhaps two feet high a short distance from the boat. \"Here’s a hold,\" he said. \"Come on, Frenchy. You, too, Bradshaw.\"  Trudeau, carrying the sledge, walked up to the spur of rock and stood with his heels against it. Pederson sat down on the ground with the spur between his legs. He stretched, hooking his heels around Trudeau’s ankles, anchoring him. With his gloves he grabbed the seat of the Frenchman’s space suit.  Bradshaw took a spike and held it against the gray metal ground. The Frenchman swung, his hammer noiseless as it drove the tough spike in. A few inches into the metal was enough. Bradshaw took a wrench from his belt, put it on the head of the spike and turned it. Below the surface, teeth on the spike bit into the metal. It would hold.  The rest was easy. The spike was used to anchor Trudeau while he drove another, at his longest reach. Then the second spike became his anchor, and so on, until enough spikes had been set to lace the boat down against any sudden shock.  The boat piloted by the spaceman was tied to the one that would remain and the Planeteers floated its supplies through a window. It took only a few moments, with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20154"],["title","Invaders from the Infinite (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team (http://www.pgdp.net/c/)    INVADERS FROM THE INFINITE  by  JOHN W.

GALAXIES IN THE BALANCE  The famous scientific trio of Arcot, Wade and Morey, challenged by the most ruthless aliens in all the universes, blasted off on an intergalactic search for defenses against the invaders of Earth and all her allies.  World after world was visited, secret after secret unleashed, and turned to mighty weapons of intense force--and still the Thessian enemy seemed to grow in power and ferocity.  Mighty battles between huge space armadas were but skirmishes in the galactic war, as the invincible aliens savagely advanced and the Earth team hurled bolt after bolt of pure ravening energy--until it appeared that the universe itself might end in one final flare of furious torrential power....     Chapter I  INVADERS   Russ Evans, Pilot 3497, Rocket Squad Patrol 34, unsnapped his seat belt, and with a slight push floated \"up\" into the air inside the weightless ship. He stretched himself, and yawned broadly.  \"Red, how soon do we eat?\" he called.  \"Shut up, you'll wake the others,\" replied a low voice from the rear of the swift little patrol ship. \"See anything?\"  \"Several million stars,\" replied Evans in a lower voice. \"And--\" His tone became suddenly severe. \"Assistant Murphy, remember your manners when addressing your superior officer. I've a mind to report you.\"  A flaming head of hair topping a grinning face poked around the edge of the door. \"Lower your wavelength, lower your wavelength! You may think you're a sun, but you're just a planetoid. But what I'd like to know, Chief Pilot Russ Evans, is why they locate a ship in a forlorn, out of the way place like this--three-quarters of a billion miles, out of planetary plane. No ships ever come out here, no pirates, not a chance to help a wrecked ship. All we can do is sit here and watch the other fellows do the work.\"  \"Which is exactly why we're here. Watch--and tell the other ships where to go, and when. Is that chow ready?\" asked Russ looking at a small clock giving New York time.  \"Uh--think she'll be on time? Come on an' eat.\"  Evans took one more look at the telectroscope screen, then snapped it off. A tiny, molecular towing unit in his hand, he pointed toward the door to the combined galley and lunch room, and glided in the wake of Murphy.  \"How much fuel left?\" he asked, as he glided into the dizzily spinning room. A cylindrical room, spinning at high speed, causing an artificial \"weight\" for the foods and materials in it, made eating of food a less difficult task. Expertly, he maneuvered himself to the guide rail near the center of the room, and caught the spiral. Braking himself into motion, he soon glided down its length, and landed on his feet. He bent and flexed his muscles, waiting for the now-busied assistant to get to the floor and reply.  \"They gave us two pounds extra. Lord only knows why. Must expect us to clean up on some fleet. That makes four pound rolls left, untouched, and two thirds of the original pound. We've been here fifteen days, and have six more to go. The main driving power rolls have about the same amount left, and three pound rolls in each reserve bin,\" replied Red, holding a curiously moving coffee pot that strove to adjust itself to rapidly changing air velocities as it neared the center of the room.  \"Sounds like a fleet's power stock. Martian lead or the terrestrial isotope?\" asked Evans, tasting warily a peculiar dish before him. \"Say, this is energy food. I thought we didn't get any more till Saturday.\" The change from the energy-less, flavored pastes that made up the principal bulk of a space-pilot's diet, to prevent over-eating, when no energy was used in walking in the weightless ship, was indeed a welcome change.  \"Uh-huh. I got hungry. Any objections?\" grinned the Irishman.  \"None!\" replied Evans fervently, pitching in with a will.  Seated at the controls once more, he snapped the little switch that caused the screen to glow with flashing, swirling colors as the telectroscope apparatus came to life. A thousand tiny points of flame appeared scattered on a black field with a suddenness that made them seem to snap suddenly into being. Points, tiny dimensionless points of light, save one, a tiny disc of blue-white flame, old Sol from a distance of close to one billion miles, and under slight reverse magnification. The skillful hands at the controls were turning adjustments now, and that disc of flame seemed to leap toward him with a hundred light-speeds, growing to a disc as large as a dime in an instant, while the myriad points of the stars seemed to scatter like frightened chickens, fleeing from the growing sun, out of the screen. Other points, heretofore invisible, appeared, grew, and rushed away.  The sun shifted from the center of the screen, and a smaller reddish-green disc came into view--a planet, its atmosphere coloring the light that left it toward the red. It rushed nearer, grew larger. Earth spread as it took the center of the screen. A world, a portion of a world, a continent, a fragment of a continent as the magnification increased, boundlessly it seemed.  Finally, New York spread across the screen; New York seen from the air, with a strange lack of perspective. The buildings did not seem all to slant toward some point, but to stand vertical, for, from a distance of a billion miles, the vision lines were practically parallel. Titanic shafts of glowing color in the early summer sun appeared; the hot rays from the sun, now only 82,500,000 miles away, shimmering on the colored metal walls.  The new Airlines Building, a mile and a half high, supported at various points by actual spaceship driving units, was a riot of shifting, rainbow hues. A new trick in construction had been used here, and Evans smiled at it. Arcot, inventor of the ship that carried him, had suggested it to Fuller, designer of that ship, and of that building. The colored berylium metal of the wall had been ruled with 20,000 lines to the inch, mere scratches, but nevertheless a diffraction grating. The result was amazingly beautiful. The sunlight, split up to its rainbow colors, was reflected in millions of shifting tints.  In the air, supported by tiny packs strapped to their backs, thousands of people were moving, floating where they wished, in any direction, at any elevation. There were none of the helicopters of even five years ago, now. A molecular power suit was far more convenient, cost nothing to operate, and but $50 to buy. Perfectly safe, requiring no skill, everyone owned them. To the watcher in space, they were mere moving, snaky lines of barely distinguishable dots that shivered and seemed to writhe in the refractions of the air. Passing over them, seeming to pass almost through them in this strange perspectiveless view, were the shadowy forms of giant space liners, titanic streamlined hulls. They were streamlined for no good reason, save that they looked faster and more graceful than the more efficient spherical freighters, just as passenger liners of two centuries earlier, with their steam engines, had carried four funnels and used two. A space liner spent so minute a portion of its journey in the atmosphere that it was really inefficient to streamline them.  \"Won't be long!\" muttered Russ, grinning cheerily at the familiar, sunlit city. His eyes darted to the chronometer beside him. The view seemed to be taken from a ship that was suddenly scudding across the heavens like a frightened thing, as it ran across from Manhattan Island, followed the Hudson for a short way, then cut across into New Jersey, swinging over the great woodland area of Kittatiny Park, resting finally on the New Jersey suburb of New York nestled in the Kittatinies, Blairtown. Low apartment buildings, ten or twelve stories high, nestled in the waving green of trees in the old roadways. When ground traffic ceased, the streets had been torn up, and parkways substituted.  Quickly the view singled out a single apartment, and the great smooth roof was enlarged on the screen to the absolute maximum clarity, till further magnification simply resulted in worse stratospheric distortion. On the broad roof were white strips of some material, making a huge V followed by two I's. Russ watched, his hand on the control steadying the view under the Earth's complicated orbital motion, and rotation, further corrections for the ship's orbital motion making the job one requiring great skill. The view held the center with amazing clarity. Something seemed to be happening to the last of the I's. It crumpled suddenly, rolled in on itself and disappeared.  \"She's there, and on time,\" grinned Russ happily.  He tried more magnification. Could he--  He was tired, terribly, suddenly tired. He took his hands from the viewplate controls, relaxed, and dropped off to sleep.  \"What made me so tired--wonder--GOD!\" He straightened with a jerk, and his hands flew to the controls. The view on the machine suddenly retreated, flew back with a velocity inconceivable. Earth dropped away from the ship with an apparent velocity a thousand times that of light; it was a tiny ball, a pinpoint, gone, the sun--a minute disc--gone--then the apparatus was flashing views into focus from the other side of the ship. The assistant did not reply. Evans' hands were growing ineffably heavy, his whole body yearned for sleep. Slowly, clumsily he pawed for a little stud. Somehow his hand found it, and the ship reeled suddenly, little jerks, as the code message was flung out in a beam of such tremendous power that the sheer radiation pressure made it noticeable. Earth would be notified. The system would be"]]]
