Yes, and had not the word passed from the guard at the praetorian gate, how a tribune and five turmae of the fourth legion had ridden out on the service of the dictator?  Earlier in the night, those who listened closely had heard a low hum that seemed to pervade the air, rising and falling like the dull glow in the west that told of the fluctuant watch-fires of the hostile camp. Now the noises had died away, as in the distance, and the light that had flashed up a few hours since hardly tinted the clouds.  It is only the old soldier who can read the signs of a decamping foe, who knows how the fagots must be heaped at the moment of departure, so that the deserted fires may burn until the morning, whose quick ear catches and recognizes the indefinite noises of a host moving in secret.  All these things were, and old campaigners among the legionaries at the gate had read them aright.  Messenger after messenger hurried to the praetorium, and returned with word that the dictator slept, \"having taken all needed measures,\" and how the master-of-the-horse paced up and down before his tent, grinding his teeth, clenching his hands, and muttering curses upon patrician cowardice and imbecility.  Meanwhile, Lucius Sergius rode on through the night, with Marcus Decius at his side, and the troop of horse trailing out across the plain behind them.  \"It is silent, master,\" said the decurion, but his attitude, as he leaned forward over his horse's neck, was rather of one trying to smell than to listen.  \"The pulse-eaters sleep deeply.\"  He watched Sergius from under half-closed lids, waiting to be contradicted, that he might measure his officer's warcraft.  Sergius smiled.  \"Perhaps they are even wider awake than ourselves,\" he said, drawing rein.  Then, as the other nodded several times in satisfied acquiescence, he brought his horse to his haunches a stride beyond, and added: \"It was the dictator who said we should find their lair empty, and, though I do not question his judgment, it will be well to send on a few who shall spy out the fact, and see whether there be not Numidians lurking among the huts.\"  So, slowly and cautiously, they pushed forward again, with riders in advance, until a shout gave notice that the way was indeed clear, and they rode through the open gate of the rampart and along the silent street of the deserted camp.  Nothing was about them save dismantled huts, for the most part mere burrows with roofs of interlaced boughs that were now smoking amid the ashes of the fires.  Not a sign of disorder, nor even of the rapidity with which so great an army had been moved; not a scale of armour left behind--only the insufferable stench of a barbarian camp, of offal and refuse piled or scattered about, of dead beasts and of dead men--the sick and wounded who had yielded to sword or disease during the last few days.  It was with a sense of relief that the cavalcade emerged from the shadows of the huts and began to mount the rising ground beyond.  The moon, too, had grown faint, and the gray mists of the morning were lying along the lower levels.  Sounds, mingled and far ahead, told of the presence of a marching host, and Sergius led his troop on a more oblique course to gain the flank of the foe and lessen the chances of detection and ambuscade.  It was not stirring work for a soldier--the days that followed; never attacking, always guarding against discovery and surprise, viewing slaughter and devastation that duty and weakness alike made him powerless to prevent or punish, sending courier after courier to his general to tell of the enemies' march or of stragglers and foragers to be crushed in the jaws of the army that enveloped the invader's rear. Thus the war passed through Apulia, over the Apennines, down into the old Samnite lands, past Beneventum that closed its gates and mourned over its devastated fields, on across the Volturnus, descending at last into the Falernian plain, the glory of Campania, the Paradise of Italian wealth and luxury.  During all these days Sergius had grown thinner and browner.  Little furrows had been ploughed between the eyes that must pierce every ridge and thicket for the glint of javelins and the wild faces of the bridleless riders of the desert.  From time to time news of devastators cut to pieces brought a fierce joy to his heart; from time to time he dreamt he saw the eagles of the Republic hovering upon the heights above, ready to stoop and strike and save the allied lands from trials greater than they could bear; but of Marcia, scarce a waking thought. Surely the man he now was had never reclined in peaceful halls where women plied the distaff and talked about love, and of how Rabuleius, the perfume-maker of the Suburra, had just received a new essence from Arabia!  That old life was all a dream, perhaps the memory of a former existence, as the sage of Croton had taught.  There was nothing real in the world, in these days, but fear and suffering and humiliation and revenge.  Even duty had become a mere habit that should minister to greater influences.  And now it was worst of all.  Campania was a conflagration from which rose supplications and shrieks and groans, mingled with curses against the cowardly ally that had left her to her fate.  Still the legions held to the high ground, and still the black pest of Numidia swept hither and thither on its errand of murder and rapine.  Even to Sergius the plans of the dictator began to seem but \"coined lead,\" as Marcus Decius roughly put it.  Of what avail was it that the pass at Tarracina was blocked, that he had garrisoned Casilinum in the enemies' rear and Cales upon the Latin Way, and that the sea and the Volturnus and the steep hills with their guarded passes seemed to complete the line of circumvallation?  Could such bonds hold one so wise as Hannibal from the rich cities of the plain?  Unless Rome would advance her standards, were not Sinuessa and Cumae, Puteoli and Neapolis, Nuceria and Teanum, and, above all, Capua, left to fight their own battle against barbarian insolence and barbarian power?  What hope to starve out an enemy established in such a region and amid such affluence!  Then, too, there was less work now for Sergius, even such as it was. The enemy, wheresoever he marched, was well in view from a dozen points held by the dictator, and at last word came to the tribune that he should join the camp near Casilinum.  There, at least, he would have companionship in shame, instead of seeming to command men and being unwilling to lead them to fight for lands which the gods themselves had deemed worthy of their contention.  They were near Cales when the orders were brought.  Could it be the dictator's intention to give battle and avenge what he had failed to save?  By midday they were mounted and threading the forest paths that led to their comrades--paths whence, from time to time, some vista in the woods disclosed the plain below, with here and there a column of smoke that made Sergius grind his teeth and clench his hands in impotent rage.  Suddenly he drew rein, for a man, dressed in the coarse, gray tunic of a slave, had half run, half stumbled across his way.  An instant more, and the fellow was struggling in the grasp of Decius, who had sprung to the ground.  \"What now, forkbearer! what now, delight of the scourges!\" cried the decurion.  \"Will you delay the march of a tribune of the Republic?\"  \"Pity me, master, pity me and let me go!\" cried the man, still striving vainly to escape.  \"Surely they are close behind me--\"  \"Who are behind you?\" asked Sergius, sternly.  \"Speak and lie not, food for Acheron!\"  \"They who are burning the farm.\"  Sergius' eyes glittered, and he leaned forward to catch the words, as he began to gather their import.  \"Speak quickly, and you shall be safe,\" he said, in more reassuring tones.  \"Whose farm is it that is burning?  Loose him, Marcus.\"  Released from the hands that held him, the fugitive seemed to waver for a moment between speech and flight.  Perhaps exhaustion turned the balance, for, still panting for breath, he threw himself on his knees before Sergius' bridle and gasped:--  \"My master's farm--a veteran of the first war--a centurion--the Numidians.\"  \"Where is it?  How many are there?\"  The man pointed down the slope up which he had scrambled.  \"I did not note their numbers, lord.  Perhaps a hundred--perhaps more.\"  As he spoke, the sky began to brighten as with fire, and Sergius, wheeling his horse, urged him downward toward the plain.  Decius was by his side in an instant, and behind them came the cavalry at a speed that threatened to hurl them headlong to the foot of the rocky declivity.  Joy and fury shone on the faces of the men: only Marcus Decius seemed troubled and abstracted.  \"We shall be with them soon, my Marcus,\" cried Sergius, gayly, and then, noting the furrowed face of his first decurion: \"Surely, Trasimenus has not cooled your heart.  Take courage.  There is no water here to chill you.\"  Decius flushed through the deep bronze of his skin.  \"It is true that there is no water here, and blows might warm my blood. It was the command of the dictator that I thought of.\"  They had reached the level plain now.  A cluster of burning buildings hardly a mile ahead marked their goal.  \"And it is you, Marcus, who have been railing at those same commands?\"  \"I am an old soldier, my master.  I growl, but I obey.\"  For answer, Sergius urged on his horse with knee and thong.  Now they could distinguish dark shapes gliding hither and thither around the fires, and now they burst in upon a scene as of the orgies of demons.  Utterly unsuspicious of danger, the marauders had taken no precautions. Their wiry, little horses had been turned loose about the gardens, while the riders murdered and pillaged and ravished and destroyed.  The worst was over"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20219"],["title","The Lion's Brood (#7)"],["body",".  Little remained of the buildings, save clay walls covered with plaster; dead bodies were scattered here and there; the women and such of the slaves as had not been slaughtered, together with the farm stock and other things of value, were gathered beyond the reach of the fires; while, bound high upon a rude cross before his own threshold, the master of the farm writhed amid flames that shot upward to lick his hands and face.  Then, in an instant, the scene was changed: the Roman horsemen burst in, and, frenzied by the spectacle before them, slew madly and fast. Hither and thither they swept, wherever the dusky figures sought to fly, and the thin, reed-like lances rose and plunged and rose again, shivering and dripping, from the bodies of their victims.  But for their well-trained steeds, who came and knelt at their masters' calls, not one of the desert horsemen could have escaped, and, as it was, a mere dozen broke out from the carnage and scurried away, with the avengers in close and relentless pursuit.  Marcus Decius paused a moment before the cross and studied the torn frame and blackened skin of the man who hung there.  Then, with a swift movement of his lance, he transfixed the quivering body, and, hardly catching the \"Jove bless thee, comrade,\" and the sigh with which life escaped, he dashed on after the pursuing squadrons.     VI.  DISOBEDIENCE.  That the chase was doomed to be a vain one seemed apparent.  Once mounted and urging on their steeds with the shrill, barbaric cries of the desert, Hannibal's light horsemen were safe from all ordinary pursuit.  One after another of the Romans drew up his panting animal, and scarce half of their turmae pounded on.  Suddenly they saw the flying Numidians throw their horses upon their haunches.  A moment of indecision followed, and then, while several darted off obliquely, the remainder, seven or eight in all, swung around and charged straight at the legionaries.  At their head rode a giant, black as ebony save where gouts of red had splashed him with the hue of terror.  His frizzly hair was caught up high and ornamented with a cluster of ostrich feathers, while with his right hand he drew javelin after javelin from the sheaf he carried in his left, and launched them with unerring aim at his former pursuers.  Three had flown on their errands, two had brought down a soldier each, and the third quivered in the throat of Sergius' horse.  Then, as the animal reared and went over, carrying his rider with him, the assailant burst through the line, and in a moment had gained the open plain beyond.  Once more he was safe, safe but for one short, thick-set rider,--Marcus Decius, first decurion of the first turma, hastening to overtake his troop.  Escape from such a pursuer was child's play for the Numidian; but the fury of fight was on him, and, gnashing his white teeth, from which the thick, black lips seemed to writhe away, he bent low amid his horse's mane and, with an inarticulate cry, urged him straight at the veteran. His javelins had all been expended in breaking through the Roman line, and a short, heavy dagger was his only weapon.  Nothing daunted, he came on, evaded like a flash the thrust of Decius' spear, and hurled himself upon him.  It was the small buckler of the Roman that saved his life; the dagger passed through the ox-hide, slightly gashing his arm, and, before the barbarian could withdraw it, the impact of the horses in full career had sent both men and animals to the plain in a floundering heap.  Again the Numidian was quicker, and, gaining his feet, he sprang, weaponless as he was, upon the decurion still struggling to untangle himself from his fallen horse.  The buckler, with the African's knife thrust through it, had rolled away, and the possession of Decius' sword, which hung in its sheath upon his right thigh, became the object of the struggle.  Perhaps the strength of the men was not very unequal; but the Roman, hardly free from his mount, was undermost and wounded, so that the result seemed hardly doubtful.  The Numidian's charger had risen to its feet, and stood, with out-stretched neck, whinnying softly, as if sharing in the excitement of the contest.  Then the trampling of hoofs sounded in the ears of the straining combatants.  Decius felt his adversary make a convulsive effort as if to free himself, and then a gush of something warm came into the Roman's face, and his foe sank down upon him, limp and helpless.  With a last effort of his spent strength, he pushed the twitching body aside, and, staggering to his feet, saw Sergius standing beside him, with a dripping sword in his hand, and the bridle of Titus Icilius', the flag-bearer's, horse thrown over his left arm.  Remounting, they rode slowly back to their troop, and then the cause of the strange boldness of the fugitives was disclosed.  Advancing across the plain directly in the path of their flight came four hundred of the allied cavalry, whom the dictator had sent out to reconnoitre, and, caught thus between two lines, the Numidians had, for the most part, chosen to take their chances against the weaker force.  Not one of the marauders was alive, but they had sold their lives dearly; for a dozen of the Romans also were dead, and a score more showed wounds that marked this last spasm of barbarian frenzy.  While the men talked together, Sergius sought the praefect of the new detachment, a Hostilian of the family of Mancinus, whom he recalled among the young hot-heads that formed the party of the master-of-the-horse, and declaimed against the policy of Fabius as cowardly and base.  He found him in the best possible humour, laughing and making coarse jests amid a circle of decurions and optios--as rude a Roman as marched with the standards, yet able, when occasion demanded, to play the man of fashion who had spent a year at Athens.  The latter mood fell upon him when he descried Sergius.  He came forward to meet him.  \"Health to you, my Lucius!\" he cried, \"Surely the gods have held you in especial favour this day.  I am told you have cut up a few squadrons of this African offal.\"  \"With your timely aid,\" replied Sergius, bowing.  \"I but made the hares double to your coursing,\" said Hostilius, carelessly; \"and they tell me you have won both the spolia opima and a civic crown.  That is a great deal for one day--and under a peaceful dictator.\"  Sergius flushed.  \"I shall not claim them,\" he said.  \"Doubtless, Decius would have both slain the fellow and saved himself had I not come up--\"  \"No modesty! no modesty!\" cried Hostilius, gayly.  \"I assure you it is even less Greek than Roman in these days.  Lo! now, I myself will claim both for you at Rome, if only to show that I do not grudge you your share of the carrion.  Perhaps such honours will not prejudice you in a certain house on the Palatine,\" he added, slyly.  \"But come! you and I shall join our forces and raid together.  We have sent two hundred to Acheron since we left the camp, and birds have been singing on our left all the morning.\"  \"Where is the dictator now?\" asked Sergius.  \"In his tent, of course,\" replied the other, scornfully.  \"And no one cares where that may be.\"  \"And you?\"  \"Oh! he was persuaded at last to risk a scouting party, and, at the request of the brave Minucius, he gave the command to me with strict injunctions to use only my eyes.  Well, I have used them so sharply that my hands, too, have been full,\" and Hostilius laughed.  \"There are some five hundred of the cross-food that have evaded me thus far.  We shall catch them now, though, and, together, it will be easy for us to prevail.\"  Sergius was silent.  To make a dash from the heights in defence of allies dying in his sight, was one thing; to deliberately join this insubordinate in turning a reconnaissance into a raid, was another and much more serious matter.  The praefect noted his hesitation, and a slight frown chased the smile from his lips.  \"Or perhaps you prefer to obey the old woman's orders,\" he added, \"and keep your couch warm.  Well, our men and horses are fed by this time, and I am off.  If you are a Roman, I greet you to ride with me; if you fear robbers or the axe that smote Titus Manlius, why, I will bid you farewell and ride alone.\"  \"Where do you set your course?\" queried Sergius, with a vague hope of at least seeming to combine inclination with duty.  \"Toward the enemy,\" replied the other, shortly.  \"Does not the direction please you?\" and he turned to his horse.  Sergius' brow clouded.  His blood was hot with the conflict just finished.  Youth, courage--all combined to turn him from obedience; but obedience bade fair to conquer, when Marcia's laugh rang in his ears, and he could hear her gravely complimenting his prudence and discoursing on the rare value of docility in a husband.  Besides, what did it all matter?  Had he not said that he sought death? and, surely, the way it came soonest was the best.  Placing his hand upon his horse's withers, he vaulted upon its back, before the animal had time to kneel, and a moment later was beside Hostilius.  \"By Hercules!\" exclaimed the latter; \"I am glad you are here.  Even in these days of strange things, I would have found it difficult to imagine that a Sergian could be a coward.\"  \"And now,\" cried Sergius, \"you will only have to imagine him a fool.  So be it, and let the cost of his life pay for his folly.\"  \"Jupiter avert the omen!\" exclaimed Hostilius, shuddering, and then, turning to his trumpeter, he bade him give the signal for the march.  It was a desolate country--the fair plains of Campania through which they rode.  Here and there a cluster of blackened ruins, here and there things that were once men, fruit trees cut down, vines uprooted, corn-fields reaped with the sword; while far away upon the horizon smoky columns curled up to show that the work of devastation still went on.  \"May Mavers curse him--curse him forever!\" cried Hostilius, grinding his teeth in rage at each new"]]]
