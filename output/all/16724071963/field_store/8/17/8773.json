There was a flare of yellow torches under the cars as the trainmen searched every possible foothold, while Jim stood a short distance back so that he could see on either side of the train if a short, dark figure should dart forth to seek escape in the wilds of the mountains; but their quarry was not flushed into the open, even by the flare and glare of the torches.  \"Well, boy, we will have to give it up,\" said the conductor to Jim, when the train started once more.  \"It seems so,\" admitted Jim quietly.  It was hard for him to accept defeat, in this very first skirmish with his old enemy, Bill Broome, and harder still to lose his treasure that was to be the sinews of war in the campaign that had already opened. But Jim soon pulled himself together with rugged determination.  \"If I remember right, old Broome gave us a jolly good licking to start with, when he captured us in the canyon in the coast range,\" mused Jim to himself, \"and we beat him in the end.\"  But the reader is probably asking about the \"Mysterious Mexican or Where Did He Go To.\" Well, friend, I will tell you in confidence that Mr. Mexican was in the train all the time. Perhaps the ingenious reader has already solved the problem of the Mexican's escape, but for those who do not care to be bothered, I will relate what happened, and where he was located.  When he slipped through the door of the sleeping car, which his confederate, the negro, locked after him, he glided through several coaches, where the occupants were all soundly and some loudly asleep, until he came to the forward car which carried a number of emigrants, on their way to the coast.  It must be remembered that the Mexican was a dwarf, no larger than a child. It was easy for him to reach one of the long brass brackets above one of the rear seats, intended for bundles often heavier than he was; here he curled up in his heavy coat, for all the world like one of the bundles belonging to an emigrant and thus escaped detection.     CHAPTER VIII  IN FRISCO   \"Well, Jim,\" said the chief engineer of the _Sea Eagle_, James Darlington's yacht, \"Captain William Broome, able seaman, and all round pirate, has routed us horse and foot, taken your riches by proxy and the yacht away from me by his own personal efforts.\"  \"It does look like we were up against it,\" admitted Jim, \"but we have a fighting chance, and I propose to keep on that old codger's trail.\"  \"Good for you, Jim,\" said his friend heartily, \"but if I had a crew that had been worth a tinker's curse, the night that he attacked the yacht, I would have saved that for you! I verily believe that Broome owned several men in my crew, and the rest of them were half breeds and renegades, but the best that I could get together down in that forsaken port.\"  \"I don't blame you a bit, Chief,\" said Jim; \"no man could have done more for me than you did. Have some more of the olives.\"  \"Thanks, I will.\"  The two were seated in a well-known restaurant, by a window looking down on a busy thoroughfare. It was shortly after one o'clock in the afternoon but the lights were lit, as a dense fog peculiar to San Francisco had filled the atmosphere with an opaque gloom. There is a peculiar attractiveness about a first class metropolitan restaurant. It is a warm and pleasant refuge from the bleak heartlessness and merciless activity of a great city.  Jim, in an unconscious way, was aware of this inner delightfulness of the large softly lighted room, with the noiseless and obsequious waiters, the flowers, the music, the presence of many women, whose beauty and charm made the social life of this remarkable city a brilliant one. Jim was by no means an adept social lion, but he had an outward self-possession that stood him in good stead no matter where he was. The music, and the lights, and the subdued gayety of the scene about him, filled him with a certain elation.  Life seemed a very good thing to him, in spite of his present defeat, and the fact that he was surrounded by very pressing dangers. He would have been a very much surprised lad if he had been told that any of these beautiful gowned women regarded him with any interest. But he carried himself with a simple distinction and poise, that was derived from varied and harsh experiences, that gave him a quiet self-reliance.  James Darlington was not handsome, but he was not bad looking, as he had the power and grace of perfect health and condition. Even the few scars of desperate encounters in the past had not disfigured him, and in his neatly fitting gray suit, which his friend, the engineer, had helped him select, his brown straight hair, smoothly brushed upon his long masculine head, and clear gray eyes, Jim was a pleasant looking specimen of American youth. The chief engineer of the _Sea Eagle_, was perfectly aware of the certain amount of interest which Jim excited even if the boy was entirely oblivious of it. He was a thorough man of the world and regarded the scene which elated Jim, with a cool contentment and a certain appraisal of contempt.  \"I do hope that no girl will come along, and disturb the lad's head, he is too good a fighting man to be made a fool of,\" he mused to himself, as he noted the sparkle of interest in Jim's eyes as the boy watched the diners at the different tables.  At that moment the orchestra in the flower hidden balcony began to play the Mexican national anthem La Poloma, with its enchanting melody, and the well-known strains made a deep rhythmic run through the boy's blood. Outwardly the young masculine has no sentiment, but inwardly he is full of a sense of romance, that he would be shy to confess.  \"Here comes the distinguished personage himself,\" said John Berwick, the chief engineer, \"and his fair daughter, Castilians from Mexico, and that accounts for the music. Why didn't they render 'Yankee Doodle,' when we made our triumphal entry, eh, James?\"  Jim merely grinned at his companion, and then his face sobered, and his eyes opened wide. The new arrivals were by no means strangers to him. The gentleman was tall and distinguished looking with white mustachios, while his daughter was very dark after the Spanish type; the sheen of her hair like that of a raven's wing, and her complexion of a pellucid pallor, while her dark eyes had depth, and not merely surface.  Under the obsequious guidance of the head waiter, they passed directly by the table where Jim and John Berwick were seated, so close indeed that the flutter of the señorita's mantilla brushed Jim's arm. At the second table beyond they were assigned places, the señor facing Jim. In a way this was a relief to the youth, for he was terribly confused at the sight of the girl and he was afforded time to collect his wits. The señor did not even give a casual glance around, but confined his attention to the menu.  \"Old friends, Jim?\" asked Berwick who was quick to note the lad's perturbation.  \"Why, yes,\" answered Jim, \"there can be no doubt about it. I have told you about our adventure in Mexico, where we saved the Señorita Cordova from Cal Jenkins and his gang and were entertained at the castle by her father. Well, there they are. I hardly think the señorita would recognize me. It seems a long time ago.\"  \"Don't you flatter yourself on that point,\" said the engineer. \"Let her once get a square look at you, and she will know you all right enough. She had an uneasy suspicion when she went past, that she had seen the distinguished gentleman with his back to her somewhere. She would like to turn around now. What did I tell you, she has dropped her fan.\"  \"You must have eyes in the back of your head,\" remarked James, \"but the waiter has picked it up.\"  \"She smiles very sweetly in thanks,\" improvised the engineer, \"but she would like to swat him with it. These dear creatures are not as sweet as they sometimes appear. Have you still the rose she gave you in the castle in Spain--I mean Mexico?\"  \"Why, I didn't tell you about that did I?\" asked the simple Jim. John Berwick doubled over with silent laughter.  \"You did not need to tell me,\" he said when he got his breath; \"that method is as old as the daughters of Eve.\"  \"I guess I will go and introduce myself,\" said Jim hurriedly. \"Come on, Berwick.\"  \"Hold on, Jim,\" said the engineer, \"I don't think that is the wisest plan. It makes it awkward for both sides, and people don't like to have their lunch broken in on. We will wait for them in the lobby, or find out at what hotel they are stopping and you can send up your card.\"  \"You are coming, too, to call on them,\" said Jim impulsively; \"I want them to meet you.\" But John Berwick shook his head with slow emphasis and decision.  \"Nay, nay, James,\" he said, \"I have a very susceptible heart. I might become enamored with the fair señorita, that would be trouble, sequel two ex-friends on the sea sands by moonlight, two revolvers flashing at the signal, two beautiful corpses stretched out on the sad sea sands, then slow music, all on account of a girl with dark hair who once wore a red rose in it. Life to me is too interesting for any such nonsense.\"  Jim laughed at his friend's way of expressing himself, and tried to make him change his mind about the proposed call, but an older man would have told him that there was much sound sense under John Berwick's odd humor. The truth was that the more experienced man of the world knew that the real danger lay in the señorita's caring for him instead of the more simple and straightforward Jim. Berwick knew that it was social experience and knowledge that was apt to count for most in such matters.  \"Lucky this isn't our busy day,\" remarked the engineer, as they waited"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20259"],["title","Frontier Boys in Frisco (#7)"],["body"," the Señor da Cordova and his daughter to finish their lunch.  \"It's Broome's move, anyway,\" replied Jim.  Just then there was an incident at the other table that invited their attention.     CHAPTER IX  THE WATCHER   The Señorita da Cordova, had suddenly leaned forward in an animated manner and spoke to her father indicating at the same time someone who was standing under an awning on the other side of the thoroughfare. Whether the man's presence caused her fright, or mere excitement it was hard to tell.  \"There he is, there he is!\" she was heard to exclaim.  Jim followed the direction of her glance, and immediately he jumped to his feet.  \"Come on, Berwick,\" he cried, \"we want that fellow across the street.\"  Berwick was puzzled but he knew that Jim was no alarmist who would start on a wild goose chase, without rhyme or reason. He saw the figure across the way but did not recognize who it was. Thrusting a bill into the waiter's hands, a procedure the waiter did not resent, he followed Jim out of the restaurant. As their sudden departure made a slight commotion, the señorita turned her head and got a fair look at Jim. A flush of surprise came into her face, and her dark eyes opened wide.  \"Why, Father, look at the tall American going out,\" she whispered; \"it is the señor who saved me from the bandits.\"  \"There are other tall Americans,\" he said with a smile; \"there was a resemblance but that happens frequently in life, my daughter, the other man bore no resemblance to his brothers.\" The señorita shook her dark head with emphasis.  \"It was not nice of Señor James to run away from us, as though we had the plague; it was certainly very far from nice, and I shall make him pay some day.\"  \"Señor James,\" exclaimed her father, a slight frown on his brow; \"you certainly have a remarkable memory, Marie.\"  \"It is not at all wonderful, Father,\" replied the girl with much spirit; \"did he not save me from that terrible Señor Jenkins and his band? I shall remember him as long as there is the breath of life in my little body.\"  \"His memory does not seem to be as retentive as yours,\" said her father with quiet sarcasm. The señorita's face flushed at this thrust and she sat moodily silent for a while, then something happened which changed the current of her interest.  \"Look,\" she cried, \"the man across the street is running. What can be the matter?\"  \"It is your friend, Señor James, and his comrade is the matter,\" remarked her father.  Sure enough the two were in fast pursuit of, \"the man across the street,\" and then they turned a corner but crossing to the further side of the thoroughfare they were still in view.  \"Oh, dear!\" cried the señorita, \"I wish I could be informed as to what all this commotion is about and know who will win.\"  Let us follow them, and perhaps we shall find out. I daresay the astute reader has already guessed the name of the gentleman who caused this distinct and sudden interest and flung consternation and activity into two separate groups. As James Darlington followed the glance of the young girl, he had recognized the dwarfish figure of the Mexican who had robbed him of his treasure and who had previously led him and his party into dire trouble--hence his excitement, but why the interest of the Señorita da Cordova?--Ah! that is another tale, but now to tell the story of the chase, for upon the result much would depend.  \"Take your hat and coat, Jim!\" warned John Berwick, as the two rushed from the restaurant.  \"I won't bother with my overcoat!\" shouted Jim; \"I'm going to catch that fellow now!\"  \"Take care of his coat!\" cried Berwick to the boy in the lobby, tossing him a quarter.  Then the two friends were outside in the foggy street, where phantom street cars and passersby were moving through the thick white density that had rolled in from the Pacific.  \"Just wait here, James,\" said the engineer, as they stood sheltered by the corner of the building from observation. \"He don't know me from Adam and I'll just saunter up and collar him.\"  \"No, John,\" said Jim decidedly, \"I'm just aching to get my hands on him!\"  Another reason which he was too wise to give, was that this same Mexican was a most dangerous animal to handle even if taken unawares, and he preferred to run the risk himself.  \"I don't wish to spoil your game, Jim,\" replied Berwick, \"so I will just saunter along this side, and capture him if he escapes your clutches.\"  \"All right,\" said Jim, \"but he is a wary old fox and some of his pals may be on the lookout too, so you had better stay here until you see me on the other side of the street; I am not going directly across.\"  Jim was too old a campaigner to make a wild rush at his quarry and thus run a chance of losing him in the shuffle. Then, too, he had a wholesome regard for the cunning of his enemy, who was not to be easily trapped. Accordingly Jim, instead of crossing the street, went down around the next block.  In a short time Berwick saw a tall figure, with a black sombrero, emerge from the fog down the street, walking casually along as if not particularly interested in any of the landscape, but out of the corner of his eye he watched the short, sinister-looking fellow he was after. By some obscure instinct the Mexican scented danger and started up the street, and Jim quickened his pace, as Berwick came around the corner where he had been concealed. Instantly the Mexican took the alarm and started on the run, but Jim was like a lion unleashed for his prey; in another leap he would have felled the rascal to the earth, but the Mexican, handicapped as to speed, knew the city as hand to glove, especially every by-way, crooked lane, or devious alley.  His knowledge stood him in good stead now; he swerved into a narrow passageway between two buildings, that was shut off from the street by a wooden gate, which at this moment was left unfastened; this was not by accident, either. Before Jim could turn, the fellow had turned the wooden button fastening the door.  Jim was furious at this escape, almost under his fingers, and his pleasure was not increased when he heard a gentle voice from the other side of the gate: \"Good-by, Señor Gringo, I cannot wait here all the afternoon. I have some money to spend.\" Jim with one bound threw his one hundred and eighty odd pounds against the obstruction. There was a splintering crash, and then Jim tore into the alleyway followed a moment later by his comrade.  At the sound, a fat policeman a block away started on a waddling run to find the cause of the outbreak, and the father and daughter who were watching from the window of the restaurant were more than interested.  \"Ah, Mother of Mercies!\" cried the girl, \"he will be killed.\" Then she could not help exclaiming in admiration, \"What strength! It is Señor James, as I told you, Father.\"  \"You may be right, my daughter,\" he admitted; \"this Americana is very brave and strong, but I trust he will not get himself disliked by killing this Manuel del Garrote, who is of importance not in keeping with his size.\"  \"He had not better come into my presence if he harms the Señor,\" said the Señorita da Cordova with a bitter emphasis, which her dark eyes endorsed.  \"You must learn, my daughter, that in great enterprises we cannot always choose our associates.\"         *       *       *       *       *  When Jim tore through into the passageway between two brick walls, he saw the Mexican dodging around the corner of one of the buildings about a hundred and fifty feet ahead. It did not take Jim many seconds to reach the same corner, and although the rascal was nowhere in sight, the way of his escape was plain.  Opening from the areaway back of the buildings was another gate, that the fleeing Mexican had not time to close; beyond was the blank wall of fog filling the side street with soft gray density. In much less time than I write it, James was out through the gate on to the lustrous black sidewalk, polished with the moisture. But once again the man made his escape and it seemed this time that it was for good. There was a four-wheeler standing near the curb, into which the fellow plunged, and the driver, without a word, gave his two rusty blacks the whip and away they dashed.  Jim was just in time to see the dwarf jump into the coupé. He did not stop with his mouth open, but set out undaunted to overtake the fugitive; neither was he distanced, for Jim had not stayed in the effete East long enough to get pursy and to lose his wind.  Now it was different with the engineer, John Berwick. He was lithe and active enough, and at a hundred yards, was no doubt faster than his friend Jim, but he knew that he was not equal to a cross-city run of several miles in the wake of a four-wheeler drawn by two sturdy mustangs.     CHAPTER X  THE CHASE BEGINS   At the corner of a street stood a hack to which was hitched a big black, and the rusty-looking individual who held the reins was anxious for immediate service. \"Right this way, gents!\" he yelled, as he noted the signs of a chase. \"I'll catch Bill Durnell's team if I bust a wheel.\"  \"Five dollars if you do,\" cried John Berwick, as he and Jim leaped into the musty interior of the cab. Before they were fairly inside the vehicle was in motion. The driver hit his horse a clip, and away the hack rattled and jounced in furious pursuit, making racket enough for ten ordinary carts. The noise of the wheels upon the cobbles aroused the immediate interest of the street urchins on both sides of the thoroughfare. They threw compliments as well as stones. One, quicker than the others, managed to get a perilous hold on the back of the vehicle, only to be hurled sprawling on the hard road as the hack whirled around a corner on two wheels. He stayed there for a few seconds, with a pained and surprised look on his befreckled face, then he jumped up and fired a rock from the gutter that swatted the coach squarely making a big dent in the black expanse of back.  \"I'll break ye for that ye little gutter "]]]
