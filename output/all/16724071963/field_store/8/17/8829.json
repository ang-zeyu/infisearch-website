Boheme is not down on the map, because it is not a money-order post-office. It is only a Queen Mab fairy fabric of a warm, transient desire; its walls being constructed of the stuff that dreams are made of, and its little life is rounded with a pipe and tabor, two empties and a brass tray. Yet the semblance of the thing is there and this often deceives the very elect. Around every art studio are found the young men in velveteen who smoke infinite cigarettes, and throw off opinions about this great man and that, and prate prosaically in blase monotone of the Beautiful. Sometimes these young persons give lectures on \"Art as I Have Found It\"; but do not be deceived by this--the art that lives is probably being produced by small, shy, red-headed men who work on a top floor, and whom you can only find with the help of a search-warrant. One sort talks of art, the other kind produces it. One tells of truth, the other is living it.  Edgar Allan Poe wrote the most gruesome stories that have ever been told, just to prove that life is a tragedy and not worth living. But who ever lived fuller and applied himself to hard work more conscientiously in order to make his point? Poe wrote and rewrote, and changed and added and interlined and balanced it all on his actor's tongue, and read it aloud before the glass. Poe shortened his days and flung away a valuable fag-end of his life, trying to show that life is not worth living, and thus proved it is. Gray spent thirteen years writing his \"Elegy,\" and so made clear the point that the man who does good work does not at the last lay him down and rest his head upon the lap of earth, a youth to fortune and to fame unknown. Gray secured both fame and fortune. He was so successful that he declined the Laureateship, and had the felicity to die of gout. Gray's immortality is based upon the fact that his life gave the lie to his logic. The man who thinks out what he wants to do, and then works and works hard, will win, and no others do, or ever have, or can--God will not have it so.         *       *       *       *       *  As a violinist Paganini far surpassed all other players who ever lived; and when one follows the story of his life, the fact is apparent that he succeeded because he worked.  And yet behold the paradox! The idea existed in his own day, and is abroad yet, that \"the devil guided his hand,\" for the thought that the devil is more powerful than God has ever been held by the majority of men--more especially if a fiddle is concerned.  Such patience, such persistency, such painstaking effort as the man put forth for a score of years would have made him master at anything. The public knows nothing of these long years of labor and preparation--it sees only the result, and this result shows such consummate ease and naturalness--all done without effort--that it exclaims, \"A genius--the devil guides his hand!\" The remark was made of Titian and his wonderful color effects, and then again of Rembrandt with his mysterious limpid shadows--their competitors could not understand it! And so they disposed of the subject by attributing it to a supernatural agency.  Things all men can do and explain are natural; things we can not explain are \"supernatural.\" Progress consists in taking things out of the supernatural pigeonhole and placing them in the natural. As soon as we comprehend the supernatural, we are a bit surprised to find it is perfectly natural.  But the limitations of great men are seen in that when they have acquired the skill to do a difficult thing well, and the public cries, \"Genius!\" why the genius humors the superstition and begins to allow the impression to get out mysteriously that he \"never had a lesson in his life.\"  Any man who caters to the public is to a great degree spoiled by the public. Actors act off the stage as well as on, falling victims to their trade: their lives are stained by pretense and affectation, just as the dyer's hand is subdued to the medium in which it works. The man of talent who is much before the public poses because his audience wishes him to; one step more and the pose becomes natural--he can not divest himself of it. Paganini by hard work became a consummate player; and then so the dear public should receive its money's worth, he evolved into a consummate poseur--but he was still the Artist.         *       *       *       *       *  A large number of writers have described the appearance and playing of Niccolo Paganini, but none ever did the assignment with the creepy vividness of Heinrich Heine. The rest of this chapter is Heine's. I make the explanation because the passage is so well known that it would be both indiscreet and inexpedient for me to bring my literary jimmy to bear and claim it as my own--much as I would like to.  Says Heinrich Heine:       I believe that only one man has succeeded in putting Paganini's      true physiognomy upon paper--a deaf painter, Lyser by name, who, in      a frenzy full of genius, has with a few strokes of chalk so well      hit the great violinist's head that one is at the same time amused      and terrified at the truth of the drawing. \"The devil guided my      hand,\" the deaf painter said to me, chuckling mysteriously, and      nodding his head with a good-natured irony in the way he generally      accompanied his genial witticisms. This painter was, however, a      wonderful old fellow; in spite of his deafness he was      enthusiastically fond of music, and he knew how, when near enough      to the orchestra, to read the music in the musicians' faces, and to      judge the more or less skilful execution by the movements of their      fingers; indeed, he wrote critiques on the opera for an excellent      journal at Hamburg. And yet is that peculiarly wonderful? In the      visible symbols of the performance the deaf painter could see the      sounds. There are men to whom the sounds themselves are invisible      symbols in which they hear colors and forms.       I am sorry that I no longer possess Lyser's little drawing; it      would perhaps have given you an idea of Paganini's outward      appearance. Only with black and glaring strokes could those      mysterious features be seized, features which seemed to belong more      to the sulphurous kingdom of shades than to the sunny world of      life. \"Indeed, the devil guided my hand,\" the deaf painter assured      me, as we stood before the pavilion at Hamburg on the day when      Paganini gave his first concert there. \"Yes, my friend, it is true      that he has sold himself to the devil, body and soul, in order to      become the best violinist, to fiddle millions of money, and      principally to escape the damnable galley where he had already      languished many years. For, you see, my friend, when he was      chapel-master at Lucca he fell in love with a princess of the      theater, was jealous of some little abbate, was perhaps deceived by      the faithless amata, stabbed her in approved Italian fashion, came      in the galley to Genoa, and as I said, sold himself to the devil to      escape from it, became the best violin-player, and imposed upon us      this evening a contribution of two thalers each. But, you see, all      good spirits praise God! There in the avenue he comes himself, with      his suspicious impresario.\"       It was Paganini himself whom I then saw for the first time. He wore      a dark gray overcoat, which reached to his heels, and made his      figure seem very tall. His long black hair fell in neglected curls      on his shoulders, and formed a dark frame round the pale,      cadaverous face, on which sorrow, genius and hell had engraved      their lines. Near him danced along a little pleasing figure,      elegantly prosaic--with rosy, wrinkled face, bright gray little      coat with steel buttons, distributing greetings on all sides in an      insupportably friendly way, leering up, nevertheless, with      apprehensive air at the gloomy figure who walked earnest and      thoughtful at his side. It reminded one of Retzsch's presentation      of \"Faust\" and Wagner walking before the gates of Leipzig. The deaf      painter made comments to me in his mad way, and bade me observe      especially the broad, measured walk of Paganini. \"Does it not      seem,\" said he, \"as if he had the iron cross-pole still between his      legs? He has accustomed himself to that walk forever. See, too, in      what a contemptuous, ironical way he sometimes looks at his guide      when the latter wearies him with his prosaic questions. But he can      not separate himself from him; a bloody contract binds him to that      companion, who is no other than Satan. The ignorant multitude,      indeed, believe that this guide is the writer of comedies and      anecdotes, Harris from Hanover, whom Paganini has taken with him to      manage the financial business of his concerts. But they do not know      that the devil has only borrowed Herr George Harris' form, and that      meanwhile the poor soul of this poor man is shut up with other      rubbish in a trunk at Hanover, until the devil returns its      flesh-envelope, while he perhaps will guide his master through the      world in a worthier form--namely as a black poodle.\"       But if Paganini seemed mysterious and strange enough when I saw him      walking in bright midday under the green trees of the Hamburg      Jungfernstieg, how his awful bizarre appearance startled me at the      concert in the evening! The Hamburg Opera House was the scene of      this concert, and the art-loving public had flocked there so      early, and in such numbers, that I only just succeeded in obtaining      a little place in the orchestra. Although it was post-day, I saw in      the first row of boxes the whole educated commercial world, a whole      Olympus of bankers and other millionaires, the gods of coffee"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20318"],["title","Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great - Volume 14 (#6)"],["body","sugar by the side of their fat goddesses, Junos of Wandrahm and      Aphrodites of Dreckwall. A religious silence reigned through the      assembly. Every eye was directed towards the stage. Every ear was      making ready to listen. My neighbor, an old furrier, took the dirty      cotton out of his ears in order to drink in better the costly      sounds for which he had paid his two thalers.       At last a dark figure, which seemed to have arisen from the      underworld, appeared upon the stage. It was Paganini in his black      costume--the black dress-coat and the black waistcoat of a horrible      cut, such as is prescribed by infernal etiquette at the court of      Proserpine. The black trousers hung anxiously around the thin legs.      The long arms appeared to grow still longer, as, holding the violin      in one hand and the bow in the other, he almost touched the floor      with them, while displaying to the public his unprecedented      obeisances. In the angular curves of his body there was a horrible      woodenness, and also something absurdly animal-like, that during      these bows one could not help feeling a strange desire to laugh.      But his face, that appeared still more cadaverously pale in the      glare of the orchestra lights, had about it something so imploring,      so simply humble, that a sorrowful compassion repressed one's      desire to smile. Had he learnt these complimentary bows from an      automaton, or a dog? Is that the entreating gaze of one sick unto      death, or is there lurking behind it the mockery of a crafty      miser? Is that a man brought into the arena at the moment of death,      like a dying gladiator, to delight the public with his convulsions?      Or is it one risen from the dead, a vampire with a violin, who, if      not the blood out of our hearts, at any rate sucks the gold out of      our pockets?       Such questions crossed our minds while Paganini was performing his      strange bows, but all those thoughts were at once still when the      wonderful master placed his violin under his chin and began to      play.       As for me, you already know my musical second-sight, my gift of      seeing at each tone a figure equivalent to the sound, and so      Paganini with each stroke of his bow brought visible forms and      situations before my eyes; he told me in melodious hieroglyphics      all kinds of brilliant tales; he, as it were, made a magic lantern      play its colored antics before me, he himself being chief actor. At      the first stroke of his bow the stage scenery around him had      changed; he suddenly stood with his music-desk in a cheerful room,      decorated in a gay, irregular way after the Pompadour style;      everywhere little mirrors, gilded Cupids, Chinese porcelain, a      delightful chaos of ribbons, garlands of flowers, white gloves,      torn lace, false pearls, powder-puffs, diamonds of gold-leaf and      spangles--such tinsel as one finds in the room of a prima donna.      Paganini's outward appearance had also changed, and certainly most      advantageously; he wore short breeches of lily-colored satin, a      white waistcoat embroidered with silver, and a coat of bright blue      velvet with gold buttons; the hair in little carefully curled locks      bordered his face, which was young and rosy, and gleamed with sweet      tenderness as he ogled the pretty young lady who stood near him at      the music-desk, while he played the violin.       Yes, I saw at his side a pretty young creature, dressed in antique      costume, the white satin swelled out above the waist, making the      figure still more charmingly slender; the high raised hair was      powdered and curled, and the pretty round face shone out all the      more openly with its glancing eyes, its little rouged cheeks, its      tiny beauty-patches, and the sweet, impertinent little nose. In her      hand was a roll of white paper, and by the movements of her lips as      well as by the coquettish waving to and fro of her little upper lip      she seemed to be singing; but none of her trills was audible to me,      and only from the violin with which young Paganini led the lovely      child could I discover what she sang, and what he himself during      her song felt in his soul.       Oh, what melodies were those! Like the nightingale's notes, when      the fragrance of the rose intoxicates her yearning young heart with      desire, they floated in the twilight. Oh, what melting, languid      delight was that! The sounds kissed each other, then fled away      pouting, and then, laughing, clasped each other and became one, and      died away in intoxicating harmony. Yes, the sounds carried on their      merry game like butterflies, when one, in playful provocation, will      escape from another, hide behind a flower, be overtaken at last,      and then, wantonly joying with the other, fly away into the golden      sunlight. But a spider, a spider can prepare a sudden tragical fate      for such enamored butterflies!       Did the young heart anticipate this? A melancholy sighing tone, a      sad foreboding of some slowly approaching misfortune, glided softly      through the enrapturing melodies that were streaming from      Paganini's violin. His eyes became moist. Adoringly he knelt down      before his amata. But, alas! as he bowed down to kiss her feet, he      saw under the sofa a little abbate! I do not know what he had      against the poor man, but the Genoese became pale as death. He      seized the little fellow with furious hands, drew a stiletto from      its sheath, and buried it in the young rogue's breast.       At this moment, however, a shout of \"Bravo! Bravo!\" broke out from      all sides. Hamburg's enthusiastic sons and daughters were paying      the tribute of their uproarious applause to the great artist, who      had just ended the first of his concert, and was now bowing with      even more angles and contortions than before. And on his face the      abject humility seems to me to have become more intense. From his      eyes stared a sorrowful anxiety like that of a poor malefactor.      \"Divine!\" cried my neighbor, the furrier, as he scratched his ears;      \"that piece alone was worth two thalers.\"       When Paganini began to play again a gloom came before my eyes. The      sounds were not transformed into bright forms and colors; the      master's form was clothed in gloomy shades, out of the darkness of      which his music moaned in the most piercing tones of lamentation.       Only at times, when a little lamp that hung above cast its      sorrowful light over him, could I catch a glimpse of his pale      countenance, on which the youth was not yet extinguished. His      costume was singular, in two colors, yellow and red. Heavy chains      weighed upon his feet. Behind him moved a face whose physiognomy      indicated a lusty goat-nature. And I saw at times long, hairy hands      seize assistingly the strings of the violin on which Paganini was      playing. They often guided the hand which held the bow, and then a      bleat-laugh of applause accompanied the melody, which gushed from      the violin ever more full of sorrow and anguish. They were melodies      which were like the song of the fallen angels who had loved the      daughters of earth, and being exiled from the kingdom of the      blessed, sank into the underworld with faces red with shame. They      were melodies in whose bottomless depths glimmered neither      consolation nor hope. When the saints in heaven hear such melodies,      the praise of God dies upon their paled lips, and they cover their      heads weeping. At times when the obligate goat's laugh bleated in      among the melodious pangs, I caught a glimpse in the background of      a crowd of small women-figures who nodded their odious heads with      wicked wantonness. Then a rush of agonizing sounds came from the      violin, and a fearful groan and a sob, such as was never heard upon      earth before, nor will be perhaps heard upon earth again, unless in      the valley of Jehoshaphat, when the colossal trumpets of doom shall      ring out, and the naked corpses shall crawl forth from the grave to      abide their fate. But the agonized violinist suddenly made one      stroke of the bow, such a mad, despairing stroke, that his chains      fell rattling from him, and his mysterious assistant and the other      foul, mocking forms vanished.       At this moment my neighbor, the furrier, said, \"A pity, a pity! a      string has snapped--that comes from constant pizzicato.\"       Had a string of the violin really snapped? I do not know. I only      observed the alternation in the sounds, and Paganini and his      surroundings seemed to me again suddenly changed. I could scarcely      recognize him in the monk's brown dress, which concealed rather      than clothed him. With savage countenance half-hid by the cowl,      waist girt with a cord, and bare feet, Paganini stood, a solitary      defiant figure, on a rocky prominence by the sea, and played his      violin. But the sea became red and redder, and the sky grew paler,      till at last the surging water looked like bright, scarlet blood,      and the sky above became of a ghastly corpse-like pallor, and the      stars came out large and threatening; and those stars were      black--black as glooming coal. But the tones of the violin grew      ever more stormy and defiant, and the eyes of the terrible player      sparkled with such a scornful lust of destruction, and his thin      lips moved with such a horrible haste, that it seemed as if he      murmured some old accursed charms to conjure the storm and loose      the evil spirits that lie imprisoned in the abysses of the sea.      Often, when he stretched his long, thin arm from the broad monk's      sleeve, and swept the air with his bow, he seemed like some      sorcerer who"]]]
