In this dulcet instrument I have found a balm for all my woes, and I intend to play it incessantly for the rest of my existence.\"  \"You'll blow yourself into a consumption,\" said Harry Girdwood.  \"Well, if I do, I'm only a poor orphan whom no one will regret,\" returned Mr. Figgins, a tear trickling down his nose at the thought of his lonely condition; \"I shall die breathing forth some mournful melody, and my flute will----\"  \"You can leave that to us as a legacy, and we'll put it under a glass case,\" said Harry.  \"No; my flute shall be buried with me in the silent grave.\"  \"We don't care what you do with it after you're dead,\" returned Jack, \"but we object to being annoyed with it while you're alive.\"  \"Oh, you shan't be exposed to any further annoyances on my account,\" said the orphan, rising grandly; \"I and my flute will take our departure together.\"  With these words he left the room, and very shortly afterwards quitted the house.                    *          *          *          *  Mr. Figgins being determined to keep apart from the Harkaway party, gave up the rooms he had taken, and after some search found another lodging in the upper chamber of a house in a retired part of the town.  Here he determined to settle down, and devote himself with more ardour than ever to the practice of his favourite instrument.                    *          *          *          *  It was night.  Mr. Figgins was in bed, but he could get no sleep.  Curious insects, common to Eastern climes, crawled forth from chinks in the walls and cracks in the floor, and nibbled the orphan in various parts of his anatomy till he felt as if the surface of his skin was one large blister.  \"What a dreadful climate is this,\" he murmured, as he sat up in bed; \"nothing but creeping things everywhere. Phew! what's to be done?\"  He reflected a moment.  \"I have it!\" he exclaimed, \"my flute, my precious flute, that will soothe me.\"  Hopping nimbly out of bed, he dressed himself in his European costume, seized his instrument, and began a tune.  He had been playing all day long, and the other lodgers in the house were congratulating themselves on the cessation of the infliction, when suddenly the instrumental torture commenced again.  \"Too-too, too-tum-too, tooty-tum, tooty-tum, too-tum-too,\" went the flute, in a more shrill and vigorous manner than ever, whilst a select party of dogs, attracted by the melody, assembled under the window and howled in concert.  In the chamber next to that occupied by the infatuated Figgins lodged a Turk, Bosja by name.  Bosja, in the first place, had no taste for music, and particularly detested the sound of a flute.  Secondly, he was suffering from an excruciating toothache, and the incessant too-tum, too-tum, tooty-tum-too--with the additional music of the dogs--drove him mad.  He was sitting up with his pipe in his mouth, and a green, yellow-striped turban pulled down over his ears, trying to shut out the sound, but in vain.  \"Oh, oh! Allah be merciful to me!\" he groaned, as the irritated nerve gave him an extra twinge.  \"Too-too, too-tum-too, too-tum, too-tum, tooty-tum-too,\" from the orphan's flute answered him.  \"Allah confound the wretch with his tooty-tum-too!\" growled the distracted sufferer; \"if he only knew what I am enduring.\"  But this Mr. Figgins did not know.  Probably he would not have cared if he had known, and he continued to pour forth melodious squeakings to his own entire satisfaction.  At length the patience of Bosja was utterly exhausted, and he summoned the landlady.  \"What son of Shitan have you got in the next room?\" he demanded of her, fiercely.  \"I know very little of him,\" returned the mistress of the house; \"only that he is a Frankish gentleman, who dresses sometimes as a Turk, and has lately come to lodge here.\"  \"He is a dog, and the son of a dog! May his flute choke him, and his father's grave be defiled!\" growled the irascible Turk, \"tell him to leave off, or I will kill him and burn his flute.\"  The landlady went at once and tapped at the door of the musical lodger.  There was no response save the too-too-too of the flute.  \"Signor!\" she called after a moment.  \"What's the matter?\" inquired Mr. Figgins from within; \"do you wish me to come and play you a tune?\" and he then continued \"too-too, tooty-too.\"  \"The gentleman in the next room objects to the sound of your flute.\"  \"Does he?--tooty-too, tooty-too.\"  \"Yes; and he begs you'll leave off.\"  \"I shan't!--tooty-tum, tooty-tum, tooty-too. I intend to play all night.\"  The landlady, having delivered her message, went downstairs.  Mr. Figgins still continued to blow away and the agonized Bosja to mutter curses not loud, but deep, upon his head and his instrument.  But patience has its limits, and Bosja, never remarkable for that virtue, having sworn all the oaths he knew twice over, at last sprang from his bed, and dashing down his pipe, rapped fiercely at the wall.  \"What do you want? Shall I come and play a few tunes to you?\" inquired the orphan, placidly pausing for an instant.  \"You vile son of perdition, stop that accursed noise!\" shouted the Turk.  \"Too-too, tooty-too.\"  \"Do you hear, unbelieving dog?\"  \"Tooty-too--yes, I hear--tooty-tooty-tooty-too.\"  \"Then why don't you stop?\"  \"Because I intend to go on--too-tum-too--all night\"  \"But you're driving me to distraction.\"  \"Nonsense; go to bed and sleep--tooty-tum, tooty-tum, tooty-too. You will like the beautiful flute in time.\"  \"But I can't sleep with that infernal tooty-too in any ears, and I've got the toothache.\"  \"Have it out. You'll feel better.\"  This cool irony on the part of Mr. Figgins was like oil poured upon the fierce temper of the irascible Bosja, and he shouted loudly--  \"If I hear any more of that diabolical 'tootum-too,' I swear by Allah I'll take your life, and give your body to the crows and vultures.\"  \"Ha, ha!\" laughed the reckless Figgins. \"Tooty-tum, tooty-tum, too-tum--\"  But before he could finish his musical phrase, the maddened Bosja had seized his scimitar, and rushed like a bull at the partition.  The partition was thin, the Turk was burly and thick, and he plunged through head first into the orphan's apartment, to the no little surprise and dismay of the latter.  It was quite a picture.  Bosja waved his weapon over his head; Mark Antony Figgins hopped upon the bed and wrapped himself tightly round in the clothes, clutching his flute to his side.  For a moment the pair stood glaring at each other.  \"Your flute, vile dog, or your life,\" shouted the Turk.  \"I object to part with either,\" cried the orphan. \"Go and have your tooth out, and be happy.\"  Down came the scimitar with a swish in the direction of his head.  But the grocer had quickly withdrawn it beneath the clothes.  Not to be thwarted, however, in his vengeance, the burly Bosja swooped down upon the heap, and dragged them up in his grasp, the orphan included.  \"Now I have you,\" he cried, as he seized the obnoxious flute.  \"Give me my instrument, infidel,\" shrieked the orphan, as he threw off the blanket, and clung to the flute with desperation.  At the same moment, he recognised the green and yellow-striped turban on the head of the Turk.  It was Bosja into whose hands it had fallen, when Mr. Figgins was escaping from the mob.  \"That is my turban,\" he cried, as with one hand he dragged it from his enemy's head, with dauntless vehemence, and bringing his flute down with a smart crack on the Turk's bald pate.  The Turk, who was much more of a bully than a hero, was quite confounded at the excited energy which the Frankish lodger displayed. Dropping his scimitar, he then had a struggle for the flute.  Round the room they went, pulling and hauling.  At length, lurching against the door, it burst open.  The combatants now found themselves on the landing.  Here the struggle continued, till, at length, giving a desperate tug, the flute came in half, and Bosja fell backwards, head over heels, down the stairs, with the upper joint of the instrument in his hand.  The landlady, who thought the house was falling, came hurrying to see what had happened, and found the Turk lying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs, with the breath almost knocked out of his body.  It took some time to bring him to himself.  It was just as he was recovering there was a loud knocking at the street door.  On opening it, a body of Turkish soldiers appeared drawn up in front of it.  \"What is the cause of this disturbance?\" inquired the leader of the troop.  Bosja quickly gave his own version of what had happened.  Of course, it was highly exaggerated.  He, a true believer, had been assaulted, robbed of his turban, and thrown downstairs by a rascally dog of a Giaour, who lodged in a room next to him.  This was quite sufficient to arouse the indignation of the officer, and, with three of his troop, that functionary ascended to seize the delinquent.  But, on reaching the room, it was discovered to be empty.  \"The Frankish hound laughs at our beards,\" said the officer. \"He has escaped by the window.\"  And such had been the intention of Mark Antony Figgins.  But not being accustomed to such perilous descents, he had found himself baffled in his flight, and was now perched on a ledge, half way between the window and the ground, unable either to proceed or to return.  He was soon espied by "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20335"],["title","The Case of Edith Cavell (#0)"],["body","Case of Edith Cavell.  A Study of the Rights of Non-Combatants.

PUTNAM'S SONS, NEW YORK AND LONDON.      THE CASE OF EDITH CAVELL.  A Reply to Dr. Albert Zimmermann, Germany's Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs.  By JAMES M. BECK,  _Former Assistant Attorney-General of the United States, and Author of \"The Dual Alliance v. The Triple Entente,\" and \"The Evidence in the Case.\"_  _Mr. Beck, who is one of the leaders of the New York Bar, is the author of the most widely read article written since the war began, entitled: \"The Dual Alliance v. The Triple Entente,\" which was subsequently expanded into a book, called \"The Evidence in the Case,\" pronounced by a distinguished publicist to be \"the classic of the war.\" After its publication in THE NEW YORK TIMES this article was reprinted in nearly every language of the civilized nations and over a million copies of it were published._          *       *       *       *       *       *       *   Those who have regarded the Supreme Court of Civilization--meaning thereby the moral sentiment of the world--as a mere rhetorical phrase or an idle illusion should take note how swiftly that court--sitting now as one of criminal assize--has pronounced sentence upon the murderers of Edith Cavell. The swift vengeance of the world's opinion has called to the bar General Baron von Bissing, and in executing him with the lightning of universal execration has forever degraded him.  Baron von der Lancken may possibly escape general obloquy, for his part in the crime was no greater than that of Pilate, who sought to wash his hands of innocent blood; but von Bissing will enjoy \"until the last syllable of recorded time\" the unenviable fame of Judge Jeffreys. He, too, was an able Judge and probably believed that he was executing justice, but because he did not execute it in mercy, but with a ferocity that has made his name a synonym for judicial tyranny, the world has condemned him to lasting infamy, and this notwithstanding the fact that he was made Chief Justice of the King's Bench, Lord High Chancellor of England, and a peer of the realm. All these titles are forgotten. Only that of \"Bloody Jeffreys\" remains.  Similarly, if his master shall be pleased to honor General Baron von Bissing with the iron cross for his action in the case of Miss Cavell, as the Kaiser honored the Captain of the submarine which destroyed the Lusitania--and what order could be more appropriate in both cases than the cross, which recalls how another innocent victim of judicial tyranny was sacrificed?--then even the Order of the Iron Cross will not save von Bissing from lasting obloquy. I do not question that he acted according to his lights and shared with Dr. Albert Zimmermann great \"surprise\" that the world should make such a sensation about the murder of one woman. Trajan once said that the possession of absolute power had a tendency to transform even the most humane man into a wild beast, and Judge Black in his great argument in the case of _ex parte_ Milligan recalled the fact that Robespierre in his early life resigned his commission as Judge rather than pronounce the sentence of death, and that Caligula passed as a very amiable young man before he assumed the imperial purple. The story is as old as humanity that the appetite for blood, or at least the habit of murder, \"grows by what it feeds upon.\"  The murder of Miss Cavell was one of exceptional brutality and stupidity. It never occurred to her judges that her murder would add an army corps to the forces of the Allies and that every English soldier will fight more bravely because of her shining example. So little was this appreciated either in Brussels or Berlin that the German Foreign Office, in its official apology for the crime, issued over the signature of Herr Doctor Albert Zimmermann, Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs, expresses its surprise       _that the shooting of an Englishwoman and the condemnation of      several women in Brussels for treason have caused a sensation._  What extraordinary moral naïveté! How could they appreciate that after the firing squad had done its work and the body of the woman had been given hasty burial the victim's virtues would        \"plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against     The deep damnation of her taking off;     And pity, like a naked new-born babe,     Striding the blast, or Heaven's cherubim, horsed     Upon the sightless couriers of the air,     Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,     That tears shall drown the wind.\"  This happened with incredible rapidity, and the Kaiser made haste to respite the eight other intended victims--two of them being also women--and the Berlin Foreign Office also issued to the world its defense of its action.  It began with an expression of \"pity that Miss Cavell had to be executed,\" but the sincerity of this pity can be measured by the fact that concurrently with Dr. Zimmermann's official apology there came from Berlin an \"inspired\" supplemental explanation, which sought to depreciate the character and services of the dead nurse by stating \"that she earned a living by nursing, _charging fees within the means of the wealthy only_.\"  The world has an abundant refutation of this cruel and cowardly slur upon the memory of a dead woman, for one who first hazarded her life and then gave it freely to save the lives of others--for such was the charge for which she died--is not a woman to restrict her gracious ministrations of mercy for mercenary motives.  The Kaiser has been swift to see the deadly injury to his cause of this latest evidence of military tyranny. Not only has he respited Miss Cavell's alleged accomplices--as if to say with Macbeth, \"thou canst not say I did it\"--but it is said that he has summoned von Bissing and von der Lancken to explain their actions in the matter, but as the Kaiser is responsible for the invasion of Belgium and has hitherto condoned its attendant horrors, he can no more absolve himself from some share of responsibility than could Macbeth disavow his responsibility for the deeds of his two hirelings.  _The stain of this murder rests upon Prussian militarism and not upon the German people_, for it should not be forgotten that possibly the most chivalrous act which has happened since the beginning of the war, was the erection by a German community, where a detention camp was maintained, of a statue to the French and English soldiers who had died in captivity, with the beautiful inscription:       \"To our Comrades, who here died for their dear Fatherland.\"  What could be more chivalrous or present a greater contrast to the assassination of Miss Cavell?  We are advised by Dr. Zimmermann that Miss Cavell was given a fair trial and was justly convicted, but as the proceedings of the trial were not public and as Miss Cavell was denied knowledge in advance of the trial of the nature of the charges against her, _and as we know little of the circumstances of her alleged offense except the reports of her judges and executioners_, the world will be somewhat incredulous as to whether the trial was as just to the accused as Dr. Zimmermann would have us believe.  The difficulty with this assurance is that the German conception of what is a fair trial differs from that which prevails in Anglo-Saxon countries, just as the German word \"Gerechtigkeit\" does not convey the same mental or moral conception as the English word \"justice.\" \"Gerechtigkeit\" means little more to the Teutonic mind than the exercise of the power of the State, and claims no further sanction than its authority. In England, France, and the United States the idea of justice is that an individual has certain fundamental and inalienable rights which even the State cannot override, and none of these fundamental rights have been more highly valued in the evolution of English liberty than the rights of a defendant who is charged with crime. Whether guilty or not guilty, he cannot be arrested without a judicial warrant on proof of probable cause; he may not be compelled to testify against himself; he is entitled to a speedy trial and shall be informed in advance thereof of the exact nature of the accusation; his trial shall be public and open, and he shall be confronted with the witnesses against him and have compulsory process for his own defense; in advance of trial he shall have permission to select his own counsel, and shall have the opportunity to confer freely with him.  _Most of these fundamental rights were denied to Miss Cavell._  It is difficult to understand why, in view of the policy of terrorism, which has prevailed in Belgium from the time that the invader first crossed its frontier, the justice from the standpoint of military law should be referred to in Herr Zimmermann's defense. In the official textbook of the General Staff of the German Army the definite policy of terrorizing a conquered country is proclaimed as a military theory. Its leading axiom is that       \"a war conducted with energy cannot be directed merely against the      combatants of the enemy State and the positions they occupy, _but      it will and must in like manner seek to destroy the total      intellectual and material resources of the latter_. Humanitarian      claims, such as the protection of men and their goods, can only be      taken into consideration in so far as the nature and object of the      war permit. Consequently the argument of war permits every      belligerent State _to have recourse to all means which enable it to      obtain the object of the war_.\"  Miss Cavell's fate only differs from that of hundreds of Belgium women and children in that she had the pretense of a trial and presumably had trespassed against military law, while other victims of the rape of Belgium were ruthlessly killed in order to effect a speedy"]]]
