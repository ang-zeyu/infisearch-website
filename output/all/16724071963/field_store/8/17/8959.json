HENRY, KING.   Henry IV. died at Westminster on Monday, March 20, 1413, and Henry of Monmouth's proclamation bears date on the morrow, March 21.[1] Never perhaps was the accession of any prince to the throne of a kingdom hailed with a more general or enthusiastic welcome. If serious minds had entertained forebodings of evil from his reign, (as we         (p. 002) believe they had not,) all feelings seem to have been absorbed in one burst of gladness. Both houses of parliament offered to swear allegiance to him before he was crowned: a testimony of confidence and affection never (it is said) before tendered to any English monarch.[2] This prevalence of joyous anticipations from the accession of their young King could not have sprung from any change of conduct or of principle then first made known. Those who charge Henry most unsparingly represent his conversion as having begun only at his father's hour of dissolution. But, before that father breathed his last, the people of England were ready to welcome most heartily his son, such as he was then, without, as it should seem, either       (p. 003) hearing of, or wishing for, any change. His principles and his conduct as a ruler had been put to the test during the time he had presided at the council-board; and the people only desired in their new King a continuance of the same wisdom, valour, justice, integrity, and kind-heartedness, which had so much endeared him to the nation as their Prince. In his subjects there appears to have been room for nothing but exultation; in the new King himself widely different feelings prevailed. Ever, as it should seem, under an awful practical sense, as well of the Almighty's presence and providence and majesty, as of his own responsibility and unworthiness, Henry seems to have been suddenly oppressed by the increased solemnity and weight of the new duties which he found himself now called upon to discharge. The scene of his father's death-bed, (carried off, as that monarch was, in the very meridian of life, by a lingering loathsome disease,) and the dying injunctions of that father, may doubtless have added much to the acuteness and the depth of his feelings at that time. And whether he be deemed to have been the licentious, reckless rioter which some writers have been anxious to describe, or whether we regard him as a sincere believer, comparing his past life (though neither licentious nor reckless) with the perfectness of the divine law, the retrospect might well depress him with a consciousness of his own unworthiness, and of his total inability to perform the work which he saw        (p. 004) before him, without the strength and guidance of divine grace. For that strength and that guidance, we are assured, he prayed, and laboured, and watched with all the intenseness and perseverance of an humble faithful Christian. Those who are familiar with the expressions of a contrite soul, will fully understand the sentiments recorded of Henry of Monmouth at this season of his self-humiliation, and the dedication of himself to God, and may yet be far from discovering in them conclusive arguments in proof of his having passed his youth in habits of gross violation of religious and moral principle. We have already quoted the assertions of his biographer, that day and night he sought pardon for the past, and grace for the future, to enable him to bend his heart in faith and obedience to the Sovereign of all. And even during the splendour and rejoicings of his coronation he appeared to withdraw his mind entirely from the greatness of his worldly state, thus forced upon him, and to fix his thoughts on the King of kings.[3]                     [Footnote 1: Close Roll.]                     [Footnote 2: \"The high esteem which the nation had                    of Henry's person produced such an entire                    confidence in him, that both houses of parliament                    in an address offered to swear allegiance to him                    before he was crowned, or had taken the customary                    oath to govern according to the laws. The King                    thanked them for their good affections, and                    exhorted them in their several places and stations                    to employ all their power for the good of the                    nation. He told them that he began his reign in                    pardoning all that had offended him, and with such                    a desire for his people's happiness, that he would                    be crowned on no other condition than to make use                    of all his authority to promote it; and prayed God                    that, if he foresaw he was like to be any other                    than a just and good king, he would please to take                    him immediately out of the world, rather than seat                    him on the throne, to live a public calamity to his                    country.\"--Goodwin. See Stowe. Polyd. Verg.                    Elmham.]                     [Footnote 3: Elmham.]  But he never seems for a day to have been drawn aside by his private devotions from the full discharge of the practical duties of his new station. On the Wednesday he issued summonses for a parliament to meet within three weeks of Easter. On Friday the 7th of April, he was conducted to the Tower by a large body of men of London, who       (p. 005) went on horseback to attend him. The next day he was accompanied back to Westminster, with every demonstration of loyalty and devotedness to his person, by a great concourse of lords and knights, many of whom he had created on the preceding evening. On the following morning, being Passion Sunday, April 9th,[4] he was crowned with much[5] magnificence in Westminster Abbey.[6]                     [Footnote 4: Not Palm Sunday, but the fifth Sunday                    in Lent, was called Passion Sunday.]                     [Footnote 5: \"With mickle royalty.\"--Chron. Lond.]                     [Footnote 6: Chroniclers record that the day of his                    coronation was a day of storm and tempest, frost                    and snow, and that various omens of ill portent                    arose from the circumstance.]  One of the first acts of a sovereign in England at that time was to re-appoint the judges who were in office at the demise of his predecessor, or to constitute new ones in their stead. Among other changes, we find Hankford appointed as Chief Justice in the room of Gascoyne, at least within ten days of the King's accession. For any observation which this fact may suggest, so contrary to those histories which repeat tales instead of seeking for the truth in ancient records, we must refer to the chapter in which we have already examined the credibility of the alleged insult offered by Prince Henry to a Judge on the bench of justice.[7]                     [Footnote 7: Henry had excited feelings of                    confidence and admiration in the minds of foreign                    potentates, as well as in his subjects at home.                    Among the embassies, with offers and pledges of                    friendship and amity, which hastened to his court                    on his accession, are numbered those of John of                    Portugal, Robert Duke of Albany, Regent of                    Scotland, John King of Castile, John Duke of                    Brittany, Charles King of France, and Pope John                    XXIII.]  The first parliament of Henry V. met in the Painted Chamber        (p. 006) at Westminster, on Monday, 15th of May. The King was on his throne; but the Bishop of Winchester, his uncle, then Chancellor of England, opened the business of the session. On this, as on many similar occasions, the chancellor, generally a prelate, addressed the assembled states in an oration, half speech and half sermon, upon a passage of Scripture selected as a text. On the opening of this parliament, the chancellor informed the peers and the commons that the King's purpose in calling them together as the Great Council of the nation was threefold:--First, he was desirous of supporting the throne,--\"his high and royal estate;\" secondly, he was bent on maintaining the law and good government within his realm; and thirdly, he desired to cherish the friends and to resist the enemies of his kingdom. It is remarkable that no mention is made in this parliament at all on the part of the King, or his chancellor, of either heresy or Lollardism. The speaker refers to some tumults, especially at"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20489"],["title","Henry of Monmouth, Volume 2 (#2)"],["body","ster, where the populace appear to have attacked the abbey; complaints also were made against the conduct of ordinaries, and some strong enactments were passed against the usurpations of Rome,     (p. 007) to which reference will again be made: but not a word in answer to these complaints would lead to the inference that the spirit of persecution was then in the ascendant. It was not till the last day of April 1414, after the affair of St. Giles' Field, that the statute against the Lollards was passed at Leicester.[8] The chancellor at that subsequent period speaks of their treasonable designs to destroy the King having been lately discovered and discomfited; and the record expressly declares that the ordinance was made with the consent and at the prayer of the commons.                     [Footnote 8: Sir Edward Coke, in his 4th Inst. ch.                    i. declares that this act was disavowed in the next                    parliament by the Commons, for that they never                    assented. The Author has searched the Parliament                    Rolls in vain for the authority on which that                    assertion was founded.]  But though neither the King nor his council gave any indication, in his first parliament, of a desire to interfere with men's consciences in matters of religion, the churchmen were by no means slumbering at their post. Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury, convened a council of the bishops and clergy, who met by adjournment, in full numbers, at St. Paul's, on the 26th of June 1413;[9] and adopted most rigorous measures for the extirpation of heresy, levelled professedly with a more especial aim against the ringleader of Lollardism, as he      (p. 008) was called, the valiant and unfortunate Lord Cobham. On these proceedings we purpose to dwell separately in another part of this work; and, in addition to what we shall there allege, little needs be observed here by way of anticipation. In leaving the subject, however, as far as Henry V.'s character is concerned, it may not be out of place to remark, that historical facts, so far from stamping on him the mark of a religious persecutor, prove that it required all the united efforts of the clergy and laity to induce him to put the existing laws in force against those who were bold enough to dissent from the Romish faith. So far from his \"having watched the Lollards as his greatest enemies,\" so far from \"having listened to every calumny which the zeal and hatred of the hierarchy could invent or propagate against the unfortunate followers of Wickliff,\" (the conduct and disposition ascribed to him by Milner,) we have sufficient proof of the dissatisfaction of the church with him in this respect; and their repeated attempts to excite him to more vigorous measures against the rising and spreading sect. By a minute of council, May 27, 1415, we find that, whilst preparing for his expedition to France, he is reminded to instruct the archbishops and bishops to take measures, each within his respective diocese, to resist the malice of the Lollards. The King merely answered, that he had given the subject in charge to his chancellor; and we are assured that Dr. Thomas       (p. 009) Walden,[10] one of the most learned and powerful divines of the day, but very violent in his opposition to the new doctrines, openly inveighed against Henry _for his great negligence in regard to the duty of punishing heretics_.[11] To his religious sentiments we must again refer in the sequel, and also as the course of events may successively suggest any observations on that head.                     [Footnote 9: The Monday after Corpus Christi day;                    which feast, being the Thursday after Trinity                    Sunday, fell in the year 1413 on June 22.]                     [Footnote 10: This Dr. Walden (so called from the                    place of his birth in Essex) was so able a                    disputant that he was called the Netter. He seems                    to have written many works, which are either                    totally lost, or are buried in temporary oblivion.]                     [Footnote 11: Goodwin. Appendix, p. 361.]  When Henry IV. ascended the throne, parliament prayed that the Prince might not leave the realm, but remain in England as the anchor of the people's hopes; and, soon after his own accession,[12] Henry V. is advised by his council to remain near London, that he might receive prompt intelligence of whatever might arise in any quarter, and be able to take immediate steps for the safety of the commonweal. He seems to have carried with him even from his earliest youth, wherever he went, a peculiar talent of exciting confidence in every one. Whether in the field of battle, or the chamber of council,--whether as the young Prince, just initiated in affairs of war and government, or as the experienced captain and statesman,--his contemporaries looked to him as a kind of guardian spirit, to protect them from          (p. 010) harm, and lead them onward to good success. No despondency, nor even misgivings, show themselves in the agents of any enterprise in which he was personally engaged. The prodigious effects of these feelings in the English towards their prince were displayed in their full strength, perhaps, at the battle of Agincourt; but similar results are equally, though not so strikingly, visible in many other passages of his life.                     [Footnote 12: Minutes of Council, 29 June 1413.]  Among the various causes to which historians have been accustomed to attribute the general anticipations of good from Henry's reign, which pervaded all classes, is the appointment of Gascoyne to the high station of Chief Justice immediately upon his ascending the throne. But we have already seen that, however gladly an eulogist would seize on such an exalted instance of magnanimity and noble generosity, the truth of history forbids our even admitting its probability in this place. Henry certainly did not re-appoint Gascoyne. But, whilst we cannot admit the tradition which would mark the true character of Henry's mind by his behaviour to the Chief Justice, there is not wanting many an authentic record which would amply account for his almost unprecedented popularity at the very commencement of his reign. Among these we must not omit to notice the resolution which he put in practice of retiring for an hour or more every day, after his early dinner, to receive petitions from any of his subjects, however     (p. 011) humble,[13] who would appeal to him for his royal interposition; to examine and consider the several cases patiently; and to redress real grievances. Indeed, numberless little occurrences meet us on every side, which seem to indicate very clearly that he loved the right and hated iniquity; and that he was never more happy than whilst engaged in deeds of justice, mercy, and charity. He seems to have received the golden law for his rule, \"See that they who are in need and necessity have right;\" and to have rejoiced in keeping that    (p. 012) law himself, and compelling all within the sphere of his authority and influence to observe it also.                     [Footnote 13: Many original petitions addressed to                    Henry are still preserved among our records. In                    one, which may serve as a specimen of the kind of                    application to which this custom compelled him to                    open his ear, Richard Hunt appeals to him as a                    \"right merciable lord, moved with pity, mercy, and                    grace.\" \"In great desolation and heaviness of                    heart,\" the petitioner states that his son-in-law,                    Richard Peke, who had a wife and four children, and                    had been all his life a true labourer and innocent                    man, and well-beloved by his neighbours, had been                    detected in taking from a vessel goods not worth                    three shillings; for which crime his mortal enemies                    (though they might have their property again) \"sued                    to have him dead.\" He urges Henry to grant him                    \"full noble grace,\" at the reverence of Almighty                    God, and for passion that Christ suffered for all                    mankind, and for the pity that he had on Mary                    Magdalene. The petitioner then promised (as                    petitioners now do) to pray for endless mercy on                    Henry; he adds, moreover, what would certainly                    sound strange in a modern petition to a monarch,                    \"And ye, gracious and sovereign lord, shall have a                    good ox to your larder.\" Henry granted the                    petition. \"The King woll that this bill pass                    without any manner of fine, or fees that longeth to                    him.\"]  Another incident recorded of Henry of Monmouth at this period, strongly marking the kindness and generosity and nobleness of his mind, was the removal of the remains of Richard II. from Langley to Westminster. Without implying any consciousness, or even suspicion of guilt, on the part of his father as to Richard's death, we may easily suppose Henry to have regarded the deposition of that monarch as an act of violence, justifiable only on the ground of extreme necessity: he might have considered him as an injured man, by whose fall his father and himself had been raised to the throne. Instead of allowing his name and his mortal remains to be buried in oblivion, (with the chance moreover of raising again in men's minds fresh doubts and surmises of his own title to the throne, for he was not Richard's right heir,) Henry resolved to pay all the respect in his power to the memory of the friend of his youth, and by the only means at his command to make a sort of reparation for the indignities to which"]]]
