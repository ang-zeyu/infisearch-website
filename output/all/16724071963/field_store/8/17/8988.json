Where?  For what purpose?  The dumb, wrathful, insubordinate, despairful army indeed moved at the will of its master, but largely because it realized that it could not stay where it was, and largely because it was better to move on and die than to lie down and die.  They were at least warmer on the march!  The spirit of the guard and of the subordinate officers, say from the colonels down, was good enough, but the generals and the marshals were sick of fighting.  They had had enough of it.  They had gained all that they could gain in their world-wide campaigns, in fame, money, titles, estates.  They had everything to lose and nothing to win.  They wanted rest, an opportunity to enjoy.  Some of them were devoted to the Emperor, in fact, all of them were, but their own comfort and self-interest bulked larger and larger before them.  They saw nothing but defeat at the end of their endeavors, and they wanted to negotiate peace with such honor as could be had while they were still a force to be reckoned with.  Their unwillingness and mutinous spirit, however, had not yet reached its highest development.  That came later, and brought treachery in its train.  The awful will of the Emperor still overruled them. Wrathfully, insubordinately, protestingly, they still marched when he gave the word.  The Emperor had been working with that furious concentration which he alone of all men seemed to be able to bring about, and which was one of the secrets of his power.  Orders borne by couriers had streamed in all directions over the roads.  Napoleon was about to undertake the most daring and marvelous campaign of his whole history.  The stimulus of despair, the certainty of ruin unless the advance of the allies could be stayed, had at last awakened his dormant energies, filled his veins with the fire of youth and spring.  With that comprehensive eye which made him the master of battlefields and nations he had forseen everything.  Soldiers were coming from Spain.  He had given instructions to magnify their number and their strength.  He shrewdly surmised that their appearance on the left flank would cause the cautious Schwarzenberg to pause, to withdraw his flankers, to mass to meet them.  There would be a halt in the advance. The allies still feared the Emperor.  Although much of his prestige was gone, they never made little of Napoleon.  He intended to leave some of the best troops to confront Schwarzenberg between Nogent and Montereau, under Victor and Oudinot, hard fighters both, with instructions not to engage in any decisive battle, not to allow themselves to be trapped into that, but to stand on the defensive, to hold the River Seine, to retreat foot by foot, if pressed, to take advantage of every cover, to hold the enemy in check, to contest every foot of the way, to assume a strength which they did not have.  He promised that so soon as he had fallen upon Blücher he would send the news and see that it got to Schwarzenberg and the allied monarchs who were with him.  Reverses which he hoped to inflict on the Prussian Field Marshal would increase the Austrian hesitation.  The Emperor believed that the pressure by Oudinot and Victor would be effective. They would draw in their columns and concentrate.  After he had finished with Blücher and his army, he intended to retrace his steps and do the same thing with Schwarzenberg.  Of course, if he failed with Blücher it was all over.  He was the last hope of France--he and his army.  If his magnificent dash at the Prussians and Russians was not successful, nothing could delay the end.  Napoleon was staking all on the throw, taking the gambler's chance, taking it recklessly, accepting the hazard, but neglecting no means to insure the winning of the game.  The Emperor flung a screen of cavalry in front of Marmont, to patrol every village, to control every farmhouse, to see that no news of his advance came to the unsuspecting old Prussian.  And then he himself stayed back in Nogent to see his own orders carried out.  He personally inspected every division, as it marched to the front through the waning night, the cheerless dawn, the gray dark day.  It cut him to the heart to see his soldiers go so silently and so sullenly.  Here and there a regiment did cry: \"_Vive l'Empereur_\"; here and there a voice sounded it, but in the main the men marched dumbly, doggedly.  It was only the old guard that gave him the imperial salute in full voice in the old way.  Nothing indicated to the Emperor more thoroughly the temper of the soldiers than that open indifference.  Why, even in Russia, ere their stiffened lips froze into silence, they had breathed out the old acclaim.  The Emperor remembered that grenadier who, when told by the surgeon that he feared to probe for a ball that had pierced his breast because he did not know what he would find, \"If you probe deep enough to reach my heart,\" said the soldier with his dying breath, \"you will find the Emperor.\"  Grave-faced and frowning, shivering from time to time in the fierce, raw cold, the Emperor watched the troops march by.  Well, the day after to-morrow, if there were any left, they would acclaim him loud enough. The Emperor was cold and cynical.  He had never allowed the life of men to stand in the way of his desires, but even his iron nerve, his icy indifference had been shaken.  He gave no outward evidence of it, but in his heart he realized more plainly than ever before that when these were gone there were no more.  And so, perhaps, his shudder was not altogether due to the cold.  Whatever his emotions, he steeled his heart, he made his preparations for the last try with fortune, the last card to be played, the last die to be thrown.  What would be the end of it?  What would be the result of that final desperate game?  The Emperor was a master player--could even his finesse and skill and talent and genius make up for the poor hand that had been dealt him because the pack had been so drawn upon that the good cards had been exhausted, used up, long since?  Did the Emperor realize that even he was not what he had been?  Did he comprehend that he was no longer the soldier, the man, of the past? Did he realize that at last he had tried the patience of that fortune he had worshiped, beyond the limit; and that whatever favor might be vouchsafed him would only delay the end?  The boys might march and fight, the old guard might sustain its ancient fame, the genius of the Emperor might flash out in full effulgence once more--and it would make no difference.  The stars on their courses fought against Sisera.  The doom sentence was written.  Postponement he might look forward to, but no final stay of judgment!  A few thousand more lives he might throw away, but these late sacrifices would avail nothing.  Oh, no; the Emperor's shudder was not altogether due to the cold that winter morning.     CHAPTER IV  MARTEAU AND BAL-ARRÊT RIDE  Of this young Marteau and old Bullet Stopper, plodding along at the best speed they could get from their horses, knew nothing.  The old grenadier was laconic by nature, and his habit of silence had become intensified by his years of subordination and service.  The young officer was wrapped in his own thoughts.  Knowing, as they did, every foot of the way, the two were able to find short cuts, take advantage of narrow paths over the hills and through the woods, which would have offered no passage to the army, even if they had been aware of it. They reached Sézanne hours before Marmont's advance, long before the cavalry even.  Baiting their horses, and getting a welcome meal at the inn--the town itself had as yet suffered nothing from the ravages of the Cossacks, being too strong for raiding parties--and refusing to answer questions, and paying no attention to wondering looks of the inhabitants, they rode out again.  Their way through the marshes of St. Gond was dreadful.  If only the weather would change, the ground would freeze, how welcome would be the altered conditions.  But the half snow, the half rain, still beat down upon them.  Their poor beasts were almost exhausted.  They broke the ice of the Grand Morin river to get water for the horses and themselves, and, not daring to kindle a fire, for they were approaching the country occupied by Blücher, they made a scanty meal from their haversacks.  They had found the farmhouses and châteaux deserted, evidences of hasty flight and plunder on every side.  The Cossacks had swept through the land beyond the town.  The people who could had fled to Sézanne, or had gone westward hurriedly, to escape the raiders.  In the ruined villages and farms they came across many dead bodies of old women, old men and children, with here and there a younger woman whose awful fate filled the old soldier and the young alike with grim and passionate rage.  \"Yonder,\" said Marteau, gloomily pointing westward through the darkness, \"lies Aumenier and my father's house.\"  \"And mine,\" added Bullet-Stopper.  There was no need to express the thought further, to dilate upon it. It had been the Emperor's maxim that war should support war.  His armies had lived off the country.  The enemy had taken a leaf out of his own book.  Even the stupid could not fight forever against Napoleon without learning something.  The allies ate up the land, ravaged it, turned it into a desert--_lex talionis_!  Marteau's father still lived, with his younger sister.  Old Bullet-Stopper was alone in the world but for his friends.  What had happened in that little village yonder?  What was going on in the great château, so long closed, now finally abandoned by the proud royalist family which had owned it and had owned Marteau and old Bullet-Stopper, and all the rest of the villagers, for that matter, for eight hundred years, or until the revolution had set them free?  Plunged in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20515"],["title","The Eagle of the Empire: A Story of Waterloo (#6)"],["body","gloomy thoughts the young officer involuntarily took a step in the direction of that village.  \"On the Emperor's service,\" said the grenadier sternly, catching his young comrade by the arm.  \"Later,\" he continued, \"we may go.\"  \"You're right,\" said Marteau.  \"Let us move on.\"  Whether it was because the roads really were in a worse condition because of that fact that they ran through marshy country, or whether it was because the men were worn out and their horses more so, they made the slowest progress of the day.  They plodded on determinedly through the night.  The two weaker horses of the four finally gave way under the strain.  Husbanding the remaining two with the greatest care, the two soldiers, passing through the deserted villages of St. Prix, on the Little Morin, and Baye, finally reached the great highroad which ran through Champaubert, Vauxchamps and Montmirail, toward Paris, and which, owing to a northward bend of the river, crossed the country some leagues to the southward of the Marne.  Day was breaking as they reached the edge of the forest bordering the road, and from a rather high hill had a glimpse of a wide stretch of country before them.  Fortunately, while it was still raw and cold, the sun came out and gave them a fair view of a great expanse of rolling and open fields.  A scene of great animation was disclosed to them. The road was covered with squadrons of green-coated Russian cavalry, evidently just called to the saddle, and moving eastward at a walk or slow trot.  They looked like the advance guard of some important division.  There was a low, rolling volume of heavy sound coming from the far north, and in the rising sun they thought they could distinguish in that direction smoke, as from a battlefield.  The sound itself was unmistakable to the veteran.  \"Cannon!\" he said.  \"Fighting there.\"  \"Yes,\" answered Marteau.  \"The Emperor said that the Prussians and Russians were pressing the Duke of Tarentum, Marshal Macdonald.\"  \"But what have we here?\" asked old Bal-Arrêt, shading his eyes and peering at the array on the near road.  A division of Russians, coming from a defile to the right, had debouched upon a broad plateau or level upon the edge of which the little village of Champaubert straggled forlornly.  The Cossack horsemen and the Russian cavalry had cleaned out Champaubert.  There were no inhabitants left to welcome the Russian division, except dead ones, who could offer no hospitality.  The division was weary and travel-stained, covered with mud, horses dead beat; the cannon, huge, formless masses of clay, were dragged slowly and painfully forward.  It was evident that the commander of the division had doubled his teams, but the heavy guns could scarcely be moved, even by twice the number of horses attached.  The poor brutes had no rest, for, as fast as one gun arrived, both teams were unhitched and sent over the road to bring up another.  A halt was made on the plateau.  It was evident to the experienced eyes of the watchers that a camp was about to be pitched.  The two men stared in keen interest, with eyes alight with hatred.  What they had seen in the country they had just passed intensified that hatred, and to the natural racial antagonism, fostered by years of war, were now added bitter personal resentments.  \"That's one of old Marshal Forward's divisions,\" said the grenadier, referring to Blücher by his already accepted name, \"but what one?\"  \"Russians, by the look of them,\" answered Marteau.  \"You say well.  I have seen those green caps and green overcoats before.  Umph,\" answered Bullet-Stopper, making for him an extraordinarily long speech, \"it was colder then than it is now, but we always beat them.  At Friedland, at Eylau, at Borodino, aye, even at the Beresina.  It was the cold and hunger that beat us.  What wouldn't the guard give to be where we are now.  Look at them.  They are so sure of themselves that they haven't thrown out a picket or sentries.\"  In fact, neither Blücher nor any of his commanders apprehended any danger whatsoever.  That Napoleon would dare to fall on them was unthinkable.  That there could be a single French soldier in their vicinity save those under Macdonald, being hard pressed by Yorck, never entered anybody's head.  \"What Russians are they, do you think?\" asked Marteau of his comrade.  \"How should I know?\" growled the other.  \"All Russians are alike to me, and----\"  Marteau, however, had heard discussions during the time he had been on duty in Napoleon's headquarters.  \"That will be Sacken's corps, unless I am very much mistaken,\" he said.  \"And those up yonder toward Épernay, where the firing comes from?\" asked the grenadier.  Marteau shook his head.  \"We must find out,\" was the answer.  \"Yes, but how?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"There is only one way,\" continued Bal-Arrêt.  \"And that is?\"  \"To go over there, and----\"  \"In these uniforms?\" observed the young officer.  \"We should be shot as soon as we should appear, and questioned afterward.\"  \"Yes, if there was anything left to question,\" growled the grenadier. \"The Russians will do some scouting.  Perhaps some of them will come here.  If so, we will knock them on the head and take their uniforms, wait until nightfall, slip through the lines, find out what we can, and go back and tell the Emperor.  It is very simple.\"  \"Quite so,\" laughed the young officer; \"if we can catch two Russians, if their uniforms will fit us, if we can get through, if we can find out, if we can get back.  Do you speak Russian, Bal-Arrêt?\"  \"Not a word.\"  \"Prussian?\"  \"Enough to pass myself through I guess, and----\"  \"Hush,\" said the young man, as three Russians suddenly appeared out of a little ravine on the edge of the wood.  They had come on a foraging expedition, and had been successful, apparently, for, tied to a musket and carried between two of the men was a dead pig.  How it had escaped the Cossack raiders of the day before was a mystery.  They were apparently coming farther into the forest for firewood with which to roast the animal.  Perhaps, as the pig was small, and, as they were doubtless hungry, they did not wish their capture to be widely known.  At any rate, they came cautiously up a ravine and had not been noticed until their heads rose above it. They saw the two Frenchmen just about as soon as they were seen.  The third man, whose arms were free, immediately presented his piece and pulled the trigger.  Fortunately it missed fire.  If it had gone off it might have attracted the attention of the Russian outposts, investigations would have been instituted, and all chance of passing the lines there would have been over.  At the same time he pulled the trigger he fell like a log.  The grenadier, who had thrust into his belt a heavy knife, picked up from some murdered woodsman on the journey, had drawn it, seized it by the blade, and, with a skill born of olden peasant days, had hurled it at the Russian.  The blade struck the man fairly in the face, and the sharp weapon plunged into the man to the hilt.  He threw up his hands, his gun dropped, he crashed down into the ravine stone dead.  The next second the two Frenchmen had seized the two Russians.  The latter were taken at a disadvantage.  They had retained their clutch on the gun-sling carrying the pig, and, before they realized what was toward--they were slow thinkers both--a pair of hands was clasped around each throat.  The Russians were big men, and they struggled hard.  A silent, terrible battle was waged under the trees, but, try as they would, the Russians could not get release from the terrible grasp of the Frenchmen.  The breath left their bodies, their eyes protruded, their faces turned black.  Marteau suddenly released his prisoner, who dropped heavily to the ground.  To bind him with his own breast and gun straps and belt was a work of a few moments.  When he had finished he tore a piece of cloth from the coat of the soldier and thrust it into his mouth to gag him. The grenadier had a harder time with his enemy, who was the bigger of the two men, but he, too, mastered him, and presently both prisoners lay helpless, bound and gagged.  The two Frenchmen rose and stared at each other, a merry twinkle in the eyes of old Bullet-Stopper, a very puzzled expression in those of the young soldier.  \"Well, here's our disguise,\" said the old soldier.  \"Quite so,\" interposed the officer.  \"But what shall we do with these two?\"  \"Nothing simpler.  Knock them in the head after we have found out what we can from them, and----\"  But Marteau shook his head.  \"I can't murder helpless prisoners,\" he said decisively.  \"If you had seen what they did to us in Russia you wouldn't have any hesitation on that score,\" growled the grenadier.  \"I had comrades whom they stripped naked and turned loose in the snow.  Some of them they buried alive, some they gave to the wolves, some they burned to death. I have no more feeling for them than I have for reptiles or devils.\"  \"I can't do it,\" said the younger soldier stubbornly.  \"We must think of some other way.\"  Old Bullet-Stopper stood frowning, trying to think of some argument by which to overcome these foolish scruples, when an idea came to his friend.  \"About half a mile back we passed a deserted house.  Let's take them there and leave them.  There will probably be ropes or straps.  We can bind them.  They will be sheltered and perhaps somebody may come along and release them.\"  \"Yes, doubtless somebody will,\" said the grenadier gravely, thinking that if somebody proved to be a peasant their release would be an eternal one, and glad in the thought.  \"Very well, you are in command. Give your order.\"  At Marteau's direction the straps around the feet of the men were loosened, they were compelled to get up; they had been disarmed, of course, and by signs they were made to march in the required direction. Casting a backward glance over the encampment, to see whether the absence of the three had been noticed, and,"]]]
