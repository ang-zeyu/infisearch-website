WHILST the celebrated Mr. Dunning, afterwards Lord Ashburton, was at the bar, he by his conduct did much to support the character and dignity of a barrister, which was frequently disregarded by Lord Mansfield, at that time Chief Justice. The attempts of the Chief Justice to brow-beat the counsel were on many occasions kept in check by the manly and dignified conduct of Mr. Dunning. Lord Mansfield possessed great quickness in discovering the gist of a cause, and having done so, used to amuse himself by taking up a book or a newspaper, whilst counsel was addressing the court. Whenever Mr. Dunning was speaking, and his Lordship seemed thus to hold his argument as of no consequence, the advocate would stop suddenly in his address, and on his Lordship observing, \"Pray go on, Mr. Dunning,\" he would reply, \"I beg your pardon, my Lord, but I fear I shall interrupt your Lordship's _more important_ occupations. I will wait until your Lordship has leisure to attend to my client and his humble advocate.\"           CLXXV.--EPIGRAM.  (A good word for Ministers.)      THE Whigs 'tis said have often broke     Their promises which end in smoke;       Thus their defence I build;     Granted in office they have slept,     Yet sure those _promises_ are _kept_       Which never are fulfilled.           CLXXVI.--CHANGING HIS LINE.  A GENTLEMAN, inquiring of Jack Bannister respecting a man who had been hanged, was told that he was dead. \"And did he continue in the _grocery line_?\" said the former. \"Oh no,\" replied Jack; \"he was quite in a _different line_ when he died.\"           CLXXVII.--TALL AND SHORT.  AT an evening party, Jerrold was looking at the dancers. Seeing a very tall gentleman waltzing with a remarkably short lady, he said to a friend at hand, \"Humph! there's the mile dancing with the mile-stone.\"           CLXXVIII.--AN ODD COMPARISON.  SIR WILLIAM B---- being at a parish meeting, made some proposals, which were objected to by a farmer. Highly enraged, \"Sir,\" says he to the farmer, \"do you know, sir, that I have been at the two universities, and at two colleges in each university?\"--\"Well, sir,\" said the farmer, \"what of that? I had a calf that sucked two cows, and the observation I made was, the more he sucked, the greater _calf_ he grew.\"           CLXXIX.--ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  IT was said of one that remembered everything that he lent, but nothing that he borrowed, \"that he had _lost half_ of his memory.\"           CLXXX.--CAUSE OF ABSENCE.  WHEN the late Lord Campbell married Miss Scarlett, and departed on his wedding trip, Mr. Justice Abbott observed, when a cause was called on in the Bench, \"I thought, Mr. Brougham, that Mr. Campbell was in this case?\"--\"Yes, my lord,\" replied Brougham, \"but I understand he is ill--suffering from _Scarlett fever_.\"           CLXXXI.--THE SCOLD'S VOCABULARY.  THE copiousness of the English language perhaps was never more apparent than in the following character, by a lady, of her own husband:--  \"He is,\" says she, \"an abhorred, barbarous, capricious, detestable, envious, fastidious, hard-hearted, illiberal, ill-natured, jealous, keen, loathsome, malevolent, nauseous, obstinate, passionate, quarrelsome, raging, saucy, tantalizing, uncomfortable, vexatious, abominable, bitter, captious, disagreeable, execrable, fierce, grating, gross, hasty, malicious, nefarious, obstreperous, peevish, restless, savage, tart, unpleasant, violent, waspish, worrying, acrimonious, blustering, careless, discontented, fretful, growling, hateful, inattentive, malignant, noisy, odious, perverse, rigid, severe, teasing, unsuitable, angry, boisterous, choleric, disgusting, gruff, hectoring, incorrigible, mischievous, negligent, offensive, pettish, roaring, sharp, sluggish, snapping, snarling, sneaking, sour, testy, tiresome, tormenting, touchy, arrogant, austere, awkward, boorish, brawling, brutal, bullying, churlish, clamorous, crabbed, cross, currish, dismal, dull, dry, drowsy, grumbling, horrid, huffish, insolent, intractable, irascible, ireful, morose, murmuring, opinionated, oppressive, outrageous, overbearing, petulant, plaguy, rough, rude, rugged, spiteful, splenetic, stern, stubborn, stupid, sulky, sullen, surly, suspicious, treacherous, troublesome, turbulent, tyrannical, virulent, wrangling, yelping dog-in-a-manger.\"           CLXXXII.--A FAMILIAR ILLUSTRATION.  A MEDICAL student under examination, being asked the different effects of heat and cold, replied: \"Heat expands and cold contracts.\"--\"Quite right; can you give me an example?\"--\"Yes, sir, in summer, which is hot, the days are longer; but in winter, which is _cold_, the days are _shorter_.\"           CLXXXIII.--HAPPINESS.  HAPPINESS grows at our own firesides, and is not to be picked in strangers' gardens.           CLXXXIV.--TRANSPOSING A COMPLIMENT.  IT was said of a work (which had been inspected by a severe critic), in terms which at first appeared very flattering, \"There is a great deal in this book which is new, and a great deal that is true.\" So far good, the author would think; but then came the negation: \"But it unfortunately happens, that those portions which are _new_ are not _true_, and those which are _true_ are not _new_!\"           CLXXXV.--A HANDSOME CONTRIBUTION.  A GENTLEMAN waited upon Jerrold one morning to enlist his sympathies in behalf of a mutual friend, who was constantly in want of a round sum of money.  \"Well,\" said Jerrold, who had contributed on former occasions, \"how much does ---- want this time?\"  \"Why, just a four and two noughts will, I think, put him straight,\" the bearer of the hat replied.  _Jerrold._--\"Well, put me down for one of the noughts this time.\"           CLXXXVI.--WASTE OF TIME.  AN old man of ninety having recovered from a very dangerous illness, his friends congratulated him, and encouraged him to get up. \"Alas!\" said he to them, \"it is hardly worth while to _dress_ myself again.\"           CLXXXVII.--SCOTCH SIMPLICITY.  AT Hawick, the people used to wear wooden clogs, which made a _clanking_ noise on the pavement. A dying old woman had some friends by her bedside, who said to her, \"Weel, Jenny, ye are gaun to Heeven, an' gin you should see our folks, ye can tell them that we're a weel.\" To which Jenny replied. \"Weel, gin I shud see them I 'se tell them, but you manna expect that I am to gang clank clanking through Heeven looking for your folk.\"           CLXXXVIII.--TWOFOLD ILLUSTRATION.  SIR FLETCHER NORTON was noted for his want of courtesy. When pleading before Lord Mansfield on some question of manorial right, he chanced unfortunately to say, \"My lord, I can illustrate the point in an instant in my own person: I myself have two little manors.\" The judge immediately interposed, with one of his blandest smiles, \"We all _know_ it, Sir Fletcher.\"           CLXXXIX.--NAT LEE AND SIR ROGER L'ESTRANGE.  THE author of \"Alexander the Great,\" whilst confined in a madhouse, was visited by Sir Roger L'Estrange, of whose political abilities Lee entertained no very high opinion. Upon the knight inquiring whether the poet knew him, Lee answered:--      \"Custom may alter men, and manners change:     But I am still _strange Lee_, and you L'Estrange:     I'm poor in purse as you are poor in brains.\"           CXC.--MAIDS AND WIVES.  WOMEN are all alike. When they're maids they're mild as milk: once make 'em wives, and they lean their backs against their marriage certificates, and defy you.--D.J.           CXCI.--TRAGEDY MS.  LISTON, seeing a parcel lying on the table in the entrance-hall of Drury Lane Theatre, one side of which, from its having travelled to town by the side of some game, was smeared with blood, observed, \"That parcel contains a manuscript tragedy.\" And on being asked why, replied, \"Because the _fifth_ act is peeping out at one corner of it.\"           CXCII.--A TRUE COURTIER.  ONE day, when Sir Isaac Heard was in company with George III., it was announced that his majesty's horse was ready for hunting. \"Sir Isaac,\" said the king, \"are you a judge of horses?\"--\"In my younger days, please your majesty, I was a great deal among them,\" was the reply. \"What do you think of this, then?\" said the king, who was by this time preparing to mount his favorite: and, without waiting for an answer, added, \"we call him. _Perfection_.\"--\"A most appropriate name,\" replied the courtly herald, bowing as his majesty reached the saddle, \"for he _bears_ the best of characters.\"           CXCIII.--RARE VIRTUE.  THE paucity of some persons' good actions reminds one of Jonathan Wild, who was once induced to be guilty of a good action, after fully satisfying himself, upon the maturest deliberation, that he could _gain nothing_ by refraining from it.           CXCIV.--A POSER.  A COXCOMB in a coffee-house boasted that he had written a certain popular song, just as the true author entered the room. A friend of his pointed to the coxcomb: \"See, sir, the real author of your favorite song.\"--\"Well,\" replied the other, \"the gentleman _might_ have made it, for I assure him I found no difficulty in doing it myself.\"           CXCV.--A SHEEPISH COMPLIMENT.  LORD COCKBURN, the proprietor of Bonaly, was sitting on the hillside with a shepherd, and, observing the sheep reposing in the coldest situation, he remarked to him, \"John, if I were a sheep, I would lie on the other side of the hill.\" The shepherd answered, \"Ah, my lord, but if ye had been a _sheep_ ye would hae had mair sense.\"           CXCVI.--CONSIDERABLE LATITUDE.  SIR RICHARD JEBB being called to see a patient who fancied himself very ill, told him ingenuously what he thought, and declined prescribing for him. \"Now you are here,\" said the patient, \"I shall be obliged to you, Sir Richard, if you will"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20352"],["title","The Jest Book (#8)"],["body"," me how I must live; what I may eat, and what I may not.\"--\"My directions as to that point,\" replied Sir Richard, \"will be few and simple! You must not eat the poker, shovel, or tongs, for they are hard of digestion; nor the bellows, because they are _windy_; but eat anything else you please!\"           CXCVII.--FARMER AND ATTORNEY.  AN opulent farmer applied to an attorney about a lawsuit, but was told he could not undertake it, being already engaged on the other side; at the same time he gave him a letter of recommendation to a professional friend. The farmer, out of curiosity, opened it, and read as follows:--      \"Here are two fat wethers fallen out together,     If you'll fleece one, I'll fleece the other,     And make 'em agree like brother and brother.\"  The perusal of this epistle cured both parties, and terminated the dispute.           CXCVIII.--A WIFE AT FORTY.  \"MY notion of a wife at forty,\" said Jerrold, \"is, that a man should be able to change her, like a bank-note, for two twenties.\"           CXCIX.--DISAPPROBATION.  AN actor played a season at Richmond theatre for the privilege only of having a benefit. When his night came, and having to sustain a principal part in the piece, the whole of his audience (thirty in number), hissed him whenever he appeared. When the piece ended, he came forward and said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, I return you my sincere thanks for your kindness, but when you mean to hiss me again on my benefit night, I hope you will be at least _six times_ as many as are here to-night.\"           CC.--NOVEL OFFENCE.  COOKE and Dibdin went, at a tolerably steady quick-step, as far as the middle of Greek Street, when Cooke, who had passed his hand along all the palisades and shutters as he marched, came in contact with the recently-painted new front of a coachmaker's shop, from which he obtained a complete handful of wet color. Without any explanation as to the cause of his anger, he rushed suddenly into the middle of the street, and raised a stone to hurl against the unoffending windows; but Dibdin was in time to save them from destruction, and him from the watch-house. On being asked the cause of his hostility to the premises of a man who could not have offended him, he replied, with a hiccup, \"what! not offend? A ---- ignorant coachmaker, to leave his _house out_, new-painted, at this time of night!\"           CCI.--MEASURING HIS DISTANCE.  A BROWBEATING counsel asked a witness how far he had been from a certain place. \"Just four yards, two feet, and six inches,\" was the reply. \"How came you to be so exact, my friend?\"--\"Because I expected _some fool_ or other would ask me, and so I measured it.\"           CCII.--VERY CLEAR.  \"WHAT is light?\" asked a schoolmaster of the booby of a class. \"A sovereign that isn't full weight is light,\" was the prompt reply.           CCIII.--BROTHERLY LOVE.  \"AH!\" said a conceited young parson, \"I have this afternoon been preaching to a congregation of asses.\"--\"Then that was the reason why you always called them _beloved brethren_,\" replied a strong-minded lady.           CCIV.--EPIGRAM.      BY a friend of Sir Turncoat 'twas lately averr'd,     The electors would find him as good as his word!     \"_As good as his word_,\" did you say, \"gracious me!     _What a terrible scamp little Turncoat must be_!\"           CCV.--MODEST.  IT has been said that a lady once asked Lord B--g--m who was the best debater in the House of Lords. His lordship modestly replied, \"Lord Stanley is the _second_, madam.\"           CCVI.--A JOINT CONCERN.  A STUPID fellow employed in blowing a cathedral organ, said after the performance of a fine anthem, \"I think we performed very well to-day.\"--\"_We_ performed!\" answered the organist; \"I think it was _I_ performed, or I am much mistaken.\" Shortly after another celebrated piece of music was to be played. In the middle of the anthem the organ stopped; the organist cried out in a passion, \"Why don't you blow?\" The fellow popped out his head from behind the organ, and said, \"Shall it be _we_ then?\"           CCVII.--PROFESSIONAL.  AN editor at a dinner-table being asked if he would take some pudding, replied, in a fit of abstraction, \"Owing to a crowd of other matter, we are unable to find room for it.\"           CCVIII.--A GOOD REASON.  A RICH peer resolved to make his will; and having remembered all his domestics except his steward, the omission was respectfully pointed out to him by the lawyer. \"I shall leave him nothing,\" said the nobleman, \"because he has _served me_ these twenty years.\"           CCIX.--ON A BAD MAN.      BY imbecility and fears       Will is restrain'd from doing ill;     His mind a porcupine appears,       A porcupine _without a quill_.           CCX.--A CLEVER DOG.  AFTER witnessing the first representation of a dog-piece by Reynolds, called the \"Caravan,\" Sheridan suddenly came into the green-room, on purpose, it was imagined, to wish the author joy. \"Where is he?\" was the first question: \"where is my guardian angel?\"--\"Here I am,\" answered Reynolds. \"Pooh!\" replied Sheridan, \"I don't mean _you_, I mean _the dog_.\"           CCXI.--A KNOTTY POINT.  THE Bristol magistrates were at the time of the great riots _scattered_ through the town. They argued that under the circumstances it was impossible they could have been _collected_.           CCXII.--GEORGE SELWYN.  THIS gentleman, travelling in a stage-coach, was interrupted by the frequent impertinence of a companion, who was constantly teazing him with questions and asking him how he did. \"How are you now, sir?\" said the impertinent. George, in order to get rid of his importunity, replied, \"Very well; and I intend to continue so _all the rest_ of the journey.\"           CCXIII.--EMPEROR OF CHINA.  SIR G. STAUNTON related a curious anecdote of old Kien Long, Emperor of China. He was inquiring of Sir George the manner in which physicians were paid in England. When, after some difficulty, his majesty was made to comprehend the system, he exclaimed, \"Is any man well in England, that can afford to be ill? Now, I will inform you,\" said he, \"how I manage my physicians. I have four, to whom the care of my health is committed: a certain weekly salary is allowed them, but the moment I am ill, the salary stops till I am well again. I need not inform you my illnesses are _usually short_.\"           CCXIV.--LANDLORD AND TENANTS.      SAYS his landlord to Thomas, \"Your rent I must raise,       I'm so plaguily pinch'd for the pelf.\"     \"Raise my rent!\" replies Thomas; \"your honor's main good;       For I never can _raise it_ myself.\"           CCXV.--AN UGLY DOG.  JERROLD had a favorite dog that followed him everywhere. One day in the country, a lady who was passing turned round and said, audibly, \"What an ugly little brute!\" whereupon Jerrold, addressing the lady, replied, \"Oh, madam! I wonder what he thinks _about us_ at this moment!\"           CCXVI.--THE WRONG LEG.  MATHEWS being invited by D'Egville to dine one day with him at Brighton, D'Egville inquired what was Mathews's favorite dish? A roasted leg of pork, with sage and onions. This was provided; and D'Egville, carving, could not find the stuffing. He turned the joint about, but in vain. Poole was at table, and, in his quiet way, said, \"Don't make yourself unhappy, D'Egville; _perhaps it is in the other leg_.\"           CCXVII.--FEMALE TALKERS.  IT was customary in some parish churches for the men to be placed on one side, and the women on the other. A clergyman, in the midst of his sermon, found himself interrupted by the talking of some of the congregation, of which he was obliged to take notice. A woman immediately rose, and wishing to clear her own sex from the aspersion, said: \"Observe, at least, your reverence, it is not on our side.\"--\"So much the better, good woman, so much the better,\" answered the clergyman; \"it will be the _sooner over_.\"           CCXVIII.--FIGHTING BY MEASURE.  THE usual place of resort for Dublin duellists was called the Fifteen Acres. An attorney of that city, in penning a challenge, thought most likely he was drawing a lease, and invited his antagonist to meet him at \"the place called Fifteen Acres--'be the same more or less.'\"           CCXIX.--SUGGESTION.  \"DO you know what made my voice so melodious?\" said a celebrated vocal performer, of awkward manners, to Charles Bannister. \"No,\" replied the other. \"Why, then, I'll tell you: when I was about fifteen, I swallowed, by accident, some train oil.\"--\"I don't think,\" rejoined Bannister, \"it would have done you any harm if, at the same time, you had _swallowed a dancing-master_!\"           CCXX.--THE FORCE OF SATIRE.  JACOB JOHNSON, the publisher, having refused to advance Dryden a sum of money for a work upon which he was engaged, the incensed bard sent a message to him, and the following lines, adding, \"Tell the dog that he who wrote these can write more\":--      \"With leering looks, bull-necked, and freckled face,     With two left legs, and Judas-colored hair,     And frowsy pores, that taint the ambient air!\"  Johnson felt the force of the description; and, to avoid, a completion of the portrait, immediately sent the money.           CCXXI.--THE ANGLO-FRENCH ALLIANCE.  JERROLD was in France, and with a Frenchman who was enthusiastic on the subject of the Anglo-French alliance. He said that he was proud to see the English and French such good friends at last. \"Tut! the best thing I know between France and England is--_the sea_,\" said Jerrold.           CCXXII.--QUIN'S SAYING.  ON the 30th of January (the martyrdom of King Charles the First), Quin used to say, \"Every king in Europe would rise with a _crick in his neck_.\"           CCXXIII.--A GOOD REASON.  A CERTAIN minister going to visit one of his sick parishioners, asked him how he had rested during the night. \"Oh, wondrous ill, sir,\" replied he, \"for mine eyes have not come together these three nights.\"--\"What is the reason of that?\" said the other. \"Alas! sir,\" said"]]]
