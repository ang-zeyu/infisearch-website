Spen._ Then make for France amain; Levune, away!    Proclaim King Edward's wars and victories.

Nature, yield to my country's cause in this!    A brother? no, a butcher of thy friends!    Proud Edward, dost thou banish me thy presence?    But I'll to France, and cheer the wronged queen,    And certify what Edward's looseness is.    Unnatural king, to slaughter nobleman    And cherish flatterers!  Mortimer, I stay    Thy sweet escape.  Stand gracious, gloomy night,    To his device!            _Enter the younger_ MORTIMER _disguised._  _Y. Mor._ Holla! who walketh there?    Is't you, my lord? _Kent._ Mortimer, 'tis I.    But hath thy portion wrought so happily? _Y. Mor._ It hath, my lord: the warders all asleep,    I thank them, gave me leave to pass in peace.    But hath your grace got shipping unto France? _Kent._ Fear it not.                                           [_Exeunt._        _Enter_ QUEEN ISABELLA _and_ PRINCE EDWARD.  _Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, our friends do fail us all in France!    The lords are cruel, and the king unkind.    What shall we do? _P. Edw._ Madam, return to England,    And please my father well; and then a fig    For all my uncle's friendship here in France!    I warrant you, I'll win his highness quickly;    'A loves me better than a thousand Spensers. _Q. Isab._ Ah, boy, thou art deceiv'd, at least in this,    To think that we can yet be tun'd together!    No, no, we jar too far.--Unkind Valois!    Unhappy Isabel, when France rejects,    Whither, O, whither dost thou bend thy steps?                 _Enter_ SIR JOHN OF HAINAULT.  _Sir J._ Madam, what cheer? _Q. Isab._ Ah, good Sir John of Hainault,    Never so cheerless nor so far distrest! _Sir J._ I hear, sweet lady, of the king's unkindness:    But droop not, madam; noble minds contemn    Despair.  Will your grace with me to Hainault,    And there stay time's advantage with your son?--    How say you, my lord! will you go with your friends,    And shake off all our fortunes equally? _P. Edw._ So pleaseth the queen my mother, me it likes:    The king of England, not the court of France,    Shall have me from my gracious mother's side,    Till I be strong enough to break a staff;    And then have at the proudest Spenser's head! _Sir J._ Well said, my lord! _Q. Isab._ O my sweet heart, how do I moan thy wrongs,    Yet triumph in the hope of thee, my joy!--    Ah, sweet Sir John, even to the utmost verge    Of Europe, on the shore of Tanais,    Will we with thee to Hainault--so we will:    The marquis is a noble gentleman;    His grace, I dare presume, will welcome me.--    But who are these?           _Enter_ KENT _and the younger_ MORTIMER.  _Kent._ Madam, long may you live,    Much happier than your friends in England do! _Q. Isab._ Lord Edmund and Lord Mortimer alive!    Welcome to France! the news was here, my lord,    That you were dead, or very near your death. _Y. Mor._ Lady, the last was truest of the twain:    But Mortimer, reserv'd for better hap,    Hath shaken off the thraldom of the Tower,    And lives t' advance your standard, good my lord. _P. Edw._ How mean you, and the king my father lives?    No, my Lord Mortimer, not I, I trow. _Q. Isab._ Not, son! Why not?  I would it were no worse!--    But, gentle lords, friendless we are in France. _Y. Mor._ Monsieur Le Grand, a noble friend of yours,    Told us, at our arrival, all the news,--    How hard the nobles, how unkind the king    Hath show'd himself: but, madam, right makes room    Where weapons want; and, though a many friends    Are made away, as Warwick, Lancaster,    And others of our part and faction,    Yet have we friends, assure your grace, in England,    Would cast up caps, and clap their hands for joy,    To see us there, appointed for our foes. _Kent._ Would all were well, and Edward well reclaim'd,    For England's honour, peace, and quietness! _Y. Mor._ But by the sword, my lord, 't must be deserv'd:    The king will ne'er forsake his flatterers. _Sir J._ My lords of England, sith th' ungentle king    Of France refuseth to give aid of arms    To this distressed queen, his sister, here,    Go you with her to Hainault: doubt ye not    We will find comfort, money, men, and friends,    Ere long to bid the English king a base.--    How say'st, young prince, what think you of the match? _P. Edw._ I think King Edward will outrun us all. _Q. Isab._ Nay, son, not so; and you must not discourage    Your friends that are so forward in your aid. _Kent._ Sir John of Hainault, pardon us, I pray:    These comforts that you give our woful queen    Bind us in kindness all at your command. _Q. Isab._ Yea, gentle brother:--and the God of heaven    Prosper your happy motion, good Sir John! _Y. Mor._ This noble gentleman, forward in arms,    Was born, I see, to be our anchor-hold.--    Sir John of Hainault, be it thy renown,    That England's queen and nobles in distress    Have been by thee restor'd and comforted. _Sir J._ Madam, along; and you, my lord[s], with me,    That England's peers may Hainault's welcome see.            [_Exeunt._     _Enter_ KING EDWARD, ARUNDEL, _the elder_ SPENSER, _the                younger_ SPENSER, _and others._  _K. Edw._ Thus, after many threats of wrathful war,    Triumpheth England's Edward with his friends,    And triumph Edward with his friends uncontroll'd!--    My Lord of Glocester, do you hear the news? _Y. Spen._ What news, my lord? _K. Edw._ Why, man, they say there is great execution    Done through the realm.--My Lord of Arundel,    You have the note, have you not? _Arun._From the Lieutenant of the Tower, my lord. _K. Edw._ I pray, let us see it.          [_Takes the note from Arundel._    --What have we there?--    Read it, Spenser.                              [_Gives the note to young Spenser, who reads                                  their names._    Why, so: they bark'd apace a month ago;    Now, on my life, they'll neither bark nor bite.    Now, sirs, the news from France?  Glocester, I trow,    The lords of France love England's gold so well    As Isabella gets no aid from thence.    What now remains? have you proclaim'd, my lord,    Reward for them can bring in Mortimer? _Y. Spen._ My lord, we have; and, if he be in England,    'A will be had ere long, I doubt it not. _K. Edw._ If, dost thou say?  Spenser, as true as death,    He is in England's ground: our port-masters    Are not so careless of their king's command.                    _Enter a_ Messenger.     How now! what news with thee? from whence come these? _Mess._ Letters, my lord, and tidings forth of France:    To you, my Lord of Glocester, from Levune.                                        [_Gives letters to young Spenser._ _K. Edw._ Read. _Y. Spen._ [reading.] _My duty to your honour promised, etc., I    have, according to instructions in that behalf, dealt with the    King of France and his lords, and effected that the queen, all    discontented and discomforted, is gone: whither, if you ask,    with Sir John of Hainault, brother to the marquis, into    Flanders.  With them are gone Lord Edmund and the Lord    Mortimer, having in their company divers of your nation,    and others; and, as constant report goeth, they intend to    give King Edward battle in England, sooner than he can    look for them.  This is all the news of import.                            Your honour's in all service, Levune._ _K. Edw._ Ah, villains, hath that Mortimer escap'd?    With him is Edmund gone associate?    And will Sir John of Hainault lead the round?    Welcome, o' God's name, madam, and your son!    England shall welcome you and all your rout.    Gallop apace, bright Phbus, through the sky;    And, dusky Night, in rusty iron car,    Between you both shorten the time, I pray,    That I may see that most desired day,    When we may meet these traitors in the field!    Ah, nothing grieves me, but my little boy    Is thus misled to countenance their ills!    Come, friends, to Bristow, there to make us strong:    And, winds, as equal be to bring them in,    As you injurious were to bear them forth!

Isab._ Now, lords, our loving friends and countrymen,    Welcome to England all, with prosperous winds!    Our kindest friends in Belgia have we left,    To cope with friends at home; a heavy case    When force to force is knit, and sword and glaive    In civil broils make kin and countrymen    Slaughter themselves in others, and their sides    With their own weapons gor'd!  But what's the help?    Misgovern'd kings are cause of all this wreck;    And, Edward, thou art one among them all,    Whose looseness hath betray'd thy land to spoil,    Who made the channel overflow with blood    Of thine own people: patron shouldst thou be;    But thou-- _Y.

HOWE    about this book  \"God created man to live in relation with the world of things, with himself, and with his fellow men, and to live in these relationships in such a way that he will ... grow in his relationship with God,\" writes Dr. Howe in this meaningful book. He describes the true significance of Christian fellowship and how it can come about and exist. Living responsibly by giving ourselves to one another--parent to child, child to parent, pastor to congregation, congregation to one another, church to the world--only in living out the Word of God's love in human relationships can we experience the love of God.  Dr. Howe wrote this book at the request of the Division of Christian Education and the Division of Evangelism of the American Baptist Convention. It grew out of a series of lectures he presented at a national conference on Christian education at Green Lake, Wis., on the subject, \"Growth in the Christian Fellowship.\"  It is intended that this book be used in study groups such as parent groups or parent-teacher groups. Pastors and students of the church will gain new insights from it. Moreover, any individual who is truly interested in the Christian life will find that it is addressed to him.  _Cover Design by Alexander Limont_     HEREIN IS LOVE     By the same author_ _Man's Need and God's Action_ _The Creative Years_     HEREIN IS LOVE  A Study of the Biblical Doctrine of Love in Its Bearing on Personality, Parenthood, Teaching, and All Other Human Relationships  by  REUEL L.

As I stepped to the speaker's rostrum to begin my first lecture to that group, and my first to so large a group of Baptist lay people, I wondered whether I as an Episcopalian and they as Baptists had images of each other that would help or hinder our communication. I shared with them my question and learned later they had been asking themselves the same question. I explained that I had prepared myself to speak to them in the hope that through me some of the truth of God would be heard by them, and I explained also that their lives were to be their preparation for hearing what I had to say; that is, that I hoped they would work as hard to hear me as I would work to make myself understood. They responded in good spirit, so that the Spirit of God spoke through and to all of us.  I describe this occasion because it produced the experience and context out of which the present book appeared. _Herein Is Love_ is, I believe, an outward and visible sign of the fellowship of the Holy Spirit experienced on that occasion; and I offer it as a means of opening to others the possibility of participating in this fellowship of the Holy Spirit.  The theme of the book grows out of that experience: As the love of God required incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth in order that it might be received by us, so the Word of God's love in our day calls for persons in whom it may be embodied. The church, as the embodiment of divine love in human relationships, has tremendous responsibilities and opportunities in our modern culture. The old and familiar biblical symbols and stories do not always communicate their meanings to men today, and we must find a language that does. The language of the lived life of both man and God is the one that we shall use here in an attempt to open to us the meaning of the life of man and of God.

Nobody pays much attention to it any more, except some of its own members; and they don't seem to be interested in anything except their own activities. The time was when the word of the minister carried weight. Some may not have agreed, but when the church spoke they paid attention. It's not true now, though.\"  Mr. Clarke eyed the others in the group as if he were testing their reactions to the statements he had just made. The church had always given him a sense of security, and now he was both worried that it seemed to have lost its power, and resentful that people no longer listened to its teaching.  He was one of a group of leaders of a local congregation who, at the request of their minister, were meeting to re-examine the purpose of the church. Not all of the group had arrived as yet, and the minister of the congregation, Mr. Gates, had been detained in his office by an emergency call upon his pastoral care.  Within the minute after Mr. Clarke finished, Mr. Wise spoke up. He was a thoughtful and compassionate member of the congregation who often raised the kind of questions that carried the discussion to deeper levels. When his questions were ignored, as they often were, he would smile good-naturedly and continue both as a contributor and as a question raiser. Turning to Mr. Clarke, he said: \"I think I know how you feel. The statements of our ordained spiritual leaders are important, but do you think we should equate their words with--\"  As usual, Mr. Wise's comment was interrupted, and this time by Mr. Churchill who, with evident irritation, protested against any concern over what others thought about the church. He said: \"The church has got to be the church, and the world is different from it. I don't like this 'return to religion' business. Christianity and the church aren't supposed to be popular movements. If people want to join the church, that's fine; but if they don't, that's their lookout. Let's be the church and leave the world to itself.\"  \"But why was Christ born _into the world_--\" began Mr. Wise.  \"I don't agree,\" exclaimed Mrs. Strait, responding to Mr. Churchill's comment and not hearing Mr. Wise. \"I think we should be concerned about the world; concerned"]]]
