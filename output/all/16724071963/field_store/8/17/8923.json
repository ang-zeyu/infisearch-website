Why should he be reared as a gentleman--he, a poor waif of the sea? Probably he is the son of some low mechanic, perhaps of a Northern mudsill, and my aunt--think of it, my aunt--must bring him up as a Southern gentleman!\" The young man leaped up and began to pace the boathouse floor nervously. \"I suppose she'll leave him a large legacy in her will.\"  \"I 'spect you is right, Massah St. John; dat boy will be pervided for, suah as my name's Ben.\"  \"You talk as if you already knew something of this?\" said St. John quickly.  \"I does know somet'ing, sah.\"  \"Has my aunt ever spoken to you on the subject, Ben?\"  \"I don't know as I ought to answer dat dar question, Massah St. John.\"  \"Then she has spoken. What did she say?\"  The colored man hesitated.  \"As I said befo', sah, I don't rackon I ought to answer dat dar question.\"  \"But you must answer me, Ben--to keep silent is foolish. Rest assured I have the best interests of my aunt and Marion at heart. Now what did she say?\"  \"Well, sah, if yo' must know, she said as how she was gwine to leave Massah Jack half de prop'ty.\"  St. John leaped back in amazement.  \"You don't mean that, Ben!\" he gasped.  \"Yes, sah, I does mean it.\"  \"Half the property?\"  \"Yes, sah.\"  \"He doesn't deserve it!\"  At this the old negro shrugged his huge shoulders.  \"Rackon de missus knows what she wants to do.\"  \"But it is not right--to give the boy half the estate. I suppose the other half will go to Marion.\"  \"Yes, sah.\"  The young man's face grew pale, and he began to pace the floor again.  \"She never mentioned me in connection with this, did she?\"  \"No, sah.\"  \"And yet I am her nephew.\"  \"Rackon she dun thought yo' was rich enough, Massah St. John.\"  \"Perhaps I am, Ben. But it is strange that my own flesh and blood should forget me, to take up with a nobody. Did my aunt ever speak of the particulars of what she intended to do?\"  \"No, sah.\"  \"Humph! It's strange. I must look into this.\" And a few minutes later St. John Ruthven was off on horseback, in a frame of mind far from pleasant.     CHAPTER VI.  MRS. RUTHVEN'S STORY.   \"I am so glad to see you both back, safe and sound!\"  It was Mrs. Alice Ruthven who spoke, as she embraced first her daughter and then Jack.  \"And we are glad enough to get back, mother,\" answered Marion.  \"I was so frightened, even after Old Ben went after you. We watched the lightning, and when it struck the wreck----\" Mrs. Ruthven stopped speaking and gave a shiver.  \"We weren't in such very great danger,\" answered Jack. Then he looked at the lady curiously.  \"What is it, Jack? You have something on your mind,\" she said quickly.  The youth looked at Marian, who turned red.  \"I--I--that is, mother, Jack knows the truth,\" faltered the girl.  \"The truth?\" repeated Mrs. Ruthven slowly.  \"Yes, Marion has told me the truth,\" said Jack, in as steady a voice as he could command. \"And so I--I--am not your son.\" He could scarcely speak the words.  \"Oh, Jack!\" The lady caught him in her arms. \"So you know the truth at last?\" She kissed him. \"But you are my son, just as if you were my own flesh and blood. You are not angry at me for keeping this a secret so long? I did it because I did not wish to hurt your feelings.\"  \"No, I am not angry at you, Mrs. Ruth----\"  \"Call me mother, Jack.\"  \"I am not angry, mother. You have been very kind to me. But it is so strange! I can't understand it all,\" and he heaved a deep sigh.  \"You have been a son to me in the past, Jack; I wish you to continue to be one.\"  \"But I have no real claim upon you.\"  \"Yes, you have, for my late husband and myself adopted you.\"  \"Marion told me that you never heard one word regarding my past.\"  \"She told the truth. We tried our best, but every effort ended in failure. Your mother called you Jack ere she died, and that was all.\"  \"What of our clothing? Was none of it marked, or had she nothing in her pocket?\"  \"No, the clothing was not marked, and she had nothing in her pocket but a lace handkerchief, also unmarked. That handkerchief I have kept, with the clothing. And I have also kept a ring she wore upon one of her fingers.\"  \"Was that marked?\"  \"It had been, but it was so worn that we could not make out the marking, nor could the two jewelers by whom we had the ring inspected.\"  \"I would like to see the ring.\"  \"I will get it,\" returned Mrs. Ruthven, and left the room. Soon she came back with a small jewel casket, from which she took a ring and a very dainty lace handkerchief.  \"Here is the ring,\" she said, as she passed it over to Jack.  \"It looks like a wedding ring,\" said the youth, as he gazed at the circlet of gold.  \"I believe it is a wedding ring.\"  Jack looked inside and saw some markings, but all were so faint that it was impossible to make out more than the figures 1 and 8.  \"Those figures stand for eighteen hundred and something, I imagine,\" said Mrs. Ruthven. \"They must give the year when your mother was married.\"  \"I suppose you are right.\"  \"The ring belongs to you, Jack. I would advise you to be careful of it.\"  \"If you please, I would like to have you keep it for the present.\"  \"I will do that willingly.\"  The handkerchief was next examined. But it seemed to be without markings of any kind, and was soon returned to the jewel case along with the ring.  \"Now tell me how Marion came to tell you of the past,\" said Mrs. Ruthven, after putting the jewel case away.  \"I made her tell me the truth,\" said Jack.  \"But how did you suspect this at first?\"  \"Because of something St. John said to Darcy Gilbert.\"  \"What did he say?\"  \"Oh, it doesn't matter much--now, mother. He told Darcy I wasn't your son.\"  \"What else did he say?\"  \"Oh, I think I had better not say.\"  \"But you must tell me, Jack; I insist upon knowing.\"  \"He told Darcy that I was a nobody, and that I would have to go away some day.\"  At these words Mrs. Ruthven's face flushed angrily.  \"St. John is taking too much upon his shoulders,\" she cried. \"This is no business of his.\"  \"I may be a nobody, but, but\"--Jack stammered--\"if he says anything to me, I am afraid there will be a row.\"  \"He shall not say anything to you. I will speak to him about this. Leave it all to me.\"  \"But he shall not insult me,\" said Jack sturdily.  Marion had left the apartment, to change her clothing, so she did not hear what was said about St. John. A few words more on the subject passed between the lady of the plantation and the youth, and then the talk shifted back to Jack's past.  \"Some day I am going to find out who I am.\" said the boy. \"There must be some way to do this.\"  \"Are you then so anxious to leave me, Jack?\" asked Mrs. Ruthven, and the tears sprang into her eyes.  \"No, no, mother; I will not leave you so long as you wish me to stay!\" he exclaimed. \"It isn't that. But this mystery of the past must be solved.\"  \"Well, I will help you all I can. But do not hope for too much, my boy, or you may be disappointed,\" and then she embraced him again.  Running up to his bedroom, Jack quickly changed the suit which had been soaked the night before for a better one, and then came below again. He hardly knew what to do with himself. The news had set his head in a whirl. At last he decided to go out riding on a pony Mrs. Ruthven had given him a few weeks before.  The pony was soon saddled by one of the stable hands, and Jack set off on a level road running between the two Ruthven plantations. At first he thought to ask Marion to accompany him, but then decided that he was in no humor to have anybody along.  \"I must think this out by myself,\" was the way he reasoned, and set off at a brisk pace under the wide-spreading trees.  He was less than quarter of a mile away from home when he came face to face with St. John, who was returning from his visit to Old Ben's boathouse.  As the two riders approached each other, the young man glared darkly at our hero.  \"Hullo, where are you bound?\" he demanded sharply.  \"I don't think that is any of your business, St. John,\" replied Jack, who was just then in no humor to be polite.  \"Humph! you needn't get on your high horse about it!\"  \"I am not on a high horse, only on a small pony.\"  \"Don't joke me, Jack--I don't like it.\"  \"As you please, St. John.\"  \"What's got into you this morning?\" demanded the young man curiously.  \"Well, if you want to know, I don't like the way you have been talking about me.\"  \"Oho! so that is how the wind blows.\"  \"You have taken the pains to call me a nobody,\" went on Jack hotly.  \"I told the truth, didn't I?\"  \"I consider myself just as good as you, St. John Ruthven.\"  \"Do you indeed!\" sneered the spendthrift.  \"I do indeed, and in the future I will thank you to be more careful of what you say about me.\"  \"I have a right to tell the truth to anybody I please.\"  \"I don't deny that. But I consider my blood just as good as yours.\"  \"Do you? I don't.\"  \"Your opinion isn't worth anything to me.\"  \"Humph! still riding a high horse, I see. Let me tell you, you are not half as good as a Ruthven, and never will be. How my aunt could take you in is a mystery to me.\"  \"She is not as hard-hearted as you are.\"  \"She is very foolish.\"  \"She is my foster mother, and I'll thank you to speak respectfully of her,\" cried Jack, his eyes flashing.  \"Of course you'll stick by her--as long as she'll let you. You have a nice ax to grind.\"  \"I don't understand your last words.\"  \"She owns considerable property, and you will try to get a big share of it for yourself, when she dies.\"  \"I have never given her property a thought. I want only what is rightfully coming to me.\"  \"There is nothing coming to you by right. The property ought to go to Marion and the other Ruthvens.\"  \"By other Ruthvens I suppose you mean yourself.\"  \"I am one of them.\"  \"Are you so anxious to get hold of my aunt's plantation?\"  \"I don't want to see my aunt waste it on such a low upstart as you!\"  Jack's eyes flashed fire, and riding close to St. John he held up his little riding whip.  \"You shan't call me"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20432"],["title","Young Captain Jack; Or, The Son of a Soldier (#5)"],["body","upstart!\" he ejaculated. \"Take it back, or I'll hit you with this!\"  \"You won't dare to touch me!\" howled St. John in a rage. \"You are an upstart, and worse, to my way of thinking.\"  Scarcely had the words left his lips when Jack brought down the riding whip across the young man's shoulders and neck, leaving a livid red mark behind.  \"Oh!\" howled the spendthrift, and gave a jerk backward on the reins, which brought his horse up on his hind legs. \"How dare you! I'll--I'll kill you for that!\"  \"Do you take it back or not?\" went on Jack, raising the whip again.  Instead of replying St. John reached over to hit the youth with his own whip. But Jack dodged, and then struck out a second time. The blow landed upon St. John's hand, and he jerked back quickly. The movement scared the horse, and the animal plunged so violently that the rider was thrown from the saddle into some nearby bushes. Then the horse galloped away, leaving St. John to his fate.     CHAPTER VII.  A SETBACK FOR ST. JOHN.   \"Now see what you have done!\" roared St. John, as soon as he could scramble from the bushes.  His face was scratched in several places and his coat was torn at one elbow.  \"It was your fault as much as mine,\" retorted Jack.  \"No such thing. You had no right to pitch into me.\"  \"And you had no right to call me names.\"  \"My horse has run away,\" stormed the young man.  \"So I see.\"  \"If he is lost or hurt you'll be responsible.\"  \"He is running toward home. I reckon he'll be all right.\"  \"What am I to do?\"  \"That's your lookout.\"  \"Get down and let me ride your pony home.\"  \"I will do no such thing!\" cried Jack. The little steed was very dear to him.  \"Do you expect me to walk?\"  \"You can suit yourself about that, St. John. Certainly I shan't carry you,\" and Jack began to move off.  \"Stop! don't leave me like this.\"  \"You are not much hurt. Do you want to continue the fight?\"  \"I don't calculate to fight a mere boy like you. Some day I'll give you a good dressing down for your impudence.\"  \"All right; when that time comes, I'll be ready for you,\" returned Jack coolly, and without further words he rode away.  Standing in the middle of the road, St. John Ruthven shook his fist after the youth.  \"I hate you!\" he muttered fiercely. \"And I'll not allow you to come between me and my aunt's property, remember that!\" But the words did not reach Jack, nor were they intended for his ears.  There was a spring of water not far away, and going to this St. John washed his face and his hands. Then he combed his hair with a pocket-comb he carried, and brushed his clothing as best he could. He was more hurt mentally than physically, and inwardly boiled to get even with our hero.  Left to himself, he hardly knew what to do. He was satisfied that his horse would go home as Jack had said, but he was in no humor to follow the animal.  \"I've a good mind to call on Aunt Alice and tell her what a viper he is,\" he said to himself. \"Perhaps I can get her to think less of him than she does--and that will be something gained.\"  He walked slowly toward the plantation. When he came within sight of the garden he saw Marion in a summerhouse, arranging a bouquet of flowers which she had just cut.  The sight of his cousin put his heart in a flutter and made him think of the talk he had had with his mother. Why should he not propose to her at once? The sooner the better, to his way of thinking. That Marion might refuse him hardly entered his head. Was he not the best \"catch\" in that neighborhood?  \"How do you do, Marion?\" he said, as he strode up to the summerhouse.  \"Why, St. John, is that you?\" returned the girl. \"I did not see you riding up.\"  \"I came on foot,\" he went on, as he came in and threw himself on a bench. \"It's warm, too.\"  \"It is warm. Shall I send for some refreshments?\"  \"No, don't bother just now, Marion. I came over to see you alone.\"  \"Alone?\" she said in some surprise.  \"Yes, alone, Marion. I have something very important to say to you.\"  She did not answer, but turned away to fix the bouquet.  \"Can you guess what I wish to say?\" he went on awkwardly.  \"I haven't the remotest idea, Cousin St. John.\"  \"I want to tell you how much I love you, Cousin Marion.\"  \"Oh!\"  \"Don't think that I speak from sudden impulse. I have loved you for years, but I wished to wait until you were old enough to listen to me.\"  \"And you think I am old enough now?\" she said, with a faint smile. \"Mamma thinks me quite a girl still.\"  \"You are old enough to marry, if you wish, Marion.\"  \"Marry?\" She laughed outright. \"Oh, St. John, don't say that. Why, I don't intend to marry in a long, long time--if at all.\"  His face fell, and he bit his lip. Certainly this was not the answer he had expected.  \"But I want you!\" he burst out, still more awkwardly. \"I want to--to protect you from--er--from Jack.\"  \"Protect me from Jack?\"  \"Yes, Marion. You know what he is, a mere nobody.\"  \"Jack is my brother.\"  \"He is not, and you know it.\"  \"He is the same as if he were my brother, St. John.\"  \"Again I say he is not. He is a mere upstart, and he will prove a snake in the grass unless you watch him. Your mother made a big mistake when she adopted him.\"  \"There may be two opinions upon that point.\"  \"He knows your mother is rich. Mark my word, he will do all he can, sooner or later, to get her property away from her.\"  \"I will not believe evil of Jack.\"  \"You evidently think more of him than you do of me!\" sneered the spendthrift, seeing that he was making no headway in his suit.  \"I do not deny that I think the world and all of Jack. He is my brother in heart, if not in blood--and I will thank you to remember that after this,\" went on Marion in a decided tone.  \"You will learn of your mistake some time--perhaps when it is too late.\"  \"Jack is true to the core, and as brave as he is true. Why, he would go to the war if mamma would give her consent.\"  At this St. John Ruthven winced.  \"Well--er--I would go myself if my mother did not need me at home,\" he stammered. \"She must have somebody to look after the plantation. We can't trust the niggers.\"  \"Many men have gone to the front and allowed their plantations to take care of themselves. They place the honor of their glorious country over everything else.\"  \"Well, my mother will not allow me to go--she has positively forbidden it,\" insisted St. John, anxious to clear his character.  This statement was untrue; he had never spoken to his mother on the subject, thinking she might urge him to go to the front. His plea that he must look after the plantation was entirely of his own making.  \"Supposing we should lose in this struggle--what will become of your plantation then?\"  At this St. John grew pale.  \"I--I hardly think we will lose,\" he stammered. \"We have plenty of soldiers.\"  \"But not as many as the North has. General Lee could use fifty thousand more men, if he could get them.\"  \"Well, I shall go to the front when I am actually needed, Marion; you can take my word on that. But won't you listen to what I have told you about my feeling for you?\"  \"No, St. John; I am too young to fall in love with anybody. I shall at least wait until this cruel war is over.\"  \"But I can hope?\"  She shook her head. Then she picked up her bouquet.  \"Will you come up to the house with me?\"  \"Not now, Marion. Give my respects to my aunt and tell her I will call in a day or two again. And, by the way, Marion, don't let her think hard of me because of Jack. I desire only to see to it that the boy does not do you mischief.\"  \"As I said before, I will listen to nothing against dear Jack, so there!\" cried Marion, and stamping her foot, she hurried toward the house.  St. John Ruthven watched her out of sight, then turned and stalked off toward the roadway leading to his home.  \"She evidently does not love me as I thought,\" he muttered to himself. \"And I made a mess of it by speaking ill of Jack. Confound the luck! What had I best do now? I wish I could get that boy out of the way altogether, I really do.\"     CHAPTER VIII.  THE HOME GUARDS OF OLDVILLE.   The week to follow the events recorded in the last chapter was a trying one for the inhabitants of Oldville, as the district around the Ruthvens' plantation was called.  The army of the North had pressed the army of the South back steadily day after day, until the Confederates were encamped less than four miles away from Jack's home. For two days the cannon-firing could be distinctly heard, and the women folks were filled with dread, thinking the invaders from the North were about to swoop down upon their homes and pillage them.  \"Oh, Jack! do you think they will come here?\" was the question Marion asked at least a dozen times.  \"They had better not,\" was the sturdy reply. \"If they do, they will find that even a boy can fight.\"  \"But you could do nothing against an army, Jack.\"  \"Perhaps not. But I'll do what I can to protect you and mother.\"  \"Old Ben told me that you and Darcy Gilbert were organizing a Home Guard.\"  \"Yes; we have organized a company of boys. We have twenty-three members, and I am the captain,\" answered Jack, with just a bit of pride in his tones.  \"Then you are Captain Jack!\" exclaimed Marion. \"Let me congratulate you, captain. But have you any weapons?\"  \"Yes. I have an old sword and also a pistol, and all of the others have pistols or guns. I think, if we were put to it, we might do our enemy some damage.\"  \"No doubt, since I know you and Darcy can shoot pretty straight. You ought to ask St. John to join the command.\"  \"Not much, Marion! Don't you know that St. John is a coward at heart, even if he is a man?\"  \"Yes, I know it. One of the colored help on his plantation told Old Ben that the cannon-firing so close at hand made him so uneasy he couldn't eat or sleep.\"  \"Is it possible! Now the cannon-firing simply makes me crazy to be at the front, to see what is going on, and to take part.\"  \"Then you must be a born soldier, Jack.\" Marion heaved a sigh. \"Oh, I wish this war was over! Why must the"]]]
