When completed, public notice will be given. Let every benevolent individual in our community then come forward and give this system his countenance and pecuniary support; and let all resolve by a united effort to do away the baleful influence of a tolerated pauperism, by detecting and discountenancing every vicious and unworthy applicant for charity, and by industriously searching out and promptly relieving every real and deserving object of distress.

[15] Mrs. SARAH PARKMAN, the relict of Samuel Parkman, Esq., one of the most distinguished of the merchants of this city. Those who knew her, and have seen how faithfully, affectionately, and judiciously she discharged the duties of a daughter, a wife, a parent to her own offspring, and a mother to many others, who with her own children, have abundant reason to \"rise up and call her blessed;\" or who have learned from report the leading events of her virtuous, benevolent and active life, will esteem the humble tribute thus paid to her memory, as proceeding from an estimate of her excellencies by no means exaggerated. As an evidence of the value of her services to the Asylum, the following extract has, by permission, been taken from the Minutes of the Board of Managers:--  _At a meeting of the Board of Managers of the Boston Female Asylum, held on the last Tuesday of July, 1835,--_  VOTED, That the Managers are deeply sensible of the loss sustained since the last meeting, in the death of their excellent First Directress, Mrs. Sarah Parkman, the last who remained at the Board, of its original members, and for the last fourteen years its presiding Officer. That they hold in affectionate remembrance her gentleness, her charity, her thoughtfulness for others, her constant endeavor to do good; and it may be permitted to add,--for it was a conspicuous trait in her character,--the sincerity of heart with which, in all her varied intercourse, she followed the apostolic injunction, \"be courteous.\"  Also, that they acknowledge with much gratitude to her, and to the children by whom her wishes were so promptly fulfilled, the receipt of Five Hundred Dollars, the last testimony of her interest in an Institution, which, from its foundation, has owed so much to her labors, her counsels, and the liberality, which even in death, did not fail.         *       *       *       *       *  Since the establishment of the Asylum in 1800, 357 children have been admitted.

MY DEAR SCUDDER:--You and I were drawn together many years ago by a common love for insects and their ways.  I dedicate this little volume of ephemeral essays to you in recognition of your worth as a man and a scientist, and as a token of warm friendship.    Yours sincerely,    A. S. PACKARD, JR.     PREFACE.   This little volume mainly consists of a reprint of a series of essays which appeared in the \"American Naturalist\" (Vols. i-v, 1867-71). It is hoped that their perusal may lead to a better acquaintance with the habits and forms of our more common insects. The introduction was written expressly for this book, as well as Chapter XIII, \"Hints on the Ancestry of Insects.\" The scientific reader may be drawn with greater interest to this chapter than to any other portion of the book. In this discussion of a perhaps abstruse and difficult theme, his indulgence is sought for whatever imperfections or deficiencies may appear. Our systems of classification may at least be tested by the application of the theory of evolution. The natural system, if we mistake not, is the genealogy of organized forms; when we can trace the latter, we establish the former. Considering how much naturalists differ in their views as to what is a natural classification, it is not strange that a genealogy of animals or plants seems absurd to many. To another generation of naturalists it must, perhaps, be left to decide whether to attempt the one is more unphilosophical than to attempt the other.  Most of the cuts have already appeared in the \"Guide to the Study of Insects\" and the \"American Naturalist,\" where their original sources are given, while a few have been kindly contributed by Prof. A. E. Verrill, the Boston Society of Natural History, and Prof. C. V. Riley, and three are original.  SALEM, June, 1873.     OUR COMMON INSECTS.  INTRODUCTORY.   _What is an Insect?_ When we remember that the insects alone comprise four-fifths of the animal kingdom, and that there are upwards of 200,000 living species, it would seem a hopeless task to define what an insect is. But a common plan pervades the structure of them all. The bodies of all insects consist of a succession of rings, or segments, more or less hardened by the deposition of a chemical substance called chitine; these rings are arranged in three groups: the head, the thorax, or middle body, and the abdomen or hind body. In the six-footed insects, such as the bee, moth, beetle or dragon fly, four of these rings unite early in embryonic life to form the head; the thorax consists of three, as may be readily seen on slight examination, and the abdomen is composed either of ten or eleven rings. The body, then, seems divided or _insected_ into three regions, whence the name _insect_.  The head is furnished with a pair of antennæ, a pair of jaws (mandibles), and two pairs of maxillæ, the second and basal pair being united at their base to form the so-called labium, or under lip. These four pairs of appendages represent the four rings of the head, to which they are appended in the order stated above.  A pair of legs is appended to each of the three rings of the thorax; while the first and second rings each usually carry a pair of wings.  The abdomen contains the ovipositor; sometimes, as in the bees and wasps, forming a sting. In the spiders (Fig. 1), however, there are no antennæ, and the second maxillæ, or labium, is wanting. Moreover, there are four pairs of legs. The centipedes (Fig. 2, a Myriopod) also differ from the rest of the insects in having an indefinite number of abdominal rings, each bearing a pair of legs.  [Illustration: 1. Spider (Tegenaria).]  On examining the arrangement of the parts within, we find the nervous cord, consisting of two chains of swellings, or nerve-knots, resting upon the floor or under side of the body; and the heart, or dorsal vessel, situated just under the skin of the back; and in looking at living caterpillars, such as the cut-worm, and many thin-skinned aquatic larvæ, we can see this long tubular heart pulsating about as often as our own heart, and when the insect is held against its will, or is agitated, the rapidity of the pulsations increases just as with us.  [Illustration: 2. Centipede.]  Insects do not breathe as in the higher animals by taking the air into the mouth and filling the lungs, but there are a series of holes or pores along the side of the body, as seen in the grub of the humble bee, through which the air enters and is conveyed to every part of the body by an immense number of air tubes. (Fig. 3, air tubes, or tracheæ, in the caudal appendage of the larva of a dragon fly). These air tubes are everywhere bathed by the blood, by which the latter becomes oxygenated.  [Illustration: 3. Caudal appendage of larva of Agrion.]  Indeed the structure of an insect is entirely different from that of man or the quadrupeds, or any other vertebrate animal, and what we call head, thorax, abdomen, gills, stomach, skin, or lungs, or jaws, are called so simply for convenience, and not that they are made in the same way as those parts in the higher animals.  An insect differs from a horse, for example, as much as a modern printing press differs from the press Franklin used. Both machines are made of iron, steel, wood, etc., and both print; but the plan of their structure differs throughout, and some parts are wanting in the simpler press which are present and absolutely essential in the other. So with the two sorts of animals; they are built up originally out of protoplasm, or the original jelly-like germinal matter, which fills the cells composing their tissues, and nearly the same chemical elements occur in both, but the mode in which these are combined, the arrangement of their products: the muscular, nervous and skin tissues, differ in the two animals. The plan of structure, namely, the form and arrangement of the body walls, the situation of the appendages to the body, and of the anatomical systems within, i.e., the nervous, digestive, circulatory, and respiratory systems, differ in their position in relation to the walls of the body. Thus while the two sorts of animals reproduce their kind, eat, drink and sleep, see, hear and smell, they perform these acts by different kinds of organs, situated sometimes on the most opposite parts of the body, so that there is no comparison save in the results which they accomplish; they only agree in being animals, and in having a common animal nature.  [Illustration: 4. Different forms of jaws.]  [Illustration: 5. Mouth parts of the Larva of a Beetle.]  [Illustration: 6. Maxilla of a Beetle.]  _How Insects Eat._ The jaws of insects (Fig. 4) are horny processes situated on each side of the mouth. They are variously toothed, so as to tear the food, and move horizontally instead of up and down as in the horse. The act of taking the food, especially if the insect be carnivorous in its habits, is quite complex, as not only the true jaws, but the accessory jaws (maxillæ, Fig. 5, _a_, upper, b, under side of the head of a young beetle; _at_, antennæ, _md_, mandible, _mx_, maxillæ, _mx_[1], labium) and the feelers (palpi) attached to the maxillæ, and the under lip (labium) are of great service in enabling the insect to detect its food both by the senses of touch and smell. The maxillæ are in the fully grown beetle (Fig. 6) divided into three lobes, the outermost forming the palpus, and the two others forming sharp teeth, often provided with hairs and minute brushes for cleansing the adjoining parts; these strong curved teeth are used in seizing the food and placing it between the grinders, where it is crushed, prepared for digestion and swallowed. Fig. 7 represents the mouth parts of the humble bee. (_b_, upper lip; _d_, mandible; _e_, maxilla; _f_, maxillary palpus; _g_, tongue; _ih_, labium and tabial palpi; _k_, eye.)  [Illustration: 7. Mouth parts of a Humble Bee.]  The alimentary canal passes through the middle of the body, the stomach forming usually a simple enlargement. Just before the stomach in certain insects, as the grasshopper, is a gizzard armed with rows of powerful horny teeth for finely crushing grass.  Insects eat almost incredible quantities of food when young and growing rapidly. Mr. Trouvelot tells us in the \"American Naturalist\" that the food taken by a single American Silk-worm in fifty-six days is equal to eighty-six thousand times its primitive weight! On the other hand, after the insect has finished its transformations, it either takes no food at all, as in the May fly, or merely sips the honey of flowers, as in the butterfly, while the June beetle and many others like it eat the leaves of trees, and the tiger and ground beetles feed voraciously on other insects.  _How Insects Walk._ In man and his allies, the vertebrates, the process of walking is a most difficult and apparently dangerous feat. To describe the mechanics of walking, the wonderful adaptation of the muscles and bones for the performance of this most ordinary action of life, would require a volume. The process is scarcely less complex in insects. Lyonnet found 3,993 muscles in a caterpillar, and while a large proportion belong to the internal organs, over a thousand assist in locomotion. Hence the muscular power of insects is enormous. A flea will leap two hundred times its own height,"]]]
