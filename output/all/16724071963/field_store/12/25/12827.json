So has it been, that, when, the storms of life came on, the moral building was rocked by the winds, the rain pierced its thin covering; it rested on the sand; it fell, and great was its fall.  Here is a young school-girl. What is to be her situation on arriving at womanhood? Must she assume responsible stations? Have we here the germ of the conjugal tie, and the elements of maternal influence? How then can we forget these relations, and train a being fit only to bask in the beams of praise? Let not this be. Address now the same motives as you must in subsequent years. If there must then be self-denial, toil, and care, for the love of humanity, leave not the young heart, at this stage, to become steeped in selfishness. Let the glory of God and the good of man become now solemn and effective considerations.  We come here to speak naturally of the Place, the theatre, on which the young female must be educated.  It is to be done partly in public, at the schools instituted for this purpose. But I do not design to enter the halls of science and literature. I would rather, adverting here to the conclusion of her studies, confine myself to the use which a young lady should make of the education she has received at school. The advantages, now enjoyed by the youth of our land for mental culture, are rare. Parents are solicitous that their children should spend much time at the seats of learning. The daughters are receiving a far higher intellectual training than their mothers enjoyed. But is this all a sure good? Have the thousand rivulets of learning that now flow fast by our homes, sprung all from a crystal fount? Do they, in a word,--for that is the test question,--so penetrate the life and soul of the young, as to give them solid, practical excellence? I fear not.  Much is said about \"finishing the education.\" And finished, in one sense, is that of many females in this age. For, between their school culture and their subsequent character, there is as little connection as between the body and its dress. The school-room is left, and the garment, so beautiful to the eye, falls at once off. Into the centre and essence of the individual's being, the permanent character, nothing has passed. The books once studied are gladly thrown aside. Not a single motive is felt, to press forward in the noble work of self-education. Languages have been learned; but their great object, as keys to the study of foreign literatures, is left unanswered. History is a dull theme; philosophy is merged in the newest novel; dress and gossip, a little fancy needle-work, and a world of castle-building,--oh! it is sad; it is humiliating; would to God it were false. I speak to the wise, judge ye, and say if the picture has not some counterpart within your personal knowledge.  But how should the young lady improve the literary privileges of her early days? Let her not depend on the reputation of the teacher who instructed her, nor of the school, high though it be, which she last attended; nor yet again on the branches she has studied, however numerous or unusual they are. It is her own efforts, the attention, the application, and the intellectual toil she passed through, on which alone she may reflect with satisfaction. What effect did all these studies produce on her mind? Is the tree laden with fruits, or did the profusion of blossoms fall barren to the earth?  Among the results of a good intellectual training is this; it gives vigor to all the powers of the mind. Memory is cultivated, but not at the expense of the understanding. Female pupils often shine in those branches which depend on mere memory, while they fail in those which task the reason. Geography and history are their delight; mathematics and metaphysics, their aversion. This should not be.  Woman is exposed, by her habitual seclusion, to many narrowing influences. She has little of that severe discipline of the mind to which man is daily subjected. His intercourse with the world is more extensive. His whole life is a school for the intellect, while she is restricted, to a great degree, within the limits of home. Her duties consist much of details; and small subjects engender contracted views. Therefore should her early days be devoted to studies that, in after life, will serve to counteract this evil tendency. It should be made a matter of principle with teachers and parents,--and the pupil must, of course, co-operate in their plan,--to enlarge her mental vision, to fortify her intellect against limited notions, and to strengthen her judgment. The atmosphere of the fireside is often close and oppressive; let her in her youth, breathe the free air of heaven. So will her mental constitution be invigorated and prepared for all coming duty.  If I may venture to recommend one study in particular, for its invigorating influence, I would name the practice of frequent composition. She who writes daily, whether it be in her journal, or essays on indifferent subjects, or even good letters, will, in addition to many other benefits of this practice, strengthen in herself greatly the habit of connected and profitable thought.  Study should form intellectual Tastes. To what purpose has the girl been placed all these years at school, if, when her privileges terminate, she has no fondness for study? Why lead her through the pleasant fields of learning, if, at the close of her walk, she is to possess no relish for these scenes? She has drank at \"the wells of English undefiled,\" and shall she now turn aside and imbibe the turbid waters of a corrupt and corrupting literature? Alas! that she should now prefer fiction and folly to the healthful writings of wise men. Deplorable is it, that her past lessons of instruction, so many and so faithful, must now, by her own indolence or perversion, prove to have fallen on her ear, like snow-flakes that melt on the ocean.  Another office of education at school is to impart Knowledge. It has been said that a woman must possess either beauty or knowledge to commend her to favorable notice in the world. The former is the rare gift of nature; while the latter may be always acquired. John Wilkes, who was as famous for his ugly face as for being universally popular in society, on being asked the secret of his popularity, answered, that \"it took him but five minutes to talk away his face.\" What a talisman might every young woman thus bear with her into society, would she early cultivate and store her mind. How should it be, that she who has spent years over grammar, cannot now write a letter to a friend without violating its fundamental principles? I have read of one, who, when at a loss how to spell a word, put a dash under the doubtful letters, that if wrong, they might pass for a jest. Miserable subterfuge! What better is it to pass the most precious period of life in a school room, if such be the fruits, than to live uneducated and ignorant? Those are indeed the truly and unpardonably ignorant, who leave their studies with no accurate knowledge. Better is her lot, who was constrained to give her whole youth to manual labor, if she have a thirst for knowledge, and devote her leisure frugally to profitable reading.  The young lady should not finish her school occupations without securing good Habits of mind. Let her carry through life her present mental discipline. Let her accustom herself, if she read a book, to review and give an account to herself of its contents. Is she listening to a discourse? What a valuable means may it be made of intellectual improvement. Let her reflect on each topic, and on the order, the arrangement and connection, of the whole. After listening to an interesting conversation, let her recall, and strive to impress on her mind, every useful thought that was advanced. Indeed, her whole earthly experience may be so improved as to be a continual seminary of self-instruction and mental advancement. How infinitely better is it thus to construct a firm bridge across the entire river of life, than to trust to the frail bonds of ice, the work of a night, and to be dissolved before the next meridian sun.  This leads me to say that female education should be of a Practical description. The girl is destined to be a house-keeper, and yet she is, perhaps, doing almost nothing to prepare herself for that station. She thinks a knowledge of housewifery comes by instinct; and so it is that she cares more for her French and her piano than for those studies which would fit her for domestic duty. But in vain do this sex receive high degrees of culture, if they are still unable to apply their knowledge to any useful purpose. Why train the mind so sedulously, if it prove in the end but a leaden instrument, too flexible for service? Every woman should be trained for a variety of situations. Let her be educated for self-subsistence. What a miserable creature is she, if incompetent to obtain her own livelihood. That she is now placed in independent circumstances, affords no assurance that she will be always thus situated. Can any one forget the fearful reverses of fortune, especially in this land of pecuniary adventure and adversity? A lady, who had once rode in her own carriage, and lived in Eastern splendor, was seen, not long since, seated in Broadway, New York, selling nuts to the passengers. Talk we of independence! Who are free from bondage to others, and slavery to time and circumstance, but those who cannot earn their own subsistence?  Among the causes for gratitude, that woman now has, not the least is the circumstance that new avenues for female industry are constantly opening in this age. To some one at least of these, should every young lady direct her attention. No one should be entirely unskilled as a teacher, a housewife, and above all, in the use of the needle.

But it is  sometimes quite hard to spot just  which man is the unnecessary one. In  this case ... not the one you think!_    Illustrated by Martinez       _\"I recall,\" said the Businessman, \"that William Wrigley, Junior,     once said:_ 'When two men in a business always agree, one of them is     unnecessary.' _How true that is.\"_      _The Philosopher cast his eyes toward Heaven. \"O God! The Mercantile     Mind!\" He looked back at the Businessman. \"When two men in a     business always agree, one of them will come in handy as a     scapegoat.\"_                                                   _THE IDLE WORSHIPERS_                                                  by R. Phillip Dachboden  [Illustration]  Lord Barrick Sorban, Colonel, H.I.M.O.G., Ret., sipped gently at his drink and looked mildly at the sheaf of newsfacsimile that he'd just bought fresh from the reproducer in the lobby of the Royal Hotel. Sorban did not look like a man of action; he certainly did not look like a retired colonel of His Imperial Majesty's Own Guard. The most likely reason for this was that he was neither.  Not that he was incapable of action on a physical level if it became necessary; he was past forty, but his tough, hard body was in as fine a shape as it had been fifteen years before, and his reflexes had slowed only slightly. The only major change that had occurred in his body during that time had been the replacement of an irreparably damaged left hand by a prosthetic.  But Lord Barrick Sorban preferred to use his mind, to initiate action in others rather than himself, and his face showed it. His was a precision mind, capable of fast, accurate computations, and his eyes betrayed the fact, but the rest of his face looked, if anything, rather like that of a gentle, persuasive schoolteacher--the type whom children love and parents admire and both obey.  Nor was he a retired colonel of the Imperial bodyguard, except on paper. According to the official records, he had been retired for medical reasons--the missing left hand. In reality, his position in the Imperium was a great deal higher than that of an ordinary colonel, and he was still in the active service of the Emperor. It was a secret known only to a comparative few, and one that was carefully guarded.  He was a fairly tall man, as an Imperial Guardsman had to be, with a finely-shaped head and dark hair that was shot through with a single streak of gray from an old burn wound. In an officer's uniform, he looked impressive, but in civilian dress he looked like a competent businessman.  He held the newsfac in his prosthetic left hand, which was indistinguishable in appearance and in ordinary usage from the flesh, bone, and blood that it had replaced. Indeed, the right hand, with its stiff little finger, often appeared to be more useless than the left. The hand, holding the glass of rye-and-ginger, gave an impression of over-daintiness because of that stiff digit.  Lord Sorban paid little attention to the other customers in the bar; customers of the Green Room of the Royal Hotel weren't the noisy kind, anyway. He kept his attention on the newsfac for the most part; only a small amount of awareness was reserved for the approach of the man he was waiting for.  The banner line on the newsfac said:      BAIRNVELL OCCUPIED     BY IMPERIAL FORCES  He read through the article hurriedly, absorbing what facts he didn't know, and then flipped over to the editorial page. If he knew the _Globe_, there would sure as Space be an editorial.  There was.      At 0231 Greenwich Earth Time, 3/37/229, the forces of the Imperial     Government occupied the planet Bairnvell. (See article, Page One.)     The ships of the Imperial Space Force landed, purportedly at the     request of Obar Del Pargon, rebel leader of the anti-Presidential     forces. That such an action should be condoned by the Imperial File     is astounding enough; that it should be ordered by the Prime     Portfolio himself is almost unbelievable.      The government of Bairnvell, under the leadership of President     Alverdan, was not, by any means, up to the standards of the Empire;     the standard of living is lower, and the political freedom of the     people is not at all what we are used to. But that is no excuse for     interfering with the lawful government of any planet. If the     Imperium uses these methods for extending its rule, the time must     eventually come when our own civil liberties will be in peril.      Perhaps Lord Senesin's actions are not so surprising, at that. This     is the third time during his tenure as Prime Portfolio that he has     arbitrarily exercised his power to interfere in the affairs of     governments outside the Empire. Each such action has precipitated a     crisis in Galactic affairs, and each has brought the Empire nearer     to conflict with the Gehan Federation. This one may be the final act     that will bring on interstellar war.      The ...         *       *       *       *       *  Colonel Lord Sorban stopped reading as he noticed the approach of the man he'd been waiting for, but he didn't look up until the voice said:  \"I see you've been reading it, my lord.\" The voice was bitter. \"A real fiasco this time, eh?\"  Sorban looked up. \"It looks like it might mean trouble,\" he said carefully. \"Have you read all of it, Mr. Senesin?\"  The young man nodded. The bitterness in his voice was paralleled by the bitterness reflected in his face. \"Oh, yes. I read it. The other newsfacs pretty much agreed with the _Globe_. I'm afraid my father seems to be rather in the soup. Being Prime Portfolio in the Terran Empire isn't the easiest way to stay out of trouble. They'll be screaming for a Special Election next.\" He sat down next to the colonel and lowered his voice just enough to keep anyone else from hearing it, but not enough to sound conspiratorial. \"I think I've got a line on those tapes.\"  Colonel Sorban raised an eyebrow. \"Really? Well, I wish you luck. If you can uncover them in time, you may be able to save your father's career,\" he said, in a voice that matched Senesin's.  \"You don't sound very concerned, my lord,\" said young Senesin.  \"It's not that,\" said the colonel. \"I just find it difficult to believe that--\" He cut his words off as another man approached.  The second newcomer was a red-faced, plumpish man with an almost offensively hearty manner. \"Well, well! Good afternoon, Lord Sorban! Haven't seen you in some time. A pleasure to see you again, my lord, a distinct pleasure! I don't get to Honolulu often, you know. How long's it been? Four years?\"  \"Two, I think,\" said the colonel.  \"Really? Only two? It seems longer. How've you been?\"  \"Well enough,\" said the colonel. \"Excuse me--Mr. Heywood, I'd like to present you to the Honorable Jon Senesin; Mr. Senesin, this is Robar Heywood, of South African Metals.\"  While the two men shook hands and mouthed the usual pleasantries, Colonel Lord Sorban watched them with an amusement that didn't show on his placid face. Young Senesin was rather angry that the _tête-á-tête_ had been interrupted, while Heywood seemed flustered and a trifle stuffy.  \"So you're the son of our Prime Portfolio, eh?\" he said. There was a trace of hostility in his voice.  Colonel Sorban saw what was coming and made no effort whatsoever to stop it. Instead, he simply sat there in straight-faced enjoyment.  \"That's correct, Mr. Heywood,\" Senesin said, a little stiffly.  \"I should have known,\" Heywood said. \"You look a great deal like him. Although I don't know that I've ever seen your picture in the newsfacs or on the screens.\"  \"Dad prefers to keep his family out of the spotlight,\" said Senesin, \"unless we get publicity for something other than the accidental fact that we happen to be the family of the Prime.\"  \"Yes, yes, of course. I see. May I stand the three of us a drink?\" Senesin and the colonel were agreeable. The drinks were brought. Heywood took a swallow of his, and remarked casually: \"Do you agree with your father's politics, sir?\"  \"I don't know,\" Senesin said flatly.  Heywood misunderstood completely. \"Yes, I suppose it is a bit disappointing. Hard for a man's son to divide his loyalty like that. You can't support his actions, and yet you hesitate to condemn your own father.\"  \"You mistake my meaning, Mr. Heywood,\" young Senesin said sharply. \"I said, 'I don't know' because I honestly don't know what my father's politics _is_ any more.\"  But Heywood only compounded his error. \"Of course not. How could you? Since he became Prime, his policies have been erratic and unpredictable, not to say foolish.\"  _This is it_, thought the colonel, wondering what young Senesin's reaction would be. He didn't have to wonder longer than half a second.  \"Mr. Heywood,\" said Senesin, his voice oddly tight under the strain of suppressed emotion, \"a person should learn to know what he's talking about before he makes any attempt to talk. If you must talk drivel about my father, I'll thank you not to do it in my presence.\" And before Heywood could formulate an answer, Senesin turned to the colonel. \"If you'll pardon me, my lord, I have another errand to perform. I'll see you at eleven.\" Then he turned and walked out.  Heywood stared at his receding back. \"Well,\" he said after a moment, \"I guess I spoke out of turn. But he seemed ...\" He turned back to his drink, shrugged. \"Oh, well. Tell me, my lord, what do _you_ think of Senesin's policies? How long do you think he'll last in office?\"  The colonel adroitly avoided the first question by answering the second. \"I dare say he won't last long. There'll be a great fuss in the File, and most of his own party will desert him--I think. They hardly have any choice, considering the reaction of the populace to this Bairnvell thing.\"  \"And I agree,\" said"]]]
