Peter loves it, but don't let them go on too long or there may be an accident.' And then she gave a few more instructions, and--here we are.\"  \"Peter,\" I said to the somnolent one, \"you can't deceive a woman. Also men are pigs. Wake up, and we will apologize to your aunt for doubting her. Sorry, Myra.\"  Myra pinned a flower in my coat and forgave me, and we walked off together with the perambulator.  \"Peter is seeing a bit of life this morning,\" I said. \"What shall we show him now?\"  \"Thomas and Samuel are playing golf,\" said Myra casually.  I looked at her doubtfully.  \"Is that quite suitable?\"  \"I think if we didn't let him stay too long it would be all right. Dahlia wouldn't like him to be overexcited.\"  \"Well, he can't be introduced to the game too early. Come on, Peter.\" And we pushed into more open country.  The 9-hole course which Simpson planned a year ago is not yet used for the Open Championship, though it is certainly better than it was last summer. But it is short and narrow and dog-legged, and, particularly when Simpson is playing on it, dangerous.  \"We are now in the zone of fire,\" I said. \"Samuel's repainted ninepenny may whiz past us at any moment. Perhaps I had better go first.\" I tied my handkerchief to Myra's sunshade and led the way with the white flag.  A ball came over the barn and rolled towards us, just reaching one of the wheels. I gave a yell.  \"Hallo!\" bellowed Simpson from behind the barn.  \"You're firing on the ambulance,\" I shouted.  He hurried up, followed leisurely by Thomas.  \"I say,\" he said excitedly, \"have I hurt him?\"  \"You have not even waked him. He has the special gift of--was it Wellington or Napoleon?--that of being able to sleep through the heaviest battle.\"  \"Hallo!\" said Thomas. \"Good old boy! What's he been learning to-day?\" he added, with godfatherly interest.  \"We're showing him life to-day. He has come to see Simpson play golf.\"  \"Doesn't he ever sit up?\" asked Simpson, looking at him with interest. \"I don't see how he's going to see anything if he's always on his back. Unless it were something in the air.\"  \"Don't you ever get the ball in the air?\" said Myra innocently.  \"What will his Uncle Samuel show him if he does sit up?\" I asked. \"Let's decide first if it's going to be anything worth watching. Which hole are you for? The third?\"  \"The eighth. My last shot had a bit of a slice.\"  \"A slice! It had about the whole joint. I doubt,\" I said to Myra, \"if we shall do much good here; let's push on.\"  But Myra had put down the hood and taken some of the clothes off Peter. Peter stirred slightly. He seemed to know that something was going on. Then suddenly he woke up, just in time to see Simpson miss the ball completely. Instantly he gave a cry.  \"Now you've done it,\" said Myra. \"He's got to go in. And I'm afraid he'll go away with quite a wrong idea of the game.\"  But I was not thinking of the baby. Although I am to be his uncle by marriage I had forgotten him.  \"If that's about Simpson's form to-day,\" I said to Myra, \"you and I could still take them on and beat them.\"  Myra looked up eagerly.  \"What about Peter?\" she asked; but she didn't ask it very firmly.  \"We promised Dahlia to take him in directly he cried,\" I said. \"She'd be very upset if she thought she couldn't trust us. And we've got to go in for our clubs, anyway,\" I added.  Peter was sleeping peacefully again, but a promise is a promise. After all, we had done a good deal for his education that morning. We had shown him human nature at work, and the position of golf in the universe.  \"We'll meet you on the first tee,\" said Myra to Thomas.   VI.--HE SLEEPS  \"It's sad to think that to-morrow we shall be in London,\" said Simpson, with a sigh.  \"Rotten,\" agreed Thomas, and took another peach.  There was a moment's silence.  \"We shall miss you,\" I said, after careful thought. I waited in vain for Dahlia to say something, and then added, \"You must both come again next year.\"  \"Thank you very much.\"  \"Not at all.\" I hate these awkward pauses. If my host or hostess doesn't do anything to smooth them over, I always dash in. \"It's been delightful to have you,\" I went on. \"Are you sure you can't stay till Wednesday?\"  \"I'm so sorry,\" said Dahlia, \"but you took me by surprise. I had simply no idea. Are you really going?\"  \"I'm afraid so.\"  \"Are _you_ really staying?\" said Archie to me. \"Help!\"  \"What about Peter?\" asked Myra. \"Isn't he too young to be taken from his godfathers?\"  \"We've been talking that over,\" said Simpson, \"and I think it will be all right. We've mapped his future out very carefully and we shall unfold it to you when the coffee comes.\"  \"Thomas is doing it with peach-stones,\" I said. \"Have another, and make him a sailor, Thomas,\" and I passed the plate.  \"Sailor indeed,\" said Dahlia. \"He's going to be a soldier.\"  \"It's too late. Thomas has begun another one. Well, he'll have to swallow the stone.\"  \"A trifle hard on the Admiralty,\" said Archie. \"It loses both Thomas and Peter at one gulp. My country, what of thee?\"  However, when Thomas had peeled the peach, I cleverly solved the difficulty by taking it on to my plate while he was looking round for the sugar.  \"No, no sugar, thanks,\" I said, and waved it away.  With the coffee and cigars Simpson unfolded his scheme of education for Peter.  \"In the first place,\" he said, \"it is important that even as a child he should always be addressed in rational English and not in that ridiculous baby-talk so common with young mothers.\"  \"Oh dear,\" said Dahlia.  \"My good Samuel,\" I broke in, \"this comes well from you. Why, only yesterday I heard you talking to him. I think you called him his nunkey's ickle petsy wetsy lambkin.\"  \"You misunderstood me,\" said Simpson quickly. \"I was talking to _you_.\"  \"Oh!\" I said, rather taken aback. \"Well--well, I'm not.\" I lit a cigar. \"And I shall be annoyed if you call me so again.\"  \"At the age of four,\" Simpson went on, \"he shall receive his first lesson in cricket. Thomas will bowl to him----\"  \"I suppose that means that Thomas will have to be asked down here again,\" said Archie. \"Bother! Still, it's not for four years.\"  \"Thomas will bowl to him, Archie will keep wicket, and I shall field.\"  \"And where do I come in?\" I asked.  \"You come in after Peter. Unless you would rather have your lesson first.\"  \"That's the second time I've been sat on,\" I said to Myra, \"Why is Simpson so unkind to me to-night?\"  \"I suppose he's jealous because you're staying on another week.\"  \"Probably; still, I don't like it. Could you turn your back on him, do you think, to indicate our heavy displeasure?\"  Myra moved her chair round and rested her elbow on the table.  \"Go on, Samuel,\" said Dahlia. \"You're lovely to-night. I suppose these are Thomas's ideas as well as your own?\"  \"His signature is duly appended to them.\"  \"I didn't read 'em all,\" said Thomas.  \"That's very rash of you,\" said Archie. \"You don't know what you mightn't let yourself in for. You may have promised to pay the child threepence a week pocket-money.\"  \"No, there's nothing like that,\" said Simpson, to Archie's evident disappointment. \"Well, then, at the age of ten he goes to a preparatory school.\"  \"Has he learnt to read yet?\" asked Dahlia. \"I didn't hear anything about it.\"  \"He can read at six. I forgot to say that I am giving him a book which I shall expect him to read aloud to Thomas and me on his sixth birthday.\"  \"Thomas has got _another_ invitation,\" said Archie. \"Dash it!\"  \"At fourteen he goes to a public school. The final decision as to which public school he goes to will be left to you, but, of course, we shall expect to be consulted on the subject.\"  \"I'll write and tell you what we decide on,\" said Archie hastily; \"there'll be no need for you to come down and be told aloud.\"  \"So far we have not arranged anything for him beyond the age of fourteen. I now propose to read out a few general rules about his upbringing which we must insist on being observed.\"  \"The great question whether Simpson is kicked out of the house to-night, or leaves unobtrusively by the milk train to-morrow morning, is about to be settled,\" I murmured.  \"'RULE ONE.--He must be brought up to be ambidextrous.' It will be very useful,\" explained Simpson, \"when he fields cover for England.\"  \"Or when he wants to shake hands with two people at once,\" said Archie.  \"'RULE TWO.--He must be taught from the first to speak French and German fluently.' He'll thank you for that later on when he goes abroad.\"  \"Or when he goes to the National Liberal Club,\" said Archie.  \"'RULE THREE.--He should be surrounded as far as possible with beautiful things.' Beautiful toys, beautiful wall-paper, beautiful scenery----\"  \"Beautiful godfathers?\" I asked doubtfully.  Simpson ignored me and went on hurriedly with the rest of his rules.  \"Well,\" said Archie, at the end of them, \"they're all fairly futile, but if you like to write them out neatly and frame them in gold I don't mind hanging them up in the bathroom. Has anybody else got anything fatuous to say before the ladies leave us?\"  I filled my glass.  \"I've really got a lot to say,\" I began, \"because I consider that I've been rather left out of things. If you come to think of it, I'm the only person here who isn't anything important, all the rest of you being godfathers, or godmothers, or mothers, or fathers, or something. However, I won't dwell on that now. But there's one thing I must say, and here it is.\" I raised my glass. \"Peter Blair Mannering, and may he grow up to be a better man than any of us!\"  Upstairs, in happy innocence of the tremendous task in front of him, the child slept. Poor baby!  We drank solemnly, but without much hope.     WINTER SPORT     WINTER SPORT   I.--AN INTRODUCTION  \"I had better say at once,\" I announced as I turned over the wine list, \"that I have come out here to enjoy myself, and enjoy myself I shall. Myra, what shall we drink?\"  \"You had three weeks' honeymoon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24313"],["title","Once a Week (#4)"],["body","October,\" complained Thomas, \"and you're taking another three weeks now. Don't you ever do any work?\"  Myra and I smiled at each other. Coming from Thomas, who spends his busy day leaning up against the wireless installation at the Admiralty, the remark amused us.  \"We'll have champagne,\" said Myra, \"because it's our opening night. Archie, after you with the head-waiter.\"  It was due to Dahlia, really, that the Rabbits were hibernating at the Hôtel des Angéliques, Switzerland (central-heated throughout); for she had been ordered abroad, after an illness, to pull herself together a little, and her doctor had agreed with Archie that she might as well do it at a place where her husband could skate. On the point that Peter should come and skate too, however, Archie was firm. While admitting that he loved his infant son, he reminded Dahlia that she couldn't possibly get through Calais and Pontarlier without declaring Peter, and that the duty on this class of goods was remarkably heavy. Peter, therefore, was left behind. He had an army of nurses to look after him, and a stenographer to take down his more important remarks. With a daily bulletin and a record of his table-talk promised her, Dahlia was prepared to be content.  As for Myra and me, we might have hesitated to take another holiday so soon, had it not been for a letter I received one morning at breakfast.  \"Simpson is going.\" I said. \"He has purchased a pair of skis.\"  \"That does it,\" said Myra decisively. And, gurgling happily to herself, she went out and bought a camera.  For Thomas I can find no excuses. At a moment of crisis he left his country's Navy in jeopardy and, the Admiralty yacht being otherwise engaged, booked a first return from Cook's. And so it was that at four o'clock one day we arrived together at the Hôtel des Angéliques, and some three hours later were settling down comfortably to dinner.  \"I've had a busy time,\" said Archie. \"I've hired a small bob, a luge and a pair of skis for myself, a pair of snow-shoes and some skates for Dahlia, a--a tricycle horse for Simpson, and I don't know what else. All in French.\"  \"What _is_ the French for a pair of snow-shoes?\" asked Myra.  \"I pointed to them in French. The undersized Robert I got at a bargain. The man who hired it last week broke his leg before his fortnight was up, and so there was a reduction of several centimes.\"  \"I've been busy too,\" I said. \"I've been watching Myra unpack, and telling her where not to put my things.\"  \"I packed jolly well--except for the accident.\"  \"An accident to the boot-oil,\" I explained. \"If I get down to my last three shirts you will notice it.\"  We stopped eating for a moment in order to drink Dahlia's health. It was Dahlia's health which had sent us there.  \"Who's your friend, Samuel?\" said Archie, as Simpson caught somebody's eye at another table and nodded.  \"A fellow I met in the lift,\" said Simpson casually.  \"Samuel, beware of elevator acquaintances,\" said Myra in her most solemn manner.  \"He's rather a good chap. He was at Peterhouse with a friend of mine. He was telling me quite a good story about a 'wine' my friend gave there once, when----\"  \"Did you tell him about your 'ginger-beers' at Giggleswick?\" I interrupted.  \"My dear old chap, he's rather a man to be in with. He knows the President.\"  \"I thought nobody knew the President of the Swiss Republic,\" said Myra. \"Like the Man in the Iron Mask.\"  \"Not _that_ President, Myra. The President of the Angéliques Sports Club.\"  \"Never heard of it,\" we all said.  Simpson polished his glasses and prepared delightedly to give an explanation.  \"The Sports Club runs everything here,\" he began. \"It gives you prizes for fancy costumes and skating and so on.\"  \"Introduce me to the President at once,\" cooed Myra, patting her hair and smoothing down her frock.  \"Even if you were the Treasurer's brother,\" said Archie, \"you wouldn't get a prize for skating, Simpson.\"  \"You've never seen him do a rocking seventeen, sideways.\"  Simpson looked at us pityingly.  \"There's a lot more in it than that,\" he said. \"The President will introduce you to anybody. One might see--er--somebody one rather liked the look of, and--er---- Well, I mean in an hotel one wants to enter into the hotel life and--er--meet other people.\"  \"Who is she?\" said Myra.  \"Anybody you want to marry must be submitted to Myra for approval first,\" I said. \"We've told you so several times.\"  Simpson hastily disclaimed any intention of marrying anybody, and helped himself lavishly to champagne.  It so happened that I was the first of our party to meet the President, an honour which, perhaps, I hardly deserved. While Samuel was seeking tortuous introductions to him through friends of Peterhouse friends of his, the President and I fell into each other's arms in the most natural way.  It occurred like this. There was a dance after dinner; and Myra, not satisfied with my appearance, sent me upstairs to put some gloves on. (It is one of the penalties of marriage that one is always being sent upstairs.) With my hands properly shod I returned to the ball-room, and stood for a moment in a corner while I looked about for her. Suddenly I heard a voice at my side.  \"Do you want a partner?\" it said.  I turned, and knew that I was face to face with the President.  \"Well----\" I began.  \"You are a new-comer, aren't you? I expect you don't know many people. If there is anybody you would like to dance with----\"  I looked round the room. It was too good a chance to miss.  \"I wonder,\" I said. \"That girl over there--in the pink frock--just putting up her fan----\"  He almost embraced me.  \"I congratulate you on your taste,\" he said. \"Excellent! Come with me.\"  He went over to the girl in the pink dress, I at his heels.  \"Er--may I introduce?\" he said. \"Mr.--er--er--yes, this is Miss--er--yes. H'r'm.\" Evidently he didn't know her name.  \"Thank you,\" I said to him. He nodded and left us. I turned to the girl in the pink frock. She was very pretty.  \"May I have this dance?\" I asked. \"I've got my gloves on,\" I added.  She looked at me gravely, trying hard not to smile.  \"You may,\" said Myra.   II.--THE OPENING RUN  With a great effort Simpson strapped his foot securely into a ski and turned doubtfully to Thomas.  \"Thomas,\" he said, \"how do you know which foot is which?\"  \"It depends whose,\" said Thomas. He was busy tying a large rucksack of lunch on to himself, and was in no mood for Samuel's ball-room chatter.  \"You've got one ski on one foot,\" I said. \"Then the other ski goes on the foot you've got over. I should have thought you would have seen that.\"  \"But I may have put the first one on wrong.\"  \"You ought to know, after all these years, that you are certain to have done so,\" I said severely. Having had my own hired skis fixed on by the _concierge_ I felt rather superior. Simpson, having bought his in London, was regarded darkly by that gentleman, and left to his own devices.  \"Are we all ready?\" asked Myra, who had kept us waiting for twenty minutes. \"Archie, what about Dahlia?\"  \"Dahlia will join us at lunch. She is expecting a letter from Peter by the twelve o'clock post and refuses to start without it. Also she doesn't think she is up to ski-ing just yet. Also she wants to have a heart-to-heart talk with the girl in red, and break it to her that Thomas is engaged to several people in London already.\"  \"Come on,\" growled Thomas, and he led the way up the hill. We followed him in single file.  It was a day of colour, straight from heaven. On either side the dazzling whiteness of the snow; above, the deep blue of the sky; in front of me the glorious apricot of Simpson's winter suiting. London seemed a hundred years away. It was impossible to work up the least interest in the Home Rule Bill, the Billiard Tournament, or the state of St. Paul's Cathedral.  \"I feel extremely picturesque,\" said Archie. \"If only we had a wolf or two after us, the illusion would be complete. The Boy Trappers, or Half-Hours among the Rocky Mountains.\"  \"It is a pleasant thought, Archie,\" I said, \"that in any wolf trouble the bachelors of the party would have to sacrifice themselves for us. Myra dear, the loss of Samuel in such circumstances would draw us very close together. There might be a loss of Thomas too, perhaps--for if there was not enough of Simpson to go round, if there was a hungry wolf left over, would Thomas hesitate?\"  \"No,\" said Thomas, \"I should run like a hare.\"  Simpson said nothing. His face I could not see; but his back looked exactly like the back of a man who was trying to look as if he had been brought up on skis from a baby and was now taking a small party of enthusiastic novices out for their first lesson.  \"What an awful shock it would be,\" I said, \"if we found that Samuel really did know something about it after all; and, while we were tumbling about anyhow, he sailed gracefully down the steepest slopes. I should go straight back to Cricklewood.\"  \"My dear chap, I've read a _lot_ about it.\"  \"Then we're quite safe.\"  \"With all his faults,\" said Archie, \"and they are many--Samuel is a gentleman. He would never take an unfair advantage of us. Hallo, here we are!\"  We left the road and made our way across the snow to a little wooden hut which Archie had noticed the day before. Here we were to meet Dahlia for lunch; and here, accordingly, we left the rucksack and such garments as the heat of the sun suggested. Then, at the top of a long snow-slope, steep at first, more gentle later, we stood and wondered.  \"Who's going first?\" said Archie.  \"What do you do?\" asked Myra.  \"You don't. It does it for you.\"  \"But how do you stop?\"  \"Don't bother about that, dear,\" I said. \"That will be arranged for you all right. Take two steps to the brink of the hill and pick yourself up at the bottom. Now then, Simpson! Be a man. The lady waits, Samuel. The---- Hallo! Hi! Help!\" I cried, as I began to move off slowly. It was too late to do anything about it. \"Good-bye,\" I called. And then"]]]
