Wizow's mouth popped open, agony showing in his eyes. Stan grinned tightly and eased off on the knob.  \"I really should spin this thing up to a proof load,\" he said. \"Might be interesting to see what kind of an assembly job they did on you. But we'll just leave you this way. All you've got to do is keep quiet. You're deaf, dumb, and blind, you understand?\" He turned on Mauson.  \"Now, for you--\" His voice trailed off.  The man was sitting like a puppet whose controlling strings had been cut. Stan's blazing fury started to burn down.  These minds, he suddenly realized, had been virtually paralyzed. He didn't need anything to tie them down. All he had to do was point his finger. They'd jump. He shook his head.  \"Funny,\" he told himself. \"All you have to do is be a little forceful. Why didn't somebody tell me about this?\" He looked calculatingly at Mauson.  \"Tell you what we're gonna do,\" he said rhythmically. \"Get your car over here. You know, the shielded job. We don't want anyone snapping at us with flashers.\" His voice hardened.  \"Come on,\" he ordered, \"get on that box. Tell 'em you want that car.\"         *       *       *       *       *  As the car rolled down the street, he leaned forward a little.  \"All right, driver,\" he said peremptorily, \"when we get to the Federation Building, swing into the official driveway.\"  The driver moved his head slightly. Stan sat back, waiting.  He looked at the building fronts as they swept past. When he'd first come here, he'd noticed the clean beauty of the city. And he's been unable to understand the indefinable warning he'd felt. But now--he'd looked beneath the surface.  The car slowed. A guard was flagging them down at the building entrance. Stan touched a window control.  \"Stand aside, Guardsman,\" he ordered. \"We're coming in.\" He flicked the window control again.  \"Keep going, driver,\" he ordered. \"You can let us out inside. Then find a place to park, and wait.\"  Another guard came toward them as the car rolled to a stop.  \"Hey,\" he protested, \"this is--\"  Stan looked at him coldly.  \"Which way to the Guard commander's office?\"  The man pointed. \"Elevator over there. Fifth floor. But--\"  \"I didn't ask for a story. Get our driver into a parking space and keep him there.\" Stan turned to Mauson.  \"All right. Get out.\"  He shepherded the man into the elevator and out again. In the hall, he glanced around, then walked through a doorway.  A middle-aged guardsman looked at him inquiringly.  \"Can I do something for you gentlemen?\"  \"Yes. We want to see the commander.\"  The guardsman smiled. \"Well, now, perhaps--\"  Stan looked at him sternly.  \"I've had my quota of runarounds today. I said we want to see the commander. Now, all you have to do is take us to him. Move!\"  The smile faded. For an instant, the man seemed about to rebel. Then he turned.  \"This way,\" he said evenly. He led the way through a large room, then tapped at a door on the other side.  \"Yes?\"  The voice was vaguely familiar to Stan. He frowned, trying to place it.  \"Two men to see you, sir. Seems a little urgent.\"  \"Oh? Well, bring them in.\"  Stan relaxed. This was getting easier, he thought. Now he could get these people to take Mauson before a determinator. His statements would furnish plenty of evidence for a full search of Janzel's Personnel files.  He jerked his head at Mauson.  \"Inside.\"  He waited as the man stepped through the door, then followed.  A slender man was standing behind a wide desk.  \"Well,\" he said calmly. \"Welcome home, Graham. Glad you could make it.\"  \"Major Michaels!\" Stan forgot everything he had planned to say.  The other smiled. \"Let's say Agent Michaels,\" he corrected. \"Special Corpsmen don't have actual Guard rank. Most of us got thrown out of the Academy in the first couple of years.\"  He glanced at the guardsman, then flicked a finger out to point at Mauson.  \"Take this down and put it away somewhere till we need it, deSilva. Graham and I have some talking to do.\"  \"Yes, sir.\" The middle-aged man turned toward Stan.  \"Congratulations, sir.\" He jerked a thumb at Mauson.  \"Come on, you. March.\"  Michaels held up a hand as Stan opened his mouth.  \"Never mind,\" he said quietly. \"DeSilva is quite capable of handling that one. Take care of three or four more like him if he had to. Pretty good man.\" He reached for a box on his desk.  \"Here,\" he said. \"Light up. Got a few things to talk about.\"  \"But I've got--\"  \"It can wait. Wall put the whole story on the tape when you were talking to him downstairs. We've been sweating you out.\"  \"You've been sweating me out? I had to practically force my way up here.\"  \"That you did.\" Michaels took a cigarette from the box, started to put it in his mouth, then pointed it at Stan.  \"That's normal procedure. You've heard of the Special Corps for Investigation, I presume?\"  \"Yes. But--\"  \"Ever think of being a corpsman yourself?\"  \"Of course. You know that--we've talked about it. But I never could--\"  \"That's right.\" Michaels waved the cigarette. \"We don't have recruiting offices. All our people have to force their way in. Tell me, do you know anything about the history of this planet?\"  Stan clenched his teeth. Somehow, he had lost the initiative in this interview. He took a deep breath.  \"Look,\" he said decisively, \"I--\"  \"Later.\" Michaels shook his head. \"You are familiar with this culture by now, then?\"  \"Well ... yes. I've read some history ... a little law.\"  \"Good. Saves me a lot of talk. You know, sometimes we run into a situation that can be corrected by a single, deft stroke. Makes things very pleasant. We send in an agent--or two or six. The necessary gets done, and somebody writes up a nice, neat report.\" He toyed with the cigarette lighter.  \"But this thing isn't like that. We've got a long, monotonous job of routine plugging to do. We've got to bust a hard-shelled system without hurting too many of the people within it. And we've been at it for a while. We think we've made some progress, but we've still got a lot of snakes to kill.  \"But even bad situations have their good points. At least, this place is a good training ground for probationers.\"  \"Probationers?\"  \"Right. Probationers who don't even know they're being tested.\" He smiled.  \"People with the qualifications for Senior Agent are hard to get. Most of them are latent--asleep. We can't expect them to walk in--we have to find them. Then we have to wake them up. It can be tricky.\"  He lit his cigarette, eying Stan thoughtfully.  \"I suppose you've heard some of the stories that fly around about the Corps. The truth of the matter is, the Senior Agent isn't any superman. He's just a normal human being with a couple of extra quirks.\"  He held up a finger.  \"First, he's trouble prone. A nasty situation attracts him much as a flame attracts a moth.  \"There are a lot of people like that. Most of them are always getting themselves clobbered. The agent usually doesn't.\"  He held up a second finger.  \"Because he has a compensating ability. When he turns on the pressure, people do just as he tells them--most people, that is.\" He sighed.  \"That's the latent ability. Sometimes full control is buried so deeply it takes something like a major catastrophe to wake the guy up to the fact he can use it.\" He smiled wryly.  \"Oh, he pushes people around once in a while--makes 'em uneasy when he's around--makes himself unpopular. But he's got no control. He's got to be awakened.\"  \"Yes, but--\"  \"Uh-uh. It sounds simple, but it isn't.\" Michaels shook his head.  \"You don't just snap a finger in front of this fellow. You've got to provide him with real trouble. Pile it on him--until he gets so much pressure built up that he snaps himself into action. Makes a place like this useful.\"  \"I begin to see. You mean all this stuff I've been going through was sort of a glorified alarm clock?\"  \"Yes. You could put it that way. That, and a trial assignment as a junior agent. Still want to be a Special Corpsman?\"  Stan looked around the office consideringly, then got to his feet.  \"I stood it without knowing what was going on. Even had a little fun once in a while. Maybe I could learn to like it if I knew what I was doing.\" He shrugged.  \"What's next?\"  Michaels shoved a stack of papers toward him.  \"Administrative details. You just can't get away from them.\" He took a pen from his desk.  \"After you sign all these, I'll get a couple of people in here for witnesses while we give you your oath.  \"It's practically painless.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24182"],["title","Rollo in London (#0)"],["body","IN LONDON   BY   JACOB ABBOTT.

(See Chap. XI.)]     ROLLO IN LONDON.     CHAPTER I.  CITY AND TOWN.   \"Which London shall we visit first?\" said Mr. George to Rollo.  \"Why,\" rejoined Rollo, surprised, \"are there two of them?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George. \"We may almost say there are two of them. Or, at any rate, there are two heads to the monster, though the immense mass forms but one body.\"  While Mr. George was saying these words Rollo had been standing on the step of the railway car and looking in at the window towards his uncle George, who was inside. Just at this time, however, the conversation was interrupted by the sound of the bell, denoting that the train was about to start. So Rollo jumped down from the step and ran back to his own car, which was a second-class car, two behind the one where Mr. George was sitting. He had scarcely got to his seat before the whistle of the conductor sounded and the train began to move. As it trundled along out of the station, gradually increasing its speed as it advanced, Rollo sat wondering what his uncle meant by the double-headed character which he had assigned to the monstrous city that they were going to see.  What is commonly called London does in fact consist, as Mr. George had said, of _two_ great cities, entirely diverse from each other, and completely distinct--each being, in its way, the richest, the grandest, and the most powerful capital in the world.  One of these twin capitals is the metropolis of commerce; the other is that of political and military power.  The first is called the City.  The second is called the West End.  Both together--with the immense region of densely-peopled streets and squares which connect and surround them--constitute what is generally called London.  The _city_ was the original London. The West End was at first called Westminster. The relative position of these two centres may be seen by the following map:--  [Illustration]  The city--which was the original London--is the most ancient. It was founded long before the days of the Romans; so long, in fact, that its origin is wholly unknown. Nor is any thing known in respect to the derivation or meaning of the name. In regard to Westminster, the name is known to come from the word _minster_, which means _cathedral_--a cathedral church having been built there at a very early period, and which, lying west of London as it did, was called the West Minster. This church passed through a great variety of mutations during the lapse of successive centuries, having grown old, and been rebuilt, and enlarged, and pulled down, and rebuilt again, and altered, times and ways without number. It is represented in the present age by the venerable monumental pile--the burial-place of the ancient kings, and of the most distinguished nobles, generals, and statesmen of the English monarchy--known through all the world as Westminster Abbey.  After a time, when England became at length one kingdom, the king built his palace, and established his parliament, and opened his court in Westminster, not far from the abbey. The place, being about three miles from the city, was very convenient for this purpose. In process of time public edifices were erected, and noblemen's houses and new palaces for the king or for other members of the royal family were built, and shops were set up for the sale of such things as the people of the court might wish to buy, and streets and squares were laid out; and, in fine, Westminster became gradually quite an extended and famous town. It was still, however, entirely distinct from London, being about three miles from it, farther up the river. The principal road from London to Westminster followed the margin of the water, and was called the Strand. Towards Westminster the road diverged from the river so as to leave a space between wide enough for houses; and along this space the great nobles from time to time built magnificent palaces around great square courts, where they could ride in under an archway. The fronts of these palaces were towards the road; and there were gardens behind them, leading down to the water. At the foot of the garden there was usually a boat house and a landing, where the people who lived in the palace or their friends could embark on board boats for excursions on the Thames.  In the mean time, while Westminster was thus becoming a large and important town, London itself, three miles farther down the river, was also constantly growing too, in its own way, as a town of merchants and artisans. Other villages, too, began to spring up in every direction around these great centres; and London and Westminster, gradually spreading, finally met each other, and then, extending on each side, gradually swallowed up these villages, until now the whole region, for five or six miles in every direction from the original centres, forms one mighty mass of streets, squares, lanes, courts, terraces, all crowded with edifices and thronged with population. In this mass all visible distinction between the several villages which have been swallowed up is entirely lost, though the two original centres remain as widely separated and as distinct as ever. The primeval London has, however, lost its exclusive right to its name, and is now simply called the _city_; and in the same manner Westminster is called the West End, and sometimes the _town_; while the name London is used to denote the whole of the vast conglomeration which envelops and includes the two original capitals.  The city and the West End, though thus swallowed, as it were, in the general metropolis, are still entirely distinct. They are in fact, in some respects, even more widely distinct from each other now than ever. Each is, in its own way, at the head of its class of cities. The city is the greatest and wealthiest mart of commerce in the world; while the West End is the seat and centre of the proudest and most extended political and military power. In fact, the commercial organization which centres in the city, and the military one which has its head quarters around the throne at the West End, are probably the greatest and most powerful organizations, each of its kind, that the world has ever known.  Mr. George explained all this to Rollo as they walked together away from the London Bridge station, where the train in which they came in from the south stopped when it reached London. But I will give a more detailed account of their conversation in the next chapter.     CHAPTER II.  LONDON BRIDGE.   When the train stopped at what is called the London Bridge station, the passengers all stepped out of their respective cars upon the platform. In the English cars the doors are at the sides, and not, as in America, at the ends;"]]]
