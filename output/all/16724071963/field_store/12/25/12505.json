I ain't had a bite to eat since this morning and I guess you boys haven't had much either. And since you've seemed to have made yourselves to home here, then by golly, you're going to sit down and eat with us.  \"Besides,\" she added over her shoulder as she went back to the stove for vegetables and bread, \"me 'n Johnny have already told you what story there is to tell. That's all there is to it.\"  She put more platters on the now-heaping table and then went around the table pouring coffee from the big ranch pot. \"All right, you men sit down now and dig in,\" she ordered.  \"Mrs. Thompson,\" an Army major with a heavy brush mustache said, \"we didn't come here to eat. We came for information.\"  Hetty shoved back a stray wisp of hair and glared at the man.  \"Now you listen to me, you young whippersnapper. I didn't invite you, but since you're here, you'll do me the goodness of being a mite more polite,\" she snapped.  The major winced and glanced at the senior scientist. The older man raised his eyes expressively and shrugged. He moved to the table and sat down. There was a general scuffling of chairs and the rest of the group took places around the big table. Johnny and Barney took their usual flanking positions beside Hetty at the head of the board.  Hetty took her seat and looked around the table with a pleased smile. \"Now that's more like it.\"  She bowed her head and, after a startled glance, the strangers followed suit.  \"We thank Thee, dear Lord,\" Hetty said quietly, \"for this food which we are about to eat and for all Your help to us this day. It's been a little rough in spots but I reckon You've got Your reasons for all of it. Seein' as how tomorrow is Your day anyway, we ask that it be just a mite quieter. Amen.\"  The satisfying clatter of chinaware and silver and polite muttered requests for more potatoes and gravy filled the kitchen for the next quarter of an hour as the hungry men went to work on the prime Circle T yearling beef.                       *      *      *      *      *  After his second steak, third helping of potatoes and gravy and fourth cup of coffee, the senior scientist contentedly shoved back from the table. Hetty was polishing the last dabs of gravy from her plate with a scrap of bread. The scientist pulled a pipe and tobacco pouch from his pocket.  \"With your permission, m'am,\" he asked his hostess. Hetty grinned. \"For heaven's sake, fire it up, sonny. Big Jim--that was my husband--used to say that no meal could be said properly finished unless it had been smoked into position for digestion.\"  Several of the other men at the table followed suit with pipes, cigars and cigarettes. Hetty smiled benignly around the table and turned to the senior scientist.  \"What did you say your name was, sonny?\" she asked.  \"Dr. Floyd Peterson, Mrs. Thompson,\" he replied, \"and at forty-six years of age, I deeply thank you for that 'sonny'.\"  He reached for the stack of newspapers on the floor beside his chair and pushing back his plate, laid them on the table.  \"Now, Mrs. Thompson, let's get down to facts,\" he rapped the headlines with a knuckle. \"You have played hell with our schedule and I've got to have the answers soon before I have the full atomic commission and a congressional investigation breathing down my neck.  \"What did you use to make that junior grade earthquake?\"  \"Why, I've already told you more'n a dozen times, sonny,\" Hetty replied. \"It must of been the combination of them queer eggs and Sally's milk.\"  The brush-mustached major sipping his coffee, spluttered and choked. Beside him, the head of the AEC security force at Frenchman's Flat leaned forward.  \"Mrs. Thompson, I don't know what your motives are but until I find out, I'm deeply thankful that you gave those news hounds this ... this, butter and egg business,\" he said.  \"Milk and eggs,\" Hetty corrected him mildly.  \"Well, milk and eggs, then. But the time has ended for playing games. We must know what caused that explosion and you and Mr. Culpepper and Mr. Hatfield,\" he nodded to Johnny and Barney sitting beside Hetty, \"are the only ones who can tell us.\"  \"Already told you,\" Hetty repeated. Johnny hid a grin.  \"Look, Mrs. Thompson,\" Dr. Peterson said loudly and with ill-concealed exasperation, \"you created and set off an explosive force that dwarfed every test we've made at Frenchman's Flat in four years. The force of your explosive was apparently greater than that of a fair-sized atomic device and only our Pacific tests--and those of the Russians--have been any greater. Yet within a half hour or forty-five minutes after the blast there wasn't a trace of radiation at ground level, no aerial radiation and not one report of upper atmosphere contamination or fallout within a thousand miles.  \"Mrs. Thompson, I appeal to your patriotism. Your friends, your country, the free people of the world, need this invention of yours.\"  Hetty's eyes grew wide and then her features set in a mold of firm determination. Shoving back her chair and raising to stand stiffly erect and with chin thrust forward, she was every inch the True Pioneer Woman of the West.  \"I never thought of that,\" she said solemnly. \"By golly, if my country needs this like that, then by golly, my country's going to have it.\"  The officials leaned forward in anticipation.  \"You can have Sally's Cloverdale Marathon III and I don't want one cent for her, either. And you can take the hens, too.\"  There was a stunned silence and then the Army major strangled on a mouthful of coffee; the security man turned beet red in the face and Dr. Peterson's jaw bounced off his breastbone. Johnny, unable to hold back an explosion of laughter, dashed for the back porch and collapsed.                       *      *      *      *      *  The kitchen door slammed and Dr. Peterson stamped out on to the porch, pipe clamped between clenched teeth, his face black with anger and frustration. He ignored Johnny who was standing beside the rail wiping tears from his eyes. Culpepper recovered himself and walked over to the irate physicist.  \"Dr. Peterson you're a man of science,\" Johnny said, \"and a scientist is supposed to be willing to accept a fact and then, possibly determine the causes behind the fact after he recognizes what he sees. Isn't that so?\"  \"Now, look here,\" Peterson angrily swung around to face Johnny. \"I've taken all I intend to take from you people with your idiotic story. I don't intend to....\"  Johnny took the older man by the elbow and gently but firmly propelled him from the porch towards the barn. \"I don't intend to either insult your intelligence, Dr. Peterson, or attempt to explain what has happened here. But I do intend to show you what we know.\"  Bright floodlights illuminated the yard and a crew of soldiers were stringing telephone wires from the guarded front gate across the open space to the ranch house. Beyond the new barbed wire fence, there was an excited stir and rush for the wire as a sharp-eyed newsman spotted Johnny and the scientist crossing the yard. The two men ignored the shouted requests for more up-to-the-minute information as they walked into the barn. Johnny switched on the lights.  The lowing of the two prize Guernseys in the stalls at the right of the door changed to loud, plaintive bawling as the lights came on. Both cows were obviously in pain from their swollen and unmilked udders.  \"Seeing is believing. Doc?\" Johnny asked, pointing to the cows.  \"Seeing what?\" Peterson snapped.  \"I knew we were going to have some tall explaining to do when you fellows took over here,\" Johnny said, \"and, of course, I don't blame you one bit. That was some blast Hetty set off out there.\"  \"You don't know,\" Dr. Peterson murmured fearfully, \"you just don't know.\"  \"So,\" Johnny continued, \"I deliberately didn't milk these cows, so that you could see for yourself that we aren't lying. Now, mind you, I don't have the foggiest idea WHY this is happening, but I'm going to show you at least, WHAT happened.\"  He picked up a pair of milk buckets from a rack beside the door and walked towards the cow stalls, Peterson trailing. \"This.\" Johnny said, pointing to the larger of the two animals, \"is Queenie. Her milk is just about as fine as you can get from a champion milk producing line. And this,\" he reached over and patted the flank of the other cow, \"is Sally's Cloverdale Marathon III. She's young and up to now has given good but not spectacular quantities or qualities of milk. She's from the same blood line as Queenie. Sally had dried up from her first calf and we bred her again and on Wednesday she came fresh. Only it isn't milk that she's been giving. Watch!\"  Kicking a milking stool into position, he placed a bucket under Queenie's distended bag and began squirting the rich, foaming milk into the pail with a steady, fast and even rhythm. When he had finished, he set the two full buckets with their thick heads of milk foam, outside the stall and brought two more clean, empty buckets. He moved to the side of the impatient Sally. As Peterson watched, Johnny filled the buckets with the same, flat, oily-looking white fluid that Sally had been producing since Wednesday. The scientist began to show mild interest.  Johnny finished, stripped the cow, and then carried the pails out and set them down beside the first two.  \"O.K., now look them over yourself,\" he told Peterson.  The scientist peered into the buckets. Johnny handed him a ladle.  \"Look, Culpepper,\" Peterson said, \"I'm a physicist, not a farmer or an agricultural expert. How do you expect me to know what milk is supposed to do? Until I was fifteen years old, I thought the milk came out of one of those spigots and the cream out of another.\"  \"Stir it,\" Johnny ordered. The scientist took the ladle angrily and poked at the milk in Queenie's buckets.  \"Taste "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24119"],["title","Make Mine Homogenized (#6)"],["body","it,\" Johnny said. Peterson glared at the younger man and then took a careful sip of the milk. Some of the froth clung to his lips and he licked it off. \"Taste like milk to me,\" he said.  \"Smell it,\" Johnny ordered. Peterson sniffed.  \"O.K., now do the same things to the other buckets.\"  Peterson swished the ladle through the buckets containing Sally's milk. The white liquid swirled sluggishly and oillike. He bent over and smelled and made a grimace.  \"Go on,\" Johnny demanded, \"taste it.\"  Peterson took a tiny sip, tasted and then spat.  \"All right,\" he said, \"I'm now convinced that there's something different about this milk. I'm not saying anything is wrong with it because I wouldn't know. All I'm admitting is that it is different. So what?\"                       *      *      *      *      *  \"Come on,\" Johnny took the ladle from him. He carried the buckets of Queenie's milk into the cooler room and dumped them in a small pasturizer.  Then carrying the two pails of Sally's milk, Johnny and the physicist left the barn and went to the shattered remains of the tractor shed.  Fumbling under wrecked and overturned tables and workbenches, Johnny found an old and rusted pie tin.  Placing the tin in the middle of the open spaces of the yard, he turned to Peterson. \"Now you take that pail of milk and pour a little into the pan. Not much, now, just about enough to cover the bottom or a little more.\" He again handed the ladle to Peterson.  The scientist dipped out a small quantity of the white fluid and carefully poured it into the pie plate.  \"That's enough,\" Johnny cautioned. \"Now let's set these buckets a good long ways from here.\" He picked up the buckets and carried them to the back porch. He vanished into the kitchen.  By this time, the strange antics of the two men had attracted the attention of the clamoring newsmen outside the fence and they jammed against the wire, shouting pleas for an interview or information. The network television camera crews trained their own high-powered lights into the yard to add to the brilliance of the military lights and began recording the scene. Dr. Peterson glared angrily at the mob and turned as Johnny rejoined him. \"Culpepper, are you trying to make a fool of me?\" he hissed.  \"Got a match?\" Johnny queried, ignoring the question. The pipe-smoking scientist pulled out a handful of kitchen matches. Johnny produced a glass fish casting rod with a small wad of cloth tied to the weighted hook. Leading Peterson back across the yard about fifty feet, Johnny handed the rag to Peterson.  \"Smell it,\" he said. \"I put a little kerosene on it so it would burn when it goes through the air.\" Peterson nodded.  \"You much of a fisherman?\" Johnny asked.  \"I can drop a fly on a floating chip at fifty yards,\" the physicist said proudly. Johnny handed him the rod and reel. \"O.K., Doc, light up your rag and then let's see you drop it in that pie plate.\"  While TV cameras hummed and dozens of still photographers pointed telescopic lenses and prayed for enough light, Dr. Peterson ignited the little wad of cloth. He peered behind to check for obstructions and then, with the wrist-flicking motion of the devoted and expert fisherman, made his cast. The tiny torch made a blurred, whipping streak of light and dropped unerringly into the pie plate in the middle of the yard.  The photographers had all the light they needed!  The night turned violet as a violent ball of purple fire reared and boiled into the darkened sky. The flash bathed the entire ranch headquarters and the packed cars and throngs outside the fence in the strange brilliance. The heat struck the dumfounded scientist and young rancher like the suddenly-opened door of a blast furnace.  It was over in a second as the fire surged and then winked out. The sudden darkness blinded them despite the unchanged power of the television and military floodlights still focused on the yard. Pandemonium erupted from the ranks of newsmen and photographers who had witnessed the dazzling demonstration.  Peterson stared in awe at the slightly smoking and warped pie tin. \"Well, cut out my tongue and call me Oppenheimer,\" he exclaimed.  \"That was just the milk,\" Johnny said. \"You know of a good safe place we could try it out with one of those eggs? I'd be afraid to test 'em anywhere around here after what happened to Hetty this morning.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  An hour later, a military helicopter chewed its way into the night, carrying three gallons of Sally's milk from the ranch to Nellis AFB where a jet stood ready to relay the sealed cannister to the AEC laboratories at Albuquerque.  In the ranch house living room Peterson had set up headquarters and an Army field telephone switchboard was in operation across the room.  An AEC security man was running the board. Hetty had decided that one earthquake a day was enough and had gone to bed. Barney bewildered but happily pleased at so much company, sat on the edge of a chair and avidly watched and listened, not understanding a thing he saw or heard. At the back of the room, Johnny hunched over Big Jim Thompson's roll-top desk, working up a list of supplies he would need to repair the damages from the week's growing list of explosions.  Peterson and three of his staff members were in lengthy consultation at a big table in the middle of the room. The Army field phone at Peterson's elbow jangled.  Across the room, the switchboard operator swung around and called: \"It's the commissioner, Dr. Peterson. I just got through to him.\" Peterson picked up the phone.  \"John,\" he shouted into the instrument, \"Peterson here. Where have you been?\" Tinny, audible squawks came from the phone and Peterson held it away from his ear.  \"Yes, I know all about it,\" he said. \"Yes ... yes ... yes. I know you've had a time with the papers. Yes, I heard the radio. Yes, John, I know it sounds pretty ridiculous. What? Get up to the ranch and find out. Where do you think I'm calling from?\"  The squawking rattled the receiver and Peterson winced.  \"Look, commissioner,\" he broke in, \"I can't put a stop to those stories. What? I said I can't put a stop to the stories for one reason. They're true.\"  The only sound that came from the phone was the steady hum of the line.  \"Are you there, John?\" Peterson asked. There was an indistinct mumble from Washington. \"Now listen carefully, John. What I need out here just as quickly as you can round them up and get them aboard a plane is the best team of biogeneticists in the country.  \"What? No, I don't need a team of psychiatrists, commissioner. I am perfectly normal.\" Peterson paused. \"I think!\"  He talked with his chief for another fifteen minutes. At two other telephones around the big table, his chief deputy and the senior security officer of the task force handled a half dozen calls during Peterson's lengthy conversation. When Peterson hung up, the machinery was in motion gathering the nation's top biochemists, animal geneticists, agricultural and animal husbandry experts and a baker's dozen of other assorted -ists, ready to package and ship them by plane and train to the main AEC facility at Frenchman's Flat and to the Circle T.  Peterson sighed gustily as he laid down the phone and reached for his pipe. Across the table, his assistant put a hand over the mouthpiece of his telephone and leaned towards Peterson.  \"It's the Associated Press in New York,\" he whispered. \"They're hotter than a pistol about the blackout and threatening to call the President and every congressman in Washington if we don't crack loose with something.\"  \"Why couldn't I have flunked Algebra Two,\" Peterson moaned. \"No, I had to be a genius. Now look at me. A milkmaid.\" He looked at his watch. \"Tell 'em we'll hold a press conference at 8:00 a.m. outside the ranch gate.\"  The assistant spoke briefly into the phone and again turned to Peterson. \"They say they want to know now whether the milk and egg story is true. They say they haven't had anything but an official runaround and a lot of rumor.\"  \"Tell them we neither deny nor confirm the story. Say we are investigating. We'll give them a formal statement in the morning,\" Peterson ordered.  He left the table and walked to the desk where Johnny was finishing his list of building supplies.  \"What time do you usually get those eggs?\" he asked.  \"Well, as a rule, Hetty gets out and gathers them up about nine each morning. But they've probably been laid a couple of hours earlier.  \"That's going to make us awfully late to produce anything for those babbling reporters,\" the scientist said.  \"Come to think of it,\" Johnny said thoughtfully, \"we could rig up a light in the chicken house and make the hens lay earlier. That way you could have some eggs about four or five o'clock in the morning.\"  Barney had been listening.  \"And them eggs make a mighty fine breakfast of a morning,\" he volunteered cheerfully. Peterson glared at him and Johnny grinned.  \"I think the doctor wants the golden kind,\" he said with a smile.  \"Oh, them,\" Barney said with a snort of disgust. \"They wouldn't make an omelet fit for a hog. You don't want to fuss with them, doc.\"                       *      *      *      *      *  Under Johnny's direction, a crew of technicians ran a power line into the slightly-wrecked chicken house. There were loud squawks of indignation from the sleeping hens as the men threaded their way through the nests. The line was installed and the power applied. A one-hundred-fifty-watt bulb illuminated the interior of the chicken house to the discordant clucking and cackling of the puzzled birds.  Solomon, the big rooster, was perched on a crossbeam, head tucked under his wing. When the light flooded the shed he jerked awake and fastened a startled and unblinking stare at the strange sun. He scrambled hastily and guiltily to his feet and throwing out his great chest, crowed a shrieking hymn to Thomas A. Edison. Johnny chuckled as the technicians jumped at the sound."]]]
