Dr. HALL, who read the impressive service of the Episcopal Church. A number of the members of the family, and of the friends of the deceased, were present during the services.  The funeral cortege proceeded from the hall to the depot of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.  The following gentlemen were designated to act as pall-bearers on the occasion:  Mr. Ewing, Mr. Hitchcock, Mr. Chase, Mr. Loomis, Mr. Backus, Mr. Wolcott, Mr. Sherman, Mr. Vinton, Mr. Groesbeck, Mr. Stanton, Mr. Harlan, Mr. Gurley.  The proceedings upon the death of Judge WRIGHT were, by the Conference, ordered to be published, and the special session closed.     NINTH DAY.  WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, _February 15th, 1861._   The Convention was called to order by President TYLER, and prayer was offered by Rev. Mr. RENNER. The Journals of the 13th and 14th were read and approved.  The PRESIDENT:--I have this morning received several communications from different persons, which will be laid before the Convention. One is an invitation from HORATIO STONE, inviting the members of the Convention to visit his studio; also, a resolution of the House of Representatives, authorizing the admission of members of this Convention to the floor of the House. Also, a letter from J.E. SANDS, offering to the Convention certain flags which possess historical interest, from the fact that they were used in the convention which adopted the present Constitution of the United States. Also, a communication from HORATIO G. WARNER.  The communications were severally read and laid upon the table.  Mr. SUMMERS:--I am instructed by the Committee on Credentials to inform the Convention that the committee has received satisfactory evidence of the appointment by the Executive of Ohio of C.P. WOLCOTT, as a delegate to this Convention, in the place of JOHN C. WRIGHT, deceased.  Mr. ORTH:--I desire to offer the following resolutions, which I ask to have read for the information of the Convention. I have no purpose to admit spectators to seats on this floor, but in my judgment it is the right of the country to know what we are doing here. My constituents will not be satisfied with my course, unless I take means to give the public knowledge of all our transactions. I am aware that this is an invasion of the rule already adopted, requiring secrecy, but in my opinion no possible harm can come from the daily publication of our debates. It is far better that true reports of these debates should be made, than that the distorted and perverted accounts which we see daily in the New York papers should be continued.  The resolutions were read, and are as follows:       _Resolved_, That Rules Sixteen (16) and Eighteen (18) of      this Convention be, and the same hereby are, rescinded.       _Resolved_, That the President is hereby authorized to grant      cards of admission to reporters of the press, not exceeding      ---- in number, which shall entitle them to seats on the      floor of the Convention, for the purpose of reporting its      proceedings.       _Resolved_, That no person be admitted to the floor of the      Convention, except the members, officers, or reporters.  Mr. WICKLIFFE:--I do not wish to prolong this discussion myself, nor to cause it to be prolonged by others. I am sure that if we permit our debates to be reported, we shall never reach a conclusion which will in the slightest degree benefit the country. Every member will in that event wish to make a set speech, some of them three or four. I wish to have our time used in consultation and in action, not consumed in political speech-making. I do not care what the newspapers say of us. I know their accounts are distorted; but they would be distorted if we admitted reporters. Some of them assail us as a convention of compromisers--as belonging to the sandstone stratum of politics.  Mr. CHASE:--That is the formation which supports all others.  Mr. WICKLIFFE:--I know it, and I hope this Convention will prove to be the stratum which supports and preserves the Union and the country. Let us go on as we have begun, preserving secrecy; keeping our own counsels; making no speeches for outside consumption or personal reputation. Let us all keep steadily in mind the accomplishment of the great and good purpose which brought us here, and nothing else.  Mr. RANDOLPH:--New Jersey does not wish to have time consumed in making speeches. I think we should proceed at once to hear the report of the committee. I move that the resolutions offered be laid upon the table.  Mr. ORTH:--I suppose this motion cuts off debate. I should much have preferred to discuss the resolutions. I hope the motion will not prevail.  The motion to lay on the table passed in the affirmative by a _viva voce_ vote.  The PRESIDENT:--Is the General Committee upon Propositions prepared to report? If it is, their report is now in order.  Mr. GUTHRIE:--That committee has given earnest and careful consideration to the subjects and propositions which have from time to time been presented to it. It has held numerous and protracted sessions, and the differences of opinion naturally existing between the members have been discussed in a spirit of candor and conciliation. The committee have not been so fortunate as to arrive at an unanimous conclusion. A majority of its members, however, have agreed upon a report which we think ought to be satisfactory to all sections of the Union, one which if adopted will, we believe, accomplish the purpose so much desired by every patriotic citizen. We think it will give peace to the country. In their behalf I have now the honor to submit, for the consideration of the Conference, the following:       PROPOSALS OF AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED      STATES.       ARTICLE 1. In all the territory of the United States not      embraced within the limits of the Cherokee treaty grant,      north of a line from east to west on the parallel of 36      degrees 30 minutes north latitude, involuntary servitude,      except in punishment of crime, is prohibited whilst it shall      be under a Territorial government; and in all the territory      south of said line, the status of persons owing service or      labor, as it now exists, shall not be changed by law while      such territory shall be under a Territorial government; and      neither Congress nor the Territorial government shall have      power to hinder or prevent the taking to said territory of      persons held to labor or involuntary service, within the      United States, according to the laws or usages of the State      from which such persons may be taken, nor to impair the      rights arising out of said relations, which shall be subject      to judicial cognizance in the federal courts, according to      the common law; and when any territory north or south of      said line, within such boundary as Congress may prescribe,      shall contain a population required for a member of      Congress, according to the then federal ratio of      representation, it shall, if its form of government be      republican, be admitted into the Union on an equal footing      with the original States, with or without involuntary      service or labor, as the Constitution of such new State may      provide.       ARTICLE 2. Territory shall not be acquired by the United      States, unless by treaty; nor, except for naval and      commercial stations and depots, unless such treaty shall be      ratified by four-fifths of all members of the Senate.       ARTICLE 3. Neither the Constitution, nor any amendment      thereof, shall be construed to give Congress power to      regulate, abolish, or control within any State or Territory      of the United States, the relation established or recognized      by the laws thereof touching persons bound to labor or      involuntary service therein, nor to interfere with or      abolish involuntary service in the District of Columbia      without the consent of Maryland and without the consent of      the owners, or making the owners who do not consent just      compensation; nor the power to interfere with or prohibit      representatives and others from bringing with them to the      City of Washington, retaining, and taking away, persons so      bound to labor; nor the power to interfere with or abolish      involuntary service in places under the exclusive      jurisdiction of the United States within those States and      Territories where the same is established or recognized; nor      the power to prohibit the removal or transportation, by      land, sea, or river, of persons held to labor or involuntary      service in any State or Territory of the United States to      any other State or Territory thereof where it is established      or recognized by law or usage; and the right during      transportation of touching at ports, shores, and landings,      and of landing in case of distress, shall exist. Nor shall      Congress have power to authorize any higher rate of taxation      on persons bound to labor than on land.       ARTICLE 4. The third paragraph of the second section of the      fourth article of the Constitution shall not be construed to      prevent any of the States, by appropriate legislation, and      through the action of their judicial and ministerial      officers, from enforcing the delivery of fugitives from      labor to the person to whom such service or labor is due.       ARTICLE 5. The foreign slave-trade and the importation of      slaves into the United States and their Territories, from      places beyond the present limits thereof, are forever      prohibited.       ARTICLE 6. The first, second, third, and fifth articles,      together with this article of these amendments, and the      third paragraph of the second section of the first article      of the Constitution, and the third paragraph of the second      section of the fourth article thereof, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24562"],["title","The Panjab, North-West Frontier Province, and Kashmir (#0)"],["body","Note: Project Gutenberg also has an HTML version of this       file which includes the original illustrations and maps.

THE PANJAB, NORTH-WEST FRONTIER PROVINCE AND KASHMIR  by  SIR JAMES DOUIE, M.A., K.C.S.I.        Seema Publications Seema Publications C-3/19, R. P. Bagh, Delhi-110007. First Indian Edition 1974  Printed in India at Deluxe Offset Press, Daya Basti, Delhi-110035 and Published by Seema Publications, Delhi-110007.     EDITOR'S PREFACE   In his opening chapter Sir James Douie refers to the fact that the area treated in this volume--just one quarter of a million square miles--is comparable to that of Austria-Hungary. The comparison might be extended; for on ethnographical, linguistic and physical grounds, the geographical unit now treated is just as homogeneous in composition as the Dual Monarchy. It is only in the political sense and by force of the ruling classes, temporarily united in one monarch, that the term _Osterreichisch_ could be used to include the Poles of Galicia, the Czechs of Bohemia and Moravia, the Szeklers, Saxons and more numerous Rumanians of Transylvania, the Croats, Slovenes and Italians of \"Illyria,\" with the Magyars of the Hungarian plain.  The term _Punjábi_ much more nearly, but still imperfectly, covers the people of the Panjáb, the North-West Frontier Province, Kashmír and the associated smaller Native States. The Sikh, Muhammadan and Hindu Jats, the Kashmírís and the Rájputs all belong to the tall, fair, leptorrhine Indo-Aryan main stock of the area, merging on the west and south-west into the Biluch and Pathán Turko-Iranian, and fringed in the hill districts on the north with what have been described as products of the \"contact metamorphism\" with the Mongoloid tribes of Central Asia. Thus, in spite of the inevitable blurring of boundary lines, the political divisions treated together in this volume, form a fairly clean-cut geographical unit.  Sir James Douie, in this work, is obviously living over again the happy thirty-five years which he devoted to the service of North-West India: his accounts of the physiography, the flora and fauna, the people and the administration are essentially the personal recollections of one who has first studied the details as a District Officer and has afterwards corrected his perspective, stage by stage, from the successively higher view-point of a Commissioner, the Chief Secretary, Financial Commissioner, and finally as Officiating Lieut.-Governor. No one could more appropriately undertake the task of an accurate and well-proportioned thumb-nail sketch of North-West India and, what is equally important to the earnest reader, no author could more obviously delight in his subject.    T. H. H.    ALDERLEY EDGE,    _March 9th, 1916._     NOTE BY AUTHOR   My thanks are due to the Government of India for permission to use illustrations contained in official publications. Except where otherwise stated the numerous maps included in the volume are derived from this source. My obligations to provincial and district gazetteers have been endless. Sir Thomas Holdich kindly allowed me to reproduce some of the charts in his excellent book on _India_. The accuracy of the sections on geology and coins may be relied on, as they were written by masters of these subjects, Sir Thomas Holland and Mr R. B. Whitehead, I.C.S. Chapter XVII could not have been written at all without the help afforded by Mr Vincent Smith's _Early History of India_. I have acknowledged my debts to other friends in the \"List of Illustrations.\"    J. M. D.    _8 May 1916._     CONTENTS     CHAP.
