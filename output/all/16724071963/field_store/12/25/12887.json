She became vexed with him and cried out, \"Ho, Kalopaling, come and take this fretful boy away!\"  At once the door opened and Kalopaling came hobbling in on his clumsy feet, which were made for swimming and not for walking. The woman put the boy into the large hood, in which he was completely hidden. Then the Kalopaling disappeared as suddenly as he had come.  By and by the Inuit caught more seals than usual and gave her plenty of meat. Then she was sorry that she had given her grandson away, and was more than ever sorry that it was to Kalopaling she had given him. She thought how much of the time he must have to stay in the water with that strange man-like animal. She wept about it, and begged the Inuit to help her get him back.  Some of them said they had seen the boy sitting by a crack in the ice, playing with a whip of seaweed, but none of them knew how to get him. Finally one of the hunters and his wife said, \"We may never succeed, but we will see what we can do.\"  The water had frozen into thick ice, and the rise and fall of the tide had broken long cracks not far from the shore. Every day the boy used to rise out of the water and sit alongside the cracks, playing, and watching the fish swim down below.  Kalopaling was afraid someone might carry the boy away, so he fastened him to a string of seaweed, the other end of which he kept in his hand. The hunter and his wife watched for the boy to come out, and when they saw him they went toward him. But the boy did not want to go back to live with his grandmother, and as they came near he called out:  \"Two men are coming; one with a double jacket, the other with a foxskin jacket.\"  Then Kalopaling pulled on the string and the boy disappeared into the water.  Some time after this the hunter and his wife saw the boy again. But before they could lay hold of him the lad sang out:  \"Two men are coming.\"  And again Kalopaling pulled the string and the boy slipped into the water.  However, the hunter and his wife did not give up trying. They went near the crack and hid behind the big blocks of ice which the tide had piled up. The next time when the boy had just come out they sprang forward and cut the rope before he had time to give the alarm. Then away they went with him to their hut.  As the lad did not wish to return to his grandmother, he stayed with the hunter, and as he grew to be a man he learned all that his new father could teach him, and became the most famous hunter of the tribe.     V  THE WOMAN MAGICIAN   Long ago, in Aggo, a country where nobody lives nowadays, there were two large houses standing far apart. In each of these houses many families lived together. In the summer the people in the two houses went in company to hunt deer and had a good time together. When fall came they returned to their separate houses. The names of the houses were Quern and Exaluq.  One summer it happened that the men from Quern had killed many deer, while those from Exaluq had caught but a few. The latter said to each other, \"They are not fair; they shoot before we have a chance;\" and they became very angry.  \"Let us kill them,\" said one.  \"Yes, let us kill them, but let us wait till the end of the season, and then we can take all the game they have in their storehouse,\" said the others. For the game was packed in snow and ice and was taken home on dog sledges when the hunting was over.  When it came time to go home both parties agreed to go on a certain day to the storehouses and pack up the game ready to start early in the morning. This was the time for which the men of Exaluq had been waiting.  They started off all together with their sledges, but when they got a long distance from the camp and very near to the storehouse, those from Exaluq suddenly fell upon the others and slew them, for the men from Quern had never suspected that there was any ill-feeling.  Fearing that if the dogs went back to camp without their masters, the women and children would guess what had happened, they killed the dogs also. When they returned, they told the women that their husbands had separated from them and had gone off over a hill, and they did not know what had become of them.  Now one of the young men had married a girl from Quern, and he went to her house that night as usual, and she received him kindly, for she believed what she had heard about the men of her party straying off. She and all the other women thought the men would soon find their way back, as they had hunted in these parts so long that they knew the land.  But in the house was the girl's little brother who had seen the husband come in; and after everybody was asleep he heard the spirits of the murdered men calling and he recognized their voices. They told him what had happened, and asked the boy to kill the young man in revenge for their deaths. So he crept from under the bed and thrust a knife into the young man's breast.  Then he awakened all the women and children in the great row of huts and told them that the spirits of the dead men had come to him and told of their murder, and had ordered him to avenge them by killing the young man.  \"Oh, what shall we do? What shall we do?\" they cried. \"They have killed our men and they will kill us!\" They were terribly frightened.  \"We must fly from here before the men from Exaluq awaken and learn that the young man is slain in revenge,\" said one of the old women.  \"But how can we fly? Our dogs are dead, and we cannot travel fast enough to escape.\"  \"I will attend to that,\" said the old woman. In her hut was a litter of pups, and as she was a conjurer, she said to them, \"Grow up at once.\" She had no fairy wand to wave over them, but she waved a stick, and after waving it once the dogs[1] were half-grown. She waved it again, saying, \"Be full-grown instantly;\" and they were.  They harnessed the dogs at once, and in order to deceive their enemies they left everything in the huts and even left their lights burning, so that when the men arose in the morning they would think that they, too, had arisen and were dressing.  When it had come full daylight next morning the men of Exaluq wondered why the young man did not come back to them, and presently they went to find out. They peeked into the spy-hole of the window and saw the lamps burning, but no people inside the hut. They discovered the body of the dead man, and then when they looked they saw the tracks of sledges.  They wondered very much how the women could have gone away on sledges, since they had no dogs, and they feared some other people had helped them to get off. They hastily harnessed their own dogs and started in pursuit of the fugitives.  The women whipped their dogs and journeyed rapidly, but the pursuers had older and tougher animals and were likely to overtake them soon. They became very much frightened, fearing that they would all be killed in revenge for the death of the young man.  When the sledge of the men drew near and the women and children saw that they could not escape, the boy who had slain the man said to the old woman:  \"The spirits of our murdered men are calling to us to cut the ice. Cannot you cut it?\"  \"I think I can,\" she answered, and she slowly drew her first finger across the path of the pursuers, muttering a magic charm as she did so.  The ice gave a terrific crack, and the water came gushing through the crevasse. They sped on, and presently she drew another line with her finger, and another crack opened and the ice between the two cracks broke up and the floe began to move.  The men, dashing ahead with all speed, could scarcely stop their dog team in time to escape falling into the open water. The floe was so wide and so long that it was impossible for them to cross, and thus the women and children were saved by the art of their conjurer.   FOOTNOTES:  [1] The actual statement both here and on page 39 is that the woman and the Man in the Moon beat the pups and the boy with sticks to make them grow. Is not our birthday beating, \"one for each year and one to grow on\" a survival of this ancient superstition?     VI  THE BIRD WIFE   Itajung, one of the Inuit tribe, was vexed because a young woman would not marry him, so he left his home and traveled far away into the land of the birds. He came to a small lake in which many geese were swimming. On the shore he saw a great many boots. He cautiously crept near and stole a pair and hid them.  Presently the birds came out of the water, and finding a pair of boots gone they were alarmed, and quickly forming into two long lines with their leader at the point where the lines met, they flew away crying, \"_Honk! Honk! Honk!_\"  But one of the flock remained behind crying, \"I want my boots! I want my boots!\"  Itajung came forth from his hiding-place and said, \"I will give you your boots if you will become my wife.\"  \"That I will not do,\" she replied.  \"Very well,\" he said, and turned around to go away.  \"I don't want to, but I will be your wife if you will bring back my boots,\" she called.  He came back and gave her the boots, and when she put them on she was changed into a woman.  They walked away together, and wandered down to the seaside and, as she liked to live near the water, they settled in a large village by the sea. Here they lived for several years and had a son. Itajung became a highly respected man, for he was by far the best whaler in all the Inuit tribe.  One day they killed a whale and were busy cutting it up and carrying the meat and blubber to their homes. Many of the women were helping, but though Itajung was working very hard, his wife stood lazily looking on.  \"Come and help us,\" he called to her.  \"My food is not from the sea,\" she replied. \"My food is from the land. I will not eat the meat of a whale; neither will I help.\"  \"You must eat it; it will fill your stomach,\" said he.  She began to cry, and said, \"I will not eat it. I will not soil my nice white clothing.\"  She went to the beach and searched for feathers. When"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24569"],["title","A Treasury of Eskimo Tales (#3)"],["body","found some, she put them between her fingers and the fingers of her child. They were both turned into geese and flew away. When the Inuit saw this they cried, \"Itajung, your wife is flying away.\"  Itajung became very sad. He no longer cared for the meat and blubber, nor for the whales spouting near the shore. He followed in the direction his wife had taken, and went over all the land in search of her.  After traveling for many weary months, he came to a river where a man with a large axe was chopping chips from a piece of wood, and as fast as he chopped them they were turned into salmon and slipped out of the man's hands into the river and swam down to a large lake near by. The name of the man was Small Salmon.  As Itajung looked at the man he was frightened almost to death; for the back of the man was entirely hollow, and Itajung could see right through him and out at the other side. He was so scared that he kept very still and crept back and away out around him. He wanted to ask if the man had seen his wife, for that was what he asked everyone he came to. So he went around and came from the opposite direction, facing the man.  When Small Salmon saw him approaching he stopped chopping and asked, \"Which way did you approach me?\"  \"I came from that direction,\" said Itajung, pointing in the way he had last approached.  \"That is lucky for you, for if you had come the other way and had seen my back, I should have killed you at once with my hatchet.\"  \"I am glad I don't have to die,\" said Itajung. \"But haven't you seen my wife? She left me and came this way.\"  \"Yes, I saw her. Do you see that little island in the large lake? That is where she lives now, and she has taken another husband.\"  \"Oh, I can never reach her,\" said Itajung in despair. \"I have no boat and do not know how to reach the island.\"  \"I will help you,\" said Small Salmon kindly. \"Come down to the beach with me. Here is the backbone of a salmon. Now shut your eyes. The backbone will turn into a kayak and carry you safely to the island. But mind you keep your eyes shut. If you open them the kayak will upset.\"  \"I will obey,\" said Itajung.  He closed his eyes, the backbone became a kayak, and away he sped over the water. He heard no splashing and was anxious to know if he really was moving, so he peeped open his eyes a trifle.  At once the boat began to swing violently, but he quickly shut his eyes, and it went on steadily, and he soon landed on the island.  There he saw a hut and his son playing on the beach near it. The boy on looking up saw and recognized him, and ran to his mother, crying:  \"Mother, Father is here and is coming to our hut.\"  \"Go back to your play,\" she said; \"your father is far away and cannot find us.\"  The lad went back, but again he ran in, saying:  \"Mother, Father is here and is coming to our hut.\"  Again she sent him away; but he soon returned, saying: \"Father is right here.\"  He had scarcely said it when Itajung opened the door. When the new husband saw him he said to his wife, \"Open that box in the corner of the hut.\"  She did so, and a great quantity of feathers flew out and stuck fast to them. The hut disappeared. The woman, her new husband, and the child were transformed into geese and flew away, leaving Itajung standing alone.     VII  THE SPIRIT OF THE SINGING HOUSE   The singing house of an Eskimo village is used also for feasting and dancing, and always has a spirit owner who is supposed to remain in it all the time. Once a woman was curious about this spirit and wanted to see it. For a long time she had wanted to know more about this spirit of the singing house, but the villagers warned her that she would meet with a terrible fate if she persisted in trying to see it.  One night she could wait no longer, and went into the house when it was quite dark so the villagers would not see her go. When she had entered she said:  \"If you are in the house, come here.\"  As she could see and hear nothing, she cried, \"No spirit is here; he will not come.\"  \"Here I am; there I am,\" said a hoarse whisper.  \"Where are your feet?\" she asked, for she could not see him.  \"Here they are; there they are,\" said the voice.  \"Where are your shins?\" she asked.  \"Here they are; there they are,\" it whispered.  As she could not see anything, she felt of him with her hands to make sure he was there, and when she touched his knees she found that he was a bandy-legged man with knees bent outward and forward. She kept on asking, \"Where are your hips? Where are your shoulders? Where is your neck?\" And each time the voice answered, \"Here it is; there it is.\"  At last she asked, \"Where is your head?\"  \"Here it is; there it is,\" the spirit whispered, hoarsely.  But as the woman touched the head, all of a sudden she fell dead. _It had no bones and no hair._     VIII  THE TORNIT   In olden times the Inuit were not the only tribe living in the Eskimo country. Around Cumberland Sound there lived some very large, strong people called the Tornit. They were on good terms with the Inuit and shared the same hunting ground, but lived in separate villages. They were much taller than the Inuit and had very long legs and arms, but their eyes were not as good.  They were so strong that they could lift large boulders which were far too heavy for the Inuit, though the latter were much stronger in those days than they now are. Some of the stones which they used to throw are lying about the country still, and the toughest of the men now living cannot lift them, much less swing and throw them. Some of their stone houses also remain. They generally lived in these houses all winter, and did not cover them with snow to make them warmer.  The principal part of their winter dress was a long, wide coat of deerskins, reaching to the knees and trimmed with leather straps. They ate walrus, deer, and seal, and when they went sealing in the winter they fastened the lower edge of their coat to the snow by means of pegs. Under the coat they carried a small lamp, over which to melt snow when they were thirsty, and over which to roast some of the seal meat. They sat around a hole in the ice and watched for their prey, and when a seal blew in the hole they whispered, \"I shall stab it.\" Sometimes in their eagerness they forgot the lamp and upset it as they threw the harpoon, and thus got burned.  Their strength was so great that they could hold a harpooned walrus as easily as the Inuit could hold a seal. These weaker men did not like to play ball with them, for they did not realize how rough they were and often hurt their playfellows severely. This the playfellows tried to take in good part, and the two lived on friendly terms except for one thing. For some reason the Tornit did not make kayaks for themselves, although they saw how convenient they were for hunting when the ice broke up in the spring. Every little while they would steal a boat from the Inuit, who did not dare fight for their property because the thieves were so much stronger.  This rankled in the hearts of the Inuit and they would talk among themselves and threaten to take vengeance on the robbers. They debated what they should do either to get rid of the Tornit or to make them cease their depredations. This state of affairs had gone on till the Inuit were at fever heat, when one day a young Tornit took the boat of a young Inuit without asking, and in sealing with it, he ran it into some blocks of floating ice which stove in the bottom. The owner nursed his wrath until night, and then when the thief was asleep he slipped into the tent and thrust his knife into the Tornit's neck.  The Tornit tribe had been aware of the growing dislike, and when at last one of the Inuit took revenge, they feared that others might do the same and in similar secret fashion; so they decided to leave the country. In order to deceive their neighbors, they cut off the tails of their long coats and tied their hair in bunches that stuck out behind to look like a strange people as they fled.  Then they stole away, and the Inuit were so glad they were gone that they made no effort to pursue them.     IX  THE FLIGHT TO THE MOON   A powerful conjurer, who had a bear for his mascot, thought he would like to go to the Moon. He had his hands tied up and a rope fastened around his knees and neck. Then he sat down at the rear of his hut with his back to the lamps and had the light extinguished.  He called for his mascot, and the bear at once appeared and he mounted its back. Up it carried him, above the village, above the mountains, up and up till they reached the Moon. To his surprise, the Moon was a _house_ which was covered with beautiful white deerskins. Now white deer are strange and sacred and are hatched from long white eggs buried deep in the soil. There is mystery and magic in white deer, white buffalo, and in all albino animals. The Man in the Moon dried these white deerskins and fastened them over his house, which, as I said, is the Moon itself.  On each side of the door to the house was the upper part of an enormous walrus. The beasts were alive, and they threatened to tear the visitor in pieces. It was very dangerous to try to pass the fierce animals, but the conjurer told his mascot to growl as loud as it could, and that startled the walruses for an instant, and in that instant the man slipped in.  It must be chilly in the Moon, for the house had a passageway to keep out the cold, just as the Eskimo houses have. In this passageway was a red-and-white spotted dog, the only dog which the Man in the Moon keeps. The man went on past this dog and into the inner room. There at the left he saw a door into another building in which sat a beautiful woman with a lamp before her. As soon as she saw the stranger she blew on her fire and made it flash up, and she hid behind the blaze; but he had seen enough so that he knew she was the Sun.  The Man in the Moon rose from his seat on the ledge and came over to shake hands with the visitor and welcome him."]]]
