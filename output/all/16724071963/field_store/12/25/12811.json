It was piled with books and documents, while a great deal of the space was occupied by square pieces of cardboard, upon each of which was a name in large letters, while underneath was writing in very minute characters.  With a benevolent gesture, Mascarin pointed to an armchair, and in encouraging tones said, “And now let us talk.”  It was plain to Paul that Mascarin was not acting, but that the kind and patriarchal expression upon his face was natural to it, and the young man felt that he could safely intrust his whole future to him.  “I have heard,” commenced Mascarin, “that your means of livelihood are very precarious, or rather that you have none, and are ready to take the first one that offers you a means of subsistence. That, at least, is what I hear from my poor friend Tantaine.”  “He has explained my case exactly.”  “Good; only before proceeding to the future, let us speak of the past.”  Paul gave a start, which Mascarin noticed, for he added,--  “You will excuse the freedom I am taking; but it is absolutely necessary that I should know to what I am binding myself. Tantaine tells me that you are a charming young man, strictly honest, and well educated; and now that I have had the pleasure of meeting you, I am sure that he is right; but I can only deal with proofs, and must be quite certain before I act on your behalf with third parties.”  “I have nothing to conceal, sir, and am ready to answer any questions,”  responded Paul.  A slight smile, which Paul did not detect, played round the corners of Mascarin’s mouth, and, with a gesture, with which all who knew him were familiar, he pushed back his glasses on his nose.  “I thank you,” answered he; “it is not so easy as you may suppose to hide anything from me.” He took one of the packets of pasteboard slips form his desk, and shuffling them like a pack of cards, continued, “Your name is Marie Paul Violaine. You were born at Poitiers, in the Rue des Vignes, on the 5th of January, 1843, and are therefore in your twenty-fourth year.”  “That is quite correct, sir.”  “You are an illegitimate child?”  The first question had surprised Paul; the second absolutely astounded him.  “Quite true, sir,” replied he, not attempting to hide his surprise; “but I had no idea that M. Tantaine was so well informed; the partition which divided our rooms must have been thinner than I thought.”  Mascarin took no notice of this remark, but continued to shuffle and examine his pieces of cardboard. Had Paul caught a clear glimpse of these, he would have seen his initials in the corner of each.  “Your mother,” went on Mascarin, “kept, for the last fifteen years of her life, a little haberdasher’s shop.”  “Just so.”  “But a business of that description in a town like Poitiers, does not bring in very remunerative results, and luckily she received for your support and education a sum of one thousand francs per year.”  This time Paul started from his seat, for he was sure that Tantaine could not have learned this secret at the Hotel de Perou.  “Merciful powers, sir!” cried he; “who could have told you a thing that has never passed my lips since my arrival in Paris, and of which even Rose is entirely ignorant?”  Mascarin raised his shoulders.  “You can easily comprehend,” remarked he, “that a man in my line of business has to learn many things. If I did not take the greatest precautions, I should be deceived daily, and so lead others into error.”  Paul had not been more than an hour in the office, but the directions given to Beaumarchef had already taught him how many of these events were arranged.  “Though I may be curious,” went on Mascarin, “I am the symbol of discretion; so answer me frankly: How did your mother receive this annuity?”  “Through a Parisian solicitor.”  “Do you know him?”  “Not at all,” answered Paul, who had begun to grow uneasy under this questioning, for a kind of vague apprehension was aroused in his mind, and he could not see the utility of any of these interrogations. There was, however, nothing in Mascarin’s manner to justify the misgivings of the young man, for he appeared to ask all these questions in quite a matter-of-course way, as if they were purely affairs of business.  After a protracted silence, Mascarin resumed,--  “I am half inclined to believe that the solicitor sent the money on his own account.”  “No, sir,” answered Paul. “I am sure you are mistaken.”  “Why are you so certain?”  “Because my mother, who was the incarnation of truth, often assured me that my father died before my birth. Poor mother! I loved and respected her too much to question her on these matters. One day, however, impelled by an unworthy feeling of curiosity, I dared to ask her the name of our protector. She burst into tears, and then I felt how mean and cruel I had been. I never learned his name but I know that he was not my father.”  Mascarin affected not to notice the emotion of his young client.  “Did the allowance cease at your mother’s death?” continued he.  “No; it was stopped when I came of age. My mother told me that this would be the case; but it seems only yesterday that she spoke to me of it. It was on my birthday, and she had prepared a little treat for my supper; for in spite of the affliction my birth had caused her, she loved me fondly. Poor mother! ‘Paul,’ said she, ‘at your birth a genuine friend promised to help me to bring up and educate you, and he kept his word. But you are now twenty-one, and must expect nothing more from him. My son, you are a man now, and I have only you to look to. Work and earn an honest livelihood----’”  Paul could proceed no farther, for his emotions choked him.  “My mother died suddenly some ten months after this conversation--without time to communicate anything to me, and I was left perfectly alone in the world; and were I to die to-morrow, there would not be a soul to follow me to my grave.”  Mascarin put on a sympathetic look.  “Not quite so bad as that, my young friend; I trust that you have one now.”  Mascarin rose from his seat, and for a few minutes paced up and down the room, and then halted, with his arms folded, before the young man.  “You have heard me,” said he, “and I will not put any further questions which it will but pain you to reply to, for I only wished to take your measure, and to judge of your truth from your replies. You will ask why? Ah, that is a question I cannot answer to-day, but you shall know later on. Be assured, however, that I know everything about you, but I cannot tell you by what means. Say it has all happened by chance. Chance has broad shoulders, and can bear a great deal.”  This ambiguous speech caused a thrill of terror to pass through Paul, which was plainly visible on his expressive features.  “Are you alarmed?” asked Mascarin, readjusting his spectacles.  “I am much surprised, sir,” stammered Paul.  “Come, come! what can a man in your circumstances have to fear? There is no use racking your brain; you will find out all you want quickly enough, and had best make up your mind to place yourself in my hands without reserve, for my sole desire is to be of service to you.”  These words were uttered in the most benevolent manner; and as he resumed his seat, he added,--  “Now let us talk of myself. Your mother, whom you justly say was a thoroughly good woman, pinched herself in order to keep you at college at Poitiers. You entered a solicitor’s office at eighteen, I think?”  “Yes, sir.”  “But your mother’s desire was to see you established at Loudon or Cevray. Perhaps she hoped that her wealthy friend would aid you still further. Unluckily, however, you had no inclination for the law.”  Paul smiled, but Mascarin went on with some little severity.  “I repeat, unfortunately; and I think that by this time you have gone through enough to be of my opinion. What did you do instead of studying law? You did--what? You wasted your time over music, and composed songs, and, I know, an opera, and thought yourself a perfect genius.”  Paul had listened up to this time with patience, but at this sarcasm he endeavored to protest; but it was in vain, for Mascarin went on pitilessly,--  “One day you abandoned the study of the law, and told your mother that until you had made your name as a musical composer you would give lessons on the piano; but you could obtain no pupils, and--well, just look in the glass yourself, and say if you think that your age and appearance would justify parents in intrusting their daughters to your tuition?”  Mascarin stopped for a moment and consulted his notes afresh.  “Your departure from Poitiers,” he went on, “was your last act of folly. The very day after your poor mother’s death you collected together all her scanty savings, and took the train to Paris.”  “Then, sir, I had hoped----”  “What, to arrive at fortune by the road of talent? Foolish boy! Every year a thousand poor wretches have been thus intoxicated by their provincial celebrity, and have started for Paris, buoyed up by similar hopes. Do you know the end of them? At the end of ten years--I give them no longer--nine out of ten die of starvation and disappointment, and the other joins the criminal army.”  Paul had often repeated this to himself, and could, therefore, make no reply.  “But,” went on Mascarin, “you did not leave Poitiers alone; you carried off with you a young girl named Rose Pigoreau.”  “Pray, let me explain.”  “It would be useless. The fact speaks for itself. In six months your little store had disappeared; then came poverty and starvation, and at last, in the Hotel de Perou, your thoughts turned to suicide, and you were only saved by my old friend Tantaine.”  Paul felt his temper rising, for these plain truths were hard to bear; but fear lest he should lose his protector kept him silent.  “I admit everything, sir,” said he calmly. “I was a fool, and almost mad, but experience has taught me a bitter lesson. I am here to-day, and this fact should tell you that I have given"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2451"],["title","Caught in the Net (#6)"],["body"," all my vain hallucinations.”  “Will you give up Rose Pigoreau?”  As this abrupt question was put to him, Paul turned pale with anger.  “I love Rose,” answered he coldly; “she believes in me, and has shared my troubles with courage, and one day she shall be my wife.”  Raising his velvet cap from his head, Mascarin bowed with an ironical air, saying, “Is that so? Then I beg a thousand pardons. It is urgent that you should have immediate employment. Pray, what can you do? Not much of anything, I fancy;--like most college bred boys, you can do a little of everything, and nothing well. Had I a son, and an enormous income, I would have him taught a trade.”  Paul bit his lip; but he knew the portrait was a true one.  “And now,” continued Mascarin, “I have come to your aid, and what do you say to a situation with a salary of twelve thousand francs?”  This sum was so much greater than Paul had dared to hope, that he believed Mascarin was amusing himself at his expense.  “It is not kind of you to laugh at me, under the present circumstances,”  remarked he.  Mascarin was not laughing at him; but it was fully half an hour before he could prove this to Paul.  “You would like more proof of what I say,” said he, after a long conversation. “Very well, then; shall I advance your first month’s salary?” And as he spoke, he took a thousand-franc note from his desk, and offered it to Paul. The young man rejected the note; but the force of the argument struck him; and he asked if he was capable of carrying out the duties which such a salary doubtless demanded.  “Were I not certain of your abilities, I should not offer it to you,”  replied Mascarin. “I am in a hurry now, or I would explain the whole affair; but I must defer doing so until to-morrow, when please come at the same hour as you did to-day.”  Even in his state of surprise and stupefaction, Paul felt that this was a signal for him to depart.  “A moment more,” said Mascarin. “You understand that you can no longer remain at the Hotel de Perou? Try and find a room in this neighborhood; and when you have done so, leave the address at the office. Good-bye, my young friend, until to-morrow, and learn to bear good fortune.”  For a few minutes Mascarin stood at the door of the office watching Paul, who departed almost staggering beneath the burden of so many conflicting emotions; and when he saw him disappear round the corner, he ran to a glazed door which led to his bed chamber, and in a loud whisper called, “Come in, Hortebise. He has gone.”  A man obeyed the summons at once, and hurriedly drew up a chair to the fire. “My feet are almost frozen,” exclaimed he; “I should not know it if any one was to chop them off. Your room, my dear Baptiste, is a perfect refrigerator. Another time, please, have a fire lighted in it.”  This speech, however, did not disturb Mascarin’s line of thought. “Did you hear all?” asked he.  “I saw and heard all that you did.”  “And what do you think of the lad?”  “I think that Daddy Tantaine is a man of observation and powerful will, and that he will mould this child between his fingers like wax.”    CHAPTER III.  THE OPINION OF DR. HORTEBISE.  Dr. Hortebise, who had addressed Mascarin so familiarly by his Christian name of Baptiste, was about fifty-six years of age, but he carried his years so well, that he always passed for forty-nine. He had a heavy pair of red, sensual-looking lips, his hair was untinted by gray, and his eyes still lustrous. A man who moved in the best society, eloquent in manner, a brilliant conversationalist, and vivid in his perceptions, he concealed under the veil of good-humored sarcasm the utmost cynicism of mind. He was very popular and much sought after. He had but few faults, but quite a catalogue of appalling vices. Under this Epicurean exterior lurked, it was reported, the man of talent and the celebrated physician. He was not a hard-working man, simply because he achieved the same results without toil or labor. He had recently taken to homoeopathy, and started a medical journal, which he named _The Globule_, which died at its fifth number. His conversation made all society laugh, and he joined in the ridicule, thus showing the sincerity of his views, for he was never able to take the round of life seriously. To-day, however, Mascarin, well as he knew his friend, seemed piqued at his air of levity.  “When I asked you to come here to-day,” said he, “and when I begged you to conceal yourself in my bedroom--”  “Where I was half frozen,” broke in Hortebise.  “It was,” went on Mascarin, “because I desired your advice. We have started on a serious undertaking,--an undertaking full of peril both to you and to myself.”  “Pooh! I have perfect confidence in you,--whatever you do is done well, and you are not the man to fling away your trump cards.”  “True; but I may lose the game, after all, and then----”  The doctor merely shook a large gold locket that depended from his watch chain.  This movement seemed to annoy Mascarin a great deal. “Why do you flash that trinket at me?” asked he. “We have known each other for five and twenty years,--what do you mean to imply? Do you mean that the locket contains the likeness of some one that you intend to make use of later on? I think that you might render such a step unnecessary by giving me your present advice and attention.”  Hortebise threw himself back in his chair with an expression of resignation. “If you want advice,” remarked he, “why not apply to our worthy friend Catenac?--he knows something of business, as he is a lawyer.”  The name of Catenac seemed to irritate Mascarin so much, that calm, and self-contained as he usually was, he pulled off his cap and dashed it on his desk.  “Are you speaking seriously?” said he angrily.  “Why should I not be in earnest?”  Mascarin removed his glasses, as though without them he could the more easily peer into the depths of the soul of the man before him.  “Because,” replied he slowly, “both you and I distrust Catenac. When did you see him last?”  “More than three months ago.”  “True, and I allow that he seems to be acting fairly toward his old associates; but you will admit that, in keeping away thus, his conduct is without excuse, for he has made his fortune; and though he pretends to be poor, he is certainly a man of wealth.”  “Do you really think so?”  “Were he here, I would force him to acknowledge that he is worth a million, at least.”  “A million!” exclaimed the doctor, with sudden animation.  “Yes, certainly. You and I, Hortebise, have indulged our every whim, and have spent gold like water, while our friend garnered his harvest and stored it away. But poor Catenac has no expensive tastes, nor does he care for women or the pleasures of the table. While we indulged in every pleasure, he lent out his money at usurious interest. But, stop,--how much do you spend per annum?”  “That is a hard question to answer; but, say, forty thousand francs.”  “More, a great deal more; but calculate what a capital sum that would amount to during the twenty years we have done business together.”  The doctor was not clever at figures; he made several vain attempts to solve the problem, and at last gave it up in despair. “Forty and forty,”  muttered he, tapping the tips of his fingers, “are eighty, then forty--”  “Call it eight hundred thousand francs,” broke in Mascarin. “Say I drew the same amount as you did. We have spent ours, and Catenac has saved his, and grown rich; hence my distrust. Our interests are no longer identical. He certainly comes here every month, but it is only to claim his share; he consents to take his share of the profits, but shirks the risks. It is fully ten years since he brought in any business. I don’t trust him at all. He always declines to join in any scheme that we propose, and sees danger in everything.”  “He would not betray us, however.”  Mascarin took a few moments for reflection. “I think,” said he, “that Catenac is afraid of us. He knows that the ruin of me would entail the destruction of the other two. This is our only safeguard; but if he dare not injure us openly, he is quite capable of working against us in secret. Do you remember what he said the last time he was here? That we ought to close our business and retire. How should _we_ live? for he is rich and we are poor. What on earth are you doing, Hortebise?” he added, for the physician, who had the reputation of being worth an enormous amount, had taken out his purse, and was going over the contents.  “I have scarcely three hundred and twenty-seven francs!” answered he with a laugh. “What is the state of your finances?”  Mascarin made a grimace. “I am not so well off as you; and besides,” he continued in a low voice, as though speaking to himself, “I have certain ties which you do not possess.”  For the first time during this interview a cloud spread over the doctor’s countenance.  “Great Heavens!” said he, “and I was depending on you for three thousand francs, which I require urgently.”  Mascarin smiled slyly at the doctor’s uneasiness. “Don’t worry,” he answered. “You can have that; there ought to be some six or eight thousand francs in the safe. But that is all, and that is the last of our common capital,--this after twenty years of toil, danger, and anxiety, and we have not twenty years before us to make a fresh fortune in.”  “Yes,” continued Mascarin, “we are getting old, and therefore have the greater reason for making one grand stroke to assure our fortune. Were I to fall ill to-morrow, all would go to smash.”  “Quite true,” returned the doctor, with a slight shudder.  “We must, and that is certain, venture on a bold stroke. I have said this for years, and woven a web of gigantic proportions. Do you now know why at this last moment I appeal to you, and not to Catenac for assistance? If only one out of two operations that I have fully explained to you succeeds, our fortune is made.”  “I follow you exactly.”  “The question now is whether the chance of success is "]]]
