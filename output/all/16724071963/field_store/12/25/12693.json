And so she poured out to him her heart, long stifled in the abyss of her isolation; and, gazing into his eyes, she was gazing merely toward all that was bright and happy and youthful and responsive, and he was its symbol, God-sent from those busy haunts of men which already, to her, had become only memories of a blessed vision.  And all the while the undercurrent of his own thoughts ran on unceasingly: \"What can I do for her? I am falling in love--in love, surely, hopelessly. What can I do for her--for her brother--her father? I am falling in love--in love--in love.\"  The long, still, sunny afternoon slipped away. Gradually the water turned to pearl, inlaid with gold, then with glowing rose. And now, far to the north, the first thrilling clangor of wild geese, high in the blue, came to their ears, and they shrank apart and lay back, staring upward. Nearer, nearer, came the sky trumpets, answering faintly each to each--nearer, nearer, till high over the blind swept the misty wedge; and old Uncle Dudley flapped his wings and stretched his neck, calling up to his wild comrades of earthly delights unnumbered here under the shadow of death. And every wild goose answered him, and the decoys flapped and clamored a siren welcome; but the flying wedge glided onward through the blue.  \"They've begun to move,\" whispered the girl. \"But, oh, dear! It is blue-bird weather. Hark! Do you hear the swans? I can hear swans coming out of the north!\"  Marche could not yet hear them, but the tethered swans and geese heard, and a magnificent chorus rose from the water. Then, far away as fairyland, faintly out of the sky, came a new murmur--not the martial clangor of wild geese, but something wilder, more exquisitely unearthly--nearer, nearer, enrapturing its weird, celestial beauty. And now, through the blue, with great, snowy wings slowly beating, the swans passed over like angels; and like angels passing, hailing each other as they winged their way, drifting on broad, white pinions, they called, each to the other in their sweet, unreal voices, gossiping, garrulous, high in the sky. And far away they floated on until they became only a silver ribbon undulating against the azure; and even then Marche could hear the soft tumult of their calling: Heu! Heu! Hiou! Hiou-oo! until sound and snowy flecks vanished together in mid-heaven.  Again, coming from the far north, the trumpets of the sky squadron were sounding; they passed, wedge after wedge, sometimes in steady formation, sometimes like a wavering band of witches, and again in shifting battalions, sternly officered, passing through intricate aërial maneuvers, and greeted by Uncle Dudley and the other decoys with wild beseeching mixed with applause.  Snowy, angelic companies of swans came alternately with the geese; then a whimpering, whispering flight of wild ducks, water-fowl in thousands and tens of thousands, rushing onward through the aërial lanes.  But none came to the blind. Occasionally a wedge of geese wavered, irresolute at the frantic persuasions of Uncle Dudley, but their leader always dragged them back to their course, and the sagging, hesitating ranks passed on.  Sometimes, in a nearer flight of swans, some long-necked, snowy creature would bend its head to look curiously down at the tethered swans on the water, but always they continued on, settling some two miles south of Foaming Shoals, until there was half a mile of wild swans afloat there, looking like a long, low bank of snow, touched with faintest pink by the glow of the westering sun.     IV   Marche, pacing the shabby sitting room after supper, an unlighted cigarette between his fingers, listened to Jim recite his Latin lesson.  \"_Atque ea qui ad efeminandos animos pertinent important_,\" repeated the boy; and Marche nodded absently.  \"Do you understand what that means, Jim?\"  \"Not exactly, sir.\"  Marche explained, then added smilingly: \"But there is nothing luxurious to corrupt manhood among the coast marshes down here. Barring fever and moccasins, Jim, you ought to emerge, some day, into the larger world equipped for trouble.\"  \"I shall go out some day,\" said the boy.  Marche glanced up at the portrait of the boy's mother in its pale-gilt oval. Near it, another nail had been driven, and on the faded wall paper was an oval discoloration, as though another picture had once hung there.  \"I wish I might see your father before I go North,\" said Marche, half to himself. \"Isn't he well enough to let me talk to him for a few minutes?\"  \"I will ask him,\" said the boy.  Marche paced the ragged carpet until the return of Jimmy.  \"Father is sorry, and asks you to please excuse him,\" he said.  Marche had picked up the boy's schoolbook and was looking at the writing on the flyleaf again. Then he raised his head, eyes narrowing on the boy as though searching for some elusive memory connected with him--with his name in the Latin book--perhaps with the writing, which, somehow, had stirred in him, once more, the same odd and uncomfortable sensation which he had experienced when he first saw it.  [Illustration: \"'Jim,' he said, 'where did you live?'\"]  \"Jim,\" he said, \"where did you live when you lived in New York?\"  \"In Eighty-seventh Street.\"  \"West?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Do you remember the house--the number?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Was it a private house?\"  \"I don't know. It was very tall. We lived on one floor and used an elevator.\"  \"I see. It was an apartment house.\"  The boy stood, with blonde head lowered, silently turning over the leaves of an old magazine.  Marche walked out to the porch; his brows were bent slightly inward, and he bit the end of his unlighted cigarette until the thing became useless. Then he flung it away. A few stars watched him above the black ramparts of the pines; a gentle wind was abroad, bringing inland the restless voice of the sea.  In Marche's mind a persistent thought was groping in darkness, vainly striving to touch and awaken memories of things forgotten. What was it he was trying to remember? What manner of episode, and how connected with this place, with the boy's book, with the portrait of his mother in its oval frame? Had he seen that portrait before? Perhaps he had seen it here, five years ago; yet that could not be, because Herold had not been here then.  Was it the writing on the flyleaf that had stirred some forgotten memory? It had seemed to him familiar, somehow--yet not like the handwriting in Herold's business letters to him. Yet it _was_ Herold's writing--\"Jim, from Daddy\"--that was the inscription. And that inscription had riveted his attention from the first moment he saw it.  Who was Herold? Who was this man whose undoubtable breeding and personal cultivation had stamped his children with the same unmistakable distinction?  Somehow or other there had been a great fall in the world for him--a terrible tumble from higher estate to land him here in this desolation of swamp-bound silence--here where only the dark pines broke the vast sky line, where the only sound was the far rumor of the sea. Sick, probably with coast fever, poor, dependent, no doubt, on the salary Marche paid him, isolated from all in the world that made the world endurable to intelligence, responsible for two growing children--one already a woman--what must be the thoughts of such a man on a night like this, for instance?  \"I want to see that man,\" he kept repeating to himself. \"I want to see him; and I'm going to.\"  Restless, but now always listening for the sound of a light tread which he had come to know so well--alas!--he began to walk to and fro, with keen glances toward the illuminated kitchen window every time he passed it. Sometimes his mind was chaotic; sometimes clear. The emotions which had awakened in him within the week were complex enough to stagger a more intelligent man. And Marche was not a fool; he was the typical product of his environment--the result of school and college, and a New York business life carried on in keenest competition with men as remorseless in business as the social code permitted. Also, he went to church on Sundays, read a Republican newspaper, and belonged to several unexceptionable clubs.  That was the kind of a man he had been only a week ago--a good fellow in the usual sense among men, acceptable to women, kind hearted, not too cynical, and every idea in his head modeled upon the opinions he heard expressed in that limited area wherein he had been born and bred.  That was the kind of a man he had been a week ago. What was he now--to-night--here in this waste corner of the world with the light from a kitchen window blazing on him as though it were the flashing splendor streaming through the barred portals of paradise? Was it possible that he, John Benton Marche, could be actually in love--in love with the daughter of his own game warden--with a girl who served him at supper in apron and gingham, who served him further in hip boots and ragged jacket--this modern Rosalind of the marshes, as fresh and innocent, as modest and ardent, as she of the Arden glades?  The kitchen door opened, and Molly Herold came down the steps and straight toward him, unthinkingly, almost instinctively, laying her hands in his as he met her under the leafless China tree in the yard.  \"I was longer than usual to-night,\" she said, \"trying to soften my hands with that cold cream you so kindly sent for.\" She lifted them in the starlight with a little laugh. \"They're a trifle better, I think,\" she said, \"but they're always in water, you know, either there,\" she glanced around at the kitchen, \"or yonder with the decoys. But thank you all the same,\" she added brightly. \"Are you going to have another delightful talk, now?\"  \"Do you care to?\"  \"Of course. The idea of my not caring to talk to you,\" she said, laughing at the absurdity. \"Shall we go into the sitting room,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24389"],["title","Blue-Bird Weather (#6)"],["body"," walk in the starlight? There are no snakes out, yet,\" she assured him, \"though if this weather holds, the moccasins will come out.\"  \"We'll walk down to the shore,\" he said.  \"One moment, then.\" She turned and sped to the house, reappearing, after a few minutes, wearing her ragged shooting coat.  \"Is your father comfortable?\" he asked.  \"Yes, thank you.\"  \"Do you think he might want you?\"  \"No. Jim sleeps next to him, and he is preparing for bed, now.\" She smiled. \"What a darling my brother is, isn't he, Mr. Marche?\"  \"He's a fine boy.\"  They moved on together, down the rutted lane, between dismantled fences and ragged, leafless hedges. She was lithe and light and sure footed, but once or twice, as they skirted puddles, he supported her; and the touch of his hand on her body almost unnerved him. Never had he dreamed that contact with any woman could so thrill, so exquisitely shock. And every instant he was falling deeper and deeper in love with her. He knew it--realized it--made no effort to avoid it, fight it off, control it. It was only his speech and manner that he held desperately under bit and curb, letting his heart go to everlasting smash and his reason run riot. And what on earth would be the end he could not imagine, for he was leaving for the North in the morning, and he had not yet told her.  As they came out upon the shore, the dory loomed up, beached, a dark silhouette against the starlit water. She laid her hands on the stern and vaulted lightly to her perch, sliding along to make room for Marche.  From far away in the sound came the confused murmur of wild fowl feeding. Except for that, and the ceaseless monotone of the outer sea, there was no sound, not even the lap of water against the bow.  Marche, who had been leaning forward, head bent as though watching the water, turned to the girl abruptly. \"I want to do something for--Jim,\" he said.  The girl looked up at him, not understanding.  \"Will your father let me?\"  \"I don't know what you mean.\"  \"I mean that I want to send him to a good school--a good boys' school in the North.\"  She caught her breath, was silent for a moment, then, amazed: \"_Would_ you do that? Oh, I've wished for it--dreamed of it! But--how can you? You are so kind--so good to us--but how could we--accept?\"  \"That's why I want to see your father.\"  \"For _that_! Was it really for that, Mr. Marche?\"  \"Yes--partly.\" He swallowed and looked the other way, for the girl's excited face was very near his own as she bent forward to search his eyes for the least change of expression--bent nearer as though to reassure herself that he meant it seriously. For an instant her soft breath made the night air fragrant; he felt it, faint and fresh on his cheek, and turned sharply, biting his lips lest he lose all self-control.  \"Could you and your father spare him?\" he asked carelessly.  \"Oh, if you only would give him that chance!\" she cried. \"But--tell me--_how_ can we accept such a thing of you? Is it possible?\"  \"Would _you_ accept it?\" he asked, turning toward her.  The question startled her. She looked at him, striving to think clearly, trying to see this offered miracle through calm, impartial eyes.  \"I--I would do anything--almost--for Jim,\" she said. \"I'd have no pride left, if his chances lay in the balance. But men--my father--may be different.\"  He said slowly: \"Suppose I offered the same chance to you?\"  \"What!\" she said crisply.  \"Suppose I offered you a college finishing, Miss Herold. Would you accept?\"  She slowly grew scarlet under his gaze. \"That would be insulting,\" she said, in a low voice.  \"Why, when only kindness is meant--as I mean it for Jim?\"  \"It is not the same. I am a grown woman capable of caring for myself. Such an offer, however kindly meant, could only hurt me, humiliate me--and--I thought you found me companionable as I am. Friends do not offer to better each other--in such a way.\"  \"I have not offered it to you, Miss Herold.\"  She looked up, still flushed and brilliant eyed; then her face changed softly. \"I know it. I was foolishly sensitive. I know you couldn't offer such a thing to me. But I wish I knew whether we could accept for Jim. He is such a darling--so intelligent and perfectly crazy for an education. I've saved a little--that's why I wanted you to hire me for your bayman. You see I don't spend anything on myself,\" she added, with a blush.  Marche was fighting hard for self-restraint; he was young and romantic, and his heart was very full. \"What I'd like to do,\" he said, \"would be to send Jim to some first-rate school until he is ready for college. Then I'd like to see him through college, and, if he cared for it, start him with me in business.\"  \"Oh,\" she cried softly, \"is it possible! Is there--can any man really do such heavenly things? Have you any idea what you are saying? Do you realize what you are doing to me--with every word you utter?\"  \"What am I doing to--to you?\" he asked unsteadily.  \"Making me your slave,\" she said, in a low voice, thrilling with generous passion. \"Even for the thought--even if father will not accept--what you have said to me to-night has put me in your debt forever. Truly--truly, I know what friendship is, now.\"  She clasped her hands tightly and said something else, sweetly incoherent; and, in the starlight, Marche saw the tears sparkling on her lashes.  With that he sprang nervously to the shore and began to tramp up and down the shingle, his mind in a whirl, every sense, common or the contrary, clamoring for finality--urging him to tell her the truth--tell her that he loved her, that he wanted her--her alone, out of all the world of women--that it was for love and for her, and for love of her, that he offered anything, did anything, thought anything now under the high stars or under the circling sun.  And now, as he tramped savagely to and fro, he realized that he had begun wrong; that he should have told her he loved her first of all, and then acted, not promised.  Would she look on his offer scornfully, now? Would she see, in what he asked of her, a bribe desired for the offer he had made in her brother's behalf? She did not love him. How could she, in a week? Never had there been even a hint of sentiment between them. What would she think--this young girl, so tranquilly confident in her friendship for him--what would she think of him and his love? He knew there was nothing mercenary or material in her character; he knew she was young, sweet tempered, reticent concerning herself, clean hearted, and proud. How could he come blundering through the boundaries of her friendship with such an avowal, at a moment's notice?  He returned slowly to the boat and stood looking up at her; and he saw that she was smiling down at him in the starlight.  \"Why did you start off so abruptly and tramp up and down?\" she asked.  He looked up at her. \"Shall we walk back, now?\" he said.  She extended her hands to him, and he swung her to the beach. For a moment he retained her hands; she looked at him, smiling, thrilling with all that he had said, meeting his eyes frankly and tenderly.  \"You are like some glorious magic prince to me,\" she said, \"appearing among us here to win our hearts with a word.\"  \"Have I won yours with what I have said?\"  \"Mine? Oh, don't you know it? Do you think--even if it doesn't come true--that I can ever forget what you have wished to do for Jim?\"  Still holding her hands, he lifted them, joined her fingers, and laid his lips to them. She bent her head and caught her breath in surprise.  \"I am going North to-morrow,\" he said.  For a moment she did not comprehend his words. Then, a trifle dazed, she looked up at him. \"To-morrow?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Are you coming back?\"  \"Perhaps--next year.\"  \"_Next--year!_\"  \"Do you--find it--a long time?\"  Her straight brows bent inward a little, the startled gray eyes became clear and steady. \"Of course I knew that you must go--some time. But I had no idea that it would be so soon. Somehow, I have thought of you as being--here----\"  \"Do you care?\"  Her honest eyes widened. \"Care?\" she repeated.  \"Yes. How greatly do you care?\"  The straight brows contracted still more as she stood considering him--so close that the fresh and subtle youth of her freshened the night again with its faint perfume.  Again he touched her hands with his lips, she watching him palely, out of clear, gray eyes; then, as they turned away together, he encircled her slender waist with his arm.  That she was conscious of it, and not disturbed by it, was part of her new mystery to him. Only once, as they walked, when his circling clasp tightened, did she rest her own hand over his where it held her body imprisoned. But she said nothing; nor had he spoken when the belt of pines loomed against the stars once more.  Then, though neither had spoken, they stopped. He turned to face her, drew her into his arms, and the beating of his heart almost suffocated him as he looked into her eyes, clear, unshrinking eyes of gray, with a child's question in their starry depths.  And he answered the question as in a dream: \"I love you. I want you for my wife. I want you to love me. You are the first woman I have cared for. All that you are I want--no more than you are. You, as you are now, are all that I care for in the world. Life is young for us both, yet. Let us grow up together--if you can love me. Can you?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Can you not care for me a little, Molly?\"  \"I do. I know--nothing about--love--real love.\"  \"Can you not imagine it, dear?\"  \"I--it is what I _have_ imagined--a man--like you--coming this way into my loneliness. I recognize it. I have dreamed that it was like this. What is it that I should do--if this is really to come true?\"  \"Love me.\"  \"I would--if I knew how. I don't know how,\" she said wistfully. \"My heart is so full--already--of your goodness--I--and then this dream I have dreamed--that a man like you should come here and say this to me----\"  \"Is it in you to love me?\"  \"I'll try--if you'll"]]]
