This can get real troublesome, like I pick up this five to ten this way.  \"See, they get this chump a couple too many. So, comes morning, he's still in the street. Real tough swinging a parole, too. I'm in here since five years, remember? So I'm real careful where I get muscle any more.\"  \"Sounds interesting.\" Stan nodded thoughtfully.  \"Great Space and all the little Nebulae,\" he said to himself. \"What kind of a planet is this? Nothing in the histories about this sort of thing.\" He walked over to the washstand.  \"Some day,\" he promised himself, \"I'm going to get out of here. And when I do, I'll set up camp by Guard Headquarters. And I'll needle those big brains till they do something about this.\"  There was, he remembered, one organization that should be able to do more than a little in a case like this. He smiled to himself ruefully as he thought of the almost legendary stories he had heard about the Federation's Special Corps for Investigation.  As he remembered the stories, though, corpsmen seemed to appear from nowhere when there was serious trouble. No one ever seemed to call them in. No one even knew how to get in touch with them. He shrugged.  The men of the Special Corps, he remembered, were reputed to be something in the superhuman line.  For a large part of his life, he had dreamed of working with them, but he had been unable to find any way of so much as applying for membership in their select group. So, he'd done the next best thing. He'd gone into the Stellar Guard. And he'd lasted only a little more than three years.  Somehow, he'd taken it from there. He was still a little hazy as to how he'd managed to land in prison on Kell's planet. It had been a mere stopover.  There had been no trial. Obviously, they had searched his luggage at the hotel, but there had been no discussion. He'd simply been beamed into unconsciousness.  After he'd gotten to Opertal, someone had told him the length of his sentence and they'd assigned him to the prison machine shop, to learn a useful trade and the duties of a citizen of Kellonia.  He smiled wryly. They had taught him machinery. And they'd introduced him to their culture. The trade was good. The culture--?         *       *       *       *       *  His memory slid back, past the prison--past the years in Kendall Hall, and beyond.  He was ten years old again.  It was a sunny day in a park and Billy Darfield was holding forth.  \"Yeah,\" the boy was saying, \"Dad told me about the time he met one of them. They look just like anyone else. Only, when things go wrong, there they are, just all at once. And when they tell you to do something, you've had it.\" He closed his eyes dreamily.  \"Oh, boy,\" he said happily, \"how I'd love to be like that! Wouldn't it be fun to tell old Winant, 'go off some place and drown yourself'?\"  Stan smiled incredulously. \"Aw, I've heard a lot about the Special Corps, too. They've just got a lot of authority, that's all. They can call in the whole Stellar Guard if they need 'em. Who's going to get wise with somebody that can do that?\"  Billy shook his head positively. \"Dad told me all about them, and he knows. He saw one of 'em chase a king right off his throne once. Wasn't anybody to help him, either. They've got all they need, all by themselves. Just have to tell people, that's all.\"         *       *       *       *       *  With a jerk, Stan came to the present. He slopped water over his hands.  \"Too bad I can't do something like that myself,\" he thought. \"I'd like to tell a few people to go out and drown themselves, right now.\" He grinned ruefully.  \"Only one trouble. I can't. Probably just a lot of rumor, anyway.\"  But there was something behind those stories of the Special Corps, he was sure. They didn't get official publicity, but there were pages of history that seemed somehow incomplete. There must have been someone around with a lot more than the usual ability to get things done, but whoever he had been, he was never mentioned.  He shrugged and turned away from the washstand.  \"Hope that bell rings pretty soon,\" he told himself. \"I'd better get chow and go to work before I really go nuts.\"  [Illustration]  A demonstrator had the back off from one of the big Lambert-Howell sprayers. As the man started to point out a feed assembly, another prisoner stepped directly in front of Graham.  Stan shook his head impatiently and moved aside. Again, the man was in front of him, blocking his view. Again, Stan moved.  The third time the man blocked his view, Stan touched his shoulder.  \"Hey, Chum,\" he said mildly, \"how about holding still a while. The rest of us would sort of like to see, too.\"  For several seconds, the other froze. Then he whirled, to present a scowling face.  \"Who you pushing around, little rat? Keep your greasy paws to yourself, see.\" He turned again, then took a sudden, heavy step back.  Stan moved his foot aside and the man's heel banged down on the stone floor. For a heartbeat, Stan regarded the fellow consideringly, then he shook his head.  \"Stay in orbit, remember?\" he told himself. He moved aside, going to the other side of the group around the fabricator.  Now he remembered the man. Val Vernay had been working on the fabricators when Stan had come to the shop.  Somehow, he had never run an acceptable program, but he hung around the demonstrations, unable to comprehend the explanations--resentful of those who showed aptitude.  He glanced aside as Stan moved, then pushed his way across until he was again in front of the smaller man. Stan sighed resignedly.  Again, the heavy foot crashed toward the rear. This time, the temptation was too great. Deftly, Stan swung his toe through a small arc, sweeping Vernay's ankle aside and putting the man off balance.  He moved quickly away, further trapping the ankle and getting clear of the flailing arms.  For a breathless instant, Vernay tried to hop on one foot, his arms windmilling as he fought to regain his balance. Then he crashed to the floor, his head banging violently against the stones.  Stan looked at the body in consternation. He had merely intended to make the fellow look a little silly.  \"Hope he's got a hard head,\" he told himself.  The workroom guard came up warily.  \"What's all this?\"  \"I don't know, sir.\" Stan managed a vaguely puzzled look. \"First thing I knew, he was swinging his arms all over the place. Then he went down. Maybe he had a fit, huh?\"  \"Yeah.\" The guard was sardonic. \"Yeah, maybe he had a fit. Well, no more trouble out of him for a while.\" He raised his voice.  \"Hey, you over by the first-aid kit. Grab that stretcher.\"  Big Carl Marlo was in his bunk when Stan came into the cell. He looked up with a grin.  \"Hey, kid, you start at the top, huh?\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"This Vernay, what else? Like I said, you start at the top. I didn't think you got it when I told you about the muscle racket. How'd I know you was already figuring something?\" Marlo shook his head admiringly.  \"Real nice job, too. You take it easy, set this chump up, and there you are. Only you get a real big fish. Think you can handle this guy again?\"  Stan blinked. \"Look,\" he said, \"punch in some more data, will you? And run it by real slow. I'm way off co-ordinates.\"  \"Huh? What you--Oh, I get you.\" Marlo frowned.  \"Now don't go telling me you don't know about this Vernay. Don't give me you ain't figured how you can land a big job with Janzel Equipment. You know me--Big Carl. I don't talk, remember?\" He looked at the blank expression on Stan's face.  \"Besides, there ain't a guy in the walls, don't figure this deal by now. Man, you just don't know how many guys been watching that Vernay.\"  Stan walked across the cell and sat down on his bunk.  \"Look,\" he said patiently, \"let's just say I'm some stupid kid from off planet. Maybe I don't get things so well. Now, what's this all about?\"  Marlo shrugged. \"So all right, but for some guy don't know what he's doing, you sure pick 'em pretty. Well, anyway, here's the layout.  \"See, this guy, Vernay, is one of Janzel's big strong-arms. Real salt and butter guy. Been pushing them poor apes of theirs all over the place, see. Don't know too much about the business, but they tell him some mug's not putting out, Vernay goes over and bends the guy around his machine a while, he should maybe work faster. See what I mean?\"  Stan frowned distastefully and Marlo held up a hand.  \"Oh, that's all right,\" he said. \"This is what they pay this guy for. But he gets to like his work too well, know what I mean? So here a while back, he gets on some machine tender. Leans all over this poor guy. Well, the fab nurse ends up turning in his tickets, and this, the joes don't go for so good.\" He jerked a shoulder.  \"Oh, Janzel tries to kill the squawk, but it's no go. The joes push the button and here's Vernay.\" He grinned.  \"They manage to get it knocked to some kinda manslaughter, but Vernay's still got time to pick up, so they pull wires and get him up here. It ain't no rest home, but it ain't no madhouse neither, like some of them places.\" His eyes clouded.  \"Oogh, when I think of some of the holes--\" He waved a hand.  \"So anyway, like you see, Vernay's got plenty of muscle, but he's kind of low in the brain department. Maybe they thought something might drill through the skull up here, but that don't work either. I guess Janzel'd about as soon get another pretty boy, but they know they'll lose too much face, they dump him right away.  \"Then you come along and just about split the chump's conk just so's he'll stay out of your light, see?\" He shook his head slowly.  \"Only thing, that don't solve nothing. He comes out of the bone-house in a couple days, and he ain't gonna like you at all. See what I mean?\"  \"Yeah.\" Stan examined his fingernails.  \"Yeah,\" he repeated. \"You make it all nice and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24180"],["title","Alarm Clock (#3)"],["body",".\" He got up and went to the washstand.  \"Whatcha gonna do, Georgie, boy?\" he chanted. \"Guess I'll just have to give him a free lesson in breakfalls. He won't like it too well, but he could use lots of practice.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It took Vernay more than a couple of days to get out of the hospital. As time went by, Stan became more and more conscious of the speculative looks he was getting from prisoners and guards alike.  He stood watching, as a maintenance engineer tore into the vitals of a Lambert-Howell. Around him was space--a full meter on all sides. It was, he realized, a distinction--symbolic accolade for anyone who had the temerity to down a man like Vernay. It was also a gesture of caution. No one was anxious to block the view of a man who had downed a vicious fighter with an unobtrusive gesture. And no one was anxious to be too close when Vernay might come by.  What sort of man was Vernay, Stan wondered. Of course, he was familiar with the appearance of the tall, blond. He could easily visualize the insolent, sleepy looking eyes--the careless weave of the heavy shoulders. And he'd heard a lot about the man's actions.  But these could mean anything. Was the man actually as clumsy and inept as he'd seemed? Was he simply a powerful oaf, who relied on pure strength and savagery? Or was he a cunning fighter, who had made one contemptuously careless mistake?  \"Well,\" the maintenance man was saying, \"that's the way you set those upper coils. Remember, each one has its own field angle, and you've got to set 'em down to within a tenth of a degree. Otherwise, you'll never get a sharp focus and your spray'll make a real mess.\" He swept his glance over the group.  \"You use the manual when you set these things up,\" he added. \"Don't go depending on your memory. You can play some pretty dirty tricks on yourself that way.\" He looked thoughtfully at the array of coils.  \"And don't go using any gravito clamps around these things when the back's off. They don't like it. It makes 'em do nasty things.\" He flipped his wrist up, looking at his watch.  \"All right, that's it. Let's go eat.\" He snapped a cover back in place and swung down from the catwalk.  Stan turned away. No tools to put away tonight, he thought. Didn't need 'em all afternoon. He smiled. And no column to fall into, either. This was the weekly free night.  He walked out of the shop, following a group of prisoners through the archway into the main yard. Another small group followed him, keeping a decent interval behind.  Someone drew a sharp breath.  \"Hey, look! Over there.\"  Stan followed the direction indicated by a dozen abruptly turned heads. Vernay was lounging in the shadow of the archway. He smiled tigerishly and sauntered toward Stan. The group of prisoners melted away, to form a rough semicircle. From somewhere, others were appearing.  \"So all right, little rat,\" Vernay said softly, \"you've had a lot of fun these last few days, eh? Big man around the yard, huh? Yeah! Well, it's going to stop.\" He massaged his right hand with the thumb and fingers of his left, then stretched out his arms, flexing his fingers.  \"Real smart little fella,\" he added. \"Knows all kinds of little tricks. Got anything to say before I open you up for inspection?\"  Stan faced him, his feet a few inches apart, his knees slightly bent. He folded his arms without interlacing them.  \"Look, Vernay,\" he said. \"I'm not looking for any fight, but if you force one, I'll break you all to pieces. I didn't mean to bust your head the first time, but I can do it on purpose if I have to. Why don't we just forget it?\"  Vernay looked dazed for an instant, then recovered and laughed derisively.  \"You trying to crawl out and still look good? No, no. You made your brags. Now we'll have a little dance.\" He took a step forward.  \"Come on, baby, just stay there. I'm going to unscrew your head.\"  He came closer, then reached out, his hand open.  Stan looked at the hand incredulously. No one could be that careless. For an instant, he almost spun away from a suspected trap. Then he decided the man was in no position for a counter. A try for a simple hand hold couldn't do a bit of harm.  His right hand darted up, gripping the outstretched hand before him. He jerked down, clamped the hand with his left, then pressed up and took a quick step forward.  With a startled cry of pain, Vernay spun around and bent toward the ground. Stan carried the motion through with a sudden surge that forced the big man's face almost to the stones. Abruptly, Vernay twisted and kicked, trying to tear away. There was a ripping noise and he screamed thinly, then slumped to the pavement.  Stan looked down at him in bewilderment. It had been too easy, he thought. Something had to be wrong. The imprisoned hand twitched and was flaccid. He let it go and stepped back.  For a few seconds, Vernay lay quietly, then he struggled into violent motion. He scrambled to get to his feet, his left hand groping at his belt. Stan caught the glint of polished steel. He stepped quickly around the man, poising himself.  It was no use, he thought. This would have to be decisive. He brought his two hands up to his shoulder, then swung them like an axe, stepping into the swing as Vernay got his feet under him.  The impact of the blow brought Vernay to a standing position. As the man stood swaying, Stan swung his hands again.  Vernay's back arched and for an instant he was rigid. Then he stumbled forward, to pitch against the wall.  Briefly, he was braced upright against the wall, his left hand high on the stones, the scalpel glittering. Then the hand relaxed and the sliver of steel clattered to the paving. Slowly, the man slid down, to melt into a shapeless heap in the gutter.  Stan sighed, then shook his head and wiped an arm across his eyes.  There was a concerted sigh behind him.  \"Go ahead, kid,\" someone muttered. \"Give him the boots. Big phony hadda go trying a knife.\"  Stan turned. \"No use,\" he said wearily. \"I just hope he's still alive.\"  \"I don't get it,\" said someone. \"He wants this guy alive?\"  Someone else laughed shortly. \"Maybe he just likes to make it tough on himself. Hey, look out! The joes.\"  As the crowd faded into the nowhere from whence most of it had come, a guard approached Stan warily.  \"Now, look, Graham,\" he said cautiously, \"I gotta throw you in the hole. You know that, huh?\"  Stan nodded listlessly.  \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I suppose so.\"  \"Look, fellow, it won't be too long. He jumped you, so they'll have you out of there real soon.\" The guard was apologetic.  \"Besides, they'll probably offer you his job at Janzel. Get you clear out of here. Only don't give me a hard time. All you'll get is both of us flashed.\"  \"Yeah, I know.\" Stan held out an arm. \"Come on, let's go.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Stan watched as the chief test engineer waved a hand.  \"Two hundred twenty gravs,\" the man said. \"Full swing completed on both axes. That's it. Ease off your tractors.\"  He looked closely at his panel of meters, then got off his stool and stretched.  \"No evidence of strain. Looks as though all components are good.\" He turned, looking at the test operators.  \"Let's get this place cleaned up.\"  The sense of disorientation set up by the tractors was subsiding. Stan got to his feet and looked at his companion.  Dachmann nodded at him.  \"Well,\" he said slowly, \"Golzer can get off the hook now. His run'll be approved. Suppose we get back on the job.\"  He led the way out of the blockhouse tunnel.  A car was pulling up at the entrance. A heavy, square face looked from a rear window and a large hand beckoned.  \"Dachmann, Graham. Over here.\"  \"Oh, oh.\" Dachmann sighed. \"Here's trouble. Wizow doesn't come out here unless he's got something.\"  The blocky production chief looked coldly at them as they approached the car.  \"It'll be a lot better,\" he growled, \"if you two clear through my office before you start wandering all over the grounds.\" He looked at Stan.  \"Got a problem for you. Maybe we'll get some action out of you on this one.\" He held out a few sheets of paper.  \"Hold up over in the components line.\" He jabbed at a sheet with a forefinger.  \"Take a trip over there and kick it up.\" He glanced at Dachmann. \"Got another one for you.\"  Stan took the papers, studying them. Then he looked up. There was very little question as to the bottleneck here. Each material shortage traced back to one machine. He frowned.  \"Maintenance people checked over that machine yet?\" he asked.  Wizow shrugged impassively. \"You're a staffman,\" he said coldly. \"Been on parole to us long enough, you should know what to do, so I'm not going to tell you how. Just get to the trouble and fix it. All I want is production. Leave the smart talk to the technical people.\" He turned.  \"Get in, Dachmann. I've got a headache for you.\"  Stan examined the tabulated sheets again. The offending machine was in building nine thirty-two. Number forty-one.  He walked over to the parking lot and climbed on the skip-about he had bought on his first pay day. The machine purred into life as he touched a button and he raised the platform a few inches off the ground, then spun about, to glide across the field toward block nine.         *       *       *       *       *  Fabricator number forty-one was a multiple. A single programming head actuated eight spinaret assemblies, which could deliver completed module assemblies into carriers in an almost continuous stream. It was idling.  Stan visualized the flow chart of the machine as he approached. Then he paused. The operator was sitting at the programming punch, carefully going over a long streamer of tape. Stan frowned and looked at his watch. By this time, the tapes should be ready and the machine in full operation. But this man was obviously still setting up.  He continued to watch as the operator laboriously compared the tape with a blueprint before him. There was something familiar in the sharp,"]]]
