No, on second thoughts, I will leave her free, but watched. Take my word for it, Bob; if you give that clever girl rope enough she will hang herself.\"     CHAPTER V  A SCRAP OF PAPER   \"A penny for your thoughts, Nancy.\" Mrs. Warren leaned across the table and addressed her friend.  Nancy started guiltily, and her thoughts returned to her surroundings with a rush. Senator Warren, seated on her left, noticed her confusion, and whispered in her ear:  \"Blue or gray?\"  \"Gray,\" she answered; then colored hotly as she met his amused gaze.  \"You did not notice me this morning,\" continued the senator, lowering his voice so the others could not hear, \"and Major Goddard had eyes but for you--small blame to him!\"  Nancy drew a long, slow breath of relief, and the carmine receded from her cheeks.  \"Major Goddard is very good-looking,\" she said composedly. \"His coloring is a decided relief from the many blond men one meets nowadays. Blue-black hair and gray eyes are an unusual combination.\"  \"Did you see the President to-day, Senator?\" inquired their host, Colonel Mitchell, breaking in on the conversation; and Nancy sat back in her chair, glad of a moment's respite in which to collect her thoughts. Her head ached, and she pushed the soft hair from off her forehead with an impatient hand. Would her chaperone never make the move to leave?  Their table was in one corner, and Nancy sat with her back to the other diners. Mrs. Warren and the two men were soon absorbed in a heated argument as they slowly sipped their coffee. Nancy turned impatiently in her seat, and surveyed the animated scene behind her with restless, tired eyes.  Washington, filled with strangers from all sections of the country lying north of Mason and Dixon's line, was a city of perpetual unrest. Besides the soldiers stationed in the encircling camps and fortifications, regiments were continually passing through the capital on their way to and from the front. Statesmen, government contractors, and shoddy politicians haunted hotel lobbies and restaurants.  Gautier's, where many of the old residents and statesmen congregated, was more than usually crowded that night, and the Frenchman had difficulty in supplying the wants of his patrons; so earlier in the evening he had engaged extra waiters to meet the emergency.  The stringed orchestra in the gallery ceased playing, and in the momentary lull Nancy's quick ear caught fragments of conversation between two officers seated at the adjoining table. Interested, she gently edged her chair nearer to the men; then, leaning back, pretended to be absorbed in watching some new arrivals, as Sam, who was earning an honest penny by doing extra work on his night off from Wormley's, deftly removed the dessert plates.  \"I tell you, Jim,\" Nancy heard the older officer say positively, \"Grant intends to have Sheridan join him as soon as he breaks winter camp.\"  \"Nonsense, nonsense; the strategical movement would be to have him march south and re-enforce Sherman. That would mean the death knell of the Confederacy.\"  \"You are entirely wrong,\" returned the first speaker heatedly. \"Why, man, look here; suppose this pepper-caster is Richmond, this crust Petersburg, this crumb Lee, and this crumb Grant--now, bring this crumb, Sheridan...\" His words were drowned by the strains of \"The Girl I Left Behind Me,\" and the other diners in the room joined in the chorus.  At the conclusion of the song, Mrs. Warren gathered her belongings together, preparatory to departure. Colonel Mitchell, seeing his guests had finished supper, opened his pocketbook and drew out a roll of bank notes. As he thrust the money back into the pocketbook after paying his bill, a small folded piece of paper dropped unseen, except by Nancy, on the floor close beside her chair.  Like a flash she planted her foot squarely on it. Colonel Mitchell had risen to help Mrs. Warren into her wrap; the senator was busy talking to a newcomer. None of them had noticed her quick action. Dare she stoop over and pick up the paper? As she hesitated, their waiter, Sam, returned with the colonel's change. Mitchell waved the tray away impatiently, and the negro stepped back, dropping his napkin over Nancy's foot as he did so.  \"Please 'scuse me, missy.\" Stooping swiftly, he deftly lifted her foot and removed the paper as he picked up the cloth. \"Hyar's yo' napkin,\" laying it back in her lap; then in a voice that reached her ear alone, \"Look out, yo' am bein' watched.\"  \"Thank you, Sam.\" Nancy's voice was unruffled as her fingers closed spasmodically over the paper concealed in the napkin. Seeing her friends were still occupied, she seized her chance, and whispered rapidly: \"Go to Mr. Shriver's room at Wormley's, search behind the glass in the mirror over his bureau; then bring the paper you will find concealed there to me at the Perrys' to-night.\" Sam nodded understandingly. Nancy rose. \"Senator Warren, will you help me on with my coat.\"     CHAPTER VI  THE SIGNAL LIGHT   \"Are you sure you have made no mistake, Lloyd?\" whispered Colonel Baker in his companion's ear.  \"Positive, Colonel; I have laid my plans too carefully for that.\"  The two men were crouching behind a corner of a tumbled-down stone wall. Their position commanded a full view of an old square mansion standing some little distance from B Street. The galleries on the south side of the house overlooked a low, rolling meadow which ran down to the Potomac River.  \"Have you no proof against the girl?\"  \"No tangible proof so far, though I am morally certain she is the cleverest spy of them all.\"  \"Why not arrest her on suspicion?\"  \"What good would that accomplish? Her family and friends are the most influential in the District. Without actual proof of her guilt, you could not hold her forty-eight hours.\"  Colonel Baker moved restlessly. Such tactics were foreign to his nature. He believed in arresting first and investigating afterward. But his department had gone too far in a recent case, and he had been warned by no less a person than the President himself that his high-handed methods would no longer be tolerated.  \"My idea is to make her convict herself,\" resumed Lloyd, after a slight pause.  \"And you think your plot is going to work?\"  \"It has succeeded so far. I found out that Colonel Mitchell was entertaining Senator and Mrs. Warren, and that Miss Newton was to be of the party. The colonel's sentiments for her have changed within the last few days. I shouldn't be surprised if she had snubbed him, and wounded his vanity. Anyway he was quite willing to enter into a little scheme I suggested. I put it on purely patriotic motives, mind you,\" Lloyd smiled grimly to himself, \"that, as a loyal Union officer, it was his duty to assist me. So he wrote a bogus despatch, purporting to come from the adjutant-general, which he was to drop accidentally before Miss Newton, and then give her an opportunity to pick it up.\"  \"Did she do it?\"  \"I am positive she did, although I did not actually see her. I saw Mitchell, who managed it very cleverly, drop the paper, and as they left their table I walked over to it. The paper had disappeared from the floor.\"  \"Why didn't you arrest her then?\"  \"Because I want to find out her method of passing information on to the rebels. She may have a confederate who would carry out her schemes while she is in prison, and we would be none the wiser and still unable to stop the leak. I judged that the moment Miss Newton had time to read that paper she would instantly try to communicate with the rebels. And I judged rightly.\" He paused to look up and down the silent street.  \"Go on,\" whispered Baker impatiently.  \"Symonds and I shadowed her home. She stayed in the house just long enough to change her dress, then came on here by a circuitous route. She has been in there about ten minutes,\" nodding his head in the direction of the house.  \"I am glad I met you,\" rejoined Baker grimly. \"I enjoy being in at the death. Sure she cannot escape you?\"  \"The house is surrounded by my men. I am going to give her a few more minutes before I interrupt her little game.\"  Somewhere in the neighborhood a dog bayed, but there was no sign of life about the house, except a loose shutter banged dismally to and fro in the cutting east wind. No stars were out, and the men had to strain their eyes to make out objects in the dark. Suddenly Baker clutched Lloyd's arm and pointed to the south. A faint light had appeared from a window over the south portico, which grew brighter as it moved once to the left, then to the right, and then was raised, shedding a brilliant gleam on the deserted galleries.  \"Signaling, by God!\" swore Baker. \"Come, man, in with you.\"  He started to his feet, but Lloyd pulled him down again.  \"Wait,\" he cautioned. \"We can interfere there at any moment.\" Reluctantly Baker followed his advice. Five minutes, ten minutes passed on leaden feet to the anxious watchers. But their vigil was rewarded. Lloyd touched his companion on the shoulder, and muttered: \"If my eyes don't deceive me, here comes some one in answer to that signal.\"  Baker glanced up the deserted street, and dimly saw a man slowly approaching, apparently picking his way with care. The newcomer was nearly opposite the dilapidated entrance gate, when the side door of the house was cautiously opened and a figure stole out, and, making a quick dash through the gate, collided violently against him.  The Secret Service men were too far away to catch what was said, but they saw the two shake hands. Lloyd's men to the west of the house had witnessed the meeting, and, without waiting for a signal, were closing in on the pair, who stood still for a moment, then turned and walked straight toward the place where the two officers were crouching.  \"Given into our hands,\" muttered Baker exultingly; then, as the newcomer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24204"],["title","The Lost Despatch (#6)"],["body","almost in front of him, he sprang forward, and seized him in no uncertain grip. \"I've got you,\" he shouted in triumph.  The man straightened his bent shoulders to his full height; then stood passive.  \"Well, well, so you have,\" said a quiet voice, \"and what are you going to do about it?\"  \"A light here,\" roared Baker.  Obediently one of the soldiers who had come running up struck a match, and held it in the hollow of his hand so the wind would not extinguish it. As the tiny flame grew brighter, he raised the match, and the light fell full on the face of Baker's prisoner.  \"Good God! The President!\" gasped the colonel, and his hands fell nerveless by his side.     CHAPTER VII  THE MISCHANCES OF A NIGHT   Baker glanced hopelessly about him; at the President, who pulled his old gray shawl closer around his shoulders to keep out the chill wind; at Lloyd, who stood clutching Nancy by her arms; and at the soldiers who stood grouped about them. For once his feelings were beyond expression.  \"How long are you going to keep me here?\" inquired Lincoln patiently. \"And why did you jump at me like a Comanche Indian?\"  \"Not a mo-moment, sir,\" stuttered Baker. \"It was this young lady we were after. We had no intention at all of interfering with you.\"  \"And why do you want Miss Newton, Baker?\" asked Lincoln.  \"She is a rebel spy. We caught her signaling to-night.\"  \"I deny it,\" exclaimed Nancy hotly; and she tried to step forward, but Lloyd's strong arm held her back.  \"Mr. President, hear me just one moment.\" Lloyd spoke with great earnestness, and Lincoln turned to face him. One of the soldiers had found a half-burnt candle in his coat pocket, and by its feeble rays the President noticed Lloyd's detaining hand on Nancy's shoulder.  \"Release Miss Newton,\" he ordered sternly. \"Then tell your story in detail.\"  Reluctantly Lloyd did as he was told. \"This young lady picked up a piece of paper in Gautier's which I knew contained valuable information. I have suspected her for some days of supplying the Confederates with our secrets; so I followed her here, and saw the signal light. Colonel Baker and I thought you came up the street in answer to it. It was too dark to recognize you....\"  \"So you took me for a rebel spy?\"  \"I certainly am sorry for my precipitancy, Mr. President,\" said Baker apologetically. \"Thinking you were an accomplice of this lady's, I tried only to do my duty.\"  \"My shoulder and arm can testify to your zeal,\" chuckled Lincoln. \"Now, Miss Nancy, what have you to say to these charges?\"  \"I never picked up a paper, Mr. President,\" said Nancy firmly. \"On my return home to-night from Gautier's I found a message from my old mammy, Aunt Polly, saying she was very ill and that she needed me. She lives in that house with her son, who is the caretaker during Mr. Perry's absence. So I...\"  \"Disguised yourself and came here,\" broke in Lloyd insultingly.  \"If by 'disguise' you mean I changed my evening gown, I did--for this more suitable street dress.\" Nancy threw back her head haughtily. \"I am offering my explanation to the President; not to you, sir.\"  \"Continue your remarks, Miss Nancy,\" directed Lincoln quietly.  \"Why, that is all, Mr. President. After changing my gown I came here...\"  \"By side streets,\" again interposed Lloyd.  \"By side streets, because the more direct route is crowded with noisy men and women,\" answered Nancy calmly. \"I found Doctor Boyd here with Aunt Polly.\" Lloyd uttered another exclamation, but Nancy refused to pay heed. \"He advised that we move Aunt Polly into a room facing south as it would be warmer and more cheery for her in the daytime. Jasper and the doctor carried her there, and I went ahead with the lamp...\"  \"With which you have been signaling to the rebels,\" declared Lloyd roughly.  \"I did nothing of the sort,\" retorted Nancy vehemently. \"In trying to find a place to put the lamp down I walked backward and forward with it in my hand until I had pushed a table before the window. I then placed the lamp on it, and went to help the doctor. He told me my presence was no longer needed, and advised me to go home, as Aunt Metoaca would be alarmed by my long absence. Bidding Aunt Polly good night, I slipped out of the side entrance and ran into you at the gate, Mr. President.\"  \"Miss Nancy told me then,\" volunteered Lincoln, slowly, \"that she had been with Aunt Polly who was ill. I know Aunt Polly, too; we have frequent talks when I stroll down this street and she is working in the garden, or sweeping the driveway.\"  \"And I will take my oath to the truth of Nancy's story,\" said Doctor Boyd, stepping into the circle about the President. \"Aunt Polly had to undergo a minor operation, she insisted on Nancy being present, and to prevent the old woman working herself into a fever I sent for Nancy. I would have escorted her here myself, but my duties at the hospital prevented.\"  Lincoln nodded understandingly. \"It's all right, Doctor,\" he said soothingly. \"I believe Miss Nancy, and I guess our friend, Colonel Baker, does, also.\"  Baker looked doubtfully at Nancy. \"Yes,\" he muttered ungraciously, \"Miss Newton has made everything clear.\" He turned to address Lloyd, but the latter had disappeared.  \"Then suppose we walk on,\" said Lincoln. \"It is cold standing here. Your aunt called to see me this morning, Miss Nancy.\"  \"It was most kind of you to give us passes to Winchester.\" Nancy looked gratefully at the President as she tried to keep step with his long strides. \"The change will do Aunt Metoaca good, she has been too long in Washington without a change of air, and I am worried about her condition.\"  Lloyd rejoined the little procession at the corner of New York Avenue and Seventeenth Street. To the right gleamed the lights of the cavalry corral on the ellipse back of the White House, and on the left were the buildings of the quartermaster general's depot. Lloyd drew Baker to one side and whispered:  \"Apparently the girl has covered her tracks this time. Symonds and I entered the house and the darky, Jasper, and his mother repeated the same tale to me. We searched the house, but could find nothing suspicious. On leaving I stationed a guard about the grounds, for I am convinced she _did_ signal to some one who may try to enter the house later on.\"  \"Better give it up,\" growled Baker, whose temper had been sorely tried by his own exploit.  \"Never!\" Lloyd's teeth came together with an ominous click. \"I will trap that girl if it takes me months.\"  The President and Nancy led the way up Seventeenth Street to Pennsylvania Avenue and down that thoroughfare toward the White House. Lincoln stopped when he reached the entrance to the War Department.  \"I am going in here to read the latest despatches,\" he said. \"Good night, Doctor. Miss Nancy, when do you go to Winchester?\"  \"On the early train to-morrow, or, rather, this morning. Good night, Mr. President.\"  \"Good night and a safe journey to you.\" The President watched Nancy and Doctor Boyd out of sight; then turned to Baker. \"Don't take it to heart, man. I rather enjoyed your springing at me--it was a new sensation.\"  \"Indeed, Mr. President, you should not go out at this time of night without a guard,\" remonstrated Baker earnestly. \"Then such a thing would never have happened. It is not safe for you to walk about without proper protection.\"  \"Baker,\" said the President reminiscently, \"you remind me of the little girl who had just been told of the omnipresence of God, and was so upset that she turned angrily upon her pet dog, saying: 'Go back in the house, Peggy. It's bad enough having God tagging 'round, without you.' Good night, Baker,\" and Lincoln disappeared inside the War Department.     CHAPTER VIII  A VOICE FROM THE PAST   Some hours later Doctor Boyd stepped inside his hall and softly closed the front door. Quickly removing his hat and heavy cloak, he went directly into his back office and felt about in the dark for his match box. It was not to be found in its accustomed place, and an angry exclamation escaped the doctor. Apparently Martha Crane, his trusted old housekeeper, had taken advantage of his absence and tidied up his desk, an act of vandalism which always reduced Boyd to a state bordering on frenzy.  \"Kin I help yo', suh?\"  Doctor Boyd's right hand sought his hip pocket, and he faced in the direction from which the voice came. The intruder guessed his intention and spoke hastily.  \"Fo' God's sake, doan shoot, suh. I'se Sam.\" And to confirm his statement he struck a match and held it so that his features were visible by the flickering flame.  \"Well, come in and light this confounded burner,\" exclaimed the doctor testily, as his fingers slowly relaxed their hold on his weapon. \"Next time don't announce your presence so dramatically, Sam, or you may get hurt.\"  \"Yessir.\" The negro stepped with alacrity through the doorway which led to the front office, and applied his half burned match to the gas jet over the doctor's desk. \"Miss Martha done told me ter wait in dar.\"  \"Confound the woman!\" The doctor seated himself in his armchair and contemplated the neatly arranged papers and ornaments on his desk in despair. \"Where is she?\"  \"Done gone out,\" announced Sam briefly. \"I tole her I'd be 'sponsible fo' de house 'til she cum back.\"  \"Where were you to-night, Sam? Miss Nancy expected you to meet her at the Perry's.\"  \"I went dar, suh, but I seed a lot ob men a-hangin' 'roun' watchin' de place, so I jes' cum on heah, thinkin' p'raps Miss Nancy mite be wif yo'. I done got de papah she wanted.\"  \"Miss Nancy leaves at nine o'clock for Winchester.\"  \"Golly! Den I mus' git right 'roun' an' gib her dis heah papah.\" Sam started for the door.  \"Stop!\" commanded Boyd. \"The Newtons' house is also watched by Secret Service agents. I saw them sneaking about the yard when I left Miss Nancy an hour ago. If you go there at this hour you will be arrested instantly.\"  Sam scratched his woolly head in perplexity. \"I reckon if I jes' go to der back alley an' whistle "]]]
