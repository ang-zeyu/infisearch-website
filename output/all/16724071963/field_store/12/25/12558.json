'orrible!!!\"  Leander seized the opportunity. \"Excuse me,\" he said politely, \"but if you don't like the music, perhaps you wouldn't mind giving up this young lady to me?\"  \"Oh come, I say!\" said the man of war, running his fingers through his short curly hair; \"my good feller, you'd better see what the lady says to that!\" (He evidently had no doubt himself.)  \"I'm very well content as I am, thank you all the same, Mr. Tweddle,\" said Ada, unkindly adding in a lower tone, \"If you're so anxious to dance, dance with Terpsy-chore!\"  And again he was left to watch the whirling couples with melancholy eyes. The corporal's brother-in-arms was wheeling round with a plain young person, apparently in domestic service, whose face was overspread by a large red smile of satiated ambition. James and Bella flitted by, dancing vigorously, and Bella's discontent seemed to have vanished for the time. There were jigging couples and prancing couples; couples that bounced round like imprisoned bees, and couples that glided past in calm and conscious superiority. He alone stood apart, excluded from the happy throng, and he began to have a pathetic sense of injury.  But the music stopped at last, and Ada, dismissing her partner, came towards him. \"You don't seem to be enjoying yourself, Mr. Tweddle,\" she said maliciously.  \"Don't I?\" he replied. \"Well, so long as you are, it don't matter, Miss Parkinson--it don't matter.\"  \"But I'm not--at least, I didn't that dance,\" she said. \"That soldier man did talk such rubbish, and he trod on my feet twice. I'm so hot! I wonder if it's cooler outside?\"  \"Will you come and see?\" he suggested, and this time she did not disdain his arm, and they strolled out together.  Following a path they had hitherto left unexplored, they came to a little enclosure surrounded by tall shrubs; in the centre, upon a low pedestal, stood a female statue, upon which a gas lamp, some paces off, cast a flickering gleam athwart the foliage.  The exceptional grace and beauty of the figure would have been apparent to any lover of art. She stood there, her right arm raised, partly in gracious invitation, partly in queenly command, her left hand extended, palm downwards, as if to be reverentially saluted. The hair was parted in boldly indicated waves over the broad low brow, and confined by a fillet in a large loose knot at the back. She was clad in a long chiton, which lapped in soft zig-zag folds over the girdle and fell to the feet in straight parallel lines, and a chlamys hanging from her shoulders concealed the left arm to the elbow, while it left the right arm free.  In the uncertain light one could easily fancy soft eyes swimming in those wide blank sockets, and the ripe lips were curved by a dreamy smile, at once tender and disdainful.  Leander Tweddle and Miss Ada Parkinson, however, stood before the statue in an unmoved, not to say critical, mood.  \"Who's she supposed to be, I wonder?\" asked the young lady, rather as if the sculptor were a harmless lunatic whose delusions took a marble shape occasionally. This, by the way, is a question which may frequently be heard in picture galleries, and implies an enlightened tolerance.  \"I don't know,\" said Leander; \"a foreign female, I fancy--that's Russian on the pedestal.\" He inferred this from a resemblance to the characters on certain packets of cigarettes.  \"But there's some English underneath,\" said Ada; \"I can just make it out. Ap--Apro--Aprodyte. What a funny name!\"  \"You haven't prenounced it quite correckly,\" he said; \"out there they sound the ph like a f, and give all the syllables--Afroddity.\" He felt a kind of intuition that this was nearer the correct rendering.  \"Well,\" observed Ada, \"she's got a silly look, don't you think?\"  Leander was less narrow, and gave it as his opinion that she had been \"done from a fine woman.\"  Ada remarked that she herself would never consent to be taken in so unbecoming a costume. \"One might as well have no figure at all in things hanging down for all the world like a sack,\" she said.  Proceeding to details, she was struck by the smallness of the hands; and it must be admitted that, although the statue as a whole was slightly above the average female height, the arms from the elbow downwards, and particularly the hands, were by no means in proportion, and almost justified Miss Parkinson's objection, that \"no woman could have hands so small as that.\"  \"I know some one who has--quite as small,\" said he softly.  Ada instantly drew off one of the crimson gloves and held out her hand beside the statue's. It was a well-shaped hand, as she very well knew, but it was decidedly larger than the one with which she compared it. \"I _said_ so,\" she observed; \"now are you satisfied, Mr. Tweddle?\"  But he had been thinking of a hand more slender and dainty than hers, and allowed himself to admit as much. \"I--I wasn't meaning you at all,\" he said bluntly.  She laughed a little jarring laugh. \"Oh, Matilda, of course! Nobody is like Matilda now! But come, Mr. Tweddle, you're not going to stand there and tell me that this wonderful Matilda of yours has hands no bigger than those?\"  \"She has been endowed with quite remarkable small hands,\" said he; \"you wouldn't believe it without seeing. It so happens,\" he added suddenly, \"that I can give you a very fair ideer of the size they are, for I've got a ring of hers in my pocket at this moment. It came about this way: my aunt (the same that used to let her second floor to James, and that Matilda lodges with at present), my aunt, as soon as she heard of our being engaged, nothing would do but I must give Matilda an old ring with a posy inside it, that was in our family, and we soon found the ring was too large to keep on, and I left it with old Vidler, near my place of business, to be made tighter, and called for it on my way here this very afternoon, and fortunately enough it was ready.\"  He took out the ring from its bed of pink cotton wool, and offered it to Miss Parkinson.  \"You see if you can get it on,\" he said; \"try the little finger!\"  She drew back, offended. \"_I_ don't want to try it, thank you,\" she said (she felt as if she might fling it into the bushes if she allowed herself to touch it). \"If you _must_ try it on somebody, there's the statue! You'll find no difficulty in getting it on any of her fingers--or thumbs,\" she added.  \"You shall see,\" said Leander. \"My belief is, it's too small for her, if anything.\"  He was a true lover; anxious to vindicate his lady's perfections before all the world, and perhaps to convince himself that his estimate was not exaggerated. The proof was so easy, the statue's left hand hung temptingly within his reach; he accepted the challenge, and slipped the ring up the third finger, that was slightly raised as if to receive it. The hand struck no chill, so moist and mild was the evening, but felt warm and almost soft in his grasp.  \"There,\" he said triumphantly, \"it might have been made for her!\"  [Illustration: \"THERE,\" HE SAID TRIUMPHANTLY, \"IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE FOR HER!\"]  \"Well,\" said Ada, not too consistently, \"I never said it mightn't!\"  \"Excuse me,\" said he, \"but you said it would be too large for her; and, if you'll believe me, it's as much as I can do to get it off her finger, it fits that close.\"  \"Well, make haste and get it off, Mr. Tweddle, do,\" said Ada, impatiently. \"I've stayed out quite long enough.\"  \"In one moment,\" he replied; \"it's quite a job, I declare, quite a job!\"  \"Oh, you men are so clumsy!\" cried Ada. \"Let _me_ try.\"  \"No, no!\" he said, rather irritably; \"I can manage it,\" and he continued to fumble.  At last he looked over his shoulder and said, \"It's a singler succumstance, but I can't get the ring past the bend of the finger.\"  Ada was cruel enough to burst out laughing. \"It's a judgment upon you, Mr. Tweddle!\" she cried.  \"You dared me to it!\" he retorted. \"It isn't friendly of you, I must say, Miss Parkinson, to set there enjoying of it--it's bad taste!\"  \"Well, then, I'm very sorry, Mr. Tweddle; I won't laugh any more; but, for goodness' sake, take me back to the Hall now.\"  \"It's coming!\" he said; \"I'm working it over the joint now--it's coming quite easily.\"  \"But I can't wait here while it comes,\" she said. \"Do you want me to go back alone? You're not very polite to me this evening, I must say.\"  \"What am I to do?\" he said distractedly. \"This ring is my engagement ring; it's valuable. I can't go away without it!\"  \"The statue won't run away--you can come back again, by-and-by. You don't expect me to spend the rest of the evening out here? I never thought you could be rude to a lady, Mr. Tweddle.\"  \"No more I can,\" he said. \"Your wishes, Miss Ada, are equivocal to commands; allow me the honour of reconducting you to the Baronial Hall.\"  He offered his arm in his best manner; she took it, and together they passed out of the enclosure, leaving the statue in undisturbed possession of the ring.     PLEASURE IN PURSUIT  II.    \"And you, great sculptor, so you gave   A score of years to Art, her slave,   And that's your Venus, whence we turn   To yonder girl----\"   Another waltz had just begun as they re-entered the Baronial Hall, and Ada glanced up at her companion from her daring brown eyes. \"What would you say if I told you you might have this dance with me?\" she inquired.  The hairdresser hesitated for just one moment. He had meant to leave her there and go back for his ring; but the waltz they were playing was a very enticing one. Ada was looking uncommonly pretty just then; he could get the ring equally well a few minutes later.  \"I should take it very kind of you,\" he said, gratefully, at length.  \"Ask for it, then,\" said Ada; and he did ask for it.  He forgot Matilda and his engagement for the moment; he sacrificed all his scruples about dancing in public; but he somehow failed to enjoy this pleasure, illicit though it was.  For one thing, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24197"],["title","The Tinted Venus: A Farcical Romance (#4)"],["body","could not long keep Matilda out of his thoughts. He was doing nothing positively wrong; still, it was undeniable that she would not approve of his being there at all, still less if she knew that the gold ring given to him by his aunt for the purposes of his betrothal had been left on the finger of a foreign statue, and exposed to the mercy of any passer-by, while he waltzed with a bonnet-maker's assistant.  And his conscience was awakened still further by the discovery that Ada was a somewhat disappointing partner. \"She's not so light as she used to be,\" he thought, \"and then she jumps. I'd forgotten she jumped.\"  Before the waltz was nearly over he led her back to a chair, alleging as his excuse that he was afraid to abandon his ring any longer, and hastened away to the spot where it was to be found.  He went along the same path, and soon came to an enclosure; but no sooner had he entered it than he saw that he must have mistaken his way; this was not the right place. There was no statue in the middle.  He was about to turn away, when he saw something that made him start; it was a low pedestal in the centre, with the same characters upon it that he had read with Ada. It was the place, after all; yes, he could not be mistaken; he knew it now.  Where was the statue which had so lately occupied that pedestal? Had it fallen over amongst the bushes? He felt about for it in vain. It must have been removed for some purpose while he had been dancing; but by whom, and why?  The best way to find out would be to ask some one in authority. The manager was in the Baronial Hall, officiating as M.C.; he would go and inquire whether the removal had been by his orders.  He was fortunate enough to catch him as he was coming out of the hall, and he seized him by the arm with nervous haste. \"Mister,\" he began, \"if you've found one of your plaster figures with a gold ring on, it's mine. I--I put it on in a joking kind of way, and I had to leave it for awhile; and now, when I come back for it, it's gone!\"  \"I'm sorry to hear it, sir,\" returned the manager; \"but really, if you will leave gold rings on our statues, we can't be responsible, you know.\"  \"But you'll excuse me,\" pursued Leander; \"I don't think you quite understood me. It isn't only the ring that's gone--it's the statue; and if you've had it put up anywhere else----\"  \"Nonsense!\" said the manager; \"we don't move our statues about like chessmen; you've forgotten where you left it, that's all. What was the statue like?\"  Leander described it as well as he could, and the manager, with a somewhat altered manner, made him point out the spot where he believed it to have stood, and they entered the grove together.  The man gave one rapid glance at the vacant pedestal, and then gripped Leander by the shoulder, and looked at him long and hard by the feeble light. \"Answer me,\" he said, roughly; \"is this some lark of yours?\"  [Illustration: \"ANSWER ME,\" HE SAID ROUGHLY; \"IS THIS SOME LARK OF YOURS?\"]  \"I look larky, don't I?\" said poor Tweedle, dolefully. \"I thought you'd be sure to know where it was.\"  \"I wish to heaven I did!\" cried the manager, passionately; \"it's those impudent blackguards.... They've done it under my very nose!\"  \"If it's any of your men,\" suggested Leander, \"can't you make them put it back again?\"  \"It's not any of my men. I was warned, and, like a fool, I wouldn't believe it could be done at a time like this; and now it's too late, and what am I to say to the inspector? I wouldn't have had this happen for a thousand pounds!\"  \"Well, it's kind of you to feel so put out about it,\" said Leander. \"You see, what makes the ring so valuable to me----\"  The manager was pacing up and down impatiently, entirely ignoring his presence.  \"I say,\" Tweddle repeated, \"the reason why that ring's of partickler importance----\"  \"Oh, don't bother _me_!\" said the other, shaking him off. \"I don't want to be uncivil, but I've got to think this out.... Infernal rascals!\" he went on muttering.  \"Have the goodness to hear what I've got to say, though,\" persisted Leander. \"I'm mixed up in this, whether you like it or not. You seem to know who's got this figure, and I've a right to be told too. I won't go till I get that ring back; so now you understand me!\"  \"Confound you and your ring!\" said the manager. \"What's the good of coming bully-ragging me about your ring? _I_ can't get you your ring! You shouldn't have been fool enough to put it on one of our statues. You make me talk to you like this, coming bothering when I've enough on my mind as it is! Hang it! Can't you see I'm as anxious to get that statue again as ever you can be? If I don't get it, I may be a ruined man, for all I know; ain't that enough for you? Look here, take my advice, and leave me alone before we have words over this. You give me your name and address, and you may rely on hearing from me as soon as anything turns up. You can do no good to yourself or any one else by making a row; so go away quiet like a sensible chap!\"  Leander felt stunned by the blow; evidently there was nothing to be done but follow the manager's advice. He went to the office with him, and gave his name and address in full, and then turned back alone to the dancing-hall.  He had lost his ring--no ordinary trinket which he could purchase anywhere, but one for which he would have to account--and to whom? To his aunt and Matilda. How could he tell, when there was even a chance of seeing it again?  If only he had not allowed himself that waltz; if only he had insisted upon remaining by the statue until his ring was removed; if only he had not been such an idiot as to put it on! None of these acts were wrong exactly; but between them they had brought him to this.  And the chief person responsible was Miss Ada Parkinson, whom he dared not reproach; for he was naturally unwilling that this last stage of the affair should become known. He would have to dissemble, and he rejoined his party with what he intended for a jaunty air.  \"We've been waiting for you to go away,\" said Bella. \"Where have you been all this time?\"  He saw with relief that Ada did not appear to have mentioned the statue, and so he said he had been \"strolling about.\"  \"And Ada left to take care of herself!\" said Bella, spitefully. \"You are polite, Mr. Tweddle, I must say!\"  \"I haven't complained, Bella, that I know of,\" said Ada. \"And Mr. Tweddle and I quite understand each other, don't we?\"  \"Oh!\" said Bella, with an altered manner and a side-glance at James, \"I didn't know. I'm very glad to hear it, I'm sure.\"  And then they left the gardens, and, after a substantial meal at a riverside hotel, started on the homeward journey, with the sense that their expedition had not been precisely a success.  As before, they had a railway compartment to themselves. Bella declined to talk, and lay back in her corner with closed eyes and an expression of undeserved suffering, whilst the unfortunate Jauncy sat silent and miserable opposite.  Leander would have liked to be silent too, and think out his position; but Ada would not hear of this. Her jealous resentment had apparently vanished, and she was extremely lively and playful in her sallies.  This reached a pitch when she bent forward, and, in a whisper, which she did not, perhaps, intend to be quite confidential, said, \"Oh, Mr. Tweddle, you never told me what became of the ring! Is it off at last?\"  \"Off? yes!\" he said irritably, very nearly adding, \"and the statue too.\"  \"Weren't you very glad!\" said she.  \"Uncommonly,\" he replied grimly.  \"Let me see it again, now you've got it back,\" she pleaded.  \"You'll excuse me,\" he said; \"but after what has taken place, I can't show that ring to anybody.\"  \"Then you're a cross thing!\" said Ada, pouting.  \"What's the matter with you two, over there?\" asked Bella, sleepily.  Ada's eyes sparkled with mischief. \"Let me tell them; it is too awfully funny. I _must_!\" she whispered to Leander. \"It's all about a ring,\" she began, and enjoyed poor Tweddle's evident discomfort.  \"A ring?\" cried Bella, waking up. \"Don't keep all the fun to yourselves; we've not had so much of it this evening.\"  \"Miss Ada,\" said Leander, in great agitation, \"I ask you, as a lady, to treat what has happened this evening in the strictest confidence for the present!\"  \"Secrets, Ada?\" cried her sister; \"upon my word!\"  \"Why, where's the harm, Mr. Tweddle, now it's all settled?\" exclaimed Ada. \"Bella, it was only this: he went and put a ring (now do wait till I've done, Mr. Tweddle!) on a certain person's finger out in those Rosherwich Gardens (you see, I've not said _whose_ finger).\"  \"Hullo, Tweddle!\" cried Jauncy, in some bewilderment.  Leander could only cast a look of miserable appeal at him.  \"Shall I tell them any more, Mr. Tweddle?\" said Ada, persistently.  \"I don't think there's any necessity,\" he pleaded.  \"No more do I,\" put in Bella, archly. \"I think we can guess the rest.\"  Ada did not absolutely make any further disclosures that evening; but for the rest of the journey she amused herself by keeping the hairdresser in perpetual torment by her pretended revelations, until he was thoroughly disgusted.  No longer could he admire her liveliness; he could not even see that she was good-looking now. \"She's nothing but chaff, chaff, chaff!\" he thought. \"Thank goodness, Matilda isn't given that way. Chaff before marriage means nagging after!\"  They reached the terminus at last, when he willingly said farewell to the other three.  \"Good-bye, Mr. Tweddle,\" said Bella, in rather a more cordial tone; \"I needn't hope _you_'ve enjoyed yourself!\"  \"You needn't!\" he replied, almost savagely.  \"Good night,\" said Ada; and added in a whisper, \"Don't go and dream of your statue-woman!\"  \"If I dream to-night at all,\" he said, between his teeth, \"it will be a nightmare!\"  \"I suppose, Tweddle, old chap,\" said Jauncy, as he shook hands, \"you know your own affairs best; but, if you meant what you told me coming down, you've been going it,"]]]
