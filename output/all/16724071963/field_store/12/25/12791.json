[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24488"],["title","Rollo in Naples (#1)"],["body","were so many wars and commotions among the people of the different towns and kingdoms, that nothing was stable or safe. For the same reason it was useless for men to spend their money in building and ornamenting their own houses, for at the first approach of an enemy, the town in which they lived was likely to be sacked, and their houses, and all the fine furniture which they might contain, would be burned or destroyed.  But the churches were safe. The people of the different countries had so much veneration for sacred places, and for every thing connected with religion, that they were afraid to touch or injure any thing that had been consecrated to a religious use. To plunder a church, or a convent, or an abbey, or to do any thing to injure or destroy the property that they contained, was regarded as _sacrilege_; and sacrilege they deemed a dreadful crime, abhorred by God and man. Thus, while they would burn and destroy hundreds of dwellings without any remorse, and turn the wretched inmates out at midnight into the streets to die of exposure, terror, and despair, they would stop at once when they came to the church, afraid to harm it in any way, or to touch the least thing that it contained. Accordingly, while every thing else in a conquered town was doomed to the most reckless destruction, all that was in the church,--the most delicate paintings, and the most costly gold and silver images and utensils--were as safe as if they were surrounded by impregnable castle walls.  Of course these notions were very mistaken ones. According to the teachings of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, it must be a greater sin to burn down the cottage of a poor widow, and turn her out at midnight into the streets to die, than to plunder for gain the richest altar in the world.  From these and various other similar causes, it happened that, in the middle ages,--that is, from five hundred to a thousand years ago,--almost all the great expenditures of money, in all the great cities and towns of Europe, were made for churches. Sometimes these churches were so large that they were several hundred years in building. One generation would begin, another would continue, and a third would finish the work; that is, provided the finishing work was ever done. Great numbers of them remain unfinished to the present day, and always will remain so.  It is generally, however, the exterior which remains incomplete. Within they are magnificent beyond description. They are so profusely adorned with altars, chapels, crucifixes, paintings, vessels of gold and silver, and with sculptures and monuments of every kind, that on entering them one is quite bewildered with the magnificence of the scene.  There are a great many different altars where divine service may be performed, some arranged along the sides of the church, in the recesses between the pillars, and others in the transepts, and in various little chapels opening here and there from the transepts and the aisles; and so extensive and vast is the interior that sometimes four or five different congregations are engaged in worship in different parts of the church at the same time, without at all disturbing one another.  One of the most celebrated of these great churches is the cathedral at Florence, where Mr. George and Rollo were now staying. There is a representation of it on the next page, which will give you some idea of its form, though it can convey no conception of its immense magnitude.  The dome that surmounts the centre of the building is the largest in the world. It was a hundred years after the church was commenced before the dome was put on. The dome is about a hundred and forty feet wide from side to side, and almost as high as it is wide. It is more than a hundred and thirty feet high, which is enough for twelve or fifteen stories of a good-sized house. And this is the dome alone. The whole height of the church, from the ground to the top of the cross, is nearly four hundred feet. You will get a better idea of how high this is, if you ask of your father, or of some one that knows, what the height is of some tall steeple near where you live.  When the architect who conceived the idea of finishing the church by putting this dome upon it first proposed it, the other architects of the town declared that it could not be done. It was impossible, they said, to build so large a dome on the top of so lofty a building. But he insisted that it was not impossible. He could not only build the dome at that height, but he could first build an octagonal lantern, he said, on the top of the church, and then build the dome upon that, which would carry the dome up a great deal higher. At last they consented to let him make the attempt; and he succeeded. You see the dome in the engraving, and the octagonal lantern beneath it, on which it rests. The lantern is the part which has the round windows.  You see to the left of the church, at the farther end, a tall, square tower. This is the bell tower. There are six bells in it. It was designed to have a spire upon it, but the spire has not yet been built, and perhaps it never will be.  [Illustration: A CHURCH AT FLORENCE.]  This bell tower alone cost an enormous sum of money. It is faced on every side, as indeed the church itself is, with different colored marbles, and the four walls of it, on the outside, are so profusely adorned with sculptures, statues, and other costly and elaborate architectural decorations, that it would take a week to examine them fully in detail.  The part of the church which is presented to view in the engraving is the end. The front proper is on a line with the farther side of the bell tower. The engraving does not show us the length of the edifice at all, except so far as we gain an idea of it by the long procession which we see at the side. As I have already said, the length is more than five hundred feet, which is nearly half a quarter of a mile.  The putting on of the dome was considered the greatest achievement in the building of the church; and the architect who planned and superintended the work gained for himself immortal honor. After his death a statue of him was made, and placed in a niche in the wall of the houses on one side of the square, opposite the dome. He is represented as sitting in a chair, holding a plan of the work in his hand, and looking up to see it as it appeared completed. We can just see this statue in the foreground of the picture, on the left.  And now I must return to the story.  While Mr. George and Rollo were in Florence, Rollo was occupied mainly, as I have already said, in rambling about the town, and observing the scenes of real and active life, which every where met his view in the streets and squares, while Mr. George spent his time chiefly in the churches, and in the galleries of painting and sculpture, studying the works of art. One morning after breakfast, Mr. George was going to the great gallery in the palace of the grand duke, to spend the day there. Rollo said that he would walk with him a little way. So they walked together along the street which led by the bank of the river.  \"Uncle George,\" said Rollo, \"how much longer is it going to take for you to study these paintings and statues till you are satisfied?\"  \"Five or ten years,\" said Mr. George.  \"O uncle George!\" exclaimed Rollo; \"I have seen as much of them as _I_ want to see already.\"  \"You have not seen one of them yet,\" said Mr. George.  \"Not seen one of them!\" repeated Rollo.  \"No, not one of them,\" replied Mr. George.  \"I don't know what you mean by that,\" said Rollo.  \"I'll show you what I mean some time or other,\" said Mr. George, \"when you are in one of the galleries with me.\"  \"I should like to have you,\" said Rollo; \"but now I really want to know when you are going to be ready to go on towards Naples. I'd rather see Mount Vesuvius than all the paintings in the world, especially if there is a good blazing eruption coming out of it, and plenty of red-hot stones.\"  \"The first question to be settled,\" said Mr. George, \"is, how we shall go.\"  \"Are there more ways than one?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"there are three or four ways. We are here at Florence, in the interior of the country, and Rome is also in the interior; but there is a seaport on the coast for each city. So we can go from here to Leghorn, which is the seaport for Florence, by the railroad, and there we can take a steamboat and go to Civita Vecchia, which is the seaport for Rome. There we can land and go up to Rome in some sort of a carriage.\"  \"I like that way,\" said Rollo. \"I like that best of all. There are a railroad and a steamboat both in it.\"  \"Another way,\" continued Mr. George, \"is, we can go by the malle post.\"[A]  [Footnote A: The malle post is a sort of despatch carriage, that takes the mails. It can take also two or three passengers. They change horses very often with the malle post, and drive very fast.]  \"I should like to go by the malle post,\" said Rollo; \"they keep the horses on the gallop almost all the way.\"  \"Then again,\" continued Mr. George, \"if we choose we can engage a vetturino.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rollo; \"there are plenty of them always standing out here by the bridge. They ask me almost, every day, when I go by, whether I want a carriage. 'Want a carriage, sir,' they say, 'to go to Rome, to Naples, to Venice, to Genoa?'\"  Here Rollo repeated the words of the vetturini, imitating the peculiar intonations with which they spoke, in quite a skilful manner: \"To Rome! Naples! Venice! Nice! Genoa!\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George, \"those are the men.\"  \"And, come to think of it,\" said Rollo, \"I believe, after all, I would rather go with a vetturino. We ride along so pleasantly day after day, and go through all the towns, cracking our whip, and seeing so many curious things all along the road side!\"  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"but there is one difficulty. We are only two, and the carriages of the vetturini are usually large enough for four or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24488"],["title","Rollo in Naples (#2)"],["body","ix.\"  \"And would not they go for two?\" asked Rollo.  \"O, yes,\" said Mr. George; \"they will go for two; but then the men must have full price for their carriage and horses, and that makes it very expensive for two.\"  \"What do people do, then,\" asked Rollo, \"when there are only two to go?\"  \"They generally find some other people that want to go,\" replied Mr. George, \"and make up a party, and so divide the expense.\"  \"And can't we do that?\" asked Rollo.  \"We do not know any body here,\" said Mr. George.  Rollo did not know what to say to this, and so he was silent, and walked along, thinking what it was best to do. Presently, after a moment's pause, he added,--  \"I mean to ask some of the vetturinos if they have not got a carriage for two.\"  \"_Vetturini_ is the plural of vetturino, in Italian,\" said Mr. George, \"and not vetturinos.\"  \"But I am not speaking Italian,\" said Rollo; \"I am speaking English.\"  \"True,\" said Mr. George.  At this stage of the conversation Mr. George and Rollo arrived at the end of the bridge across the Arno, which Mr. George had to pass over in going to his gallery. This bridge is a very ancient one, and is quite a curiosity, as it is built massively of stone, and is lined with a row of shops on each side, so that in passing over it you would think it was a street instead of a bridge, were it not that the shops are so small that you can look directly through them, and see the river through the windows on the back side.  These shops are occupied by jewellers, who keep for sale the mosaic pins, bracelets, and earrings, for which Florence is so famous, and great numbers of these mosaics, as well as various other kinds of jewelry, are exposed to view in little show cases that are arranged in a curious manner, on small counters before the windows, so that any one can see them all in passing along.  On reaching this bridge, Rollo concluded to stop, and look at the mosaics, and so his uncle left him and went on alone.  As Rollo was standing at one of the little shop windows a few minutes after his uncle had left him, a man dressed in a blue frock, and with a sort of woollen comforter of bright colors about his neck, came up to him, and asked him in French whether the party that he belonged to did not want a carriage to go to Rome. Rollo perceived at once that the man was a vetturino.  \"I don't know but that we do,\" said he. \"Have you got a carriage?\"  \"Yes,\" replied the vetturino; \"I have got a large and very nice carriage, and four excellent horses.\"  \"Then it won't do,\" said Rollo, \"for there are only two in our party, and a large carriage and four horses will be more than we need.\"  \"O, but that will make no difference,\" said the vetturino. \"You see I'm a return, and I will take you about as cheap as you can go in a small carriage.\"  \"For how much?\" asked Rollo.  \"Why, my price is three napoleons a day,\" said the vetturino, \"for a full party; but as you are only two, I will take you for less. Have you got a great deal of baggage?\"  \"No; very little,\" said Rollo.  After some further conversation with the vetturino, Rollo concluded to make an appointment with him to come to the hotel that evening and see his uncle George.  \"Come immediately after dinner,\" said Rollo.  \"At what time?\" asked the vetturino.  \"Why, we dine at half past six,\" said Rollo, \"and uncle George will be through at eight.\"  \"Then I will come at eight,\" said the vetturino.  One reason why Rollo concluded to make this appointment was, that he particularly liked the vetturino's appearance. He had an open and intelligent countenance, and his air and bearing were such as to give Rollo the idea that he was a very good-natured and sociable, as well as capable man. In answer to a question from Rollo, he said that his name was Vittorio.  When Mr. George came home that evening, a short time before dinner, Rollo told him what he had done.  \"Good!\" said Mr. George. \"We are in luck. I should not be surprised if we should be able to fill his carriage for him. I have found a party.\"  Mr. George further stated to Rollo that, in rambling through the rooms of the gallery where he had been spending the day, he had met with a lady of his acquaintance who was travelling with two children and a maid, and that he had been talking with her about forming a party to travel together to Naples.  \"Are the children girls or boys?\" asked Rollo.  \"One of them is a girl and the other is a boy,\" said Mr. George; \"but the girl is sick.\"  \"Is she?\" asked Rollo.  \"At least she has been sick,\" said Mr. George. \"She has had a fever, but now she is slowly getting well. Her name is Rosalie.\"  \"I think that is rather a sentimental name,\" said Rollo.  \"They call her Rosie, sometimes,\" said Mr. George.  \"That's a little better,\" said Rollo, \"but not much. And what is her other name?\"  \"Gray,\" said Mr. George.         *       *       *       *       *  Vittorio came at eight o'clock that evening, according to appointment. The first thing that Mr. George did was to propose to go and see his carriage. So they all went together to see it. It was in a stable near by. Mr. George and Rollo were both well pleased with the carriage. It had four seats inside, like an ordinary coach. Besides these there were two good seats outside, under a sort of canopy which came forward over them like a chaise top. In front of these, and a little lower down, was the driver's seat.  The inside of such a coach is called the interior.[B] The place outside, under the chaise top, is called the _coupé_.[C] Rollo generally called it the _coop_.  [Footnote B: In French, _l'interieur_.]  [Footnote C: Pronounced _coopay_, only the last syllable is spoken rather short.]  The chaise top in front could be turned back, so as to throw the two seats there entirely open. In the same manner the top of the interior could be opened, so as to make the carriage a barouche.  \"It is just exactly such a carriage as we want,\" said Rollo, \"if Mrs. Gray will only let you and me have the coop.\"  \"We'll see about that,\" said Mr. George.  Mr. George then proceeded to discuss with Vittorio the terms and conditions of the agreement which should be made between them, in case the party should conclude to hire the carriage; and after ascertaining precisely what they were, he told Vittorio that he would decide the next morning, and he appointed ten o'clock as the time when Vittorio was to call to get the decision. Mr. George and Rollo then went back to the hotel.  \"Why did not you engage him at once?\" asked Rollo, as they walked along. \"It was such a good carriage!\"  \"Because I want first to see what terms and conditions I can make with Mrs. Gray,\" replied Mr. George.  \"Why?\" asked Rollo; \"don't you think she will be willing to pay her share?\"  \"O, yes,\" said Mr. George. \"She says she is willing to pay the whole, if I will only let her go with us.\"  \"And shall you let her pay the whole?\" asked Rollo.  \"No, indeed,\" replied Mr. George. \"I shall let her pay her share, which will be just two thirds, for she has four in her party, and we are two.\"  \"And so her portion will be four sixths,\" said Rollo, \"and that is the same as two thirds.\"  \"Exactly,\" said Mr. George.  \"So then it is all settled,\" said Rollo.  \"About the money it is,\" replied Mr. George; \"but that was not what I referred to. When two parties form a plan for travelling together in the same carriage for many days, it is necessary to have a very precise understanding beforehand about every thing, or else in the end they are very sure to quarrel.\"  \"To quarrel!\" repeated Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"and generally the more intimate their friendship for each other is before they set out, the more sure they are to quarrel in the end.\"  \"That's curious,\" said Rollo.  \"They begin by being very polite to each other,\" continued Mr. George; \"but by and by, a thousand questions begin to come up, and there is nobody to decide them. For a time each one professes a great readiness to yield to the other; but before long each begins to think that the other assumes too much of the direction. Mrs. A. thinks that Mrs. B. keeps the carriage too much shut up, or that she always manages to have the best seat; and Mrs. B. thinks that Mrs. A. takes the best room too often at the hotels; or that she is never ready at the proper time; or that she always manages to have what she likes at the hotels, without paying enough regard to the wishes of the rest of the party.\"  \"Is that the way they act?\" asked Rollo.  \"Yes,\" said Mr. George; \"that is the way exactly. I have heard the secret history of a great many travelling parties that began very brightly, but ended in heart-burnings, miffs, and all sorts of troubles. The only way to prevent this is to have a very definite and precise understanding on all these points before we set out. And that is what I am going to have with Mrs. Gray.\"  \"And suppose she won't come to any agreement,\" said Rollo. \"She'll say, 'La, it's no matter. We shall not quarrel.'\"  \"Then I won't go with her,\" said Mr. George.     CHAPTER II.  CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS.   In arranging for a journey in Italy with a vetturino, there are three separate classes of expenditure to be provided for. First, the carriage and horses; secondly, the board at the hotels by the way; and thirdly, the _buono manos_.  As to the carriage and horses, the question, in the case of Mr. George's party, was soon settled. Vittorio said that his regular price was three napoleons a day for a full party. This is about twelve dollars, and includes the keeping of the horses, and all the tolls, tariffs, and way expenses of every kind. Mr. George had ascertained that this was about the usual price, and he did not ask Vittorio to take any less.  For the board of the party by the way, Vittorio said that they could themselves call for what they wanted at the hotels, and pay their own bills, or _he_ would provide for them all the way, on their paying him a certain sum per day for each person.
