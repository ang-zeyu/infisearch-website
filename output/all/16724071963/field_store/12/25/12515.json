So probability changed. The explosion of that bomb in my truck became the most unlikely of all possible things. In fact, it became impossible. So some electric connection went bad, and it didn't go off. Again, when Jacaro intended to plant a time fire-bomb to set the plant on fire--why--his eyelids must have twitched but he didn't give up the intention. So the psi unit naturally made the burning of the plant impossible. For it to be impossible, the fire-bomb had to go off where it would do next to no harm. Jacaro lost his pants.\"  He stopped. Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald swallowed carefully.  \"I don't question it,\" he said dizzily, \"even if I don't believe it. Will you now tell me that what just happened was a psi something keepin' violent things from happening?\"  \"That's it,\" agreed Brink. \"The psi unit made the dryer-door fly off and knock a pistol out of a man's hand. If they'd dropped the idea of violence, that would have ended the matter. They didn't.\"  \"I accept it,\" said Fitzgerald. He gulped. \"Because I saw it. A court wouldn't believe it, though, Mr. Brink!\"  \"Well?\"  \"I've been tryin' for months,\" said Fitzgerald in sudden desperation, \"to find a way to stop what Big Jake's doin'. But he's tricky. He's organized. He's got smart lawyers. Mr. Brink, if the cops could use what you've got--\" Then he stopped. \"It'd never be authorized,\" he said bitterly. \"They'd never let a cop try it.\"  \"No,\" agreed Brink. \"Until it's believed in it can only be used privately, for private purposes. Like I've used it. Or Hm-m-m. Do you fish, or bowl, or play golf, sergeant? I could give you a psi unit that'd help you quite a bit in such a private purpose.\"  Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald shook his head.  \"Dry-fly fishin's my specialty,\" he said bitterly, \"but no thank you! When I'm pittin' myself against a trout, it's my private purpose to be a better fisherman than he's a fish. Usin' what you've got would be like dynamitin' a stream. No sport in that! No! But this Big Jake, he doesn't act sporting with the public. I'd give a lot to stop him.\"  \"You'd get no credit for it,\" said Brink. \"No credit at all.\"  \"I'd get the job done!\" said Fitzgerald indignantly. \"A man likes credit, but he likes a lot better to get a good job done!\"  Brink grinned suddenly.  \"Good man!\" he said approvingly. \"I'll buy your idea, sergeant. If you'll play fair with a trout, you'll play fair with a crook, and an Irishman, anyhow, has a sort of inheritance--I'll give you what help I can, and you'll do things your grandfather would swear was the work of the Little People. And for a first lesson--\"  \"What?\"  \"Big Jake discourages me,\" said Brink. \"So I'll call him up and say I'm coming to see him. I'll say if he wants this business I'll sell it to him at a fair price. But I'll say otherwise I'll tell the newspapers about his threats and the four of his hoods in the hospital and the two others on the way there. Want to come along?\"  Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald reached his hand to where his service revolver reposed in its holster. Then he drew it away.  \"He's a very violent man,\" he said hopefully. \"I wouldn't wonder he tried to get pretty rough--him and the characters he has on his payroll. If they have to be stopped from bein' violent by--what is it? Psi units? Sure I'll come along! It'd ought to be most edifyin' to watch!\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a clanging outside. Brink and Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald delayed while the two unnerved, helpless, and formerly immaculate gunmen were loaded into the paddy-wagon and carried away--to the hospital that already held four of their ilk. Then Brink called Big Jake on the telephone.  Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald listened with increasing appreciation as Brink made his proposition and explained matter-of-factly what had happened to Big Jake's minions who should have wrecked the Elite Cleaners and Dyers. When Brink hung up, Fitzgerald had a look of zestful anticipation on his face.  \"He said to come right over,\" said Brink. \"But he was grinding his teeth.\"  \"Ah-h-h!\" said Fitzgerald pleasurably. \"I'm thinkin' of the cab-drivers an' truck drivers that've been beat up. I'm thinkin' of property smashed and honest people scared.... Do you know, I'm terrible afraid Big Jake's too much in the habit of violence to stop, even if his eyelids twitch? It's deplorable! But on a strictly personal basis I think I'll enjoy seein' Big Jake an' his hoods discouraged by ... what is it Psi units? Yes!\"  And he did. Big Jake's eyelids undoubtedly did twitch while he was preparing a reception for Brink and Detective Sergeant Fitzgerald. But he did not heed the warning. He did not even think of the legal aspect of violent things attempted against his visitors. So he tried violence--he and his associates. They started out with fists and clubs, regardless of discretion. They tried to beat up Brink and Fitzgerald. From that they went on to sawed-off shotguns. Their efforts were still unsuccessful. Then they went to extremes.  Fitzgerald wore an expression of pious joy as Big Jake Connors and his aides, obstinately attempting violent actions, were prevented by psi units.  When it was all over, the ambulance had to make two trips."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24150"],["title","Disturbing Sun (#0)"],["body","SUN                             By PHILIP LATHAM                           Illustrated by Freas  [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from Astounding Science Fiction May 1959. Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]          _This, be it understood, is fiction--nothing but fiction--and not,      under any circumstances, to be considered as having any truth      whatever to it. It's obviously utterly impossible ... isn't it?_   _An interview with Dr. I. M. Niemand, Director of the Psychophysical Institute of Solar and Terrestrial Relations, Camarillo, California._  _In the closing days of December, 1957, at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in New York, Dr. Niemand delivered a paper entitled simply, \"On the Nature of the Solar S-Regions.\" Owing to its unassuming title the startling implications contained in the paper were completely overlooked by the press. These implications are discussed here in an exclusive interview with Dr. Niemand by Philip Latham._  LATHAM. Dr. Niemand, what would you say is your main job?  NIEMAND. I suppose you might say my main job today is to find out all I can between activity on the Sun and various forms of activity on the Earth.  LATHAM. What do you mean by activity on the Sun?  NIEMAND. Well, a sunspot is a form of solar activity.  LATHAM. Just what is a sunspot?  NIEMAND. I'm afraid I can't say just what a sunspot is. I can only describe it. A sunspot is a region on the Sun that is cooler than its surroundings. That's why it looks dark. It isn't so hot. Therefore not so bright.  LATHAM. Isn't it true that the number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of eleven years?  NIEMAND. The number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of _about_ eleven years. That word _about_ makes quite a difference.  LATHAM. In what way?  NIEMAND. It means you can only approximately predict the future course of sunspot activity. Sunspots are mighty treacherous things.  LATHAM. Haven't there been a great many correlations announced between sunspots and various effects on the Earth?  NIEMAND. Scores of them.  LATHAM. What is your opinion of these correlations?  NIEMAND. Pure bosh in most cases.  LATHAM. But some are valid?  NIEMAND. A few. There is unquestionably a correlation between sunspots and disturbances of the Earth's magnetic field ... radio fade-outs ... auroras ... things like that.  LATHAM. Now, Dr. Niemand, I understand that you have been investigating solar and terrestrial relationships along rather unorthodox lines.  NIEMAND. Yes, I suppose some people would say so.  LATHAM. You have broken new ground?  NIEMAND. That's true.  LATHAM. In what way have your investigations differed from those of others?  NIEMAND. I think our biggest advance was the discovery that sunspots themselves are not the direct cause of the disturbances we have been studying on the Earth. It's something like the eruptions in rubeola. Attention is concentrated on the bright red papules because they're such a conspicuous symptom of the disease. Whereas the real cause is an invisible filterable virus. In the solar case it turned out to be these S-Regions.  LATHAM. Why S-Regions?  NIEMAND. We had to call them something. Named after the Sun, I suppose.  LATHAM. You say an S-Region is invisible?  NIEMAND. It is quite invisible to the eye but readily detected by suitable instrumental methods. It is extremely doubtful, however, if the radiation we detect is the actual cause of the disturbing effects observed.  LATHAM. Just what are these effects?  NIEMAND. Well, they're common enough, goodness knows. As old as the world, in fact. Yet strangely enough it's hard to describe them in exact terms.  LATHAM. Can you give us a general idea?  NIEMAND. I'll try. Let's see ... remember that speech from \"Julius Caesar\" where Cassius is bewailing the evil times that beset ancient Rome? I believe it went like this: \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings.\"  LATHAM. I'm afraid I don't see--  NIEMAND. Well, Shakespeare would have been nearer the truth if he had put it the other way around. \"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in ourselves but in our stars\" or better \"in the Sun.\"         *       *       *       *       *  LATHAM. In the Sun?  NIEMAND. That's right, in the Sun. I suppose the oldest problem in the world is the origin of human evil. Philosophers have wrestled with it ever since the days of Job. And like Job they have usually given up in despair, convinced that the origin of evil is too deep for the human mind to solve. Generally they have concluded that man is inherently wicked and sinful and that is the end of it. Now for the first time science has thrown new light on this subject.  LATHAM. How is that?  NIEMAND. Consider the record of history. There are occasional periods when conditions are fairly calm and peaceful. Art and industry flourished. Man at last seemed to be making progress toward some higher goal. Then suddenly--_for no detectable reason_--conditions are reversed. Wars rage. People go mad. The world is plunged into an orgy of bloodshed and misery.  LATHAM. But weren't there reasons?  NIEMAND. What reasons?  LATHAM. Well, disputes over boundaries ... economic rivalry ... border incidents....  NIEMAND. Nonsense. Men always make some flimsy excuse for going to war. The truth of the matter is that men go to war because they want to go to war. They can't help themselves. They are impelled by forces over which they have no control. By forces outside of themselves.  LATHAM. Those are broad, sweeping statements. Can't you be more specific?  NIEMAND. Perhaps I'd better go back to the beginning. Let me see.... It all started back in March, 1955, when I started getting patients suffering from a complex of symptoms, such as profound mental depression, anxiety, insomnia, alternating with fits of violent rage and resentment against life and the world in general. These people were deeply disturbed. No doubt about that. Yet they were not psychotic and hardly more than mildly neurotic. Now every doctor gets a good many patients of this type. Such a syndrome is characteristic of menopausal women and some men during the climacteric, but these people failed to fit into this picture. They were married and single persons of both sexes and of all ages. They came from all walks of life. The onset of their attack was invariably sudden and with scarcely any warning. They would be going about their work feeling perfectly all right. Then in a minute the whole world was like some scene from a nightmare. A week or ten days later the attack would cease as mysteriously as it had come and they would be their old self again.  LATHAM. Aren't such attacks characteristic of the stress and strain of modern life?  NIEMAND. I'm afraid that old stress-and-strain theory has been badly overworked. Been hearing about it ever since I was a pre-med student at UCLA. Even as a boy I can remember my grandfather deploring the stress and strain of modern life when he was a country doctor practicing in Indiana. In my opinion one of the most valuable contributions anthropologists have made in recent years is the discovery that primitive man is afflicted with essentially the same neurotic conditions as those of us who live a so-called civilized life. They have found savages displaying every symptom of a nervous breakdown among the mountain tribes of the Elgonyi and the Aruntas of Australia. No, Mr. Latham, it's time the stress-and-strain theory was relegated to the junk pile along with demoniac possession and blood letting.  LATHAM. You must have done something for your patients--  NIEMAND. A doctor must always do something for the patients who come to his office seeking help. First I gave them a thorough physical examination. I turned up some minor ailments--a slight heart murmur or a trace of albumin in the urine--but nothing of any significance. On the whole they were a remarkably healthy bunch of individuals, much more so than an average sample of the population. Then I made a searching inquiry into their personal life. Here again I drew a blank. They had no particular financial worries. Their sex life was generally satisfactory. There was no history of mental illness in the family. In fact, the only thing that seemed to be the matter with them was that there were times when they felt like hell.  LATHAM. I suppose you tried tranquilizers?  NIEMAND. Oh, yes. In a few cases in which I tried tranquilizing pills of the meprobamate type there was some slight improvement. I want to emphasize, however, that I do not believe in prescribing shotgun remedies for a patient. To my way of thinking it is a lazy slipshod way of carrying on the practice of medicine. The only thing for which I do give myself credit was that I asked my patients to keep a detailed record of their symptoms taking special care to note the time of exacerbation--increase in the severity of the symptoms--as accurately as possible.  LATHAM. And this gave you a clue?  NIEMAND. It was the beginning. In most instances patients reported the attack struck with almost the impact of a physical blow. The prodromal symptoms were usually slight ... a sudden feeling of uneasiness and guilt ... hot and cold flashes ... dizziness ... double vision. Then this ghastly sense of depression coupled with a blind insensate rage at life. One man said he felt as if the world were closing in on him. Another that he felt the people around him were plotting his destruction. One housewife made her husband lock her in her room for fear she would injure the children. I pored over these case histories for a long time getting absolutely nowhere. Then finally a pattern began to emerge.         *       *       *       *       *  LATHAM. What sort of pattern?  NIEMAND. The first thing that struck me was that the attacks all occurred during the daytime,"]]]
