He was about twenty-five years of age, irreproachable in his life and conduct, and a holy madman.  He was equipped in leather from head to foot, and travelled from one village to another, exclaiming against war and the clergy.  Had his invectives been levelled against the soldiery only he would have been safe enough, but he inveighed against ecclesiastics.  Fox was seized at Derby, and being carried before a justice of peace, he did not once offer to pull off his leathern hat, upon which an officer gave him a great box of the ear, and cried to him, \"Don't you know you are to appear uncovered before his worship?\"  Fox presented his other cheek to the officer, and begged him to give him another box for God's sake.  The justice would have had him sworn before he asked him any questions.  \"Know, friend,\" says Fox to him, \"that I never swear.\"  The justice, observing he \"thee'd\" and \"thou'd\" him, sent him to the House of Correction, in Derby, with orders that he should be whipped there.  Fox praised the Lord all the way he went to the House of Correction, where the justice's order was executed with the utmost severity.  The men who whipped this enthusiast were greatly surprised to hear him beseech them to give him a few more lashes for the good of his soul.  There was no need of entreating these people; the lashes were repeated, for which Fox thanked them very cordially, and began to preach. At first the spectators fell a-laughing, but they afterwards listened to him; and as enthusiasm is an epidemical distemper, many were persuaded, and those who scourged him became his first disciples.  Being set at liberty, he ran up and down the country with a dozen proselytes at his heels, still declaiming against the clergy, and was whipped from time to time.  Being one day set in the pillory, he harangued the crowd in so strong and moving a manner, that fifty of the auditors became his converts, and he won the rest so much in his favour that, his head being freed tumultuously from the hole where it was fastened, the populace went and searched for the Church of England clergyman who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing him to this punishment, and set him on the same pillory where Fox had stood.  Fox was bold enough to convert some of Oliver Cromwell's soldiers, who thereupon quitted the service and refused to take the oaths.  Oliver, having as great a contempt for a sect which would not allow its members to fight, as Sixtus Quintus had for another sect, _Dove non si chiamava_, began to persecute these new converts.  The prisons were crowded with them, but persecution seldom has any other effect than to increase the number of proselytes.  These came, therefore, from their confinement more strongly confirmed in the principles they had imbibed, and followed by their gaolers, whom they had brought over to their belief.  But the circumstances which contributed chiefly to the spreading of this sect were as follows:--Fox thought himself inspired, and consequently was of opinion that he must speak in a manner different from the rest of mankind.  He thereupon began to writhe his body, to screw up his face, to hold in his breath, and to exhale it in a forcible manner, insomuch that the priestess of the Pythian god at Delphos could not have acted her part to better advantage.  Inspiration soon became so habitual to him that he could scarce deliver himself in any other manner.  This was the first gift he communicated to his disciples.  These aped very sincerely their master's several grimaces, and shook in every limb the instant the fit of inspiration came upon them, whence they were called Quakers.  The vulgar attempted to mimic them; they trembled, they spake through the nose, they quaked and fancied themselves inspired by the Holy Ghost.  The only thing now wanting was a few miracles, and accordingly they wrought some.  Fox, this modern patriarch, spoke thus to a justice of peace before a large assembly of people: \"Friend, take care what thou dost; God will soon punish thee for persecuting His saints.\"  This magistrate, being one who besotted himself every day with bad beer and brandy, died of an apoplexy two days after, the moment he had signed a _mittimus_ for imprisoning some Quakers.  The sudden death with which this justice was seized was not ascribed to his intemperance, but was universally looked upon as the effect of the holy man's predictions; so that this accident made more converts to Quakerism than a thousand sermons and as many shaking fits could have done.  Oliver, finding them increase daily, was desirous of bringing them over to his party, and for that purpose attempted to bribe them by money.  However, they were incorruptible, which made him one day declare that this religion was the only one he had ever met with that had resisted the charms of gold.  The Quakers were several times persecuted under Charles II.; not upon a religious account, but for refusing to pay the tithes, for \"theeing\" and \"thouing\" the magistrates, and for refusing to take the oaths enacted by the laws.  At last Robert Barclay, a native of Scotland, presented to the King, in 1675, his \"Apology for the Quakers,\" a work as well drawn up as the subject could possibly admit.  The dedication to Charles II. is not filled with mean, flattering encomiums, but abounds with bold touches in favour of truth and with the wisest counsels.  \"Thou hast tasted,\" says he to the King at the close of his epistle dedicatory, \"of prosperity and adversity; thou knowest what it is to be banished thy native country; to be overruled as well as to rule and sit upon the throne; and, being oppressed, thou hast reason to know how hateful the Oppressor is both to God and man.  If, after all these warnings and advertisements, thou dost not turn unto the Lord with all thy heart, but forget Him who remembered thee in thy distress, and give up thyself to follow lust and vanity, surely great will be thy condemnation.  \"Against which snare, as well as the temptation of those that may or do feed thee and prompt thee to evil, the most excellent and prevalent remedy will be, to apply thyself to that light of Christ which shineth in thy conscience, which neither can nor will flatter thee nor suffer thee to be at ease in thy sins, but doth and will deal plainly and faithfully with thee, as those that are followers thereof have plainly done.--Thy faithful friend and subject, Robert Barclay.\"  A more surprising circumstance is, that this epistle, written by a private man of no figure, was so happy in its effects, as to put a stop to the persecution.    LETTER IV.--ON THE QUAKERS   About this time arose the illustrious William Penn, who established the power of the Quakers in America, and would have made them appear venerable in the eyes of the Europeans, were it possible for mankind to respect virtue when revealed in a ridiculous light.  He was the only son of Vice-Admiral Penn, favourite of the Duke of York, afterwards King James II.  William Penn, at twenty years of age, happening to meet with a Quaker in Cork, whom he had known at Oxford, this man made a proselyte of him; and William being a sprightly youth, and naturally eloquent, having a winning aspect, and a very engaging carriage, he soon gained over some of his intimates.  He carried matters so far, that he formed by insensible degrees a society of young Quakers, who met at his house; so that he was at the head of a sect when a little above twenty.  Being returned, after his leaving Cork, to the Vice-Admiral his father, instead of falling upon his knees to ask his blessing, he went up to him with his hat on, and said, \"Friend, I am very glad to see thee in good health.\"  The Vice-Admiral imagined his son to be crazy, but soon finding he was turned Quaker, he employed all the methods that prudence could suggest to engage him to behave and act like other people.  The youth made no other answer to his father, than by exhorting him to turn Quaker also.  At last his father confined himself to this single request, viz., \"that he should wait upon the King and the Duke of York with his hat under his arm, and should not 'thee' and 'thou' them.\"  William answered, \"that he could not do these things, for conscience' sake,\" which exasperated his father to such a degree, that he turned him out of doors. Young Pen gave God thanks for permitting him to suffer so early in His cause, after which he went into the city, where he held forth, and made a great number of converts.  The Church of England clergy found their congregations dwindle away daily; and Penn being young, handsome, and of a graceful stature, the court as well as the city ladies flocked very devoutly to his meeting. The patriarch, George Fox, hearing of his great reputation, came to London (though the journey was very long) purely to see and converse with him.  Both resolved to go upon missions into foreign countries, and accordingly they embarked for Holland, after having left labourers sufficient to take care of the London vineyard.  Their labours were crowned with success in Amsterdam, but a circumstance which reflected the greatest honour on them, and at the same time put their humility to the greatest trial, was the reception they met with from Elizabeth, the Princess Palatine, aunt to George I. of Great Britain, a lady conspicuous for her genius and knowledge, and to whom Descartes had dedicated his Philosophical Romance.  She was then retired to the Hague, where she received these Friends, for so the Quakers were at that time called in Holland.  This princess had several conferences with them in her palace, and she at last entertained so favourable an opinion of Quakerism, that they confessed she was not far from the kingdom of heaven.  The Friends sowed likewise the good seed in Germany, but reaped very little fruit; for the mode of \"theeing\" and \"thouing\" was not approved of in a country "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2445"],["title","Letters on England (#3)"],["body","a man is perpetually obliged to employ the titles of \"highness\" and \"excellency.\"  William Penn returned soon to England upon hearing of his father's sickness, in order to see him before he died.  The Vice-Admiral was reconciled to his son, and though of a different persuasion, embraced him tenderly.  William made a fruitless exhortation to his father not to receive the sacrament, but to die a Quaker, and the good old man entreated his son William to wear buttons on his sleeves, and a crape hatband in his beaver, but all to no purpose.  William Penn inherited very large possessions, part of which consisted in Crown debts due to the Vice-Admiral for sums he had advanced for the sea service.  No moneys were at that time more insecure than those owing from the king.  Penn was obliged to go more than once, and \"thee\" and \"thou\" King Charles and his Ministers, in order to recover the debt; and at last, instead of specie, the Government invested him with the right and sovereignty of a province of America, to the south of Maryland.  Thus was a Quaker raised to sovereign power.  Penn set sail for his new dominions with two ships freighted with Quakers, who followed his fortune.  The country was then called Pennsylvania from William Penn, who there founded Philadelphia, now the most flourishing city in that country.  The first step he took was to enter into an alliance with his American neighbours, and this is the only treaty between those people and the Christians that was not ratified by an oath, and was never infringed.  The new sovereign was at the same time the legislator of Pennsylvania, and enacted very wise and prudent laws, none of which have ever been changed since his time.  The first is, to injure no person upon a religious account, and to consider as brethren all those who believe in one God.  He had no sooner settled his government, but several American merchants came and peopled this colony.  The natives of the country, instead of flying into the woods, cultivated by insensible degrees a friendship with the peaceable Quakers.  They loved these foreigners as much as they detested the other Christians who had conquered and laid waste America. In a little time a great number of these savages (falsely so called), charmed with the mild and gentle disposition of their neighbours, came in crowds to William Penn, and besought him to admit them into the number of his vassals.  It was very rare and uncommon for a sovereign to be \"thee'd\" and \"thou'd\" by the meanest of his subjects, who never took their hats off when they came into his presence; and as singular for a Government to be without one priest in it, and for a people to be without arms, either offensive or defensive; for a body of citizens to be absolutely undistinguished but by the public employments, and for neighbours not to entertain the least jealousy one against the other.  William Penn might glory in having brought down upon earth the so much boasted golden age, which in all probability never existed but in Pennsylvania.  He returned to England to settle some affairs relating to his new dominions.  After the death of King Charles II., King James, who had loved the father, indulged the same affection to the son, and no longer considered him as an obscure sectary, but as a very great man.  The king's politics on this occasion agreed with his inclinations.  He was desirous of pleasing the Quakers by annulling the laws made against Nonconformists, in order to have an opportunity, by this universal toleration, of establishing the Romish religion.  All the sectarists in England saw the snare that was laid for them, but did not give into it; they never failing to unite when the Romish religion, their common enemy, is to be opposed.  But Penn did not think himself bound in any manner to renounce his principles, merely to favour Protestants to whom he was odious, in opposition to a king who loved him.  He had established a universal toleration with regard to conscience in America, and would not have it thought that he intended to destroy it in Europe, for which reason he adhered so inviolably to King James, that a report prevailed universally of his being a Jesuit.  This calumny affected him very strongly, and he was obliged to justify himself in print.  However, the unfortunate King James II., in whom, as in most princes of the Stuart family, grandeur and weakness were equally blended, and who, like them, as much overdid some things as he was short in others, lost his kingdom in a manner that is hardly to be accounted for.  All the English sectarists accepted from William III, and his Parliament the toleration and indulgence which they had refused when offered by King James.  It was then the Quakers began to enjoy, by virtue of the laws, the several privileges they possess at this time.  Penn having at last seen Quakerism firmly established in his native country, went back to Pennsylvania.  His own people and the Americans received him with tears of joy, as though he had been a father who was returned to visit his children.  All the laws had been religiously observed in his absence, a circumstance in which no legislator had ever been happy but himself. After having resided some years in Pennsylvania he left it, but with great reluctance, in order to return to England, there to solicit some matters in favour of the commerce of Pennsylvania.  But he never saw it again, he dying in Ruscombe, in Berkshire, in 1718.  I am not able to guess what fate Quakerism may have in America, but I perceive it dwindles away daily in England.  In all countries where liberty of conscience is allowed, the established religion will at last swallow up all the rest.  Quakers are disqualified from being members of Parliament; nor can they enjoy any post or preferment, because an oath must always be taken on these occasions, and they never swear.  They are therefore reduced to the necessity of subsisting upon traffic.  Their children, whom the industry of their parents has enriched, are desirous of enjoying honours, of wearing buttons and ruffles; and quite ashamed of being called Quakers they become converts to the Church of England, merely to be in the fashion.    LETTER V.--ON THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND   England is properly the country of sectarists.  _Multae sunt mansiones in domo patris mei_ (in my Father's house are many mansions).  An Englishman, as one to whom liberty is natural, may go to heaven his own way.  Nevertheless, though every one is permitted to serve God in whatever mode or fashion he thinks proper, yet their true religion, that in which a man makes his fortune, is the sect of Episcopalians or Churchmen, called the Church of England, or simply the Church, by way of eminence.  No person can possess an employment either in England or Ireland unless he be ranked among the faithful, that is, professes himself a member of the Church of England.  This reason (which carries mathematical evidence with it) has converted such numbers of Dissenters of all persuasions, that not a twentieth part of the nation is out of the pale of the Established Church.  The English clergy have retained a great number of the Romish ceremonies, and especially that of receiving, with a most scrupulous attention, their tithes.  They also have the pious ambition to aim at superiority.  Moreover, they inspire very religiously their flock with a holy zeal against Dissenters of all denominations.  This zeal was pretty violent under the Tories in the four last years of Queen Anne; but was productive of no greater mischief than the breaking the windows of some meeting-houses and the demolishing of a few of them.  For religious rage ceased in England with the civil wars, and was no more under Queen Anne than the hollow noise of a sea whose billows still heaved, though so long after the storm when the Whigs and Tories laid waste their native country, in the same manner as the Guelphs and Ghibelins formerly did theirs.  It was absolutely necessary for both parties to call in religion on this occasion; the Tories declared for Episcopacy, and the Whigs, as some imagined, were for abolishing it; however, after these had got the upper hand, they contented themselves with only abridging it.  At the time when the Earl of Oxford and the Lord Bolingbroke used to drink healths to the Tories, the Church of England considered those noblemen as the defenders of its holy privileges.  The lower House of Convocation (a kind of House of Commons) composed wholly of the clergy, was in some credit at that time; at least the members of it had the liberty to meet, to dispute on ecclesiastical matters, to sentence impious books from time to time to the flames, that is, books written against themselves.  The Ministry which is now composed of Whigs does not so much as allow those gentlemen to assemble, so that they are at this time reduced (in the obscurity of their respective parishes) to the melancholy occupation of praying for the prosperity of the Government whose tranquillity they would willingly disturb.  With regard to the bishops, who are twenty-six in all, they still have seats in the House of Lords in spite of the Whigs, because the ancient abuse of considering them as barons subsists to this day.  There is a clause, however, in the oath which the Government requires from these gentlemen, that puts their Christian patience to a very great trial, viz., that they shall be of the Church of England as by law established.  There are few bishops, deans, or other dignitaries, but imagine they are so _jure divino_; it is consequently a great mortification to them to be obliged to confess that they owe their dignity to a pitiful law enacted by a set of profane laymen.  A learned monk (Father Courayer) wrote a book lately to prove the validity and succession of English ordinations.  This book was forbid in France, but do you believe that the English Ministry were pleased with it?  Far from it.  Those wicked Whigs don't"]]]
