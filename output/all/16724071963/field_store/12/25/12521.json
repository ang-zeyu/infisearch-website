John Cotton supplied them with       \"Spiritual Milk for Boston Babes in Either England: Drawn out of      the Breasts of both Testaments for their Souls Nourishment. But      may be of like Use to Any Children.\"  Another book was published in many editions and sold in large numbers, and much extolled by contemporary ministers. It was entitled:       \"A Token for Children. Being the exact account of the Conversion &      Holy & Exemplary Lives of several Young Children by James Janeway.\"  To it was added by Cotton Mather:       \"Some examples of Children in whom the fear of God was remarkably      Budding before they died; in several parts of New England.\"  Cotton Mather also wrote: \"Good Lessons for Children, in Verse.\" Other books were, \"A Looking Glasse for Children,\" \"The life of Elizabeth Butcher, in the Early Piety series;\" \"The life of Mary Paddock, who died at the age of nine;\" \"The Childs new Plaything\" (which was a primer); \"Divine Songs in Easy Language;\" and \"Praise out of the Mouth of Babes;\" \"A Particular Account of some Extraordinary Pious Motions and devout Exercises observed of late in many Children in Siberia.\" Also accounts of pious motions of children in Silesia and of Jewish children in Berlin. One oasis appeared in the desert waste--after the first quarter of the eighteenth century Puritan children had Mother Goose.  By 1787, in Isaiah Thomas' list of \"books Suitable for Children of all ages,\" we find less serious books. \"Tom Jones Abridged,\" \"Peregrine Pickle Abridged,\" \"Vice in its Proper Shape,\" \"The Sugar Plumb,\" \"Bag of Nuts Ready Crack'd,\" \"Jacky Dandy,\" \"History of Billy and Polly Friendly.\" Among the \"Chapman's Books for the Edification and Amusement of young Men and Women who are not able to Purchase those of a Higher Price\" are, \"The Amours and Adventures of Two English Gentlemen in Italy,\" \"Fifteen Comforts of Matrimony,\" \"The Lovers Secretary,\" and \"Laugh and be Fat.\" Another advertisement of about the same date contained, among the books for misses, \"The Masqued Wedding,\" \"The Elopement,\" \"The Passionate Lovers,\" \"Sketches of the History and Importance of the Fair Sex,\" \"Original Love Letters,\" and \"Six Dialogues of Young Misses Relating to Matrimony;\" thus showing that love-stories were not abhorred by the descendants of the Puritans.  In such an exceptional plantation as New England, a colony peopled not by the commonplace and average Englishmen of the day, but by men of special intelligence, and almost universally of good education, it was inevitable that early and profound attention should be paid to the establishment of schools. Cotton Mather said in 1685, in his sermon before the Governor and his Council, \"the Youth in this country are verie Sharp and early Ripe in their Capacities.\" So quickly had New England air developed the typical New England traits. And the early schoolmasters, too, may be thanked for their scholars' early ripeness and sharpness.  At an early age both girls and boys were sent to dame-schools, where, if girls were not taught much book-learning, they were carefully instructed in all housewifely arts. They learned to cook; and to spin and weave and knit, not only for home wear but for the shops; even little children could spin coarse tow string and knit coarse socks for shop-keepers. Fine knitting was well paid for, and was a matter of much pride to the knitter, and many curious and elaborate stitches were known; the herring-bone and the fox- and geese-patterns being prime favorites. Initials were knit into mittens and stockings; one clever young miss of Shelburne, N. H., could knit the alphabet and a verse of poetry into a single pair of mittens. Fine embroidery was to New England women and girls a delight. The Indians at an early day called the English women \"lazie Squaes\" when they saw the latter embroidering coifs instead of digging in the fields. Mr. Brownell, the Boston schoolmaster in 1716, taught \"Young Gentle Women and Children all sorts of Fine Works as Feather works, Filigree, and Painting on Glass, Embroidering a new Way, Turkey-work for Handkerchiefs two new Ways, fine new Fashion purses, flourishing and plain Work.\" We find a Newport dame teaching \"Sewing, Marking, Queen Stitch and Knitting,\" and a Boston shopkeeper taking children and young ladies to board and be taught \"Dresden and Embroidery on gauze, Tent Stitch and all sorts of Colour'd Work.\" Crewels, embroidery, silks, and chenilles appear frequently in early newspapers. Many of the fruits of these careful lessons of colonial childhood remain to us; quaint samplers, bed hangings, petticoats and pockets, and frail lace veils and scarfs. Miss Susan Hayes Ward has resuscitated from these old embroideries a curious stitch used to great effect on many of them, and employed also on ancient Persian embroideries, and she points out that the designs are Persian also. This stitch was not known in the modern English needlework schools; but just as good old Elizabethan words and phrases are still used in New England, though obsolete in England, so this curious old stitch has lived in the colony when lost in the mother country; or, it may be possible, since it is found so frequently in the vicinity of Plymouth, that the Pilgrims obtained both stitch and designs in Holland, whose greater commerce with the Orient may have supplied to deft English fingers the Persian pattern.  Other accomplishments were taught to girls; \"cutting of Escutcheons\" and paper flowers--\"Papyrotamia\" it was ambitiously called--and painting on velvet; and quilt-piecing in a hundred different and difficult designs. They also learned to make bone lace with pillow and bobbins.  The boys were thrust at once into that iron-handed but wholly wise grasp--the Latin Grammar. The minds trained in earliest youth in that study, as it was then taught, have made their deep and noble impress on this nation. The study of mathematics was, until well into this century, a hopeless maze to many youthful minds. Doubtless the Puritans learned multiplication tables and may have found them, as did Marjorie Fleming, \"a horrible and wretched plaege,\" though no pious little New Englanders would have dared to say as she did, \"You cant conceive it the most Devilish thing is 8 times 8 and 7 times 7, it is what nature itself can't endure.\"  Great attention was paid to penmanship. Spelling was nought if the \"wrighting\" were only fair and flowing. I have never read any criticism of teachers by either parents or town officers save on the one question of writing. How deeply children were versed or grounded in the knowledge of the proper use of \"Simme colings nots of interiogations peorids and commoes,\" I do not know. A boundless freedom apparently was given, as was also in orthography--if we judge from the letters of the times, where \"horrid false spells,\" as Cotton Mather called them, abound.  It is natural to dwell on the religious teaching of Puritan children, because so much of their education had a religious element in it. They must have felt, like Tony Lumpkin, \"tired of having good dinged into 'em.\" Their primers taught religious rhymes; they read from the Bible, the Catechism, the Psalm Book, and that lurid rhymed horror \"The Day of Doom;\" they parsed, too, from these universal books. How did they parse these lines from the Bay Psalm Book?      \"And sayd He would not them waste; had not         Moses stood (whom he chose)     'fore him i' th' breach; to turn his wrath         lest that he should waste those.\"  Their \"horn books\"--                \"books of stature small     Which with pellucid horn secured are     To save from fingers wet the letters fair,\"  those framed and behandled sheets of semi-transparent horn, which were worn hanging at the side and were studied, as late certainly as the year 1715 by children of the Pilgrims, also managed to instil with the alphabet some religious words or principles. Usually the Lord's Prayer formed part of the printed text. Though horn-books are referred to in Sewall's diary and in the letters of Wait Still Winthrop, and appear on stationers' and booksellers' lists at the beginning of the eighteenth century, I do not know of the preservation of a single specimen to our own day.  The schoolhouses were simple dwellings, often tumbling down and out of repair. The Roxbury teacher wrote in 1681:       \"Of inconveniences [in the schoolhouse] I shall mention no other      but the confused and shattered and nastie posture that it is in,      not fitting for to reside in, the glass broke, and thereupon very      raw and cold; the floor very much broken and torn up to kindle      fires, the hearth spoiled, the seats some burned and others out of      kilter, that one had well-nigh as goods keep school in a hog stie      as in it.\"  This schoolhouse had been built and furnished with some care in 1652, as this entry in the town records shows:       \"The feoffes agreed with Daniel Welde that he provide convenient      benches with forms, with tables for the scholars, and a conveniente      seate for the scholmaster, a Deske to put the Dictionary on and      shelves to lay up bookes.\"  The schoolmaster \"promised and engaged to use his best endeavour both by precept and example to instruct in all Scholasticall morall and Theologicall discipline the children so far as they be capable, all A. B. C. Darians excepted.\" He was paid in corn, barley or peas, the value of Â£25 per annum, and each child, through his parents or guardians, supplied half a cord of wood for the schoolhouse fire. If this load of wood were not promptly furnished the child suffered, for the master did not allow him the benefit of the fire; that is, to go near enough the fireplace to feel the warmth.  The children of wise parents like Cotton Mather, were also taught \"opificial and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],["title","Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#5)"],["body","sciences,\" such as the mystery of medicine--a mystery indeed in colonial times.  Puritan schoolmasters believed, as did Puritan parents, that sparing the rod spoiled the child, and great latitude was given in punishment; the rod and ferule were fiercely and frequently plied \"with lamming and with whipping, and such benefits of nature\" as in English schools of the same date. When young men were publicly whipped in colleges, children were sure to be well trained in smaller schools. Every gradation of chastisement was known and every instrument from      \"A beesome of byrche for babes verye fit      To a long lastinge lybbet for lubbers as meete,\"  from the \"thimell-pie\" of the dame's school--a smart tapping on the head with a heavy thimble--to belaboring with a heavy walnut stick or oaken ruler. Master Lovell, that tigerish Boston teacher, whipped the culprit with birch rods and forced another scholar to hold the sufferer on his back. Other schoolmasters whipped on the soles of the feet, and one teacher roared out, \"Oh the Caitiffs! it is good for them.\" Not only were children whipped, but many ingenious instruments of torture were invented. One instructor made his scholars sit on a \"bark seat turned upside down with his thumb on the knot of a floor.\" Another master of the inquisition invented a unipod--a stool with one leg--sometimes placed in the middle of the seat, sometimes on the edge, on which the unfortunate scholar tiresomely balanced. Others sent out the suffering pupil to cut a branch of a tree, and, making a split in the large end of the branch, sprung it on the culprit's nose, and he stood painfully pinched, an object of ridicule with his spreading branch of leaves. One cruel master invented an instrument of torture which he called a flapper. It was a heavy piece of leather six inches in diameter with a hole in the middle, and was fastened at the edge to a pliable handle. The blistering pain inflicted by this brutal instrument can well be imagined. At another school, whipping of unlucky wights was done \"upon a peaked block with a tattling stick;\" and this expression of colonial severity seems to take on additional force and cruelty in our minds that we do not at all know what a tattling stick was, nor understand what was meant by a peaked block.  I often fancy I should have enjoyed living in the good old times, but I am glad I never was a child in colonial New England--to have been baptized in ice water, fed on brown bread and warm beer, to have had to learn the Assembly's Catechism and \"explain all the Quaestions with conferring Texts,\" to have been constantly threatened with fear of death and terror of God, to have been forced to commit Wigglesworth's \"Day of Doom\" to memory, and, after all, to have been whipped with a tattling stick.     II  COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE CUSTOMS   In the early days of the New England colonies no more embarrassing or hampering condition, no greater temporal ill could befall any adult Puritan than to be unmarried. What could he do, how could he live in that new land without a wife? There were no housekeepers--and he would scarcely have been allowed to have one if there were. What could a woman do in that new settlement among unbroken forests, uncultivated lands, without a husband? The colonists married early, and they married often. Widowers and widows hastened to join their fortunes and sorrows. The father and mother of Governor Winslow had been widow and widower seven and twelve weeks, respectively, when they joined their families and themselves in mutual benefit, if not in mutual love. At a later day the impatient Governor of New Hampshire married a lady but ten days widowed. Bachelors were rare indeed, and were regarded askance and with intense disfavor by the entire community, were almost in the position of suspected criminals. They were seldom permitted to live alone, or even to choose their residence, but had to find a domicile wherever and with whomsoever the Court assigned. In Hartford lone-men, as Shakespeare called them, had to pay twenty shillings a week to the town for the selfish luxury of solitary living. No colonial law seems to me more arbitrary or more comic than this order issued in the town of Eastham, Mass., in 1695, namely:       \"Every unmarried man in the township shall kill six blackbirds or      three crows while he remains single; as a penalty for not doing it,      shall not be married until he obey this order.\"  Bachelors were under the special spying and tattling supervision of the constable, the watchman, and the tithingman, who, like Pliable in Pilgrim's Progress, sat sneaking among his neighbors and reported their \"scirscumstances and conuersation.\" In those days a man gained instead of losing his freedom by marrying. \"Incurridgement\" to wedlock was given bachelors in many towns by the assignment to them upon marriage of home-lots to build upon. In Medfield there was a so-called Bachelor's Row, which had been thus assigned. In the early days of Salem \"maid lotts\" were also granted; but Endicott wrote in the town records that it was best to abandon the custom and thus \"avoid all presedents & evil events of granting lotts vnto single maidens not disposed of.\" This line he crossed out and wrote instead, \"for avoiding of absurdities.\" He kindly, but rather disappointingly, gave one maid a bushel of corn when she came to ask for a house and lot, and told her it would be a \"bad president\" for her to keep house alone. A maid had, indeed, a hard time to live in colonial days, did she persevere in her singular choice of remaining single. Perhaps the colonists \"proverb'd with the grandsire phrase,\" that women dying maids lead apes in hell. Maidens \"withering on the virgin thorn,\" in single blessedness, were hard to find. One Mistress Poole lived unmarried to great old age, and helped to found the town of Taunton under most discouraging rebuffs; and in the Plymouth church record of March 19, 1667, is a record of a death which reads thus:--       \"Mary Carpenter sister of Mrs. Alice Bradford wife of Governor      Bradford being newly entered into the 91st year of her age. She was      a godly old maid never married.\"  The state of old maidism was reached at a very early age in those early days; Higginson wrote of an \"antient maid\" of twenty-five years. John Dunton in his \"Life and Errors\" wrote eulogistically of one such ideal \"Virgin\" who attracted his special attention.       \"It is true an _old_ (or superanuated) Maid in Boston is thought      such a curse, as nothing can exceed it (and looked on as a _dismal_      spectacle) yet she by her good nature, gravity, and strict virtue      convinces all (so much as the fleering Beaus) that it is not her      necessity but her choice that keeps her a Virgin. She is now about      thirty years (the age which they call a _Thornback_) yet she never      disguises herself, and talks as little as she thinks, of Love. She      never reads any Plays or Romances, goes to no Balls or      Dancing-match (as they do who go to such Fairs) to meet with      Chapmen. Her looks, her speech, her whole behavior are so very      chaste, that but once (at Govenor's Island, where we went to be      merry at roasting a hog) going to kiss her, I thought she would      have blushed to death.       \"Our _Damsel_ knowing this, her conversation is generally amongst      the women (as there is least danger from that sex) so that I found      it no easy matter to enjoy her company, for most of her time (save      what was taken up in needle work and learning French &c.) was spent      in Religious Worship. She knew time was a dressing-room for      Eternity, and therefore reserves most of her hours for better uses      than those of the Comb, the Toilet and the Glass.       \"And as I am sure this is most agreeable to the Virgin modesty,      which should make Marriage an act rather of their obedience than      their choice. And they that think their Friends too slowpaced in      the matter give certain proof that lust is their sole motive. But      as the Damsel I have been describing would neither anticipate nor      contradict the will of her Parents, so do I assure you she is      against Forcing her own, by marrying where she cannot love; and      that is the reason she is still a Virgin.\"  Hence it may be seen that though there was not in Boston the \"glorious phalanx of old maids\" of Theodore Parker's description, yet the Boston old maid was lovely even in colonial days, though she did bear the odious name of thornback.  An English traveller, Josselyn, gives a glimpse of Boston love-making in the year 1663.       \"On the South there is a small but pleasant Common, where the      Gallants, a little before sunset, walk with their Marmalet-Madams      till the nine o'clock bell rings them home to their respective      habitations.\"  This simple and quaint picture of youthful love in the soft summer twilight, at that ever beautiful trysting-place, gives an unwonted touch of sentiment to the austere daily life of colonial New England. The omnipotent Puritan law-giver, who meddled and interfered in every detail, small and great, of the public and private life of the citizen, could not leave untouched, in fancy free, these soberly promenading Puritan sweethearts. A Boston gallant must choose well his marmalet-madam, must proceed cautiously in his love-making in the gloaming, obtaining first the formal permission of parents or guardians ere he take any step in courtship. Fines, imprisonment, or the whipping-post awaited him, did he \"inveigle the affections of any maide or maide servant\" by making love to her without proper authority. Numberless examples might be given to prove that this law was no dead letter. In 1647, in Stratford, Will Colefoxe was fined Â£5 for \"laboring to invegle the affection of Write his daughter.\" In 1672 Jonathan Coventry, of Plymouth town, was indicted for \"making a motion of marriage\" to Katharine"]]]
