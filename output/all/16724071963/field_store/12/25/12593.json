It seemed remarkably fragile, but it reached and the watchers murmured approval.  No longer beset by novelty, the men took easily to the swaying, sagging bridge. They passed over the baffled grass, the leader carrying another short ladder which he hung from the roof, stabbing its lower rungs down into the matted verdure below. The crossing was made with such insouciance the wonder was they hadnt done it at first, instead of wasting time on other expedients.  The firemen went down the vertical ladder and forced an entrance into the choked windows. Mrs Dinkman came out first, helped by two of them. She kept pinching her glasses into place with one hand and pulling her skirt modestly close with the other, activities leaving her very little to grasp the ladder with. The firemen seemed quite accustomed to this sort of irrationality, and paying no heed to the rush of words--inaudible to us on the street--bursting from her, they coaxed her expertly up onto the roof. Here she stood, statuesquely outlined against the bright sky, berating her succorers, until Mr Dinkman, rounded, bald, and calm, joined her.  At first Mrs Dinkman refused to try the bridge to the street, but after some urging which was conveyed to us by the gestures of the firemen, she ventured gingerly on the trembling ladders only to draw back quickly. One of the firemen demonstrated the ease and simplicity of the journey, but it was vain; Mrs Dinkman was carried across gallantly in traditional movie style, with Mr Dinkman and the crew following sedately behind.  \"A crime,\" Mrs Dinkman was saying when she came within earshot. \"A crime. Malicious mischief. Ought to be locked up for life.\"  \"Don't upset yourself, my dear,\" urged Mr Dinkman. \"It's very distressing, but afterall it might be worse.\"  \"'Worse'! Adam Dinkman, has misfortune completely unhinged your mind? Money thrown in the gutter--imposed on by oily rascals--our house swallowed up by this ... this unnatural stuff--and the final humiliation of being pulled out of our own home in front of a gawking crowd.\" She turned around and shouted, \"Shoo, shoo--why don't you go home?\" And then to Mr Dinkman again, \"'Worse' indeed! I'd like to know what could be worse?\"  \"Well now--\" began Mr Dinkman; but I didnt hear the rest, for I was afraid by \"rascals\" Mrs Dinkman referred, quite unjustly, to me and I thought the time opportune to remind Gootes he hadnt yet completed his assignment.  \"Right,\" he agreed, suddenly assuming the abrupt accents of an improbable Englishman, \"oh very right, old chap. Let's toddle along and see what Fu Manchu has to say for himself. First off though I shall have to phone in to Fleet Street--I mean to W R.\"  \"Fine. You can ask him at the same time to authorize you to give me the other thirty.\"  Gootes lost his British speech instantly. \"What other thirty, bum?\"  \"Why, the balance of the fifty. For an introduction to Mi--to the maker of the Metamorphizer. To compensate me, you know, for my loss of revenue.\"  \"Weener, you have all the earmarks of a castiron moocher. Let me tell you, suh--such methods are unbecoming. They suggest damyankee push and blackmail. Remember Reconstruction and White Supremacy, suh.\"  If I were hypersensitive to the silly things people say, I should have given up selling long before. I pretended not to hear him. We walked into a drugstore and he dropped a nickel into a payphone, hunching the receiver between ear and shoulder. \"Fifty your last word?\" he asked out of the corner of his mouth.  I nodded.  \"Hello? _'Gencer?_ Gootes. Hya, beautiful? Syphilis all cleared up? Now ... now, baby ... well, if youre going to be formal--gimme W R.\" He turned to me and leered while he waited.  \"... Chief? Gootes. Got the Dinkman story. You know--Freak Growth Swallows Hollywood Mansion. Yeah. Yeah. I know. But, Chief--this was what I wanted you for--on the followup; I have the fellow who put the stuff on the grass. Yeah. Sure I did. Yeah. And the sonofabitch wants to hold us up for another thirty. Or else he won't sing. Yeah. Yeah. I know. But I can't, Chief. I havent got a lead. I don't know, Chief, not much of a one, I guess. Wait a minute.\"  He turned to me. \"Listen, little man: Mr Le ffaçasé\"--he pronounced it l'fassassy and he pronounced it with awe. I too was properly solemn, for I hadnt realized before to whom he referred when he talked so lightly of \"W R.\" I knew--as what newspaper reader didnt--of William Rufus Le ffaçasé, \"The Last of the Great Editors,\" but I hadnt connected him with the _Daily Intelligencer_-- \"--Mr Le ffaçasé will shoot you another sawbuck and no more. What's the deal?\"  Now, the famous editor's reputation was such that you didnt tell him to go to the devil, even through the medium of an agent; it would have been like writing your name on the Lincoln Memorial. It was reluctantly therefore that I shook my head. \"I'm sorry, Mr Gootes,\" I apologized, \"I'd certainly like to oblige--\"  He cut me off with a waving hand and turned cheerfully back to the telephone. \"No soap, Chief. O K. O K. All right--put the rewrite man on.\" And for the next ten minutes he went over the events at the Dinkmans', carefully spelling out all names including the napoleonic firechief's. I began to suspect Gootes wasnt so inefficient a reporter as he appeared.  The story given in, he hung up and turned to me. \"Well, so long, little man--been nice knowing you.\"  \"But--what about meeting the discoverer of the Metamorphizer?\"  \"Oh, that. Well, W R thinks we don't need him anymore. Not enough in that angle.\"  I suspected he was bluffing; still it was possible he wasnt. In such a delicate situation there was nothing I could do but bluff in turn. If you are a good salesman, I always say, you must have psychology at your fingertips. \"Very well, Mr Gootes; perhaps I shall see you again sometime.\"  I was immediately confronted by a Frenchman, affable, volatile, affectionate. \"Ah cher ami, do not leave me with the abruptness. You desolate mon coeur. Alors--return to me the twenty dollars.\"  \"But, Mr Gootes--\"  \"None of it, bud.\" He whisked the cards out and showed them to me, the ace of spades ghoulishly visible, its ominousness tempered only by the word \"Bicycle\" printed across it. \"Don't hold out on your Uncle Jacson or I might have the boys take you for a little trip. A block of concrete tastefully inscribed 'A Weener' ought to make an amusing base for a birdbath, say.\"  \"Listen, Gootes.\" I was firm. \"I'm reasonably certain youve been authorized to advance me the other thirty, but I hope we're both sensible people and I'll be glad to sign a receipt for the full amount if youll let me have twentyfive.\"  \"Albert, youre a fine fellow--a prince.\" On a page from his notebook he wrote, _Of Jacson Gootes, $50 U.S._ and I signed it. He handed me another twentydollarbill and put his wallet away. \"Charge the other five to agent's fees,\" he suggested. \"Lead us to your Steinmetz.\"  You just can't expect everyone to have the same standards of probity, so philosophically I pocketed my loss and gains together. Life is full of ups and downs and take the bad with the good. Gootes was in high spirits after his piece of chicanery and as we went down the street he practiced, quite unsuccessfully, a series of ventriloquial exercises.   _10._ The appearance of the apartmenthouse drew the comment from him that it was a good thing for their collective bloodpressures the Chamber of Commerce and the All Year Club didnt know such things existed in the heart of Hollywood. \"It's no better than I live in myself,\" he added.  He whistled at the dismal livingroom and raised his eyebrows at the kitchen. Before I could mutter an introduction, Miss Francis growled without turning around, \"If youve come about the icebox--\"  \"Zounds!\" exclaimed Gootes. \"A female Linnaeus. Shades of Dorothy Dix!\"  \"I don't know who you are, young man, but youre extremely impudent to come tramping into my kitchen, adding nothing to the sum of knowledge but a confirmation of my sex which would be plain to any mammal. If youve--\"  \"Nein, Fräulein Doktor,\" said Gootes hastily, \"about z' kelvinators I know nossing. I represent, Fräulein Doktor, z' _Daily Intelligencer_ zeitung--\"  Miss Francis pierced his turgid explanation with a sharp spate of words in what I took to be German. Gootes answered with difficult slowness, but he fumbled and halted before long and abandoning the Central European, became again the Southern Gentleman. \"I quite understand, mam, how any delicately reared gentlewoman would resent having her privacy intruded upon by rude agents of the yellow press. But consider, mam: we live in a progressive age and having made a great contribution to Science you can hardly escape the fame rightfully yours. You are a public figure now and must stand in the light. Would it not be preferable, mam, to talk as lady to gentleman (I am related to the Taliaferros of Ruffin County on the distaff side) than to be badgered by some hack journalist?\"  Miss Francis squatted ungracefully on her heels and looked up from the flowerpot she had been engaged with. \"I havent any objection to publicity, hack or otherwise,\" she said mildly. \"I am merely impressed again by the invulnerability of newspapers to thousands of important discoveries and inventions, newsworthy 'contributions to Science' as you call them in your bland ignorance of semantics, in contrast to their acute, almost painful sensitivity to any mischance.\"  Gootes, unjointing disproportioned length carelessly against the sink to the peril of several jars of specimens, didnt reply. Instead he fluttered his arms and produced a halfdollar, apparently from Miss Francis' hair, which after exhibiting he prudently pocketed.  \"Tell me, Dr Francis--\"  \"Miss. Show me how you did that trick.\"  \"In a minute, Miss Francis. It's a honey, isnt it? Paid fourbits to a funhouse in Utica, New York, for it. Tell me, how did you come to make your great discovery?\"  \"I was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24247"],["title","Gun for Hire (#0)"],["body","gun is an interesting weapon; it can be hired, of  course, and naturally doesn't care who hires it. Something  much the same can be said of the gunman, too...._    GUN FOR HIRE    By   MACK  REYNOLDS    Illustrated by van Dongen   Joe Prantera called softly, \"Al.\" The pleasurable, comfortable, warm feeling began spreading over him, the way it always did.  The older man stopped and squinted, but not suspiciously, even now.  The evening was dark, it was unlikely that the other even saw the circle of steel that was the mouth of the shotgun barrel, now resting on the car's window ledge.  \"Who's it?\" he growled.  Joe Prantera said softly, \"Big Louis sent me, Al.\"  And he pressed the trigger.  And at that moment, the universe caved inward upon Joseph Marie Prantera.  There was nausea and nausea upon nausea.  There was a falling through all space and through all time. There was doubling and twisting and twitching of every muscle and nerve.  There was pain, horror and tumultuous fear.  And he came out of it as quickly and completely as he'd gone in.  He was in, he thought, a hospital and his first reaction was to think, _This here California. Everything different._ Then his second thought was _Something went wrong. Big Louis, he ain't going to like this._  [Illustration]  He brought his thinking to the present. So far as he could remember, he hadn't completely pulled the trigger. That at least meant that whatever the rap was it wouldn't be too tough. With luck, the syndicate would get him off with a couple of years at Quentin.  A door slid open in the wall in a way that Joe had never seen a door operate before. _This here California._  The clothes on the newcomer were wrong, too. For the first time, Joe Prantera began to sense an alienness--a something that was awfully wrong.  The other spoke precisely and slowly, the way a highly educated man speaks a language which he reads and writes fluently but has little occasion to practice vocally. \"You have recovered?\"  Joe Prantera looked at the other expressionlessly. Maybe the old duck was one of these foreign doctors, like.  The newcomer said, \"You have undoubtedly been through a most harrowing experience. If you have any untoward symptoms, possibly I could be of assistance.\"  Joe couldn't figure out how he stood. For one thing, there should have been some kind of police guard.  The other said, \"Perhaps a bit of stimulant?\"  Joe said flatly, \"I wanta lawyer.\"  The newcomer frowned at him. \"A lawyer?\"  \"I'm not sayin' nothin'. Not until I get a mouthpiece.\"  The newcomer started off on another tack. \"My name is Lawrence Reston-Farrell. If I am not mistaken, you are Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"  Salviati happened to be Joe's mother's maiden name. But it was unlikely this character could have known that. Joe had been born in Naples and his mother had died in childbirth. His father hadn't brought him to the States until the age of five and by that time he had a stepmother.  \"I wanta mouthpiece,\" Joe said flatly, \"or let me outta here.\"  Lawrence Reston-Farrell said, \"You are not being constrained. There are clothes for you in the closet there.\"  Joe gingerly tried swinging his feet to the floor and sitting up, while the other stood watching him, strangely. He came to his feet. With the exception of a faint nausea, which brought back memories of that extreme condition he'd suffered during ... during what? He hadn't the vaguest idea of what had happened.  He was dressed in a hospital-type nightgown. He looked down at it and snorted and made his way over to the closet. It opened on his approach, the door sliding back into the wall in much the same manner as the room's door had opened for Reston-Farrell.  Joe Prantera scowled and said, \"These ain't my clothes.\"  \"No, I am afraid not.\"  \"You think I'd be seen dead wearing this stuff? What is this, some religious crackpot hospital?\"  Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid, Mr. Salviati-Prantera, that these are the only garments available. I suggest you look out the window there.\"  Joe gave him a long, chill look and then stepped to the window. He couldn't figure the other. Unless he was a fruitcake. Maybe he was in some kind of pressure cooker and this was one of the fruitcakes.  He looked out, however, not on the lawns and walks of a sanitarium but upon a wide boulevard of what was obviously a populous city.  And for a moment again, Joe Prantera felt the depths of nausea.  This was not his world.  He stared for a long, long moment. The cars didn't even have wheels, he noted dully. He turned slowly and faced the older man.  Reston-Farrell said compassionately, \"Try this, it's excellent cognac.\"  Joe Prantera stared at him, said finally, flatly, \"What's it all about?\"  The other put down the unaccepted glass. \"We were afraid first realization would be a shock to you,\" he said. \"My colleague is in the adjoining room. We will be glad to explain to you if you will join us there.\"  \"I wanta get out of here,\" Joe said.  \"Where would you go?\"  The fear of police, of Al Rossi's vengeance, of the measures that might be taken by Big Louis on his failure, were now far away.  Reston-Farrell had approached the door by which he had entered and it reopened for him. He went through it without looking back.  There was nothing else to do. Joe dressed, then followed him.         *       *       *       *       *  In the adjoining room was a circular table that would have accommodated a dozen persons. Two were seated there now, papers, books and soiled coffee cups before them. There had evidently been a long wait.  Reston-Farrell, the one Joe had already met, was tall and drawn of face and with a chainsmoker's nervousness. The other was heavier and more at ease. They were both, Joe estimated, somewhere in their middle fifties. They both looked like docs. He wondered, all over again, if this was some kind of pressure cooker.  But that didn't explain the view from the window.  Reston-Farrell said, \"May I present my colleague, Citizen Warren Brett-James? Warren, this is our guest from ... from yesteryear, Mr. Joseph Salviati-Prantera.\"  Brett-James nodded to him, friendly, so far as Joe could see. He said gently, \"I think it would be Mr. Joseph Prantera, wouldn't it? The maternal linage was almost universally ignored.\" His voice too gave the impression he was speaking a language not usually on his tongue.  Joe took an empty chair, hardly bothering to note its alien qualities. His body seemed to _fit_ into the piece of furniture, as though it had been molded to his order.  Joe said, \"I think maybe I'll take that there drink, Doc.\"  Reston-Farrell said, \"Of course,\" and then something else Joe didn't get. Whatever the something else was, a slot opened in the middle of the table and a glass, so clear of texture as to be all but invisible, was elevated. It contained possibly three ounces of golden fluid.  Joe didn't allow himself to think of its means of delivery. He took up the drink and bolted it. He put the glass down and said carefully, \"What's it all about, huh?\"  Warren Brett-James said soothingly, \"Prepare yourself for somewhat of a shock, Mr. Prantera. You are no longer in Los Angeles--\"  \"Ya think I'm stupid? I can see that.\"  \"I was about to say, Los Angeles of 1960. Mr. Prantera, we welcome you to Nuevo Los Angeles.\"  \"Ta where?\"  \"To Nuevo Los Angeles and to the year--\" Brett-James looked at his companion. \"What is the date, Old Calendar?\"  \"2133,\" Reston-Farrell said. \"2133 A.D. they would say.\"  Joe Prantera looked from one of them to the other, scowling. \"What are you guys talking about?\"  Warren Brett-James said softly, \"Mr. Prantera, you are no longer in the year 1960, you are now in the year 2133.\"  He said, uncomprehendingly, \"You mean I been, like, unconscious for--\" He let the sentence fall away as he realized the impossibility.  Brett-James said gently, \"Hardly for one hundred and seventy years, Mr. Prantera.\"  Reston-Farrell said, \"I am afraid we are confusing you. Briefly, we have _transported_ you, I suppose one might say, from your own era to ours.\"  Joe Prantera had never been exposed to the concept of time travel. He had simply never associated with anyone who had ever even remotely considered such an idea. Now he said, \"You mean, like, I been asleep all that time?\"  \"Not exactly,\" Brett-James said, frowning.  Reston-Farrell said, \"Suffice to say, you are now one hundred and seventy-three years after the last memory you have.\"  Joe Prantera's mind suddenly reverted to those last memories and his eyes narrowed dangerously. He felt suddenly at bay. He said, \"Maybe you guys better let me in on what's this all about.\"  Reston-Farrell said, \"Mr. Prantera, we have brought you from your era to perform a task for us.\"  Joe stared at him, and then at the other. He couldn't believe he was getting through to them. Or, at least, that they were to him.  Finally he said, \"If I get this, you want me to do a job for you.\"  \"That is correct.\"  Joe said, \"You guys know the kind of jobs I do?\"  \"That is correct.\"  \"Like hell you do. You think I'm stupid? I never even seen you before.\" Joe Prantera came abruptly to his feet. \"I'm gettin' outta here.\"  For the second time, Reston-Farrell said, \"Where would you go, Mr. Prantera?\"  Joe glared at him. Then sat down again, as abruptly as he'd arisen.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Let's start all over again. I got this straight, you brought me, some screwy way, all the way ... here. O.K., I'll buy that. I seen what it looks like out that window--\" The real comprehension was seeping through to him even as he talked. \"Everybody I know, Jessie, Tony, the Kid, Big Louis, everybody, they're dead. Even Big Louis.\"  \"Yes,\" Brett-James said, his voice soft. \"They are all dead, Mr. Prantera. Their children are all dead, and their grandchildren.\"  The two men of the future said nothing more for long minutes while Joe Prantera's mind whirled its confusion.  Finally he said, \"What's this bit about you"]]]
