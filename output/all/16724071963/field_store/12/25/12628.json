I heard the step of Ham a moment later. The whining of the dog attracted his attention, and he let him in before he went to his room. My heart beat as though I had robbed the mail myself. I trembled for Ham. Though he had always been overbearing and tyrannical in his demeanor towards me; though he had taken a mean and cowardly advantage of me that evening; though he was a young man whom I could not like,--yet I had lived in the same house with him for several years, and known him ever since I came to Torrentville. I did not wish anything so bad to come upon him as that he was bringing upon himself. It was sad and pitiful enough to be mean and tyrannical, without being a thief and a robber.  I really pitied Ham, and if he had not destroyed the letter, I should have gone to him, and begged him to retrace his steps. I knew him too well to take such a course now, and I lay thinking of his crime, till, overcome with weariness, I went to sleep.     CHAPTER VIII.  MISS LARRABEE'S LETTER.   If I did not get up as early as usual the next morning, none of my tyrants were stirring in season to abuse me for lying abed so late; for they, like myself, had not retired until after midnight. The first thing that came to my mind in the morning was the scene I had witnessed in the post-office. The secret seemed to burn in my soul, and I wanted some means of getting rid of it. I actually pitied Ham, and would gladly have availed myself of any method of saving him from the crime--of saving him from himself, rather than from the penalty of the offence, for even then the crime seemed to me to be worse than the punishment, and more to be dreaded.  It was nearly breakfast time when Ham made his appearance, and I imagined that he had found some difficulty in going to sleep with the burden of his crime resting upon his conscience. Squire Fishley did not appear till the family were just ready to sit down at the table. He looked sleepy, stupid, and ashamed of himself, and Mrs. Fishley thought he must have taken cold. According to his custom, the senator said grace at the table, by invitation of his brother, who, however, never returned thanks himself.  I could not help keeping one eye fixed on the distinguished man, for so unusual an event as saying grace in that house did not fail to make an impression upon me. I noticed that he cast frequent glances at me, and very uneasy ones at that. Doubtless he felt that I could unfold a tale which was not exactly consistent with his religious pretensions. But, in spite of all I knew, I did not regard him as a hypocrite. I did not know enough about him to enable me to reach so severe a judgment. The shame and penitence he had manifested assured me he was not in the habit of getting intoxicated; and I was willing to believe that he had been led away by the force of circumstances a single time, and that the error would cure itself by its own reaction.  \"It's rather chilly this morning,\" said Captain Fishley. \"Buck, you may make a little fire in the stove.\"  \"It has cleared off pleasant, and it will be warmer by and by, when the sun gets up,\" added Mrs. Fishley, who always had something to say, on every possible topic that could be introduced, whether she knew anything about it or not.  I went to the store. In the open stove were the tindered remains of the letter Ham had burned. The sheet of paper had been entirely consumed; but the envelope, which he had destroyed afterwards, was only half burned. The right hand lower corner had apparently been wet, so that it resisted the action of the fire, and appeared to rise in judgment against the mail robber. The piece contained part of the last name of the superscription, with a portion of the town, county, and state, of the address. Without any definite purpose in doing so, I put the remains of the envelope in my pocket.  While I was making the fire, Miss Larrabee entered the store, and went up to the counter appropriated to the post-office. Ham whistled Yankee Doodle, which was patriotic enough, but out of place even in the shop, and sauntered leisurely over to wait upon her. I was astonished to see how cool he was; but I think the whistle had a deceptive effect.  \"Has that letter come yet?\" asked Miss Larrabee; and her anxiety was visible in the tones of her voice.  \"What letter do you mean, Miss Larrabee?\" asked Ham, suspending his whistle, and looking as blank as though he had never heard of it.  \"Why, the letter I came for last night,\" replied the ancient maiden.  \"For yourself?\"  \"Yes; the letter from Ethan's folks.\"  \"I haven't heard anything about it before.\"  \"Well, you was a standin' here last night when I axed your father for it,\" added Miss Larrabee, who thought the matter was of consequence enough to have everybody take an interest in it.  \"I didn't mind what you said. So many letters come here, that I can't keep the run of them.\"  \"I've axed your father for't goin' on three times; and he said it would come in last night's mail. It must have come afore this time.\"  \"If it must, I suppose it has,\" replied Ham, taking a pile of letters from the pigeon-hole marked L.  Having lighted the kindlings in the stove, I stood up to observe the conduct of Ham. He resumed his whistle, and examined the letters. Of course he did not find the one he was looking for.  \"None for Larrabee,\" said he, suspending the patriotic air long enough to utter the words.  \"Goodness gracious! There must be!\" exclaimed the unhappy spinster. \"Have you looked 'em all over?\"  \"I have.\"  But Ham took down the L's again, and went through the pile once more.  \"None for Larrabee,\" he repeated, and then, for variety's sake, whistled the first strain of Hail, Columbia.  \"But, Mr. Fishley, there must be a letter for me. Ethan writ me there was one comin'; and he said it would be here by to-day, for sartain,\" protested Miss Larrabee. \"Mebbe it's got into some other hole.\"  \"Well, to please you, I'll look them all over; but I don't remember seeing any letter for you.\"  \"I tell ye it must have come afore now,\" persisted the venerable maiden.  Ham whistled his favorite air as he went through all the letters in the pigeon-holes, from A to Z. He did not find it, and Miss Larrabee was in despair. She had made all her preparations to visit \"Jim's folks,\" and had intended to start that day.  \"It's a shame!\" exclaimed she. \"I know Ethan sent the letter. He wouldn't play no sech trick on me. Them mail folks ought to look out for things better'n that.\"  \"If it didn't come, it didn't,\" added Ham, consolingly.  \"But I know it did come. Ethan must have put it in the post-office. 'Tain't like him to say he'd do a thing, and then not do it. I almost know he sent the letter.\"  At this point Captain Fishley and his brother entered the store, and Miss Larrabee appealed to him. The postmaster looked the letters over very carefully; but, as there was none for the lady, he couldn't find any. He was very sorry, but he displayed more philosophy than the spinster, and \"bore up\" well under the trial.  \"What on airth am I to do!\" ejaculated Miss Larrabee. \"Here I've got all ready to go and see Jim's folks; but I can't go because I hain't got no money. When I set about doin' a thing, I want to do it.\"  \"People sometimes make mistakes in directing their letters, and then they have to go to the dead-letter office,\" suggested Captain Fishley.  \"Ethan didn't make no mistake. 'Tain't like him to make mistakes. Do you think Ethan don't know where I live?\"  \"I don't know anything about it, only that the letter isn't here.\"  \"Dear suz! What shall I do? When a body's made up her mind to go, it's desp'ate aggravatin' not to go.\"  At this trying juncture, Squire Fishley interposed, and, after some inquiries in regard to the responsibility of the parties, suggested that his brother should lend the lady money enough to enable her to make her journey.  \"I'd be much obleeged to you, Captain Fishley, if you'd do it,\" said Miss Larrabee, delighted with the suggestion. \"I shan't be gone more'n a month, and when I come back I'll hand it to you. That letter must come to-day or to-morrow, and if you have a mind to, you can open it, and take the money out. It will save me the interest.\"  \"But suppose the letter has gone to the dead-letter office?\" added the postmaster.  \"Sakes alive! I've got money enough to pay it, if the letter is lost. Why, Ethan's got more'n 'leven hundred dollars that belongs to me.\"  \"All right, Miss Larrabee,\" replied Captain Fishley, as he took out the money, and wrote a note for the amount.  The worthy maiden of many summers put on her spectacles, signed the note, and counted the money. She was happy again, for the journey was not to be deferred. I think Ham was as glad to have her go as she was to go. I could not help watching him very closely after his father and the squire left the store, to observe how he carried himself in his course of deception and crime. I had never known him to whistle so much before, and I regarded it as the stimulus he used in keeping up his self-possession.  \"What are you staring at me for, Buck Bradford?\" demanded he, as I stood gazing across the counter at him.  \"A cat may look at the king,\" I replied, stung by the harsh words, after I had cherished so many kind feelings towards him, though I forgot that I had not expressed them, since the affray on the road.  \"Do I owe you anything?\"  \"No, you don't owe me anything.\"  \"Yes, I do. I owe you something on last night's account, and I'm going to pay it too,\" he added, shaking his head at me in a threatening manner.  I did not like his style, and not wishing to make a disturbance in the store, I said nothing. I walked up to the stove, where I found that my fire was not doing very well, for my interest in the letter had caused me to neglect it. I put on some more kindlings, and then knelt"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24284"],["title","Parochial and Plain Sermons, Vol. VIII (of 8) (#0)"],["body","AND PLAIN SERMONS  by  JOHN HENRY NEWMAN, B.D.

Reverence in Worship.  \"_Samuel ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linen ephod._\"--1 Samuel ii. 18.   Samuel, viewed in his place in sacred history, that is, in the course of events which connect Moses with Christ, appears as a great ruler and teacher of his people; this is his prominent character.  He was the first of the prophets; yet, when we read the sacred narrative itself, in which his life is set before us, I suppose those passages are the more striking and impressive which represent him, in the office which belonged to him by birth, as a Levite, or minister of God.  He was taken into God's special service from the first; he lived in His Temple; nay, while yet a child, he was honoured with the apparel of a sacred function, as the text tells us, \"he ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.\"  His mother had \"given him unto the Lord all the days of his life[1],\" by a solemn vow before his birth; and in him, if in any one, were fulfilled the words of the Psalmist, \"Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house, they will be always praising Thee[2].\"  Such a constant abode in God's house would make common minds only familiar with holy things, and irreverent; but where God's grace is present in the heart, the effect is the reverse; which we might be sure would happen in the case of Samuel.  \"The Lord was with him,\" we are told; and therefore the more the outward signs of that Lord met his eye, the more reverent he became, not the more presuming.  The more he acquainted himself with God, the greater would be his awe and holy fear.  Thus the first notice we have of his ministering before the Lord, reminds us of the decency and gravity necessary at all times, and in all persons, in approaching Him.  \"He ministered before the Lord, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.\"  His mother had made him yearly a little coat for his common use, but in Divine Service he wore, not this, but a garment which would both express, and impress upon him, reverence.  And, in like manner, in his old age, when Saul sent to seek David at Naioth, where Samuel was, his messengers found Samuel and the prophets under him all in decent order.  \"They saw the company of prophets prophesying, and Samuel over them.\"  And this was so impressive a sight, that it became an instrument of God's supernatural power towards them, and they prophesied also.  On the other hand, if we would have an example of the want of this reverence, we have it in Saul himself, the reprobate king, who, when he was on his way to Naioth, and was visited by God's Holy Spirit, did not thereupon receive the garment of salvation, nor was clothed in righteousness, but behaved himself in an unseemly wild way, as one whose destitution and shame were but detected by the visitation.  He stript off his clothes and prophesied before Samuel, and lay down in that state all that day and all that night.  This difference we see even at this day:--of persons professing religion, some are like Samuel, some like Saul; some (as it were) cast off their garments and prophesy in disorder and extravagance; others minister before the Lord, \"girded with a linen ephod,\" with \"their loins girt and their lamps burning,\" like men awfully expecting the coming of their great and glorious Judge.  By the latter, I mean the true children of the Holy Catholic Church, by the former, I mean heretics and schismatic.  There have ever been from the first these two kinds of Christians--those who belonged to the Church, and those who did not. There never was a time since the Apostles' day, when the Church was not; and there never was a time but men were to be found who preferred some other way of worship to the Church's way.  These two kinds of professed Christians ever have been--Church Christians, and Christians not of the Church; and it is remarkable, I say, that while, on the one hand, reverence for sacred things has been a characteristic of Church Christians on the whole, so, want of reverence has been the characteristic on the whole of Christians not of the Church.  The one have prophesied after the figure of Samuel, the other after the figure of Saul.  Of course there are many exceptions to this remark in the case of individuals.  Of course I am not speaking of inconsistent persons and exceptional cases, in the Church, or out of it; but of those who act up to what they profess.  I mean that zealous, earnest, and faithful members of the Church have generally been reverent; and zealous, earnest, and faithful members of other religious bodies have generally been irreverent.  Again, after all, there will be real exceptions in the case of individuals which we cannot account for; but I mean that, on, the _whole_, it will be found that reverence is one of the marks or notes of the Church; true though it may be that some particular individuals, who have kept apart from it, have not been without a reverential spirit notwithstanding.  Indeed so natural is the connexion between a reverential spirit in worshipping God, and faith in God, that the wonder only is, how any one can for a moment imagine he has faith in God, and yet allow himself to be irreverent towards Him.  To believe in God, is to believe the being and presence of One who is All-holy, and All-powerful, and All-gracious; how can a man really believe thus of Him, and yet make free with Him? it is almost a contradiction in terms.  Hence even heathen religions have ever considered faith and reverence identical. To believe, and not to revere, to worship familiarly, and at one's ease, is an anomaly and a prodigy unknown even to false religions, to say nothing of the true one.  Not only the Jewish and Christian religions, which are directly from God, inculcate the spirit of \"reverence and godly fear,\" but those other religions which have existed, or exist, whether in the East or the South, inculcate the same.  Worship, forms of worship--such as bowing the knee, taking off the shoes, keeping silence, a prescribed dress, and the like--are considered as necessary for a due approach to God.  The whole world, differing about so many things differing in creed and "]]]
