He looked as if it would do him a world of good to be thinner. But Aunt Nancy felt sorry for him.  \"Whoever leads the way over the wall must pick out another spot,\" she declared, looking straight at Snowball as she spoke. \"It's a shame to annoy this gentleman.\"  Everybody agreed with her good-naturedly. And Snowball said meekly that if he found himself running towards the wall he would try to turn his steps in another direction.  No one said anything more about the matter. For somebody suddenly cried, \"_Baa! baa!_\" and scrambled over the wall.  Of course the whole flock followed instantly, leaving Uncle Jerry Chuck to creep out of his hole and watch the last tail of all bob out of sight.  It was Aunt Nancy's.  \"They're a queer lot,\" Uncle Jerry said aloud. He gave a long whistle. \"I'm glad I'm not one of 'em,\" he added.     XVI  AUNT NANCY'S PLAN   All was quiet once more, after the race from the ledge near Uncle Jerry Chuck's home. The flock was feeding again. And if you hadn't noticed how Aunt Nancy Ewe puffed from her fast running you wouldn't have supposed there had just been a wild scramble over the stone wall and back.  Aunt Nancy was still feeling sorry for Uncle Jerry Chuck, whose rest had been disturbed by the thud of hoofs above his head. \"Remember!\" she said to Snowball sternly. \"Don't go near Uncle Jerry's home again!\"  \"I won't!\" he promised. \"That is,\" he added, \"I won't if I can help it. If I find myself running that way I may not be able to stop myself.\"  Now, that sort of promise wasn't enough for Aunt Nancy.  \"You must turn aside!\" she told Snowball. \"Just make believe that there's a bear beyond the stone wall, instead of Uncle Jerry Chuck! _Then_--\" she said--\"_then_ you'll turn quickly enough!\"  \"That's a good idea!\" cried Snowball. \"If only I don't forget it!\"  Aunt Nancy's words never left his mind all the rest of the morning. Just thinking about bears made Snowball frightfully uneasy. Whenever one of the flock happened to stray up behind him Snowball jumped, fearing for a moment that it was a bear.  If anybody said _baa_ in his ear he leaped to one side, expecting the _baa_ to turn into a _woof!_  He began to wish that Aunt Nancy hadn't told him of her idea.  And all at once, when somebody came up behind him and gave him a nudge, Snowball started to run.  \"There's a bear behind me!\" he thought.  Of course the rest of the flock thought he was only playing Follow My Leader. So they followed him, every one of them.  Snowball went bounding across the pasture towards the stone wall, headed straight for the spot where Uncle Jerry Chuck had his home. When he was only a few jumps away from the wall he glanced back. He saw then that there was no bear behind him. But he did notice Aunt Nancy Ewe, doing her best to keep up with the rest. And then Snowball remembered what she had said to him. If a bear--instead of Uncle Jerry Chuck--lived in the hole at the foot of the ledge!  Well, that thought was enough to make Snowball swerve sharply to his right. And a few moments later he bobbed over the wall a little further up the hillside.  Just beyond the wall grew a tangle of berry bushes. And into the midst of them Snowball jumped. And out of the midst of them, right in front of him, there rose up on his hind legs--a bear!  Snowball gave a frightened, frantic blat. The next instant he was scrambling back over the wall.  The foremost of the oncoming flock of sheep saw him. They couldn't think what had happened. Anyhow, they couldn't stop. Close behind them pressed the flock, all bunched together and hurrying blindly on.     XVII  A TERRIBLE MIX-UP   There was a terrible mix-up. Some sheep were trying to cross the stone wall in one direction. Some were trying to cross it in the other. And in the midst of the fleecy tangle Snowball struggled in vain. He found himself face to face with Aunt Nancy Ewe, who was so huge that he couldn't budge her. He pushed and shoved until she cried out, \"Where are your manners, young man?\"  \"I--I don't know,\" Snowball stammered. \"Maybe I left them in the berry bushes, with the bear.\"  [Illustration: Snowball Gave A Frantic Blat.  _The Tale of Snowball Lamb._ _Page 87_]  Well, the moment she heard the word _bear_ Aunt Nancy blatted at the top of her lungs. With a mighty heave she turned about on the top of the wall, sweeping Snowball off it as if he were nothing but a fly.  He fell backwards among the raspberry bushes, fully expecting to be eaten by the bear. He shut his eyes and held his breath, and lay with his feet in the air, waiting for the bear to seize him.  \"Oh, dear!\" he groaned. \"I wonder if he'll begin with my head or my tail!\"  Just then he felt a terrible nip at the end of his tail.  \"He's begun! The bear has begun to eat me!\" Snowball thought.  As for the bear, he didn't say a single word. And that seemed odd. Somehow Snowball didn't quite like it because the bear didn't exclaim how nice and tender he was. His tail was still held fast. And that was as much as Snowball knew.  At last he slowly opened his eyes. To his astonishment he saw no bear. In fact he saw nobody at all. For the last of Farmer Green's flock of sheep had vanished. And Snowball noticed, resting on the tip of his tail, a stone. Though he did not know it, the last sheep to leave had kicked it down upon him purely by accident.  Snowball gave a _baa_ of surprise and relief. With a little effort he managed to jerk his tail from under the stone. Then he sprang to his feet. And since there was no knowing where the bear was, Snowball made all haste to get on the other side of the stone wall and join the flock of sheep once more.  When Aunt Nancy saw him she did not act half as pleased as he had expected she would.  \"You got us into a pickle, young man!\" she greeted him.  \"It seems to me,\" he replied, \"that you are the one that made all the trouble. If you hadn't made me jump the wall----\"  \"If _I_ hadn't made _you_----\" Aunt Nancy interrupted. And turning to her companions she cried, \"Did you ever hear anything like that in all your days?\"  And everybody said, \"No!\"  And then somebody asked, \"Where's the bear?\"  But nobody could answer that question.  The only one that could have answered it was Cuffy Bear himself. And he was way up under the mountain--and still running.  There wasn't a sheep in the flock that had been more frightened than he.     XVIII  THE SWING   As Snowball grew older he began to enjoy a fine, new sport. At least this sport was new to him. All the old rams had enjoyed it for years. But it was not until Snowball's horns began to grow that he became interested in having fun in this way.  The new sport was _butting_. Snowball was careful not to butt any sheep that were much bigger than he was. For instance, he never even threatened to butt the black lamb, who was some months the older of the two. And Snowball didn't butt Johnnie Green; for Snowball was fond of him.  Snowball didn't feel the same toward other boys. Other boys liked to tease him. A neighbor's boy called \"Red\" was the biggest tease of them all. He never missed a chance to bother Snowball--unless Johnnie Green objected.  So it was only to be expected that Snowball should want to butt Red. More than once he had stolen up behind Red and butted him as hard as he could butt.  At first Red only laughed. But as Snowball grew bigger--and heavier--Red no longer found anything to laugh at in Snowball's favorite sport. Instead of laughing, Red was more likely to go to rubbing himself where Snowball had struck him.  \"You'll have to get rid of this pet of yours!\" Red said to Johnnie Green. \"That is, you'll have to if you expect me to come to your place any longer.\"  \"I won't get rid of Snowball,\" Johnnie Green declared. \"It serves you right if he butts you. You've teased him too often. I don't blame Snowball at all.\"  \"Send him away, now; or I'll go home,\" Red threatened.  At that Johnnie Green drove Snowball behind the barn. But he wouldn't stay there. He came trotting back to the farmyard in no time.  \"Leave him alone! Don't pay any attention to him and he won't touch you!\" Johnnie advised Red.  However, that young man was uneasy. But he said nothing more about the matter. And turning to the swing under the big old apple tree he cried, \"Come on, Johnnie! I'll swing you.\"  Now, Johnnie Green had swung in that swing thousands of times. But it wasn't often anybody was willing to stand and push him until he went up, up, up, high among the leafy branches.  \"All right!\" he said. \"None of your tricks, now!\"  Red only grinned. And he began pushing Johnnie. He pushed so hard that for once Johnnie was satisfied. Once he thought the swing seat--with him on it--was going to turn completely over.  The whole thing was most strange. It was most unusual. Red was always ready to be swung. Never had he been willing, before, to swing anybody else. So Johnnie decided to enjoy the fun while he could. Back and forth he rode in long sweeps.  Meanwhile Snowball kept edging nearer. He was behind Red. And all the time Red kept a careful eye on him. But of this Johnnie Green saw nothing. For of course his back was turned to Red and to Snowball, too.  There was no doubt that Snowball wanted to take a hand in the sport--or perhaps it would be better to say _take a horn_. Anyhow he lowered his head now and then, and shook it. And at last he stamped upon the ground.  \"Hang tight, Johnnie!\" Red cried. \"Here comes the biggest push of all!\" And he gave Johnnie a mighty shove.  Then Red waved his tattered hat almost in Snowball's face.  That was a deadly insult. At least so Snowball thought. He gathered his legs beneath him. He shot forward.  Already Johnnie Green had begun his long backward swing.  For a moment you would have thought Red was going to get caught in a tight place. Johnnie Green was almost upon him. Snowball was almost upon him.  And then Red jumped.     XIX  THE WRONG TARGET   \"Give me another push like that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24592"],["title","The Tale of Snowball Lamb (#6)"],["body","e!\" Johnnie Green shouted from the swing.  Little did he dream that Snowball was rushing towards him from behind, rushing with head lowered in his best butting style.  Of course when the boy Red slipped out of the way there was only one thing that could happen. A moment after Johnnie shouted, Snowball struck the swing seat.  Crash! Bang! Split! A terrible cry from Johnnie Green! And a second or two later a dull thud!  The crash, bang and split came when Snowball's head met the swing seat. The thud followed when Johnnie hit the ground.  Then all was quiet, except for a low moaning from the spot where Johnnie Green lay.  Red had climbed spryly into a wagon which stood near-by. But he soon saw that he needn't have gone to that trouble. For Snowball plainly had no more butts left in him for the time being. He stood still in a dazed fashion and stared dully about him. The heavy oaken swing seat had been no soft mark to hit, sailing swiftly through the air with eighty pounds of boy upon it.  Red had given one great shout. But now he too was very quiet. He jumped out of the wagon and ran to Johnnie Green, and lifted Johnnie's head.  \"Are you hurt, Johnnie?\" he asked.  But it was almost a minute before Johnnie Green could speak. It was almost as long as that before he could even breathe. He lay there gasping, with his hands clutched across his stomach. His eyes rolled about in the queerest way. If Red hadn't been frightened he would have laughed in Johnnie's face.  At last Johnnie Green spoke.  \"Wh-wh-what happened?\" he asked in a halting whisper. \"Did the ropes break?\"  \"No!\" Red answered. \"The ropes held--though it's a wonder.\"  \"Can't you tell me what happened?\" Johnnie begged him. \"If it wasn't the ropes, what was it?\"  \"It was Snowball,\" said Red. \"He butted you.\"  \"I don't believe it,\" cried Johnnie. \"He never butted me in his whole life.\"  Johnnie Green was sitting up now. And since he didn't seem to be much hurt the boy Red couldn't help grinning.  \"Look at that swing seat!\" he exclaimed, pointing to the splintered bit of oak board near Johnnie. \"You don't think--do you?--that I split that thing with _my_ head?\"  And then Johnnie Green just had to believe him. And Johnnie began to get angry, too.  \"You must have seen Snowball coming,\" he growled. \"Why didn't you warn me?\"  Red swallowed a few times as he tried to think of a good answer.  \"Well,\" he replied finally, \"I didn't _know_ he was going to butt you, did I? Didn't you just say yourself that he never _had_ butted you?\"  To all this Johnnie Green made no answer.  \"If you ask me,\" Red went on more easily, \"I should say you were lucky. You were lucky to have that swing seat under you.\"  Johnnie Green rose slowly to his feet.  \"There's something queer about this,\" he declared.  \"That's so,\" Red agreed. \"There is. You'd just asked for another hard push. . . . And you got one--a harder one than I could have given you. . . . So I don't see what you're complaining about.\"  And then he pretended that he didn't understand why Johnnie Green tried to hit him.     XX  THE SWIMMING HOLE   After the affair at the swing it was as much as a week before Johnnie Green saw anything of his neighbor Red.  It was almost a week before Snowball felt like butting anybody. Even when other sheep bullied him Snowball edged away from them; and once he would have run into them head first.  Somehow he couldn't forget that frightful jolt he had received when he knocked Johnnie Green out of the swing.  At last, however, he tried a gentle butt one day against the soft side of one of his mates. And finding only pleasure, and no pain, in the trick he became once more one of the most active butters in Farmer Green's whole flock.  Now, Johnnie Green had noticed that for a few days Snowball was unusually well behaved. And Snowball's gentleness did not please him. For Johnnie had hoped that sometime Snowball would butt the neighbor's boy Red.  So Johnnie Green began to whistle a merry tune a little later, when he chanced to see Snowball charging the hired man as he crossed the pasture.  Not long after that Johnnie Green went swimming. He found other boys at the swimming hole, which they had made by damming Broad Brook where it cut across the end of the meadow. Among the swimmers was the boy Red. It was the first time Johnnie had seen him since that day when Snowball butted Johnnie.  When Johnnie spied Red in the water he thought for a moment or two that he would find Red's clothes on the bank and tie knots in them. That was a favorite trick of Red's--tying hard knots in other boys' clothes. Sometimes he even wet the knots, to make them harder to untie.  But Johnnie Green decided that he wouldn't knot Red's clothes. Besides, Red seemed to be keeping a watchful eye on them.  Johnnie slipped out of his own clothes quickly and soon he had dived off a flat rock and joined the boys in the swimming hole.  Red had called \"Hullo!\" pleasantly enough. And then Johnnie was sure he said something in an undertone to the others. Anyhow they all grinned. And one boy cried, \"I didn't expect to see you down here. I thought you'd be swinging. Wouldn't you rather swing than swim?\"  Johnnie Green gave a sickly smile.  \"Why didn't you bring your lamb with you?\" another inquired. \"Doesn't he follow you any more?\"  But Johnnie Green had ducked down where he couldn't hear and was swimming under water. When he came up everybody yelled at him. That is, everybody yelled except Red. _He_ looked very innocent, as if he didn't know what the joke was.  Well, Johnnie Green had a good swim, anyhow. And the boys soon stopped teasing him. They had several swimming races, with a good deal of splashing mixed in. And there was so much fun that nobody noticed when Red crawled out upon the bank and slipped away behind the drooping willows that overhung the stream.  The boys saw him plainly enough a little while afterward. Fully dressed he stood on the bank and jeered at them. And they knew what that meant. It meant that he had tied plenty of knots in everybody's clothes.  All the boys except Johnnie Green yelled at him.  \"We'll fix you when we catch you!\" they cried.  As for Johnnie, he said never a word. In fact he didn't even look angry. On the contrary, he smiled. For he saw something that his friends had overlooked.  Some distance behind Red Johnnie saw the willows part. And a white face peered out.  It was Snowball's.     XXI  A DUCKING   As he stood there on the great flat rock over the swimming hole Red never guessed that Snowball was behind him. But the swimmers soon noticed Snowball. And they all began to call to Red. They didn't care what they said, so long as they could keep Red so busy answering them that he wouldn't turn around and discover Snowball. They splashed about, and hooted, and on the whole made such an uproar that Red couldn't have heard the Muley Cow had she walked up behind him.  Now, there was nothing that Red enjoyed any more than a wordy battle. Whenever a boy called him a name Red hurled a worse one back at him. It seemed as if he actually took pride in making blood curdling retorts. Certainly he didn't mean to leave, so long as anybody gave him an excuse for a jibe.  Meanwhile Snowball had spied Red. And to Snowball he was a tempting sight. As Snowball drew nearer Red leaned forward with his hands upon his knees and taunted Johnnie Green: \"You'd better keep that ole ram-lamb of yours out of my way! If he ever comes near me I'll----\"  Nobody ever found out what it was that Red meant to do. His threat stuck fast in his throat. For before he could utter it Snowball lowered his head and dashed at him. He gave Red a butt that lifted him off the rock and sent him sailing through the air with arms and legs waving wildly, to fall with a great splash into the swimming hole, where the water was deepest.  There was a howl of delight. But it did not come from Red. He was somewhere between the surface of the water and the mucky bottom.  Presently he appeared, spluttering and blowing and gasping. For once in his life Red had nothing to say in answer to the jibes and jeers of his mates.  His hat was floating near him. Johnnie Green snatched it up, scooped it full of water and clapped it upon Red's head.  Even then Red didn't say a word.  But when Snowball looked blandly down at the boys from the great flat rock and said, \"_Baa-a-a!_\"--then Red spoke.  He spoke his mind very freely and at some length. And he dared Johnnie to come out upon the bank with him.  Johnnie Green promptly swam towards the bank where Snowball stood.  \"Not that side!\" cried Red. \"The other one!\"  But Johnnie remarked mildly that he supposed of course Red meant the side towards home. \"You've got all your clothes on,\" said Johnnie. \"You wouldn't want to have to cross the brook, later, and get them wet.\"  Now, since Red's clothes were as wet as clothes could be, that seemed a very stupid remark. And Red told Johnnie Green--well, he told him a number of things. And then Red scrambled up the opposite bank from the one where Snowball stood, and started off, leaving a trail of water behind him.  Johnnie Green and his friends forsook the swimming hole and took their clothes out upon the flat rock, which was warm in the sunshine. And there they spent a pleasant time untying the knots that Red had made in them. But first the boys made Johnnie Green drive Snowball away.  \"Red will catch it when he gets home,\" said one of them. \"His father told him not to go swimming to-day.\"  And not one of them said he was sorry.     XXII  A GREAT JOKE   Farmer Green played a great joke on his flock of sheep. At least that was what Snowball thought. Since he was not really one of Farmer Green's flock, but belonged to Johnnie Green, he escaped this joke himself. And that was the reason why he was able to laugh so heartily at all his companions.
