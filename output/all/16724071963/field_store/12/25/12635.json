I say, \"complete;\" but I do not know whether they would be called so in the best society. The law of compensation had been well applied: he that had necktie had no cuffs; she that had sash had no handkerchief, and _vice versa_; but they all had shoes and a certain amount of clothing, such as it was, the outside layer being in every case quite above criticism.  \"Now, Sarah Maud,\" said Mrs. Ruggles, her face shining with excitement, \"everything's red up an' we can begin. I've got a boiler 'n' a kettle 'n' a pot o' hot water. Peter, you go into the back bedroom, 'n' I'll take Susan, Kitty, Peory, 'n' Cornelius; 'n' Sarah Maud, you take Clem, 'n' Eily, 'n' Larry, one to a time. Scrub 'em 'n' rinse 'em, or 't any rate git's fur's yer can with 'em, and then I'll finish 'em off while you do yerself.\"  Sarah Maud couldn't have scrubbed with any more decision and force if she had been doing floors, and the little Ruggleses bore it bravely, not from natural heroism, but for the joy that was set before them. Not being satisfied, however, with the \"tone\" of their complexions, and feeling that the number of freckles to the square inch was too many to be tolerated in the highest social circles, she wound up operations by applying a little Bristol brick from the knife-board, which served as the proverbial \"last straw,\" from under which the little Ruggleses issued rather red and raw and out of temper. When the clock struck four they were all clothed, and most of them in their right minds, ready for those last touches that always take the most time.  Kitty's red hair was curled in thirty-four ringlets, Sarah Maud's was braided in one pig-tail, and Susan's and Eily's in two braids apiece, while Peoria's resisted all advances in the shape of hair oils and stuck out straight on all sides, like that of the Circassian girl of the circus--so Clem said; and he was sent into the bedroom for it, too, from whence he was dragged out forgivingly, by Peoria herself, five minutes later. Then, exciting moment, came linen collars for some and neckties and bows for others,--a magnificent green glass breastpin was sewed into Peter's purple necktie,--and Eureka! the Ruggleses were dressed, and Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these!  A row of seats was then formed directly through the middle of the kitchen. Of course, there were not quite chairs enough for ten, since the family had rarely wanted to sit down all at once, somebody always being out or in bed, or otherwise engaged, but the wood-box and the coal-hod finished out the line nicely, and nobody thought of grumbling. The children took their places according to age, Sarah Maud at the head and Larry on the coal-hod, and Mrs. Ruggles seated herself in front, surveying them proudly as she wiped the sweat of honest toil from her brow.  \"Well,\" she exclaimed, \"if I do say so as shouldn't, I never see a cleaner, more stylish mess o' childern in my life! I do wish Ruggles could look at ye for a minute!--Larry Ruggles, how many times have I got ter tell yer not ter keep pullin' at yer sash? Haven't I told yer if it comes ontied, yer waist 'n' skirt'll part comp'ny in the middle, 'n' then where'll yer be?--Now look me in the eye, all of yer! I've of'en told yer what kind of a family the McGrills was. I've got reason to be proud, goodness knows! Your uncle is on the _po_lice force o' New York city; you can take up the paper most any day an' see his name printed right out--James McGrill,--'n' I can't have my children fetched up common, like some folks'; when they go out they've got to have clo'es, and learn to act decent! Now I want ter see how yer goin' to behave when yer git there to-night. 'Tain't so awful easy as you think 'tis. Let's start in at the beginnin' 'n' act out the whole business. Pile into the bedroom, there, every last one o' ye, 'n' show me how yer goin' to go int' the parlor. This'll be the parlor, 'n' I'll be Mis' Bird.\"  [Illustration: \"I WANT TER SEE HOW YER GOIN' TER BEHAVE\"]  The youngsters hustled into the next room in high glee, and Mrs. Ruggles drew herself up in the chair with an infinitely haughty and purse-proud expression that much better suited a descendant of the McGrills than modest Mrs. Bird.  The bedroom was small, and there presently ensued such a clatter that you would have thought a herd of wild cattle had broken loose. The door opened, and they straggled in, all the younger ones giggling, with Sarah Maud at the head, looking as if she had been caught in the act of stealing sheep; while Larry, being last in line, seemed to think the door a sort of gate of heaven which would be shut in his face if he didn't get there in time; accordingly he struggled ahead of his elders and disgraced himself by tumbling in head foremost.  Mrs. Ruggles looked severe. \"There, I knew yer'd do it in some sech fool way! Now go in there and try it over again, every last one o' ye, 'n' if Larry can't come in on two legs he can stay ter home,--d' yer hear?\"  The matter began to assume a graver aspect; the little Ruggleses stopped giggling and backed into the bedroom, issuing presently with lock step, Indian file, a scared and hunted expression on every countenance.  \"No, no, no!\" cried Mrs. Ruggles, in despair. \"That's worse yet; yer look for all the world like a gang o' pris'ners! There ain't no style ter that: spread out more, can't yer, 'n' act kind o' careless-like--nobody's goin' ter kill ye! That ain't what a dinner-party is!\"  The third time brought deserved success, and the pupils took their seats in the row. \"Now, yer know,\" said Mrs. Ruggles impressively, \"there ain't enough decent hats to go round, 'n' if there was I don' know's I'd let yer wear 'em, for the boys would never think to take 'em off when they got inside, for they never do--but anyhow, there ain't enough good ones. Now, look me in the eye. You're only goin' jest round the corner; you needn't wear no hats, none of yer, 'n' when yer get int' the parlor, 'n' they ask yer ter lay off yer hats, Sarah Maud must speak up 'n' say it was sech a pleasant evenin' 'n' sech a short walk that yer left yer hats to home. Now, can yer remember?\"  All the little Ruggleses shouted, \"Yes, marm!\" in chorus.  \"What have _you_ got ter do with it?\" demanded their mother; \"did I tell _you_ to say it? Warn't I talkin' ter Sarah Maud?\"  The little Ruggleses hung their diminished heads. \"Yes, marm,\" they piped, more discreetly.  \"Now we won't leave nothin' to chance; git up, all of ye, an' try it.--Speak up, Sarah Maud.\"  Sarah Maud's tongue clove to the roof of her mouth.  \"Quick!\"  \"Ma thought--it was--sech a pleasant hat that we'd--we'd better leave our short walk to home,\" recited Sarah Maud, in an agony of mental effort.  This was too much for the boys. An earthquake of suppressed giggles swept all along the line.  \"Oh, whatever shall I do with yer?\" moaned the unhappy mother; \"I s'pose I've got to learn it to yer!\"--which she did, word for word, until Sarah Maud thought she could stand on her head and say it backwards.  \"Now, Cornelius, what are _you_ goin' ter say ter make yerself good comp'ny?\"  \"Do? Me? Dunno!\" said Cornelius, turning pale, with unexpected responsibility.  \"Well, ye ain't goin' to set there like a bump on a log 'thout sayin' a word ter pay for yer vittles, air ye? Ask Mis' Bird how she's feelin' this evenin', or if Mr. Bird's hevin' a busy season, or how this kind o' weather agrees with him, or somethin' like that.--Now we'll make b'lieve we've got ter the dinner--that won't be so hard, 'cause yer'll have somethin' to do--it's awful bothersome to stan' round an' act stylish.--If they have napkins, Sarah Maud down to Peory may put 'em in their laps, 'n' the rest of ye can tuck 'em in yer necks. Don't eat with yer fingers--don't grab no vittles off one 'nother's plates; don't reach out for nothin', but wait till yer asked, 'n' if you never _git_ asked don't git up and grab it.--Don't spill nothin' on the tablecloth, or like's not Mis' Bird'll send yer away from the table--'n' I hope she will if yer do! (Susan! keep your handkerchief in your lap where Peory can borry it if she needs it, 'n' I hope she'll know when she does need it, though I don't expect it.) Now we'll try a few things ter see how they'll go! Mr. Clement, do you eat cramb'ry sarse?\"  \"Bet yer life!\" cried Clem, who in the excitement of the moment had not taken in the idea exactly and had mistaken this for an ordinary bosom-of-the-family question.  \"Clement McGrill Ruggles, do you mean to tell me that you'd say that to a dinner-party? I'll give ye one more chance. Mr. Clement, will you take some of the cramb'ry?\"  \"Yes, marm, thank ye kindly, if you happen ter have any handy.\"  \"Very good, indeed! But they won't give yer two tries to-night,--yer just remember that!--Miss Peory, do you speak for white or dark meat?\"  \"I ain't perticler as ter color,--anything that nobody else wants will suit me,\" answered Peory with her best air.  \"First-rate! Nobody could speak more genteel than that. Miss Kitty, will you have hard or soft sarse with your pudden?\"  \"Hard or soft? Oh! A little of both, if you please, an' I'm much obliged,\" said Kitty, bowing with decided ease and grace; at which all the other Ruggleses pointed the finger of shame at her, and Peter _grunted_ expressively, that their meaning might not be mistaken.  \"You just stop your gruntin', Peter Ruggles; that warn't greedy, that was all right. I wish I could git it inter your heads that it ain't so much what yer say, as the way you say it. And don't keep starin' cross-eyed at your necktie pin, or I'll take it out 'n' sew it on to Clem or Cornelius: Sarah Maud'll keep her eye on it, 'n' if it turns broken side out she'll tell yer.

Now, is there anything more ye'd like to practice?\"  \"If yer tell me one more thing, I can't set up an' eat,\" said Peter gloomily; \"I'm so cram full o' manners now I'm ready ter bust, 'thout no dinner at all.\"  \"Me too,\" chimed in Cornelius.  \"Well, I'm sorry for yer both,\" rejoined Mrs. Ruggles sarcastically; \"if the 'mount o' manners yer've got on hand now troubles ye, you're dreadful easy hurt! Now, Sarah Maud, after dinner, about once in so often, you must git up 'n' say, 'I guess we'd better be goin';' 'n' if they say, 'Oh, no, set a while longer,' yer can set; but if they don't say nothin' you've got ter get up 'n' go.--Now hev yer got that int' yer head?\"  \"_About once in so often!_\" Could any words in the language be fraught with more terrible and wearing uncertainty?  \"Well,\" answered Sarah Maud mournfully, \"seems as if this whole dinner-party set right square on top o' me! Mebbe I could manage my own manners, but to manage nine mannerses is worse 'n staying to home!\"  \"Oh, don't fret,\" said her mother, good-naturedly, now that the lesson was over; \"I guess you'll git along. I wouldn't mind if folks would only say, 'Oh, childern will be childern;' but they won't. They'll say, 'Land o' Goodness, who fetched them childern up?'--It's quarter past five, 'n' yer can go now:--remember 'bout the hats,--don't all talk ter once,--Susan, lend yer han'k'chief ter Peory,--Peter, don't keep screwin' yer scarf-pin,--Cornelius, hold yer head up straight,--Sarah Maud, don't take yer eyes off o' Larry, 'n' Larry you keep holt o' Sarah Maud 'n' do jest as she says,--'n' whatever you do, all of yer, never forget for one second that yer mother was a McGrill.\"     VI  \"WHEN THE PIE WAS OPENED, THE BIRDS BEGAN TO SING!\"   The children went out of the back door quietly, and were presently lost to sight, Sarah Maud slipping and stumbling along absent-mindedly, as she recited rapidly under her breath, \"Itwassuchapleasantevenin'n'suchashortwalk, that wethoughtwe'dleaveourhatstohome.--Itwassucha pleasantevenin'n'suchashortwalk,thatwethoughtwe'd leaveourhatstohome.\"  Peter rang the door-bell, and presently a servant admitted them, and, whispering something in Sarah's ear, drew her downstairs into the kitchen. The other Ruggleses stood in horror-stricken groups as the door closed behind their commanding officer; but there was no time for reflection, for a voice from above was heard, saying, \"Come right up stairs, please!\"      \"Theirs not to make reply,     Theirs not to reason why,     Theirs but to do or die.\"  Accordingly they walked upstairs, and Elfrida, the nurse, ushered them into a room more splendid than anything they had ever seen. But, oh woe! where was Sarah Maud! and was it Fate that Mrs. Bird should say, at once, \"Did you lay your hats in the hall?\" Peter felt himself elected by circumstance the head of the family, and, casting one imploring look at tongue-tied Susan, standing next him, said huskily, \"It was so very pleasant--that--that\"----\"That we hadn't good hats enough to go 'round,\" put in little Susan, bravely, to help him out, and then froze with horror that the ill-fated words had slipped off her tongue.  However, Mrs. Bird said, pleasantly, \"Of course you wouldn't wear hats such a short distance--I forgot when I asked. Now will you come right in to Miss Carol's room? She is so anxious to see you.\"  Just then Sarah Maud came up the back stairs, so radiant with joy from her secret interview with the cook that Peter could have pinched her with a clear conscience; and Carol gave them a joyful welcome. \"But where is Baby Larry?\" she cried, looking over the group with searching eye. \"Didn't he come?\"  \"Larry! Larry!\" Good gracious, where was Larry? They were all sure that he had come in with them, for Susan remembered scolding him for tripping over the door-mat. Uncle Jack went into convulsions of laughter. \"Are you sure there were nine of you?\" he asked, merrily.  \"I think so, sir,\" said Peoria, timidly; \"but anyhow, there was Larry;\" and she showed signs of weeping.  \"Oh, well, cheer up!\" cried Uncle Jack. \"Probably he's not lost--only mislaid. I'll go and find him before you can say Jack Robinson!\"  \"I'll go, too, if you please, sir,\" said Sarah Maud, \"for it was my place to mind him, an' if he's lost I can't relish my vittles!\"  The other Ruggleses stood rooted to the floor. Was this a dinner-party, forsooth; and if so, why were such things ever spoken of as festive occasions?  Sarah Maud went out through the hall, calling, \"Larry! Larry!\" and without any interval of suspense a thin voice piped up from below, \"Here I be!\"  The truth was that Larry, being deserted by his natural guardian, dropped behind the rest, and wriggled into the hat-tree to wait for her, having no notion of walking unprotected into the jaws of a fashionable entertainment. Finding that she did not come, he tried to crawl from his refuge and call somebody, when--dark and dreadful ending to a tragic day--he found that he was too much intertwined with umbrellas and canes to move a single step. He was afraid to yell (when I have said this of Larry Ruggles I have pictured a state of helpless terror that ought to wring tears from every eye); and the sound of Sarah Maud's beloved voice, some seconds later, was like a strain of angel music in his ears. Uncle Jack dried his tears, carried him upstairs, and soon had him in breathless fits of laughter, while Carol so made the other Ruggleses forget themselves that they were presently talking like accomplished diners-out.  Carol's bed had been moved into the farthest corner of the room, and she was lying on the outside, dressed in a wonderful dressing-gown that looked like a fleecy cloud. Her golden hair fell in fluffy curls over her white forehead and neck, her cheeks flushed delicately, her eyes beamed with joy, and the children told their mother, afterwards, that she looked as beautiful as the angels in the picture books.  There was a great bustle behind a huge screen in another part of the room, and at half past five this was taken away, and the Christmas dinner-table stood revealed. What a wonderful sight it was to the poor little Ruggles children, who ate their sometimes scanty meals on the kitchen table! It blazed with tall colored candles, it gleamed with glass and silver, it blushed with flowers, it groaned with good things to eat; so it was not strange that the Ruggleses, forgetting altogether that their mother was a McGrill, shrieked in admiration of the fairy spectacle. But Larry's behavior was the most disgraceful, for he stood not upon the order of his going, but went at once for a high chair that pointed unmistakably to him, climbed up like a squirrel, gave a comprehensive look at the turkey, clapped his hands in ecstasy, rested his fat arms on the table, and cried with joy, \"I beat the hull lot o' yer!\" Carol laughed until she cried, giving orders, meanwhile,--\"Uncle Jack, please sit at the head, Sarah Maud at the foot, and that will leave four on each side; Mamma is going to help Elfrida, so that the children need not look after each other, but just have a good time.\"  A sprig of holly lay by each plate, and nothing would do but each little Ruggles must leave his seat and have it pinned on by Carol, and as each course was served, one of them pleaded to take something to her. There was hurrying to and fro, I can assure you, for it is quite a difficult matter to serve a Christmas dinner on the third floor of a great city house; but if it had been necessary to carry every dish up a rope ladder the servants would gladly have done so. There were turkey and chicken, with delicious gravy and stuffing, and there were half a dozen vegetables, with cranberry jelly, and celery, and pickles; and as for the way these delicacies were served, the Ruggleses never forgot it as long as they lived.  Peter nudged Kitty, who sat next him, and said, \"Look, will yer, ev'ry feller's got his own partic'lar butter; I s'pose that's to show you can eat that 'n' no more. No, it ain't either, for that pig of a Peory's just gettin' another helpin'!\"  \"Yes,\" whispered Kitty, \"an' the napkins is marked with big red letters! I wonder if that's so nobody'll nip 'em; an' oh, Peter, look at the pictures stickin' right on ter the dishes! Did yee ever?\"  \"The plums is all took out o' my cramb'ry sarse an' it's friz to a stiff jell'!\" whispered Peoria, in wild excitement.  \"Hi--yah! I got a wish-bone!\" sang Larry, regardless of Sarah Maud's frown; after which she asked to have his seat changed, giving as excuse that he \"gen'ally set beside her, an' would feel strange;\" the true reason being that she desired to kick him gently, under the table, whenever he passed what might be termed \"the McGrill line.\"  \"I declare to goodness,\" murmured Susan, on the other side, \"there's so much to look at I can't scarcely eat nothin'!\"  \"Bet yer life I can!\" said Peter, who had kept one servant busily employed ever since he sat down; for, luckily, no one was asked by Uncle Jack whether he would have a second helping, but the dishes were quietly passed under their noses, and not a single Ruggles refused anything that was offered him, even unto the seventh time.  Then, when Carol and Uncle Jack perceived that more turkey was a physical impossibility, the meats were taken off and the dessert was brought in--a dessert that would have frightened a strong man after such a dinner as had preceded it. Not so the Ruggleses--for a strong man is nothing to a small boy--and they kindled to the dessert as if the turkey had been a dream and the six vegetables an optical delusion. There were plum-pudding, mince-pie, and ice-cream; and there were nuts, and raisins, and oranges. Kitty chose ice-cream, explaining that she knew it \"by sight, though she hadn't never tasted none;\" but all the rest "]]]
