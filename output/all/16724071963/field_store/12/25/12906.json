I am the Signore Student's valet, his gardener, and at times his chef. I grease his automobile, which is a very small chug-chug, but respectable, and I clean his shoes--when I can catch him with them off. I am valuable to him and for three years he has paid me fair wages.\"  \"Is this a big estate?\" asked Mary Louise.  \"Enormous, Signorina. It comprises three acres!\"  \"And where is the house?\"  \"Just over the hill, yonder, Signore.  \"Does the student Americano live here all alone?\"  \"With his daughter, who is the Signorina Alora.\"  \"Oh; there is a daughter, then? And you say they are Americans?\"  \"Surely, Signorina. Who else would pay the great price for this estate for three years? The land pays nothing back--a few oranges; some grapes, when they are cared for; a handful of almonds and olives. And there is a servant besides myself, my niece Leona, who is housemaid and assists the young lady.\"  \"This sounds promising,\" said Mary Louise, turning to her grandfather. \"Suppose we go up to the house? Are the people at home, Silvio?--the Signore Student and his daughter?\"  The man reflected, leaning on his hoe.  \"I think they are both at the mansion, Signorina, although the student Americano may not yet have returned from Sorrento. The road to the mansion is beyond the hill, on the other side of the estate, so I am not sure the Signore Student has returned. But you will find the Signorina Alora there, if you decide to venture on. But perhaps you are the friends of my employer and his daughter?\"  \"What is his name?\" asked Colonel Hathaway.  \"It is Jones. The American saying is Mister Jason Jones, but here he is only called the Signore Student Americano.\"  \"Why?\" asked Mary Louise.  \"Because his occupation is reading. He does nothing else. Always there is a book in his hand and always he is thinking of the things he reads. He does not often speak, even to his daughter; he does not have friends who visit him. If you should call at the mansion, then you will be the first people who have done so for three years.\"  There was something in this report--in the manner of the man as well as his words--that caused the strangers to hesitate. The description of \"the Student\" led them to suspect he was a recluse who might not welcome them cordially, but Mary Louise reflected that there was a daughter and decided that any American girl shut up on this three-acre \"estate\" for three years would be glad to meet another American girl. So she said abruptly:  \"Come on, Gran'pa Jim. Let's call. It is possible that Americans will have something better in the larder than cakes and goat's milk.\"  The hilltop was reached sooner than they expected, and in a little vale was the old mansion--a really attractive vine-clad villa that might have stood a century or so. It was not very big, but there were numerous outbuildings which rendered the size of the house proper unimportant. As Mary Louise and her grandfather drew nearer they discovered a charming flower garden, carefully tended, and were not surprised to find a young girl bending over a rosebush.    CHAPTER VIII MARY LOUISE MEETS ALORA  The two stood motionless a moment, looking at the girl, and Mary Louise marked the graceful figure and attractive features with real delight. The Signorina Alora, as the man had called her, was nearly her own age--fifteen, Mary Louise judged her to be--and her golden hair and fair complexion proclaimed her an American. But now the girl's quick ears had detected presence, and she looked up with a startled expression, half fearful and half shy, and turned as if to fly. But in the next moment she had collected herself and advanced with hesitating steps to meet them.  \"Pardon our intrusion,\" said Colonel Hathaway, raising his hat. \"Our carriage broke down on the Amalfi road, a little while ago, and our driver has gone to Positano for a new wheel. Meantime we were exploring our surroundings and stumbled upon the path leading to this spot. Forgive the trespass, if you will, and allow me to present my granddaughter, Mary Louise Burrows. I am Colonel James Hathaway, of New York, although we usually reside at a little town called Dorfield.\"  The girl's bow was stiff and awkward. She blushed in an embarrassed way as she replied:  \"I am Alora Jones, sir, and am living here for a time with my father, Jason Jones. We, also, are Americans; at least, we used to be.\"  \"Then doubtless you are yet,\" responded the Colonel, with a smile. \"May we pay our respects to your father?\"  \"He--he is not home yet,\" she answered more embarrassed than before. \"He went to Sorrento for some books, this morning, and has not yet returned. But perhaps he will be back soon,\" she added, seeming to ponder the matter. \"Will you not come in and--and have some refreshment? In my father's absence I--I am glad to--welcome you.\"  She glanced shyly at Mary Louise, as if to implore her to forgive any seeming lack of hospitality and accept her coldly worded invitation. No one could look at Mary Louise without gaining confidence and the friendly smile and warm handclasp made Alora feel instantly that here was a girl who would prove congenial under any circumstances. Really, it would not take them long to become friends, and poor Alora had no girl friends whatever.  She led them into a cool and comfortable living room and called to Leona to fetch tea and biscuits.  \"We are entirely shut in, here,\" she explained. \"It seems to me worse than a convent, for there I would see other girls while here I see no one but the servants--and my father,\" as an afterthought, \"year in and year out.\"  \"It's a pretty place,\" declared Mary Louise cheerfully.  \"But it's an awfully dreary place, too, and sometimes I feel that I'd like to run away--if I knew where to go,\" said Alora frankly.  \"You have lived here three years?\" asked Colonel Hathaway.  \"Yes. We left New York more than four years ago and traveled a year in different places, always stopping at the little towns, where there is not much to interest one. Then my father found this place and rented it, and here we've stayed--I can't say 'lived'--ever since. I get along pretty well in the daytime, with my flowers and the chickens to tend, but the evenings are horribly lonely. Sometimes I feel that I shall go mad.\"  Mary Louise marked her wild look and excited manner and her heart went out in sympathy to the lonely girl. Colonel Hathaway, too, intuitively recognized Alora's plaint as a human cry for help, and did not need to guess the explanation. The man in the vineyard had called her father \"the Student\" and said he was a reserved man and never was seen without a book in his hand. This would mean that he was not companionable and Alora's protest plainly indicated that her father devoted small time, if any, to the cultivation of his daughter's society.  \"I suppose,\" remarked the old gentleman, \"that Mr. Jones is so immersed in his studies that he forgets his daughter lacks society am amusement.\"  Mary Louise caught the slight, scornful smile that for a moment curled Alora's lips. But the girl replied very seriously:  \"My father dislikes society. I believe he would be quite content to live in this little cooped-up place forever and see no one but the servants, to whom he seldom speaks. Also, he ignores me, and I am glad he does. But before my mother died,\" her voice breaking a little, \"I was greatly loved and petted, and I can't get used to the change. I ought not to say this to strangers, I know, but I am very lonely and unhappy, because--because my father is so different from what my mother was.\"  Mary Louise was holding her trembling hand now and stroking it sympathetically.  \"Tell us about your mother,\" she said softly. \"Is it long since you lost her?\"  \"More than four years,\" returned Alora. \"I was her constant companion and she taught me to love art and music and such things, for art was her hobby. I did not know my father in those days, you see, for--for-- they did not live together. But in her last illness mamma sent for him and made him my guardian. My mother said that my father would love me, but she must have misjudged him.\"  Colonel Hathaway had listened with interest.  \"Tell me your mother's name,\" said he.  \"She was Mrs. Antoinette Seaver Jones, and--\"  \"Indeed!\" exclaimed the Colonel. \"Why, I knew Antoinette Seaver before she married, and a more beautiful and cultured woman I never met. Her father, Captain Seaver, was my friend, and I met his daughter several times, both at his mining camp and in the city. So you see, my dear, we must be friends.\"  Alora's eyes fairly glistened with delight and Mary Louise was as pleased as she was surprised.  \"Of course we're friends!\" she cried, pressing the girl's hand, \"and isn't it queer we have come together in this singular manner? In a foreign country! And just because our carriage-wheel happened to break.\"  \"I thought your mother married an artist,\" said Mary Louise's grandfather, reflectively.  \"She did. At least, she _thought_ Jason Jones was an artist,\" answered Alora with bitter emphasis. \"But he was, in fact, a mere dauber. He became discouraged in his attempts to paint and soon after he took me to New York he destroyed all his work--really, it was dreadful!--and since then he has never touched a brush.\"  \"That is strange,\" mused the Colonel. \"I once saw a landscape by Jason Jones that was considered a fine conception, skillfully executed. That was the opinion of so good a judge as Captain Seaver himself. Therefore, for some reason the man's genius must have forsaken him.\"  \"I think that is true,\" agreed Alora, \"for my mother's estimate of art was undoubtedly correct. I have read somewhere that discouragement sometimes destroys one's talent, though in after years, with proper impulse, it may return with added strength. In my father's case,\" she explained, \"he was not able to sell his work--and no wonder. So now he does nothing at all but read,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24578"],["title","Mary Louise Solves a Mystery (#8)"],["body"," even that doesn't seem to amuse him much.\"  The Colonel had now remembered that Antoinette Seaver Jones was a woman of great wealth, and therefore her daughter must be an heiress. What a shame to keep the girl hidden in this out-of-the-way place, when she should be preparing to assume an important position in the world.  \"May I ask your age, my dear?\" he said.  \"I am fifteen, sir,\" replied Alora.  \"And your father is the guardian of your fortune?\"  \"Yes; by my mother's wish.\"  \"I suppose you are receiving proper instruction?\"  \"None at all, sir. Since I have been in my father's care I have had no instruction whatever. That isn't right, is it?\"  \"What isn't right?\" demanded a gruff voice, and all three turned to find Jason Jones standing in the doorway.    CHAPTER IX MARY LOUISE SCENTS A MYSTERY  Colonel Hathaway instantly rose.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said he. \"I am Colonel James Hathaway, an American, and this is my granddaughter, Mary Louise Burrows. Our carriage met with an accident on the main road below and we wandered in here while waiting for repairs and chanced to meet your daughter. You are Mr. Jones, I believe?\"  He nodded, still standing in his place and regarding his visitors with unconcealed suspicion. Under his arm he held several books.  \"Who informed you that I was living here?\" he demanded.  \"I was wholly unaware of the fact,\" said the Colonel, stiffly. \"I did not know you were in Italy. I did not know such an important person existed, strange to say, although I can remember that an artist named Jason Jones once married Antoinette Seaver, the daughter of my old friend Captain Robert Seaver.\"  \"Oh, you remember that, do you?\"  \"This is the first time I have had the distinguished honor of meeting you, sir, and I trust it will be the last time.\"  \"That's all right,\" said Jason Jones, more cordially. \"I can't see that it's any of my affair, either way.\"  \"We have been making the acquaintance of Tony Seaver's daughter, Miss Alora Jones, in your absence. But we will not intrude farther, Mr. Jones. Come, Mary Louise.\"  \"Oh, don't go!\" pleaded Alora, catching Mary Louise's arm. And just then Leona entered with the tea and biscuits.  \"Sit down, man,\" said Jason Jones in a less aggressive tone. \"I've no objection to your coming here, under the circumstances, and you are our first visitors in three years. That's often enough, but now that you are here, make yourself at home. What's happening over in America? Have you been there lately?\"  He laid his books on a table and sat down. But after that one speech, which he perhaps considered conciliatory, he remained glum and allowed the others to do the talking.  Colonel Hathaway had stayed because he noted the leading look in Mary Louise's eyes. He was himself interested in Alora and indignant over her evident neglect. For her sake he would bear the insolence of his host, an insolence he recognized as characteristic of the man.  Alora, in her father's presence, lost her fluent speech and no longer dared mention personal matters to her guests. Both Mary Louise and her grandfather tried to lead Alora and Jason Jones to speak of themselves--of their life and future plans--but the man evaded direct answers and the girl had suddenly become silent and reserved.  Finally, however, Mary Louise had an idea.  \"We are bound for Sorrento,\" said she, \"where we intend to stay a week at the Hotel Vittoria. Will you let Alora come to us for ever Sunday, as our guest? We will drive here and get her the day after to-morrow-- that's Saturday, you know--and fetch her home on Monday.\"  \"No,\" said Jason Jones.  \"Oh, why not, father?\" pleaded the girl.  \"You've no fit clothes. I don't want you hanging around Sorrento,\" he replied.  \"It will be a nice change for your daughter and it will give us much pleasure to entertain her,\" said Mary Louise.  \"It's a capital idea,\" declared the Colonel positively, and looking the other man straight in the eye he added: \"I am sure you will withdraw your objections, Mr. Jones.\"  The man dropped his eyes, frowning. But presently he said to Alora:  \"Go, if you want to. But keep out of the town. Don't leave the hotel grounds.\"  \"Why not?\" asked his daughter in a defiant tone.  \"It's not safe. I know Sorrento, and these rascally Italians would be glad to steal you, if they had the chance, and then blackmail me a ransom.\"  Mary Louise laughed.  \"What a fine adventure that would be!\" she exclaimed. \"But we will promise to guard Alora and keep her from the clutches of bandits. I didn't know there were any left in Italy.\"  \"To get rid of them you'd have to depopulate the country,\" said Jason Jones. \"It is no laughing matter, young woman, and--my daughter is somewhat valuable.\"    CHAPTER X MERE SPECULATION  The driver returned with the wheel. It fitted the axle but was some two or three inches larger in diameter than the other rear wheel and, moreover, it was flat on one side, so that when they started to conclude their journey the motion of the carriage was something startling--a \"rock-a-bye baby ride\" Mary Louise called it.  But the wheels turned and the carriage progressed and when they were well on their way the girl said:  \"What do you think of that man, Gran'pa Jim?\"  \"Do you mean Alora's father, Jason Jones?\"  \"Yes, of course.\"  \"I am surprised at two things,\" said the old Colonel. \"First, it is curious that Tony Seaver, a rarely cultured woman, should have married such a man, and again it is amazing that she should have confided her daughter and her fortune to his care.\"  \"Do you know,\" observed Mary Louise, sliding closer to him and dropping her voice, although there was absolutely no chance of being overheard, \"I scent a mystery in that family, Gran'pa Jim!\"  \"That seems to be one of your regular diversions--to scent mysteries,\" he replied. \"And usually, my dear, the suspicion is unwarranted. The most commonplace people frequently impress you with the idea that they are other than what they seem, are leading double lives, or are endeavoring to conceal some irregularity of conduct. You've a faculty of reading the natures and characteristics of strangers by studying their eyes, their facial expressions and their oddities of demeanor, which is interesting psychologically but too often----\"  \"You are unjust, Gran'pa!\" declared Mary Louise indignantly. \"Didn't you yourself say there are two curious and surprising things about this man Jones?\"  \"Not exactly. I said it was curious and astonishing that Antoinette Seaver should have trusted so fully a man who impresses me as a churl. His own child, little Alora, appears to dislike and even to despise him, and----\"  \"There!\" cried Mary Louise. \"I'm vindicated. Your observations fully justify my remark that there's a mystery in that family. Did you notice the books he brought home and laid upon the table?\"  \"No,\" said Colonel Hathaway, rather bewildered.  \"They were novels by Marie Correlli, H. G. Wells and O. Henry. A student? Then a student of modern novels, a man who reads and reads to keep his mind from dwelling on past history. He is a disappointed artist, to begin with.\"  \"That is certainly odd,\" rejoined the old gentleman, reflectively. \"The one picture I ever saw by Jason Jones was certainly good. I remember that once when I was lunching with Bob Seaver--that was Antoinette's father, you know--he told me his daughter was interested in a young artist of exceptional talent, and he took me to a gallery to show me what this man could do. I am not an art critic, as you are aware, my dear, but this landscape of Jason Jones appealed to me as delightful. Captain Bob knew art, and so did Antoinette, so it is evident that Jones _could_ paint, but for some reason became dissatisfied with his work and abandoned it. Perhaps his ambition was too lofty for human skill to realize, yet nothing less would content him.\"  Mary Louise sat silent for a while. Then she asked:  \"Did Jason Jones impress you as a man capable of a great ambition? Would you guess him an artist who had once accomplished admirable things?\"  \"Artists are always peculiar,\" stated her grandfather. \"They must be temperamental in order to be artists, and temperaments differ widely. Had I not known something of Jason Jones' history I might have felt, on making his acquaintance to-day, that he is not an ordinary man. For, gruff and churlish though he proved, it is undeniable that he has selected a charming and retired spot in which to live----\"  \"Or to hide,\" she interrupted.  \"Or that, with considerable wealth at his command, he lives simply and unostentatiously, enjoying nature's choice gifts and content with the simple life he leads, with only the society of his young daughter.\"  \"Whom he neglects and refuses to educate properly,\" declared the girl. \"What makes you think he is wealthy?\"  \"I know that Antoinette made millions, after her father died, from the mines. By current report she retired and invested her money wisely, in sound securities, which accords with her excellent business reputation. Her daughter not being of age--let me see: she must have been but eleven when her mother passed away--there would be a guardian appointed for the heiress, and Alora told us that it was her mother's wish that her father act as her guardian. So the conclusion is evident that Mr. Jones has a large income at his command.\"  \"All the more reason he should be generous, but he isn't spending much of it,\" said Mary Louise.  \"No; he is probably living simply in order that his daughter's fortune may increase during the years of her minority. That is a point in his favor, you must admit.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" asserted the young girl, \"I think there is something wrong in the Jones family. It isn't due to Alora; she's a dear little thing, wild and untamed but very lovable, I'm sure; so the fault must lie with her boorish father. Allowing that once he was a big man, something has mysteriously soured him and rendered his life hateful not only to himself but to all around him."]]]
