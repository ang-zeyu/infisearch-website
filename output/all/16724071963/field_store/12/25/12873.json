If I had been guided by my judgment alone it is not probable that these notes of the debates in the Conference, held upon the invitation of Virginia, at Washington, in the month of February, 1861, would have been made public. From the commencement of its sessions, a portion of the members were in favor of the daily publication of the proceedings. I was disposed to go farther and have the sessions open to the public; but this proposition was opposed by a large majority. Strong reasons were urged for excluding the multitude which in the excitement of the time would have thronged the hall wherein the Conference held its sessions. But these reasons did not apply to the publication of the debates, and a considerable minority were strongly of opinion that the people should be informed daily, of the votes and remarks of their representatives in that body.  I commenced taking notes on the first day of the session. For the first few days, and until the reports were presented from the general committee, there was but little discussion, and that related to questions incidental to the general subject. On the 15th of February, and before the committee reported, Mr. ORTH offered a resolution authorizing the admission of reporters, which, after some discussion, by a close vote was laid upon the table. On the 18th, finding the labor of taking notes greater than I had anticipated, and desiring that a complete record should be preserved; I introduced a resolution providing for the appointment of an official stenographer, who should report the proceedings and hold them subject to the order of the Conference. I urged the adoption of this resolution as strenuously as was proper, but the feeling of the majority appeared to be still adverse to its passage, and it shared the fate of its predecessor. I then revised the notes already taken, and finding them more complete than I had anticipated, determined to make as accurate a report as I was able of the general discussion. I could not then anticipate whether such a report would be useful to the country or not; but I thought if the Conference should propose amendments to the Constitution, and these should be ultimately submitted to the States for adoption, a knowledge of the motives and reasons which influenced the action of the Conference as well as the construction which the members gave to the propositions themselves, might become of as great importance as the same subjects were in the convention which framed the present Constitution. I attended every session of the Conference, and, so far as my strength would permit, made as full and accurate notes as I could, both of the action of the Conference and the observations of its members.  These notes were carefully examined and revised immediately after the close of each daily session. After the passage of the resolution introduced by Mr. BARRINGER, removing the injunction of secrecy and authorizing their publication, I determined to write them out for the press. I was engaged in this work when the rebellion commenced, and was shortly after called to the performance of the duties of an official position, which for many months left me no leisure for other employments.  My notes were then laid aside. As it was known by every member of the Conference that I had taken them, I was often pressed to permit selections from them to be made. These requests I invariably declined, as I desired the publication, if made at all, to be entire, as well as accurate. As time passed, these appeals became more frequent and pressing, and claims were made in relation to the course of several of the members which could only be sustained or refuted by a publication of their remarks. At length I was earnestly requested to write out one of these speeches, and after some weeks of delay consented to do so.  After the publication of this speech, which took place about the time of the fall elections of 1863, previous to which the action of the Conference had been much discussed, the desire to see a full report of the proceedings of that body appeared to be excited anew. Letters and personal interviews upon this subject became very numerous. I finally determined to take the advice of a number of gentlemen who were prominent in the convention and the country, as to the propriety of yielding to this desire, and to be guided by it. I did so, and found among them a remarkable unanimity of expression in favor of making the history of the Conference public.  When this question was settled, I desired to avail myself of every opportunity to secure the highest degree of accuracy and fidelity. I addressed notes to such of the members as were accessible, asking them to transmit to me such memoranda of the proceedings of the Conference as they had preserved. The response to these letters was very gratifying; not because the materials furnished were very full, but because so general a purpose was shown by all the members thus addressed, to furnish me every facility and aid in their power.  I have found much difficulty in determining what control each member ought to be permitted to exercise over his own remarks. The most agreeable course to me would have been, to have written out each speech and submitted it to its author for correction or revision; but to this there was a decisive objection. It would have depreciated, if not destroyed, the accuracy of the report. Although I do not believe that any gentleman would have been tempted to change the tenor of his remarks by subsequent events, the view of the public might not have been so charitable.  I have therefore made my own notes the standard of authority, and have admitted nothing into the report which has not been justified by them aided by my own recollection. The manuscript has not been changed or added to, except by my own hands. The few instances in which I have availed myself of the materials furnished by others, are distinctly stated either in the notes or the appendix.  During the sessions of the Conference I was able to secure but little practical assistance from the members. Although many of them desired that my purpose should be accomplished, and some were taking brief and general notes, I soon discovered that an accurate report of a speech required an amount of labor and a degree of attention to the subject, which few gentlemen were inclined to give. The work, therefore, was thrown almost exclusively upon myself. Some idea of its amount and severity may be formed when it is stated, that the sessions usually commenced at about ten o'clock in the morning, and with a brief intermission were continued late in the evening, in one instance as late as the hour of two o'clock, A.M. The necessity of these long daily sessions, arose from the fact, that the Congress then in existence terminated on the fourth of March, and but few days remained in which to discuss and perfect the report, and to submit it to that body for its action.  I do not claim to have furnished a _verbatim_ report of the speeches delivered in the Conference of 1861, but I insist that I have given an accurate account of all its official proceedings, and the substance of the remarks made in the course of those proceedings. I think, also, that I have preserved nearly all the propositions made in the course of the debate, and generally have presented the ideas in the very language used. The gentlemen who have critically examined the report, all concur upon the question of its general accuracy, and I am content in this respect to rely upon their testimony.  I have suggested these considerations simply by way of explanation, and not for the purpose of avoiding criticism. I have endeavored to follow, so far as was in my power, the example of the illustrious Reporter of the Constitutional Convention of 1787; and while my notes lack the beauty and felicity which characterize his, I trust they are not less full and accurate. I submit them to the country as the best contribution which I can make to its history, at a most important and interesting period of our national existence.  The three short years which have passed since the Conference of 1861, have witnessed singular vicissitudes among its members. Many of them have entered into the military or civil service of the country, or of the rebellion which it was the avowed purpose of some members of that Conference to nourish into vigorous life. Death, also, has been busy with the roll. BALDWIN, BRONSON, SMITH, WOLCOTT, TYLER, and CLAY, are no more. ZOLLICOFFER fell at the head of a rebel army. HACKLEMAN sealed with his blood his devotion to the principles he advocated upon the field of Corinth, and now, while I am writing these pages in a morning of beautiful spring, when tree, and shrub, and grass, and flower, are bursting into life and beauty; from the roar of cannon, the rattle of musketry, and the deadly storm of lead and iron, which bearing destruction upon"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24561"],["title","A Report of the Debates and Proceedings in the Secret Sessions of the Conference (#1)"],["body","wings is waking the echoes of the \"Wilderness,\" comes the mournful tidings that WADSWORTH has fallen. In that Conference or in the world, there was never a purer or a more ardent patriot. Those of us who were associated with him politically, had learned to love and respect him. His opponents admired his unflinching devotion to his country, and his manly frankness and candor. He was the type of a true American, able, unselfish, prudent, unambitious, and good. Other pens will do justice to his memory, but I thought as I heard the last account of him alive, as he lay within the rebel lines, his face wearing that calm serenity which grew more beautiful the nearer death approached, after having given so abundantly of his goods, now yielding his life to his country in the hour of her trial, that hereafter the good and true men of the nation would emulate the illustrious example of his patriotism, and would prize the blessings of a free government the more highly, as they remembered that it could only be maintained and perpetuated by such expensive sacrifices.  L.E.C.  _May_, 1864.     PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCE,  Washington, D.C.   MONDAY, _February 4th, 1861._  Commissioners representing a number of the States, assembled at Willard's Hall, in the City of Washington, D.C., on the fourth day of February, A.D. 1861, at 12 o'clock M., in pursuance of the following preamble and resolutions, adopted by the General Assembly of the State of Virginia, on the nineteenth day of January, A.D. 1861:       _Whereas_, It is the deliberate opinion of the General      Assembly of Virginia, that unless the unhappy controversy      which now divides the States of this confederacy, shall be      satisfactorily adjusted, a permanent dissolution of Union is      inevitable; and the General Assembly, representing the      wishes of the people of the commonwealth, is desirous of      employing every reasonable means to avert so dire a      calamity, and determined to make a final effort to restore      the Union and the Constitution, in the spirit in which they      were established by the fathers of the Republic: Therefore,       _Resolved_, That on behalf of the commonwealth of Virginia,      an invitation is hereby extended to all such States, whether      slaveholding or non-slaveholding, as are willing to unite      with Virginia in an earnest effort to adjust the present      unhappy controversies, in the spirit in which the      Constitution was originally formed, and consistently with      its principles, so as to afford to the people of the      slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the security of      their rights, to appoint commissioners to meet on the fourth      day of February next, in the City of Washington, similar      commissioners appointed by Virginia, to consider, and if      practicable, agree upon some suitable adjustment.       _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER, WILLIAM C. RIVES,      Judge JOHN W. BROCKENBROUGH, GEORGE W. SUMMERS, and JAMES A.      SEDDON are hereby appointed commissioners, whose duty it      shall be to repair to the City of Washington, on the day      designated in the foregoing resolution, to meet such      commissioners as may be appointed by any of said States, in      accordance with the foregoing resolution.       _Resolved_, That if said commissioners, after full and free      conference, shall agree upon any plan of adjustment      requiring amendments to the Federal Constitution, for the      further security of the rights of the people of the      slaveholding States, they be requested to communicate the      proposed amendments to Congress, for the purpose of having      the same submitted by that body, according to the forms of      the Constitution, to the several States for ratification.       _Resolved_, That if said commissioners cannot agree on such      adjustment, or if agreeing, Congress shall refuse to submit      for ratification, such amendments as may be proposed, then      the commissioners of this State shall immediately      communicate the result to the executive of this      commonwealth, to be by him laid before the convention of the      people of Virginia and the General Assembly: _Provided_,      That the said commissioners be subject at all times to the      control of the General Assembly, or if in session, to that      of the State convention.       _Resolved_, That in the opinion of the General Assembly of      Virginia, the propositions embraced in the resolutions      presented to the Senate of the United States by the Hon.      JOHN J. CRITTENDEN, so modified as that the first article      proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United      States, shall apply to all the territory of the United      States now held or hereafter acquired south of latitude      thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes, and provide that      slavery of the African race shall be effectually protected      as property therein during the continuance of the      territorial government, and the fourth article shall secure      to the owners of slaves the right of transit with their      slaves between and through the non-slaveholding States and      territories, constitute the basis of such an adjustment of      the unhappy controversy which now divides the States of this      confederacy, as would be accepted by the people of this      commonwealth.       _Resolved_, That ex-President JOHN TYLER is hereby      appointed, by the concurrent vote of each branch of the      General Assembly, a commissioner to the President of the      United States, and Judge JOHN ROBERTSON is hereby appointed,      by a like vote, a commissioner to the State of South      Carolina, and the other States that have seceded or shall      secede, with instructions respectfully to request the      President of the United States and authorities of such      States to agree to abstain, pending the proceedings      contemplated by the action of this General Assembly, from      any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms      between the States and the Government of the United States.       _Resolved_, That copies of the foregoing resolutions be      forthwith telegraphed to the executives of the several      States, and also to the President of the United States, and      the Governor be requested to inform, without delay, the      commissioners of their appointment by the foregoing      resolutions.       [A copy from the rolls.]       WM. F. GORDON, JR.,        _C.H.D. and K.R. of Va._  The Conference was called to order by Mr. MOREHEAD, of Kentucky, who proposed the name of the honorable JOHN C. WRIGHT, of Ohio, as temporary Chairman.  The motion of Mr. MOREHEAD was unanimously adopted.  Mr. WRIGHT was conducted to the Chair by Mr. MEREDITH, of Pennsylvania, and Mr. CHASE, of Ohio, and proceeded to address the Conference as follows:  My warmest thanks are due to you, Gentlemen, for the undeserved honor which you have conferred upon me, in selecting me for the purpose of temporarily presiding over your deliberations. We have come together to secure a common and at the same time a most important object--to agree if we can upon some plan for adjusting the unhappy differences which distract the country, which will be satisfactory to ourselves and those we represent. We have assembled as friends, as brothers, each, I doubt not, animated by the most friendly sentiments.  If we enter upon, and with these sentiments carry through, a patient examination of the difficulties which now surround the Government, the result will be, it must be, a success, earnestly hoped for by every lover of his country; a result which will establish the Union according to the spirit of the Constitution.  For myself, I may say that I have come here with the earnest purpose of doing justice to all sections of the Union. I will hear with a patient and impartial mind all that may be said in favor of, or against such amendments of the Constitution as may be proposed. Such of them as will give to the Government permanence, strength, and stability, as will tend to secure to any State, or any number of States, the quiet and unmolested enjoyment of their rights under it, shall receive my cordial support. My confidence in republican institutions, in the capacity of the people for self-government, has been increased with every year of a life which has been protracted beyond the term usually allotted to man. That life is now drawing to a close, and I hope, when it ends, I may leave the Government more firmly established in the affections of my countrymen than it ever was before. To this end I have always labored, and shall continue to labor while I live. I pray GOD that He will be with us during our deliberations, and that He may guide them to a happy and wise conclusion.  Mr. BENJAMIN C. HOWARD, a commissioner from the State of Maryland, was unanimously appointed temporary Secretary.  The Roll of the States was then called over, and commissioners representing the following were found to be present:  New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana.  Mr. PRICE, of New Jersey:--I am informed that a number of Reporters for the press are at the door of the hall, desiring admittance to this Conference, for the purpose of reporting our proceedings. Whatever may be the ultimate action of the Conference in this respect, I can see no objection to the admission of reporters to-day, for our business will relate wholly to organization. I hope we shall admit them, and I make that motion.  Mr. SEDDON, of Virginia:--I hope this motion will not prevail. I do not see that any good can possibly come of giving publicity now, to our proceedings. On the contrary, in the present excited condition of the country, I can see how much harm might result from that publicity. It is not unlikely that wide differences of opinion will be found to exist"]]]
