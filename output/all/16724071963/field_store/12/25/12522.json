The sensible reason for these courtship regulations was \"to prevent young folk from intangling themselves by rash and inconsiderate contracts of maridge.\" The Governor of Plymouth colony, Thomas Prence, did not hesitate to drag his daughter's love affairs before the public, in 1660, by prosecuting Arthur Howland for \"disorderly and unrighteously endeavouring to gain the affections of Mistress Elizabeth Prence.\" The unrighteous lover was fined Â£5. Seven years later, patient Arthur, who would not \"refrain and desist,\" was again fined the same amount; but love prevailed over law, and he triumphantly married his fair Elizabeth a few months later. The marriage of a daughter with an unwelcome swain was also often prohibited by will, \"not to suffer her to be circumvented and cast away upon a swaggering gentleman.\"  On the other hand, an engagement of marriage once having been permitted, the father could not recklessly or unreasonably interfere to break off the contract. Many court records prove that colonial lovers promptly resented by legal action any attempt of parents to bring to an end a sanctioned love affair. Richard Taylor so sued, and for such cause, Ruth Whieldon's father in Plymouth in 1661; while another ungallant swain is said to have sued the maid's father for the loss of time spent in courting. Breach of promise cases were brought against women by disappointed men who had been \"shabbed\" (as jilting was called in some parts of New England), as well as by deserted women against men.  But sly Puritan maids found a way to circumvent and outwit Puritan law makers, and to prevent their unsanctioned lovers from being punished, too. Hear the craft of Sarah Tuttle. On May day in New Haven, in 1660, she went to the house of a neighbor, Dame Murline, to get some thread. Some very loud jokes were exchanged between Sarah and her friends Maria and Susan Murline--so loud, in fact, that Dame Murline testified in court that it \"much distressed her and put her in a sore strait.\" In the midst of all this doubtful fun Jacob Murline entered, and seizing Sarah's gloves, demanded the centuries old forfeit of a kiss. \"Wherupon,\" writes the scandalized Puritan chronicler, \"they sat down together; his arm being about her; and her arm upon his shoulder or about his neck; and hee kissed her, and shee kissed him, or they kissed one another, continuing in this posture about half an hour, as Maria and Susan testified.\" Goodman Tuttle, who was a man of dignity and importance, angrily brought suit against Jacob for inveigling his daughter's affections; \"but Sarah being asked in court if Jacob inveagled her, said No.\" This of course prevented any rendering of judgment against the unauthorized kissing by Jacob, and he escaped the severe punishment of his offence. But the outraged and baffled court fined Sarah, and gave her a severe lecture, calling her with justice a \"Bould Virgin.\" She at the end, demurely and piously answered that \"She hoped God would help her to carry it Better for time to come.\" And doubtless she did carry it better; for at the end of two years, this bold virgin's fine for unruly behavior being still unpaid, half of it was remitted.  Of the etiquette, the pleasures, the exigencies of colonial \"courtship in high life,\" let one of the actors speak for himself through the pages of his diary. Judge Sewall's first wife was Hannah Hull, the only daughter of Captain Hull of Pine Tree Shilling fame. She received as her dowry her weight in silver shillings. Of her wooing we know naught save the charming imaginary story told us by Hawthorne. The Judge's only record is this:       \"Mrs. Hannah Hull saw me when I took my Degree and set her      affection on me though I knew nothing of it till after our      Marriage.\"  She lived with him forty-three years, bore him seven sons and seven daughters, and died on the 19th day of October, 1717.  Of course, though the Judge was sixty-six years old, he would marry again. Like a true Puritan he despised an unmarried life, and on the 6th day of February he made this naive entry in his diary: \"Wandering in my mind whether to live a Married or a Single Life.\" Ere that date he had begun to take notice. He had called more than once on Widow Ruggles, and had had Widow Gill to dine with him; had looked critically at Widow Emery, and noted that Widow Tilley was absent from meeting; and he had gazed admiringly at Widow Winthrop in \"her sley,\" and he had visited and counseled and consoled her ere his wife had been two months dead, and had given her a few suitable tokens of his awakening affection such as \"Smoking Flax Inflamed,\" \"The Jewish Children of Berlin,\" and \"My Small Vial of Tears;\" so he had \"wandered\" in the flesh as well as in the mind.  Such an array of widows! Boston fairly blossomed with widows, the widows of all the \"true New England men\" whose wills Sewall had drawn up, whose dying bedsides he had blessed and harassed with his prayers, whose bodies he had borne to the grave, whose funeral gloves and scarves and rings he had received and apprized, and whose estates he had settled. Over this sombre flower-bed of black garbed widows, these hardy perennials, did this aged Puritan butterfly amorously hover, loth to settle, tasting each solemn sweet, calculating the richness of the soil in which each was planted, gauging the golden promise of fruit, and perhaps longing for the whole garden of full-blown blossoms. \"Antient maides\" were held in little esteem by him; not one thornback is on his list.  Not only did he look and wander, but all his friends and neighbors arose and began to suggest and search for a suitable wife for him, with as officious alacrity as if he needed help, which he certainly did not. In March Madam Henchman strongly recommended to him \"Madam Winthrop, the Major General's widow.\" This recommendation was very sweet to the widower, who had turned his eyes with such special approval on this special widow, and further and warm encouragement came quickly.       \"Deacon Marion comes to me, sits with me a great while in the      evening; after a great deal of Discourse about his Courtship He      told me the Olivers said they wish'd I would court their Aunt. I      said little, but said 'twas not five Moneths since I buried my dear      Wife. Had said before 'twas hard to know whether to marry again or      no or whom to marry.\"  The Olivers' aunt was Madam Winthrop. It would seem somewhat presumptuous and officious for nieces and nephews to suggest courtship, when there were grown up Winthrop children who might dislike the marriage, but in those days everyone meddled in love affairs; to quote Pope: \"Marriage was the theme on which they all declaimed.\" The Judge gossiped publicly about his intentions. He writes: \"They had laid one out for me, and Governor Dudley told me 'twas Madam Winthrop. I told him I had been there but thrice and twice upon business. He said _cave tertium_.\" Even solemn Cotton Mather proffered counsel in a letter on \"paying regards to the Widow.\"  In spite of all these hints and commendations, and the Judge's evident pleasure in receiving them, the Winthrop agitation all came to naught, for about this time he was called to make a will for a Mr. Denison, of Roxbury, who died on March 22d. Though the Judge was too upright and too pious to let even his thoughts wander to a wife, the amazing rapidity with which he turned his longing eyes on the newly-made widow (cruelly forsaking Madam Winthrop) is only equalled by the act of the famous Irish lover who proposed to a widow at the open grave of her husband.  Judge Sewall went home with widow Denison from her husband's funeral and \"prayed God to keep house with her.\" The very next day he writes, \"Mr. Danforth gives the Widow Denison a high commendation for her Piety, Goodness, Diligence and Humility.\" On April 7th she came to the widower to prove her husband's will; and another match-making friend, Mr. Dow, \"took occasion to say in her absence that she was one of the most Dutiful Wives in the World.\" A few days later the Judge made her a gift, \"a Widow's book having writ her name in it.\"  At last, after talking the matter over with all his friends, he decided positively to go a-courting. Widow Denison came to his house and he says:       \"I took her up into my chamber and discoursed Thorowly with her:      told her I intended to visit her next Lecture Day. She said 'twould      be talk'd of, I answered: In such Cases persons must run the      Gantlet. Gave her an Oration.\"  He visited her as he had promised and gave her \"Dr. Mathers Sermons neatly bound and told her in it we were invited to a wedding. She gave me very good Curds.\" Other love gifts followed: \"K. Georges Effigies in Copper and an English Crown of K. Charles II. 1677.\" \"A pound of Reasons and Proportionate Almonds,\" \"A Psalmbook elegantly bound in Turkey leather,\" \"A pair of Shoe Buckles cost five shillings three pence.\" \"Two Cases with a knife and fork in each; one Turtle Shell Tackling; the other long with Ivory Handles squar'd cost four shillings sixpence.\"  In the meantime he read with Cousin Moodey the history of Rebekah's courtship, and then prayed over it, and over his own wooing. Madam Rogers and Madam Leverett much congratulated him, and his daughter Judith visited her prospective stepmother. But alas! the lady was coy and averse to a decision:       \"She mentions her Discouragement by reason of Discourse she had      heard. Ask't what I should allow her, she not speaking I told her I      was willing to allow her two hundred and fifty pounds per annum if      it should please God to take me out of the world before her. She      answered she had better keep as she was than give up a certainty      for an uncertainty. She would pay dear for her living in Boston. I      desired her to make Proposals but she made none. I had thought of      Publishment next Thursday. But I now seem far from it. My"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24159"],["title","Customs and Fashions in Old New England (#7)"],["body","who      has the pity of a Father Direct and help me.\"  Mr. Denison's will left his widow a portion of his estate to dispose of as she wished if she did not marry again. Judge Sewall was unwilling to make equal provision for her, hence the stumbling block in their courtship.  After consulting with a friend, the Judge made a final visit to her on November 28th.       \"She said she thought it was hard to part with all and having      nothing to bestow on her Kindred. I had ask'd her to give me      proposals in Writing and she upbraided me That I who had never      written her a Letter should ask her to write. She asked me if I      would drink, I told her yes. She gave me Cider Aples and a Glass of      Wine, gathered together the little things I had given her and      offered them to me, but I would none of them. Told her I wish'd her      well and should be glad of her welfare. She seem'd to say she      should not again take in hand a thing of this nature. Thank'd me      for what I had given her and Desir'd my Prayers. My bowels yern      towards Mrs. Denison but I think God directs me in his Providence      to desist.\"  This love affair was not, however, quite ended, for the following Lord's Day \"after dark\" Widow Denison came \"very privat\" to his house. This Sunday visit betokened great anxiety on her part. She had walked in from Roxbury in the cold, and when we remember how wolves and bears abounded in the vicinity we comprehend still further her solicitude.       \"She ask'd pardon if she had affronted me.... Mr. Denison spake to      her after signing his will that he would not make her put all out      of her Hand and power but reserve something to bestow on her      friends that might want.... I could not observe that she made me      any offer all the while. She mentioned two Glass Bottles she had.      I told her they were hers and the other small things I had given      her only now they had not the same signification as before, I was      much concerned for her being in the cold, would fetch her a plate      of something warm; she refused. However I fetched a Tankard of      Cider and drank to her. She desired that nobody might know of her      being here. I told her they should not. She went away in the bitter      Cold, no moon being up, to my great pain. I Saluted her at      Parting.\"  With that parting kiss on that dark cold night, in \"great pain,\" ended the Judge's second wooing.  That he was sincerely in love with Widow Denison one cannot doubt, though he loved his money more. Disappointed, he did not again turn to courting until the following August--much longer than he had waited after the death of his wife. He then proceeded in a matter-of-fact way to visit Widow Tilley, whom he had early noted in meeting. He asked her, at his third visit, to \"come and live in his house.\" \"She expressed her unworthiness with much respect,\" and both agreed to consider it. He gave her a little book called \"Ornaments of Sion;\" Mr. Pemberton applauded his courtship; Mrs. Armitage said that Mrs. Tilley had been a great blessing to them; the banns were published; and the Judge's third wooing ended in a marriage on October 24th.  But the bride was very ill on her wedding night, and after several slight sicknesses through the winter, died on May 20th, to her husband's \"great amazement.\" Again he was a-seeking a \"dear Yoke fellow,\" and on September 30th, \"Daughter Sewall acquainted Madam Winthrop that if she pleased to be within at 3 P.M. I would wait on her.\" This was the same Madam Winthrop whose attractions had been so completely obscured by the bright halo which encircled the much-longed-for Widow Denison.       \"Madam Winthrop returning answer that she would be at home, I went      to her house and spake to her saying my loving wife died so soon      and suddenly 'twas hardly convenient for me to think of Marrying      again, however I came to this Resolution that I would not make my      Court to any person without first consulting with her. Had a      pleasant Discourse about Seven Single persons sitting in the      Fore-Seat. She propounded one after another to me but none would      do.\"  Now, I think the Judge was very graceful in approaching a proposal to this widow, for on his next visit he asked to see her alone, and he resumed the pleasant discourse about the seven widows on the fore seat, and said:       \"At last I pray'd Katharine might be the person assigned for me.      She evidently took it up in the way of denyal as if she had catched      at an opportunity to do it, saying she could not do it, could not      leave her children.\"  The Judge begged her not to be so speedy in decision, and brought her gifts, \"pieces of Mr. Belchar's cake and gingerbread wrapped in a clean sheet of paper;\" China oranges; the _News Letter_; Preston's \"Church Marriage;\" sugared almonds (of which she inquired the price). He wrote her a stilted letter with an allusion in it to Christopher Columbus, and he had to explain it to her afterward. He gave money to her servants and \"penys\" to her grandchildren, and heard them \"say their catechise;\" and he had interviews and consultations with her relatives--her children, her sister--who agreed not to oppose the marriage.  Still the progress of the courtship was not encouraging. Katharine went to her neighbors' houses when she knew her suitor was coming to visit her, and left him to read \"Dr. Sibbs Bowels\" for scant comfort. She \"look'd dark and lowering\" at him and coldly placed tables or her grandchild's cradle between her chair and his as they sat together. She avoided seeing him alone. She \"let the fire come to one short Brand beside the Block and fall in pieces and make no recruit\"--a broad hint to leave. She \"would not help him on with his coat\"--a cutting blow. She would not let her servant accompany him home with a lantern, but heartlessly permitted her elderly lover to stumble home alone in the dark. She spoke to him of his luckless courtship of Widow Denison (a most unpleasant topic), thus giving a clue to the whole situation, in showing that Madam Winthrop resented his desertion of her in his first widowerhood, and like Falstaff, would not \"undergo a sneap without reply.\" He said, in apologetic answer:       \"If after a first and second Vagary she would Accept of me      returning her Victorious Kindness and Good Will would be very      Obliging.\"  Undeterred by these many rebuffs, as she grew cold he waxed warm, and a most lover-like and gallant scene ensued which would have done credit to a younger man than the Judge. Here it is in his own words:       \"I asked her to Acquit me of Rudeness if I drew off her Glove.      Enquiring the reason I told her 'twas great odds between handling a      dead Goat and a Living Lady. Got it off.... Told her the reason why      I came every other night was lest I should drink too Deep draughts      of Pleasure. She had talked of Canary, her Kisses were to me better      than the best Canary.\"  Naturally these warm words had a marked effect; she relaxed, drank a glass of wine with him, and I trust gave him a Canary-sweet kiss, and sent a servant home with him with a lantern.  The next visit the wind blew cold again. He had had one experience with a short-lived wife, and he had determined that should his next wife die he would still have some positive benefit from having married her. Hence he kept pressing Madam Winthrop in a most unpleasant and ghoulish manner to know what she would give him in case she died. He would allow her but one hundred pounds per annum. She in turn persisted in questioning him about the property he had given to his children; and she wished him to agree to keep a coach (which he could well afford to do), and she wanted it set on springs too. He said he could not do it while he paid his debts. She also suggested that he should wear a wig. This annoyed him beyond measure, for he hated with extreme Puritan intenseness those \"horrid Bushes of Vanity,\" and the suggestion from his would-be bride was irritating in the extreme. He answered her with much self-control:       \"As to a Periwigg my best and Greatest Friend begun to find me with      Hair before I was born and has continued to do so ever since and I      could not find it in my heart to go to another.\"  Still, when nearly all the men of dignity and position in the colony wore imposing stately wigs, no woman would be pleased to have a lover come a-courting in a _hood_.  So, though she gave him \"drams of Black Cherry Brandy\" and Canary to drink and comfits and lump sugar to eat, while he so pressed her to name her settlement on him, and while the wig and coach questions were so adversely met, she would not answer yes, and he regretted making more haste than good speed. At last the lover of the \"kisses sweeter than Canary\" critically notes that his mistress has not on \"Clean Linen;\" and the next day he writes rather sourly, \"I did not bid her draw off her Glove as sometime I had done. Her dress was not so clean as sometime it had been;\" the beginning of the end was plainly come. That week he forbade her being invited to a family dinner, and she in turn gave a \"treat\" from which he was excluded. Thus ended his fourth wooing.  The next widow on whom he called was Widow Belknap, but eftsoons he transferred his attention to Widow Ruggles and wrote thus sentimentally to her brother:       \"I remember when I was going from school at Newbury to have      sometime met your sisters Martha and Mary in Hanging Sleeves coming      home from their school in Chandlers Lane, and have had the pleasure      of speaking to them. And I could find it in my heart to speak to      Mrs. Martha again, now I myself am reduc'd to my Hanging Sleeves.      The truth is, I have little occasion for a Wife but for the sake of      Modesty, and to lay my Weary Head in Her Lap, if it might be      brought to pass upon Honest Conditions.
