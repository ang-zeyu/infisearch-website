And grinning over his shoulder, he swam away.  Mr. Frog watched his friend from the shore.  \"He can't fool me,\" he muttered. \"Tired Tim _invited himself_. And I've been stupid not to do likewise.\"  On the following night Ferdinand Frog went to the edge of Cedar Swamp, where he waited somewhat impatiently on a log until Tired Tim Beaver joined him.  \"Well!\" Mr. Frog cried. \"I'm glad to see you and I hope you've brought my invitation.\"  But Tired Tim wouldn't say yes or no.  \"If I succeed in getting you into the Cedar Swamp singing-parties will you promise me that you won't sing any more around the lake, or near our pond, either?\" he demanded.  Ferdinand Frog gave his solemn promise.  \"Very well, then!\" Tired Tim said. \"Go along over to the swamp. They're expecting you.\"  When he heard the good news Ferdinand Frog was so delighted that he leaped into the air and kicked his heels together.  And then forgetting his solemn promise, he began to bellow at the top of his voice:          \"To Cedar Swamp I'll haste away;            Though first I'll sing a song.          My voice I must not waste to-day,            So I'll not keep you long.          I simply want to let you know            I'm much obliged, before I go.\"  \"Don't mention it!\" said Tired Tim.  \"Don't interrupt me, please!\" said Ferdinand Frog. \"I haven't finished thanking you yet. That's only the first verse.\"  \"How many more are there?\" Tired Tim inquired with a yawn.  \"Ninety-nine!\" Mr. Frog answered. And he was somewhat surprised--and puzzled--when Tired Tim left him suddenly and plunged into the underbrush.     VII  THE SINGING-PARTY   Ferdinand Frog lost no time, after Tired Tim left him. He jumped into the swamp and made straight towards the very middle of it, whence he could already hear the chorus of the numerous Frog family; for the singing-party had begun.  Mr. Frog made all haste, not wishing to miss any more of the fun. Now swimming, now leaping from one hummock to another--or sometimes to an old stump--he quickly reached the place where the Frog family were enjoying themselves.  \"Here he is!\" several of the singers exclaimed as soon as Ferdinand Frog's head popped out of the water, in their midst.  He saw at once that they had been expecting him; and he smiled and bowed--and waited for the company to stop singing and give him a warm greeting with their cold, damp hands. But except for those first few words, no one paid the slightest attention to the newcomer.  In fact, nobody even took the trouble to nod to Ferdinand Frog--much less to shake hands with him and tell him that he was welcome.  Meanwhile one song followed another with hardly a pause between them. And Mr. Frog found that he did not know the words of even one.  He was so impatient that at last he climbed upon an old fallen tree-trunk, which stuck out of the greenish-black water, and began to roar his favorite song, while he beat time for the other singers. The name of that song was \"A Frog on a Log in a Bog\"; and Ferdinand Frog thought that he couldn't have chosen another so fitting.  But the rest of the singing-party had other ideas. They turned about and scowled at Mr. Frog as if he had done something most unpleasant.  \"Stop! Stop!\" several of them cried. And an important-looking fellow near him shouted, \"Don't sing that, for pity's sake!\"  \"Why not?\" Ferdinand Frog faltered. \"What's the matter with my song? It's my special favorite, which I sing at least fifty times each night, regularly.\"  \"It's old stuff,\" the other told him with a sneer. \"We haven't sung that for a year, at least.\"  Ferdinand Frog did not try to argue with him. But as soon as he saw another chance he began a different ditty.  Then a loud groan arose. And somebody stopped him again. And Mr. Frog soon learned that they hadn't sung that one for a year and a half.  Though he tried again and again, he had no better luck. But he kept smiling bravely. And finally he asked the company in a loud voice if he \"wasn't going to have a chance.\"  \"Certainly!\" a number of the singers assured him. \"Your chance is coming later. We shan't forget you.\"  And that made Ferdinand Frog feel better. He told himself that he could wait patiently for a time--if it wasn't too long.     VIII  THE MISSING SUPPER   Ferdinand Frog had begun to feel uneasy again. He was afraid that the singers had forgotten their promise to him. But at last they suddenly started a rousing song which made him take heart again.  They roared out the chorus in a joyful way which left no doubt in his mind that his chance was at hand:          \"Now that the concert is ended            We'll sit at the banquet and feast.          Now that the singing's suspended            We'll dine till it's gray in the east.\"  Mr. Frog only hoped that the company did not expect him to sing to them _all_ the time while they were banqueting.  \"They needn't think--\" he murmured under his breath--\"they needn't think I don't like good things to eat as well as they do.\" But he let no one see that he was worried. That was Ferdinand Frog's way: almost always he managed to smile, no matter how things went.  When the last echoes of the song had died away a great hubbub arose. Everybody crowded around Mr. Frog. And there were cries of \"Now! Now!\"  He thought, of course, that they wanted to hear him sing. So he started once more to sing his favorite song. But they stopped him quickly.  \"We've finished the songs for to-night,\" they told him. \"We're ready for the supper now. . . . Where is it?\"  \"Supper?\" Mr. Frog faltered, as his jaw dropped. \"What supper?\"  \"The supper you're going to give us!\" the whole company shouted. \"You know--don't you?--that we have just made a rule for new members: they're to furnish a banquet.\"  Ferdinand Frog's eyes seemed to bulge further out of his head than ever.  \"I--I never heard of this before!\" he stammered.  \"Didn't Tired Tim tell you about our new rule?\" somebody inquired. \"It was his own idea.\"  \"He never said a word to me about it!\" Ferdinand Frog declared with a loud laugh. \"And I can't give you a supper, for I haven't one ready.\"  \"Then we'll postpone it until to-morrow night,\" the company told him hopefully.  \"What does your rule say?\" Ferdinand Frog rolled his eyes as he put the question to them.  \"It says that the banquet must take place the first night the new member is present,\" a fat gentleman replied.  \"Then I can't give you any food to-morrow night,\" Mr. Frog informed them, \"because it would be against the rule.\"  \"Then you can't be a member!\" a hundred voices croaked.  \"I _am_ one now,\" Ferdinand Frog replied happily. \"And what's more, I don't see how you can keep me out of your singing-parties.\"  There was silence for a time.  \"We've been sold,\" some one said at last. \"We've no rule to prevent this fellow from coming here. And the worst of it is, as everybody knows, his voice is so loud it will spoil all our songs.\"  Oddly enough, the speaker was the very one who had always objected to inviting Ferdinand Frog to join the singing parties. His own voice had always been the loudest in the whole company. And naturally he did not want anybody with a louder one to come and drown his best notes.  But now he couldn't help himself. And thereafter when the singers met in Cedar Swamp he always turned greener in the face than ever and looked as if he were about to burst, when Ferdinand Frog opened his mouth its widest and let his voice rumble forth into the night.     IX  THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER   When Ferdinand Frog first came to the Beaver pond to live no one knew anything about him.  He appeared suddenly--no one knew whence--and at once made himself very much at home. It was no time at all before he could call every one of the big Beaver family by name. And he acted exactly as if the pond belonged to him, instead of to the Beavers, whose great-grandfathers had dammed the stream many years before.  But the newcomer was so polite that nobody cared to send him away. At the same time, people couldn't help wondering who the stranger was and where he had come from and what his plans for the future were. Whenever two or three Beavers stopped working long enough to enjoy a pleasant chat, they were sure to talk of the mysterious Mr. Frog and tell one another what they thought of him. Many were the tales told about the nimble fellow.  Some said that he had moved all the way from Farmer Green's duck pond, because Johnnie Green had tried to catch him; while others declared that Ferdinand Frog was a famous singer, who had come to that quiet spot in order to rest his voice, which had become harsh from too much use. Indeed, there were so many stories about the stranger that it was hard to know which to believe--especially after old Mr. Crow informed Brownie Beaver that in his opinion Ferdinand Frog was a slippery fellow. \"I shouldn't be surprised----\" Mr. Crow had said with a wise wag of his head----\"I shouldn't be surprised if his real name was Ferdinand Fraud.\"  Anyhow, there was one thing that almost all the Beaver colony agreed upon. They were of one opinion as to Mr. Frog's clothes, which they thought must be very fashionable, because they were like no others that had ever been seen before in those parts.  There was one young gentleman, however--the beau of the village--who disputed everybody, saying that he believed that Ferdinand Frog must be wearing old clothes that were many years behind the times.  Now, there was one lazy Beaver known as Tired Tim who had nothing better to do than to go straight to Mr. Frog and repeat what he heard.  To Tired Tim's surprise--for he had expected Mr. Frog to lose his temper--to his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24590"],["title","The Tale of Ferdinand Frog (#3)"],["body","that gentleman appeared much amused by the bit of gossip. He shook with silent laughter for a time, quite as if he were saving his voice to use that evening. And then he said:  \"So your young friend thinks I'm not in style, eh? . . . Well, I'll tell you something: he's right, in a way. And in another way he isn't. The reason why I'm not in style is because I always aim to keep five years ahead of everybody else.  \"Five years from now and your neighbors will all be wearing clothes like mine.\"  \"Can't we ever catch up with you?\" Tired Tim asked him.  \"There's only one way you can do that,\" was Mr. Frog's mysterious answer.  And he would say no more.     X  CATCHING UP WITH MR. FROG   Tired Tim Beaver asked Mr. Frog point-blank how a person might catch up with him in the matter of clothes.  \"If you manage to dress in a style that's five years ahead of the times, I should like to know the way to be just as fashionable,\" Tired Tim said.  But he got no help--then--from Mr. Frog. All Ferdinand Frog would say was that he'd be glad to oblige a friend, but he couldn't--and wouldn't--be hurried.  And though the unhappy, eager Tim teased and begged him to tell his secret, Mr. Frog only smiled the more cheerfully and said nothing.  It was maddening--for Tired Tim--though Mr. Frog seemed to be enjoying himself hugely. And the result was that Tired Tim Beaver returned to the village in the pond in a terrible state of mind. Since he told everyone else what he had learned about Ferdinand Frog and his clothes, it was only a short time before the whole Beaver family was so stirred up that they couldn't do a stroke of work. Ferdinand Frog was in everybody's mouth, so to speak. And at last old Grandaddy Beaver hit upon a plan.  \"Why don't you get somebody to make you a suit exactly like Mr. Frog's?\" he asked Tired Tim.  So Tired Tim took Grandaddy's advice. That very night he disappeared, to swagger back in a few days in a costume that made him appear almost like Mr. Frog's twin brother--if one didn't look at his face. And there were some among the villagers who even declared that Tired Tim's mouth seemed wider than it had been, and more like Mr. Frog's.  When they asked Tired Tim if his tailor hadn't stretched his mouth for him he replied no, that he had been smiling a good deal for a day or two, and perhaps that was what made his mouth look different.  Well, the whole Beaver village was delighted with Tired Tim's new suit.  \"Wait till Mr. Frog sees you!\" people cried. \"He'll be _so_ surprised!\"  [Illustration: Mr. Frog Liked to Hear Himself Sing]  And somebody swam away in great haste to find Mr. Frog and ask him to come to the lower end of the pond, where all the houses were. But when Ferdinand Frog arrived, everybody was disappointed, and especially Tired Tim, who had felt very proud in his gorgeous new clothes. For he saw at once that Mr. Frog was arrayed from head to foot in an entirely new outfit. He looked almost like a rainbow, so brilliant were the colors of his costume.  At the same time Tired Tim put on as brave a front as he could. And drawing near to Mr. Frog, he said:  \"What do you think of my new suit?\"  Ferdinand Frog looked at him as if he hadn't noticed him before.  \"Your suit's all right,\" he replied, \"for one who isn't particular. But it's not far enough ahead of the times for me. . . . I'd hate to be caught wearing it.\"  It was a bitter blow for Tired Tim Beaver. In fact, he felt more tired than ever; and he sank to the bottom of the pond to rest, where his friends couldn't see him.  As for the other members of the Beaver family, they all went home with a great longing inside them. There wasn't a single one of them that wasn't eager to wear clothes exactly as far ahead of the times as were those of the elegant stranger, Ferdinand Frog.     XI  FERDINAND FROG IS IN NO HURRY   Although everybody in the Beaver village looked worried, Mr. Frog seemed to be all the more cheerful. He knew well enough that there was hardly one Beaver in the pond that didn't wish and long for clothes which were, like Mr. Frog's, five years ahead of the times.  As day after day passed, not only were the Beavers unable to do a single stroke of work; they were so upset that they could scarcely eat or sleep. And at last the older villagers, such as Grandaddy Beaver, began to see that something would have to be done. There was the dam, which needed mending; and there was the winter's food, which had to be gathered.  So Grandaddy Beaver went to Ferdinand Frog one day and told him that he simply _must_ come to the rescue of the pond folk, and tell them how they might have clothes as far ahead of the times as were his own.  \"Why?\" Mr. Frog inquired. \"What's the trouble?\"  \"They can't work,\" Grandaddy Beaver told him. \"And there's the dam to be fixed, and tree-tops to be cut and stored for food, because winter's a-coming, and there's no way we can stop it.\"  \"I'll tell you what you and your people can do,\" Ferdinand Frog replied. \"Just bury yourselves in the mud during the winter, as I do, and you'd have no use for a dam, nor for food, either.\"  But Grandaddy Beaver explained that though such a plan might suit a Frog exceedingly well, for a Beaver it would never do at all.  \"You have got us into this scrape,\" he told Mr. Frog, \"so it's only fair that you should help us out of it.\"  Ferdinand Frog then did a number of things, all of which were intended to let Grandaddy Beaver see that what he asked couldn't be done. Mr. Frog held up his hands with the palms out and rolled his eyes; he shut his great mouth together as if he did not intend to say another word. He looked so determined that Grandaddy Beaver's heart sank.  And then--when Grandaddy Beaver had almost given up all hope--then Mr. Frog said suddenly:  \"I'll consent to help you, because I see that it's my duty.\"  \"Good!\" Grandaddy Beaver cried. \"I told people that I knew you'd come to our rescue, for you have such a kind face! . . .  \"And now, tell me!\" he bade Ferdinand Frog with great eagerness, while he held a hand behind one of his ears, in order to hear more clearly.  But Mr. Frog was not ready to give away his secret.  He winked at Grandaddy Beaver, and poked his fingers into the old gentleman's ribs.  \"Not so fast, my lad!\" said Mr. Frog, who was certainly many years younger than Grandaddy Beaver. \"I'm not prepared to explain everything to you just yet.  \"You come to the big rock on the other side of the pond as soon as it's dark to-night; and bring with you everybody who wants to know how to get clothes like mine.  \"Now, do exactly as I say,\" Mr. Frog cautioned Grandaddy, \"and _everything will be made easy_.\"     XII  A BAD BLUNDER   When it was almost dark Grandaddy Beaver swam across the pond to the big rock, where Ferdinand Frog had told him to come.  And trooping after Daddy was almost everybody in the village. Not counting the women and children, there were eleven of them. They climbed upon the rock, looking for Mr. Frog. But he was nowhere in sight.  \"He'll be here in a minute or two, probably,\" Grandaddy Beaver said hopefully, for all he looked a bit anxious.  Then somebody spied a neat building near-by, which not one of them had noticed before.  \"What's this strange house?\" people asked one another. \"Is this where Mr. Frog lives?\"  But nobody seemed to know the answer to that question.  \"It can't be a shop,\" Grandaddy decided, \"for there's no sign on it. And nobody would have a shop without a sign.\"  Now, the door of the little building was shut and fastened. And the window-shades were pulled carefully down. It certainly looked as if nobody was at home.  But suddenly there came a sound that made the Beaver family jump. It came from the house--there was no doubt of that.  In fact it came right through the keyhole; and it was like nothing in the world but a sneeze.  A number of people were all ready to jump into the water and swim away, they were so startled.  And then a snicker followed the sneeze. And by that time Grandaddy Beaver and his friends guessed who was inside the building. It was Ferdinand Frog; and he had been watching his callers all the time, through the keyhole, and listening to everything that they said.  A few felt slightly uneasy, as they tried to remember exactly what remarks they had made about Mr. Frog himself.  \"Come out!\" they all cried, as soon as they had recovered from their surprise. \"We want to see you!\" And they formed a half-circle in the dooryard.  Presently the door swung out, as if somebody had pushed it open. And there, on the _inside_ of the open door, which was flung back against the outside of the building, they all saw a sign, which said:           MR. FERDINAND FROG         UNFASHIONABLE TAILOR           ALL THE STYLES          FIVE YEARS AHEAD           OF THE TIMES  People began exclaiming that that was just like Ferdinand Frog--who was an odd fellow--to have his sign painted on the inside of his door instead of on the outside.  \"It'll be all the style five years from now,\" he retorted.  So that was Mr. Frog's secret! He was a tailor himself! And there he was, ready to make clothes for all of them!  It was almost too good to be true. But there he stood in the doorway, with a tape around his neck, smiling and bowing.  \"You'd better form in line!\" he suggested. \"You can come in through the front door. I'll measure you. And you can pass out the back way. . . . Don't crowd, please!\"  Now, that was just where Mr. Frog made a great blunder. But he didn't find it out till it was too late.     XIII  A SIXTY-INCH MEAL   Mr. Frog's scheme of measuring the Beaver family for new suits had just one drawback; the Beaver family liked it too well. So pleased were they over the prospect of having \"unfashionable\" clothes like Mr. Frog's at last that all of them wanted to be measured not once but several times. And each and every one, as soon as Mr. Frog had taken his measurements, went out through the back door and slipped around the little"]]]
