Still I suppose these little mopsey Pekingese must have some brains or the Lord would not have made them. No doubt I shall get used to them in time.\"  \"It is only for the summer vacation anyway, you know,\" ventured his mother. \"The Crowninshields go back to New York in October.\"  \"I certainly ought to be able to bear up a few months,\" laughed Walter, with a ludicrously wry twist of his mouth. \"I hate to think you've been bothered and have been keeping it all to yourself.\"  \"Misery does like company,\" Mrs. King returned with an unsteady laugh. \"I believe I feel better already for having told you. But you must not worry, dear. We shall pull through all right, I guess. How I came to speak of it I don't know. It was only that it seemed such a pity to toss the Crowninshield offer aside without even considering it. Nobody knows where it might end. The village people say Mr. Crowninshield is a very generous man, especially if he takes a fancy to anybody.\"  \"But he may not take a fancy to me.\"  \"He must have done so already to be asking you to help with the dogs.\"  \"Nonsense, Ma! Did you think Mr. Crowninshield picked me out himself? Why, he's never laid eyes on me. That great privilege is still in store for him. No, he simply told Jerry Thomas, the caretaker, to find somebody for the job before the family arrived. He doesn't care a darn who it is so long as he has a person who can be trusted with his priceless pups. Why, I heard the other day that a dealer from New York had offered five thousand dollars for the smallest one.\"  \"Walter!\"  \"Straight goods!\"  \"Five thousand dollars for a dog!\" gasped Mrs. King.  Her son chuckled at her incredulity.  \"Sure!\"  \"But it's a fortune,\" murmured she. \"I had no idea there was a dog on earth worth that much.\"  \"All of them are not.\"  \"But five thousand dollars!\" she repeated. \"Why, Walter, I wouldn't have you responsible for a creature like that for anything in the world. You might as well attempt to be custodian of a lot of gold bonds. I shouldn't have a happy moment or sleep a wink thinking of it. Suppose some of the little wretches were to run away and get lost? Or suppose they were to be stolen? Or they might get sick and die on your hands.\"  \"That is why they want a responsible person to keep an eye on them.\"  His Highness squared his shoulders and threw out his chest.  \"But you are not a responsible person,\" burst out Mrs. King with unflattering candor.  \"Mother!\"  \"Well--are you?\" she insisted.  The boy's figure shriveled.  \"No,\" he confessed frankly, \"I'm afraid I'm not.\"  \"Of course you're not,\" continued his mother with the same brutal truthfulness. \"It isn't that you do not mean to be, sonny,\" added she kindly. \"But your mind wanders off on all sorts of things instead of the thing you're doing. That is why you do not get on better in school. All your teachers say you are bright enough if you only had some concentration to back it up. What you can be thinking of all the time I cannot imagine; but certainly it isn't your lessons.\"  \"I know,\" nodded Walter without resentment. \"My mind does flop about like a kite. I think of everything but what I ought to. It's a rotten habit.\"  \"Well, all I can say is you'd be an almighty poor one to look after a lot of valuable dogs,\" sniffed his mother.  \"I'll bet I could do it if I set out to.\"  \"But would you set out to--that is the question? Would you really put your entire attention on those dogs so that other people could drop them from their minds? That is what taking care means.\"  \"I couldn't promise. I could only try.\"  \"I should never dare to have you undertake it.\"  \"That settles it, Ma,\" announced His Highness. \"I've evidently got to prove to you that you are wrong. I'm going up to Crowninshields' this minute to tell Jerry he can count on me from July until October.\"  \"You're crazy.\"  \"Wait and see.\"  \"I know what I'll see,\" was the sharp retort. \"I shall see all those puppies kicking up their heels and racing off to Provincetown, and Mr. Crowninshield insisting that you either find them and bring them back or pay him what they cost him.\"  \"Don't you believe it.\"  \"That is what will happen,\" was the solemn prophecy.  \"But you were keen for me to take the job.\"  \"That was before I knew what the little rats were worth.\"  \"You just thought it was a cheap sort of a position and that I was to race round and make it pleasant for a lot of ordinary curs, didn't you?\" interrogated the lad with mock indignation.  In spite of herself his mother smiled.  \"Well, you see you were wrong,\" went on Walter. \"It is not that sort of thing at all. It is a job for a trustworthy man, Jerry Thomas said, and will bring in good wages.\"  \"It ought to,\" replied his mother sarcastically, \"if a person must spend every day for three months sitting with his eyes glued on those mites watching every breath they draw.\"  \"It isn't just days, Mother; I'd have to be there nights as well.\"  \"_What!_\"  \"That's what Jerry told me. I'd have to sleep on the place. Mr. Crowninshield wants some one there all the time.\"  \"But Walter----!\" Mrs. King broke off in dismay.  \"I know that would mean leaving you alone now that Bob has a regular position at the Seaver Bay Wireless station. Still, why should you mind? I have always been gone all day, anyhow; and at night I sleep so soundly that you yourself have often said burglars might carry away the bed from under me and I not know it.\"  \"You are not much protection, that's a fact,\" confessed Mrs. King. \"Fortunately, though, I am not a timid person. It is not that I am afraid to stay here alone. My chief objection is that it seems foolish to run a great house like this simply for myself.\"  \"Couldn't you get some one to come and keep you company?\"  \"Who, I should like to know?\"  \"Why--why--well, I haven't thought about it. Of course there's Aunt Marcia King.\"  \"Mercy on us!\" exclaimed his mother, instantly flaring up. \"I'd rather see the evil one himself put in an appearance than your Aunt Marcia. Of all the fault-finding, critical, sharp-tongued creatures in the world she is the worst. Why, I'd let burglars carry away every stick and stone I possess and myself thrown in before I would ask her here to board.\"  \"My, Mother! I'd no idea you had such a temper. You're as bad as Dave Corbett,\" asserted Walter teasingly.  His mother tossed her head but he saw her flush uncomfortably.  \"I suppose you wouldn't want a regular boarder,\" suggested the boy in order to turn the conversation.  \"A _boarder_!\" There was less disapproval than surprise in the ejaculation, however.  \"Lots of people in the town do take summer boarders,\" added he.  \"The thought never entered my head before,\" reflected his mother aloud. \"There certainly is plenty of room in the house, and we have a royal view of the water. Besides, there's the garden. Strangers are always coming here in vacation time and asking if they may look at it or sketch it. It never seemed anything very remarkable to me for most of the flowers have sown themselves and grow like weeds, but of course there's no denying the hollyhocks, poppies, and larkspur are pretty. But visitors always call it wonderful.\"  \"Most likely you could get a big price if you were to rent rooms.\"  \"I'm sure I could,\" replied Mrs. King thoughtfully. \"It would help toward the mortgage and the other bills, too. I've half a mind to try it, Walter.\"  \"It would mean extra work for you.\"  \"Pooh! What do I care for that? Not a fig! In fact, with both of you boys away I'd rather be busy than not,\" was the quick retort.  \"Do you suppose Bob would mind?\"  \"Bob? Why, he's seldom at home nowadays. Why should he care?\"  \"Aunt Marcia might think----\" began the boy mischievously. But the comment was cut short.  \"Oh, I know what your Aunt Marcia would say,\" broke in Mrs. King. \"She'd hold up her hands in horror and announce that it was beneath the dignity of the family to take boarders.\"  They both laughed.  \"I believe the very notion of scandalizing her will be what will decide me,\" concluded his mother with finality. \"I'll put an advertisement in the Boston paper to-morrow and see what luck I have. If the right people do not turn up, why I don't have to take them.\"  \"Sure you don't.\"  \"It's a good plan, a splendid plan, Walter. Boarders will give me company and money too. I wonder it never occurred to me to do it before.\" Then she patted the lad's shoulder, adding playfully, \"I guess if you have brains in one direction you must have them in another. Still, as I said before, I do not fancy your being responsible for those dogs.\"  \"Pooh! You quit worrying, Ma, or I shall be sorry I told you they were blue ribbon pups.\"  \"I should have heard of it, never fear. You hear of everything in this town. You can't help it. Like as not everybody in the place will know by to-morrow morning that I am going to take boarders. Luckily I don't care--that's one good thing. And as to the dogs, if you are resolved to accept that position all I can say is that you must keep a head on your shoulders. You cannot hire out for a job unless you are prepared to give a full return for the money paid you. It is not honest. So think carefully what you mean to do before you embark. And remember, if you get into some careless scrape you cannot come back on me for money for I haven't any to hand over.\"  \"I shall shoulder my own blame,\" responded Walter, drawing in his chin.  \"Well and good then. If you are ready to do that, it is your affair and I have nothing more to say,\" announced Mrs. King, preparing to leave the room.  But Walter stayed her on the threshold.  \"I don't see,\" he began, \"why you always seem to expect I'm going to get into a scrape. You are never looking for trouble with Bob.\"  \"Bob! Bless your heart I never have to! You know that as well as I do. Any one could trust Bob until the Day of Judgment. He never forgets a word you tell him. Ask him to do an errand and it is as good as done. You can drop it from your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23728"],["title","Walter and the Wireless (#2)"],["body","d. From a little child he was dependable like that. His teachers couldn't say enough about him. Wasn't he always at the head of his class? The way he's turned out is no surprise. Think of his picking up wireless enough outside school hours to get a radio job during the war, and afterward that fine position at Seaver Bay! Few lads his age could have done it. And think of the messages he's entrusted with--government work, and sinking ships, and goodness knows what not!\"  The proud mother ceased for lack of breath.  \"I wish I was like Bob,\" sighed Walter gloomily.  \"Nonsense!\" was the instant exclamation. \"You're yourself, and scatter-brain as you are, I'd want you no different. You're but a lad yet. When you are Bob's age you may be like him. Who knows?\"  \"I'm afraid not,\" came dismally from Walter. \"I haven't started out as Bob did.\"  \"What if you haven't? There's time enough to catch up if you hurry. And anyway, I do not want my children all alike. Variety is the spice of life. I wouldn't have you patterned after Bob if I could speak the word.\"  \"You wouldn't?\" the boy brightened.  \"Indeed I wouldn't! Who would I be patching torn trousers or darning ripped sweaters for if you were like Bob, I'd like to know? Who'd be pestering me to hunt up his cap and mittens? And who would I be frying clams for?\"  \"Bob never could abide clam fritters, could he?\" put in the younger brother.  \"Bob never had any frivolities,\" mused Mrs. King, shaking her head. \"Sometimes I've almost wished he had if only to keep the rest of us in countenance. Many's the time I've feared lest he was going to die he was that near perfect.\"  \"Well, Ma, you haven't had to lie awake worrying because I was too good for this world, have you?\" chuckled His Highness, breaking into a grin.  His mother regarded him affectionately.  \"Oh, you'll make your way too, sonny, some day. It won't be as Bob has done it; but you'll make it nevertheless. Folks are going to do things for you simply because they cannot help it.\"  The boy studied her with a puzzled expression.  \"What do you mean, Mater?\"  As if coming out of a reverie Mrs. King started, the mistiness that had softened her eyes vanishing.  \"There! Look at the way you've splashed up my nice clean sink!\" complained she tartly. \"Did any one ever see such a child--always messing up everything! Come, clear out of here and take your fish with you. It does seem as if you needed four nursemaids and a valet at your heels to pick up after you. Be off this minute.\"  With a cloth in one hand and a bar of soap in the other, she elbowed him away from the dishpan.  \"You'll fry these flounders for supper, won't you, Ma?\" called the lad as he disappeared into the shed.  \"Fry 'em? I reckon I'll have to. It's wicked to catch fish and not use 'em.\"  But he saw his mother's eyes twinkle and her grumbling assent did not trouble him.     CHAPTER II  THE NEW JOB   May at Lovell's Harbor was one of the most beautiful seasons of the year. In fact the inhabitants of the town often remarked that they put up with the winters the small isolated village offered for the sake of its springs and summers. Certain it was that when easterly storms swept the marshes and lashed the harbor into foam; when every boat that struggled out of the channel returned whitened to the gunwale with ice, there was little to induce anybody to take up residence in the hamlet. How cold and blue the water looked! How the surf boomed up on the lonely beach and the winds howled and whined around the eaves of the low cottages!  One buttoned himself tightly into a greatcoat then, twisted a muffler many times about his neck, pulled his cap over his ears, and rushed for school with a velocity that almost equaled the scudding schooners whose sails billowed large against the horizon. At least that was what His Highness, Walter King, invariably did.  But from the instant the breath of spring stole into the air,--ah, then Lovell's Harbor became a different place altogether. The stems of the willows fringing the small fresh-water ponds mellowed to bronze before one's very eyes; the dull reaches of salt grass turned emerald; the steely tint of the sea softened to azure and glinted golden in the sun. How shrill sounded the cries of the redwings in the marsh! How jolly the frogs' twilight chorus!  The miracle went on with amazing rapidity. Soon you were scouring the hollows in the woods for arbutus or splashing bare-legged into the bogs for cowslips. You even ventured knee-deep into the sea which although still chill was no longer frigid. And then, before you knew it, you were hauling out your fishing tackle and looking over your flies; inspecting the old dory and calking her seams with a coat of fresh paint. Then came the raking of the leaves, the uncovering of the hollyhocks, and the burning of brush; and through the mists of smoke that rose high in air you could hear the resonant chee-ee of the blackbirds swinging on the reeds along the margin of the creek.  And afterward, when summer had really made its appearance, what days of blue and gold followed! Was ever sky so cloudless, grass so vividly green, or ocean so sparkling? Ah, a boy never lacked amusement now! He wriggled into his bathing suit directly after breakfast and was off to the shore to swim, fish, or sail, or do any of the thousand-and-one alluring things that turned up. And things always did turn up in that small horseshoe where the boats made in. It was the club of Lovell's Harbor.  Here all the men of the village congregated daily to smoke, swap jokes, and heckle those who worked.  \"That's no way to mend a net, Eph,\" one of the spectators would protest. \"Where was you fetched up, man? Tote the durn thing over here and I'll show you how they do it off the Horn.\"  Or another member of the audience would call:  \"Was you reckonin' you'd have enough paint in that keg to finish your yawl, Eddie? Never in the world! What are you so scrimpin' of it for? Slither it on good and thick and let it trickle down into the cracks. 'Twill keep 'em tight.\"  Oh, one learned to curb his temper and bend to the higher criticism if he carried his work down to the beach. He got an abundance of advice whether he asked for it or not and for the most part the counsel was sound and helpful. There you heard also tales of tempests, wrecks, strange ports, and sea serpents,--weird tales that chilled your blood; and sometimes the piping note of an old chanty was raised by one whose sailing days were now only a memory.  What marvel that to be a boy at Lovell's Harbor was a boon to be coveted even if along with the distinction went a throng of homely tasks such as shucking clams, cleaning cod, baiting lobster pots, and running errands? No cake is all frosting and no chowder all broth. You had to take the bad along with the good if you lived at Lovell's Harbor. And while you were sandwiching in work and fun what an education you got! Why, it was better than a dozen schools. Not only did you learn to swim like a spaniel, pull a strong oar, hoist a sail, and gain an understanding of winds and tides, but also you came to handle tools with an ease no manual training school could teach you. You made a wooden pin do if you had no nail; and a bit of rope serve if the whittled pin were lacking. Instead of hurrying to a shop to purchase new you patched up the old, and the triumph of doing it afforded a satisfaction very pleasant to experience.  Moreover, as a result, you had more pennies in your pocket and more brains in your head. Both Bob and Walter King, as well as most of the other village lads, outranked the town-bred boy in all-round practical skill. They may not have cut such a fine figure at golf or dancing; perhaps they did not excel at Latin or French; but they had at the tips of their tongues numberless useful facts which they had tried out and proven workable and which no city dweller could possibly have gleaned.  His Highness might be freckled and towsled and, as his mother affirmed, forgetful and careless, but like a sponge his active young mind had soaked up a deal no books could have given him. You would best beware how you jollied Walter King or put him down for a \"Rube.\" More than likely you would later regret your snap judgment.  No doubt it was this realization that had stimulated Jerry Thomas to ask him to come to Surfside, the Crowninshields' big summer estate, and look after the dogs. Jerry was an old resident of Lovell's Harbor, and having watched the boy grow up, he unquestionably knew what he was about. That there were plenty of other boys at the Harbor to choose from was certain. If the honor descended to His Highness rest assured it was not without reason.  Hence Jerry was not only pleased but immensely gratified when on the morning following Walter rounded the corner of the great barn and appeared in the doorway.  \"I've come to say Yes to that job you offered me the other day,\" announced he, without wasting words on preliminaries.  \"Good, youngster!\"  \"When shall you want me?\"  \"When can you come?\" grinned Jerry.  He was a lank, sharp-featured man with china blue eyes that narrowed to a mere slit when he smiled, and from the corners of which crowsfeet, like fan-shaped streaks of light from the rising sun, radiated across his temples. His skin was tanned to the hue of old hickory and deep down in its furrows were lines of white. He had a big nose that was always sunburned, powerful hands with a reddish fuzz on their backs, and gnarled fingers that bore the scars of innumerable nautical disasters. But the chief glory he possessed was a neatly tattooed schooner that sailed under full canvas upon his forearm and bore beneath it the inscription:      The Mollie D. The finest ship afloat.  The words had been intended as a tribute rather than a challenge for Jerry was a peaceful soul, but unfortunately they had proved provocative of many a brawl, and had the truth been known a certain odd slant of Jerry's chin could have been"]]]
