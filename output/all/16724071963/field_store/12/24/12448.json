He grew melancholy, gazing out of the window-slit.  Not a very cheerful view--just the plain and the sky--but he liked it. He used to think, if he could only fly out of that window, up to the sky or down to the plain, how nice it would be! Perhaps when he died--his nurse had told him once in anger that he would never leave the tower till he died--he might be able to do this.  \"And I wish I had somebody to tell me all about it; about that and many other things; somebody that would be fond of me, like my poor white kitten.\"  Here the tears came into his eyes, for the boy's one friend had been a little white kitten, which the deaf mute, kindly smiling, once took out of his pocket and gave him. For four weeks it was his constant companion and plaything, till one moonlight night it took a fancy for wandering, climbed on to the parapet of the tower, dropped over and disappeared. It was not killed, he hoped; indeed, he almost fancied he saw it pick itself up and scamper away, but he never caught sight of it again.  \"Yes, I wish I had a person, a real live person, who would be fond of me and kind to me. Oh, I want somebody--dreadfully, dreadfully!\"  As he spoke, there sounded behind him a slight tap-tap-tap, as of a cane, and twisting himself around, what do you think he saw? A curious little woman, no bigger than he might himself have been, had his legs grown, but she was not a child--she was an old woman with a sweet smile and a soft voice, and was carrying a cane.  \"My own little boy,\" she said, \"I could not come to you until you had said you wanted me, but now you do want me, here I am.\"  \"And you are very welcome, madam,\" replied the Prince. \"May I ask you who you are? Perhaps my mother?\"  [Illustration: AND TWISTING HIMSELF AROUND, WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAW? [PAGE 16.]]  \"No, I am not your mother, though she was a dear friend of mine.\"  \"Will you tell her to come and see me then?\"  \"She cannot; but I daresay she knows all about you and loves you. I love you, too, and I want to help you, my poor little boy.\"  \"Why do you call me poor?\" asked Prince Dolor in surprise.  The little old woman sighed and glanced down at his legs and feet, which he did not know were different from those of other children, and then to his sweet, bright face.  \"I beg your pardon, My Prince,\" said she.  \"Yes, I am a prince, and my name is Dolor; will you tell me yours, madam?\"  The little old woman laughed like a chime of silver bells.  \"I have so many that I don't know which to choose. It was I who gave you yours, and you will belong to me all your days. I am your godmother.\"  \"Hurrah!\" cried the little prince; \"I am glad I belong to you, for I like you very much.\"  So they sat down and played and talked together.  \"Are you very lonesome here?\" asked the little old woman.  \"Not particularly, thank you, godmother. I have my lessons to do, and my books to read.\"  \"And you want for nothing?\"  \"Nothing. Yes, godmother, please bring me a little boy to play with?\"  \"Just the thing, alas, which I cannot give you.\"  His godmother took him in her arms and kissed him. By-and-by he kissed her at first awkwardly and shyly, then with all the strength of his warm little heart.  \"Promise me that you will never go away, godmother.\"  \"I must, but I will leave you a travelling cloak that will take you wherever you want to go, and show you all that you wish to see.\"  \"I don't need a cloak, for I never go out.\"  \"Hush! the nurse is coming.\"  A grumpy voice and a rattle of plates and dishes was heard.  \"It's my nurse, bringing my dinner; but I don't want dinner. I only want you. Will her coming drive you away, godmother?\"  \"Only for a while, only wish for me and I will return.\"  When the door opened, Prince Dolor shut his eyes; opening them again, nobody but his nurse was in the room, as his godmother had melted away.  \"Such a heap of untidy books; and what's this rubbish?\" said she, kicking a little bundle that lay beside them.  \"Give it to me,\" cried the Prince; and reaching after it, he hid it under his pinafore.  It was, though she did not know this, his wonderful travelling-cloak.     CHAPTER IV.   The cloak outside, was the commonest looking bundle imaginable--Dolor touched it; it grew smaller, and he put it into his trouser's pocket and kept it there until he had a chance to look at it.  It seemed but a mere piece of cloth, dark green in color, being worn and shabby, though not dirty.  Prince Dolor examined it curiously; spread it out on the floor, then arranged it on his shoulders. It felt comfortable; but was the only shabby thing the Prince had ever seen in his life.  \"And what use will it be to me?\" said he sadly, \"and what in the world shall I do with it?\"  He folded it carefully and put it away in a safe corner of his toy-cupboard. After a time he nearly forgot the cloak and his godmother. Sometimes though, he recalled her sweet pleasant face; but as she never came, she gradually slipped out of his memory, until something happened which made him remember her, and want her as he had never wanted anything before.  Prince Dolor fell ill. He caught a complaint common to the people of Nomansland, called the doldrums, which made him restless, cross and disagreeable. Even when a little better, he was too weak to enjoy anything, but lay all day alone.  \"I wonder what my godmother meant when she looked at my legs and sighed so bitterly? Why can't I walk like my nurse. It would be very nice to move about quickly or fly like a bird. How nice it must be to be a bird. If legs are no good, why can one not have wings? I am so tired and no one cares for me, except perhaps my godmother. Godmother, dear, have you forsaken me?\"  He stretched himself wearily, gathered himself up, and dropped his head upon his hands; as he did so, he felt somebody kiss him on the back of his neck, and turning, found that he was resting on the warm shoulder of the little old woman.  How glad he was to see her. He put both his arms around her neck and kissed her lovingly.  \"Stop, stop!\" cried she, pretending to be smothered. \"Only just let me have breath to speak one word. Tell me what has happened to you since I saw you.\"  \"Nothing has happened,\" answered the Prince somewhat dolefully.  \"And are you very unhappy, my boy?\"  \"So unhappy, that I was just thinking whether I could not jump down to the bottom of the tower.\"  \"You must be content to stay where you are,\" said the little old woman, \"for you are a prince, and must behave as such--where is your traveling-cloak?\"  Prince Dolor blushed. \"I--I put it away in the cupboard; I suppose it is there still.\"  \"You have never used it; you dislike it?\"  He hesitated, not wishing to be impolite. \"Don't you think it's just a little old and shabby for a prince?\"  The old woman laughed very sweetly.  \"Why, if all the princes in the world craved for it, they couldn't get it, unless I gave it to them. Old and shabby! It's the most valuable thing imaginable! I thought I would give it to you, because--because you are different from other people.\"  \"Am I?\" asked the prince with tears in his eyes.  She touched his poor little legs. \"These are not like the legs of other little boys.\"  \"Indeed!--my nurse never told me that.\"  \"I tell you, because I love you.\"  \"Tell me what, dear godmother?\"  \"That you will never be able to walk, or run, or jump, but your life may be a very happy life for all that. Do not be afraid.\"  \"I am not afraid,\" said the boy, and his lip began to quiver, though he did not cry.  Though he did not wholly understand, he began to guess what his godmother meant. He had never seen any real live boys, but he had seen pictures of them; running and jumping; which he had admired and tried hard to imitate, but always failed. Now, he began to understand that we cannot always have things as we want them, but as they are, and that we must learn to bear them and make the best of them.  She comforted him and whispered in her sweet, strong, cheerful voice--\"Never mind!\"  \"No, I don't think I do mind, that is, I won't mind.\"  \"That is right, My Prince! Let us put our shoulders to the wheel--\"  \"We are in Hopeless Tower and there is no wheel to put our shoulders to,\" said the child sadly.  \"You little matter-of-fact goose! Well for you that you have a godmother called--'Stuff and Nonsense.'\"  \"Stuff and Nonsense! What a funny name!\"  \"Some people give it to me, but they are not my most intimate friends. You may give me any name you please; but I am your godmother. I have few godchildren; those I have love me dearly, and find me the greatest blessing in all the world.\"  \"I can well believe it,\" cried the little lame Prince.  \"Bring the cloak out of the rubbish cupboard, and shake the dust off it, quick!\" said she to Prince Dolor. \"Spread it out on the floor, and wait till the split closes and the edges turn up. Then open the skylight, set yourself on the cloak, and say, 'Abracadabra, dum dum dum,' and--see what will happen!\"  The Prince burst into a fit of laughing. It all seemed so exceedingly silly, and his godmother laughed too.  \"Believe me or not, it doesn't matter,\" said she. \"Here is the cloak; when you want to go travelling on it, say, Abracadabra dum dum dum; when you want to come back again, say, Abracadabra tum tum ti. That's all, good-bye.\"  A puff of pleasant air and his godmother was gone.  \"How rosy your Royal Highness's cheeks are! You seem to have grown better,\" said the nurse entering the room.  \"I have,\" replied the Prince--he felt kindly, even to his grim nurse. \"Let me have my dinner, and you go to your sewing.\"  The instant she was gone, Prince Dolor sprang from his sofa, and with one or two of his frog-like jumps, he reached the cupboard where he kept his toys, and looked everywhere for his traveling-cloak.  Alas! It was not there.  While he was ill, his nurse, had made a grand clearance of all his \"rubbish,\" all the treasures of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24053"],["title","The Little Lame Prince (#3)"],["body"," baby days, which he could not bear to part with. Though he seldom played with them now, he liked just to feel they were there.  They were all gone! and with them the traveling cloak. He sat down on the floor, looking at the empty shelves, then burst out sobbing as if his heart would break.  \"And it is all my own fault,\" he cried. \"I ought to have taken better care of my godmother's gift. Oh, godmother, forgive me! I'll never be so careless again. I'll never be so careless again. I don't know what the cloak is exactly, but I am sure it is something precious. Help me to find it again. Oh, don't let it be stolen from me--don't please.\"  \"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed a silvery voice. \"Why, that traveling-cloak is the one thing in the world which nobody can steal. It is of no use to anybody except the owner. Open your eyes, and see what you can see.\"  His dear old godmother, he thought, and turned eagerly round. But no; he only beheld, lying in a corner of the room, his precious traveling-cloak.  Prince Dolor darted towards it, tumbling several times on the way. Snatching it to his breast, he hugged and kissed it. Then he began unrolling it, wondering each minute what would happen.     CHAPTER V.   No doubt you think Prince Dolor was unhappy. If you had seen him as he sat patiently untying his wonderful cloak, which was done up in a very tight parcel, using his deft little hands, and knitting his brows with determination, while his eyes glistened with pleasure, you might have changed your opinion.  When Prince Dolor had carefully untied all the knots, the cloak began to undo itself. Slowly unfolding, it laid itself down on the carpet, as flat as if it had been ironed; the split joined with a little sharp crick-crack, and the rim turned up all round till it was breast-high; for the meantime the cloak had grown and grown, and become quite large enough for one person to sit in it, as comfortable as if in a boat.  The Prince watched it rather anxiously; it was such an extraordinary thing. However, he was no coward, but a thorough boy, who, if he had been like other boys, would doubtless have grown up daring and adventurous--a soldier--a sailor, or the like. As it was, he could only show his courage by being afraid of nothing, and by doing boldly all that was in his power. And I am not sure but that in this way he showed more real valor than if he had had six pairs of proper legs.  He said to himself, \"What a goose I am! As if my dear godmother would ever have given me anything to hurt me. Here goes!\"  So, with one of his active leaps, he sprang right into the middle of the cloak, where he squatted down, wrapping his arms tight round his knees, for they shook a little and his heart beat fast. But there he sat, waiting for what might happen next.  [Illustration: PRINCE DOLOR MADE A SNATCH AT THE TOPMOST TWIG OF THE TALLEST TREE. [PAGE 32.]]  Nothing did happen, and he began to think nothing would when he recollected the words. \"Abracadabra, dum, dum, dum!\"  He repeated them, laughing all the while, they seemed such nonsense. And then--and then--  The cloak rose, slowly and steadily at first, only a few inches, then gradually higher and higher, till it nearly touched the skylight. Prince Dolor's head actually bumped against the glass.  Then he suddenly remembered his godmother's command--\"Open the skylight!\"  Without a moment's delay he began searching for the bolt, the cloak remaining balanced in the air. The minute the window was opened, out it sailed--right into the clear fresh air, with nothing between it and the cloudless blue. Prince Dolor had never felt such delicious sensation before.  The happiness of the Prince cannot be described, when he got out of Hopeless Tower, and found himself for the first time in the pure open air, with the sky above him and the earth below.  True, there was nothing but earth and sky; no houses, no trees, no rivers, mountains, seas--not a beast on the ground, or a bird in the air. But to him even the level plain looked beautiful; and then there was the glorious arch of the sky, with a little young moon sitting in the west like a baby queen. And the evening breeze was so sweet and fresh, it kissed him like his godmother's kisses; and by-and-by a few stars came out, first two or three, and then quantities--quantities! so that when he began to count them, he was utterly bewildered.  By this time, however, the breeze had become cold and as he had, as he said, no outdoor clothes, poor Prince Dolor began to shiver.  \"Perhaps I had better go home,\" thought he.  But how--for in his excitement the other words which his godmother had told him to use had slipped his memory, and the cloak only went faster and faster, skimming on through the dusky, empty air.  The poor little Prince began to feel frightened. What if his wonderful traveling-cloak should keep on thus traveling, perhaps to the world's end, carrying with it a poor, tired, hungry boy.  \"Dear godmother,\" he cried pitifully, \"do help me! Tell me just this once and I'll never forget again.\"  Instantly the words came to him and he repeated them. \"Abracadabra, tum, tum, ti!\" The cloak began to turn slowly, and immediately started back, as fast as ever, in the direction of the tower.  The skylight he found exactly as he had left it, and he slipped in as easily as he had gotten out. He had scarcely reached the floor when he heard his nurse's voice outside.  \"Bless us! what has become of your Royal Highness all this time? To sit stupidly here at the window until it is quite dark and leave the skylight open too. Prince, what can you be thinking of? You are the silliest boy I ever knew.\"  But he did not mind what she said.  The instant Prince Dolor got off the cloak it folded itself up into a tiny parcel and rolled itself into the farthest corner of the room. If the nurse had seen it she would have taken it for a mere bundle of rubbish. She brought in the supper and lit the candles, her face as unhappy as usual. But Prince Dolor only saw, hidden in the corner where nobody else would see it, his wonderful traveling-cloak. He ate heartily, scarcely hearing his nurse's grumbling.  \"Poor woman!\" he thought, \"_she_ hasn't a traveling-cloak!\"  And when he crept into his little bed, where he lay awake a good while watching the stars, his chief thought was, \"I must be up very early to-morrow morning and get my lessons done, and then I'll go traveling all over the world on my beautiful cloak.\"  So, next day, he opened his eyes with the sun, and went with a good heart to his lessons, which for the first time he found dull, and the instant they were over he crept across the floor, undid the shabby little bundle, climbed on a chair, and thence to the table so as to unbar the skylight; said his magic charm, and was away out of the window in a minute.  He was accustomed to sit so quietly always, that his nurse, though only in the next room did not miss him, and she could not have missed him anyway for the clever godmother made an image, which she set on the window-sill reading and which looked so like Prince Dolor that any common observer would never have guessed the difference.  And all this while the happy little fellow was away floating in the air on his magic cloak, and seeing all sorts of wonderful things--or they seemed wonderful to him, who had hitherto seen nothing at all.  First, there were the flowers that grew on the plain, which, whenever the cloak came near enough, he strained his eyes to look at; they were tiny, but very beautiful.  \"I wonder,\" he thought, \"whether I could see better through a pair of glasses like those my nurse reads with, and takes such care of. How I should take care of them too! if only I had a pair!\"  Immediately he felt a pair of the prettiest gold spectacles ever seen; and looking downwards, he found that, though ever so high above the ground, he could see every blade of grass, every tiny bud and flower--nay, even the insects that walked over them.  \"Thank you, thank you!\" he cried to his dear godmother, whom he felt sure had sent them. He amused himself for ever so long, gazing down upon the grass, every square foot of which was a mine of wonders.  Then, just to rest his eyes, he turned them up to the sky, at which he had looked so often and seen nothing.  Now he saw a long, black wavy line, moving on in the distance. Looking at it through his spectacles, he discovered that it was a long string of birds, flying one after the other, their wings moving steadily and their heads pointed in one direction, as steadily as if each were a little ship.  \"They must be the passage-birds flying seaward!\" cried the boy, who had read a little about them. \"Oh! how I should like to see them quite close, and to know where they come from, and where they are going!\"  The cloak gave a sudden bound forward, and he found himself high up in the air, in the very midst of the birds.  \"Oh I wish I were going with you, you lovely creatures!\" cried the boy. \"I'm getting so tired of this dull plain, and the dreary and lonely tower. I do so want to see the world! Pretty swallows, dear swallows, tell me what it looks like--the beautiful, wonderful world!\"  But the birds flew past and the boy looked after them with envy. Then he settled himself down in the centre of the cloak, feeling quite sad and lonely.  \"I think I'll go home,\" said he, and repeated his \"Abracadabra, tum tum, ti!\" with a rather heavy heart. The more he had, the more he wanted.  He did not like to vex his godmother by calling for her, and telling her how unhappy he was, in spite of all her goodness; so he just kept his trouble to himself, went back to his lonely tower, and spent three days there without attempting another journey on his traveling-cloak.     CHAPTER VI.   The fourth day it happened that the deaf mute paid his accustomed visit, after which Prince Dolor's spirits rose. They always did, when he got the new books, which the King of Nomansland regularly sent to his nephew. He paid "]]]
