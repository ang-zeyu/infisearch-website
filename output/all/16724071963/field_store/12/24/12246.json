Noddy was not selfish; and if the generous vein of his nature had been well balanced and fortified by the corresponding virtues, his character would have soared to the region of the noble and grand in human nature. But the generous in character is hardly worthy of respect, though it may challenge the admiration of the thoughtless, unless it rests upon the sure foundation of moral principle. Noddy forgot his own trials in sympathizing with the unpleasant situation of his associate in wrongdoing, and his present thought was how he should get her out of the scrape. He was honestly willing to sacrifice himself for her sake. While he was faithfully considering the question, in the dim light of his own moral sense, Miss Fanny suddenly burst into tears, and cried with a violence and an unction which were a severe trial to his nerves.  \"Don't cry, Fanny,\" said he; \"I'll get you out of the scrape.\"  \"I don't want to get out of it,\" sobbed she.  Now, this was the most paradoxical reply which the little maiden could possibly have made, and Noddy was perplexed almost beyond the hope of redemption. What in the world was she crying about, if she did not wish to get out of the scrape? What could make her cry if it was not the fear of consequences--of punishment, and of the mean opinion which her friends would have of her, when they found out that she was wicked enough to set a building on fire? Noddy asked no questions, for he could not frame one which would cover so intricate a matter.  \"I am perfectly willing to be punished for what I have done,\" added Fanny, to whose troubled heart speech was the only vent.  \"What are you crying for?\" asked the bewildered Noddy.  \"Because--because I did it,\" replied she; and her choked utterance hardly permitted her to speak the words.  \"Well, Miss Fanny, you are altogether ahead of my time; and I don't know what you mean. If you cry about it now, what did you do it for?\"  \"Because I was wicked and naughty. If I had thought only a moment, I shouldn't have done it. I am so sorry I did it! I would give the world if I hadn't.\"  \"What will they do to you?\" asked Noddy, whose fear of consequences had not yet given place to a higher view of the matter.  \"I don't care what they do; I deserve the worst they can do. How shall I look Bertha and my father in the face when I see them?\"  \"O, hold your head right up, and look as bold as a lion--as bold as two lions, if the worst comes.\"  \"Don't talk so, Noddy. You make me feel worse than I did.\"  \"What in the world ails you, Miss Fanny?\" demanded Noddy, grown desperate by the perplexities of the situation.  \"I am so sorry I did such a wicked thing! I shall go to Bertha and my father, and tell them all about it, as soon as they come home,\" added Fanny, as she wiped away her tears, and appeared to be much comforted by the good resolution which was certainly the best one the circumstances admitted.  \"Are you going to do that?\" exclaimed Noddy, astonished at the declaration.  \"I am.\"  \"And get me into a scrape too! They won't let me off as easy as they do you. I shall be sent off to learn to be a tinker, or a blacksmith.\"  \"You didn't set the boat-house on fire, Noddy. It wasn't any of your doings,\" said Fanny, somewhat disturbed by this new complication.  \"You wouldn't have done it, if it hadn't been for me. I told you what I said to Ben--that I wished the boat-house was burned up; and that's what put it into your head.\"  \"Well, you didn't do it.\"  \"I know that; but I shall have to bear all the blame of it.\"  Noddy's moral perceptions were strong enough to enable him to see that he was not without fault in the matter; and he was opposed to Fanny's making the intended confession of her guilt.  \"I will keep you out of trouble, Noddy,\" said she, kindly.  \"You can't do it; when you own up, you will sink me to the bottom of the river. Besides, you are a fool to do any such thing, Miss Fanny. What do you want to say a word about it for? Ben will think some fellow landed from the river, and set the boat-house on fire.\"  \"I must do it, Noddy,\" protested she. \"I shall not have a moment's peace till I confess. I shall not dare to look father and Bertha in the face if I don't.\"  \"You won't if you do. How are they going to know anything about it, if you don't tell them?\"  \"Well, they will lay it to you if I don't.\"  \"No matter if they do; I didn't do it, and I can say so truly, and they will believe me.\"  \"But how shall I feel all the time? I shall know who did it, if nobody else does. I shall feel mean and guilty.\"  \"You won't feel half so bad as you will when they look at you, and know all the time that you are guilty. If you are going to own up, I shall keep out of the way. You won't see me at Woodville again in a hurry.\"  \"What do you mean, Noddy?\" asked Fanny, startled by the strong words of her companion.  \"That's just what I mean. If you own up, they will say that I made you do it; and I had enough sight rather bear the blame of setting the boat-house afire, than be told that I made you do it. I can dirty my own hands, but I don't like the idea of dirtying yours.\"  \"You don't mean to leave Woodville, Noddy?\" asked Fanny, in a reproachful tone.  \"If you own up, I shall not go back. I've been thinking of going ever since they talked of making a tinker of me; so it will only be going a few days sooner. I want to go to sea, and I don't want to be a tinker.\"  Fanny gazed into the water by the side of the boat, thinking of what her companion had said. She really did not think she ought to \"own up,\" on the terms which Noddy mentioned.  \"If you are sorry, and want to repent, you can do all that; and I will give you my solemn promise to be as good as you are, Miss Fanny,\" said Noddy, satisfied that he had made an impression upon the mind of his wavering companion.  His advice seemed to be sensible. She was sorry she had done wrong; she could repent in sorrow and silence, and never do wrong again. Her father and her sister would despise her if they knew she had done such a wicked and unladylike thing as to set the boat-house on fire. She could save all this pain and mortification, and repent just the same. Besides, she could not take upon herself the responsibility of driving Noddy away from Woodville, for that would cause Bertha a great deal of pain and uneasiness.  Fanny had not yet learned to do right though the heavens fall.  \"Well, I won't say anything about it, Noddy,\" said she, yielding to what seemed to her the force of circumstances.  \"That's right, Fanny. Now, you leave the whole thing to me, and I will manage it so as to keep you out of trouble; and you can repent and be sorry just as much as you please,\" replied Noddy, as he began to row again. \"There is nothing to be afraid of. Ben will never know that we have been on the river.\"  \"But I know it myself,\" said the conscience-stricken maiden.  \"Of course you do; what of that?\"  \"If I didn't know it myself, I should feel well enough.\"  \"You are a funny girl.\"  \"Don't you ever feel that you have done wrong, Noddy?\"  \"I suppose I do; but I don't make any such fuss about it as you do.\"  \"You were not brought up by a kind father and a loving sister, who would give anything rather than have you do wrong,\" said Fanny, beginning to cry again.  \"There! don't cry any more; if you do, you will 'let the cat out of the bag.' I am going to land you here at the Glen. You can take a walk there, and go home about one o'clock. Then you can tell the folks you have been walking in the Glen; and it will be the truth.\"  \"It will be just as much a lie as though I hadn't been there. It will be one half the truth told to hide the other half.\"  This was rather beyond Noddy's moral philosophy, and he did not worry himself to argue the point. He pulled up to the landing place at the Glen, where he had so often conveyed Bertha, and near the spot where he had met with the accident which had placed him under her kindly care. Fanny, with a heavy heart and a doubting mind, stepped on shore, and walked up into the grove. She was burdened with grief for the wrong she had done, and for half an hour she wandered about the beautiful spot, trying to compose herself enough to appear before the people at the house. When it was too late, she wished she had not consented to Noddy's plan; but the fear of working a great wrong in driving him from the good influences to which he was subjected at Woodville, by doing right, and confessing her error, was rather comforting, though it did not meet the wants of her case.  In season for dinner, she entered the house with her hand full of wild flowers, which grew only in the Glen. In the hall she met Mrs. Green, the housekeeper, who looked at her flushed face, and then at the flowers in her hand.  \"We have been wondering where you were, all the forenoon,\" said Mrs. Green. \"I see you have been to the Glen by the flowers you have in your hand. Did you know the boat-house was burned up?\"  \"I saw the smoke of it,\" replied Fanny.  \"It is the strangest thing that ever happened. No one can tell how it took fire.\"  Fanny made no reply, and the housekeeper hastened away to attend to her duties. The poor girl was suffering all the tortures of remorse which a wrong act can awaken, and she went up to her room with the feeling that she did not wish to see another soul for a month.  Half an hour later, Noddy Newman presented himself at the great house, laden with swamp pinks, whose fragrance filled the air, and seemed to explain where he had been all the forenoon. With no little flourish, he requested Mrs. Green to put them in the vases for Bertha's room; for his young mistress was very fond of the sweet blossoms. He appeared to be entirely satisfied with himself; and, with a branch of the pink in his hand, he left the house, and walked towards the servants' quarters, where, at his dinner, he met Ben, the boatman.     CHAPTER IV.  NODDY'S CONFESSION.   The old"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23758"],["title","Work and Win; Or, Noddy Newman on a Cruise (#4)"],["body","never did any thing as other people did it; and though Noddy had put on the best face he could assume to meet the shock of the accusation which he was confident would be brought against him, Ben said not a word about the boat-house. He did not seem to be aware that it had been burned. He ate his dinner in his usual cheerful frame of mind, and talked of swamp pinks, suggested by the branch which the young reprobate had brought into the servants' hall.  Noddy was more perplexed than he had been before that day. Why didn't the old man \"pitch into him,\" and accuse him of kindling the fire? Why didn't he get angry, as he did sometimes, and call him a young vagabond, and threaten to horsewhip him? Ben talked of the pinks, of the weather, the crops, and the latest news; but he did not say a word about the destruction of the boat-house, or Noddy's absence during the forenoon.  After dinner, Noddy followed the old man down to the pier by the river in a state of anxiety which hardly permitted him to keep up the cheerful expression he had assumed, and which he usually wore. They reached the smouldering ruins of the building, but Ben took no notice of it, and did not allude to the great event which had occurred. Noddy was inclined to doubt whether the boat-house had been burned at all; and he would have rejected the fact, if the charred remains of the house had not been there to attest it.  Ben hobbled down to the pier, and stepped on board the Greyhound, which he had hauled up to the shore to enable him to make some repairs on the mainsail. Noddy followed him; but he grew more desperate at every step he advanced, for the old man still most provokingly refused to say a single word about the fire.  \"Gracious!\" exclaimed Noddy, suddenly starting back in the utmost astonishment; for he had come to the conclusion, that if Ben would not speak about the fire, he must.  The old boatman was still vicious, and refused even to notice his well-managed exclamation. Noddy thought it was very obstinate of Ben not to say something, and offer him a chance, in the natural way, to prove his innocence.  \"Why, Ben, the boat-house is burned up!\" shouted Noddy, determined that the old man should have no excuse for not speaking about the fire.  Ben did not even raise his eyes from the work on which he was engaged. He was adjusting the palm on his hand, and in a moment began to sew as though nothing had happened, and no one was present but himself. Noddy was fully satisfied now that the boatman was carrying out the details of some plot of his own.  \"Ben!\" roared Noddy, at the top of his lungs, and still standing near the ruins.  \"What do you want, Noddy?\" demanded Ben, as good-naturedly as though everything had worked well during the day.  \"The boat-house is burned up!\" screamed Noddy, apparently as much excited as though he had just discovered the fact.  Ben made no reply, which was another evidence that he was engaged in working out some deep-laid plot, perhaps to convict him of the crime, by some trick. Noddy was determined not to be convicted if he could possibly help it.  \"Ben!\" shouted he again.  \"Well, Noddy, what is it?\"  \"Did you _know_ the boat-house was burned up?\"  There was no answer; and Noddy ran down to the place where the sail-boat was hauled up. He tried to look excited and indignant, and perhaps he succeeded; though, as the old man preserved his equanimity, he had no means of knowing what impression he had produced.  \"Did you know the boat-house was burned up?\" repeated Noddy, opening his eyes as though he had made a discovery of the utmost importance.  \"I did,\" replied Ben, as indifferently as though it had been a matter of no consequence whatever.  \"Why didn't you tell me about it?\" demanded Noddy, with becoming indignation.  \"Because I decided that I wouldn't say a word about it to any person,\" answered Ben.  \"How did it happen?\"  \"I haven't anything to say about it; so you mustn't ask me any questions.\"  \"Don't you know how it caught afire?\" persisted Noddy.  \"I've nothing to say on that subject.\"  Noddy was vexed and disheartened; but he felt that it would not be prudent to deny the charge of setting it on fire before he was accused, for that would certainly convict him. The old man was playing a deep game, and that annoyed him still more.  \"So you won't say anything about it, Ben?\" added he, seating himself on the pier.  \"Not a word, Noddy.\"  \"Well, I wouldn't if I were you,\" continued Noddy, lightly.  Ben took no notice of this sinister remark, thus exhibiting a presence of mind which completely balked his assailant.  \"I understand it all, Ben; and I don't blame you for not wanting to say anything about it. I suppose you will own up when Mr. Grant comes home to-night.\"  \"Don't be saucy, Noddy,\" said the old man, mildly.  \"So you smoked your pipe among the shavings, and set the boat-house afire--did you, Ben? Well, I am sorry for you, you are generally so careful; but I don't believe they will discharge you for it.\"  Ben was as calm and unruffled as a summer sea. Noddy knew that, under ordinary circumstances, the boatman would have come down upon him like a northeast gale, if he had dared to use such insulting language to him. He tried him on every tack, but not a word could he obtain which betrayed the opinion of the veteran, in regard to the origin of the fire. It was useless to resort to any more arts, and he gave up the point in despair. All the afternoon he wandered about the estate, and could think of nothing but the unhappy event of the morning. Fanny did not show herself, and he had no opportunity for further consultation.  About six o'clock Bertha returned with her father; and after tea they walked down to the river. Fanny complained of a headache, and did not go with them. It is more than probable that she was really afflicted, as she said; for she had certainly suffered enough to make her head ache. Of course the first thing that attracted the attention of Mr. Grant and his daughter was the pile of charred timbers that indicated the place where the boat-house had once stood.  \"How did that happen?\" asked Mr. Grant of Ben, who was on the pier.  \"I don't know how it happened,\" replied the boatman, who had found his tongue now, and proceeded to give his employer all the particulars of the destruction of the building, concluding with Noddy's energetic exclamation that he wished the boat-house was burned up.  \"But did Noddy set the building on fire?\" asked Bertha, greatly pained to hear this charge against her pupil.  \"I don't know, Miss Bertha. I went up to the house to get my morning instructions, as I always do, and left Noddy at work washing up the boat-house. I found you had gone to the city, and I went right out of the house, and was coming down here. I got in sight of the pier, and saw Miss Fanny come out of the boat-house.\"  \"Fanny?\"  \"Yes; I am sure it was her. I didn't mind where she went, for I happened to think the mainsail of the Greyhound wanted a little mending, and I went over to my room after some needles. While I was in my chamber, one of the gardeners rushed up to tell me the boat-house was afire. I came down, but 'twasn't no use; the building was most gone when I got here.\"  \"Did you leave anything in the building in the shape of matches, or anything else?\" asked Mr. Grant.  \"No, sir; I never do that,\" replied the old man, with a blush.  \"I know you are very careful, Ben. Then I suppose it was set on fire.\"  \"I suppose it was, sir.\"  \"Who do you suppose set it afire, Ben?\" said Bertha, anxiously.  \"Bless you, miss, I don't know.\"  \"Do you think it was Noddy?\"  \"No, Miss Bertha, I don't think it was.\"  \"Who could it have been?\"  \"That's more than I know. Here comes Noddy, and he can speak for himself.\"  Noddy had come forward for this purpose when he saw Mr. Grant and Bertha on the pier, and he had heard the last part of the conversation. He was not a little astonished to hear Ben declare his belief that he was not guilty, for he had been fully satisfied that he should have all the credit of the naughty transaction.  \"Do you know how the fire caught, Noddy?\" said Mr. Grant.  \"I reckon it caught from a bucket of water I left there,\" replied Noddy, who did not know what to say till he had felt his way a little.  \"No trifling, Noddy!\" added Mr. Grant, though he could hardly keep from laughing at the ridiculous answer.  \"How should I know, sir, when Ben don't know? I tried to make him tell me how it caught, and he wouldn't say a word about it.\"  \"I thought it was best for me to keep still,\" said Ben.  \"This is very strange,\" continued Mr. Grant. \"Who was the last person you saw in the boat-house, Ben?\"  \"Miss Fanny, sir. I saw her come out of it only a few moments before the fire broke out.\"  Noddy was appalled at this answer, for it indicated that Fanny was already suspected of the deed.  \"Of course Fanny would not do such a thing as set the boat-house on fire,\" said Bertha.  \"Of course she wouldn't,\" added Noddy.  \"What made you say you did not think Noddy set the fire, Ben?\" asked Mr. Grant.  \"Because I think he had gone off somewhere before the fire, and that Miss Fanny was in the building after he was. Noddy was sculling off before he had done his work, and I called him back. That's when he wished the boat-house was burned down.\"  \"It is pretty evident that the fire was set by Noddy or Fanny,\" said Mr. Grant; and he appeared to have no doubt as to which was the guilty one, for he looked very sternly at the wayward boy before him.  \"I think so, sir,\" added Ben.  \"And you say that it was not Noddy?\" continued Mr. Grant, looking exceedingly troubled as he considered the alternative.  The boatman bowed his head in reply, as though his conclusion was so serious and solemn that he could not express it in words. Noddy looked from Ben to Mr. Grant, and from Mr. Grant to Ben again. It was plain enough what they meant, and he had not even been suspected of the crime. The boatman had seen Fanny come"]]]
