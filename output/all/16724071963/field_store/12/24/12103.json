Whenever you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a tramp and a wanderer on the earth.\"  Then Cain said to Jehovah, \"My punishment is more than I can bear. See, thou hast driven me out to-day from this land, and I shall no longer be able to worship thee; I shall become a tramp and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.\"  But Jehovah said to him, \"If any one kills you, he shall be punished sevenfold.\" So Jehovah placed a mark on Cain, to keep any one who found him from killing him. And Cain went out from Jehovah's presence and lived as a wanderer, away from Eden.     NOAH AND THE GREAT FLOOD   When Jehovah saw that men were growing more wicked in the world and that their thoughts were always evil, he was greatly grieved and regretted that he had made man. Therefore, Jehovah said, \"I will completely destroy all living beings from off the earth, for I regret that I have made them.\"  But Noah had won Jehovah's favor. So Jehovah said to Noah, \"I have decided to put an end to all living beings, for the earth is filled with their wicked acts. I am going to destroy them from the earth. Make yourself an ark of cypress wood. Build rooms in the ark, and cover it within and without with pitch. This is how you shall build it: the ark shall be five hundred feet long, eighty feet wide, and fifty feet high. Make a roof for it and place the door on the side. Build it with lower, second, and third stories. For I am about to bring floods of water upon the earth to destroy every living creature in which is the breath of life. Every creature that is on the earth shall die.\"  Then Jehovah said to Noah, \"Enter with all your household into the ark, for I see that of all the people who are now alive you alone are upright. Of all the beasts that are fit for food and sacrifice you shall take with you seven, the male and the female; but of the beasts that are not fit for food and sacrifice two, the male and the female; and of the wild birds that are fit for food and sacrifice seven, to keep each kind alive on all the earth. After seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy every living thing that I have made.\"  Then Noah did all that Jehovah commanded him. When the waters of the flood came upon the earth, he, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, together with the beasts that were fit for food and sacrifice and the beasts that were not fit, and the birds, and everything that creeps upon the ground, entered the ark because of the waters of the flood.  The rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and Jehovah shut Noah in the ark. And the waters rose higher and higher and raised up the ark, and it was lifted high above the earth. All creatures living on the land died. Noah only was left and they who were with him in the ark.  Then God remembered Noah and all the beasts and all the animals that were with him in the ark. And God caused a wind to blow over the earth, and the flood went down, the rain from heaven ceased, and the waters withdrew more and more from the land.  After forty days Noah opened the window of the ark and sent out a raven; and it kept going to and fro until the waters were dried up on the earth. He also sent out a dove to see if the waters had gone from the surface of the earth. But the dove found no rest for her foot, and so returned to him to the ark, for the waters covered the whole earth. Therefore, Noah reached out his hand and took her and brought her back into the ark.  Then he waited seven days longer and again sent out the dove from the ark. And the dove came in to him at dusk; and in her mouth was a freshly plucked olive-leaf. So Noah knew that the waters had gone from the earth. And he waited seven days more and again sent out the dove, but it did not return to him.  So Noah took off the covering of the ark and looked and saw that the surface of the ground was dry. Then he, with his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives, went out of the ark.  And Noah built an altar to Jehovah and took one of every beast and bird that was fit for sacrifice and offered burnt-offerings on the altar. And Jehovah said to himself, \"I will never again condemn the ground because of man, nor will I again destroy every living creature, as I have done. While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.\"  And God said, \"This is the sign of the solemn agreement that I make for all time between me and you and every living creature that is with you: I have placed my rainbow in the cloud and it shall be the sign of the solemn agreement between me and the people who live on the earth. Whenever I bring a cloud over the earth and the rainbow is seen in the cloud, I will remember the agreement which is between me and you and every living creature; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy them.\"     THE STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL   All the people of the earth spoke one language; and as they travelled westward, they found a broad valley in the land of Babylonia, and made their home there.  Then they said one to another, \"Come, let us make bricks and thoroughly bake them.\" So they had bricks for stone and asphalt for mortar. And they said, \"Come, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top will touch the heavens, and thus make a landmark, that we may not be scattered over all the earth.\"  But when Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower men had built, he said, \"See, they are one people and all have one language. This is but the beginning, and now nothing which they plan to do will seem too difficult for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language, that they may not understand one another.\"  So Jehovah scattered them from there over all the earth; and they stopped building the city. Therefore they named it Babel, which means Confusion, for there Jehovah confused the language of all the people on the earth and scattered them over the whole world.   ABRAHAM, THE FRIEND OF GOD AND MAN  The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham and Japheth. Terah, a descendant of Shem, was the father of Abraham, Nahor and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.  Jehovah said to Abraham, \"Go from your country, your relatives, and your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make of you a great nation; and I will surely bless you and make your name famous, so that you shall be a blessing. And all the families of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like your own.\"  So Abraham set out, as Jehovah had commanded him; and Lot went with him. Abraham was seventy-five years old when he left Haran. He took Sarah his wife and Lot his brother's son and everything that they had, and started for the land of Canaan.  Abraham passed through the land to a place called Shechem, to the oak of Moreh. There Jehovah appeared to Abraham and said, \"To your children will I give this land.\" There Abraham built an altar to Jehovah who had appeared to him. From there he removed to the hill near Bethel and pitched his tent with Bethel on one side and Ai on the other, and there too he built an altar to Jehovah and prayed to him.  Now Abraham was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold; Lot also, who went with Abraham, had so many flocks and herds and tents that the land was not rich enough to support them both. So when there was a quarrel between Lot's herdsmen and Abraham's herdsmen, Abraham said to Lot, \"I beg of you, let there be no quarrel between me and you, nor between my herdsmen and yours, for we are relatives. Is not the whole land before you? I beg of you, separate yourself from me. If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; or if you go to the right, then I will go to the left.\"  [Illustration: _Building the Tower of Babel_  Painted by J. James Tissot]  So Lot looked about and saw that all the plain of the Jordan, as far as Zoar, was well watered everywhere, like a garden of Jehovah. So Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and lived in the cities of the plain and moved his tent as far as Sodom. But the men of Sodom were very wicked and sinned against Jehovah.  Jehovah said to Abraham, after Lot had gone away from him, \"Lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are northward, southward, eastward and westward, for all the land that you see I will give to you and to your children forever. I will make them as many as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can count the dust of the earth, then your children may also be counted. Rise, walk through the length and breadth of the land, for I will give it to you.\"  Then Abraham moved his tent and lived in the oak grove of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to Jehovah.  Jehovah also appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as he was sitting at the entrance of his tent in the heat of the day; and, as he looked up, three men stood there before him. As soon as he saw them, he ran from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed to the ground and said, \"Sirs, if you are willing to do me a favor, do not, I beg of you, pass by your servant. Since you have come to your servant, let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet, and lie down under the tree. And let me bring some food, that you may refresh yourselves; afterward you may go on your way.\" They replied, \"Do as you have said.\"  So Abraham hastened to Sarah's tent and said, \"Make ready quickly four measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.\" Abraham also ran to the herd, and took a calf that was tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he prepared it quickly. Then Abraham took curd and milk, with the calf which he had prepared, and served them; and he waited on them under the tree, while they ate.  Then they said to him, \"Where is your wife?\" He said, \"There, within the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23580"],["title","The Children's Bible (#4)"],["body","nt.\" One of them said, \"I will surely return to you about nine months from now, and then, Sarah your wife shall have a son.\"   LOT'S ESCAPE FROM A WICKED CITY  And Abraham went along with them to start them on their way. Jehovah said, \"The complaint has come that the people of Sodom and Gomorrah have committed great and terrible sins. I will go down and see whether they have done exactly as the complaint comes to me; and if they have not, I will know.\"  Then the men turned from there and looked off in the direction of Sodom.  Then Abraham drew near to Jehovah and said, \"Wilt thou sweep away the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are within the city fifty people who are righteous. Wilt thou sweep away and not spare the place for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from thee to do this: to slay the righteous with the wicked! And that the righteous should be treated as the wicked, far be it from thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?\" Jehovah said, \"If I find in the city of Sodom fifty who are righteous, I will spare the whole place for their sake.\" Abraham answered, \"I have dared to speak to Jehovah, even though I am but dust and ashes. Suppose there be five lacking of the fifty righteous. Wilt thou sweep away all the city for lack of five?\" Jehovah said, \"I will not sweep it away, if I find forty-five there.\"  Then Abraham spoke to him again, and said, \"Suppose forty are found there?\" He replied, \"For the sake of forty I will not do it.\" Then Abraham said, \"Oh, let not Jehovah be angry, but let me speak. Suppose thirty are found there?\" He answered, \"I will not do it, if I find thirty there.\" Then Abraham said, \"Thou seest that I have dared to speak to Jehovah. Suppose twenty are found there?\" He replied, \"For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it.\" Then Abraham said, \"Oh, let not Jehovah be angry, but let me speak just once more. Suppose ten are found there?\" And he said, \"For the sake of the ten I will not destroy it.\" Then Jehovah went his way, and Abraham returned home.  Two angels in human form came to Sodom in the evening, as Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose up to meet them, and he bowed with his face to the earth and said, \"Sirs, turn aside, I beg of you, into your servant's house and spend the night and wash your feet; then you can rise up early and go on your way.\" They said, \"No, we will spend the night in the street.\" But he urged them so strongly that they went with him and entered his house. And he made a feast for them and baked bread made without yeast, and they ate.  But before they had lain down, the people of Sodom, both young and old, all the people from every quarter, surrounded the house. And they called out to Lot, \"Where are the men who came in to you to-night? Bring them out to us that we may do to them what we desire.\"  Then Lot went out to them at the entrance of his house, but he shut the door after him. And he said, \"I beg of you, my friends, do not do what is wrong. Do nothing to these men, for they have come under the shadow of my roof.\" But they replied, \"Stand back, or we will treat you worse than them.\" And they pressed hard against Lot and advanced to break the door. But the men reached out and drew Lot to them into the house and shut the door. Then they smote the men who were at the door of the house, both small and great, with blindness, so that they grew tired of searching for the door.  Then the men said to Lot, \"Have you any one else here? Bring your sons-in-law, your sons, and daughters, and whoever you have in the city out of this place, for we are about to destroy it, because great complaint concerning the people has come to Jehovah and he has sent us to destroy it.\" So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, \"Up, go out of this place, for Jehovah will destroy the city.\" But his sons-in-law thought he was only jesting.  When the dawn appeared, the angels urged Lot, saying, \"Get up, take your wife and your two daughters that you may not be swept away in the punishment of the city.\" When he hesitated, the men took him by the hand and led him and his wife and his two daughters outside the city, for Jehovah was merciful to him.  When they had brought them outside, they said, \"Run for your life; do not look behind you nor stay anywhere in the plain. Escape to the heights, that you may not be swept away!\" But Lot said to them, \"Oh, sirs, not so! See, your servant has found favor with you, and you have shown great mercy to me in saving my life. I cannot escape to the heights, lest some evil overtake me, and I die. See now, this village is near enough to run to, and it is small. Oh, let me escape there, and my life will be saved.\" Jehovah said to him, \"I have also granted you this favor, in that I will not destroy the village of which you have spoken. Make haste, escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there.\"  The sun had risen when Lot came to Zoar. Then Jehovah caused brimstone and fire from heaven to rain upon Sodom and Gomorrah, and he destroyed those cities and all the plain, with all the people who lived in it and all that grew on the ground. But Lot's wife, who was following him, looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.  Early in the morning Abraham rose and went to the place where he had stood before Jehovah; and as he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the plain, he saw the smoke of the land going up as the smoke of a smelting-furnace.   GOD'S CARE FOR THE BOY ISHMAEL  Jehovah remembered what he had told Sarah, and he did as he had promised. So Sarah had a son, and when the child grew up, Abraham made a great feast on the day that he was weaned. But Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian and of Abraham playing with her son Isaac. And she said to Abraham, \"Drive out this slave girl and her son, for the son of this slave girl shall not be heir with my son Isaac.\" This request was very displeasing to Abraham because the boy was his son. But Jehovah said to Abraham, \"Do not be displeased because of the boy and because of your slave girl. Listen to all that Sarah says to you, for Isaac only and his children shall bear your name. But I will also make of the son of the slave girl a great nation, because he is your son.\"  Then Abraham rose early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar; and he put the boy upon her shoulder and sent her away. So she set out and wandered in the desert of Beersheba. When the water in the skin was gone, she left the child under one of the desert shrubs and went a short distance away and sat down opposite him, for she said, \"Let me not see the child die.\"  While she sat there, the boy began to cry; and Jehovah heard the cry of the boy, and said, \"What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for Jehovah has heard the cry of the boy. Rise, lift him up, and hold him fast by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.\" And Jehovah opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. Then she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.  And Jehovah cared for the boy; and when he grew up, he lived in the wilderness of Paran and became a bowman. And his mother secured a wife for him from Egypt.   ABRAHAM'S LOYALTY TO GOD  Later Jehovah tested Abraham, saying to him, \"Abraham\"; and he answered, \"Here am I.\" Jehovah said, \"Take your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt-offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.\"  [Illustration: © _Curtis Publishing Company_  _Hagar and Ishmael in the Wilderness_ Painted by W. L. Taylor]  So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his servants with him, and his son Isaac. When he had split the wood for the burnt-offering, he set out for the place of which God had told him. On the third day, when Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance, he said to his servants, \"Stay here with the ass, while I and the lad go over there. When we have worshipped, we will come back to you.\"  Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt-offering and laid it on Isaac, his son. And he took the fire and the knife, and they both went on together. And Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, \"My father!\" and Abraham answered, \"Yes, my son.\" Isaac said, \"Here is the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?\" Abraham answered, \"My son, God will himself provide a lamb for a burnt-offering.\" So the two went on together.  When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built the altar there and laid the wood on it and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood. Then Abraham reached out his hand, and took the knife to kill his son. But the angel of Jehovah called to him from heaven, saying, \"Abraham, Abraham!\" and he answered, \"Here am I.\" And he said, \"Do not put your hand upon the boy, nor do anything to him, for now I know that you love God, for you have not refused to give your son, your only son, to him.\"  Then Abraham looked up, and he saw a ram caught in the thicket by his horns. So Abraham took the ram and offered him up as a burnt-offering instead of his son. And he named the place Jehovah-jireh, which means, \"Jehovah will Provide.\"  The angel of Jehovah again called to Abraham and said, \"Jehovah declares, 'Because you have done this thing and have not kept back your son, your only son, I will surely bless you, and I will make your children as many as the stars of the heavens and as the sand, which is on the seashore, so that they shall conquer their enemies, and all the nations of the earth shall ask for themselves a blessing like theirs, because you have obeyed my command.'\"   HOW REBEKAH BECAME THE WIFE OF ISAAC  When Abraham was very old and Jehovah had blessed him in every way, Abraham said to the eldest of his household servants, who had charge of all his affairs, \"Put your hand under my hip, while I make you promise by Jehovah, the God of "]]]
