I ne'er     Can see a smile, unless in some broad banquet's     Intoxicating glare, when the buffoons                              440     Have gorged themselves up to equality,     Or I have quaffed me down to their abasement.     Myrrha, I can hear all these things, these names,     Lord--King--Sire--Monarch--nay, time was I prized them;     That is, I suffered them--from slaves and nobles;     But when they falter from the lips I love,     The lips which have been pressed to mine, a chill     Comes o'er my heart, a cold sense of the falsehood     Of this my station, which represses feeling     In those for whom I have felt most, and makes me                   450     Wish that I could lay down the dull tiara,     And share a cottage on the Caucasus     With thee--and wear no crowns but those of flowers.      _Myr._ Would that we could!      _Sar._                     And dost _thou_ feel this?--Why?      _Myr._ Then thou wouldst know what thou canst never know.      _Sar._ And that is----      _Myr._                  The true value of a heart;     At least, a woman's.      _Sar._               I have proved a thousand--A     thousand, and a thousand.      _Myr._                   Hearts?      _Sar._                          I think so.      _Myr._ Not one! the time may come thou may'st.      _Sar._                                          It will.     Hear, Myrrha; Salemenes has declared--                             460     Or why or how he hath divined it, Belus,     Who founded our great realm, knows more than I--     But Salemenes hath declared my throne     In peril.      _Myr._    He did well.      _Sar._                And say'st _thou_ so?     Thou whom he spurned so harshly, and now dared[g]     Drive from our presence with his savage jeers,     And made thee weep and blush?      _Myr._                        I should do both     More frequently, and he did well to call me     Back to my duty. But thou spakest of peril     Peril to thee----      _Sar._            Aye, from dark plots and snares                  470     From Medes--and discontented troops and nations.     I know not what--a labyrinth of things--     A maze of muttered threats and mysteries:     Thou know'st the man--it is his usual custom.     But he is honest. Come, we'll think no more on't--     But of the midnight festival.      _Myr._                       'Tis time     To think of aught save festivals. Thou hast not     Spurned his sage cautions?      _Sar._                     What?--and dost thou fear?      _Myr._ Fear!--I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death?     A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom?                  480      _Sar._ Then wherefore dost thou turn so pale?      _Myr._                                         I love.      _Sar._ And do not I? I love thee far--far more     Than either the brief life or the wide realm,     Which, it may be, are menaced;--yet I blench not.      _Myr._ That means thou lovest nor thyself nor me;     For he who loves another loves himself,     Even for that other's sake. This is too rash:     Kingdoms and lives are not to be so lost.      _Sar._ Lost!--why, who is the aspiring chief who dared     Assume to win them?      _Myr._             Who is he should dread                          490     To try so much? When he who is their ruler     Forgets himself--will they remember him?      _Sar._ Myrrha!      _Myr._        Frown not upon me: you have smiled     Too often on me not to make those frowns     Bitterer to bear than any punishment     Which they may augur.--King, I am your subject!     Master, I am your slave! Man, I have loved you!--     Loved you, I know not by what fatal weakness,     Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs--     A slave, and hating fetters--an Ionian,                            500     And, therefore, when I love a stranger, more     Degraded by that passion than by chains!     Still I have loved you. If that love were strong     Enough to overcome all former nature,     Shall it not claim the privilege to save you?      _Sar._ _Save_ me, my beauty! Thou art very fair,     And what I seek of thee is love--not safety.      _Myr._ And without love where dwells security?      _Sar._ I speak of woman's love.      _Myr._                         The very first     Of human life must spring from woman's breast,                     510     Your first small words are taught you from her lips,     Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs     Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,     When men have shrunk from the ignoble care     Of watching the last hour of him who led them.      _Sar._ My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music:     The very chorus of the tragic song     I have heard thee talk of as the favourite pastime     Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not--calm thee.      _Myr._ I weep not.--But I pray thee, do not speak                  520     About my fathers or their land.      _Sar._                          Yet oft     Thou speakest of them.      _Myr._                 True--true: constant thought     Will overflow in words unconsciously;     But when another speaks of Greeks, it wounds me.      _Sar._ Well, then, how wouldst thou _save_ me, as thou saidst?      _Myr._ By teaching thee to save thyself, and not     Thyself alone, but these vast realms, from all     The rage of the worst war--the war of brethren.      _Sar._ Why, child, I loathe all war, and warriors;     I live in peace and pleasure: what can man                         530     Do more?      _Myr._       Alas! my Lord, with common men     There needs too oft the show of war to keep     The substance of sweet peace; and, for a king,     'Tis sometimes better to be feared than loved.      _Sar._ And I have never sought but for the last.      _Myr._ And now art neither.      _Sar._                      Dost _thou_ say so, Myrrha?      _Myr._ I speak of civic popular love, _self_-love,     Which means that men are kept in awe and law,     Yet not oppressed--at least they must not think so,     Or, if they think so, deem it necessary,                           540     To ward off worse oppression, their own passions.     A King of feasts, and flowers, and wine, and revel,     And love, and mirth, was never King of Glory.      _Sar._ Glory! what's that?      _Myr._                     Ask of the Gods thy fathers.      _Sar._ They cannot answer; when the priests speak for them,     'Tis for some small addition to the temple.      _Myr._ Look to the annals of thine Empire's founders.      _Sar._ They are so blotted o'er with blood, I cannot.     But what wouldst have? the Empire _has been_ founded.     I cannot go on multiplying empires.                                550      _Myr._ Preserve thine own.      _Sar._                     At least, I will enjoy it.     Come, Myrrha, let us go on to the Euphrates:     The hour invites, the galley is prepared,     And the pavilion, decked for our return,     In fit adornment for the evening banquet,     Shall blaze with beauty and with light, until     It seems unto the stars which are above us     Itself an opposite star; and we will sit     Crowned with fresh flowers like----      _Myr._                             Victims.      _Sar._                                     No, like sovereigns,     The Shepherd Kings of patriarchal times,                           560     Who knew no brighter gems than summer wreaths,[h]     And none but tearless triumphs. Let us on.                                _Enter_ PANIA.      _Pan._ May the King live for ever!      _Sar._                           Not an hour     Longer than he can love. How my soul hates     This language, which makes life itself a lie,     Flattering dust with eternity.[i] Well, Pania!     Be brief.      _Pan._      I am charged by Salemenes to     Reiterate his prayer unto the King,     That for this day, at least, he will not quit     The palace: when the General returns,                              570     He will adduce such reasons as will warrant     His daring, and perhaps obtain the pardon     Of his presumption.      _Sar._               What! am I then cooped?     Already captive? can I not even breathe     The breath of heaven? Tell prince Salemenes,     Were all Assyria raging round the walls     In mutinous myriads, I would still go forth.      _Pan._ I must obey, and yet----      _Myr._                        Oh, Monarch, listen.--     How many a day and moon thou hast reclined     Within these palace walls in silken dalliance,                     580     And never shown thee to thy people's longing;     Leaving thy subjects' eyes ungratified,     The satraps uncontrolled, the Gods unworshipped,     And all things in the anarchy of sloth,     Till all, save evil, slumbered through the realm!     And wilt thou not now tarry for a day,--     A day which may redeem thee? Wilt thou not     Yield to the few still faithful a few hours,     For them, for thee, for thy past fathers' race,     And for thy sons' inheritance?      _Pan._                         'Tis true!                          590     From the deep urgency with which the Prince     Despatched me to your sacred presence, I     Must dare to add my feeble voice to that     Which now has spoken.      _Sar._               No, it must not be.      _Myr._ For the sake of thy realm!      _Sar._                             Away!      _Pan._                                 For that     Of all"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23475"],["title","The Works of Lord Byron.

Well, for thy sake, I yield me. Pania, hence!     Thou hear'st me.      _Pan._           And obey.                              [_Exit_ PANIA.      _Sar._                    I marvel at thee.     What is thy motive, Myrrha, thus to urge me?      _Myr._ Thy safety; and the certainty that nought     Could urge the Prince thy kinsman to require     Thus much from thee, but some impending danger.      _Sar._ And if I do not dread it, why shouldst thou?      _Myr._ Because _thou_ dost not fear, I fear for _thee_.            620      _Sar._ To-morrow thou wilt smile at these vain fancies.      _Myr._ If the worst come, I shall be where none weep,     And that is better than the power to smile.     And thou?      _Sar._    I shall be King, as heretofore.      _Myr._ Where?      _Sar._         With Baal, Nimrod, and Semiramis,     Sole in Assyria, or with them elsewhere.     Fate made me what I am--may make me nothing--     But either that or nothing must I be:     I will not live degraded.      _Myr._                    Hadst thou felt     Thus always, none would ever dare degrade thee.                    630      _Sar._ And who will do so now?      _Myr._                        Dost thou suspect none?      _Sar._ Suspect!--that's a spy's office. Oh! we lose     Ten thousand precious moments in vain words,     And vainer fears. Within there!--ye slaves, deck     The Hall of Nimrod for the evening revel;     If I must make a prison of our palace,     At least we'll wear our fetters jocundly;     If the Euphrates be forbid us, and     The summer-dwelling on its beauteous border,     Here we are still unmenaced. Ho! within there!                     640                                                      [_Exit_ SARDANAPALUS.      _Myr._ (_solus_).     Why do I love this man? My country's daughters     Love none but heroes. But I have no country!     The slave hath lost all save her bonds. I love him;     And that's the heaviest link of the long chain--     To love whom we esteem not. Be it so:     The hour is coming when he'll need all love,     And find none. To fall from him now were baser     Than to have stabbed him on his throne when highest     Would have been noble in my country's creed:     I was not made for either. Could I save him,                       650     I should not love _him_ better, but myself;     And I have need of the last, for I have fallen     In my own thoughts, by loving this soft stranger:     And yet, methinks, I love him more, perceiving     That he is hated of his own barbarians,     The natural foes of all the blood of Greece.     Could I but wake a single thought like those     Which even the Phrygians felt when battling long     'Twixt Ilion and the sea, within his heart,     He would tread down the barbarous crowds, and triumph.             660     He loves me, and I love him; the slave loves     Her master, and would free him from his vices.     If not, I have a means of freedom still,     And if I cannot teach him how to reign,     May show him how alone a King can leave     His throne. I must not lose him from my sight.                [_Exit_.                                       ACT II.             SCENE I.--_The Portal of the same Hall of the Palace_.      _Beleses_ (_solus_).     The Sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly,     Taking his last look of Assyria's Empire.     How red he glares amongst those deepening clouds,     Like the blood he predicts. If not in vain,     Thou Sun that sinkest, and ye stars which rise,     I have outwatched ye, reading ray by ray     The edicts of your orbs, which make Time tremble[j]     For what he brings the nations, 'tis the furthest     Hour of Assyria's years. And yet how calm!     An earthquake should announce so great a fall--                     10     A summer's sun discloses it. Yon disk,     To the star-read Chaldean, bears upon     Its everlasting page the end of what     Seemed everlasting; but oh! thou true Sun!     The burning oracle of all that live,     As fountain of all life, and symbol of     Him who bestows it, wherefore dost thou limit     Thy lore unto calamity? Why not     Unfold the rise of days more worthy thine     All-glorious burst from ocean? why not dart                         20     A beam of hope athwart the future years,     As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me!     I am thy worshipper, thy priest, thy servant--     I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall,     And bowed my head beneath thy mid-day beams,     When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watched     For thee, and after thee, and prayed to thee,     And sacrificed to thee, and read, and feared thee,     And asked of thee, and thou hast answered--but     Only to thus much: while I speak, he sinks--                        30     Is gone--and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge,     To the delighted West, which revels in     Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is     Death, so it be but glorious? 'Tis a sunset;     And mortals may be happy to resemble     The Gods but in decay.                      _Enter_ ARBACES _by an inner door_.      _Arb._                Beleses, why     So wrapt in thy devotions? Dost thou stand     Gazing to trace thy disappearing God     Into some realm of undiscovered day?     Our business is with night--'tis come.      _Bel._                               But not                        40     Gone.      _Arb._    Let it roll on--we are ready.      _Bel._                                 Yes.     Would it were over!      _Arb._              Does the prophet doubt,     To whom the very stars shine Victory?      _Bel._ I do not doubt of Victory--but the Victor.      _Arb._ Well, let thy science settle that. Meantime     I have prepared as many glittering spears     As will out-sparkle our allies--your planets.     There is no more to thwart us. The she-king,     That less than woman, is even now upon     The waters with his female mates. The order                         50     Is issued for the feast in the pavilion.     The first cup which he drains will be the last     Quaffed by the line of Nimrod.      _Bel._                         'Twas a brave one.      _Arb._ And is a weak one--'tis worn out--we'll mend it.      _Bel._ Art sure of that?      _Arb._                    Its founder was a hunter--     I am a soldier--what is there to fear?      _Bel._ The soldier.      _Arb._              And the priest, it may be: but     If you thought thus, or think, why not retain     Your king of concubines? why stir me up?     Why spur me to this enterprise? your own                            60     No less than mine?      _Bel._            Look to the sky!      _Arb._                            I look.      _Bel._ What seest thou?      _Arb._                  A fair summer's twilight, and     The gathering of the stars.      _Bel._                      And midst them, mark     Yon earliest, and the brightest, which so quivers,     As it would quit its place in the blue ether.      _Arb._ Well?      _Bel._      'Tis thy natal ruler--thy birth planet.      _Arb._ (_touching his scabbard_).     My star is in this scabbard: when it shines,     It shall out-dazzle comets. Let us think     Of what is to be done to justify     Thy planets and their portents. When we conquer,                    70     They shall have temples--aye, and priests--and thou     Shalt be the pontiff of--what Gods thou wilt;     For I observe that they are ever just,     And own the bravest for the most devout.      _Bel._ Aye, and the most devout for brave--thou hast not     Seen me turn back from battle.      _Arb._                         No; I own thee     As firm in fight as Babylonia's captain,     As skilful in Chaldea's worship: now,     Will it but please thee to forget the priest,     And be the warrior?      _Bel._              Why not both?      _Arb._                           The better;                        80     And yet it almost shames me, we shall have     So little to effect. This woman's warfare     Degrades the very conqueror.
