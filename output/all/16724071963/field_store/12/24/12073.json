SUMMARY: A collection of forty-seven poems about subjects and experiences familiar to children.  [1. English poetry]  I. Title.  II. Series. [PR6007.E3S6 1976]   821'.9'12  75-32200 ISBN 0-8240-2310-2  _Printed in the United States of America_     _Preface_   The Romantic poets rediscovered a pastoral and Biblical dream: that a child was the most innocent and the wisest of us all. Wordsworth hailed him as \"Mighty Prophet! Seer blest!\" And in the next generation Victorian novelists took that dream seriously enough to make children the heroes and heroines of their most searching fictions. There had been no \"children's literature\" to speak of before, except for the oral and \"popular\" tradition, including lullabies and _Mother Goose_, some of which go back as far as Tudor and even medieval times.  Children's literature today is an immense and complex domain; and leaving aside for the present the works composed by children themselves, what remains varies tremendously in skill and delight, as well as in subtlety and intention. So I shall also set aside those minimal \"vocabulary-building\" tales and verses whose small virtues are rarely more than therapeutic, and direct myself only to that specialized but most important category--poems written by a skilled and adult poet but addressed to an audience of children who are likely to be read to until they are skillful enough to read the same verses for themselves.  The dangers for the poet in addressing so composite an audience are enormous: cuteness, coyness, archness and condescension are only the most obvious ones. Some great writers of children's verse--Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear--have successfully hedged themselves against these dangers by insistent comedy and parody (Carroll's \"serious\" children's verse is maudlin and embarrassing). By this means they have contrived what the child will take as lovely, unintimidating, mysterious, rational nonsense, and what the adult will recognize as a travesty or burlesque of something very edgy indeed. Thus, Lear's \"The Dong with the Luminous Nose\" and Carroll's \"Jabberwocky\" are, respectively, bright and disguised versions of gothic terror and misery on the one hand, and medieval knightly exploit on the other, both rendered innocuous for the nursery and ridiculous for the adult. The risks of seriousness have been successfully avoided.  The poetry of Walter de la Mare sings boldly and beautifully without any of these hedges and condescensions. His work has the honest candor of the border ballads and the fairy tales: as well as unmitigated joys, they are full of the dangers and horrors and sorrows that every child soon knows to be part of the world, however vainly parents try to veil them. A child's curiosity about the forbidden will insist on being satisfied; and better by verse than otherwise. This poetry is also musically astute and demanding; it may surprise and alert the parental reader; and it has its share of archaisms and poeticisms, which, contrary to adult surmise, bemuse and fascinate children. And it must be admitted that it is also relentlessly British; but then, so is much good children's literature.  As a poet (he was also a gifted novelist and short-story writer) de la Mare was praised by T. S. Eliot (\"the delicate, invisible web you wove\") and by W. H. Auden (\"there are no good poems which are only for children\"). His technical and linguistic skills are not, as Auden rightly points out, a matter of indifference to children, who are in the very business of learning language, as well as other facts of life, and who are particularly sensitive to verbal rhythms, as Iona and Peter Opie have splendidly demonstrated in _The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren_.  Just as important, this is a poetry of charms and spells, witches and dwarfs, ogres and fairies, full of dangers, omens, riddles and triumphs. In \"The Ogre,\" for example, two sleeping children are about to be plucked by an enormous ogre from their home:      Into their dreams no shadow fell       Of his disastrous thumb     Groping discreet, and gradual,       Across the quiet room.  But he is stopped, spellbound, abashed and defeated by the mother of the children, who is in another room and, all unaware of the danger, is singing a version of the Coventry Carol (which, in its original, is addressed to the Christ Child) as a lullaby to her new-born baby.  I would guess that any child fortunate enough to grow up with these poems ringing in memory's ear might have a remarkable reservoir of music and excitement available to him. That is not a small gift.  Anthony Hecht   _ANTHONY HECHT teaches in the English Department of the University of Rochester.

I looked out of window in the white moonlight,     The trees were like snow in the wood--           'Come away           Child and play,           Light wi' the gnomies;           In a mound,           Green and round,           That's where their home is!           'Honey sweet,           Curds to eat,           Cream and frumènty,           Shells and beads,           Poppy seeds,           You shall have plenty.'      But soon as I stooped in the dim moonlight     To put on my stocking and my shoe,     The sweet, sweet singing died sadly away,     And the light of the morning peep'd through:     Then instead of the gnomies there came a red robin     To sing of the buttercups and dew.         BLUEBELLS       Where the bluebells and the wind are,     Fairies in a ring I spied,     And I heard a little linnet     Singing near beside.      Where the primrose and the dew are,     Soon were sped the fairies all:     Only now the green turf freshens,     And the linnets call.         LOVELOCKS       I watched the Lady Caroline     Bind up her dark and beauteous hair;     Her face was rosy in the glass,     And 'twixt the coils her hands would pass,         White in the candleshine.      Her bottles on the table lay,     Stoppered yet sweet of violet;     Her image in the mirror stooped     To view those locks as lightly looped         As cherry-boughs in May.      The snowy night lay dim without,     I heard the Waits their sweet song sing;     The window smouldered keen with frost;     Yet still she twisted, sleeked and tossed         Her beauteous hair about.         O DEAR ME!       Here are crocuses, white, gold, grey!       'O dear me!' says Marjorie May;     Flat as a platter the blackberry blows:       'O dear me!' says Madeleine Rose;     The leaves are fallen, the swallows flown:       'O dear me!' says Humphrey John;     Snow lies thick where all night it fell:       'O dear me!' says Emmanuel.         TARTARY       If I were Lord of Tartary,       Myself and me alone,     My bed should be of ivory,       Of beaten gold my throne;     And in my court should peacocks flaunt,     And in my forests tigers haunt,     And in my pools great fishes slant       Their fins athwart the sun.      If I were Lord of Tartary,       Trumpeters every day     To all my meals should summon me,       And in my courtyards bray;     And in the evenings lamps should shine,     Yellow as honey, red as wine,     While harp, and flute, and mandoline,       Made music sweet and gay.      If I were Lord of Tartary,       I'd wear a robe of beads,     White, and gold, and green they'd be--       And small, and thick as seeds;     And ere should wane the morning-star,     I'd don my robe and scimitar,     And zebras seven should draw my car       Through Tartary's dark glades.      Lord of the fruits of Tartary,       Her rivers silver-pale!     Lord of the hills of Tartary,       Glen, thicket, wood, and dale!     Her flashing stars, her scented breeze,     Her trembling lakes, like foamless seas,     Her bird-delighting citron-trees       In every purple vale!         THE BUCKLE       I had a silver buckle,     I sewed it on my shoe,     And 'neath a sprig of mistletoe     I danced the evening through!      I had a bunch of cowslips,     I hid 'em in a grot,     In case the elves should come by night     And me remember not.      I had a yellow riband,     I tied it in my hair,     That, walking in the garden,     The birds might see it there.      I had a secret laughter,     I laughed it near the wall:     Only the ivy and the wind     May tell of it at all.         THE HARE       In the black furrow of a field     I saw an old witch-hare this night;     And she cocked her lissome ear,     And she eyed the moon so bright,     And she nibbled o' the green;     And I whispered 'Whsst! witch-hare,'     Away like a ghostie o'er the field     She fled, and left the moonlight there.         BUNCHES OF GRAPES       'Bunches of grapes,' says Timothy;     'Pomegranates pink,' says Elaine;     'A junket of cream and a cranberry tart       For me,' says Jane.      'Love-in-a-mist,' says Timothy;     'Primroses pale,' says Elaine;     'A nosegay of pinks and mignonette       For me,' says Jane.      'Chariots of gold,' says Timothy;     'Silvery wings,' says Elaine;     'A bumpity ride in a wagon of hay       For me,' says Jane.         JOHN MOULDY       I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,     Deep down twenty steps of stone;     In the dusk he sat a-smiling,       Smiling there alone.      He read no book, he snuffed no candle;     The rats ran in, the rats ran out;     And far and near, the drip of water       Went whisp'ring about.      The dusk was still, with dew a-falling,     I saw the Dog-star bleak and grim,     I saw a slim brown rat of Norway       Creep over him.      I spied John Mouldy in his cellar,     Deep down twenty steps of stone;     In the dusk he sat a-smiling,       Smiling there alone.         THE FLY       How large unto the tiny fly       Must little things appear!--     A rosebud like a feather bed,       Its prickle like a spear;      A dewdrop like a looking-glass,       A hair like golden wire;     The smallest grain of mustard-seed       As fierce as coals of fire;      A loaf of bread, a lofty hill;       A wasp, a cruel leopard;     And specks of salt as bright to see       As lambkins to a shepherd.         SONG       O for a moon to light me home!       O for a lanthorn green!     For those sweet stars the Pleiades,     That glitter in the twilight trees;       O for a lovelorn taper! O       For a lanthorn green!      O for a frock of tartan!       O for clear, wild, grey eyes!     For fingers light as violets,     'Neath branches that the blackbird frets;       O for a thistly meadow! O       For clear, wild grey eyes!      O for a heart like almond boughs!       O for sweet thoughts like rain!     O for first-love like fields of grey,     Shut April-buds at break of day!       O for a sleep like music!       For still dreams like rain!         I SAW THREE WITCHES       I saw three witches     That bowed down like barley,     And took to their brooms 'neath a louring sky,     And, mounting a storm-cloud,     Aloft on its margin,     Stood black in the silver as up they did fly.      I saw three witches     That mocked the poor sparrows     They carried in cages of wicker along,     Till a hawk from his eyrie     Swooped down like an arrow,     And smote on the cages, and ended their song.      I saw three witches     That sailed in a shallop,     All turning their heads with a truculent smile,     Till a bank of green osiers     Concealed their grim faces,     Though I heard them lamenting for many a mile.      I saw three witches     Asleep in a valley,     Their heads in a row, like stones in a flood,     Till the moon, creeping upward,     Looked white through the valley,     And turned them to bushes in bright scarlet bud.         THE SILVER PENNY       'Sailorman, I'll give to you       My bright silver penny,     If out to sea you'll sail me       And my dear sister Jenny.'      'Get in, young sir, I'll sail ye       And your dear sister Jenny,     But pay she shall her golden locks       Instead of your penny.'      They sail away, they sail away,       O fierce the winds blew!     The foam flew in clouds,       And dark the night grew!      And all the wild sea-water       Climbed steep into the boat;     Back to the shore again       Sail they will not.      Drowned is the sailorman,       Drowned is sweet Jenny,     And drowned in the deep sea       A bright silver penny.         THE NIGHT-SWANS       'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,     And silence in the air serene,     Save for the beating of her heart,     The lovely-eyed Evangeline.      She sings across the waters clear     And dark with trees and stars between,     The notes her fairy godmother     Taught her, the child Evangeline.      As might the unrippled pool reply,     Faltering an answer far and sweet,     Three swans as white as mountain snow     Swim mantling to her feet.      And still upon the lake they stay,     Their eyes black stars in all their snow,     And softly, in the glassy pool,     Their feet beat darkly to and fro.      She rides upon her little boat,     Her swans swim through the starry sheen,     Rowing her into Fairyland--     The lovely-eyed Evangeline.      'Tis silence on the enchanted lake,     And silence in the air serene;     Voices shall call in vain again     On earth the child Evangeline.      'Evangeline! Evangeline!'     Upstairs, downstairs, all in vain.     Her room is dim; her flowers faded;     She answers not again.         THE FAIRIES DANCING       I heard along the early hills,     Ere yet the lark was risen up,     Ere yet the dawn with firelight fills     The night-dew of the bramble-cup,--     I heard the fairies in a ring     Sing as they tripped a lilting round     Soft as the moon on wavering wing.     The starlight shook as if with sound,     As if with echoing, and the stars     Prankt their bright eyes with trembling gleams;     While red with war the gusty Mars     Rained upon earth his ruddy beams.     He shone alone, adown the West,     While I, behind a hawthorn-bush,     Watched on the fairies flaxen-tressed     The fires of the"]]]
