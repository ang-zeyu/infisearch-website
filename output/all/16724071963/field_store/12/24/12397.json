At the last census of the colony there were 76,000 adherents of the Church of England, 43,000 Roman Catholics, and 42,000 Methodists. Then came the Lutherans, with 20,000; Presbyterians, with 18,000; Baptists, with 14,000; and about 10,000 each of primitive Methodists, Congregationalists, and Bible Christians. There were several other denominations, but their numbers were insignificant. We looked for pagodas while driving along the street, but none of them were to be found, and we learned on inquiry that the number of Chinese and Moslems in South Australia was hardly worth mentioning. The colony has never been attractive to the Chinese, and few of them have endeavored to find homes there.  \"We drove to the resident portion of the city and saw a goodly number of private houses of the better sort. A great deal of taste has been displayed in the construction of these houses, and we derived the impression that Adelaide was a decidedly prosperous city. The wheat-growing industry of South Australia is a very large one. Many of the great farmers have their residences in Adelaide and spend only a small portion of their time on their farms, leaving all details to their managers. A considerable amount of American farming machinery finds its way to South Australia, where it has attained a well-deserved popularity.\"  While our friends were at breakfast the next morning, Harry suggested that if the others were willing, he would like to see one of the Australian prisons containing convicts that had been transported from England.  The doctor smiled,--just a faint smile,--while Ned laughed.  \"Oh, you are all wrong, Harry,\" said Ned. \"They gave up that business long ago. I was under the same impression that you are, but learned better from one of our fellow-passengers. I meant to tell you about it.\"  \"Well, I will acknowledge my mistake,\" said Harry. \"We are all liable to make blunders, and that is one of them.\"  \"Quite true,\" Dr. Whitney remarked. \"Every visitor to a country that is strange to him makes a great many mistakes, and the frank thing is to acknowledge it.\"  \"The gentleman who corrected my blunder,\" said Ned, \"told me that an American visitor who was very fond of hunting landed once in Sydney, fresh from the United States. The hunting fever was strong in him, and before he was an hour on shore he asked the clerk of the hotel where he could go to shoot Sydney ducks. He had heard of them, and would like to bag a few brace.\"  \"What is the point of the joke?\" said Harry; \"I confess I cannot see it.\"  \"That is exactly what I said to my informant,\" replied Ned, \"and then he went on and told me that in former times Australian convicts were spoken of as Sydney ducks.\"  \"Oh! I see,\" said Harry, \"that is a very good joke when you come to know all about it. What did the clerk of the hotel say to the inquiring stranger?\"  \"I don't know,\" replied Ned, \"but I presume he told him that Sydney ducks had gone out of fashion, and were not being shot any more. Probably he let the man down as gently as possible.\"  \"How did the convicts come to have the name of Sydney ducks?\" Harry asked.  \"I can't tell you, I am sure,\" said Ned, \"you will have to ask the doctor about it.\"  \"The name came, no doubt,\" said Dr. Whitney, \"from the circumstance that the first convicts who were brought to Australia were landed at Sydney, and for a good many years Sydney was the principal depot of these involuntary emigrants. The adoption of Australia as the place for convict settlement was brought about by events in America, a statement which may surprise you.\"  \"It certainly is surprising,\" Harry remarked. \"How did it happen?\"  \"It came about in this way,\" the doctor continued; \"when America was subject to England, offenders of various kinds, whether political or criminal, were sent to the American colonies, principally to the Southern States and the West Indies, where they were chiefly employed in the cultivation of tobacco. The consumption of tobacco in England was very large, and the revenue derived from it was considerable. Consequently England was able to kill two birds with one stone; she got rid of her criminals, at the same time, and made a large profit on their work.  \"When the American colonies revolted in 1775, and gained their independence eight years later, England found herself deprived of a place to which she could send her convicts, and she looked around for another. She tried the coast of Africa, and found it too unhealthy for her purpose. Captain Cook had recently visited Australia and given a glowing account of it, and the government officials thought that this new country would be an excellent one for criminals. Orders were given for sending out a fleet of ships for that purpose; and, accordingly, eleven vessels, carrying more than one thousand people, sailed for Portsmouth in the month of March, 1787, with orders to proceed to Australia.\"  \"If England had known what was to happen,\" said Harry, \"she need not have been at the trouble of sending her criminals so far away; she might have kept on with America with only slight interruptions. She is sending us her criminals and paupers at present, though she does not designate them properly when she ships them, and most of the continental nations are doing the same thing. We are trying to prevent it, but I don't believe we succeed to a very great extent.\"  \"Did they send a thousand convicts to Australia in this first batch?\" queried Ned.  \"There were about one thousand people altogether,\" said Dr. Whitney, \"including 757 convicts, and among the convicts were 190 women and eighteen children. They had 160 soldiers to guard the prisoners, with a sufficient number of officers, and forty of the soldiers were accompanied by their wives. They had on the ships a goodly quantity of cattle, sheep, horses, pigs, and goats, and a large quantity of seeds from various parts of the world was sent out. It was not expected that the colony would be self-supporting for some time, and so it was arranged that supply ships laden with flour and other provisions should be sent from England at regular intervals. A year or two after the colony was founded one of these ships was wrecked on its way to Australia, and the colonists suffered greatly for want of food. Among the supplies taken by each ship there was usually a fresh batch of convicts, and quite regularly convict ships were despatched from England to Australia.\"  Ned remarked that he thought a convict ship would not be a pleasant craft to travel on. A good many people did not like crossing the Atlantic on cattle ships, but he thought the cattle ship would be far preferable to one laden with convicts.  \"And so it is,\" replied the doctor. \"According to all accounts, the life on board a convict ship from England to Australia was terrible. Remember that in those days prisoners were treated with great harshness; they were not supposed to have any feelings and were never spoken to kindly, and in many instances an order was usually accompanied by a kick or a blow. During the voyage the prisoners were allowed on deck one hour or possibly two hours of each day, care being taken that only a small number would be there at any one time.  \"For the rest of the twenty-four hours they were shut up in close, stifling pens or cages, generally with nothing but a little straw to sleep on, and they were fed with the coarsest and poorest food. Coffee and tea with hard bread formed their breakfast; dinner was the same, with sometimes the addition of a piece of heavily salted beef, so hard that it was no easy matter to cut it into mouthfuls. Supper was the same as breakfast, and this was kept up with hardly any variation.  \"The slightest infraction of the rules was punished with the lash, but this did not deter the criminals from making trouble. Constantly the boatswain and his assistants were kept busy in performing the floggings that were ordered, and sometimes the cat-o'-nine-tails was in steady use from sunrise to sunset. The more severe his discipline, the more highly an officer was regarded by his superiors, and if he occasionally hanged a few men, it rather advanced than retarded his promotion. A good many died on the voyage from England to Australia, partly in consequence of their scanty fare and the great heat of the tropics; but, according to tradition, a very large proportion of the mortality was the result of brutal treatment and privations.  \"The passengers on the convict ship,\" said Harry, \"seem to have been treated pretty much like those on slave ships.\"  \"You are not far wrong there,\" the doctor replied; \"the sufferings of convicts on their way to Australia were not altogether unlike those of the unhappy negroes that were formerly taken from the coast of Africa to North and South America. The convicts were not crowded quite as densely into the holds of the ships as the slaves were, and the mortality among them was not as great; still they were packed very thickly together, and were treated quite as cruelly as the slave dealers used to treat their human property. Occasionally it happened that the convicts formed a conspiracy and endeavored to take possession of the ship. In nearly every instance they were betrayed by one of their number, and when the time came for action they were so closely guarded that any resistance was useless. Then the conspirators were seized, and after a brief trial were condemned to be hung or shot, generally the former, as it saved ammunition and did not soil the decks of the ship with blood. When there was an actual mutiny the mutineers were shot down without mercy, and those who escaped the bullets were speedily disposed of by hanging at the yard-arms.\"  \"Terrible times those must have been,\" remarked Ned; \"the wonder is that anybody survived.\"  \"Yes, indeed,\" said Harry; \"but man has a tough constitution and can endure a great deal.\"     CHAPTER IV.

[Henry] Spalding            London: Macmillan and Co.            1881           PREFACE         Eugene Onéguine, the chief poetical work of Russia’s greatest poet, having       been translated into all the principal languages of Europe except our own,       I hope that this version may prove an acceptable contribution to       literature. Tastes are various in matters of poetry, but the present work       possesses a more solid claim to attention in the series of faithful       pictures it offers of Russian life and manners. If these be compared with       Mr. Wallace’s book on Russia, it will be seen that social life in that       empire still preserves many of the characteristics which distinguished it       half a century ago—the period of the first publication of the latter       cantos of this poem.            Many references will be found in it to our own country and its literature.       Russian poets have carefully plagiarized the English— notably       Joukóvski. Pushkin, however, was no plagiarist, though undoubtedly his       mind was greatly influenced by the genius of Byron— more especially       in the earliest part of his career. Indeed, as will be remarked in the       following pages, he scarcely makes an effort to disguise this fact.            The biographical sketch is of course a mere outline. I did not think a       longer one advisable, as memoirs do not usually excite much interest till       the subjects of them are pretty well known. In the “notes” I have       endeavored to elucidate a somewhat obscure subject. Some of the poet’s       allusions remain enigmatical to the present day. The point of each sarcasm       naturally passed out of mind together with the society against which it       was levelled. If some of the versification is rough and wanting in “go,” I       must plead in excuse the difficult form of the stanza, and in many       instances the inelastic nature of the subject matter to be versified.       Stanza XXXV Canto II forms a good example of the latter difficulty, and is       omitted in the German and French versions to which I have had access. The       translation of foreign verse is comparatively easy so long as it is       confined to conventional poetic subjects, but when it embraces abrupt       scraps of conversation and the description of local customs it becomes a       much more arduous affair. I think I may say that I have adhered closely to       the text of the original.            The following foreign translations of this poem have appeared:            1. French prose.

Alexander Sergévitch Pushkin was born in 1799 at Pskoff, and was a scion       of an ancient Russian family. In one of his letters it is recorded that no       less than six Pushkins signed the Charta declaratory of the election of       the Románoff family to the throne of Russia, and that two more affixed       their marks from inability to write.            In 1811 he entered the Lyceum, an aristocratic educational establishment       at Tsarskoe Selo, near St. Petersburg, where he was the friend and       schoolmate of Prince Gortchakoff the Russian Chancellor. As a scholar he       displayed no remarkable amount of capacity, but was fond of general       reading and much given to versification. Whilst yet a schoolboy he wrote       many lyrical compositions and commenced _Ruslan and Liudmila_, his       first poem of any magnitude, and, it is asserted, the first readable one       ever produced in the Russian language. During his boyhood he came much       into contact with the poets Dmitrieff and Joukóvski, who were intimate       with his father, and his uncle, Vassili Pushkin, himself an author of no       mean repute. The friendship of the historian Karamzine must have exercised       a still more beneficial influence upon him.            In 1817 he quitted the Lyceum and obtained an appointment in the Foreign       Office at St. Petersburg. Three years of reckless dissipation in the       capital, where his lyrical talent made him universally popular, resulted       in 1818 in a putrid fever which was near carrying him off. At this period       of his life he scarcely slept at all; worked all day and dissipated at       night. Society was open to him from the palace of the prince to the       officers’ quarters of the Imperial Guard. The reflection of this mode of       life may be noted in the first canto of _Eugene Onéguine_ and the       early dissipations of the “Philosopher just turned eighteen,”— the       exact age of Pushkin when he commenced his career in the Russian capital.            In 1820 he was transferred to the bureau of Lieutenant-General Inzoff, at       Kishineff in Bessarabia. This event was probably due to his composing and       privately circulating an “Ode to Liberty,” though the attendant       circumstances have never yet been thoroughly brought to light. An       indiscreet admiration for Byron most likely involved the young poet in       this scrape. The tenor of this production, especially its audacious       allusion to the murder of the emperor Paul, father of the then reigning       Tsar, assuredly deserved, according to aristocratic ideas, the deportation       to Siberia which was said to have been prepared for the author. The       intercession of Karamzine and Joukóvski procured a commutation of his       sentence. Strangely enough, Pushkin appeared anxious to deceive the public       as to the real cause of his sudden disappearance from the capital; for in       an Ode to Ovid composed about this time he styles himself a “voluntary       exile.” (See Note 4 to this volume.)            During the four succeeding years he made numerous excursions amid the       beautiful countries which from the basin of the Euxine—and amongst       these the Crimea and the Caucasus. A nomad life passed amid the beauties       of nature acted powerfully in developing his poetical genius. To this       period he refers in the final canto of _Eugene Onéguine_ (st. v.),       when enumerating the various influences which had contributed to the       formation of his Muse:            “Then, the far capital forgot,      Its splendour and its blandishments,      In poor Moldavia cast her lot,      She visited the humble tents      Of migratory gipsy hordes,” etc. etc.        During these pleasant years of youth he penned some of his most delightful       poetical works: amongst these, _The Prisoner of the Caucasus, The       Fountain of Baktchiserai_, and the _Gipsies_. Of the two former it       may be said that they are in the true style of the _Giaour_ and the       _Corsair_. In fact, just at that point of time Byron’s fame—like       the setting sun—shone out with dazzling lustre and irresistibly       charmed the mind of Pushkin amongst many others. The _Gipsies_ is       more original; indeed the poet himself has been identified with Aleko, the       hero of the tale, which may well be founded on his own personal adventures       without involving the guilt of a double murder. His undisguised admiration       for Byron doubtless exposed him to imputations similar to those commonly       levelled against that poet. But Pushkin’s talent was too genuine for him       to remain long subservient to that of another, and in a later period of       his career he broke loose from all trammels and selected a line peculiarly       his own. Before leaving this stage in our narrative we may point out the       fact that during the"]]]
