There are two characters still undescribed.  Characters of no mean importance were they--the \"guides.\"  They were called respectively, Isaac Bradley and Mark Redwood.  A brace of trappers they were, but as different from each other in personal appearance as two men could well be.  Redwood was a man of large dimensions, and apparently as strong as a buffalo, while his _confrere_ was a thin, wiry, sinewy mortal, with a tough, weasel-like look and gait.  The expression of Redwood's countenance was open and manly, his eyes were grey, his hair light-coloured, and huge brown whiskers covered his cheeks.  Bradley, on the other hand, was dark--his eyes small, black, and piercing--his face as hairless as an Indian's, and bronzed almost to the Indian hue, with the black hair of his head closely cropped around it.  Both these men were dressed in leather from head to foot, yet they were very differently dressed.  Redwood wore the usual buckskin hunting-shirt, leggings, and moccasins, but all of full proportions and well cut, while his large 'coon-skin cap, with the plume-like tail, had an imposing appearance.  Bradley's garments, on the contrary, were tight-fitting and \"skimped.\"  His hunting-shirt was without cape, and adhered so closely to his body that it appeared only an outer skin of the man himself.  His leggings were pinched and tight.  Shirt, leggings, and moccasins were evidently of the oldest kind, and as dirty as a cobbler's apron.  A close-fitting otter cap, with a Mackinaw blanket, completed the wardrobe of Isaac Bradley.  He was equipped with a pouch of greasy leather hanging by an old black strap, a small buffalo-horn suspended by a thong, and a belt of buffalo-leather, in which was stuck a strong blade, with its handle of buckhorn.  His rifle was of the \"tallest\" kind--being full six feet in height--in fact, taller than he was, and at least four fifths of the weapon consisted of barrel.  The straight narrow stock was a piece of manufacture that had proceeded from the hands of the trapper himself.  Redwood's rifle was also a long one, but of more modern build and fashion, and his equipments--pouch, powder-horn and belt--were of a more tasty design and finish.  Such were our guides, Redwood and Bradley.  They were no imaginary characters these.  Mark Redwood was a celebrated \"mountain-man\" at that time, and Isaac Bradley will be recognised by many when I give him the name and title by which he was then known,--viz. \"Old Ike, the wolf-killer.\"  Redwood rode a strong horse of the half-hunter breed, while the \"wolf-killer\" was mounted upon one of the scraggiest looking quadrupeds it would be possible to imagine--an old mare \"mustang.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  THE CAMP AND CAMP-FIRE.  Our route was west by south.  The nearest point with which we expected to fall in with the buffalo was two hundred miles distant.  We might travel three hundred without seeing one, and even much farther at the present day; but a report had reached Saint Louis that the buffalo had been seen that year upon the Osage River, west of the Ozark Hills, and towards that point we steered our course.  We expected in about twenty days to fall in with the game.  Fancy a cavalcade of hunters making a journey of twenty days to get upon the field!  The reader will, no doubt, say we were in earnest.  At the time of which I am writing, a single day's journey from Saint Louis carried the traveller clear of civilised life.  There were settlements beyond; but these were sparse and isolated--a few small towns or plantations upon the main watercourses--and the whole country between them was an uninhabited wilderness.  We had no hope of being sheltered by a roof until our return to the mound city itself, but we had provided ourselves with a couple of tents, part of the freight of our waggon.  There are but few parts of the American wilderness where the traveller can depend upon wild game for a subsistence.  Even the skilled hunter when stationary is sometimes put to his wits' end for \"daily bread.\" Upon the \"route\" no great opportunity is found of killing game, which always requires time to approach it with caution.  Although we passed through what appeared to be excellent cover for various species of wild animals, we reached our first camp without having ruffled either hair or feathers.  In fact, neither bird nor quadruped had been seen, although almost every one of the party had been on the look out for game during most of the journey.  This was rather discouraging, and we reasoned that if such was to be our luck until we got into the buffalo-range we should have a very dull time of it.  We were well provisioned, however, and we regretted the absence of game only on account of the sport.  A large bag of biscuit, and one of flour, several pieces of \"hung bacon,\" some dry ox-tongues, a stock of green coffee, sugar, and salt, were the principal and necessary stores.  There were \"luxuries,\" too, which each had provided according to his fancy, though not much of these, as every one of the party had had some time or other in his life a little experience in the way of \"roughing it.\"  Most of the loading of the waggon consisted of provender for our horses and mules.  We made full thirty miles on the first day.  Our road was a good one. We passed over easy undulations, most of them covered with \"black-jack.\" This is a species of dwarf oak, so called from the very dark colour of its wrinkled bark.  It is almost worthless as a timber, being too small for most purposes.  It is ornamental, however, forming copse-like groves upon the swells of the prairie, while its dark green foliage contrasts pleasantly with the lighter green of the grasses beneath its shade.  The young botanist, Besancon, had least cause to complain.  His time had been sufficiently pleasant during the day.  New foliage fell under his observation--new flowers opened their corollas to his delighted gaze. He was aided in making his collections by the hunter-naturalist, who of course was tolerably well versed in this kindred science.  We encamped by the edge of a small creek of clear water.  Our camp was laid out in due form, and everything arranged in the order we designed habitually to follow.  Every man unsaddled his own horse.  There are no servants in prairie-land.  Even Lanty's services extended not beyond the _cuisine_, and for this department he had had his training as the cook of a New Orleans trading ship.  Jake had enough to do with his mules; and to have asked one of our hunter-guides to perform the task of unsaddling your horse, would have been a hazardous experiment.  Menial service to a free trapper!  There are no servants in prairie-land.  Our horses and mules were picketed on a piece of open ground, each having his \"trail-rope,\" which allowed a circuit of several yards.  The two tents were pitched side by side, facing the stream, and the waggon drawn up some twenty feet in the rear.  In the triangle between the waggon and the tents was kindled a large fire, upon each side of which two stakes, forked at the top, were driven into the ground.  A long sapling resting in the forks traversed the blaze from side to side. This was Lanty's \"crane,\"--the fire was his kitchen.  Let me sketch the camp more minutely, for our first camp was a type of all the others in its general features.  Sometimes indeed the tents did not front the same way, when these openings were set to \"oblige the wind,\" but they were always placed side by side in front of the waggon. They were small tents of the old-fashioned conical kind, requiring only one pole each.  They were of sufficient size for our purpose, as there were only three of us to each--the guides, with Jake and Lanty, finding their lodgment under the tilt of the waggon.  With their graceful shape, and snowy-white colour against the dark green foliage of the trees, they formed an agreeable contrast; and a _coup d'oeil_ of the camp would have been no mean picture to the eye of an artist.  The human figures may be arranged in the following manner.  Supper is getting ready, and Lanty is decidedly at this time the most important personage on the ground.  He is stooping over the fire, with a small but long-handled frying-pan, in which he is parching the coffee. It is already browned, and Lanty stirs it about with an iron spoon.  The crane carries the large coffee-kettle of sheet iron, full of water upon the boil; and a second frying-pan, larger than the first, is filled with sliced ham, ready to be placed upon the hot cinders.  Our English friend Thompson is seated upon a log, with the hat-box before him.  It is open, and he has drawn out from it his stock of combs and brushes.  He has already made his ablutions, and is now giving the finish to his toilet, by putting his hair, whiskers, moustache, teeth, and even his nails, in order.  Your Englishman is the most comfortable traveller in the world.  The Kentuckian is differently engaged.  He is upon his feet; in one hand gleams a knife with ivory handle and long shining blade.  It is a \"bowie,\" of that kind known as an \"Arkansas toothpick.\"  In the other hand you see an object about eight inches in length, of the form of a parallelogram, and of a dark brown colour.  It is a \"plug\" of real \"James's River tobacco.\"  With his knife the Kentuckian cuts off a piece--a \"chunk,\" as he terms it--which is immediately transferred to his mouth, and chewed to a pulp.  This is his occupation for the moment.  The doctor, what of him?  Doctor Jopper may be seen close to the water's edge.  In his hand is a pewter flask, of the kind known as a \"pocket pistol.\"  That pistol is loaded with brandy, and Dr Jopper is just in the act of drawing part of the charge, which, with a slight admixture of cool creek water, is carried aloft and poured into a very droughty vessel."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23499"],["title","The Hunters' Feast: Conversations Around the Camp Fire (#3)"],["body","effect, however, is instantly apparent in the lively twinkle of the doctor's round and prominent eyes.  Besancon is seated near the tent, and the old naturalist beside him. The former is busy with the new plants he has collected.  A large portfolio-looking book rests upon his knees, and between its leaves he is depositing his stores in a scientific manner.  His companion, who understands the business well, is kindly assisting him.  Their conversation is interesting, but every one else is too busy with his affairs to listen to it just now.  The guides are lounging about the waggon.  Old Ike fixes a new flint in his rifle, and Redwood, of a more mirthful disposition, is occasionally cracking a joke with Mike or the \"darkey.\"  Jake is still busy with his mules, and I with my favourite steed, whose feet I have washed in the stream, and anointed with a little spare grease.  I shall not always have the opportunity of being so kind to him, but he will need it the less, as his hoofs become more hardened by the journey.  Around the camp are strewed our saddles, bridles, blankets, weapons, and utensils.  These will all be collected and stowed under cover before we go to rest.  Such is a picture of our camp before supper.  When that meal is cooked, the scene somewhat changes.  The atmosphere, even at that season, was cool enough, and this, with Mike's announcement that the coffee was ready, brought all the party-- guides as well--around the blazing pile of logs.  Each found his own platter, knife, and cup; and, helping himself from the general stock, set to eating on his own account.  Of course there were no fragments, as a strict regard to economy was one of the laws of our camp.  Notwithstanding the fatigue, always incidental to a first day's march, we enjoyed this _al fresco_ supper exceedingly.  The novelty had much to do with our enjoyment of it, and also the fine appetites which we had acquired since our luncheon at noon halt.  When supper was over, smoking followed, for there was not one of the party who was not an inveterate burner of the \"noxious weed.\"  Some chose cigars, of which we had brought a good stock, but several were pipe-smokers.  The zoologist carried a meerschaum; the guides smoked out of Indian calumets of the celebrated steatite, or red claystone.  Mike had his dark-looking \"dudeen,\" and Jake his pipe of corn \"cob\" and cane-joint shank.  Our English friend Thompson had a store of the finest Havannahs, which he smoked with the grace peculiar to the English cigar smoker; holding his cigar impaled upon the point of his knife-blade.  Kentucky also smoked cigars, but his was half buried within his mouth, slanted obliquely towards the right cheek.  Besancon preferred the paper cigarette, which he made extempore, as he required them, out of a stock of loose tobacco.  This is Creole fashion--now also the _mode de Paris_.  A song from the doctor enlivened the conversation, and certainly so melodious a human voice had never echoed near the spot.  One and all agreed that the grand opera had missed a capital \"first tenor\" in not securing the services of our companion.  The fatigue of our long ride caused us to creep into our tents at an early hour, and rolling ourselves in our blankets we went to sleep.  Of course everything had been carefully gathered in lest rain might fall in the night.  The trail-ropes of our animals were looked to: we did not fear their being stolen, but horses on their first few days' journey are easily \"stampeded,\" and will sometimes stray home again.  This would have been a great misfortune, but most of us were old travellers, and every caution was observed in securing against such a result.  There was no guard kept, though we knew the time would come when that would be a necessary duty.    CHAPTER THREE.  BESANCON'S ADVENTURE IN THE SWAMPS.  The prairie traveller never sleeps after daybreak.  He is usually astir before that time.  He has many \"_chores_\" to perform, unknown to the ordinary traveller who rests in the roadside inn.  He has to pack up his tent and bed, cook his own breakfast, and saddle his horse.  All this requires time, therefore an early start is necessary.  We were on our feet before the sun had shown his disc above the black-jacks.  Lanty had the start of us, and had freshened up his fire. Already the coffee-kettle was bubbling audibly, and the great frying-pan perfumed the camp with an incense more agreeable than the odours of Araby.  The raw air of the morning had brought everybody around the fire. Thompson was pruning and cleansing his nails; the Kentuckian was cutting a fresh \"chunk\" from his plug of \"James's River;\" the doctor had just returned from the stream, where he had refreshed himself by a \"nip\" from his pewter flask; Besancon was packing up his portfolios; the zoologist was lighting his long pipe, and the \"Captain\" was looking to his favourite horse, while inhaling the fragrance of an \"Havannah.\"  The guides stood with their blankets hanging from their shoulders silent and thoughtful.  In half an hour breakfast was over, the tents and utensils were restored to the waggon, the horses were brought in and saddled, the mules \"hitched up,\" and the expedition once more on its way.  This day we made not quite so good a journey.  The roads were heavier, the country more thickly timbered, and the ground more hilly.  We had several small streams to ford, and this retarded our progress.  Twenty miles was the extent of our journey.  We encamped again without any of us having killed or seen game. Although we had beaten the bushes on both sides of our course, nothing bigger than the red-bird (scarlet tanager, _Pyranga rubra_), a screaming jay, or an occasional flight of finches, gratified our sight.  We reached our camp somewhat disappointed.  Even old Ike and Redwood came into camp without game, alleging also that they had not met with the sign of a living quadruped.  Our second camp was also on the bank of a small stream.  Shortly after our arrival on the ground, Thompson started out afoot, taking with him his gun.  He had noticed a tract of marsh at no great distance off.  He thought it promised well for snipe.  He had not been long gone, when two reports echoed back, and then shortly after another and another.  He had found something to empty his gun at.  Presently we saw him returning with a brace and a half of birds that looked very much like large snipe.  So he thought them, but that question was set at rest by the zoologist, who pronounced them at once to be the American \"Curlew\" of Wilson (_Numenius longirostris_).  Curlew or snipe, they were soon divested of the feathery coat, and placed in Lanty's frying-pan.  Excellent eating they proved, having only the fault that there was not enough of them.  These birds formed the topic of our after-supper conversation, and then it generalised to the different species of wading birds of America, and at length that singular creature, the \"ibis,\" became the theme.  This came round by Besancon remarking that a species of ibis was brought by the Indians to the markets of New Orleans, and sold there under the name of \"Spanish Curlew.\"  This was the white ibis (_Tantalus albas_), which the zoologist stated was found in plenty along the whole southern coast of the United States.  There were two other species, he said, natives of the warm parts of North America, the \"wood-ibis\" (_Tantalus loculator_), which more nearly resembles the sacred ibis of Egypt, and the beautiful \"sacred ibis\" (_Tantalus ruber_), which last is rarer than the others.  Our venerable companion, who had the ornithology of America, if I may use the expression, at his fingers' ends, imparted many curious details of the habits of these rare birds.  All listened with interest to his statements--even the hunter-guides, for with all their apparent rudeness of demeanour, there was a dash of the naturalist in these fellows.  When the zoologist became silent, the young Creole took up the conversation.  Talking of the ibis, he said, reminded him of an adventure he had met with while in pursuit of these birds among the swamps of his native state.  He would relate it to us.  Of course we were rejoiced at the proposal.  We were just the audience for an \"adventure,\" and after rolling a fresh cigarette, the botanist began his narration.  \"During one of my college vacations I made a botanical excursion to the south-western part of Louisiana.  Before leaving home I had promised a dear friend to bring him the skins of such rare birds as were known to frequent the swampy region I was about to traverse, but he was especially desirous I should obtain for him some specimens of the red ibis, which he intended to have `mounted.'  I gave my word that no opportunity should be lost of obtaining these birds, and I was very anxious to make good my promise.  \"The southern part of the State of Louisiana is one vast labyrinth of swamps, bayous, and lagoons.  The bayous are sluggish streams that glide sleepily along, sometimes running one way, and sometimes the very opposite, according to the season of the year.  Many of them are outlets of the Mississippi, which begins to shed off its waters more than 300 miles from its mouth.  These bayous are deep, sometimes narrow, sometimes wide, with islets in their midst.  They and their contiguous swamps are the great habitat of the alligator and the fresh-water shark--the gar.  Numerous species of water and wading fowl fly over them, and plunge through their dark tide.  Here you may see the red flamingo, the egret, the trumpeter-swan, the blue heron, the wild goose, the crane, the snake-bird, the pelican, and the ibis; you may likewise see the osprey, and the white-headed eagle robbing him of his prey. Both swamps and bayous produce abundantly fish, reptile, and insect, and are, consequently, the favourite resort of hundreds of birds which prey upon these creatures.  In some places, their waters form a complete net-work over the country,"]]]
