It was filled with fruit-trees, the finest peaches in the world, and the finest apples--the Newton pippins.  Besides, there were luscious pears and plums, and upon the espaliers, vines bearing bushels of sweet grapes.  If Colonel P-- lived in the woods, it cannot be said that he was surrounded by a desert.  \"There were several substantial log-houses near the main building or mansion.  They were the stable--and good horses there were in that stable; the cow-house, for milk cattle; the barn, to hold the wheat and maize-corn; the smoke-house, for curing bacon; a large building for the dry tobacco; a cotton-gin, with its shed of clap-boards; bins for the husk fodder, and several smaller structures.  In one corner you saw a low-walled erection that reminded you of a kennel, and the rich music that from time to time issued from its apertures would convince you that it _was_ a kennel.  If you had peeped into it, you would have seen a dozen of as fine stag-hounds as ever lifted a trail.  The colonel was somewhat partial to these pets, for he was a `mighty hunter.'  You might see a number of young colts in an adjoining lot; a pet deer, a buffalo-calf, that had been brought from the far prairies, pea-fowl, guinea-hens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and the usual proportion of common fowls.  Rail-fences zigzagged off in all directions towards the edge of the woods.  Huge trees, dead and divested of their leaves, stood up in the cleared fields.  Turkey buzzards and carrion, crows might be seen perched upon their grey naked limbs; upon their summit you might observe the great rough-legged falcon; and above all, cutting sharply against the blue sky, the fork-tailed kite sailing gently about.\"  Here the doctor's auditory interrupted him with a murmur of applause. The doctor was in fine spirits, and in a poetical mood.  He continued.  \"Such, gentlemen, was the sort of place I had come to visit; and I saw at a glance that I could spend a few days there pleasantly enough--even without the additional attractions of a pigeon-hunt.  \"On my arrival I found the party assembled.  It consisted of a score and a half of ladies and gentlemen, nearly all young people.  The pigeons had not yet made their appearance, but were looked for every hour.  The woods had assumed the gorgeous tints of autumn, that loveliest of seasons in the `far west.'  Already the ripe nuts and berries were scattered profusely over the earth offering their annual banquet to God's wild creatures.  The `mast' of the beech-tree, of which the wild pigeon is so fond, was showering down among the dead leaves.  It was the very season at which the birds were accustomed to visit the beechen woods that girdled the colonel's plantation.  They would no doubt soon appear.  With this expectation everything was made ready; each of the gentlemen was provided with a fowling-piece, or rifle if he preferred it; and even some of the ladies insisted upon being armed.  \"To render the sport more exciting, our host had established certain regulations.  They were as follows:--The gentlemen were divided into two parties, of equal numbers.  These were to go in opposite directions, the ladies upon the first day of the hunt accompanying whichever they chose. Upon all succeeding days, however, the case would be different.  The ladies were to accompany that party which upon the day previous had bagged the greatest number of birds.  The victorious gentlemen, moreover, were endowed with other privileges, which lasted throughout the evening; such as the choice of partners for the dinner-table and the dance.  \"I need not tell you, gentlemen, that in these conditions existed powerful motives for exertion.  The colonel's guests were the _elite_ of western society.  Most of the gentlemen were young men or bachelors; and among the ladies there were _belles_; three or four of them rich and beautiful.  On my arrival I could perceive signs of incipient flirtations.  Attachments had already arisen; and by many it would have been esteemed anything but pleasant to be separated in the manner prescribed.  A strong _esprit du corps_ was thus established; and, by the time the pigeons arrived, both parties had determined to do their utmost.  In fact, I have never known so strong a feeling of rivalry to exist between two parties of amateur sportsmen.  \"The pigeons at length arrived.  It was a bright sunny morning, and yet the atmosphere was darkened, as the vast flock, a mile in breadth by several in length, passed across the canopy.  The sound of their wings resembled a strong wind whistling among tree-tops, or through the rigging of a ship.  We saw that they hovered over the woods, and settled among the tall beeches.  \"The beginning of the hunt was announced, and we set forth, each party taking the direction allotted to it.  With each went a number of ladies, and even some of these were armed with light fowling-pieces, determined that the party of their choice should be the victorious one.  After a short ride, we found ourselves fairly `in the woods,' and in the presence of the birds, and then the cracking commenced.  \"In our party we had eight guns, exclusive of the small fowling-pieces (two of those), with which a brace of our heroines were armed, and which, truth compels me to confess, were less dangerous to the pigeons than to ourselves.  Some of our guns were double-barrelled shot-guns, others were rifles.  You will wonder at rifles being used in such a sport, and yet it is a fact that the gentlemen who carried rifles managed to do more execution than those who were armed with the other species.  This arose from the circumstance that they were contented to aim at single birds, and, being good shots, they were almost sure to bring these down.  The woods were filled with straggling pigeons.  Odd birds were always within rifle range; and thus, instead of wasting their time in endeavouring to approach the great flocks, our riflemen did nothing but load and fire.  In this way they soon counted their game by dozens.  \"Early in the evening, the pigeons, having filled their crops with the mast, disappeared.  They flew off to some distant `roost.'  This of course concluded our sport for the day.  We got together and counted our numbers.  We had 640 birds.  We returned home full of hope; we felt certain that we had won for that day.  Our antagonists had arrived before us.  They showed us 736 dead pigeons.  We were beaten.  \"I really cannot explain the chagrin which this defeat occasioned to most of our party.  They felt humiliated in the eyes of the ladies, whose company they were to lose on the morrow.  To some there was extreme bitterness in the idea; for, as I have already stated, attachments had sprung up, and jealous thoughts were naturally their concomitants.  It was quite tantalising, as we parted next morning, to see the galaxy of lovely women ride off with our antagonists, while we sought the woods in the opposite direction, dispirited and in silence.  \"We went, however, determined to do our best, and win the ladies for the morrow.  A council was held, and each imparted his advice and encouragement; and then we all set to work with shot-gun and rifle.  \"On this day an incident occurred that aided our `count' materially.  As you know, gentlemen, the wild pigeons, while feeding, sometimes cover the ground so thickly that they crowd upon each other.  They all advance in the same direction, those behind continually rising up and fluttering to the front, so that the surface presents a series of undulations like sea-waves.  Frequently the birds alight upon each other's backs, for want of room upon the ground, and a confused mass of winged creatures is seen rolling through the woods.  At such times, if the sportsman can only `head' the flock, he is sure of a good shot.  Almost every pellet tells, and dozens may be brought down at a single discharge.  \"In my progress through the woods, I had got separated from my companions, when I observed an immense flock approaching me after the manner described.  I saw from their plumage that they were young birds, and therefore not likely to be easily alarmed.  I drew my horse (I was mounted) behind a tree, and awaited their approach.  This I did more from curiosity than any other motive, as, unfortunately I carried a rifle, and could only have killed one or two at the best.  The crowd came `swirling' forward, and when they were within some ten or fifteen paces distant, I fired into their midst.  To my surprise, the flock did not take flight, but continued to advance as before, until they were almost among the horse's feet.  I could stand it no longer.  I drove the spurs deeply, and galloped into their midst, striking right and left as they fluttered up round me.  Of course they were soon off; but of those that had been trodden upon by my horse, and others I had knocked down, I counted no less than twenty-seven!  Proud of my exploit, I gathered the birds into my bag, and rode in search of my companions.  \"Our party on this day numbered over 800 head killed; but, to our surprise and chagrin, our antagonists had beaten us by more than a hundred!  \"The gentlemen of `ours' were wretched.  The belles were monopolised by our antagonists; we were scouted, and debarred every privilege.  \"It was not to be endured; something must be done.  What was to be done? counselled we.  If fair means will not answer, we must try the opposite. It was evident that our antagonists were better shots than we.  \"The colonel, too, was one of them, and he was sure to kill every time he pulled trigger.  The odds were against us; some plan must be devised; some _ruse_ must be adopted, and the idea of one had been passing through my mind during the whole of that day.  It was this:--I had noticed, what has been just remarked, that, although the pigeons will not allow the sportsman to come within range of a fowling-piece, yet at a distance of little over a hundred yards they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2350"],["title","His Last Bow: An Epilogue of Sherlock Holmes (#0)"],["body","His Last Bow  by Arthur Conan Doyle     Preface   The friends of Mr. Sherlock Holmes will be glad to learn that he is still alive and well, though somewhat crippled by occasional attacks of rheumatism. He has, for many years, lived in a small farm upon the Downs five miles from Eastbourne, where his time is divided between philosophy and agriculture. During this period of rest he has refused the most princely offers to take up various cases, having determined that his retirement was a permanent one. The approach of the German war caused him, however, to lay his remarkable combination of intellectual and practical activity at the disposal of the Government, with historical results which are recounted in _His Last Bow_. Several previous experiences which have lain long in my portfolio have been added to _His Last Bow_ so as to complete the volume.  John H.

The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles  I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day towards the end of March in the year 1892. Holmes had received a telegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply. He made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his pipe, and casting an occasional glance at the message. Suddenly he turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes.  “I suppose, Watson, we must look upon you as a man of letters,” said he. “How do you define the word ‘grotesque’?”  “Strange—remarkable,” I suggested.  He shook his head at my definition.  “There is surely something more than that,” said he; “some underlying suggestion of the tragic and the terrible. If you cast your mind back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a long-suffering public, you will recognise how often the grotesque has deepened into the criminal. Think of that little affair of the red-headed men. That was grotesque enough in the outset, and yet it ended in a desperate attempt at robbery. Or, again, there was that most grotesque affair of the five orange pips, which led straight to a murderous conspiracy. The word puts me on the alert.”  “Have you it there?” I asked.  He read the telegram aloud.  “Have just had most incredible and grotesque experience. May I consult you?  “Scott Eccles, “Post Office, Charing Cross.”   “Man or woman?” I asked.  “Oh, man, of course. No woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram. She would have come.”  “Will you see him?”  “My dear Watson, you know how bored I have been since we locked up Colonel Carruthers. My mind is like a racing engine, tearing itself to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it was built. Life is commonplace, the papers are sterile; audacity and romance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world. Can you ask me, then, whether I am ready to look into any new problem, however trivial it may prove? But here, unless I am mistaken, is our client.”  A measured step was heard upon the stairs, and a moment later a stout, tall, grey-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was ushered into the room. His life history was written in his heavy features and pompous manner. From his spats to his gold-rimmed spectacles he was a Conservative, a churchman, a good citizen, orthodox and conventional to the last degree. But some amazing experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in his bristling hair, his flushed, angry cheeks, and his flurried, excited manner. He plunged instantly into his business.  “I have had a most singular and unpleasant experience, Mr. Holmes,” said he. “Never in my life have I been placed in such a situation. It is most improper—most outrageous. I must insist upon some explanation.” He swelled and puffed in his anger.  “Pray sit down, Mr. Scott Eccles,” said Holmes in a soothing voice. “May I ask, in the first place, why you came to me at all?”  “Well, sir, it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the police, and yet, when you have heard the facts, you must admit that I could not leave it where it was. Private detectives are a class with whom I have absolutely no sympathy, but none the less, having heard your name—”  “Quite so. But, in the second place, why did you not come at once?”  Holmes glanced at his watch.  “It is a quarter-past two,” he said. “Your telegram was dispatched about one. But no one can glance at your toilet and attire without seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking.”  Our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven chin.  “You are right, Mr. Holmes. I never gave a thought to my toilet. I was only too glad to get out of such a house. But I have been running round making inquiries before I came to you. I went to the house agents, you know, and they said that Mr. Garcia’s rent was paid up all right and that everything was in order at Wisteria Lodge.”  “Come, come, sir,” said Holmes, laughing. “You are like my friend, Dr. Watson, who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end foremost. Please arrange your thoughts and let me know, in their due sequence, exactly what those events are which have sent you out unbrushed and unkempt, with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry, in search of advice and assistance.”  Our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional appearance.  “I’m sure it must look very bad, Mr. Holmes, and I am not aware that in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before. But I will tell you the whole queer business, and when I have done so you will admit, I am sure, that there has been enough to excuse me.”  But his narrative was nipped in the bud. There was a bustle outside, and Mrs. Hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and official-looking individuals, one of whom was well known to us as Inspector Gregson of Scotland Yard, an energetic, gallant, and, within his limitations, a capable officer. He shook hands with Holmes and introduced his comrade as Inspector Baynes, of the Surrey Constabulary.  “We are hunting together, Mr. Holmes, and our trail lay in this direction.” He turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor. “Are you Mr. John Scott Eccles, of Popham House, Lee?”  “I am.”  “We have been following you about all the morning.”  “You traced him through the telegram, no doubt,” said Holmes.  “Exactly, Mr. Holmes. We picked up the scent at Charing Cross Post-Office and came on here.”  “But why do you follow me? What do you want?”  “We wish a statement, Mr. Scott Eccles, as to the events which led up to the death last night of Mr. Aloysius Garcia, of Wisteria Lodge, near Esher.”  Our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour struck from his astonished face.  “Dead? Did you say he was dead?”  “Yes, sir, he is dead.”  “But how? An accident?”  “Murder, if ever there was one upon earth.”  “Good God! This is awful! You don’t mean—you don’t mean that I am suspected?”  “A letter of yours was found in the dead man’s pocket, and we know by it that you had planned to pass last night at his house.”  “So I did.”  “Oh, you did, did you?”  Out came the official notebook.  “Wait a bit, Gregson,” said Sherlock Holmes. “All you desire is a plain statement, is it not?”  “And it is my duty to warn Mr. Scott Eccles that it may be used against him.”  “Mr. Eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room. I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, I suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience, and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted.”  Our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to his face. With a dubious glance at the inspector’s notebook, he plunged at once into his extraordinary statement.  “I am a bachelor,” said he, “and being of a sociable turn I cultivate a large number of friends. Among these are the family of a retired brewer called Melville, living at Abermarle Mansion, Kensington. It was at his table that I met some weeks ago a young fellow named Garcia. He was, I understood, of Spanish descent and connected in some way with the embassy. He spoke perfect English, was pleasing in his manners, and as good-looking a man as ever I saw in my life.  “In some way we struck up quite a friendship, this young fellow and I. He seemed to take a fancy to me from the first, and within two days of our meeting he came to see me at Lee. One thing led to another, and it ended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at his house, Wisteria Lodge, between Esher and Oxshott. Yesterday evening I went to Esher to fulfil this engagement.  “He had described his household to me before I went there. He lived with a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all his needs. This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping for him. Then there was a wonderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had picked up in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner. I remember that he remarked what a queer household it was to find in the heart of Surrey, and that I agreed with him, though it has proved a good deal queerer than I thought.  “I drove to the place—about two miles on the south side of Esher. The house was a fair-sized one, standing back from the road, with a curving drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs. It was an old, tumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair. When the trap pulled up on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and weather-stained door, I had doubts as to my wisdom in "]]]
