However this may have been, it was certain that Squire Moses had several times threatened to take possession of the cottage occupied by Joel's family, for the principal of the mortgage note was now due. He had said this to Joel's widow, causing the poor woman the deepest distress, and rousing in Stumpy the strongest indignation. This was why Stumpy \"took no stock\" in his grandfather.  But while we have been telling all this long story about Leopold's companion, the old boat had reached the vicinity of the wreck. Stumpy had eaten his fill of cold roast beef, biscuit, and apple pie, and was entirely satisfied with himself, and especially with his friend. Leopold threw overboard the ground bait, and soon, with a shout of exultation, he announced the presence of a school of mackerel. The lines were immediately in the water, and the fish bit very sharply. Leopold and Stumpy had nothing to do but pull them in and \"slat\" them off as fast as they could. The boat was filling up very rapidly; but suddenly, the school, as though called in after recess, sank down and disappeared. Not another bite could be obtained, and the old boat was headed for the river. On the way up, Stumpy counted the mackerel.  \"Four hundred and sixty!\" exclaimed he, when the task was finished.  \"That isn't bad,\" added Leopold.  \"I threw out all the small ones--about twenty of them.\"  \"We will keep those to eat.\"  In half an hour more there was a tremendous excitement in and around the fish market, caused by the arrival of the fare of mackerel.     CHAPTER V.  HERR SCHLAGER.   Four hundred and sixty mackerel, besides about twenty \"tinkers,\" was a big fare for that season; but when this fish bite they make a business of it and an expert in the art may catch from forty to sixty in a minute. It was exciting work, and the blood of Leopold and Stumpy had been up to fever heat. But this violent agitation had passed away, though it was succeeded by a sensation hardly less exhilarating. Though the fish were caught and in the boat, the game was not played out--to return to the comparison with the gambler. The excitement still continues and would continue until the fish were sold. The great question now was, What would the mackerel bring in the market? Even a difference of a cent in the price of a single fish made four dollars and sixty cents on the whole fare. Leopold had received a large price the day before, and he could only hope he should do as well on the present occasion. He was almost as deeply moved in regard to the price as he had been in regard to catching the fish.  \"I have made a big day's work for me, Le, whatever price they bring,\" said Stumpy, shortly after he had finished counting the fish. \"If you sell them at five cents apiece, I shall have five dollars and three quarters; and that is more than I can generally earn in a week.\"  \"I won't sell them for five cents apiece, Stumpy,\" replied Leopold, very decidedly.  \"If they won't bring any more than that, what are you going to do about it?\" laughed Stumpy.  \"Mackerel are very scarce this season, and I don't believe they have had any over at Rockland. If the folks in the fish market don't give me ten cents apiece for the lot, I shall sail over there. I am almost sure I can get ten cents for mackerel as handsome as these are. Besides, about all I brought in yesterday were sold before sundown.\"  \"Then I shall be eleven dollars and a half in,\" added Stumpy. \"My mother wants about so much to make out her interest money. If she don't pay it we shall be turned out doors before the sun goes down on the day it is due.\"  \"Do you think so?\" asked Leopold, with a deep expression of sympathy.  \"O, I know it. My grandad is an amiable man. He don't put off till to-morrow what can be done to-day, when anybody owes him any money.\"  \"It seems to me I would rather go to jail than owe him a dollar.\"  \"So would I; and I only wish my mother could pay off the mortgage! Things have gone up in Rockhaven, and the place that cost my father eleven hundred dollars seven years ago, is worth eighteen hundred or two thousand now. My affectionate grandpa knows this just as well as my mother; and if he can get the place for the seven hundred we owe him, he will do it. He says it is too expensive a place for poor folks who haven't got anything.\"  \"But if the place is worth two thousand dollars, your mother will get all over the seven hundred, when it is sold,\" suggested Leopold, who had considerable knowledge of business.  [Illustration: THE BIG CATCH OF MACKEREL. Page 85.]  \"The house and land are worth just what I say; or, at least, they were a year ago, though the war has knocked things higher than a kite just now. Nobody except my loving grandpa has got the ready cash to pay down; and mother thinks the place wouldn't fetch much, if anything, over the mortgage. But in time it will be worth two thousand dollars.\"  The arrival of the old boat at the wharf, and the commencement of the excitement in and around the fish market, terminated the conversation on Stumpy's worldly affairs. As the dingy craft approached the pier, a crowd gathered at the head of the landing-steps, for it had been noised about the town that Leopold had brought in a fare of mackerel the day before; and people were anxious to know whether he had repeated his good luck.  A great many boats had gone out that morning after mackerel, but none of them had yet returned. Foremost in the crowd on the wharf was Bangs, the senior member of the firm that kept the fish market. He was excited and anxious, though he struggled to be calm and indifferent when Leopold fastened the painter of his boat to the steps.  \"What luck to-day, Le?\" shouted Bangs, who could not see the fish, for the careful Leopold had covered them in order to keep them from injury from the sun, and so that the extent of his good fortune might not at once be seen by the idlers on the wharf.  \"Pretty fair,\" replied Leopold, striving to be as calm and indifferent as the dealer in fish on the pier.  \"What have you got?\" inquired Bangs.  \"Mackerel,\" answered Leopold, as he seated himself in the stern-sheets of the boat, with affected carelessness.  \"Tinkers?\"  \"No; the same sort that I sold you yesterday.\"  \"What do you ask for them?\" inquired Bangs, looking up at the sky as though nothing on the earth below concerned him.  \"Ten cents,\" replied Leopold, looking up at the sky in turn, as though nothing sublunary concerned him, either.  \"All right,\" said the dealer, shaking his head, with a kind of smile, which seemed to indicate that he thought the young fisherman was beside himself to ask such a price, after apparently glutting the market the day before. \"That will do for once, Le; but they won't bring ten cents at retail, after all I sold yesterday. I should have to salt them down.\"  \"Very well,\" added Leopold; \"that's my price; and I don't know of any law that compels you to give it, if you don't want to, Mr. Bangs.\"  The dealer began to edge his way through the crowd towards the fish market, and the idlers hastened to the conclusion that there would be no trade.  \"What do you ask apiece for two or three of them?\" asked some one on the wharf.  \"Twenty cents,\" answered Leopold. \"But I don't care to sell them at retail.\"  \"I will take three, if you will let me have them,\" added the inquirer.  This conversation startled the head of the fish firm, and he returned once more to the cap-sill of the wharf. He saw that if the young man attempted to sell out his fare at retail, the business of the market would be ruined for that day.  \"I will give you eight cents apiece for all you have,\" said Bangs.  \"You can't buy them at that price. If you don't want them at ten cents apiece, I shall take them over to Rockland,\" replied Leopold, who did not wish to offend the members of the fish firm, for they had often bought out his fare, and he wished to keep on the right side of them for operations in the future.  Mr. Bangs considered, parleyed, and then offered nine cents; but finally, when Leopold was found to be inflexible, he yielded the point, and agreed to pay the ten cents. The mackerel were unloaded and conveyed to the market, when the sale of them at retail commenced immediately. The fish were so large and handsome that twenty cents did not appear to be a very extravagant price for them, considering the scarcity of the article in the market. In the settlement, Leopold received forty-six dollars; Stumpy's share, according to a standing agreement, was one quarter of the proceeds of the sale; and the eleven dollars and a half which he put into his wallet was quite as satisfactory to him as the thirty-four dollars and a half was to Leopold. Both of them felt that they had been favored by fortune to an extraordinary degree, and they were very happy. The old boat was sailed back to her usual moorings. The tinkers were equally divided between the young fishermen, and they went home.  By eleven o'clock Stumpy had poured into the lap of his astonished mother the proceeds of his morning's work, and Leopold had informed his father of the second big haul he had made that season. As before, Mr. Bennington--but with some additional cautions--told his son to keep the money he had made.  \"The sick man is in a peck of trouble this morning,\" added the landlord of the Cliff House, when the exciting business of the occasion had been disposed of.  \"What's the matter of him?\" asked Leopold.  \"He has lost his book, his record, or whatever it is,\" added Mr. Bennington. \"He has sent for everybody belonging in the house, including many of the boarders. He wants to see you.\"  \"I'm sure I don't know anything about it,\" replied Leopold, who, judging by what the invalid had said about the book, realized that the loss of it must distress him very much.  \"No one seems to know anything about it; and the sick man will have it that some one has stolen"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23783"],["title","Eliza (#0)"],["body","Transcriber's Note: Minor typographical errors have been corrected without note.

Also the two words were not a description, and were so offensive that I did not continue the conversation.  I believe there are but few people who could give you an accurate description of themselves. Often in the train to and from the city, or while walking in the street, I think over myself--what I have been, what I am, what I might be if, financially speaking, it would run to it. I imagine how I should act under different circumstances--on the receipt of a large legacy, or if for some specially clever action I were taken into partnership, or if a mad bull came down the street. I may say that I make a regular study of myself. I have from time to time recorded on paper some of the more important incidents of our married life, affecting Eliza and myself, and I present them to you, gentle reader, in this little volume. I think they show how with a very limited income--and but for occasional assistance from Eliza's mother I do not know how we should have got along--a man may to a great extent preserve respectability, show taste and judgment, and manage his wife and home.  The more I think about myself, the more--I say it in all modesty--the subject seems to grow. I should call myself many-sided, and in many respects unlike ordinary men. Take, for instance, the question of taste. Some people would hardly think it worth while to mention a little thing like taste; but I do. I am not rich, but what I have I like to have ornamental, though not loud. Only the other day the question of glass-cloths for the kitchen turned up, and though those with the red border were threepence a dozen dearer than the plain, I ordered them without hesitation. Eliza changed them next day, contrary to my wishes, and we had a few words about it, but that is not the point. The real point is that if your taste comes out in a matter of glass-cloths for the kitchen, it will also come out in antimacassars for the drawing-room and higher things.  Again, ordinary men--men that might possibly call themselves my equals--are not careful enough about respectability. Everywhere around me I see betting on horse-races, check trousers on Sunday, the wash hung out in the front garden, whiskey and soda, front steps not properly whitened, and the door-handle not up to the mark. I could point to houses where late hours on Sunday are so much the rule that the lady of the house comes down in her dressing-gown to take in the milk--which, I am sure, Eliza would sooner die than do. There are families--in my own neighbourhood, I am sorry to say--where the chimneys are not swept regularly, beer is fetched in broad daylight, and attendance at a place of worship on Sunday is rather the exception than the rule. Then, again, language is an important point; to my mind nothing marks a respectable man more than the use of genteel language. There may have been occasions when excessive provocation has led me to the use of regrettable expressions, but they have been few. As a rule I avoid not only what is profane, but also anything that is slangy. I fail to understand this habit which the present generation has formed of picking up some meaningless phrase and using it in season and out of season. For some weeks I have been greatly annoyed by the way some of the clerks use the phrase \"What, ho, she bumps!\" If you ask them who bumps, or how, or why, they have no answer but fits of silly laughter. Probably, before these words appear in print that phrase will have been forgotten and another equally ridiculous will have taken its place. It is not sensible; what is worse, it is not to my mind respectable. Do not imagine that I object to humour in conversation. That is a very different thing. I have made humourous remarks myself before now, mostly of rather a cynical and sarcastic kind.  I am fond of my home, and any little addition to its furniture or decorations gives me sincere pleasure. Both in the home and in our manner of life there are many improvements which I am prevented by financial considerations from carrying out. If I were a rich man I would have the drawing-room walls a perfect mass of pictures. If I had money I could spend it judiciously and without absurdity. I should have the address stamped in gold on the note-paper, and use boot-trees, and never be without a cake in the house in case a friend dropped in to tea. Nor should I think twice about putting on an extra clean pair of cuffs in the week if wanted. We should keep two servants. I am interested in the drama, if serious, and two or three times every month I should take Eliza to the dress-circle. Our suburb has a train service which is particularly convenient for the theatres. Eliza would wear a dressy blouse,--she shares my objections to anything cut out at the neck,--a mackintosh, and a sailor hat, the two latter to be removed before entering. I should carry her evening shoes in a pretty crewel-worked bag. We have often discussed it. Curiously enough, she already has the bag, though we seldom have an opportunity to use it in this way. Doubtless there are many other innovations which, with appropriate means, I could suggest. But I have said enough to show that they would all be in the direction of refinement and elegance, and the money would not be spent in foolishness or vice.  As Eliza's husband, I should perhaps say a word or two about her. She is a lady of high principles and great activity. Owing to my absence every day in the exercise of my profession, she is called upon to settle many questions,--as, for instance, the other day the question of what contribution, if any, should be given to the local Fire Brigade,--where a word of advice from me would have been useful. If not actually independent, she is certainly not what would be described as a clinging woman. Indeed, she does occasionally take upon herself to enter on a line of action without consulting me, when my advice is perfectly at her disposal, and would perhaps save her from blunders. Last year she filled the coal-cellar (unusually large for the type of house) right up at summer prices. Undoubtedly, she thought that she was practising an economy. But she was dealing with a coal-merchant who does not give credit--a man who requires cash down and sees that he gets it. And--well, I need not go into details here, but it proved to be excessively inconvenient for me. She has lost the silly playfulness which was rather a mark of her character during the period of our engagement, and if this is due to the sobering effects of association with a steady and thoughtful character, I am not displeased. She herself says it's the work, but the women do not always know. Possibly, too, her temper is more easily ruffled now than then when I point out things to her. I should say that she was less ambitious than myself. I do not mention these little matters at all by way of finding fault. On the contrary, I have a very high opinion of Eliza.  [Illustration: \"_Filled the coal-cellar right up at summer prices._\"]  We have no children living.  With these few prefatory words, gentle reader, I fling open the front door--to use a metaphorical expression--and invite you to witness a few scenes of our domestic life that I have from time to time recorded.     THE CARDS   About a year ago Eliza and myself had a little difference of opinion. I mentioned to her that we had no visiting-cards.  \"Of course not,\" she said. \"The idea of such a thing!\" She spoke rather hastily.  \"Why do you say 'of course not'?\" I replied, quietly. \"Visiting-cards are, I believe, in common use among ladies and gentlemen.\"  She said she did not see what that had to do "]]]
