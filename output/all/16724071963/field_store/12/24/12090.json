Now, how will you get back to the boat?\"  \"Pull myself hand over hand along the line.\"  \"Think, Mr. Danley! _Think!_\"  \"Uh. Oh. Well, I wouldn't keep pulling. I'd just give myself a tug and then coast in, taking up the line slowly as I went.\"  \"Excellent! What would happen if you, as you put it, pulled yourself in hand over hand, as if you were climbing a rope on Earth?\"  \"I would accelerate too much,\" Danley said. \"I'd gain too much momentum and probably bash my brains out against the boat. And I'd have no way to stop myself.\"  \"Bully for you, Mr. Danley! Now see if you can put into action that which you have so succinctly put into words. Come back to the boat. Gently the first time. We'll have plenty of practice, so that you can get the feel of the muscle pull that will give you a maximum of velocity with a minimum of impact at this end. Gently, now.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Still later:  \"Judgment, Mr. Danley!\" St. Simon cautioned. \"You have to use judgment! A space boat is not an automobile. There is no friction out here to slow it to a stop. Your accelerator is just exactly that--an accelerator. Taking your foot off it won't slow you down a bit; you've got to use your reverse.\"  Peter Danley was at the controls of the boat. There were tiny beads of perspiration on his forehead. Over a kilometer away was a good-sized hunk of rock; his instructors wouldn't let him get any closer. They wanted to be sure that they could take over before the boat struck the rock, just in case Danley should freeze to the accelerator a little too long.  He wasn't used to this sort of thing. He was used to a taped acceleration-deceleration program which lifted a big ship, aimed it, and went through the trip all automatically. All he had ever had to do was drop it the last few hundred feet to a landing field.  \"Keep your eyes moving,\" St. Simon said. \"Your radar can give you data that you need, just remember that it can't think for you.\"  _Your right foot controls your forward acceleration._  _Your left foot controls your reverse acceleration._  _They can't be pushed down together; when one goes down, the other goes up. Balance one against the other._  _Turning your wheel controls the roll of the boat._  _Pulling your wheel toward you, or pushing it away, controls the pitch._  _Shifting the wheel left, or right, controls the yaw._  The instructions had been pounded into his head until each one seemed to ring like a separate little bell. The problem was coordinating his body to act on those instructions.  One of the radar dials told him how far he was from the rock. Another told him his radial velocity relative to it. A third told him his angular velocity.  \"Come to a dead stop exactly one thousand meters from the surface, Mr. Danley,\" St. Simon ordered.  Danley worked the controls until both his velocity meters read zero, and the distance meter read exactly one kilometer.  \"Very good, Mr. Danley. Now assume that the surface of your rock is at nine hundred ninety-five meters. Bring your boat to a dead stop exactly fifty centimeters from that surface.\"  Danley worked the controls again. He grinned with satisfaction when the distance meter showed nine nine five point five on the nose.  Captain St. Simon sighed deeply. \"Mr. Danley, do you feel a little shaken up? Banged around a little? Do you feel as though you'd just gotten a bone-rattling shock?\"  \"Uh ... no.\"  \"You should. You slammed this boat a good two feet into the surface of that rock before you backed out again.\" His voice changed tone. \"Dammit, Mr. Danley, when I say 'surface at nine nine five', I mean _surface_!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Edway Tarnhorst had been dictating notes for his reports into his recorder, and was rather tired, so when he asked Peter Danley what he had learned, he was rather irritated when the blond man closed his blue eyes and repeated, parrotlike:  \"Due to the lack of a water-oxygen atmosphere, many minerals are found in the asteroids which are unknown on Earth. Among the more important of these are: Oldhamite (CaS); Daubr√©elite (FECr_{2}S_{4}); Schreibersite and Rhabdite (Fe_{3}Ni_{3}P); Lawrencite (FeCl_{2}); and Taenite, an alloy of iron containing--\"  \"That's not precisely the sort of thing I meant,\" Tarnhorst interrupted testily.  Danley smiled. \"I know. I'm sorry. That's my lesson for tomorrow.\"  \"So I gathered. May I sit down?\" There were only two chairs in the room. Danley was occupying one, and a pile of books was occupying the other.  Danley quickly got to his feet and began putting the books on his desk. \"Certainly, Mr. Tarnhorst. Sit down.\"  Tarnhorst lowered himself into the newly emptied chair. \"I apologize for interrupting your studies,\" he said. \"I realize how important they are. But there are a few points I'd like to discuss with you.\"  \"Certainly.\" Danley seated himself and looked at the older man expectantly. \"The nullifiers are on,\" he said.  \"Of course,\" Tarnhorst said absently. Then, changing his manner, he said abruptly: \"Have you found anything yet?\"  Danley shook his head. \"No. It looks to me as though they've done everything possible to make sure that these men get the best equipment and the best training. The training instructors have been through the whole affair themselves--they know the ropes. The equipment, as far as I can tell, is top grade stuff. From what I have seen so far, the Company isn't stinting on the equipment or the training.\"  Tarnhorst nodded. \"After nearly three months of investigation, I have come to the same conclusion myself. The records show that expenditures on equipment has been steadily increasing. The equipment they have now, I understand, is almost failure-proof?\" He looked questioningly at Danley.  Danley nodded. \"Apparently. Certainly no one is killed because of equipment failure. It's the finest stuff I've ever seen.\"  \"And yet,\" Tarnhorst said, \"their books show that they are constantly seeking to improve it.\"  \"I don't suppose there is any chance of juggling the books on you, is there?\"  Tarnhorst smiled a superior smile. \"Hardly. In the first place, I know bookkeeping. In the second, it would be impossible to whip up a complete set of balancing books--covering a period of nearly eighty years--overnight.  \"I agree,\" Danley said. \"I don't think they set up a special training course just for me overnight, either. I've seen classes on Vesta, Juno, and Eros--and they're all the same. There aren't any fancy false fronts to fool us, Mr. Tarnhorst: I've looked very closely.\"  \"Have you talked to the men?\"  \"Yes. They have no complaints.\"  Again Tarnhorst nodded. \"I have found the same thing. They all insist that if a man gets killed in space, it's not the fault of anyone but himself. Or, as it may be, an act of God.\"  \"One of my instructors ran into an act of God some years ago,\" Danley said. \"You've met him. Brand--the one with the scarred face.\" He explained to Tarnhorst what had caused Brand's disfigurement. \"But he survived,\" he finished, \"because he kept his wits about him even after he was hit.\"  \"Commendable; very commendable,\" Tarnhorst said. \"If he'd been an excitable fool, he'd have died.\"  \"True. But what I was trying to point out was that it wasn't equipment failure that caused the accident.\"  \"No. You're quite right.\" Tarnhorst was silent for a moment, then he looked into Danley's eyes. \"Do you think you could take on a job as anchor man now?\"  \"I don't know,\" said Danley evenly. \"But I'm going to find out tomorrow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Peter Danley took his final examination the following day. All by himself, he went through the procedure of positioning his ship, setting up a rocket drill, firing it, and setting in an anchor. It was only a small rock, nine meters through, but the job was almost the same as with the big ones. Not far away, Captain St. Simon watched the Earthman's procedure through a pair of high-powered field glasses. He breathed a deep sigh of relief when the job was done.  \"Jules,\" he said softly, \"I am sure glad that man didn't hurt himself any.\"  \"Yes, _suh_! We'd of sho' been in trouble if he'd of killed hisself!\"  \"We will have to tell Captain Brand that our pupil has done pretty well for such a small amount of schooling.\"  \"I think that would be proper, m'lud.\"  \"And we will also have to tell Captain Brand that this boy wouldn't last a month. He wouldn't come back from his first trip.\"  There was no answer to that.         *       *       *       *       *  Three days later, amid a cloud of generally satisfied feelings, Edway Tarnhorst and Peter Danley took the ship back to Earth.  \"I cannot, of course, give you a copy of my report,\" Tarnhorst had told Georges Alhamid. \"That is for the eyes of the Committee only. However, I may say that I do not find the Belt Companies or the governments of the Belt Cities at fault. Do you want to know my personal opinion?\"  \"I would appreciate it, Mr. Tarnhorst,\" Georges had said.  \"Carelessness. Just plain carelessness on the part of the workers. That is what has caused your rise in death rates. You people out here in the Belt have become too used to being in space. Familiarity breeds contempt, Mr. Alhamid.  \"Steps must be taken to curb that carelessness. I suggest a publicity campaign of some kind. The people must be thoroughly indoctrinated in safety procedures and warned against carelessness. Just a few months of schooling isn't enough, Mr. Alhamid. You've got to start pounding it into their heads early.  \"If you don't--\" He shook his head. (He had grown used to doing so in low gravity by now.) \"If the death rate isn't cut down, we shall have to raise the premium rates, and I don't know what will happen on the floor of the People's Congress. However, I think I can guarantee six months to a year before any steps are taken. That will give you time to launch your safety campaign.

BY   A CITIZEN-SOLDIER.   \"We must be brief when Traitors brave the Field.\"    NEW YORK:   _Carleton, Publisher, 413 Broadway._   M DCCC LXIV.      Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1864, by   GEO. W. CARLETON,   In the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States for  the Southern District of New York.    R. CRAIGHEAD,   Printer, Stereotyper, and Electrotyper   +Carton Building+,   _81, 83, and 85 Centre Street_.     PREFACE.   \"Greek-fire has shivered the statue of John C. Calhoun in the streets of the City of Charleston,\"--so the papers say. Whether true or not, the Greek-fire of the righteous indignation of a loyal people is fast shattering the offspring of his infamous teachings,--the armed treason of the South, and its more cowardly ally the insidious treachery that lurks under doubtful cover in the loyal States. In thunder tones do the masses declare, that now and for ever, they repudiate the Treason and despise the Traitor. Nobly are the hands of our Honest President sustained in prosecuting this most righteous war.  In a day like this, the least that can be expected of any citizen is--duty. We are all co-partners in our beneficent government. We should be co-laborers for her defence. Jealous of the interests of her brave soldiery; for they are our own. Proud of their noble deeds; they constitute our National Heritage.  If these campaign sketches, gathered in actual service during 1862-3, and grouped during the spare hours of convalescence from a camp fever, correct one of the least of the abuses in our military machinery--if they lighten the toil of the humblest of our soldiers, or nerve anew the resolves of loyalty tempted to despair, the writer will have no reason to complain of labor lost. Great latitude of excuse for the existence of abuses must be allowed, when we consider the suddenness with which our volunteers sprang into ranks at the outset of the Rebellion. Now that the warfare is a system, there is less reason for their continuance. Reformers must, however, remember, that to keep our citizen-soldiery effective, they must not make too much of the citizen and too little of the soldier. Abuses must be corrected under the laws; but to be corrected at all they must first be exposed.  Drunkenness, half-heartedness, and senseless routine, have done much to cripple the patriotic efforts of our people. The patriotism of the man who at this day doubts the policy of their open reproof can well be questioned. West Point has, in too many instances, nursed imbecility and treason; but in our honest contempt for the small men of whom, in common with other institutions, she has had her share,--we must not ignore those bright pages of our history adorned with the skill and heroism of her nobler sons. McClellanism did not follow its chief from Warrenton; or Burnside's earnestness, Hooker's dash, and Meade's soldierly stand at Gettysburg, backed as they were by the heroic fighting of the Army of the Potomac, would have had, as they deserved, more decisive results.  The Young Men of the Land would the writer address in the following pages--\"because they are strong,\" and in their strength is the nation's hope. In certain prospect of victory over the greatest enemy we have yet had as a nation--the present infamous rebellion--we can well await patiently the correction of minor evils.            \"Meanwhile we'll sacrifice to liberty,           Remember, O my friends! the laws, the rights,           The generous plan of power delivered down           From age to age by your renowned forefathers,           (So dearly bought, the price of so much blood;)           Oh, let it never perish in your hands!           But piously transmit it to your children.           Do thou, great liberty! inspire our souls,           And make our lives in thy possession happy.           Or our deaths glorious in thy just defence.\"  February, 1864.     TABLE OF CONTENTS.  CHAPTER I.
