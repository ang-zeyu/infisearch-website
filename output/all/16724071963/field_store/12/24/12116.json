SMITH                 _Anyone who holds that telepathy and psi               powers would mean an end to crime quite               obviously underestimates the ingenuity of               the human race. Now consider a horserace               that_ had _to be fixed ..._   It was April, a couple of weeks before the Derby. We were playing poker, which is a game of skill that has nothing to do with the velocity of horse meat.  Phil Howland kept slipping open but he managed to close up before I could tell whether the combination of Three-Five-Two-Four meant a full house of fives over fours or whether he was betting on an open-ended straight that he hadn't bothered to arrange in order as he held them. The Greek was impenetrable; he also blocked me from reading the deck so that I could estimate his hand from the cards that weren't dealt out. Chicago Charlie's mind was easy to read but no one could trust him. He was just as apt to think high to score someone out as he was to think low to suck the boys in. As for me, there I was, good old Wally Wilson, holding a pat straight flush from the eight to the queen of diamonds. I was thinking \"full house\" but I was betting like a weak three of a kind.  It was a terrific game. Between trying to read into these other guy's brains and keeping them from opening mine, and blocking the Greek's sly stunt of tipping over the poker chips as a distraction, I was also concerned about the eight thousand bucks that was in the pot. The trouble was that all four of us fully intended to rake it in. My straight flush would be good for the works in any normal game with wild cards, but the way this bunch was betting I couldn't be sure. Phil Howland didn't have much of a shield but he could really read, and if he read me--either my mind or my hand--he'd automatically radiate and that would be that.  I was about at the point of calling for the draw when the door opened without any knock. It was Tomboy Taylor. We'd been so engrossed with one another that none of us had caught her approach.  The Greek looked up at her and swore something that he hadn't read in Plato. \"Showdown,\" he said, tossing in his hand.  I grunted and spread my five beauties.  Phil growled and shoved the pot in my direction, keeping both eyes on Tomboy Taylor.  She was something to keep eyes on, both figuratively and literally. The only thing that kept her from being a thionite dream was the Pittsburgh stogie that she insisted upon smoking, and the only thing that kept her from being some man's companion in spite of the stogie was the fact that he'd have to keep his mouth shut or she'd steal his back teeth--if not for fillings, then for practice.  \"You, Wally Wilson,\" she said around the cigar, \"get these grifters out of here. I got words.\"  The Greek growled. \"Who says?\"  \"Barcelona says.\"  I do not have to explain who Barcelona is. All I have to say is that Phil Howland, The Greek, and Chicago Charlie arose without a word and filed out with their minds all held tight behind solid shields.         *       *       *       *       *  I said, \"What does Barcelona want with me?\"  Tomboy Taylor removed the stogie and said evenly, \"Barcelona wants to see it Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace next month.\"  When I got done gulping I said, \"You mean Barcelona wants me to fix the Kentucky Derby?\"  \"Oh no,\" she replied in a very throaty contralto that went with her figure and her thousand dollars worth of simple skirt and blouse. \"You needn't 'Fix' anything. Just be sure that it's Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace in that order. One, two, three. Do I make Barcelona quite clear?\"  I said, \"Look, Tomboy, neither of them platers can even _run_ that far, let alone running ahead.\"  \"Barcelona says they can. And will.\" She leaned forward and stubbed out the Pittsburgh stogie and in the gesture she became wholly beautiful as well as beautifully wholesome. As she leaned toward me she unfogged the lighter surface of her mind and let me dig the faintly-leaking concept that she considered me physically attractive. This did not offend me. To the contrary it pleased my ego mightily until Tomboy Taylor deliberately let the barrier down to let me read the visual impression--which included all of the implications contained in the old clich√©: \"... And don't he look nacheral?\"  \"How,\" I asked on the recoil, \"can I fix the Derby?\"  \"Barcelona says you know more about the horse racing business than any other big time operator in Chicago,\" she said smoothly. \"Barcelona says that he doesn't know anything about horse racing at all, but he has great faith in your ability. Barcelona says that if anybody can make it Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace, one, two, and three, Wally Wilson is the man who can do it. In fact, Barcelona will be terribly disappointed if you can't.\"  I eyed her carefully. She was a composed and poised beauty who looked entirely incapable of uttering such words. I tried to peer into her mind but it was like trying to read the fine print of a telephone directory through a knitted woolen shawl. She smiled at me, her shapely lips curving graciously.  I said, \"Barcelona seems to have a lot of confidence in my ability to arrange things.\"  With those delicate lips still curved sweetly, she said, \"Barcelona is willing to bet money on your ability as a manager.\"  At this point Tomboy Taylor fished another Pittsburgh stogie out of her hundred dollar handbag, bit off the end with a quick nibble of even, pearly-white teeth, and stuffed the cigar in between the arched lips. She scratched a big kitchen match on the seat of her skirt after raising one shapely thigh to stretch the cloth. She puffed the stogie into light and became transformed from a beauty into a hag. My mind swore; it was like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa.  Out of the corner of her mouth she replied to my unspoken question: \"It helps to keep grippers like you at mind's length.\"  Then she left me alone with my littered card table and the eight thousand buck final pot--_and_ the unhappy recollection that Barcelona had gotten upset at something Harold Grimmer had done, and he'd gone into Grimmer's place and busted Grimmer flat by starting with one lousy buck and letting it ride through eighteen straight passes. This feat of skill was performed under the mental noses of about eight operators trained to exert their extrasensory talents toward the defeat of sharpshooters who tried to add paraphysics to the laws of chance.         *       *       *       *       *  Lieutenant Delancey of the Chicago police came in an hour later. He refused my offer of a drink, and a smoke, and then because I didn't wave him to a chair he crossed my living room briskly and eased himself into my favorite chair. I think I could have won the waiting game but the prize wasn't good enough to interest me in playing. So I said, \"O.K., lieutenant, what am I supposed to be guilty of?\"  His smile was veiled. \"You're not guilty of anything, so far as I know.\"  \"You're not here to pass the time of day.\"  \"No, I'm not. I want information.\"  \"What kind of information?\"  \"One hears things,\" he said vaguely.  \"Lieutenant,\" I said, \"you've been watching one of those halluscene whodunit dramas where everybody stands around making witty sayings composed of disconnected phrases. You'll next be saying 'Evil Lurks In The Minds Of Men,' in a sepulchral intonation. Let's skip it, huh? What kind of things does one hear and from whom?\"  \"It starts with Gimpy Gordon.\"  \"Whose mind meanders.\"  He shrugged. \"Gimpy Gordon's meandering mind is well understood for what it is,\" he said. \"But when it ceases to meander long enough to follow a single train of thought from beginning to logical end, then something is up.\"  \"Such as what, for instance.\"  The lieutenant leaned back in my easy-chair and stared at the ceiling. \"Wally,\" he said, \"I was relaxing in the car with Sergeant Holliday driving. We passed a certain area on Michigan near Randolph and I caught the strong mental impression of someone who--in this day and age, mind you--had had the temerity to pickpocket a wallet containing twenty-seven dollars. The sum of twenty-seven dollars was connected with the fact that the rewards made the risk worth taking; there were distinct impressions of playing that twenty-seven bucks across the board on three very especial nags at the Derby. The impression of the twenty-seven bucks changed into a mental vision of a hand holding a sack of peanuts. There was indecision. Should he take more risk and run up his available cash to make a larger killing, or would one Joseph Barcelona take a stand-offish attitude if some outsider were to lower the track odds by betting a bundle on Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace.\"  I said, \"Lieutenant, you've a pickpocket to jug. Horse betting is legal.\"  \"Since wagering on the speed of a horse has been redefined as 'The purchase of one corporate share to be valid for one transaction only and redeemable at a par value to be established by the outcome of this aforesaid single transaction,' horse betting is legal. This makes you an 'Investment Counselor, short-term transactions only,' and removes from you the odious nomenclature of 'Bookie.' However, permit me to point out that the buying and selling of shares of horseflesh does not grant a license to manipulate the outcome.\"  \"You sound as though you're accusing me of contemplating a fix.\"  \"Oh no. Not that.\"  \"Then what?\"  \"Wally, Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace were refused by the National Association Of Dog Food Canners because of their substandard health. If I'm not mistaken, the Derby Association should have to run the race early that Saturday afternoon.\"  \"Early?\"  \"Uh-huh. Early. Y'see, Wally, the blue laws of the blue grass state make it illegal to run horseraces on Sunday, hence the start of the Derby must be early enough to let our three platers complete the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23599"],["title","The Big Fix (#1)"],["body","before midnight.\"  \"Lieutenant, there still stands a mathematical probability that--\"  \"That the rest of the field will catch the Martian Glanders as they lead our three dogs past the clubhouse turn?\"  \"Lieutenant, you are wronging me.\"  \"I haven't said a thing.\"  \"Then why have you come here to bedevil me, lieutenant? If Barcelona has ideas of arranging a fix--\"  \"If Barcelona has such notions, Wally Wilson would know about it.\"  \"Everybody,\" I said, \"entertains notions of cleaning up a bundle by having the hundred-to-one shot come in by a length. Even Barcelona must have wild dreams now and then--\"  \"Come off it,\" he snapped. \"Something's up and I want to know what's cooking.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Lieutenant, you're now asking me to describe to you how someone might rig the Kentucky Derby in a world full of expert telepaths and perceptives and manipulators, a large number of which will be rather well-paid to lend their extrasensory power to the process of keeping the Derby pure.\"  He eyed me sourly. \"Remember, 'Fireman' O'Leary?\"  \"That's an unfair allegation,\" I replied. \"The rumor that he started the Chicago Fire is absolutely unfounded.\"  \"As I recall, 'Fireman' O'Leary came by his nickname about one hundred years after the holocaust that started on DeKoven Street in 1871. It seems that 'Fireman' O'Leary was most useful in helping the fillies home at Washington Park by assaulting them in the region of the bangtail with small bollops of pure incandescence. He was a pyrotic.\"  \"That is a false accusation--\"  \"It was never proved,\" admitted the lieutenant, \"because any one who accused anybody of making use of extrasensory faculties in 1971 would have been tossed into that establishment out on Narragansett Avenue where the headshrinkers once plied their mystic trade.\"  \"Things are different now.\"  \"Indeed they are, Wally. Which is why I'm here. No one but a fumbling idiot would try anything as crude as speeding a dog over the line by pyrotics or by jolting the animals with a bolt of electrical energy.\"  \"So--?\"  \"So considering the sad and sorry fact that human nature does not change very much despite the vast possibility for improvement, we must anticipate a fix that has been contrived and executed on a level that takes full cognizance of the widespread presence of psi-function.\"  \"But again, why me?\"  \"Was not 'Fireman' O'Leary an ancestor of yours?\"  \"He was my maternal grandparent.\"  \"And so you do indeed come from a long line of horse operators, don't you?\"  \"I resent your invidious implications.\"  \"And wasn't 'Wireless' Wilson the paternal ancestor from whom the family name has come?\"  \"I fail to see ... the allegation that my father's father employed telepathy to transmit track information faster than the wire services has never been proved.\"  He smiled knowingly. \"Wally,\" he said slowly, \"if you feel that allegations have somehow impugned the pure name of your family, you could apply for a review of their several appearances in court. It's possible that 'Fireman' O'Leary did _not_ use his pyrotic talent to enhance the running speed of some tired old dogs.\"  \"But--\"  \"So I think we understand one another, Wally. There is also reason to believe that psionic talent tends to run in families. You're a psi-man and a good one.\"  \"If I hear of anything--\"  \"You'll let me know,\" he said flatly. \"And if Flying Heels, Moonbeam, _and-or_ Lady Grace even so much as succeed in staying on their feet for the whole race, I'll be back demanding to know how you--Wally Wilson--managed to hold them up!\"  After which the good Lieutenant Delancey left me to my thoughts--which were most uncomfortable.  Barcelona had to be kept cheerful. But the dogs he'd picked could only come in first unassisted if they happened to be leading the field that started the _next_ race, and even then the post time would have to be delayed to give them a longer head start. That meant that _if_ our three platers came awake, _everybody_ would be looking for the fix.  Anybody who planned a caper would sure have to plan it well.  Barcelona hadn't planned the fix, he merely stated a firm desire and either Barcelona got what he wanted or I got what I didn't want, and I had to do it real good or Delancey would make it real hot for me.  I was not only being forced to enter a life of crime, I was also being forced to perform cleverly.  It wasn't fair for the law to gang up with the crooks against me.  And so with a mind feeling sort of like the famous sparrow who'd gotten trapped for three hours in a badminton game at Forest Hills, I built a strong highball, and poured it down while my halluscene set was warming up. I needed the highball as well as the relaxation, because I knew that the \"Drama\" being presented was the hundred and umpty-umpth remake of \"Tarzan of the Apes\" and for ninety solid minutes I would be swinging through trees without benefit of alcohol. Tarzan, you'll remember, did not learn to smoke and drink until the second book.         *       *       *       *       *  The halluscene did relax me and kept my mind from its worry even though the drama was cast for kids and therefore contained a maximum of tree-swinging and ape-gymnastics and a near dearth of Lady Jane's pleasant company. What was irritating was the traces of wrong aroma. If one should not associate the African jungle with the aroma of a cheap bar, one should be forgiven for objecting to Lady Jane with a strong flavor of tobacco and cheap booze on her breath.  And so I awoke with this irritating conflict in my senses to discover that I'd dropped out of my character as Tarzan and my surroundings of the jungle, but I'd somehow brought the stench of cheap liquor and moist cigarettes with me.  There was an occupant in the chair next to mine. He needed a bath and he needed a shave but both would have been wasted if he couldn't change his clothing, too. His name was Gimpy Gordon.  I said, \"Get out!\"  He whined, \"Mr. Wilson, you just gotta help me.\"  \"How?\"  \"Fer years,\" he said, \"I been living on peanuts. I been runnin' errands for hard coins. I been--\"  \"Swiping the take of a Red Cross box,\" I snapped at him.  \"Aw, Mr. Wilson,\" he whined, \"I simply gotta make a stake. I'm a-goin' to send it back when I win.\"  \"Are you going to win?\"  \"Can't I?\"  For a moment I toyed with the idea of being honest with the Gimp. Somehow, someone should tell the duffer that all horse players die broke, or that if he could make a living I'd be out of business.  Gimpy Gordon was one of Life's Unfortunates. If it were to rain gold coins, Gimpy would be out wearing boxing gloves. His mental processes meandered because of too much methyl. His unfortunate nickname did not come from the old-fashioned reason that he walked with a limp, but from the even more unfortunate reason that he _thought_ with a limp. In his own unhealthy way he was--could we call it \"Lucky\" by any standard of honesty? In this world full of highly developed psi talent, the Gimp _could_ pick a pocket and get away with it because he often literally could not remember where and how he'd acquired the wallet for longer than a half minute. And it was a sort of general unwritten rule that any citizen so utterly befogged as to permit his wealth to be lifted via light fingers should lose it as a lesson!  But then it did indeed occur to me that maybe I could make use of the Gimp.  I said, \"What can I do, Gimpy?\"  \"Mr. Wilson,\" he pleaded, \"is it true that you're workin' for Barcelona?\"  \"Now, you know I can't answer that.\"  I could read his mind struggling with this concept. It was sort of like trying to read a deck of Chinese Fortune Cards being shuffled before they're placed in the machine at the Penny Arcade. As the drunk once said after reading the Telephone Directory: \"Not much plot, but _egad_! What a cast of characters!\" The gist of his mental maundering was a childlike desire to have everything sewed up tight. He wanted to win, to be told that he'd win, and to have all the rules altered ad hoc to assure his winning.  Just where he'd picked up the inside dope that Barcelona favored Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace in the Derby I could not dig out of him. Just how Gimpy had made the association between this clambake and me--good old Wally Wilson--I couldn't dig either. But here he was with his--by now--sixty-five bucks carefully heisted, lifted, pinched and fingered, and by the great Harry, Gimpy was not a-goin' to lay it across the board on those three rejects from a claiming race unless he had a cast-iron assurance that they'd come in across the board, one, two, and three.  I said slowly, \"_If_ I were even thinking of working for Mr. Barcelona,\" I told him, \"I would be very careful never, never to mention it, you know.\"         *       *       *       *       *  This bundle of The Awful Truth hit him and began to sink in with the inexorable absorption of water dropping down into a bucket of dry sand. It took some time for the process to climax. Once it reached Home Base it took another period of time for the information to be inspected, sorted out, identified, analyzed, and in a very limited degree, understood.  [Illustration]  He looked up at me. \"I couldn't cuff a hundred, could I?\"  I shook my head. I didn't have to veil my mind because I knew that Gimpy was about as talented a telepath as a tallow candle. Frankly between me and thee, dear reader, I do not put anybody's bet on the cuff. I do a fair-to-middling brisk trade in booking bets placed and discussed by telepathy, but the ones I accept and pay off on--if they're lucky--are those folks who've been sufficiently foresighted to lay it on the line with a retainer against which their losses can be assessed.  On the other hand I could see in Gimpy's mind the simple logic that told him that as a bookmaker I'd be disinclined to lend him money which he'd use to place with me against a sure-thing long shot.
