We're b----\"  And his lips would not frame the word.  Only, in their hearts they knew it was true; and in their hearts a dreadful hopelessness wormed its bitter way.  But crushing it down there was another feeling--stronger and more powerful.  England _could_ not be beaten, _would_ not be beaten; the thing was impossible, unbelievable.  Triumphant it arose, that great certainty.  It arose then, and has never died since, though at times the sky has been black and the storm clouds ominous.  They knew that all would be well; and now--after three years--all is well.  Their faith has been justified, the faith of the men who waited their call to the work.  Only a small proportion remain to see that justification with their own eyes; the Land has claimed the rest.  Ypres, the Marne, Neuve Chapelle, Festubert--names well-nigh forgotten in the greater battles of to-day--in each and all of them the seed of \"a contemptible little Army\" has been sown.  Thus it was ordained in the Book of Fate.  But at the moment there were just two men, sick of heart, watching the sun, in a blaze of golden glory, setting over Gozo. . . .   X  Draycott's deliverance from the Half Way House came in three or four weeks.  With the men swarming in the rigging, and the Territorials who had come to replace them cheering from the shore, the transport moved slowly down the Grand Harbour past the French and British warships that lay at anchor.  It would indeed be pleasing to record the fact that the departing warriors sang patriotic songs concerning their country's greatness; and that the officers with a few well-chosen words improved the shining hour, and pointed the moral of the great Entente with special reference to the warships around them.  But being a truthful--or, shall we say, comparatively truthful--historian, I regret that it cannot be done.  Such songs as did rise above the medley of catcalls and gibes of a dark nature which passed in playful badinage between the sister services were of a nature exclusively frivolous; and the conversation of such officers as were not consuming the midday cocktail consisted entirely of a great thankfulness that they had seen the last of an abominable island, and a fervent prayer that they would never see it again.  The relief of it--the blessed relief!  They would be in time for the end of the show any way, which was something.  They were not going to miss it all; they would be able to look their pals in the face after it was over.  A few, it is true, shook their heads and communed together in secret places: a paltry few, who looked serious, and spoke of a long war and a bloody war such as had never been thought of.  Avaunt pessimism! war was war, and a damned good show at the best of times for those who were trained to its ways.  The Germans had asked for it for years, and now they had got it--and serve 'em right.  A good sporting show, and with any luck they would get the fag end of the hunting at home after peace was declared.  Thus it was, nearly three years ago; thus it has been, with slight modifications, ever since.  A nation of sportsmen going merrily forth, with the ideal of sport as their guide, to fight a nation of swine, with the ideal of fouling as theirs.  And so the world wags on in its funny old way, while the gods laugh, and laugh, and laugh. . . .   XI  On the boat Draycott hardly realised.  For the first week of the three he spent in England he hardly realised--he was too excited.  He was going out; that was all that mattered; until one morning his eyes were opened to his personal case.  It is easy to see things where others are concerned; but in one's own case. . . .  He was at home on three days' leave, and the girl was there too.  \"Good Lord!\" he remarked at breakfast; \"Jerry Thornton gone too.\"  His eye was running down the casualty list.  \"Whole battalion must have taken it in the neck--five officers killed, fourteen wounded.  I wish to heaven----\"  He looked up, and the words died away on his lips.  \"I didn't realise what war meant to women.\"  His remarks at the Gare de Lyon hit him like a blow.  For he had seen the look in the girl's eyes; he had seen the look in his mother's.  Blotted out at once, it is true; effaced the instant they had realised he was watching them; but--too late.  He had seen.  \"Was that Major Thornton, dear?\"  His mother was speaking.  \"The one who shot so well?\"  Her voice was casual; her acting superb.  And God! how they can act--these women of ours.  For a moment something stuck in his throat.  He saw just such another breakfast room, with a woman staring with dull eyes at the laconic name in the paper: a name which so baldly confirmed the wire she had had three days before.  Stunned, still dazed by the shock, she sat silently, apathetically; as yet she could hardly feel the blow which Fate had dealt her.  In time perhaps; just now--well, it couldn't be; there must be some mistake.  Other men had died--true; but--not hers. He was different; there must be some mistake. . . .  For each and every name in that list Clive Draycott of a sudden realised the same thing was occurring.  And then he saw it--personally; he felt it--personally; he realised that it concerned him--personally. Those other women had looked, just as had his mother and the girl, a few weeks ago.  Those other women had laughed and joked and asked casual questions to cover their true feelings, just the same.  Those other women had been through it all and----  \"We only see them before we go--never after.\"  In the theatre, at the restaurant, playing the fool with us, dancing with us--then we see them; afterwards--when the train has gone and we are looking out of the window or talking with the man opposite, then, we do not see them.  And it is just as well.  \"Mon Dieu!  Quelle v√¢che de guerre.\" . . .  Something of all this did Draycott feel at that moment; something which caught him and shook him and mocked him.  Something which whispered, \"You ass, you wretched ass!  You think it's you who will suffer; you think it's you who will be acclaimed a hero.  Fool!  Your sufferings, your achievements, whether you live or die, are as nothing to those of these two women.  You may wear the cross for a moment's heroism: they bear it all the time.  And they get no praise; they just endure.\" . . .  Yes; something like that struck him for the first time as being personally applicable to himself.  And having looked thoughtfully out of the window for a moment, he laughed gently, and then he spoke.  \"That's the fellow,\" he remarked quietly.  \"An' if the tea ain't cold I'll take another dish.  Three glasses of the old man's port, Dolly, is enough.  I had four last night.\"   XII  A week later he sat in a mud bath at Havre, which went by the name of a rest camp; the Way to the Land was nearly trodden.  Thousands of others had sat in that glutinous mud before him; hundreds of thousands were destined to do so after.  And each and all of them were thinking men; wondering in a greater or less degree according to the size and activity of their grey matter what it was all about.  To some the Unknown gave the prospect of sport, and they thanked their stars they were nearly there; to some it gave the prospect of Duty, and they trusted they would not fail.  With some the fear of the future blotted out their curiosity; with others curiosity left no room for fear.  But in every case they had something to think about--even if it were only the intense discomfort of their surroundings.  And in every case the woman over the water had--nothing.  By cattle trucks and carriages, by so-called fast trains and unabashed troop trains they left in batches big and small; and others came and filled the gaps.  The Land was calling; the Seed must not be delayed.      *    *    *    *    *    *  \"You'll have to wait till it's dark.\"  A weary Quartermaster, wandering through Ypres, met Draycott and stopped.  \"Thank God! you've come. We've got three officers left and a hundred and twenty men.\"  \"Where are they?\" he demanded.  \"How shall I find them?\"  \"Very likely you won't.\"  The other laughed mirthlessly.  \"I'll take you up to-night--we walk the last bit to the trenches.  If a flare goes up--stand still; there's no other rule.\"  \"You're about done in, Seymour,\" said Draycott, watching him keenly. \"What's the trouble?\"  \"The trouble is Hell.\"  The Quartermaster passed his hand wearily over his forehead.  \"Utter, absolute, complete--Hell.  The boys have been in the front line for twenty-one days; and\"--he spoke with a sudden dreadful earnestness--\"the end is not far off.\"  \"My God!\" muttered Draycott, \"is it as bad as that?\"      *    *    *    *    *    *  No trenches, no dug outs, no reserves.  Ceaseless German attacks, rain, mud, death.  And then, three or four days of icy coldness, with the bitter Arctic wind cutting the sodden, tired, breaking men like a knife.  Fighting every hour, with rifles and bayonets and fists--sleepless, tired out, finished.  Only a spirit which made possible the impossible supported them: only the glory of their traditions held the breaking line of Old Contemptibles to the end.  And at the end--they died. . . .  But their spirit lives on, undimmed, untarnished.  It is the spirit of the New Armies--the Civilian Armies of Britain.  They were training back in England when Clive Draycott went to the Land: they were learning the message of the old Regulars from New Zealand to Yukon.  It is not learned in a day--that message: there is much watering and weeding to do before the seed can reach perfection, but the Land would not wait. . . .  It was greedy then--as now; the only difference was the amount of grain available.  And when Clive Draycott went to it there was very little.  To God Almighty the praise.  What there was, was very good.     PART II   THE LAND      I.  A DAY OF PEACE    II.  OVER THE"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23874"],["title","No Man's Land (#5)"],["body","III.

THE SONG OF THE BAYONET     I  A DAY OF PEACE  \"For the fourteenth morning in succession I rise to a point of order. Why is there no marmalade?\"  The Doctor glared round the breakfast table. \"I perceive a pot of unhealthy-looking damson, and a tin of golden syrup, the greater part of which now adorns the infant's face.  Why is there no marmalade?\"  \"Could I remind you that there is a war on two miles up the road, my splay-footed bolus-booster?\"  With a grand rolling of his R's, the man who had driven a railway through the Rocky Mountains, and who now boasted the badges of a subaltern in His Majesty's Corps of Royal Engineers, let drive.  \"Ye come to live with us much against our will, because you're a poor homeless wanderer----\"  \"All dressed up and nowhere to go,\" broke in the Doctor mournfully.  \"You come to live with us, I say,\" went on the Scotchman, \"and then do nothing but criticise our food and our morals.\"  \"Heaven knows they both need it.  Pass me what's left of the syrup, little one.  Scrape the rest of it off your chin, my cherub, and wrap it up in a handkerchief and take it up to the trenches with you.\"  \"You're vewy wude.\"  The junior subaltern adjusted the balance in the matter of the letter R with the Scotchman.  Two months ago he had been at home--in peace time he would still have been at school.  But of such mixtures is the present British Army made.  \"It's my face.\"  As a statement of fact the remark left nothing to be desired; as a statement of expediency, when other infants were present, the same cannot be said.  Words, in fact, were trembling on the tongue of a veteran of six months when the C.O. came suddenly into the room.  \"Bring me an egg,\" he shouted to the mess waiter in the kitchen next door.  \"Listen to this, my bonnie boys.\"  He produced a paper from his coat pocket and sat down at the table.  \"Secret.  A large object has fallen beside the sap leading out to Vesuvius crater.  It is about the size of a rum jar, and is thought to be filled with explosive.  It has been covered with sandbags and its early removal would seem desirable, as the sap is frequently bombarded--Damn it, this egg's addled.  Take it away, it's got spots on it.  Where did I get to?  Oh! yes--bombarded with aerial darts and rifle grenades.\"  He replaced the paper in his pocket and reached for the teapot.  \"Thought to be filled with explosive!\"  The Scotchman looked up sarcastically from the letter he was censoring.  \"What's it likely to be filled with?\"  \"Marmalade, ducky,\" remarked the Doctor, still harping on his grievance.  \"In addition to that the Pumpkin desires my presence at the Centre Battalion Head-quarters at 10 ak emma.\"  The C.O. was prodding his second egg suspiciously.  The Pumpkin, it may be explained in parenthesis, was the not unsuitable nickname of the Divisional General.  \"Is the old man coming round the trenches?\" Jackson, the subaltern in whose tender care reposed the crater of Vesuvius and all that appertained thereto, including rum jars, looked up with mild interest.  The C.O. glanced at the message beside him.  \"'The G.O.C. wishes to meet the Engineer Officer in charge of Left Section, at Centre Battalion Headquarters, at 10 a.m., A.A.A.  Message ends.'  There in a nutshell you have the glorious news.\"  Breakfast is never a loquacious meal, and for a while silence reigned, broken only by a few desultory remarks as to the vileness of the food produced by the officer responsible for the mess catering, and the exorbitant price he demanded for it--statements which had staled with much vain repetition.  \"For heaven's sake dry up,\" he remarked peevishly.  \"You've had sardines on toast twenty-one nights running; what more do you want?  Listen to the words of Sapper Mackintosh--the pudding-faced marvel.  This\"--he held up a letter--\"is the fifth which he hopes will find the recipient as it leaves him at present--in the pink, and with the dreadful pains in his stummik quite gone.\"  \"Our Doctor has a wonderful bedside manner,\" remarked the Scotchman. \"Did ye no hear the story of him and the lady way back by Hazebrook?\"  \"That'll do,\" said the Doctor, rising hurriedly.  \"She had very bad rheumatism--that poor girl.\"  \"I know she had, Doc,\" put in the C.O. heartily.  \"And when I think of the way you eased her sufferings I became lost in admiration over the noble nature of your calling.  In the meantime I'd be glad if you'd see one of the men in the Head-quarters Section.  From the strange explosive noises he made when I spoke to him before breakfast I gathered by the aid of an interpreter that he had somewhat foolishly placed his complete set of uppers and lowers on a truss of compressed hay, and one of the mules has eaten them.\"  He strolled to the door on his way to the kitchen in the next house that served as his office.  \"You'd better be careful with that rum jar, Jacko.  Unless you're pretty certain there's no danger, I'd put a slab of gun-cotton against it where it is, and pop her off.  No sense in running any risks carrying it back.\"  \"Right-ho!  I'll have a look as soon as I go up.  Are you coming, Mac?\" He turned to the Scotchman.  \"In five minutes, my boy.  I have to perform a few blasting operations on my pipe before I start, and then I'm with you.\"  He pulled a battered veteran out of his pocket, and peered into its noisome bowl.  \"Not indoors, man, for heaven's sake!\"  The Doctor backed hurriedly out of the room.  \"The last billet you cleaned your pipe in they complained to the Mayor of the village.\"  \"Go away, Doctor, go away.  Go and put chloride of lime round the cook-house,\" Mac was shouting through the window at the receding medico. \"And ask yon woman if she has a hairpin.  My pipe. . . .\"  But the Doctor was out of sight.  Ten minutes later the room was empty save for a batman clearing the breakfast table.      *    *    *    *    *    *  Now as a general rule the Sappers do not live in the trenches, but go up there each day and most nights, the remainder of the time being spent in dwellings of dubious sanitation and indubitable draughtiness a mile or so in rear.  To each company a certain front is allotted, and it is their joy and pride to maintain this front and the network of trenches behind it spotless and untarnished, what time they minister ceaselessly to the lightest whim of its heroic defenders--usually known by the generic term of P.B.I., or poor bally Infantry.  Which, of course, is not what really happens, but one likes to think thus beautifully.  In addition to the Infantry, other people thrust themselves forward in a manner which requires firmness and tact to deal with: gunners require O.P.'s, or observation posts; other gunners require trench mortar emplacements; dangerous men with machine guns sit up and take notice, and demand concrete and other abominations; while last, but not least, the medical profession demand secret and secure places in which to practise their nefarious trade.  Finally, the Ordnance Department is with one always.  It was that branch of the great Machine which caused the frown on the face of the Sapper Captain, hitherto alluded to as the O.C., while next door the batman cleared the breakfast table.  \"We're six bicycles short, you say, Quartermaster-Sergeant?\" he exclaimed irritably, gazing at some papers in front of him, while he filled his pipe.  \"Yes, sir; and two more with wheels buckled, and three that free-wheel both ways.\"  \"What d'you mean--free-wheel both ways?\"  \"The pedals rotate, sir, with great speed, but the bicycle remains motionless.\"  When a man habitually calls an armchair, A chair, arm--Officers, for the use of, one--his conversation is apt to become stilted.  \"How were the wheels buckled?\" demanded the Captain when he had digested this great thought.  \"Two of the officers, sir--playing what I believe they called bicycle polo with a brick and two pick-helves--had--er--a slight mishap.\"  \"When did it happen?\"  \"Er--after dinner, sir, one night.\"  The N.C.O. looked tactfully out of the window.  The officer did not pursue the topic.  \"Well, what about these six that have been lost?\"  \"Completely destroyed by shell-fire,\" said the C.Q.M.S. firmly.  \"I have prepared a statement of what happened for your perusal and signature.\" He handed the officer a written paper and respectfully withdrew a few paces to avoid any semblance of coercion.  \"'The six bicycles were placed on the morning of the 10th ult. against the entrance to the R.E. Dump at A.21, C.2.4.  It would appear that during the absence of the riders a hostile shell of large calibre fell on the six said bicycles, completely demolishing them, for when the riders returned after the day's work merely a few fragments remained scattered round the shell crater.'\"  The Captain read it over slowly, and then, in tones of awe, a murmured \"Wonderful\" wafted through the office.  \"I beg your pardon, sir?\"  The N.C.O. was again at his side.  \"I said wonderful, Quartermaster-Sergeant--quite wonderful.  Do you think they'll swallow it?\"  \"It has been done before, sir.\"  The tone was non-committal.  \"And one of the six was undoubtedly badly punctured by a stray rifle bullet before we lost it--er--that is, before it was finally destroyed by shell-fire.\"  \"Right.\"  With the air of a man who communes with great destinies, the Captain signed his name.  \"Anything more?\"  \"Nothing at present, sir.  The question of the consumption of Candles, Tallow dip, Pounds Twenty-four, stolen from our yard by the 940th Tunnelling Company has come back again with remarks from the Chief Ordnance Officer at the Base--but it will wait until you come back from the trenches.\"  \"I'm glad of that,\" remarked the Captain, rising.  \"I'm not feeling very strong this morning, and candles, tallow dip--especially lbs. 24 of them--would cause a relapse.  Orderly\"--he strolled to the door--\"my "]]]
