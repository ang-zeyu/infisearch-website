LII    YESTERDAY this Day's Foozling did prepare; TO-MORROW'S Slicing will not yield to Prayer:   Play! for you know not whence you came, nor why: Play! for you know not why you go, nor where.   LIII    I TELL you this--When, after youth was past, A kindly Heav'n gave me to Golf at last;   No Freedom but I gladly barter'd for The satisfying Bond that holds me fast.   LIV    AND this I know: there is a Charm about The quiet State of Golf, tho' fools may flout,   That with its magic has unlock'd the Door Of Happiness they only howl without.         *       *       *       *       *   LV    AS under cover of departing Day Slinks the defeated Duffer on his way,   Once more within the Maker's house alone I stood, surrounded by the Tools of Play.   LVI    CLUBS of all Sorts and Sizes, great and small, That stood along the floor and by the wall;   And some old batter'd Veterans were; and some Had swung perhaps, but never driv'n at all.   LVII    SAID one among them--\"Surely not for naught Tom Morris fashion'd me with anxious thought,   Has not my Form won many a Match and Cup? And yet--and yet--I am no longer bought.\"   LVIII    THEN said a Second--\"Hear the Codger croak! Sure he would make of Golf an ancient Joke;   But Me--just think! a modern Willie Park, My fickle Owner cannot sell nor soak!\"   LIX    AFTER a momentary silence spake A Brassie of a more ungainly make--   \"They sneer at me for leaning all awry: Well, then, I ask who won the last Sweepstake?\"   LX    WHEREAT some one of the loquacious Lot, I think a putting Niblick, or if not,   A driving Putter, or a goose-neck'd Cleek-- \"Pray, what is Golf then,--and the Golfer what?\"   LXI    \"WHY,\" said another, \"Some there are who say That Golf is but a Game that Golfers play,   And some that Life is but a mighty Green, And Golf the Art to use it day by day.\"   LXII    \"WELL,\" murmur'd one, \"let whoso make or buy, All in one Pickle we--like as we lie:   For let the right Good-Fellow come along, We all may lay the Ball dead by and by.\"   LXIII    SO one and one and one I heard them speak: \"Ah, Friends,\" said I, \"'tis not a Make we seek,   A Duffer arm'd with all the Clubs there be-- What is he to a Player with a Cleek?\"         *       *       *       *       *   LXIV    LATELY, agape beside the door of Fame, Sudden a Touch upon my shoulder came,   And thro' the Dusk an Angel Shape held out The greater Guerdon; and it was--the Game!   LXV    THE Game that can with Logic absolute The Dronings of the Soberheads confute,   Silence the scoffing ones, and in a trice Life's leaden metal into Gold transmute.   LXVI    INDEED, the brave Game I have loved so well Has little taught me how to buy or sell;   Has pawn'd my Greatness for an Hour of Ease, And barter'd cold Cash for--a Miracle.   LXVII    INDEED, indeed, Repentance oft before I swore--but it was Winter when I swore,   And then and then came Spring, and Club-in-hand I hasten'd forth for one Round--one Round more.   LXVIII    BUT much as Golf has play'd the Infidel, And robb'd me of my worldly Profit--Well,   I often wonder what the Grubbers earn One half so precious as the Joy they sell.   LXIX    WHAT! for a senseless Bank-Account to wreak Their manly Strength on Ledgers, till too weak   To swing a club?--So Caddies calmly tread In Mire the Ball Heav'n sent them here to seek.   LXX    WHAT! as a poor dull Drudge to waste the Force That might have made a Golfer, till the Source   Of Golf be dried--and Life grow all too brief To top a Ball around the Ladies' Course!   LXXI    YET, ah, that Golf should vanish with the green! What noble matches Winter might have seen;   And in Old Age what glorious Hazards foil'd, What Zest of painful Pleasures might have been!   LXXII    WOULD but the dim Face of old Winter yield One glimpse of green, like Youth to Age reveal'd,   Thro' which once more the failing Limbs might spring As springs the trampled Herbage of the Field.   LXXIII    AH! with the Green my fading life provide, Some ancient golfing Crony by my side:   Content to play one Round, or, meeker still, To mix a gentle Foursome satisfied.   LXXIV    THAT even the wavering Remnant of the Swing May bear some witness to my virtuous Spring,   And leave no True-believer passing-by Unedified by its Admonishing.   LXXV    WOULD but the god of Golfers ere too late Arrest the sure-advancing step of Fate,   What matter if we play the Odd or Like? Or--if we play--hole out in Four or Eight?   LXXVI    AH, let the Honor go to Fate, and let All difficulties by that Crack be met;   The Duffer still may win a Half or two, Content while Fate is only Dormie yet.   LXXVII    OR if ev'n this be taken, you and I May still fare onward calmly, honestly,   Nor care how many Down the Record stand: The Match is over--Let us play the Bye!   LXXVIII    YON rising Moon that leads us Home again, How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;   How oft hereafter rising wait for us At this same Turning--and for _One_ in vain.   LXXIX    AND when, like her, my Golfer, I have been And am no more above the pleasant Green,   And you in your mild Journey pass the Hole I made in One--ah! pay my Forfeit then!"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24022"],["title","A Christmas Carol (#0)"],["body","CHRISTMAS CAROL    [Illustration: _\"How now?\" said Scrooge, caustic and cold as ever.   \"What do you want with me?\"_]     A CHRISTMAS CAROL    [Illustration]    BY    CHARLES DICKENS    [Illustration]    ILLUSTRATED BY ARTHUR RACKHAM    [Illustration]    J.

There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.  Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for. You will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.  Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.  The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul's Churchyard, for instance--literally to astonish his son's weak mind.  Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.  Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.  External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down' handsomely, and Scrooge never did.  Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?' No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'  But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge.  Once upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold,"]]]
