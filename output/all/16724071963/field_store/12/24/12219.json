They're too primitive to understand that rain water and sea water are just different aspects of the same thing. But that wasn't the case with Tweel; it was just that we were somehow mysteriously different--our minds were alien to each other. And yet--we _liked_ each other!\"  \"Looney, that's all,\" remarked Harrison. \"That's why you two were so fond of each other.\"  \"Well, I like _you_!\" countered Jarvis wickedly. \"Anyway,\" he resumed, \"don't get the idea that there was anything screwy about Tweel. In fact, I'm not so sure but that he couldn't teach our highly praised human intelligence a trick or two. Oh, he wasn't an intellectual superman, I guess; but don't overlook the point that he managed to understand a little of my mental workings, and I never even got a glimmering of his.\"  \"Because he didn't have any!\" suggested the captain, while Putz and Leroy blinked attentively.  \"You can judge of that when I'm through,\" said Jarvis. \"Well, we plugged along across the Mare Chronium all that day, and all the next. Mare Chronium--Sea of Time! Say, I was willing to agree with Schiaparelli's name by the end of that march! Just that grey, endless plain of weird plants, and never a sign of any other life. It was so monotonous that I was even glad to see the desert of Xanthus toward the evening of the second day.  \"I was fair worn out, but Tweel seemed as fresh as ever, for all I never saw him drink or eat. I think he could have crossed the Mare Chronium in a couple of hours with those block-long nose dives of his, but he stuck along with me. I offered him some water once or twice; he took the cup from me and sucked the liquid into his beak, and then carefully squirted it all back into the cup and gravely returned it.  \"Just as we sighted Xanthus, or the cliffs that bounded it, one of those nasty sand clouds blew along, not as bad as the one we had here, but mean to travel against. I pulled the transparent flap of my thermo-skin bag across my face and managed pretty well, and I noticed that Tweel used some feathery appendages growing like a mustache at the base of his beak to cover his nostrils, and some similar fuzz to shield his eyes.\"  \"He is a desert creature!\" ejaculated the little biologist, Leroy.  \"Huh? Why?\"  \"He drink no water--he is adapt' for sand storm--\"  \"Proves nothing! There's not enough water to waste any where on this desiccated pill called Mars. We'd call all of it desert on earth, you know.\" He paused. \"Anyway, after the sand storm blew over, a little wind kept blowing in our faces, not strong enough to stir the sand. But suddenly things came drifting along from the Xanthus cliffs--small, transparent spheres, for all the world like glass tennis balls! But light--they were almost light enough to float even in this thin air--empty, too; at least, I cracked open a couple and nothing came out but a bad smell. I asked Tweel about them, but all he said was 'No, no, no,' which I took to mean that he knew nothing about them. So they went bouncing by like tumbleweeds, or like soap bubbles, and we plugged on toward Xanthus. Tweel pointed at one of the crystal balls once and said 'rock,' but I was too tired to argue with him. Later I discovered what he meant.  \"We came to the bottom of the Xanthus cliffs finally, when there wasn't much daylight left. I decided to sleep on the plateau if possible; anything dangerous, I reasoned, would be more likely to prowl through the vegetation of the Mare Chronium than the sand of Xanthus. Not that I'd seen a single sign of menace, except the rope-armed black thing that had trapped Tweel, and apparently that didn't prowl at all, but lured its victims within reach. It couldn't lure me while I slept, especially as Tweel didn't seem to sleep at all, but simply sat patiently around all night. I wondered how the creature had managed to trap Tweel, but there wasn't any way of asking him. I found that out too, later; it's devilish!  \"However, we were ambling around the base of the Xanthus barrier looking for an easy spot to climb. At least, I was. Tweel could have leaped it easily, for the cliffs were lower than Thyle--perhaps sixty feet. I found a place and started up, swearing at the water tank strapped to my back--it didn't bother me except when climbing--and suddenly I heard a sound that I thought I recognized!  \"You know how deceptive sounds are in this thin air. A shot sounds like the pop of a cork. But this sound was the drone of a rocket, and sure enough, there went our second auxiliary about ten miles to westward, between me and the sunset!\"  \"Vas me!\" said Putz. \"I hunt for you.\"  \"Yeah; I knew that, but what good did it do me? I hung on to the cliff and yelled and waved with one hand. Tweel saw it too, and set up a trilling and twittering, leaping to the top of the barrier and then high into the air. And while I watched, the machine droned on into the shadows to the south.  \"I scrambled to the top of the cliff. Tweel was still pointing and trilling excitedly, shooting up toward the sky and coming down head-on to stick upside down on his beak in the sand. I pointed toward the south and at myself, and he said, 'Yes--Yes--Yes'; but somehow I gathered that he thought the flying thing was a relative of mine, probably a parent. Perhaps I did his intellect an injustice; I think now that I did.  \"I was bitterly disappointed by the failure to attract attention. I pulled out my thermo-skin bag and crawled into it, as the night chill was already apparent. Tweel stuck his beak into the sand and drew up his legs and arms and looked for all the world like one of those leafless shrubs out there. I think he stayed that way all night.\"  \"Protective mimicry!\" ejaculated Leroy. \"See? He is desert creature!\"  \"In the morning,\" resumed Jarvis, \"we started off again. We hadn't gone a hundred yards into Xanthus when I saw something queer! This is one thing Putz didn't photograph, I'll wager!  \"There was a line of little pyramids--tiny ones, not more than six inches high, stretching across Xanthus as far as I could see! Little buildings made of pygmy bricks, they were, hollow inside and truncated, or at least broken at the top and empty. I pointed at them and said 'What?' to Tweel, but he gave some negative twitters to indicate, I suppose, that he didn't know. So off we went, following the row of pyramids because they ran north, and I was going north.  \"Man, we trailed that line for hours! After a while, I noticed another queer thing: they were getting larger. Same number of bricks in each one, but the bricks were larger.  \"By noon they were shoulder high. I looked into a couple--all just the same, broken at the top and empty. I examined a brick or two as well; they were silica, and old as creation itself!\"  \"How you know?\" asked Leroy.  \"They were weathered--edges rounded. Silica doesn't weather easily even on earth, and in this climate--!\"  \"How old you think?\"  \"Fifty thousand--a hundred thousand years. How can I tell? The little ones we saw in the morning were older--perhaps ten times as old. Crumbling. How old would that make _them_? Half a million years? Who knows?\" Jarvis paused a moment. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"we followed the line. Tweel pointed at them and said 'rock' once or twice, but he'd done that many times before. Besides, he was more or less right about these.  \"I tried questioning him. I pointed at a pyramid and asked 'People?' and indicated the two of us. He set up a negative sort of clucking and said, 'No, no, no. No one-one-two. No two-two-four,' meanwhile rubbing his stomach. I just stared at him and he went through the business again. 'No one-one-two. No two-two-four.' I just gaped at him.\"  \"That proves it!\" exclaimed Harrison. \"Nuts!\"  \"You think so?\" queried Jarvis sardonically. \"Well, I figured it out different! 'No one-one-two!' You don't get it, of course, do you?\"  \"Nope--nor do you!\"  \"I think I do! Tweel was using the few English words he knew to put over a very complex idea. What, let me ask, does mathematics make you think of?\"  \"Why--of astronomy. Or--or logic!\"  \"That's it! 'No one-one-two!' Tweel was telling me that the builders of the pyramids weren't people--or that they weren't intelligent, that they weren't reasoning creatures! Get it?\"  \"Huh! I'll be damned!\"  \"You probably will.\"  \"Why,\" put in Leroy, \"he rub his belly?\"  \"Why? Because, my dear biologist, that's where his brains are! Not in his tiny head--in his middle!\"  \"_C'est_ impossible!\"  \"Not on Mars, it isn't! This flora and fauna aren't earthly; your biopods prove that!\" Jarvis grinned and took up his narrative. \"Anyway, we plugged along across Xanthus and in about the middle of the afternoon, something else queer happened. The pyramids ended.\"  \"Ended!\"  \"Yeah; the queer part was that the last one--and now they were ten-footers--was capped! See? Whatever built it was still inside; we'd trailed 'em from their half-million-year-old origin to the present.  \"Tweel and I noticed it about the same time. I yanked out my automatic (I had a clip of Boland explosive bullets in it) and Tweel, quick as a sleight-of-hand trick, snapped a queer little glass revolver out of his bag. It was much like our weapons, except that the grip was larger to accommodate his four-taloned hand. And we held our weapons ready while we sneaked up along the lines of empty pyramids.  \"Tweel saw the movement first. The top tiers of bricks were heaving, shaking, and suddenly slid down the sides with a thin crash. And then--something--something was coming out!  \"A long, silvery-grey arm appeared, dragging after it an armored body. Armored, I mean, with scales, silver-grey and dull-shining. The arm heaved the body out of the hole; the beast crashed to the sand.  \"It was a nondescript creature--body like a big grey cask, arm and a sort of mouth-hole at one end; stiff, pointed tail at the other--and that's all. No other limbs, no eyes, ears, nose--nothing! The thing dragged"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23731"],["title","A Martian Odyssey (#3)"],["body","a few yards, inserted its pointed tail in the sand, pushed itself upright, and just sat.  \"Tweel and I watched it for ten minutes before it moved. Then, with a creaking and rustling like--oh, like crumpling stiff paper--its arm moved to the mouth-hole and out came a brick! The arm placed the brick carefully on the ground, and the thing was still again.  \"Another ten minutes--another brick. Just one of Nature's bricklayers. I was about to slip away and move on when Tweel pointed at the thing and said 'rock'! I went 'huh?' and he said it again. Then, to the accompaniment of some of his trilling, he said, 'No--no--,' and gave two or three whistling breaths.  \"Well, I got his meaning, for a wonder! I said, 'No breath?' and demonstrated the word. Tweel was ecstatic; he said, 'Yes, yes, yes! No, no, no breet!' Then he gave a leap and sailed out to land on his nose about one pace from the monster!  \"I was startled, you can imagine! The arm was going up for a brick, and I expected to see Tweel caught and mangled, but--nothing happened! Tweel pounded on the creature, and the arm took the brick and placed it neatly beside the first. Tweel rapped on its body again, and said 'rock,' and I got up nerve enough to take a look myself.  \"Tweel was right again. The creature was rock, and it didn't breathe!\"  \"How you know?\" snapped Leroy, his black eyes blazing interest.  \"Because I'm a chemist. The beast was made of silica! There must have been pure silicon in the sand, and it lived on that. Get it? We, and Tweel, and those plants out there, and even the biopods are _carbon_ life; this thing lived by a different set of chemical reactions. It was silicon life!\"  \"_La vie silicieuse!_\" shouted Leroy. \"I have suspect, and now it is proof! I must go see! _Il faut que je--_\"  \"All right! All right!\" said Jarvis. \"You can go see. Anyhow, there the thing was, alive and yet not alive, moving every ten minutes, and then only to remove a brick. Those bricks were its waste matter. See, Frenchy? We're carbon, and our waste is carbon dioxide, and this thing is silicon, and _its_ waste is silicon dioxide--silica. But silica is a solid, hence the bricks. And it builds itself in, and when it is covered, it moves over to a fresh place to start over. No wonder it creaked! A living creature half a million years old!\"  \"How you know how old?\" Leroy was frantic.  \"We trailed its pyramids from the beginning, didn't we? If this weren't the original pyramid builder, the series would have ended somewhere before we found him, wouldn't it?--ended and started over with the small ones. That's simple enough, isn't it?  \"But he reproduces, or tries to. Before the third brick came out, there was a little rustle and out popped a whole stream of those little crystal balls. They're his spores, or eggs, or seeds--call 'em what you want. They went bouncing by across Xanthus just as they'd bounced by us back in the Mare Chronium. I've a hunch how they work, too--this is for your information, Leroy. I think the crystal shell of silica is no more than a protective covering, like an eggshell, and that the active principle is the smell inside. It's some sort of gas that attacks silicon, and if the shell is broken near a supply of that element, some reaction starts that ultimately develops into a beast like that one.\"  \"You should try!\" exclaimed the little Frenchman. \"We must break one to see!\"  \"Yeah? Well, I did. I smashed a couple against the sand. Would you like to come back in about ten thousand years to see if I planted some pyramid monsters? You'd most likely be able to tell by that time!\" Jarvis paused and drew a deep breath. \"Lord! That queer creature! Do you picture it? Blind, deaf, nerveless, brainless--just a mechanism, and yet--immortal! Bound to go on making bricks, building pyramids, as long as silicon and oxygen exist, and even afterwards it'll just stop. It won't be dead. If the accidents of a million years bring it its food again, there it'll be, ready to run again, while brains and civilizations are part of the past. A queer beast--yet I met a stranger one!\"  \"If you did, it must have been in your dreams!\" growled Harrison.  \"You're right!\" said Jarvis soberly. \"In a way, you're right. The dream-beast! That's the best name for it--and it's the most fiendish, terrifying creation one could imagine! More dangerous than a lion, more insidious than a snake!\"  \"Tell me!\" begged Leroy. \"I must go see!\"  \"Not _this_ devil!\" He paused again. \"Well,\" he resumed, \"Tweel and I left the pyramid creature and plowed along through Xanthus. I was tired and a little disheartened by Putz's failure to pick me up, and Tweel's trilling got on my nerves, as did his flying nosedives. So I just strode along without a word, hour after hour across that monotonous desert.  \"Toward mid-afternoon we came in sight of a low dark line on the horizon. I knew what it was. It was a canal; I'd crossed it in the rocket and it meant that we were just one-third of the way across Xanthus. Pleasant thought, wasn't it? And still, I was keeping up to schedule.  \"We approached the canal slowly; I remembered that this one was bordered by a wide fringe of vegetation and that Mud-heap City was on it.  \"I was tired, as I said. I kept thinking of a good hot meal, and then from that I jumped to reflections of how nice and home-like even Borneo would seem after this crazy planet, and from that, to thoughts of little old New York, and then to thinking about a girl I know there--Fancy Long. Know her?\"  \"Vision entertainer,\" said Harrison. \"I've tuned her in. Nice blonde--dances and sings on the _Yerba Mate_ hour.\"  \"That's her,\" said Jarvis ungrammatically. \"I know her pretty well--just friends, get me?--though she came down to see us off in the _Ares_. Well, I was thinking about her, feeling pretty lonesome, and all the time we were approaching that line of rubbery plants.  \"And then--I said, 'What 'n Hell!' and stared. And there she was--Fancy Long, standing plain as day under one of those crack-brained trees, and smiling and waving just the way I remembered her when we left!\"  \"Now you're nuts, too!\" observed the captain.  \"Boy, I almost agreed with you! I stared and pinched myself and closed my eyes and then stared again--and every time, there was Fancy Long smiling and waving! Tweel saw something, too; he was trilling and clucking away, but I scarcely heard him. I was bounding toward her over the sand, too amazed even to ask myself questions.  \"I wasn't twenty feet from her when Tweel caught me with one of his flying leaps. He grabbed my arm, yelling, 'No--no--no!' in his squeaky voice. I tried to shake him off--he was as light as if he were built of bamboo--but he dug his claws in and yelled. And finally some sort of sanity returned to me and I stopped less than ten feet from her. There she stood, looking as solid as Putz's head!\"  \"Vot?\" said the engineer.  \"She smiled and waved, and waved and smiled, and I stood there dumb as Leroy, while Tweel squeaked and chattered. I _knew_ it couldn't be real, yet--there she was!  \"Finally I said, 'Fancy! Fancy Long!' She just kept on smiling and waving, but looking as real as if I hadn't left her thirty-seven million miles away.  \"Tweel had his glass pistol out, pointing it at her. I grabbed his arm, but he tried to push me away. He pointed at her and said, 'No breet! No breet!' and I understood that he meant that the Fancy Long thing wasn't alive. Man, my head was whirling!  \"Still, it gave me the jitters to see him pointing his weapon at her. I don't know why I stood there watching him take careful aim, but I did. Then he squeezed the handle of his weapon; there was a little puff of steam, and Fancy Long was gone! And in her place was one of those writhing, black, rope-armed horrors like the one I'd saved Tweel from!  \"The dream-beast! I stood there dizzy, watching it die while Tweel trilled and whistled. Finally he touched my arm, pointed at the twisting thing, and said, 'You one-one-two, he one-one-two.' After he'd repeated it eight or ten times, I got it. Do any of you?\"  \"_Oui!_\" shrilled Leroy. \"_Moi--je le comprends!_ He mean you think of something, the beast he know, and you see it! _Un chien_--a hungry dog, he would see the big bone with meat! Or smell it--not?\"  \"Right!\" said Jarvis. \"The dream-beast uses its victim's longings and desires to trap its prey. The bird at nesting season would see its mate, the fox, prowling for its own prey, would see a helpless rabbit!\"  \"How he do?\" queried Leroy.  \"How do I know? How does a snake back on earth charm a bird into its very jaws? And aren't there deep-sea fish that lure their victims into their mouths? Lord!\" Jarvis shuddered. \"Do you see how insidious the monster is? We're warned now--but henceforth we can't trust even our eyes. You might see me--I might see one of you--and back of it may be nothing but another of those black horrors!\"  \"How'd your friend know?\" asked the captain abruptly.  \"Tweel? I wonder! Perhaps he was thinking of something that couldn't possibly have interested me, and when I started to run, he realized that I saw something different and was warned. Or perhaps the dream-beast can only project a single vision, and Tweel saw what I saw--or nothing. I couldn't ask him. But it's just another proof that his intelligence is equal to ours or greater.\"  \"He's daffy, I tell you!\" said Harrison. \"What makes you think his intellect ranks with the human?\"  \"Plenty of things! First, the pyramid-beast. He hadn't seen one before; he said as much. Yet he recognized it as a dead-alive automaton of silicon.\"  \"He could have heard of it,\" objected Harrison. \"He lives around here, you know.\"  \"Well how about the language? I couldn't pick up a single idea of his and he learned six or seven words of mine. And do you realize what complex ideas he put over with no more than those six or seven words? The pyramid-monster--the dream-beast! In a single phrase he told me that one was a harmless"]]]
