You will be scaring the bullocks.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said the big fellow, replacing the whip by the great tilted waggon.  \"I'll teach you how to handle it when we get out on the veldt.  Like me to show you, perhaps, now?\"  \"No, no,\" said Sir James; \"not while we are here.\"  \"It's quite safe, sir,\" said the man good-humouredly.  \"I could give a flip to any one of the bullocks you like to point out without the thong coming near anybody.\"  \"Oh, let him, please, father.\"  \"Very well,\" said Sir James, rather grumpily.  \"Shall we stand farther off?\"  \"Oh, no, sir,\" replied the man.  \"Let's pick out that one with the white nose,\" whispered Dean.  \"I don't believe he can hit it;\" and he pointed to one fat beast that was standing almost alone blinking its eyes and ruminating over its cud.  \"Yes; hit that one,\" said Mark.  The man seemed to give the long whip an easy wave in the air, and the point of the lash alighted on the bullock's smooth neck, making the animal start and toss its head; and then in response to a command which sounded like _Barrk_, it slowly sidled close up to the nearest of its fellows, and then went on chewing the cud again.  \"Ay, ay, Jacob!\" shouted the driver, and he uttered a few words in a patois that was probably a composition of Dutch and Hottentot, which made the little yellow flat-nosed driver come shambling up, grinning, to take the big whip pitched to him and go off to a distance of some five-and-twenty yards, where, after uttering a few incomprehensible cries which had the effect of making such of the bullocks as were crouching in the sand rise slowly to their feet and sidle up together, the strange looking driver gave the whip a wave or two where he stood, and began to crack it, at every _whish_ producing what sounded like a series of rifle shots, watching the English driver the while until he was told to desist.  \"Bravo!\" cried Mark, and Dean clapped his hands.  \"I say, can you crack a whip like that?\" cried Dean.  \"Oh, yes, sir.  Teach you too, if you like.\"  \"Well, I do like,\" said the boy; \"but when uncle isn't here.\"  When the interiors of the two great tilted waggons that were close at hand had been examined with some curiosity, as they were to be storehouses and dwelling-places combined, the little party went off in another direction, Mark eagerly enquiring what was to be their destination now.  \"Oh, I was going to show you the little cobs the doctor has bought-- ponies, I suppose I ought to call them.\"  \"What, has he got them already?\" cried Mark.  \"Oh, yes; it has been very short work,\" said the doctor.  \"The officer who has charge of the little garrison here introduced me to a dealer, and I think we have been very fortunate to meet a gentleman who was well acquainted with the ways of the settlers here, for he has given me some very good hints, and in addition promised to have a guide found who was hanging about the camp and is now waiting here after being up the country with a hunting party who left for Beira about a fortnight ago. He is one of the Illakas, Sir James,\" continued the doctor, \"and it seems that he has been expelled from his tribe for being friendly to the English.\"  \"Quite a savage, then,\" said Sir James.  \"Oh, yes; I suppose he is a pure-blooded black, and knows the country well.  Let me see, we must turn down in this direction, I think.  Yes-- pass that corrugated iron shed-like house--to be sure, that's it--and there's the man the ponies belong to.\"  He nodded in the direction of a little keen-looking man who appeared rather mushroom-like, thanks to the well-worn, broad-leafed felt hat he wore.  He was leaning over a rough enclosure in which four ponies were browsing, and keenly watching the approaching party as he smoked.  As soon as he realised that they were coming in his direction he took his pipe from his mouth, tapped the ashes out upon a post, took off his hat and stuck the short pipe in the band.  \"Come to have a look at the ponies, gentlemen?\" he said.  \"Yes,\" said Sir James; \"I want my son and nephew to have a look at them and try them.\"  \"I see,\" said the man, scanning the boys attentively.  \"My man isn't here.  Like them saddled and bridled?\"  Sir James looked at the two boys, as the man continued, \"Can the young gentlemen ride?\"  He glanced at the doctor as he spoke.  \"Yes,\" said the latter quietly; \"after our fashion in England.  Well broken horses.  But they can't ride wild beasts.\"  \"Well, no, captain; nobody expects that; but I shall have to keep you waiting a bit while I have my man found, and send him to borrow a saddle and bridle.  I have only got two, and one of the officers from up at the barracks and his friend have got them for the day.  I have plenty of halters, and I can clap a rug on one of the ponies.  What do you say to that, young gentlemen?\"  \"I'd rather have one without the rug,\" said Mark, \"if they are quiet.\"  \"Quiet as lambs, sir, as long as you don't play any larks with them.\"  \"Oh, we shan't play any tricks,\" said Mark.  \"That's right, sir.  Out here we like to treat a pony well.  They are scarce, and worth their money.  I am afraid, sir,\" continued the man, turning to the doctor, \"that I did not charge enough for them.\"  \"But you don't want to draw back from your bargain?\" said the doctor sternly.  \"I paid you the price you asked.\"  \"Yes, sir.  The captain up yonder brought you to me as English friends, and him and his officers are good customers to me.  No, I am not going to ask more.  Only I will go as far as this: if you bring them back to me sound and in a fair condition I will take them again at the price. Here, one of you,\" he shouted to a group of idlers who had sauntered up to the fence of the enclosure, \"go to the house and ask the missis to give you a couple of halters and a horse rug.  My chap, Browne, has gone to meet the officers.\"  One of the men sauntered off quietly, leaving the party of strangers to walk across the kraal, the boys keenly examining the little browsing animals.  \"Well, doctor,\" said Sir James, \"I must say I admire your choice.  They are beautiful little creatures, and I hope that they have no vice.\"  \"Vice!  Not they, sir,\" said their late owner, as the ponies upon being approached lifted their heads to stare at the visitors for a few moments and then go on browsing at the low-growing bushes that formed their feed.  \"This don't look like vice, does it, sir?\" said the man, thrusting his hand into his pocket and drawing it out full of maize.  One of the ponies raised its head, stretched out its neck in the direction of the extended hand, and trotted up.  \"These mealies are rather a hard bite for them, sir, but this lot are very fond of a taste, and I let them have one now and then; but of course you will always have a few sacks handy.--Now, young gentlemen, try this one,\" and he poured some of the golden grain into Mark's hand. \"You too, sir,\" he continued, and he brought out some more to trickle into Dean's.  There was no doubt so far in the tameness of the two ponies, which fed quietly enough from the boys' hands and submitted to being handled, patted and held by their thick forelocks or manes.  By this time the dealer's messenger had returned with a couple of halters.  \"Missis can't find a horse rug,\" said the man surlily.  \"Never mind; we can do without, I daresay.  But just be on the lookout, and if you see my Browne send him to me.  Now then, gentlemen, like to try barebacked?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mark; and as soon as a halter had been thrown over one of the ponies' heads the dealer handed the end to him.  \"Oh, come,\" he said, \"not the first time you have been on a pony;\" for Mark held up one leg, which the man took in his hand and gave him a hoist; and the boy making a spring at the same time dropped on the pony's glossy back, but like vaulting ambition overleaped himself and rolled over on the other side, startling the pony into making off.  But the dealer made a snatch at the halter, just in time, and it stopped short, snorting.  \"Hurt, my boy?\" cried Sir James, anxiously.  \"No, father; only vexed,\" said the boy, dusting the sand from his flannels.  \"Now then,\" he continued, to the dealer, \"you hoisted me too hard.\"  \"Going to have another try?\"  \"Why, of course,\" cried the boy angrily.  \"Think I was frightened by a thing like that?\"  \"You'll do; you'll do,\" said the dealer, with a little chuckle.  \"Now then; it was half my fault, and half yours.\"  The next moment Mark was in his seat, holding his mount with a tight hand as it began to paw up the sand, eager to start.  \"Wait for me,\" cried Dean, for the dealer was clapping the halter on another of the ponies, whose back Dean reached without mishap; and then as if thoroughly accustomed to run together, the attractive looking little pair moved off at an easy canter, closely followed by the other two, and going soon after at a quiet hand gallop twice round the large kraal, and stopping short close up to the dealer at the end of their career.  The boys jumped down, and the two unmounted ponies waited patiently while the halters were shifted and the performance repeated.  \"Well, gentlemen, are you satisfied?\" said the man, patting the ponies' necks as he spoke.  \"Yes, quite,\" said Sir James.  \"What do you say, doctor?\"  \"I should say more than satisfied, only I am afraid that they won't be up to our weight.\"  \"Don't you make any mistake, sir.  These little fellows can do more than you expect--that is, if you treat them well.  You won't ride them till they founder, I'll be bound.  Just you take care that they have enough, and you will find that they will do all you want.  You would like me to keep them till you start, I suppose?\"  \"Certainly,\" said the doctor; and soon after the little party returned to their inn, the boys talking eagerly about their new acquaintance.  \"But I say, father,\" said Mark, \"why, what a party we are going to be-- five men, our four selves, four ponies, and all those oxen.  Let's see; that's all, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],["title","Dead Man's Land (#7)"],["body","isn't it?\"  \"No,\" said Sir.  James; \"you forget the guide.\"  \"Black, isn't he, uncle?\"  \"Yes; I suppose he's a regular Kaffir, a sort of Zulu.  What did the captain say he was, doctor?\"  \"An Illaka, he called him, I believe, something of the same sort of black, as the Matabeles.  But you have forgotten two more.\"  \"Two more, sir?\" said Dean.  \"No, we have counted them all.\"  \"What about the two black forelopers?\"  \"Why, what are they?\" cried Mark.  \"The two blacks who go in front of the foremost bullocks.\"  \"Oh,\" said Mark.  \"I say, we are beginning to grow.\"  \"Yes,\" said Sir James; \"we are getting to be a pretty good hunting party.  What with ourselves, men and cattle, we shall have a good many mouths to feed.\"  \"But you don't want to go back, father?\"  \"I did, thoroughly,\" replied Sir James, \"when we were down at that dreadful port.\"  \"But not now, uncle,\" cried Dean.  \"Certainly not, my boy.  I am as eager to go forward as you boys, and I believe the doctor too.  I think we are going to have a most delightful trip.  But I say, this doesn't look to me a very good specimen of the health of the country;\" and he nodded his head in the direction of a very tall, extremely thin, bilious-looking individual who passed them, and whom they saw make his way right up to the dealer's house.  \"Talk about moustachios,\" cried Mark.  \"Why, they look like those of a china figure in a tea-shop.  I wonder what he calls himself.\"  \"And this one too,\" said Dean, for they met a fine-looking, well built black with well-cut features, nose almost aquiline, and a haughty look of disdain in his frowning eyes, as, spear over shoulder, he stalked by the English party, not even deigning to turn to glance back.  \"I should think he's a chief,\" said Mark; \"a sort of king in his way.\"  \"Doesn't cost him much a year for his clothes,\" said Dean, laughing, for the big fellow's costume was the simplest of the simple.  \"Ah, not much,\" said Sir James, looking after the man; \"one of Nature's noblemen, who looks as if he had never done a stroke of work in his life.  I wonder whether he would ever dare to make use of that spear.\"  \"I don't think there's any doubt about it, sir,\" said the doctor, \"if he were offended; and if we meet men like that we shall have to be friends, for that's an ugly looking weapon that he carries over his shoulder with such a jaunty air.\"  \"What are you thinking about, doctor?\"  \"I was thinking about the full-blooded black that the captain yonder promised to get us for our guide, and I was wondering whether that was likely to be he.\"  The doctor's words made the rest turn to gaze after the fine-looking, lithe and active black, who stalked on, haughty of mien, without even seeming to give a thought to the English intruders upon his soil.    CHAPTER SEVEN.  `MAK' IS SENT IN.  The barracks of Illakaree did not form an attractive object in the lovely landscape surrounded by hills, in and out amongst which the Reptile River ran, for a building hastily raised of corrugated iron never was and never will be beautiful.  \"I say ugly,\" said Mark to his cousin, \"but all the same I should like to be inside one when there was a bad hailstorm.  My word, what a shindy there would be with the big stones--lumps of ice, I suppose, they would be in a place like this--hammering down upon the zinc roof.\"  \"The soldiers look cheery enough.\"  \"And healthy,\" said the doctor.  \"Thoroughly,\" said Sir James.  \"It is a pity they cannot make arrangements down at the port to give their men a holiday up here.\"  They were close up to the captain's quarters, and he, catching sight of the party, came out hastily to shake hands.  \"Well,\" he said, in a light cheery way, \"what can I do for you?  How are you getting on?\"  \"Excellently,\" said the doctor, \"thanks to you.  We have secured the ponies, two waggons, and two span of oxen with their drivers.\"  \"That's right.  Have you got your forelopers too.\"  \"Not yet, but I suppose there will be no difficulty about them.\"  \"Not the slightest.  We generally have one or two black fellows eager to get a job with someone going up country.  I will undertake to find them. The oxen are all right, for I have seen them.  You couldn't have had a better lot, and you are quite right too over the ponies.  Now, is there anything else I can do?\"  Before the doctor could speak, the frank, good looking young captain turned to the boys.  \"Nice lucky pair of young dogs you are--going on a natural history and hunting trip like this!  What wouldn't I give to come with you!\"  \"Well, come, then,\" said Sir James.  \"I should be delighted to strengthen our party with such a companion.  You know a good deal about the country, don't you?\"  \"Well--yes.  I have had two or three little excursions in the direction you are going through the great forests and away on to where the old stones are said to be, Dr Robertson,\" continued the speaker, turning to that visitor.  \"But I understood you to say that you had never seen them.\"  \"No; I had to turn back, for my leave had nearly expired, and I came away with the belief that there were no ruins, and that those who had reported about them had seen nothing but some of the castle-like kopjes that look sometimes at a distance like built fortresses of huge granite stones.  Still I have heard on the other hand that there are such ruins, and that after their fashion the black tribes keep it a secret and look upon the spot as a sort of Mecca--a sacred place which it is dangerous to approach and which they will not allow the white man to come near for fear he should be hurt, and from fear on their own part of the old bogeys which haunt the ruins.  I don't answer for this.  It may be all talk, and if I had time there is nothing I should like to do better than to prove it.\"  \"Then you think there is risk in going there.\"  \"No,\" said the captain, \"I really do not.  If there were I don't think that the guide would be so ready to undertake his task.\"  \"But the ruins may exist,\" said the doctor; and the boys listened with their ears wide open or well on the gape for news.  \"Certainly; there is plenty of room,\" said the captain, laughing; \"and the black fellow I told you about, as far as I can make out from his jumble of the Ulaka language and broken English, declares that he has seen them--big stone kraals, he calls them.\"  \"Well, why can't you come with us to see?\" said the doctor.  \"It is bound to be very interesting.\"  \"Awfully,\" said the captain, \"and there must be plenty of good sport out there.  I'll vouch for that.\"  \"What shall we get?\" asked Mark eagerly.  \"Lions,\" said the captain, smiling--\"plenty of them.  Do you like lion shooting?\"  \"How can I?\" said Mark testily.  \"How could I?  I never shot anything bigger than a pheasant in my life.  You are laughing at me.\"  \"Oh, no,\" said the captain, patting him on the shoulder; \"and I daresay next time we meet you will have bagged one or more, and have the skins to show me.  Then you will get leopards, which by all means shoot, for they are very mischievous.  You will find plenty of hippos in the river, and crocs too.  That's why they call it Reptile River; and if you go on far enough, as you ought to if you have plenty of time, you may get a shot or two at giraffes.  Ah, and as I say if you go on far enough you may run against okapis.\"  \"O--what, sir?\" cried the boys eagerly.  \"Oh, a curious new animal that they are reporting.  They say it looks half way between a giraffe and a zebra, and it's found in the great central forests.  Ah, boys, you have got a fine time before you, and as I said before, I envy you both.\"  \"Then why not think better of Sir James's invitation?\" said the doctor. \"I am sure you would be able to assist us wonderfully.  Say you will come.\"  \"Can't,\" said the captain firmly.  \"Duty.  The people about here are very peaceable now, but they may break out at any time; and suppose there was an _emeute_ amongst these blacks while I was away shooting.  I thank you, Sir James, most heartily, but it is impossible.  You will have a capital guide, though, who will show you the way far better than I could.\"  \"Yes, the guide,\" said Mark hastily.  \"That's why we have come up this morning.\"  \"Well, you couldn't have come at a better time,\" said the officer.  \"He has been far away, for some reason best known to himself, but he marched into camp last evening, looking as if he were monarch of all he surveyed.\"  \"Then that's the man we saw!\" cried Dean excitedly.  \"Tall, black, fine-looking fellow, well built, and a savage chief every inch of him?\"  \"Yes,\" said Mark eagerly; \"and hardly any clothes.\"  \"That's the man.  There, I will send one of my men to fetch him here;\" and stepping to the window he called to the sentry on duty to pass the word for someone to hunt out Mak and bring him there.  \"Mak!\" said the doctor, laughing.  \"What, have you got Scotch blacks here?\"  \"Oh, no.  We call him Mak because he is like one of the Makalaka. Properly he belongs to a great tribe called the Ulakas, who used at one time to occupy the kopjes about here.  I suppose that is why this place has come to be known as Illakaree.\"  Only a few minutes later the tall, stately-looking black of the preceding evening was seen crossing the barrack enclosure, carrying his spear over his shoulder and looking down with a sort of contempt at the young bugler by his side, to which the boy retorted by looking up as contemptuously at the stalwart black, thinking of him as a naked nigger.  \"Now I don't wish to interfere,\" said the captain.  \"I only want to be of service to you gentlemen out in this wild place, if I can.  It is no presumption to say, I suppose, that you can't understand the Illaka dialect?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said the doctor.  \"I daresay I could get on if the man addressed me in ancient Greek.\"  \"Which he will not do,\" said the captain, laughing.  \"He will say very little, and what he does say will consist of the most curious jumble of English that ever man gave utterance to."]]]
