They decide to leave dear old England for a while, and pay a visit to Africa.  Here all sorts of adventures befall them, some pleasurable, but many of them not so.  There is one particularly awkward moment when one of the boys is pounced on by a lion.  However, they get out of that one.  As always with Fenn's books, there are numerous tight situations, many of which appear to have no solution, but they do get out of them, perhaps with the loss of one of their bullocks.  But by the end of the tale they are only too happy to get back to England and home.  ________________________________________________________________________ DEAD MAN'S LAND, BY GEORGE MANVILLE FENN.    CHAPTER ONE.  JUST BEFORE DINNER.  Mark jumped up.  \"You there, father!  I did not hear you come in.\"  Doctor Robertson, tutor, half rose from his seat by the glowing library fire.  \"No, my boy, and I did not hear you come in.\"  \"Why, uncle, you have been sitting there listening!\" cried Dean.  \"To be sure I have.  How could I help it, sir?  I came in tired, and thought I would have a nap in my own chair till it was time to change for dinner, and you woke me up out of a pleasant dream which somehow shaped itself into climbing with an ice axe and nearly losing it.  It was some time before I could make out whether I was really awake or dreaming still, and I lay listening and getting more and more interested in what the doctor described to you two stupid boys.\"  \"Oh, father, you shouldn't have listened!\" said Mark.  \"What, sir!\" cried Sir James Roche hotly.  \"And pray why shouldn't I have listened?\"  \"Because--because--\"  \"Because--because!  Well, go on, sir.\"  \"Well, Dr Robertson said something to us boys one day about what he called eavesdropping.\"  \"Tut, tut, sir!\" cried the boy's father irascibly.  \"You dare to tell me I was eavesdropping, when you three come in from your walk, and plump yourselves down at the end of the room and go on talking till you wake me up?  How could I help being interested and sitting back listening to the doctor's travels?  Don't I pay him to teach you boys a lot of his knowledge, and if by accident I hear some of what he says, haven't I a right to it?\"  \"And you have heard all I have said, sir?\" said the doctor, speaking as if he were moved.  \"Yes, my dear sir, everything when once I was well awake, and very fine it was.  Why, Mark--Dean--didn't I suggest that I should like to hear some more?\"  \"Yes, uncle, you did,\" said Dean; \"but--\"  \"What, sir?  Are you siding with Mark, and going to accuse your uncle of being an eavesdropper?\"  \"No, uncle, but--\"  \"Hang your buts, you impudent young dog!  But--but--\"  \"You said hang buts, uncle.\"  \"Bah!  Pooh!  Well, really, doctor, I suppose I ought to have spoken when I woke up, and put you all on your guard in case you might have-- Here, what does the old proverb say?  `Listeners never hear any good of themselves.'  Of course you might have said--you, Mark, boy, I mean-- said that I was a stingy old fellow and didn't allow you enough pocket money.\"  \"Well, I don't think you do, father,\" cried Mark; \"but I shouldn't have said so.\"  \"Good boy!  But I do allow you, sir, twice as much as my father used to allow me when I was your age.  And then Dean might have followed it up by talking about my temper.\"  \"I shouldn't, uncle.\"  \"Ah, I don't know, sir.  I am what Mrs Blinks calls a bit trying when my gout's bad.  And then I might have heard the doctor say--oh, no, he would say nothing but what would come from a gentleman.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said the doctor, as he stood erect now, and his words were followed by a low sigh as if of satisfaction.  \"Yes, I ought to have spoken, boys,\" continued the baronet, \"but you mustn't set it down as being dishonourable.  Why, you ought to have heard me chuckling softly as I lay back there in the darkness, listening.  Why, Robertson, this isn't flattery; you have a most astounding memory, and I must compliment you upon the way in which you retain things and then give them out again so that they seem to be life-like and real.  And so you have always had a great desire to be a traveller?\"  \"Always, sir,\" said the doctor gravely.  \"Hah!  And fate has so arranged it that you were to be a student instead, and doomed you to pass your existence drumming learning into the brains of a couple of the stupidest, wooden-headed boys I know.\"  \"Oh, I say, dad, only one!  I am sharp enough; you said so yourself; and poor old Dozey can't help being such a sleepy-headed fellow.\"  \"Eh?  What's that?\" cried Sir James.  \"You will show him whether you are sleepy-headed when you get up into your room!\"  \"Then he shouldn't say such things, uncle.\"  \"Ha, ha!\" laughed Sir James.  \"But really, my dear Robertson, you have taken me quite by surprise.  You would like to travel?\"  \"I must confess I should, Sir James; but pray don't give me the credit of being discontented with my lot.  The three years that I have passed at the manor, gladdened as they have been by your consideration and perfect trust, have been happy ones to me.\"  \"Oh, tut, nonsense, my dear sir!  When you came here I laid down the law to myself that for the first month I would lie low, as the Yankees call it, and see what sort of a fellow you were; and at the end of that time I was perfectly satisfied with my good fortune in obtaining your services.  I said to myself, `The doctor's a high-class University man, and he can turn those two boys into English gentlemen--manly gentlemen-- far better than I can.  He will have a terribly hard job to lick the young cubs and shape them properly, so don't interfere.'  And I haven't, have I, doctor?  No--no, don't say anything.  I know what it would be, so hold your tongue.  I will say, though, here in the darkness so as to spare the boys, doctor, that I think it's a pity that besides the metaphorical licking that the old bears are said to use to shape their cubs, I did not begin by giving you the power to give them now and then what schoolboys call `the real' licking.\"  \"You don't, father,\" said Mark, laughing merrily.  \"You have always said that boys can be well brought up without blows.\"  \"Hear, hear,\" said the doctor softly.  \"But I am afraid it was very weak of me,\" said Sir James.  \"A good thrashing, sir, now and then, would have made you less impudent.\"  \"You mean Dean, father,\" said the boy mischievously.  \"No, I do not, sir.\"  \"Hear, hear!  Hooray!\" shouted Dean.  \"But I believe,\" continued Sir James, \"that it would have woke him up a bit, for he's nearly as bad as the Fat Boy in Pickwick.\"  \"Oh, what a shame!\" cried the boy.  \"And one word more,\" continued Sir James, speaking earnestly now.  \"Do you know, Robertson, this is very odd?\"  \"What is, sir?\" said the doctor, for Sir James had ceased speaking.  \"Why, that several times lately I have sat there in that chair thinking about these two fellows and their education, and that though I don't believe in what people call the Grand Tour, it would be a fine thing for them if they were to travel and see a bit of the world.  I mean real travelling, into out-of-the-way places where they could shoot, and hunt, and fish, and collect.  I don't mean to go murdering about, seeing how many poor animals they could slaughter, and calling it sport, but to go out into the wilds getting their livings by their guns or rifles, and learning at the same time the wonders of animated nature, and seeing generally what there is to be found in life.  Of course I know that you could impart all this to the boys by means of books of travel, but how would it be if you were to pick out some interesting country and teach them by genuine travel?  Much better than nailing you down to a table with a pile of books.  Why, doctor--boys--Bah!  Bless my heart!  There's the dinner-bell!  No dressing to-day.  Come along.  We must talk more of this another time.\"    CHAPTER TWO.  HOW MARK ROCHE GAINED THE DAY.  The idea of travelling was not allowed to cool.  A few days passed, during which the project was discussed, and one morning during breakfast the baronet broke out with, \"I don't want to get rid of you boys, but I lie awake of a night now, thinking of you going on such an expedition with the doctor, then growl and grumble at myself with envy.\"  \"Then you really mean us to go, father?\"  \"Mean it, yes.  But it comes hard that you two should have father and uncle who is ready to lay down the money--the bank notes to pay for it all, and here am I going to be left at home longing for letters that can only possibly come at very long intervals.\"  \"Oh, father, but we shall write regularly,\" cried Mark.  \"Of course!\" said Sir James sarcastically.  \"Sit down at the end of a day's tramp, when you are tired out, at a comfortable library table, with a light of a shaded lamp, and write me a good long letter? Rubbish, sir!  You will neither of you be in the humour for writing right away there in some forest.\"  \"Oh, of course, uncle,\" cried Dean, \"we shan't have a chance to sit down at a table to write, but we shall take each of us a writing case.\"  \"Humph!  Will you?  I doubt it, boy; and even if you did you wouldn't be able to get at it when you were in the humour to write; and then if you did scrawl something with a pencil on a scrap of paper, where would you post your letter?  In some hollow tree, or tuck it in a bladder and send it floating down a river with a direction scratched on a tin label? Bah!  The doctor will take you right away into some wilds, and I shall get no letter for months, and months, and months.\"  \"Oh, father,\" said Mark sadly, \"I never thought of that!  It would be hard, dad; and it seems selfish.  It's all over.  I shan't go.\"  \"Oh!\" said Sir James, trying to frown very severely, and forcing a very peculiar husky cough.  \"Dear,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23922"],["title","Dead Man's Land (#1)"],["body","ear, how tiresome!\" he cried.  \"Haven't got a lozenge in your pocket, have you, Dean?\"  \"No, uncle.  Shall I get you a glass of water?\"  \"No, sir,\" almost shouted his uncle.  \"You know I hate cold water. Dear, dear!  Barking like this, just as if something has gone the wrong way!\"  And the baronet pulled out a big silk handkerchief and began blowing his nose violently.  \"Ah, that's better now.  Can't be cold coming on.  Ah, much better now.\"  Then next moment he had clapped his hand smartly down on Mark's shoulder, and the doctor noticed that he kept it there, while there was an artificial ring in his voice as he continued, \"Oh, you won't go, sir, won't you?\"  \"No, father,\" cried the boy firmly, and he gave his prisoned shoulder a hitch as if to free himself from the pressure, which immediately grew tighter.  \"Oh, that's it, is it, sir?  Now that I have made up my mind to it and am going to start you all off with a first class equipment, you tell me you are going to play the disobedient young dog, and plump out in a most insolent way--you heard him doctor?--that you won't go!\"  \"Oh, I must say on his behalf, Sir James,\" cried the doctor, \"that he did not strike me as being insolent.\"  \"Then you could not have been listening, sir, attentively,\" retorted Sir James.  \"I look upon it as disobedient and undutiful and--and cowardly.\"  \"Oh, father! cowardly!\" cried Mark, making another unsuccessful attempt to set his shoulder free.  \"How could it be cowardly?\"  \"Why, sir, if there's any selfishness in it you want to shuffle it off your shoulders on to mine.\"  \"Oh, no, father; don't say that.\"  \"But I have said it, sir,\" cried Sir James.  \"But he doesn't mean it, Mark,\" cried Dean.  \"What, sir!  What!  What!  What's that, sir?  How dare you!\" thundered Sir James.  \"Are you going to be insolent and disobedient too?\"  \"Excuse me, Sir James,\" said the doctor.  \"Let me say a few words.\"  \"No, sir,\" cried Sir James fiercely, \"not one word!  This is my affair. I never interfere with you over your teaching of my boys.\"  \"I beg your pardon, Sir James.\"  \"No, don't,\" cried the baronet.  \"I beg yours.  I am very much put out, doctor--very angry--very angry indeed.  I always am when I am opposed in anything which I consider to be right.  I oughtn't to have spoken to you as I did, so pray leave this to me or I may forget myself and say words to you, my good old friend, for which I shall be sorry afterwards.\"  The doctor bowed his head.  \"I say, uncle,\" cried Dean.  \"Well, sir, and pray what do you say?\" snapped out Sir James.  \"I was only going to say don't be cross with us, uncle.\"  \"I am not cross, sir--cross, indeed!--only angry and hurt at this opposition.  Well, sir, what were you going to say?\"  \"Only, nunkey--\"  \"Nunkey, sir!  Bah!\"  That bah! was a regular bark.  \"You know how I hate that silly, childish word.\"  \"That you don't,\" thought the boy.  \"You know you always like it when you are not out of temper.\"  \"Well, there, sir; go on.\"  \"I was going to say, uncle, that I know how it can all be managed.\"  \"Yes, sir, of course!  Like all stupid people you want to put your spoke in the wheel and stir everything up and make the mess worse than it was before.--I say, doctor,\"--and there was a peculiar twinkle in Sir James's eye--\"that's what you would call a mixed metaphor, isn't it?\"  \"Well, Sir James,\" said the doctor, smiling, \"it does sound something like it.\"  \"Sound!\" said Sir James, who was cooling fast.  \"It would look very much like it in print.  Now, Dean, fire away.  How were you going to put it right?\"  \"You come too, uncle.\"  \"Come too!\" cried the boy's uncle, growing fierce again.  \"How can I come too, sir?  Why, sir, I should want a Sam Weller, like poor old Pickwick at Dingley Dell, when he could not go to the partridge shooting.  Do you think I want to go in a wheelbarrow with someone to push me, in a country where there are no roads?  Bah!  Pish!  Tush! Rrrrr-r-r-rubbish!  Here, doctor, did you ever hear such a piece of lunacy in your life?\"  \"Well, I don't know, Sir James.  Lunacy?\"  \"Yes, sir; lunacy.  Now, look here, doctor, don't you begin apologising for these boys and taking their part, because if you do, sir, we are no longer friends.\"  \"Well, Sir James, it has always been an understood thing between us that I was to be quite independent and have liberty to express my opinion in matters connected with you and your boys.\"  \"There, I knew it!  You are going over to their side!\" raged out Sir James.  \"And I know how it will be: I shall be so upset that I shall have a fearful fit of the gout after this, and be obliged to have in that doctor with his wretched mixtures for the next fortnight.  Well, sir, I must listen to you, I suppose.\"  \"Yes, Sir James, I think you had better,\" said the doctor, smiling; and he glanced at Mark.  \"Well, go on, then,\" cried Sir James.  \"Oh, I say, father, don't,\" cried Mark sharply.  \"Don't what, sir?\" pretty well roared his father.  \"I don't mind a nip or two, but you did give it to me then.  It was like a vice.\"  \"Pooh, boy, pooh!  You are not a baby, are you?\"  \"No, father, but--\" began Mark, wriggling his shoulder.  \"Hold your tongue, sir, and don't interrupt the doctor.  Now, doctor, what were you going to say?\"  \"I was going to say, Sir James, that I fully believe that a fit of the gout must be very painful--\"  \"Oh, you think so, do you?\"  \"Yes, Sir James, and I think also that you are not troubled with many. Of course we are not going to imitate Mr Pickwick, and a wheelbarrow is quite out of the question.\"  \"Now, look here, sir,\" cried Sir James angrily--but somehow there was a want of reality in his tones--\"don't you begin to suggest impossibilities.  I think I know what you are aiming at.\"  \"I should not be surprised, sir, if you do.  Now, of course if we went on this expedition, or expeditions, we should be going through forests often nearly impassable; but I think I have read--\"  \"Oh, yes, I know,\" said Sir James shortly, and the boys watched the doctor with eager eyes, and as they caught his he gave to each a keen encouraging look; \"you have read everything--a deal too much, I think,\" he grumbled, almost inaudibly.  \"--that,\" continued the doctor, making believe that he had not heard the baronet's tetchy words, \"great use is made of the blacks in Africa and India, who are quite accustomed to using a litter for the sportsmen in hunting expeditions, for the benefit of their employers.\"  Sir James set his son's shoulder free by giving him a fierce thrust, and his own hand too, so as to bring down his doubled fist upon the library table.  \"Look here, sir,\" he roared, \"do you for a moment think that I would consent to be carried stretched out on a couple of poles raised shoulder high by a pack of niggers?  Because if you do--\"  \"And sometimes,\" continued the doctor calmly, \"the sure-footed ponies of a country are very much used by travellers and hunting parties, for it is necessary that the sportsman or naturalist should not be over fatigued and should keep his nerves steady, as at times his life or that of his companions may rest upon the ability to be true in his aim at some dangerous beast about to charge and strike him down.\"  \"Humph!  Yes.  That's quite true, boys.  A man can't shoot straight when he's pumped out with too much exertion.  I have missed horribly sometimes after a long day's tramp seeing nothing worth shooting at; and then just at the end the birds have risen, or a hare has started up and given me an easy chance, and then got away.  There, go on, doctor, and don't let me check you with my chatter.\"  \"Oh, I have not much more to say, sir,\" was the reply.  \"Not much more to say!\" cried Sir James, in a disappointed tone. \"There, go on, sir; go on.  The boys are very anxious to hear you-- there, I won't be a sham--so am I too.\"  \"Well, to be brief, sir--\" began the doctor.  \"But I don't want you to be brief,\" cried Sir James, thumping the table again, but this time more softly, and no coffee sprang out into the saucers.  \"Oh, do go on; do go on!\" said Mark's lips inaudibly, and Dean sat swinging himself softly to and fro as he rubbed his hands over his knees.  \"Well, Sir James,\" continued the doctor, \"I must say that it seems to me perfectly feasible for you to make up your mind to be one of the party.\"  \"An old man like me, sir?\" cried Sir James.  \"I beg your pardon, sir; you are not an old man.  I believe I number as many years as you, and saving for a slight indisposition now and then you certainly enjoy robust health.\"  \"Oh, no, no, no, no!\" cried Sir James.  \"That's adulation, sir, and I won't have it.\"  \"'Tisn't father; is it, Dean?\"  \"Not a bit of it,\" was the reply.  \"The doctor never flatters.\"  \"Will you boys be quiet?\" shouted Sir James, and Mark clapped his hand over his cousin's lips, receiving a similar compliment from Dean in return, while Sir James threw himself back in his chair, frowned severely as he stared straight out of the wide open window, and then twitched himself about, changing his position again and again as if his seat were not comfortable.  A strange silence had fallen on the group, and it was as if three of the four individuals present were suffering from a desire to turn a questioning look upon their companions, but dared not for fear of interrupting Sir James in the deep thoughts which were evidently playing about in his brain and filling his frank, florid, John-Bull-like countenance with wrinkles.  During the space of perhaps two minutes the silence deepened, till all at once from somewhere in the stableyard there was a loud, whack, whack, whack, whack as of wings beating together, and then sharp and clear, defiant and victorious, as if a battle had been won--_Cock-a-doodle-do_!  \"Hah!\" ejaculated Sir James, starting upright in his chair, as if awakened out of a dream, and turning towards the doctor as if to speak, but only to check himself again.  \"Oh, absurd!\" he quite shouted.  \"No, no, no, no; impossible;"]]]
