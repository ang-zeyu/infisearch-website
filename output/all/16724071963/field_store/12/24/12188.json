[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23666"],["title","Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 3 (#3)"],["body"," the accompanying illustration will be found quite appropriate for the hall or reception room that is furnished in mission style. It can be made of any of the furniture woods, but quarter-sawed oak gives the best results. The stock necessary to make this stand can be secured from the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded, and is given in the following list:    4 posts, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 28 in., S-4-S.   4 top rails, 7/8 by 2 by 10 in., S-2-S.   4 lower rails, 7/8 by 3 by 10 in., S-2-S.   4 slats, 3/8 by 3 by 20 in., S-2-S.   1 bottom, 7/8 by 10 by 10 in.  First square up the posts and bevel the tops as shown in the detail sketch. Place them side by side, on a flat surface with the ends square and lay out the mortises with a try-square on all four pieces at the same time. This will insure your getting them all straight and of the same height. Now lay out the tenons on the rails in the same manner and cut them to fit the mortises in the posts. Mortises should also be cut in the rails for the ends of the side slats as shown. Try all the joints and see that they fit tight and square. Glue two sides of the stand together and let them dry for at least 24 hours, then glue the remaining parts, being careful to get everything together perfectly square.  The bottom board can now be fitted in place. It should have a hole cut in it for the drip pan. The pan should be about 6 or 7 in. in diameter. One suitable for the purpose can be purchased in any hardware store. The bottom board can be fastened to the rails with nails driven from the under side, or cleats can be nailed to the rails for it to rest upon.  [Illustration]  When the stand is complete, scrape all glue from about the joints and go over the whole with fine sandpaper, removing all rough spots. Apply the finish you like best, or the one that will match your other furniture.  Should the builder want an entire hand-made stand, the drip pan may be beaten into shape from sheet brass or copper. This kind of work is known as repouss√©. After beating the pan into shape, it can be finished in antique, old copper or given a polished surface, as desired.     A CHAFING-DISH BUFFET   The chafing-dish buffet is something very convenient and attractive for the dining room. For the best effect it should be made of quartered oak, stained brown or weathered and trimmed with brass hardware.  [Illustration: Buffet in Quartered Oak]  To save a great deal of uninteresting labor, secure the following pieces of stock, surfaced on four sides and cut to length:    4 legs, 1-1/2 by 1-1/2 by 36 in., S-4-S.   4 rails, 7/8 by 4 by 10 in., S-4-S.   2 rails, 7/8 by 3 by 10 in., S-4-S.   2 panels, 3/8 by 9-3/8 by 9-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 panel, 3/8 by 6-1/2 by 9-1/2 in., S-4-S.   2 shelves, 7/8 by 12 by 19 in., S-4-S.   1 top, 7/8 by 16 by 20 in., S-4-S.   2 stiles for door, 7/8 by 2 by 12 in., S-4-S.   2 rails for door, 7/8 by 3 by 10 in., S-4-S.   1 back, 7/8 by 12 by 13 in., S-4-S.   8 slats, 3/8 by 1 by 8 in., S-4-S.  Begin the work on the rails for the sides of the stand. Have them all squared up to exactly the same length and to the correct width and thickness. Mark the tenons on the ends of each and cut them with a saw and chisel.  When this is finished, try the legs to see that they are all the same length and that their surfaces are square with each other. Next mark the mortises in the legs for the tenons of the rails. To make the mortises, first bore to depth with a bit 1/8 in, smaller than the width of the mortise and cut to the line with a chisel.  [Illustration: Method of Fastening with Screws]  Before gluing up the sides, cut the mortises in two lower rails for the tenons on the ends of the shelves. These tenons, with the smaller mortises in them for the keys, should be cut first. Square up the two side panels and cut grooves 3/8 in. wide and 1/4 in. deep for them in the rails and part of the legs.  Make the eight slats 8 in. long, 1 in. wide and 3/8 in. thick, and cut mortises for them in the two upper rails.  [Illustration: Detail of the Chafing-Dish Buffet]  The two sides of the buffet are now ready to be glued up and clamped. While the glue on these is setting, make the door. The rails are mortised into the stiles 1/2 in. and both are grooved to receive the panel. It is best to get the stock a little full for the door so that it may be made up a little larger than necessary and planed down to fit.  There only remains to fit in the shelves and fasten the top and back. The top and back are held with screws as shown in sketch.  Taper the keys only slightly, otherwise they will keep working loose.  Stain with two coats of weathered oak, give one coat of thin shellac to fix the stain and two coats of wax for a soft-gloss finish.     A WRITING DESK   The desk shown in the illustration was made of plain-sawed white oak. The copper lighting fixtures were made by the amateur as were the hinges and the drawer pulls. The doors are fitted with art-glass panels. The following stock list is needed:    1 top, 3/4 by 22-1/2 by 41 in., S-2-S.   4 posts, 2 by 2 by 31 in., S-4-S.   2 rails, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 19 in., S-2-S.   2 rails, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 35 in., S-2-S.   2 rails, 3/4 by 3-1/4 by 19 in., S-2-S.   1 stretcher, 3/4 by 3-1/4 by 35 in., S-2-S.   2 drawer fronts, 3/4 by 4-1/4 by 14 in., S-2-S.   4 drawer sides, 1/2 by 4-1/4 by 19 in., S-2-S.   2 drawer backs, 3/8 by 4 by 14 in., S-2-S.   2 drawer bottoms, 3/8 by 19 by 14 in., S-2-S.   4 slides, 3/4 by 2-1/2 by 19 in., S-2-S.   8 guides, 3/4 by 2 by 10 in., S-2-S.   2 cabinet posts, 1 by 1 by 16 in., S-4-S.   4 cabinet posts, 1 by 1 by 11 in., S-4-S.   1 back, 3/4 by 16 by 35 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 8 by 35 in., S-2-S.   2 shelves, 3/4 by 8 by 15 in., S-2-S.   4 door pieces, 5/8 by 1 by 15 in., S-2-S.   8 door pieces, 5/8 by 1 by 4 in., S-2-S.  Square the legs to length and lay out and cut the mortises thereon. Lay off the tenons on the rails, after having squared the rails to length and width, and cut them.  Work up the top of the table and then the drawer stock and cabinet. Assemble the ends of the frame first, using good hot glue and enough clamps to hold the parts together properly. After the glue has hardened on these, the clamps may be removed and the front, back rails and the stretcher assembled.  [Illustration: Writing Desk Made of Plain-Sawed Oak]  While the glue is hardening on the main frame the top cabinet may be built and assembled. This cabinet is detachable from the table proper and is to be held in place by means of cleats upon the back. These cleats are not specified in the bill; they may be obtained from scrap stock.  [Illustration: Detail of the Writing Desk]  For a piece of woodwork of this style some of the softer browns of the mission stains will be most appropriate. After all parts have been thoroughly cleaned by scraping and sandpapering, a stain may be applied. Allow this to dry, then sand it lightly and apply a thin coat of shellac. Sand the shellac lightly and apply a filler of a color to match the stain, but darker in tone, of course. Clean off the surplus in the usual manner and then apply a coat of shellac. Sand this lightly and apply several coats of some good polishing wax.     MUSIC RACK AND BOOKSTAND   The illustration shows a very handy music and bookstand, which also can be used at the bedside as a reading stand. The following list of material will be required for construction:    1 standard, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 37 in., S-4-S.   1 horizontal, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 15 in., S-4-S.   1 crosspiece, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 14 in., S-4-S.   1 crosspiece, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 12 in., S-4-S.   2 braces, 1-1/8 by 1-1/8 by 9 in., S-4-S.   1 board, 1/2 by 8 by 13 in., S-2-S.   4 blocks, 1-1/8 in. square.   2 gauge clamps.   1 strip, 1/2 by 1 by 13 in., S-2-S.   8 round-head brass screws.   1 brass rod, 1/4 in. in diameter and 12 in, long.   1 brass piece, 1/4 by 3/4 by 10 in.  [Illustration: Complete Stand]  Cut a tenon on the lower end of the upright and make a mortise in the center of the long crosspiece to receive the tenon. The horizontal has tenons cut on both ends which fit into mortises cut in the sides of both crosspieces. The upper corners on the ends of both crosspieces are cut sloping on a 45-deg. angle. The blocks for the feet are attached to the under side and at the end on each crosspiece with screws and hot glue, the screw heads being sunk so that they will not catch on carpets or mar the floor. The braces are attached with round-head screws after they are cut on each end to fit the standard and crosspiece.  [Illustration: Detail of the Stand]  The book rest is cut from the board. The openings are made by sawing the pieces out with a coping saw, and the edges are dressed up with a sharp chisel. The lip strip is then glued to the lower edge of the board.  One end of the board is now fitted into a slot cut in one of the gauge clamps. The slot must be cut at the right angle to give the desired slope to the book rest. The gauge clamps are joined with two small square strips of oak as shown. The small rod brace is flattened at both ends and a hole drilled in each to fasten it with screws as shown. The brass strip is bent in the middle at right angles and drilled to receive screws for fastening it in the corner of the upright and horizontal pieces.     A DICTIONARY AND MAGAZINE STAND   The accompanying picture shows a stand that is intended primarily for holding a large-size dictionary. The shelves may be utilized for holding books, magazines or sheet music. It will stand wear best if made of some hard wood, such as oak. Of the soft woods chestnut has the best grain for finishing, being hardly distinguishable from red oak.  The following pieces will be necessary:    2 sides, 3/4 by 16 by 38-1/2 in., S-4-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 15-1/2 by 21 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 14 by 17 in., S-2-S.   1 shelf, 3/4 by 13-1/2 by 21 in., S-2-S.   1 top, 3/4 by 13 by 17 in., S-2-S.   1 lip, 3/8 by 3/4 by 17 in., S-4-S.   8 keys,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23666"],["title","Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 3 (#4)"],["body","/4 by 1 by 3-1/2 in., S-2-S.  Begin work on the sides by preparing a joint edge on each piece and from this square up the lower ends and square lines across the inner surfaces to indicate the positions of the lower edges of the shelves.  Next, smooth off the mill marks from the broad surfaces of the shelves and square them to size on one edge and the two ends.  [Illustration: Detail of the Dictionary and Magazine Stand]  [Illustration: Stand Made in Oak]  Return to the side pieces and lay out the outline, but do not cut to these lines until the gains and mortises which are to receive the ends of the shelves and their tenons have been laid out and cut. Laying out these outlines at this time is done so as to give the exact width the shelves are to have. These dimensions can be determined by measuring across the sides between the outlines at the points where the shelves are to be placed.  The shelves which have no tenons are to be let into the sides 1/4 in. They should be shouldered 1/2 in. back from the edge so that the groove will not show on the face.  The lip on the front of the top shelf may be fastened by means of very small brads, the heads of which should be covered with putty, colored to match the finish.  A suitable finish may be obtained as follows:  First see that all the mill marks are removed, using a smooth plane and steel scraper and sandpaper, then apply a coat of cathedral-oak water stain. When dry, sandpaper lightly, using No. 00 paper. Apply a second coat of stain, diluting it by the addition of an equal volume of water. This is to produce a stronger contrast. Sand this lightly and put on a very thin coat of shellac to bind the filler and to prevent the stain in the filler which follows from discoloring the high lights. Sand this lightly and put on a coat of paste filler according to the directions that will be found on the can. This filler should be colored in the following proportions: Light paste filler, 20 lb.; Van Dyke brown, 1 lb. After the filler has hardened, sand it lightly and put on a coat of orange shellac. Follow this with several coats of some good rubbing varnish. The first coats should be rubbed with haircloth or curled hair, and the last with powdered pumice stone and raw linseed or crude oil.     A LEATHER BACK ARM CHAIR   [Illustration: Arm Chair Complete]  [Illustration: Detail of the Arm Chair]  A mission arm chair of simple design and construction is shown in the accompanying illustration. This chair is suitable for any room of the house and can be made of wood to match other furniture. Quarter-sawed oak is the wood most generally used, and it is also very easy to obtain. The stock can be ordered from the mill, cut to length, squared and sanded. Following is a list of the material that will be needed:    2 front legs, 2 by 2 by 26-3/4 in.   2 back legs, 2 by 4 by 43 in.   2 arm rests, 1 by 4 by 26 in.   5 rails, 3/4 by 4 by 21-1/2 in.   5 rails, 3/4 by 2 by 2-1/2 in. .   2 back pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 16-1/2 in.   1 piece leather, 31 in, square.   1 piece burlap, 28 in, square.   2 pieces leather, 13 by 18 in.   2 pieces burlap, 13 by 18 in.   1 box 8 oz. tacks.   5-1/2 doz. ornamental nails.  Start with the front legs. Cut a tenon 1-1/4 in. square and 3/4 in, long on one end to fit the arm rests. The mortises for the side rails are cut 1/2 in. wide and 7/8 in, deep. The tenons on the rails are cut to fit these mortises, care being taken to get them all the same length between shoulders. The back legs are cut with an offset of 2 in. as shown in the detail drawing and also have mortises cut in them for the back crosspieces. The upright pieces in the back are fastened into the crosspieces by means of tenons and mortises, and should be in place when the crosspieces are fastened to the legs.  The arms are cut from the 1 by 4 by 26-in. pieces. Be careful to get them so they will pair. The outside edge can be either curved or straight as desired. The front ends of the arms are held in place by mortises which fit over the tenons on the ends of the front legs, while the back ends are held in place by round-headed screws as shown.  The chair is now ready to be glued. Be sure to get the parts together perfectly square, and when dry scrape off all surplus glue around the joints, for stain will not adhere to glue and a white spot will be the result of failing to remove it. Go over the parts carefully with fine sandpaper and remove all rough marks. Then apply the stain you wish to use. To make the seat, first fit boards in the bottom and nail them to the side rails as shown. Fill the space with hair or elastic cotton felt to about 3 in. above the edge of the rails. Bind this down tightly with a piece of burlap and tack the edges to the rails. Cut out the corners of the burlap so that it will fit about the posts. Put the leather on over this and tack the edges to the bottoms of the rails. Then finish with the ornamental nails as shown.  To finish the back, first tack a piece of burlap over the opening, then place a layer of hair or cotton felt on this about 1 in. thick. Stretch the leather over this and fasten with ornamental nails. The back side is finished in the same manner, except that the hair is omitted.     A WALL SHELF   Coarse-grained woods make up into furniture and take a more satisfactory finish than close-grained woods. For this reason chestnut or oak is suggested for this shelf. Chestnut has a beautiful grain and is soft and easily worked.  There will be needed the following pieces:    Sides, 2 pieces, 3/4 by 7-1/4 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.   Lower shelf, 1 piece, 3/4 by 6-1/4 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.   Upper shelf, 1 piece, 3/4 by 4-3/4 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.   Lower back, 1 piece, 3/8 by 3-1/2 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.   Upper back, 1 piece, 3/8 by 3 by 30-1/2 in., S-2-S.  In making out this stock bill the pieces have been specified 1/4 in. wider and 1/2 in, longer than the finished piece is to be to allow for squaring up. The thicknesses are specified mill-planed exact so that all that is necessary is to merely plane off the mill-marks from the two broad surfaces.  It is quite possible that one may have a particular space or a particular set of books to place in the shelf. In such a case the length of the horizontals should be lengthened or shortened to meet the particular demands when ordering the lumber.  [Illustration: Complete Wall Shelf]  Begin work by squaring the horizontals to size. They are to be all of the same length. Next shape up the end pieces. The amount of slope for the front edges is indicated on the drawing. After all these pieces have been squared up and the mill-marks removed, the dadoes or grooves and gains may be laid out and cut.  Beginners are prone to underestimate the importance of getting all the mill-marks off before putting on any finish. When boards are planed at the mill the planing is done by means of two or four knives revolving above or below the board--sometimes both above and below at the same time. These knives leave the surfaces filled with little ridges and hollows across the grain. These hollows, though they are hardly visible to the eye on the unfinished surface, show up as ugly streaks upon the surface after it has had a finish of stain and filler applied.  The joints here used are typical and the beginner can readily find how they are to be made from any good book on wood-working.  [Illustration: Wall Shelf Detail]  There are several ways of fastening the parts. They may be fastened by means of round-head blued screws. They may be fastened with carriage screws. The one in the illustration was put together with ordinary wire nails and the heads of these covered with ornamental heads to represent old-fashioned hand-wrought nails.  It will be found easier to apply the finish of stain and filler before the parts are assembled. A suitable finish is obtained as follows: After the parts are thoroughly sanded, put on a coat of Filipino water stain, wiping it off with an old cloth before it has had time to soak into the wood very much. Allow this to dry. Then sand lightly, using No. 00 paper, after which fill the pores of the wood with a black paste filler--directions will be found on the can. Follow this, when hardened, with several coats of floor wax.     A PEDESTAL   The pedestal shown in the accompanying illustration is another piece of furniture that can be made in the mission style. It is very simple in design and construction, and can be made by anyone who has a few simple tools and a slight knowledge of their use. It is best to make it of quarter-sawed oak as this is the most easily procured wood and also looks the best when finished. If you order the material from the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded, much hard labor will be saved. Following is a list of the material needed:    1 top, 3/4 by 12 by 12 in., S-1-S.   1 bottom, 3/4 by 12 by 12 in., S-1-S   8 pieces, 3/4 by 2 by 11 in.   2 sides, 3/4 by 5 by 26 in., S-1-S.   2 sides, 3/4 by 3-1/2 by 26 in.   1 piece, 3/4 by 6 by 6 in.   4 blocks, 1 in. square.  [Illustration: Completed Pedestal]  Having the boards for the post cut to the proper length and square, nail them together as shown in the detail drawing. Use finishing nails, then set the heads and fill the holes with putty. Next, nail the 3/4 by 6-in. piece on one end of the post leaving the edges projecting even on all sides. Pick out the best board for the top. On the under side and 1/2. in. in from the edges, nail four of the 3/4 by 2 by 11-in. pieces which have been previously mitered as shown in the plan view. Now fasten this top to the post by nailing through the projecting edge of the top piece into the top board. Be careful to get this top on square with the post and exactly in center.  The bottom board is made in the same manner as the top board and is nailed to the lower end of the post as shown. Four 1-in. square blocks should be fastened to the bottom for the pedestal to rest on.  When complete, sandpaper smooth"]]]
