Twins have to be born the same day, now truly, or they can't _be_ twins!\"  There was wisdom in Ada's voice, and wisdom in her superior smile. Flaxie raised her eyes, but that smile was too much for her, and she dropped them again. If there was one thing Flaxie could not bear, it was to be laughed at by a girl of her own age, who knew more than she did.  At that moment the school-bell rang, and, oh dear, those biscuits were not half done! So very queer, too, for the stove-pipe was red-hot, and roaring away beautifully!  The three little cooks were the last to enter the schoolhouse, and Miss Pike wondered what they were whispering about in the entry.  \"Dear little creatures,\" thought she, petting their heads, \"I'm glad they've had a good time, for they deserve it!\"  She called a class, and everything went on as usual, till suddenly she thought she smelt smoke, and went to the window to look out.  Miss Pike was a most sensible young lady, and knew better than to scream; but I assure you she never felt more like screaming in her life. The \"house that Jack built\" was all ablaze from top to bottom, and had already set fire to the schoolhouse!  She had to think fast. There were sixty children to be got out, and no time to lose. If they should know the house was on fire they would be crazed with fright and run hither and thither like wild creatures; it would never do to let them know it.  Miss Sarah was at the farther end of the room setting copies slowly, very slowly. She did not look up, and Miss Pike had no time to go and speak to her; the only thing she could do was to walk quietly up to the desk and ring the bell. That meant, \"Put up your books.\" A strange order while a class was reciting; but it was obeyed instantly.  \"Star-spangled Banner,\" said Miss Pike, calmly. She could see the little tongues of flame running along the ceiling now, but she looked as if she was thinking of nothing but music and waiting for Miss Sarah to pitch the tune. Miss Sarah dropped her pen and did it of course, wondering why; and all the sixty voices joined in it, clear and loud, as they had often done before; while in time to the music the whole sixty children marched in orderly file out of the room.  \"_Now, run!_\" cried Miss Pike, the moment the last child was in the entry, \"run and tell everybody the schoolhouse is on fire!\"  She had a pail of water in her hand. The children rushed through the streets screaming; the bells began to ring; the Hilltop fire-engine came out; and all the people and horses and dogs in the village. But Miss Pike was the first to pour water on the flames, and everybody said it was she who saved the schoolhouse.  There was a black hole in the wall, and another in the roof; the books were, many of them, soaked and ruined; the floor an inch deep with water, and it would take a whole week to set things to rights. But the schoolhouse was saved.  \"Why, how did it take fire?\" asked Uncle Ben, who had been out of town and did not come back till all was over.  The boys looked another way, the twin cousins hung their heads. Aunt Charlotte did not answer. She was wondering which child would speak first.  It was Flaxie Frizzle. Her face was very pale, and her eyes were fixed on the carpet.  \"We've got something _orful_ to tell you,\" said she, her voice trembling; \"we baked our biscuits, and Johnny built a house out there with a stove-pipe in, and we oughtn't to taken any matches. You better believe we cried!\"  \"Well, well, you young rogues; so _you_ set the schoolhouse afire? And who saved it?\"  \"Miss Pike!\" broke forth all the children in chorus.  \"Yes,\" said Johnny; \"but she marched us all out first, so the little ones wouldn't get burnt. Never said a word about the fire till we got out!\"  \"She always does things just right. She's one of God's girls,\" cried Freddy.  \"Yes,\" broke in Flaxie, strongly excited; \"I don't care if I can't see her soul. I've seen it shine! Oh, it's beautiful to be homely!\"  Nobody smiled--they all thought Flaxie was right.  \"Yes, it is beautiful to be homely in just Miss Pike's way,\" said Aunt Charlotte.  And then they went out to supper, and, as the twin cousins looked broken-hearted, nothing more was said about the house that Jack built.  \"Oh, Flaxie, _do_ you s'pose we've suffered enough?\" asked little Milly that night after they had said their prayers and were lying in bed looking at the pure soft moonlight which shone on the far-away hills.  \"I don' know. I feel as if I had a pain, don't you? Oh dear!\"  \"Yes, that's just the way I feel; a pain way in deep,\" replied Milly, heaving a sorrowful sigh. \"And I ought to, I'm glad of it.\"  \"Glad, Milly Allen? How queer! Why, _I_ don't like to feel bad!\"  \"I don't either,\" said Milly, sitting up in bed and speaking very earnestly. \"But don't you 'member what Auntie Prim said that time we ran away from the party? She said children ought to suffer for their naughtiness; it's the only way they can learn to behave better.\"  \"Well, any way,\" said Flaxie, rolling her eyes uneasily, \"'twas Johnny that put in the stove-pipe, and he ought to feel the worst. I'm going to ask Preston about that, see 'f I don't.\"  Two days after this Flaxie went home, and her little frizzled head was not seen at Hilltop any more till the next December. Then her dear Grandma Gray had rheumatic fever, and though Flaxie pitied her all she could, she made too much noise in the house, and had to be sent away. But I will tell you about that in the next chapter.     CHAPTER VII.  HILLTOP AGAIN.   \"Little red riding hood, where are you going?\"  \"Going to see my grandmother,\" replied Flaxie Frizzle, peeping out from under her scarlet hood. \"And here's a pat of butter for her in this wee, wee basket.\"  \"My dear Red Riding Hood, your grandmother is too sick to eat butter. Shut the door, walk very softly, and bring me my writing-desk. I'm going to write Aunt Charlotte, and ask her if she wants you at Hilltop.\"  \"Oh, mamma, how elegant! Is it 'cause grandma's sick?\" cried Flaxie, dropping her wee, wee basket, butter and all. She ought to have been ashamed to find she was so noisy that she had to be sent away from home; but she never thought about that. She did try to keep still, but as she had said to Julia that very morning, \"there wasn't any still in her!\"  \"Oh, let me write it myself to Milly; please let me write it myself.\"  Flaxie was seven years old now, and had actually learned how to scribble pretty fast. She was very proud of this, for Milly could do nothing but print.  She seized a postal card, ruled it downhill with a pencil, and wrote on it a few cramped-up words, huddled close together like dried apples on a string:       \"Dear Twin Little Cousin: My Mamma is going to let me go to your      House and go to school to your Dear teacher, becaus I make too      much noise, and Grammy is sick with Something in her back and Ime      glad but not unless your Mamma is willing. Wont you please to write      and say so. My lines are unstraight, and its real too bad Good by      FLAXIE FRIZZLE.\"  Mrs. Gray smiled when her little daughter asked how to spell _unstraight_, and smiled again when she saw the card and read, \"Dear twin little cousin.\"  \"Oh, I know better than that,\" explained Flaxie, blushing: \"we're not twins a bit, and couldn't be if we should try, and we've known it for quite a long time; but you see, mamma, we're _make-believing_, just for fun.\"  \"I never saw such a child for 'make-believing,'\" said Mrs. Gray, kissing Flaxie, who skipped gayly out of the room to pack her valise.  She always packed it, if there was the least thing said about going away. She didn't mind the trouble, it was such a pretty valise,--made of brown canvas, with leather straps like a trunk. And she knew Aunt Charlotte would want her at Hilltop,--people always do want little girls, and can't have too many of them,--and it was best to be ready in season.  So she looked up her little umbrella, with F. F. painted on it in white letters, her school-books that she had been playing school with all over the house, and a half bushel or so of her best dolls. But as she did not go for a week, she had time to lose these things over and over, and some of them were never found any more.  \"Now, darling,\" said mamma, when Flaxie had bidden good-bye to papa and Preston, and Ninny and the baby, and was just entering the car behind her friend Mrs. Prim. \"Now, darling, don't be troublesome to dear Aunt Charlotte, and if you'll learn to be good and orderly and sweet like your Cousin Milly, I shall be so glad.\"  Flaxie pondered upon this speech as she sat rattling along in the cars, munching peanuts, while Mrs. Prim took care of the shells.  \"Troublesome. Oh, my! 's if _I_ ever troubled anybody! 'Cept Grandma Gray; and that's 'cause she's got something in her back. But mamma _always_ thinks Milly is nicer than me! Queer what makes mammas _never_ like their own little girls!--I mean, not much. Now Aunt Charlotte thinks I'm the nicest. She scolds to Milly sometimes, but she don't scold to ME!\"  Hilltop had been green when Flaxie left it, but now it was white, and seemed lovelier than ever, for Johnny had a new sled, and was \"_such_ a kind-hearted boy!\" That is, he was always ready to draw the twin cousins on the ice till they were half frozen and begged him to stop, and I hardly see how he _could_ have been kinder than that!  Then the school was \"perfickly elegant,\" taught by that same dear teacher, Miss Pike. What if her nose _was_ red, and her mouth so large that little Betty Chase called her \"the lady that can't shut her face\"? She was just lovely for all that, and Flaxie and Milly couldn't forget that she had saved the schoolhouse when it was set on fire by mistake. After that she hadn't looked homely a minute,--only \"a beautiful homely,\" that is ever and ever so much better than handsome;--and the little girls fairly adored her.  Now"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23540"],["title","The Twin Cousins (#8)"],["body","was quick to learn, but as a general thing she didn't study very hard, I am obliged to confess. When she couldn't spell her lessons she said to Milly, \"It's 'cause you don't have the same kind of books we have where I live. The words look so queer in your books!\"  If Flaxie was noisy at Laurel Grove, what was she at Hilltop? Sometimes in the evening, when she played the piano and sang, Aunt Charlotte was really afraid she would disturb Mrs. Hunter, who lived in the other half of the house.  \"Oh, I like it,\" said Mrs. Hunter, pleasantly; \"but don't you think, Mrs. Allen, there is danger of her pounding your piano in pieces?\"  But by and by there wasn't so much time for music and play. The busy season had begun, when everybody was making ready for Christmas; and the twin cousins had as much as they could do in talking over what they were _going_ to do, as they sat in each other's lap and looked at their work-baskets.  Flaxie wanted to make a marvellous silk bedquilt for her dear mamma out of pieces as big as a dollar; but, finding there wouldn't be time for that, concluded to buy her a paper of needles, \"if it didn't cost too much.\"  Probably there wouldn't have been anything done but talking if Aunt Charlotte hadn't brought out some worsteds and canvas and set the helpless little ones at work upon a holder called the \"Country Cousin.\" They had a hard time over this young lady, and almost wished sometimes that she had never been born; but she turned out very brilliant at last, in a yellow skirt, red waist, and blue bonnet, with a green parasol over her head. After this they had courage to make some worsted balls for the babies, some cologne mats for their brothers who never used cologne, and some court-plaster cases for somebody else, with the motto, \"I stick to you when others cut you.\"  Both the children were tired with all this labor, and Flaxie discovered, after her presents were packed and ready to send off by express, that she didn't feel very well.  \"My throat is so sore I can't _swoler_,\"--so she wrote on a postal to her mother; for when she was sick she wanted everybody to know it.  Before Aunt Charlotte heard of the sad condition of her throat, she had said she might go with Milly and Johnny and some of the older children in the village, to see the ladies trim the church. But when Flaxie came into the parlor with her teeth chattering, Aunt Charlotte began to fear she ought not to go out.  \"Are you so very chilly, my dear?\"  \"Yes 'm, I am,\" replied Flaxie, with a doleful look around the corners of her mouth. \"This house isn't heated by steam like my house where I live, and I'm drefful easy to freeze!\" And her teeth chattered again.  Aunt Charlotte looked anxious, as she drew on her gloves.  \"My child, you'd better not go to the church, for it's rather cold there.\"  \"Cold as a barn,\" put in Johnny.  \"Oh, auntie, do please, lemme go! I'm cold, but it's a _warm_ cold though,\" said Flaxie, eagerly; and her teeth stopped chattering.  \"I'm sorry, Flaxie, but there's a chill in the air like snow, and if your throat is sore it is much wiser for you to stay at home,\" said Aunt Charlotte, gently but firmly, like a good mother who is accustomed to be obeyed by her children.  And poor Flaxie was obliged to submit, though it cut her to the heart when Milly gave her a light kiss and skipped away; and she did think it was cruel in Aunt Charlotte to advise her to go into the nursery and stay with Nancy and the baby. She wished she had never said a word about her throat.  \"It don't feel any worse'n a mosquito-bite,\" thought she, watching the gay party from the window,--half a dozen ladies and as many children; \"it don't hurt me to swallow either,\"--swallowing her tears.  \"Hilltop's such a queer place! Not the least speck of steam in the houses! If they had steam, you could go anywhere, if your throat _was_ sore! And I never saw anybody trim a church; and oh, Milly says they'll have _beau_-tiful flowers, and crosses, and things! _I_ never saw anybody trim _anything_--'cept a loaf of cake and flowers on a bonnet.\"  Foolish Flaxie, to stand there winking tears into her eyes! _You_ would have known better; you would have gone into the nursery to play with that lovely baby; but there were times, I am sorry to say, when Flaxie really enjoyed being unhappy. So now she stood still, rolling her little trouble over and over, as boys roll a snowball, making it larger and larger, till presently it was as big as a mountain.  \"Auntie _said_ I might go, and then she wouldn't lemme! Made me stay at home to play with that ole baby! He's squirmy and wigglesome; what do I want to play with _him_ for, when she _said_ I might go? I like good aunties; I don't like the kind that tell lies.  \"Oh, my throat _is_ growing sore, and I'm going off up-stairs to stay in the cold, and get sick, 'cause they ought to keep steam; and _then_ I guess auntie'll be sorry!\"  I grieve to tell you this about Flaxie, for I fear you will not like a little girl who could be so very naughty.  When the happy party of church-trimmers came home at tea-time, there she was up-stairs in the \"doleful dumps;\" and it was a long while before Milly could coax her down.  When she came at last, her face was a sight to behold--all purple, and spotted, and striped; for a fit of crying always gave her the appearance of measles. She consented to take a seat at table, but ate little, said nothing, and gazed mournfully at her plate.  This distressed Aunt Charlotte, but she asked no questions, and tried to keep Johnny talking, so he would not notice his afflicted little cousin.  \"Now what _does_ make you act so?\" asked Milly, as soon as tea was over.      \"'Got a _cricket_ in my neck;     Can't move it a single speck,'\"  replied Flaxie, not knowing she had made poetry, till Johnny, who was supposed to be ever so far off, began to laugh; and then she moved her neck fast enough, and shook her head, and stamped her foot.  \"Let's go in the nursery, so Johnny can't plague you,\" said the peace-loving Milly. \"I'm so sorry you're sick.\"  Flaxie had not meant to speak, but she could not help talking to Milly.  \"Wish I'se at home,\" said she, reproachfully, \"'cause my mamma keeps pepmint.\"  \"Why, Flaxie, my mamma keeps it too. We've got lots and lots of it in the cupboard.\"  \"Don't care if you have,\" snapped Flaxie. \"I just despise pepmint. It's something else I want, and can't think of the name of; but I know you don't keep it, for your papa isn't a doctor!\"  It was not the first time Flaxie had wounded her sweet cousin's feelings by this same cutting remark.  \"Dr. Papa keeps _tittlish_ powders in blue and white papers, and one of the papers _buzzes_. I guess he'd give me that, but I don't know,\" added Flaxie, crying again harder than ever, though the tears fell like fire on her poor, sore cheeks.     CHAPTER VIII.  A CRAZY CHRISTMAS.   \"You dear little thing,\" said Aunt Charlotte, coming into the room with Ken in her arms, but putting him down and taking up her naughty niece. \"You've been getting homesick all by yourself this long afternoon. Where did you stay?\"  \"Stayed up-sta--irs,\" sobbed Flaxie.  \"In the cold? Why, darling, what made you?\"  \"You all went off and left me,\" replied Flaxie, with a little tempest of tears.  Then auntie understood it all,--how this child, who was old enough to know better, had been rolling a little bit of a trouble over and over, till it had grown into a mountain and almost crushed her. And the mother-heart in Aunt Charlotte's bosom ached for poor foolish Flaxie.  \"She has added to her cold, and is feverish,\" thought the good lady, sending for Nancy to bring some hot water in the tin bath-tub that was used for washing the children.  \"I shall have you sleep with me to-night, in the down-stairs room,\" said Aunt Charlotte; \"and I'll put a flannel round your neck, dear, and some poultices on your feet.\"  Flaxie smiled faintly as she saw the dried burdock-leaves soaking in vinegar, for she liked to have a suitable parade made over her when she was sick. Besides, she had often thought she should enjoy sleeping in the \"down-stairs room,\" and was glad now that Uncle Ben happened to be gone; that is, as glad as she could be of anything. It was a miserable, forlorn world all of a sudden to Flaxie, and she had never known such \"a mean old night,\" even if it was \"the night before Christmas.\"  The lamp burning dimly in the corner of the room, on the floor, cast shadows that frightened her; her head ached; she woke the baby in the crib by crying, and then he woke everybody else.  It was a \"mean old night\" to the whole house; and when I say the _whole_ house, I mean both halves of it. About midnight, as Mrs. Hunter was sleeping sweetly, her door-bell rang a furious peal. Nobody likes to hear such a sound at dead of night, and Mrs. Hunter trembled a little, for she was all alone with her children; but she rose and dressed as fast as possible, and went down-stairs with a lamp.  \"Who is it?\" she asked, through the keyhole.  \"It's ME!\" said a childish voice that she thought sounded like one of the Allen children.  She ventured to open the door, and there on the steps in the darkness stood Flaxie Frizzle, bareheaded, shivering, and looking terribly frightened.  \"Oh, Mrs. Hunter, something _orful_ has happened at our house. Oh, come quick, Mrs. Hunter!\"  \"Yes, yes, dear, I'll go this minute; but what is it?\" said the lady, hurrying to the entry closet for her shawl.  \"Auntie is crazy! She is running round and round with the tea-kettle.\"  Mrs. Hunter stood still with amazement.  \"Who sent _you_ here?\" said she. \"Why don't they call the doctor?\"  \"I don't know. She's going to scald me to death, and I s'pose you know I'm sick,\" whined Flaxie, sinking down on the doormat, where the light of the lamp shone full upon her, and Mrs. Hunter saw--what she might have seen before, if she had not been so nervous--that the little girl wore a checked flannel nightie, and her feet were done"]]]
