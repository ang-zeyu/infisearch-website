I trained in a Dutchman ... just about the fastest scouter there is. What condition?\"  \"Lousy ... but it's fueled, with six weeks' supplies in the hold, and it doesn't cost us a cent. Courtesy of a friend. You'll have to check it over, but it'll do.\"  They inspected the ship, a weatherbeaten scouter that looked like a relic of the '90's. Inside there were signs of many refittings and overhauls, but the atomics were well shielded, and it carried a surprising chemical fuel auxiliary for the cabin size. Greg disappeared into the engine room, and Tom and Johnny left him testing valves and circuits while they headed down to the U.N. Registry office in the control tower.  On the way Johnny outlined the remaining outfitting steps. Tom would be responsible for getting the clearance permit through Registry; Johnny would check out all supplies, and then contact the observatory for the orbit coordinates of Roger Hunter's claims.  \"I thought the orbits were mapped on the claim papers,\" Tom said. \"I mean, every time an asteroid is claimed, the orbit has to be charted....\"  \"That's right, but the orbit goes all the way around the sun. We know where the _Scavenger_ was when the Patrol ship found her ... but she's been travelling in orbit ever since. The observatory computer will pinpoint her for us and chart a collision course so we can cut out and meet her instead of trailing her for a week. Do you have the crew-papers Greg and I signed?\"  \"Right here.\"  They were stepping off the ramp below the ship when a man loomed up out of the shadows. It was a miner Tom had never seen before. Johnny nodded as he approached. \"Any news, Jack?\"  \"Quiet as a church,\" the man said.  \"We'll be held up another eight hours at least,\" Johnny said. \"Don't go to sleep on us, Jack.\"  \"Don't worry about us sleepin',\" the man said grimly. \"There's been nobody around but yourselves, so far ... except the clearance inspector.\"  Johnny looked up sharply. \"You check his papers?\"  \"_And_ his prints. He was all right.\"  Johnny took Tom's arm, and they headed through the gate toward the control tower. \"I guess I'm just naturally suspicious,\" he grinned, \"but I'd sure hate to have a broken cut-off switch, or a fuel valve go out of whack at just the wrong moment.\"  \"You think Tawney would dare to try something here?\" Tom said.  \"Never hurts to check. We've got our hands full for a few hours getting set, so I just asked my friends to keep an eye on things. Always did say that a man who's going to gamble is smart to cover his bets.\"  At the control tower they parted, and Tom walked into the clearance office. Johnny's watch-man had startled him, and for the first time he felt a chill of apprehension. If they were right ... if this trip to the Belt were not a wild goose chase from the very start ... then Roger Hunter's accident had been no accident at all.  Quite suddenly, Tom felt very thankful that Johnny Coombs had friends....         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't like it,\" the Major said, facing Tom and Greg across the desk in the U.N. Registry office below the control tower. \"You've gotten an idea in your heads, and you just won't listen to reason.\"  Somewhere above them, Tom could hear the low-pitched rumble of a scout-ship blasting from its launching rack. \"All we want to do is go out and work Dad's claim,\" he said for the second time.  \"I know perfectly well what you want to do, that's why I told the people here to alert me if you tried to clear a ship. You don't know what you're doing ... and I'm not going to sign those clearance papers.\"  \"Why not?\" Greg said.  \"Because you're going out there asking for trouble, that's why not.\"  \"But you told us before that there wasn't any trouble. Dad had an accident, that was all. So how could we get in trouble?\"  The Major's face was an angry red. He started to say something, then stopped, and scowled at them instead. They met his stare. Finally he threw up his hands. \"All right, so I can't legally stop you,\" he said. \"But at least I can beg you to use your heads. You're wasting time and money on a foolish idea. You're walking into dangers and risks that you can't handle, and I hate to see it happen.  \"Mining in the Belt is a job for experienced men, not rank novices.\"  \"Johnny Coombs is no novice.\"  \"No, but he's lost his wits, taking you two out there.\"  \"Well, are there any other dangers you have in mind?\"  Once more the Major searched for words, and failed to find them. \"No,\" he sighed, \"and you wouldn't listen if I did.\"  \"It seems everybody is warning us about how dangerous this trip is likely to be,\" Greg said quietly. \"Last night it was Merrill Tawney. He offered to buy us out, he was so eager for a deal that he offered us a fantastic price. Then Johnny tells us that Dad mined some rich ore when he was out there on his last trip, but never got a chance to bring it in because of his ... accident. Up until now I haven't been so sure Dad _didn't_ just have an accident, but now I'm beginning to wonder. Too many people have been warning us....\"  \"You're determined to go out there, then?\"  \"That's about right.\"  The Major picked up the clearance papers, glanced at them quickly, and signed them. \"All right, you're cleared. I hate to do it, but I suppose I'd go with you if the law would let me. And I'll tell you one thing ... if you can find a single particle of evidence that will link Jupiter Equilateral or anybody else to your father's death, I'll use all the power I have to break them.\" He handed the papers back to Tom. \"But be careful, because if Jupiter Equilateral is involved in it, they're going to play dirty.\"  At the door he turned. \"Good trip, and good luck.\"  Tom folded the papers and stuck them thoughtfully into his pocket.  They met Johnny Coombs in the Registry offices upstairs; Tom patted his pocket happily. \"We're cleared in forty-five minutes,\" he said.  Johnny grinned. \"Then we're all set.\" They headed up the ramp, reached ground level, and started out toward the launching racks.  At the far end of the field a powerful Class I Ranger, one of the Jupiter Equilateral scout fleet, was settling down into its slot in a perfect landing maneuver. The triangle-and-J-insignia gleamed brightly on her dark hull. She was a rich, luxurious-looking ship. Many miners on Mars could remember when Jupiter Equilateral had been nothing more than a tiny mining company working claims in the remote \"equilateral\" cluster of asteroids far out in Jupiter's orbit. Gradually the company had grown and flourished, accumulating wealth and power as it grew, leaving behind it a thousand half-confirmed stories of cheating, piracy, murder and theft. Other small mining outfits had fallen by the wayside until now over two-thirds of all asteroid mining claims were held by Jupiter Equilateral, and the small independent miners were forced more and more to take what was left.  They reached the gate to the Dutchman's launching slot and entered.  Inside the ship Tom and Johnny strapped down while Greg made his final check-down on the engines, gyros and wiring. The cabin was a tiny vault, with none of the spacious \"living room\" of the orbit-ships. Tom leaned back in the accelleration cot, and listened to the count-down signals that came at one minute intervals now. In the earphones he could hear the sporadic chatter between Greg and the control tower. No hint that this was anything but a routine blastoff....  But there was trouble ahead, Tom was certain of that. Everybody on Mars was aware that Roger Hunter's sons were heading out to the Belt to pick up where he had left off. Greg had secured a leave of absence from Project Star-Jump ... unhappily granted, even though his part in their program had already been disrupted. Even they had heard the rumors that were adrift....  And if there was trouble now, they were on their own. The Asteroid Belt was a wilderness, untracked and unexplored, and except for an almost insignificant fraction, completely unknown. If there was trouble out there, there would be no one to help.  Somewhere below the engines roared, and Tom felt the weight on his chest, sudden and breath-taking.  They were on their way.     4. \"Between Mars and Jupiter....\"   After all the tension of preparing for it, the trip out seemed interminable.  They were all impatient to reach their destination. During blastoff and accelleration they had watched Mars dwindle to a tiny red dot; then time seemed to stop altogether, and there was nothing to do but wait.  For the first eight hours of free fall, after the engines had cut out, Tom was violently ill. He fought it desperately, gulping the pills Johnny offered and trying to keep them down. Gradually the waves of nausea subsided, but it was a full twenty-four hours before Tom felt like stirring from his cot to take up the shipboard routine.  And then there was nothing for him to do. Greg handled the navigation skilfully, while Johnny kept radio contact and busied himself in the storeroom, so Tom spent hours at the viewscreen. On the second day he spotted a tiny chunk of rock that was unquestionably an asteroid moving swiftly toward them. It passed at a tangent ten thousand miles ahead of them, and Greg started work at the computer, feeding in the data tapes that would ultimately guide the ship to its goal.         *       *       *       *       *  Pinpointing a given spot in the Asteroid Belt was a gargantuan task, virtually impossible without the aid of the ship's computer to compute orbits, speeds, and distances. Tom spent more and more time at the viewscreen, searching the blackness of space for more asteroid sightings. But except for an occasional tiny bit of debris "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23882"],["title","Gold in the Sky (#5)"],["body","by, he saw nothing but the changeless panorama of stars.  Johnny Coombs found him there on the third day, and laughed at his sour expression. \"Gettin' impatient?\"  \"Just wondering when we'll reach the Belt, is all,\" Tom said.  Johnny chuckled. \"Hope you're not holdin' your breath. We've already been _in_ the Belt for the last forty-eight hours.\"  \"Then where are all the asteroids?\" Tom said.  \"Oh, they're here. You just won't see many of them. People always think there ought to be dozens of them around, like sheep on a hillside, but it just doesn't work that way.\" Johnny peered at the screen. \"Of course, to an astronomer the Belt is just loaded ... hundreds of thousands of chunks, all sizes from five hundred miles in diameter on down. But actually, those chunks are all tens of thousands of miles apart, and the Belt _looks_ just as empty as the space between Mars and Earth.\"  \"Well, I don't see how we're ever going to find one particular rock,\" Tom said, watching the screen gloomily.  \"It's not too hard. Every asteroid has its own orbit around the sun, and everyone that's been registered as a claim has the orbit charted. The one we want isn't where it was when your Dad's body was found ... it's been travelling in its orbit ever since. But by figuring in the fourth dimension, we can locate it.\"  Tom blinked. \"Fourth dimension?\"  \"Time,\" Johnny Coombs said. \"If we just used the three linear dimensions ... length, width and depth ... we'd end up at the place where the asteroid _was_, but that wouldn't help us much because it's been moving in orbit ever since the Patrol Ship last pinpointed it. So we figure in a fourth dimension ... the time that's passed since it was last spotted ... and we can chart a collision course with it, figure out just where _we'll_ have to be to meet it.\"  It was the first time that the idea of time as a \"dimension\" had ever made sense to Tom. They talked some more, until Johnny started bringing in fifth and sixth dimensions, and problems of irrational space and hyperspace, and got even himself confused.  \"Anyway,\" Tom said, \"I'm glad we've got a computer aboard.\"  \"And a navigator,\" Johnny added. \"Don't sell your brother short.\"  \"Fat chance of that. Greg would never stand for it.\"  Johnny frowned. \"You lads don't like each other very much, do you?\" he said.  Tom was silent for a moment. Then he looked away. \"We get along, I guess.\"  \"Maybe. But sometimes just gettin' along isn't enough. Especially when there's trouble. Give it a thought, when you've got a minute or two....\"  Later, the three of them went over the computer results together. Johnny and Greg fed the navigation data into the ship's drive mechanism, checking and rechecking speeds and inclination angles. Already the Dutchman's orbital speed was matching the speed of Roger Hunter's asteroid ... but the orbit had to be tracked so that they would arrive at the exact point in space to make contact. Tom was assigned to the viewscreen, and the long wait began.  He spotted their destination point an hour before the computer had predicted contact ... at first a tiny pinpoint of reflected light in the scope, gradually resolving into two pinpoints, then three in a tiny cluster. Greg cut in the rear and lateral jets momentarily, stabilizing their contact course; the dots grew larger.  Ten minutes later, Tom could see their goal clearly in the viewscreen ... the place where Roger Hunter had died.         *       *       *       *       *  It was neither large nor small for an asteroid, an irregular chunk of rock and metal, perhaps five miles in diameter, lighted only by the dull reddish glow from the dime-sized sun. Like many such jagged chunks of debris that sprinkled the Belt, this asteroid did not spin on any axis, but constantly presented the same face to the sun.  Just off the bright side the orbit-ship floated, stable in its orbit next to the big rock, but so small in comparison that it looked like a tiny glittering toy balloon. And clamped on its rack on the orbit-ship's side, airlock to airlock, was the _Scavenger_, the little scout ship that Roger Hunter had brought out from Mars on his last journey.  While Greg maneuvered the Dutchman into the empty landing rack below the _Scavenger_ on the hull of the orbit-ship, Johnny scanned the blackness around them through the viewscope, a frown wrinkling his forehead.  \"Do you see anybody?\" Tom asked.  \"Not a sign ... but I'm really looking for other rocks. I can see three that aren't too far away, but none of them have claim marks. This one must have been the only one Roger was working.\"  They stared at the ragged surface of the planetoid. Raw veins of metallic ore cut through it with streaks of color, but most of the sun-side showed only the dull gray of iron and granite. There was nothing unusual about the surface that Tom could see. \"Could there be anything on the dark side?\"  \"Could be,\" Johnny said. \"We'll have to go over it foot by foot ... but first, we should go through the orbit-ship and the _Scavenger_. If the Patrol ship missed anything, we want to know it.\"  The interior of the orbit-ship was dark. It spun slowly on its axis, giving them just enough weight so they would not float free whenever they moved. Their boots clanged on the metal decks as they climbed up the curving corridor toward the control cabin.  Then Johnny threw a light switch, and they stared around them in amazement.  The cabin was a shambles. Everything that was not bolted down had been ripped open and thrown aside.  Greg whistled through his teeth. \"The Major said the Patrol crew had gone through the ship ... but he didn't say they'd wrecked it.\"  \"They didn't,\" Johnny said grimly. \"No Patrol ship would ever do this. Somebody else has been here since.\" He turned to the control panel, flipped switches, checked gauges. \"Hydroponics are all right. Atmosphere is still good; we can take off these helmets. Fuel looks all right, storage holds ...\" He shook his head. \"They weren't looting, but they were looking for something, all right. Let's look around and see if they missed anything.\"  It took them an hour to survey the wreckage. Not a compartment had been missed. Even the mattresses on the accelleration cots had been torn open, the spring-stuffing tossed about helter-skelter. Tom went through the lock into the _Scavenger_; the scout ship too had been searched, rapidly but thoroughly.  But there was no sign of anything that Roger Hunter might have found.  Back in the control cabin Johnny was checking the ship's log. The old entries were on microfilm, stored on their spools near the reader. More recent entries were still recorded on tape. From the jumbled order, there was no doubt that marauders had examined them. Johnny ran through them nevertheless, but there was nothing of interest. Routine navigational data; a record of the time of contact with the asteroid; a log of preliminary observations on the rock; nothing more. The last tape recorded the call-schedule Roger Hunter had set up with the Patrol, a routine precaution used by all miners, to bring help if for some reason they should fail to check in on schedule.  There was no hint in the log of any extraordinary discovery.  \"Are any tapes missing?\" Greg wanted to know.  \"Doesn't look like it. There's one here for each day-period.\"  \"I wonder,\" Tom said. \"Dad always kept a personal log. You know, a sort of a diary, on microfilm.\" He peered into the film storage bin, checked through the spools. Then, from down beneath the last row of spools he pulled out a slightly smaller spool. \"Here's something our friends missed, I bet.\"  It was not really a diary, just a sequence of notes, calculations and ideas that Roger Hunter had jotted down and microfilmed from time to time. The entries on the one spool went back for several years. Tom fed the spool into the reader, and they stared eagerly at the last few entries.  A series of calculations, covering several pages, but with no notes to indicate what, exactly, Roger Hunter had been calculating. \"Looks like he was plotting an orbit,\" Greg said. \"But what orbit? And why? Nothing here to tell.\"  \"It must have been important, though, or Dad wouldn't have filmed the pages,\" Tom said. \"Anything else?\"  Another sheet with more calculations. Then a short paragraph written in Roger Hunter's hurried scrawl. \"No doubt now what it is,\" the words said. \"Wish Johnny were here, show him a _real_ bonanza, but he'll know soon enough if....\"  They stared at the scribbled, uncompleted sentence. Then Johnny Coombs let out a whoop. \"I told you he found something! And he found it _here_, not somewhere else.\"  \"Hold it,\" Greg said, peering at the film reader. \"There's something more on the last page, but I can't read it.\"  Tom blinked at the entry. \"'Inter Jovem et Martem planetam interposui,'\" he read. He scratched his head. \"That's Latin, and it's famous, too. Kepler wrote it, back before the asteroids were discovered. 'Between Jupiter and Mars I will put a planet.'\"  Greg and Johnny looked at each other. \"I don't get it,\" Greg said.  \"Dad told me about that once,\" Tom said. \"Kepler couldn't understand the long jump between Mars and Jupiter, when Venus and Earth and Mars were so close together. He figured there ought to be a planet out here ... and he was right, in a way. There wasn't any one planet, unless you'd call Ceres a planet, but it wasn't just empty space between Mars and Jupiter either. The asteroids were here.\"  \"But why would Dad be writing that down?\" Greg asked. \"And what has it got to do with what he found out here?\" He snapped off the reader switch angrily. \"I don't understand any of this, and I don't like it. If Dad found something out here, where is it? And who tore this ship apart after the Patrol ship left?\"  \"Probably the same ones that caused the 'accident' in the first place,\" Johnny said.  \"But why did they come back?\" Greg protested. \"If they killed Dad, they must have known what he'd found before they"]]]
