Mark you not     He keeps aloof from all the revels?      _Bel._                              But     Not from the council--there he is ever constant.      _Arb._ And ever thwarted: what would you have more     To make a rebel out of? A fool reigning,                           100     His blood dishonoured, and himself disdained:     Why, it is _his_ revenge we work for.      _Bel._                               Could     He but be brought to think so: this I doubt of.      _Arb._ What, if we sound him?      _Bel._                       Yes--if the time served.                                _Enter_ BALEA.      _Bal._ Satraps! The king commands your presence at     The feast to-night.      _Bel._              To hear is to obey.     In the pavilion?      _Bal._           No; here in the palace.      _Arb._ How! in the palace? it was not thus ordered.      _Bal._ It is so ordered now.      _Arb._                        And why?      _Bal._                                I know not.     May I retire?      _Arb._       Stay.      _Bel._ (_to Arb. aside_). Hush! let him go his way.                110     (_Alternately to Bal._) Yes, Balea, thank the Monarch, kiss the hem     Of his imperial robe, and say, his slaves     Will take the crumbs he deigns to scatter from     His royal table at the hour--was't midnight?      _Bal._ It was: the place, the hall of Nimrod. Lords,     I humble me before you, and depart.                     [_Exit_ BALEA.      _Arb._ I like not this same sudden change of place;     There is some mystery: wherefore should he change it?      _Bel._ Doth he not change a thousand times a day?     Sloth is of all things the most fanciful--                         120     And moves more parasangs in its intents     Than generals in their marches, when they seek     To leave their foe at fault.--Why dost thou muse?      _Arb._ He loved that gay pavilion,--it was ever     His summer dotage.      _Bel._             And he loved his Queen--     And thrice a thousand harlotry besides--     And he has loved all things by turns, except     Wisdom and Glory.      _Arb._            Still--I like it not.     If he has changed--why, so must we: the attack     Were easy in the isolated bower,                                   130     Beset with drowsy guards and drunken courtiers;     But in the hall of Nimrod----      _Bel._                         Is it so?     Methought the haughty soldier feared to mount     A throne too easily--does it disappoint thee     To find there is a slipperier step or two     Than what was counted on?      _Arb._                    When the hour comes,     Thou shall perceive how far I fear or no.     Thou hast seen my life at stake--and gaily played for:     But here is more upon the die--a kingdom.      _Bel._ I have foretold already--thou wilt win it:                  140     Then on, and prosper.      _Arb._                Now were I a soothsayer,     I would have boded so much to myself.     But be the stars obeyed--I cannot quarrel     With them, nor their interpreter. Who's here?                              _Enter_ SALEMENES.      _Sal._ Satraps!      _Bel._            My Prince!      _Sal._                     Well met--I sought ye both,     But elsewhere than the palace.      _Arb._                         Wherefore so?      _Sal._ 'Tis not the hour.      _Arb._                    The hour!--what hour?      _Sal._                                         Of midnight.      _Bel._ Midnight, my Lord!      _Sal._                     What, are you not invited?      _Bel._ Oh! yes--we had forgotten.      _Sal._                             Is it usual     Thus to forget a Sovereign's invitation?      _Arb._ Why--we but now received it.                                150      _Sal._                              Then why here?      _Arb._ On duty.      _Sal._           On what duty?      _Bel._                         On the state's.     We have the privilege to approach the presence;     But found the Monarch absent.[k]      _Sal._                        And I too     Am upon duty.      _Arb._       May we crave its purport?      _Sal._ To arrest two traitors. Guards! Within there!                               _Enter Guards_.      _Sal._ (_continuing_).                              Satraps,     Your swords.      _Bel._ (_delivering his_). My lord, behold my scimitar.      _Arb._ (_drawing his sword_). Take mine.      _Sal._ (_advancing_).                     I will.      _Arb._                             But in your heart the blade--     The hilt quits not this hand.[l]      _Sal._ (_drawing_).         How! dost thou brave me?     Tis well--this saves a trial, and false mercy.                     160     Soldiers, hew down the rebel!      _Arb._                        Soldiers! Aye--     _Alone, you_ dare not.      _Sal._                Alone! foolish slave--     What is there in thee that a Prince should shrink from     Of open force? We dread thy treason, not     Thy strength: thy tooth is nought without its venom--     The serpent's, not the lion's. Cut him down.      _Bel._ (_interposing_). Arbaces! Are you mad? Have I not rendered     _My_ sword? Then trust like me our Sovereign's justice.      _Arb._   No--I will sooner trust the stars thou prat'st of,     And this slight arm, and die a king at least                       170     Of my own breath and body--so far that     None else shall chain them.      _Sal._ (_to the Guards_).     You hear _him_ and _me_.     Take him not,--kill.                          [_The Guards attack_ ARBACES, _who defends himself                             valiantly and dexterously till they waver_.      _Sal._                   Is it even so; and must     I do the hangman's office? Recreants! see     How you should fell a traitor.                                              [SALEMENES _attacks_ ARBACES.                      _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and Train_.      _Sar._                         Hold your hands--     Upon your lives, I say. What, deaf or drunken?     My sword! O fool, I wear no sword: here, fellow,     Give me thy weapon.                                     [_To a Guard_.                   [SARDANAPALUS _snatches a sword from one of the soldiers,                      and rushes between the combatants--they separate_.      _Sar._             In my very palace!     What hinders me from cleaving you in twain,     Audacious brawlers?      _Bel._              Sire, your justice.      _Sal._                                 Or--                        180     Your weakness.      _Sar._ (_raising the sword_). How?      _Sal._             Strike! so the blow's repeated     Upon yon traitor--whom you spare a moment,     I trust, for torture--I'm content.      _Sar._                             What--him!     Who dares assail Arbaces?      _Sal._                    I!      _Sar._                      Indeed!     Prince, you forget yourself. Upon what warrant?      _Sal._ (_showing the signet_). Thine.      _Arb._ (_confused_).               The King's!      _Sal._ Yes! and let the King confirm it.      _Sar._ I parted not from this for such a purpose.      _Sal._ You parted with it for your safety--I     Employed it for the best. Pronounce in person.     Here I am but your slave--a moment past                            190     I was your representative.      _Sar._                     Then sheathe     Your swords.            [ARBACES _and_ SALEMENES _return their swords to the scabbards_.      _Sal._ Mine's sheathed: I pray you sheathe _not_ yours:     Tis the sole sceptre left you now with safety.      _Sar._ A heavy one; the hilt, too, hurts my hand.     (_To a Guard_.) Here, fellow, take thy weapon back. Well, sirs,     What doth this mean?      _Bel._               The Prince must answer that.      _Sal._ Truth upon my part, treason upon theirs.      _Sar._ Treason--Arbaces! treachery and Beleses!     That were an union I will not believe.      _Bel._ Where is the proof?      _Sal._                          I'll answer that, if once          200     The king demands your fellow-traitor's sword.      _Arb._ (_to Sal._). A sword which hath been drawn as oft as thine     Against his foes.      _Sal._          And now against his brother,     And in an hour or so against himself.      _Sar._ That is not possible: he dared not; no--     No--I'll not hear of such things. These vain bickerings     Are spawned in courts by base intrigues, and baser     Hirelings, who live by lies on good men's lives.     You must have been deceived, my brother.      _Sal._                                   First     Let him deliver up his weapon, and                                 210     Proclaim himself your subject by that duty,     And I will answer all.      _Sar._                 Why, if I thought so--     But no, it cannot be: the Mede Arbaces--     The trusty, rough, true soldier--the best captain     Of all who discipline our nations----No,     I'll not insult him thus, to bid him render     The scimitar to me he never yielded     Unto our enemies. Chief, keep your weapon.      _Sal._ (_delivering back the signet_).     Monarch, take back your signet.      _Sar._                          No, retain it;     But use it with more moderation.      _Sal._                          Sire,                             200     I used it for your honour, and restore it     Because I cannot keep it with my own.     Bestow it on Arbaces.      _Sar._                So I should:     He never asked it.      _Sal._             Doubt not, he will have it,     Without that hollow semblance of respect.      _Bel._ I know not what hath prejudiced the Prince     So strongly 'gainst two subjects, than whom none     Have been more zealous for Assyria's weal.      _Sal._ Peace, factious priest, and faithless soldier! thou     Unit'st in thy own person the worst vices                          230     Of the most dangerous orders of mankind.

Thy fellow's sin     Is, at the least, a bold one, and not tempered     By the tricks taught thee in Chaldea.      _Bel._                                Hear him,     My liege--the son of Belus! he blasphemes     The worship of the land, which bows the knee     Before your fathers.      _Sar._               Oh! for that I pray you     Let him have absolution. I dispense with     The worship of dead men; feeling that I                            240     Am mortal, and believing that the race     From whence I sprung are--what I see them--ashes.      _Bel._ King! Do not deem so: they are with the stars,     And----      _Sar._  You shall join them ere they will rise,     If you preach farther--Why, _this_ is rank treason.      _Sal._ My lord!      _Sar._          To school me in the worship of     Assyria's idols! Let him be released--     Give him his sword.      _Sal._              My Lord, and King, and Brother,     I pray ye pause.      _Sar._           Yes, and be sermonised,     And dinned, and deafened with dead men and Baal,                   250     And all Chaldea's starry mysteries.      _Bel._ Monarch! respect them.      _Sar._                       Oh! for that--I love them;     I love to watch them in the deep blue vault,     And to compare them with my Myrrha's eyes;     I love to see their rays redoubled in     The tremulous silver of Euphrates' wave,     As the light breeze of midnight crisps the broad     And rolling water, sighing through the sedges     Which fringe his banks: but whether they may be     Gods, as some say, or the abodes of Gods,                          260     As others hold, or simply lamps of night,     Worlds--or the lights of Worlds--I know nor care not.     There's something sweet in my uncertainty     I would not change for your Chaldean lore;     Besides, I know of these all clay can know     Of aught above it, or below it--nothing.     I see their brilliancy and feel their beauty[m]--     When they shine on my grave I shall know neither.      _Bel._ For _neither_, Sire, say _better_.      _Sar._                                   I will wait,     If it so please you, Pontiff, for that knowledge.                  270     In the mean time receive your sword, and know     That I prefer your service militant     Unto your ministry--not loving either.      _Sal._ (_aside_). His lusts have made him mad. Then must I save him,     Spite of himself.      _Sar._            Please you to hear me, Satraps!     And chiefly thou, my priest, because I doubt thee     More than the soldier; and would doubt thee all     Wert thou not half a warrior: let us part     In peace--I'll not say pardon--which must be     Earned by the guilty; this I'll not pronounce ye,                  280     Although upon this breath of mine depends     Your own; and, deadlier for ye, on my fears.     But fear not--for that I am soft, not fearful--     And so live on. Were I the thing some think me,     Your heads would now be dripping the last drops     Of their attainted gore from the high gates     Of this our palace, into the dry dust,     Their only portion of the coveted kingdom     They would be crowned to reign o'er--let that pass.     As I have said, I will not _deem_ ye guilty,                       290     Nor _doom_ ye guiltless. Albeit better men     Than ye or I stand ready to arraign you;     And should I leave your fate to sterner judges,     And proofs of all kinds, I might sacrifice     Two men, who, whatsoe'er they now are, were     Once honest. Ye are free, sirs.      _Arb._                          Sire, this clemency----      _Bel._ (_interrupting him_).     Is worthy of yourself; and, although innocent,     We thank----      _Sar._      Priest! keep your thanksgivings for Belus;     His offspring needs none.      _Bel._                    But being innocent----      _Sar._ Be silent.--Guilt is loud. If ye are loyal,                 300     Ye are injured men, and should be sad, not grateful.      _Bel._ So we should be, were justice always done     By earthly power omnipotent; but Innocence     Must oft receive her right as a mere favour.      _Sar._ That's a good sentence for a homily,     Though not for this occasion. Prithee keep it     To plead thy Sovereign's cause before his people.      _Bel._ I trust there is no cause.      _Sar._                             No _cause_, perhaps;     But many causers:--if ye meet with such     In the exercise of your inquisitive function                       310     On earth, or should you read of it in heaven     In some mysterious twinkle of the stars,     Which are your chronicles, I pray you note,     That there are worse things betwixt earth and heaven     Than him who ruleth many and slays none;     And, hating not himself, yet loves his fellows     Enough to spare even those who would not spare him     Were they once masters--but that's doubtful. Satraps!     Your swords and persons are at liberty     To use them as ye will--but from this hour                         320     I have no call for either. Salemenes!

He hath changed                    330     Nothing except our ignorance of all     Suspicion into such a certainty     As must make madness of delay.      _Arb._                        And yet--      _Bel._ What, doubting still?      _Arb._                      He spared our lives, nay, more,     Saved them from Salemenes.      _Bel._                     And how long     Will he so spare? till the first drunken minute.      _Arb._ Or sober, rather. Yet he did it nobly;     Gave royally what we had forfeited     Basely----      _Bel._    Say bravely.      _Arb._                 Somewhat of both, perhaps--     But it has touched me, and, whate'er betide,                       340     I will no further on.      _Bel._                And lose the world!      _Arb._ Lose any thing except my own esteem.      _Bel._ I blush that we should owe our lives to such     A king of distaffs!      _Arb._              But no less we owe them;     And I should blush far more to take the grantor's![16]      _Bel._ Thou may'st endure whate'er thou wilt--the stars     Have written otherwise.      _Arb._                  Though they came down,     And marshalled me the way in all their brightness,     I would not follow.      _Bel._             This is weakness--worse     Than a scared beldam's dreaming of the dead,                       350     And waking in the dark.--Go to--go to.      _Arb._ Methought he looked like Nimrod as he spoke,     Even as the proud imperial statue stands     Looking the monarch of the kings around it,     And sways, while they but ornament, the temple.      _Bel._ I told you that you had too much despised him,     And that there was some royalty within him--What     then? he is the nobler foe.      _Arb._                     But we     The meaner.--Would he had not spared us!      _Bel._                                   So--     Wouldst thou be sacrificed thus readily?                           360      _Arb._ No--but it had been better to have died     Than live ungrateful.      _Bel._                Oh, the souls of some men!     Thou wouldst digest what some call treason, and     Fools treachery--and, behold, upon the sudden,     Because for something or for nothing, this     Rash reveller steps, ostentatiously,     'Twixt thee and Salemenes, thou art turned     Into--what shall I say?--Sardanapalus!     I know no name more ignominious.      _Arb._                           But     An hour ago, who dared to term me such                             370     Had held his life but lightly--as it is,     I must forgive you, even as he forgave us--     Semiramis herself would not have done it.      _Bel._ No--the Queen liked no sharers of the kingdom,     Not even a husband.[17]      _Arb._              I must serve him truly----      _Bel._ And humbly?      _Arb._               No, sir, proudly--being honest.     I shall be nearer thrones than you to heaven;     And if not quite so haughty, yet more lofty.     You may do your own deeming--you have codes,     And mysteries, and corollaries of                                  380     Right and wrong, which I lack for my direction,     And must pursue but what a plain heart teaches.     And now you know me.      _Bel._               Have you finished?      _Arb._                                 Yes--     With you.      _Bel._    And would, perhaps, betray as well     As quit me?      _Arb._       That's a sacerdotal thought,     And not a soldier's.      _Bel._               Be it what you will--     Truce with these wranglings, and but hear me.      _Arb._                                        No--     There is more peril in your subtle spirit     Than in a phalanx.      _Bel._            If it must be so--     I'll on alone.      _Arb._         Alone!      _Bel._               Thrones hold but one.                         390      _Arb._ But this is filled.      _Bel._                      With worse than vacancy--     A despised monarch. Look to it, Arbaces:     I have still aided, cherished, loved, and urged you;     Was willing even to serve you, in the hope     To serve and save Assyria. Heaven itself     Seemed to consent, and all"]]]
