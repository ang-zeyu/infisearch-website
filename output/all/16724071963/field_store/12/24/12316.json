It was just as Draycott had made the unpleasant discovery that no longer did the weekly boat run from Marseilles to Tunis and thence to Malta, and was debating on the rival merits of a journey through Italy, and thence by Syracuse to the island of goats; or a journey through Spain to Gibraltar, and thence by sea--with luck, that a railway magnate entered and gave his celebrated rendering of a boiler explosion.  It appeared--when every one had partially recovered--that he was the proud possessor of ten francs and three sous.  He also admitted to a wife suffering from something with a name that hurt, and various young railway magnates of both sexes.  It transpired that the ten francs and three sous had been laboriously collected from his _ménage_ only that morning; that the youngest hopeful had wept copiously on losing her life's savings; and further, that it was the limit of his resources.  He had letters of credit, or something dangerous of that sort, to the extent of a few million; he was prepared to buy the whole one-donkey country by a stroke of the pen, but--in hard cash--he had ten francs and three sous. . . .  It was pathetic; it was dreadful.  An American multi-millionaire, one of those strange beings of whom one reads, who corner tin-tacks and things, and ruin or make thousands with a word, reduced to ten francs and three sous.  For not another cent piece did America's pride obtain; not another sou to add to the three.  Politely, firmly, a harassed clerk shooed him away.  No, he could not tell him when the next boat would sail--perhaps to-morrow, perhaps in a fortnight.  He did not know, and he did not care how he proposed to live during that period, and he had no intention of furnishing him with any money to do it with.  He had definite orders from his firm: no cheques cashed under any circumstances whatever.  He was sorry the gentleman didn't like Marseilles, or war, or France, or him personally; he regretted deeply that the gentleman's wife liked peaches with every meal, and hoped he'd manage all right on his ten francs; he----  And then came the interruption.  They crowded to the door, and watched them coming.  Occasionally a cheer rang out, but for the most part they came in silence, passing through the ranks of people that lined the road each side.  Half way down the column a band blared forth, and every now and then the Colonel in front lifted his right hand gravely in a salute.  They were small men, the poilus of that regiment; but they marched well, with a swing, and the glint of white teeth.  Sometimes they waved a greeting to a girl on the footpath, and she would smile back, or throw them a flower or a kiss.  And like a ripple going down the lines of spectators, men took off their hats suddenly.  The Colours were passing. . . .  Almost dazedly the American took off his hat as the ripple reached him; then he put it on again and turned to Draycott.  \"Hell!\" he remarked tersely, \"and I've been worry in' over a ten-franc note.  I guess I feel a bit small.\"  He turned and followed the regiment, with his hands deep in his pockets, and his shoulders squared.   VI  It came through the following afternoon--the news they had been waiting for; and now for a certain period the curtain of discretion must be drawn.  I gather that Draycott has dim recollections of a stout field officer endeavouring to stand on a small marble-topped table, with a glass of beer in each hand.  He was making a speech--chiefly in Hindustani--to the frenzied mob of cheering Frenchmen around him.  Then he came to the point when the best people say \"Vive la France!\"  He remembered he had a hat on; he remembered he ought to take it off; he did.  The only thing he forgot was the beer.  But as he said later when they sorted him out, it was an old suit, and England didn't declare war every day. . . .  The following night they left in an ancient old cargo boat, skippered by the type of man who has since made our mercantile marine the glory of the world.  His job was to get his peculiarly odoriferous cargo home to his owners as soon as possible; beyond that he either failed or refused to look.  The entire German Navy might have been waiting outside for all he cared; he merely consumed a little more whisky, and conducted morning prayers.  He would give them no assurance; they went at their own risk, but, if the boat got there, he would land them at Gibraltar.  And having thought the matter over, and realised that firstly a journey through Italy might result in their being kept as prisoners of war; secondly, that a journey through Spain would probably take a fortnight at least; and thirdly, that any way they could do neither as they could get no money, Draycott and his friends embarked with the patent manure, and watched the lights of Marseilles growing fainter and fainter till they dropped below the horizon astern.  It was an uneventful voyage, and never for one hour after the first day were they out of sight of land.  It was the only concession the skipper would make for the safety of his boat; and so they jogged along at a peaceful ten knots and watched the sun set each evening in a blaze of golden glory over the rocky coast of Spain.  For the first time since leaving England a week before, they were able to think.  In the rush to Paris, in the horse-box to Marseilles, in Marseilles itself, they had been too busy.  Besides, they were outsiders. . . .  Now, England was in it; the thing which they had known in their hearts was coming, ever since a kindly senior subaltern had first taken it upon himself to shape their destinies, had actually come.  And bitterest thought of all--_they_ were not there.  \"It can't last more than three months.\"  A pessimistic garrison gunner from Malta, who was playing patience, cheated savagely.  \"I tell you no European country could stand it.\"  Undoubtedly the fatuous drivel of certain writers had influenced even the Army itself.  \"Peace will be declared before Christmas.  An' I'll have sat on that cursed island, and whenever I see a ship I'd like to poop at, the searchlight will go out, an' I'll be bitten by sand flies.\"  He glared morosely at Draycott; until, suddenly, a dawning look of joy spread over his face. \"It's coming out.  I swear it's coming out!\"  \"You cheated,\" remarked an onlooker cruelly.  \"I saw you with my own eyes.\"  It was then that he burst into tears. . . .  Shut off as they were from the outside world--the old tramp had no wireless--they could only wonder, and wait, fuming with impatience. What had happened?  Had the fleets met?  Had the wonderful day which the German Navy was popularly supposed to be living for--had it arrived?  And if it had--what had been the result?  They could only lean over the stern and try and grasp the one monumental fact--war. And what did it hold in store? . . .  Visions of forlorn hopes, visions of glory, visions of the glamour of war rose unbidden in their minds.  And then, when they had got as far as that, the smell of that patent manure obtruded itself once again, and the dreamers of honours to come passed sadly down the gangway to the Levantine villain who presided over the vermouth and the gin. Which might be taken as the text for a sermon on things as they are. In this war it is the patent manure and the vermouth which dominate the situation as far as the fighters, at any rate, are concerned.  The talkers may think otherwise, may prate of soul-stirring motives, and great ideals.  But for the soldiers, life is a bit too grim and overpowering for gloss.  After a spell they come for their vermouth, for something to help nerves a trifle jangled, something to give a contrast to stark reality, and having had it they go back again to the patent manure; while the onlookers see visions and dream dreams.  I suppose it's a fair division of labour! . . .   VII  It was the distinguished-looking gentleman in blue who came alongside just after they dropped anchor at the Rock, who brought the glorious news.  He ascended the gangway with great dignity, and disappeared into some secret place with the skipper.  After some delay and a slight commotion, various flags were hoisted, and he majestically appeared again.  It seemed that the hoisting of the flags had apparently been successful.  Suspicion had been averted by this simple act; there was no longer any danger of being made a target for enthusiastic gunners. And, what was more to the point, the distinguished gentleman was now free to impart his great tidings.  \"The German fleet, gentlemen,\" he remarked genially, \"has ceased to exist.\"  \"Who said so?\" asked a doubting voice.  \"It is in all the Spanish papers.\"  The Admiral, or whatever he was, eyed the speaker compassionately.  \"A great action has taken place in the North Sea; we have lost nineteen big ships in addition to destroyers, and the German fleet is wiped out.\"  \"It doesn't seem good enough, does it?\" murmured a graceless member of the group.  \"But if it's really authentic?\"  Draycott turned to him doubtfully. \"And there must be something in it if it's in all the Spanish papers.\"  \"On the contrary,\" returned the graceless one.  \"It is precisely that fact that makes me believe there is nothing in it.\"  The remark seemed conclusive; and yet so detailed was the information all over Gib, so definite the lists of vessels sunk on each side, that even intelligent Scorps--as the inhabitants of the place are known--were impressed.  Strangely enough, exactly the same detailed lists, with just sufficient difference to make them credible, were in all the Italian papers at the same time--though this only transpired later.  At the moment nothing much mattered but the time of the next boat going East: it was their own little personal future that counted.  A naval battle--yes, perhaps; nineteen ships down--the German fleet as well; fifty or sixty thousand men--gone, finished, wiped out.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23874"],["title","No Man's Land (#3)"],["body","yet it was the next boat they wanted to know about.  Callous--I think not; merely a total incapability to realise a thing so stupendous.  It has been the same all through the war: the tragedies have been too big for human minds to grasp.  It is the little things that tell; the isolated thumb-nail impressions that live in one's mind, and will go with us to the grave.  The one huddled form lying motionless in the shell-hole, with its staring, sightless eyes; the one small, but supreme sacrifice: that is the thing which hits--hits harder than the _Lusitania_, or any other of the gigantic panels of the war. The pin-pricks we feel; the sledge hammer merely stuns.  And the danger is that those who have felt the pin-pricks may confuse them with the sledge hammer; may lose the right road in the bypaths of personal emotion.  War means so infinitely much to the individual; the individual means so infinitely little to war.  Only it is sometimes hard to remember that simple fact. . . .   VIII  It was from the top of the Rock that they watched their evil-smelling boat depart, to plug on northward up the home trail, unperturbed by naval battles or rumours thereof.  And it was from the top of the Rock they first saw the smoke of the P. and O., outward bound, on which they were destined to complete the journey.  Below lay the bay, dotted with German and Austrian ships caught on the high seas at the outbreak of war; a destroyer was going half-speed towards the Atlantic; a cruiser lay in dock, her funnels smoking placidly.  Out towards Algeciras an American battleship, with her peculiar steel trellis turrets, was weighing anchor; and in the distance, across the Straits, Africa, rugged and inhospitable, shimmered in the heat haze of an August day.  \"So long.\"  The gunner subaltern waved a weary hand from his point of vantage, where he was inspecting life with a telescope.  \"There's your barge, but she won't leave till to-morrow.  If this goes on for much longer, my nerves will give way under the strain.  The excitement is too great.\"  It appears that Draycott had forebodings even before he got on board that P. and O.  Since then she has become almost historic amongst those of the Regular Army whose abode at the beginning of the war was overseas.  Save for the fact that no one was playing the harmonium, or any other musical instrument, the appearance of her decks as they came alongside was reminiscent of one of those delightful pleasure steamers on which one may journey, at comparatively small cost, up and down the Thames.  A seething mob of people, almost exclusively composed of the male sex, glared furiously at them and one another--but principally at them--as they came up the gangway, and departed in search of the purser.  All the stairs down to the dining saloon were occupied by morose passengers, and an enlivening altercation was in progress between two elderly gentlemen of ferocious aspect anent the remnants of what had once been a cushion.  A mild-looking being, closely clutching a tired deck-chair, was descending to the dining saloon, where infuriated men were loudly thumping the tables.  \"Good heavens, gentlemen! what do you want?\"  A haggard purser peered at them from his office.  \"Berths!\"  He broke into a shout of maniacal laughter, and then pulled himself together.  \"The fourteenth stair leading to the engine-room is not taken, but there's an exhaust pipe passes under it, and it becomes too hot to sit on.  There is room for two in a coal bunker which should be empty by to-night; otherwise, the hold, if you can find room.\"  \"But what's all the trouble,\" they queried peevishly.  \"Surely----\"  \"Trouble!\"  The purser swallowed hard.  \"We have on board eighty-four generals, two hundred and twenty colonels, and one thousand eight hundred and ninety-one what-nots of junior rank.  They have all been recalled from leave; they have all come by this boat.  The eighteenth breakfast is now being served--perhaps.\"  With a dreadful cry he seized the brandy bottle, while they faded slowly and sadly away.  There are things too terrible for contemplation. . . .  It was a wonderful trip--that final stage to the Half Way House of Malta.  There was the dreadful incident of the short-sighted subaltern who got into a full Colonel's bed by mistake, when that worthy officer had just gone down on four no trumps redoubled.  In vain to point out the similarity of engine-room gratings--in vain to plead short sight. The subsequent scene lingered in the memory for days.  There was the case of the sleep walker, who got loose in the hold, and ambled heavily over four hundred infuriated human sardines, till he finally fell prostrate into what was apparently the abode of spare china.  Last but not least there was the dreadful Case of the Major-General's Bath.  Of this Draycott speaks first hand; he, personally, was an awe-struck spectator.  Now the question of baths on that boat was not one to be trifled with.  The queue for the pit of a popular play was as nothing to the procession that advanced to the bath in the morning. And the least penalty for sharp practice with regard to one's turn was death.  Into the bathroom, then, prepared for him by a perspiring Lascar, the Major-General stepped.  At the time Draycott did not know he was a Major-General: he was just a supreme being resplendent in a green silk dressing-gown.  The door closed, only to open again at once.  \"I have forgotten my sponge,\" he announced.  \"I shall not be a moment.\" He gazed directly at Draycott, who bowed, choking slightly.  It was inconceivable to imagine that the resplendent one thought he might--to put it in the vulgar tongue--pinch his bath.  By nature he was a timorous individual, and that green dressing-gown--ye gods! perish the thought.  It was while he waited humbly that the catastrophe occurred.  Advancing magnificently came a second being, still more resplendent, in a purple dressing-gown; and he was complete, with towel, sponge, and soap.  His eye would have impaled a London taxi-driver, and, scenting trouble, the Lascar made himself scarce.  \"It is preposterous to keep people waiting in this manner,\" he boomed; \"perfectly monstrous.\"  The next moment the door was shut and bolted, and Draycott followed the Lascar's example--just in time: green dressing-gown was returning with his sponge.  In official parlance, a general action seemed imminent. . . .  It opened with the crash of heavy artillery in the shape of strange and loud expletives of an Indian nature, to be followed immediately by an attack in force on the hostile position.  This resulted in a sanguinary repulse, and the attacking party hopped round, apparently in pain, nursing a stubbed toe.  The temporary set-back, however, seemed only to raise the _morale_ of the force; and after a further heavy bombardment of a similar nature to the one before, a succession of blows were delivered in rapid succession at all points along the front, which suddenly gave way and the victor was precipitated in some confusion, but triumphant, upon the floor of the captured position.  How true it is, that great utterance of our hand-books on war!  \"Every leader must bear in mind the necessity of immediately consolidating a newly won position, in order to resist the counter-attack of the enemy, which sooner or later is bound to be launched.\"  In this case it was distinctly sooner.  With a loud shout the defending troops arose from a recumbent position--to wit, the bath--and with deadly accuracy launched the contents of a large bucket of hot water upon the still prostrate foe.  \"What is the meaning of this monstrous intrusion?\"  The battle cry of the purples rang through the quivering air.  \"You s'scoundrel! you impudent s'scoundrel!\"  With a loud spluttering noise the greens got up and assumed a belligerent attitude.  \"You m'miserable villain! that is _my_ bath. How d'dare you--how d'dare you--throw w'water over me.  D'do you know what I am, sir?  I am a Major-General, sir, and I shall report your infamous c'conduct to the captain.\"  \"And I, sir,\" howled his opponent, \"will have you put in irons; I will have you chained to the crow's-nest, if they have one on board. Keel-hauled, sir, amongst the barnacles and things.  I, sir, I am a Lieutenant-General.\"  Draycott was still slightly dazed when he landed in Malta.   IX  Thus did he reach the Half Way House on his journey to the Land; and at that Half Way House he was destined to remain for a short space.  It may be that there is a harder school than forced inaction; if so, I have no desire to become a pupil.  \"Those are your orders; there is nothing more to be said.\"  Only too true; there _is_ nothing more to be said--but thinking is a different matter. . . .  And what brush can paint the indescribable longing of those who were fitted for it, who were trained in its ways, to get to their goal--to get to the Land of Promise.  For it was a Land of Promise; it was the land of the regular soldier's dreams.  And in those days there was no thought of the dream becoming a nightmare. . . .  So Clive Draycott and those with him, in that little rocky outpost of Empire, carried on as cheerfully as a wet sirocco wind and an ever-present heart-burning to be in France would allow, and waited for deliverance.  Perhaps they suffered more acutely than even those who were in the Great Retreat.  Out of it, as they thought, out of it.  Would they ever be able to hold up their heads again?  And then the worst thing of all: that awful day when the news came through--the news which England got one Sunday.  Fellows kept it from the men as far as they could; they covered up places on the map with their hand, unostentatiously; and when they had found Compiègne they folded the map up, and told the men everything was well.  It was that evening that Draycott and a pal watched the sun go down over Gozo from St. Paul's Bay, where the statue stands in the sea, and the shallow blue water ripples against the"]]]
