McNEILE  Author of   \"Men, Women, and Guns,\"   \"Sergeant Michael Cassidy, R.E.,\" and   \"The Lieutenant and Others\"        Hodder and Stoughton London ---- New York ---- Toronto MCMXVII     TO  THE INFANTRYMAN     PREFACE   During the first few days of November 1914 Messines was lost--in silence; during the first few days of June 1917 Messines was regained--and the noise of its capture was heard in London.  And during the two and a half years between these two events the game over the water has been going on.  It hasn't changed very much in the time--that game--to the player.  To those who look on, doubtless, the difference is enormous.  Now they speak easily of millions where before they thought diffidently of thousands.  But to the individual--well, Messines is lost or Messines is won; and he is the performer.  It is of those performers that I write: of the hole-and-corner work, of the little thumb-nail sketches which go to make up the big battle panels so ably depicted over the matutinal bacon and eggs.  And as one privileged to assist at times in that hole-and-corner work, I offer these pages as a small tribute to those who have done so far more than I: to the men who have borne the burden of the days, the months, the years--to the men who have saved the world--to the Infantrymen.

Every one knew it was coming, and yet--it was all so impossible, so incredible. I remember Clive Draycott looking foolishly at his recall telegram in the club--he had just come home on leave from Egypt--and then brandishing it in front of my nose.  \"My dear old boy,\" he remarked peevishly, \"it's out of the question. I'm shooting on the 12th.\"  But he crossed the next day to Boulogne.  It was a Sunday morning, and Folkestone looked just the same as it always did look.  Down by the Pavilion Hotel the usual crowd of Knuts in very tight trousers and very yellow shoes, with suits most obviously bought off the peg, wandered about with ladies of striking aspect. Occasional snatches of conversation, stray gems of wit, scintillated through the tranquil August air, and came familiarly to the ears of a party of some half-dozen men who stood by a pile of baggage at the entrance to the hotel.  \"Go hon, Bill; you hare a caution, not 'arf.\"  A shrill girlish giggle, a playful jerk of the \"caution's\" arm, a deprecating noise from his manly lips, which may have been caused by bashfulness at the compliment, or more probably by the unconsumed portion of the morning Woodbine, and the couple moved out of hearing.  \"I wonder,\" said a voice from the group, \"if we are looking on the passing of the breed.\"  He was a tall, thin, spare fellow, the man who spoke; and amongst other labels on his baggage was one marked Khartoum.  His hands were sinewy and his face was bronzed, while his eyes, brown and deep-set, held in them the glint of the desert places of the earth: the mark of the jungle where birds flit through the shadows like bars of glorious colour; the mark of the swamp where the ague mists lie dank and stagnant in the rays of the morning sun.  No one answered his remark; it seemed unnecessary, and each was busy with his own thoughts.  What did the next few days hold in store for the world, for England, for him?  The ghastly, haunting fear that possibly they held nothing for England gnawed at men's hearts.  It would be incredible, inconceivable; but impossible things had happened before.  Many must have felt that fear, but to none can it have been quite so personal, so hideously personal, as to the officers of the old Army and the Navy.  To them it was as if their own honour were at stake, and I can see now a man opposite me almost sobbing with the fury and the shame of it when for a while we thought--the worst.  But that was later.   \"Time to go on board, gentlemen.\"  Almost as beings from another world, they passed through the noisy throng, so utterly inconsequent, so absolutely ignorant and careless. One cannot help wondering now just how that throng has answered the great call; how many lie in nameless graves, with the remnants of Ypres standing sentinel to their last sleep; how many have fought and cursed and killed in the mud-holes of the Somme; how many have chosen the other path, and even though they had no skill and aptitude to recommend them, are earning now their three and four pounds a week making munitions.  But they _have_ answered the call, that throng and others like them; they _have_ learned out of the book of life and death; and perhaps the tall man with the bronzed face might find the answer to his question could he see England to-day.  Only he lies somewhere between Fletre and Meteren, and beside him are twenty men of his battalion.  He took it in the fighting before the first battle of Ypres . . .  \"I call it a bit steep.\"  A man in the Indian Cavalry broke the silence of the group who were leaning over the side watching the coast fade away.  \"In England two days after three years of it, and now here we are again.  But the sun being over the yard-arm--what say you?\"  With one last final look at the blue line astern, with one last involuntary thought--\"Is it _au revoir_, or is it good-bye?\"--they went below.  The sun was indeed over the yard-arm, and the steward was a hospitable lad of cosmopolitan instincts. . . .   II  \"It is impossible to _guarantee_ a ticket to Marseilles.\"  So the ticket vendor at Folkestone had informed them, and his pessimism was justified by future events.  The fun began at the Gare du Nord.  From what I have since learned, I have often wished since that my mission in life had been to drive a fiacre in Paris during the early days of August '14.  A taxi conjures up visions too wonderful to contemplate; but even with the humble horse-bus I feel that I should now be able to afford a piano, or whatever it is the multi-millionaire munition-man buys without a quiver.  I might even get the missus a fur coat.  Every living soul in Paris seemed obsessed with the idea of going somewhere else; and the chances of the stranger within their gates approached those of an icicle in Hades, as our friends across the water would say.  Finally, in despair, Draycott rushed into the road and seized a venerable flea-bitten grey that was ambling along with Monsieur, Madame, and all the little olive-branches sitting solemnly inside the cab.  He embraced Madame, he embraced the olive-branches; finally--in despair--I believe he embraced Monsieur.  He wept, he entreated, he implored them to take him to the Gare de Lyon.  It was imperative.  He would continue to kiss them without cessation and in turn, if only they would take him and his belongings to the Gare de Lyon.  He murmured: \"Anglais--officier anglais\"; he wailed the mystic word, \"Mobilisation.\"  Several people who were watching thought he was acting for the cinematograph, and applauded loudly; others were convinced he was mad, and called for the police.  But Monsieur--God bless him!--and Madame--God bless her!--and all the little olive-branches--God bless them!--decided in his favour; and having piled two suit-cases and a portmanteau upon that creaking cab, he plunged into the family circle.  It was very hot; he was very hot; they were very hot; and though Draycott confesses that he has done that familiar journey between the two stations in greater comfort, he affirms that never has he done it with a greater sense of elation and triumph.  The boat train to Marseilles, he reflected complacently; if possible a bath first; anyway, a sleeper, a comfortable dinner, and----  \"Parbleu, M'sieur; la Gare de Lyon c'est fermée.\" Madame's voice cut into his reflections.  As in a dream he extricated himself from to-night's supper and three sticky children, and gazed at the station.  They were standing six deep around the steps--a gesticulating, excited mob; while at the top, by the iron railings, a cordon of soldiers kept them back.  Inside, between the railings and the station, there was no one save an odd officer or two who strolled about, smoking and talking.  Mechanically he removed his baggage and dumped it in the road; mechanically he re-kissed the entire party; he says he even kissed the flea-bitten grey.  Then he sat down on a suit-case and thought.  It was perfectly true: the Gare de Lyon was shut to all civilians; the first shadow of war had come.  As if drawn by a magnet the old men were there, the men who remembered the last time when the Prussian swine had stamped their way across the fields of France.  Their eyes were bright, their shoulders thrown back as they glanced appraisingly at the next generation--their sons who would wipe out Sedan for ever from the pages of history.  There was something grimly pathetic and grimly inspiring in the presence of those old soldiers: the men who had failed through no fault of their own.  \"Not again,\" they seemed to say; \"for God's sake, not a second time. This time--Victory.  Wipe it out--that stain.\"  They had failed, true; but there were others who would succeed; and it was their presence that made one feel the unconquerable spirit of France."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23874"],["title","No Man's Land (#1)"],["body","The French officer in charge was polite, but firmly non-committal.  \"There is a train which will leave here about midnight, we hope.  If you can get a seat on it--well and good.  If not----\" he shrugged his shoulders superbly, and the conversation closed.  It was a troop train apparently, and in the course of time it would arrive at Marseilles--perhaps.  It would not be comfortable.  \"Mais, que voulez-vous, M'sieur? c'est la guerre.\"  At first he had not been genial; but when he had grasped the fact that mufti invariably cloaked the British officer, _en permission_, he had become more friendly.  He advised dinner; in these days, as he truly remarked, one never knows.  Also, what was England going to do?  \"Fight,\" Draycott answered promptly, with an assurance he did not feel. \"Fight, mon Colonel; ça va sans dire.\"  \"C'est bien,\" he murmured, and stood up.  \"Vive l'Angleterre.\"  Gravely he saluted, and Draycott took off his hat.  \"Mon Colonel, vive la France.\"  They shook hands; and having once again solemnly saluted one another, he took the Frenchman's advice and went in search of dinner.  In the restaurant itself everything seemed normal.  To the close observer there was possibly an undue proportion of women who did not eat, but who watched with hungry, loving eyes the men who were with them.  Now and again one would look round, and in her face was the pitiful look of the hunted animal; then _he_ would speak, and with a smile on her lips and a jest on her tongue she would cover a heart that seemed like to burst with the agony of it.  Inexorably the clock moved on: the finger of fate that was to take him from her.  They had quarrelled, _sans doute_--who has not? there had been days when they had not spoken.  He had not been to her all that he might have been, but . . .  But--he was her man.  And now he was going; in half an hour her Pierre was going to leave her.  For him the bustle and glamour of the unknown; for her--the empty chair, the lonely house, and her thoughts.  Dear God! but war is a bad thing for the women who stop behind. . . .  And on Draycott's brain a tableau is stamped indelibly, just a little tableau he saw that night in the restaurant of the Gare de Lyon.  They came, the three of them, up the flight of steps from the seething station below, into the peace and quiet of the room, and a roar of sound swept in with them as the doors swung open.  Threading their way between the tables, they stopped just opposite to where he sat, and instinctively he turned his head away.  For her the half-hour was over, her Pierre had gone; and it is not given to a man to look on a woman's grief save with a catching in the throat and a pricking in the eyes. It is so utterly terrible in its overwhelming agony at the moment, so absolutely final; one feels so helpless.  The little boy clambered on to a chair and sat watching his mother gravely; a grey-haired woman with anxious eyes held one of her hands clasped tight.  And the girl--she was just a girl, that's all--sat dry-eyed and rigid, staring, staring, while every now and then she seemed to whisper something through lips that hardly moved.  \"Maman,\" a childish voice piped out.  \"Maman.\"  He solemnly extended a small and grubby hand towards her.  Slowly her head came round, her eyes took him in--almost uncomprehendingly; she saw the childish face, the little dirty hand, and suddenly there came to her the great gift of the Healer.  \"Oh! mon bébé, mon pauv' p'tit bébé!\"  She picked him up off the chair and, clutching him in her arms, put her face on his head and sobbed out her heart.  \"Come on.\"  Draycott got up suddenly and turned to the man he was dining with.  \"Let's go.\"  They passed close to the table, and the fat waiter, wiping his eyes on a dinner napkin, and the grey-haired woman leaning gently over her, were talking in low tones.  They seemed satisfied as they watched the sobbing girl; and they were people of understanding.  \"Pauvre petite,\" muttered the waiter as they passed. \"Mon Dieu! quelle vâche de guerre.\"  \"My God!\" said Draycott, as they went down the steps.  \"I didn't realise before what war meant to a woman.  And we shall never realise what it means to our own women.  We only see them before we go.  Never after.\"   IV  Half an hour later he encountered Monsieur le Colonel once again, and suggested that they should split a bottle of wine together if he could spare the time.  It was then nine o'clock, and the three hours till midnight loomed uninviting.  His only hope, as he told him, was that the train at present standing at the platform was not going to be typical of the one he was to embark on.  It seemed to be of endless length, and presented a most enticing spectacle.  Four fortunates in each compartment had got the racks, otherwise the passengers stood: on the footboards, in the corridors, on the seats.  If any one opened a door the pressure was such that at least six people fell on to the platform, and in one carriage a small _poilu_ was being squeezed through the open window.  In the end he went--suddenly like a cork out of a bottle, and the human mass closed up behind him.  Draycott laughed, the Colonel laughed, and went on laughing.  He laughed unrestrainedly, even as a man who enjoys a secret jest.  At last, with some difficulty, he controlled his mirth.  \"Monsieur,\" he remarked gravely, but with twinkling eyes, \"I fear your hopes are ill-founded.  This is the midnight train.\"  \"Under those circumstances,\" Draycott murmured, with a ghastly attempt at mirth, \"the wine is off.  I must go and secure my sleeping-berth.\"  Have you ever seen a fly-paper which has come \"to the end of a perfect day\"?  Lumps of glutinous flies drop off on one's head, and still it seems as full as ever.  It was the same with that train.  Lumps of Frenchmen, permanently welded together, fell out periodically, unstuck themselves, and departed, only to return in a few moments with the long thin loaves of France and bottles of wine.  Sometimes they got in again, sometimes they didn't--but they were happy, those poilus.  What matter anything, bar killing the Boche?  And that was the only thing in the air that night. . . .  In every carriage it was the same, until suddenly there came salvation. A horse-box, with two horses in it and some grooms singing the Marseillaise, loomed out of the darkness, and into it the fed-up wanderer hurled his bag.  Yet again did he embrace every one, including the horses; and then, overcome with his labours, he sank into a corner and laughed.  And it was only when they had been under way for two hours that he remembered his two other bags, sitting alone and forlorn at the Gare de Lyon. . . .  It was a great journey that.  The heat was sweltering, and they stopped at every station between Paris and Marseilles--generally twice, because the train was too long for the platform.  And at every station the same programme was repeated.  Completely regardless of the infuriated whistles and toots of the French conductors, absolutely unmindful of the agonised shouts of \"En voiture, en voiture!  Montez, messieurs, le train part,\" the human freight unloaded itself and made merry.  As far as they were concerned, let the train \"part.\"  It never did, and the immediate necessity was the inner man.  But it was all very nerve-racking.  At times there were forty Frenchmen in the truck, at others none. Whether they fell off or were pushed Draycott knew not: they simply occurred--periodically.  One man disappeared for five hours, and then came back again; possibly he was walking to stretch his legs; there was plenty of time.  But to those who travel in trains de luxe, let me recommend a journey in a cattle-truck, where, if one is lucky, one gets a front seat, and sits on the floor with legs dangling over the side; a bottle of wine in one hand, a loaf of bread in the other, and a song when the spirit is in one.  No breathless rushing through space: just a gentle amble through the ripening corn, with the poppies glinting red and the purple mountains in the distance; with a three days' growth on one's chin and an amalgamation of engine soots and dust on one's face that would give a dust storm off the desert points and a beating.  That is the way to travel, even if the journey lasts from Sunday night to Tuesday evening, and a horse occasionally stamps on your face.  And even so did Clive Draycott, Captain of \"Feet,\" go to the great war. . . .   V  Marseilles has always been a town of mystery--the gateway of the East. Going from it one leaves European civilisation--if such a thing can be said to exist to-day--and steps into the unknown.  Coming to it through that appalling Gulf of Lyons, beside which the dreaded Bay of Biscay seems like the proverbial duck-pond, Notre Dame de la Garde holds out a welcoming hand, and breathes of fast trains and restaurant cars, and London.  It is the town of tongues, the city of nations.  It is not French; it is universal.  And never can Marseilles have been so universal as in the early days of August 1914.  Usually a port of call only, then it was a terminus.  The ships came in, but did not leave: there seemed to be a concensus of opinion amongst skippers that the _Goeben_ was a nasty thing to meet alone on a dark night.  And so the overcrowded docks filled up with waiting vessels, while Lascars and Levantine Greeks, Cingalese and Chinamen, jostled one another in the cafés.  The other jostlers were principally Americans of fabulous wealth: at least as they thronged the shipping offices they said so.  Also they were very angry, which is where they differed from the Cingalese and Chinamen, who liked Marseilles and prayed to remain for ever.  But the Americans desired to return to God's own country--they and their wives and their sons and daughters; moreover, they expressed their desire fluently and frequently.  There is something stupendous about an American magnate insisting on his rights on a hot day, when he can't get them. . . "]]]
