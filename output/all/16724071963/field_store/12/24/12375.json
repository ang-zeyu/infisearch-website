It is as follows:      \"At a special meeting of the 'Maryland Society for Promoting the     Abolition of Slavery and the Relief of Free Negroes and others     Unlawfully held in Bondage,' held at Baltimore, July 4, 1791,     unanimously      \"_Resolved_, That the president present the thanks of the Society     to Dr. George Buchanan, for the excellent oration by him delivered     this day, and, at the same time, request a copy thereof in the     name and for the use of the Society.      \"Signed--Samuel Sterett, President; Alex. McKim, Vice-President;     Joseph Townsend, Secretary.\"  The oration has this dedication:      \"To the Honorable Thomas Jefferson, Esq., Secretary of State,     whose patriotism since the American Revolution has been uniformly     marked by a sincere, steady, and active attachment to the interest     of his country, and whose literary abilities have distinguished     him amongst the first of statesmen and philosophers--this oration     is respectfully inscribed, as an humble testimony of the highest     regard and esteem, by the Author.\"  The author was evidently a straight Democrat.  Seven years ago I copied this oration with the intention of reprinting it, with a brief historical introduction, supposing I could readily find the few facts I needed. But in this I was disappointed. Who was Dr. George Buchanan? That he was a member of the American Philosophical Society at Philadelphia was apparent on the title page; but that was all I could learn of him from books or inquiry. I then wrote to a historical friend in Baltimore to make inquiry for me there, and I received letters from the author's son, McKean Buchanan, senior paymaster in the United Stares navy, since deceased, and from two grandsons, Mr. George B. Coale and Dr. Wm. Edw. Coale, giving full particulars, which I will condense:  Dr. George Buchanan was born on an estate, five miles from Baltimore, September 19, 1763, and for many years was a practicing physician in Baltimore. He was a son of Andrew Buchanan, who was also born in Maryland, and was General in the Continental troops of Maryland during the Revolution, and was one of the Commissioners who located the city of Baltimore. Dr. George Buchanan studied medicine and took a degree at Philadelphia. He then went to Europe and studied medicine at Edinburgh, and later at Paris, taking degrees at both places. Returning to Baltimore, he married Letitia, daughter of the Hon. Thomas McKean, an eminent jurist, who was a member of the Continental Congress, one of the Signers the Declaration of Independence, and was Governor of Pennsylvania from 1799 to 1806. In 1806, Dr. Buchanan removed to Philadelphia, and died the next year of yellow fever, in the discharge of his official duties as Lazaretto physician. His eldest son was Paymaster McKean Buchanan, before mentioned. His youngest son was Franklin Buchanan, captain in the United States navy till he resigned, April 19, 1861, and went into the so-called Confederate navy. He was, with the rank of Admiral, in command of the iron-clad \"Merrimac,\" and was wounded in the conflict of that vessel with the monitor \"Ericsson,\" at Hampton Roads, March 9, 1862, and was later captured by Admiral Farragut in Mobile harbor.  \"My brother,\" writes one of the grandsons, \"told me that the last time he saw Henry Clay, Mr. Clay took his hand in both of his and said, with great emphasis: 'It is to your grandfather that I owe my present position with regard to slavery. It was he who first pointed out to me the curse it entailed on the white man, and the manifold evils it brings with it.'\"  In determining how far the sentiments contained in this oration were the current opinions of the time, it became necessary for me to know something definite of the \"Maryland Society for the Abolition of Slavery,\" of the Virginia, the Pennsylvania, and other societies, which existed at that time. This information I could not obtain from anti-slavery books, or from the most prominent abolitionists whom I consulted. The matter seemed to have been forgotten, and it was the common idea that there was nothing worth remembering of the anti-slavery movement before 1830, when Mr. Garrison and his radical friends came upon the stage in Boston. For the want of the facts I needed, I laid aside the idea of reproducing the tract. The subject was brought again to mind by hearing the excellent paper, by Mr. S. E. Wright, our secretary, on the anti-slavery labors of Benjamin Lundy, which he read to this Club, a few months ago. The labors of Mr. Lundy began in 1816, and ended with his death in 1839. Quite recently I have obtained much of the information I needed.  Among the unknown facts to which I could get no clue at the time I have mentioned, were the names of the \"Virginia Calculator\" and the \"Physician of New Orleans,\" whom Dr. Buchanan mentions with Phillis Wheatley, Ignatius Sancho, and Banneker, the Maryland astronomer, as being negroes who were distinguished for their literary and mathematical acquirements. Mr. Phillips had never heard of them, and he took the trouble to make inquiries among his anti-slavery friends, but without success.  A year or more after I had abandoned my little project, in looking over the files of the Columbian Centinal, printed in Boston, for 1790, I found under the date of December 29th, in the column of deaths, the following:      \"DIED--Negro Tom, the famous African calculator, aged 80 years. He     was the property of Mrs. Elizabeth Cox, of Alexandria. Tom was a     very black man. He was brought to this country at the age of     fourteen, and was sold as a slave with many of his unfortunate     countrymen. This man was a prodigy. Though he could neither read     nor write, he had perfectly acquired the use of enumeration. He     could give the number of months, days, weeks, hours, and seconds,     for any period of time that a person chose to mention, allowing in     his calculations for all the leap years that happened in the     time. He would give the number of poles, yards, feet, inches, and     barley-corns in a given distance--say, the diameter of the earth's     orbit--and in every calculation he would produce the true answer     in less time than ninety-nine out of a hundred men would take with     their pens. And what was, perhaps, more extraordinary, though     interrupted in the progress of his calculations, and engaged in     discourse upon any other subject, his operations were not thereby     in the least deranged; he would go on where he left off, and could     give any and all of the stages through which the calculation had     passed.      \"Thus died Negro Tom, this untaught arithmetician, this untutored     scholar. Had his opportunities of improvement been equal to those     of thousands of his fellow-men, neither the Royal Society of     London, the Academy of Science at Paris, nor even a Newton himself     need have been ashamed to acknowledge him a brother in science.\"  This obituary was doubtless extracted from a Southern newspaper. A fact once found is easily found again. I have come across the name of this unlettered negro prodigy many times since, with the substance of the facts already stated. In a letter which Dr. Benj. Rush, of Philadelphia, addressed to a gentleman in Manchester, England, he says that, hearing of the astonishing powers of Negro Tom, he, in company with other gentlemen passing through Virginia, sent for him. A gentleman of the company asked Tom how many seconds a man of seventy years, some odd months, weeks, and days had lived. He told the exact number in a minute and a half. The gentleman took a pen, and having made the calculation by figures, told the negro that he must be mistaken, as the number was too great. \"'Top, massa,\" said the negro \"you hab left out de leap years.\" On including the leap years in the calculation, the number given by the negro was found to be correct.[4]  That Dr. Buchanan did not mention his name is explained by the fact that he died only six months before; and the audience, who had doubtless read the obituary notice just recited, or a similar one, knew who was meant. Besides, he was a native African, and had no name worth having. He was only Negro Tom. In Bishop Gr√©goire's work, however, he is ennobled by the by the name of Thomas Fuller, and in Mr. Needles' Memoir the name of Thomas Tuller.[5]  Why Dr. Buchanan should have omitted to mention the name of \"the New Orleans physician\" does not appear, unless it be that he was equally well known. His name, I have found recently, was James Derham. Dr. Rush, in the American Museum for January, 1789, gave an account of Dr. Derham, who was then a practitioner of medicine at New Orleans, and, at the time the notice was written, was visiting in Philadelphia. He was twenty-six years of age, married, member of the Episcopal Church, and having a professional income of three thousand dollars a year. He was born in Philadelphia a slave, and was taught to read and write, and occasionally to compound medicines for his master, who was a physician. On the death of his master he was sold to the surgeon of the Sixteenth British regiment, and at the close of the war was sold to Dr. Robert Dove, of New Orleans, who employed him as an assistant in his business. He manifested such capacity, and so won the confidence and friendship of his master, that he was liberated on easy terms after two or three years' service, and entered into practice for himself. \"I have conversed with him,\" says Dr. Rush, \"upon most of the acute and epidemic diseases of the country where he lives. I expected to have suggested some new medicines to him, but he suggested many more to me. He is very modest and engaging in his manners. He speaks French fluently, and has some knowledge of the Spanish.\"[6]  It was unfortunate that"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23956"],["title","Anti-Slavery Opinions before the Year 1800 (#3)"],["body","incidents had not occurred early enough to have come to the knowledge of Mr. Jefferson before he wrote his \"Notes on Virginia.\" These were precisely the kind of facts he was in quest of. He probably would have used them, and have strengthened the opinions he there expressed as to the intellectual capacity of the negro race.  His \"Notes on Virginia\" were written in 1781-2. His condemnation of slavery in that work is most emphatic. \"The whole commerce between master and slave,\" he says, \"is a perpetual exercise of the most boisterous passions; the most unremitting despotism on the one part, and degrading submission on the other. Our children see this and learn to imitate it.... The parent storms, the child looks on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves, gives loose to his worst of passions; and thus nursed, educated, and daily exercised in tyranny, can not but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and morals undepraved by such circumstances. With what execration should the statesman be loaded, who, permitting one-half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other, transforms those into despots and these into enemies--destroys the morals of the one part, and the _amor patri√¶_ of the other?... Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their only firm basis--a conviction in the minds of men that these liberties are the gift of God; that they are not to be violated but with His wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country, when I reflect that God is just--that His justice can not sleep forever.\" Pp. 270-272, ed. Lond., 1787.  On the practical question, \"What shall be done about it?\" Mr. Jefferson's mind wavered; he was in doubt. How can slavery be abolished? He proposed, in Virginia, a law, which was rejected, making all free who were born after the passage of the act. And here again he hesitated. What will become of these people after they are free? What are their capacities? He had never seen an educated negro. He had heard of Phillis Wheatley and Ignatius Sancho. He did not highly estimate the poetry of the one, or the sentimental letters of the other. He was willing to admit, however, that a negro could write poetry and sentimental letters. Beyond this all was in doubt. He regarded it as highly probable that they could do nothing more. He says: \"Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid\"--p. 232. He doubtingly adds: \"The opinion that they are inferior in the faculties of reason and imagination must be hazarded with great diffidence. To justify a general conclusion requires many observations\"--p. 238. The opportunity for making these observations he had never had.  It so happened that soon after writing this, Banneker, the Maryland negro astronomer, who had distinguished himself in the very faculty of mathematical reasoning which Mr. Jefferson had supposed no negro possessed, sent him his Almanac, with a letter. To the letter Mr. Jefferson replied as follows:      \"I thank you sincerely for your letter of the 19th instant, and     for the Almanac it contained. Nobody wishes more than I do to see     such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black     brethren talents equal to those of other colors of men, and that     the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded     condition of their existence, both in Africa and America. I can     add with truth, that nobody wishes more ardently to see a good     system commenced for raising the condition, both of their body and     mind, to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their     present existence, and other circumstances which can not be     neglected, will admit. I have taken the liberty of sending your     Almanac to Monsieur de Condorcet, Secretary of the Academy of     Sciences at Paris, and member of the Philanthropic Society,     because I consider it a document to which your color had a right     for their justification against the doubts which have been     entertained of them. I am, with great esteem, sir, your most     obedient, humble servant,                                           \"THOS. JEFFERSON.\"[7]  The next instances of precocious black men which must have come to his knowledge were, doubtless, Negro Tom, in whom the mathematical faculty was strangely developed, and James Derham, the New Orleans physician. If Mr. Jefferson had rewritten his \"Notes,\" he would, probably, have included mathematics and medicine among the special subjects which were peculiarly adapted to the capacities of the negro mind.  It was not the question of the natural rights of the negro, the prejudice of color, nor of the ruinous improvidence of the system of slavery, that controlled the decision in Mr. Jefferson's mind, as to the methods by which the system should be terminated. On these points, he was as radical as the extremest abolitionist; but he could not satisfy himself as to the mental capacity of the negro--whether he had the full complement of human capabilities, and the qualifications for equality of citizenship with the white man; for he saw that emancipation, without expatriation, meant nothing else than giving the black man all the rights of citizenship. The theory that the negro is a decaudalized ape, a progressing chimpanzee, is an invention of the last forty years, and contemporaneous with the discovery that the Bible sanctions slavery. He was, on the whole, inclined to the opinion that they were an inferior race of beings, and that their residence, in a state of freedom, among white men was incompatible with the happiness of both. He thought they had better be emancipated, and sent out of the country. He therefore took up with the colonization scheme long before the Colonization Society was founded. He did not feel sure on this point. With his practical mind, he could not see how a half million of slaves could be sent out of the country, even if they were voluntarily liberated;[8] where they should be sent to, or how unwilling masters could be compelled to liberate their slaves. While, therefore, he did not favor immediate emancipation, he was zealous for no other scheme.  Bishop Gr√©goire, of Paris, felt deeply hurt at Mr. Jefferson's low estimate of the negro's mental capacity, and wrote to him a sharp letter on the subject. Later, the Bishop sent a copy of his own book on the Literature of Negroes.[9] Acknowledging the receipt of the Bishop's book, Mr. Jefferson says:      \"Be assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I do,     to see a complete refutation of the doubts I have myself     entertained and expressed on the grade and understanding allotted     to them by nature, and to find that, in this respect, they are on     a par with ourselves. My doubts were the result of personal     observation on the limited sphere of my own State, where the     opportunities for the development of their genius were not     favorable, and those of exercising it still less so. I expressed     them, therefore, with great hesitation; but whatever be their     degree of talent, it is no measure of their rights. Because Sir     Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not     therefore lord of the person and property of others. On this     subject they are gaining daily in the opinions of nations, and     hopeful advances are making toward their re-establishment on an     equal footing with other colors of the human family. I pray you,     therefore, to accept my thanks for the many instances you have     enabled me to observe of respectable intelligence in that race of     men, which can not fail to have effect in hastening the day of     their relief.\" Works, v, p. 429.  Writing to another person a few months later, he alludes to this letter and says: \"As to Bishop Gr√©goire, I wrote him a very soft answer. It was impossible for a doubt to be more tenderly or hesitatingly expressed than it was in the Notes on Virginia; and nothing was, or is, further from my intentions than to enlist myself as a champion of a fixed opinion, where I have only expressed a doubt.\" Works, v, p. 476.  Mr. Jefferson never got beyond his doubt; and Bishop Gr√©goire resented his passive position by omitting Mr. Jefferson's name from a list of fourteen Americans, which included Mr. Madison, William Pinkney, Dr. Benj. Rush, Timothy Dwight, Col. Humphreys, and Joel Barlow, to whom, with other philanthropists, he dedicated his book.  Washington, Madison, Patrick Henry, George Mason, and nearly all the public men of Virginia and Maryland of that period were in much the same state of mind as Jefferson.[10] So was Henry Clay at a later period.  Mr. Jefferson, in August, 1785, wrote a letter to Dr. Richard Price, of London, author of a treatise on Liberty, in which very advanced opinions were taken on the slavery question. Concerning the prevalence of anti-slavery opinions at that period, he says: \"Southward of the Chesapeake your book will find but few readers concurring with it in sentiment on the subject of slavery. From the mouth to the head of the Chesapeake, the bulk of the people will approve its theory, and it will find a respectable minority, a minority ready to adopt it in practice; which, for weight and worth of character, preponderates against the greater number who have not the courage to divest their families of a property which, however, keeps their consciences unquiet. Northward of the Chesapeake you may find, here and there, an opponent to your doctrine, as you find, here and there, a robber and murderer, but in no greater number. In that part of America there are but few slaves, and they can easily disincumber themselves of them; and emancipation"]]]
