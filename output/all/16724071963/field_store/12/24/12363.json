By rubbing a little paint, such as carmine or indigo, in some water and placing a drop upon the glass slide with the Melicerta, these currents may be readily seen; and I have more than once seen rows of coloured bricks, red or blue, which the animal moulded and then deposited on the tube! We will take the bottle home, and if you have patience I doubt not I shall be able to show you a good deal of what I have been describing; but you must have patience, for, as an excellent naturalist has said, \"The Melicerta is an awkward object to undertake to show to our friends, for, as they knock at the door, she is apt to turn sulky, and when once in this mood it is impossible to say when her fair form will reappear. At times the head is wagged about in all directions with considerable vehemence, playing singular antics, and distorting her lobes so as to exhibit a Punch and Judy profile.\"[B]  Hark! what is that bird singing so sweetly and with such animation in the hedge? Do you hear? It is the dear little sedge-warbler; often, indeed, heard, but not so often seen, for it is fond of hiding itself in bushes or sedges. The sedge-warbler, like the migratory warblers generally, comes to us in April and leaves us in September. How often have I listened with delight to its music when returning home quite late at night in summer months! If the bird stops its music for a few moments, you have only to throw a stone among the bushes and the singing commences again. I am not clever in describing musical sounds, and I cannot describe that of the sedge-warbler, nor can I always distinguish it from the song of its near relative the reed-warbler. Both imitate the songs of other birds, and their incessant warblings and babblings at night cause them to be often mistaken for nightingales. I have generally found the nest of the sedge-warbler on the ground, on a tuft of coarse grass or sedge; the nest of the reed-warbler is supported on four or five tall reeds, and is made of the seed-branches of the reeds and long grass wound round and round; it is made deep, so that the little eggs are not tossed out when the reeds are shaken by the high winds.  [Illustration: NEST OF REED WARBLER.]  Hark! there is the cuckoo; how clearly he utters \"cuckoo! cuckoo!\" He is not far away. Some people can imitate the well-known note so well as to deceive the bird and bring it near the place where they are hiding. Your Uncle Philip only the other day made a cuckoo respond to him; had the day been calm instead of windy, he would, no doubt, have induced the bird to come close to us. There he goes with his long tail, flying something like a hawk. You should remember the rhyming lines about the cuckoo's visit to this country:      In April,     Come he will.     In May,     He sings all day.     In June,     He alters his tune.     In July,     He prepares to fly.     Come August,     Go he must.  \"I think you said, papa,\" said May, \"that it is only the male bird that utters the cuckoo note; what kind of a voice has the female?\" I have never heard the note of the female cuckoo. Mr. Jenyns says, \"The note of the female cuckoo is so unlike that of the male, which is familiar to every one, that persons are sometimes with difficulty persuaded that it proceeds from that bird. It is a kind of chattering cry, consisting of a few notes uttered fast in succession, but remarkably clear and liquid.\" Very curious are the habits of the cuckoo. Unlike most other birds, they do not pair; you all know, too, that cuckoos make no nests, but lay their eggs one by one in the nests of various other birds, such as those of the hedge-warbler, or hedge-sparrow as it is generally but wrongly called, robin, white-throat, and other birds. It is probable that the same cuckoo does not go twice to the same nest to deposit her egg. What a curious exception is the case of the cuckoo to the instinctive love of their offspring observable in almost all birds! After the eggs are laid the parent bird has no further trouble with them; no period of incubation to bare the breast of the brooding bird; no anxiety about her young ones, as some idle, wanton lad hunts amongst the trees and bushes, destroys both nest and eggs, or tortures the helpless fledglings! \"But, papa,\" said Willy, \"how does it happen that the young birds hatched in the same nest with the young cuckoo always get turned out of it.\" The cuckoo, being much the larger and heavier bird, fills up the greater part of the nest, consequently the smaller fledgling companions get placed on the sides of the nest, and partially also on the back of the young cuckoo; when, therefore, the latter stands up in the nest he often lifts up on his back one of the small companions, who thus gets thrown headlong to the ground. This seems to me to be the mode in which the ejection sometimes takes place, till at last the young cuckoo is left sole possessor of the nest, and of course gets all the food; at the same time I ought to say that some naturalists attribute a murderous disposition to the young cuckoo, and say that the other inmates of the nest are maliciously thrown out. Others, again, say that the foster birds throw their own young ones out. It is certain that the young are sometimes treated thus, for they have been seen on the ground when the young cuckoo was too small to eject them itself.  [Illustration: CUCKOO.]  \"But why do not cuckoos make nests and sit on their eggs like other birds?\" said Jack. Such a question is more easily asked than answered; nevertheless I hope you will always try to discover reasons for things. \"It is now,\" writes a celebrated naturalist, \"commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the cuckoo's instinct is, that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at intervals of two or three days; so that if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest. If this were the case the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as she has to migrate at a very early period, and the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone.\" The cuckoos come to this country about the middle of April; the male birds arrive before the females. Whether this arrangement is ungallant conduct on the part of the gentlemen birds, who prefer to come alone, or whether, just when the gentleman cuckoo is ready and almost impatient for a start, her ladyship has all at once discovered some important matter that ought to be finished before leaving the country, some adjustment of her dress, some tiresome feather that will ruffle itself up in spite of every effort to keep it smooth, I know not, but the fact remains, that my Lord and Lady Cuckoo do not travel together. Let us suppose that both sexes have arrived in this country, we will say about the 23rd of April. It is natural they want a little time to look about them; at any rate, no egg is ready for being sat upon till some weeks after the arrival of the birds, say the 15th of May. The eggs require fourteen days' setting before they are hatched; this brings the date to the 29th of May. The young ones will require three weeks in the nest and constant feeding all the time; we now arrive at about the 20th of June, when the young ones would be ready to leave the nest. But they want five weeks' more feeding by the parents, after they leave the nest, before they are able to provide for themselves; this would bring the date to about the 25th of July, when there is hardly a parent bird in the country; they have left for other parts of the world. \"Oh! but, papa,\" said Willy, \"you said in the lines you told us to remember--      In July,     He prepares to fly.     Come August,     Go he must.  And now you say the cuckoos leave before the end of July. I think you must have made a mistake somehow.\" I am glad that you have found out the error, if it is one. Old rhymes are not always to be trusted; but I suspect that the couplet \"Come August, go he must,\" means to imply that the cuckoo does never really stay so late with us. I must not, however, forget to tell you that it is the old parent birds that leave us early; young birds remain till September, and even October, but they have not by that time acquired the cuckoo note. If you ask why cannot the old cuckoos stay with us a little longer, and then all go away together as a family party, young and old, in September, instead of being in such a hurry, I have only to say that it is the fashion amongst cuckoos, and of course cuckoos, like certain other animals, must be in the fashion. This is Dr. Jenner's explanation of the peculiar habits of the cuckoo in respect of its eggs. I am not prepared to say whether or not it is sufficient to explain them. The cuckoo's egg is very small when compared with the size of the bird; it is of a pale grey tinged with red.  \"But how does the cuckoo's egg get into some of the nests?\" asked Willy; \"for some of the nests in which the cuckoo's egg is found are too small to allow the cuckoo herself to enter to lay her egg.\" You are quite right; I believe it has been proved that the cuckoo lays her egg on the ground, and carries it in her bill into other birds' nests.  [Illustration: HORSE-TAIL.]  \"Oh! papa,\" said Jack, \"what is this curious plant that grows so abundantly on the grass here? I know it well by sight, but do not know its name.\" It is a spike of horse-tail; see how the stem is marked with lines, and how curiously jointed it is, and quite hollow except where the joints occur. The fruit is borne at the top of the plant (_a_); see, as I shake it, what a quantity of dust comes from it; this dust is the fruit, or spores as they are called; each spore is of an "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23942"],["title","Unborn Tomorrow (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]   UNBORN  TOMORROW  BY MACK REYNOLDS  Illustrated by Freas    _Unfortunately, there was only  one thing he could bring back  from the wonderful future ...  and though he didn't want to  ... nevertheless he did...._   Betty looked up from her magazine. She said mildly, \"You're late.\"  \"Don't yell at me, I feel awful,\" Simon told her. He sat down at his desk, passed his tongue over his teeth in distaste, groaned, fumbled in a drawer for the aspirin bottle.  He looked over at Betty and said, almost as though reciting, \"What I need is a vacation.\"  \"What,\" Betty said, \"are you going to use for money?\"  \"Providence,\" Simon told her whilst fiddling with the aspirin bottle, \"will provide.\"  \"Hm-m-m. But before providing vacations it'd be nice if Providence turned up a missing jewel deal, say. Something where you could deduce that actually the ruby ring had gone down the drain and was caught in the elbow. Something that would net about fifty dollars.\"  Simon said, mournful of tone, \"Fifty dollars? Why not make it five hundred?\"  \"I'm not selfish,\" Betty said. \"All I want is enough to pay me this week's salary.\"  \"Money,\" Simon said. \"When you took this job you said it was the romance that appealed to you.\"  \"Hm-m-m. I didn't know most sleuthing amounted to snooping around department stores to check on the clerks knocking down.\"  Simon said, enigmatically, \"Now it comes.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a knock.  Betty bounced up with Olympic agility and had the door swinging wide before the knocking was quite completed.  He was old, little and had bug eyes behind pince-nez glasses. His suit was cut in the style of yesteryear but when a suit costs two or three hundred dollars you still retain caste whatever the styling.  Simon said unenthusiastically, \"Good morning, Mr. Oyster.\" He indicated the client's chair. \"Sit down, sir.\"  The client fussed himself with Betty's assistance into the seat, bug-eyed Simon, said finally, \"You know my name, that's pretty good. Never saw you before in my life. Stop fussing with me, young lady. Your ad in the phone book says you'll investigate anything.\"  \"Anything,\" Simon said. \"Only one exception.\"  \"Excellent. Do you believe in time travel?\"  Simon said nothing. Across the room, where she had resumed her seat, Betty cleared her throat. When Simon continued to say nothing she ventured, \"Time travel is impossible.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Why?\"  \"Yes, why?\"  Betty looked to her boss for assistance. None was forthcoming. There ought to be some very quick, positive, definite answer. She said, \"Well, for one thing, paradox. Suppose you had a time machine and traveled back a hundred years or so and killed your own great-grandfather. Then how could you ever be born?\"  \"Confound it if I know,\" the little fellow growled. \"How?\"  Simon said, \"Let's get to the point, what you wanted to see me about.\"  \"I want to hire you to hunt me up some time travelers,\" the old boy said.  Betty was too far in now to maintain her proper role of silent secretary. \"Time travelers,\" she said, not very intelligently.  The potential client sat more erect, obviously with intent to hold the floor for a time. He removed the pince-nez glasses and pointed them at Betty. He said, \"Have you read much science fiction, Miss?\"  \"Some,\" Betty admitted.  \"Then you'll realize that there are a dozen explanations of the paradoxes of time travel. Every writer in the field worth his salt has explained them away. But to get on. It's my contention that within a century or so man will have solved the problems of immortality and eternal youth, and it's also my suspicion that he will eventually be able to travel in time. So convinced am I of these possibilities that I am willing to gamble a portion of my fortune to investigate the presence in our era of such time travelers.\"  Simon seemed incapable of carrying the ball this morning, so Betty said, \"But ... Mr. Oyster, if the future has developed time travel why don't we ever meet such travelers?\"  Simon put in a word. \"The usual explanation, Betty, is that they can't afford to allow the space-time continuum track to be altered. If, say, a time traveler returned to a period of twenty-five years ago and shot Hitler, then all subsequent history would be changed. In that case, the time traveler himself might never be born. They have to tread mighty carefully.\"  Mr. Oyster was pleased. \"I didn't expect you to be so well informed on the subject, young man.\"  Simon shrugged and fumbled again with the aspirin bottle.         *       *       *       *       *  Mr. Oyster went on. \"I've been considering the matter for some time and--\"  Simon held up a hand. \"There's no use prolonging this. As I understand it, you're an elderly gentleman with a considerable fortune and you realize that thus far nobody has succeeded in taking it with him.\"  Mr. Oyster returned his glasses to their perch, bug-eyed Simon, but then nodded.  Simon said, \"You want to hire me to find a time traveler and in some manner or other--any manner will do--exhort from him the secret of eternal life and youth, which you figure the future will have discovered. You're willing to pony up a part of this fortune of yours, if I can deliver a bona fide time traveler.\"  \"Right!\"  Betty had been looking from one to the other. Now she said, plaintively, \"But where are you going to find one of these characters--especially if they're interested in keeping hid?\"  The old boy was the center again. \"I told you I'd been considering it for some time. The _Oktoberfest_, that's where they'd be!\" He seemed elated.  Betty and Simon waited.  \"The _Oktoberfest_,\" he repeated. \"The greatest festival the world has ever seen, the carnival, _feria_, _fiesta_ to beat them all. Every year it's held in Munich. Makes the New Orleans Mardi gras look like a quilting party.\" He began to swing into the spirit of his description. \"It originally started in celebration of the wedding of some local prince a century and a half ago and the Bavarians had such a bang-up time they've been holding it every year since. The Munich breweries do up a special beer, _Marzenbräu_ they call it, and each brewery opens a tremendous tent on the fair grounds which will hold five thousand customers apiece. Millions of liters of beer are put away, hundreds of thousands of barbecued chickens, a small herd of oxen are roasted whole over spits, millions of pair of _weisswurst_, a very special sausage, millions upon millions of pretzels--\"  \"All right,\" Simon said. \"We'll accept it. The _Oktoberfest_ is one whale of a wingding.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Well,\" the old boy pursued, into his subject now, \"that's where they'd be, places like the _Oktoberfest_. For one thing, a time traveler wouldn't be conspicuous. At a festival like this somebody with a strange accent, or who didn't know exactly how to wear his clothes correctly, or was off the ordinary in any of a dozen other ways, wouldn't be noticed. You could be a four-armed space traveler from Mars, and you still wouldn't be conspicuous at the _Oktoberfest_. People would figure they had D.T.'s.\"  \"But why would a time traveler want to go to a--\" Betty began.  \"Why not! What better opportunity to study a people than when they are in their cups? If _you_ could go back a few thousand years, the things you would wish to see would be a Roman Triumph, perhaps the Rites of Dionysus, or one of Alexander's orgies. You wouldn't want to wander up and down the streets of, say, Athens while nothing was going on, particularly when you might be revealed as a suspicious character not being able to speak the language, not knowing how to wear the clothes and not familiar with the city's layout.\" He took a deep breath. \"No ma'am, you'd have to stick to some great event, both for the sake of actual interest and for protection against being unmasked.\"  The old boy wound it up. \"Well, that's the story. What are your rates? The _Oktoberfest_ starts on Friday and continues for sixteen days. You can take the plane to Munich, spend a week there and--\"  Simon was shaking his head. \"Not interested.\"  As soon as Betty had got her jaw back into place, she glared unbelievingly at him.  Mr. Oyster was taken aback himself. \"See here, young man, I realize this isn't an ordinary assignment, however, as I said, I am willing to risk a considerable portion of my fortune--\"  \"Sorry,\" Simon said. \"Can't be done.\"  \"A hundred dollars a day plus expenses,\" Mr. Oyster said quietly. \"I like the fact that you already seem to have some interest and knowledge of the matter. I liked the way you knew my name when I walked in the door; my picture doesn't appear often in the papers.\"  \"No go,\" Simon said, a sad quality in his voice.  \"A fifty thousand dollar bonus if you bring me a time traveler.\"  \"Out of the question,\" Simon said.  \"But _why_?\" Betty wailed.  \"Just for laughs,\" Simon told the two of them sourly, \"suppose I tell you a funny story. It goes like this:\"         *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *  I got a thousand dollars from Mr. Oyster (Simon began) in the way of an advance, and leaving him with Betty who was making out a receipt, I hustled back to the apartment and packed a bag. Hell, I'd wanted a vacation anyway, this was a natural. On the way to Idlewild I stopped off at the Germany Information Offices for some tourist literature.  It takes roughly three and a half hours to get to Gander from Idlewild. I spent the time planning the fun I was going to have.  It takes roughly seven and a half hours from Gander to Shannon and I spent that time dreaming up material I could put into my reports to Mr. Oyster. I was going to have to give him some kind of report for his money. Time travel yet! What a laugh!  Between Shannon and Munich a faint suspicion began to simmer in my mind. These statistics I read on the _Oktoberfest_ in the Munich tourist pamphlets. Five million people attended annually.  Where did five million people come from to "]]]
