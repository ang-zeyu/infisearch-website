You'll fight on your own, anyhow. So will we. If we joined up we could both fight better. I came to try to arrange so we'd both be stronger. We need you. You need us.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a pause. Patrolman Willis swallowed. At five-million-mile intervals, in a circle fifty million miles across with the Huk world as its center, objects floated in space. Patrolman Willis knew about them, because he and Sergeant Madden had put them there immediately after the missile rockets ceased to explode. He knew what they were, and his spine crawled at the thought of what would happen if the Huks found out. But the distant objects were at the limit of certain range for detection devices. The planet's instruments could just barely pick them up. They subtended so small a fraction of a thousandth of a second of arc that no information could be had about them.  But they acted like a monstrous space fleet, ready to pour down war-headed missiles in such numbers as to smother the planet in atomic flame. Patrolman Willis could not imagine admitting that such a supposed fleet needed another fleet to help it. A military man, bluffing as Sergeant Madden bluffed, would not have dared offer any terms less onerous than abject surrender. But Sergeant Madden was a cop. It was not his purpose to make anybody surrender. His job was, ultimately, to make them behave.  The Huks conferred. The conference was lengthy. The interpreter turned to Sergeant Madden and spoke with vast dignity and caginess:  \"When do you r-require an answer?\"  \"We don't,\" grunted Sergeant Madden. \"When you make up your minds, send a ship to Varenga III. We'll give you the information we've got. That's whether you fight with us or independent. You'll fight, once you meet these characters! We don't worry about that! Just ... we can do better together.\" Then he said: \"Have you got the co-ordinates for Varenga? I don't know what you call it in your language.\"  \"We have them,\" said the interpreter, still suspiciously.  \"Right!\" said Sergeant Madden. \"That's all. We came here to tell you this. Let us know when you make up your minds. Now we'll go back.\"  He turned as if to trudge back to the squad ship. And this, of course, was the moment when the difference between a military and a cop mind was greatest. A military man, with the defenses of the planet smashed--or exhausted--and an apparent overwhelming force behind him, would have tried to get the _Cerberus_ and its company turned over to him either by implied or explicit threats. Sergeant Madden did not mention them. But he had made it necessary for the Huks to do something.  They'd been shocked to numbness by the discovery that humans knew of their presence on Sirene IV. They'd been made aghast by the brisk and competent nullification of their eighty-gee rocket defenses. They'd been appalled by the appearance of a space fleet which--if it had been a space fleet--could have blasted the planet to a cinder. And then they were bewildered that the humans asked no submission--not even promises from them.  There was only one conclusion to be drawn. It was that if the humans were willing to be friendly, it would be a good idea to agree. Another idea followed. A grand gesture by Huks would be an even better idea.  \"Wait!\" said the interpreter. He turned. A momentary further discussion among the Huks. The interpreter turned back.  \"There is a ship here,\" he said uneasily. \"It is a human ship. There are humans in it. The ship is disabled.\"  Sergeant Madden affected surprise.  \"Yeah? How come?\"  \"It ar-rived two days ago,\" said the interpreter. Then he plunged. \"We br-rought it. We have a mine on what you call Pr-rocyron Three. The human ship landed, because it was disabled. It discovered our ship and our mine there. We wished to keep the mine secret. Because the humans had found out our secret, we br-rought them here. And the ship. It is disabled.\"  \"Hm-m-m,\" said Sergeant Madden. \"I'll send a repair-boat down to fix whatever's the matter with it. Of course you won't mind.\" He turned away, and turned back. \"One of the solar systems we'd like you to take over and defend,\" he observed, \"is Procyron. I haven't a list of the others, but when your ship comes over to Varenga it'll be ready. Talk our repair-boat down, will you? We'll appreciate anything you can do to help get the ship back out in space with its passengers, but our repair-boat can manage.\"  He waved his hand negligently and went back to the squad ship. He got in. Patrolman Willis followed him.  \"Take her up,\" said Sergeant Madden.  The squad ship fell toward the sky. Sergeant Madden said satisfiedly:  \"That went off pretty good. From now on it's just routine.\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a bubble in emptiness. It was a large bubble, as such things go. It was nearly a thousand feet in diameter, and it was made of multipoly plastic which is nearly as anomalous as its name. The bubble contained almost an ounce of helium. It had a three-inch small box at one point on its surface. It floated some twenty-five million miles from the Huk planet, and five million miles from another bubble which was its identical twin. It could reflect detector-pulses. In so doing it impersonated a giant fighting ship.  Something like an hour after the squad ship rose from Sirene IV, a detonator-cap exploded in the three-inch box. It tore the box to atoms and initiated a wave of disintegration in the plastic of the bubble. The helium bubble-content escaped and was lost. The plastic itself turned to gas and disappeared.  The bubble had been capable of exactly two actions. It could reflect detector-pulses. In doing so, it had impersonated a giant fighting ship, member of an irresistible fleet. It could also destroy itself. In so doing, it impersonated a giant fighting ship--one of a fleet--going into overdrive.  In rapid succession, all the bubbles which were members of a non-existent fighting fleet winked out of existence about Sirene IV. There were a great many of them, and no trace of any remained.  The last was long gone when a small salvage ship descended to the Huk home planet. A heavily accented voice talked it down.  The salvage ship landed amid evidences of cordiality. The Huks were extremely co-operative. They even supplied materials for the repair job on the _Cerberus_, including landing rockets to be used in case of need. But they weren't needed for take-off. The _Cerberus_ had been landed at a Huk spaceport, which obligingly lifted it out to space again when its drive had been replaced.         *       *       *       *       *  And the squad ship sped through emptiness at a not easily believable multiple of the speed of light. Sergeant Madden dozed, while Patrolman Willis performed such actions as were necessary for the progress of the ship. They were very few. But Patrolman Willis thought feverishly.  After a long time Sergeant Madden waked, and blinked, and looked benignly at Patrolman Willis.  \"You'll be back with your wife soon, Willis,\" he said encouragingly.  \"Yes, sir.\" Then the patrolman said explosively: \"Sergeant! There's nothing coming from the Coalsack way! There's nothing for the Huks to fight!\"  \"True, at the moment,\" admitted Sergeant Madden, \"but something could come. Not likely--But you see, Willis, the Huks have had armed forces for a long time. They've glamour. They're not ready to cut down and have only cops, like us humans. It wouldn't be reasonable to tell 'em the truth--that there's no need for their fighting men. They'd make a need! So they'll stand guard happily against some kind of monstrosities we'll have Special Cases invent for them. They'll stand guard zestful for years and years! Didn't they do the same against us? But now they're proud that even we humans, that they were scared of, ask them to help us. So presently they'll send some Huks over to go through the Police Academy, and then presently there'll be a sub-precinct station over there, with Huks in charge, and ... why ... that'll be that.\"  \"But they want planets--\"  Sergeant Madden shrugged.  \"There's plenty, Willis. The guess is six thousand million planets fit for humans in this galaxy. And by the time we've used them up, somebody'll have worked out a drive to take us to the next galaxy to start all over. There's no need to worry about that! And for immediate--does it occur to you how many men are going to start getting rich because there's a brand-new planet that's got a lot of things we humans would like to have, and wants to buy a lot of things the Huks haven't got?\"  Patrolman Willis subsided. But presently he said:  \"Sergeant ... what'd you have done if they hadn't told you about the _Cerberus_?\"  Sergeant Madden snorted.  \"It's unthinkable! We waltzed in there, and told them a tale, and showed every sign of walkin' right out again without askin' them a thing. They couldn't even tell us to go to hell, because it looked like we didn't care what they said. It was insupportable, Willis! Characters that make trouble, Willis, do it to feel important. And we'd left them without a thing to tell us that was important enough to mention--unless they told us about the _Cerberus_. We had 'em baffled. They needed to say something, and that was the only thing they could say!\"  He yawned.  \"The _Aldeb_ reports everybody on the _Cerberus_ safe and sound, only frightened, and the skipper said Timmy's girl was less scared than most. I'm pleased. Timmy's getting married, and I wouldn't want my grandchildren to have a scary mother!\"  He looked at the squad ship's instruments. There was a long way yet to travel.  \"A-h-h-h! It's a dull business this, overdrive,\" he said somnolently. \"And it's amazing how much a man can sleep when everything's in hand, and there's nothing ahead but a wedding and a few things like that. Just routine, Willis. Just routine!\"  He settled himself more"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23636"],["title","A Matter of Importance (#8)"],["body","as the squad ship went on home."]]]
