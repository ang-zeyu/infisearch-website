Up to 1846 the Mexican government had paid annual interest on some property administered by it but belonging to the Catholic church. Part of it was situated in what is now California. After 1848, when this California estate came under United States jurisdiction, Mexico refused to pay that part of the church outside of Mexico its share. This difference between our Government and Mexico the Hague Tribunal took up.  Agreeably to chapter 3, title 4, of the agreement, each party named two arbitrators, and the latter, acting together, an umpire. In case of an equality of votes a third power, designated by agreement of the parties, was to select the umpire. The arbitrators chosen were M. de Martens, of the Orthodox Greek church; Sir Edward Fry, an English Protestant; M. Asser, a Jew, and M. Savornin-Loman, a Dutch Protestant. Decision was reached within the prescribed thirty days and announced October 14, 1902. It favored the United States contention, giving its proportion of the Mexican payments to the Catholic church in California.   [Illustration] President Castro of Venezuela.   A second case, involving issues of war and peace, arose from the action of Great Britain and Germany against Venezuela in the winter of 1902-1903. Subjects of these as well as of  other powers had claims against Venezuela. That country was in financial straits and its creditors pressed. December 9, 1902, British and German war-ships sunk or seized some Venezuelan vessels; next day they landed marines at La Guayra, who took possession of the custom house; the 14th they bombarded and demolished a fort at Puerto Cabello. Through the good offices of the United States the matter of debts was referred to the Hague Tribunal. The German claims were decided by two representatives of Germany and two of Venezuela, or, if they disagreed, by an umpire whom the United States selected. So with the other claims. The tribunal fixed the order in which Venezuela should pay the different countries, and the United States was charged with overseeing the payments, a percentage of Venezuelan customs receipts being reserved for that purpose.  In 1903 Andrew Carnegie donated $1,500,000 for the purpose of erecting a \"palace of peace,\" the permanent head-quarters of this court. The deed of trust states: \"The establishment of a permanent Court of Arbitration by the treaty of the 29th of July, 1899, is the most important step forward, of a world-wide humanitarian character, that has ever been taken by the joint powers, as it must ultimately banish war, and further, being of opinion that the cause of peace will greatly benefit by the erection of a court house and library for the permanent Court of Arbitration,\" etc.   [Illustration] The new Peace Palace, The Hague, Holland.   The site of this building, which will be ready for occupancy in 1912, is near The Hague. Its exterior will resemble some of the old city walls to be seen in Holland. The various governments which were parties to the treaty have contributed materials for the completion of the interior and objects of art for decoration. The United States presented a large marble group of statuary called \"Peace Through Justice.\"  Two notable congresses were held in the United States during the year 1904, for the purpose of promoting the peace of the world. The Inter-Parliamentary Union held a meeting, the twelfth in its history, in connection with the World's Fair at St. Louis. This organization was founded at Paris in 1888 by thirty members of the French Chamber of Deputies and ten members of the British Parliament, for the purpose of promoting the cause of peace and arbitration. Scoffed at from the beginning, the Union continued to grow until it included parliamentary delegates from every European country having a constitutional form of government.  The meeting of the Union at St. Louis was the first to be held in the United States, for this country took no part in the organization until 1903. Russia and Turkey, having no parliaments, are not represented in the meetings of the Union. It is a noteworthy fact however that the Czar sent an official representative to the meeting in 1896 and that it was due to his report of that meeting, more than to any other cause, that the Czar invited the nations to send representatives to The Hague in 1898.   [Illustration: Ten men seated around a conference table.] Russian and Japanese Peace Envoys in session at Portsmouth, N. H.   In the congress at St. Louis, representatives from the deliberative bodies of fifteen nations were present. Among these delegates were some of the well-known public men from Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Belgium, The Netherlands, the United States, and various other countries. They were practical men and not dreamers.  Two important resolutions resulted from the gathering. One of these called upon the powers to intervene and put an end to the war between Russia and Japan. The other invited the President of the United States to call a second peace congress, similar to the Hague conference. The resolution, addressed to President Roosevelt, stated that there were a number of questions left unsettled from the first Hague conference and that new problems had arisen since that time which demanded readjustment, such as the use of wireless telegraphy in the time of war.  On October 3 of the same year an international peace congress was held in Boston. Numerous congresses of this nature have been held from time to time since the meeting of the first one in London in 1843. Since the year 1888, when a congress was held in Paris, an international peace congress has met each year with the exception of 1895, the year of the Boer war, and in 1898 and 1899, on account of the Spanish-American war. The first of these congresses in America was held in conjunction with the Columbian Exposition at Chicago, 1893. There were in attendance at Boston distinguished statesmen, clergymen, scholars, and professional men, and a number of noted women, representing the many peace and arbitration societies in Great Britain, Germany, Austria, and numerous other countries.  On the Sunday before the opening of the congress, special services were held in many of the Boston churches and the peace movement was discussed by distinguished preachers from Europe and America. In the deliberative sessions, which were held in Faneuil Hall, the Old South Meeting House, and other places, the first session being opened by an address by Secretary of State John Hay, the following topics, among others, were discussed: the work and influence of the Hague Tribunal; the reduction of the armaments of the nations; education and the peace sentiment. But here, as in every previous congress, the two topics to receive primary consideration have been arbitration and disarmament. At all times there has been the urgent appeal to the nations to abandon the brutality and injustice of war and to adopt the humane and just methods of peace.  In response to the resolution adopted at St. Louis, President Roosevelt, on October 20, 1904, invited the nations which had taken part in the first Hague conference to another conference at the same place. But in his message to Congress of that year he defined very clearly his own position, condemning in no uncertain terms the thought of peace at any price. \"There are kinds of peace,\" he said, \"which are highly undesirable, which are in the long run as destructive as any war. The peace of tyrannous terror, the peace of craven weakness, the peace of injustice--all these should be shunned as we shun unrighteous war.\"   [Illustration: Building appears to be a church.] Building where the second Peace Conference was held, The Hague, Holland.   Favorable replies to the invitation sent by President Roosevelt were received from all the nations. Russia, then in the midst of war with Japan, while approving, stipulated that the conference should not be called until the end of that war. When peace was restored, in the summer of 1905, Emperor Nicholas II issued an invitation to fifty-three nations to send representatives to such a conference. For the first time, nearly every independent nation on the globe was represented among the delegates in an international gathering of this nature. It met at The Hague during the summer of 1907.   [Illustration: About one hundred delegates.] First session of the second Peace Conference, The Hague, Holland.   Delegates from the United States were instructed to favor obligatory arbitration; the establishment of a permanent court of arbitration; the prohibition of force in the collection of contract debts; immunity from seizure of private property at sea; a clearer definition of the rights of neutrals, and the limitation of armaments.  While belief was reasserted by the conference that there should be the obligatory arbitration of all questions relating to treaties and international problems of a legal nature, the principle was not adopted, although thirty-two nations of the forty-five represented favored it.  The resolution adopted, which provided for the collection of contract debts, is as follows: \"In order to avoid between nations armed conflicts of a purely pecuniary origin arising from contractual debts claimed of the government of one country by the government of another country to be due to its nationals, the signatory powers agree not to have recourse to armed force for the collection of such contractual debts. However, this stipulation shall not be applicable when the debtor State refuses or leaves unanswered an offer to arbitrate; or, in case of acceptance, makes it impossible to formulate the terms of submission; or, after arbitration, fails to comply with the award rendered.\"  Provision was made for an international prize court, to which appeal might be made from the prize courts of the belligerent powers.

CHAD'S     CHAPTER I  Honor Introduces Herself   \"Any new girls?\"  It was Madge Summers who asked the question, seated on the right-hand corner of Maisie Talbot's bed, munching caramels. It was a very small bed, but at that moment it managed to accommodate no less than seven of Maisie's most particular friends, who were closely watching the progress of her unpacking, and discussing the latest school news, interspersed with remarks on her belongings.  Maisie extricated herself from the depths of her box, and handed a pile of stockings to Lettice, her younger sister.  \"What's the use of asking me?\" she replied. \"Our cab only drove up half an hour ago. I feel almost new myself yet.\"  \"So do I, and horribly in the blues too,\" said Pauline Reynolds. \"It's always a wrench to leave home. I'm perfectly miserable for at least three days at the beginning of each term. I feel as if----\"  \"Oh, don't all begin to expatiate about your feelings!\" broke in Chatty Burns. \"We know Pauline's symptoms only too well: the first day she shows aggressively red eyes and a damp pocket-handkerchief; the second day she writes lengthy letters home, begging to be allowed to return immediately and have lessons with a private governess; the third day she wanders about, trying to get sympathy from anyone who is weak-minded enough to listen to her, till in desperation somebody drags her into the playground, and makes her have a round at hockey. That cheers her up, and she begins to think life isn't quite such a desert. By the fourth morning she has recovered her spirits, and come to the conclusion that Chessington College is a very decent kind of place; and she begins to be alarmed lest her mother, on the strength of the pathetic letter, should have decided to let her leave at once, and should have already engaged a private governess.\"  \"You're most unsympathetic, Chatty!\" said Pauline, smiling in spite of herself. \"You don't know what it is to be home-sick.\"  \"I wouldn't parade such a woebegone face, whatever might be the depths of my misery,\" returned Chatty briskly.  \"I'm always glad to come back,\" declared Dorothy Arkwright. \"I like school. It's fun to meet everybody again, and arrange about cricket, and the Debating Society, and the Natural History Club. There's so much going on at St. Chad's.\"  \"No one has answered my question yet,\" remarked Madge Summers. \"Are there any new girls?\"  Chatty wriggled herself into a more comfortable position between Adeline Vaughan and Ruth Latimer.  \"I think there are about a dozen altogether. Vivian Holmes says there are four at St. Bride's, three at St. Aldwyth's, two at the School House, and two at St. Hilary's. I saw one of them arriving at the same time as I did, and Miss Cavendish was gushing over another in the library; and Marian Spencer has brought a sister--she introduced her to me just now.\"  \"But what about St. Chad's?\"  \"We've only one, I believe, though Flossie Taylor, the Hammond-Smiths' cousin, has moved here from St. Bride's. She was always destined for a Chaddite, you know, only there wasn't room for her till the Richardsons left.\"  \"She's no great acquisition,\" said Dorothy Arkwright. \"I hate girls to change their quarters. When once they start at a house, they ought to stick to it.\"  \"Well, she wants to be with her cousins, I suppose,\" put in Madge Summers. \"Who's our new girl?\"  \"I don't know. I haven't heard anything about her.\"  \"Perhaps she hasn't arrived yet.\"  \"Sh! Sh!\" said Pauline Reynolds, squeezing Madge's arm by way of remonstrance, and pointing to the closely-drawn curtains of the cubicle at the farther end of the room. \"She's here now.\"  \"Where?\"  \"There, you goose!\"  \"What has she shut herself up like that for?\"  \"How should I know?\"  \"Perhaps she's unpacking,\" suggested Dorothy Arkwright.  \"If she is, she'll finish it quicker than Lettice and I can,\" returned Maisie Talbot. \"Why can't you be hanging up some of those skirts, instead of sitting staring at me? Yes, this is a whole box of Edinburgh rock, but you shan't have a single piece, any of you, unless you get off my bed at once.\"  \"Poor old Maisie, don't grow excited!\" murmured Ruth Latimer, appropriating the box and handing it round, though no one attempted to move.  \"But look here! what about this new girl?\" persisted Madge. \"Hasn't anybody seen her?\"  \"No. She's been in there ever since she arrived.\"  \"Don't talk so loud; she'll hear you.\"  \"I don't care if she does.\"  \"I want to know what she's doing.\"  \"I can tell you, then,\" said Chatty Burns, in a whisper that was more audible by far than her ordinary voice.  \"What?\"  \"Crying! New girls always cry, and some old ones too, if you take Pauline as a specimen.\"  \"I'm not crying now!\" protested Pauline indignantly. \"And how can you tell that the new girl is?\"  \"I'm as certain as if I'd proved a proposition in Euclid. Why should she have drawn her curtains so closely? If she's not lying on her bed, with a clean pocket-handkerchief to her eyes, I'll give you six caramels in exchange for three peppermint creams!\"  \"Then you're just mistaken!\" cried a voice from the end cubicle. The chintz curtain was pulled aside, and out marched a figure with so jaunty an air as to banish utterly the idea of possible homesickness or tears.  It was a girl of about fifteen, a remarkably pretty girl (so her schoolmates decided, without an instant's hesitation), and rather out of the common. She had a clear, olive complexion, a lovely colour in her cheeks, a bewitching pair of dimples, and a perfect colt's mane of thick, curly, brown hair. Perhaps her nose was a little too tip-tilted, and her mouth a trifle too wide for absolute beauty; but she showed such a nice row of even, white teeth when she laughed that one could overlook the latter deficiency. Her eyes were beyond praise, large and grey, with a dark line round the iris, and shaded by long lashes; and they were so soft, and wistful, and winning, and yet so twinkling and full of fun, that they seemed as if they could compel admiration, and make friends with their first glance. The girl walked across the room in an easy, confident fashion, and stood, with a broad smile on her face, beaming at the seven others seated on Maisie's bed.  \"Why shouldn't I pull my curtains?\" she asked. \"If I'd been pulling faces, now, you might have had some cause for complaint. You look rather a nice set; I think I'm going to like you.\"  The girls were so surprised that they could only stare. It seemed reversing the usual order of things for a new-comer, who ought to be shy and confused, to be so absolutely and entirely self-possessed, and to pass judgment with such calm assurance upon these old members of St. Chad's, some of whom were already in their third year at Chessington College.  \"Perhaps I'd better introduce myself,\" continued the stranger. \"My name is Honor Fitzgerald, and I come from Kilmore, near Ballycroghan, in County Kerry.\"  \"Then you're Irish!\" gasped Chatty Burns.  \"Quite right. First class for geography! County Kerry is exactly in the bottom left-hand corner of the map of Ireland. It's a more hospitable place than this is. I've been here nearly two hours, and nobody has offered me any refreshments yet. I'm simply starving!\"  She looked so humorously and suggestively at the Edinburgh rock that Madge Summers promptly offered it to her, regardless of the fact that the box belonged to Maisie Talbot.  \"Come along here,\" said Ruth Latimer, trying to make a place for the new girl on the bed by pushing the others vigorously nearer the end.  \"No room unless I sit on your knee, while you get up and walk about,\" declared Honor. \"There! I knew you would!\" as Madge Summers fell with a crash on to the floor.      \"Seven little schoolgirls, eating sugar sticks;     One tumbled overboard, and then there were six!\"  \"Thank you. I think I prefer to 'take the chair', as"]]]
