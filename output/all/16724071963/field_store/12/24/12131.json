FORFEITS.--No man need consider that he forfeits dignity if he speaks with his whole heart: no woman need fear she forfeits her womanly attributes if she responds as her heart bids her respond. \"Perfect love casteth out fear\" is as true now as when the maxim was first given to the world.  3. TELLING THEIR LOVE.--The generality of the sex is love to be loved: how are they to know the fact that they {38} are loved unless they are told? To write a sensible love letter requires more talent than to solve, with your pen, a profound problem in philosophy. Lovers must not then expect much from each other's epistles.  4. CONFIDENTIAL.--Ladies and gentlemen who correspond with each other should never be guilty of exposing any of the contents of any letters written expressing confidence, attachment or love. The man who confides in a lady and honors her with his confidence should be treated with perfect security and respect, and those who delight in showing their confidential letters to others are unworthy, heartless and unsafe companions.  5. RETURN OF LETTERS.--If letters were written under circumstances which no longer exist and all confidential relations are at an end, then all letters should be promptly returned.  6. HOW TO BEGIN A LOVE LETTER.--How to begin a love letter has been no doubt the problem of lovers and suitors of all ages and nations. Fancy the youth of Young America with lifted pen, thinking how he shall address his beloved. Much depends upon this letter. What shall he say, and how shall he say it, is the great question. Perseverance, however, will solve the problem and determine results.  7. FORMS OF BEGINNING A LOVE LETTER.--Never say, \"My Dearest Nellie,\" \"My Adored Nellie,\" or \"My Darling Nellie,\" until Nellie has first called you \"My Dear,\" or has given you to understand that such familiar terms are permissible. As a rule a gentleman will never err if he says \"Dear Miss Nellie,\" and if the letters are cordially reciprocated the \"Miss\" may in time be omitted, or other familiar terms used instead. In addressing a widow \"Dear Madam,\" or, \"My Dear Madam,\" will be a proper form until sufficient intimacy will justify the use of other terms.  8. RESPECT.--A lady must always be treated with respectful delicacy, and a gentleman should never use the term \"Dear\" or \"My Dear\" under any circumstances unless he knows it is perfectly acceptable or a long and friendly acquaintance justifies it.  9. HOW TO FINISH A LETTER.--A letter will be suggested by the remarks on how to begin one. \"Yours respectfully,\" \"Yours truly,\" \"Yours sincerely,\" \"Yours affectionately,\" \"Yours ever affectionately,\" \"Yours most affectionately,\" \"Ever yours,\" \"Ever your own,\" or \"Yours,\" are all appropriate, each depending upon the beginning of the letter. It is difficult to see any phrase which could be added to them which would carry more meaning than they {39} contain. People can sign themselves \"adorers\" and such like, but they do so at the peril of good taste. It is not good that men or women \"worship\" each other--if they succeed in preserving reciprocal love and esteem they will have cause for great contentment.  10. PERMISSION.--No young man should ever write to a young lady any letter, formal or informal, unless he has first sought her permission to do so.  11. SPECIAL FORMS.--We give various forms or models of love letters to be _studied, not copied_. We have given no replies to the forms given, as every letter written will naturally suggest an answer. A careful study will be a great help to many who have not enjoyed the advantages of a literary education.

Reverend and Dear Sir:  Having seen an advertisment for a school mistress in the Daily Times, I have been recommended to offer myself as a candidate. Will you kindly favor me {40} with a testimonial as to my character, ability and conduct while at Boston Normal School? Should you consider that I am fitted for the position, you would confer a great favor on me if you would interest yourself in my behalf.                I remain, Reverend Sir,           Your most obedient and humble servant,                   LAURA B. NICHOLS.  _2.--Applying for a Position as a Teacher of Music._  Scotland, Conn., January 21st, 1894.  Madam:  Seeing your advertisement in The Clarion of to-day, I write to offer my services as a teacher of music in your family.  I am a graduate of the Peabody Institute, of Baltimore, where I was thoroughly instructed in instrumental and vocal music.  I refer by permission to Mrs. A. J. Davis, 1922 Walnut Street; Mrs. Franklin Hill, 2021 Spring Garden Street, and Mrs. William Murray, 1819 Spruce Street, in whose families I have given lessons.  Hoping that you may see fit to employ me, I am,            Very respectfully yours,                   NELLIE REYNOLDS.  _3.--Applying for a Situation as a Cook._  Charlton Place, September 8th, 1894.  Madam:  Having seen your advertisement for a cook in today's Times, I beg to offer myself for your place. I am a thorough cook. I can make clear soups, entrees, jellies, and all kinds of made dishes. I can bake, and am also used to a dairy. My wages are $4 per week, and I can give good reference from my last place, in which I lived for two years. I am thirty-three years of age.            I remain, Madam,               Yours very respectfully,                   MARY MOONEY.  _4.--Recommending a School Teacher._  Ottawa, Ill., February 10th, 1894.  Col. Geo. H. Haight, President Board of Trustees, etc.  Dear Sir: I take pleasure in recommending to your favorable consideration the application of Miss Hannah Alexander for the position of teacher in the public school at Weymouth. {41}  Miss Alexander is a graduate of the Davidson Seminary, and for the past year has taught a school in this place. My children have been among her pupils, and their progress has been entirely satisfactory to me.  Miss Alexander is a strict disciplinarian, an excellent teacher, and is thoroughly competent to conduct the school for which she applies.  Trusting that you may see fit to bestow upon her the appointment she seeks, I am,            Yours very respectfully,                   ALICE MILLER.  _5.--A Business Introduction._  Chicago., Ill., May 1st, 1894.  J. W. Brown, Earlville, Ill.  My Dear Sir: This will introduce to you Mr. William Channing, of this city, who visits Earlville on a matter of business, which he will explain to you in person. You can rely upon his statements, as he is a gentleman of high character, and should you be able to render him any assistance, it would be greatly appreciated by            Yours truly,                   HAIGHT LARABEE.  _6.--Introducing One Lady to Another._  Dundee, Tenn., May 5th, 1894.  Dear Mary:  Allow me to introduce to you my ever dear friend, Miss Nellie Reynolds, the bearer of this letter. You have heard me speak of her so often that you will know at once who she is. As I am sure you will be mutually pleased with each other, I have asked her to inform you of her presence in your city. Any attention you may show her will be highly appreciated by            Yours affectionately,                   LIZZIE EICHER.  _7.--To a Lady, Apologizing for a Broken Engagement._  Albany, N. Y., May 10th, 1894.  My Dear Miss Lee:  Permit me to explain my failure to keep my appointment with you this evening. I was on my way to your house, with the assurance of a pleasant evening, when unfortunately I was very unexpectedly called from home on very important business.  I regret my disappointment, but hope that the future may afford us many pleasant meetings.            Sincerely your friend,                   IRVING GOODRICH.  {42}  _8.--Form of an Excuse for a Pupil._  Thursday Morning, April 4th.  Mr. Bunnel:  You will please excuse William for non-attendance at school yesterday, as I was compelled to keep him at home to attend to a matter of business.                    MRS. A. SMITH.  _9.--Form of Letter Accompanying a Present._  Louisville, July 6, 1894.  My Dearest Nelly:  Many happy returns of the day. So fearful was I that it would escape your memory, that I thought I would send you this little trinket by way of reminder. I beg you to accept it and wear it for the sake of the giver. With love and best wishes.            Believe me ever, your sincere friend,                   CAROLINE COLLINS.  _10.--Returning Thanks for the Present._  Louisville, July 6, 1894.  Dear Mrs. Collins:  I am very much obliged to you for the handsome bracelet you have sent me. How kind and thoughtful it was of you to remember me on my birthday. I am sure I have every cause to bless the day, and did I forget it, I have many kind friends to remind me of it. Again thanking you for your present, which is far too beautiful for me, and also for your kind wishes.            Believe me, your most grateful                   BERTHA SMITH.  _11.--Congratulating a Friend Upon His Marriage._  Menton, N.Y., May 24th, 1894.  My Dear Everett:  I have to-day received the invitation to your wedding, and as I cannot be present at that happy event to offer my congratulations in person, I write.  I am heartily glad you are going to be married, and congratulate you upon the wisdom of your choice. You have won a noble as well as a beautiful woman, and one whose love will make you a happy man to your life's end. May God grant that trouble may not come near you, but should it be your lot, you will have a wife to whom you can look with confidence for comfort, and whose good sense and devotion to you will be your sure and unfailing support.  That you may both be very happy, and that your happiness may increase with your years, is the prayer of            Your Friend,                   FRANK HOWARD.  {43}  [Illustration:"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23609"],["title","Searchlights on Health: Light on Dark Corners (#7)"],["body","of Affection]  Any extravagant flattery should be avoided, both as tending to disgust those to whom it is addressed, as well as to degrade the writers, and to create suspicion as to their sincerity. The sentiments should spring from the tenderness of the heart, and, when faithfully and delicately expressed, will never be read without exciting sympathy or emotion in all hearts not absolutely deadened by insensibility.  {44}  [Illustration]  _FORMS OF LOVE LETTERS._  _12.--An Ardent Declaration._.  Naperville, Ill., June 10th, 1894.  My Dearest Laura:  I can no longer restrain myself from writing to you, dearest and best of girls, what I have often been on the point of saying to you. I love you so much that I cannot find words in which to express my feelings. I have loved you from the very first day we met, and always shall. Do you blame me because I write so freely? I should be unworthy of you if I did not tell you the whole truth. Oh, Laura, can you love me in return? I am sure I shall not be able to bear it if your answer is unfavorable. I will study your every wish if you will give me the right to do so. May I hope? Send just one kind word to your sincere friend,                HARRY SMITH.  _13.--A Lover's Good-bye Before Starting on a Journey._  Pearl St., New York, March 11th, 1894.  My Dearest Nellie: I am off to-morrow, and yet not altogether, for I leave my heart behind in your gentle keeping. You need not place a guard over it, however, for it is as impossible that it should stay away, as for a bit of steel {45} to rush from a magnet. The simile is eminently correct, for you, my dear girl, are a magnet, and my heart is as true to you as steel. I shall make my absence as brief as possible. Not a day, not an hour, not a minute, shall I waste either in going or returning. Oh, this business; but I won't complain, for we must have something for our hive besides honey--something that rhymes with it--and that we must have it, I must bestir myself. You will find me a faithful correspondent. Like the spider, I shall drop a line by (almost) every post; and mind, you must give me letter for letter. I can't give you credit. Your returns must be prompt and punctual.            Passionately yours,                   LEWIS SHUMAN.  To Miss Nellie Carter, No. ---- Fifth Avenue, New York.  _14.--From an Absent Lover._  Chicago, Ill., Sept. 10, 1894.  My Dearest Kate: This sheet of paper, though I should cover it with loving words, could never tell you truly how I long to see you again. Time does not run on with me now at the same pace as with other people; the hours seem days, the days weeks, while I am absent from you, and I have no faith in the accuracy of clocks and almanacs. Ah! if there were truth in clairvoyance, wouldn't I be with you at this moment! I wonder if you are as impatient to see me as I am to fly to you? Sometimes it seems as if I must leave business and everything else to the Fates, and take the first train to Dawson. However, the hours do move, though they don't appear to, and in a few more weeks we shall meet again. Let me hear from you as frequently as possible in the meantime. Tell me of your health, your amusements and your affections.  Remember that every word you write will be a comfort to me.            Unchangeably yours,                   WILLIAM MILLER.  To Miss Kate Martin, Dawson, N. D.  _15.--A Declaration of Love at First Sight_.  Waterford, Maine, May 8th, 1894.  Dear Miss Searles:  Although I have been in your society but once, the impression you have made upon me is so deep and powerful that I cannot forbear writing to you, in defiance of all rules of etiquette. Affection is sometimes of slow growth: {46} but sometimes it springs up in a moment. In half an hour after I was introduced to you my heart was no longer my own. I have not the assurance to suppose that I have been fortunate enough to create any interest in yours; but will you allow me to cultivate your acquaintance in the hope of being able to win your regard in the course of time? Petitioning for a few lines in reply,            I remain, dear Miss Searles,               Yours devotedly,                   E. C. NICKS.  Miss E. Searles, Waterford, Maine.  _16.--Proposing Marriage._  Wednesday, October 20th, 1894.  Dearest Etta:  The delightful hours I have passed in your society have left an impression on my mind that is altogether indelible, and cannot be effaced even by time itself. The frequent opportunities I have possessed, of observing the thousand acts of amiability and kindness which mark the daily tenor of your life, have ripened my feelings of affectionate regard into a passion at once ardent and sincere, until I have at length associated my hopes of future happiness with the idea of you as a life partner, in them. Believe me, dearest Etta, this is no puerile fancy, but the matured results of a long and warmly cherished admiration of your many charms of person and mind. It is love--pure, devoted love, and I feel confident that your knowledge of my character will lead you to ascribe my motives to their true source.  May I then implore you to consult your own heart, and should this avowal of my fervent and honorable passion for you be crowned with your acceptance and approval, to grant me permission to refer the matter to your parents. Anxiously awaiting your answer,            I am, dearest Etta,               Your sincere and faithful lover,                   GEO. COURTRIGHT.  To Miss Etta Jay, Malden, Ill.  {47}  _17.--From a Gentleman to a Widow._  Philadelphia, May 10th, 1894.  My Dear Mrs. Freeman:  I am sure you are too clear-sighted not to have observed the profound impression which your amiable qualities, intelligence and personal attractions have made upon my heart, and as you have not repelled my attentions nor manifested displeasure when I ventured to hint at the deep interest I felt in your welfare and happiness, I cannot help hoping that you will receive an explicit expression of my attachments, kindly and favorably. I wish it were in my power to clothe the feelings I entertain for you in such words as should make my pleadings irresistible; but, after all, what could I say, more than you are very dear to me, and that the most earnest desire of my soul is to have the privilege of calling you my wife? Do you, can you love me? You will not, I am certain, keep me in suspense, for you are too good and kind to trifle for a moment with sincerity like mine. Awaiting your answer,            I remain with respectful affection,               Ever yours,                   HENRY MURRAY.  Mrs. Julia Freeman, Philadelphia.  _18.--From a Lady to an Inconstant Lover._  Dear Harry:  It is with great reluctance that I enter upon a subject which has given me great pain, and upon which silence has become impossible if I would preserve my self-respect. You cannot but be aware that I have just reason for saying that you have much displeased me. You have apparently forgotten what is due to me, circumstanced as we are, thus far at least. You cannot suppose that I can tamely see you disregard my feelings, by conduct toward other ladies from which I should naturally have the right to expect you to abstain. I am not so vulgar a person as to be jealous. When there is cause to infer changed feelings, or unfaithfulness to promises of constancy, jealousy is not the remedy. What the remedy is I need not say--we both of us have it in our hands. I am sure you will agree with me that we must come to some understanding by which the future shall be governed. Neither you nor I can bear a divided allegiance. Believe me that I write more in sorrow than in anger. You have made me very unhappy, and perhaps thoughtlessly. But it will take much to reassure me of your unaltered regard.            Yours truly,               EMMA.         *       *       *       *       *   {48}  [Illustration: MODESTY.

[Illustration: THE HUMAN FACE, LIKE A FLOWER, SPEAKS FOR ITSELF.]  1. It takes acquaintance to found a noble esteem, but politeness prepares the way. Indeed, as Montaigne says, Courtesy begets esteem at sight. Urbanity is half of affability, and affability is a charm worth possessing.  2. A pleasing demeanor is often the scales by which the pagan weighs the Christian. It is not virtue, but virtue inspires it. There are circumstances in which it takes a great and strong soul to pass under the little yoke of courtesy, but it is a passport to a greater soul standard.  3. Matthew Arnold says, \"Conduct is three-fourths of character,\" and Christian benignity draws the line for conduct. A high sense of rectitude, a lowly soul, with a pure and kind {50} heart are elements of nobility which will work out in the life of a human being at home--everywhere. \"Private refinement makes public gentility.\"  4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your resentment. Remember that if you permit revenge or malice to occupy your soul, you are ruined.  5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish the blues; a cheerful saguine spirit begets cheer and hope.  6. Be trustworthy and be trustful.  7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good reading and good expression; they will yield perpetual interest.  8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in local occurrences, but abhor gossip, and above all scandal.  9. Banish a self-conscience spirit--the source of much awkwardness--with a constant aim to make others happy. Remember that it is incumbent upon gentlemen and ladies alike to be neat in habits.  10. The following is said to be a correct posture for walking. Head erect--not too rigid--chin in, shoulders back. Permit no unnecessary motion about the thighs. Do not lean over to one side in walking, standing or sitting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is deforming and therefore"]]]
