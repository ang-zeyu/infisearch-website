You have been naughty, Wally.\"  Nora exploded. \"We have not!\" she cried.  Lieutenant Delancey laughed like a stage villain. \"The law I mention,\" he said after a bit of belly-laughing, \"was passed long, long ago before telepathy and perception were available to provide the truth. At that time the law took the stand that any unmarried couple living together would take advantage of their unchaperoned freedom, and if this state of cohabitation went on for a considerable length of time--called 'Massive' but don't ask me to justify the term--the probability of their taking pleasure in one another's company approached a one hundred per cent positive probability.  \"Now this law was never amended by the Review Act. Hence the fact that you have been chastely occupying separate chambers has nothing to do with the letter of the law that says simply that it is not lawful for an unmarried couple to live under the same unchaperoned roof.\"  I came out of the shower toweling myself and manipulating a selection of clean clothing out of the closet in my bedroom.  \"The law,\" I observed, \"is administered by the _Intent_ of the Law, and not by the Letter, isn't it?\"  \"Oh, sure,\" he said. \"But I'm not qualified to interpret the law. I'll arrest you and bring you to trial and then it's up to some judge to rule upon your purity and innocence of criminal intent, and freedom from moral taint or turpitude. Maybe take weeks, you know.\"  \"And what's the alternative?\" I grunted.  \"Flight,\" he said in a sinister tone as I came out of my bedroom putting the last finishes on my necktie. \"Flight away from the jurisdiction of the law that proposes to warp the meaning of the law to accomplish its own ends.\"  \"And you?\"  \"My duty,\" he grinned, \"is to pursue you.\"  \"In which case,\" observed Nora Taylor, \"we might as well fly together and save both time and money.\"  \"That is why I have my personal sky-buggy all ready to go instead of requisitioning an official vehicle,\" he said. He scooped a fork full of eggs and said, \"You're a fool, Wally. The lady can cook.\"  I chuckled. \"And what would happen if I hauled off and married her?\"  \"You mean right here and now?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Sorry. I'd have to restrain you. You see, you couldn't get a legal license nor go through any of the other legal activities, ergo there would be a prima facie illegality about some part of the ceremony. Without being definite as to which phase, I would find it my duty to restrain you from indulging in any act the consummation of which would be illegal.\"  Nora said in pseudo-petulant tone, \"I've been damned with very faint praise.\"  \"How so?\"  \"Wally Wilson has just said that he'd rather marry me than go to the Kentucky Derby with you.\"  Lieutenant Delancey said, \"I urge you both to come along. You see, my box is also being occupied by an old friend of yours. I managed to talk him into joining us, and with reluctance he consented.\"  \"I'm a mind reader,\" I said. \"Our friend's name is Joseph Barcelona?\"  \"As they say on the space radio, 'Aye-firm, over and out!'\"         *       *       *       *       *  Barcelona was there with two of his boys. Watching them were four ununiformed officers. Nora and I and the lieutenant were joined later by Gimpy Gordon, who might have been radiating childlike wonder and a circus-air of excitement at actually being _at_ the Derby. He might have been. No one could cut through the constant, maddening mental blah-blah-blah that was being churned out by Barcelona's noisemakers.  He greeted me curtly, eyed Nora hungrily. He said: \"You look pretty confident, Wilson.\"  \"I can't lose,\" I said.  \"No? Frankly I don't see how you can win.\"  I smiled. \"Without mentioning any names, Joseph, I feel confident that the final outcome of this racing contest will be just as you want it to be. I shall ask that no credit be given me, although I shall be greatly admired by our mutual friend Miss Nora Taylor who will think that I am truly wonderful for making you happy. And it is more than likely that she may marry me once I have shown you, and she, _and_ Lieutenant Delancey, that I am a law-abiding citizen as well as a man who values friendship enough to do as his old pal Joe Barcelona desires.\"  \"It's going to be one of the neatest tricks of the week,\" he said.  \"It will be done by the proper application of laws,\" I said modestly.  Behind us, Gimpy Gordon light-fingered a half dollar out of Delancey's pocket and was attracting the attention of a hot dog peddler by waving his program. Some folks nearby were eying Barcelona's noisemakers angrily but making very little visible protest once they identified him. Nora was reading her program and underlining some horses. The whole place began to grow into a strange excited silence as the track board began to go up. It was to be a nine-horse race, and at the top of the list were three--count them--three odds-on favorites:   1. Murdoch's Hoard    1:2  2. Mewhu's Jet        3:5  3. Johnny Brack       5:7  4. Piper's Son        8:5  5. Daymare            3:1  6. Helen O'Loy        8:1  And then, of course, there were our three mud turtles which must have been entered by someone who thought that the Kentucky Derby was a claiming race and who hoped that the LePage's Glue people would make a bid for the three mounds of thoroughbred horseflesh that dropped dead in the backstretch:   7. Flying Heels     100:1  8. Moonbeam         250:1  9. Lady Grace       500:1  The rack hadn't hit the top of the slide before there was a sort of mass-movement towards the mutuel windows. The ones who didn't go in person tried to hurl betting-thoughts in the hope of getting there early and failing this they arose and followed the crowd. Slowly the odds began to change; the figures on our three platers began to rise. There was very little activity on the other six horses. Slow-thinking Gimpy Gordon started to get up but I put out a hand to stop him.  \"But the odds are dropping,\" he complained.  \"Gimpy,\" I said, \"they pay on the final listing anyway. But would you like a tip?\"  \"Sure,\" he said nervously.  \"My tip is to keep your cash in your pocket. Put it on the nose of some horse and it's likely to get blown away by a high wind.\"  The odds were changing rapidly. What with psionic information receivers, trend predictors and estimated anticipators, the mutuel computers kept up with the physical transfer of funds, figured out the latest odds, and flipped the figures as fast as the machinery could work the dials. In no more than a few minutes the odds on the three platers looked more like the odds on horses that stood a chance of winning.         *       *       *       *       *  Barcelona looked at me. \"What did you do, wise guy?\"  \"Who ... me? Why, I didn't do anything that you did not start--except that maybe I was a little more generous.\"  \"_Spiel!_\" he snarled.  \"Why, shucks, Joseph. All I did was to slip good old Gimpy Gordon a tip.\"  \"How much?\"  \"Just a lousy little thousand dollar bill.\"  \"A grand! For what, wise guy?\"  \"Why, just for telling me what horses you picked for the Derby.\"  Barcelona looked at the odds on his horses. Flying Heels had passed even money and was heading for a one-to-two odds-on. The other platers were following accordingly.  \"And what did you tell Gimpy, Wilson?\"  \"You tell him, Gimp,\" I said.  \"Why, Wilson just said that we should ride along with you, Mr. Barcelona, because you are such a nice guy that everybody works awfully hard to see that you get what you want.\"  \"There's more!\" roared Barcelona.  \"Only that I shouldn't mention it to anybody, and that I shouldn't place my bet until the mutuel windows open because if I did it would louse up the odds and make you unhappy.\" Gimpy looked at Barcelona's stormy face and he grew frightened. \"Honest, Mr. Barcelona, I didn't say a word to nobody. Not a word.\" He turned to me and whined plaintively, \"You tell him, Mr. Wilson. I didn't say a word.\"  I soothed him. \"We know you didn't, Gimpy.\"  Barcelona exploded. \"Ye Gods!\" he howled. \"They used that gimmick on me when I lost my first baby tooth. 'Don't put your tongue in the vacant place,' they said, 'and don't think of the words _Gold Tooth_ and it'll grow in natural gold!'\"  As he spoke the odds on Flying Heels changed from a staggering One-to-Eight to an even more staggering One-to-Ten. That meant that anybody holding less than a ten-dollar bet on such a winner would only get his own money back because the track does not insult its clients by weighing them down with coins in the form of small change. They keep the change and call it \"Breakage\" for any amount over an even-dollar money.  Delancey said to Barcelona, \"You have had it, Joseph.\"  Barcelona snarled, \"Put the big arm on Wilson here. He's the fast man with the big fix.\"  \"Wilson didn't fix any race, Joseph. He just parlayed some of the laws of human nature into a win for himself and a lose for you.\"  \"Now see here--what's this guff about human nature?\"  \"Well, there's the human desire to ride with a winner, and the human frailty that hopes to get something for nothing. To say nothing of the great human desire to be 'On the Inside' track or 'In the Know' so that they can bet on the 'Sure Thing'. And so,\" said Delancey, \"we've about twenty thousand human beings full of human nature holding tickets on your three dogs, Joseph. They bet their money because the 'Inside Dope' said that the big fix was in. And I can tell you that what twenty thousand people are going to do to this 'Inside Dope' when their nags run last is going to make Torquemada ask permission to return to life for a Second Inquisition, this time with extrasensory tortures.\" He turned to me as Barcelona went pale. \"Wally,\" he asked, \"want to bet that someone doesn't remember that old question of whether it is possible to break every bone in a man's body without killing him?\"  \"I'd be a fool to cover that one,\" I said. \"But I'll play even money and on"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23599"],["title","The Big Fix (#5)"],["body"," side of whether Joseph dies or lives through the process.\"  \"Stop it!\" screamed Barcelona. He grabbed me by the arm. \"Wilson,\" he pleaded, \"Can you? Stop it, I mean? Can you fix it?\"  \"Sure,\" I said.  \"Legally?\"  \"Yep. But it'll cost you.\"  \"Just money?\"  \"Just money--and admitting that you lost, Joseph!\"  \"I lose,\" he said. \"Go ahead!\"  \"O.K., Joseph. Now, let's be real honest. Those three longshore turtles belong to you, don't they?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"And right now you wouldn't even want to see them run, would you? In fact, you really want that they shouldn't run.\"  \"Yes.\"  \"All right, Joseph. Call off your noisemakers and toss the Head Steward a thought. Tell him you're scratching your entries.\"  \"But that won't stop the people from losing their money.\"  \"Natch. So next you broadcast a thought that because of this terrible, grievous error you are refunding their money out of your own pocket since the Track Association will not or is not obliged to.\"  He turned to his pair of rattleheads and snarled, \"All right. Shut up!\"  A mental silence fell that was like the peace of rest after a busy day. As Barcelona was tossing his cancellation at the Steward and preparing to make a full and plausible explanation to the gambling instinct of the Kentucky Derby crowd, I considered the matter carefully:  \"Let's see,\" I thought. \"He wants 'em not to run and so he can't complain to me if they do not. I didn't fix the race, so Lieutenant Delancey can't accuse me of that. That makes everybody happy, and I win!\"  A small hand stole into mine. \"How about me, Wally?\" Nora asked sweetly.  I looked down at a thionite dream come true by the glow in her eyes that admired no one else but me. \"You're mine,\" I reminded her, \"until Flying Heels, Moonbeam, and Lady Grace win One, Two, and Three at the Kentucky Derby.\"  \"Or,\" she said mischievously, \"'Til death do us part!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I was instructing her how to respond to a kiss as a lady should respond when about two hundred thousand noisy, exuberant human natures yelled and radiated and thought: \"They're Off!\"  But they didn't mean us. They were watching a bunch of long-faced hayburners chasing one another around a dusty track.  Human nature ain't changed a bit. It's just more complicated in an extrasensory sort of way.
