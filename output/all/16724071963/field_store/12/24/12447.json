He was the most beautiful prince that ever was born.  Being a prince, people said this; and it was true. When he looked at the candle, his eyes had an earnest expression quite startling in a new-born baby. His nose was aquiline; his complexion was healthy; he was round, fat, and straight-limbed--a splendid baby.  His father and mother, King and Queen of Nomansland, and their subjects were proud and happy, having waited ten years for an heir. The only person not quite happy was the king's brother, who would have been king had the baby not been born, but his Majesty was very kind to him, and gave him a Dukedom as large as a country.  The Prince's christening was to be a grand affair; there were chosen for him four and twenty godfathers and godmothers, who each had to give him a name, and promise to do their utmost for him. When he came of age, he himself had to choose the name--and the godfather or godmother--that he liked best.  All was rejoicing and the rich gave dinners and feasts for the poor.  The only quiet place in the Palace was the room, which though the prince was six weeks old, his mother, the Queen, had not quitted. Nobody thought she was ill as she said nothing about it herself, but lay pale and placid, giving no trouble to anybody.  Christening day came at last and it was as lovely as the Prince himself. All the people in the Palace were beautifully dressed in the clothes which the Queen had given them.  By six in the morning all the royal household had dressed itself in its very best; and then the little Prince was dressed in his magnificent christening robe; which he did not like at all, but kicked and screamed like any common baby. When he had calmed down, they carried him to the bed where the Queen lay.  She kissed and blessed him, and then she gave him up with a gentle smile, saying she \"hoped he would be very good, that it would be a very nice christening, and all the guests would enjoy themselves,\" and turned peacefully over on her bed. She was a very uncomplaining person--the Queen, and her name was Dolorez.  Everything went on as if she had been present. All, even the King himself, had grown used to her absence, for she was not strong, and for years had not joined in the gaieties. The noble company arrived from many countries; also the four-and-twenty godfathers and godmothers, who had been chosen with care, as the people who would be most useful to his Royal Highness should he ever want friends.  They came, walking two and two, with their coronets on their heads--dukes and duchesses, princes and princesses; they all kissed the child and pronounced the name which each had given him. Then the four-and-twenty names were shouted out, one after another, and written down, to be kept in the state records.  Everybody was satisfied except the little Prince, who moaned faintly under his christening robes, which nearly smothered him.  Though very few knew it, the Prince in coming to the chapel had met with an accident. A young lady of rank, whose duty it was to carry him to and from the chapel, had been so busy arranging her train with one hand, that she stumbled and let him fall. She picked him up--the accident was so slight it seemed hardly worth speaking of. The baby had turned pale, but did not cry. No one knew that anything was wrong. Even if he had moaned, the silver trumpets were loud enough to drown his voice. It would have been a pity to let anything trouble such a day.  Such a procession! Heralds in blue and silver; pages in crimson and gold; and a troop of little girls in dazzling white, carrying baskets of flowers, which they strewed all the way before the child and the nurse,--finally the four and twenty godfathers and godmothers, splendid to look at.  The prince was a mere heap of lace and muslin, and had it not been for a canopy of white satin and ostrich feathers, which was held over him whenever he was carried, his presence would have been unnoticed.  \"It is just like fairyland,\" said one little flower-girl to another, \"and I think the only thing the Prince wants now is a fairy godmother.\"  \"Does he?\" said a shrill, but soft and not unpleasant voice, and a person no larger than a child was seen.  She was a pleasant little, old, grey-haired, grey-eyed woman, dressed all in grey.  \"Take care and don't let the baby fall again.\"  The grand nurse started, flushing angrily.  \"Old woman, you will be kind enough not to say, 'the baby,' but 'the Prince.' Keep away; his Royal Highness is just going to sleep.\"  \"I must kiss him, I am his godmother.\"  \"You!\" cried the elegant lady-nurse.  \"You!!\" cried all the Court and the heralds began to blow the silver trumpets, to stop the conversation.  As the procession formed to return, the old woman stood on the topmost step, and stretched herself on tiptoe by the help of her stick, and gave the little Prince three kisses.  \"Take yourself out of the way,\" cried the nurse, \"or the king shall be informed immediately.\"  \"The King knows nothing of me,\" replied the old woman, with an indifferent air. \"My friend in the palace is the King's wife. I know her Majesty well, and I love her and her child. And since you dropped him on the marble stairs I choose to take him for my own. I am his godmother, ready to help him whenever he wants me.\"  \"You help him!\" cried the group laughing. The little old woman paid no attention and her soft grey eyes were fixed on the Prince, who smiled back at her.  \"His Majesty shall hear of this,\" said a gentleman-in-waiting.  \"His Majesty will hear quite enough news in a minute or two,\" said the old woman sadly, kissing the little Prince on the forehead. \"Be Prince Dolor, in memory of your mother Dolorez.\" Everybody started.  \"Old woman, you are exceedingly ill-bred,\" cried a lady-in-waiting. \"Even if you did know, how dared you presume to hint that her most gracious Majesty is called Dolorez?\"  \"Was called Dolorez,\" said the old woman with a tender solemnity.  The first gentleman, called the Gold-stick-in-waiting, raised the stick to strike her, and all the rest stretched out their hands to seize her; but the gray mantle melted from between their fingers; and there came a heavy, muffled sound.  The great bell of the palace--the bell which was only heard on the death of some of the Royal family, and for as many times as he or she was years old--began to toll. They listened. Some one counted: \"one-two-three-four\"--up to nine and twenty--just the Queen's age.  The Queen, her Majesty, was dead. In the midst of the festivities she had passed away. When the little prince was carried back to his mother's room, there was no mother to kiss him.  As for his godmother--the little old woman in grey, nobody knew what became of her.  [Illustration: \"I MUST KISS HIM, I AM HIS GODMOTHER.\" [PAGE 7.]]     CHAPTER II.   It could not be said that the Prince missed his mother; children of his age cannot do that; but somehow, after she died everything seemed to go wrong with him. From a beautiful baby he became pale and sickly, seeming to have almost ceased growing, especially in his legs, which had been so fat and strong. But after the day of his christening they withered, and when he was nearly a year old, and his nurse tried to make him stand, he only tumbled down.  This happened so many times that at last people began to talk about it. A prince, and not able to stand on his legs! What a misfortune to the country!  After a time he became stronger and his body grew, but his limbs remained shrunken. No one talked of this to the King, for he was very sad.  The King desired that the Prince should keep the name given him by the little old woman in grey and so he was known as Dolor.  Once a week, according to established state custom, the Prince, dressed in his very best, was brought to the King, his father, for half an hour, but his Majesty was too melancholy to pay much attention to the child.  Only once, when the King and his brother were sitting together, with Prince Dolor playing in a corner of the room, dragging himself about with his arms, rather than his legs, it seemed to strike the father that all was not right with his son.  \"How old is his Royal Highness?\" said he, suddenly, to the nurse.  \"Two years, three months, and five days, please your Majesty.\"  \"It does not please me,\" said the King with a sigh. \"He ought to be far more forward than he is. Is there not something wrong about him?\"  \"Oh, no,\" said the King's brother, exchanging meaning looks with the nurse. \"Nothing to make your Majesty at all uneasy. No doubt his Royal Highness will outgrow it in time.\"  \"Out-grow what?\"  \"A slight delicacy--ahem!--in the spine--something inherited, perhaps, from his dear mother.\"  \"Ah, she was always delicate; but she was the sweetest woman that ever lived. Come here, my little son.\"  The Prince turned to his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/24053"],["title","The Little Lame Prince (#1)"],["body","a small, sweet, grave face--like his mother's, and the King smiled and held out his arms. But when the boy came to him, not running like a boy, but wriggling awkwardly along the floor, the royal countenance clouded.  \"I ought to have been told of this. Send for all the doctors in my kingdom immediately.\"  They came, and agreed in what had been pretty well known before; that the prince must have been hurt when he was an infant. Did anybody remember?  No, nobody. Indignantly, all the nurses denied that any such accident had happened.  But of all this the King knew nothing, for, indeed, after the first shock of finding out that his son could not walk, and seemed never likely to walk, he interfered very little concerning him. He could not walk; his limbs were mere useless additions to his body, but the body itself was strong and sound, and his face was the same as ever--just like his mother's face, one of the sweetest in the world!  Even the King, indifferent as he was, sometimes looked at the little fellow with sad tenderness, noticing how cleverly he learned to crawl, and swing himself about by his arms, so that in his own awkward way he was as active as most children of his age.  \"Poor little man! he does his best, and he is not unhappy,\" said the King to his brother. \"I have appointed you as Regent. In case of my death, you will take care of my poor little boy?\"  Soon after he said this, the King died, as suddenly and quietly as the Queen had done, and Prince Dolor was left without either father or mother--as sad a thing as could happen, even to a Prince.  He was more than that now, though. He was a king. In Nomansland as in other countries, the people were struck with grief one day and revived the next. \"The king is dead--long live the king!\" was the cry that rang through the nation, and almost before his late Majesty had been laid beside the queen, crowds came thronging from all parts to the royal palace, eager to see the new monarch.  They did see him--sitting on the floor of the council-chamber, sucking his thumb! And when one of the gentlemen-in-waiting lifted him up and carried him to the chair of state, and put the crown on his head, he shook it off again, it was so heavy and uncomfortable. Sliding down to the foot of the throne, he began playing with the gold lions that supported it;--laughing as if he had at last found something to amuse him.  \"It is very unfortunate,\" said one of the lords. \"It is always bad for a nation when its king is a child; but such a child--a permanent cripple, if not worse.\"  \"Let us hope not worse,\" said another lord in a very hopeless tone, and looking towards the Regent, who stood erect and pretended to hear nothing. \"I have heard that these kind of children with very large heads and great broad foreheads and staring eyes, are--well, well, let us hope for the best and be prepared for the worst. In the meantime--\"  \"Come forth and kiss the hilt of his sword,\" said the Regent--\"I swear to perform my duties as Regent, to take care of his Majesty, and I shall do my humble best to govern the country.\"  Whenever the Regent and his sons appeared, they were received with shouts--\"Long live the Regent!\" \"Long live the Royal family!\"  As for the other child, his Royal Highness Prince Dolor--somehow people soon ceased to call him his Majesty, which seemed such a ridiculous title for a poor little fellow, a helpless cripple, with only head and trunk, and no legs to speak of--he was seen very seldom by anybody.  Sometimes people daring to peer over the high wall of the palace garden noticed there a pretty little crippled boy with large dreamy, thoughtful eyes, beneath the grave glance of which wrongdoers felt uneasy, and, although they did not know it then, the sight of him bearing his affliction made them better.  If anybody had said that Prince Dolor's uncle was cruel, he would have said that what he did was for the good of the country.  Therefore he went one day to the council-chamber, informed the ministers and the country that the young King was in failing health, and that it would be best to send him for a time to the Beautiful Mountains where his mother was born.  Soon after he obtained an order to send the King away--which was done in great state. The nation learned, without much surprise, that the poor little Prince--had fallen ill on the road and died within a few hours; so declared the physician in attendance, and the nurse who had been sent to take care of him. They brought the coffin back in great state, and buried him with his parents.  The country went into deep mourning for him, and then forgot him, and his uncle reigned in his stead.     CHAPTER III.   And what of the little lame prince, whom everybody seemed so easily to have forgotten?  Not everybody. There were a few kind souls, mothers of families, who had heard his sad story, and some servants about the palace, who had been familiar with his sweet ways--these many a time sighed and said, \"Poor Prince Dolor!\" Or, looking at the Beautiful Mountains, which were visible all over Nomansland, though few people ever visited them, \"Well, perhaps his Royal Highness is better where he is.\"  They did not know that beyond the mountains, between them and the sea, lay a tract of country, level, barren, except for a short stunted grass, and here and there a patch of tiny flowers. Not a bush--not a tree--not a resting place for bird or beast in that dreary plain. It was not a pleasant place to live.  The only sign that human creatures had ever been near the spot was a large round tower which rose up in the centre of the plain. In form it resembled the Irish round towers, which have puzzled people for so long, nobody being able to find out when, or by whom they were made. It was circular, of very firm brickwork, with neither doors nor windows, until near the top, when you could perceive some slits in the wall, through which one could not possibly creep in or look out. Its height was nearly a hundred feet.  The plain was desolate, like a desert, only without sand, and led to nowhere except the still more desolate sea-coast; nobody ever crossed it. Whatever mystery there was about the tower, it and the sky and the plain kept to themselves.  It was a very great secret indeed, a state secret, which none but so clever a man as the present king of Nomansland would ever have thought of. How he carried it out, undiscovered, I cannot tell. People said, long afterwards, that it was by means of a gang of condemned criminals, who were set to work, and executed immediately after they had done, so that nobody knew anything, or in the least suspected the real fact.  Within twenty feet of the top, some ingenious architect had planned a perfect little house, divided into four rooms. By making skylights, and a few slits in the walls for windows, and raising a peaked roof which was hidden by the parapet, here was a dwelling complete; eighty feet from the ground and hard to reach.  Inside it was furnished with all the comfort and elegance imaginable; with lots of books and toys, and everything that the heart of a child could desire.  One winter night, when all the plain was white with moonlight, there was seen crossing it, a great tall, black horse, ridden by a man also big and equally black, carrying before him on the saddle a woman and a child. The sad fierce-looking woman was a criminal under sentence of death, but her sentence had been changed. She was to inhabit the lonely tower with the child; she was to live as long as the child lived--no longer. This, in order that she might take the utmost care of him; for those who put him there were equally afraid of his dying and of his living. And yet he was only a little gentle boy, with a sweet smile. He was very tired with his long journey and was clinging to the man's neck, for he was rather frightened.  The tired little boy was Prince Dolor. He was not dead at all. His grand funeral had been a pretence; a wax figure having been put in his place, while he was spirited away by the condemned woman and the black man. The latter was deaf and dumb, so could tell nothing.  When they reached the foot of the tower, there was light enough to see a huge chain dangling half way from the parapet. The deaf mute took from his saddle-wallet a sort of ladder, arranged in pieces like a puzzle, fitted it together, and lifted it up to meet the chain. Then he mounted to the top of the tower, and slung from it a chair, in which the woman and child placed themselves and were drawn up, never to come down again. The man descended the ladder, took it to pieces and disappeared across the plain. Every month he came and fastened his horse to the foot of the tower and climbed it as before, laden with provisions and many other things. He always saw the Prince, so as to make sure that the child was alive and well, and then went away until the following month.  Prince Dolor had every luxury that even a Prince could need, and the one thing wanting--love, never having known, he did not miss. His nurse was very kind to him, though she was a wicked woman. Perhaps it made her better to be shut up with an innocent child.  By-and-by he began to learn lessons--not that his nurse had been ordered to teach him, but she did it partly to amuse herself. She was not a stupid woman, and Prince Dolor was by no means a stupid child; so they got on very well.  When he grew older he began reading the books which the mute brought to him. As they told him of the things in the outside world he longed to see them.  From this time a change came over the boy. He began to look sad and thin, and to shut himself up for hours without speaking. His nurse had been forbidden, on pain of death, to tell him anything about himself. He knew he was Prince Dolor, because she always addressed him as \"My prince\" and \"your Royal Highness,\" but what a prince was, he had not the least idea.  He had been reading one day, but feeling all the while that to read about"]]]
