But it was not even conceivable to rendezvous with a rescue ship in the emptiness between stars. So the _Cerberus_ had sent a message-torp and was crawling to a refuge-planet, more or less surveyed a hundred years before. There she would land by emergency rockets, because her drive couldn't take the strain. Once aground, the _Cerberus_ should wait for help. There was nothing else to be done. But everything was nicely in hand. The squad ship headed briskly for the planet Procyron III, and Sergeant Madden would take the data for a proper, official, emergency-call traffic report on the incident, and in time the _Aldeb_ would turn up and make emergency repairs and see the _Cerberus_ out to space again and headed for port once more.  This was absolutely all that there was to anticipate. Traffic handled such events as a matter of course. So Sergeant Madden dozed during most of the first day of overdrive. He reflected somnolently when awake that it was fitting for Timmy's father to be on the job when Timmy's girl was in difficulty, since Timmy was off somewhere else.  On the second day he conversed more or less with Patrolman Willis. Willis was a young cop, almost as young as Timmy. He took himself very seriously. When Sergeant Madden reached for the briefing-data, he found it disturbed. Willis had read up on the kind of ship the _Cerberus_ was, and on the characteristics of Procyron III as recorded a century before. The _Cerberus_ was a semi-freighter, Candless type. Procyron III was a water-planet with less than ten per cent of land. Which was unfortunate, because its average temperature and orbit made it highly suitable for human occupation. Had the ten per cent of solid ground been in one piece, it would doubtless have been colonized. But the ground was an archipelago.  \"Hm-m-m,\" said Sergeant Madden, after reading. \"The survey recommends this northern island for emergency landing. Eh?\"  Willis nodded. \"Huks used to use it. Not the island. The planet.\"  Sergeant Madden yawned. It seemed pathetic to him that young cops like Willis and even Timmy referred so often to Huks. There weren't any, any more. Being a cop meant carrying out purely routine tasks, nowadays. They were important tasks, of course. Without the cops, there couldn't be any civilization. But Willis and Timmy didn't think of it that way. Not yet. To them being a cop was still a matter of glamour rather than routine. They probably even regretted the absence of Huks. But when a man reached Sergeant Madden's age, glamour didn't matter. He had to remember that his job was worth doing, in itself.  \"Yeah,\" said Sergeant Madden. \"There was quite a time with those Huks.\"  \"Did you ... did you ever see a Huk, sir?\" asked Willis.  \"Before my time,\" said Sergeant Madden. \"But I've talked to men who worked on the case.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It did not occur to him that the Huks would hardly have been called a \"case\" by anybody but a cop. When human colonies spread through this sector, they encountered an alien civilization. By old-time standards, it was quite a culture. The Huks had a good technology, they had spaceships, and they were just beginning to expand, themselves, from their own home planet or planets. If they'd had a few more centuries of development, they might have been a menace to humanity. But the humans got started first.  There being no longer any armies or navies when the Huks were discovered, the matter of intelligent nonhumans was a matter for the cops. So the police matter-of-factly tried to incorporate the Huk culture into the human. They explained the rules by which human civilization worked. They painstakingly tried to arrange a sub-precinct station on the largest Huk home planet, with Huk cops in charge. They made it clear that they had nothing to do with politics and were simply concerned with protecting civilized people from those in their midst who didn't want to be civilized.  The Huks wouldn't have it. They bristled, proudly. They were defiant. They considered themselves not only as good as humans--the cops didn't care what they thought--but they insisted on acting as if they were better.  They reacted, in fact, as humans would have done if just at the beginning of their conquest of the stars, they'd run into an expanding, farther-advanced race which tried to tell them what they had to do. The Huks fought.  \"They fought pretty good,\" said Sergeant Madden tolerantly. \"Not killer-fashion--like delinks. The Force had to give 'em the choice of joining up or getting out. Took years to get 'em out. Had to use all the off-duty men from six precincts to handle the last riot.\"  The conflict he called a riot would have been termed a space battle by a navy or an army. But the cops operated within a strictly police frame of reference, which was the reverse of military. They weren't trying to subjugate the Huks, but to make them behave. In consequence, their tactics were unfathomable to the Huks--who thought in military terms. Squadrons of police ships which would have seemed ridiculous to a fighting-force commander threw the Huks off-balance, kept them off-balance, did a scrupulous minimum of damage to them, and thereby kept out of every trap the Huks set for them. In the end the cops supervised and assisted at the embittered, rebellious emigration of a race. The Huks took off for the far side of the galaxy. They'd neither been conquered nor exterminated. But Sergeant Madden thought of the decisive fracas as a riot rather than a battle.  \"Yeah,\" he repeated. \"They acted a lot like delinks.\"  Patrolman Willis spoke with some heat about delinks, who are the bane of all police forces everywhere. They practice adolescent behavior even after they grow up--but they never grow up. It is delinks who put stink-bombs in public places and write threatening letters and give warnings of bombs about to go off--and sometimes set them--and stuff dirt into cold rocket-nozzles and sometimes kill people and go incontinently hysterical because they didn't mean to. Delinks do most of the damaging things that have no sense to them. There is no cop who has not wanted to kill some grinning, half-scared, half-defiant delink who hasn't yet realized that he's destroyed half a million credits' worth of property or crippled somebody for life--for no reason at all.  Sergeant Madden listened to the denunciation of all the delink tribe. Then he yawned again.  \"I know!\" he said. \"I don't like 'em either. But we got 'em. We always will have 'em. Like old age.\"  Then he made computations with a stubby pencil and asked reflectively:  \"When're you coming out of overdrive?\"  Patrolman Willis told him. Sergeant Madden nodded.  \"I'll take another nap,\" he observed. \"We'll be there a good twenty-two hours before the _Aldeb_.\"  The little squad ship went on at an improbable multiple of the speed of light. After all, this was a perfectly normal performance. Just an ordinary bit of business for the cops.         *       *       *       *       *  Sergeant Madden belched when the squad ship came out of overdrive. He watched with seeming indifference while Patrolman Willis took a spectro on the star ahead and to the left, and painstakingly compared the reading with the ancient survey-data on the Procyron system. It had to match, of course, unless there'd been extraordinarily bad astrogation.  Willis put the spectroscope away, estimated for himself, and then checked with the dial that indicated the brightness of the still point-sized star. He said:  \"Four light-weeks, I make it.\"  Sergeant Madden nodded. A superior officer should never do anything useful, so long as a subordinate isn't making a serious mistake. That is the way subordinates are trained to become superiors, in time. Patrolman Willis set a time-switch and pushed the overdrive button. The squad ship hopped, and abruptly the local sun had a perceptible disk. Willis made the usual tests for direction of rotation, to get the ecliptic plane. He began to search for planets. As he found them, he checked with the reference data. All this was tedious. Sergeant Madden grunted:  \"That'll be it,\" he said, and pointed. \"Water world. It's the color of ocean. Try it.\"  Patrolman Willis threw on the telescope screen. The image of the distant planet leaped into view. It was Procyron III. The spiral cloud-arms of a considerable storm showed in the southern hemisphere, but in the north there was a group or specks which would be the planet's only solid ground--the archipelago reported by the century-old survey. The _Cerberus_ should have been the first ship to land there in a hundred years, and the squad ship should be the second.  Patrolman Willis got the squad ship competently over to the planet, a diameter out. He juggled to position over the archipelago. Sergeant Madden turned on the space phone. Nothing. He frowned. A grounded ship awaiting help should transmit a beam signal to guide its rescuer. But nothing came up from the ground.  Patrolman Willis looked at him uncertainly. Sergeant Madden rumbled and swung the telescope below. The surface of the planet appeared--deep water, practically black beneath a surface reflection of daytime sky. The image shifted--a patch of barren rocks. The sergeant glanced at the survey picture, shifted the telescope, and found the northern-most island. He swelled the picture. He could see the white of monstrous surf breaking on the windward shore--waves that had gathered height going all around the planet. He traced the shoreline. There was a bay up at the top.  He centered the shoreline of the bay and put on maximum magnification. Then he pointed a stubby forefinger. A singular, perfectly straight streak of black appeared, beginning a little distance inland from the bay and running up into what appeared to be higher ground. The streak ended not far from a serpentine arm of the sea which almost cut the island in half.  \"That'll be it,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23636"],["title","A Matter of Importance (#2)"],["body","\" said Sergeant Madden, rumbling. \"The _Cerberus_ had to land on her rockets. She had some ground speed. She burned a ten-mile streak on the ground, coming down.\" He growled. \"Commercial skippers! Should've matched velocity aloft! Take her down.\"  The squad ship drove for ground.  Patrolman Willis steadied the ship no more than a few thousand feet high, above the streak of scorched ground and ashes.  \"It was heading inland, all right,\" rumbled Sergeant Madden. \"Lucky! If it'd been heading the other way, it could've gone out and landed in the sea. That would ha' been a mess! But where is it?\"  The squad ship descended farther. It followed the lane of carbonized soil. That marking narrowed--the _Cerberus_ had plainly been descending. Then the streak came to an end. It pinched out to nothing. The _Cerberus_ should have been at its end.  It wasn't. There was no ship down on Procyron III.         *       *       *       *       *  The matter ceased to be routine. If the liner's drive conked out where Procyron III was the nearest refuge planet, it should have landed here at least six days ago. Some ship had landed here recently.  \"Set down,\" grunted Sergeant Madden.  Patrolman Willis obeyed. The squad ship came to rest in a minor valley, a few hundred yards from the end of the rocket-blast trail. Sergeant Madden got out. Patrolman Willis followed him. This was a duly surveyed and recommended refuge planet. There was no need to check the air or take precautions against inimical animal or vegetable life. The planet was safe.  They clambered over small rocky obstacles until they came to the end of the scorched line. They surveyed the state of things in silence.  A ship had landed here recently. Its blue-white rocket flames had melted gulleys in the soil, turned it to slag, and then flung silky, gossamer threads of slag-wool over the rocks nearby.  At the end of the melted-away hollows, twin slag-lined holes went down deep into the ground. They were take-off holes. Rockets had burned them deeply as they gathered force to lift the ship away again.  Sergeant Madden scrambled to the edge of the nearest blast-well. He put his hand on the now-solidified, glassy slag. It wasn't warm, but it wasn't cold. The glass-lined hole a rocket leaves takes a long time to cool down.  \"She landed here, all right,\" he grunted. \"But she took off again before the torp arrived to tell us about it.\"  Willis protested:  \"But, sergeant! She only had one set of rockets! She couldn't have taken off again! She didn't have the rockets to do it with!\"  \"I know she couldn't,\" growled the sergeant. \"But she did.\"  The _Cerberus_, once landed, should have waited here. It was not only a police regulation; it was common sense. When a ship broke down in space, the exclusive hope for that ship's company lay in a refuge planet for ships in that traffic lane. Even lifeboats could ordinarily reach some refuge planet, for picking up later. They couldn't possibly be located otherwise. With three dimensions in which to be missed, and light-years of distance in which to miss them--no ship or boat had ever been found as much as a light-week out in space. No ship with a crippled drive could possibly be helped unless it got to a specified refuge world where it could be found. No ship which had reached a refuge planet could conceivably want to leave it.  There was also the fact that no ship which had made such a landing would have extra rockets with which to take off for departure.  The _Cerberus_ had landed. Timmy's girl was on it. It had taken off again. It was either an impossible mass suicide or something worse. It certainly wasn't routine.  Patrolman Willis asked hesitantly:  \"D'you think, sergeant, it could be Huks sneaked back--?\"  Sergeant Madden did not answer. He went back to the squad ship and armed himself. Patrolman Willis followed suit. The sergeant boobied the squad ship so no unauthorized person could make use of it, and so it would disable itself if anyone with expert knowledge tried. Therefore, nobody with expert knowledge would try.  The two cops began a painstaking quest for police-type evidence to tell them what had happened, and how and why the _Cerberus_ was missing, after a clumsy but safe landing on Procyron III and when all sanity demanded that it stay there, and when it was starkly impossible for it to leave.         *       *       *       *       *  Sergeant Madden and Patrolman Willis were, self-evidently, the only human beings on a planet some nine thousand miles in diameter. It was easy to compute that the nearest other humans would be at least some thousands of thousands of millions of miles away--so far away that distance had no meaning. This planet was something over nine-tenth rolling sea, but there were a few tens of thousands of square miles of solid ground in the one archipelago that broke the ocean's surface. It was such loneliness as very few people ever experience. But they did not notice it. They were busy.  They went over the ground immediately about the landing place. Rocket flame had splashed it, both at the _Cerberus'_ landing and at the impossible take-off. There was nothing within a hundred yards not burned to a crisp. They searched outside that area. Sergeant Madden rumbled to his companion:  \"Where'd the other ship land?\"  Patrolman Willis blinked at him.  \"There had to be another ship!\" said Sergeant Madden irritably. \"To bring the extra rockets. The other ship had to've brought 'em. And it had to have rockets of its own. There's no spaceport here!\"  Patrolman Willis blinked again. Then he saw. The _Cerberus_ carried one set of emergency-landing rockets, for use in a descent on a refuge planet if the need arose. The need had arisen and the _Cerberus_ had used them. Then, from somewhere, another set of rockets had been produced for it to use in leaving. Those other rockets must have come on another ship. But it was a trifle more complicated than that. The _Cerberus_ had carried one set of rockets and used them. One. It had been supplied with another set from somewhere. Two. They must have been brought by a ship which also used a set of rockets to land by. That made three. Then the other ship must have had a fourth set for its own take-off, or it would be grounded forever on Procyron III.  Patrolman Willis frowned.  \"We looked pretty carefully from aloft,\" he said uncomfortably. \"If there'd been another burned-off landing place, we'd have seen it.\"  \"I know,\" rumbled Sergeant Madden. \"And we didn't. But there must've been another ship aground when the _Cerberus_ came in. Where was it? It prob'ly knew the _Cerberus_ was landing to wait for help. How? If somebody was coming to help the _Cerberus_ it would be bound to spot the other ship, and it didn't want to be spotted. Why? Anyhow, it must've taken the _Cerberus_ and sent it off, and then taken off itself, leaving nothing sensible for us to think. 'Sounds like delinks.\" Then he growled. \"Only it's not. There'd have to be too many men. Delinks don't work together more'n two or three. Too jealous of showin' off. But where was that other ship, and what was it doin' here?\"  Patrolman Willis hesitated, and then said:  \"There used to be pirates, sergeant.\"  \"Uh-huh,\" said the sergeant. \"You had it right the first time, most likely. Not delinks. Not pirates. You said Huks.\" He looked around, estimatingly. \"The rockets had to be brought here from somewhere else where they'd been landed. I'm betting the tracks were covered pretty careful. But rockets are heavy. Manhandlin' them, whoever was doin' it would take the easiest way. Hm-m-m. There's water close by over yonder. Sort of a sound in there--too narrow to be a bay. Let's have a look. And the slopes are easiest that way, too.\"  He led off to the eastward. He thought of Timmy's girl. He'd never seen her, but Timmy was going to marry her. She was on the _Cerberus_. It was the job of the cops to take care of whatever dilemma that ship might be in. As of here and now, it was Sergeant Madden's job. But besides that, he thought of the way Timmy would feel if anything happened to the girl he meant to marry. As Timmy's father, the sergeant had to do something. He wanted to do it fast. But it had to be done the right way.         *       *       *       *       *  The route he chose was rocky, but it was nearly the only practicable route away from the burned-dead landing place. He climbed toward what on this planet was the east. There were pinnacles and small precipices. There were small, fleshy-leaved bushes growing out of such tiny collections of soil as had formed in cracks and crevices in the rock.  Sergeant Madden noted that one such bush was wilted. He stopped. He bent over and carefully felt of the stones about it. A small rock came out. The bush had been out of the ground before. It had carefully been replaced. By someone.  \"The rockets came this way,\" said the sergeant, with finality. \"Hauled over this pass to the _Cerberus_. Somebody must've knocked this bush loose while workin' at getting 'em along. So he replanted it. Only not good enough. It wilted.\"  \"Who did it?\" demanded Patrolman Willis.  \"Who we want to know about,\" growled Sergeant Madden. \"Maybe Huks. Come on!\"  He scrambled ahead. He wheezed as he climbed and descended. After half a mile, Patrolman Willis said abruptly:  \"You figure they all left, before anybody tried to find 'em?\"  The sergeant grunted affirmatively. A quarter mile still farther, the rocky ground fell away. There was the gleam of water below them. Rocky cliffs enclosed an arm of the sea that came deep into the land, here. In the cliffs rock-strata tilted insanely. There were red and yellow and black layers--mostly yellow and black. They showed in startlingly clear contrast.  \"Right!\" said Sergeant Madden in morose satisfaction. \"I thought there might've been a boat. But this's it!\"  He went down a steep descent to the very edge of the sound--it was even more like a fjord--where the waters of"]]]
