Malone wanted to walk through mountains, or climb fire. He felt confused, but wonderful. \"Barbara,\" she said.  \"Lovely,\" he said. \"Well, Barbara ... and please call me Ken. It's short for Kenneth.\"  The smile on her face broadened. \"I thought it might be,\" she said.  \"Well,\" Malone said softly, \"it is. Kenneth. That's my name. And you're Barbara.\"  Boyd cleared his throat.  \"Ah,\" Malone said. \"Yes. Of course. Well, Barbara ... well, that's just what we intend to do. Take Miss Thompson away. We need her--badly.\"  Dr. Harman had said nothing at all, and had barely moved. He was staring at a point on his desk. \"She couldn't possibly have heard us,\" he muttered. \"That's a soundproof door. She couldn't have heard us.\"  \"But you can't take Miss Thompson away,\" Miss Wilson said.  \"We have to, Barbara,\" Malone said gently. \"Try to understand. It's for the national security.\"  \"She heard us thinking,\" Dr. Harman muttered. \"That's what; she heard us thinking. Behind a soundproof door. She can see inside their minds. She can even see inside _my_ mind.\"  \"She's a sick woman,\" Barbara said.  \"But you have to understand--\"  \"Vital necessity,\" Boyd put in. \"Absolutely vital.\"  \"Nevertheless--\" Barbara said.  \"She can read minds,\" Dr. Harman whispered in an awed tone. \"She knows. Everything. She _knows_.\"  \"It's out of the question,\" Barbara said. \"Whether you like it or not. Miss Thompson is not going to leave this hospital. Why, what could she do outside these walls? She hasn't left in over forty years! And furthermore, Mr. Malone--\"  \"Kenneth,\" Malone put in, as the door opened again. \"I mean Ken.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The little old lady put her haloed head into the room. \"Now, now, Barbara,\" she said. \"Don't you go spoiling things. Just let these nice men take me away and everything will be fine, believe me. Besides, I've been outside more often than you imagine.\"  \"Outside?\" Barbara said.  \"Of course,\" the little old lady said. \"In other people's minds. Even yours. I remember that nice young man ... what was his name?\"  \"Never mind his name,\" Barbara said, flushing furiously.  Malone felt instantly jealous of every nice young man he had ever even heard of. _He_ wasn't a nice young man; he was an FBI agent, and he liked to drink and smoke cigars and carouse.  All nice young men, he decided, should be turned into ugly old men as soon as possible. That'd fix them!  He noticed the little old lady smiling at him, and tried to change his thoughts rapidly. But the little old lady said nothing at all.  \"At any rate,\" Barbara said, \"I'm afraid that we just can't--\"  Dr. Harman cleared his throat imperiously. It was a most impressive noise, and everyone turned to look at him. His face was a little gray, but he looked, otherwise, like a rather pudgy, blond, crew-cut Roman emperor.  \"Just a moment,\" he said with dignity, \"I think you're doing the United States of America a grave injustice, Miss Wilson--and that you're doing an injustice to Miss Thompson, too.\"  \"What do you mean?\" she said.  \"I think it would be nice for her to get away from me--I mean from here,\" the psychiatrist said. \"Where did you say you were taking her?\" he asked Malone.  \"Yucca Flats,\" Malone said.  \"Ah.\" The news seemed to please the psychiatrist. \"That's a long distance from here, isn't it? It's quite a few hundred miles away. Perhaps even a few thousand miles away. I feel sure that will be the best thing for me ... I mean, of course, for Miss Thompson. I shall recommend that the court so order.\"  \"Doctor--\" But even Barbara saw, Malone could tell, that it was no good arguing with Dr. Harman. She tried a last attack. \"Doctor, who's going to take care of her?\"  A light the size and shape of North America burst in Malone's mind. He almost chortled. But he managed to keep his voice under control. \"What she needs,\" he said, \"is a trained psychiatric nurse.\"  Barbara Wilson gave him a look that had carloads of U{235} stacked away in it, but Malone barely minded. She'd get over it, he told himself.  \"Now, wasn't that sweet of you to think of that,\" the little old lady said. Malone looked at her and was rewarded with another wink.  \"I'm certainly glad you thought of Barbara,\" the little old lady went on. \"You will go with me won't you, dear? I'll make you a duchess. Wouldn't you like to be a duchess, dear?\"  Barbara looked from Malone to the little old lady, and then she looked at Dr. Harman. Apparently what she saw failed to make her happy.  \"We'll take good care of her, Barbara,\" Malone said.  She didn't even bother to give him an answer. After a second Boyd said: \"Well, I guess that settles it. If you'll let me use your phone, Dr. Harman, I'll call Judge Dunning.\"  \"Go right ahead,\" Dr. Harman said. \"Go right ahead.\"  The little old lady smiled softly without looking at anybody at all. \"Won't it be wonderful?\" she whispered. \"At last I've been recognized. My country is about to pay me for my services. My loyal subjects--\" She stopped and wiped what Malone thought was a tear from one cornflower-blue eye.  \"Now, now, Miss Thompson,\" Barbara said.  \"I'm not sad,\" the little old lady said, smiling up at her. \"I'm just so very happy. I am about to get my reward, my well-deserved reward at last, from all of my loyal subjects. You'll see.\" She paused and Malone felt a faint stirring of stark, chill fear.  \"Won't it be wonderful?\" said the little old lady.     IV   \"You're _where_?\" Andrew J. Burris said.  Malone looked at the surprised face on the screen and wished he hadn't called. He had to report in, of course--but, if he'd had any sense, he'd have ordered Boyd to do the job for him.  Oh, well, it was too late for that now. \"I'm in Las Vegas,\" he said. \"I tried to get you last night, but I couldn't, so I--\"  \"Las Vegas,\" Burris said. \"Well, well. Las Vegas.\" His face darkened and his voice became very loud. \"Why aren't you in Yucca Flats?\" he screamed.  \"Because she insisted on it,\" Malone said. \"The old lady. Miss Thompson. She says there's another telepath here.\"  Burris closed his eyes. \"Well, that's a relief,\" he said at last. \"Somebody in one of the gambling houses, I suppose. Fine, Malone.\" He went right on without a pause: \"The boys have uncovered two more in various parts of the nation. Not one of them is even close to sane.\" He opened his eyes. \"Where's this one?\" he said.  Malone sighed. \"In the looney bin,\" he said.  Burris' eyes closed again. Malone waited in silence. At last Burris said: \"All right. Get him out.\"  \"Right,\" Malone said.  \"Tell me,\" Burris said. \"Why did Miss Thompson insist that you go to Las Vegas? Somebody else could have done the job. You could have sent Boyd, couldn't you?\"  \"Chief,\" Malone said slowly, \"what sort of mental condition are those other telepaths in?\"  \"Pretty bad,\" Burris said. \"As a matter of fact, very bad. Miss Thompson may be off her trolley, but the others haven't even got any tracks.\" He paused. \"What's that got to do with it?\" he said.  \"Well,\" Malone said, \"I figured we'd better handle Miss Thompson with kid gloves--at least until we find a better telepath to work with.\" He didn't mention Barbara Wilson. The chief, he told himself, didn't want to be bothered with details.  [Illustration]  \"Doggone right you'd better,\" Burris said. \"You treat that old lady as if she were the Queen herself, understand?\"  \"Don't worry,\" Malone said unhappily. \"We are.\" He hesitated. \"She says she'll help us find our spy, all right, but we've got to do it her way--or else she won't co-operate.\"  \"Do it her way, then,\" Burris said. \"That spy--\"  \"Chief, are you sure?\"  Burris blinked. \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what _is_ her way?\"  Malone took a deep breath. \"First,\" he said, \"we had to come here and pick this guy up. This William Logan, who's in a private sanitarium just outside of Las Vegas. That's number one. Miss Thompson wants to get all the telepaths together, so they can hold mental conversations or something.\"  \"And all of them batty,\" Burris said.  \"Sure,\" Malone said. \"A convention of nuts--and me in the middle. Listen, chief--\"  \"Later,\" Burris said. \"When this is over we can all resign, or go fishing, or just plain shoot ourselves. But right now the national security is primary, Malone. Remember that.\"  \"O.K.,\" Malone sighed. \"O.K. But she wants all the nuts here.\"  \"Go along with her,\" Burris snapped. \"Keep her happy. So far, Malone, she's the only lead we have on the guy who's swiping information from Yucca Flats. If she wants something, Malone, you do it.\"  \"But, chief--\"  \"Don't interrupt me,\" Burris said. \"If she wants to be treated like a queen, you treat her like one. Malone, that's an order!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Malone said sadly. \"But, chief, she wants us to buy her some new clothes.\"  Burris exploded: \"Is that all? New clothes? Get 'em. Put 'em on the expense account. New clothes are a drop in the bucket.\"  \"Well ... she thinks we need new clothes, too.\"  \"Maybe you do,\" Burris said. \"Put the whole thing on the expense account. You don't think I'm going to quibble about a few dollars, do you?\"  \"Well--\"  \"Get the clothes. Just don't bother me with details like this. Handle the job yourself, Malone--you're in charge out there. And get to Yucca Flats as soon as possible.\"  Malone gave up. \"Yes, sir,\" he said.  \"All right, then,\" Burris said. \"Call me tomorrow. Meanwhile--good luck, Malone. Chin up.\"  Malone said: \"Yes, sir,\" and reached for the switch. But Burris' voice stopped him.  \"Just one thing,\" he said.  \"Yes, chief?\" Malone said.  Burris frowned. \"Don't spend any more for the clothes than you have to,\" he said.  Malone nodded, and cut off.         *       *       *       *       *  When the director's image had vanished, he got up and went to the window of the hotel room. Outside, a huge sign told the world, and Malone, that this was the Thunderbird-Hilton-Zeckendorf Hotel, but Malone ignored it. He didn't need a sign; he knew where he was."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23661"],["title","The Book of Dragons (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: THE BOOK OF DRAGONS]   The Book of DRAGONS  E.

The Book of Beasts   He happened to be building a Palace when the news came, and he left all the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear up--but then the news was rather remarkable news. You see, there was a knock at the front door and voices talking downstairs, and Lionel thought it was the man come to see about the gas, which had not been allowed to be lighted since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the gas bracket.  And then, quite suddenly, Nurse came in and said, \"Master Lionel, dear, they've come to fetch you to go and be King.\"  Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands and brush his hair, and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept wriggling and fidgeting and saying, \"Oh, don't, Nurse,\" and, \"I'm sure my ears are quite clean,\" or, \"Never mind my hair, it's all right,\" and, \"That'll do.\"  \"You're going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King,\" said Nurse.  The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting for his clean handkerchief, and in the drawing room there were two very grave-looking gentlemen in red robes with fur, and gold coronets with velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very expensive jam tarts.  They bowed low to Lionel, and the gravest one said: \"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, the King of this country, is dead, and now you have got to come and be King.\"  \"Yes, please, sir,\" said Lionel, \"when does it begin?\"  \"You will be crowned this afternoon,\" said the grave gentleman who was not quite so grave-looking as the other.  \"Would you like me to bring Nurse, or what time would you like me to be fetched, and hadn't I better put on my velvet suit with the lace collar?\" said Lionel, who had often been out to tea.  \"Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later. No, never mind about changing your suit; the Royal robes will cover all that up.\"  The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses, which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived. It was No. 7, on the left-hand side of the street as you go up.  Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute, and he kissed Nurse and said: \"Thank you for washing me. I wish I'd let you do the other ear. No--there's no time now. Give me the hanky. Good-bye, Nurse.\"  \"Good-bye, ducky,\" said Nurse. \"Be a good little King now, and say 'please' and 'thank you,' and remember to pass the cake to the little girls, and don't have more than two helps of anything.\"  So off went Lionel to be made a King. He had never expected to be a King any more than you have, so it was all quite new to him--so new that he had never even thought of it. And as the coach went through the town he had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real, because if his tongue was real it showed he wasn't dreaming. Half an hour before he had been building with bricks in the nursery; and now--the streets were all fluttering with flags; every window was crowded with people waving handkerchiefs and scattering flowers; there were scarlet soldiers everywhere along the pavements, and all the bells of all the churches were ringing like mad, and like a great song to the music of their ringing he heard thousands of people shouting, \"Long live Lionel! Long live our little King!\"  He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes, but he soon forgot to think about that. If he had been a girl he would very likely have bothered about it the whole time.  As they went along, the grave gentlemen, who were the Chancellor and the Prime Minister, explained the things which Lionel did not understand.  \"I thought we were a Republic,\" said Lionel. \"I'm sure there hasn't been a King for some time.\"  \"Sire, your great-great-great-great-great-grandfather's death happened when my grandfather was a little boy,\" said the Prime Minister, \"and since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crown--so much a week, you know, according to people's means--sixpence a week from those who have first-rate pocket money, down to a halfpenny a week from those who haven't so much. You know it's the rule that the crown must be paid for by the people.\"  \"But hadn't my great-great-however-much-it-is-grandfather a crown?\"  \"Yes, but he sent it to be tinned over, for fear of vanity, and he had had all the jewels taken out, and sold them to buy books. He was a strange man; a very good King he was, but he had his faults--he was fond of books. Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be tinned--and he never lived to pay the tinsmith's bill.\"  Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear, and just then the carriage stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned. Being crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose, and by the time it was over, and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it, he was quite worn out, and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery.  Nurse was there, and tea was ready: seedy cake and plummy cake, and jam and hot buttered toast, and the prettiest china with red and gold and blue flowers on it, and real tea, and as many cups of it as you liked.  After tea Lionel said: \"I think I should like a book. Will you get me one, Nurse?\"  \"Bless the child,\" said Nurse. \"You don't suppose you've lost the use of your legs with just being a King? Run along, do, and get your books yourself.\"  So Lionel went down into the library. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor were there, and when Lionel came in they bowed very low, and were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming bothering for now--when Lionel cried out: \"Oh, what a worldful of books! Are they yours?\"  \"They are yours, Your Majesty,\" answered the Chancellor. \"They were the property of the late King, your great-great--\"  \"Yes, I know,\" Lionel interrupted. \"Well, I shall read them all. I love to read. I am so glad I learned to read.\"  \"If I might venture to advise Your Majesty,\" said the Prime Minister, \"I should not read these books. Your great--\"  \"Yes?\" said Lionel, quickly.  \"He was a very good King--oh, yes, really a very superior King in his way, but he was a little--well, strange.\"  \"Mad?\" asked Lionel, cheerfully.  \"No, no\"--both the gentlemen were sincerely shocked. \"Not mad; but if I may express it so, he was--er--too clever by half. And I should not like a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books.\"  Lionel looked puzzled.  \"The"]]]
