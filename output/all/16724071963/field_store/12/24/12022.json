There's nothin' doin' apparently in this poort.  Annyhow I can't git work, an' I've a wife an' chick at home, who've bin so long used to praties and bacon that their stummicks don't take kindly to fresh air fried in nothin'.  So ye see, sur, findin' it difficult to make a livin' above ground, I'm disposed to try to make it under water.\"  While Rooney Machowl was speaking Baldwin regarded him with a fixed and critical gaze.  What his opinion of the recruit was did not, however, appear on his countenance or in his reply, for he merely said, \"Humph! Well, we'll see.  You'll begin your education in your noo profession by payin' partikler attention to all that is said an' done around you.\"  \"Yis, sur,\" returned Machowl, respectfully touching the peak of his cap and wrinkling his forehead very much, while he looked on at the further proceedings of the divers with that expression of deep earnest sincerity of attention which--whether assumed or genuine--is only possible to the countenance of an Irishman.  During this colloquy the two men standing by the pump-case, and two other men who appeared to be supernumeraries, listened with much interest, but the diver seated on the plank, resting and calmly smoking his pipe, gazed with apparent indifference at the sea, from which he had recently emerged.  This man was a very large fellow, with a dark surly countenance--not exactly bad in expression, but rather ill-tempered-looking.  His diving-dress being necessarily very wide and baggy, made him seem larger than he really was--indeed, quite gigantic.  The dress was made of very thick india-rubber cloth, and all--feet, legs, body, and arms--was of one piece, so perfectly secured at the seams as to be thoroughly impervious to air or water.  To get into it was a matter of some difficulty, the entrance being effected at the neck.  When this neck is properly attached to the helmet, the diver is thoroughly cut off from the external world, except through the air-tube communicating with his helmet and the pump afore mentioned.  \"Have ye got the hole finished, Maxwell?\" said Baldwin, turning to the surly diver.  \"Yes,\" he replied shortly.  \"Well, then, go down and fix the charge.  Here it is,\" said Baldwin, taking from a wooden case an object about eighteen inches long, which resembled a large office-ruler that had been coated thickly with pitch. It was an elongated shell filled to the muzzle with gunpowder.  To one end of it was fastened the end of a coil of wire which was also coated with some protecting substance.  As Baldwin spoke Maxwell slowly puffed the last \"draw\" from his lips and knocked the ashes out of his pipe on the plank, on which he still remained seated while the two supernumeraries busied themselves in completing his toilet for him; one screwing on his helmet, which appeared ridiculously large, the other loading his breast and back with two heavy leaden weights.  When fully equipped, the diver carried on his person a weight fully equal to that of his own bulky person.  \"Now look here, Mister Edgar, an' pay partikler attention, Rooney Machowl.  This here toobe, made of indyrubber, d'ee see?  (`Yis, sur,' from Rooney) I fix on, as you perceive, to the back of Maxwell's helmet. It communicates with that there pump, and when these two men work the pump, air will be forced into the helmet and into the dress down to his very toes.  We could bu'st him, if we were so disposed, if it wasn't for an escape-valve, here close beside the air-toobe, at the back of the helmet, which keeps lettin' off the surplus air.  Moreover, there is another valve, here in front of the breast-plate, which is under the control of the diver, so that he can let air escape by givin' it a half-turn when the men at the pumps are givin' him too much, or he can keep it in when they're givin' him enough.\"  \"An' what does he do,\" asked Rooney, with an anxious expression, \"whin they give him too little?\"  \"He pulls on the air-pipe,--as I'll explain to you in good time--the proper signal for `more air.'\"  \"But what if he forgits, or misremimbers the signal?\" asked the inquisitive recruit.  \"Why then,\" replied Baldwin, \"he suffocates, and we pull him up dead, an' give him decent burial.  Keep yourself easy, my lad, an' you'll know all about it in good time.  I'll soon give 'ee the chance to suffocate or bu'st yourself accordin' to taste.\"  \"Come, cut it short and look alive,\" said Maxwell gruffly, as he stood up to permit of a stout rope being fastened to his waist.  \"You shut up!\" retorted Baldwin.  Having exchanged these little civilities the two divers moved to the side of the barge--Maxwell with a slow ponderous tread.  A short iron ladder dipped from the gunwale of the barge a few feet down into the sea.  The diver stepped upon this, turning with his face inwards, descended knee-deep into the water, and then stopped.  Baldwin handed him the blasting-charge.  At the same moment one of the supernumeraries advanced with the front-glass or bull's-eye in his hand, and the men at the pumps gave a turn or two to see that all was working well.  \"All right?\" demanded the supernumerary.  \"Right,\" responded Maxwell, in a voice which issued sepulchrally from the iron globe.  There are three round windows fitted with thick plate-glass in the helmets to which we refer.  The front one is made to screw off and on, and the fixing of this is always the last operation in completing a diver's toilet.  \"Pump away,\" said the man, holding the round glass in front of Maxwell's nose, and looking over his shoulder to see that the order was obeyed. The glass was screwed on, and the man finished off by gravely patting Maxwell in an affectionate manner on the head.  \"Why does he pat him so?\" asked Edgar, with a laugh at the apparent tenderness of the act.  \"It's a tinder farewell, I suppose,\" murmured Rooney, \"in case he niver comes up again.\"  \"It is to let him know that he may now descend in safety,\" answered Baldwin.  \"The pump there is kep' goin' from a few moments before the front-glass is screwed on till the diver shows his head above water again--which he'll do in quarter of an hour or so, for it don't take long to lay a charge; but our ordinary spell under water, when work is steady, is about four hours--more or less--with perhaps a breath of ten minutes once or twice at the surface when they're working deep.\"  \"But why a breath at the surface?\" asked Edgar.  \"Isn't the air sent down fresh enough?\"  \"Quite fresh enough, Mister Edgar, but the pressure when we go deep--say ten or fifteen fathoms--is severe on a man if long continued, so that he needs a little relief now and then.  Some need more and some less relief, accordin' to their strength.  Maxwell has only gone down fifteen feet, so that he wouldn't need to come up at all durin' a spell of work. We're goin' to blast a big rock that has bin' troublesome to us at low water.  The hole was driven in it last week.  We moored a raft over it and kep' men at work with a long iron jumper that reached from the rock to the surface of the sea.  It was finished last night, and now he's gone to fix the charge.\"  \"But I don't understand about the pressure, sur, at all at all,\" said Machowl, with a complicated look of puzzlement; \"sure whin I putt my hand in wather I don't feel no pressure whatsomediver.\"  \"Of course not,\" responded Baldwin, \"because you don't put it deep enough.  You must know that our atmosphere presses on our bodies with a weight of about 20,000 pounds.  Well, if you go thirty-two feet deep in the sea you get the pressure of exactly another atmosphere, which means that you've got to stand a pressure all over your body of 40,000 when you've got down as deep as thirty-two feet.\"  \"But,\" objected Rooney, \"I don't fed no pressure of the atmosphere on me body at all.\"  \"That's because you're squeezed by the air inside of you, man, as well as by the atmosphere outside, which takes off the _feelin'_ of it, an', moreover, you're used to it.  If the weight of our atmosphere was took off your outside and not took off your inside--your lungs an' the like,--you'd come to feel it pretty strong, for you'd swell like a balloon an' bu'st a'most, if not altogether.\"  Baldwin paused a moment and regarded the puzzled countenance of his pupil with an air of pity.  \"Contrairywise,\" he continued, \"if the air was all took out of your inside an' allowed to remain on your outside, you'd go squash together like a collapsed indyrubber ball.  Well then, if that be so with one atmosphere, what must it be with a pressure equal to two, which you have when you go down to thirty-two feet deep in the sea?  An' if you go down to twenty-five fathoms, or 150 feet, which is often done, what must the pressure be there?\"  \"Tightish, no doubt,\" said Rooney.  \"True, lad,\" continued Joe.  \"Of course, to counteract this we must force more air down to you the deeper you go, so that the pressure inside of you may be a little more than the pressure outside, in order to force the foul air out of the dress through the escape-valve; and what between the one an' the other your sensations are peculiar, you may be sure.--But come, young man, don't be alarmed.  We'll not send you down very deep at first.  If some divers go down as deep as twenty-five fathoms, surely you'll not be frightened to try two and a half.\"  Whatever Rooney's feelings might have been, the judicious allusion to the possibility of his being frightened was sufficient to call forth the emphatic assertion that he was ready to go down two thousand fathoms if they had ropes long enough and weights heavy enough to sink him!  While the recruit is preparing for his subaqueous experiments, you and I, reader, will go see what Maxwell is about at the bottom of the sea.    CHAPTER TWO.  DESCRIBES A FIRST VISIT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA.  When the diver received the encouraging pat on the head, as already related, he descended the ladder to its "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23493"],["title","Under the Waves: Diving in Deep Waters (#3)"],["body","round.  Here, being a few feet below the surface, the buoyancy of the water relieved him of much of the oppression caused by the great weights with which he was loaded. He was in a semi-floating condition, hence the ladder, being no longer necessary, was made to terminate at that point.  He let go his hold of it and sank gently to the bottom, regulating his pace by a rope which descended from the foot of the ladder to the mud, on which in a few seconds his leaden soles softly rested.  A continuous stream of air-bubbles from the safety-valve behind the helmet indicated to those above that the pumps were doing their duty, and at the same time hid the diver entirely from their sight.  Meanwhile the two men who acted as signalman and assistant stood near the head of the ladder, the first holding the life-line, the assistant the coil of air-tubing.  Their duty was to stand by and pay out or haul in tubing and line according as the diver's movements and necessities should require.  They were to attend also to his signals--some of which were transmitted by the line and some by the air-tube.  These signals vary among divers.  With Baldwin and his party one pull on the _life-line_ meant \"All right;\" four pulls, \"I'm coming up.\"  One pull on the air-pipe signified \"Sufficient air;\" two pulls, \"More air.\"  (pump faster.)  Four pulls was an alarm, and signified \"Haul me up.\"  The aspect of Rooney Machowl's face when endeavouring to understand Baldwin's explanation of these signals was a sight worth seeing!  But to return to our diver.  On reaching the bottom, Maxwell took a coil of small line which hung on his left arm, and attached one end of it to a stone or sinker which kept taut the ladder-line by which he had descended.  This was his clew to guide him back to the ladder.  Not only is the light under water very dim--varying of course, according to depth, until total darkness ensues--but a diver's vision is much weakened by the muddy state of the water at river-mouths and in harbours, so that he is usually obliged to depend more on feeling than on sight.  If he were to leave the foot of his ladder without the guiding-coil, it would be difficult if not impossible to find it again, and his only resource would be to signal \"Haul me up,\" which would be undignified, to say the least of it!  By means of this coil he can wander about at will--within the limits of his air-tube tether of course,--and be certain to find his way back to the ladder-foot in the darkest or muddiest water.  Having fastened the line, the diver walked in the direction of the rock on which he had to operate, dropping gradually the coils of the guiding-line as he proceeded.  His progress was very slow, for water is a dense medium, and man's form is not well adapted for walking in it--as every bather knows who has attempted to walk when up to his neck in it. He soon found the object of his search, and went down on his knees beside the hole already driven into the rock.  Even this process of going on his knees was not so simple as it sounds, for the men above were sending down more air than could escape by the valve behind the helmet, and thus were filling his dress to such an extent that he had a tendency to rise off the ground despite his weights.  To counteract this he opened the valve in front, let out the superabundant air, got on his knees, and was soon busy at work inserting the charge-tube into the hole and tamping it well home, taking care that the fine wire with which it communicated with the party in the barge should not be injured.  While thus engaged he was watched, apparently with deep interest, by a small crab, a shrimp, and several little fish of various kinds, all of which we may add, seemed to have various degrees of curiosity.  One particular little fish, named a goby, and celebrated for its wide-awake nature and impudence, actually came to the front-glass of the helmet and looked in.  But the diver was too busy to pay attention to it.  Nothing abashed, the goby went to each of the side-windows, but, receiving no encouragement, it made for a convenient ledge of the rock, where, resting its fore-fins on a barnacle, it turned its head a little on one side and looked on in silence.  Finding this rather tedious, after a time it went, with much of the spirit of a London street-boy, and, passing close to the shrimp, tweaked the end of one of its feelers, causing that volatile creature to vanish.  It then made a demonstration of attack on the crab, but that crustaceous worthy, sitting up on its hind-legs and expanding both claws with a very \"come-on-if-you-dare\" aspect, bid it defiance.  Meanwhile the charge was laid, and Maxwell rose to return to the world above.  Feeling a certain uncomfortable hotness in the air he breathed, and observing that his legs were remarkably thin, and that his dress was clasped somewhat too lovingly about his person, he became aware of the fact that, having neglected to reclose the front-valve, his supply of air was now insufficient.  He therefore shut the valve and began to wend his way back to the ladder.  By the time he reached it the air in his dress had swelled him out to aldermanic dimensions, so that he pulled himself up the ladder-rope, hand over hand, with the utmost ease--having previously given four pulls on his life-line to signal \"coming up.\"  A few seconds more and his head was seen to emerge from the surface, like some goggle-eyed monster of the briny deep.  A comrade at once advanced and unscrewed his front-glass, and then, but not till then, did the men at the pumps cease their labours.  \"All right,\" said Maxwell, stepping over the side and seating himself on his plank.  \"Stand by,\" said Baldwin.  The two satellites did not require that order, for they were already standing by with a small electrical machine.  The wire before mentioned as being connected with the charge of powder, now safely lodged in the hole at the bottom of the sea, was connected with the electrical machine, and a few vigorous turns of its handle were given, while every eye was turned expectantly on the surface of the sea.  That magic spark which now circles round the world, annihilating time and space, was evolved; it flashed down the wire; the ocean could not put it out; the dry powder received it; the massive rock burst into fragments; a decided shock was felt on board the barge, and a turmoil of gas-bubbles and dead or dying fish came to the surface, in the midst of which turmoil the shrimp, the crab, and the goby doubtless came to an untimely end.  Thus was cleared out of the way an obstruction which had from time immemorial been a serious inconvenience to that port; and thus every year serious inconveniences and obstructions that most people know very little about are cleared out of the way by our bold, steady, and daring divers, through the wisdom and the wonderful appliances of our submarine engineers.  \"Now then, Rooney, come an' we'll dress you,\" said Baldwin.  \"As you're goin' to be a professional diver it's right that you should have the first chance and set a good example to Mister Berrington here, who's only what we may call an amateur.\"  \"Faix, I'd rather that Mister Berrington shud go first,\" said Rooney, who, as he spoke, however, stripped himself of his coat, vest, and trousers preparatory to putting on the costume.  \"I'll be glad to go first, Rooney, if you're afraid,\" said Edgar.  Rooney's annoyance at being thought afraid was increased to indignation by a contemptuous guffaw from Maxwell.  Flushing deeply and casting a glance of anger at Maxwell, the young Irishman crushed down his feelings and said--  \"Sure, I'm only jokin'.  Put on the dress Mister Baldwin av ye plaze.\"  A diver, like a too high-bred lady, cannot well dress himself.  He requires two assistants.  Rooney Machowl sat down on the plank beside Maxwell, who was busy taking off his dress, and acted according to orders.  First of all they brought him a thick guernsey shirt, a pair of drawers and pair of _inside_ stockings, which he put on and fastened securely. Sometimes a \"crinoline\" to afford protection to the stomach in deep water is put on, but on the present occasion it was omitted, the water being shallow.  Then Baldwin put on him a \"shoulder-pad\" to bear the weight of the helmet, etcetera, and prevent chafing.  \"If it was cold, Rooney,\" said his instructor, \"I'd put two guernseys and pairs of drawers and stockin's on you, but, as it's warm, one set'll do.  Moreover, if you was goin' deep you'd have the option of stuffin' your ears with cotton soaked in oil, to relieve the pressure; some do an' some don't.  I never do myself.  It's said to relieve the pressure of air on the ears, but my ears are strong.  Anyway you won't want it in this water.--Now for the dress, boys.\"  The two assistants--with mouths expanded from ear to ear--here advanced with the strong india-rubber garment whose legs, feet, body, and arms are, as we have already said, all in one piece.  Pushing his feet in at the upper opening, Rooney writhed, thrust, and wriggled himself into it, being ably assisted by his attendants, who held open the sleeves for him and expanded the tight elastic cuffs, and, catching the dress at the neck, hitched it upwards so powerfully as almost to lift their patient off his legs.  Next, came a pair of _outside_ stockings and canvas overalls or short trousers, both of which were meant to preserve the dress-proper from injury.  Having been got into all these things, Rooney was allowed to sit down while his attendants each put on and buckled a boot with leaden soles--each boot weighing about twenty pounds.  \"A purty pair of dancin' pumps!\" remarked Rooney, turning out his toes, while Baldwin put on his breast-plate, after having drawn up the inner collar of the dress and tied it round his neck with a piece of spare yarn.  The breast-plate was made of tinned copper.  It covered part of the back, breast, and shoulders of the diver, and had a"]]]
