There was a copy in the British Library, and another one in a Library in Dartmouth, Devon.  For several years I tried at least weekly to find a copy via Abebooks or eBay, with no success.  The copy belonging to the Ballantyne family had disappeared, not to put too fine a point on it.  Eventually a kind family in Canada offered to scan the pages of their copy, and send the images to me, and this is the result.  Ballantyne did indeed try out some diving equipment, so as to obtain a first-hand feel for diving. It is related that something went wrong, too much air was sent down, and he surfaced rapidly upside down.  A similar episode is related in the book.  Ballantyne's style often gives rise to two or even three stories continuing simultaneously, and here we have the adventures of one Rooney Machowl, an Irishman who decides to move from his ship's carpenter trade to that of diving.  In fact divers should always have another trade, or they wouldn't be much use under the water.  In addition there is the aspiration of Edgar Berrington to win the hand of a fair young lady, there are the events happening to the young lady's father, and then again the events happening to the young lady's companion.  So it is all fairly convoluted.  But you'll certainly learn a lot about diving, as the art stood in 1876.  It is rather strange that Ballantyne, having written this book, which ran to several printings, did not much mention diving in any other of his books.  ________________________________________________________________________  UNDER THE WAVES; OR, DIVING IN DEEP WATERS, BY R.M.BALLANTYNE.   PREFACE.  This tale makes no claim to the character of an exhaustive illustration of all that belongs to the art of diving.  It merely deals with the most important points, and some of the most interesting incidents connected therewith.  In writing it I have sought carefully to exhibit the true and to ignore the false or improbable.  I have to acknowledge myself indebted to the well-known submarine engineers Messrs. Siebe and Gorman, and Messrs. Heinke and Davis, of London, for much valuable information; and to Messrs. Denayrouze, of Paris, for permitting me to go under water in one of their diving-dresses.  Also--among many others--to Captain John Hewat, formerly Commander in the service of the Rajah of Sarawak, for much interesting material respecting the pirates of the Eastern Seas.  R.M.B.  Edinburgh, 1876.    CHAPTER ONE.  INTRODUCES OUR HERO, ONE OF HIS ADVISERS, AND SOME OF HIS DIFFICULTIES.  \"So, sir, it seems that you've set your heart on learning something of everything?\"  The man who said this was a tall and rugged professional diver.  He to whom it was said was Edgar Berrington, our hero, a strapping youth of twenty-one.  \"Well--yes, I have set my heart upon something of that sort, Baldwin,\" answered the youth.  \"You see, I hold that an engineer ought to be practically acquainted, more or less, with everything that bears, even remotely, on his profession; therefore I have come to you for some instruction in the noble art of diving.\"  \"You've come to the right shop, Mister Edgar,\" replied Baldwin, with a gratified look.  \"I taught you to swim when you wasn't much bigger than a marlinespike, an' to make boats a'most before you could handle a clasp-knife without cuttin' your fingers, an' now that you've come to man's estate nothin'll please me more than to make a diver of you. But,\" continued Baldwin, while a shade clouded his wrinkled and weatherbeaten visage, \"I can't let you go down in the dress without leave.  I'm under authority, you know, and durstn't overstep--\"  \"Don't let that trouble you,\" interrupted his companion, drawing a letter from his pocket; \"I had anticipated that difficulty, and wrote to your employers.  Here is their answer, granting me permission to use their dresses.\"  \"All right, sir,\" said Baldwin, returning the letter without looking at it; \"I'll take your word for it, sir, as it's not much in my line to make out the meanin' o' pot-hooks and hangers.--Now, then, when will you have your first lesson?\"  \"The sooner the better.\"  \"Just so,\" said the diver, looking about him with a thoughtful air.  The apartment in which the man and the youth conversed was a species of out-house or lumber-room which had been selected by Baldwin for the stowing away of his diving apparatus and stores while these were not in use at the new pier which was in process of erection in the neighbouring harbour.  Its floor was littered with snaky coils of india-rubber tubing; enormous boots with leaden soles upwards of an inch thick; several diving helmets, two of which were of brightly polished metal, while the others were more or less battered, dulled, and dinted by hard service in the deep.  The walls were adorned with large damp india-rubber dresses, which suggested the idea of baby-giants who had fallen into the water and been sent off to bed while their costumes were hung up to dry.  In one corner lay several of the massive breast and back weights by which divers manage to sink themselves to the bottom of the sea; in another stood the chest containing the air-pump by means of which they are enabled to maintain themselves alive in that uncomfortable position; while in a third and very dark corner, an old worn-out helmet, catching a gleam from the solitary window by which the place was insufficiently lighted, seemed to glare enviously out of its goggle-eyes at its glittering successors.  Altogether, what with the strange spectral objects and the dim light, there was something weird in the aspect of the place, that accorded well with the spirit of young Berrington, who, being a hero and twenty-one, was naturally romantic.  But let us pause here to assert that he was also practical--eminently so.  Practicality is compatible with romance as well as with rascality. If we be right in holding that romance is gushing enthusiasm, then are we entitled to hold that many methodical and practical men have been, are, and ever will be, romantic.  Time sobers their enthusiasm a little, no doubt, but does by no means abate it, unless the object on which it is expended be unworthy.  Recovering from his thoughtful air, and repeating \"Just so,\" the diver added, \"Well, I suppose we'd better begin wi' them 'ere odds an' ends about us.\"  \"Not so,\" returned the youth quickly; \"I have often seen the apparatus, and am quite familiar with it.  Let us rather go to the pier at once. I'm anxious to go down.\"  \"Ah!  Mister Edgar--hasty as usual,\" said Baldwin, shaking his head slowly.  \"It's two years since I last saw you, and I _had_ hoped to find that time had quieted you a bit, but--.  Well, well--now, look here: you think you've seen all my apparatus, an' know all about it?\"  \"Not exactly all,\" returned the youth, with a smile; \"but you know I've often been in this store of yours, and heard you enlarge on most if not all of the things in it.\"  \"Yes--most, but not _all_, that's where it lies, sir.  You've often seen Siebe and Gorman's dresses, but did you ever see this helmet made by Heinke and Davis?\"  \"No, I don't think I ever did.\"  \"Or that noo helmet wi' the speakin'-toobe made by Denayrouze and Company, an' this dress made by the same?\"  \"No, I've seen none of these things, and certainly this is the first time I have heard of a speaking-tube for divers.\"  \"Well then, you see, Mister Edgar, you have something to larn here after all; among other things, that Denayrouze's is _not_ the first speakin'-toobe,\" said Baldwin, who thereupon proceeded with the most impressive manner and earnest voice to explain minutely to his no less earnest pupil the various clever contrivances by which the several makers sought to render their apparatus perfect.  With all this, however, we will not trouble the reader, but proceed at once to the port, where diving operations were being carried on in connection with repairs to the breakwater.  On their way thither the diver and his young companion continued their conversation.  \"Which of the various dresses do you think the best?\" asked Edgar.  \"I don't know,\" answered Baldwin.  \"Ah, then you are not bigotedly attached to that of your employer--like some of your fraternity with whom I have conversed?\"  \"I _am_ attached to Siebe and Gorman's dress,\" returned Baldwin, \"but I am no bigot.  I believe in every thing and every creature having good and bad points.  The dress I wear and the apparatus I work seem to me as near perfection as may be, but I've lived too long in this world to suppose nobody can improve on 'em.  I've heard men who go down in the dresses of other makers praise 'em just as much as I do mine, an' maybe with as good reason.  I believe 'em all to be serviceable.  When I've had more experience of 'em I'll be able to say which I think the best.-- I've got a noo hand on to-day,\" continued Baldwin, \"an' as he's goin' down this afternoon for the first time, so you've come at a good time. He's a smart young man, but I'm not very hopeful of him, for he's an Irishman.\"  \"Come, old fellow,\" said Edgar, with a laugh, \"mind what you say about Irishmen.  I've got a dash of Irish blood in me through my mother, and won't hear her countrymen spoken of with disrespect.  Why should not an Irishman make a good diver?\"  \"Because he's too excitable, as a rule,\" replied Baldwin.  \"You see, Mister Edgar, it takes a cool, quiet, collected sort of man to make a good diver, and Irishmen ain't so cool as I should wish.  Englishmen are better, but the best of all are Scotchmen.  Give me a good, heavy, raw-boned lump of a Scotchman, who'll believe nothin' till he's convinced, and accept nothin' till it's proved, who'll argue with a stone wall, if he's got nobody else to dispute with, in that slow sedate humdrum way that drives everybody wild but himself,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23493"],["title","Under the Waves: Diving in Deep Waters (#1)"],["body"," who's got an amazin' conscience, but no nerves whatever to speak of--ah, that's the man to go under water, an' crawl about by the hour among mud and wreckage without gittin' excited or makin' a fuss about it if he should get his life-line or air-toobe entangled among iron bolts, smashed-up timbers, twisted wire-ropes, or such like.\"  \"Scotchmen should feel complimented by your opinion of them,\" said Edgar.  \"So they should, for I mean it,\" replied Baldwin, \"but I hope the Irishman will turn up a trump this time.--May I take the liberty of askin' how you're gittin' on wi' the engineering, Mister Edgar?\"  \"Oh, famously.  That is to say, I've just finished my engagement with the firm of Steel, Bolt, Hardy, and Company, and am now on the point of going to sea.\"  Baldwin looked at his companion in surprise.  \"Going to sea!\" he repeated, \"why, I thought you didn't like the sea?\"  \"You thought right, Baldwin, but men are sometimes under the necessity of submitting to what they don't like.  I have no love for the sea, except, indeed, as a beautiful object to be admired from the shore, but, you see, I want to finish my education by going a voyage as one of the subordinate engineers in an ocean-steamer, so as to get some practical acquaintance with marine engineering.  Besides, I have taken a fancy to see something of foreign parts before settling down vigorously to my profession, and--\"  \"Well?\" said Baldwin, as the youth made rather a long pause.  \"Can you keep a secret, Baldwin, and give advice to a fellow who stands sorely in need of it?\"  The youth said this so earnestly that the huge diver, who was a sympathetic soul, declared with much fervour that he could do both.  \"You must know, then,\" began Edgar with some hesitation, \"the fact is-- you're such an old friend, Baldwin, and took such care of me when I was a boy up to that sad time when I lost my father, and you lost an employer--\"  \"Ay, the best master I ever had,\" interrupted the diver.  \"That--that I think I may trust you; in short, Baldwin, I'm over head and ears with a young girl, and--and--\"  \"An' your love ain't requited--eh?\" said Baldwin interrogatively, while his weatherbeaten face elongated.  \"No, not exactly that,\" rejoined Edgar, with a laugh.  \"Aileen loves me almost, I believe, as well as I love her, but her father is dead against us.  He scorns me because I am not a man of wealth.\"  \"What is _he_?\" demanded Baldwin.  \"A rich China merchant.\"  \"He's more than that,\" said Baldwin.  \"Indeed!\" said Edgar, with a surprised look; \"what more is he?\"  \"He's a goose!\" returned the diver stoutly.  \"Don't be too hard on him, Baldwin.  Remember, I hope some day to call him father-in-law.  But why do you hold so low an opinion of him?\"  \"Why, because he forgets that riches may, and often do, take to themselves wings and fly away, whereas broad shoulders, and deep chest, and sound limbs, and a good brain, usually last the better part of a lifetime; and a brave heart will last for ever.\"  \"I am afraid that I have yet to prove, to myself as well as to the old gentleman, that the brave heart is mine,\" returned Edgar.  \"As to the physique--you may be so far right, but he evidently undervalues that.\"  \"I said nothing about physic,\" returned Baldwin, who still frowned as he thought of the China merchant, \"and the less that you and I have to do wi' that the better.  But what are you goin' to do, sir?\"  \"That is just the point on which I want to have your advice.  What ought I to do?\"  \"Don't run away with her, whatever you do,\" said Baldwin emphatically.  The youth laughed slightly as he explained that there was no chance whatever of his doing that, because Aileen would never consent to run away or to disobey her father.  \"Good--good,\" said the diver, with still greater emphasis than before, \"I like that.  The gal that would sacrifice herself and her lover sooner than disobey her father--even though he is a goose--is made o' the right stuff.  If it's not takin' too great a liberty, Mister Edgar, may I ask what she's like?\"  \"What she's like--eh?\" murmured the other, dropping his head as if in reverie, and stroking the dark shadow on his chin which was beginning to do duty for a beard.  \"Why, she--she's like nothing that I ever saw on earth before.\"  \"No!\" ejaculated Baldwin, elevating his eyebrows a little, as he said gravely, \"what, not even like an angel?\"  \"Well, yes; but even that does not sufficiently describe her.  She's fair,\"--he waxed enthusiastic here,--\"surpassingly fair, with wavy golden tresses and blue eyes, and a bright complexion and a winning voice, and a sylph-like figure and a thinnish but remarkably pretty face--\"  \"Ah!\" interrupted Baldwin, with a sigh, \"I know: just like my missus.\"  \"Why, my good fellow,\" cried Edgar, unable to restrain a fit of laughter, \"I do not wish to deny the good looks of Mrs Baldwin, but you know that she's uncommonly ruddy and fat and heavy, as well as fair.\"  \"Ay, an' forty, if you come to that,\" said the diver.  \"She's fourteen stun if she's an ounce; but let me tell you, Mister Edgar, she wasn't always heavy.  There _was_ a time when my Susan was as trim and taut and clipper-built as any Aileen that ever was born.\"  \"I have no doubt of it whatever,\" returned the youth, \"but I was going to say, when you interrupted me, it is her eyes that are her strong point--her deep, liquid, melting blue eyes, that look at you so earnestly, and seem to pierce--\"  \"Ay, just so,\" interrupted the diver; \"pierce into you like a gimblet, goin' slap agin the retina, turnin' short down the jugular, right into the heart, where they create an agreeable sort o' fermentation.  Oh! Don't I know?--my Susan all over!\"  Edgar's amusement was tinged slightly with disgust at the diver's persistent comparisons.  However, mastering his feelings, he again demanded advice as to what he should do in the circumstances.  \"You han't told me the circumstances yet,\" said the diver quietly.  \"Well, here they are.  Old Mr Hazlit--\"  \"What!  Hazlit?  Miss Hazlit, is _that_ her name?\" cried Baldwin, with a look of pleased surprise.  \"Yes, do you know her?\"  \"Know her?  Of course I do.  Why, she visits the poor in my district o' the old town--you know I'm a local preacher among the Wesleyans--an' she's one o' the best an' sweetest--ha!  Angel indeed!  I'm glad she wasn't made an angel of, for it would have bin the spoilin' of a splendid woman.  Bless her!\"  The diver spoke with much enthusiasm, and the young man smiled as he said, \"Of course I add Amen to your last words.--Well then,\" he continued, \"Aileen's father has refused to allow me to pay my addresses to his daughter.  He has even forbidden me to enter his house, or to hold any intercourse whatever with her.  This unhappy state of things has induced me to hasten my departure from England.  My intention is to go abroad, make a fortune, and then return to claim my bride, for the want of money is all that the old gentleman objects to.  I cannot bear the thought of going away without saying good-bye, but that seems now unavoidable, for he has, as I have said, forbidden me the house.\"  Edgar looked anxiously at his companion's face, but received no encouragement there, for Baldwin kept his eyes on the ground, and shook his head slowly.  \"If the old gentleman has forbid you his house, of course you mustn't go into it.  However, it seems to me that you might cruise about the house and watch till Sus--Aileen, I mean--comes out; but I don't myself quite like the notion of that either, it don't seem fair an' above-board like.\"  \"You are right,\" returned Edgar.  \"I cannot consent to hang about a man's door, like a thief waiting to pounce on his treasure when it opens.  Besides, he has forbidden Aileen to hold any intercourse with me, and I know her dear nature too well to subject it to a useless struggle between duty and inclination.  She is certain to obey her father's orders at any cost.\"  \"Then, sir,\" said Baldwin decidedly, \"you'll just have to go afloat without sayin' good-bye.  There's no help for it, but there's this comfort, that, bein' what she is, she'll like you all the better for it.--Now, here we are at the pier.  Boat a-hoy-oy!\"  In reply to the diver's hail a man in a punt waved his hand, and pulled for the landing-place.  A few strokes of the oar soon placed them on the deck of a large clumsy vessel which lay anchored off the entrance to the harbour.  This was the diver's barge, which exhibited a ponderous crane with a pendulous hook and chain in the place where its fore-mast should have been.  Several men were busied about the deck, one of whom sat clothed in the full dress of a diver, with the exception of the helmet, which was unscrewed and lay on the deck near his heavily-weighted feet.  The dress was wet, and the man was enjoying a quiet pipe, from all which Edgar judged that he was resting after a dive.  Near to the plank on which the diver was seated there stood the chest containing the air-pumps.  It was open, the pumps were in working order, with two men standing by to work them. Coils of india-rubber tubing lay beside it.  Elsewhere were strewn about stones for repairing the pier, and various building tools.  \"Has Machowl come on board yet?\" asked Baldwin, as he stepped on the deck.  \"Ah, I see he has.--Well, Rooney lad, are you prepared to go down?\"  \"Yis, sur, I am.\"  Rooney Machowl, who stepped forward as he spoke, was a fine specimen of a man, and would have done credit to any nationality.  He was about the middle height, very broad and muscular, and apparently twenty-three years of age.  His countenance was open, good-humoured, and good-looking, though by no means classic--the nose being turned-up, the eyes small and twinkling, and the mouth large.  \"Have you ever seen anything of this sort before?\" asked Baldwin, with a motion of his hand towards the diving apparatus scattered on the deck.  \"No sur, nothin'.\"  \"Was you bred to any trade?\"  \"Yis, sur, I'm a ship-carpenter.\"  \"An'"]]]
