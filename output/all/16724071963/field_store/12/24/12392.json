Begin with the sides by cutting them so they will pair up all right. The front edges are rounded while the back edges are rabbeted on the inside as deep as the backing to be used. The bottoms are cut as shown in the sketch. Holes about 1/2 in. deep should be bored on the inside at the proper places for the wooden pegs which hold up the shelves.  [Illustration: Completed Bookcase.]  [Illustration: Details of Bookcase]  The top and bottom boards should have the front edges rounded and sanded the same as the sides. The top board is sanded on one side only and care should be taken to get the best side up.  Now cut and fit the top back board. This is fastened to the top by means of screws. Screw two cleats to each of the sides as shown and by running screws through these into the top and bottom boards the frame is completed.  The backing which can be made of some cheap lumber is now put on. Next put in the center upright piece between the doors by means of a tenon and mortise at the top and nail at the bottom. The front edge should be rounded and the edge and sides sanded. Cut and fit the bottom rail as shown. It is fastened to the frame by means of cleats on the back side.  The doors are put together by means of a tenon and mortise. They should be rabbeted for the lattice work and the glass. This lattice work can be omitted and leaded glass put in its place which is very becoming to this kind of work.  When the case is completed it must be carefully gone over with sandpaper before any finish is applied.  A mission stain is suitable for work of this kind, but it can also be finished in \"golden oak\" which is done in the following manner: First put on a golden oak stain and after it has dried for about 2 hours, apply the filler. Let this dry about 10 minutes then rub off with an old rag. Then go over the case again with some very fine sandpaper and after seeing that all parts are free from dust and dirt the varnish can be applied. Three coats of varnish will give a beautiful glossy finish.     A LAMP STAND   A mission table lamp stand for those who use electric lights is shown in the accompanying illustration. It is suitable for either the office or the home and is very simple in design and construction. The stock should be quarter-sawed oak and it can be ordered from the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. The following pieces will be needed:    1 post, 1-1/2 in. sq. by 23 in.   1 arm, 1-/8 by 3/4 by 13-1/2 in.   1 block, 3/4 in. thick by 6 in. square.   1 block, 1 in. thick by 9 in. square.  [Illustration: Details of Lamp Stand]  Square up the base blocks and fasten them together with screws as shown in the detail sketch. A mortise, 1 in. square, is cut in the center of the blocks for the center post.. Lead weights, covered with felt, should be attached to the bottom, as shown. The post has a tenon cut on one end to fit the base, and a mortise cut in the other for the arm. Holes are bored in the arm from the ends for the wires. They can be plugged after the wires are in place. A hole is also bored in the top of the center post to connect with the holes in the arm for the lead wire.  [Illustration: Electric Lamp Stand Complete]  It is best to glue the joints together, although this is not necessary if the joints are a tight fit. Sandpaper the parts thoroughly, then stain to match the other furniture.  [Illustration: Extension Dining Table Complete]     AN EXTENSION DINING TABLE   The accompanying sketch and photograph show a simple design of an extension dining table of the mission style. It is very easy to construct and can be built at home by anyone who is at all handy with tools. It should be made of quarter-sawed oak, which can be secured at the mill ready cut to length, squared and sanded. Order the following pieces:    2 top pieces, 1 by 23 by 46 in.   2 extra leaves, 1 by 12 by 46 in.   2 rails, 3/4 by 3 by 44 in.   4 rails, 3/4 by 3 by 22 in.   2 pieces for posts, 3/4 by 8 by 24 in.   2 pieces for posts, 3/4 by 6 by 24 in.   4 pieces for feet, 3 by 3 by 14 in.   4 pieces for feet, 3 by 3 by 5 in.   4 pieces for feet, 1 by 4 by 4 in.   4 pieces moulding, 1 by 1 by 10 in.   1 piece, 1 by 12 by 27 in., birchwood.   2 brackets, 3/4 by 3 by 32 in., birchwood.   2 pieces for slide, 1-3/4 by 3 by 36 in., birchwood.   4 pieces for slide, 1 by 3 by 36 in., birchwood.  12 pieces for slide, 3/4 by 1-1/2 by 36 in., birchwood.  The feet can be made first by squaring up one end of each and beveling the other as shown in the drawing. The short pieces are fastened to the long ones by means of long screws and glue. The four square pieces should be nailed to the outer ends and holes bored in them for the casters. Prepare the pieces for the posts, and before nailing them together fasten the feet to them with long screws. Be careful to get them on square, else the table will not set level when complete. Now nail and glue the pieces forming the table together and fasten the moulding at the bottom. This moulding should have mitered corners as shown in the bottom view. Also fasten the rest piece to the top of the post, using long screws and glue.  [Illustration: Details of Dining Table]  The slides can be made next. The pieces are made and fastened together with screws as shown in the enlarged detail view. This slide, if made with care, is a good one. The center piece should be firmly fastened to the post rest with long screws. The screws that fasten into the top should be inserted from below through counter-bored holes as shown.  Miter the rails at the corners and glue them to the top. Blocks can be used on the inside if desired, which will make a much stronger construction. Screw the two brackets to the top as shown. These help to support the table when it is extended.  When complete the table should be carefully gone over with fine sandpaper, and all glue and rough spots removed. Apply stain of the desired color. This can be any one of the many mission stains supplied by the trade for this purpose.     AN OAK-BOUND CEDAR CHEST   This cedar chest for storing unused bedding or furs is not a difficult thing to make and when made, the hard oak binding takes the wear and protects the softer cedar so that the chest ought to serve several generations. Order the stock as follows:  CEDAR    2 top and bottom pieces, 7/8 by 16-1/2 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 sides, 7/8 by 18-7/8 by 34-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 ends, 7/8 by 18-7/8 by 14-3/4 in., S-2-S.  OAK    2 overhanging top pieces, 1 by 1 by 36-1/2 in., S-4-S.   2 overhanging top pieces, 1 by 1 by 18-1/2 in., S-4-S.   2 lock and hinge rails, 1 by 2-1/2 by 36-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 lock and hinge rails, 1 by 2-1/2 by 18-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 base pieces, 1 by 3-1/4 by 36-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 base pieces, 1 by 3-1/4 by 18-1/2 in., S-2-S.  [Illustration: Details of Cedar Chest]  Specify thoroughly seasoned Tennessee red cedar and plain sawed white oak and have the different pieces mill-planed and sandpapered as indicated in the stock-bill. This bill allows 1/2 in. extra on the length and the width of each piece for \"squaring up\" of all pieces except those marked to be surfaced on four sides.  Begin by squaring the sides and ends to size. Probably the best joint for the corners is the dovetail. If the worker is not experienced in woodworking, some of the more simple joints will do. It will be noted that the drawing and stock-bill call for the simplest form of joint, that in which the sides of the chest lap over the end. For the dovetail joint it will be necessary to add 2 in. more to the length of the end pieces, making them 16-3/4 in. each in the rough.  Having got the sides and ends ready, fasten them together. The perspective shows the sides fastened to the ends with ornamental headed nails. Common nails are first used, being equally spaced, and the ornamental heads are afterwards placed so as to cover their heads.  Next square the bottom and nail it to the parts just assembled. Square the top to the same size.  The base stuff is squared on one edge only. The second edge--the upper one--is to be beveled or sloped 1/8 in. to facilitate dusting and for appearance sake. Fit these base pieces to place, mitering the joints. Before fastening the parts to the chest proper, gauge a line 3/4 in. from the lower edge and to a point 4-1/2 in. from each end, cut out to this line and shape the base as shown in the drawing. Use finishing nails for fastening the base to the chest. The heads should be \"set\" so they may be covered later with a putty colored to match the finish.  In a similar manner plane up, cut and fit the back and hinge rails. These rails should be kept a \"scant\" 1/8 in. below the top edges of the chest proper. The overhang of the lid fits down over in such a way as to form a dust-proof joint between lid and chest proper.  The overhang of the lid of 1 in. by 1-in. stock may next be mitered, fitted and nailed to the lid. Thoroughly sandpaper all parts not so treated and finish as follows: Put on all the oak pieces, two coats of natural paste filler. This is best done before they are fastened in place. Directions will be found on the cans in which the filler is kept.  The red of the cedar may be heightened by applying a mahogany stain made of Bismark brown aniline and boiling water, in the proportion of 3 qt. of water to 1 oz. of aniline. If applied hot the stain will enter the wood better. When dry, sandpaper lightly with No. 00 paper, both this and the oak-filled pieces.  Fasten the oak pieces in place and give the whole exterior a very thin coat of shellac. After this has hardened, apply two coats of wax. Wax comes in paste form and is "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23991"],["title","Mission Furniture: How to Make It, Part 2 (#8)"],["body","be applied with a cloth very sparingly. Allow it to stand five or ten minutes then rub briskly with a soft dry cloth to polish. The first coat is allowed to stand 24 hours before the second is applied in a similar manner.  Another finish, known as an egg-shell gloss shellac finish, is obtained by omitting the wax and instead applying from two to five more coats of shellac. Allow each coat 24 hours in which to harden, and rub each hardened coat to a smooth finish, using curled hair, or fine steel wool, or fine oiled sandpaper, before applying the next.  [Illustration: Cedar Chest Complete]  The metal reinforcements for the corners can be bought at a hardware store, as can the lock, hinges, and handles. These parts are applied in the usual manner--butt hinges being used.  If well made, the chest is practically airtight. The interior is all of red cedar, while the effect of the exterior in combining the light oak and the red cedar is striking.     A TOOL FOR MAKING MORTISES   In the construction of mission furniture where mortise joints are mostly used, those who cannot have access to a mortising machine will find the following method of great assistance in obtaining a true mortise, which is necessary in work of this kind.  [Illustration: Boring Holes for Tenons]  Take a block of wood, A, the exact thickness of the piece B to be mortised, and with an auger bore a hole, the same size as the width of the mortise to be made, exactly parallel to the sides of the block. This can best be done on a drill press or a wood boring machine. If no machine is available, great care should be taken in boring by hand, to get the hole as nearly true as possible. Then nail a cleat, C, on the side of the block, A, and let it extend down on piece B. Use a clamp to hold the block in place while boring out the mortise. By changing the position of the block and boring a number of holes, any length of mortise can be made. The holes should afterwards be squared up with a chisel.     A DRESSER FOR CHILD'S PLAYROOM   This dresser can be made of two kinds of wood as marked on the drawing or it can be made all of one kind. The original dresser was made of oak and walnut and was finished natural, the contrast between the light and dark woods adding much to the value of the piece in the eyes of the little ones. Have all surfaces that will show well sandpapered at the mill. The following is a list of the material wanted:    4 oak posts, 1-1/2 in. square by 19-1/2 in., S-4-S.   3 walnut drawer fronts, 3/4 by 5 by 17 in., S-2-S.   6 yellow poplar drawer sides, 3/8 by 5 by 12 in., S-2-S.   3 yellow poplar backs, 3/8 by 4-1/2 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.   3 yellow poplar bottoms, 3/8 by 12 by 16-1/2 in., S-2-S.   4 oak front stretchers, 7/8 by 1-3/4 by 17-1/2 in., S-4-S.   4 oak side rails, 7/8 by 2 by 12 in., S-4-S.   2 walnut side panels, 1/4 by 11 by 14-1/2 in., S-2-S.   8 oak drawer slides, 7/8 by 2 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.   6 oak drawer guides, 1/2 by 3/4 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.   4 oak back stretchers, 7/8 by 2 by 17-1/2 in., S-2-S.   1 oak top, 5/8 by 14 by 20-1/2 in., S-2-S.   3 sq. ft. of 3/8 in. matched yellow pine ceiling for back.  MIRROR SUPPORT    1 walnut piece, 7/8 by 1-3/4 by 20-1/2 in., S-2-S.   1 walnut piece, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 18 in., S-2-S.   1 oak piece, 3/4 by 1-1/4 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 oak pieces, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 11 in., S-2-S.   1 walnut bracket piece, 7/8 by 1-1/4 by 5 in., S-2-S.  MIRROR FRAME PARTS    2 walnut pieces, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 12-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 walnut pieces, 7/8 by 1-1/2 by 10-1/2 in., S-2-S.   2 oak pieces, 1/4 by 3/8 by 10 in., S-4-S.   2 oak pieces, 1/4 by 3/8 by 8 in., S-4-S.   1 back, 3/16 by 8 by 10 in., soft wood.   2 cleats, 3/8 by 1-1/4 by 8 in.   1 plain mirror glass, 7-1/2 by 9-1/2 in.  [Illustration: Details of Dresser]  Begin by planing the four posts to length. The lower ends should be slightly beveled to prevent their slivering. Cut the mortises for the tenons that are on the ends of the side rails. These rails are to be 7/8 by 2 in. and the tenons should be 3/8 by 1-1/4 in. wide by 3/4 in. long. The posts should be rabbeted down to their middles to a depth of 3/8 in. so as to receive the 1/4-in. end panels. The end rails should be cut to length and their tenons worked after one edge of each has been rabbeted as were the posts.  [Illustration: Dresser Complete]  Having squared the panels to size, put the two ends of the dresser together with glue. Next make the four frames which are to carry the drawers. They should measure from outside to outside, in length 17-1/2 in.; in width, 12-1/2 in. It is intended that the short pieces shall be tenoned into the long ones. When these frames are ready, cut out each corner as indicated in the cross section drawing. Reduce to size the drawer guides and fasten them in place. Dowel the frames to the ends of the dresser in the places indicated on the drawing. Put on the back, nailing into frames to the ends of the dresser in the places indicated and fasten the top in place, putting screws into it from the under side.  The mirror frame and support should next be made. The drawing shows quite clearly the parts and their relation to each other. All the slopes are of 45 deg. Instead of rabbeting the mirror frame, a 1/4 by 3/8-in. fillet of oak is nailed around to form the recess, the walnut frame and oak fillet making a pretty contrast. All nail holes are to be filled with putty colored to match the finish. Wooden pins or round-head screws are to be used to fasten the mirror frame to its support and should be placed above center an inch or so.  The drawers are to be constructed in the usual manner. It is a good plan to make the grooves 1/16 in. narrower than the stock is thick to insure a fit, chamfering the under or back sides of the bottom and back if necessary. Make the sides of the drawers of such a length that when the drawer has been pushed in as far as it will go, the front will be recessed about 1/4 in. behind the front crosspieces. Groove the inside of the drawer front 3/16 in. to receive the bottom. The mirror should not be placed until the wood has been finished.  [Illustration: DRAWER CONSTRUCTION]  Finish the wood natural, apply three coats of varnish. Rub the first two with haircloth or curled hair and the last with pulverized pumice stone and crude oil or raw linseed oil. This gives an egg-shell gloss. For a dull finish, rub the varnish after it has become bone dry with pulverized pumice stone and water, using a piece of rubbing felt. Rub until the surface is smooth and even, and clean with a wet sponge or chamois skin. If a polished finish is desired, rub first with pulverized pumice stone and water, then with rotten stone and water. Finish with a mixture of oil and a little pulverized rotten stone.     CUTTING TENONS WITH A HAND-SAW   This home-made tool will be a great help in the construction of mission furniture. With its use, tenons may be entirely cut with a saw, discarding the use of a chisel and mallet. The device consists of a convenient length of straight board, A, Fig. 1, wide enough to cover the widest piece to be tenoned. A piece of board, B, is fastened to A with brads or small screws. This board should have a thickness equal to the piece to be cut from the side of the tenon. The piece C is fastened to A and B with small cleats at their upper ends. The space between B and C should be wide enough for the blade of a saw to run through easily, and also long enough to take in the widest part of the saw blade. The tool and piece to be tenoned are placed in a vise as shown in Fig. 2. The width of the piece removed for the tenon may be varied by putting in pieces of cardboard between the work, E, and the piece A, Fig. 1.  [Illustration: Sawing Tenons]     ARTS AND CRAFTS OIL LAMP   Electricity and gas are not always accessible in suburban or country homes and the regular type of a mission lamp would be of little use. The illustration shows an ordinary round wick kerosene lamp fitted out in mission style.  [Illustration: Artistic Mission Style Oil Lamp]  [Illustration: Bronze Shade Holder]  A few modifications were made in the design of an expensive lamp to simplify the construction. The lamp should have a tall chimney. The dimensions given in the drawings, and the photograph, will explain themselves. Many of the details can be worked up by the maker.  The body of the lamp is made of 1/2-in. oak and is provided with openings as shown. The interior receptacle is very handy for holding a match box, smoking articles, etc.  A piece of copper band, 1 in. wide, is fastened to the body with large upholsterers' tacks, to give it a finished appearance. The base is 7/8 in. thick and in order to prevent tilting is provided with four square feet, 1/4 in. thick. The top piece of the body is 1/2-in. oak, which is provided with a hole large enough to receive the bowl of the lamp. If such a lamp is not at hand, one can be purchased at a very reasonable price.  The shade is made of oak frames set in with clouded art glass panels. The different sections of the frames are fastened together with brass screws and the glass is held in place by triangular cleats of oak. Be sure and fit the shade with cardboard panels before ordering the glass. The cardboard can be used as a pattern in cutting the glass, and the glass will then fit without recutting, which is quite difficult.  The glass beaded fringe should be of suitable color to harmonize with the finished lamp.  The shade is supported by four brackets cast in bronze from a wood pattern (dimensions given) and finished by filing, buffing and lacquering.     ANOTHER CHINA CLOSET   The china closet shown in the accompanying illustration is well proportioned and of pleasing appearance. It can be made of any one of the several furniture woods in common use, but quarter-sawed oak will be found to give the most pleasing effect. The stock should be ordered from the mill ready sawed to length, squared and sanded. In this way "]]]
