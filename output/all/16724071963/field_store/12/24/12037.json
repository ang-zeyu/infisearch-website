When crossing the channel from Normandy, in an attempt to make his ship get ahead of that of his father, he kept too close in with the shore, and consequently ran on a rock called the Shatteras.  He might have been saved; but hearing that his sister, the Countess of Perche, still remained on board, he ordered the boat in which he was escaping to put back to rescue her.  On arriving alongside, so large a number of people jumped into the boat, that she was swamped, and all were lost.  On this occasion two hundred people perished, only one, the ship's butcher, escaping to the shore, and through him the sad tidings were known.  Now, if we turn to any old illustrated History of England, we shall find, probably, a print professing to describe this very event.  Yet, on examining it, we shall see that the vessel is not large enough to carry twenty people, much less two hundred.  The artists either made their sketches from river barges, or row-boats, or drew a ship from one they saw at a distance, and having altered and adorned her to suit their own fancies afterwards, put a crew on board, utterly forgetful of the proper proportions between the ship and the men.  In the reign of the son and successor of William the Conqueror, William the Second, called Rufus, the first great crusade against the Saracen possessors of the Holy Land was commenced, in the year 1095.  To aid in that extraordinary expedition, a large fleet was fitted out in England, and placed under the command of the Earl of Essex.  The ships, as they had a long voyage to perform, and a number of armed men and provisions to carry, must have been of considerable size.  As the use of the mariner's compass was unknown to them, they must have coasted round the shores of France, Portugal, and Spain, before they entered the Mediterranean.  The Atlantic in those days was not likely to be more tranquilly disposed than it is at present, and thus the mariners must have been expert and brave, and the ships well found, or they would not have performed the voyage in safety.  We know that the Crusaders had horses, but they probably were transported from the neighbouring shores of the Mediterranean, and any favourite war-steeds which came from England were conveyed across France.  Neither Henry the First nor Stephen, from A.D. 1100 to 1135, maintained a navy, properly so-called, but on the few occasions that they required ships, they hired them of the merchants, called on the Cinque Ports to supply them, or had them built for the purpose.  Probably all vessels in those days carried oars, or long sweeps, to assist them in calms, and in going in and out of harbours; but many craft of considerable burden depended solely on oars for moving at all. There appears to be much difference of opinion as to how these oars were worked when there were several tiers, and I therefore return to the subject already touched on in the first chapter.  It is most probable that there was one space, or between decks, devoted entirely to the rowers.  This space was fitted with a succession of rows of benches one higher than the other, but not one above another.  That is to say, that the bench immediately higher than the first was placed in the interval between it and the one behind it, so that the rowers sitting on this higher bench had their feet pressed against the bench below them, others on the tier above having their feet on their bench.  As the tiers were higher and higher in the vessel's sides, the oars would be longer and longer, and would project far beyond the lower ones; indeed, they would become sweeps, and probably the inner part of each would extend completely across the vessel, and thus the upper oars on the same tier would not be opposite to each other.  The lowest tier would perhaps be pulled only by one or two men, and as the tiers rose in height, and consequently the oars in length, more men would be added.  Then, again, the lower tiers would have many more oars than the upper, and consequently even more men would be seated on the lower than on the upper benches.  This, I think, is the best solution as to the difficulty regarding the mode in which the rowers of a large galley were placed. The hold and the deck immediately below the rowers was thus left for cargo and stores, and perhaps for sleeping-places, while the deck and forecastle, and aftercastle or poop above them, were free for working the sails and for righting.  The officers, and perhaps the crew, slept under the poop and forecastle, and in other buildings on deck, as is the case on board many vessels at the present day, only the forecastles and poops were more like those of a Chinese junk than of any modern European craft.  Henry the Second, in the year 1171, collected or built a fleet of four hundred ships of great size, for the purpose of carrying over his troops for the conquest of Ireland, which country he annexed to the English crown.  These ships, as no enemy was to be encountered on the ocean, were merely transports.  Richard the First, of the Lion Heart, who began to reign 1189, fitted out a fleet, which, when assembled in the port of Messina in Sicily, in the year 1189, ready to carry his army to the shores of the Holy Land, consisted of sixteen capital ships of extraordinary burden (occupying the position of three-deckers), one hundred and fifty ordinary ships of war, and fifty-three galleys, besides vessels of less size and tenders. In his passage to Acre, known also as Ptolemais, he encountered a huge vessel of the Saracens, laden with ammunition and provisions, bound for the same place which was then besieged by the Christian army.  She was called the Dromunda, and her size was enormous.  Though she appeared like some huge castle floating on the sea, Richard ordered his galleys to attack her, and as they approached, they were received by showers of missiles, Greek fire, and other horrible combustibles.  It was no easy task to board so lofty a ship, but the king urged on his men, some of whom, jumping overboard, swam to the rudder, to which they secured ropes, and thus gained the power of steering her.  The most active now climbed up her sides, but were driven back by the overwhelming number of her defenders.  The galleys were next ordered to try the effect of their beaks; retiring to windward, and setting all their sails, as well as working away with their oars, they bore down on the Dromunda with such force and velocity, that their iron beaks pierced the sides of the monstrous ship, which instantly began to sink, and out of fifteen hundred officers and men who composed her company, the whole, with the exception of fifty-five, were drowned.  These latter were chiefly officers, none of the common men being received on board the galleys.  It is very evident that the art of shipbuilding must have made considerable progress in that part of the world, when a ship of such a size could be constructed.  The Dromunda could scarcely have been less in size than a fifty-gun ship in Nelson's day.  We here see the effect produced by rams, much in the way it is proposed to employ them in modern warfare.  There will, however, be this difference in a naval battle of the future, that both sides will be provided with these formidable implements of warfare.  Before Richard reached Acre a fierce naval engagement had taken place between the besiegers and the besieged.  The latter came out of port with their galleys two and two, preserving a similar array in their advance.  The Crusaders prepared to receive them, moving to a distance, so that they should not be denied free egress.  The Crusaders then disposed their ships in a curved line, so that if the enemy attempted to break through they might be enclosed and defeated.  In the upper tiers the shields interlaced were placed circularly, and the rowers sat close together, that those above might have freer scope.  The sea being perfectly calm, no impediment was offered to the blows of the warriors or the strokes of the rowers; advancing nearer to each other, the trumpets sounded on both sides, and mingled their dread clangour.  First, they contended with missiles, but the Crusaders more earnestly plied their oars, and pierced the enemy's ships with the beaks of their own.  Soon the battle became general; the oars became entangled, and the combatants fought hand to hand.  There was one English galley which, through the rashness of the crew, got close alongside an enemy, who set her in flames with their Greek fire.  The Saracens on this rushing in at all parts, the rowers leaped into the sea, but a few soldiers remained through desperation.  Those few overcame the many, and retook their half-burned ship.  The weapons used were swords, axes lances, arrows, and other missiles, as well as engines for casting large stones; and both Saracens and Christians employed that burning oil commonly called the Greek fire, which is said to consume both flint and iron.  It was the invention of the seventh century, and was long used with terrific effect by the Greeks, who called it the liquid fire.  It is supposed to have been composed of naphtha, pitch, and sulphur, with other ingredients.  It was propelled in a fluid state through brazen tubes from the prows of vessels and from fortifications, with as much facility as water is now thrown from the fire-engine; igniting the moment it was exposed to the air, when it became a continuous stream of fire, carrying with it torture and destruction.  Water increased its power, and it could only be extinguished by vinegar or sand; while, in addition to its other horrors, it emitted a stifling smoke, loud noise, and disgusting stench. Tow dipped in it was fastened to the heads of arrows, which thus became carriers of unquenchable flame.  It was kept in jars or large bottles. It was probably introduced into England before the time of Richard the First, for in 1195 a payment was made by the king for carrying Greek fire and other implements"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23496"],["title","How Britannia Came to Rule the Waves (#6)"],["body","London to Nottingham.  Fire-ships were, indeed, of far earlier date than the days of Richard the First.  We find them in use among the Tyrians in the time of Alexander the Great.  It is related that at the siege of Tyre, when a mole was being constructed to join that city to the continent, the inhabitants, having loaded a large ship heavily by the stern with sand and stones, for the purpose of raising her head out of the water, and having filled her with all sorts of combustible matter, they drove her violently with sails and oars against the mole, when they set fire to her, the seamen escaping in their boats.  The mole being in a great measure built of wood, with wooden towers on it, was by this device utterly destroyed.  Thus we see that the Tyrians invented and successfully employed fire-ships before the Christian era.  We are apt to consider many other discoveries modern which were known to the ancients.  For instance, an Italian author, some three centuries ago, describes a ship weighed in his time out of the lake of Riccia, where it had lain sunk and neglected for above thirteen hundred years.  It was supposed to have belonged to Trajan.  He observed, he says, \"that the pine and cypress of which it was built had lasted most remarkably.  On the outside it was built with double planks, daubed over with Greek pitch, caulked with linen rags, and over all a sheet of lead, fastened on with little copper nails.\"  Here we have caulking and sheathing together known in the first century of the Christian era; for, of course, the sheet of lead nailed over the outside with copper nails was sheathing, and that in great perfection, the copper nails being used instead of iron, which, when once rusted in the water by the working of the ship, soon lose their hold, and drop out.  Captain Saris, in a voyage to Japan in the year 1613, describes a junk of from eight to ten hundred tons burden, sheathed all over with iron. As in the days of the Plantagenets the country had not the advantage of possessing a Board of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, nor, indeed, any office in which the records of the ships built, altered, rebuilt, or pulled to pieces were kept, or, indeed, any naval records whatever, we are without the means of ascertaining what special improvements were introduced either in shipbuilding or in the fitting or manning of ships during each particular reign.  Indeed, for several centuries very slow progress appears to have been made in that art, which ultimately tended to raise England to the prosperous state she has so long enjoyed.    CHAPTER THREE.  THE NAVY IN THE DAYS OF THE PLANTAGENETS--FROM A.D. 1087 TO A.D. 1327.  William Rufus, in 1087, had scarcely a vessel which deserved the name of a ship of war.  The trade of the country, however, was carried on by small craft, of which there were great numbers; there remained also some of the transports of former years, but William when expecting the invasion of his kingdom by his brother Robert, found to his sorrow that he possessed no ships of sufficient size to compete with those of the Normans.  Being unwilling to weaken his land forces by sending them on board such ships as he possessed, he engaged all the large trading-vessels of the country, and invited mariners to embark in the transports.  He gave commissions, also, to all the traders to sink, burn, and destroy every Norman vessel they could meet with, and offered considerable rewards for every successful action.  Besides this, he published proclamations inviting all private persons to fit out vessels on their own account, encouraging them with the promise of similar rewards.  Numbers of traders accepted the commission, and the sea swarmed with privateers.  They were of small size, but were manned by bold seamen, who encouraged one another by their numbers.  Robert, who was aware that the English had no fleet, not expecting any resistance at sea, thought only of loading his transports with as many men as they could carry.  His ships were therefore ill-prepared for action, being overloaded with men, and he little expected any opposition from the small ships of the English.  The latter, meantime, obtained exact intelligence of the movements of the Normans, while they kept secret their own forces and plans.  The Normans at length sailed, and had no time to laugh at the smallness of the English ships before they began to quake at their numbers.  The latter bore down upon them like a pack of hounds on a stag, and, encouraged by the promised rewards, fought with the greatest fury.  In vain the Normans attempted to fly; they were overtaken and overpowered by the multitude of their assailants.  The number that perished by the sword and drowning was astonishing; those who attempted to escape were overtaken, and shared the fate of the others; and but few got back to Normandy with the news of their defeat.  Never was a sea-fight in which personal courage was more nobly exhibited; never a more complete victory, nor ever, apparently, slighter means of obtaining it.  The Normans called the English pirates, but they were properly privateers, and the original armament to which they were united, though a poor one, was a royal force.  William punctually paid the promised rewards.  People were generally too pleasantly employed in those mediaeval days in knocking their neighbours on the head, or in storming and demolishing their castles, and other similar pastimes on shore, to attend to any subject so unromantic as shipbuilding or navigation.  Still the monarchs of the Plantagenet race had ships of their own; but their chief notion of keeping up a navy was by laying taxes on the sea-ports, on commerce, and on the fisheries, thus crippling the surest means by which a fleet could be maintained.  The chief naval events of the intermediate reigns have been described in the preceding chapter.  John, we are told, had a naval establishment of ships and officers, with certain boards for its government.  He had not many vessels, however, as he chiefly depended on the Cinque Ports to furnish him with ships, while he laid an embargo on merchant-vessels in case of necessity; and turned them into ships of war.  He must have had a great notion, however, of keeping up the dignity of England on the ocean, as he passed an ordinance that all ships should lower their topsails to the English flag; a custom which was preserved for many centuries.  Foreigners, however, did not always show themselves willing to conform to the custom, and it was more than once the cause of quarrels between England and other nations.  Still, even at the present day, English men-of-war do not salute foreign ships in that or any other way, unless the latter pay the compliment to them first, or at the same time.  Philip Augustus of France having attacked his ally, the Earl of Flanders, the king fitted out a numerous fleet, which he placed under the command of the Earl of Salisbury, giving him directions to destroy rather than to capture any of the enemy's ships.  The Earl of Salisbury observed his instructions, and followed the movements of the enemy, waiting for an opportunity to bear down upon them.  The French ships, amounting to more than nine hundred sail, moved slowly over the sea, he watching them vigilantly, and bearing the reproaches of his officers, who thought him deficient in courage.  On the third day a slight storm having thrown the French fleet into confusion, the earl bore down upon them.  The winds had so terrified the French that they were in no condition to stand before a furious enemy.  The English, who were far better sailors, were in high courage, and so furiously assaulted the French ships that in a short time upwards of a hundred were sunk, many more running on shore, while scarcely forty got back to the ports of France.  Another important action, before-mentioned, occurred in this reign. Prince Louis, afterwards Louis the Eighth, to whose father Pope Innocent had made a liberal present of England without consulting its inhabitants, had set sail from Calais at the head of a large army, convoyed by eighty large ships of war.  Hubert de Burgo, with a great baron, Philip D'Albiney, as his lieutenant, assembled all the ships they could from the Cinque Ports, though the whole did not amount to more than half that of the French fleet.  The latter was under the command of Eustace the monk, who had formerly been in the pay of John, but had lately transferred his services to Louis.  The English ships were armed with strong beaks, like those of the Roman galleys, and their mode of attack consisted, as of yore, in charging the vessels of the enemy, and endeavouring to pierce their sides with their iron rams.  They were impelled chiefly by oars, but also carried sails, to enable them to bear down with greater speed on the enemy; hence the importance of obtaining the weather-gage.  The two fleets came in sight of each other in the Straits of Dover, on the 24th of August, 1217.  The English admirals having by their skilful manoeuvres obtained the weather-gage, bore down on the enemy with irresistible force.  In addition to other means of offence, they had brought on board a number of barrels of unslaked lime; on nearing the enemy they poured water on the lime, so as to slake the whole mass, and the smoke thus created being borne by the wind into the faces of the French, prevented them from seeing the operations of the foe till it was too late to avoid them.  The English boarded, their first endeavour being to cut away the rigging and halliards of the French ships, when the masts and sails went over the side.  Most of the French knights, preferring death to imprisonment, leaped overboard. Throwing their grapnels on board, the English made a furious onslaught on the enemy, the crossbow-men and archers, under Sir Philip D'Albiney, discharging their bows and arrows, did immense execution.  Out of the whole fleet, fifteen only escaped.  De Burgo's great aim,"]]]
