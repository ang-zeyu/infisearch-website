He liked this place because it was so lonesome and unfrequented and because he could hear the whir and splash of the great propellers directly beneath him as each big roller lifted the after part of the vessel out of the water. Here he could think about Bridgeboro and Temple Camp, and Roy Blakeley and the other scouts, and of how proud he was that he was an American through and through, and of what he was going to say to people after this when they called his father a \"no good\" and Uncle Job a \"rummy.\" He was glad he had thought about that, for back in Bridgeboro people were always saying something.  Suddenly a stern, authoritative voice spoke just behind him. \"What are you doing here?\"  In the heavy darkness Tom could just make out that the figure was in khaki and he thought it was the uniform of an officer.  \"I ain't doing anything,\" he said.  \"What did you come here for?\" the voice demanded sternly.  \"I--I don' know,\" stammered Tom, thoroughly frightened.  Quickly, deftly, the man slapped his clothing in the vicinity of his pockets.  \"Who are you?\" he demanded.  \"I'm captain's mess boy.\"  Laying his hand on Tom's shoulder, he marched him into the saloon and to the head of the companionway where the dim light from the passageway below enabled him to get a better sight of the boy. Tom was all of a tremor as the officer scrutinized him.  \"You're the fellow that read the semaphore message, aren't you?\" the officer demanded.  \"Y-yes, sir, but I didn't notice them any more since I found out I shouldn't.\" Then he mustered courage to add, \"I only went back there because it was dark and lonely, kind of. I was thinking about where I live and things----\"  The officer scrutinized him curiously for a moment and apparently was satisfied, for he only added, speaking rather harshly, \"You'd better be careful where you go at night and keep away from the ropes.\" With this he wheeled about and strode away.  For a minute or two Tom stood rooted to the spot where he stood, his heart pounding in his breast. He would not have been afraid of a whole regiment of Germans and he would probably have retained his stolid demeanor if the vessel had been sinking, but this little encounter frightened him. He wished that he had had the presence of mind to tell the officer why he had doffed his white jacket, and he wished that he had had the courage to mention how his Uncle Job had fought at Gettysburg and been buried with the flag over his coffin. Those things might have impressed the officer.  As he lay in his berth that night, his feeling of fright passed away and he was overcome with a feeling of humiliation. That _he_, Tom Slade, who had been a scout of the scouts, who had worked for the Colors, whose whole family history had been one of loyalty and patriotism, should be even---- No, of course, he had not been actually _suspected_ of anything, and he knew that the government had to be very watchful and careful, but---- Well, he felt ashamed and humiliated, that's all.  He made up his mind that if he should see that officer again, and he did not look too forbidding, he would mention how his mother had taught him to sing _America_, how his father had played the _Star-Spangled Banner_ on his old accordion and how Uncle Job had died in the Soldiers' Home. Those were about the only good things he could remember about his father and Uncle Job, but weren't they enough?  And since the government was so very particular, Tom got up and hung his coat across the porthole, though no clink of light could possibly have escaped, for his little stateroom was as dark as pitch and even when he opened his door there was only the dim light from the inner passage.     CHAPTER VIII  HE HEARS SOME NEWS AND IS CONFIDENTIAL WITH FRENCHY   The next morning there was a rumor. Somebody told somebody who told somebody else who told a deck steward who told Tom that a couple of men had gone very stealthily along the dimly lighted passageway outside the forward staterooms below, looking for a lighted stateroom.  \"There was never so much as a glint,\" the deck steward volunteered.  Instantly Tom thought of his experience of the previous night and there arose in his mind also certain passages from one of the letters he had turned over to Mr. Conne.  Acting on his benefactor's very sensible advice, he had not allowed his mind to dwell upon those mysterious things which were altogether outside his humble sphere. But now he could not help recalling that this ship had been the _Christopher Colon_ on which somebody or other had thought he might be able to sail. Well, in any event, the ship's people had those things in hand, and after his disturbing experience of the night before, he would not dare speak to one of his superiors about what was in his mind. But he was greatly interested in this whispered news.  \"The electric lights are turned off in the staterooms, anyway,\" he said.  \"Yes, but that bunch is always smoking--them engineers,\" said the deck steward, \"and a chap would naturally stick his head out of the port so as not to get the room full of smoke. All he'd have to do is drop his smoke in the ocean if anyone happened along. It's been done more'n once.\"  \"Then you don't think it was spies they suspected or--anything like that?\"  The deck steward, who was an old hand, hunched his shoulders. \"Maybe, and maybe not. You can't drum it into some men that a cigarette is like a searchlight on the ocean.\"  \"Yet the destroyers signal at night--even here in the zone,\" Tom said.  \"Not much--only when it's necessary. And the transports don't answer. It's just a little brown kind of light, too. They say the tin fish[1] can't make it out at all.\"  \"Is that where the engineers sleep--down there?\" Tom asked.  \"The chief and the first assistants up on deck; third and fourth and head fireman are down there, and two electricians. The carpenter's there, too.\"  \"Well, they didn't find anything, anyway,\" said Tom. \"Is that all they did?\"  \"Did? They opened every room on their way back and searched every nook and corner. Not so much as a pipe or a cigarette or a cigar could they find--nor a whiff of smoke neither. Besides, the port windows were locked shut and the steward had the keys! They're takin' no chances in the zone, you can bet.\"  \"I was thinking, if it was a spy or anyone like that, he might have had a flashlight,\" said Tom, \"and thrown it out if he heard anyone coming.\"  \"With the glass locked shut?\"  \"No, that spoils it,\" said Tom.  \"They searched every bloomin' one of 'em,\" said the deck steward. \"Charlie was two hours making up the berths again after the way they threw things around. But nothing doing. They found a mess plate with a little black spot on it and he said they thought it might have been from a match-end being laid there, but I heard they told the captain there was nothing wrong down there.\"  \"What made them think there was?\" asked Tom.  The deck steward shrugged his shoulders. \"You can search _me_. But they're mighty particular, huh?\"  He went about his duties, leaving Tom to ponder on this interesting news, and though admittedly nothing had come of that stealthy raid which had exposed neither rule breakers nor spies, still Tom thought about it all day, more or less, and he was glad that Uncle Sam was so watchful and thorough. It made him realize, all the more, how absurd and preposterous it would be for him, the captain's mess boy, to concern himself or ask questions or say anything about serious matters which were none of his business.  All day long they ran a zigzag course, taking a long cut to France, as Pete Connigan would have said, the general tension relieved by the emergency drills, manning the boats and so forth.  In the afternoon hours of respite from his duties he met Frenchy, whose patience had been a little tried by some of Uncle Sam's crack jolliers, and they sat down on the top step of a companionway and talked.  \"Zis I cannot bear!\" he said, shrugging his shoulders. \"To be called ze Hun! Ugh!\"  \"They're only kidding you,\" said Tom; \"fooling with you.\"  \"I do not like it--no!\"  \"But if you hadn't become an American before the war,\" said Tom, \"you couldn't have enlisted on our side because you really were a German--a German citizen--weren't you?\"  \"Subject, yess! Citizen, no! All will be changed. Alsace will be France again! We go to win her back! Yess?\"  \"Yes,\" said Tom. \"I only meant you belonged to Germany because you couldn't help it.\"  \"You are a lucky boy,\" Frenchy said earnestly. \"Zare is no--what you say?--Mix-up; Zhermany, France, America--no. You are all _American_!\"  \"I got to remember that,\" said Tom simply. \"I know some rich fellers home where I live. They let me join their scout troop, so I got to know 'em. One feller's name is Van Arlen. His father was born in Holland. They got two automobiles and a lot of servants and things. But anyway my father was born in the United States--that's one thing.\"  \"Ah,\" said Frenchy, enthusiastically, \"zat is ever'ting! You are fine boy.\"  His expression was so generous, so pleasant, that Tom could not help saying, \"I like France, too.\"  \"Listen, I will tell you,\" said Frenchy, laughing. \"It is ze old saying, 'Ever' man hass two countries; hees own and France!' You see?\"  In the warmth of Frenchy's generous admiration Tom opened up and said more than he had meant to say--more than he ever had said to anyone.  \"So I got to be proud of it, anyway,\" he said, in his honest, blunt fashion. \"Maybe you won't understand, but one thing makes me like to go away from Bridgeboro, kind of, is the way people say things about my folks. They don't do it on purpose--mostly. But anyway, all the fathers of the fellows I know, they call them Mr. Blakeley and Mr. Harris, and like that. But they always called my father Bill Slade. I didn't ever hear anybody call him Mister. But anyway, he was born in the United States--that's one sure "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23663"],["title","Tom Slade on a Transport (#7)"],["body","thing. And so was my grandfather and my grandmother, too. Once my father licked me because I forgot to hang out the flag on Decoration Day. That shows he was patriotic, doesn't it? The other day I was going to tell you about my uncle but I forgot to. He was in the Civil War--he got his arm shot off. So I got a lot to be proud about, anyway. Just because my father didn't get a job most--most of the time----\"  \"Ah!\" vociferated Frenchy, clapping him on the shoulder. \"You are ze--how you say--_one_ fine boy!\"  Tom remained stolid, under this enthusiastic approval. He was thinking how glad and proud he was that his father had licked him for forgetting to hang out the flag. It had not been a licking exactly, but a beating and kicking, but this part of it he did not remember. He was very proud of his father for it. It was something to boast about. It showed that the Slades----  \"Yess, you are a fine boy!\" said Frenchy again, clapping him on the shoulder with such vehemence as to interrupt his train of thought. \"Zey must be fine people--all ze way back--to haf' such a boy. You see?\"  FOOTNOTE: [1] Submarines.     CHAPTER IX  HE SEES A STRANGE LIGHT AND GOES ON TIPTOE   Of course, it would have been expecting too much to suppose that the boys in khaki would overlook Tom Slade any more than Frenchy would escape them, and \"Whitey\" was the bull's-eye for a good deal of target practice in the way of jollying. It got circulated about that Whitey had a bug--a patriotic bug, particularly in regard to his family, and it was whispered in his hearing as he came and went that his grandfather was none other than the original Yankee Doodle.  Of course, Tom's soberness increased this good-natured propensity of the soldiers.  \"Hey, Whitey,\" they would call as he passed with the captain's tray, \"I hear you were born on the Fourth of July. How about that?\"  Or  \"Hey, Whitey, I hear your great grandfather was the fellow that put the bunk in Bunker Hill!\"  But Tom did not mind; joking or no joking, they knew where he stood with Uncle Sam and that was enough for him.  Sometimes they would vary their tune and pleasantly chide him with being a secret agent of the Kaiser, \"Baron von Slade,\" and so on and so on. He only smiled in that stolid way of his and went about his duties. In his heart he was proud. Sometimes they would assume to be serious and ply him with questions, and he would fall into their trap and proudly tell about poor old Uncle Job and of how his father had licked him, by way of proving the stanch Americanism of the Slades.  In their hearts they all liked him; he seemed so \"easy\" and bluntly honest, and his patriotism was so obvious and so sincere.  \"You're all right, Whitey,\" they would say.  Then, suddenly, that thing happened which shocked and startled them with all the force of a torpedo from a U-boat, and left them gasping.  It happened that same night, and little did Tom Slade dream, as he went along the deck in the darkening twilight, carrying the captain's empty supper dishes down to the galley, of the dreadful thing which he would face before that last night in the danger zone was over.  He washed his hands, combed his hair, put on his dark coat, and went up on deck for an hour or two which he could call his own. In the companionway he passed his friend, the deck steward, talking with a couple of soldiers, and as he squeezed past them he paused a moment to listen.  It was evidently another slice of the same gossip with which he had regaled Tom earlier in the day and he was imparting it with a great air of confidence to the interested soldiers.  \"Don't say I told you, but they had two of them in the quartermaster's room, buzzing them. It's more'n rule breaking, _I_ think.\"  \"German agents, you mean?\"  The deck steward shrugged his shoulders in that mysterious way, as if he could not take the responsibility of answering that question.  \"But they haven't got anything on 'em,\" he added. \"The glass ports were locked--they couldn't have thrown anything out. So there you are. The captain thinks it was phosphorus and maybe he's right. It's a kind of a light you sometimes see in the ocean.\"  \"Huh,\" said one of the soldiers.  \"It's fooled others before. So I guess there won't be any more about it. Keep your mouths shut.\"  Tom passed them and went out upon the deck. He did not venture near the forbidden spot astern, but leaned against the rail amidships. He knew he had the right to spend his time off on deck and he liked to be alone. Now and then he glimpsed a little streak of gray as some apprehensive person in a life belt disappeared in a companionway, driven in by the cold and the rough sea.  Presently, he was quite alone and he fell to thinking about home, as he usually did when he was alone at night. He thought of his friend Roy Blakeley and of the happy summers spent at Temple Camp; of the stalking and tracking, and campfire yarns, and how they used to jolly him, just as these soldiers jollied him, and call him \"Sherlock Nobody Holmes\" just because he was interested in deduction and had \"doped out\" one or two little things.  One thing will suggest another, and from Temple Camp, with its long messboard and its clamoring, hungry scouts, and the tin dishes heaped with savory hunters' stew, his thoughts wandered back across the ocean to a certain particular mess plate, right here on this very ship--a mess plate with a little black stain on it, where someone might have laid a burning match-end.  He caught himself up and thought of Mr. Conne. But this was his time off and he had the right to _think_ about anything he pleased. He could not be reprimanded for just thinking. Nothing would tempt him to run the risk of another encounter with one of those stern, brisk-speaking officers, but he could _think_.  And he wondered whether that black spot _had_ been made by a match-end. The spot would show plainly, of course, for he knew how shiny and clean mess plates were kept. Had he not done his part in scouring and rubbing them down there in the galley?  He wondered how the mess plate had happened to be in the stateroom, anyway. Sherlock Nobody Holmes again! But the crew, as well as the troops, carried their supper wherever they pleased to eat it. So there was nothing so strange about that. If there had been, why, Uncle Sam's all-seeing eye would not have missed it.  He fell to thinking of Bridgeboro again. And he thought of Adolf Schmitt and----  A phrase from one of those letters ran through his mind--_It's the same idea as a periscope_.  For a moment Tom Slade felt just as so often he had felt when he had found an indistinct footprint along a woodland trail. _What_ was the same idea as a periscope? What was a periscope, anyway?  Why, a thing on a submarine by means of which you could look two ways at once--you could look up through the ocean and across the ocean--all with one look.  He wondered whether Mr. Conne had noticed that rather puzzling phrase and whether the people on this ship had seen that letter. Mr. Conne had seemed to think that one the least important of the lot. Perhaps he had just told the ship's people to look out for spies. And they would do that anyway. The names of uniformed spies in the army cantonments--names in black and white--that was the important thing--the big discovery.  But Tom Slade was only a humble Sherlock Nobody Holmes and he couldn't get that phrase out of his head.  _It's the same idea as a periscope._  A periscope is a kind of a--a kind of a----  Tom's brow was knit, just as when he used carefully and anxiously to move the grass away from an all but obliterated footprint, and his eyes were half closed and keen.  \"I know what it is,\" he said to himself, suddenly. \"It means how light can be passed through a room even while the room is dark all the time--kind of reflected--and you wouldn't have to use any match.\"  He stood still, almost frightened at his own conclusion. The clean, shiny mess plate and the phrase out of that letter seemed to fit together like the sections of a picture puzzle. The black spot and the match-end (if there was any match-end) meant just nothing at all. The dim light out in the passageway down below hardly reached the dark staterooms, but----  He could not remember just how it was down there, but he knew that in the staterooms where the glass ports were locked (and that was the case with all of the crews' quarters below) air was admitted by a slightly opened panel transom over the door.  What should he do? Go and tell an officer about his discovery? If it _were_ a discovery that would be all very well. But after all, this was only a--a kind of a _deduction_. And they might laugh at him. He had always stood in awe of the officers and since last night he was mortally afraid of them. If he told any of the soldiers or even the steward they would only jolly him. He did not know exactly what he had better do.  He made up his mind that he would go down through the passageway where those under engineers and electricians slept and see how it looked down there. He had been through there many times, but he thought that perhaps he would notice some thing now which would help to prove his theory and then perhaps they would listen to the captain's mess boy if he could muster the courage to speak.  He had just left the rail when he saw, some distance to starboard as it seemed, and well forward of the ship, an infinitesimal bluish brown spark. How he happened to notice it he did not know. \"Once a scout, always a scout,\" perhaps. In any event, it was only by fixing his eyes intently upon it that he could keep it in sight. And even so, he lost it after a few seconds. He tried to find it again, but quite in vain. It had been about as conspicuous as a snowflake would have been in a glass of milk.  \"Huh, if there's anyone on this ship can see _that_, he must be a peach. Maybe up in the rigging you can see it better, though. If it's on the destroyer, she's quite a ways ahead of us----\"  He"]]]
