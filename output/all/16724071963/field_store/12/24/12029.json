At present it is called the Santiago.  Turtles of large size were found here, and, as a proof how so sagacious a man as Columbus might deceive himself, he states that he here saw three mermaids, who were very far from lovely, although they had traces of human countenances.  They were undoubtedly manatees or sea-cows.  Putting into the river where Pinzon had been trading, some of the natives complained that he had violently carried off four men and two girls to be sold as slaves in Spain.  Discovering that such was the case, Columbus ordered that they should be restored immediately to their homes, and, giving them numerous presents and clothing, he sent them on shore.  Proceeding on, they anchored in a deep gulf a little way beyond Cape Cabron.  The natives were found to be of a ferocious aspect, hideously painted.  Their hair was long, tied behind, and decorated with coloured feathers; some were armed with war-clubs; others had bows as long as those used by English archers, with slender reed arrows pointed with bone or the teeth of a fish.  Their swords were of palm wood, as hard and heavy as iron, not sharp, but broad, and capable, with one blow, of cleaving through a helmet.  Columbus fancied that they must be Caribs, but an Indian on board assured him that the Caribbean Islands were much farther off.  They made no attempt, however, at first, to molest the Spaniards.  One of them came on board the Admiral's ship.  Various presents having been given him, he was sent again on shore in one of the boats.  As she approached, upwards of fifty savages, armed with bows, arrows, war-clubs, and javelins, were seen lurking among the trees.  The Indian, however, speaking to them, they laid by their arms, and parted with two of their bows to the Spaniards.  Suddenly, however, mistrusting their visitors, they rushed back to where they had left their weapons, and returned with cords as if to bind the Spaniards.  The latter on this immediately attacked them, wounded two, and put the rest to flight, and would have pursued them had they not been restrained by the commander of the boat.  This was the first time native blood, soon to flow so freely, was shed by the white man in the New World.  It greatly grieved Columbus thus to see his efforts to maintain a friendly intercourse frustrated.  Next day, notwithstanding the above occurrence, when a large party went on shore, the cacique who ruled over the neighbourhood came down to meet them, and sent a wampum belt as a token of amity.  The cacique, with only three attendants, without fear entered the boat, and was conveyed on board the caravel.  Columbus highly appreciated this frank, confiding conduct, and, having placed biscuits and honey and other food before his guests, shown them round the ship, and made them several presents, he sent them back to the land highly gratified.  No other interruption occurred to their friendly intercourse.  Four young Indians who came on board gave such glowing accounts of the islands to the east, that Columbus prevailed on them to accompany him as guides.  He also wished to visit two islands which he fancied to exist,--one inhabited by Amazons, and the other by men; but a favourable breeze springing up for Spain, and observing the gloom in the countenances of the seamen,-- knowing as he did also their insubordinate spirit, and the leaky state of the ships, and that, should they founder, his glorious discovery would be lost to the civilised world,--he deemed it wise to steer directly homewards.  The favourable breeze, however, soon died away, and for the remainder of the voyage light winds from the eastward prevailed.  The _Pinta_ also sailed badly, her foremast being so defective that it could carry but little sail.  In the early part of February, having run to about the thirty-eighth degree of north latitude, they got out of the track of the trade winds, and once more were able to steer a direct course.  The pilots, by the changes of their courses, at length got perplexed; but Columbus kept so careful a reckoning that he felt sure of their position.  The two principal pilots made out that they were one hundred and fifty leagues nearer Spain than he knew to be the case.  He, however, allowed them to remain in their error, that he alone might possess a knowledge of the route to the newly-discovered countries.  By his calculation they were not far off from the Azores.  On the 12th of February a strong gale with a heavy sea got up, and the next day the wind and swell so increased that Columbus was aware that a heavy tempest was approaching.  It soon burst upon them with frightful violence, increasing still more on the 14th, the waves threatening every moment to overwhelm their battered barks.  After laying to for three hours they were compelled to scud before the wind.  During the darkness of the night the _Pinta_ was lost sight of.  The Admiral steered as well as he could to the north-east to approach the coast of Spain, showing lights to the _Pinta_; but no answering signals were seen, and fears were entertained that she had foundered.  The following day the tempest raged as furiously as before on the helpless bark.  During the storm the ignorant and superstitious crew cast lots as to who should perform pilgrimages to their respective saints, in which the Admiral, no less superstitious than his men, joined.  Two of the lots fell on him.  Each man also made his private vow to perform some pilgrimage, or other penitential rite.  The heavens, however, were deaf to their vows.  The storm increased, and the crew gave themselves up for lost.  The Admiral took the wisest steps to preserve the ship, by ordering that the empty casks should be filled with water, to ballast her better.  His mind all the time was a prey to the most painful anxiety.  His fear was that the _Pinta_ had already foundered, and that his vessel would also go to the bottom.  An expedient occurred to him at this time by which, though he and his ships should perish, the glory of his achievement might survive to his name, and its advantages be secured to his sovereigns.  He wrote on a parchment a brief account of his voyage and discovery; then, having sealed and directed it to the King and Queen, he wrapped it in a waxed cloth, which he placed in the centre of a piece of wax, and, enclosing the whole in a large cask, threw it into the sea.  He also enclosed a copy in a similar manner, placing the cask on the poop so that it might float off should the vessel sink.  These precautions somewhat mitigated his anxiety.  Towards sunset a streak of clear sky appeared in the west, the sign of finer weather.  It came, though the sea ran so high that little sail could be carried.  At daybreak on the morning of the 15th the cry of \"Land!\" was raised. The transports of the crew equalled those exhibited on first beholding the New World.  Various conjectures were offered as to what land it was. Some thought it the rock of Cintra, others the island of Madeira, others a portion of Spain.  Columbus, however, knew that it was one of the Azores, in possession of the Portuguese.  On the evening of the 17th of February the vessel dropped her anchor off the island of Saint Mary's, the most southern of the Azores, and at length the great navigator was enabled to enjoy the first moments of sleep he had taken for many a day.  Next morning the inhabitants were astonished, on seeing the battered vessel, that she had been able to live through the gale, which had, with unexampled fury, raged for fifteen days.  Three seamen who had landed were persuaded to remain and give an account of their adventures.  After some time the Governor, Juan de Castaneda, who claimed an acquaintance with Columbus, sent off fowls, bread, and various refreshments, apologising for not coming himself, on account of the lateness of the hour.  On the following morning Columbus reminded his people of their vows, to go in procession to the shrine of the Virgin at the first place where they should land.  The messengers who had been kept on board were sent to make preparations, and a priest arrived at a small chapel dedicated to the Virgin some little distance off.  One-half of the crew then landed and walked in procession, barefooted and in their shirts, to the chapel, while the Admiral waited their return to perform the same ceremony with the remainder.  Scarcely, however, had the first party begun their prayers than they were surrounded by a gang of horse and foot from the village, and made prisoners.  As the hermitage could not be seen from the caravel, not being aware of what had taken place, the Admiral feared that his boat had been wrecked, and accordingly, weighing anchor, he stood in a direction to command a view of the chapel.  He now caught sight of a number of armed horsemen, who, dismounting, entered the boat, and came towards the caravel.  He accordingly got ready to give them a warm reception, but they approached in a pacific manner, and Castaneda himself, who was in the boat, asked leave to come on board.  Columbus reproached him for his perfidy, to which he replied that he was only acting in accordance with the orders of his sovereigns, so that Columbus began to fear that a war had broken out between the two countries during his absence.  He had no time to ascertain the truth before another heavy gale coming on, he was driven from his anchorage, and compelled to stand out to sea.  For two days the vessel remained in the greatest peril, short-handed as she was, being unable to return to her anchorage at Saint Mary's.  As soon as she dropped anchor, a notary and two priests came off demanding to see his papers on the part of Castaneda, who had sent them to assure him that if it should be found that he really sailed in the service of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/23494"],["title","Notable Voyagers, From Columbus to Nordenskiold (#8)"],["body","sovereigns, he would render him every assistance in his power.  The notary and priest were satisfied with his letters of commission, and the following morning the boat and seamen were sent back.  From the latter Columbus learnt the cause of Castaneda's conduct.  The inhabitants had told them that the King of Portugal, jealous lest his expedition should interfere with his discoveries in India, had directed his governors of islands and distant ports to seize and detain him wherever he should be met with.  Having been detained two days longer at Saint Mary's in an endeavour to take in wood and ballast, but being prevented by the heavy surf which broke upon the shore, he set sail on the 24th of February.  After a fine run of two days the weather again became tempestuous, and there appeared every probability of the ship foundering.  On the 3rd of March land was descried, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the ship could be kept off the shore.  At daylight on the 4th the voyagers found themselves off the rock of Cintra, a few miles from Lisbon.  Rather than risk another night at sea, Columbus determined to hazard the chance of falling into the hands of the Portuguese.  The ship was accordingly steered in and brought up opposite Rastello, at the mouth of the river Tagus.  The oldest mariners who came off assured Columbus that they had never known so temptestuous a winter, and had been watching his vessel with the greatest anxiety since she had first been seen.  He immediately dispatched a courier to the King and Queen of Spain with the tidings of his discovery, and requested permission of the King of Portugal to go up to Lisbon, fearing that the inhabitants of Rastello, when they heard of her rich freight, might be tempted to rob her.  The King of Portugal, who was some distance from the capital, at once invited Columbus to visit him.  During the interview which ensued he endeavoured to conceal his vexation at having refused the proposals which had been made him by the navigator.  His Court tried to persuade him that Columbus had visited countries over which, according to the Pope's bull, he had the right to rule.  Some had the baseness to hint that Columbus should be assassinated, and suggested that he should be embroiled in a quarrel, during which the project might be accomplished.  The King, happily, had too much magnanimity to agree to so nefarious a measure.  He treated Columbus with the greatest courtesy, and a large party of cavaliers escorted him back to his ship.  By the time Columbus reached her the weather had moderated, and, again setting sail, on the 15th of March, A.D. 1493, he entered the port of Palos, whence he had sailed on the 3rd of August of the preceding year, having taken not quite seven months and a half to accomplish this momentous maritime enterprise.  The enthusiastic reception he met with from the inhabitants of Palos can be imagined.  They had given him and his companions up for lost.  Bells were rung and the shops shut; all business was suspended; and the inhabitants came thronging to the ship to ascertain the fate of their friends.  On landing, he went to the principal church, accompanied by a concourse of people, to return thanks to God for the accomplishment of his enterprise.  As the Court was at Barcelona, he felt inclined to go there in his caravel, but, considering her condition, he finally resolved to proceed by land.  That very evening, while the bells were sending forth their peals of triumph, the _Pinta_, commanded by Martin Alonzo Pinzon, entered the river.  Pinzon had been driven by the gale into the Bay of Biscay, and had reached the port of Bayonne.  Fancying that Columbus had perished, he had written to the sovereigns claiming credit to himself for the accomplishment of the undertaking.  On hearing that Columbus had arrived before him, his heart sank within him.  He made his way unobserved to his own house, and, on receiving a reproachful letter from Ferdinand and Isabella, he took to his bed, and in a short time died of deep chagrin on seeing Columbus receive all the honours he had himself hoped to obtain.  Columbus, having performed the journey to Barcelona in safety, was received with the greatest possible respect by Ferdinand and Isabella, whose nobles and courtiers vied with each other in endeavouring to do him honour.  His entrance into the city was like a Roman triumph.  The courtiers and hidalgos, and a vast concourse of people, came forth to meet him.  Before him were paraded the Indians, decked out according to their savage fashion, and after these were borne various kinds of live parrots, stuffed birds and animals, and rare plants; while there was a conspicuous display of Indian coronets, bracelets, and other decorations of gold.  Columbus followed on horseback, accompanied by a brilliant cavalcade of Spanish chivalry.  The windows and balconies were crowded with the fair; the very roofs were covered with spectators.  The King and the kind Queen awaited his arrival seated on a throne, in a vast and splendid saloon, under a rich canopy of brocade of gold.  They raised him as he attempted to kneel, and had a seat placed for him near them,--a rare honour in so punctilious a Court.  He here narrated his adventures, to which they listened with wrapt attention; and, when he retired from the royal presence, he was attended by the whole Court to his residence.  Ferdinand and Isabella setting the example for many days, all the nobles of the land exerted themselves to do him honour.  He modestly received all the attentions paid to him.  Though his mind was teeming with magnificent schemes for the future, he did not forget that for the deliverance of the Holy Sepulchre, and believing that ere long vast wealth would accrue to him, he made a vow to furnish, within seven years, an army of four thousand horse and fifty thousand foot, for the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre, and a similar force within the five following years.  Not only Spain, but all the civilised nations of the earth rejoiced at the important discovery achieved by Columbus.  In England especially it excited that spirit of discovery which was ere long to add so greatly to her wealth and renown.  During his sojourn at Barcelona the sovereigns took every occasion to bestow on Columbus personal marks of their high consideration. Frequently the King appeared on horseback, with Prince Juan on one side and Columbus on the other.  To perpetuate in his family the glory of his achievement, a coat of arms was assigned him, in which the royal arms--the castle and lion--were quartered with his proper bearings, which were a group of islands surrounded by waves.  To these arms were added the words--  \"A Castella y a Leon Nuevo Mundo dio Colon.\"  \"To Castile and Leon Columbus gave a new world.\"    CHAPTER FOUR.  SECOND VOYAGE OF COLUMBUS--A.D. 1403.

We must briefly follow the adventures of Columbus to their termination. In spite of the efforts of Don John, King of Portugal, to reap advantage from the discovery of Columbus, Ferdinand and Isabella obtained from the Pope a bull, making over the newly-discovered lands and all such others as might be discovered to the crown of Castile.  The utmost exertions were at once made to fit out a second expedition.  The affairs of the New World were placed under the superintendence of Juan Rodrigues de Foneseca, Archdeacon of Seville, who was finally appointed Patriarch of the Indies.  He was a worldly man, malignant and vindictive.  He not only wronged the early discoverers, but frequently impeded the progress of their enterprises.  Other men of similar character were associated with him.  A royal order was issued that all ships in the ports of Andalusia, with their captains, pilots, and crews, should be held in readiness to serve in the expedition.  Columbus and Foneseca were authorised to freight or purchase any of those vessels they might think proper, and overcome them by force if refused.  To provide for the expenses of the expedition, a royal revenue arising from Church tithes was placed at the disposal of the treasurer Pincello, and further funds were derived from the jewels and other valuables, the sequestrated property of the unfortunate Jews, banished from the kingdom according to the bigoted edict of the preceding year.  As the conversion of the heathen was professed to be the grand object of this expedition, twelve zealous and able ecclesiastics were directed to accompany it.  At"]]]
