AS LUCY WENT A-WALKING       As Lucy went a-walking one wintry morning fine,     There sate three crows upon a bough, and three times three is nine:     Then 'O!' said Lucy, in the snow, 'it's very plain to see     A witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'      Then stept she light and heedfully across the frozen snow,     And plucked a bunch of elder-twigs that near a pool did grow:     And, by and by, she comes to seven shadows in one place     All stretched by seven poplar-trees against the sun's bright face.      She looks to left, she looks to right, and in the midst she sees     A little well of water clear and frozen 'neath the trees;     Then down beside its margent in the crusty snow she kneels,     And hears a magic belfry a-ringing with sweet bells.      But when the belfry ceased to sound yet nothing could she see,     Save only frozen water in the shadow of the tree.     But presently she lifted up her eyes along the snow,     And sees a witch in brindled shawl a-frisking to and fro.      Her shoes were buckled scarlet that capered to and fro,     And all her rusty locks were wreathed with twisted mistletoe;     But never a dint, or mark, or print, in the whiteness for to see,     Though danced she high, though danced she fast, though danced she         lissomely.      It seemed 'twas diamonds in the air, or little flakes of frost;     It seemed 'twas golden smoke around, or sunbeams lightly tost;     It seemed an elfin music like to reeds and warblers rose:     'Nay!' Lucy said, 'it is the wind that through the branches flows.'      And as she peeps, and as she peeps, 'tis no more one, but three,     And eye of bat, and downy wing of owl within the tree,     And the bells of that sweet belfry a-pealing as before,     And now it is not three she sees, and now it is not four.      'O! who are ye,' sweet Lucy cries, 'that in a dreadful ring,     All muffled up in brindled shawls, do caper, frisk, and spring?'     'A witch and witches, one and nine,' they straight to her reply,     And looked upon her narrowly, with green and needle eye.      Then Lucy sees in clouds of gold sweet cherry-trees upgrow,     And bushes of red roses that bloomed above the snow;     She smells all faint the almond-boughs that blow so wild and fair,     And doves with milky eyes ascend fluttering in the air.      Clear flow'rs she sees, like tulip buds, go floating by like birds,     With wavering tips that warbled sweetly strange enchanted words;     And as with ropes of amethyst the boughs with lamps were hung,     And clusters of green emeralds like fruit upon them clung.      'O witches nine, ye dreadful nine, O witches seven and three!     Whence come these wondrous things that I this Christmas morning see?'     But straight, as in a clap, when she of Christmas says the word,     Here is the snow, and there the sun, but never bloom nor bird;      Nor warbling flame, nor gloaming-rope of amethyst there shows,     Nor bunches of green emeralds, nor belfry, well, and rose,     Nor cloud of gold, nor cherry-tree, nor witch in brindled shawl,     But like a dream which vanishes, so vanished were they all.      When Lucy sees, and only sees, three crows upon a bough,     And earthly twigs, and bushes hidden white in driven snow,     Then 'O!' said Lucy, 'three times three is nine--I plainly see     Some witch has been a-walking in the fields in front of me.'         THE ENGLISHMAN       I met a sailor in the woods,       A silver ring wore he,     His hair hung black, his eyes shone blue,       And thus he said to me:--      'What country, say, of this round earth,       What shore of what salt sea,     Be this, my son, I wander in,       And looks so strange to me?'      Says I, 'O foreign sailorman,       In England now you be,     This is her wood, and this her sky,       And that her roaring sea.'      He lifts his voice yet louder,       'What smell be this,' says he,     'My nose on the sharp morning air       Snuffs up so greedily?'      Says I, 'It is wild roses       Do smell so winsomely,     And winy briar too,' says I,       'That in these thickets be.'      'And oh!' says he, 'what leetle bird       Is singing in yon high tree,     So every shrill and long-drawn note       Like bubbles breaks in me?'      Says I, 'It is the mavis       That perches in the tree,     And sings so shrill, and sings so sweet,       When dawn comes up the sea.'      At which he fell a-musing,       And fixed his eye on me,     As one alone 'twixt light and dark       A spirit thinks to see      'England!' he whispers soft and harsh,       'England!' repeated he,     'And briar, and rose, and mavis,       A-singing in yon high tree.      'Ye speak me true, my leetle son,       So--so, it came to me,     A-drifting landwards on a spar,       And grey dawn on the sea.      'Ay, ay, I could not be mistook;       I knew them leafy trees,     I knew that land so witcherie sweet,       And that old noise of seas.      'Though here I've sailed a score of years,       And heard 'em, dream or wake,     Lap small and hollow 'gainst my cheek,       On sand and coral break;      '\"Yet now, my leetle son,\" says I,       A-drifting on the wave,     \"That land I see so safe and green       Is England, I believe.      '\"And that there wood is English wood,       And this here cruel sea,     The selfsame old blue ocean       Years gone remembers me,      \"A-sitting with my bread and butter       Down ahind yon chitterin' mill;     And this same Marinere\"--(that's me),       \"Is that same leetle Will!--      \"That very same wee leetle Will       Eating his bread and butter there,     A-looking on the broad blue sea       Betwixt his yaller hair!\"      'And here be I, my son, throwed up       Like corpses from the sea,     Ships, stars, winds, tempests, pirates past,       Yet leetle Will I be!'      He said no more, that sailorman,       But in a reverie     Stared like the figure of a ship       With painted eyes to sea.         THE PHANTOM       'Upstairs in the large closet, child,       This side the blue-room door,     Is an old Bible, bound in leather,       Standing upon the floor;      'Go with this taper, bring it me;       Carry it on your arm;     It is the book on many a sea       Hath stilled the waves' alarm.'      Late the hour, dark the night,       The house is solitary,     Feeble is a taper's light       To light poor Ann to see.      Her eyes are yet with visions bright       Of sylph and river, flower and fay,     Now through a narrow corridor       She takes her lonely way.      Vast shadows on the heedless walls       Gigantic loom, stoop low:     Each little hasty footfall calls       Hollowly to and fro.      In the dim solitude her heart       Remembers tearlessly     White winters when her mother was       Her loving company.      Now in the dark clear glass she sees       A taper mocking hers,--     A phantom face of light blue eyes,       Reflecting phantom fears.      Around her loom the vacant rooms,       Wind the upward stairs,     She climbs on into a loneliness       Only her taper shares.      Her grandmother is deaf with age;       A garden of moonless trees     Would answer not though she should cry       In anguish on her knees.      So that she scarcely heeds--so fast       Her pent-up heart doth beat--     When, faint along the corridor,       Falleth the sound of feet:--      Sounds lighter than silk slippers make       Upon a ballroom floor, when sweet     Violin and 'cello wake       Music for twirling feet.      O! in an old unfriendly house,       What shapes may not conceal     Their faces in the open day,       At night abroad to steal?      Even her taper seems with fear       To languish small and blue;     Far in the woods the winter wind       Runs whistling through.      A dreadful cold plucks at each hair,       Her mouth is stretched to cry,     But sudden, with a gush of joy,       It narrows to a sigh.      It is a wilding child which comes       Swift through the corridor,     Singing an old forgotten song,       This ancient burden bore:--      'Thorn, thorn, I wis,     And roses twain,       A red rose and a white,     Stoop in the blossom, bee, and kiss       A lonely child good-night.      'Swim fish, sing bird,     And sigh again,       I that am lost am lone,     Bee in the blossom never stirred       Locks hid beneath a stone!'--      Her eye was of the azure fire       That hovers in wintry flame;     Her raiment wild and yellow as furze       That spouteth out the same;      And in her hand she bore no flower,       But on her head a wreath     Of faded flag-flowers that did yet       Smell sweetly after death.      Clear was the light of loveliness       That lit her face like rain;     And sad the mouth that uttered       Her immemorial strain.          *     *     *     *      Gloomy with night the corridor       Is now that she is gone,     Albeit this solitary child       No longer seems alone.      Fast though her taper dwindles down,       Heavy and thick the tome,     A beauty beyond fear to dim       Haunts now her alien home.      Ghosts in the world malignant, grim,       Vex many a wood, and glen,     And house, and pool,--the unquiet ghosts       Of dead and restless men.      But in her grannie's house this spirit--       A child as lone as she--     Pining for love not found on earth,       Ann dreams again to see.      Seated upon her tapestry-stool,       Her fairy-book laid by,     She gazes in the fire, knowing       She hath sweet company.

DOWN-ADOWN-DERRY       Down-adown-derry,     Sweet Annie Maroon,     Gathering daisies     In the meadows of Doone,     Sees a white fairy     Skip buxom and free     Where the waters go brawling     In rills to the sea;         Singing down-adown-derry.      Down-adown-derry,     Sweet Annie Maroon     Through the green grasses     Runs fleetly and soon,     And lo! on a lily     She sees one recline     Whose eyes in her wee face     Like the water-sparks shine;         Singing down-adown-derry.      Down-adown-derry,     And shrill was her tune:--     'Come to my water-house,     Annie Maroon,     Come in your pink gown,     Your curls on your head,     To wear the white samite     And rubies instead';         Singing down-adown-derry.      'Down-adown-derry,     Lean fish of the sea,     Bring lanthorns for feasting     The gay FaÃ«rie;     And it's dancing on sand 'tis     That's smoother than wool;--     Foam-fruit and wild honey     To pleasure you full';         Singing down-adown-derry.      Down-adown-derry,     Sweet Annie Maroon     Looked large on the fairy     Curled wan as the moon;     And all the grey ripples     To the Mill racing by,     With harps and with timbrels     Did ringing reply;         Singing down-adown-derry.      'Down-adown-derry,'     Sang the Fairy of Doone,     Piercing the heart of     Sweet Annie Maroon;     And lo! when like roses     The clouds of the sun     Faded at dusk, gone     Was Annie Maroon;         Singing down-adown-derry.      Down-adown-derry,     The daisies are few;     Frost twinkles powd'ry     In haunts of the dew;     Only the robin     Perched on a white thorn,     Can comfort the heart of     A father forlorn;         Singing down-adown-derry.      Down-adown-derry,     There's snow in the air;     Ice where the lily     Bloomed waxen and fair;     He may call o'er the water,     Cry--cry through the Mill,     But Annie Maroon, alas!     Answer ne'er will;         Singing down-adown-derry.         THE SUPPER       A wolf he pricks with eyes of fire     Across the night's o'ercrusted snows,         Seeking his prey,         He pads his way     Where Jane benighted goes,       Where Jane benighted goes.      He curdles the bleak air with ire,     Ruffling his hoary raiment through,         And lo! he sees         Beneath the trees     Where Jane's light footsteps go,       Where Jane's light footsteps go.      No hound peals thus in wicked joy,     He snaps his muzzle in the snows,         His five-clawed feet         Do scamper fleet     Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows,       Where Jane's bright lanthorn shows.      Now his greed's green doth gaze unseen     On a pure face of wilding rose,         Her amber eyes         In fear's surprise     Watch largely as she goes,       Watch largely as she goes.      Salt wells his hunger in his jaws,     His lust it revels to and fro,         Yet small beneath         A soft voice saith,     'Jane shall in safety go,       Jane shall in safety go.'      He lurched as if a fiery lash     Had scourged his hide, and through and through,         His furious eyes         O'erscanned the skies,     But nearer dared not go,       But nearer dared not go.      He reared like wild Bucephalus,     His fangs like spears in him uprose,         Ev'n to the town         Jane's flitting gown     He grins on as she goes,       He grins on as she goes.      In fierce lament he howls amain,     He scampers, marvelling in his throes         What brought him there         To sup on air,     While Jane unarmÃ¨d goes,       While Jane unarmÃ¨d goes.         THE ISLE OF LONE       Three dwarfs there were which lived on an isle,       And the name of the isle was Lone,     And the names of the dwarfs were Alliolyle,       Lallerie, Muziomone.      Alliolyle was green of een,       Lallerie light of locks,     Muziomone was mild of mien,       As ewes in April flocks.      Their house was small and sweet of the sea,       And pale as the Malmsey wine;     Their bowls were three, and their beds were three,       And their nightcaps white were nine.      Their beds were of the holly-wood,       Their combs of the tortoiseshell,     Their mirrors clear as wintry flood,       Frozen dark and snell.      So each would lie on his plumpy pillow,       The moon for company,     And hear the parrot scream to the billow,       And the billow roar reply.--      Sulphur parrots, and parrots red,       Scarlet, and flame, and green;     And five-foot apes that jargonÃ¨d       In feathery-tufted treen.      And oh, or ever the dawning shed       On dreams a narrow flame,     Three gaping dwarfs gat out of bed       And gazed upon the same.      At dawn they fished, at noon they snared       Young foxes in the dells,     At even on dew-berries they fared,       And blew in their twisted shells.      Dark was the sea they gambolled in,       And thick with silver fish,     Dark as green glass blown clear and thin       To be a monarch's dish.      They sate to sup in a jasmine bower,       Lit pale with flies of fire,     Their bowls the hue of the iris-flower,       And lemon their attire.      Sweet wine in little cups they sipped,       And golden honeycomb     Into their bowls of cream they dipped,       Whipt light and white as foam.      Alliolyle, where the salt sea flows,       Taught three old apes to sing,     And there to the moon, like a full-blown rose,       They capered in a ring.      But down to the shore skipped Lallerie,       His parrot on his thumb,     And the twain they scritched in mockery,       While the dancers go and come.      So, alas! in the evening, rosy and still,       Light-haired Lallerie     Bitterly quarrelled with Alliolyle       By the yellow-sanded sea.      The rising moon swam sweet and large       Before their furious eyes,     And they rolled and rolled to the coral marge       Where the surf for ever cries.      Too late, too late, comes Muziomone:       Clear in the clear green sea     Alliolyle lies not alone,       But clasped with Lallerie.      He blows on his shell plaintive notes;       Ape, parraquito, bee     Flock where a shoe on the salt wave floats,--       The shoe of Lallerie.      He fetches nightcaps, one and nine,       Grey apes he dowers three,     His house as fair as the Malmsey wine       Seems sad as cypress-tree.      Three bowls he brims with honeycomb       To feast the bumble bees,     Saying, 'O bees, be this your home,       For grief is on the seas!'      He sate him lone in a coral grot,       At the flowing of the tide;     When ebbed the billow, there was not,       Save coral, aught beside.      So hairy apes in three white beds,       And nightcaps, one and nine,     On moonlit pillows lay three heads       Bemused with dwarfish wine.      A tomb of coral, the dirge of bee,       The grey apes' guttural groan     For Alliolyle, for Lallerie,       For thee, O Muziomone!         THE SLEEPING BEAUTY       The scent of bramble sweets the air,       Amid her folded sheets she lies,     The gold of evening in her hair,       The blue of morn shut in her eyes.      How many a changing moon hath lit       The unchanging roses of her face!     Her mirror ever broods on it       In silver stillness of the days.      Oft flits the moth on filmy wings       Into his solitary lair;     Shrill evensong the cricket sings       From some still shadow in her hair.      In heat, in snow, in wind, in flood,       She sleeps in lovely loneliness,     Half folded like an April bud       On winter-haunted trees.         THE HORN       Hark! is that a horn I hear,       In cloudland winding sweet--     And bell-like clash of bridle-rein,       And silver-shod light feet?      Is it the elfin laughter of       Fairies riding faint and high,     'Neath the branches of the moon,       Straying through the starry sky?      Is it in the globÃ¨d dew       Such sweet melodies may fall?     Wood and valley--all are still,       Hushed the shepherd's call.      Hark! is that a horn I hear       In cloudland winding sweet?     Or gloomy goblins marching out       Their captain Puck to greet?         CAPTAIN LEAN       Out of the East a hurricane       Swept down on Captain Lean--     That mariner and gentleman       Will ne'er again be seen.      He sailed his ship against the foes       Of his own country dear,     But now in the trough of the billows       An aimless course doth steer.      Powder was violets to his nostril,       Sweet the din of the fighting-line,     Now he is flotsam on the seas,       And his bones are bleached with brine.      The stars move"]]]
