Possibly if you tried farther down the street--\"  \"That will do; we have no time to waste,\" said my companion firmly. \"You are Henry Peters, of Adelaide, late the Rev. Dr. Shlessinger, of Baden and South America.  I am as sure of that as that my own name is Sherlock Holmes.\"  Peters, as I will now call him, started and stared hard at his formidable pursuer.  \"I guess your name does not frighten me, Mr. Holmes,\" said he coolly.  \"When a man's conscience is easy you can't rattle him.  What is your business in my house?\"  \"I want to know what you have done with the Lady Frances Carfax, whom you brought away with you from Baden.\"  \"I'd be very glad if you could tell me where that lady may be,\" Peters answered coolly.  \"I've a bill against her for nearly a hundred pounds, and nothing to show for it but a couple of trumpery pendants that the dealer would hardly look at.  She attached herself to Mrs. Peters and me at Baden--it is a fact that I was using another name at the time--and she stuck on to us until we came to London.  I paid her bill and her ticket.  Once in London, she gave us the slip, and, as I say, left these out-of-date jewels to pay her bills.  You find her, Mr. Holmes, and I'm your debtor.\"  \"I MEAN to find her,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"I'm going through this house till I do find her.\"  \"Where is your warrant?\"  Holmes half drew a revolver from his pocket.  \"This will have to serve till a better one comes.\"  \"Why, you're a common burglar.\"  \"So you might describe me,\" said Holmes cheerfully.  \"My companion is also a dangerous ruffian.  And together we are going through your house.\"  Our opponent opened the door.  \"Fetch a policeman, Annie!\" said he.  There was a whisk of feminine skirts down the passage, and the hall door was opened and shut.  \"Our time is limited, Watson,\" said Holmes.  \"If you try to stop us, Peters, you will most certainly get hurt.  Where is that coffin which was brought into your house?\"  \"What do you want with the coffin?  It is in use.  There is a body in it.\"  \"I must see the body.\"  \"Never with my consent.\"  \"Then without it.\"  With a quick movement Holmes pushed the fellow to one side and passed into the hall.  A door half opened stood immediately before us.  We entered.  It was the dining-room. On the table, under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying.  Holmes turned up the gas and raised the lid.  Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an emaciated figure.  The glare from the lights above beat down upon an aged and withered face. By no possible process of cruelty, starvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful Lady Frances.  Holmes's face showed his amazement, and also his relief.  \"Thank God!\" he muttered.  \"It's someone else.\"  \"Ah, you've blundered badly for once, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Peters, who had followed us into the room.  \"Who is the dead woman?\"  \"Well, if you really must know, she is an old nurse of my wife's, Rose Spender by name, whom we found in the Brixton Workhouse Infirmary.  We brought her round here, called in Dr. Horsom, of 13 Firbank Villas--mind you take the address, Mr. Holmes--and had her carefully tended, as Christian folk should.  On the third day she died--certificate says senile decay--but that's only the doctor's opinion, and of course you know better.  We ordered her funeral to be carried out by Stimson and Co., of the Kennington Road, who will bury her at eight o'clock to-morrow morning.  Can you pick any hole in that, Mr. Holmes?  You've made a silly blunder, and you may as well own up to it.  I'd give something for a photograph of your gaping, staring face when you pulled aside that lid expecting to see the Lady Frances Carfax and only found a poor old woman of ninety.\"  Holmes's expression was as impassive as ever under the jeers of his antagonist, but his clenched hands betrayed his acute annoyance.  \"I am going through your house,\" said he.  \"Are you, though!\" cried Peters as a woman's voice and heavy steps sounded in the passage.  \"We'll soon see about that.  This way, officers, if you please.  These men have forced their way into my house, and I cannot get rid of them.  Help me to put them out.\"  A sergeant and a constable stood in the doorway.  Holmes drew his card from his case.  \"This is my name and address.  This is my friend, Dr. Watson.\"  \"Bless you, sir, we know you very well,\" said the sergeant, \"but you can't stay here without a warrant.\"  \"Of course not.  I quite understand that.\"  \"Arrest him!\" cried Peters.  \"We know where to lay our hands on this gentleman if he is wanted,\" said the sergeant majestically, \"but you'll have to go, Mr. Holmes.\"  \"Yes, Watson, we shall have to go.\"  A minute later we were in the street once more.  Holmes was as cool as ever, but I was hot with anger and humiliation.  The sergeant had followed us.  \"Sorry, Mr. Holmes, but that's the law.\"  \"Exactly, Sergeant, you could not do otherwise.\"  \"I expect there was good reason for your presence there.  If there is anything I can do--\"  \"It's a missing lady, Sergeant, and we think she is in that house.  I expect a warrant presently.\"  \"Then I'll keep my eye on the parties, Mr. Holmes.  If anything comes along, I will surely let you know.\"  It was only nine o'clock, and we were off full cry upon the trail at once.  First we drove to Brixton Workhouse Infirmary, where we found that it was indeed the truth that a charitable couple had called some days before, that they had claimed an imbecile old woman as a former servant, and that they had obtained permission to take her away with them.  No surprise was expressed at the news that she had since died.  The doctor was our next goal.  He had been called in, had found the woman dying of pure senility, had actually seen her pass away, and had signed the certificate in due form.  \"I assure you that everything was perfectly normal and there was no room for foul play in the matter,\" said he. Nothing in the house had struck him as suspicious save that for people of their class it was remarkable that they should have no servant.  So far and no further went the doctor.  Finally we found our way to Scotland Yard.  There had been difficulties of procedure in regard to the warrant.  Some delay was inevitable.  The magistrate's signature might not be obtained until next morning.  If Holmes would call about nine he could go down with Lestrade and see it acted upon.  So ended the day, save that near midnight our friend, the sergeant, called to say that he had seen flickering lights here and there in the windows of the great dark house, but that no one had left it and none had entered.  We could but pray for patience and wait for the morrow.  Sherlock Holmes was too irritable for conversation and too restless for sleep.  I left him smoking hard, with his heavy, dark brows knotted together, and his long, nervous fingers tapping upon the arms of his chair, as he turned over in his mind every possible solution of the mystery.  Several times in the course of the night I heard him prowling about the house. Finally, just after I had been called in the morning, he rushed into my room.  He was in his dressing-gown, but his pale, hollow-eyed face told me that his night had been a sleepless one.  \"What time was the funeral?  Eight, was it not?\" he asked eagerly. \"Well, it is 7:20 now.  Good heavens, Watson, what has become of any brains that God has given me?  Quick, man, quick! It's life or death--a hundred chances on death to one on life. I'll never forgive myself, never, if we are too late!\"  Five minutes had not passed before we were flying in a hansom down Baker Street.  But even so it was twenty-five to eight as we passed Big Ben, and eight struck as we tore down the Brixton Road.  But others were late as well as we.  Ten minutes after the hour the hearse was still standing at the door of the house, and even as our foaming horse came to a halt the coffin, supported by three men, appeared on the threshold.  Holmes darted forward and barred their way.  \"Take it back!\" he cried, laying his hand on the breast of the foremost.  \"Take it back this instant!\"  \"What the devil do you mean?  Once again I ask you, where is your warrant?\" shouted the furious Peters, his big red face glaring over the farther end of the coffin.  \"The warrant is on its way.  The coffin shall remain in the house until it comes.\"  The authority in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters had suddenly vanished into the house, and they obeyed these new orders. \"Quick, Watson, quick!  Here is a screw-driver!\" he shouted as the coffin was replaced upon the table. \"Here's one for you, my man!  A sovereign if the lid comes off in a minute!  Ask no questions--work away!  That's good!  Another! And another!  Now pull all together! It's giving!  It's giving! Ah, that does it at last.\"  With a united effort we tore off the coffin-lid.  As we did so there came from the inside a stupefying and overpowering smell of chloroform. A body lay within, its head all wreathed in cotton-wool, which had been soaked in the narcotic.  Holmes plucked it off and disclosed the statuesque face of a handsome and spiritual woman of middle age.  In an instant he had passed his arm round the figure and raised her to a sitting position.  \"Is she gone, Watson?  Is there a spark left?  Surely we are not too late!\"  For half an hour it seemed that we were.  What with actual suffocation, and what with the poisonous fumes of the chloroform, the Lady Frances seemed to have passed the last point of recall. And then, at last, with artificial respiration, with injected ether, and with every device that science could suggest, some flutter of life, some quiver of the eyelids, some dimming of a mirror, spoke of the slowly returning life. A cab had driven up, and Holmes, parting the blind, looked out at it. \"Here is Lestrade with his warrant,\" said he.  \"He will find that his birds have flown.  And here,\" he added as a heavy "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2348"],["title","The Disappearance of Lady Frances Carfax (#4)"],["body","hurried along the passage, \"is someone who has a better right to nurse this lady than we have.  Good morning, Mr. Green; I think that the sooner we can move the Lady Frances the better. Meanwhile, the funeral may proceed, and the poor old woman who still lies in that coffin may go to her last resting-place alone.\"  \"Should you care to add the case to your annals, my dear Watson,\" said Holmes that evening, \"it can only be as an example of that temporary eclipse to which even the best-balanced mind may be exposed.  Such slips are common to all mortals, and the greatest is he who can recognize and repair them.  To this modified credit I may, perhaps, make some claim.  My night was haunted by the thought that somewhere a clue, a strange sentence, a curious observation, had come under my notice and had been too easily dismissed.  Then, suddenly, in the gray of the morning, the words came back to me.  It was the remark of the undertaker's wife, as reported by Philip Green.  She had said, 'It should be there before now.  It took longer, being out of the ordinary.'  It was the coffin of which she spoke.  It had been out of the ordinary. That could only mean that it had been made to some special measurement.  But why?  Why?  Then in an instant I remembered the deep sides, and the little wasted figure at the bottom.  Why so large a coffin for so small a body?  To leave room for another body. Both would be buried under the one certificate.  It had all been so clear, if only my own sight had not been dimmed.  At eight the Lady Frances would be buried.  Our one chance was to stop the coffin before it left the house.  \"It was a desperate chance that we might find her alive, but it WAS a chance, as the result showed.  These people had never, to my knowledge, done a murder.  They might shrink from actual violence at the last. The could bury her with no sign of how she met her end, and even if she were exhumed there was a chance for them.  I hoped that such considerations might prevail with them. You can reconstruct the scene well enough.  You saw the horrible den upstairs, where the poor lady had been kept so long.  They rushed in and overpowered her with their chloroform, carried her down, poured more into the coffin to insure against her waking, and then screwed down the lid.  A clever device, Watson.  It is new to me in the annals of crime.  If our ex-missionary friends escape the clutches of Lestrade, I shall expect to hear of some brilliant incidents in their future career.\""]]]
