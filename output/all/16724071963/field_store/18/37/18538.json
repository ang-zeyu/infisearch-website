Heretofore, _said I_, long Hair was a Mark of Subjection. When a Slave was freed, his Head was shav'd as a Token of the Liberty that had been granted him; and 'tis to this that the Apostle alludes. Under the Law, we were Slaves to Sin, he means, but we are made free by Grace. Why shou'd we still carry the Marks of our old Bondage about us, as the Wife does, who is dependent on her Husband? At that Time there were Slaves, tho' the Use of them is now very much lost among the Christians. I own the Text says, that we are taught by Nature not to pride our selves in our Hair; but this Expression is not to be taken in its Strictest Sense, for Nature there signifies nothing but Custom. Naturally we have nothing that is superfluous. Our Hair was given us for the Guard and Preservation of the Head, and the upper Parts of the Body, as Nails are Weapons with which Nature has provided us for our Defence. Nature, therefore, does not oblige us to cut off the one, or pare the Other; but 'tis rather what we call the Mode, Decency, and certain Civil Laws establish'd among People, which at the long Run we look upon as Natural. The Fashion of this Age authorises the wearing of long Hair, and I don't think it any Harm to follow it, especially in this Part of the World, where, by the Confession of People of the best Sense, and the generality of Divines, the Thing is absolutely a Matter of Indifference.' But all this was not enough to convince my Master; so that to satisfy him, I was fain to permit him to make use of his Scissors, and to crop my Hair even to my Ears. This Change of Custom was an Uneasiness to me; but, in short, what will not a Man do for the sake of Peace and a good Understanding with his Neighbour? And really this Complaisance of mine won me his Heart to such a Degree, that he wou'd have laid down his Life for me upon occasion. His Person, his Family, his Goods, all were at my Service and Disposal.  Besides these Advantages, which were very considerable for a Foreigner, as I was, he procur'd me the Acquaintance of many of his intimate Friends, and particularly of a Factor of the _Dutch_ Company, who was indeed one of the most agreeable young Men that I ever knew. He talk'd _French_ very well, and was perfectly acquainted with his Religion, of which I took an Opportunity to converse with him, whenever we saw one another, which I endeavour'd shou'd be as often as possible. I had moreover this Happiness, that he accommodated me with every thing I wanted, and wou'd not suffer me for the World to be troublesome to my Master, who, however, was a courteous good-natur'd Gentleman. He never made an Entertainment, but he engag'd me to be of the Party; and the worst on't was, he treated so liberally that we had occasion to remember it generally for two Days after it. One time he debauch'd me so, that next Day I was seiz'd with a violent Fever, which really had like to have cost me my Life; for it stuck to me three Weeks, and made me as lean as a Skeleton, so that I was nothing but Skin and Bones; and my Physician actually gave me over. However, by observing a regular Diet, I at length recover'd. During this, I made continual Reflections upon the severe Laws which Nature so punctually executes upon poor Mortals; and being sensible that there are few Excesses which she does not punish, I concluded in my Mind, that Frugality and Temperance are the true Means of keeping the Mind always free, and of securing the Body from all the Distempers to which we are otherwise, almost all of us, subject. This made me take a firm Resolution to be more temperate for the future than I had been in time past, and never to be guilty of any thing with which I might reproach my self afterwards. _Van Dyke_, which was the _Dutchman's_ Name, had made the same Resolution before I knew him, but his Generosity, when he had a mind to regale his Friends, oblig'd him sometimes to recede from it, and not always to put in practice the good Lessons which he scarce ever fail'd to give when he was the Guest of his Friends. However, I made him own at last, That when Health is at stake, it was better to be reckon'd an Oeconomist, than a Man of Generosity and Complaisance.  During this, the good Man had a troublesome Affair upon his Hands, which gave me more Uneasiness than it did him. He receiv'd a Letter from the Wife of one of his Merchants, which requir'd him in her Husband's Absence, to furnish M. _Heudde_'s Son, who was her Nephew, and then set out for _Lisbon_, with what Necessaries he wanted to continue his Voyage; adding, that he should be reimburs'd, and that for her own part, she shou'd be much oblig'd to him for the Favour. In about a Fortnight after, M. _Heudde_ arriv'd at _Van Dyke_'s, attended by a Valet de Chambre, who were both very meanly accoutred. The first Question he ask'd him was, Whether he had not receiv'd a Letter from his Aunt, which the Factor no sooner own'd, than he entertain'd him with a great many Particularities about several Persons of the Factor's Acquaintance; after which, he told him his Design of visiting _Portugal_, _Spain_, _Italy_, _France_, and of returning home thro' the Island of _Great Britain_. At last he talk'd of the Money he shou'd have occasion for, to make the Tour of so many Countries. _Van Dyke_ told him what he thought would suffice; and as he exhorted him not to be extravagant on the one hand, so he wou'd not have him disparage himself on the other, because he had Orders to accommodate him with what Monies he wanted, not only at _Lisbon_, but wherever else he travell'd: This the Factor cou'd easily do, because he had very good Correspondence, either directly or indirectly, in most of the chief Towns of _Europe_. M. _Heudde_, who seem'd very well pleas'd with the Compliment, contented himself with the Sum of 15000 Livres, and good Recommendations; and after having staid a few Days, continu'd his Journey. _Van Dyke_, who was a very punctual Man in his Business, immediately certify'd his Principal of what had pass'd betwixt him and his Nephew, and what Rout he had taken. But in a Week after, to his great Surprise, who shou'd he meet in the Street, but him that pretended to be M. _Heudde_'s Valet de Chambre, and asking him if his Master was not gone; he answer'd him to his farther Astonishment, not only that he cou'd not tell what was become of him, but that he did not so much as know who he was. I came hither, said he, some Days ago from _Bourdeaux_, with a Design to make a Voyage to _America_; the Gentleman, you speak of, happening to be on Board our Ship, bargain'd with me to be his Servant, as long as he continued in this City, for Twenty-pence a Day, besides my Expences, which he paid me, but dismiss'd me last Week, and I have not since heard a Word of him. This was somewhat alarming to my Friend; and tho' he was not very sure that he was bubbled, he had the Precaution to write immediately to all those to whom he had given the Traveller his Recommendations, and desired them not to let him have any thing till farther Orders. This sav'd him from any farther Loss, but his 300 Ducats were gone past Recovery. The Answer he receiv'd from _Holland_ was, That they knew not what he meant, and that this pretended M. _Heudde_ was a Knave to be sure, that wou'd come to the Gallows.  Tho' this Loss was a Trifle to the Wealth M. _Van Dyke_ had acquir'd, yet it vex'd him a little, and he left no Stone unturn'd to find out the Sharper, but all his Inquiry was to no Purpose; and whether he ever heard of him in his Life, is more than I know, because I left him not long after; for tho' I was heartily welcome to him, yet I did not thoroughly like my Station there, because my Profit was but small, and my principal View was to see the World. The Friendships I had contracted, and the Character my Master gave me, made my Departure the more easy.     CHAP. III.  _Of the Author's Second Voyage; and his Shipwreck upon an unknown Coast._   I had an Opportunity of going on board a _Portuguese_ Ship, which was bound to the _East Indies_, in Company with three others. It was commanded by One _Don Pedro_, and carry'd only Twenty Guns, but had 147 Men aboard, of which Number were a great many _Frenchmen_, who however, to a Man, understood the _Portuguese_ Tongue. All things being ready, we set sail the Fifth of _June_, 1644, with a very favourable Wind. The first Ruffle we met with was the Loss of our Captain, who was, to speak the Truth, a Man of consummate Experience, but a very Brute and Deboshee. The Tenth Day after we were under Sail, when he had taken his usual Dose of Brandy, he fell into such a Passion with one of our Seamen, that from hard Words he proceeded to Blows. The Mariner, who was a meer Blunderbuss, laugh'd, and went to make his Escape from him, at which _Don Pedro_ was so exasperated, that he pursued him with a Lever in his Hand, wishing the Devil might take him if he did not break his Neck; and as they were both running, our Officer stumbled, reel'd, and fell with such a Force against the Capstane, that he broke his left Arm, three Inches above the Elbow. Thereupon I was call'd, and examining the Wound, I perceiv'd that the Bone was intirely shiver'd, and after mature Deliberation, I was absolutely for Sawing it off. But all that I cou'd say, was of no weight with the Patient, who cou'd not be persuaded by any means, to undergo the Operation; for he swore that he wou'd rather die than submit to so desperate an Extremity. I was therefore oblig'd, sorely against the Grain, to manage him as he pleas'd; but what I foresaw, happen'd in two Days time; the Wound was inflam'd, a Mortification ensu'd: upon it, and the Fifth Day after his Fall he was a dead Man.  The Ship's Company was, to the last Degree, alarm'd at this Loss, which we took for a bad Omen; however, we were forc'd to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37400"],["title","The Travels and Adventures of James Massey (#6)"],["body","it, and after the due Honours paid to his Corpse, it was thrown into the Sea, while the Guns were fir'd as usual on such Occasions. In the mean time we advanc'd in our Voyage; and tho' some little Storms arose now and then, yet they were not dangerous. The greatest Misfortune that befel us, was our being separated from the Company of our other Ships, so that we heard no more of them. When we made the Island of _Ascension_, we perceiv'd that our Water was very much corrupted and consequently we resolv'd to go to St. _Helena_, to take in fresh Water, left the Number of our sick Men, which was already considerable, should be much greater, if we did not stop some where before we came to the _Cape of Good Hope_.  But when we had discover'd that Island at a great Distance, and were congratulating each other upon it, we spy'd that which Sailors call a _Wool-Pack_, seemingly as big as a great Cask within Cannon-shot of our Ship. As I had never seen any but in Pictures, and in Books of Travels; I consider'd this Phænomenon with all the Attention I was capable of, and concluded that it must be really owing to Air that was agitated, and drove with Impetuosity into the vast Region of our Atmosphere, which happening to meet with another sort of Hurricane impell'd from the opposite Part of the Atmosphere, whirls back towards its Basis, and forms the Figure of a Cylinder, which lengthens it self in an Instant, till it comes to the Surface of the Water: The Sea being then press'd on all Sides, except just there, the Matter which corresponds to the middle of this Column, like what we observe with regard to Pumps, Syringes, and Cupping-Glasses, must needs rise, which it does with so much Rapidity and Force, even to the bearing away of great Fish, that to the Amazement of us all, the Sky, as serene as it was before, was cover'd with thick Clouds, which darken'd the Air in a Moment. The Winds began to roar hideously, the Sea was in a Foam, the Waves swell'd, and one wou'd have thought that Nature, in the Height of her Indignation, wou'd have swallow'd us up. The Seamen, in the utmost Hurry, furl'd all the Sails, the Main-Sail only excepted; nevertheless the Ship was carry'd away with such Violence, that we were also oblig'd to let down the Main-Sail for fear of being drove upon some fatal Rocks. I cannot here prevail with my self to set down every minute Particular from the Journal that I kept, of what happen'd to us during this dreadful Tempest, which lasted Twenty-two Days, because it would take up several Sheets of Paper; and only raise the Reader's Pity and Concern. Not only the Women and Children that were aboard gave such Shrieks, as were enough to have pierc'd the most obdurate Hearts, but the generality of the Men were frighted almost out of their Wits. Not a Day pass'd but one or other of them dy'd; We also lost our Pilot and the Mate, so that the only Man left capable of conducting the Vessel, was the Master of it, and he too was in a bad State of Health. During this bitter Storm, we were compell'd to throw over-board, at several times, 12 of our Guns, and every thing that we thought too heavy; we also lost most of our Anchors, and ran adrift a long while at the Mercy of the Winds and Currents, without knowing whither we were driving, any more than if we had been at the bottom of the Ocean. At length it pleased God, of his special Mercy, that on the Twenty-third Day, a Day as mild as the others had been severe, we happen'd to run ashore at a Place altogether unknown to us, where, after having calculated the Meridian, examin'd our Watches, and made as correct a Computation as we could, we found that we were in about 60 Degrees of Longitude, and 44 of S. Latitude, _i.e._ 1000 or 1200 Leagues from St. _Helena_. The biggest of our Boats having been carry'd away by the Waves, which had wash'd our Decks a thousand times, glad we were that we had preserved the least; we immediately put ashore in her; and after having return'd Thanks to God for having sav'd our Lives, we began to take our best Clothes and Goods out of the Ship, together with what wou'd be most necessary for us by Land. With some paltry Sails we made two Tents; and some cut down the Branches of Trees, with, which they built Barracks, in which the remainder of our Ship's Company, consisting of Eighty-five Persons, lodg'd.  There were Forty of us that were as well as we cou'd be in our present Circumstances, part of which Number look'd after the Ship, and the rest went a marauding for what they could get. Never were Fire-Arms, Powder, and Shot of more Service to us than now. There was all sorts of Wild-Fowl in abundance, and particularly Hens larger than Turkeys, which were fat, and very nourishing. Nor did we want for Fish, because we had good store of Nets, Hooks, and other Instruments to catch them. Here were few Tortoises, but they were very good. We took some which I am sure weigh'd from 400 to 500 Pound, and were enough for us all. We thought the Flesh of them very excellent and the Fat was the most delicate Food in the World. It serv'd us for all Purposes, for Sauce, or to eat upon Bread, or to burn; and in general, for almost every Necessity. In two Hours Walk from thence towards the East, we found a River, which supply'd us with very good Water. Notwithstanding these Refreshments, two more of our Men dy'd; but it was not long before the others recover'd.  Mean time our Ship was so lighten'd, that we observ'd she floated, so that we tow'd her to the River just now mention'd. As soon as she was laid up, the Carpenters examin'd her very nicely, and found that there was no likelihood of her being ever in a Condition to serve us in the Pursuit of our Voyage, because the Storm had intirely shatter'd her. We therefore resolv'd unanimously to take her to pieces, and with the best of her Materials to build a smaller, to return in to _Africa_. The Captain wou'd have had us all in our turns put our Hands to the Work; but we so fully convinc'd him that we were not all equally fit for it, and that there was an absolute Necessity for some body to provide the Kitchen with Victuals for feeding so many Mouths, that Ten of us were appointed to go in quest of Provisions. The Nine that were join'd with me, were very clever Fellows, part of them being as it were Huntsmen, and the rest Fishermen by Profession; consequently 'tis natural to imagine that in such a Country as this, we did not find it a very hard Matter to get Food for our Company. These agreeable Occupations, which would have been a very great Pleasure to another Person, delighted me for a few Days; but I was soon weary of this Life, and my Curiosity to penetrate farther into a Country, where I did not imagine any body had ever been, made me resolve to abandon my Comrades, tho' I was not willing to put so rash a Design in Execution by my self. I therefore communicated my Design to two, that I thought the most resolute, who were overjoy'd with my Proposal, and declar'd to me severally, that they had entertain'd the same Thought, but were afraid to trust it to a third Person. Accordingly the Affair was concluded, upon Oath not to divulge it; and after we had promis'd to be true to each other, we went to rest, fully purposing to be gone as soon as possible.     CHAP. IV.   _The Author, with only two Comrades, leaves the rest of the Company, and penetrates into those unknown Countries. The Obstacles he meets with in his Passage_, &c.   The next Day in the Morning, which was the 24th of _September_, 1644, and the 11th of our Arrival, we each took a Hatchet in our Belts with a Gun, and whatsoever we thought necessary for an Enterprise of this Nature, and without more ado enter'd the Wood, leaving the others behind us, and made great Haste towards the S.S.W. We travell'd at least four long Leagues before we talked of resting. _La Foret_, who was one of my Comrades, as _Du Puis_ was the other, perceiving a Heath-cock about a hundred Paces from us, shot him; while one pick'd it, I and the other fell to cutting of Fuel, and making a Fire under the Tree, at which we soon roasted our Fowl by a String. We made a hearty Dinner, only we wanted Drink, for which we were oblig'd to wait a little longer. As we proceeded in our Journey, we found a Pit of Water, which tho' not very clear, yet we thought it excellent: We fill'd our Flagons with it but made little or no Use of it, for about a League and half further we came to a Brook, where the Water was really as good as I ever met with in my Life. It was about two Foot deep, and ran exactly across that Part of the Road we had purpos'd to travel, by the help of a small Sun-Dial that I had in my Pocket, which was of great Service to us. There being no Bridge, nor other Conveniency, we pull'd off our Stockings, _&c._ and waded thro' the Rivulet, leaving it with great Regret, after having drank our Bellies full, and laid in a Stock of it for time to come. We hitherto found no Trace of Man or Beast. The Country was all over Sand, Briars, and Forests, for a matter of Eight or Ten Leagues that we had travell'd before Sun-set. In fine, we pitch'd our Camp at the Foot of a little Hill, where there was a Coppice so thick that we were as much out of the Wind, as if we had been in a Tent. Then we eat for Supper what we left at Dinner, and made the best shift we could to repose our selves for Sleep.  The next Morning when we wak'd, we were surpris'd to see the whole Firmament overcast, and threatning us with a heavy Storm; we therefore thought fit to dig a Cave in this Hill, which was pretty steep, on the Side where we were posted, in order to shelter our selves from the bad Weather. In short, we found in a trice, that by the Help of our Hatchets we had prepar'd a small Lodging. The Rain, however, did, not begin till about Eleven of the Clock, so that we had time enough to kill more Quails and other small Birds, which for the most part were unknown to us, than we could spend in a Week."]]]
