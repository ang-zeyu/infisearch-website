After parturition, placentae and bloody discharge often are in evidence in the vaginal canal. Females that have not given birth to young recently may also have bloody mucous discharge. Its significance has not been determined. In females that are undergoing sexual regression, the margins of the vaginal orifice become shrunken and pale, and the orifice becomes partly or wholly sealed.  Bodenheimer and Sulman (1946:255) concluded from their study of _Microtus guentheri_ that in this species, as in \"the cat,\" \"the rabbit,\" \"the ferret,\" and a few other mammals, ovulation is induced by copulation, and that there is no regular vaginal cycle. Hoyte (1955:412) disagreed with these conclusions for other species of _Microtus_, as he trapped individuals of _M. oeconomus_ that had recently ovulated without copulation (at least no sperm were found in the genital tracts). In _M. ochrogaster_ oestrus seems to be controlled largely by the food supply, at least the incidence of perforate females was found to fluctuate irregularly tending to follow the trend of rainfall, and, probably in more direct correlation, the amount of new grass present (see Table 1, and Martin, 1956:383-384). It therefore seems unlikely that in this species ovulation is dependent on copulation.  In females that have not yet produced young the teats are minute and well concealed in the fur, so that they are difficult to find, but in lactation they become conspicuous. In early lactation the teats are typically about 1 mm. in diameter and 2.5 mm. in length. As lactation progresses, they become thickened to nearly twice the original diameter. After lactation, as inversion occurs, they shrink to scabrous low prominences, 2 mm. to 3 mm. in diameter, surrounded by bare skin. There are three pairs of mammae, one pair pectoral and the other two abdominal. As mentioned by Jameson (1947:146), the pectoral mammae show little evidence of use in lactating prairie voles. Probably they are not used at all except in females with more than the four young in a litter accommodated by the abdominal mammae. As in various other rodents, the suckling young may cling to the female's teats and may be dragged over the ground as she moves about. When the female forages near the nest, she may drag the young with her instead of leaving them, but she can detach them instantly if she so desires. On many occasions females found in live-traps had young that were several days old clinging to their teats. In some instances young that had their eyes open may have followed the female into the trap and attached afterward.     SEASONAL INCIDENCE OF BREEDING   In the region of my study the prairie vole breeds the year round, but the rate of breeding changes continually. There is no regularity in the trend of the breeding season from year to year. It is obvious that the species is responsive to environmental changes and is so well attuned that its breeding is speedily initiated or inhibited by changes to favorable or unfavorable weather. The incidence of breeding is highest when temperature is moderate and both water and foods of preferred sorts are plentiful.  Tables 1 and 2 and Fig. 1, based on 11,109 records representing each month over a four-year period, show the changing trends from month to month. The perforate condition recorded in Table 1 may represent any of several stages in oestrus or pregnancy, but is regarded as a crude index of rate of breeding, since voles in the anoestrus stage lack the vaginal orifice. Highest percentages of perforate females occurred in the months of February, March, April, May, and June, while by far the lowest percentages were recorded in the drought summers of 1952 and 1953. Even in mid-winter a substantial proportion of the females trapped were perforate.    [Illustration: FIG. 1.

Palpating to detect embryos was not attempted because of the danger of injuring them or the female. Because gestation is of approximately three weeks duration, the figures in Table 2 represent roughly perhaps one-third, or a little less, of the adult females actually pregnant. At most times of year a substantial proportion of adult females (sometimes nearly all) are pregnant. Only in the winter (including March in 1951) were samples taken in which no recognizably pregnant females were found. Incidence of pregnancy was notably high in July, August, September, and October of 1950, May, 1951, May, 1952, and April and May, 1953. A high rate of breeding was not necessarily followed by an increase in the population. A relatively low rate of breeding was adequate to maintain the population level, provided that environmental factors remained favorable. Fig. 1 shows the average catch per day (with approximately 100 live-traps) over the four-year period, 1950 through 1953. The young (including all those weighing 30 grams or less, and corresponding roughly with the part of the population less than two months old) are shown separately. It is noteworthy that throughout the entire period the ratio of young to adults tended to be fairly stable--usually fluctuating between ten and thirty per cent of the total catch. Ratios of young to adults were notably high in March and May, 1950; April, June and July, 1952; and April, May and June, 1953. Ratios of young were notably low in June and December, 1950; January, February, March, and June through October, 1951; January, February, and March, 1952; and November, 1953.  In Fig. 1 the catch per day of voles, varying from month to month, reflects chiefly the changing population density. However, other factors also have important effects on the catch. For example, bait acceptance is better in the winter when natural foods, especially greens, are scarce, with the result that a higher catch can be made with the same population density. Interference with the trap line by other animals also affected the catch of voles. In warm weather the traps were checked in both morning and evening, and the catch was correspondingly greater than it was in cool weather when the traps were checked only once daily. The ratios obtained of young to adult voles cannot be accepted at face value as the true ratios in the population, either. For the first several days of each trapping period, the voles caught were mostly adults previously marked and, presumably, conditioned to the grain bait. Later, young voles not previously recorded, came to the traps in increasing numbers. The young, being at first not conditioned to the bait, and also having relatively small home ranges, would generally be less well represented in the catch than would the adults.     GESTATION   In other species of _Microtus_, so far as known, a 21-day gestation period seems to be the rule (Bailey, 1924:528; Hamilton, 1941:13; Hatfield, 1935:264). _M. ochrogaster_ seems to conform to this pattern, but the data obtained were meager, because breeding activity was usually inhibited in voles kept in confinement.  A female live-trapped on July 23, 1951, appeared to be in breeding condition. When trapped two days later, she had a copulatory plug, and 21 days after this she was found with a newborn litter in a trap. A female thought to have given birth to a litter between successive captures on July 20, and July 21, 1951 (on the basis of appearance of genitalia, and reduction in weight from 53 to 46 grams), appeared to have just completed parturition when she was examined on August 10. A female that gave birth to a litter in confinement on May 18, 1954, bred and was released the same day. She was recorded as pregnant in the first week of June, but on June 7 was no longer pregnant. If this pregnancy terminated normally, a gestation of 20 days or less is indicated.  Greenwald (1956:221) suggested that in _M. californicus_, oestrus might occur in the period of lactation, because he found recently formed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37450"],["title","Aspects of Reproduction and Development in the Prairie Vole (Microtus (#3)"],["body"," lutea in lactating females. In the course of my field work on _M. ochrogaster_, I obtained precise or approximate dates of successive litters born at intervals of somewhat more than 21 days apart. In different females, intervals of 23, 23, 24, 26, and approximately 27 (between 26 and 28) days were recorded between successive litters. In four other females intervals between litters were known only approximately because one of two records was based on a capture in late pregnancy judged to be within two or three days of parturition. For these females, intervals of 23, 24, 24, and 26 days were recorded. From the trend of these records, it seems that females often became pregnant within a few days after birth of a litter. Pregnancy from post-partum oestrus would seem to be less frequent than pregnancies beginning a few days after birth of the previous litter, and within the period of lactation.     NUMBER OF YOUNG PER LITTER   Jameson (1947:146) found an average of 3.4 young per litter in 58 litters of _M. ochrogaster_ from northeastern Kansas, mostly from Douglas County. Martin (1956:386) recorded a somewhat lower mean of 3.18 ± 0.24 in 65 litters on the Reservation in 1950, 1951, and 1952. For a total of 82 litters recorded from 1950 through 1956, inclusive, I obtained an average of 3.37 ± .075 young per litter. Several litters that were recorded were excluded from this computation as in each instance there was reason to suspect that they were incomplete. These included instances of females found in traps with young several days old, females that may not have completed parturition when they were released with newborn young, and those litters that might have sustained losses through cannibalism by the mother or her trap-mates.  Mean numbers of young per litter were found to vary from year to year and from month to month, as shown by the following lists: 1950, 3.0 (13 litters); 1951, 3.5 (23 litters); 1952, 3.5 (11 litters); 1953, 3.4 (5 litters); 1954, 3.4 (15 litters); 1955, 4.1 (7 litters); 1956, 3.8 (5 litters); January 2.0 (1 litter); February 3.5 (4 litters); March 4.5 (4 litters); April 3.9 (12 litters); May 3.3 (25 litters); June 3.0 (9 litters); July 2.7 (4 litters); August 2.9 (7 litters); September 2.8 (6 litters); October 3.4 (7 litters); November 5.0 (2 litters); December 4.0 (1 litter).  These differences can be logically explained on the basis of changes in the average age of the breeding females in the population. On the average, with greater length, weight and age, females produced progressively larger litters, although individuals did not necessarily conform to this general trend. For 24 females recorded in 1954-1956 and measured within a few days of birth of their litters, average length was correlated with number of young as follows: 6 young, 163.5 mm.; 5 young, 158.0 mm.; 4 young, 157.7 mm.; 3 young, 154.6 mm.; 2 young, 160.5 mm.  For 48 other females, recorded in 1950-1953, that were not measured, but that were mostly assignable to broad age groups on the basis of their individual histories in the trapping records, the following well defined trend was demonstrated.   Table 3. Number of Young per Litter Correlated with Age or Size     of Female.   =====================================+============+==================                                       |   Number   |     Average       Age or Size Group of Female     | of females |    number of                                       |  in sample | young per litter  -------------------------------------+------------+------------------  More than one year old               |      4     |       4.25  6 to 12 months old                   |     16     |       3.50  Large (age indeterminate)            |      9     |       3.44  2 to 5 months old                    |      9     |       2.90  Small and medium (age indeterminate) |     10     |       2.80  -------------------------------------+------------+------------------  It seems that the exceptionally high average numbers of young per litter in March and April result from the breeding females in those months being nearly all fully mature survivors of the previous year. In summer, when many females that are only a few weeks old become pregnant, the average litter declines to less than three young. The small average litter of 3.0 young for 1950 probably resulted from the fact that the population on the Reservation was then expanding rapidly in the newly favorable habitat created by one year's crop of vegetation after discontinuance of grazing, and had an unusually high percentage of breeding females that were not fully adult.     SIZE AT BIRTH   In four newborn young, total lengths, in mm., were 47, 45, 45, and 42. From the length-weight relationships shown in Fig. 2, it seems that a length of approximately 47 mm. is typical of newborn young of average weight. Martin (1956:388) found a mean weight of 2.8 ± 0.36 grams in sixteen newborn prairie voles from the Reservation. For a series of 67 other newborn voles representing 27 different litters in seven different years, I found an average of 2.9 ± .05 grams. Young ranged in weight from 3.8 to 2.0 grams. Weights of the newborn voles could not be correlated with season, size, age of females, or food conditions. However, a distinct trend toward larger size in those litters that contained fewer young was evident, as shown in Table 4.   Table 4. Weight of Newborn Young, Correlated with Number of Young     per Litter.   ==============+============+============+===========                |    Mean    |   Number   |  Number   Known Young  |   weight   | of litters | of young   Per Litter   |  in grams  | in sample  | in sample  --------------+------------+------------+-----------       2        | 3.1 ± .09 |      7     |     13       3        | 3.0 ± .17 |     11     |     28       4        | 2.7 ± .22 |      6     |     17       5        | 2.6 ± .42 |      3     |      9  --------------+------------+------------+-----------     EARLY GROWTH   Voles less than 100 mm. in total length were seldom captured, because those less than this size are dependent on the female, and rarely venture far enough from the nest to be caught in a trap. A further difficulty in obtaining growth records on the smallest young is that of making accurate measurements. During their first few days they partially retain the fetal posture, usually lying on one side, with the head, body and tail flexed in an arc almost completed by the tail approximating the muzzle. Straightening the animal by stretching it and holding it with sufficient firmness to obtain a measurement might have involved injury to it. Therefore, in most instances the newborn voles examined were merely weighed or an approximate measurement was estimated without stretching the young to its full length.  Newborn voles were obtained when females that were caught in live-traps produced their litters before they were found and released. In some instances, females caught while in late pregnancy were retained in the laboratory for a day or more until parturition occurred. Many of the newborn voles were marked by toe-clipping, according to the same system used for adults. Early growth was measured in some instances by keeping the female with her litter in confinement, measuring and weighing the young at intervals. In most instances, the female was released at the point of capture (presumably near her nest burrow) with the young clinging to her teats. For the young so released, the incidence of recovery was remarkably low, seeming to indicate that they were subject to decimating losses. Perhaps such losses are normal, at least on the study area where voles are live-trapped regularly. Holding of adults and partly grown young in live-traps ordinarily has no harmful effects on them, but the resultant separation of females from newly born litters may often result in death of the young either from hunger and exposure, or from attack by other voles and natural enemies.  During the first ten days the increase in length from an original 47 mm. is from three to four mm. per day. Figs. 2, 5, and 8 show length and weights of voles whose ages in days were definitely known because they were born in the laboratory, or in a live-trap after the female was caught there. Young voles marked at birth and released with the female were rarely recovered in the period of suckling, as they ordinarily remain in the nest burrow when the female ventures out to forage. Litters retained in the laboratory therefore have provided most of the records of growth in suckling young. Growth varied greatly between litters. It was not clearly correlated with size of female, size of young at birth, or number of young in litter, but probably was influenced by attentiveness of the female, her adjustment to captivity, and her productivity of milk. Within each litter there were usually persistent differences in development, but these were minor (except for those of occasional runts) compared with the differences between litters. In several litters of five young, one was usually smaller than the others at birth and therefore could not compete successfully with its litter mates, so that it never gained possession of a teat other than one of the pectoral pair, and always succumbed within a few days, after failing to gain weight as its litter mates did. The relatively few voles marked at birth and recovered after developing under natural conditions, did not deviate from the trend of those in confinement.     CARE OF YOUNG   Females in confinement were attentive to young, and, soon after parturition, licked them clean and huddled over them protectively. Ordinarily, the newborn young soon attached to a teat, and spent a large part of its time attached during its early development. Females found in live-traps with their litters of young less than a day old, often had some or all of the young clinging to their teats.
