Involuntarily, then, his eyes sought those of Berkeley. A look of pleading, helplessness. Berkeley met the glance and read the anxiety there, the tragic unwillingness of the man to arouse posterity’s rage or contempt.  It was a brief glance only from both men and it was over. Captain Griswold’s head came up; his shoulders straightened in the face of the oncoming monsters. They were close now, and coming closer. As always, the experts were free with their advice when it was not needed. When the chips were down, they could do no more than smirk and shrug a helpless shoulder.  He gave the command, and now there was no uncertainty.  \"Fire!\"                                    ————  The celebration was being held in the Great Stadium, the largest, most costly structure that Man had ever built. It was a fitting structure for the more important football games; and used on occasion, if they could be fitted in without upsetting the schedule, for State affairs. Now the stadium was filled to capacity, its floor churned by the careless feet of the thousands upon thousands who had managed to obtain an entrance.  From the quarter-mile-high tiers of seats, from the floor of the stadium, the shouts welled up, washing over the platform at the North end.  \"Griswold! Griswold!\"  It was not yet time for history to assess the justice of the massacre.  The President raised his hand. The battery of video cameras picked up each move.  \"Our hopes, our fears, our hearts, our prayers rode through every space-dark, star-flecked mile with these glorious pioneers.\" He turned then to the captain. \"For the people of Earth, _Admiral_ Griswold, this medal. A new medal for a Guider of Destiny, Maker of Empire, Son of Man!\"  The voice faltered, stopped.  The crowd on the floor of the stadium was pressing outward from the center, screaming in pain and terror. At the moment when the people should be quiet, rapt in reverence, they were emptying the floor of the stadium. But not willingly. They were being pressed back and out, as a great weight pushes its way through water. Those who could move outward no farther were crushed where they stood.  And then the ship appeared.  Hazy of outline, shimmering with impossible angles, seen by its glinting fire of light rather than by its solid form, as if its reality were in some other dimension and this only a projection, the ship appeared.  The President’s hand reached out and gripped Griswold’s shoulder as he leaned back and back, trying to determine its vast height. A silence then clutched the crowd—a terrified silence.  A full minute passed. Even on the platform, where all the pioneers of Mars were assembled with Earth’s dignitaries, even there the people cowered back away from this unseeable, unknowable horror.  But one man leaned forward instead, frantically studying the shimmering outline of the ship. One man—Berkeley.  With the training of the ethnologist, a man who really can deduce an entire civilization from mystifying data, he recognized the tremendous import.  At the end of that minute, without warning, a group of figures hovered in the air near the floor of the stadium.                                    ————  Quickly, Berkeley’s eyes assessed their form, their color, the increasing solidity of the humanoids. There are some movements, some gestures, common to all things of intelligence—the pause, the resolution, the lift of pride.  \"No!\" he screamed and started forward. \"Oh, no! We’re civilized. We’re intelligent!\" He was pulled back, as in his terror he tried to leap from the platform to get at the humanoids.  Held there, unable to move, he read the meaning of the actions of the group hovering near the ship. One flashed a shining tentacle around, as if to point to the stadium, the pitifully small spaceship on display, the crowds of people.  The leader manifestly ignored him. He flowed forward a pace, his ovoid head held high in pride and arrogance. He pointed a tentacle toward the south end of the stadium, and a pillar of leaping flame arose; fed with no fuel, never to cease its fire, the symbol of possession.  He pointed his tentacles to the north, the south, the east, the west. He motioned with his tentacles, as if to encircle all of Earth.  He unfurled a scroll and began to read.  —MARK CLIFTON & ALEX APOSTOLIDES      _Transcribers note_: This etext was produced from Galaxy Science     Fiction August 1953.

It sounds so weak-minded. But in the case of Love Among the Chickens it is unavoidable. It was not so much that you sympathised and encouraged--where you really came out strong was that you gave me the stuff. I like people who sympathise with me. I am grateful to those who encourage me. But the man to whom I raise the Wodehouse hat--owing to the increased cost of living, the same old brown one I had last year--it is being complained of on all sides, but the public must bear it like men till the straw hat season comes round--I say, the man to whom I raise this venerable relic is the man who gives me the material.  Sixteen years ago, my William, when we were young and spritely lads; when you were a tricky centre-forward and I a fast bowler; when your head was covered with hair and my list of \"Hobbies\" in Who's Who included Boxing; I received from you one morning about thirty closely-written foolscap pages, giving me the details of your friend -----'s adventures on his Devonshire chicken farm. Round these I wove as funny a plot as I could, but the book stands or falls by the stuff you gave me about \"Ukridge\"--the things that actually happened.  You will notice that I have practically re-written the book. There was some pretty bad work in it, and it had \"dated.\" As an instance of the way in which the march of modern civilisation has left the 1906 edition behind, I may mention that on page twenty-one I was able to make Ukridge speak of selling eggs at six for fivepence!

Mr. Ukridge.\"  \"Oh, my sainted aunt!\"  \"Sir!\"  \"Nothing, nothing.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs. Medley, withdrawing from the presence.  Ukridge! Oh, hang it! I had not met him for years, and, glad as I am, as a general thing, to see the friends of my youth when they drop in for a chat, I doubted whether I was quite equal to Ukridge at the moment. A stout fellow in both the physical and moral sense of the words, he was a trifle too jumpy for a man of my cloistered and intellectual life, especially as just now I was trying to plan out a new novel, a tricky job demanding complete quiet and seclusion. It had always been my experience that, when Ukridge was around, things began to happen swiftly and violently, rendering meditation impossible. Ukridge was the sort of man who asks you out to dinner, borrows the money from you to pay the bill, and winds up the evening by embroiling you in a fight with a cabman. I have gone to Covent Garden balls with Ukridge, and found myself legging it down Henrietta Street in the grey dawn, pursued by infuriated costermongers.  I wondered how he had got my address, and on that problem light was immediately cast by Mrs. Medley, who returned, bearing an envelope.  \"It came by the morning post, sir, but it was left at Number Twenty by mistake.\"  \"Oh, thank you.\"  \"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs. Medley.  I recognised the handwriting. The letter, which bore a Devonshire postmark, was from an artist friend of mine, one Lickford, who was at present on a sketching tour in the west. I had seen him off at Waterloo a week before, and I remember that I had walked away from the station wishing that I could summon up the energy to pack and get off to the country somewhere. I hate London in July.  The letter was a long one, but it was the postscript which interested me most.   \"... By the way, at Yeovil I ran into an old friend of ours, Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge, of all people. As large as life--quite six foot two, and tremendously filled out. I thought he was abroad. The last I heard of him was that he had started for Buenos Ayres in a cattle ship, with a borrowed pipe by way of luggage. It seems he has been in England for some time. I met him in the refreshment-room at Yeovil Station. I was waiting for a down train; he had changed on his way to town. As I opened the door, I heard a huge voice entreating the lady behind the bar to 'put it in a pewter'; and there was S. F. U. in a villainous old suit of grey flannels (I'll swear it was the one he had on last time I saw him) with pince-nez tacked on to his ears with ginger-beer wire as usual, and a couple of inches of bare neck showing between the bottom of his collar and the top of his coat--you remember how he could never get a stud to do its work. He also wore a mackintosh, though it was a blazing day.  \"He greeted me with effusive shouts. Wouldn't hear of my standing the racket. Insisted on being host. When we had finished, he fumbled in his pockets, looked pained and surprised, and drew me aside. 'Look here, Licky, old horse,' he said, 'you know I never borrow money. It's against my principles. But I _must_ have a couple of bob. Can you, my dear good fellow, oblige me with a couple of bob till next Tuesday? I'll tell you what I'll do. (In a voice full of emotion). I'll let you have this (producing a beastly little threepenny bit with a hole in it which he had probably picked up in the street) until I can pay you back. This is of more value to me than I can well express, Licky, my boy. A very, very dear friend gave it to me when we parted, years ago... It's a wrench... Still,--no, no... You must take it, you must take it. Licky, old man, shake hands, old horse. Shake hands, my boy.' He then tottered to the bar, deeply moved, and paid up out of the five shillings which he had made it as an after-thought. He asked after you, and said you were one of the noblest men on earth. I gave him your address, not being able to get out of it, but if I were you I should fly while there is yet time.\"   It seemed to me that the advice was good and should be followed. I needed a change of air. London may have suited Doctor Johnson, but in the summer time it is not for the ordinary man. What I wanted, to enable me to give the public of my best (as the reviewer of a weekly paper, dealing with my last work, had expressed a polite hope that I would continue to do) was a little haven in the country somewhere.  I rang the bell.  \"Sir?\" said Mrs. Medley.  \"I'm going away for a bit,\" I said.  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"I don't know where. I'll send you the address, so that you can forward letters.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"And, if Mr. Ukridge calls again...\"  At this point a thunderous knocking on the front door interrupted me. Something seemed to tell me who was at the end of that knocker. I heard Mrs. Medley's footsteps pass along the hall. There was the click of the latch. A volume of sound rushed up the stairs.  \"Is Mr. Garnet in? Where is he? Show me the old horse. Where is the man of wrath? Exhibit the son of Belial.\"  There followed a violent crashing on the stairs, shaking the house.  \"Garnet! Where are you, laddie? Garnet!! GARNET!!!!!\"  Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge was in my midst.    CHAPTER II  MR. AND MRS. S. F. UKRIDGE  I have often thought that Who's Who, though a bulky and well-meaning volume, omits too many of England's greatest men. It is not comprehensive enough. I am in it, nestling among the G's:--  \"Garnet, Jeremy, o.s. of late Henry Garnet, vicar of Much Middlefold, Salop; author. Publications: 'The Outsider,' 'The Manoeuvres of Arthur.' Hobbies: Cricket, football, swimming, golf. Clubs: Arts.\"  But if you search among the U's for UKRIDGE, Stanley Featherstonehaugh, details of whose tempestuous career would make really interesting reading, you find no mention of him. It seems unfair, though I imagine Ukridge bears it with fortitude. That much-enduring man has had a lifetime's training in bearing things with fortitude.  He seemed in his customary jovial spirits now, as he dashed into the room, clinging on to the pince-nez which even ginger-beer wire rarely kept stable for two minutes together.  \"My dear old man,\" he shouted, springing at me and seizing my hand in the grip like the bite of a horse. \"How _are_ you, old buck? This is good. By Jove, this is fine, what?\"  He dashed to the door and looked out.  \"Come on Millie! Pick up the waukeesis. Here's old Garnet, looking just the same as ever. Devilish handsome fellow! You'll be glad you came when you see him. Beats the Zoo hollow!\"  There appeared round the corner of Ukridge a young woman. She paused in the doorway and smiled pleasantly.  \"Garny, old horse,\" said Ukridge with some pride, \"this is _her_! The pride of the home. Companion of joys and sorrows and all the rest of it.
