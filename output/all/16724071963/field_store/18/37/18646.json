The _coupe_ is very roomy; the Newfoundland lies here when he likes, and a chair can be placed on it, or if rugs and a cushion are put down it forms a delightful lounge on a fine day, and this need in no way interfere with the comfort of either the driver or the great dog.  The driver's seat is also the corn-bin, and holds two bushels.  From the broad panel at the other side of the door a board lets down at pleasure, and this forms still another seat for an extra passenger besides myself.  It may also be noticed that the front part of the roof protrudes, forming ample protection against sun and rain.  This canopy is about three feet deep.  The brake, which is handy to the driver, is a very powerful one, and similar to those used on tram-cars.  There is also an iron skid to lock one wheel if required on going down hill, and a roller besides for safety in stopping when going up hill.  There is a door behind right in the centre, similar in appearance to the front door, with morsels of stained glass let in at the upper corners.  Both doors have light shutters that are put up at night.  Under the rear door the broad steps are shipped, and at each side is a little mahogany flap table to let down.  These the valet finds very handy when washing up.  Beneath each of these flaps and under the carriage is a drawer to contain tools, dusters, blacking-brushes, and many a little article, without which comfort on the road could hardly be secured.  Under the caravan are fastened by chain and padlock a light long ladder, a framework used in holding out our after-awning or tent, a spade, and the buckets.  But there is also space enough here in which to hang a hammock.  Under the caravan shafts are carried, which may, however, never be much required.  In order to give some notion of the internal economy of the Wanderer I append a linear plan of her floor.  I may mention first that there is quite as much room inside for even a tall man to stand as there is in a Pullman car.  Entering from behind you may pass through _A_, the pantry or kitchen, into _B_, the saloon.  Folding doors with nice curtains divide the caravan at pleasure into two compartments.  _C_ is the sofa, upholstered in strong blue railway repp.  It is a sofa only by day.  At night it forms the owner's bed.  There are lockers under, which contain the bedclothes, etc, when not in use, as well as my wardrobe.  _D_ is the table, over which is a dainty little bookcase, with at each side a beautiful lamp on brackets.  _E_ is the cupboard, or rather the cheffoniere, both elegant and ornamental, with large looking-glass over and behind it.  It will be noticed that it juts out and on to the _coupe_, and thus not only takes up no room in the saloon, but gives me an additional recess on top for glove-boxes, hanging baskets for handkerchiefs, and nicknacks.  The chiffoniere and the doors are polished mahogany and glass, the bulkheads maple with darker mouldings, the roof like that of a first-class railway carriage, the skylight being broad and roomy, with stained glass and ample means of ventilation.  The other articles of furniture not already mentioned are simple in the extreme, simple but sufficient, and consist of a piano-stool and tiny camp-chair, music-rack, footstool, dressing-case, a few artful cushions, pretty mirrors on the walls, with gilt brackets for coloured candles, a corner bracket with a clock, a guitar, a small harmonium, a violin, a navy sword, and a good revolver.  There are gilded cornices over each window, with neat summer curtains, and also over the chiffoniere recess.  The floor is covered with linoleum, and a Persian rug does duty for a carpet.  The after-cabin contains a rack for dishes, with a cupboard above, a beautiful little carbon-silicated filter,--the best of filters made--a marble washstand, a triangular water-can that hangs above, complete with lid and tap, and which may be taken down to be filled at a well, a rack for hats and gloves, etc, neat pockets for tea and other towels, a box-- my valet's, which is also a seat--and a little flap table, at which he can take his meals and read or write.  Also the Rippingille cooking-range.  This after-cabin is well-ventilated; the folding doors are shot at night, and the valet makes his bed athwartships, as I have already said.  The bed is simply two long soft doormats, with above these a cork mattress.  The latter, with the bedding, are rolled up into an American cloth cover, the former go into a Willesden canvas bag, and are placed under the caravan by day.  No top-coat or anything unsightly hangs anywhere; economy of space has been studied, and this goes hand-in-hand with comfort of fittings to make the gipsy's life on the road as pleasant as ever a gipsy's life can be.  A glance at the illustrations of our saloon and pantry will give a still better idea of the inside of the Wanderer than my somewhat meagre description can afford.  These are from photographs taken by Mr Eales, of Twyford.  [The frontispiece to this book is also by Mr Eales.]  The Rippingille cooking-range is a great comfort.  On cool days it can be used in the pantry, on hot days--or, at pleasure, on any day--it can be placed under our after-tent, and the _chef's_ work got through expeditiously with cleanliness and nicety.  Our caravan _menu_ will at no time be a very elaborate one.  I have long been of opinion, as a medical man and hygienist, that plain living and health are almost synonymous terms, and that intemperance in eating is to blame for the origin of quite as many diseases as intemperance in drinking.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  On Getting Horsed.  A correct knowledge of horseflesh is not one of those things that come intuitively to anybody, though I have sometimes been given to think it did.  It is a kind of science, however, that almost every one, gentle or simple, pretends to be at home in.  Take the opinion of even a draper's assistant about some horse you happen to meet on the road, and lo! he begins to look knowing at once, and will strain a nerve, or even two, in order to give you the impression that _he_ is up to a thing or two.  But let a young man of this kind only see the inside of a stable a few times, then, although he can hardly tell the heel from the knee in the _genus equus_, how glibly does he not begin to talk, till he almost takes your breath away, about capped hocks, side-bones, splints, shoulders, knees, fetlocks, and feet, and as he walks around a horse, feeling him here or smoothing him there, he verily seems to the manner born.  Ladies are seldom very far behind men in their knowledge of hippology. What young girl fresh from school can be found who cannot drive?  \"Oh, give me the reins, I'm sure I can do it.\"  These are her words as often as not.  You do not like to refuse, badly as a broken-kneed horse would look.  You sit by her side ready for any emergency.  _She_ is self-possessed and cool enough.  She may not know her own side of the road, but what does that matter?  If a man be driving the trap that is meeting her, is it not his duty to give place to her?  To be sure it is. And as for the reins, she simply holds them; she evidently regards them as a kind of leathern telephone, to convey the wishes of the driver to the animal in the shafts.  But a man or woman either may be very clever at many things, and still know nothing about horses.  It is their want of candour that should be condemned.  Did not two of the greatest philosophers the world ever saw attempt to put their own nag in the shafts once?  Ah! but the collar puzzled them.  They struggled to get it on for half an hour, their perseverance being rewarded at last by the appearance on the scene of the ostler himself.  I should have liked to have seen that man's face as he quietly observed, suiting action to his words,--  \"It is _usual_, gentlemen, to turn the collar upside down when slippin' it hover the 'orse's 'ead.\"  But what must the horse himself have thought of those philosophers?  Now I do not mind confessing that riding is not one of my strong points. When on horseback there ever prevails in my mind an uncertainty as regards my immediate future.  And I have been told that I do not sit elegantly, that I do not appear to be part and parcel of the horse I bestride.  My want of confidence may in some measure be attributed to the fact that, when a boy of tender age, I saw a gentleman thrown from his horse and killed on the spot.  It was a terrible sight, and at the time it struck me that this must be a very common method of landing from one's steed.  It seems to me the _umbra_ of that sad event has never quite left my soul.  It is due to myself, however, to add that there are many worse whips than I in single harness.  Driving in double harness is harder work, and too engrossing, while \"tandem\" is just one step beyond my present capabilities.  The only time ever I attempted this sort of thing I miserably failed.  My animals went well enough for a time, till all at once it occurred to my leader to turn right round and have a look at me. My team was thus \"heads and tails,\" and as nothing I could think of was equal to the occasion, I gave it up.  Notwithstanding all this, as far as stable duties are concerned, I can reef, steer, and box the compass, so to speak.  I know all a horse needs when well, and might probably treat a sick horse as correctly as some country vets.  No, I cannot shoe a horse, but I know when it is well done.  It is probably the want of technicality about my language when talking to real professed knights of the stable, which causes them to imagine \"I don't know nuffin about an 'orse.\"  This is precisely what one rough old farmer, with whom I was urging a deal, told me.  \"Been at sea all your life, hain't you?\" he added.  \"Figuratively speaking,\" I replied, \"I may have been at sea all my life, but not in reality.  Is not,\" I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37687"],["title","The Cruise of the Land-Yacht \"Wanderer\"; or, Thirteen Hundred Miles in my (#2)"],["body","tinued, parodying Shylock's speech--\"Is not a horse an animal?  Hath not a horse feet, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?  Fed with good oats, oftentimes hurt by the whip?  Subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is?\"  The man scratched his head, looked puzzled, and we did not deal.  But, dear reader, were I to tell one-tenth part of the woes I endured before I got horsed and while still tossed on the ocean of uncertainty and buffeted by the adverse winds of friendly advice, your kindly heart would bleed for me.  I believe my great mistake lay in listening to every body.  One-half of the inhabitants of our village had horses to sell, the other half knew where to find them.  \"You'll want two, you know,\" one would say.  I believed that I would need two.  \"One large cart-horse will be ample,\" said another.  I believed him implicitly.  \"I'd have a pole and two nags,\" said one.  \"I'd have two nags and two pair of shafts,\" said another.  \"I'd have two nags,\" said another; \"one in the shafts and the other to trace.\"  And so on _ad nauseam_ till my brains were all in a whirl, and at night I dreamt I was a teetotum, and people were playing with me.  Perhaps they were.  A friend to whom I appealed one day in my anguish cut the Gordian knot.  \"You've got a nut on you?\" he remarked (he meant my head).  \"Well,\" he said, \"make use of that.\"  I took his advice.  CHAPTER THREE.  FIRST EXPERIENCES OF GIPSY LIFE--THE TRIAL TRIP--A THUNDERSTORM ON MAIDENHEAD THICKET.    \"Now rings the woodland loud and long,   The distance takes a lovelier hue,   And drown'd in yonder living blue   The lark becomes a sightless song.    \"Now dance the lights on lawn and lea,   The flocks are whiter down the vale,   And milkier every milky sail,   On winding stream or distant sea.\"    Tennyson.  It was to be our first outing--our trial trip, \"by the measured mile,\" as navy sailors call it.  Not so much a trial, however, for the caravan itself, as for a certain horse that was to be attached thereto; and, considering the weight of our house upon wheels, I thought it at least doubtful if any one horse would be sufficient to do the work.  The horse in this instance was--a mare.  A splendid powerful dark bay draught mare, with small head, strong, shapely, arching neck, good shoulders, and long enough in body not to look cloddy.  Her tail, about two yards long, had been specially plaited and got up for the occasion.  Matilda, as she was named, had never done anything except ploughing before, unless it were an occasional visit to the railway station with a load of wheat or hay.  But she appeared quiet, and took the situation in at a glance, including the caravan and its master.  We put-to, and after as much manoeuvring as would have sufficed to bring a P. and O. steamer away from a Southampton pier, we cleared the gate and got fairly under way.  In the matter of provisions the Wanderer was amply furnished.  We had edibles for the day, and enough for a week, my wife having been steward and caterer for the occasion.  My companion _voyageurs_ were the two eldest members of my family--Inez (aetat 7), Lovat (aetat 10), their summer dresses and young beauty making them look quite gay.  Besides these, I had Hurricane Bob, my champion Newfoundland, who looked as though he could not quite understand any part of the business.  Very slowly at first walked that mare, and very solemnly too--at a plough-pace, in fact,--and the farmer's man walked soberly on at her neck.  A rousing touch or two of the light gig whip mended matters considerably, and there was far less of the \"Dead March in _Saul_\" about the progress after this.  Matilda warmed to her work; she neighed merrily, and even got into a kind of swinging trot, which, properly speaking, was neither trot nor tramp, only it took us over the ground at four knots an hour, and in pity I made the farmer's man--who, by the way, had his Sunday clothes all on--get up and sit down.  The morning was very bright and sunny, the road hard and good, but dusty.  This latter was certainly a derivative from our pleasure, but then gipsies do not have it all their own way in this world any more than other people.  The wind was with us, and was somewhat uncertain, both in force and direction, veering a little every now and then, and soon coming round again.  But a select assortment of juvenile whirlwinds had been let loose from their cave, and these did not add to our delight.  Matilda had plenty of pluck, only she must have thought it an exceedingly long furrow, and at the end of two miles suddenly made up her mind to go about of her own accord.  This determination on Matilda's part resulted in a deviation from the straight line, which nearly landed our fore wheels in the ditch; it also resulted in admonitory flagellation for Matilda.  Before we had gone three miles the perspiration was streaming down the mare's legs and meandering over her hoofs, so we pulled up to let her breathe.  The day was young, it was all before us, and it is or ought to be in the very nature of every gipsy--amateur or professional--to take no note of time, to possess all the apathy of a Dutchman, all the drowsy independence of a garden tortoise.  The children begged for a cake, and Inez wanted to know what made the horse laugh so.  She might well put this question, for Matilda neighed nearly all the way.  \"Why, pa,\" said Inie, \"the horse laughs at everything; he laughs at the trees, he laughs at the flowers, and at the ponds.  He laughs at every horse he meets; he laughed at the cows cropping the furze, and at the geese on the common, and now he is laughing at that old horse with its forefeet tied together.  What are the old horse's forefeet tied together for, pa?\"  \"To keep him from running away, darling.\"  \"And what does this horse keep on laughing for?\"  \"Why, he is so proud, you know, of being harnessed to so beautiful a caravan, that he can't help laughing.  He wants to draw the attention of every creature he sees to it.  He will be sure to dream about it to-night, and if he wakes up any time before morning he will laugh again.\"  \"Oh!\" said Inie, and went on eating her currant-cake thoughtfully.  In about a quarter of an hour we had started again.  Lovat, who had been aft having a view at the back door window, came running forward and said excitedly,--  \"Oh! pa, there is a gentleman with a carriage and pair behind us, making signs and shouting and waving his whip.\"  I pulled to the side at once, and the party in the waggonette passed, the gentleman who handled the ribbons scowling and looking forked lightning at us.  No wonder, the idea of being stopped on the road by itinerant gipsies!  Well, in driving a large caravan, as you cannot look behind nor see behind, it is as well to keep pretty near your own side of the road. This was a lesson I determined to lay to heart.  But if seeing behind me was impossible, hearing was quite as much so, unless it had been the firing of a six-pounder.  This was owing to the rattling of things inside the van, for, it being but our trial trip, things had not settled shipshape.  It is but fair to the builders of the Wanderer to say that an easier-going craft or trap never left Bristol.  The springs are as strong and easy as ever springs were made.  There is no disagreeable motion, but there is--no, I mean there was on that first day--a disagreeable rattling noise.  Nothing inside was silent; nothing would hold its tongue.  No wonder our mare Matilda laughed.  The things inside the sideboard jingled and rang, edged towards each other, hobnobbed by touching sides, then edged off again.  The crystal flower-boat on the top made an uneasy noise, the crimson-tinted glass lampshades made music of their own _in tremolo_, and the guitar fell out of its corner on top of my cremona and cracked a string.  So much for the saloon; but in the pantry the concert was at its loudest and its worse--plates and dishes, cups and saucers, tumblers and glasses, all had a word to say, and a song to sing; while as for the tin contents of the Rippingille cooking-range--the kettle and frying-pan, and all the other odds and ends--they constituted a complete band of their own, and a very independent one it was.  Arab tom-toms would hardly have been heard alongside that range.  With bits of paper and chips of wood I did what I could to stop the din, and bit my lip and declared war _a outrance_ against so unbearable a row.  The war is ended, and I am victor.  Nothing rattles much now; nothing jangles; nothing sings or speaks or squeaks.  My auxiliaries in restoring peace have been--wedge-lets of wood, pads of indiarubber, and nests of cottonwool and tow; and the best of it is that there is nothing unsightly about any of my arrangements after all.  But to resume our journey.  As there came a lull in the wind, and consequently some surcease in the rolling storm of dust, we stopped for about an hour at the entrance to Maidenhead Thicket.  The children had cakes, and they had books, and I had proofs to correct--nice easy work on a day's outing!  Meanwhile great banks of clouds (_cumulus_) came up from the north-east and obscured the sun and most of the sky, only leaving ever-changing rifts of blue here and there, and the wind went down.  Maidenhead Thicket is a long stretch of wild upland--a well-treed moor, one might call it, and yet a breezy, healthful tableland.  The road goes straight through it, with only the greensward, level with the road at each side, then two noble rows of splendid trees, mostly elm and lime, with here and there a maple or oak.  But abroad, on the thicket itself, grow clumps of trees of every description, and great masses of yellow blossoming furze and golden-tasselled broom.  To our left the thicket ended afar off in woods, with the round braeland called Bowsy Hill in the distance; to the right, also in woods, but finally in a great"]]]
