McBain was right.  The young blood in Rory's veins soon reasserted itself, and after half-an-hour's rest he seemed as well as ever.  His first action on awaking was to put his hand to his brow, and his first words were,--  \"What is it at all, and where am I?  Have I been in any trouble?\"  \"Trouble, Rory?\" said Allan, pressing his hand.  \"Well, you and Ralph went tumbling over a cliff.\"  \"Only fifty feet of a fall, Rory,\" said Ralph.  Rory sat bolt upright now, and opened his eyes in astonishment.  \"Och! now I remember,\" he said, \"that we had a bit of a fall--But fifty feet! do you tell me so?  Indeed then it's a wonder there is one single whole bone between the two of us.  But where is my sketch-book?\"  \"Here you are,\" said Allan.  \"Oh!\" said Rory, opening the book, \"this is worse than all; the prettiest sketch ever I made in my life all spoiled with the snow.\"  \"Now, boys,\" continued Rory, after a pause, \"I grant you this is a very romantic situation--everything is romantic bar the smoke; but what are we waiting for? and is this your Castle of Arrandoon, my friend?\"  \"Not quite,\" replied Allan, laughing.  \"We are waiting for you to recover, and--\"  \"Well, sure enough,\" cried Rory, \"I have recovered.\"  He jumped up as he spoke, kicked out his legs, and stretched out his arms.  \"No; never a broken bone,\" he said.  Now it had been arranged between Allan and McBain that Rory should ride in the cart, while they and Ralph should walk.  But Rory was aghast at such a proposal.  \"What,\" he cried; \"is it a procession you'd make of me?  Would you put me on straw in the bottom of a cart, like an old wife coming from a fair?\"  \"But,\" persisted Allan, \"you must be weak from the loss of blood.\"  \"Loss of blood,\" laughed Rory, \"don't be chaffing a poor boy.  If you'd seen the blood I lost at the last election, and all in the cause of peace and honour, too!  No, indeed; I'll walk.\"  The storm was at its very worst when they once more emerged from the pine-wood, but every now and then they could see the light glimmering from one of the castle turrets, to guide them through the darkness. They sent the dogs on before to give notice of their approach; then Peter tuned up, and high above the roaring of the snow rose the scream of the great Highland bagpipe.  A few hours afterwards, the three friends had all but forgotten their perilous adventure among the snow, or remembered it only to make merry over it.  It is needless to say that Allan's mother and sister welcomed his friends, or that Ralph and Rory were charmed with the reception they received.  \"Well,\" said Rory, after the ladies had retired for the night, \"I fully understand now what your poet Burns meant when he said--  \"`In heaven itself I'll ask nae mair Than just a Highland welcome.'\"  And now they gathered round the cosy hearth, on which great logs were blazing.  McBain was relegated to an armchair in a corner, being the oldest Rory, who still felt the effects of his fall, reclined on a couch in front, with Ralph seated on one side and Allan on the other.  Bran, the deer-hound, thought this too good a chance to be thrown away, so he got upon the sofa and lay with his great, honest head on Rory's knees, while Kooran curled himself up on the hearthrug, and Oscar watched the door.  \"Well,\" said Ralph, \"I call this delightful; and the idea of doing the Highlands in mid-winter is decidedly a new one, and that is saying a great deal.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rory, laughing; \"and a beautiful taste we've had of it to begin with.  I fall over a cliff in the snow and Ralph comes tumbling after, just like Jack and Jill, and then we go to sleep like lambs, and waken with a taste of spirits in our mouths.  Indeed yes, boys, it is romantic entirely.\"  \"Everything now-a-days,\" said Ralph, with half a yawn, \"is so hackneyed, as it were.  You go up the Rhine--that is hackneyed.  You go down the Mediterranean--that is hackneyed.  You go here, there, and everywhere, and you find here, there, and everywhere hackneyed.  And if you go into a drawing-room and begin to speak of where you've been and what you've done, you soon find that every other fellow has been to the same places, and done precisely the same things.\"  \"Sure, you're right, Ralph,\" said Rory; \"and I do believe if you were to go to the moon and come back, some fellow would meet you on your return and lisp out, `Oh, been to the moon, have you! awfly funny old place the moon.  Did you call on the Looneys when you were there?  Jolly family the Looneys.'\"  \"There is a kind of metaphorical truth in what you say, Rory,\" Ralph replied; \"but I say, Allan, wouldn't it be nice to go somewhere where no one--no white man--had ever been before, or do something never before accomplished?\"  \"It would indeed,\" said Allan; \"and I for one always looked upon Livingstone, and Stanley, and Gordon Cumming, and Cameron, and men like them, as the luckiest fellows in the world.\"  \"Now,\" said Ralph, \"I'm just nineteen.  I've only two years more of what I call roving life, and if I don't ride across some continent before I'm twenty-one, or embark at one end of some unknown river and come out into the sea at the other, I'll never have a chance again.\"  \"Why, how is that?\" said McBain.  \"Well,\" replied Ralph, \"Sir Walter Leigh, my father, told me straight that we were as poor as Church mice, and that in order to retrieve our fortunes, as soon as I came of age I must marry my grandmother.\"  \"Marry your grandmother!\" exclaimed McBain, half rising in his chair.  \"Well, my cousin, then,\" said Ralph, smiling; \"she is five-and-forty, so it is all the same.  But she has oceans of money, and my old father, bless him! is very, very good and kind.  He doesn't limit me in money now; though, of course, I don't take advantage of all his generosity. `Go and travel, my boy,' he said, `and enjoy yourself till you come of age.  Just see all you can and thus have your fling.  I know I can trust you.'\"  \"Have your fling?\" cried Rory; \"troth now that is exactly what my Irish tenants told me to do.  `The sorra a morsel av rint have we got to give you,' says they, `so go and have your fling, but 'deed and indeed, if we see you here again until times are mended, we'll shoot ye as dead as a Ballyshannon rabbit.'\"  \"Well, young gentlemen,\" said McBain, after a pause in the conversation, during which nothing was heard except the crackling of the blazing logs and the mournful moaning of the wind without, \"you want to do something quite new.  Well, I've got an idea.\"  \"Oh, do tell us what it is?\" cried Ralph and Rory, both in one breath.  \"No, no; not to-night,\" said McBain, laughing; \"besides, it wants working out a bit, so I'm off to bed to dream about it.  Good night.\"  \"Depend upon it,\" said Allan McGregor, as he parted with his friends at their chamber door, \"that whatever it is, McBain's idea is a good one, and he'll tell us all about it to-morrow.  You'll see.\"  CHAPTER THREE.  LIFE AT THE OLD CASTLE--MCBAIN EXPLAINS HIS \"IDEA\"--ALLAN'S DREAM.  To say that our heroes, Ralph and Rory, were not a little impatient to know something about the scheme McBain was to propose for the purpose of giving them pleasure, would be equivalent to saying that they were not boys, or that they had men's heads upon boys' shoulders.  So I willingly confess that it was the very first thing they thought about next morning, immediately after they had drawn up the blinds, to peep out and see what kind of a day it was going to be.  But this peeping out to ascertain the state of the weather was not so easily accomplished, as it would have been in the south of England.  For fairy fingers seemed to have been at work during the night, and the panes were covered with a frost-work of ferns and leaves, more beautifully traced, more artistically finished, than the work of any human designer that ever lived.  The whole seemed floured over with powdered snow.  It was a pity, so thought Rory, to spoil the pattern on even one of the panes, but it had to be done, so by breathing on it for quite half a minute, a round, clear space was obtained; and gazing through this he could see that it was a glorious morning, that the clouds had all fled, that the sky was bluer than ever he had seen a sky before, that the wind was hushed, and the sun shining brightly over hills of dazzling white.  The stems of the leafless trees looked like pillars of frosted silver, while their branches were more lovely by far than the coral that lies beneath the blue waves of the Indian Ocean.  \"How different this is,\" said Rory, \"from anything we ever see in England!  Ah! sure, it was a good idea our coming here in winter.\"  \"I wonder where McBain is this morning?\" said Ralph.  \"And I know right well,\" said Rory, \"what you're thinking about.\"  \"Perhaps you do,\" Ralph replied.  \"Ay, that I do,\" said Rory; \"but don't be an old wife, Ralph--never evince undue curiosity, never exhibit impatience.  In other words, don't be a squaw.\"  \"Oho!\" cried Ralph, \"now I see where the land lies.  `Don't be a squaw,' eh?  You've been reading Fenimore Cooper, you old rogue, you!  The centre of a great forest in the Far West of America--midnight--a council of war--chiefs squatting around the camp fire--smoking the calumet-- enter Eagle-eye--scats himself in silence--everybody burning to hear what he has to say, but no one dares ask for the world--ugh! and all that sort of thing.  Am I right, Rory?\"  \"Indeed you are,\" said the other, laughing; \"you've bowled me out, I confess.  But, after all, you know, it will be just as well not to seem impatient, and so I move that we never speak a word to McBain about what he said last night until he is pleased to open the conversation.\"  \"Right,\" said Ralph; \"and now let us go down to breakfast.\"  Both Mrs McGregor and Allan's sister Helen were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38276"],["title","The Cruise of the Snowbird: A Story of Arctic Adventure (#4)"],["body"," different from what Ralph and Rory had expected to find them.  They had taken their notions of Highland ladies from the novels of Walter Scott and other literary worthies.  Before they had come to Glentroom they had pictured to themselves Mrs McGregor as a kind of Spartan mother--tall, stately, dark, and proud, with a most exalted idea of her own importance, with an inexorable hatred of all the Saxon race, and an inordinate love of spinning.  Her daughter, they had thought, must also be tall, and, if beautiful, of a kind of majestic and stately beauty, repellent more than attractive, and one more to be feared than loved.  And they felt sure that Mrs McGregor would be almost constantly bending over her spinning-wheel, while Helen, if ever she condescended to bend over anything, which they had deemed a matter of doubt, would be bending over a very ancient piece of goods in the shape of a harp.  These were their imaginings prior to their arrival at the castle, but these ideas were all wrong, and very delighted were the young men to find them so.  Here in Mrs McGregor was no stiff fastidious lady; she was a very _woman_ and a very _mother_, loving her children tenderly, and devoted to their interests, and rejoiced to hold out the hand of welcome to her children's friends.  On the sunny side of fifty, she was slightly inclined to _embonpoint_, extremely pleasant both in voice and manner as well as in face.  Rory first, and Ralph soon afterwards, felt as much at home in her presence and company as if they had known her all their lives.  As to Helen Edith, I do not think that any one would have been able to guess her nationality had they met her in society in town.  She had been educated principally abroad, and could speak both the Italian and French languages, not only fluently, but, if I may be allowed the expression, mellifluently, for she possessed perfection of accent as well as exceeding sweetness of voice.  She was rather small in stature, with pretty and shapely hands, and a nice figure.  Was she beautiful? you may ask me.  Well, had you asked her brother he would have said, \"Indeed, I never gave the matter a thought,\" but Rory and Ralph would have told you that she _was_ beautiful, and they would have added the words, \"and sisterly.\"  I do not know whether or not Helen was a better or a worse musician than most young girls of her age--she was just turned seventeen.  She sang sweetly, though not loudly; she never screamed, but sang with expression, as if she felt what she sang; and she accompanied herself on the harp.  But as for Mrs McGregor's spinning-wheel, why, our young heroes cast their eyes about in vain for it.  The portion of the castle now occupied by the McGregors was furnished in a far more luxurious style than probably accorded with their fallen fortunes, but everywhere there was evidence of refinement of taste.  The old hall and the picture gallery delighted Rory most; he could fit a romance into every rusty coat of mail, and fix a poem to every spear and helmet.  \"What a grand thing,\" he said to Allan, \"it is to have had ancestors! Never one had I, that I know of--leastways, none of them ever troubled themselves to sit for their portraits.  More by token, perhaps, they couldn't afford it.\"  If Ralph enjoyed himself at the castle--and I might say that he undoubtedly did--he did not say a very great deal about it.  To give vocal expression to his pleasure was not much in Ralph's line, but it was in Rory's, who, by the way, although nearly as old as his companion, was far more of a boy.  The feelings of the young chief of the McGregors, while showing his friends over the old castle, the ancient home of his fathers, were those of sadness, mingled with a very little touch of pride.  Every room had its story, every chamber its tale--often one of sorrow; and these were listened to by Ralph and Rory with rapt attention, although every now and then some curious or quaint remark from the lips of the latter would set the other two laughing, and often materially damage some relation of events that bordered closely on the romantic.  \"If ever I'm rich enough,\" said Allan, leading the way into the ancient banqueting-hall, \"I mean to re-roof and re-furnish the whole of the older portion of the castle.\"  \"But wherever has the roof gone to?\" asked Rory, looking upwards at the sky above them.  \"Fire would explain that,\" replied Allan; \"the whole of this wing of the building was burned by Cumberland in '45--he who was surnamed the Bloody Duke, you know.\"  \"Were your people `out,' as you call it, in '45?\" asked Ralph.  Allan nodded, and bit his lips; the memory of that terrible time was not a pleasant one to this Highland chief.  The little turret chambers were a source of both interest and curiosity to Allan's companions.  \"Bedrooms and watch-towers, are they?\" said Ralph, viewing them critically.  \"Well, you catch a beautiful glimpse of the glen, and the hills, and woods, and lake from that little narrow window, with its solitary iron stanchion; but I say, Allan--bedrooms, eh?  Aren't you joking, old man?  Fancy a great tall lanky fellow like me in a bedroom this size; why, I'd have to double up like a jack-knife!\"  \"Oh! look, Ralph, at these dark, mysterious stains on the oaken floor,\" cried Rory--\"blood, of course?  Do you know, Allan, my boy, what particular deed of darkness was committed in this turret chamber?\"  \"I do, precisely,\" replied Allan.  \"Och! tell us, then--tell us!\" said Rory.  \"Ay, do,\" said Ralph.  \"I shall lean against the window here and look out, for the view is delightful, but I'll be listening all the same.\"  \"Well, then,\" said Allan, \"I made this little room my study for a few months last summer, and I spilt some ink there.\"  \"Now, indeed, indeed,\" cried romantic Rory, \"that is a shame to put us off like that.  Never mind, Ralph; _we_ know it is a blood-stain, and if Allan won't tell us the story, then, we'll invent one.  Sure, now,\" he continued, \"I'd like to sleep here.\"  \"You'd catch your death of cold from the damp,\" said Allan.  Rory wheeled him right round to the light, and gazed at him funnily from top to toe, and from toe to top.  \"You're a greater curiosity than the fine old castle itself,\" said Rory; \"and I don't believe there is an ounce of romance in the whole big body of you.  Now, if the place was mine, there isn't a room--why, what is that?\"  \"That's the gong,\" said Allan, \"and it says plainly enough, `Get r-r-r-r-ready for dinner.'\"  \"Well, but,\" persisted Rory, \"just before we go down below show us the corridor where the ghost walks at midnight, and the door through which it disappears.\"  \"A ghost!\" said Allan; \"indeed, I never knew there was one.\"  \"Ah! but,\" Rory continued, \"you never knew there _wasn't_.  Well, then, say _probably_ there is a ghost, because you know, old fellow, in an ancient family like yours there must be a ghost.  There must be some old fogey or another who didn't think he was very well done by in this world, and feels bound to come back and walk about at midnight, and all that sort of thing.  Pray, Allan, don't break the spell.  You're welcome to the stains if you please, but 'deed and indeed, I mean to stick to the ghost.\"  The first few days of their stay in Glentroom were spent in what Allan called \"doing nothing,\" for unless he left the castle for the hill, the river, or the lake, he did not consider he was doing anything.  Within the castle walls, however, Rory for one was not idle.  There was, in his opinion, a deal to be seen and a deal to be done: he had to make acquaintance with every living thing about the place--ponies and dogs, cattle and pigs, ducks, geese, fowl, and pigeons.  Old Janet averred that she had never seen such a boy in all her born days--that he turned the castle upside down, and kept all the \"beasties\" in an uproar; but at the same time she added that he was the prettiest boy ever she'd seen, and \"Heaven bless his bonnie face,\" which put her in mind of her dear dead boy Donald, and she couldn't be angry with him, for even when he was doing mischief he made her laugh.  The parish in which Glentroom lies is a very wide one indeed, and contained at the time our tale opens many families of distinction. Nearly all of these were on visiting terms with the McGregors, and many a beautifully-fitted sledge used to drive over the drawbridge of Arrandoon Castle during the winter months--wheels, of course, were out of the question when the snow lay thick on the ground--so that life in Allan's family, although it did not partake of the gaiety of the London season, was by no means a dull one, and both Ralph and Rory thought the evenings spent in the drawing-room were very enjoyable indeed.  Ralph was a good conversationalist and a good listener: he delighted in hearing music, while Rory delighted to play, and, for his years, he was a violinist of no mean order.  He had never been known to go anywhere-- not even on the shortest of holiday tours--without the long black case that contained his pet instrument.  Now, as none of \"the resident gentry,\" as they were called, who visited at the castle have anything at all to do with our story, I shall not fatigue my readers by introducing them.  And why, it may be asked, should I trouble myself about describing life at the castle at all?  And where is the _Snowbird_?--for doubtless you have guessed already that it is a ship of some kind.  The _Snowbird_ ere very long will sail majestically up that Highland lake before you, and in her, along with our heroes, you and I, reader, will embark, and together we will journey afar over the ocean wave, to regions hitherto but little known to man.  Our adventures there will be many, wild, and varied, and some of them, too, so far from pleasant, that while exiled in the frozen seas of the far North, our thoughts will oftentimes turn fondly homewards, and we will think with a joy borrowed from the past of the quiet and peaceful days we spent in bonnie"]]]
