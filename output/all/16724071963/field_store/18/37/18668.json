Since the inception of this project by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers much argument has arisen as to the values of the dam and reservoir as opposed to the values of farmland and cultural establishments to be inundated (Schoewe, 1953; Monfort, 1956; and Van Orman, 1956). Also, there has been some concern about the possible effects of impoundment on the fish-resources of the area, which supports \"a catfish fishery that is notable throughout most of the State of Kansas and in some neighboring states (U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1953:9).\" The objectives of my study, conducted from March 30, 1957, to August 9, 1958, were to record the species of fish present and their relative abundance in the stream system, and to obtain a measure of angler success prior to closure of the dam. These data may be used as a basis for future studies on the fish and fishing in the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas.     ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   I thank Messrs. J. E. Deacon, D. A. Distler, Wallace Ferrel, D. L. Hoyt, F. E. Maendele, C. O. Minckley, B. C. Nelson, and J. C. Tash for assistance in the field and for valuable suggestions. Dr. J. B. Elder, Kansas State College, arranged for loan of specimens, and Mr. B. C. Nelson supplied data on _Notropis deliciosus_ (Girard) in Kansas, and on specimens in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology.  I thank the many landowners who allowed me access to streams in the Big Blue River Basin. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District, also allowed access in the reservoir area, and furnished information and some photographs. Mr. J. C. Tash did chemical determinations on my water samples.  Dr. Frank B. Cross guided me in this study and in preparation of this report. Drs. E. Raymond Hall and K. B. Armitage offered valuable suggestions on the manuscript. Equipment and funds for my study were furnished by the State Biological Survey of Kansas, and the Kansas Forestry, Fish and Game Commission granted necessary permits.     TUTTLE CREEK DAM AND RESERVOIR   The data on Tuttle Creek Dam and Reservoir that follow were furnished by Mr. Donald D. Poole, U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Kansas City District. The dam, an earth-fill structure, will be 7,500 feet in length, with a maximum height of 157 feet above the valley floor. Release of water will be from beneath the west end of the dam, through two tunnels 20 feet in diameter that have a capacity of 45,000 cubic feet per second; however, releases exceeding 25,000 c. f. s. are not planned. The gated spillway is located at the east end of the dam. Freeboard will be 23 feet at the top of flood-control pool.  The reservoir will have a maximum pool of 2,280,000 acre-feet capacity, a 53,500-acre surface area, and 368 miles of shoreline. The present operational plan provides for a conservation pool having a surface area of 15,700 acres, a shoreline of 112 miles, and a length of 20 miles.     BIG BLUE RIVER BASIN   Big Blue River and its tributaries, a sub-basin of the Kansas River System, drain approximately 9,600 square miles, of which 2,484 miles are in Kansas (Colby, _et al._, 1956:44). The headwaters of the Big Blue River are in central Hamilton County, Nebraska, near the Platte River (Fig. 1). The stream flows generally south and east for 283 miles to its confluence with the Kansas River near Manhattan, Kansas. Little Blue River, the largest tributary to the Big Blue, rises in eastern Kearney and western Adams counties, Nebraska, and flows southeast for 208 miles to join the Big Blue near Blue Rapids, Kansas (Nebraska State Planning Board, 1936:628). The Big Blue River Basin varies in width from 129 miles in the northwest, to approximately ten miles near the mouth (Colby, _et al._, 1956:44).     GEOLOGY OF THE BASIN   In Kansas, outcrops of Pennsylvanian and Cretaceous age occur along the extreme eastern and western sides of the Big Blue River Basin, respectively, whereas Permian beds (overlain by Pleistocene deposits) occur throughout most of the remainder of the watershed (see Moore and Landes, 1937). The Big Blue and Little Blue rivers and their tributaries have deeply incised the Permian beds of the Flint Hills in Kansas, exposing limestones and shales of the Admire, Council Grove, Chase, and Sumner groups (Wolfcampian and Leonardian series) (Walters, 1954:41-44). Pleistocene deposits in the Big Blue Basin in Kansas consist of alluvium, glacial till, and glacial outwash from the Kansan glacial stage, overlain by loess deposits of Wisconsin and Recent stages (Frye and Leonard, 1952: pl. 1).     [Illustration: FIG. 1. Big Blue River Basin, Kansas and Nebraska.]  The Big Blue River was formed \"in part on the till plain surface and in part by integration of spillway channels,\" in the latter portion of the Kansan glaciation (Frye and Leonard, 1952:192). This stream, and the Republican River to the west, carried waters from the areas that are now the Platte, Niobrara, and upper Missouri River basins (Lugn, 1935:153). Drainage was southward, through Oklahoma, until establishment of the east-flowing Kansas River (Frye and Leonard, 1952:189-190). As Kansan ice receded the Blue and Republican rivers retained what is now the Platte River Basin. The lower Platte River developed and the surface drainage became distinct in the Iowan (Tazwellian) portion of the Wisconsin glacial stage (Lugn, 1935:152-153). However, according to Lugn (1935:203) the Platte River Basin contributes about 300,000 acre-feet of water per year to the Big Blue and Republican rivers by percolation through sands and gravels underlying the uplands that now separate the basins.     CLIMATE, POPULATION, AND LAND-USE   Climate of the Big Blue River Basin is of the subhumid continental type, with an average annual precipitation of 22 inches in the northwest and 30 inches in the southeast. The mean annual evaporation from water surfaces exceeds annual precipitation by approximately 30 inches (Colby, _et al._, 1956:32-33).  The average annual temperature for the basin is 53° F. (Flora, 1948:148). According to Kincer (1941:704-705) the average temperature in July, the warmest month, is 78° F., and the coolest month, January, averages 28° F. Periods of extreme cold and heat are sometimes of long duration. Length of the growing season varies from less than 160 days in the northwest to 180 days in the southeast (Kincer, _loc. cit._).  The human population of the Big Blue Basin varies from about 90 persons per square mile in one Nebraska county in the northwest and one Kansas county in the southeast, to as few as six persons per square mile in some northeastern counties. The population is most dense along the eastern border of the basin, decreasing toward the west. This decrease in population is correlated with the decrease in average annual precipitation from east to west (Colby, _et al._, 1956:80).  The principal land-use in the Big Blue Watershed is tilled crops, with wheat, sorghums, and corn being most important. Beef cattle are important in some portions of the basin. Colby, _et al._ (1956:24) reported that in 1954 as much as 55 per cent of the land in some counties near the mouth of the Big Blue River was in pasture. Only one Nebraska county had less than 15 per cent in pastureland.     PHYSICAL FEATURES OF STREAMS   Streams of the Big Blue River Basin are of three kinds: turbid, sandy-bottomed streams, usually 150 to 300 feet in width; relatively clear, mud-bottomed streams, ten to 60 feet in width; and clear, deeply incised, gravel-bottomed streams, usually five to 30 feet in width.  SAND-BOTTOMED STREAMS.--The Big Blue and Little Blue rivers represent this kind of stream. The bottoms of these rivers consist almost entirely of fine sand; nevertheless, their channels are primarily deep and fairly uniform in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37742"],["title","Fishes of the Big Blue River Basin, Kansas (#1)"],["body","h, rather than broad, shallow, and braided as in the larger Kansas and Arkansas rivers in Kansas (Plate 11, Fig. 1). In the Big Blue River, gravel occurs rarely on riffles, and gravel-rubble bottoms are found below dams (Plate 11, Fig. 2). The Big Blue flows over a larger proportion of gravelly bottom than does the Little Blue.  Big Blue River rises at about 1,800 feet above mean sea level and joins the Kansas River at an elevation of 1,000 feet above m. s. l. The average gradient is 2.8 feet per mile. Little Blue River, originating at 2,200 feet, has an average gradient of 5.3 feet per mile, entering the Big Blue at 1,100 feet above mean sea level (Nebraska State Planning Board, 1936:628, 637). The Little Blue is the shallower stream, possibly because of the greater amount of sandy glacial deposits in its watershed and the swift flow that may cause lateral cutting, increased movement, and \"drifting\" of the sandy bottom.  For approximately a 50-year period, stream-flow in the Big Blue River at its point of entry into Kansas (Barnston, Nebraska) averaged 603 cubic feet per second, with maximum and minimum instantaneous flows of 57,700 c. f. s. and one c. f. s. The Little Blue River at Waterville, Kansas, averaged a daily discharge of 601 c. f. s. (maximum 50,400, minimum 28). Below the confluence of the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers, at Randolph, Kansas, the average daily discharge was 1,690 c.f.s. (maximum 98,000, minimum 31) (Kansas Water Resources Fact-finding and Research Committee, 1955:27).  The turbidity of the Big Blue River, as determined by use of a Jackson turbidimeter, varied from 27 parts per million in winter (January 10, 1958) to as high as 14,000 p.p.m. (July 12, 1958). The Little Blue River has similar turbidities, with high readings being frequent. In the summer of 1957, pH ranged from 7.2 to 8.4 in the Big Blue River Basin--values that correspond closely with those of Canfield and Wiebe (1931:3) who made 25 determinations ranging from 7.3 to 8.3 in the streams of the Nebraskan portion of this basin in July, 1930. Surface temperatures at various stations varied from 38° F. on January 10, 1958, to 90° F. in backwater-areas on July 19, 1957. The average surface temperature at mid-day in July and August, 1957, was approximately 86.5° F.  Chemical determinations were made on water-samples from my Station 4-S on the Big Blue River, and Station 50-S on the Little Blue (Table 1). These samples were taken from the surface in strong current. Determinations were made by methods described in _Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage_, 10th edition, 1955.

Many of the hills are virgin bluestem prairies (_Andropogon_ spp.), but the floodplains are heavily cultivated.  MUD-BOTTOMED STREAMS.--Streams of this kind are present in the watershed of the Black Vermillion River that enters Big Blue River from the east. The area east of the Big Blue River and north of the Black Vermillion River is till plains, where relief seldom exceeds 100 feet (Walters, 1954:12). Streams in this portion of the basin, and streams entering the Little Blue River from the west (Mill Creek and Horseshoe Creek systems), tend to have V-shaped channels, fewer riffles than the Little Blue and Big Blue rivers and in the gravelly streams (to be described later), and have bottoms of mud or clay, with few rocks (Plate 12, Fig. 1). However, in the extreme headwaters of most western tributaries of the Little Blue River (in Washington and Republic counties) sandy bottoms predominate. The Black Vermillion River flows on a broad floodplain and is a mud-bottomed, sluggish stream, with an average gradient of approximately one foot per mile. Fringe-forests of elm, cottonwood, sycamore, and willow persist along most of these stream-courses.  Notwithstanding the mud bottoms, the water in this kind of stream in the Big Blue Basin remains clearer than that of the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers. Heavy algal blooms were noted in the Black Vermillion River and Mill Creek, Washington County, in 1957 and 1958. Temperatures at Stations 45-M and 46-M on Mill Creek, Washington County, averaged 85.5° F. on July 31, 1957. Chemical characteristics of a water-sample from Station 35-M, Black Vermillion River, are in Table 1.  GRAVEL-BOTTOMED STREAMS.--Most streams of this kind are tributary to the Big Blue River; however, streams entering Black Vermillion River from the south are also of this type (Plate 12, Fig. 2). The streams are \"characteristically a series of large pools (to 100 feet in length and more than two feet in depth) connected by short riffles and smaller pools\" (Minckley and Cross, in press). The average gradients are high: Carnahan Creek, 33 feet per mile; Mill Creek, Riley County, 21 feet; Clear Creek, 16 feet per mile. Stream-flow is usually less than five cubic feet per second. In summer, these streams may become intermittent, but springs and subsurface percolation maintain pool-levels (Minckley and Cross, _loc. cit._).  The average temperatures of these small streams (79.5° to 81.0° F. in July and August, 1957) were lower than temperatures in stream-types previously described. Turbidities were usually less than 25 p.p.m. The chemical properties of water-samples from two of these streams (Stations 11-G and 18-G) are listed in Table 1.     PREVIOUS RECORDS OF FISHES   The earliest records of fishes from the Big Blue River Basin are those of Cragin (1885) and Graham (1885) in independently published lists of the fishes of Kansas. Meek (1895) recorded fishes collected in 1891 \"from both branches of the Blue River, a few miles west of Crete, Nebraska.\" Evermann and Cox (1896) reported five collections from the Nebraskan part of the basin. Their collections were made in October, 1892, and August, 1893, and the stations were: in 1892, Big Blue River at Crete; in 1893, Big Blue River at Seward, Lincoln Creek at Seward and York, and Beaver Creek at York.  Canfield and Wiebe (1931) obtained fish from 18 localities in Nebraska in July, 1930; however, their major concern was determination of water quality. Their stations were: Big Blue River at Stromsburg, Polk Co.; Surprise and Ulysses, Butler Co.; Staplehurst, Seward, and Milford, Seward Co.; Crete and Wilber, Saline Co.; Beatrice, Blue Springs, and Barnston, Gage Co.; Little Blue River at Fairbury, Jefferson Co.; Hebron, Thayer Co.; Sandy Creek at Alexandria, Thayer Co.; West Fork of Big Blue River at Stockham, Hamilton Co.; McCool Junction, York Co.; Beaver Crossing, Seward Co.; and Beaver Creek at York, York Co.  Breukelman (1940) and Jennings (1942) listed fishes from the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History and the Kansas State College Museum, respectively, including some specimens collected from the Big Blue River System in Kansas. Because records in these two papers pertain to collections that were widely spaced in the basin and in time, the specific localities are not given herein. One of Jennings' (_loc. cit.)_ records, _Scaphirhynchus platorynchus_ (Rafinesque), was cited by Bailey and Cross (1954:191). More recently, Minckley and Cross (in press) recorded several localities, and cited some papers mentioned above, in a publication dealing with _Notropis topeka_ (Gilbert) in Kansas.  Information on the fishes of the Nebraskan portion of the Big Blue River Basin was compiled, and additional localities were reported, in a doctoral thesis by Dr. Raymond E. Johnson, entitled The Distribution of Nebraska Fishes, 1942, at the University of Michigan.     METHODS AND MATERIALS   _Collection of Fishes_  The gear and techniques used are listed below:  ENTRAPMENT DEVICES.--Hoop and fyke nets and wire traps were used for 288 trap/net hours in 1957. The nets were not baited, and were set parallel to the current, with the mouths downstream. Hoop nets were 1½ to three feet in diameter at the first hoop, with a pot-mesh of one inch; fyke nets were three feet at the first hoop, pot-mesh of one inch; wire traps, with an opening at each end, were 2½ feet in diameter and covered with one-inch-mesh, galvanized chicken wire.  GILL NETS.--Experimental gill nets were set on three occasions in"]]]
