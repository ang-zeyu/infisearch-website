Beginning with the rainforest, we find only one fossorial species, _Gymnopis mexicanus_. A large number of species are found on the forest floor; characteristic inhabitants of the leaf litter are: _Bufo valliceps_, _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Syrrhophus leprus_. Other terrestrial amphibians usually are not scattered throughout the rainforest, as are those named immediately above, but instead inhabit areas of forest adjacent to ponds or streams; these species include: _Bufo marinus_, _Eleutherodactylus natator_, _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_, _Leptodactylus labialis_, _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, _Rana palmipes_ and _Rana pipiens_. The most striking ecological assemblage of amphibians in the rainforest is the arboreal group of species, including:       _Bolitoglossa occidentalis_      _Bolitoglossa platydactyla_      _Eleutherodactylus alfredi_      _Hyla baudini_      _Hyla ebraccata_      _Hyla loquax_      _Hyla microcephala martini_      _Hyla picta_      _Phrynohyas modesta_      _Phrynohyas spilomma_      _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_  In the savannas _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_, _Engystomops pustulosus_, and _Gastrophryne usta_ are fossorial species. _Bufo marinus_, _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, _Leptodactylus labialis_, _Rana palmipes_, and _Rana pipiens_ are found in the vicinity of permanent water in the savannas. Although the savanna habitat does not provide the ecological conditions for the existence of an arboreal fauna, many arboreal species from the surrounding rainforest utilize the extensive marshes and ponds in the savannas for breeding purposes. Thus, _Hyla baudini_, _Hyla microcephala martini_, _Hyla picta_, and _Phrynohyas spilomma_ have been found breeding in savannas. In parts of savannas where clumps of trees surround depressions containing water throughout the year, individuals of the species named above, together with _Hyla loquax_ and _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_, may not only breed, but remain throughout the year.  In the semi-arid scrub forest the same fossorial species as exist in the savannas are found. Likewise, _Bufo marinus_, _Leptodactylus labialis_, _Leptodactylus melanonotus_, and _Rana pipiens_ are found near permanent water. Terrestrial species in this semi-arid environment include _Bufo canaliferus_, _Bufo coccifer_, _Bufo marmoreus_, _Syrrhophus pipilans_, and _Diaglena reticulata_. Of these, _Syrrhophus pipilans_ sometimes inhabits low trees and bushes; the others may be fossorial. The arboreal species in the scrub forest include _Hyla baudini_, _Hyla robertmertensi_, _Hyla staufferi_, and _Phyllomedusa dacnicolor_.  _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ and _Hylella sumichrasti_ live along streams in the scrub forest. _Hylella sumichrasti_ lays its eggs in these streams.  In comparing the ecological differences in the amphibian assemblages in the three major habitats, the most obvious difference is the great percentage of arboreal species in the rainforest as compared with savanna and scrub forest. Only four arboreal species are found in the scrub forest, none in the savannas, but eleven in the rainforest. Likewise, there is an absence of ground-dwelling forms in the arid habitats; in the latter the only terrestrial species are those that are found near water. A possible exception is _Syrrhophus pipilans_.  From the above analysis of ecological distribution we may see that the rainforest provides a variety of habitats for amphibians and that these habitats are suitable for amphibian life throughout the year. On the other hand, the savannas and scrub forests are characterized by extreme conditions of desiccation, a factor of considerable importance in limiting the ecological distribution of amphibians. However, there still is a diversity of amphibians in these semi-arid environments. Obviously, these species are adapted in various ways for survival during the dry season, at which time environmental conditions are such that the animals cannot carry on their normal activities.  Although there is not an abundance of data concerning the seasonal activity of the fauna, what is available shows some interesting correlations with the environments. During the dry season in the scrub forest there is essentially no amphibian activity; an occasional _Rana pipiens_ may be seen along a river, or a _Bufo marinus_ may be seen at night. In the rainforest the terrestrial-breeding amphibians are active during the dry season. _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_ is found at night or by day along streams. _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Bufo valliceps_ are active during the day; these plus _Bolitoglossa occidentalis_, _Bolitoglossa platydactyla_, _Eleutherodactylus alfredi_, _Eleutherodactylus natator_, and an occasional _Hyla_ are active at night.  With the onset of the heavy summer rains and the subsequent formation of breeding ponds, amphibian activity reaches a peak. This is especially noticeable in the semi-arid environments, where during the dry season there is little activity.  Among the anurans in the isthmus the four species of _Eleutherodactylus_, the two species of _Syrrhophus_, and the one species of _Microbatrachylus_ are either known, or presumed, to lay eggs on the ground; these develop directly into small frogs. All of the other anurans deposit their eggs in water or attach them to objects over water (_Phyllomedusa_); these hatch into tadpoles, which later metamorphose into frogs. _Hylella sumichrasti_ is known to breed only in streams. All of the other species breed in ponds, but at times some species deposit their eggs in streams; in this last group are _Bufo valliceps_, _Bufo marmoreus_, _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_, and _Rana pipiens_.  Although the ecological data are incomplete, they do show that ecological conditions differ greatly in the three major environments, different species of amphibians inhabit these environments, and that the fauna is ecologically diversified in each environment.   _Distribution of the Fauna_  Plotting the distributions of species of amphibians known to live in the lowlands of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec results in an array of geographic patterns. These may be analyzed with respect to those species that are restricted either to the Gulf lowlands or the Pacific lowlands, or those that occur on both the Gulf and Pacific lowlands. Furthermore, the distributions may be analyzed with respect to those species whose ranges extend from México across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec into Central America, those that reach the isthmus from Central America but do not extend into México proper, and those that reach the isthmus from México but do not extend into Central America. It should be kept in mind that the following analysis is of the lowland inhabitants only. Species inhabiting the foothills and mountains will be discussed later.  1. SPECIES RESTRICTED TO THE GULF LOWLANDS. Of the 36 species of amphibians recorded from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, nine (25 per cent) are in this group. Four of these (_Eleutherodactylus alfredi_, _Syrrhophus leprus_, _Hyla loquax_, and _Hyla picta_) live in the Gulf lowlands to the east and to the west of the isthmus. Three others (_Hyla ebraccata_, _Hyla microcephala martini_ and _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_) are primarily Central American in their distribution and reach the northwestern limits of their ranges in the Gulf lowlands of the isthmus, whereas _Bolitoglossa platydactyla_ and _Eleutherodactylus natator_ reach the southern limits of their distributions in the isthmus.  2. SPECIES RESTRICTED TO THE PACIFIC LOWLANDS. This group includes six species, or 17 per cent of the amphibian fauna of the isthmus. Two of these (_Bufo coccifer_ and _Syrrhophus pipilans_) range to the east and to the west of the isthmus on the Pacific lowlands. Two others (_Bufo canaliferus_ and _Hyla robertmertensi_) range from the isthmus into Central America, and _Diaglena reticulata_ and _Phyllomedusa dacnicolor_ range on the Pacific lowlands of México southeastward to the isthmus.  3. SPECIES THAT OCCUR ON THE PACIFIC AND GULF LOWLANDS. This group includes 19 species, or 53 per cent of the total amphibian fauna. Of these, nine species (25 per cent of the entire amphibian fauna) are widespread throughout the lowlands of México and Central America; these are:       _Gymnopis mexicanus_      _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_      _Bufo marinus_      _Engystomops pustulosus_      _Leptodactylus labialis_      _Leptodactylus melanonotus_      _Hyla baudini_      _Hyla staufferi_      _Rana pipiens_  Four species occur on the Gulf lowlands to the east and to the west of the isthmus, but on the Pacific lowlands they occur only to the east; this group includes _Bufo valliceps_, _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_, _Phrynohyas modesta_, and _Phrynohyas spilomma_. Three species live to the east and to the west of the isthmus on the Pacific lowlands, but only to the west on the Gulf lowlands; these include _Eleutherodactylus rugulosus_, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, and _Gastrophryne usta_.  Six species that cross the isthmus live on the humid Gulf lowlands and on the humid lowlands of Chiapas and Guatemala, but not on the semi-arid Plains of Tehuantepec; these include _Bolitoglossa occidentalis_, _Eleutherodactylus rhodopis_, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_, _Phrynohyas modesta_, _Phrynohyas spilomma_, and _Rana palmipes_. Of these, _Microbatrachylus pygmaeus_ also occurs in scattered humid environments to the west of the isthmus on the Pacific lowlands.  Two species are endemic to the isthmian region. _Bolitoglossa veracrucis_ is known only from the humid northern slopes of the isthmus. _Hylella sumichrasti_ occurs on the Pacific slopes of the isthmus and extends to the east into western Chiapas.  In analyzing the distribution of the amphibians with respect to those that are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38440"],["title","A Distributional Study of the Amphibians of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, México (#6)"],["body","to either the Pacific or Gulf lowlands or those that cross the continental divide in the isthmus, we find that 25 per cent of the species are restricted to the Gulf lowlands, 17 per cent are restricted to the Pacific lowlands, and 53 per cent cross the isthmus. In analyzing the distribution patterns with respect to those that extend across the isthmus of Tehuantepec from east to west, we find that 14 per cent of the species do not extend east of the isthmus into Central America and that 19 per cent do not range west of the isthmus into México proper; 61 per cent of the species range to the east and to the west of the isthmus. Of the 36 species of amphibians inhabiting the isthmus only nine species (25 per cent) range across the isthmus, that is, occur on the Gulf and Pacific lowlands, and also range to the east and to the west of the isthmus. To these wide-ranging species the diversified environments of the isthmus do not present a barrier to distribution. The other 27 species (75 per cent) either do not cross the isthmus from east to west or from north to south; thus, probably in one way or another the isthmus presents a barrier to their distribution.     THE AMPHIBIAN FAUNA OF THE FOOTHILLS AND ADJACENT HIGHLANDS   To amphibians inhabiting the foothills and mountains of southern México and northern Central America, the isthmus presents a great barrier to dispersal. For example, salamanders of the genus _Thorius_, the _mexicanus_ and _augusti_ groups of the genus _Eleutherodactylus_, the _bistincta_ group of the genus _Hyla_, and the genus _Tomodactylus_ occur on the Mexican Plateau and southward into the mountains of Oaxaca. Nevertheless, no members of these groups are present in the Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands. The genera _Chiropterotriton_, _Magnadigita_, _Pseudoeurycea_, and _Ptychohyla_, as well as the _eximia_ group of _Hyla_ are represented by different species in the Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands than in the mountains of México on the other side of the isthmus. Several species of _Plectrohyla_ occur in the Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands, but none is known from the Mexican Highlands, although one species occurs in the Tuxtlas.  Living in the humid forests of the foothills are salamanders of the genus _Lineatriton_, frogs of the _spatulatus_ group of _Eleutherodactylus_, _Anotheca coronata_, _Hyla miotympanum_, and _Phyllomedusa moreleti_. All of these occur in the foothills of the Sierra Madre Oriental in eastern México and in Los Tuxtlas. _Lineatriton_, _Hyla miotympanum_, and the _spatulatus_ group of _Eleutherodactylus_ do not occur in the foothills of the Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands; those amphibians reach the end of their ranges at the isthmus. _Phyllomedusa moreleti_ and _Anotheca coronata_ are found in the northern foothills of the Guatemalan-Chiapan Highlands, and _Phyllomedusa moreleti_ is found in the foothills on the Pacific slopes of the Chiapan Highlands.  Although the above analysis is not so detailed as that of the lowland inhabitants, it does show that all of the genera and species of amphibians known to inhabit the foothills and highlands adjacent to the isthmus, only two species of amphibians cross the isthmus from one highland mass to the other. Thus, it is evident that the Isthmus of Tehuantepec presents a great barrier to dispersal of these groups of amphibians.     ESTABLISHMENT OF PRESENT PATTERNS OF DISTRIBUTION   From the foregoing analysis of geographical and ecological distribution in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec we may strive for an interpretation of the events that led to the establishment of patterns of distribution displayed not only by the amphibians, but other terrestrial vertebrates as well. The thesis that I am proposing below is based on the premise that in southern México and northern Central America climatic fluctuation during the Pleistocene was of sufficient magnitude to cause vegetational shifts, both vertically and latitudinally, resulting in the establishment of alternating continuous and discontinuous lowland and highland environments, although this climatic fluctuation was not so great as to eliminate tropical lowland environments from the region. I feel that the present patterns of distribution of the amphibians in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec may be explained on this premise.  Many authors dealing with the herpetofauna of Middle America have followed Schuchert's (1935) suggestion of a seaway in the isthmus during the Cenozoic. Thus, Burt (1931), Duellman (1956, 1958a), Gloyd (1940), Oliver (1948), Smith and Laufe (1946), and Stuart (1941) employed the presence of a seaway to explain distribution and speciation in various genera. Durham, Arellano, and Peck (1952), Olson and McGrew (1941), and Stirton (1954) have provided geological evidence that there probably was no Cenozoic seaway in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Even if there were a seaway in the Pliocene or Miocene (the dating of this possible seaway is open to question), its presence is not necessary to explain the present patterns of distribution in the isthmus.  In recent years the study of natural biotic environments, palynology, and Pleistocene chronology in Middle America has produced a wealth of data, which although still fragmentary begins to form a picture of past climatic events in that part of the world. Sedimentary studies by Hutchinson, Patrick, and Deevey (1956) and Sears, Foreman, and Clisby (1955) have provided evidence of drastic climatic shifts in México during the Pleistocene. Further evidence of bioclimatic fluctuation is provided by Martin and Harrell (1957) and Martin (1958); the latter has suggested that there was a displacement of the tropical zones in southern México and northern Central America by as much as 3000 feet during the glacial maximum. Much of the evidence of such drastic vertical shifts in environments is based on the presence of Pleistocene montane glaciers on Mexican volcanoes (White, 1956) and Chirripo in Costa Rica (Weyl, 1955). Dorf (1959) supports this idea of drastic climatic change.  In his studies of the avifauna of México and Guatemala Griscom (1932 and 1950) made an important issue of the continuity of the bird fauna in what he called the Subtropical Life-zone, which essentially consists of cloud forest, a widespread, but discontinuous, habitat on the Gulf (windward) slopes of the Mexican and Central American highlands at elevations between 1000 and 2000 meters. To account for this apparent uniformity in the avifauna Griscom hypothesized a continuity of cloud forest environment in the Pleistocene; this would result in the depression of cloud forests to the coastal lowlands and the displacement of tropical lowland environments far to the south in Central America. Stuart (1951) objected to this displacement of lowland tropical rainforest; he stated that a descent to sea level of a subtropical zone would have brought about either widespread extermination of the tropical fauna or acclimatization of that fauna to subtropical conditions.  Although palynological studies and some faunal studies of subtropical and temperate animals suggest a drastic climatic fluctuation that might have eliminated tropical environments in southern México and northern Central America, there is much biological evidence indicating the existence of tropical environments in this region even during the glacial maximum. Especially significant is the diversity of species inhabiting the present tropical environments; many of these have differentiated from related taxa to the south.  In the Pleistocene, climate fluctuated and vegetation shifted correspondingly in southern México and northern Central America. Most of the palynological studies and many studies of Pleistocene chronology deal with montane regions, either the Mexican Plateau or the mountains rising from the plateau. No such studies have been made in lowland tropical environments. During glacial advances the tropical lowland environments in México probably were not eliminated, for the great diversity of animals in these environments supports the hypothesis that they have been in existence for some time, although periodically they may have been discontinuous.  In order to understand the nature of bioclimatological events in the Pleistocene in lowland tropical environments of southern México, certain factors that are of little importance in the interpretation of Pleistocene chronology in the highlands must be considered. These factors are: 1) climatic moderation by oceans, 2) fluctuation in sea level, and 3) fluctuation in level of the water table as affected by sea level.  It is well-known that large bodies of water moderate the temperature on adjacent land. Furthermore, it is known that faunas of marine invertebrates shifted latitudinally in the Pleistocene; Trask, Phleger, and Stetson (1947) recorded cold-water Foraminifera then as far south as the Sigsbee Deep in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico. Large bodies of warm water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Pacific Ocean of today, probably were not sufficiently cooled at the time of glacial advance to affect greatly the temperature of the winds blowing across them. Even if these bodies of water were somewhat cooler than now, the prevailing winds blowing from them onto the lowlands of México and northern Central America would have aided in maintaining relatively high temperatures there. These warm winds probably counteracted the cooling effect of glaciation in the lowlands and thereby maintained tropical conditions near the seas.  Although no adequate studies of Pleistocene beach lines have been made in southern México, such information is available for peninsular Florida on the other side of the Gulf of Mexico (Cooke, 1945). Fluctuation in sea level in the Pleistocene has been used by Hubbell (1954), Goin (1958), and Duellman and Schwartz (1958) to explain present patterns of distribution of animals in Florida. If Cooke's interpretations can be applied to the"]]]
