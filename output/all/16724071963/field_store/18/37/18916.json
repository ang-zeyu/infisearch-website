Ralph and Rory had kept the promise they had made to each other on the morning succeeding their arrival at Arrandoon; they left McBain to dream over his \"idea\" in peace.  They did not behave like squaws, and I think it was the third or fourth evening before Allan's foster-father said another word about it.  They were then all around the fire, as they had been before; the ladies had retired, and the dogs were making themselves as snug and comfortable as dogs know how to whenever they get a chance.  \"Well,\" said McBain, after there had been a lull in the conversation for some little time, \"we've been all so happy and jolly here for the last few days, that we haven't had time to think much or to look ahead either; but now, if you don't mind, young gentlemen, I will tell you what I should propose in the way of spending a few of the incoming spring and summer months, in what I should call a very pleasant fashion.\"  \"Yes,\" cried Rory, \"do tell us, we are burning to hear about it, and if it be anything new it is sure to be nice.\"  \"Very well,\" said McBain.  \"Allan there tells me he means to stick to you both for a time--to keep you prisoners in Glentroom.  He will trot you about for all that; you'll be on parole, and roam about wherever you like; and you can fish and shoot and sketch just as much as ever you have a mind to.  Meanwhile, buy a boat; I know where there is one to sell that will suit us in every way--a grand, big, strong, open boat. She belongs to Duncan Forbes, of Fort Augustus, and can be bought for an old song.  We can have her round into the loch here.  I'm a bit of a sailor, as Allan knows, and I'll show you how to deck her over, set up rigging and mast, and make her complete, and I'll make bold to say that before we have done with her she will be as neat and pretty a little craft as ever hauled the wind.\"  \"I say, boys,\" said Rory, \"I think the idea is a glorious one.\"  \"I must say, I like it immensely,\" said Ralph.  \"And so do I,\" said Allan, \"if--if we can all afford it.\"  \"Oh! but stop a little,\" said McBain, \"you haven't heard all my proposal yet; the best of it is to come.  Your cruising ground will be all up and down among the Western Islands, where the wildest and finest scenery in Europe exists.  You'll get any amount of fishing and shooting too, for wherever you three smart-looking young yachtsmen land on the coast, people will vie with each other in offering you Highland hospitality. And all the while you can make your pleasure pay you.\"  \"How--how--tell us how?\"  \"Why,\" continued McBain, \"around the rocky and rugged islands where you will be cruising are the finest lobsters in the world.  You have only to sink a few cages every night when at anchor; you will draw them up full in the morning, and place them in a well in your hold.  As soon as you have enough to make a paying voyage, round you will run to Greenock, where is always a ready market and good prices.\"  Here Ralph jumped up and rubbed his hands; and Rory, forgetting his bruised shoulder and still bandaged head, hopped off the sofa to cry \"Hurrah!\" and this made Kooran bark, and of course Bran chimed in for company's sake, and McBain wagged his beard and laughed with delight at the pleasure his suggestion seemed to afford the three young men; and, indeed, for the time being he felt quite as youthful as either of them.  \"And I'll be the crew of the craft,\" said McBain.  \"Allan ought to be captain, and you others naval cadets.\"  \"Yes,\" said Rory, \"that will suit us excellently, and we can take lessons from you and Allan in seamanship, and by-and-bye be just as clever sailors as either of you.\"  \"Ay, that you can,\" said McBain.  Allan laid his hand on Ralph's shoulder, for the latter was gazing quietly and dreamily firewards.  \"What are you thinking about?\" said Allan.  Ralph smiled as he made reply.  \"I was thinking,\" he said, \"that our adventures as amateur yachtsmen will not begin and end with cruising among the Western Isles of Scotland, pleasant and romantic enough though that may be.  Listen to me, boys.  It has been the one dream of my life to be able to be master of a beautiful yacht, and to sail away to far countries, and to see the world in earnest.  Now I know I shall have an opportunity of doing so. My good, kind old father will baulk me in nothing that is reasonable; and if, after a few months' cruising in this boat, I can convince him that I have mastered the rudiments of seamanship, he will, I believe, let me have a real yacht, capable of voyaging to any part of the world!\"  \"Ah! that would indeed be glorious, boys,\" cried Rory, with enthusiasm.  \"If we could only arrange it,\" said Allan, \"so as to all go together.\"  \"Of course,\" said Ralph; \"there would not be half the pleasure else. And we would sail to some country, if possible, where Englishmen had never been, or never lived before.\"  \"To the countries and islands around the Pole, for example,\" suggested McBain.  \"Yes,\" Ralph said; \"from all I have read of the Sea of Ice, it seems to me the most fascinating place in the world.\"  \"Ay,\" said McBain; \"to me it possesses a strange charm; for everything connected with the countries and seas beyond the Arctic circle is as different from anything one sees elsewhere as though it belonged to some other planet.\"  For hours before retiring to rest they talked about Greenland; and McBain told them of many a wild adventure in which he himself had been the principal hero.  And among other things he told them of the mammoth caves of Alba Isle, where an untold wealth of ivory lay buried.  For hours _after_ they had retired Allan lay awake, thinking only of that buried treasure.  Then he slept, and dreamt he had returned from the far north a wealthy man--that Arrandoon was re-furnished and re-roofed, that he had regained all the proud acres which his fathers had squandered, and that his dear mother and sister were reinstated in the rank of life they were born to adorn, and which was the right of birth of the chiefs of Glentroom.  Do dreams ever come true?  At times.  CHAPTER FOUR.  THE \"FLOWER OF ARRANDOON\"--OLD AP'S COTTAGE--TRIAL TRIPS AND USEFUL LESSONS.  I do not think that, during any period of his former life, Allan McGregor's foster-father was much happier than he was while engaged, with the help of his boy friends, in getting the cutter they had bought ready for her summer cruise among the Western Islands.  They were not quite unassisted in their labours though; no, for had they not the advantage of possessing skilled labour?  Was not Tom Ap Ewen their right-hand man; to guide, direct, and counsel them in every difficulty?  And right useful they found him, too.  Thomas was a Welshman, as his name indicates; he had been a boatbuilder all his life.  He lived in a little house by the lake-side, and this house of his bore in every respect a very strong resemblance to a boat turned upside down.  All its furniture and fittings looked as though at one time they had been down to the sea in ships, and very likely they had.  Tom's bed was a canvas cot which might have been white at one time, but which was terribly smoke-begrimed now; Tom's cooking apparatus was a stove, and, saving a sea-chest which served the double purpose of dais and tool-box, all the seats in his cottage were lockers, while the old lamp that hung from the blackened rafters gave evidence of having seen better days, having in fact dangled from the cabin deck of some trusty yacht.  Tom himself was quite in keeping with his little home.  A man of small stature was Tom.  I will not call him dapper, because you know that would imply neatness and activity, and there was very little of either about Tom.  But he had plenty of breadth of beam, and so stiff was he, apparently, that he looked as if he had been made out of an old bowsprit, and had acted for years in the capacity of figure-head to an old seventy-four.  Seen from the front, Tom appeared, on week-days, to be all apron from his chin to his toes; his hard wiry face was bestubbled over in half its length with grey hairs, for Tom found the scissors more handy and far less dangerous than a razor; and, jauntily cocked a little on one side of his head, he wore a square paper cap over a reddish-brown wig.  Well, if to this you add a pair of short arms, a pair of hard horny hands, and place two roguish beads of hazel eyes in under his bushy eyebrows, you have just as complete a description of Thomas Ap Ewen as I am capable of giving.  This wee wee man generally went by the name of Old Ap.  Of course there were ill-natured people who sometimes, behind Tom's back, added an _e_ to the _Ap_; but, honestly speaking, there was not a bit of the ape about him, except, perhaps, when taking snuff.  Granting that his partiality for snuff was a fault, it was one that you could reasonably strive to forgive, in consideration of his many other sterling qualities.  Well, Tom was master of the yard, so to speak, into which the purchased cutter was hauled to be fitted, and although McBain did not take _all_ the advice that was tendered to him, it is but fair to say that he benefited by a good deal of it.  It would have done the heart of any one, save a churl, good to have seen how willingly those boys worked; axe, or saw, or hammer, plane or spokeshave, nothing came amiss to them.  Allan was undoubtedly the best artisan; he had been used to such work before; but generally where there's a will there's a way, and the very newness of the idea of labouring like ordinary mechanics lent, as far as Ralph and Rory were concerned, a charm to the whole business.  \"There is nothing hackneyed about this sort of thing, is there?\"  Ralph would say, looking up from planing a deck-spar.  \"There is a deal to learn, too,\" Rory might answer.  \"Artisans mustn't be fools, sure.  But how stiff my saw goes!\"  \"A bit of grease will put that to rights.\"  Ralph's face would beam while giving a bit of information like this, or while initiating Rory into the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38276"],["title","The Cruise of the Snowbird: A Story of Arctic Adventure (#6)"],["body","of dovetailing, or explaining to him that when driving a nail he must hit it quietly on the head, and then it would not go doubling round his finger.  Old Ap and McBain were both of them very learned--or they appeared to be so--in the subject of rigging, nor did their opinions in this matter altogether coincide.  Old Ap's cottage and the yard were quite two miles--Scotch ones--from the castle, so on the days when they were busy our heroes would not hear of returning to lunch.  \"Isn't good bread and cheese, washed down with goat's milk, sufficient for us?\"  Ralph might say.  And Rory would reply, \"Yes, my boy, indeed, it's food fit for a king.\"  After luncheon was the time for a little well-earned rest.  The young men would stroll down towards the lake, by whose banks there was always something to be seen or done for half-an-hour, if it were only skipping flat stones across its surface; while the two elder ones would enjoy the _dolce far niente_ and their _odium cum dignitate_ seated on a log.  \"Well,\" said old Ap, one day, \"I suppose she is to be cutter-rigged, though for my own part I'd prefer a yawl.\"  \"There is no accounting for tastes,\" replied McBain; \"and as to me, I don't care for two masts where one will do.  She won't be over large, you know, when all is said and done.\"  \"Just look you,\" continued Ap, \"how handy a bit of mizen is.\"  \"It is at times, I grant you,\" replied McBain.  \"To be sure,\" said Ap, \"you may sail faster with the cutter rig, but then you don't want to race, do you, look see?\"  \"Not positively to race, Mr Ewen,\" replied McBain, \"but there will be times when it may be necessary to get into harbour or up a loch with all speed, and if that isn't racing, why it's the very next thing to it.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" said old Ap, \"but still a yawl is easier worked, and as you'll be a bit short-handed--\"  \"What!\" cried McBain, in some astonishment; \"an eight-ton cutter, and four of us.  Call you that short-handed?\"  \"Yes, yes, I do, look see,\" answered Ap, taking a big pinch of his favourite dust, \"because I'd call it only two; surely you wouldn't count upon the Englishmen in a sea-way.\"  McBain laughed.  \"Why,\" he said, \"before a month is over I'll have those two Saxon lads as clever cuttersmen as ever handled tiller or belayed a halyard.  Just wait until we return up the loch after our summer's cruise, and you can criticise us as much as ever you please.\"  Now these amateur yacht-builders, if so we may call them, took the greatest of pains, not only with the decking and rigging of their cutter, but with her painting and ornamentation as well.  There were two or three months before them, because they did not mean to start cruising before May, so they worked away at her with the plodding steadiness of five old beavers.  In their little cabin, where it must be confessed there was not too much head room, there was nevertheless a good deal of comfort, and all the painting and gilding was done by Rory's five artistic fingers.  In fact, he painted her outside and in, and he named her the _Flower of Arrandoon_, and he painted that too on her stern, with a great many dashes and flourishes, that any one, save himself, would have deemed quite unnecessary.  It was only natural that they should do their best to make their pigmy vessel look as neat and as nice as possible; but they had another object in view in doing so, for as soon as their summer cruise was over they meant to sell her.  So that what they spent upon her would not really be money thrown to the winds, but quite the reverse.  Young Ralph knew dozens of young men just as fond of sailing and adventure as he was, and he thought it would be strange indeed if he himself, assisted by the voluble Rory, could not manage to give such a glowing account of their cruise, and of all the fun and adventures they were sure to have, as would make the purchase of the _Flower of Arrandoon_ something to be positively competed for.  When she was at last finished and fitted, and lying at anchor, in the creek of Glentroom, with the water lap-lapping under her bows, her sails all nicely clewed, and her slender topmast bobbing and bending to the trees, as if saluting them, why I can assure you she looked very pretty indeed.  But there was something more than mere prettiness about her; she looked useful.  Care had been taken with her ballasting, so she rode like a duck in the water.  She had, too, sufficient breadth of beam, and yet possessed depth of keel enough to make her safe in a sea-way, and McBain knew well--and so, for that matter, did Allan--that these were solid advantages in the kind of waters that would form their cruising ground.  In a word, the _Flower of Arrandoon_ was a comfortable sea-worthy boat, well proportioned and handy, and what more could any one wish for?  And now the snow had all fled from the hills and the glens, only on the crevices of mountain tops was it still to be seen--ay, and would be likely to be seen all the summer through, but softly and balmily blew the western winds, and the mavis and blackbird returned to make joyous music from morning's dawn till dewy eve.  Half hidden in bushy dells, canary-coloured primroses smiled over the green of their leaves, and ferns and breckans began to unfold their brown fingers in the breeze, while buds on the silvery-scented birches that grew on the brae-lands, and verdant crimson-tipped tassels on the larches that courted the haughs, told that spring had come, and summer itself was not far distant.  And so one fine morning says McBain, \"Now, Allan, if your friends are ready, we'll go down to the creek, get up our bit of an anchor, and be off on a trial trip.\"  Trial trips are often failures, but that of the boys' cutter certainly was not.  Everything was done under McBain's directions, Allan doing nearly all the principal work, though assisted by old Ap; but if Ralph and Rory did not work, they watched.  Nothing escaped them, and if they did not say much, it was because, like Paddy's parrot, they were \"rattling up the thinking.\"  The day was beautiful--a blue sky with drifting cloudlets of white overhead, and a good though not stiff breeze blowing right up the loch; so they took advantage of this, and scudded on for ten miles to Glen Mora.  They did not run right up against the old black pier, and smash their own bowsprit in the attempt to knock it down.  No, the boat was well steered, and the sails lowered just at the right time, the mainsail neatly and smartly furled, and covered as neatly, and the jib stowed. Old Ap was left as watchman, and McBain and his friends went on shore for a walk and luncheon.  In the evening, after they had enjoyed to the full their \"bit of a cruise on shore,\" as McBain called it, they returned to their boat, and almost immediately started back for Glentroom.  The wind still blew up the loch; it was almost, though not quite, ahead of them.  This our young yachtsmen did not regret, for, as their sailing-master told them, it would enable them to find out what the cutter could do, for, tacking and half-tacking, they had to work to windward.  It was gloaming ere they dropped anchor again in the creek, and McBain's verdict on the _Flower of Arrandoon_ was a perfectly satisfactory one.  \"She'll do, gentlemen,\" he said, \"she'll do; she is handy, and stout, and willing.  There is no extra sauciness about her, though she is on excellent terms with herself, and although she doesn't sail _impudently_ close to the wind, still I say she behaves herself gallantly and well.\"  It wanted nothing more than this to give Allan and his friends an appetite for the haunch of mountain mutton that awaited them on their return to the castle.  They were in bounding spirits too; it made every one else happy just to see them happy, so that everything passed off that night as merrily as marriage bells.  The loch near the old Castle of Arrandoon is one of the great chain of lakes that stretch from east to west of Scotland, and are joined together by a broad and deep canal, which gives passage to many a stately ship.  This canal, once upon a time, was looked upon as one of the engineering wonders of the world, leading as it does often up and over hills so high and wild that in sober England they would be honoured with the title of mountains.  For a whole week or more, ere the cutter turned her bows to the southward and west, and started away on her summer cruise, almost every day was spent on this loch.  It is big enough in all conscience for manoeuvres of any kind, being in many places betwixt two and three miles in width, while its length is over twenty.  It might be said, with a good deal of truth, that Allan McGregor had spent his life in boats upon lakes, for as soon as his little hand was big enough to grasp a tiller he had held one.  He knew all about boats and boat-sailing, and was, on the whole, an excellent fresh-water sailor.  With Ralph and Rory it was somewhat different, good oarsman though the former at all events was.  However, they were apt pupils, and, with good health and willingness to work, what is it a boy will not learn?  In old Ap's cottage were models of several well-rigged vessels of the smaller class, the principal of them being a sloop, a cutter, and a yawl.  Ap delighted to give lectures on the peculiar merits and rigging of these, interspersed with many a \"Yes, yes, young shentlemen, and look you see,\" spoken with the curious accent which Welshmen alone can give to such simple words.  These models our heroes used to copy, so that, theoretically speaking, they knew a great deal about seamanship before they stepped on board the cutter to take their first cruise.  Practice alone makes perfect in any profession, and although experience is oftentimes a hard and cruel teacher, there is no doubt she _docet stultos_, and her lessons are given with a force there is no forgetting. Of such was the lesson Rory got one morning; he had the tiller in his hand, and was bowling"]]]
