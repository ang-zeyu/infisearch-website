As you ask me for my opinion, I openly confess that in the main Bronsart appears to me perfectly justified in vindicating his choice of new compositions for the musical directors, in spite of the fact that the two or three experiments he has made do not show in favor of the principle (as seen by the consequences). But between ourselves we must not conceal the fact that a great part of the laxity and corruption of our musical condition in Germany (as also elsewhere) is to be attributed to the too great--or too petty--yielding and pliancy of conductors and music-directors. I well know that the Euterpe Committee nourishes and cherishes quite another idea than that of the company X. Y. Z., or of the Court Theater directors A. B. C. D. Yet the question constantly arises--Shall the cook cook? Shall the coachman drive?--Ergo let the musician also have his own way. The harm that may spring from that is not so very terrible.  On the other side, I consider a change of persons in the management of a new institution is not desirable. In intellectual movements in particular the leaders of them are especially recommended to keep themselves conservative as regards their people. The public requires definiteness before all else--and just this is endangered by a change of persons. The substitute for B., whom you mention to me (his name also begins with B.), is certainly highly to be recommended in all that concerns talent, position, and I think also worthy character; none the less do I vote very decidedly that Bronsart be retained--if possible.  I do not need to add, dear friend, that this opinion of mine is a purely objective one. I have not heard a word from Bronsart since last September, and, as I said to you before, my musical news from Germany is limited to two, or at most three letters which Gottschalg wrote me.  With the wish that all difficulties may be smoothed in the best way by your intelligent gentleness and forbearance, I remain your warmly devoted  F. Liszt  [Rome] April 12th, 1862  P.S.--More next time (though little of interest to you, as absolutely nothing occurs here that could touch you closely).--I am preparing to stay here for the summer, and somewhat longer.-- In order not to lose the post I only send you today these few lines.    4. To Madame Jessie Laussot in Florence  [Madame Laussot, an English lady, became later the wife of Dr. Carl Hillebrand, the celebrated writer. She was the intimate friend of Liszt, Von Bulow, etc., and is herself a musician of great repute, to whom many artists of note, Sgambati, Bache, Buonamici, etc., owe much of the success of their career. She started a musical society in Florence, the \"Societa Cherubini;\" which she conducted for many years, and introduced there much of the best music of Germany (Liszt's included).]  Your charming lines, Madame, reached me at the beginning of Holy Week. At that moment one no longer belongs to oneself in Rome; and I have felt this more than others, for the services and ceremonies of the Sistine Chapel and of St. Peter's, to which I attached a special musical interest, have absorbed all my time during the last fortnight. Pray excuse me therefore for not having thanked you sooner for your kind remembrance, which touches me much.  Some one has made a mistake in telling you that I am coming to Florence. I have no longer any taste for moving about from one place to another, and, unless something very unforeseen happens, I shall not stir from here so soon. Rome is a more convenient place than others for those who ask nothing better than to work in their own fashion. Now, although I have become very indifferent as to the fate of what I write, work none the less continues to be the first need of my nature. I write therefore simply to write--without any other pretensions or care--and for this it suits me best to remain in one place.  Will you be so kind, Madame, as to give my very affectionate respects to Madame Ritter [Mother of Carl Ritter--Wagner's friend--and of Alexander Ritter, the composer of \"Der faule Hans.\"], to which please add my best remembrances to her family, and pray accept also the expression of my very sincere and affectionate regards.  F. Liszt  May 3rd, 1862 (Via Felice, 113--Rome.)    5. To Dr. Franz Brendel  Rome, June 12th, 1862  Grand, sublime, immeasurably great things have come to pass here lately. The Episcopate of the whole world assembled here round the Holy Father, who performed the ceremony of the canonisation of the Japanese martyrs at Whitsuntide in the presence of more than 300 bishops, archbishops, patriarchs, and cardinals. I must abstain, dear friend, from giving you any picture of the overpowering moment in which the Pope intoned the \"Te Deum;\" for in Protestant lands that which I might call the spiritual illumination is wanting. Let us therefore, without any other transition, return to our everyday musical matters!  I am convinced that your determination to make a change in the choice of conductors of the Euterpe has been made only after mature consideration. .--. In my last letter I pointed out, as the chief thing, that in concert societies the principle of stability in the matter of the Musical Direction is the most important thing, whereby I did not in the least mean to say that one must on that account agree to extreme consequences--or rather inconsequences. Well, as your decision is made, any further discussion is useless. Blassmann [He moved to Dresden some years later, and there he died.] has now to approve himself, and actively to fulfil the favorable expectations which his talent and good name justify. So be it, and as Schuberth says, Punktum [a full stop.]  As regards the place of meeting for the next Tonkunstler- Versammlung I am quite of your opinion. First of all I advise you to consult Bulow. Owing to his long connection with the Court at Carlsruhe he is best qualified to take the preliminary measures (\"to pave the way\"!). If the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess take up the matter favorably, then without doubt all that is requisite and necessary will be done in the most desirable manner. The most essential things are  (a) Letting us have the theater free of charge for two to three evenings--(as at Weimar--would not it perhaps be best to mention this in the 1st letter?).  (b) Official preparatory measures by the Intendant to ensure the co-operation of the Carlsruhe orchestra and chorus, also free of charge.  You will have to consult more fully with Dr. Devrient and Kalliwoda as to the best time for it. But the thing to be done before all else is to gain the Grand Duke's interest--and if you think it would be practicable for me to write a few lines to H.R.H. later on I will do so with pleasure. I only beg that you will give me exact particulars of the steps already made and their results.  For my part I think that to Bulow, a priori, ought to be entrusted the conducting of the Musical Festival, and this point should be at once mentioned as settled in the introductory letter to the Grand Duke. Otherwise Bedow's position in the affair would not be sufficiently supported.  To sum up briefly: Request Bulow to undertake the conductorship of the Musical Festival; and address the Grand Duke of Baden, either by letter or by word of mouth (as opportunity may warrant), with the request that H.R.H. would graciously support the proposed Musical Festival of the third Tonkunstler- Versammlung, by giving it his patronage, as the Grand Duke of Weimar did last year, etc., etc.  .--. That excellent Pohl has quite forgotten me. I asked him, through Gottschalg, to send me my Gesam- melte Lieder [complete songs], the \"Dante Symphony\" (in score and arrangement for 2 Pianos), the 4-hand Symphonic Poems, and a couple of copies of my Catalogue (published by Hartel).  I have been waiting in vain for these for two months. A few days ago I wrote to Frau von Bulow to send Pohl an execution; perhaps this may help matters at length!  The Berlioz parts have remained at Weimar. Grosse knows about them--and possibly they have also gone to Pohl with the rest of the scores. As soon as they are found I shall be happy to make a present of them to the library of the Musikverein for their use, as well as the scores, and I authorise you with pleasure, dear friend, to do the same with the score and parts of the \"Gran Mass.\"  The newspaper has not reached me from Pohl any more than the parcel.  Hearty greetings to your wife from yours in all friendship,  F. L.    6. To Dr. Franz Brendel  Dear Friend,  Well, as the parcel has come at last, Pohl shall not be scolded any more, and his \"innocence\" shall shine out in full splendor! .--.  I have just received a few lines from Berlioz; Schuberth, whom I commissioned, before I left, to send the dedication-copy of the \"Faust\" score to Berlioz, has again in his incompetent good nature forgotten it, and perhaps even from motives of economy has not had the dedication-plate engraved at all!!--Forgive me, dear friend, if I trouble you once more with this affair, and beg you to put an execution on Schuberth in order to force a copy with the dedication-page from him. The dedication shall be just as simple as that of the \"Dante Symphony,\" containing only the name of the dedicatee, as follows,  \"To Hector Berlioz.\"  After this indispensable matter has been arranged I beg that you will be so kind as to have a tasteful copy, bound in red or dark green, sent, perhaps through Pohl (?), to Berlioz at Baden (where he will be at the beginning of August. In case neither Pohl nor his wife should go to Baden this summer (which however I scarcely expect will be the case), send the copy to Fraulein Genast (who, as I learn from the \"Zeitschrift\" [periodical], is at present in Carlsruhe) with the request that she will give it to Berlioz.  Is there not any talk of bringing out an arrangement of the \"Faust Symphony\" for 2 Pianofortes?--Schuberth is sure to have far greater things in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3750"],["title","Letters of Franz Liszt -- Volume 2 (#4)"],["body","on, and I almost regret having incommoded him by giving up the manuscripts!--  Nonetheless, please take him to task about it, or, better, bully him into action with \"Faust-Recht\" [Faust rights or Faust justice.] In truth the final chorus of Part III. of the Faust tragedy, \"faithful to the spirit of Part II. as composed by Deutobold-Symbolizetti-Allegoriowitsch-Mystifizinsky\"--  \"Das Abgeschmackteste Hier ward es geschmeckt, Das Allvertrackteste Hier war es bezweckt\"  [A parody on the concluding lines of Goethe's Faust. The parody may be freely translated as follows:--  The most insipid Here was tasted; In queerest nonsense Here all was wasted.\"]  can often be applied to matters of publishing. And while I am touching on this, to me, very disagreeable chapter, may I also take the opportunity of inquiring how long our amiable friend and patron Julius Schuberth is intending to ignore the 2 Episodes from Lenau's \"Faust\" (\"Nachtlicher Zug\"--and \"Mephisto Walzer\"), which I recommended to his good graces more than a year ago, and gave him in manuscript?  Must the pages perchance become quite mouldy, or will he bring them out as an oeuvre posthume [posthumous work]? I am tired of doing silent homage to this noble mode of proceedings, and intend next time to help the publisher out of all his perplexities [Untranslatable pun on \"Verleger\" and \"Verlegenheiten.\"] by putting the manuscripts back in their place again.--  --  \"O Freunde, nicht diese Tone, sondern lasst uns angenchmere anstimmen!\" [A quotation from Schiller's \"Ode to joy\" in Beethoven's \"Choral Symphony:\" \"O friends, not tones like these, but brighter ones let us sing.\"] (I am perhaps not quoting exactly, although the sense of the apostrophe remains clearly present, especially in musical enjoyments and experiences!) Amongst the \"more pleasant\" things I at once place much information given in your letter and the newspaper (which reached me at the same time in some 16 numbers with Pohl's parcel). My most earnest wishes are, first and foremost, bound up in the complete prospering, upspringing, and blossoming of the \"grain of mustard-seed\" of our Allgemeine Deutsche Musik-Verein. With God's help I will also support this in other fashion than mere \"wishes.\" According to my opinion the third Tonkunstler- Versammlung will be the chief factor in strengthening and extending the Allgemeine Deutsche Musik-Verein, which comprises in itself the entire development and advancement of Art.  Various reasons led me to recommend Carlsruhe to you in my last letter as the most suitable place for the third Tonkunstler- Versammlung, that is, supposing that H.R.H. the Grand Duke gives his countenance to the matter, and grants us favorable conditions with regard to the disposal of the theater, orchestra, and chorus. It behoves Bulow, as conductor of the musical performances, to undertake to \"pave the way\" towards a favorable promise on the Grand Duke's side. Within two to three months the necessary preliminaries can be fixed, and I shall then expect fuller tidings from you about the further plans and measures.  Without wishing to make any valid objection to Prague--rather with all due acknowledgment of what Prague has already accomplished and may still accomplish--yet it seems to me that the present political relations of the Austrian monarchy would make it inopportune to hold the Tonkunstler-Versammlung in Prague just now. On the other hand I am of opinion that a more direct influence than has yet been possible on South Germany, which is for the most part in a stagnating condition, would be of service. Stuttgart in particular, through Pruckner, Singer, Stark, etc., might behave at it differently from what it did at a previous Musical Festival in Carlsruhe!  Dr. Gille's interest in the statutes and deliberations of the M.V. [Musik-Verein] is very advantageous, as also Pohl's previous removal to Leipzig. .--. The constant intercourse with you, together with the Leipzig acids and gases, will be sure to suit him well.  From Weimar I have received a good deal of news lately from Count Beust, Dingelstedt, Gille, and Stor. To the latter my answer will be little satisfactory; but I cannot continue with him on any other road, and let the overpowering Dominant of his spasmodic vanity serve as the Fundamental note of our relations.  I am writing to Gille by the next post, and also to Muller, who rejoiced me lately by his Erinnerungs-Blatt [remembrance] from Weimar, (in the 8th November issue of the \"Zeitschrift,\" which I have only now received). Will you, dear friend, when you have an opportunity, give my best thanks to Kulke for his article upon Symphony and Symphonic Poem--and also the enclosed lines to Fraulein Nikolas, from whom I have received a charming little note?  Already more than 140 pages of the score of my \"Elizabeth\" are written out complete (in my own little cramped scrawl). But the final chorus--about 40 pages--and the piano-arrangement have still to be done. By the middle of August I shall send the entire work  to Carl Gotze at Weimar to copy, together with the \"Canticus of St. Francis,\" which I composed in the spring. [\"Cantico del Sole,\" for baritone solo, men's chorus, and organ. Kahnt.] It would certainly be pleasanter for me if I could bring the things with me--but, between ourselves, I cannot entertain the idea of a speedy return to Germany. If later there seems a likelihood of a termination to my stay in Rome, you, dear friend, shall be the first to hear of it.  With hearty greetings to your wife, I remain  Yours in sincere and friendly attachment,  F. Liszt  Rome, July 12th, 1862  Your little commission about Lowenberg shall be attended to. Let me soon have news of you and of my intimate friends again. There is absolutely nothing to tell you from here that could interest you. In spite of the heat I shall spend the summer months in Rome.    7. To Dr. Franz Brendel  [Letters 7, 8, 9, 18, and 24 to Brendel have been partially published in La Mara's \"Musikerbriefe\" (Letters of Musicians), Vol. II.]  What a delightful bunch of surprises your letter brings me, dear friend! So Pohl has really set to work on the Faust brochure--and Schuberth is actually not going to let the piano-arrangement of the \"Faust Symphony\" lie in a box till it is out of date. How curious it all sounds, just because it is so exactly the right thing and what I desired!--If you are back in Leipzig please send me soon a couple of copies of the Faust brochure (those numbers of the journal containing Pohl's articles have not reached me), and also send me the 2-pianoforte arrangement of the Faust Symphony (a few copies when convenient). I have as yet received nothing of the parcel which Kahnt announced as having sent me with some of my 4-hand things; and as I have fished out here a very talented young pianist, Sgambati [A pupil of Liszt's, and now one of the first pianoforte players and composers of Italy; has been, since 1871, Professor at the Academia Sta. Cecilia in Rome] by name, who makes a first-rate partner in duets, and who, for example, plays the Dante Symphony boldly and correctly, it would be a pleasure to me to be able to go through the whole cycle of the Symphonic Poems with him. Will you be so good therefore, dear friend, as to ask Hartel for the whole lot in the 2-pianoforte arrangement (a double copy of each Symphonic Poem, for with one copy alone I can do nothing, as I myself can only play the thing from notes!), and also the 4-hand arrangement, with the exception of the \"Festklange,\" which Hartels have already sent me?  Besides these, I expect in the same parcel the Marches which Schuberth has published (the \"Goethe Marsch\" and the Duke of Coburg) and the \"Kunstler Festzug\" [Artists' procession] (for 4 hands), which I ordered previously.--  The \"Legend of St. Elizabeth\" is written out to the very last note of the score; I have now only to finish a part of the piano arrangement, and the 4-hand arrangement of the Introduction, the Crusaders' March, and the final procession--which shall be done by the end of this month at latest. Then I send the whole to Weimar to be copied, together with a couple of other smaller manuscripts. What will be its ultimate fate will appear according as...Meanwhile I will try one or two little excursions into the country (to Albano, Frascati, Rocca di Papa--and a little farther still, to the \"Macchia serena\" near Corneto, where in earlier times much robbery and violence took place!), and before the end of September I hope to be able to set steadily to work again, and to continue my musical deeds of \"robbery and murder\"! Would that I only could hear, like you, the Sondershausen orchestra, and were able to conjure friend Stein and his brave phalanx into the Colosseum! The locality would assuredly be no less attractive than the \"Loh,\" [The Sondershausen concerts are, as is well known, given in the \"Lohgarten.\"] and Berlioz's Harold Symphony, or Ce que l'on entend sur la montagne [One of Liszt's Symphonic Poems], would sound there quite \"sonderschauslich\" [curious] [Play of words on Sondershausen and \"sonderbar\" or \"sonderlich\"]. I often imagine the orchestra set up there, with the execrated instruments of percussion in an arcade--our well--wishers Rietz, Taubert, and other braggarts of criticism close by (or in the Aquarium!)--the directors of the Deutsche Musik-Verein resting on the \"Pulvinare,\" and the members all around resting on soft cushions, and making a show in the reserved seats of the Subsellia, as senators and ambassadors used to do!--  Tell Stein of this idea, and give him my most friendly thanks for all the intelligent care and pains that he so very kindly gives to my excommunicated compositions. As regards the performances of the Sondershausen orchestra I am quite of your opinion, and I repeat that they are not only not outdone, but are even not often equalled in their sustained richness, their judicious and liberal choice of works, as well as in their"]]]
