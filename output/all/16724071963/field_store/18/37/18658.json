Time, eternity, The same have taught; but few, alas! the moral see.    There is a sin called self, which binds the world   In fetters fell, than all save truth more strong;   A sin most serpentine, round all men curled,   And in its fatal fold earth writhes full long;   Crime's great first cause, the primal root of wrong,   Parent of pride, and tree of tyranny.   To lay the axe doth unto thee belong.                         1450   Strike, that the world may know of liberty, And Zion's land indeed a land of Zion be!    A choice land, blest above all other lands,   Since earth, reborn, rose sinless from the flood;   Beloved by Him whose holy feet and hands   Were pierced to pour the all-redeeming blood.   Here stands the ancient Altar[4], and here stood   The Ark, till borne triumphant o'er the wave--   The hungry wave that made all flesh its food,   All save a few, whom godly living gave                        1460 To see life's single way and shun death's dual grave[5].    The Old World, not the New, by man misnamed;   Cradle and grave of mouldering nations vast;   Whose stalwart spirit stature, seen, had shamed   The mightiest of known empires, present, past.   The land where Adam dwelt[6], where Eden cast   From flaming gate the heaven-appointed pair,   Who fell that man might be; a fall still chaste[7],   Albeit they sinned, descending death's dread stair, To fling life's ladder down, Love's work[8] and way prepare.    1470    Here rose the Zion of primeval days[9],   Type of a greater Zion yet to rise;   Here Enoch's walls and towers reflung the rays,   Rolled back the flooding splendors of the skies,   Whose portal wide gave welcome. Upward flies   The sainted city, self denied, dethroned:   In all things one, their power e'en death defies:   In dust they ne'er shall slumber; cleansed, condoned, They wait the final change[10], through Him who hath atoned.    Here cometh up the New Jerusalem[11];                         1480   Here cometh down that risen realm of old,   Jehovah's seat, earth's jeweled diadem,   Joy of the world, by prophet tongues extolled.   Japheth, here joined with Shem[12], finds Israel's fold,   An ark of peace[13] amid a world of war.   The ensign[14] on the mountains here behold!   'Tis Joseph signals Jacob[15] from afar, And points him to the goal where God and glory are.    Ancient of Days[16] here sits, as at the first,   When time and earth and Adam's race were young;               1490   When, bowed with age, a great soul's sunset burst   In blessings on his seed. Prophetic tongue,   Thy patriarchal tone through time hath rung!   Michael, the prince, the monarch of our race,   Sire of a world from dust and spirit sprung;   Here sits he, throned in fire; before his face Ten thousand times ten thousand throng the judgment place.    Wherefore this land must unpolluted be;   Or, if defiled, by blood again made clean   From grime of sin, from grind of tyranny;                     1500   Free from the ills that other lands have seen,   Free from the blots that now dim freedom's sheen.   No nation by vain boasting shall abide;   Bid thine beware, lest here the sanguine scene   Reacted be, and ruin, spawn of pride, Spring from the soil where nations great as thine have died.    Hesperia[17], be just--the right maintain,   And foe without, nor foe within, prevails!   Here nations slay themselves, if they be slain,--   Brother 'gainst brother, sire 'gainst son, till fails         1510   The fount of widow's tears and orphan's wails.   Hear thou that servant[18] whom the Father sends--   Hear him and heed, ere Japheth's planet pales,   That peace and freedom may remain thy friends, While hither, from all lands, all worlds, God's legion[19] wends.    A gathering from all glories thou shalt see,   Blest land of Joseph[20], honored, lifted high!   Thy brother lands come bending unto thee,   And Gog and Magog[21] menace but to die.   While they that serve the Lord with single eye                1520   Shall see Him in the midst; the goal then won,   When time no longer flecks eternity,   Nor need is there of star, or moon, or sun, Since He, light's self, is risen, and heaven and earth are one.    Thus far the angel, Ramah's sentinel,   His vigil keeping on that lonely hill;   And thus the spelled yet speechful auditor,   Around the hearthside of that humble home.   There sire and matron, trusted kith and kin,   Give faithful credence to the story strange,                  1530   Pondering the tidings wise and wonderful.    Thence oft above that mount of mystery,   Of buried lore the solemn sepulchre,   Meet modern seer and ancient oracle.   And while humility at wisdom's feet   Expectant waits, where truth from earth shall spring,   Comes, as from riven tomb, this wondrous tale:    Where Joseph[22], where wast thou, that time when torn   Was earth asunder; ocean's cleaving sword   The wedded lands wide severing[23]? Where, when borne         1540   Deep through the watery world, as there devoured   By wind and wave that harmless o'er them roared,   The pilgrim sons of Shinar[24]--favored band,   From that far clime where Babel's folly towered   And language foundered on confusion's strand-- Won here a precious heritage, a promised land?    Preserver of the pure and primal tongue[25],   Most faithful found 'mid living sons of men,   Their leader looked on God; then wrestling wrung   By spirit might, and paged with fiery pen,                    1550   The full of what would be, of what had been;   Sealing the secret till an hour should chime   When faith as mighty unto mortal ken   Would bring the marvel of a book sublime[26], Bridging with lightful lore the shadowy gulf of time.    But pilgrim prows now part the unknown wave;   Above, around, baptismal billows[27] roll.   Divinity, their guide, protection gave,   Else had engulfing seas entombed the whole.   Though tight each launch, where lines of lustre stole         1560   From molten stones, late struck from Shelem's height[28],   And lit by touch divine. Unto the goal   Of that grim voyage, banishing the night, Those crystal miracles gave forth their friendly light.    Till loomed to wistful eyes this waiting land,   Spreading with wing-like continents[29] afar,   As if to welcome worlds. The Chaldean band   The Northland chose, lured by a favoring star,   For South, as North, of human soul was bare.   But liberty loves most a northern zone,                       1570   Where nature's ramparts e'en 'gainst nature's war   Put forth protection. Liberty alone Mahonri's realm[30] might rule--no king, no crown, no throne.    Still, mighty spirit, thou art manifest!   What creed or clan shall win Columbia's crown?   Though freedom weep, by anarchy opprest,   Hesperia's face reflect Europa's frown,   Sceptered religion ne'er shall tread men down.   Belief and unbelief here find one plane,   That freedom's greater cause[31] be not o'erthrown,           1580   But spring and spread till every tongue maintain The kingdom of the King whose throne all worlds sustain.    Here dawns that universal liberty--   Theme of the prophet tongue, the poet pen--   When, winged with power and crowned with purity,   Earth shall be heaven, and gods shall dwell with men;   Fraternity divine, that e'er hath been,   And e'er shall be, the blissful lot of those   Who, conquering self, bind Satan, fetter sin,   And soar beyond the reach of mortal woes,                     1590 Rising to sainted heights, as all past Zions rose[32].    Till then no king upon this crownless land,   Reserved to freedom and to righteousness.   'Gainst her none prosper, lifting hostile hand.   Blest haven, fortressed by God's mightiness[33]!   Kingcraft and priestcraft plant their sure distress.   The past hath spoken--heed the warning tone:   Of pride beware, and baser sordidness--   Self's groveling tyranny, with heart of stone, Whereby, in ages gone, this land did grieve and groan.          1600    \"Give us a king[34]!\" their cry, when power had come,   When wealth was massed, and men were multiplied;   \"A king! A king!\"--vibrant the echoing dome   From northern lake to gulf and ocean tide;   For Satan in their hearts had planted pride.   Grieved was the nation's wise and watchful sire;   Grieved was the faithful kinsman at his side;   From eyes of both shot gleams of righteous ire, As voiced ambitious will its ominous desire.    They sighed: \"This leadeth to captivity--                     1610   Perchance destruction, ending dark and dire.   Yet must we yield to human liberty   Its own, e'en though a brand from freedom's fire   Kindle for freedom's self the fatal pyre.\"   So saying, they anointed one their king   Who craved the crown, by patriot son and sire   Put by in pure denial, lest it bring First care, then crime, and waken woes then slumbering.    For though a king see duty's pathway plain,   And walk therein, as he who now arose;                        1620   What monarch from misrule can all refrain,   When privilege lifts power o'er friends and foes?   Bare is the reign untarnished to the close,   And rarer still the blameless dynasty.   Ofttimes as princes the unkingliest pose,   Because, forsooth, they come of some tall tree, Whose root and trunk were sound, while branches blasted be.    True kingliness--what else proves man a king?   A slave, though throned and sceptered, bides a slave;   Nor pride, nor pelf, nor all that power may bring,            1630   Can make the serf a sovereign, or yet save   The dust of either from the common grave.   Royal the soul must be, or comes to end   All royalty. Spirit, then blood, God gave;   And each at last its separate way doth wend Home to the parent source, to "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37718"],["title","Elias: An Epic of the Ages (#8)"],["body","no more, nor blend.    Scarce gone the goodly ruler when his realm   Saw fierce rebellion rear its horrent head.   Usurping treason seized the civic helm,   Wrong trampled right, and justice, judgment, fled.            1640   Ages looked on while battling kingdoms bled.   Lifted the warning voice--its pleading vain:   A blood-drowned continent, a sea of dead,   And, of a mighty people, fallen, self-slain, A prophet and a king, a solitary twain[35].    That prophet saw the coming of the Lord   Unto the Old, the New, Jerusalem;   Saw Israel returning at His word   From wheresoe'er His will had scattered them;   The realm's wide ruin saw, and strove to stem.                1650   That king, sole scion of a perished race,   Casting his blood-stained sword and diadem,   Lived but to see another nation[36] place Firm foot upon the soil, then vanished from its face.  ---    Wondrous, indeed, that ancient word and wise;   But wiser and more wondrous still the tale--   The after tale[37] of silent centuries,   Tongued by the guardian of the tome of gold:    Again, athwart the wilderness of waves   Surging old East and older West between,                      1660   Where the lone sea a flowery southland laves,   And Zarahemla reigns as ocean queen,   Braving the swell, a storm-tossed bark is seen.   From doomed Jerusalem, to Jacob dear,   Albeit a leper[38], groping, blind, unclean,   Goes forth Manasseh's prophet pioneer[39], Predestined to unveil the hidden hemisphere.    His lot to reap and plant on this rare shore   The promise of his fathers: Joseph's bough[40],   From Jacob's well, the billowy wall runs o'er;                1670   Abides in strength the archer-stricken bow,   Unto the utmost bound prevailing now,   Of Hesper's heaven-upholding hills. Bend, sheaves   Of Israel, as branches bend with snow,   Unto his sheaf grown mightiest! Here, as leaves For multitude, the son the great sire's glory weaves.    Ere chimes for him the earth-departing hour,   Summoning a weary soul to restful toil   In risen worlds, where life puts on all power,   Lehi his house convenes,--their hearts the while              1680   Aglow beneath the burning words that pile   A pyramid of prophecy whose spire   Empierces heaven,--and lest they soil   The prospect pure, and tempt Jehovah's ire, Warns them 'gainst ways of pride and paths of dark desire.    He speaks of Joseph's, Judah's, destiny;   Of blighting and of blessings yet to pour;   Proclaims deliverance his own shall see,   When cometh one the wandering to restore;   Forenames a chosen seer[41] (revealed of yore,                1690   When the boy dreamer's star o'er Egypt rose),   Bringing from dust a blest land's buried lore[42].   Seals then his benison, and eyelids close To wake on worlds divine, whither, past all, he goes.    The favored son[43] of that prophetic sire--   Favored because most faithful and most just--   Hath soared to sacred mysteries still higher,   And tongued to envious ears the heavenly trust.   And serpent self, that demon of the dust,   Hath coiled and clung around rebellious souls,                1700   Ne'er friendly though fraternal, whose distrust   And jealousy breed bitterness that rolls Rivers of wormwood 'twixt two races and their goals.    Now peoples twain the Promised Land divide:   Northland and Southland see their tribes increase,   From Arctic floe to far Antarctic tide;   From where the Eastern waves their thunders cease,   To where the Western waters are at peace.   White and delightsome, they that worship God;   They that deny Him, dark, degenerate, these,                  1710   Doomed the stern wild to penetrate and plod-- Transgression's scourge and school, the Chastener's heavy rod[44].    The throneless ruler of the regnant race--   King, but no tyrant--prophet, priest, and seer,   Meets upon sacred summits, face to face   (As when to Moses drew Jehovah near),   The Infinite and Spirit Minister[45],   Meets Him as man meets man, and by His grace   The power is given, with seeric eye to peer,   Time's vista viewing through prophetic glass:                 1720 Plain to his gaze revealed, the unborn ages pass.    War, slaughter, conquest; heroes, sages, famed;   Kingdoms, republics, empires, rise and fall;   Till pride unknown, and tyranny unnamed,   Where righteous rule brings blessedness to all.   Then self again, the universal thrall.   The faithful, dead or dwindled to a few,   Crime begets crimes the heavens to appall.   Now arrows of God's anger pierce them through, And horrors piled on horrors make misery's retinue.             1730    All this and more the prophet-prince foresaw[46];   Messiah's self--Jehovah--Him beheld,--   The Perfect One, in whom was found no flaw,   Though slander as an ocean round Him swelled.   Life's deathless tree--deathless, though demon-felled;   The crash resounding to this far-off shore,   Whose winnowed remnant welcomed Him, revealed   In risen glory, when had ceased the roar Of wrecking tempests, flung His radiant face before.    At Whose rebuke the haughty mountains bowed.                  1740   Shorn by the whirlwind, sunk, or swept away,   No more their frown the lowly valleys cowed,   Rising like billows 'mid the wrathful fray,   And dashing 'gainst the skies their dusty spray.   Rocks, boulders, hills, no titan strength could lift,   Hurtle as pebbles in the storm-fiend's play.   Earth opes her jaws, and through the yawning rift Cities, peoples, vanish; of hope, of life bereft.    Three hours of tempest, and three days of night;   Thick darkness, thunder-burst, and lightning flash;           1750   Millions engulfed, millions in prostrate plight,   Groveling as slaves that feel or fear the lash,   Mingling their groans and cries with grind and crash   Of crags the cyclone's catapult impels,   Whose shrieking flails the fields and forests thrash!   Wild o'er the land roused ocean's anger swells, And flame's relentless tongue the final doom[47] foretells.    Three hours of stormful strife--then all is still,   Save for a voice the universe might hear,   Proclaiming what hath hapt as heaven's high will,             1760   Dispensing pardon and dispelling fear.   Anon a mightier marvel doth appear;   Uprolls the misty curtain of the sky--   The midday sun no more their minister,   Greater hath risen! and glories multiply, As angels in their gaze earthward and heavenward fly.    He greets them as a shepherd greets his flock;   Shows them His wounded side, His hands, His feet;   Then builds His church upon the stricken Rock,   Where flow life's healing waters, limpid, sweet,              1770   As infant innocence[48], that joys to meet   Its great Original. With holy hand   He ministers, bids death and hell retreat,   And singles twelve from out the sainted band, To sow with words of life the trembling, tear-worn land.    He bids them prize the truth from heaven outpoured--   What late His tongue hath told, and all that seers   Of earlier days, who owned Him as their Lord,   Have sounded in a world's unwilling ears;   That truth with truth may blend in after years,               1780   As rivers many to one ocean flow;   That when Messiah in his might appears,   Men all may see Him as he is, and know The Majesty of Heaven, 'mid nations bending low.    He greets them as His \"other sheep\"[49]--a fold   Unknown to Judah, but to Jesus known;   And tells of others still, whose fate untold   Hath been the skeptic's scoff and stumbling stone.   All Israel must hear, and one alone   The shepherd be, to guide and govern all.                     1790   Where'er, from torrid belt to icy zone,   They wander, they must heed the warning call, And flee to Zion's shore ere crumbling Babel fall.    He numbers them with Joseph, known of old,   Whose flock the wolves shall tear in time to come;   Because a wasteful heir his portion sold,   A prodigal forsook the parent dome,   To riot in the wilderness and roam,   Feeding on husks: yet, turning at the last,   Redeemed from darkness, to the Father's home;                 1800   And there, the hour of retribution past, Forgiven, at His dear feet their weary souls they cast.    Anon He pictures Japheth's destiny[50]:   The Gentile prospering in the Promised Land,   The guardian of the ark of liberty,   So long as he for human right shall stand,   Nor trample on Jehovah's high command.   But woe to them of flinty heart and face   Who from Him turn, to smite with ruthless hand   The withered remnant of a star-ruled race!                    1810 For Laman yet shall spring, a lion to the chase[51].    Vexing the vexer with a vengeance sore,   Who, false to highest hope of human need,   Shall tyrant turn, and play the part no more   Of nursing parent unto Joseph's seed,   For whom a nation founded was and freed,   That from its hand to his fierce house might flow   The promise of his fathers. God shall plead   With Japheth, till his pride shall melt like snow, Swept from the mountain side, chased by the sun's red glow[52]. 1820    His word now builds the New Jerusalem--   (Earth-born, though basking in eternal rays)[53],   Which Japheth, blent with Jacob, joined with Shem,   Shall rear on Joseph's land in modern days.   The Father's work of wonder He portrays:--   A servant, marred[54], though hurt not, and yet healed,   Whom wisdom hearkens to, whom faith obeys;   Arm of the Lord, long lying unrevealed, Uplifted and made bare, His flock to fold and shield.    Sounds then a parting note, a plaint of woe,                   1830   'Gainst coming ages of iniquity,   Ere purifying floods o'er earth shall flow,   And man from sin and self delivered be.   Then, of the twelve, he sanctifieth three[55],   With power o'er death, and gives them to remain   Till comes He in His glory, Lo! they see   The opening heavens receive Him once again; And marvels else behold, that mortal tongues must chain.    Three generations pass in righteousness;   A fourth begins, and still "]]]
