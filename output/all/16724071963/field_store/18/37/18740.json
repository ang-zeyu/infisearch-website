The reason is that we are not dealing with static bodies fixed in space but with moving objects, and the objects that pass through a cubic mile are not the sum of the objects moving through each of its 500 parts. If this fact is not immediately apparent, consider the circumstances in Figures 6 and 7, illustrating the principle as it applies to areas. The relative capacity of the sample and the whole to intercept bodies in motion is more closely expressed by the ratio of their perimeters in the case of areas and the ratio of their surface areas in the case of volumes. But even these ratios lead to inaccurate results unless the objects are moving in all directions equally (see Figure 8). Since bird migration exhibits strong directional tendencies, I have come to the conclusion that no sampling procedure that can be applied to it is sufficiently reliable short of handling each directional trend separately.      [Illustration: FIG. 6. The problem of sampling migrating        birds. The large square in the diagram may be thought of as a        square mile on the earth's surface, divided into four equal        smaller squares. Birds are crossing over the area in three        directions, equally spaced, so that each of the subdivisions        is traversed by three of them. We might be tempted to        conclude that 4 × 3, or 12, would pass over the large square.        Actually there are only seven birds involved all told.        Obviously, the interceptive potential of a small square and a        larger square do not stand in the same ratio as their areas.]  For this reason, the success of the whole quantitative study of migration depends upon our ability to make directional analyses of primary data. As I have already pointed out, the flight directions of birds may be recorded with convenience and a fair degree of objectivity by noting the slant of their apparent pathways across the disc of the moon. But these apparent pathways are seldom the real pathways. Usually they involve the transfer of the flight line from a horizontal plane of flight to a tilted plane represented by the face of the moon, and so take on the nature of a projection. They are clues to directions, but they are not the directions themselves. For each compass direction of birds flying horizontally above the earth, there is one, and only one, slant of the pathway across the moon at a given time. It is possible, therefore, knowing the path of a bird in relation to the lunar disc and the time of the observation, to compute the direction of its path in relation to the earth. The formula employed is not a complicated one, but, since the meaning of the lunar coördinates in terms of their corresponding flight paths parallel to the earth is constantly changing with the position of the moon, the calculation of each bird's flight separately would require a tremendous amount of time and effort.      [Illustration: FIG. 7. The sampling effect of a square. In        Diagram A eight evenly distributed birds are flying from        south to north, and another four are proceeding from east to        west. Three appear in each of the smaller squares. Thus, if        we were to treat any of these smaller sections as a directly        proportionate sample of the whole, we would be assuming that        3 × 16, or 48, birds had traversed the square mile--four        times the real total of 12. If we consider the paths        separately as in Diagram B, we see quite clearly what is        wrong. Every bird crosses four plots the size of the sample        and is being computed into the total over and over a        corresponding number of times. Patently, just as many        south-north birds cross the bottom tier of squares as cross        the four tiers comprising the whole area. Just as many        west-east birds traverse one side of the large square as        cross the whole square. In other words, the inclusion of        additional sections _athwart_ the direction of flight        involves the inclusion of additional birds proceeding in that        direction, while the inclusion of additional sections _along_        the direction does not. The correct ratio of the sample to        the whole would seem to be the ratio of their perimeters, in        this case the ratio of one to four. When this factor of four        is applied to the problem it proves correct: 4 × 3 (the        number of birds that have been seen in the sample square)        equals 12 (the exact number of birds that could be seen in        the square mile).]      [Illustration: FIG. 8. Rectangular samples of square areas.        In Diagram A, where as many birds are flying from west to        east as are flying from south to north, the perimeter ratio        (three to eight) correctly expresses the number of birds that        have traversed the whole area relative to the number that        have passed through the sample. But in Diagram B, where all        thirty-two birds are flying from south to north, the correct        ratio is the ratio of the base of the sample to the base of        the total area (one to four), and use of the perimeter ratio        would lead to an inaccurate result (forty-three instead of        thirty-two birds). Perimeter ratios do not correctly express        relative interceptory potential, unless the shape of the        sample is the same as the shape of the whole, or unless the        birds are flying in all directions equally.]  Whatever we do, computed individual flight directions must be frankly recognized as approximations. Their anticipated inaccuracies are not the result of defects in the mathematical procedure employed. This is rigorous. The difficulty lies in the impossibility of reading the slants of the pathways on the moon precisely and in the three-dimensional nature of movement through space. The observed coördinates of birds' pathways across the moon are the projected product of two component angles--the compass direction of the flight and its slope off the horizontal, or gradient. These two factors cannot be dissociated by any technique yet developed. All we can do is to compute what a bird's course would be, if it were flying horizontal to the earth during the interval it passes before the moon. We cannot reasonably assume, of course, that all nocturnal migration takes place on level planes, even though the local distractions so often associated with sloping flight during the day are minimized in the case of migrating birds proceeding toward a distant destination in darkness. We may more safely suppose, however, that deviations from the horizontal are random in nature, that it is mainly a matter of chance whether the observer happens to see an ascending segment of flight or a descending one. Over a series of observations, we may expect a fairly even distribution of ups and downs. It follows that, although departures from the horizontal may distort individual directions, they tend to average out in the computed trend of the mean. The working of this principle applied to the undulating flight of the Goldfinch (_Spinus_) is illustrated in Figure 9.      [Illustration: FIG. 9. The effect of vertical components in        bird flight. The four diagrams illustrate various effects        that might result if a bird with an undulating flight, such        as a Goldfinch, flew before a moon 45° above the horizon. In        each case the original profile of the pathways, illustrated        against the dark background, is flattened considerably as a        result of projection. In the situation shown in Diagram A,        where the high point of the flight line, GHJ, occurs within        the field of the telescope, it is not only obvious that a        deviation is involved, but the line GJ drawn between the        entry and departure points coincides with the normal        coördinates of a bird proceeding on a horizontal plane. In        Diagrams B and C, one which catches an upward segment of        flight, and the other, a downward segment, the nature of the        deviation would not be detectable, and an incorrect direction        would be computed from the coördinates. Over a series of        observations, including many Goldfinches, one would expect a        fairly even distribution of ups and downs. Since the average        between the coördinate angles in Diagrams B and C, +19° and        -19°, is the angle of the true coördinate, we have here a        situation where the errors tend to compensate. In Diagram D,        where the bird is so far away that several undulations are        encompassed within the diameter of the field of view, the        coördinate readings do not differ materially from those of a        straight line.]  Since _individually_ computed directions are not very reliable in any event, little is to be lost by treating the observed pathways in groups. Consequently, the courses of all the birds seen in a one-hour period may be computed according to the position of the moon at the middle of the interval and expressed in terms of their general positions on the compass, rather than their exact headings. For this latter purpose, the compass has been divided into twelve fixed sectors, 22-1/2 degrees wide. The trends of the flight paths are identified by the mid-direction of the sector into which they fall. The sectoring method is described in detail in the section on procedures.      [Illustration: Fig. 10. The interceptory potential of        slanting lines. The diagram deals with one direction of        flight and its incidence across lines of six different        slants, lines of identical length oriented in six different        ways. Obviously, the number of birds that cross a line        depends not only on the length of the line, but also on its        slant with respect to the flight paths.]  The problem remains of converting the number of birds involved in each directional trend to a fixed standard of measurement.

All of the west-east flight paths that cross the large square also cross one of its mile-long sides and suggest the practicability of expressing the amount of migration in any certain direction in terms of the assumed quantity passing over a one-mile line in a given interval of time. However, many lines of that length can be included within the same set of flight paths (Figure 10); and the number of birds intercepted depends in part upon the orientation of the line. The 90° line is the only one that fully measures the amount of flight per linear unit of front; and so I have chosen as a standard an imaginary mile on the earth's surface lying at right angles to the direction in which the birds are traveling.   _Definitions of Flight Density_  When the count of birds in the cone of observation is used as a sample to determine the theoretical number in a sector passing over such a mile line, the resulting quantity represents what I shall call a Sector Density. It is one of several expressions of the more general concept of Flight Density, which may be defined as the passage of migration past an observation station stated in terms of the theoretical number of birds flying over a one-mile line on the earth's surface in a given interval of time. Note that a flight density is primarily a theoretical number, a statistical expression, a _rate_ of passage. It states merely that birds were moving through the effective field of observation at the _rate_ of so many per mile per unit of time. It may or may not closely express the amount of migration occurring over an actual mile or series of miles. The extent to which it does so is to be decided by other general criteria and by the circumstances surrounding a given instance. Its basic function is to take counts of birds made at different times and at different places, in fields of observation of different sizes, and to put them on the statistically equal footing that is the first requisite of any sound comparison.  The idea of a one-mile line as a standard spacial measurement is an integral part of the basic concept, as herein propounded. But, within these limitations, flight density may be expressed in many different ways, distinguished chiefly by the directions included and the orientation of the one-mile line with respect to them. Three such kinds of density have been found extremely useful in subsequent analyses and are extensively employed in this paper: Sector, Net Trend, and Station Density, or Station Magnitude.  Sector Density has already been referred to. It may be defined as the flight density within a 22-1/2° directional spread, or sector, measured across a one-mile line lying at right angles to the mid-direction of the sector. It is the basic type of density from the point of view of the computer, the others being derived from it. In analysis it provides a means of comparing directional trends at the same station and of studying variation in directional fanning.  Net Trend Density represents the maximum net flow of migration over a one-mile line. It is found by plotting the sector densities directionally as lines of thrust, proportioned according to the density in each sector, and using vector analysis to obtain a vector resultant, representing the density and direction of the net trend. The mile line defining the spacial limits lies at right angles to this vector resultant, but the density figure includes all of the birds crossing the line, not just those that do so at a specified angle. Much of the directional spread exhibited by sector densities undoubtedly has no basis in reality but results from inaccuracies in coördinate readings and from practical difficulties inherent in the method of computation. By reducing all directions to one major trend, net trend density has the advantage of balancing errors one against the other and may often give the truer index to the way in which the birds are actually going. On the other hand, if the basic directions are too widely spread or if the major sector vectors are widely separated with little or no representation between, the net trend density may become an abstraction, expressing the idea of a mean direction but pointing down an avenue along which no migrants are traveling. In such instances, little of importance can be learned from it. In others, it gives an idea of general trends indispensable in comparing station with station to test the existence of flyways and in mapping the continental distribution of flight on a given night to study the influence of weather factors.  Station Density, or Station Magnitude, represents all of the migration activity in an hour in the vicinity of the observation point, regardless of direction. It expresses the sum of all sector densities. It includes, therefore, the birds flying at right angles over several one-mile lines. One way of picturing its physical meaning is to imagine a circle one-mile in diameter lying on the earth with the observation point in the center. Then all of the birds that fly over this circle in an hour's time constitute the hourly station density. While its visualization thus suggests the idea of an area, it is derived from linear expressions of density; and, while it involves no limitation with respect to direction, it could not be computed without taking every component direction into consideration. Station density is adapted to studies involving the total migration activity at various stations. So far it has been the most profitable of all the density concepts, throwing important light on nocturnal rhythm, seasonal increases in migration, and the vexing problem of the distribution of migrating birds in the region of the Gulf of Mexico.  Details of procedure in arriving at these three types of flight density will be explained in Section B of this discussion. For the moment, it will suffice to review and amplify somewhat the general idea involved.   _Altitude as a Factor in Flight Density_  A flight density, as we have seen, may be defined as the number of birds passing over a line one mile long; and it may be calculated from the number of birds crossing the segment of that line included in an elliptical cross-section of the cone of observation. It may be thought of with equal correctness, without in any way contradicting the accuracy of the original definition, as the number of birds passing through a vertical plane one mile long whose upper limits are its intersection with the flight ceiling and whose base coincides with the one mile line of the previous visualization. From the second point of view, the sample becomes an area bounded by the triangular projection of the cone of observation on the density plane. The dimensions of two triangles thus determined from any two cones of observation stand in the same ratio as the dimensions of their elliptical sections on any one plane; so both approaches lead ultimately to the same result. The advantage of this alternative way of looking at things is that it enables us to consider the vertical aspects of migration--to comprehend the relation of altitude to bird density.  If the field of observation were cylindrical in shape, if it had parallel sides, if its projection were a rectangle or a parallelogram, the height at which birds are flying would not be a factor in finding out their number. Then the sample would be of equal breadth throughout, with an equally wide representation of the flight at all levels. Since the field of observation is actually an inverted cone, triangular in section, with diverging sides, the opportunity to detect birds increases with their distance from the observer. The chances of seeing the birds passing below an elevation midway to the flight ceiling are only one-third as great as of seeing those passing above that elevation, simply because the area of that part of the triangle below the mid-elevation is only one-third as great as the area of that part above the mid-elevation. If we assume that the ratio of the visible number of birds to the number passing through the density plane is the same as the ratio of the triangular section of the cone to the total area of the plane, we are in effect assuming that the density plane is made up of a series of triangles the size of the sample, each intercepting approximately the same number of birds. We are assuming that the same number of birds pass through the inverted triangular sample as through the erect and uninvestigable triangle beside it (as in Figure 11, Diagram II). In reality, the assumption is sound only if the altitudinal distribution of migrants is uniform.      [Illustration: FIG. 11. Theoretical possibilities of        vertical distribution. Diagram I shows the effect of a        uniform vertical distribution of birds. The figures indicate        the number of birds in the respective areas. Here the sample        triangle, ABD, contains the same number of birds as the        upright triangle, ACD, adjacent to it; the density plane may        be conceived of as a series of such alternating triangles,        equal in their content of birds. Diagram II portrays, on an        exaggerated scale, the situation when many more birds are        flying below the median altitude than above it. In contrast        to the 152 birds occurring in the triangle A´C´D´, only        seventy-two are seen in the triangle A´B´D´. Obviously, the        latter triangle does not provide a representative sample of        the total number of birds intersecting the density plane.        Diagram III illustrates one method by which this difficulty        may be overcome. By lowering the line F´G´ to the median        altitude of bird density, F´´G´´ (the elevation above which        there are just as many birds as below), we are able to        determine a rectangular panel, HIJK, whose content of birds        provides a representative sample of the vertical        distribution.]  The definite data on this subject are"]]]
