NEIBARGER, STATE PRINTER   TOPEKA, KANSAS   1962     29-1505     A New Subspecies of Ground Squirrel (Spermophilus spilosoma) from Tamaulipas, Mexico  BY TICUL ALVAREZ   When A. H. Howell (N. Amer. Fauna, 56:1-256, 1938) revised the North American ground squirrels, he had no specimens of the spotted ground squirrel, _Spermophilus spilosoma_, from Tamaulipas. Thirteen years later, Hall (Univ. Kansas Publ., Mus. Nat. Hist., 5:38, 1951) listed the species for the first time from the state when he recorded as _S. s. annectens_ 13 specimens from the barrier beach 88-89 miles south and 10 miles west of Matamoros.  In 1953, Mr. Gerd Heinrich collected 10 individuals of _S. spilosoma_ from the coastal plain of eastern Tamaulipas that extend southward the known range of the species on the east coast of México, provide the first specimens from the mainland of Tamaulipas, and represent a new subspecies that is named and described below.   =Spermophilus spilosoma oricolus= new subspecies       _Type._--Female, adult, skin and skull, No. 55497 Museum of Natural      History, The University of Kansas; from one mile east of La Pesca,      Tamaulipas, México; obtained on May 27, 1953, by Gerd Heinrich,      original number 6933.       _Diagnosis._--Size medium for species (see measurements); general      color cinnamon buff, almost pure on dorsal surface of hind foot and      dorsal and ventral midline of tail; spots well marked; postorbital      constriction narrow; auditory bullae small; viewed from front,      lower border of maxillary plate forming continuously concave line      with jugal; zygomatic process of maxillary narrow, having anterior      border concave.       _Comparisons._--From _Spermophilus spilosoma annectens_ (specimens      from Padre and Mustang islands, Texas), _S. s. oricolus_ differs as      follows: larger in external dimensions but smaller in cranial      dimensions; postorbital constriction narrower, 13.4 (13.2-13.8)      instead of 14.0 (13.5-14.7); rostrum slightly broader; greatest      distance between posterior border of maxillary plate and squamosal      arm of zygoma longer, averaging 9.9 (9.7-10.2) instead of 9.6      (9.0-10.1); zygomatic process of maxillary, viewed dorsolaterally      above lacrimal narrower, having anterior border concave instead of      almost straight; when skull viewed from front, lower border of      maxillary plate forming continuously concave line with jugal      instead of almost a right angle where jugal and maxillary meet;      ramus of lower jaw narrower; general color paler; upper surface of      hind foot washed with cinnamon instead of yellowish; postauricular      spot absent (usually present in _annectens_).       From _Spermophilus spilosoma pallescens_ (specimens from      southeastern Coahuila), _S. s. oricolus_ differs as follows: color      more cinnamon especially on upper surface of hind foot; dorsal      spots more distinct; smaller externally, except hind foot, which      measures the same; braincase and postorbital constriction narrower;      nasals shorter; auditory bullae conspicuously smaller.       From _Spermophilus spilosoma cabrerai_ (specimens from eastern San      Luis Potosí), _S. s. oricolus_ differs mainly in pale (cinnamon)      rather than dark (blackish) upper parts, but differs also in being      smaller externally (judging from measurements given in the original      description by Dalquest, Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington, 64:107,      1951), and in having a greater zygomatic breadth, narrower      braincase and postorbital constriction, and narrower maxillary      process.       _Measurements._--Average and extreme measurements of eight      specimens from the type locality (four females, including type, and      four males) are as follows: total length (only five specimens), 234      (212-245); length of tail vertebrae (five only), 67 (50-75); length      of hind foot, 36.1 (35-37); length of ear from notch, 8.4      (7.5-10.0); length of head and body, 166 (155-171); greatest length      of skull, 41.2 (40.6-42.7); zygomatic breadth, 24.4 (23.7-25.2);      cranial breadth, 18.4 (17.8-18.9); interorbital constriction, 9.2      (8.5-9.8); postorbital constriction, 13.4 (13.2-13.8); length of      nasals, 14.0 (13.6-14.8); length of maxillary tooth-row, 8.0      (7.7-8.4); greatest distance between posterior border of maxillary      plate and squamosal arm of zygoma, 9.9 (9.7-10.2).       _Remarks._--The type locality of _S. s. oricolus_ is nearly at sea      level on the coastal plain of eastern Tamaulipas. In so far as now      known, the population of ground squirrel here named as new is      isolated, the nearest records of occurrence being those reported by      Hall (_loc. cit._) from a place on the barrier beach approximately      80 miles north of La Pesca. The nearest record from the mainland      (_S. s. annectens_) is from southern Texas.       A possible explanation for the presence of the species at La Pesca      is that it dispersed southward along the barrier beach, and that an      isolated or semi-isolated segment finally reached the mainland      where the barrier beach rejoins it just northeast of La Pesca. This      possibility is strengthened by study of the specimens already      mentioned from 88-89 miles south and 10 miles west of Matamoros,      because they combine many characters of _annectens_ and _oricolus_.      The insular specimens differ from both _annectens_ and _oricolus_      in having shorter nasals and a shorter skull, narrower zygomatic      and interorbital regions, and a relatively broader interpterygoid      space. Also, the zygomatic process of the maxillary, viewed      dorsolaterally above the lacrimal, is even narrower that in      _oricolus_ and has the anterior border even more concave. In color,      specimens from the barrier beach are pale as is _oricolus_, but the      over-all color is reddish cinnamon rather than cinnamon buff.      Concerning the juncture of the zygomatic plate with the jugal, 12      of the 13 specimens studied resemble _annectens_ in this character      and one resembles _oricolus_. The specimens from the barrier beach      may themselves represent an unnamed subspecies; more material than      now is available is needed, because most of the specimens are not      fully adult. Because the 13 specimens from the barrier beach      resemble _oricolus_ slightly more than _annectens_, all characters      considered, they are tentatively assigned to _oricolus_.       The author is grateful to Professor E. Raymond Hall and Mr. J. Knox      Jones, Jr., for permission to examine the specimens here reported      and for helpful suggestions. Field work that yielded the specimens      was financed by the Kansas University Endowment Association. The      laboratory phases of the study were made when the author was a      half-time Research Assistant supported by a grant, No. 56 G 103,      from the National Science Foundation.       _Specimens examined._--A total of 23, all from Tamaulipas: 88 mi.
