We have now perceived, that all the explanations commonly given of nature are mere modes of imagining, and do not indicate the true nature of anything, but only the constitution of the imagination; and, although they have names, as though they were entities, existing externally to the imagination, I call them entities imaginary rather than real; and, therefore, all arguments against us drawn from such abstractions are easily rebutted.  Many argue in this way.  If all things follow from a necessity of the absolutely perfect nature of God, why are there so many imperfections in nature? such, for instance, as things corrupt to the point of putridity, loathsome deformity, confusion, evil, sin, &c.  But these reasoners are, as I have said, easily confuted, for the perfection of things is to be reckoned only from their own nature and power; things are not more or less perfect, according as they delight or offend human senses, or according as they are serviceable or repugnant to mankind.  To those who ask why God did not so create all men, that they should be governed only by reason, I give no answer but this: because matter was not lacking to him for the creation of every degree of perfection from highest to lowest; or, more strictly, because the laws of his nature are so vast, as to suffice for the production of everything conceivable by an infinite intelligence, as I have shown in Prop. xvi.  Such are the misconceptions I have undertaken to note; if there are any more of the same sort, everyone may easily dissipate them for himself with the aid of a little reflection.     Part II.  ON THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE MIND   PREFACE    I now pass on to explaining the results, which must necessarily follow from the essence of God, or of the eternal and infinite being; not, indeed, all of them (for we proved in Part i., Prop. xvi., that an infinite number must follow in an infinite number of ways), but only those which are able to lead us, as it were by the hand, to the knowledge of the human mind and its highest blessedness.   DEFINITIONS  DEFINITION I.  By body I mean a mode which expresses in a certain determinate manner the essence of God, in so far as he is considered as an extended thing.  (See Pt. i., Prop. xxv., Coroll.)  DEFINITION II.  I consider as belonging to the essence of a thing that, which being given, the thing is necessarily given also, and, which being removed, the thing is necessarily removed also; in other words, that without which the thing, and which itself without the thing, can neither be nor be conceived.  DEFINITION III. By idea, I mean the mental conception which is formed by the mind as a thinking thing.  Explanation.--I say conception rather than perception, because the word perception seems to imply that the mind is passive in respect to the object; whereas conception seems to express an activity of the mind.  DEFINITION IV.  By an adequate idea, I mean an idea which, in so far as it is considered in itself, without relation to the object, has all the properties or intrinsic marks of a true idea.  Explanation.--I say intrinsic, in order to exclude that mark which is extrinsic, namely, the agreement between the idea and its object (ideatum).  DEFINITION V.  Duration is the indefinite continuance of existing.  Explanation.--I say indefinite, because it cannot be determined through the existence itself of the existing thing, or by its efficient cause, which necessarily gives the existence of the thing, but does not take it away.  DEFINITION VI.  Reality and perfection I use as synonymous terms.  DEFINITION VII.  By particular things, I mean things which are finite and have a conditioned existence; but if several individual things concur in one action, so as to be all simultaneously the effect of one cause, I consider them all, so far, as one particular thing.   AXIOMS  I.  The essence of man does not involve necessary existence, that is, it may, in the order of nature, come to pass that this or that man does or does not exist.  II.  Man thinks.  III.  Modes of thinking, such as love, desire, or any other of the passions, do not take place, unless there be in the same individual an idea of the thing loved, desired, &c.  But the idea can exist without the presence of any other mode of thinking.  IV.  We perceive that a certain body is affected in many ways.  V.  We feel and perceive no particular things, save bodies and modes of thought.  N.B.  The Postulates are given after the conclusion of Prop. xiii.   PROPOSITIONS  PROP. I.  Thought is an attribute of God, or God is a thinking thing.  Proof.--Particular thoughts, or this and that thought, are modes which, in a certain conditioned manner, express the nature of God (Pt. i., Prop. xxv., Coroll.).  God therefore possesses the attribute (Pt. i., Def. v.) of which the concept is involved in all particular thoughts, which latter are conceived thereby. Thought, therefore, is one of the infinite attributes of God, which express God's eternal and infinite essence (Pt. i., Def. vi.).  In other words, God is a thinking thing.  Q.E.D.  Note.--This proposition is also evident from the fact, that we are able to conceive an infinite thinking being.  For, in proportion as a thinking being is conceived as thinking more thoughts, so is it conceived as containing more reality or perfection.  Therefore a being, which can think an infinite number of things in an infinite number of ways, is, necessarily, in respect of thinking, infinite.  As, therefore, from the consideration of thought alone, we conceive an infinite being, thought is necessarily (Pt. i., Deff. iv. and vi.) one of the infinite attributes of God, as we were desirous of showing.  PROP. II.  Extension is an attribute of God, or God is an extended thing.  Proof.--The proof of this proposition is similar to that of the last.  PROP. III.  In God there is necessarily the idea not only of his essence, but also of all things which necessarily follow from his essence.  Proof.--God (by the first Prop. of this Part) can think an infinite number of things in infinite ways, or (what is the same thing, by Prop. xvi., Part i.) can form the idea of his essence, and of all things which necessarily follow therefrom.  Now all that is in the power of God necessarily is (Pt. i., Prop. xxxv.). Therefore, such an idea as we are considering necessarily is, and in God alone.  Q.E.D.  (Part i., Prop. xv.)  Note.--The multitude understand by the power of God the free will of God, and the right over all things that exist, which latter are accordingly generally considered as contingent.  For it is said that God has the power to destroy all things, and to reduce them to nothing.  Further, the power of God is very often likened to the power of kings.  But this doctrine we have refuted (Pt. i., Prop. xxxii., Corolls. i. and ii.), and we have shown (Part i., Prop. xvi.) that God acts by the same necessity, as that by which he understands himself; in other words, as it follows from the necessity of the divine nature (as all admit), that God understands himself, so also does it follow by the same necessity, that God performs infinite acts in infinite ways.  We further showed (Part i., Prop. xxxiv.), that God's power is identical with God's essence in action; therefore it is as impossible for us to conceive God as not acting, as to conceive him as non--existent.  If we might pursue the subject further, I could point out, that the power which is commonly attributed to God is not only human (as showing that God is conceived by the multitude as a man, or in the likeness of a man), but involves a negation of power.  However, I am unwilling to go over the same ground so often.  I would only beg the reader again and again, to turn over frequently in his mind what I have said in Part I from Prop. xvi. to the end.  No one will be able to follow my meaning, unless he is scrupulously careful not to confound the power of God with the human power and right of kings.  PROP. IV.  The idea of God, from which an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only be one.  Proof.--Infinite intellect comprehends nothing save the attributes of God and his modifications (Part i., Prop. xxx.). Now God is one (Part i., Prop. xiv., Coroll.).  Therefore the idea of God, wherefrom an infinite number of things follow in infinite ways, can only be one.  Q.E.D.  PROP. V.  The actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, only in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing, not in so far as he is unfolded in any other attribute; that is, the ideas both of the attributes of God and of particular things do not own as their efficient cause their objects (ideata) or the things perceived, but God himself in so far as he is a thinking thing.  Proof.--This proposition is evident from Prop. iii. of this Part.  We there drew the conclusion, that God can form the idea of his essence, and of all things which follow necessarily therefrom, solely because he is a thinking thing, and not because he is the object of his own idea.  Wherefore the actual being of ideas owns for cause God, in so far as he is a thinking thing. It may be differently proved as follows: the actual being of ideas is (obviously) a mode of thought, that is (Part i., Prop. xxv., Coroll.) a mode which expresses in a certain manner the nature of God, in so far as he is a thinking thing, and therefore (Part i., Prop. x.) involves the conception of no other attribute of God, and consequently (by Part i., Ax. iv.) is not the effect of any attribute save thought.  Therefore the actual being of ideas owns God as its cause, in so far as he is considered as a thinking thing, &c.  Q.E.D.  PROP. VI.  The modes of any given attribute are"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38003"],["title","Color Key to North American Birds (#0)"],["body","KEY TO                            NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS         +------------------------------------------------------------------+   |                        By FRANK M.

APPLETON & CO.   1912     _Published November 1912_     Printed in the United States     PREFACE.   To learn to call a bird by its right name is the first step in the study of ornithology. We may propose to investigate the structure, food, and habits of the birds of the world, or desire merely a superficial knowledge of the species found in our garden, but in either case we are at once confronted by this question of identification.  From the scientific point of view there is but one satisfactory way to identify a bird. A specimen of it should be in hand in order that its form, color, and size may be accurately determined, when, with the aid of analytical keys, with which most text-books are provided, it is a simple matter to ascertain the bird's name.  Wide experience has shown the writer, however, that where one dead bird is identified, hundreds of attempts are made to name the living bird in nature. This is to be expected. It is the natural outcome of the recent remarkable interest in the study of birds which, fostered by Audubon Societies and nature study teachers, has assumed an ethical and educational importance of the first magnitude.  We cannot place a gun in the hands of these thousands of bird-lovers whom we are yearly developing; indeed most of them would refuse to use it. Specimens, therefore, are rarely available to them and we should make some special effort to meet their peculiar wants. The present volume has been prepared with this end in view. Identification of the bird in the bush is its sole end; an end, however, which we trust will prove but the beginning of a new and potent interest in nature.                                                        FRANK M. CHAPMAN    _American Museum of Natural History,   New York City, 1903._     PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.   In the present edition of the Color Key the body of the book, aside from the correction of typographical errors, remains as it was in the preceding edition. The Systematic Table has been reset and brought up to July, 1912, the date of the publication of the latest supplement to the third edition of the American Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List of North American Birds.' Two Appendixes are added. The first includes all the changes in nomenclature and descriptions of new birds which have been accepted by the A.O.U. Committee on Classification and Nomenclature since the publication of the Color Key in 1903; the second contains a list of faunal ornithological papers which it is hoped will add greatly to the reference value of the book.

They do not pretend to be perfect reproductions of every shade and tint of the plumage of the species they figure, but aim to present a bird's characteristic colors as they appear when seen at a distance. It was impracticable to draw all the birds to the same scale but all those on the same page are so figured. Reference should always be made, however, to the measurements given at the beginning at each description. The figures are based on the male bird.   LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS.    [Male].   The sign of Mars, signifying male.    [Female]. The sign of Venus, signifying female.    Ad. Adult, a bird in fully mature plumage.    Yng. Young, a fully grown bird which has not yet acquired the        plumage of the adult.    L. Length, the distance from the tip of the bill to the end of the      tail. This measurement is made from dead birds, birds in life      appear somewhat shorter.    W. Wing, the distance from the 'bend' of the wing to the end of the      longest feather.    T. Tail, the distance from the insertion of the tail-feathers to the      end of the longest one.    Tar. Tarsus, the distance from the heel to the insertion of the toes,        or of the so-called 'leg.'    B. Bill, the distance from the feathers at the base of the bill      above to its tip.     NOTE. All measurements are in inches and tenths, and a       variation of about ten per cent. from the figures given may be       expected. The number before the name of each species is that of       the American Ornithologists' Union's 'Check-List of North       American"]]]
