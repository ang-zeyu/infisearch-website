We were divided by a great gulf of Aunties and Alberts and meat sandwiches.  The train was beginning to slow down. Signs of returning animation began to be noticeable among the sleepers. Aunty's eyes opened, stared vacantly round, closed, and reopened. The niece woke, and started instantly to attack a sausage roll. Albert and Ukridge slumbered on.  A whistle from the engine, and the train drew up at a station. Looking out, I saw that it was Yeovil. There was a general exodus. Aunty became instantly a thing of dash and electricity, collected parcels, shook Albert, replied to his thrusts with repartee, and finally heading a stampede out of the door.  The Irishman and his daughter also rose, and got out. I watched them leave stoically. It would have been too much to expect that they should be going any further.  \"Where are we?\" said Ukridge sleepily. \"Yeovil? Not far now. I tell you what it is, old horse, I could do with a drink.\"  With that remark he closed his eyes again, and returned to his slumbers. And, as he did so, my eye, roving discontentedly over the carriage, was caught by something lying in the far corner. It was \"The Manoeuvres of Arthur.\" The girl had left it behind.  I suppose what follows shows the vanity that obsesses young authors. It did not even present itself to me as a tenable theory that the book might have been left behind on purpose, as being of no further use to the owner. It only occurred to me that, if I did not act swiftly, the poor girl would suffer a loss beside which the loss of a purse or vanity-case were trivial.  Five seconds later I was on the platform.  \"Excuse me,\" I said, \"I think...?\"  \"Oh, thank you so much,\" said the girl.  I made my way back to the carriage, and lit my pipe in a glow of emotion.  \"They are blue,\" I said to my immortal soul. \"A wonderful, deep, soft, heavenly blue, like the sea at noonday.\"    CHAPTER IV  THE ARRIVAL  From Axminster to Combe Regis the line runs through country as attractive as any that can be found in the island, and the train, as if in appreciation of this fact, does not hurry over the journey. It was late afternoon by the time we reached our destination.  The arrangements for the carrying of luggage at Combe Regis border on the primitive. Boxes are left on the platform, and later, when he thinks of it, a carrier looks in and conveys them into the valley and up the hill on the opposite side to the address written on the labels. The owner walks. Combe Regis is not a place for the halt and maimed.  Ukridge led us in the direction of the farm, which lay across the valley, looking through woods to the sea. The place was visible from the station, from which, indeed, standing as it did on the top of a hill, the view was extensive.  Half-way up the slope on the other side of the valley we left the road and made our way across a spongy field, Ukridge explaining that this was a short cut. We climbed through a hedge, crossed a stream and another field, and after negotiating a difficult bank, topped with barbed wire, found ourselves in a garden.  Ukridge mopped his forehead, and restored his pince-nez to their original position from which the passage of the barbed wire had dislodged them.  \"This is the place,\" he said. \"We've come in by the back way. Saves time. Tired, Millie?\"  \"A little, dear. I should like some tea.\"  \"Same here,\" I agreed.  \"That'll be all right,\" said Ukridge. \"A most competent man of the name of Beale and his wife are in charge at present. I wrote to them telling them that we were coming to-day. They will be ready for us. That's the way to do things, Garny old horse. Quiet efficiency. Perfect organisation.\"  We were at the front door by this time. Ukridge rang the bell. The noise echoed through the house, but there was no answering footsteps. He rang again. There is no mistaking the note of a bell in an empty house. It was plain that the competent man and his wife were out.  \"Now what?\" I said.  Mrs. Ukridge looked at her husband with calm confidence.  \"This,\" said Ukridge, leaning against the door and endeavouring to button his collar at the back, \"reminds me of an afternoon in the Argentine. Two other cheery sportsmen and myself tried for three-quarters of an hour to get into an empty house where there looked as if there might be something to drink, and we'd just got the door open when the owner turned up from behind a tree with a shot-gun. It was a little difficult to explain. As a matter of fact, we never did what you might call really thresh the matter out thoroughly in all its aspects, and you'd be surprised what a devil of a time it takes to pick buck-shot out of a fellow. There was a dog, too.\"  He broke off, musing dreamily on the happy past, and at this moment history partially repeated itself. From the other side of the door came a dissatisfied whine, followed by a short bark.  \"Hullo,\" said Ukridge, \"Beale has a dog.\" He frowned, annoyed. \"What right,\" he added in an aggrieved tone, \"has a beastly mongrel, belonging to a man I employ, to keep me out of my own house? It's a little hard. Here am I, slaving day and night to support Beale, and when I try to get into my own house his infernal dog barks at me. Upon my Sam it's hard!\" He brooded for a moment on the injustice of things. \"Here, let me get to the keyhole. I'll reason with the brute.\"  He put his mouth to the keyhole and roared \"Goo' dog!\" through it. Instantly the door shook as some heavy object hurled itself against it. The barking rang through the house.  \"Come round to the back,\" said Ukridge, giving up the idea of conciliation, \"we'll get in through the kitchen window.\"  The kitchen window proved to be insecurely latched. Ukridge threw it open and we climbed in. The dog, hearing the noise, raced back along the passage and flung himself at the door, scratching at the panels. Ukridge listened with growing indignation.  \"Millie, you know how to light a fire. Garnet and I will be collecting cups and things. When that scoundrel Beale arrives I shall tear him limb from limb. Deserting us like this! The man must be a thorough fraud. He told me he was an old soldier. If that's the sort of discipline they used to keep in his regiment, thank God, we've got a Navy! Damn, I've broken a plate. How's the fire getting on, Millie? I'll chop Beale into little bits. What's that you've got there, Garny old horse? Tea? Good. Where's the bread? There goes another plate. Where's Mrs. Beale, too? By Jove, that woman wants killing as much as her blackguard of a husband. Whoever heard of a cook deliberately leaving her post on the day when her master and mistress were expected back? The abandoned woman. Look here, I'll give that dog three minutes, and if it doesn't stop scratching that door by then, I'll take a rolling pin and go out and have a heart-to-heart talk with it. It's a little hard. My own house, and the first thing I find when I arrive is somebody else's beastly dog scratching holes in the doors and ruining the expensive paint. Stop it, you brute!\"  The dog's reply was to continue his operations with immense vigour.  Ukridge's eyes gleamed behind their glasses.  \"Give me a good large jug, laddie,\" he said with ominous calm.  He took the largest of the jugs from the dresser and strode with it into the scullery, whence came a sound of running water. He returned carrying the jug with both hands, his mien that of a general who sees his way to a masterstroke of strategy.  \"Garny, old horse,\" he said, \"freeze onto the handle of the door, and, when I give the word, fling wide the gates. Then watch that animal get the surprise of a lifetime.\"  I attached myself to the handle as directed. Ukridge gave the word. We had a momentary vision of an excited dog of the mongrel class framed in the open doorway, all eyes and teeth; then the passage was occupied by a spreading pool, and indignant barks from the distance told that the enemy was thinking the thing over in some safe retreat.  \"Settled _his_ hash,\" said Ukridge complacently. \"Nothing like resource, Garny my boy. Some men would have gone on letting a good door be ruined.\"  \"And spoiled the dog for a ha'porth of water,\" I said.  At this moment Mrs. Ukridge announced that the kettle was boiling. Over a cup of tea Ukridge became the man of business.  \"I wonder when those fowls are going to arrive. They should have been here to-day. It's a little hard. Here am I, all eagerness and anxiety, waiting to start an up-to-date chicken farm, and no fowls! I can't run a chicken farm without fowls. If they don't come to-morrow, I shall get after those people with a hatchet. There must be no slackness. They must bustle about. After tea I'll show you the garden, and we'll choose a place for a fowl-run. To-morrow we must buckle to. Serious work will begin immediately after breakfast.\"  \"Suppose,\" I said, \"the fowls arrive before we're ready for them?\"  \"Why, then they must wait.\"  \"But you can't keep fowls cooped up indefinitely in a crate.\"  \"Oh, that'll be all right. There's a basement to this house. We'll let 'em run about there till we're ready for them. There's always a way of doing things if you look for it. Organisation, my boy. That's the watchword. Quiet efficiency.\"  \"I hope you are going to let the hens hatch some of the eggs, dear,\" said Mrs. Ukridge. \"I should love to have some little chickens.\"  \"Of course. By all means. My idea,\" said Ukridge, \"was this. These people will send us fifty fowls of sorts. That means--call it forty-five eggs a day. Let 'em ... Well, I'm hanged! There's that dog again. Where's the jug?\"  But this time an unforeseen interruption prevented the manoeuvre being the success it had been before. I had turned the handle and was about to pull the door open, while Ukridge, looking like some modern and dilapidated version of the _Discobolus_, stood beside me with his jug poised, when a voice spoke from the window.  \"Stand still!\" said the voice, \"or I'll corpse you!\"  I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3829"],["title","Love Among the Chickens (#4)"],["body","the handle. Ukridge dropped the jug. Mrs. Ukridge dropped her tea-cup. At the window, with a double-barrelled gun in his hands, stood a short, square, red-headed man. The muzzle of his gun, which rested on the sill, was pointing in a straight line at the third button of my waistcoat.  Ukridge emitted a roar like that of a hungry lion.  \"Beale! You scoundrelly, unprincipled, demon! What the devil are you doing with that gun? Why were you out? What have you been doing? Why did you shout like that? Look what you've made me do.\"  He pointed to the floor. The very old pair of tennis shoes which he wore were by this time generously soaked with the spilled water.  \"Lor, Mr. Ukridge, sir, is that you?\" said the red-headed man calmly. \"I thought you was burglars.\"  A short bark from the other side of the kitchen door, followed by a renewal of the scratching, drew Mr. Beale's attention to his faithful hound.  \"That's Bob,\" he said.  \"I don't know what you call the brute,\" said Ukridge. \"Come in and tie him up. And mind what you're doing with that gun. After you've finished with the dog, I should like a brief chat with you, laddie, if you can spare the time and have no other engagements.\"  Mr. Beale, having carefully deposited the gun against the wall and dropped a pair of very limp rabbits on the floor, proceeded to climb in through the window. This operation concluded, he stood to one side while the besieged garrison passed out by the same route.  \"You will find me in the garden,\" said Ukridge coldly. \"I've one or two little things to say to you.\"  Mr. Beale grinned affably. He seemed to be a man of equable temperament.  The cool air of the garden was grateful after the warmth of the kitchen. It was a pretty garden, or would have been if it had not been so neglected. I seemed to see myself sitting in a deck-chair on the lawn, smoking and looking through the trees at the harbour below. It was a spot, I felt, in which it would be an easy and a pleasant task to shape the plot of my novel. I was glad I had come. About now, outside my lodgings in town, a particularly foul barrel-organ would be settling down to work.  \"Oh, there you are, Beale,\" said Ukridge, as the servitor appeared. \"Now then, what have you to say?\"  The hired man looked thoughtful for a moment, then said that it was a fine evening.  \"Fine evening?\" shouted Ukridge. \"What on earth has that got to do with it? I want to know why you and Mrs. Beale were out when we arrived.\"  \"The missus went to Axminster, Mr. Ukridge, sir.\"  \"She had no right to go to Axminster. It isn't part of her duties to go gadding about to Axminster. I don't pay her enormous sums to go to Axminster. You knew I was coming this evening.\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"What!\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Beale,\" said Ukridge with studied calm, the strong man repressing himself. \"One of us two is a fool.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Let us sift this matter to the bottom. You got my letter?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"My letter saying that I should arrive to-day. You didn't get it?\"  \"No, sir.\"  \"Now, look here, Beale, this is absurd. I am certain that that letter was posted. I remember placing it in my pocket for that purpose. It is not there now. See. These are all the contents of my--well, I'm hanged.\"  He stood looking at the envelope which he had produced from his breast-pocket. A soft smile played over Mr. Beale's wooden face. He coughed.  \"Beale,\" said Ukridge, \"you--er--there seems to have been a mistake.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"You are not so much to blame as I thought.\"  \"No, sir.\"  There was a silence.  \"Anyhow,\" said Ukridge in inspired tones, \"I'll go and slay that infernal dog. I'll teach him to tear my door to pieces. Where's your gun, Beale?\"  But better counsels prevailed, and the proceedings closed with a cold but pleasant little dinner, at which the spared mongrel came out unexpectedly strong with ingenious and diverting tricks.    CHAPTER V  BUCKLING TO  Sunshine, streaming into my bedroom through the open window, woke me next day as distant clocks were striking eight. It was a lovely morning, cool and fresh. The grass of the lawn, wet with dew, sparkled in the sun. A thrush, who knew all about early birds and their perquisites, was filling in the time before the arrival of the worm with a song or two, as he sat in the bushes. In the ivy a colony of sparrows were opening the day with brisk scuffling. On the gravel in front of the house lay the mongrel, Bob, blinking lazily.  The gleam of the sea through the trees turned my thoughts to bathing. I dressed quickly and went out. Bob rose to meet me, waving an absurdly long tail. The hatchet was definitely buried now. That little matter of the jug of water was forgotten.  A walk of five minutes down the hill brought me, accompanied by Bob, to the sleepy little town. I passed through the narrow street, and turned on to the beach, walking in the direction of the combination of pier and break-water which loomed up through the faint mist.  The tide was high, and, leaving my clothes to the care of Bob, who treated them as a handy bed, I dived into twelve feet of clear, cold water. As I swam, I compared it with the morning tub of London, and felt that I had done well to come with Ukridge to this pleasant spot. Not that I could rely on unbroken calm during the whole of my visit. I knew nothing of chicken-farming, but I was certain that Ukridge knew less. There would be some strenuous moments before that farm became a profitable commercial speculation. At the thought of Ukridge toiling on a hot afternoon to manage an undisciplined mob of fowls, I laughed, and swallowed a generous mouthful of salt water; and, turning, swam back to Bob and my clothes.  On my return, I found Ukridge, in his shirt sleeves and minus a collar, assailing a large ham. Mrs. Ukridge, looking younger and more child-like than ever in brown holland, smiled at me over the tea-pot.  \"Hullo, old horse,\" bellowed Ukridge, \"where have you been? Bathing? Hope it's made you feel fit for work, because we've got to buckle to this morning.\"  \"The fowls have arrived, Mr. Garnet,\" said Mrs. Ukridge, opening her eyes till she looked like an astonished kitten. \"_Such_ a lot of them. They're making such a noise.\"  To support her statement there floated in through the window a cackling which for volume and variety beat anything I had ever heard. Judging from the noise, it seemed as if England had been drained of fowls and the entire tribe of them dumped into the yard of Ukridge's farm.  \"There seems to have been no stint,\" I said.  \"Quite a goodish few, aren't there?\" said Ukridge complacently. \"But that's what we want. No good starting on a small scale. The more you have, the bigger the profits.\"  \"What sorts have you got mostly?\" I asked, showing a professional interest.  \"Oh, all sorts. My theory, laddie, is this. It doesn't matter a bit what kind we get, because they'll all lay; and if we sell settings of eggs, which we will, we'll merely say it's an unfortunate accident if they turn out mixed when hatched. Bless you, people don't mind what breed a fowl is, so long as it's got two legs and a beak. These dealer chaps were so infernally particular. 'Any Dorkings?' they said. 'All right,' I said, 'bring on your Dorkings.' 'Or perhaps you will require a few Minorcas?' 'Very well,' I said, 'unleash the Minorcas.' They were going on--they'd have gone on for hours--but I stopped 'em. 'Look here, my dear old college chum,' I said kindly but firmly to the manager johnny--decent old buck, with the manners of a marquess,--'look here,' I said, 'life is short, and we're neither of us as young as we used to be. Don't let us waste the golden hours playing guessing games. I want fowls. You sell fowls. So give me some of all sorts. Mix 'em up, laddie,' I said, 'mix 'em up.' And he has, by jove. You go into the yard and look at 'em. Beale has turned them out of their crates. There must be one of every breed ever invented.\"  \"Where are you going to put them?\"  \"That spot we chose by the paddock. That's the place. Plenty of mud for them to scratch about in, and they can go into the field when they feel like it, and pick up worms, or whatever they feed on. We must rig them up some sort of shanty, I suppose, this morning. We'll go and tell 'em to send up some wire-netting and stuff from the town.\"  \"Then we shall want hen-coops. We shall have to make those.\"  \"Of course. So we shall. Millie, didn't I tell you that old Garnet was the man to think of things. I forgot the coops. We can't buy some, I suppose? On tick, of course.\"  \"Cheaper to make them. Suppose we get a lot of boxes. Sugar boxes are as good as any. It won't take long to knock up a few coops.\"  Ukridge thumped the table with enthusiasm, upsetting his cup.  \"Garny, old horse, you're a marvel. You think of everything. We'll buckle to right away, and get the whole place fixed up the same as mother makes it. What an infernal noise those birds are making. I suppose they don't feel at home in the yard. Wait till they see the A1 compact residential mansions we're going to put up for them. Finished breakfast? Then let's go out. Come along, Millie.\"  The red-headed Beale, discovered leaning in an attitude of thought on the yard gate and observing the feathered mob below with much interest, was roused from his reflections and despatched to the town for the wire and sugar boxes. Ukridge, taking his place at the gate, gazed at the fowls with the affectionate air of a proprietor.  \"Well, they have certainly taken you at your word,\" I said, \"as far as variety is concerned.\"  The man with the manners of a marquess seemed to have been at great pains to send a really representative selection of fowls. There were blue ones, black ones, white, grey, yellow, brown, big, little, Dorkings, Minorcas, Cochin Chinas, Bantams, Wyandottes. It was an imposing spectacle.  The Hired Man returned towards the end of the morning, preceded by a cart containing the necessary wire and boxes; and Ukridge, whose enthusiasm brooked"]]]
