At that time the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala had an air strip and camp at Chinajá, from which place the company was constructing a road northward through the forest. In mid-February, 1960, J. Knox Jones, Jr. and I flew into El Petén to collect and study mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. While enjoying the comforts of the fine field camp at Chinajá, we worked in the surrounding forest and availed ourselves of the opportunity to be on hand when the road crews were cutting the tall trees in the forest, thereby bringing to the ground many interesting specimens of the arboreal fauna. We stayed at Chinajá until late March, with the exception of a week spent at Toocog, another camp of the Ohio Oil Company located 15 kilometers southeast of La Libertad and on the edge of the savanna. Thus, at Toocog we were able to work both in the forest and on the savanna. In the summer of 1960, John Wellman accompanied me to El Petén for two weeks in June and July. Most of our time was spent at Chinajá, but a few days were spent at Toocog and other localities in south-central El Petén.  Many areas in Guatemala have been studied intensively by L. C. Stuart, who has published on the herpetofauna of the forested area of northeastern El Petén (1958), the savannas of central El Petén (1935), and the humid mountainous region to the south of El Petén in Alta Verapaz (1948 and 1950). The area studied by me and my companions is covered with rainforest and lies to the north of the highlands of Alta Verapaz and to the south of the savannas of central El Petén. A few specimens of amphibians and reptiles were obtained in this area in 1935 by C. L. Hubbs and Henry van der Schalie; this collection, reported on by Stuart (1937), contained only one species, _Cochranella fleischmanni_, not present in our collection of 77 species and 617 specimens.   Acknowledgments  I am grateful to L. C. Stuart of the University of Michigan, who made the initial arrangements for our work in El Petén, aided me in the identification of certain specimens, and helped in the preparation of this report. J. Knox Jones, Jr. and John Wellman were able field companions, who added greatly to the number of specimens in the collection. In Guatemala, Clark M. Shimeall and Harold Hoopman of the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala made available to us the facilities of the company's camps at Chinajá and Toocog. Alberto Alcain and Luis Escaler welcomed us at Chinajá and gave us every possible assistance. Juan Monteras and Antonio Aldaña made our stay at Toocog enjoyable and profitable. During our visits to southern El Petén, Julio Bolón C. worked for us as a collector, and between March and June he collected and saved many valuable specimens; his knowledge of the forest and its inhabitants was a great asset to our work. Jorge A. Ibarra, Director of the Museo Nacional de Historia Natural in Guatemala assisted us in obtaining necessary permits and extended other kindnesses. To all of these people I am indebted for the essential parts that they played in the completion of this study.  Field work in the winter of 1960 was made possible by funds from the American Heart Association for the purposes of collecting mammalian hearts. My field work in the summer of 1960 was supported by a grant from the Graduate Research Fund of the University of Kansas.     DESCRIPTION OF THE AREA   A vast lowland region stretches northward for approximately 700 kilometers from the highlands of Guatemala to the Gulf of Mexico. The northern two-thirds of this low plain is bordered on three sides by seas and forms the Yucatán Peninsula. The lowlands at the base of the Yucatán Peninsula make up the Departamento El Petén of Guatemala. The area with which this report is concerned consists of the south-central part of El Petén.   Physiography  Immediately south of Chinajá is a range of hills, the Serrania de Chinajá, having an almost due east-west axis and a crest of about 600 meters above sea level. South of the Serrania de Chinajá are succeedingly higher ridges building up to the Meseta de Cobán and Sierra de Pocolha and eventually to the main Guatemalan highlands. The northern face of the Serrania de Chinajá is a fault scarp dropping abruptly from about 650 meters at the crest to about 140 meters at the base. From the base of the Serrania de Chinajá northward to the Río de la Pasión at Sayaxché the terrain is gently rolling and has a total relief of about 50 meters. North of the Río de la Pasión is a low dome reaching an elevation of 170 meters at La Libertad; see Stuart (1935:12) for further discussion of the physiography of central El Petén. The rocks in southern El Petén are predominately Miocene marine limestones; there are occasional pockets of Pliocene deposits. There is little evidence of subterranean solution at Chinajá, but northward in central El Petén karsting is common. The upper few inches of soil is humus rich in organic matter; below this is clay.   Climate  The climate of El Petén is tropical with equable temperatures throughout the year. Temperatures at Chinajá varied between a night-time low of 65° F. and a daytime high of 91° F. during the time of our visits. In the Köppen system of classification the climate at Chinajá and Toocog is Af. Rain falls throughout the year, but there is a noticeable dry season. To anyone who has traveled from south to north in El Petén and the Yucatán Peninsula, it is obvious from the changes in vegetation that there is a decrease in rainfall from south to north. There is a noticeable difference between Chinajá and Toocog. Although rainfall data are not available for Chinajá and Toocog, there are records for nearby stations (Sapper, 1932). At Paso Caballos on the Río San Pedro about 40 kilometers northwest of Toocog the average annual rainfall amounts to 1620 mm.; the driest month is March (21 mm.), and the wettest months are June (269 mm.) and September (265 mm.). At Cubilquitz, Alta Verapaz, about 35 kilometers south-southwest of Chinajá and at an elevation of 300 meters, the average annual rainfall is 4006 mm.; the driest month is March (128 mm.), and the wettest months are July (488 mm.) and October (634 mm.).  During the 18 days in February and March, 1960, that we kept records on the weather at Chinajá moderate to heavy showers occurred on seven days. During our stay there in June and July rain fell every day, as it did in Toocog. However, during the week spent at Toocog in March no rain fell.   Vegetation  The vegetation of northern and central El Petén has been studied by Lundell (1937), who made only passing remarks concerning the plants of the southern part of El Petén. No floristic studies have been made there. The following remarks are necessarily brief and are intended only to give the reader a general picture of the forest. I have included names of a few of the commoner trees that I recognized.  Chinajá is located in a vast expanse of unbroken rainforest. In this forest there is a noticeable stratification of the vegetation. Three strata are apparent; in the uppermost layer the tops of the trees are from 40 to 50 meters above the ground. The spreading crowns of the trees and the interlacing vines form a nearly continuous canopy over the lower layers. Among the common trees in the upper stratum are _Calophyllum brasiliense_, _Castilla elastica_, _Cedrela mexicana_, _Ceiba pentandra_, _Didalium guianense_, _Ficus_ sp., _Sideroxylon lundelli_, _Swietenia macrophylla_, and _Vitex_ sp. (Pl. 1, fig. 1). The middle layer of trees have crowns about 25 meters above the ground; these trees in some places where the upper canopy is missing form the tallest trees in the forest. This is especially true on steep hillsides. Common trees in the middle layer include _Achras zapote_, _Bombax ellipticum_,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38398"],["title","Amphibians and Reptiles of the Rainforests of Southern El Petén, Guatemala (#1)"],["body"," mexicana_, _Orbignya cohune_, and _Sabal_ sp. The lowermost layer reaches a height of about 10 meters; in many places in the forest this layer is absent. Common trees in the lower stratum include _Crysophila argentea_, _Cymbopetalum penduliflorum_, _Casearia_ sp., and _Hasseltia dioica_.  The ground cover is sparce; apparently only a few small herbs and ferns live on the heavily shaded forest floor. Important herpetological habitats include the leaf litter, rotting stumps, and rotting tree trunks on the forest floor and the buttresses of many of the gigantic trees, especially _Ceiba pentandra_ (Pl. 2). Epiphytes, especially various kinds of bromeliads, are common. Most frequently these are in the trees in the upper and middle strata.  At Toocog there is sharp break between savanna and forest (Pl. 7, fig. 2). The forest is noticeably drier and more open than at Chinajá (Pl. 9). The crowns of the trees are lower, and there is no nearly continuous canopy between 40 and 50 meters above the ground. Although _Swietenia macrophylla_ and other large trees occur, they are less common than at Chinajá. Especially common at Toocog are _Achras zapote_, _Brosimum alicastrum_, and various species of _Ficus_.     GAZETTEER   The localities from which specimens were obtained are cited below and shown on the accompanying map (Fig. 1).  [Illustration: FIG. 1. Map of El Petén, Guatemala, showing localities mentioned in text.]        Chinajá.--Lat. 16° 02´, long. 90° 13´, elev. 140 m. Camp of       the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala and formerly a small       settlement. On some maps Chinajá is located just to the north       of the Alta Verapaz--El Petén boundary; recent surveys place       the location just to the south of the imaginary line through       the rainforest. Field work was conducted in the immediate       vicinity of the camp, on the lower slopes of the Serrania de       Chinajá, and at several sites to the northwest and       north-northwest of Chinajá, where the forest was being       cleared. The entire area supports rainforest.        La Libertad.--Lat. 16° 47´, long. 90° 07´, elev., 170 m. A       town on the savannas in central El Petén; although we       collected there in the rainy season, the specimens obtained on       the savannas are not included in this report.        Paso Subín.--Lat. 16° 38´, long. 90° 12´, elev. 90 m. A small       settlement on the Río Subín, a tributary of the Río de la       Pasión. Specimens were obtained in rainforest in the immediate       vicinity of the settlement.        Río de la Pasión.--A large river flowing northward through       southern El Petén and thence westward into the Río Usumacinta.       Specimens were obtained along the river between the Río Subín       and Sayaxché.        Río San Román.--A river flowing northward in south-central El       Petén to the Río Salinas (Usumacinta). We collected along the       river at a place about 16 kilometers north-northwest of       Chinajá, approximately at Lat. 16° 10´, long. 90° 17´, elev.       110 m. In the dry season the river was clear; it is surrounded       by rainforest.        Sayaxché.--Lat. 16° 31´, long. 90° 09´, elev. 80 m. A town on       the southern bank of the Río de la Pasión. Specimens were       obtained in the rainforest and in cleared areas in the       immediate vicinity of the town.        Toocog (formerly Sojío).--Lat. 16° 41´, long. 90° 02´, elev.       140 m. A camp of the Ohio Oil Company of Guatemala located at       the rainforest-savanna edge, 15 kilometers southeast of La       Libertad. Although we collected on the savannas as well as in       the forest, especially to the east of the camp, only species       obtained in the forest are considered in this report.     THE HERPETOFAUNA OF THE RAINFOREST   In presenting an account of the herpetofauna of southern El Petén three items need to be considered: (1) The composition of the fauna; (2) the ecology of the fauna; (3) the relationships of the fauna. Each of these topics is discussed briefly below. Logically a discussion of the origin of the fauna should follow, but this is being withheld for inclusion in a report on the herpetofauna of the entire El Petén by L. C. Stuart and the author; at that time the above topics will be expanded to cover the herpetofauna of the whole region.

Another 13 species probably occur in southern El Petén (see Hypothetical List of Species). The fauna primarily is composed of typical humid lowland forest inhabitants, such as:    _Hyla ebraccata_   _Hyla loquax_   _Phyllomedusa callidryas taylori_   _Smilisca phaeota cyanosticta_   _Anolis biporcatus_   _Anolis capito_   _Anolis humilis uniformis_   _Eumeces sumichrasti_   _Ameiva festiva edwardsi_   _Imantodes cenchoa leucomelas_   _Leptophis ahaetulla praestans_   _Xenodon rabdocephalus mexicanus_   _Bothrops nasutus_   _Bothrops schlegeli schlegeli_  Nevertheless, the region also provides at least a limited amount of habitat suitable for some species that are more frequently found in open forest of a drier nature; such species include:    _Hyla microcephala martini_   _Hyla staufferi_   _Hypopachus cuneus nigroreticulatus_   _Anolis sericeus sericeus_   _Eumeces schwartzei_   _Oxybelis aeneus aeneus_  Because of the absence of sufficiently open habitat or owing to the presence of competitors, some conspicuous members of sub-humid forests are not present in southern El Petén. Conspicuous absentees are the following:    _Rhinophrynus dorsalis_   _Phrynohyas spilomma_   _Triprion petasatus_   _Anolis tropidonotus_   _Ctenosaura similis_   _Ameiva undulata_   _Cnemidophorus angusticeps_   _Conophis lineatus_   _Masticophis mentovarius mentovarius_  PLATE 7  [Illustration: FIG. 1.

Rain pond in forest at Toocog. This was a breeding site for six species of frogs.]   Ecology of the Herpetofauna  Our two visits to Chinajá and Toocog afforded the opportunity to gather data on the ecology of the rainforests of southern El Petén and to study the relationships between the environment and members of the herpetofauna. Tropical rainforests present the optimum conditions for life, and it is in this environment that life reaches its greatest diversity. Here, too, biological inter-relationships are most complex. This complexity is illustrated by the presence of many species of some genera, all of which are found together in the same geographic region. In the rainforests of southern El Petén there are six species of _Anolis_, five of _Hyla_, four of _Bothrops_, and three of _Coniophanes_. Obviously, the diversity of ecological niches in the rainforest is sufficient to support a variety of related species. Of the examples mentioned above, fairly adequate ecological data were obtained for most of the species of _Anolis_, which will be used to show the ecological diversity and vertical stratification of sympatric species in the rainforests.  Of the six species of _Anolis_, all except _A. sericeus_ are typically found in humid forests. _Anolis sericeus sericeus_ is poorly represented in the collections from southern El Petén, where it may be in competition with _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_ that resembles _Anolis s. sericeus_ in size, coloration, and habits. Therefore, _Anolis sericeus sericeus_ is excluded from the following discussion. The common terrestrial species is _Anolis humilis uniformis_; sometimes this small species perches or suns on the bases of small trees or buttresses of some large trees. When disturbed it takes to the ground and seeks cover in the leaf litter or beneath logs or palm fronds. _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ is about twice the size of _Anolis humilis uniformis_ and is usually observed on buttresses of large trees or on the lower two meters of tree trunks. Individuals were seen foraging on the ground along with _Anolis humilis uniformis_. At no time were _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ observed to ascend the trunks of large trees; they always took refuge near the bases of trees. _Anolis limifrons rodriguezi_ is found on the stems and branches of bushes. It is a small species that sometimes is observed on the ground but was never seen ascending large trees. _Anolis capito_ is about the same size as _Anolis lemurinus bourgeaei_ and lives on the trunks of large trees. In the tops of the trees lives a large green species, _Anolis biporcatus_.  Similar segregation habitatwise can be demonstrated for other members of the"]]]
