We stopped near the Cape St. Vinconet to make further provisions for the voyage.      [A] The number was larger, about 270.  \"We went to hear mass on shore. There the Captain commanded that all the men should confess before going any further.  \"On Tuesday, September 20th, we set sail from St. Lucar.  \"We came to Canaria (Canaries).\"  This account repeats in a different way a part of the facts we have given.  Here the young Italian relates his first story, which is substantially as follows:   THE FOUNTAIN TREE.  \"Among the isles of the Canaria there is one which is very wonderful. There is not to be found a single drop of water which flows from any fountain or river.  \"But in this rainless land at the hour of midday, every day, there descends a cloud from the sky which envelops a large tree which grows on this island.  \"The cloud falls upon the leaves of the tree, when a great abundance of water distills from the leaves. The tree flows, and soon at the foot of it there gathers a fountain.  \"The people of the island come to drink of the water. The animals and the birds refresh themselves there.\"  The story is true so far as relates to the fountain tree. But that a cloud comes down from Heaven at midday to refresh it, is not an exact statement of the manner in which this tree furnishes water to the sterile island. The young Italian writer describes the tree as he saw it, and as it seemed to be. The tree that supplies water as from a natural fountain may still be found.  With such a tree to begin his researches on the sea, Pigafetta must have been impatient to proceed along the marvelous ocean way. All the world was to him as he saw it; he seldom stopped to inquire if appearances were true.  With men like Del Cano on board, who had ears for a marvelous story, his life in the early part of the voyage must have been a very happy one. Wonder followed wonder....  \"Monday, the 3d of October,\" says the interesting Italian, \"we set sail making the course auster, which the Levantine mariners call siroc (southeast) entering into the ocean sea. We passed Cape Verde and navigated by the coast of Guinea of Ethiopia, where there is a mountain called Sierra Leona. A rain fell, and the storm lasted sixty days.\"  They came to waters full of sharks, which had terrible teeth, and which ate all the people whom they found in the sea, alive or dead. These were caught by a hook of iron.   ST. ELMO'S FIRE.  Here good St. Anseline met the ships; in the fancy of the mariners of the time, this airy saint appeared to favored ships in the night, and fair weather always followed the saintly apparition. He came in a robe of fire, and stood and shone on the top of the high masts or on the spars. The sailors hailed him with joy, as one sent from Heaven. Happy was the ship on the tropic sea upon whose rigging the form of good St. Anseline appeared in the night, and especially in the night of cloud and storm!  To the joy of all the ships good St. Anseline came down one night to the fleet of Magellan. The poetical Italian tells the story in this way:  \"During these storms, the body of St. Anseline appeared to us several times.  \"One night among others he came when it was very dark on account of bad weather. He came in the form of a fire lighted at the summit of the main mast, and remained there near two hours and a half.  \"This comforted us greatly, for we were in tears, looking for the hour when we should perish.  \"When the holy light was going away from us it shed forth so great a brilliancy in our eyes that we were like people blinded for near a quarter of an hour. We called out for mercy.  \"Nobody expected to escape from the storm.  \"It is to be noted that all and as many times as the light which represents St. Anseline shows itself upon a vessel which is in a storm at sea, that vessel never is lost.  \"As soon as this light had departed the sea grew calmer and the wings of divers kinds of birds appeared.\"  Beneficent St. Anseline who manifested his presence by illuminations in the mast and spars in equatorial waters! The beautiful illusion has long been explained and dispelled. It is but an electric fire at the end of atmospheric disturbances. But it is usually a correct prophecy of fair skies and smooth seas. It is now called St. Elmo's Fire.  If ever there was an expedition that the saint of the mariners might favor it would seem to be this.  One can almost envy the pious Italian his imagination in the clearing tropic night.  His next wonders were the sea birds, of which there were flocks and clouds, and with them appeared flying fish.  The ships were now off the coasts of Brazil and stopped at Verzim.  The people of the Brazilian Verzim were accustomed to paint themselves \"by fire.\" We do not clearly understand how this painting \"by fire\" was done. The art of scorching has perished with them. But besides these indelible marks, the men had three holes in their lower lips, and hung in them, after the manner of earrings, small round ornamental stones, about a finger in length. The men did not shave, for they _plucked out_ their beard.  Their only clothing was a circle of parrot feathers. How _terribly_ gay they must have looked! And yet such customs were hardly more ridiculous than those of later times, and more civilized countries--earrings, beauty patches, plume, and snuffboxes.  It was the land of parrots. The most beautiful and intelligent parrots still come from Brazil. Columbus saw parrots in \"clouds\" over the islands of the Antilles.  Parrots were not expensive in these equatorial forests at this time. \"The natives,\" says Pigafetta, \"give eight or ten parrots for a looking glass,\" and as a looking glass would multiply the picture of parrots indefinitely the Verzimans must have thought the exchange a marvelous bargain.  If Brazilian parrots were cheap and so charming as likely to become an embarrassment of riches, so were the little cat monkeys which delighted the men. These little creatures, which looked like miniature lions, still delight the visitors to the coast of Brazil, but they shiver up when brought to the northern atmospheres and piteously cry for the home lands of the sun again.  Very curious birds began to excite the surprise of the voyagers, among such as had a \"beak like a spoon,\" and \"no tongue.\"  The markets of the new land displayed another commodity far more surprising than birds or animals, young slaves, which were offered for sale by their own families. So a family who had many children was rich. It cost a hatchet to buy one of these, and for a hatchet and a knife one might buy _two_.  The people made bread of the \"marrow of trees,\" and carried victuals in baskets on their heads.  Masses were said for the crews on shore, and the natives knelt down with the men.  The people were so pleased with their visitors that they built a common house for them.  A pleasing illusion had made the sailors most welcome here.  It had not rained in Verzim for two months when the expedition landed. The people were looking to the heavens for mercy day by day. But the copper sun rose as often in a clear sky.  At last Magellan's sails appeared in the burning air. The sight of the sails was followed by that of clouds.  The people thought that the fleet had brought the clouds with them.  \"They come from Heaven,\" said they of the adventurers.  So when they were exhorted to accept Christianity, they at once fell down before the uplifted crosses and believed the teachings of the sea heroes who could command the clouds and bring rain to the parched land.  They thought the ships were gods and the small boats the children of such beings, and when the latter approached the ships they imagined that they were children come home to their fathers or mothers.  The ships remained in this delightful country of Verzim thirteen weeks. Pigafetta and Del Cano must have thought that life here was ideal. What scenes would follow?     CHAPTER IX.  PINEAPPLES, POTATOES, VERY OLD PEOPLE.   Other things were there on the wonderful Brazilian coast. There the mariners traded in them and were refreshed with a delicious fruit, called pique--pineapples.  They came to the knowledge here of a nutritious ground fruit called battate. \"This,\" says our Italian, \"has the taste of a chestnut and is the length of a shuttle.\" These ground fruits were potatoes.  The people here seem to have been very liberal in trading.  They would give six fowls for a knife--well they might do so, as they used stone implements.  They gave _two_ geese for a comb--here they were both generous and wise.  They gave as great a quantity of fish as ten men could eat for a pair of scissors.  And for a bell, they gave a whole basket full of potatoes (battate).  Marvelous indeed as was this same country of Verzim, it also abounded in the conditions and atmospheres of long life.  \"Some of these people,\" says our Italian chronicler, \"live to be a hundred or a hundred and twenty, or a hundred and forty or more. They wear little clothing.\"  Which speaks well for pineapples, potatoes, and easy dress.  \"They sleep on cotton nets, which are fastened on large timbers, and stretch from one end of the house to another.\"  It is good to sleep in ample ventilation. We do not wonder that many of the people passed a hundred years.  The boats of these people were as simple as their open houses.  \"These are not made with iron instruments, for there are none, but with stones.\"  The canoes were dug out of one long tree--some giant growth of the forest which would convey from thirty to forty men. The paddles for these canoes resembled shovels. The rowers were usually black men.  The people ate human flesh, but only at feasts of triumph. They then served up their enemies.  Pigafetta draws the following grewsome picture:  \"They do not eat up the whole body of a man whom they take prisoner; they eat him bit by bit, and for fear that he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],["title","The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#8)"],["body","be spoiled, they cut him up into pieces, which they set to dry before the chimney. They eat this day by day, so as to keep in mind the memory of their enemy.\"  This was indeed the sweet food of revenge, and as barbarous as it seems, the spirit of revenge secretly cherished is hardly less unworthy when it finds expression in words that are bitter, if not carnal.  The region abounded with bright birds, yet with all these delights, and pineapples and potatoes, there fell great rains. So there were shadows in the sunlands.  We can fancy Pigafetta relating his discoveries on the shore to a susceptible spirit, like Del Cano, and writing an account of them day by day in his immortal journal.  These strange adventures by sea and on land which so greatly interested the Italian Knight Pigafetta, our historian, do not seem to have greatly impressed the mind of Magellan. The lands had been sighted before. His whole soul was bent on one purpose--not on rediscovery, but on discovery. He was sailing now where other keels had been. It was his purpose to find new ways for the world to follow over unknown seas. His heart could find no full satisfaction but in water courses that sails had never swept; a new way to the Moluccas that no ship had ever broken.  Notwithstanding the friendly spirit and liberal patronage of the Emperor, he still stood against the world. He represented a cast-out name. His own countrymen, on his own ships in the long delays on the voyage to unknown seas, were plotting against him.  Let us recall in fancy a night scene as the ships lay on the waters of the meridional world. Magellan sits alone in one of the castles of the ship and looks out on the phosphorescent sea. The stars above him shine in a clear splendor, and are reflected in the sea. The sky seems to be in the waters; the waters are a mirror of the sky. Among the clear stars the Southern Cross, always vivid, here rises high. Magellan lifts to it his eye, and feels the religious inspiration of the suggestion. He is a son of the Church, and he holds that all discoveries are to be made for the glory of the Cross.  On the distant shores palms rise in armies in the dusky air. The shores are silent. When arose the tall people that inhabited them?  Magellan dreams: he wonders at himself, at his inward commission; at his cast-out name and great opportunity.  One of his trusty friends comes to him; he is a Spaniard and his disquieting words break the serenity of the scene.  \"Captain General, it hurts my soul to say it, but there is disloyalty on the ships--it is everywhere.\"  \"I seem to feel the atmospheres of it,\" said Magellan. \"Why should it be? The sea and the sky promise us success. Who are disloyal?\"  \"Captain General, they are your own countrymen!\"  \"And why do they plot treason under the Cross of discovery?\"  \"Captain General, if the ocean open new ways before you, and you should achieve all of which you dream, they will have little share in the glory; you are facing stormy waters and perils unknown, not for Portugal, but for Spain.\"  \"Not for Spain alone, nor for Portugal, but for the glory of the Cross, and the good of all the world. A divine will leads me, and sustains me, and directs me. I am not seeking gold or fame or any personal advantage; my soul goes forth to reveal the wonders and the benevolence of Providence to the heart of the whole world. I go alone, and feel the loneliness of my lot. I left all that I had to make this expedition. It is my purpose to discover unknown seas. Joy, rapture, and recompense would come to me, beyond wealth or fame, could my eyes be the first to see a new ocean world, and to carry back the knowledge of it to all nations. What happiness would it be to me to ride on uncharted tides! My friend, you are loyal to me?\"  \"Captain General, I am loyal, and the Spanish sailors are loyal; it is your own men who plot in dark corners to bring your plans to naught.\"  In the shadow of one of the tall castles of another ship sit a band of idle men. They are Portuguese.  One of them, who seems to lead the minds of the others, is whittling, and after a long silence says:  \"We do not know where we are going, and wherever we are going, we are Portuguese and are slaves to Spain.\"  \"Ay, ay,\" returned an old Portuguese sailor, \"and when we go back again, should that ever be, the profit to us will be little at the India House.\"  \"Right,\" answered a number of voices, and one ventured to say:  \"Magellan, after all, may be mad, like his old companion, the astronomer. Both came from the same place in Portugal.\"  Some of the officers had schemes of their own.  But the ships crept on and on, along the Brazilian coast, where the flag of Spain and the farol guided them in the track of the Admiral they followed. Night after night the lantern of the flagship gleamed in the air, moving toward cooler waters under the Southern Cross.  And in Magellan's heart was a single purpose, and he anticipated the joy of a great discovery, as a revelation that would answer the prophetic light that shone like a star in his own spiritual vision. On, and on!     CHAPTER X.  THE FIRST GIANT.--THE ISLANDS OF GEESE AND GOSLINGS.--THE DANCING GIANTS.   The narrative of Pigafetta, the Knight of Rhodes, has much curious lore in regard to giants. At a place on the coast, formerly called Cape St. Mary, the first of these giants appeared.  He was a leader of a tribe \"who ate human flesh.\" The lively Knight of Rhodes informs us that this man, who towered above his fellows, \"had a voice like a bull.\"  He came to one of the captains' ships and asked--of course in sign language; for a man may have a \"voice like a bull\" and yet fail to be understood in cannibal tongues--if he might come on board the ship and bring his fellows with him.  He left a quantity of goods on the shore. While he was negotiating at the ships, his people on the shore, who seem to have been unusually wise and prudent, began to remove the stores of goods from exposure to danger to a kind of castle at some distance.  The officers of the ships grew inpatient when they saw the tempting goods being thus removed. So they landed a hundred men to recover the goods, which they seemed to have deemed theirs after the \"right of discovery.\"  The men began to run after the provident natives, when they became greatly surprised. The natives seemed to _fly_ over the ground, and leave them behind at a humiliating distance.  \"They did more in one step than we could do at a bound,\" says Pigafetta, Knight of Rhodes.  The giant people here showed that there was need to approach them with caution. Some time before, these \"Canibali\" had captured a Spanish sea captain and sixty men, who had landed and pastured inland to make discoveries. They ate them all--a fearful feast!  Our voyagers probably had no desire to go too far inland in view of such a warning; so they returned and proceeded on their course toward the antarctic pole.  They discovered two small islands, which had more agreeable inhabitants than the land of Cape St. Mary. \"These islands,\" says our good Knight Pigafetta, \"were full of geese and goslings and sea wolves.\" He adds: \"We loaded five ships with them for an hour.\"  The Knight has also left us the following curious picture of the birds, which must have been very much surprised at being so rudely disturbed:  \"The geese are black, and have feathers all over the body of the same size and shape; and they do not fly but live on fish, and they were so fat that we did not pluck them, but skinned them. They have beaks like that of a crow.  \"The sea wolves of these islands are of many colors and of the size and thickness of a calf, and have a head like a calf, and ears small and round. They have teeth but no legs, but feet joining close to the body, which resemble a human hand. They have small nails to their feet, and skin between the fingers like geese.  \"If these animals could run they would be very bad and cruel, but they do not stir from the waters, and swim and live upon fish.\"  This seems to be a very admirable description of a sea wolf, O Knight of Rhodes!  A great storm came down upon the ships here. But, marvelous to relate, the fiery body of good St. Anselmo or Anseline \"appeared to us, and immediately the storm ceased.\"  The fleet sailed away again and came to Port St. Julian, the true land of the giants, of which place our Knight has some very interesting stories to tell.  [Illustration: The world according to the Ptolemy of 1548.]  The fleet entered the Port of St. Julian. It was winter, and for a long time no human beings appeared.  Suddenly one day a most extraordinary sight met the eyes of some of the adventurers. Our Knight's description of this being is very vivid. He says:  \"One day, without any one's expecting it, we saw a giant who was on the shore of the sea, quite naked, and was dancing and leaping and singing, and, while singing, he put sand and dust on his head.\" The Captain of one of the ships, who first saw this extraordinary creature, said to one of the sailors:  \"Go and meet him. He dances and sings as a sign of friendship. You must do the same. Beckon him to me.\"  The Captain himself was on a little island.  The scene that followed must have been comical indeed.  The giant danced and sung and sprinkled his head with sand. The sailor did the same, danced and sang, and the two approached each other.  So the giant was made to think that he was among friends. The sailor led him on to the island, where he met the Captain.  But the lively giant now began to be afraid in the presence of a new people. He seemed to wish to ask them who they were and whence they came. Then an answer to this question came to him. He looked up to the sky and pointed upward with one finger, saying by signs:  \"Did you come down from Heaven?\"  \"He was so tall,\" says our descriptive Knight, \"that the tallest of us only came up to his waist.\" He was probably hardly taller than many of his race.
