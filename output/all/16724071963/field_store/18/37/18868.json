Over the bridge, at the north end of the town, is another large church, and several others, small and mean in their outward appearance and inside decorations. I was informed that most of these churches were well endowed before the revolution, and the religious houses were amply provided for, as is the case in all parts of the new world where the Roman Catholic religion is professed.  At the northern extremity of St. Pierre is a spacious handsome house, with good offices, stables, and gardens, which formerly belonged to the Jesuits, in whose district the town and surrounding country is situated. The Capuchins and Dominicans had the two other parts of the island.--The government-house, which on our taking it was inhabited by Au Cane, the mayor, is conveniently situated near the centre of the town, and was formed for the residence of the chief magistrate or governor of the island. The rooms are large and lofty, and there is a good garden at the back of the house, in which, amongst a variety of fruit trees, was a fine bread-fruit tree: how it came there, I could not learn, unless some French ships had paid a visit to the islands in the South Sea, for the same purpose that our ships of late have made that voyage; but then I think more of the trees would have been seen in this and the neighbouring French islands.--Towards the southern end of the town is a large and commodious hospital, which had good revenues attached to it, and was well regulated and attended. This we found of infinite use for our sick and wounded, who were far better provided for here than they could be in the hospital ships, or with the army.     CHAPTER VI.       THE ENEMY RETIRE INTO FORT BOURBON AND FORT LOUIS ... THE ADMIRAL      ATTACKS FORT LOUIS WITH THE BOMB-KETCH AND GUN-BOATS ... CAMP OF      SEAMEN FORMED AT POINT NEGRO ... A WHARF BUILT IN THE CUL DE SAC DE      COHEE, STORES AND AMMUNITION LANDED THERE ... GENERAL BELLGARDE      ATTEMPTS TO CUT OFF THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE ARMY AND NAVY,      BUT IS BEATEN, AND HIS CAMP ON SOURIER TAKEN ... HEAD-QUARTERS      ESTABLISHED ON SOURIER ... GENERAL ROCHAMBEAU SENDS AN AID DE CAMP      TO THE COMMANDERS IN CHIEF ... THE NAVY MAKE A ROAD, AND DRAG THE      GUNS TO THE HEIGHTS OF SOURIER.   St. Pierre being now captured[15], the enemy's strength was concentrated in one point at Forts Louis and Bourbon: the latter is a work of late date, being built under the directions of the present Marquis de Bouillé, and is a well planned as well as strongly situated fortification; but in this mountainous country it is hardly possible to find any spot that may not be commanded by some neighbouring height, unless on the tops of the mountains, where it would be difficult to procure water and provisions sufficient for the subsistence of an army during a siege of any length. The town of Fort Royal is situated on a flat and swampy ground, at the foot of the hill on which is Fort Bourbon; and Fort Louis, the ancient strong-hold of this island, is on a neck of land running into the sea, and forms one side of the Carénage, an excellent harbour for shipping of all kinds.--The Admiral, from the day he anchored in Fort Royal Bay, began a heavy cannonade on Fort Louis. The Vesuvius bomb, commanded by Captain Sawyer, and under the direction of Captain Suckling of the artillery, threw shells into the fort from an eighteen-inch and twelve-inch mortar with great effect; and as soon as the evening shut in, the gun-boats, attended by several row-boats from the ships in the fleet (to assist in case of their being sunk by the enemy's shot) moved towards the mouth of the Carénage, and commenced a brisk fire on the fort, which was generally returned with equal spirit; but, from the smallness of the object, and frequently shifting their situation, they were less often hit than could have been expected, considering that they constantly were within the range of grape-shot, which fell in showers round them. Towards day-break they returned to their respective ships.--In the night of February 15th, the second and third companies of seamen, under the command of Lieutenants Miln and Ogle, left the Boyne; and, with other seamen from the fleet, the whole under command of Captain Rogers of the Quebec, landed at Cas Navire, and (occupying the posts that the troops under Colonel Myers had that day quitted, to assist in the attack on St. Pierre) formed a camp near Point Negro.--Our shipping having now, by the capture of Pigeon Island, free ingress to Fort Royal bay, most of the transports and store-ships, under convoy of his majesty's ships Santa Margarita, Solebay, Nautilus, &c. got up into the Cul de sac de Cohée, an harbour at the north-east end of the bay, from whence they had a communication with the army under Sir Charles Grey, and where they built a wharf to land provisions and stores; and a chain of posts was established from thence to the heights of Bruno, on which duty the fifteenth and twentieth regiments were employed.--On February 18th in the morning, General Bellgarde moved with nearly his whole force from his camp on the heights of Sourier, to attack the landing-place in the Cul de sac de Cohée, and by that means to cut off the communication between the army and the fleet. Sir Charles Grey, with that quickness of perception that has rendered him so often useful to his country, instantly perceived his design, and without loss of time ordered the grenadiers, under the command of Colonel Buckridge, and the light infantry, under that of Colonel Coote, to advance with the utmost expedition, and attack Mons. Bellgarde's camp at Sourier; and detached a strong corps from the heights of Bruno to support them. They began their attack on the enemy in the wood; and having driven them from thence, began to mount the rugged and almost inaccessible sides of the hill on which Sourier was situated. The troops gallantly forced their way through every obstruction, and mounted the heights under a heavy fire from the retreating enemy, whom they fairly drove up the precipice, and gained the heights, where they found an excellent dinner (provided for Bellgarde and his people) to refresh them after their fatigue. Our loss in this affair[16] was by no means so great as might have been expected, considering the length of ground, and the many disadvantages under which our troops engaged. While this was doing, General Sir Charles Grey cannonaded Bellgarde from the camp at Bruno, whose troops soon retired in confusion to their late camp at Sourier, which they found occupied by the British grenadiers, who turned their own guns on them (consisting of three brass field pieces), and drove them in confusion under the walls of Fort Bourbon. Our soldiers could not now be restrained, but with an impetuosity that General Prescott could not for the moment prevent, advanced so near the fort, that the enemy opening a heavy fire of grape shot on them, obliged them at length to retire with some loss to their new acquisition on Sourier, a post which Sir Charles Grey had intended to have attacked the following day, as being absolutely necessary to enable him to carry on his plan of attack against Fort Bourbon, and which the temerity of Bellgarde had thus put into his hands a day sooner.--The whole business of this action was conducted in such a manner, that each individual concerned partook of the glory of it; and when considered as to its utility, it was perhaps one of the most fortunate, as well as the best conducted, enterprises that happened throughout the campaign. The day after this event General Rochambeau, who commanded in Fort Bourbon, sent an aid de camp on board the Boyne, who went thence with Captain Grey to the Commander in Chief at head quarters. The terms of capitulation that he brought were, that the whole island should be delivered to the English on condition that, in case Louis the Seventeenth should ever come to the throne, it should be restored to him; if not, and the republic should be established, it should be given up to that government. The Commander in Chief returned for answer, 'that he came expressly to take this island for his Britannic Majesty; and that he hoped to take all the French islands in this quarter on the same account.'--The troops now pitched their tents, and formed their camp on Sourier. General Prescott's quarters were in this camp, where he commanded; and Sir Charles Grey established his head quarters at a small distance in the rear.--General Dundas having arranged every thing relative to the government of St. Pierre, left Colonel Myers of the fifteenth regiment with the battalions of the fifty-eighth and sixty-fifth regiments to garrison that town, and on February 20th embarked with the grenadiers on board the Veteran for Fort Royal Bay. The morning following they disembarked in the Cul de sac de Cohée, and marched directly to head quarters at Sourier, where they pitched their tents, and with regret parted from General Dundas, their commander hitherto, who went to Camp la Coste to take the command of the light infantry.--The artillery, artificers, and engineers, were now busily employed in landing stores and ammunition preparatory to the formation of the batteries necessary for the siege; in which business they received great assistance from a body of seamen landed for that purpose: three hundred of these brave fellows were landed at the wharf in the Cul de sac Cohée from his majesty's ships Santa Margarita, Captain Harvey, with his Lieutenants Woolley and Harrison; the Solebay, Captain Kelly, with Lieutenants Carthew and Schomberg; and Nautilus sloop, Captain Carpenter; with Lieutenant Bennet, Lieutenant Collins, and a party of marines, from the Santa Margarita. They instantly began to proceed with a twenty-four pounder and two six pounders[17] towards Sourier.

The truth of the Greek proverb, that \"_a great book is a great evil_,\" is no where more apparent than in the construction of works on agricultural concerns. Those who have attended to the subject well know, that the profitable management of live-stock is by far the most difficult branch of farming, as it is here that improvement is peculiarly tardy; and from this we might infer that authors would endeavour so to arrange and simplify their treatises as to enable every one to obtain the bearings of the study at the smallest possible expense and trouble. Such, however, is not the case. Many would appear to have done their best so to dilute and mystify the little which is known about the matter, that it is nearly impossible for any one, not gifted with more than ordinary power of application, to arrive at any thing like just conclusions. To avoid this error has been my object in the following pages. Such points only as are of real importance have been noticed; every thing having been rejected which could not admit of a practical application. For this reason, also, I have omitted all allusion to foreign _varieties_ of the sheep, an account of which is, in some similar works, made to occupy so large a space. The general laws by which animal bodies are governed, and the changes to which they are rendered liable by their subserviency to man, are here--and for the first time as regards the sheep--gone into at considerable length. Too little value is in general attached to such inquiries; though, when endeavouring to improve a domesticated race, we must be perfectly aware, that without this species of knowledge we are like a ship at sea without the guiding aids of the rudder and the compass, and liable to be carried in the right or in the wrong direction only as chance directs.  In conclusion, I need make no apology for any defects that may appear in this little work, having done my best to make it useful to the farmer.  CASTLE STREET, DUMFRIES,  _July, 1838_.
