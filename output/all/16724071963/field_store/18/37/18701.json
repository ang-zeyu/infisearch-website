The King must ask young King Charles to dismiss Magellan as an act of royal courtesy. If these efforts were not successful, it was argued that the expedition must be arrested by force, or Magellan must be murdered by secret spies of the court.  The fleet preparing was to consist of five ships with ample equipment. These were named the Trinidad, the San Antonio, of one hundred and twenty Spanish tons each; the Concepcion, of ninety Spanish tons; the Victoria, of eighty-five tons; and the Santiago, of seventy-five. The Victoria, the ship of destiny, was to circumnavigate the globe.  And now while the hammers were at work, the dull King of Portugal began to arouse himself to arrest the plan, and the court, seeing his spirit, acted with him.  In the bright days in Zaragoza Magellan had been warned that he was in danger of being assassinated. But he did not take alarm. As his project rose into public view at Seville he must have known that he was surrounded by spies, but he did not heed them; he kept right on, marching forward as it were after the inspiration that had taken possession of his soul.  [Illustration: BEHAIM'S GLOBE. 1492.]  There was an India House in Seville, composed of merchants, and these were favorable to the expedition. In Spain everything favored Magellan.  Aluaro da Costa was the Portuguese minister to the court of Spain. He plotted against Magellan, and sought an interview with young Charles in order to induce him to eliminate the Portuguese from the expedition. Charles was about to become a brother-in-law to Dom Manoel, and Aluaro da Costa could appeal to the King in this cause in many ways.  Full of diplomacy and craft, he met the King who had to weigh the prospect of gold and glory against this personal argument. Gold outweighed the family considerations, for Charles in his young days was a man of powerful ambitions.  Aluaro da Costa wrote to Dom Manoel a graphic account of this interview. It shows how politic ministers of state were in those days. We can not give the reader a clearer view of some of the obstacles against which Magellan had to contend in those perilous days in Spain than by citing Aluaro's account to Dom Manoel of his interview with young Charles V in his intrigue against Magellan:  \"SIRE: Concerning Ferdinand Magellan's affair, how much I have done and how I have labored, God knows, as I have written you at length; and now I have spoken upon the subject very strongly to the King, putting before him all the inconveniences that in this case may arise, and also representing to him what an ugly matter it was, and how unusual for one King to receive the subjects of another King, his friend, contrary to his wish, a thing unheard of among cavaliers, and accounted both ill-judged and ill-seeming. Yet I had just put your Highness and your Highness's possessions at his service in Valladolid at the moment that, he was harboring these persons against your will. I begged him to consider that this was not the time to offend your Highness, the more so in an affair which was of so little importance and so uncertain; and that he would have plenty of subjects of his own and men to make discoveries when the time came, without availing himself of those malcontents of your Highness, whom your Highness could not fail to believe likely to labor more for your disservice than for anything else; also that his Highness had had until now so much to do in discovering his own kingdoms and dominions, and in settling them, that he ought not to turn his attention to these new affairs, from which dissensions and other matters, which may well be dispensed with, may result.  \"I also presented to him the bad appearance that this would have at the very moment of the marriage--the ratification of friendship and affection. And also that it seemed to me that your Highness would much regret to learn that these men asked leave of him to return,[A] and that he did not grant it, the which are two faults--the receiving them contrary to your desire, and the retaining them contrary to their own. And I begged of him, both for his own and for your Highness's sake, that he would do one of two things: either permit them to go, or put off the affair for this year, by which he would not lose much; and means might be taken whereby he might be obliged, and your Highness might not be offended, as you would be were this scheme carried out.      [A] This statement there is every reason to believe was a pure     fiction of Da Costa.  \"He was so surprised, sire, at what I told him, that I also was surprised; but he replied to me with the best words in the world, saying that on no account did he wish to offend your Highness, and many other good words; and he suggested that I should speak to the Cardinal, and confide the whole matter to him.  \"May the Lord increase the life and dominions of your Highness to his holy service. From Saragoca, Tuesday night, the 28th day of September.            \"I kiss the hands of your Highness,                                               \"ALUARO DA COSTA.\"  Court intrigue against Magellan did not avail. There was one thing statecraft could do. It could set spies on Magellan on board his own ships. This it succeeded in doing.  There was in Spain at this time a Portuguese adventurer and navigator by the name of Estevan or Esteban Gormez--Stephen Gormez.  He was a student of navigation, and was restless to follow the examples of Columbus and Vasco da Gama. He had applied to the court of Spain--probably to Cardinal Ximenes, for a commission to go on a voyage of discovery and he had received a favorable answer, and was preparing to embark, when Magellan appeared at court and promised to find the Spice Islands by way of South America.  Magellan's scheme was so much larger and definite than that of Gormez that the court canceled its favors to the lesser plans, and Gormez had to abandon his prospects of sailing under the royal favors of Spain.  The eyes of Spain were now fixed on Magellan.  \"I will find a way to the Spice Islands by South America or by the West,\" said Magellan to the ministers of the King, \"or you may have my head.\"  These were bold words. Magellan had not only been to the Spice Islands, but he had gone out on the very voyage that discovered some of them. He had behaved heroically on the voyage. So his application to the court superseded the plan of Gormez and the latter sunk out of sight.  In his despondency at the failure of his plans, Gormez came to Magellan.  \"My countryman,\" said Gormez, \"your schemes have supplanted mine and turned my ships into air. I was the first to plan a voyage to the Moluccas out of the wake of hurricanes and monsoons. I do not feel that I have been treated rightly. Something surely is due to me.\"  Magellan was a man of generous impulses. He saw that Gormez had a case for moral appeal.  \"My friend,\" said he, \"you shall have a place in my expedition.\"  He could but think that the inspiration and knowledge of navigation of his countryman would be useful to him, and he pitied him for his disappointment, knowing how he himself would feel were his plans to be set aside.  So Gormez, the Portuguese, was made the pilot of the Antonio.  Magellan, had he reflected, must have seen that this man would carry with him envy and jealousy, passions that are poisons. But Estefano, or Esteban, or Stephen Gormez, took his place at the pilot house of the Antonio to follow the lantern of Magellan, but the hurt in his heart at being superseded never healed.  On the ships also was one Juan de Carthagena, captain of the Concepcion, a spy, and one of the \"malapots\" of the expedition. He was called the _veedor_, or inspector. He inspected Magellan, and Magellan inspected him, as we shall see.  And now the flags arose in the clear air, and the joyful fleet cleared the Guadalquivir and leaped into the arms of the open sea, amid the acclamations of gay grandees and a happy people.  It was September 20th when the anchors were lifted, of which probably one was destined to come back in triumph after an immortal voyage that encompassed the earth, and gave to Spain a new ocean.  And the King of Portugal ordered the coat of arms to be torn down from the house of Magellan, as we have pictured at the beginning of our narrative.     CHAPTER VII.  \"MAROONED.\"   The expedition moved down its western way, over the track of Columbus. It had left poor Ruy Faleiro behind--he who had seen the progress of it all in the fitful light of a disordered vision. He had not relinquished his own high aims. He hoped to follow Magellan with an expedition of his own.  The ships were furnished with \"castles,\" fore and aft; they carried gay pennons and were richly stored. The artillery comprised sixty-two culverins and smaller ordnance. Five thousand or more pounds of powder were shut up in the magazines, and a large provision was made for trading with the natives--looking glasses for women, velvets, knives, and ivory ornaments, and twenty thousand bells.  Magellan's ship bore a lantern, swung high in the air amid the thickly corded rigging, which the other ships were to keep in view in the night. What a history had this lantern! It gleamed out on the night track of a new world, a pillar of fire that encompassed the earth as in the orbit of a star.  The fleet had fifteen days of good weather and passed Cape Verde Islands, running along the African coast.  But the fleet carried with it disloyal hearts. The Portuguese prejudice against Magellan sailed with it. The Spanish sailors distrusted the loyalty of Magellan to Spain.  The commander was a man of great heart, chivalrous, and noble, but he could be firm when there arose an occasion for it.  After leaving Teneriffe Magellan altered his course.  Juan de Carthagena, captain of the San Antonio, \"the inspector\" and a spy, demanded of Magellan why he had done so.  \"Sir,\" said Magellan, \"you are to follow my flag by day and my"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],["title","The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#6)"],["body","by night, and to ask me no further questions.\"  Carthagena demanded that Magellan should report his plans to him. Finding that the Admiral was bent on conducting his own expedition, he began to act sullenly, and to disobey orders.  Again the captain of the San Antonio demanded of Magellan that he should communicate his orders in regard to the course of steerage to him. He did this by virtue of his office as inspector. He showed a very haughty and disloyal spirit, and if this were not to be checked, the success of the expedition would be imperilled. He was abetted by Pedro Sanches, a priest. Magellan saw treason already brewing, and he determined to stamp it out at once.  He went to Carthagena, and laid his hands on him.  \"Captain, you are my prisoner.\"  The astonished captain cried out to his men:  \"Unhand me--seize Magellan!\"  Carthagena had been a priest, and he had great personal influence, but the men did not obey him.  \"Lead him to the stocks and secure him there,\" ordered Magellan.  The order was obeyed. The fallen inspector was committed to the charge of the Captain of the Victoria, and another officer was given charge of the San Antonio.  \"When we reach land Juan de Carthagena shall be marooned,\" was the sentence imposed upon the inspector. A like sentence was imposed upon Sanches.  It touched the hearts of the crews to hear this sentence. What would become of the two priests, were it to be executed? Would they fall prey to the natives, or perhaps win the hearts of the people and be made chiefs among them?  There was a pilot on board the ship who sympathized with the mutineers, but who had close lips, Esteban Gormez, of whom we have spoken. Were the two mutineers to be marooned he would be glad to rescue them.  [Illustration: Night after night the ships followed Magellan's lantern.]  He had been discontented since the day that his own plans for an expedition had been superseded by those of Magellan.  His discontentment had grown. He became critical as the fleet sailed on. Every day reminded him of what he might have done, if he could have only secured the opportunity.  A disloyal heart in any enterprise is a very perilous influence. A wooden horse in Troy is more dangerous than an army outside.  Magellan in Gormez had a subtle foe, and that foe was his own countryman.  This man probably could not brook to see his rival add the domains of the sea to the crowns of Juana and of Charles, though he himself had sought to do the same thing. Magnanimous he could not be. Discovery for the sake of discovery had little meaning for him, but only discovery for his own advancement and glory.  He became jealous of Mesquita, Magellan's cousin, now master of the Antonio, who is thought to have advised severe measures to suppress conspiracy.  Night after night he sat down under the moon and stars, and brooded over his fancied neglect, and dreamed. Night after night the ships followed the lantern of Magellan, and the wonders of the sea grew; but to him it were better that no discoveries should be made than that such achievements were to go to the glory of Spain through the pilotage of Magellan.  Discontent grows; jealousy grows as one broods over fancied wrongs, and sees the prospects of a rival's success. So it was with Gormez. In his heart he did not wish the expedition to succeed. He was ambitious to lead such an enterprise himself, which he also did, at last, sailing along Massachusetts Bay and giving it its first name.  When Gormez had heard that the two disloyal men were to be marooned, his feelings rose against Magellan. That they deserved their sentence he well knew, but they were opposed to Magellan, as was his own heart. He would have been glad to have saved them from the execution of their sentence, but he did not know how to do it.  \"I will rescue them if ever I can,\" he thought. \"This expedition is not for the glory of Portugal.\"  The ships sailed on, bearing the two conspirators to some place where they could be marooned.  Let us turn from this dark scene to one of a more hopeful spirit.  One day, as we may picture the scene, the sea lay unruffled like a mirror. The ships drifted near each other, and night came on after a sudden twilight, and the stars seemed like liquid lights shot forth or let down from some ethereal fountain. The Southern Cross shone so clearly as to uplift the eyes of the sailors. The ships were becalmed.  Boats began to ply between the ships, and the officers of the Trinity, Santiago, Victoria, and Concepcion assembled under the awning of the San Antonio, Mesquita's ship, of one hundred and twenty tons.  Mesquita, as we have said, was a cousin of Magellan, and so the Antonio seemed a friendly ship.  Magellan sat down by his cousin. The lantern was going out; its force was spent.  \"We must get a new kind of lantern,\" said Magellan to his cousin, \"and a code of signal lights. We need a lantern that is something more steady and durable than a faggot of wood.\"  \"I have here a new farol,\" he continued, the men listening with intent ears. \"Here it is, and I wonder, my sailors, how far your eyes will follow it.\"  \"All loyal hearts will follow it,\" said Mesquita, \"wherever it may go.\"  Gormez frowned. His heart was bitter.  There rose up an officer named Del Cano, and stood hat in hand. All eyes were fixed upon him.  \"May it please you, Admiral,\" he said, \"to receive a word from me. I will follow the new farol wherever it may lead me. I have ceased to count my own life in this cause.\"  Gormez frowned again.  \"Del Cano,\" said the Admiral, \"I believe in you. You have a true heart. If I should fall see that this farol goes back to Spain!\"  Del Cano bowed.  [Illustration: Arms granted to Sebastian Del Cano, Captain of the Victoria, the first vessel that circumnavigated the globe.]  Magellan showed the new lantern to the officers. It was made of beaten reeds that had been soaked in water, and dried in the sun. It would hold light long, and carry it strongly and steadily.  \"All the ships must have these new farols,\" said he, \"and I must teach you how to signal by them.\"  He stood up. The moon was rising, and the dusky, purple air became luminous.  He held the farol in his hand.  \"Two lights,\" he said, \"shall mean for the ship to tack.  \"Three lights that the sails shall be lowered. Four, that they shall stop.  \"Five lights, or more, that we have discovered land, when the flagship shall discharge a bombard. Follow my lantern always; you can trust it wherever it may fare. My farol shall be my star!\"  The men sat there long. There sprung up a breeze at last, and the sea began to ripple in the moon.  Most expeditions that have made successful achievements have carried men of great hope. Such a man was Del Cano. He was loyal to the heart of Magellan; and happy is any leader who has such a companion, whose steel rings true.  Magellan hung out the farol. The sails were spread, and the fleet passed on over the solitary ocean.  Whither?     CHAPTER VIII.  \"THE WONDERS OF NEW LANDS.\"--PIGAFETTA'S TALES OF HIS ADVENTURES WITH MAGELLAN.--THE STORY OF \"THE FOUNTAIN TREE.\"--\"ST. ELMO'S FIRE.\"   The ships moved on, bearing the hopeful Del Cano, the frowning Gormez, the two prisoners, and the happy Italian Pigafetta.  Our next chapters will be a series of wonder tales which reveal the South Temperate Zone and its inhabitants as they appeared to the young and susceptible Italian, Pigafetta, nearly four hundred years ago.  Pigafetta, as we have shown, desired to accompany Magellan that he might \"see the wonders of the new lands.\" He saw them indeed, and he painted them with his pen so vividly that they will always live. We get our first views of the strange inhabitants of the Southern regions of the New World from him. We are to follow his narratives, as printed for the Hakluyt Society, London, making some omissions, and changing its form in part, hoping thereby to render the text more clear. We closely follow the spirit of events. Pigafetta addresses his narrative \"To the very illustrious and very excellent Lord Philip de Villiers Lisleaden, Grand Master of Rhodes,\" of whom we have spoken.  [Illustration: Interior of the Alcázar of Seville.]  He says, by way of introduction:  \"Finding myself in Spain in the year of the nativity of our Lord, 1519, at the court of the most serene King of the Romans (Charles V), and learning there of the great and awful things of the ocean world, I desired to make a voyage to unknown seas, and to see with my own eyes some of the wonderful things of which I had heard.  \"I heard that there was in the city of Seville an armada (armade) of five ships, which were ready to perform a long voyage in order to find the shortest way to the Islands of Moluco (Molucca) from whence came the spices. The Captain General of this armada was Ferdinand de Magagleanes (Magellan), a Portuguese gentleman, who had made several voyages on the ocean. He was an honorable man. So I set out from Barcelona, where the Emperor was, and traveled by land to the said city of Seville, and secured a place in the expedition.  \"The Captain General published ordinances for the guidance of the voyage.  \"He willed that the vessel on which he himself was should go before the other vessels, and that the others should keep in sight of it. Therefore he hung by night over the deck a torch or faggot of burning wood which he called a farol (lantern), which burned all night, so that the ships might not lose sight of his own.  \"He arranged to set other lights as signals in the night. When he wished to make a tack on account of a change of weather he set two lights. Three lights signified \"faster.\" Four lights signified to stop and turn. When he discovered a rock or land, it was to be signalled by other lights.  \"He ordered that three watches should be kept at night.  \"On Monday, St. Lawrence Day, August 10th, the five ships with the crews to the number of two hundred and thirty-seven[A] set sail from the noble city of Seville, "]]]
