This decree had taken effect in Paris and in the great towns, and also in some parts of the country where the passions of the people were most aroused against the nobility; but in Burgundy it had remained a dead letter. The Marquis de St. Caux was popular upon his estates, and no one had ever neglected to concede to him and to the marquise their titles. He himself had regarded the decree with disdain. \"They may take away my estates by force,\" he said, \"but no law can deprive me of my title, any more than of the name which I inherited from my fathers. Such laws as these are mere outbursts of folly.\"  But the Assembly continued to pass laws of the most sweeping description, assuming the sovereign power, and using it as no monarch of France had ever ventured to do. Moderate men were shocked at the headlong course of events, and numbers of those who at the commencement of the movement had thrown themselves heart and soul into it now shrank back in dismay at the strange tyranny which was called liberty.  \"It seems to me that a general madness has seized all Paris,\" the marquis said to his wife on his return, \"but at present nothing can be done to arrest it. I have seen the king and queen. His majesty is resolved to do nothing; that is, to let events take their course, and what that will be Heaven only knows. The Assembly has taken all power into its hands, the king is already a mere cipher, the violence of the leaders of these men is beyond all bounds; the queen is by turns hot and cold, at one moment she agrees with her husband that the only hope lies in conceding  everything; at another she would go to the army, place herself in its hands, and call on it to march upon Paris.  \"At anyrate there is nothing to be done at present but to wait. Already numbers of the deputies, terrified at the aspect of affairs, have left France, and I am sorry to say many of the nobles have also gone. This is cowardice and treachery to the king. We cannot help him if he will not be helped, but it is our duty to remain here ready to rally round him when he calls us to his side. I am glad that the Assembly has passed a law confiscating the estates of all who have emigrated.\"  Although the marquise was much alarmed at the news brought by her husband she did not think of questioning his decision. It did not seem to her possible that there could be danger for her and hers in their quiet country chateau. There might be disturbance and bloodshed, and even revolution, in Paris; but surely a mere echo of this would reach them so far away.  \"Whenever you think it is right to go up and take your place by the king I will go and take mine by the queen,\" she said quietly. \"The children will be safe here; but of course we must do our duty.\"  The winter passed quietly at the chateau; there was none of the usual gaiety, for a deep gloom hung over all the noble families of the province; still at times great hunting parties were got up for the chase of the wolves among the forests, for, when the snow was on the ground, these often came down into the villages and committed great depredations.     CHAPTER III  The Demon Wolf   Upon the first of these occasions Harry and Ernest were in high spirits, for they were to take part in the chase. It was the first time that Ernest had done so, for during the previous winter the marquis had been in attendance on the court. At an early hour the guests invited to take part in the chase began to assemble at the chateau.  Many who lived at a distance had come overnight, and the great court-yard presented a lively aspect with the horses and attendants of the guests. A collation was spread in the great hall, and the marquise and her eldest daughter moved about among the guests saying a few words of welcome to each.  \"Who is that young man who is talking to mademoiselle your sister, Ernest?\" Harry asked, for since the adventure with the mad dog the ceremonious title had been dropped, and the boys addressed each other by their Christian names.  \"That is Monsieur Lebat; he is the son of the Mayor of Dijon.  I have not see him here before, but I suppose my father thinks it is well in these times to do the civil thing to the people of Dijon. He is a good-looking fellow too, but it is easy to see he is not a man of good family.\"  \"I don't like his looks at all,\" Harry said shortly. \"Look what a cringing air he puts on as he speaks to madame la marquise. And yet I fancy he could be insolent when he likes. He may be good-looking, but it is not a style I admire, with his thick lips and his half-closed eyes. If I met him at home I should say the fellow was something between a butcher and a Jew pedlar.\"  \"Well done, monsieur the aristocrat!\" Ernest said laughing.  \"This is your English equality! Here is a poor fellow who is allowed to take a place our of his station, thanks to the circumstances of the time, and you run him down mercilessly!\"  \"I don't run him down because he is not a gentleman,\" Harry said. \"I run him down because I don't like his face; and if he were the son of a duke instead of the son of a mayor I should dislike it just as much. You take my word for it, Ernest, that's a bad fellow.\"  \"Poor Monsieur Lebat!\" Ernest laughed. \"I daresay he is a very decent fellow in his way.  \"I am sure he is not, Ernest; he has a cruel bad look. I would not have been that fellow's fag at school for any money.  \"Well, it's fortunate, Harry, that you are not likely to see much of him, else I should expect to see you flying at his neck and strangling him as you did the hound.\"  Harry joined in the laugh.  \"I will restrain myself, Ernest; and besides, he would be an awkward customer; there's plenty of strength in those shoulders of his, and he looks active and sinewy in spite of that indolent air he puts on; but there is the horn, it is time for us to mount.\"  In a few minutes some thirty gentlemen were in the saddle, the marquis, who was grand louvetier of the province, blew his horn, and the whole cavalcade got into motion, raising their hunting caps, as they rode off, to the marquise and her daughters, who were standing on the step of the chateau to see them depart. The dogs had already been sent forward to the forest, which was some miles distant.  On arriving there the marquis found several woodmen, who had been for the last two days marking the places most frequented by the wolves. They had given their reports and the party were just starting when a young forester rode up.  \"Monsieur le marquis,\" he said, \"I have good news for you; the demon wolf is in the forest. I saw him making his way along a glade an hour since as I was on my way thither. I turned back to follow him, and tracked him to a ravine in the hills choked with undergrowth.\"  The news created great excitement.  \"The demon wolf!\" the marquis repeated. \"Are you sure?\"  \"Quite sure, monsieur. How could I mistake it! I saw him once four years ago, and no one who had once done so could mistake any other wolf for him.\"  \"We are in luck indeed, gentlemen,\" the marquis said. \"We will see if we can't bring this fellow's career to an end at last. I have hunted him a score of times myself since my first chase of him, well-nigh fifteen years ago, but he has  always given us the slip.\"  \"And will again,\" an old forester, who was standing close to Harry, muttered. \"I do not believe the bullet is cast which will bring that wolf to earth.\"  \"What is this demon wolf?\" Harry asked Ernest.  \"It is a wolf of extraordinary size and fierceness. For many years he has been the terror of the mothers of this part of France. He has been known to go into a village and boldly carry off an infant in mid-day. Every child who has been killed by wolves for years is always supposed to have been slain by this wolf. Sometimes he is seen in one part of the province, and sometimes in another.  \"For months he is not heard of. Then there is slaughter among the young lambs. A child going to school, or an old woman carrying home a faggot from the forest is found torn and partly devoured, and the news spreads that the demon wolf has returned to the neighbourhood. Great hunts have over and over again been got up specially to slay him, but he seems to lead a charmed life. He has been shot at over and over again, but he seems to be bullet-proof.  \"The peasants regard him not as an ordinary wolf but as a demon, and mothers quiet their children when they cry by saying that if they are not good the demon wolf will carry them off.  Ah, if we could kill him to-day it would be a grand occasion!\"  \"Is there anything particular about his appearance?\"  \"Nothing except his size. Some of those who have seen him declare that he is as big as three ordinary wolves; but my father, who has caught sight of him several times, says that this is an exaggeration, though he is by far the largest wolf he ever saw. He is lighter in colour than other wolves, but those who saw him years ago say that this was not the case then, and that his light colour must be due to his great age.\"  The party now started, under the guidance of the forester, to the spot where he had seen the wolf enter the underwood.  It was the head of a narrow valley. The sides which inclosed it sloped steeply, but not too much so for the wolf to climb. During the last halt the marquis had arranged the plan of action. He himself, with three of the most experienced huntsmen, took their stations across the valley, which was but seventy or eighty yards wide. Eight of the others were to dismount and take post on either side of the ravine.  \"I am sorry, gentlemen, that I cannot find posts for the rest of you, but you may have your share of the work. Over and over again this wolf has slipped away when we thought we had him surrounded, and what he has done before he may do again. Therefore, let each of you take up such a position as he thinks best outside"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3785"],["title","In the Reign of Terror: The Adventures of a Westminster Boy (#7)"],["body","circle, but keeping well behind trees or other shelter, so as to cover himself from any random shot that may be fired after the wolf. Do you, on your part, fire only when the wolf has passed your line, or you may hit some of us.\"  The two lads were naturally among those left out from the inner circle.  \"What do you think, Ernest; shall we remain on our horses here in the valley or climb the hills?\"  \"I should say wait here, Harry; in the first place, because it is the least trouble, and in the second, because I think he is as likely to come this way as any other. At any rate we may as well dismount here, and let horses crop that piece of fresh grass until we hear the horn that will tell us when the dogs have been turned into the thicket to drive him out.\"  It was half an hour before they heard the distant note of the horn.  \"They have begun,\" Ernest exclaimed; \"we had better mount at once. If the brute is still there he is just as likely, being such an old hand at the sport, to make a bolt at once, instead of waiting until the dogs are close to him.\"  \"What are we to do if we see him?\" Harry asked.  \"We are to shoot him if we can. If we miss him, or he glides past before we can get a shot, we must follow shouting, so as to guide the rest as to the direction he is taking.\"  \"My chance of hitting him is not great,\" Harry said. \"I am not a very good shot even on my feet; but sitting in my saddle I do not think it likely I should get anywhere near him.\"  A quarter of an hour passed. The occasional note of a dog and the shouts of the men encouraging them to work their way through the dense thicket could be heard, but no sound of a shot met their ears.  \"Either he is not there at all, or he is lying very close,\" Ernest said.  \"Look, look!\" Harry said suddenly, pointing through the trees to the right.  \"That is the wolf, sure enough,\" Ernest exclaimed. \"Come along.\"  The two lads spurred their horses and rode recklessly through the trees towards the great gray beast, who seemed to flit like a shadow past them.  \"Mind the boughs, Ernest, or you will be swept from your saddle. Hurrah! The trees are more open in front.\"  But although the horses were going at the top of their speed they scarcely seemed to gain on the wolf, who, as it seemed to them, kept his distance ahead without any great exertion.  \"We shall never catch him,\" Harry exclaimed after they had ridden for nearly half an hour, and the laboured panting of the horses showed that they could not long maintain the pace.  Suddenly, ten yards ahead of the wolf, a man, armed with a hatchet, stepped out from behind a tree directly in its way. He was a wood-cutter whose attention being called by the sound of the galloping feet of the horses, had left his half-hewn tree and stepped out to see who was coming. He gave an exclamation of surprise and alarm as he saw the wolf, and raised his hatchet to defend himself. Without a moment's hesitation the animal sprang upon him and carried him to the ground, fixing its fangs into his throat. There was a struggle for a few moments, and then the wolf left its lifeless foe and was about to continue its flight.  \"Get ready to fire, Harry,\" Ernest exclaimed as the wolf sprang upon the man, \"it is our last chance. If he gets away now we shall never catch him.\"  They reined in their horses just as the wolf rose to fly. Harry fired first, but the movement of his panting horse deranged his aim and the bullet flew wide. More accustomed to firing on horseback, Ernest's aim was truer, he struck the wolf on the shoulder, and it rolled over and over. With a shout of triumph the boys dashed forward, but when they were within a few paces the wolf leapt to its feet and endeavoured to spring towards them. Harry's horse wheeled aside so sharply that he was hurled from the saddle.  The shock was a severe one, and before he could rise to his feet the wolf was close upon him. He tried as he rose to draw his hunting-sword, but before he could do so,  Ernest, who had, when he saw him fall, at once leaped from his horse, threw himself before him, and dealt the wolf a severe blow on the head with his weapon.  Furious with rage and pain the wolf sprang upon him and seized him by the shoulder. Ernest dropped his sword, and drawing his hunting-knife struck at it, while at the same moment Harry ran it through the body.  So strong and tenacious of life was the animal that the blows were repeated several times before it loosed its hold of Ernest's shoulder and fell dead.  \"Are you hurt, my dear Ernest?\" was Harry's first exclamation.  \"Oh, never mind that, that's nothing,\" Ernest replied. \"Only think, Harry, you and I have killed the demon wolf, and no else had a hand in it. There is a triumph for us.\"  \"The triumph is yours, Ernest,\" Harry said. \"He would have got away had you not stopped him with your bullet, and he would have made short work of me had you not come to my rescue, for I was half stunned with the fall, and he would have done for me as quickly as he did for that poor fellow there.\"  \"That is true, Harry, but it was you who gave him his mortal wound. He would have mastered me otherwise. He was too strong for me, and would have borne me to the ground. No, it's a joint business, and we have both a right to be proud of it. Now let us fasten him on my horse; but before we do that, you must bind up my shoulder somehow. In spite of my thick doublet he has bit me very sharply. But first let us see to this poor fellow. I fear he is dead.\"  It was soon seen that nothing could be done for the woodman, who had been killed almost instantly. Harry, therefore, proceeded to cut off Ernest's coat-sleeve and bathed the wound. The flesh was badly torn, and the arm was so useless that he thought that some bones were broken. Having done his best to bandage the wound, he strapped the arm firmly across the body, so as to prevent its being shaken by the motion of the riding. It was with the greatest difficulty that they were able to lift the body of the wolf, but could not lay it across the horse, as the animal plunged and kicked and refused to allow it to be brought near. Ernest was able to assist but little, for now that the excitement was over he felt faint and sick with the pain of his wound.  \"I think you had better ride off, Harry, and bring some one to our assistance. I will wait here till you come back.\"  \"I don't like to do that,\" Harry said. \"They must be seven or eight miles away, and I may not be able to find them. They may have moved away to some other part of the forest. Ah! I have an idea!  Suppose I cut a pole, tie the wolf's legs together and put the pole through them; then we can hoist the pole up and lash its ends behind the two saddles. The horses may not mind so much if it's not put upon their backs.\"   \"That might do,\" Ernest agreed; \"but you mustn't make the pole more than six or seven feet long, or we shall have difficulty in riding between the trees.\"  The pole was soon cut and the wolf in readiness to be lifted, but the horses still refused to stand steady.  \"Blindfold them, Harry,\" Ernest said suddenly, \"and tie them up to two trees a few feet apart.\"  This was soon done, and the boys then patted and soothed them until they became quiet. The pole was now lifted, and this time they managed to lay it across the saddles and to lash it securely to the cantles. Then they mounted, and taking the bandages off the horses' eyes set out on their way. The horses were fidgety at first, but presently fell into a quiet walk.  For upwards of an hour they heard nothing of the huntsmen.  Not a sound broke the stillness of the forest; the sun was shining through the leafless trees, and they were therefore enabled to shape their course in the direction in which  they had come. Presently they heard the sound of a shot, followed by several others, and then the bay of hounds. The sound came from their left.  \"They have been trying a fresh place,\" Ernest said, \"and I expect they have come upon two wolves; one they have shot, the hounds are after the other.\"  They turned their horses' heads in the direction of the sounds, and presently Harry said:  \"They are coming this way.\"  Louder and louder grew the sounds of the chase; then the deep tones of the hounds were exchanged for a fierce angry barking.  \"The wolf is at bay!\" Ernest exclaimed.  A minute later some notes were sounded on the horn.  \"That is the mort, Harry. We shall arrive before they move on again.\"  Five minutes later they rode into a glade where a number of horsemen were assembled. There was a shout as they were seen.  \"Why, Ernest,\" the marquis called as they approached, \"we thought you had lost us. You have missed some rare sport; but what's the matter with your arm, and what have you got there?\"  \"We have got the demon wolf,\" Ernest replied; \"so you haven't had all the sport to yourselves.\"  There was a general exclamation of surprise and almost incredulity, and then every one rode over to meet them, and when it was seen that the object slung between the two horses was really the demon wolf there was a shout of satisfaction and pleasure. Again the notes of the mort rang out through the woods, and every one crowded round the lads to congratulate them and to examine the dead monster. Ernest was lifted from his horse, for he was now reeling in the saddle, and could not have kept his seat many minutes longer. His wound was carefully examined, and the marquis pronounced the shoulder-bone to be broken. A litter was made  and four of the foresters hoisted him upon their shoulders, while four others carried the wolf, still slung on its pole, behind the litter. While the preparations were being made Harry had given the history of the slaying of the wolf, saying that he owed his life to the quickness and courage of Ernest.  \"And I owe mine to him,\" Ernest protested from the bank where he was lying. \"The wolf would have killed me had he not slain it. I was lucky in stopping it with a ball, but the rest"]]]
