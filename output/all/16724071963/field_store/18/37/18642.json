To those carping critics who cavil at the appearance of the stomach in a chapter entitled \"How to Set the Table,\" we need only say that the table is set for the stomach, and the stomach should be set for the table, and anyway, it comes very near being a table of contents, _n'est-ce pas_?     THE KITCHEN RUBAIYAT       Wake, for the Alarm Clock scatters into Flight     The variegated Nightmares of the Night;       Allures the Gas into the Kitchen Range     And pleads for Rolls and Muffins that are Light.      Before the Splendor of the last Dream died     Methought a Voice from out my Doorway cried:       \"When all the Breakfast is Prepared for him     Why doth my lord within his Crib abide?\"      And, as the cat Purred, she who was Before     Within the Kitchen shouted: \"Guard the Door!       Else this new Bridget will have Flown the Coop     And, once Departed, will Return no More!\"      All maids in sight the Wise One gladly Hires     And one of them she Presently acquires,       Yet toward the Bureau does not fail to Look     Because all Maids, as well as Men, are liars.      For Mary Ann has gone, with all her Woes,     And Dinah, too, has fled--where, no one knows,       But still a Bridget from the Bureau comes     And many a Tekla of her Reference blows.      Come, fill the Cup, and let the Kettle Sing!     The Cream and Sugar and Hot Water bring!       Methinks this fragrant liquid amber here     Within the Pot, is pretty much the Thing.      Each Morn a thousand Cereals brings, you say?     Yes, but where leaves the Food of Yesterday?       And this same Grocer man that sells us Nerve     Shall take Pa's Wheat and Mother's Oats away.      For lo, my small Back Yard is thickly Strown     With Ki-Tee-Munch, Chew-Chew, and Postman's Own       Where Apple-Nuts and Strength have been Forgot--     Ah, how these Papers by the Winds are Blown!      The tender Waffle hearts are Set upon     Is either Crisp or Soggy, and Anon       Like Maple Syrup made of corn and Cobs     Lasts but a scant Five Minutes, and is Gone.      I often think that never gets so Red     My flower-like Nose as when I've just been Fed       And after Breakfast, in the Glass I look,     And never Fail to Wish that I were dead.      And this faint Sallow Place upon my Mien--     How came it There? From that fair Coffee Bean?       Ah, take the Glass away! Make Haste unless     You want to see my Whole Complexion green.      When I was Younger, I did oft Frequent     The Married Bunch, and heard Great Argument       About the Fearful Price of Eggs, and How     To get a Dollar's Work out of a Cent.      And when I asked them of their Recompense,     What did they Get for Keeping Down Expense--       Oh, many a cup of Coffee, Steaming Hot,     Must drown the Memory of their Insolence!      If I were Married 't would be my Desire     To get up Every Morn and Build the Fire       For fear my Husband should use Kerosene,     And, without warning, be transported Higher.      Ah, with the Coffee all my Years provide!     Its chemicals may turn me green Inside,       But all my Fears are Scattered to the Winds     When o'er the fragrant Pot I can Preside.      I blame our Mother Eve, who did mistake     Her Job, and flirted Somewhat with the Snake,       For all the Errors of the Flaky Roll,     For all the Terrors of the Buckwheat Cake.      A glass of Creamy Milk just from the Cow,     Or Buttermilk, drawn from the Goat, I trow,       And thou across the Festal Board from Me,     A Six-Room Flat were Paradise enow!      Some for a Patent Bread that will not Crumb,     And nary Bite of Cereal for Some--       Ah, take the Coffee! Let all else go by     Nor heed the Thick White Fur upon the Tongue.      Look to the Human Wrecks about us: lo,     About their Indigestion how they Blow,       And lay the Blame on Coffee, crystal Clear,     Or say the Crisp Hot Muffin is their Foe!      And those who chew and chew upon the Grain,     Have got so used to Chewing, they are Fain       To Dwell upon their Health Food in their Talk     And presently their Neighbors go Insane.   FOOT-NOTES  1. The author began with the intention of adapting the entire Rubaiyat to kitchen purposes, but thought better of it just in time to head off the Lyric Muse, who was coming at full gallop, with her trunk.  2. Those who do not like The Kitchen Rubaiyat will doubtless be glad there is no more of it.  3. Those who do like it can begin at the beginning and read it again. The rest of it would be about like this installment, anyway.  P. S. If the demand is great enough, the rest of it may appear in another book.  P. S. 2. The publisher of this book has an unalterable prejudice against printing poetry, but he allowed The Kitchen Rubaiyat to slip by without question.  P. S. 3. ?

The above table, of course, is only a rough outline, as seasons and localities vary so much. The tendency, too, is to extend the season of every fruit indefinitely, as transporting and refrigerating methods improve. Fruit out of season is always expensive, and often unripe and unsatisfactory. Fortunately, when it is at its best it is always abundant and at the lowest price.  Among the dried fruits may be mentioned Prunelles, Apricots, Apples, Blackberries, Cherries, Nectarines, Peaches, peeled and unpeeled, Pears, Plums, Raspberries, Prunes, Figs, and Dates. Canned fruits which may be used for breakfast, with proper preparation, are Pears, Peaches, Apricots, Cherries, Plums, and Pineapples.  Dried fruits may be soaked over night in the water in which they are to be cooked, and simmered slowly, until they are tender, with little sugar or none at all. They may also be steamed, either with or without sugar, omitting the soaking, until tender enough for a straw to pierce. Combinations of dried fruits are often agreeable, and a few raisins will sometimes add a pleasant flavor.  Canned fruits intended for breakfast should be drained and very thoroughly rinsed in cold water, then allowed to stand for some hours in a cool place.  Many of the fruits, both dried and fresh, combine well with cereals. Care must be taken, however, to follow such acid fruits as Currants, Cherries, Oranges, and Grapefruit, with meat or egg dishes, omitting the cereal, as the starch and acid are very likely to fight with each other when once inside, to the inconvenience of the non-combatant. A fruit which for any reason tastes \"flat\" can be instantly improved in flavor and tonic quality by a sprinkle of lemon-juice.  Below are given different ways of preparing fruit for the breakfast table.   APPLES  I. When served whole, apples should be carefully washed and rubbed to a high polish with a crash towel. Only perfect fruit should be served in this way, and green leaves in the fruit bowl are especially desirable. Fruit-knives are essential.  II. Pare, quarter, and core good eating apples, removing all imperfections. Serve a few quarters on each plate, with or without sugar. A sprinkle of cinnamon or lemon-juice will improve fruit which has little flavor. A grating of nutmeg may also be used.  III. _À la Condé._--Pare, quarter, and core good cooking apples. Arrange in rows in an earthen baking-dish, sprinkle with powdered sugar and lemon-juice, pour a little water into the baking-dish, and add a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Bake slowly, basting frequently with the apple-juice and melted butter. When tender, take out, drain, and cool, saving the juice. Serve with boiled rice or other cereal, using the juice instead of milk.  IV. _À la Cherbourg._--Pare and core good cooking apples; halve or quarter if desired. Cook slowly in a thin syrup flavored with lemon-peel and a bit of ginger-root. Serve separately or with cereal.  V. _À la Fermière._--Pare and core the apples and arrange in a well-buttered baking-dish. Sprinkle slightly with sugar and cinnamon; baste often with melted butter, and serve with boiled rice or other cereal, using the juice instead of milk.  VI. _À la Française._--Core and then peel tart apples. Put into cold water from half an inch to an inch in depth, sprinkle with sugar, cover tightly, and cook very slowly on the back part of the range till tender. Flavorings already noted may be added at pleasure. Skim out the apples, reduce the remaining syrup one-half by rapid boiling, pour over the apples, and cool. Serve cold, with or without"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37680"],["title","The Myrtle Reed Cook Book (#3)"],["body",".  VII. _À la Ninon._--Sprinkle baked apples with freshly grated cocoanut on taking from the oven. Serve on a mound of boiled rice with the milk of the cocoanut.  VIII. _À la Réligieuse._--Core cooking apples; score the skin deeply in a circle all around the fruit. Sprinkle a little sugar in the cores, and dissolve a little currant jelly in the water used for the basting. Cook slowly, and baste once with melted butter. The peel is supposed to rise all around the apple, like a veil--hence the name.  IX. _Baked._--Peel or not, as preferred. Sprinkle with melted butter and sugar, baste now and then with hot water, and serve separately or with cereal.  X. _Baked, with Bananas._--Core, draw a peeled and scraped banana through each core, trimming the ends off even, and bake slowly, basting with hot water, melted butter, and lemon-juice. The apples may be peeled if desired. Serve separately, or with cereal.  XI. _Baked, with Cereal._--Pare or not, as preferred, but core. Fill the centres with left-over cooked cereal and bake slowly. Butter, lemon-juice, or any flavoring recommended before can be used to advantage. Any quartered apples, baked or stewed, can be covered with any preferred cereal, and served with sugar and cream.  XII. _Baked, with Cherries._--Core the apples, fill the centres with pitted cherries, either sour or sweet, bake carefully, basting with syrup and melted butter. The apples may be peeled or not. Take up carefully, and serve separately, or with cereal.  XIII. _Baked, with Currants._--Fill the centres with currants, red or white, and use plenty of sugar. Baste with hot water or melted butter. May be served with cereal if enough sugar is used in baking.  XIV. _Baked, with Dates._--Wash and stone dates, fill the cores of apples with them, sprinkle with powdered sugar and bake, basting with butter, lemon-juice, and hot water. The apples may be peeled or not.  XV. _Baked, with Figs._--Wash the figs carefully, and pack into the cores of apples. Bake, basting with lemon syrup and melted butter. Serve separately or with cereal.  XVI. _Baked, with Gooseberries._--Cap and stem a handful of gooseberries. Fill the cores of large, firm apples with them, using plenty of sugar. Baste with melted butter and hot water. May be served with cereal if plenty of sugar is used in cooking.  XVII. _Baked, with Prunes._--Select tart apples, and peel or not, as preferred. Core and fill the centres with stewed prunes, stoned and drained. Bake slowly, basting with the prune-juice, or with lemon-juice, melted butter, spiced syrup, or hot water containing grated lemon-peel and a teaspoonful of sherry. Two or three cloves may be stuck into each apple, and removed after the apples are cold. Serve, very cold, with cream; separately, or with a cereal.  XVIII. _Baked, with Quinces._--Fill the cores of sweet apples with bits of quince and plenty of sugar. Bake slowly, basting with melted butter and syrup. Serve separately or with cereal.  XIX. _Baked, with Spice._--Select very sour apples, and peel or not, as preferred. Core, and stuff the cavities with brown sugar, putting two whole cloves into each apple. Baste with hot water containing a bit of grated lemon-peel and a teaspoonful of sherry, putting a teaspoonful of butter into the liquor as it forms in the dish. Bake slowly, covered, until the apples are very tender. Serve separately or with a cereal. Cinnamon, or nutmeg, or a blade of mace may be used instead of the cloves.  XX. _Boiled._--Boil slowly in a saucepan with as little water as possible. Do not peel. When tender, lift out, add sugar to the water in which they were boiled; reduce half by rapid boiling, pour over the apples, and let cool. Currant-juice, lemon-juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, or a suspicion of clove may be added to the syrup if the apples lack flavor.  XXI. _Coddled._--Core, cut in halves, but do not peel. Lay in the bottom of an earthen dish, sprinkle lightly with sugar, add a little water, and cook very slowly on the top of the stove until tender.  XXII. _Crusts._--Cut stale bread in circles, lay half of a peeled and cored apple on each piece. Bake carefully, basting with melted butter and a little lemon-juice if desired. When the apples are done, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and take from the oven. Serve either hot or cold.  XXIII. _Dried._--Soak over night in water to cover, after washing thoroughly; cook slowly until soft, sweeten, and flavor with lemon. Raisins, dates, figs, or other dried fruits may be added at pleasure.  XXIV. _Fried._--Core, but do not pare. If very juicy, dredge with flour and fry slowly in hot fat till tender. They are served with pork, or, sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon, with cereals.  XXV. _Glazed._--Core tart apples. Fill the centres with cinnamon, sugar, bits of butter, and a raisin or two. Bake slowly, basting with lemon-syrup. When nearly done, brush with the beaten white of egg and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Serve separately or with cereal.  XXVI. _In Bloom._--Cook pared red apples in any preferred way, and stew the skin separately, in a little water, until the color is extracted. The tiniest bit of red vegetable coloring may be needed. Strain this liquid, and pour it over the apples when done. Or, add currant jelly to color the water in which the apples are boiled, or to the water for basting pared baked apples.  XXVII. _In Casserole._--Arrange good cooking apples in an earthen casserole. Cover with a thin syrup made of brown sugar, add a little spice and a bit of orange- or lemon-peel. Bake, very slowly, tightly covered. Serve cold from the casserole.  XXVIII. _In Crumbs._--Cut strips of stale bread to fit stone custard-cups. Dip in milk, and arrange in the moulds. Fill the centres with apple sauce, cover with a circle of the bread, and steam thirty minutes. Serve cold, with cream.  XXIX. _In Rice-Cups._--Line buttered custard cups with cold boiled rice. Fill the centres with apple sauce or cooked quartered apples, mildly tart rather than sweet. Cover with more of the rice. Steam half an hour and let cool in the cups. Turn out on chilled plates and serve with cream. Cream may be used with any cooked apple, if the Secretary of the Interior files no objections. Cereals, other than rice, left over, can be used in the same way. A wreath of cooked apple quarters around the base of each individual mould is a dainty and acceptable garnish.  XXX. _Jellied._--Cut tart apples in halves, core, place in buttered baking-dish, skin side down, measure the water and add enough barely to cover; add twice as much sugar as water, cover and boil slowly till the apples are tender. Skim out, drain, boil the syrup rapidly till reduced one half; pour over the apples and let cool. Flavorings referred to before can be added to the syrup if desired.  XXXI. _Mock Pineapple._--Arrange alternate slices of sweet apples and oranges, peeled, on a chilled plate, one above the other. Sprinkle with powdered sugar, pour over the orange-juice and serve immediately.  XXXII. _Sauce._--Peel, quarter, and core quick-cooking apples. Sweeten slightly, and when very tender, rub through a sieve and let cool. Any flavoring recommended before may be used.  XXXIII. _Snow._--Peel white-fleshed, firm apples, grate quickly on a coarse grater, and serve in roughly piled heaps on small plates immediately. Use sugar or not.  XXXIV. _Southern, Fried._--Core and cut in thick slices, but do not peel. Dip in egg and crumbs and fry in ham or bacon fat and serve with those meats.  XXXV. _Stewed._--Pare, core, and halve large cooking-apples. Put into an earthen dish, cover with water, sprinkle with sugar, cover tightly, and cook slowly. If flat in taste, sprinkle with lemon-juice, cinnamon, or nutmeg.  XXXVI. _Stewed with Dates._--Add washed and stoned dates to stewed apples when partially cooked, and finish cooking. Dried apricots, fresh or dried cherries, rhubarb, figs, plums, dried peaches, pears, or quinces, may be used in the same way.  XXXVII. _Stewed with Rice._--Boil rice as usual in boiling water, adding a little salt. When partly done, add pared, cored, and quartered quick-cooking apples. Finish cooking. Serve very cold with cream and sugar. Flavorings noted above may be added at discretion.   APRICOTS  I. Wipe with a dry cloth and serve with fruit-knives. A green leaf on each plate is a dainty fruit doily.  II. _Canned._--Drain, rinse in cold water, arrange on plates, and let stand several hours before serving. Sugar or not, as desired. Save the syrup to flavor syrup for pancakes, or to use for puddings, fritters, etc.  III. _Dried._--Soak over night, cook very slowly in the water in which they were soaked, adding very little sugar. Serve with cereal, or separately.  IV. _Sauce._--Cook as above, and rub the fruit through a sieve. The canned, drained, and freshened fruit may be used in the same way.   BANANAS  I. Serve in the skins with fruit-knives, one to each person.  II. Skin and scrape and serve immediately. People who cannot ordinarily eat bananas usually find them harmless when the tough, stringy pulp is scraped off.  III. _Baked._--Bake without peeling, basting with hot water and melted butter occasionally. Let cool in the skins.  IV. _Baked._--Skin, scrape, and bake, basting with lemon-juice and melted butter. Sprinkle with sugar if desired.  V. _Au naturel._--Slice into saucers, sprinkle with lemon-juice and sugar.  VI. _With Sugar and Cream._--Slice, sprinkle with powdered sugar, pour cream over, and serve at once.  VII. _With Oranges._--Slice, add an equal quantity of sliced oranges, and sprinkle with sugar.  VIII. _With Cereal._--Slice fresh bananas into a saucer, sprinkle with sugar, cover with boiled rice or with any preferred cereal.  IX. Equally good with sliced peaches.   BLACKBERRIES  Serve with powdered sugar, with or without cream. A tablespoonful of cracked ice in a saucer of berries is appreciated on a hot morning.   BLUE PLUMS  See Green Gages.   CHERRIES  I. Serve very cold, with the "]]]
