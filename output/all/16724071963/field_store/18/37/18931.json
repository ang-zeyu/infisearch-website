Just on one occasion--which I now record lest I forget it--was boy Rory, as he was still affectionately called, very nearly losing his temper under a rattling fire of chaff from Allan and Ralph, who were in extra good spirits.  It happened months after they had sailed in the _Arrandoon_.  All at once that day Rory grew suddenly quiet, and the smile that still remained on his face was only round the lips, and didn't ripple round the eyes.  It was a sad kind of a smile; then he jumped up and ran away from the table.  \"We've offended him,\" said Allan, looking quite serious.  \"I hope not,\" said Ralph, growing serious in turn.  \"I'll go and look him up;\" this from Allan.  \"No, that you won't!\" put in McBain.  \"Leave boy Rory alone; he'll come to presently.\"  Meanwhile, ridiculous as it may seem, Rory had sped away forward to the dispensary, where he found the doctor.  \"Doctor, dear,\" cried Rory, \"give me a blue pill at once--a couple of them, if you like, for sure it isn't well I am!\"  \"Oh!\" said the surgeon, \"liver a bit out of order, eh?\"  \"Liver!\" cried Rory; \"I know by the nasty temper that's on me that there isn't a bit of liver left in me worth mentioning!  There now, give me the pills.\"  The doctor laughed, but Rory had his bolus; then he came aft again, smiling, confessing to his comrades what a ninny he had very nearly been making of himself.  Just like Rory!  The bearing of our young heroes towards Captain McBain was invariably respectful and affectionate; they both loved and admired him, and, indeed, he was worthy of all their esteem.  In wealth there is power, but in wisdom worth, and Ralph, Rory, and Allan felt this truth if they never expressed it.  McBain had really raised himself to the position he now held; he was a living proof that--    \"Whate'er a man dares he can do.\"  I will not deny, however that McBain possessed a little genius to begin with; but here is old Ap, once but a poor boat-builder, with never a spark of genius in him, superintending the construction of a noble ship. In him we have an example of industry and perseverance pure and simple.  The _Arrandoon_ made speedy progress on the stocks, and the anxious day was near at hand when she would leave her native timbers, and slide gracefully and auspiciously it was to be hoped, into the smooth waters of the Clyde.  That day came at last, and with it came thousands to view the launch. With it came Mrs McGregor and Allan's sister; and the latter was to break the tiny phial of wine and name the ship!  On the platform beneath, and closely adjoining the bows of the _Arrandoon_, were numerous gentlemen and ladies; conspicuous among the former was Rory.  He was full of earnest and pleasant excitement. Conspicuous among the latter was Helen Edith.  She certainly never looked more lovely than she did now.  The ceremony she was about to engage in, in which, indeed, she was chief actress, was just a trifle too much for her delicate nerves, and as she stood, bouquet in hand, with a slight flush on her cheek and a sparkle in her eye, with head slightly bent, she looked like a bride at the altar.  Rory stood near her; perhaps his vicinity comforted her, as did his remarks, to which, however, he met with but little response.  I am beginning to think that Rory loved this sweet child; if he did it was a love that was purely Platonic, and it needed be none the less sincere for all that.  As for Helen Edith--but hark!  A gun rings out from the deck of the _Arrandoon_ causing every window in the vicinity to rattle again, and the steeples to nod.  The gallant ship moves off down the slip slowly--slowly--slowly, yes, slowly but steadily, swerving neither to starboard nor larboard, quicker now faster still.  Will she float?  Our heroes' hearts stand still.  McBain is pale and breathes not.  She slows, she almost stops, now she is over the hitch and on again, on--on--and on--and into the water.  Hurrah!  You should have heard that cheer, and Rory shakes hands with Helen Edith, and compliments her, and positively there are tears in the foolish boy's eyes.  There was a deal of hand-shaking, I can assure you, after the launch, and a deal of joy expressed, and if the truth be told, more than one prayer breathed for the future safety of the _Arrandoon_ and her gallant crew.  There was lunch after launch in the saloon of the new yacht, at which Allan's mother presided with the same quiet dignity she was wont to maintain at the castle that gave the ship its name.  McBain made a speech, and a good one, too, after Ralph had spoken a few words.  Poor Ralph! speaking was certainly not his strong point.  But there was no hesitancy about McBain, and no nervousness either, and during its delivery he stood bolt upright in his place, as straight as an arrow, and his words were manly and straightforward.  Allan felt proud of his foster-father.  But Rory came next.  For once in his life he hadn't the slightest intention of making anybody laugh.  But because he tried not to, he did; and when Irish bull after Irish bull came rattling out, \"Och!\" thinks Rory to himself, \"seriousness isn't my forte after all;\" then he simply gave himself rein, and expressed himself so comically that there was not a dry eye in the room, for tears come with laughing as well as weeping.  There was a deal to be done to the _Arrandoon_--in her, on her, and around her--after she was launched, before she was ready; but it would serve no good purpose and only waste time to describe her completion, for we long to be \"steam up\" and away to sea _en route_ for the starry north.  She was a gallant sight, the _Arrandoon_, as she stood away out to sea, past the rocky shores of Bute, bound south on her trial trip by the measured mile.  Fifteen hundred tons burden was she, with tall and tapering masts: lower, main, topgallant, and royal; not one higher; no star-gazers, sky-scrapers, or moon-rakers; she wouldn't have to rake much for the wind in the stormy seas they were going to.  Then there was the funnel, such a funnel as a man with an eye in his head likes to see, not a mere pipe of a thing, but a great wide armful of a funnel, with the tiniest bit of rake on it; so too had the masts, though the _Arrandoon_ did not look half so saucy as the _Snowbird_.  The _Arrandoon_ had more solidity about her, and more soberness and staidness, as became her--a ship about to be pitted against dangers unknown.  Her figure-head was the bust of a fair and beautiful girl.  That day, on her trial trip, the ladies were on board; and Rory made this remark to Helen Edith:  \"The fair image on our bows, Helen, will soon be gazing wistfully north.\"  \"Ah! you seem to long for that,\" said Helen, \"but,\" she added archly, \"mamma and I look forward to the time when she will be gazing just as wistfully south again.\"  Rory laughed, and the conversation assumed a livelier tone.  Steamers, I always think, are very similar in one way to colts, they require a certain amount of breaking in, they seldom do well on their trial trip.  The _Arrandoon_ was no exception; she promised well at first, and fulfilled that promise for twenty good miles and two; then she intimated to the engineers in charge that she had had enough of it. Well, this was a good opportunity of trying her sailing qualities, and in these she exceeded all expectations.  McBain rubbed his hands with delight, for no yacht at Cowes ever sailed more close to the wind, came round on shorter length, or made more knots an hour.  He promised himself a treat, and that treat was to run out some day with her in half a gale of wind, when there were no ladies on board.  He would then see what the _Arrandoon_ could do under sail, and what she couldn't.  He did this; and the very next day after he came back he made the journey to Leigh Hall, and stopped there for a whole week.  That was proof enough that the captain was pleased with his ship.  Early in the month of the succeeding February, the _Arrandoon_ lay at the Broomielaw, with the blue-peter unfurled, steam up, all hands on board, and even the pilot.  That very morning they were to begin their adventurous voyage.  Ralph, Allan, and Rory would be picked up at Oban, and the vessel now only awaited the arrival of McBain before casting off and dropping down stream.  The Broomielaw didn't look pretty that morning, nor very comfortable. Although the hills all around Glasgow were white with snow, over the city itself hung the smoke like a murky pall.  There was mud under feet, and a Scotch mist held possession of the air.  Here was nothing cheering to look at, slop-shops and pawn-shops, and Jack-frequented dram-shops, bales of wet merchandise on the quay, and eave-dripping dock-houses; nor were the people pleasant to be among; the only human beings that did seem to enjoy themselves were the ragged urchins who had taken shelter in the empty barrels that lined the back of the warehouses; they had shelter, and sugar to eat.  McBain thought he wouldn't be sorry when he was safely round the Mull of Cantyre.  \"Come on, Jack,\" cried one of these tiny gutter-snipes, rushing out of his tub; \"come on, here's a row.\"  There was a row; apparently a fight was going on, for a ring had formed a little way down the street; and simply out of curiosity McBain went to have a peep over the shoulders of the mob.  As usual, the policemen were very busy in some other part of the street.  Only a poor little itinerant nigger boy lying on the ground, being savagely kicked by a burly and half-drunken street porter.  \"Oh!\" the little fellow was shrieking; \"what for you kickee my shins so? Oh!\"  McBain entered the ring in a very businesslike fashion indeed; he begged for room; he told the mob he meant thrashing the ruffian if he did not apologise to the poor lad.  Then he intimated as much to the ruffian himself.  \"Come on,\" was the defiant reply, as the fellow threw himself into a fighting attitude.  \"Man, your mither'll no"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38296"],["title","Wild Adventures round the Pole (#6)"],["body","ye when you gang home the nicht.\"  \"We'll see,\" said McBain, quietly.  For the next three minutes this ruffianly porter's movements were confined to a series of beautiful falls, that would have brought down the house in a circus.  When he rose the last time it was merely to assume a sitting position, \"Gie us your hand,\" he said to McBain. \"You're the first chiel that ever dang Jock the Wraggler.  I admire ye, man--I admire ye.\"  \"Come with me, my little fellow,\" said McBain to the nigger boy; and he took him kindly by the hand.  Meanwhile a woman who had been standing by placed a curious-looking bundle in the lad's hand, and bade him be a good boy, and keep out of Jock the Wraggler's way next time.  \"I'll see you a little way home, Jim,\" continued McBain, when they were clear of the crowd.  \"Jim is what they call you, isn't it?\"  \"Jim,\" said the blackamoor, \"is what dey are good enough to call me. But, sah, Jim has no home.\"  \"And where do you sleep at night, Jim?\"  \"Anywhere, sah.  Jim ain't pertikler; some time it is a sugar barrel, an oder time a door-step.\"  A low, sneering laugh was at this moment heard from the mysterious bundle Jim carried.  McBain started.  \"Don't be afeared, sah,\" said Jim; \"it's only de cockatoo, sah!\"  \"Have you any money, Jim?\" asked McBain.  \"Only de cockatoo, sah,\" replied Jim; \"but la!\" he added, \"I'se a puffuk gemlam (gentleman), sah--I'se got a heart as high as de steeple, sah!\"  \"Well, Jim,\" said McBain, laughing, \"would you like to sail in a big ship with me, and--and--black my boots?\"  \"Golly! yes, sah; dat would suit Jim all to nuffin.\"  \"But suppose, Jim, we went far away--as far as the North Pole?\"  \"Don't care, sah,\" said Jim, emphatically; \"der never was a pole yet as Jim couldn't climb.\"  \"Have you a surname, Jim?\"  \"No, sah,\" replied poor Jim; \"I'se got no belongings but de cockatoo.\"  \"I mean, Jim, have you a second name?\"  \"La! no, sir,\" said Jim; \"one name plenty good enough for a nigga boy. Only--yes now I 'members, in de ship dat bring me from Sierra Leone last summer de cap'n never call me nuffin else but Freezin' Powders.\"  McBain did not take long to make up his mind about anything; he determined to take this strange boy with him, so he took him to a shop and bought him a cage for the cockatoo, and then the two marched on board together, talking away as if they had known each other for years.  Freezing Powders was sent below to be washed and dressed and made decent.  The ship was passing Inellan when he came on deck again.  Jim was thunderstruck; he had never seen snow before.  \"La! sah,\" he cried, pointing with outstretched arm towards the hills; \"look, sah, look; dey never like dat before.  De Great Massa has been and painted dem all white.\"  CHAPTER FIVE.  DANGER ON THE DEEP--A FOREST OF WATERSPOUTS--THE \"ARRANDOON\" IS SWAMPED--THE WARNING.  \"La la lay lee-ah, lay la le lo-O\" So went the song on deck--a song without words, short, and interrupted at every bar, as the men hauled cheerily on tack and sheet.  Such a thing would not be allowed for a single moment on board a British man-o'-war, as the watch singing while they obeyed the orders of the bo'sun's pipe, taking in sail, squaring yards, or doing any other duty required of them.  And yet, with all due respect for my own flag, methinks there are times when, as practised in merchant or passenger ships, that strange, weird, wordless song is not at all an unpleasant sound to listen to.  By night, for instance, after you have turned in to your little narrow bed--the cradle of the deep, in which you are nightly rocked--to hear it rising and falling, and ending in long-drawn cadence, gives one an indescribable feeling of peace and security.  Your bark is all alone--so your thoughts may run--on a wild world of waters.  There may not be another ship within hundreds of miles; the wind may be rising or the wind may be falling--what do you care?  What need you care? There are watchful eyes on deck, there are good men and true overhead, and they seem to sing your cradle hymn, \"La la lee ah,\" and before it is done you are wrapt in that sweetest, that dreamless slumber that landsmen seldom know.  There was one man at least in every watch on board the _Arrandoon_, who usually led the song that accompanied the hauling on a rope, with a sweet, clear tenor voice; you could not have been angry with these men had you been twenty times a man-o'-war's man.  It was about an hour after breakfast, and our boys were lazing below. For some time previous to the working song, there had been perfect silence on board--a silence broken only now and then by a short word of command, a footstep on deck, or the ominous flapping of the canvas aloft, as it shivered for a moment, then filled and swelled out again.  Had you been down below, one sign alone would have told you that something was going to happen--that some change was about to take place. It was this: when everything is going on all right, you hear the almost constant tramp, tramp of the officer of the watch up and down the quarter-deck, but this was absent now, and you would have known without seeing him that he was standing, probably, by the binnacle, his eyes now bent aloft, and now sweeping the horizon, and now and then glancing at the compass.  Then came a word or two of command, given in a quiet, ordinary tone of voice--there was no occasion to howl on this particular morning.  And after this a rush of feet, and next the song, and the bo'sun's pipe. Thus:--  _Song_.--\"La la lee ah, lay la le lo-O.\"  _Spoken_.--\"Hoy!\"  _Boatswain's Pipe_.--\"Whee-e, weet weet weet, wee-e.\"  _Song_.--\"La la lee ah, lay la le lo-O.\"  _Spoken_.--\"Belay!\"  _Boatswain's Pipe_.--\"Wee wee weet weet weet weet, wee-e.\"  _Spoken_.--\"Now lads.\"  _Song_.--\"Lo ah o ee.\"  _Pipe_.--\"Weet weet!\"  Then a hurry-scurrying away forward, a trampling of feet enough to awaken Rip van Winkle, then the bo'sun's pipe _encore_.  Allan straightens his back in his easy-chair--he has been bending over the table, reading the \"Noctes Ambrosianae\"--straightens his back, stretches his arms, and says \"Heigho!\"  Rory is busy arranging some beautiful transparent specimens of animalculae, not bigger than midges, on a piece of black cardboard; he had caught them overnight in a gauze net dragged astern.  He doesn't look up.  Ralph is lying \"tandem\" on a sofa, reading \"Ivanhoe.\"  He won't take his eyes off the book, nor move as much as one drowsy eyelid, but he manages to say,--  \"What are they about on deck, Rory?\"  \"Don't know even a tiny bit,\" says Rory.  \"Rory,\" continues Ralph, in a slightly louder key; \"you're a young man; run up and see.\"  \"Rory won't then,\" says Rory, intent on his work; \"fag for yourself, my lazy boy.\"  \"Oh!\" says Ralph, \"won't you have your ears pulled when I do get up!\"  \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Rory, \"you'll have forgotten all about it long before then.\"  \"Freezing Powders!\" roared Ralph.  The bright-faced though bullet-headed nigger boy introduced in last chapter appeared instantly.  He was dressed in white flannel, braided with blue.  Had he been a sprite, or a djin, he couldn't have popped up with more startling rapidity.  Truth is, the young rascal had been asleep under the table.  \"Off on deck with you, Freezing Powders, and see what's up.\"  Freezing Powders was down again in a moment.  \"Take in all sail, sah! and square de yard; no wind, sah! nebber a puff.\"  It was just as Freezing Powders said, but there was noise enough presently, and puffing too, for steam was got up, and the great screw was churning the waters of the dark northern ocean into creamish foam, as the vessel went steadily ahead at about ten knots an hour.  There was no occasion to hurry.  When Rory and Allan went on deck, they found the captain in consultation with the mates, Mitchell and Stevenson.  \"I must admit,\" McBain was remarking, \"that I can't make it out at all.\"  \"No more can we,\" said Stevenson with a puzzled smile.  \"The wind has failed us all at once, and the sea gone down, and the glass seems to have taken leave of its senses entirely.  It is up one moment high enough for anything, and down the next to 28 degrees.  There, just look at that sea and look at that sky.\"  There was certainly something most appalling in the appearance of both. The ocean was calm and unruffled as glass, with only a long low heave on it; not a ripple on it big enough to swamp a fly; but over it all a strange, glassy lustre that--so you would have thought--could have been skimmed off.  The sky was one mass of dark purple-black clouds in masses.  It seemed no distance overhead, and the horizon looked hardly a mile away on either side.  Only in the north it was one unbroken bluish black, as dark seemingly as night, from the midst of which every now and then, and every here and there, would come quickly a little puff of cloud of a lightish grey colour, as if a gun had been fired.  Only there was no sound.  There was something awe-inspiring in the strange, ominous look of sea and sky, and in the silence broken only by the grind and gride of screw and engine.  \"No,\" said McBain, \"I don't know what we are going to have.  Perhaps a tornado.  Anyhow, Mr Stevenson, let us be ready.  Get down topgallant masts, it will be a bit of exercise for the men; let us have all the steam we can command, and--\"  \"Batten down, sir?\"  \"Yes, Mr Stevenson, batten down, and lash the boats inboard.\"  The good ship _Arrandoon_ was at the time of which I write about fifty miles south of the Faroes, and a long way to the east.  The weather had been dark and somewhat gloomy, from the very time they lost sight of the snow-clad hills around Oban, but it now seemed to culminate in a darkness that could be felt.  The men were well drilled on board this steam yacht.  McBain delighted to have them smart, and it was with surprising celerity that the topgallant masts were lowered, the hatches battened down, and the good ship prepared for any emergency.  None too soon; the darkness grew"]]]
