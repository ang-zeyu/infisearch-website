As the Jewish hierarchy said of Spinoza: \"Let his name be cast out under the whole heavens!\" That name rose again.  Years passed and a nephew of Magellan inherited one of the family estates. He was stoned in the streets on account of his name. This man fled in exile from Portugal to Brazil. He died there, and said: \"Let no heir or descendant of mine ever restore the arms of my family.\"  In his will he wrote:  \"I desire that the arms of my family (Magellan) should remain forever obliterated, as was done by order of my Lord and King, _as a punishment for the crime_ of Ferdinand Magellan, because he entered the service of Castile to the injury of our kingdom.\"  It is the history of this same Ferdinand Magellan, whom Portugal and his own family sought to crush out from the world, that we are now about to trace.  Following his highest inspiration, he shut his eyes to the present, and followed the light of the star of destiny in his soul. His discovery seems to open to the West the doors of China.  He was filled from boyhood with a passion for finding unknown lands and waters; he was haunted by ideals and visions of noble exploits for the good of mankind. His own country, Portugal, would not listen to his projects at the time that he offered them to the court; so, like Columbus, Vespucci, and Cabot, he sought the favor of another country. Nothing could stand before the high purpose of his soul. \"If not by Portugal, then by Spain,\" he said to an intimate friend; meaning that, if his own country denied him the favor of giving him an opportunity for exploration, he would present his cause to the court of Spain, which he did.  This man, whose real name was Fernao de Magalhaes, was born about the year 1480, at Sabrosa, in Portugal, a wintry district where the hardy soil and the \"gloomy grandeur\" of the mountain scenery produced men of strong bodies and lofty spirit. He belonged to a noble family, \"one of the noblest in the kingdom.\" His boyhood was passed in the sierras. He had a love of works of geography and travel, and he dreamed even then of sunny zones, undiscovered waters, and unknown regions of the world. Henry the Navigator and his school of pilots, astronomers, and explorers, had left the country full of the spirit of new discoveries which yet lived.  He went to the capital of Portugal to be educated, and was made a page to the Queen. He was yet a boy when Columbus returned, bringing the enthralling news of a new world. Spain was filled with excitement at the event; her cities rang with jubilees by day and flared with torches at night. Portugal caught the new spirit of her late King, Henry the Navigator, and was ambitious to rival the discoveries of Spain. She had already established herself in the glowing realms of India.  In 1509 Magellan went to the West Indies in the service of the Portuguese Government. He joined the expedition that discovered the Spice Islands of Banda, and it became his conviction that these islands could be reached by a new ocean way.  A great vision arose in his mind. It was a suggestion that never left him until he saw its fulfillment in an unexpected way on seas of which he never had dreamed.  This view was that he could sail around the world and reach the Spice Islands by the way of the West.  [Illustration: Lisbon, from the south bank of the Tagus.]  In the service of the King against the Moors in one of the Portuguese wars, he received a wound which healed, but left him lame for life. He, like other officers, sent in his claim for the pension due to such service. He received answer from the parsimonious King (Dom Manoel):  \"Your claim is not good. Your wound has healed.\"  He was wounded more deeply by this insult than he could have been by any poisoned dart from the Moors. That he should have been refused the recognition of those who had shed blood in his country's cause rankled in his heart, especially as he saw his comrades paraded in honor and pensioned for lesser disabilities. He left Portugal, as an exile, and went to Spain.  Here the high aspirations of the lame soldier met with recognition, and it was this service that caused the Portuguese King to issue the strange order which has introduced the young and high-spirited grandee to the readers of this story.  If he had faults--as far as history records he had no vices--his high aim overcame them. He had caught the spirit of Portuguese Henry the Navigator, and his soul had glowed when the fame of Columbus first thrilled Spain. He had learned the history of Vasco da Gama, whose name was the glory of Portugal. He had educated himself for action.  [Illustration: Ferdinand Magellan. After a painting by Velasquez.]  It was the age of opportunity. He saw it; he could not know the way, but he knew the guide that was in him. As a son of the Church, which he then was, he consecrated all he had to her glory. What was fame, what was wealth, what was anything to becoming a benefactor of the world, and living forever in the heart of all mankind?  So his deserted house crumbed in Sabrosa, and his coat of arms did not there reappear until centuries had followed the course of his genius, and the whole world came to know his worth.  In view of recent events his character becomes one of the most interesting of past history.  After nearly four hundred years that cast-out name rises like a star!  Why, in the view of to-day, was that name cast out?  Because Magellan saw his duty in a larger life than in the restrictions of a provincial court. The lesson has its significance. He who sinks self and policy, and follows his highest duty and enters the widest field, will in the final judgment of man receive the noblest and best reward.  We love a lover of mankind, and it strengthens faith and hope to follow the keel of such a sailor on any sea.     CHAPTER II.  FRIENDS WITH A PURPOSE.   Souls kindle kindred souls, and the inspirations of friendship commonly form a part of the early history of beneficent lives.  One of Magellan's early friends was Francisco Serrao, who sailed with him for Malacca, a great mart of merchandise in the East. It was to him that Magellan wrote that he would meet him again in the East, \"if not by the way of Portugal, by that of Spain;\" words of signal import, which we have already quoted.  Serrao had a very curious, romantic, and pathetic history. He lived in the times of the Portuguese Viceroys of India. He was made captain of a ship which sought to explore the Spice Islands, which were then held to be the paradise of the East. Cloves and nutmegs then were luxuries, and when brought to Portugal bore the flavor of the sun lands of the far-off mysterious seas.  At Banda ships were loaded with spices. On sailing there Serrao suffered shipwreck and was cast upon a reef and found refuge on a deserted island. The place was a resort of pirates or wreckers. Some pirates sighted the wreck of the ship and sought to plunder the wreckage.  \"We have no ship, and the island is without food or water,\" said Serrao to his men. \"Hide under the rock and obey me, and we will soon have a ship and water and food.\"  The men hid among the caverns of the reef. The pirates landed, and left their ship for the wreckage.  Serrao rushed through the surf, followed by his men, and boarded the pirates' vessel.  The wreckers were filled with terror when they saw what would be their fate if left there, and they begged to be taken on board, and were received by Serrao as prisoners.  Serrao traded for many years among the Spice Islands and was advanced to high positions, but was poisoned at last, as is supposed, by an intrigue of the King of Tidor.  One of the most inspiring of Magellan's friends was Ruy Faleiro, who had wonderful instincts and a wide vision, but who became a madman. Faleiro was a Portuguese who, like Magellan, was out of favor with the court. He was an astronomer, a geographer, and an astrologer. He had a fiery and impulsive temper, but with it a passion for discovery, and so was drawn into Magellan's heart by gravitation. The two journeyed together, studied together, and started at about the same time for Spain. At Seville they met in a club of famous discoverers, students, and refugees.  They had one vision in common, that there was a short route to the Moluccas by the way of the West. The route was not what they dreamed it to be; but there was a new way to the Spice Islands by the West and East, a way that probably no voyager from Europe had ever seen, and their vision was decisive of one of the greatest events--the circumnavigation of the world. The angle of vision was not true in their private meetings, nor had Magellan's been before they met; but another angle leading from it was true, and would cause a change of the conception of the world when poor Ruy Faleiro's brain was losing its hold on such entrancing hopes.  \"We can reach Molucca by a short voyage to the West,\" said Ruy Faleiro.  \"I am sure that I can do this, if I can have an expedition such as the King of Spain can give me,\" said Magellan.  \"You must never communicate this secret to any man,\" said Ruy.  \"I will never mention the subject to any but you,\" said Magellan, \"until we can act together.\"  The vision of finding the East by a short passage to the West, involved so great a prospect of human progress and glory that it would not let Magellan rest at any time. It haunted him wherever he went. He began to talk about it under restraint, and friends came to see what was on his mind and to take advantage of it.  [Illustration: The earliest map of the world. By Hecat√¶us of Miletus (sixth century B.C.). Probably copied in part from Anaximander, inventor of map drawing.]  The fiery Ruy Faleiro, when he found that his friend had opened their confidential secret, partly broke friendship with him. Magellan could only acknowledge his error, and say that he never meant in his heart to betray the secrets of his friend, the cosmographer."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37814"],["title","The Story of Magellan and The Discovery of the Philippines (#2)"],["body","dreamed on, but his mind weakened.  The popular legend about this unhappy man was, that being an astrologer he cast his own horoscope, and found that the expedition that he hoped to command would be lost, and so feigned madness. This is only a story.  Faleiro died in Seville about 1523.  It would be interesting to know if he lived to hear of the great discovery of his old friend Magellan, and if he joined in the general rejoicing over it. It is probable that he lived to see the strange ways by which his countryman had been led, not over a short passage, but over far-distant seas. His was a pitiable fate; but his name merits honorable mention among men, who, like Miranda in South America, have inspired great deeds which they themselves could not accomplish.  Men of vision and men of action are essential to each other; for many men can see what only a few others can perform.  Magellan married Beatriz Barbosa about the year 1518. He was the father of one son. His wife died shortly after hearing the news of his great discovery of the Pacific and the new way to the East.  He was now prepared to go to Charles V, King of Spain, son of the demented Queen Joanna, the daughter of Isabella, and to lay before him a plan of opening a short way to the East by sailing West. This purpose more and more absorbed his soul--he himself was nothing, discovery was everything. The frown of Portugal no longer cast any deep shadow over his life; it was his mission to _find_. He heard in the acclaim of Columbus a prophecy of what his own name would one day be.     CHAPTER III.  PRINCE HENRY THE NAVIGATOR AND VASCO DA GAMA.   All things follow suggestion and inspiration, and the discovery of the Western World owes much to the heart and brain of Prince Henry, called the Navigator. Although the son of a King, he felt that he was more than that--a son of Humanity. He took up his residence far from the pomp of courts on the bleak, bare, solitary promontory of Sagres, the sharp angle of Western Europe. Here he could see the sun go down on the western sea, day by day. Some inward genius like a haunting spirit seemed to beckon his thoughts toward the West.  In view of his abode on a tall headland were the ruins of a Druidical temple, where Strabo tells us the gods used to assemble at night under the moon and stars. So the place was called the Sacrum Promontorium, and it was in this region that Prince Henry schooled his soul in navigation and sought to inspire all adventurers upon the sea. \"Farther\" was his motto, and \"Farther yet!\" In his solitude he called to him a company of restless spirits with a passion for discovery, and said to them all, \"Farther,\" and \"Farther yet!\"  The night of the dark ages was passing, and in the new dawn of civilization, Prince Henry had visions of new ways to India, the magnificent; the land of gold, gems, and spices, where the sun shone on gardens of palms and seas of glory.  There were no lighthouses then on the African coast; there were no sea charts, and the compass was but little known. But there were eternal stars, and under them were the living instincts that awaken genius.  Prince Henry the Navigator was the fourth son of King Joao I, or John the Great, and of Queen Philippa, of the Roses. He was a great-grandson of Edward III, of England.  Prince Henry's motto was \"_Talent de bien faire_\"--\"talent of good faculty.\" The motto furnishes in brief a history of his life.  The first fruit of Prince Henry's geographical studies was the discovery of the islands of Madeira; but there were islands beyond Madeira, and his restless spirit cried out in the night: \"Farther!\" and \"Farther yet!\"  Cape Bojador, farther \"than the farthest point of the earth,\" rose just before the supposed regions of sea monsters, fire, and darkness. Prince John sent a navigator there, and found serene seas.  [Illustration: PROGRESS OF PORTUGUESE DISCOVERY]  \"Farther!\"  In 1446 the Prince obtained a charter of the Canary Islands. His ships next discovered the Azores. But there were lands and islands and seas \"farther yet.\"  [Illustration: Prince Henry the Navigator. From a drawing by Allegra Eggleston, in The Story of Columbus.]  Prince Henry died in 1463, about thirty years before the triumph of Columbus.  He was the father of modern discovery, the spirit of which rested not until the map of the whole world could be drawn. He was buried in a splendid tomb, and the pupils of his school of cosmography and navigation continued to penetrate the ocean farther and farther to the South and West. Vasco da Gama opened the ocean ways to India, and the two great navigators, Columbus and Magellan, owed much to the spirit of the Prince who left courts that he might found a school amid the sea desolations of St. Vincent, in order to inspire young sailors to venture always \"Farther!\" and \"Farther yet!\"  [Illustration: \"He is a renegade. His arms must come down!\" (See page 2.)]  We must here tell you something of Vasco da Gama, in order that you may better understand the plan and purpose of Magellan.  Take your map of the world. Before the passage to India was discovered by sailing around the Cape of Good Hope, Africa, the trade between Asia and Europe was carried on in this manner: There was a great commercial city on the southern coast of Arabia (Arabia Felix) called Alda, or Port Alda. It was a city of merchants. To this port came the ships from the East--China, Japan, India--laden with gold, silk, and spices. The merchants of Alda carried these goods to the Port of Suez on the Red Sea. Thence the merchandise was conveyed on camels to the Nile and to Alexandria, Egypt, and thence by ships to the ports of the Mediterranean.  Vasco da Gama discovered a new way to India by doubling the Cape of Good Hope, and when he returned from that voyage all Europe rang with his praise. His discovery of the way to India from the Mediterranean by rounding Africa was one of the most momentous ever made. Vasco da Gama holds rank with Columbus in the unveiling of the mysteries of the ocean world.  King John the Navigator had heard such wonderful tales of India that he wished to find a way there by water. He accordingly sent one Bartholomeu Diaz on an expedition with this end in view. Diaz did not find India, but he found a cape on the southernmost point of Africa, which he doubled.  So fearful were the tempests there that he called it the Cape of Storms.  But King John saw that the islands of India lay in that direction, and he exclaimed in delight on hearing Diaz's narrative of the tempestuous place:  \"'Tis the Cape of Good Hope!\" This gave the cape its name.  A Jewish astrologer told Dom Manoel, King of Portugal, that the riches of India could yet be found by way of the sea. Of such a discovery the new King dreamed. Who should he get to undertake a voyage with such a purpose?  One day, as he sat in his halls among his courtiers and grandees studying maps, a man of about thirty years, who had a noble bearing, entered an outer apartment. A sword hung by his side.  The King, who had been thinking of his great mariners, lifted his face and said:  \"Thank God! I have found my man. Bring to me Vasco da Gama.\"  He it was that stood in the outer hall.  \"Vasco,\" said the King, \"I know your soul. For the glory of Portugal you must find India by the way of the sea!\"  \"I am at your service, sire, while life shall last.\"  \"Depart in all haste.\"  It was March, 1497. Vasco da Gama raised his sails and departed from Lisbon.  [Illustration: Vasco da Gama.]  He passed the \"Cape of Good Hope,\" and met with many adventures, the narratives of which would fill a book.  He crossed the India Ocean, blown pleasantly on by the trade winds.  One day a loud cry arose:  \"Land! land!\"  The pilot came running to Vasco da Gama, and fell at his feet.  \"Captain, behold India!\"  The shores of India rose in the burning light of the tropic seas. Vasco da Gama saw them and fell upon his knees.  Mountain rose above mountain, and hill over hill; then green palms and shining beaches came into view like scenes of enchantment.  \"That is Cananor,\" said the Moorish pilot; \"the great city of Calicat is twelve leagues distant.\"  They sailed over those twelve leagues of clear resplendent waters and came to Calicat, or Malabar. That day of discovery was Portugal's glory.  [Illustration: PORTUGUESE INDIES]  Calicat was a merchant city of the East, and one of the most famous of India. Here came Arabian and Egyptian merchants. It was a Mohammedan city, and the princes of Calicat encouraged trade between the Arabs and Hindoos. The city was now to become an emporium for the Western World.  After many adventures in Malabar, Vasco da Gama cruised along the coast of India. Everything was wonderful, and the wonders grew.  In September, 1499, he returned, and was received like a sovereign by the Portuguese King. His arrival was a holiday, the glory of which has lived in all Portuguese holidays until now.  He was given titles of distinction. He was made a Viceroy of India.  Twenty years after these events Magellan was destined to discover _another_ way to India.     CHAPTER IV.  THE ENTHUSIASTS CARRY THEIR PLANS TO THE KING.   Magellan, full of his project of finding a short way to the rich spicery by sailing West, now sought the favor of the Spanish court. Gold has ever been the royal want, and nobles have always had open ears to schemes that promised to fill the public treasury.  Magellan's interesting friend Francisco Serrao, who had remained in the Indian possessions of the Portuguese, after Magellan's return, had discovered resources of the tropical seas of the Orient that were almost boundless. He had written to Magellan:  \"If you would become rich return to the Moluccas.\"  This letter would be a sufficient passport to the nobles who had the ear of the King. He showed the letter to the King's ministers.  He thought that the point of South America turned _westward_, as the Cape of Good Hope toward the East. He had an"]]]
