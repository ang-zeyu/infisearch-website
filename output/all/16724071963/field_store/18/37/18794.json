This scratch, undeniably fresh, had for him a signification that escaped the others. He said to himself, “This confirms my suspicions. If the cashier had stolen millions, there was no occasion for his being in a hurry; whereas the banker, creeping down in the dead of night with cat-like footsteps, for fear of awakening the boy in the ante-room, in order to rifle his own money-safe, had every reason to tremble, to hurry, to hastily withdraw the key, which, slipping along the lock, scratched off the varnish.”  Resolved to unravel by himself the tangled thread of this mystery, the detective determined to keep his conjectures to himself; for the same reason he was silent as to the interview which he had overheard between Madeleine and Prosper.  He hastened to withdraw attention from the scratch upon the lock.  “To conclude,” he said, addressing the commissary, “I am convinced that no one outside of the bank could have obtained access to this room. The safe, moreover, is intact. No suspicious pressure has been used on the movable buttons. I can assert that the lock has not been tampered with by burglar’s tools or false keys. Those who opened the safe knew the word, and possessed the key.”  This formal affirmation of a man whom he knew to be skilful ended the hesitation of the commissary.  “That being the case,” he replied, “I must request a few moments’ conversation with M. Fauvel.”  “I am at your service,” said the banker.  Prosper foresaw the result of this conversation. He quietly placed his hat on the table, to show that he had no intention of attempting to escape, and passed into the adjoining room.  Fanferlot also went out, but not before the commissary had made him a sign, and received one in return.  This sign signified, “You are responsible for this man.”  The detective needed no admonition to make him keep a strict watch. His suspicions were too vague, his desire for success was too ardent, for him to lose sight of Prosper an instant.  Closely following the cashier, he seated himself in a dark corner of the room, and, pretending to be sleepy, he fixed himself in a comfortable position for taking a nap, gaped until his jaw-bone seemed about to be dislocated, then closed his eyes, and kept perfectly quiet.  Prosper took a seat at the desk of an absent clerk. The others were burning to know the result of the investigation; their eyes shone with curiosity, but they dared not ask a question.  Unable to refrain himself any longer, little Cavaillon, Prosper’s defender, ventured to say:  “Well, who stole the money?”  Prosper shrugged his shoulders.  “Nobody knows,” he replied.  Was this conscious innocence or hardened recklessness? The clerks observed with bewildered surprise that Prosper had resumed his usual manner, that sort of icy haughtiness that kept people at a distance, and made him so unpopular in the bank.  Save the death-like pallor of his face, and the dark circles around his swollen eyes, he bore no traces of the pitiable agitation he had exhibited a short time before.  Never would a stranger entering the room have supposed that this young man idly lounging in a chair, and toying with a pencil, was resting under an accusation of robbery, and was about to be arrested.  He soon stopped playing with the pencil, and drew toward him a sheet of paper upon which he hastily wrote a few lines.  “Ah, ha!” thought Fanferlot the Squirrel, whose hearing and sight were wonderfully good in spite of his profound sleep, “eh! eh! he makes his little confidential communication on paper, I see; now we will discover something positive.”  His note written, Prosper folded it carefully into the smallest possible size, and after furtively glancing toward the detective, who remained motionless in his corner, threw it across the desk to little Cavaillon with this one word:  “Gypsy!”  All this was so quickly and skilfully done that Fanferlot was confounded, and began to feel a little uneasy.  “The devil take him!” said he to himself; “for a suffering innocent this young dandy has more pluck and nerve than many of my oldest customers. This, however, shows the result of education!”  Yes: innocent or guilty, Prosper must have been endowed with great self-control and power of dissimulation to affect this presence of mind at a time when his honor, his future happiness, all that he held dear in life, were at stake. And he was only thirty years old.  Either from natural deference, or from the hope of gaining some ray of light by a private conversation, the commissary determined to speak to the banker before acting decisively.  “There is not a shadow of doubt, monsieur,” he said, as soon as they were alone, “this young man has robbed you. It would be a gross neglect of duty if I did not secure his person. The law will decide whether he shall be released, or sent to prison.”  The declaration seemed to distress the banker.  He sank into a chair, and murmured:  “Poor Prosper!”  Seeing the astonished look of his listener, he added:  “Until to-day, monsieur, I have always had the most implicit faith in his honesty, and would have unhesitatingly confided my fortune to his keeping. Almost on my knees have I besought and implored him to confess that in a moment of desperation he had taken the money, promising him pardon and forgetfulness; but I could not move him. I have loved him; and even now, in spite of the trouble and humiliation that he is bringing upon me, I cannot bring myself to feel harshly toward him.”  The commissary looked as if he did not understand.  “What do you mean by humiliation, monsieur?”  “What!” said M. Fauvel, excitedly; “is not justice the same for all? Because I am the head of a bank, and he only a clerk, does it follow that my word is more to be relied upon than his? Why could I not have robbed myself? Such things have been done. They will ask me for facts; and I shall be compelled to expose the exact situation of my house, explain my affairs, disclose the secret and method of my operations.”  “It is true, monsieur, that you will be called upon for some explanation; but your well-known integrity--”  “Alas! He was honest, too. His integrity has never been doubted. Who would have been suspected this morning if I had not been able to instantly produce a hundred thousand crowns? Who would be suspected if I could not prove that my assets exceed my liabilities by more than three millions?”  To a strictly honorable man, the thought, the possibility of suspicion tarnishing his fair name, is cruel suffering. The banker suffered, and the commissary of police saw it, and felt for him.  “Be calm, monsieur,” said he; “before the end of a week justice will have collected sufficient proof to establish the guilt of this unfortunate man, whom we may now recall.”  Prosper entered with Fanferlot, whom they had much trouble to awaken, and with the most stolid indifference listened to the announcement of his arrest.  In response, he calmly said:  “I swear that I am innocent.”  M. Fauvel, much more disturbed and excited than his cashier, made a last attempt.  “It is not too late yet, poor boy,” he said: “for Heaven’s sake reflect----”  Prosper did not appear to hear him. He drew from his pocket a small key, which he laid on the table, and said:  “Here is the key of your safe, monsieur. I hope for my sake that you will some day be convinced of my innocence; and I hope for your sake that the conviction will not come too late.”  Then, as everyone was silent, he resumed:  “Before leaving I hand over to you the books, papers, and accounts necessary for my successor. I must at the same time inform you that, without speaking of the stolen three hundred and fifty thousand francs, I leave a deficit in cash.”  “A deficit!” This ominous word from the lips of a cashier fell like a bombshell upon the ears of Prosper’s hearers.  His declaration was interpreted in divers ways.  “A deficit!” thought the commissary: “how, after this, can his guilt be doubted? Before stealing this whole contents of the safe, he has kept his hand in by occasional small thefts.”  “A deficit!” said the detective to himself, “now, no doubt, the very innocence of this poor devil gives his conduct an appearance of great depravity; were he guilty, he would have replaced the first money by a portion of the second.”  The grave importance of Prosper’s statement was considerably diminished by the explanation he proceeded to make.  “There is a deficit of three thousand five hundred francs on my cash account, which has been disposed of in the following manner: two thousand taken by myself in advance on my salary; fifteen hundred advanced to several of my fellow-clerks. This is the last day of the month; to-morrow the salaries will be paid, consequently--”  The commissary interrupted him:  “Were you authorized to draw money whenever you wished to advance the clerks’ pay?”  “No; but I knew that M. Fauvel would not have refused me permission to oblige my friends in the bank. What I did is done everywhere; I have simply followed my predecessor’s example.”  The banker made a sign of assent.  “As regards that spent by myself,” continued the cashier, “I had a sort of right to it, all of my savings being deposited in this bank; about fifteen thousand francs.”  “That is true,” said M. Fauvel; “M. Bertomy has at least that amount on deposit.”  This last question settled, the commissary’s errand was over, and his report might now be made. He announced his"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3803"],["title","File No. 113 (#5)"],["body","of leaving, and ordered to cashier to prepare to follow him.  Usually, this moment when stern reality stares us in the face, when our individuality is lost and we feel that we are being deprived of our liberty, this moment is terrible.  At this fatal command, “Follow me,” which brings before our eyes the yawning prison gates, the most hardened sinner feels his courage fail, and abjectly begs for mercy.  But Prosper lost none of that studied phlegm which the commissary of police secretly pronounced consummate impudence.  Slowly, with as much careless ease as if going to breakfast with a friend, he smoothed his hair, drew on his overcoat and gloves, and said, politely:  “I am ready to accompany you, monsieur.”  The commissary folded up his pocket-book, and bowed to M. Fauvel, saying to Prosper:  “Come!”  They left the room, and with a distressed face, and eyes filled with tears that he could not restrain, the banker stood watching their retreating forms.  “Good Heaven!” he exclaimed: “gladly would I give twice that sum to regain my old confidence in poor Prosper, and be able to keep him with me!”  The quick-eared Fanferlot overheard these words, and prompted to suspicion, and ever disposed to impute to others the deep astuteness peculiar to himself, was convinced they had been uttered for his benefit.  He had remained behind the others under pretext of looking for an imaginary umbrella, and, as he reluctantly departed, said he would call in again to see if it had been found.  It was Fanferlot’s task to escort Prosper to prison; but, as they were about starting, he asked the commissary to leave him at liberty to pursue another course, a request which his superior granted.  Fanferlot had resolved to obtain possession of Prosper’s note, which he knew to be in Cavaillon’s pocket.  To obtain this written proof, which must be an important one, appeared the easiest thing in the world. He had simply to arrest Cavaillon, frighten him, demand the letter, and, if necessary, take it by force.  But to what would this disturbance lead? To nothing unless it were an incomplete and doubtful result.  Fanferlot was convinced that the note was intended, not for the young clerk, but for a third person.  If exasperated, Cavaillon might refuse to divulge who this person was, who after all might not bear the name “Gypsy” given by the cashier. And, even if he did answer his questions, would he not lie?  After a mature reflection, Fanferlot decided that it would be superfluous to ask for a secret when it could be surprised. To quietly follow Cavaillon, and keep close watch on him until he caught him in the very act of handing over the letter, was but play for the detective.  This method of proceeding, moreover, was much more in keeping with the character of Fanferlot, who, being naturally soft and stealthy, deemed it due to his profession to avoid all disturbance or anything resembling evidence.  Fanferlot’s plan was settled when he reached the vestibule.  He began talking with an office-boy, and, after a few apparently idle questions, had discovered that the Fauvel bank had no outlet on the Rue de la Victoire, and that consequently all the clerks were obliged to pass in and out through the main entrance on the Rue de Provence.  From this moment the task he had undertaken no longer presented a shadow of difficulty. He rapidly crossed the street, and took up his position under a gateway.  His post of observation was admirably chosen; not only could he see everyone who entered and came out of the bank, but also commanded a view of all the windows, and by standing on tiptoe could look through the grating, and see Cavaillon bending over his desk.  Fanferlot waited a long time, but did not wax impatient, for he had often had to remain on watch entire days and nights at a time, with much less important objects in view than the present one. Besides, his mind was busily occupied in estimating the value of his discoveries, weighing his chances, and, like Perrette with her pot of milk, building the foundation of his fortune upon present success.  Finally, about one o’clock, he saw Cavaillon rise from his desk, change his coat, and take down his hat.  “Very good!” he exclaimed, “my man is coming out; I must keep my eyes open.”  The next moment Cavaillon appeared at the door of the bank; but before stepping on the pavement he looked up and down the street in an undecided manner.  “Can he suspect anything?” thought Fanferlot.  No, the young clerk suspected nothing; only having a commission to execute, and fearing his absence would be observed, he was debating with himself which would be the shortest road for him to take.  He soon decided, entered the Faubourg Montmartre, and walked up the Rue Notre Dame de Lorette so rapidly, utterly regardless of the grumbling passers-by whom he elbowed out of his way, that Fanferlot found it difficult to keep him in sight.  Reaching the Rue Chaptal, Cavaillon suddenly stopped, and entered the house numbered 39.  He had scarcely taken three steps in the narrow corridor when he felt a touch on his shoulder, and turning abruptly, found himself face to face with Fanferlot.  He recognized him at once, and turning very pale he shrank back, and looked around for means of escape.  But the detective, anticipating the attempt, barred the passage-way. Cavaillon saw that he was fairly caught.  “What do you want with me?” he asked in a voice tremulous with fright.  Fanferlot was distinguished among his confreres for his exquisite suavity and unequalled urbanity. Even with his prisoners he was the perfection of courtesy, and never was known to handcuff a man without first obsequiously apologizing for being compelled to do so.  “You will be kind enough, my dear monsieur,” he said, “to excuse the great liberty I take; but I really am under the necessity of asking you for a little information.”  “Information! From me, monsieur?”  “From you, my dear monsieur; from M. Eugene Cavaillon.”  “But I do not know you.”  “Ah, yes; you remember seeing me this morning. It is only about a trifling matter, and you will overwhelm me with obligations if you will do me the honor to accept my arm, and step outside for a moment.”  What could Cavaillon do? He took Fanferlot’s arm, and went out with him.  The Rue Chaptal is not one of those noisy thoroughfares where foot-passengers are in perpetual danger of being run over by numberless vehicles dashing to and fro; there were but two or three shops, and from the corner of Rue Fontaine occupied by an apothecary, to the entrance of the Rue Leonie, extended a high, gloomy wall, broken here and there by a small window which lighted the carpenters’ shops behind.  It was one of those streets where you could talk at your ease, without having to step from the sidewalk every moment. So Fanferlot and Cavaillon were in no danger of being disturbed by passers-by.  “What I wished to say is, my dear monsieur,” began the detective, “that M. Prosper Bertomy threw you a note this morning.”  Cavaillon vaguely foresaw that he was to be questioned about this note, and instantly put himself on his guard.  “You are mistaken,” he said, blushing to his ears.  “Excuse me, monsieur, for presuming to contradict you, but I am quite certain of what I say.”  “I assure you that Prosper never gave me anything.”  “Pray, monsieur, do not persist in a denial; you will compel me to prove that four clerks saw him throw you a note written in pencil and closely folded.”  Cavaillon saw the folly of further contradicting a man so well informed; so he changed his tactics, and said:  “It is true Prosper gave me a note this morning; but it was intended for me alone, and after reading it I tore it up, and threw the pieces in the fire.”  This might be the truth. Fanferlot feared so; but how could he assure himself of the fact? He remembered that the most palpable tricks often succeed the best, and trusting to his star, he said at hazard:  “Permit me to observe that this statement is not correct; the note was intrusted to you to give to Gypsy.”  A despairing gesture from Cavaillon apprised the detective that he was not mistaken; he breathed again.  “I swear to you, monsieur,” began the young man.  “Do not swear, monsieur,” interrupted Fanferlot; “all the oaths in the world would be useless. You not only preserved the note, but you came to this house for the purpose of giving it to Gypsy, and it is in your pocket now.”  “No, monsieur, no!”  Fanferlot paid no attention to this denial, but continued in his gentlest tone:  “And I am sure you will be kind enough to give it to me; believe me, nothing but the most absolute necessity--”  “Never!” exclaimed Cavaillon; and, believing the moment favorable, he suddenly attempted to jerk his arm from under Fanferlot’s, and escape.  But his efforts were vain; the detective’s strength was equal to his suavity.  “Don’t hurt yourself, young man,” he said, “but take my advice, and quietly give up the letter.”  “I have not got it.”  “Very well; see, you reduce me to painful extremities. If you persist in being so obstinate, I shall call two policemen, who will take you by each arm, and escort you to the commissary of police; and, once there, I shall be under the painful necessity of searching your pockets, whether you will or not.”  Cavaillon was devoted to Prosper, and willing to make any sacrifice in his behalf; but he clearly saw that it was worse than useless to struggle any longer, as he would have no time to destroy the note. To deliver it under force was no betrayal; but he cursed his powerlessness, and almost wept with rage.  “I am in your power,” he said, and then suddenly drew from his pocket-book the unlucky note, and gave it to the detective.  Fanferlot trembled with pleasure as he unfolded the paper; yet, faithful to his habits of fastidious politeness, before reading it, he bowed to Cavaillon, and said:  “You will permit me, will you not, monsieur?” Then he read as follows:   “DEAR NINA--If you"]]]
