We are thus brought to the theory that the law is an empirical generalisation, which is the view held by Mill.  But if so, how are empirical generalisations to be justified? The evidence in their favour cannot be empirical, since we wish to argue from what has been observed to what has not been observed, which can only be done by means of some known relation of the observed and the unobserved; but the unobserved, by definition, is not known empirically, and therefore its relation to the observed, if known at all, must be known independently of empirical evidence. Let us see what Mill says on this subject.  According to Mill, the law of causation is proved by an admittedly fallible process called \"induction by simple enumeration.\" This process, he says, \"consists in ascribing the nature of general truths to all propositions which are true in every instance that we happen to know of.\"[8] As regards its fallibility, he asserts that \"the precariousness of the method of simple enumeration is in an inverse ratio to the largeness of the generalisation. The process is delusive and insufficient, exactly in proportion as the subject-matter of the observation is special and limited in extent. As the sphere widens, this unscientific method becomes less and less liable to mislead; and the most universal class of truths, the law of causation for instance, and the principles of number and of geometry, are duly and satisfactorily proved by that method alone, nor are they susceptible of any other proof.\"[9]    [8] _Logic_, book iii., chapter iii., § 2.    [9] Book iii., chapter xxi., § 3.  In the above statement, there are two obvious lacunæ: (1) How is the method of simple enumeration itself justified? (2) What logical principle, if any, covers the same ground as this method, without being liable to its failures? Let us take the second question first.  A method of proof which, when used as directed, gives sometimes truth and sometimes falsehood--as the method of simple enumeration does--is obviously not a valid method, for validity demands invariable truth. Thus, if simple enumeration is to be rendered valid, it must not be stated as Mill states it. We shall have to say, at most, that the data render the result _probable_. Causation holds, we shall say, in every instance we have been able to test; therefore it _probably_ holds in untested instances. There are terrible difficulties in the notion of probability, but we may ignore them at present. We thus have what at least _may_ be a logical principle, since it is without exception. If a proposition is true in every instance that we happen to know of, and if the instances are very numerous, then, we shall say, it becomes very probable, on the data, that it will be true in any further instance. This is not refuted by the fact that what we declare to be probable does not always happen, for an event may be probable on the data and yet not occur. It is, however, obviously capable of further analysis, and of more exact statement. We shall have to say something like this: that every instance of a proposition[10] being true increases the probability of its being true in a fresh instance, and that a sufficient number of favourable instances will, in the absence of instances to the contrary, make the probability of the truth of a fresh instance approach indefinitely near to certainty. Some such principle as this is required if the method of simple enumeration is to be valid.    [10] Or rather a propositional function.  But this brings us to our other question, namely, how is our principle known to be true? Obviously, since it is required to justify induction, it cannot be proved by induction; since it goes beyond the empirical data, it cannot be proved by them alone; since it is required to justify all inferences from empirical data to what goes beyond them, it cannot itself be even rendered in any degree probable by such data. Hence, _if_ it is known, it is not known by experience, but independently of experience. I do not say that any such principle is known: I only say that it is required to justify the inferences from experience which empiricists allow, and that it cannot itself be justified empirically.[11]    [11] The subject of causality and induction will be discussed again in   Lecture VIII.  A similar conclusion can be proved by similar arguments concerning any other logical principle. Thus logical knowledge is not derivable from experience alone, and the empiricist's philosophy can therefore not be accepted in its entirety, in spite of its excellence in many matters which lie outside logic.  Hegel and his followers widened the scope of logic in quite a different way--a way which I believe to be fallacious, but which requires discussion if only to show how their conception of logic differs from the conception which I wish to advocate. In their writings, logic is practically identical with metaphysics. In broad outline, the way this came about is as follows. Hegel believed that, by means of _a priori_ reasoning, it could be shown that the world _must_ have various important and interesting characteristics, since any world without these characteristics would be impossible and self-contradictory. Thus what he calls \"logic\" is an investigation of the nature of the universe, in so far as this can be inferred merely from the principle that the universe must be logically self-consistent. I do not myself believe that from this principle alone anything of importance can be inferred as regards the existing universe. But, however that may be, I should not regard Hegel's reasoning, even if it were valid, as properly belonging to logic: it would rather be an application of logic to the actual world. Logic itself would be concerned rather with such questions as what self-consistency is, which Hegel, so far as I know, does not discuss. And though he criticises the traditional logic, and professes to replace it by an improved logic of his own, there is some sense in which the traditional logic, with all its faults, is uncritically and unconsciously assumed throughout his reasoning. It is not in the direction advocated by him, it seems to me, that the reform of logic is to be sought, but by a more fundamental, more patient, and less ambitious investigation into the presuppositions which his system shares with those of most other philosophers.  The way in which, as it seems to me, Hegel's system assumes the ordinary logic which it subsequently criticises, is exemplified by the general conception of \"categories\" with which he operates throughout. This conception is, I think, essentially a product of logical confusion, but it seems in some way to stand for the conception of \"qualities of Reality as a whole.\" Mr Bradley has worked out a theory according to which, in all judgment, we are ascribing a predicate to Reality as a whole; and this theory is derived from Hegel. Now the traditional logic holds that every proposition ascribes a predicate to a subject, and from this it easily follows that there can be only one subject, the Absolute, for if there were two, the proposition that there were two would not ascribe a predicate to either. Thus Hegel's doctrine, that philosophical propositions must be of the form, \"the Absolute is such-and-such,\" depends upon the traditional belief in the universality of the subject-predicate form. This belief, being traditional, scarcely self-conscious, and not supposed to be important, operates underground, and is assumed in arguments which, like the refutation of relations, appear at first sight such as to establish its truth. This is the most important respect in which Hegel uncritically assumes the traditional logic. Other less important respects--though important enough to be the source of such essentially Hegelian conceptions as the \"concrete universal\" and the \"union of identity in difference\"--will be found where he explicitly deals with formal logic.[12]    [12] See the translation by H. S. Macran, _Hegel's Doctrine of Formal   Logic_, Oxford, 1912. Hegel's argument in this portion of his \"Logic\"   depends throughout upon confusing the \"is\" of predication, as in   \"Socrates is mortal,\" with the \"is\" of identity, as in \"Socrates is   the philosopher who drank the hemlock.\" Owing to this confusion, he   thinks that \"Socrates\" and \"mortal\" must be identical. Seeing that   they are different, he does not infer, as others would, that there is   a mistake somewhere, but that they exhibit \"identity in difference.\"   Again, Socrates is particular, \"mortal\" is universal. Therefore, he   says, since Socrates is mortal, it follows that the particular is the   universal--taking the \"is\" to be throughout expressive of identity.   But to say \"the particular is the universal\" is self-contradictory.   Again Hegel does not suspect a mistake but proceeds to synthesise   particular and universal in the individual, or concrete universal.   This is an example of how, for want of care at the start, vast and   imposing systems of philosophy are built upon stupid and trivial   confusions, which, but for the almost incredible fact that they are   unintentional, one would be tempted to characterise as puns.  There is quite another direction in which a large technical development of logic has taken place: I mean the direction of what is called logistic or mathematical logic. This kind of logic is mathematical in two different senses: it is itself a branch of mathematics, and it is the logic which is specially applicable to other more traditional branches of mathematics. Historically, it began as _merely_ a branch of mathematics: its special applicability to other branches is a more recent development. In both respects, it is the fulfilment of a hope which Leibniz"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/37090"],["title","Our Knowledge of the External World as a Field for Scientific Method in (#7)"],["body","throughout his life, and pursued with all the ardour of his amazing intellectual energy. Much of his work on this subject has been published recently, since his discoveries have been remade by others; but none was published by him, because his results persisted in contradicting certain points in the traditional doctrine of the syllogism. We now know that on these points the traditional doctrine is wrong, but respect for Aristotle prevented Leibniz from realising that this was possible.[13]    [13] _Cf._ Couturat, _La Logique de Leibniz_, pp. 361, 386.  The modern development of mathematical logic dates from Boole's _Laws of Thought_ (1854). But in him and his successors, before Peano and Frege, the only thing really achieved, apart from certain details, was the invention of a mathematical symbolism for deducing consequences from the premisses which the newer methods shared with those of Aristotle. This subject has considerable interest as an independent branch of mathematics, but it has very little to do with real logic. The first serious advance in real logic since the time of the Greeks was made independently by Peano and Frege--both mathematicians. They both arrived at their logical results by an analysis of mathematics. Traditional logic regarded the two propositions, \"Socrates is mortal\" and \"All men are mortal,\" as being of the same form;[14] Peano and Frege showed that they are utterly different in form. The philosophical importance of logic may be illustrated by the fact that this confusion--which is still committed by most writers--obscured not only the whole study of the forms of judgment and inference, but also the relations of things to their qualities, of concrete existence to abstract concepts, and of the world of sense to the world of Platonic ideas. Peano and Frege, who pointed out the error, did so for technical reasons, and applied their logic mainly to technical developments; but the philosophical importance of the advance which they made is impossible to exaggerate.    [14] It was often recognised that there was _some_ difference between   them, but it was not recognised that the difference is fundamental,   and of very great importance.  Mathematical logic, even in its most modern form, is not _directly_ of philosophical importance except in its beginnings. After the beginnings, it belongs rather to mathematics than to philosophy. Of its beginnings, which are the only part of it that can properly be called _philosophical_ logic, I shall speak shortly. But even the later developments, though not directly philosophical, will be found of great indirect use in philosophising. They enable us to deal easily with more abstract conceptions than merely verbal reasoning can enumerate; they suggest fruitful hypotheses which otherwise could hardly be thought of; and they enable us to see quickly what is the smallest store of materials with which a given logical or scientific edifice can be constructed. Not only Frege's theory of number, which we shall deal with in Lecture VII., but the whole theory of physical concepts which will be outlined in our next two lectures, is inspired by mathematical logic, and could never have been imagined without it.  In both these cases, and in many others, we shall appeal to a certain principle called \"the principle of abstraction.\" This principle, which might equally well be called \"the principle which dispenses with abstraction,\" and is one which clears away incredible accumulations of metaphysical lumber, was directly suggested by mathematical logic, and could hardly have been proved or practically used without its help. The principle will be explained in our fourth lecture, but its use may be briefly indicated in advance. When a group of objects have that kind of similarity which we are inclined to attribute to possession of a common quality, the principle in question shows that membership of the group will serve all the purposes of the supposed common quality, and that therefore, unless some common quality is actually known, the group or class of similar objects may be used to replace the common quality, which need not be assumed to exist. In this and other ways, the indirect uses of even the later parts of mathematical logic are very great; but it is now time to turn our attention to its philosophical foundations.  In every proposition and in every inference there is, besides the particular subject-matter concerned, a certain _form_, a way in which the constituents of the proposition or inference are put together. If I say, \"Socrates is mortal,\" \"Jones is angry,\" \"The sun is hot,\" there is something in common in these three cases, something indicated by the word \"is.\" What is in common is the _form_ of the proposition, not an actual constituent. If I say a number of things about Socrates--that he was an Athenian, that he married Xantippe, that he drank the hemlock--there is a common constituent, namely Socrates, in all the propositions I enunciate, but they have diverse forms. If, on the other hand, I take any one of these propositions and replace its constituents, one at a time, by other constituents, the form remains constant, but no constituent remains. Take (say) the series of propositions, \"Socrates drank the hemlock,\" \"Coleridge drank the hemlock,\" \"Coleridge drank opium,\" \"Coleridge ate opium.\" The form remains unchanged throughout this series, but all the constituents are altered. Thus form is not another constituent, but is the way the constituents are put together. It is forms, in this sense, that are the proper object of philosophical logic.  It is obvious that the knowledge of logical forms is something quite different from knowledge of existing things. The form of \"Socrates drank the hemlock\" is not an existing thing like Socrates or the hemlock, nor does it even have that close relation to existing things that drinking has. It is something altogether more abstract and remote. We might understand all the separate words of a sentence without understanding the sentence: if a sentence is long and complicated, this is apt to happen. In such a case we have knowledge of the constituents, but not of the form. We may also have knowledge of the form without having knowledge of the constituents. If I say, \"Rorarius drank the hemlock,\" those among you who have never heard of Rorarius (supposing there are any) will understand the form, without having knowledge of all the constituents. In order to understand a sentence, it is necessary to have knowledge both of the constituents and of the particular instance of the form. It is in this way that a sentence conveys information, since it tells us that certain known objects are related according to a certain known form. Thus some kind of knowledge of logical forms, though with most people it is not explicit, is involved in all understanding of discourse. It is the business of philosophical logic to extract this knowledge from its concrete integuments, and to render it explicit and pure.  In all inference, form alone is essential: the particular subject-matter is irrelevant except as securing the truth of the premisses. This is one reason for the great importance of logical form. When I say, \"Socrates was a man, all men are mortal, therefore Socrates was mortal,\" the connection of premisses and conclusion does not in any way depend upon its being Socrates and man and mortality that I am mentioning. The general form of the inference may be expressed in some such words as, \"If a thing has a certain property, and whatever has this property has a certain other property, then the thing in question also has that other property.\" Here no particular things or properties are mentioned: the proposition is absolutely general. All inferences, when stated fully, are instances of propositions having this kind of generality. If they seem to depend upon the subject-matter otherwise than as regards the truth of the premisses, that is because the premisses have not been all explicitly stated. In logic, it is a waste of time to deal with inferences concerning particular cases: we deal throughout with completely general and purely formal implications, leaving it to other sciences to discover when the hypotheses are verified and when they are not.  But the forms of propositions giving rise to inferences are not the simplest forms: they are always hypothetical, stating that if one proposition is true, then so is another. Before considering inference, therefore, logic must consider those simpler forms which inference presupposes. Here the traditional logic failed completely: it believed that there was only one form of simple proposition (_i.e._ of proposition not stating a relation between two or more other propositions), namely, the form which ascribes a predicate to a subject. This is the appropriate form in assigning the qualities of a given thing--we may say \"this thing is round, and red, and so on.\" Grammar favours this form, but philosophically it is so far from universal that it is not even very common. If we say \"this thing is bigger than that,\" we are not assigning a mere quality of \"this,\" but a relation of \"this\" and \"that.\" We might express the same fact by saying \"that thing is smaller than this,\" where grammatically the subject is changed. Thus propositions stating that two things have a certain relation have a different form from subject-predicate propositions, and the failure to perceive this difference or to allow for it has been the source of many errors in traditional metaphysics.  The belief or unconscious conviction that all propositions are of the subject-predicate form--in other words, that every fact consists in some thing having some quality--has rendered most philosophers incapable of giving any account of the world of science and daily life. If they had been honestly anxious to give such an account, they would probably have discovered their error very quickly; but most of them were less anxious to understand"]]]
