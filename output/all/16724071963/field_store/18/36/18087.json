The evidence established the insubordination of Elder Rigdon and the irregularity of his course, and a motion that he be excommunicated from the church until he repented was carried both by the council composed of the bishop and the twelve high priests, and also by the great congregation of the saints. Ten only, and they of Rigdon's following, voting in the negative.[A]  [Footnote A: See the minutes of Sidney Rigdon's trial in Grant's pamphlet on Sidney Rigdon, pp. 19 to 37.]  After his excommunication he made an attempt at organizing a church, choosing twelve apostles, etc., but his efforts amounted to but little. He soon retired from Nauvoo to Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, which he established as his headquarters. He sent missionaries to many branches of the church to represent his claims to the Presidency, but they succeeded in getting only slight support and that for the most part from among those weak in the faith. His church, never strong either in numbers or prominent men, soon crumbled into decay; Sidney Rigdon himself sank out of sight and in 1876 he died in obscurity in Alleghany county, state of New York.  The fate of Sidney Rigdon and the fate of the organization which he founded prove the prophetic character of the words of Brigham Young:      _All that want to draw away a party from the church after them,     let them do it if they can, but they will not prosper_.     II.   Following the attempt of Sidney Rigdon to become the \"Guardian of the Church,\" we will consider the efforts of William Smith, brother to the prophet Joseph, to become its President. He was a member of the quorum of the Twelve at the death of the prophet, though for some time his conduct had been such as to bring him into disrepute among the Saints. He was of a turbulent, ungovernable disposition; a man of fierce passions and violent temper. When the saints were driven from Missouri, in 1838, and his brother Joseph cast into prison, such was his vindictiveness against the prophet that at a general conference of the church held near Quincy, Illinois, May 4th, 1839, he was suspended from fellowship; but was afterwards restored, mainly through the pleadings of that same brother against whom he railed with such bitterness of speech.  Shortly after the martyrdom of his brothers, Joseph and Hyrum, William was ordained to the office of patriarch to the church, to succeed Hyrum Smith, who held that office at the time of his death. The associate editor of the _Times and Seasons_ in making the announcement of William's appointment put it that he had been appointed and ordained patriarch \"over the Church.\" Whereupon a number of persons of a disposition ever ready to take advantage of a word or make men an offender because of it, begun to ask if William was Patriarch \"over\" the church, did not that also make him President of the church. In the issue of the _Times and Seasons_ following, the editor corrected the error of his associate by saying that the notice of William's appointment to be patriarch should have read patriarch \"to\" the church, not \"over\" it. He, of course, also denied that William was President of the church.[A]  [Footnote A: _Times and Seasons_, Vol. VI, No. 9 and No. 10, Art. _Patriarchal_.]  Whether it was the discussion about William's appointment to be patriarch \"over\" the church which first put it into his head to make a claim to the office of President of the church; or that he took advantage of the phrase \"Patriarch over the Church,\" to bring forward claims to the Presidency which he had previously entertained, may not be accurately determined; but most likely it was the latter, because on the occasion of the writer's visit to William Smith, at his home, near Elkader, Clayton County, Iowa, late in the summer of 1880, he claimed to have been anointed, appointed, and ordained by the prophet Joseph to succeed to the office of President of the church after the prophet's death.  William Smith, however, based his claim to the position of president, mainly upon the fact that he was the brother of the Prophet, the only surviving brother, and therefore he should succeed to his brother's position. He claimed to find a precedent for this in scripture. In the council which convened in the early Christian church to consider how far the Gentile converts were under obligations to observe the forms and ceremonies of the Jewish law, after Peter and Paul and Barnabas and others were through speaking on the subject, James, \"the Lord's brother,\" is represented as saying:      Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from     among the Gentiles have turned unto God; but that we write unto     them; that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from     fornication and from things strangled and from blood.[A]  [Footnote A: Acts xv, 19, 20.]  The \"sentence\" of James here is regarded as the \"decision\" of the council; and William Smith argued that if James gave the decision of the council, he must have been the president of the council; and if president of the council, then President of the church; and since James was the Lord's brother and succeeded him in the Presidency of the church, so in this dispensation, as in the former one, the surviving brother of him who stood at the head of the church should succeed to the Presidency.  But this sophistry is confronted by the stubborn fact that the Lord Jesus had said to the Apostle Peter in the most direct terms:      I give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever     thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever     thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.[A]  [Footnote A: Matt. xvi.]  It is controverted also by all the facts of history which represent Peter as the chief Apostle and as holding a Presidency over the entire church. In modern revelation, too, the order in which the Apostles have been named who have administered to men on the earth--has been invariably Peter, James and John--Peter always named first as the leader, the chief.[A]  [Footnote A: John the Baptist at the time he conferred on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery the Aaronic Priesthood (May 15, 1829) said that \"he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchisedek.\"--(Hist. Joseph, _Mill. Star_, supplement, Vol. XIV, p. 15.)  \"I will drink of the fruit of the vine with you on the earth, . . . and also with John, the son of Zacharias...and also with Peter. James and John whom I have sent unto you, by whom I have ordained you and confirmed you Apostles and special witnesses of my name.\"--(Doc. and Cov., sec. xvii 5, 12.)  \"Again what do we hear? . . . the voice of Peter, James and John in the wilderness, between Harmony . . . and Colesville . . . declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom,\" (Doc. and Cov., sec. cxxviii, 20), and so throughout. It is scarcely probable that Peter would thus invariably have been named first unless that had been his place, as the chief, that is, the presiding Apostle.]  William Smith, however, did not command much of a following in this first attempt to make himself a leader. His profligate life was too notorious in Nauvoo to make it possible for him to wield much influence even as a schismatic. His efforts at leadership on this occasion resulted only in violent denunciations of those who would not receive him, and his final expulsion from the church. At the general conference held on the 6th of October, 1845, he was disfellowshipped from the quorum of the Twelve, and on the 12th of the same month, more of his wickedness having come to light, he was excommunicated from the church. He shortly afterwards became associated with James J. Strang and other apostates in an attempt to establish a church in the state of Wisconsin, but that failed as we shall see.  Here it will be proper to note the support which Lucy Smith, mother of William, gave to his claims to the Presidency. I regret being under the necessity of quoting her in such a controversy, as it shows this good and noble woman to have been very much mistaken in this matter, and one must ever be sorry to see those who are upright mistaken, especially in so grave a matter as this under consideration. One must ever feel a delicacy in referring to the words and actions of the mother of Joseph and Hyrum, of Don Carlos and Samuel H. Smith. She was a woman who had suffered much for the work of God and the testimony of Jesus; who in addition to toil, sickness, poverty and exile had lived to see her two noblest sons murdered, and two other sons and her husband laid away in premature graves, indirectly the victims of that relentless persecution which followed her family and the church from the beginning. These sufferings and her great age doubtless will account for that weakness of mind through which, and not through any wrong intent, I feel sure, she was led into this error of supporting the claims of her son William. But glad as I would be to pass by this matter for the sake of Sister Lucy Smith, I cannot do so, for the reason that the Josephites quote her as supporting the claims of \"Young Joseph,\" and I wish to show by her support of William that she did not do it.  The evidence that Sister Lucy Smith sustained the pretentions of William Smith to the Presidency and not those made in behalf of \"Young Joseph,\" is found in the journal of the late President John Taylor, a member of the quorum of the Twelve Apostles at the time in Nauvoo:                                        Friday, June 27th, 1845.      This was the anniversary of the day that Brothers Joseph and Hyrum     were killed and myself shot. We met together (the quorum of the     Priesthood) to pray, several of the Twelve were present. When I     returned [home] in the evening, Mrs. Taylor showed me a copy of a     vision that Mother Lucy Smith had, stating"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35556"],["title","Succession in the Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (#4)"],["body","her son William     was head of the Church; the following is a copy:       FIRST VISION.      Brothers and children, I was much troubled and felt as if I had     the sins of the whole world to bear, and the burden of the Church;     and I felt that there was something wrong. I called on the Lord to     show me what was wrong, and if it was I. I called upon him until I     slept. I then heard a voice calling on me saying, awake, awake,     awake, for the only son that thou hast living, they for his life     have laid a snare. My aged servant Joseph who was the first     Patriarch of this Church, and my servant Hyrum who was the second     Patriarch, my servant Joseph who was Prophet and Seer, and my     servants Samuel, William and Don Carlos--they were the first     founders, fathers and heads of this Church, raised up in these     last days, and thou art the mother, and thy daughters have helped,     and they are the daughters in Israel, and have helped raise up     this Church. Arise, arise, arise, and take thy place, you know not     what has been in the hearts of some; but he said thou shalt know.     He told me what it was; but I shall not tell. (I saw William in a     room full of armed men and he having no weapons. They would have     crushed him down, if it had not been for the power of God; and     many of the family would have been cut off--[the] Lord having     softened their hearts. Two of them had blacker hearts than the     rest, and I know who they are, and I will tell them if they will     come to me. Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball know it is so, and     dare not deny it.) Call upon the Twelve, let all things be set in     order, and keep their hearts pure from this time hence forth; the     voice saith be merciful, and then Zion shall arise and flourish as     a rose. What I was told I cannot tell.      Thou art the mother in Israel, and tell thy children all to walk     uprightly. Thy son William, he shall have power over the churches,     he is father in Israel over the patriarchs and the whole of the     Church; he is the last of the lineage that is raised up in these     last days. He is Patriarch to regulate the affairs of the Church.     He is President over all the Church, they cannot take his     apostleship away from him. The Presidency of the Church belongs to     William, he being the last of the heads of the Church, according     to the lineage, he having inherited it from the family from before     the foundation of the world. Thou art a mother in Israel. Thy     spirit arose and said in eternity that it would take a body to be     a mother to prophet[s] who should be raised up to save the last     dispensation. And the spirit said unto me to be faithful, (and     that I was faithful,) and tell the Church to be faithful. And the     spirit said I should live until I was satisfied with life.      Brothers and children, I want you to take notice that the burden     of the Church rests [on William].       SECOND VISION.      Joseph came to me and said: \"That day is coming when I shall wave     the scepter of power over my enemies. Be patient my brothers and     sisters, the day is coming when you shall have eternal life and be     rewarded for all your troubles.\"       THIRD VISION.      Father came to me and I said, Father, have you come? And he said     \"yes.\" I said tell me where you have been. And he said, \"I have     been all around here. I have come to you again to tell you one     thing certain, which I have told you many times before. It is my     prayer and the prayers of our sons that you live to take care of     William and my daughters, and see that they have their rights and     standing where they ought to have it.\" He turned to go away, and I     said I will go with you. He said you must stay.      The following persons were present at the time this vision was     related:      William Smith,     A. Milliken,     W. I. Salisbury,     David Elliott,     Robt. Campbell,     Elias Smith,     Joseph Cain,     Bro. Stringham,     Chas. Kelly,     Bro. McLery,     Mrs. Taylor,     Mrs. Milliken,     Mrs. Salisbury,     Mrs. McLery,     Mrs. Kelly,     Mrs. Sherman.  On June 30th, 1845, at the request of Sister Lucy Smith, seven of the Twelve, with Bishops Miller and Whitney and Elder Cahoon, met at her house to talk over these visions in respect to William. Several members of her family were present. It was also arranged for William Smith to be present, but he failed to appear. I copy from Elder Taylor's journal, under date of June 30th:      The conversation was full and free. President Young stated that     William was aiming at power and authority and priesthood that did     not belong to him; that he would sustain William in his office and     calling, but would not allow him to tread upon his or any other     man's neck; that if the Church wanted to have William Smith, he     would mention it to them, and they should have their choice. This,     however, neither the Church, nor the Twelve would consent to; for     if it had been put to them--I do not suppose that twenty would     have voted for him, out of the many thousands there are in the     Church. Mother Smith said he [William] did not want it; she did     not profess to be a revelator only for herself and family, that     she wanted peace, union and harmony. The Twelve all expressed the     same feeling and manifested the greatest kindness to Mother Smith     as did also the bishops.  Though William did not meet with the Twelve, he addressed a letter to President Brigham Young which was read at the above meeting. After complaining about the article on Patriarchs, which had appeared in the _Times and Seasons_, he concludes thus:      \"My proposition is, my share of the kingdom, and if you will     publish in the _Neighbor_ and _Times and Seasons_ the true state     of the case in regard to my office as Patriarch over the whole     Church, this will give me a right to visit all branches of the     Church, and intrude on no man's rights; and further to attend to     all of the ordinances of God, no man being my head, I will     reconcile all difficulties, and Elder Young can stand as the     President of the Church, and by my most hearty wish and consent.     This will settle all difficulties and restore peace and good     order, and farther than this, I cannot say, only that I want all     men to understand that my father's family are of the royal blood,     and promised seed, and no man or set of men can take their crown     or place in time nor eternity. Brother Young, the above is my     proposition and will settle all difficulties at once, and these     are my avowed sentiments and no equivocation.                                                 WILLIAM SMITH.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Taylor's Journal under date of June 30, 1845.]  To this letter the Twelve wrote an answer before leaving the house of Mother Smith. In said letter the brethren regretted not having had the pleasure of meeting William. They had had considerable talk with      \"Mother Smith, and find her possessing the best of feelings     towards the whole Church. As to your requests in your letter we     would say: we are perfectly willing and wish to have all things     right, but there are some ordinances in the Church that cannot be     administered by any person out of this place at present, but must     be done here. As to having the right to administer all ordinances     in the world and no one standing at your head, we could not     sanction, because the President of the Church, and each one of our     quorum are amenable to the quorum of which you are a member. But     as to your right to officiate in the office of Patriarch, we say     you have the right to officiate in all the world wherever your lot     may be cast, and no one to dictate or control you excepting the     Twelve, which body of men must preside over the whole Church in     all the world.\"  The following postscript was added:      \"We have read this to Mother Smith, Catherine, Lucy, and Arthur,     and they express their satisfaction with it, as well as those of     the council who are present.\"[A]  [Footnote A: John Taylor's journal, under date of June 30, 1845.]  Elder Taylor thus concludes his account of this visit with \"Mother Smith:\"      \"We prayed with Mother Smith before we left her; and she and the     family manifested good feelings. I am sorry the old lady should be     troubled, she is a good woman and has passed through much trouble     for the cause of truth, and has the respect and confidence of the     whole Church.\"[A]  [Footnote A: Ibid.]  After his failure in Nauvoo, and in Wisconsin in connection with Mr. Strang, we next hear of William Smith in the winter and spring of 1850, visiting those who had been members of the church in Illinois and Kentucky, teaching \"lineal priesthood as applied to the Presidency of the church.\" That is, he taught that his brother Joseph's eldest son had a right by virtue of lineage to succeed to the Presidency of the church; but also taught in connection with this that it was his right as the only surviving brother of the former President, uncle and natural guardian of the \"seed\" of Joseph the prophet, to stand, in the _interim_, as president _pro tem_ of the church. There seemed to be a general acquiescence with this by the members of the church remaining in the districts where he labored--most of whom were either apostates or weak in the faith--and in the spring of 1850, he called a conference to assemble in Covington, Kentucky, where he effected an organization by having himself sustained as President _pro tem_, of the church, and Lyman Wight[A] and Aaron Hook as counselors _pro tem_ to the President _pro tem_, and Joseph Wood as counselor and spokesman. It is claimed that many of the \"saints\" in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin, were identified with this movement.[B]  [Footnote A: I cannot learn that Lyman Wight, "]]]
