At last Dot saw that the Snake was getting weak, for, little by little, the Kookooburra was able to rise higher with it, until it reached the high bough.  All the time the Snake was held in the bird's beak, writhing and coiling in agony; for he knew that the Kookooburra had won the battle. But, when the noble bird had reached its perch, it did a strange thing; for it dropped the Snake right down to the ground.  Then it flew down again, and brought the reptile back to the bough, and dropped it once more--and this it did many times.  Each time the Snake moved less and less, for its back was being broken by these falls.  At last the Kookooburra flew up with its victim for the last time, and, holding it on the branch with its foot, beat the serpent's head with its great strong beak.  Dot could hear the blows fall,--whack, whack, whack,--as the beak smote the Snake's head; first on one side, then on the other, until it lay limp and dead across the bough.  \"Ah! ah! ah!  Ah! ah! ah!\" laughed the Kookooburra, and said to Dot, \"Did you see all that?  Wasn't it a joke?  What a capital joke!  Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  Oh! oh! oh!  How my sides do ache!  What a joke!  How they'll laugh when I tell them.\"  Then came a great flight of kookooburras, for they had heard the laughter, and all wanted to know what the joke was. Proudly the Kookooburra told them all about the Snake sleeping on Dot, and the great fight!  All the time, first one kookooburra, and then another, chuckled over the story, and when it came to an end every bird dropped its wings, cocked up its tail, and throwing back its head, opened its great beak, and laughed uproariously together.  Dot was nearly deafened with the noise; for some chuckled, some cackled; some said, \"Ha! ha! ha!\" others said, \"Oh! oh! oh!\" and as soon as one left off, another began, until it seemed as though they couldn't stop.  They all said it was a splendid joke, and that they really must go and tell it to the whole bush.  So they flew away, and far and near, for hours, the bush echoed with chuckling and cackling, and wild bursts of laughter, as the kookooburras told that grand joke everywhere.  \"Now,\" said the Kookooburra, when all the others had gone, \"a bit of snake is just the right thing for breakfast.  Will you have some, little Human?\"  Dot shuddered at the idea of eating snake for breakfast, and the Kookooburra thought she was afraid of being poisoned.  \"It won't hurt you,\" he said, kindly, \"I took care that it did not bite itself.  Sometimes they do that when they are dying, and then they're not good to eat.  But this snake is all right, and won't disagree like cockchafers:  the scales are quite soft and digestible,\" he added.  But Dot said she would rather wait for the berries the Kangaroo was bringing, so the Kookooburra remarked that if she would excuse it he would like to begin breakfast at once, as the fight had made him hungry.  Then Dot saw him hold the reptile on the branch with his foot, whilst he took its tail into his beak, and proceeded to swallow it in a leisurely way. In fact the Kookooburra was so slow that very little of the snake had disappeared when the Kangaroo returned.  The Kangaroo had brought a pouch full of berries, and in her hand a small spray of the magic ones, by eating which Dot was able to understand the talk of all the bush creatures.  All the time she was wandering in the bush the Kangaroo gave her some of these to eat daily, and Dot soon found that the effect of these strange berries only lasted until the next day.  The Kangaroo emptied out her pouch, and Dot found quite a large collection of roots, buds, and berries, which she ate with good appetite.  The Kangaroo watched her eating with a look of quiet satisfaction.  \"See,\" she said, \"how easily one can live in the bush without hurting anyone; and yet Humans live by murdering creatures and devouring them. If they are lost in the scrub they die, because they know no other way to live than that cruel one of destroying us all.  Humans have become so cruel that they kill, and kill, not even for food, but for the love of murdering.  I often wonder,\" she said, \"why they and the dingos are allowed to live on this beautiful kind earth.  The black Humans kill and devour us; but they, even, are not so terrible as the Whites, who delight in taking our lives, and torturing us just as an amusement. Every creature in the bush weeps that they should have come to take the beautiful bush away from us.\"  Dot saw that the sad brown eyes of the Kangaroo were full of tears, and she cried too, as she thought of all that the poor animals and birds suffer at the hands of white men.  \"Dear Kangaroo,\" she said, \"if I ever get home, I'll tell everyone of how you unhappy creatures live in fear, and suffer, and ask them not to kill you poor things any more.\"  But the Kangaroo sadly shook her head, and said, \"White Humans are cruel, and love to murder.  We must all die.  But about your lost way,\" she continued in a brisk tone, by way of changing this painful subject; \"I've been asking about it, and no one has seen it anywhere.  Of course someone must know where it is, but the difficulty is to find the right one to ask.\" Then she dropped her voice, and came a little, nearer to Dot, and stooping down until her little black hands hung close to the ground, she whispered in Dot's ear, \"They say I ought to consult the Platypus.\"  \"Could the Platypus help, do you think?\" Dot asked.  \"I NEVER think,\" said the Kangaroo, \"but as the Platypus never goes anywhere, never associates with any other creature, and is hardly ever seen, I conclude it knows everything--it must, you know.\"  \"Of course,\" said Dot, with some doubt in her tone.  \"The only thing is,\" continued the Kangaroo, once more sitting up and pensively scratching her nose.  \"The only thing is, I can't bear the Platypus; the sight of it gives me the creeps: it's such a queer creature!\"  \"I've never seen a Platypus,\" said Dot, \"do tell me what it is like!\"  \"I couldn't describe it,\" said the Kangaroo, with a shudder, \"it seems made up of parts of two or three different sorts of creatures.  None of us can account for it.  It must have been an experiment, when all the rest of us were made; or else it was made up of the odds and ends of the birds and beasts that were left over after we were all finished.\"  Little Dot clapped her hands.  \"Oh, dear Kangaroo,\" she said, \"do take me to see the Platypus! there was nothing like that in my Noah's ark.\"  \"I should say not!\" remarked the Kangaroo.  \"The animals in the ark said they were each to be of its kind, and every sort of bird and beast refused to admit the Platypus, because it was of so many kinds; and at last Noah turned it out to swim for itself, because there was such a row.  That's why the Platypus is so secluded.  Ever since then no Platypus is friendly with any other creature, and no animal or bird is more than just polite to it.  They couldn't be, you see, because of that trouble in the ark.\"  \"But that was so long ago,\" said Dot, filled with compassion for the lonely Platypus; \"and, after all, this is not the same Platypus, nor are all the bush creatures the same now as then.\"  \"No,\" returned the Kangaroo, \"and some say there was no ark, and no fuss over the matter, but that, of course, doesn't make any difference, for it's a very ancient quarrel, so it must be kept up.  But if we are to go to the Platypus we had better start now; it is a good time to see it--so come along, little Dot,\" said the Kangaroo.     CHAPTER IV.   \"Good-bye, Kookooburra!\" cried Dot, as they left the cave; and the bird gave her a nod of the head, followed by a wink, which was supposed to mean hearty good-will at parting.  He would have spoken, only he had swallowed part of the Snake, and the rest hung out of the side of his beak, like an old man's pipe; so he couldn't speak.  It wouldn't have been polite to do so with his beak full.  Dot was so rested by her sleep all night that she did not ride in the Kangaroo's pouch; but they proceeded together, she walking, and her friend making as small hops as she could, so as not to get too far ahead.  This was very difficult for the Kangaroo, because even the smallest hops carried her far in front.  After a time they  arranged that the friendly animal should hop a few yards, then wait for Dot to catch her up, and then go on again.  This she did, nibbling bits of grass as she waited, or playing a little game of hide-and-seek behind the bushes.  Sometimes, when she hid like this, little Dot would be afraid that she had lost her Kangaroo, and would run here and there, hunting round trees, and clusters of ferns, until she felt quite certain she had lost the kind animal; when suddenly, clean over a big bush, the Kangaroo would bound into view, landing right in front of her.  Then Dot would laugh, and rush forward, and throw her arms around her friend; and the Kangaroo, with a quiet smile, would rub her little head against Dot's curls, and they were both very happy.  So, although it was really a long and rough way to the little creek where the Platypus lived, it did not seem at all far.  The stream ran at the bottom of a deep gully, that had high rocky sides, with strangely shaped trees growing between the rocks.  But, by the stream, Dot thought they must be in fairyland; it was so beautiful. In the dark hollows of the rocks were wonderful ferns; such delicate ones that the little girl was afraid to touch them.  They were so tender and green that they could only grow far away from the sun, and as she peeped into the hollows and caves where they grew, it seemed as if she was being shown the secret store-house of Nature, where she kept all the most lovely plants, out of sight of the world.  A soft carpet seemed to spring under Dot's feet, like a nice springy mattress, as she trotted along.  She asked the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3703"],["title","Dot and the Kangaroo (#4)"],["body","why the earth was so soft, and was told that it was not earth, but the dead leaves of the tree-ferns above them, that had been falling for such a long, long time, that no Kangaroo could remember the beginning.  Then Dot looked up, and saw that there was no sky to be seen, or tops of trees; for they were passing under a forest of tree-ferns, and their lovely spreading fronds made a perfect green tent over their heads. The sunlight that came through was green, as if you were in a house made of green glass.  All up the slender stems of these tall tree-ferns were the most beautiful little plants, and many stems were twined, from the earth to their feather-like fronds, with tender creeping ferns--the fronds of which were so fine and close, that it seemed as if the tree-fern were wrapped up in a lovely little fern coat.  Even crumbling dead trees, and decaying tree-ferns, did not look dead, because some beautiful moss, or lichen, or little ferns had clung to them, and made them more beautiful than when alive.  Dot kept crying out with pleasure at all she saw; especially when little Parrakeets, with feathers as green as the ferns, and gorgeous red breasts, came in flocks, and welcomed her to their favourite haunt; and, as she had eaten the berries of understanding, and was the friend of the Kangaroo, they were not frightened, but perched on her shoulders and hands, and chatted their merry talk all together.  The Kangaroo did not share Dot's enthusiasm for the beauties of the gully.  She said it was pretty, certainly, but a bad place for Kangaroos, because there was no grass.  For her part, she didn't think any sight in nature so lovely as a big plain, green with the little blades of new spring grass.  The gully was very showy, but not to her mind so beautiful as the other.  Then they came to a stream that gurgled melodiously as it rippled over stones in its shallow course, or crept round big grey boulders that were wrapped in thick mosses, in which were mingled flowers of the pink and red wild fuchsia, or the creamy great blossoms of the rock lily. Dot ran down the stream with bare feet, laughing as she paddled in and out among the rocks and ferns, and the sun shone down on the gleaming foam of the water, and made golden lights in Dot's wild curls.  The Kangaroo, too, was very merry, and bounded from rock to rock over the stream, showing what wonderful things she could do in that way; and sometimes they paused, side by side, and peeped down upon some still pool that showed their two reflections as in a mirror; and that seemed so funny to Dot, that her silvery laugh woke the silence in happy peals, until more green-and-red Parrakeets flew out of the bush to join in the fun.  When they had followed the stream some distance, the gully opened out into bush scrub.  The little Parrakeets then said \"Good-bye,\" and flew back to their favourite tree-ferns and bush growth; and the Kangaroo said, that as they were nearing the home of the Platypus, they must not play in the stream any more; to do so might warn the creature of their approach and frighten it.  \"We shall have to be very careful,\" she said, \"so that the Platypus will neither hear nor smell you.  We will therefore walk on the opposite shore, as the wind will then blow away from its home.\"  The stream no longer chattered over rocky beds, but slid between soft banks of earth, under tufts of tall rushes, grasses, and ferns, and soon it opened into a broad pool, which was smooth as glass.  The clouds in the sky, the tall surrounding trees, and the graceful ferns and rushes of the banks, were all reflected in the water, so that it looked to Dot like a strange upside-down picture.  This, then, was the home of that wonderful animal; and Dot felt quite frightened, because she thought she was going to see something terrible.  At the Kangaroo's bidding, she hid a little way from the edge of the pool, but she was able to see all that happened.  The Kangaroo evidently did not enjoy the prospect of conversing with the Platypus.  She kept on fidgeting about, putting off calling to the Platypus by one excuse and another:  she was decidedly ill at ease.  \"Are you frightened of the Platypus?\" asked Dot.  \"Dear me, no!\" replied the Kangaroo, \"but I'd rather have a talk with any other bush creature.  First of all, the sight of it makes me so uncomfortable, that I want to hop away the instant I set eyes upon it. Then, too, it's so difficult to be polite to the Platypus, because one never knows how to behave towards it.  If you treat it as an animal, you offend its bird nature, and if you treat it as a bird, the animal in it is mighty indignant.  One never knows where one is with a creature that is two creatures,\" said the Kangaroo.  Dot was so sorry for the perplexity of her friend, that she suggested that they should not consult the Platypus.  But the Kangaroo said it must be done, because no one in the bush was so learned.  Being such a strange creature, and living in such seclusion, and being so difficult to approach was a proof that it was the right adviser to seek.  So, with a half desperate air, the Kangaroo left the little girl, and went down to the water's edge.  Pausing a moment, she made a strange little noise that was something between a grunt and a hiss:  and she repeated this many times.  At last Dot saw what looked like a bit of black stick, just above the surface of the pool, coming towards their side, and, as it moved forward, leaving two little silvery ripples that widened out behind it on the smooth waters. Presently the black stick, which was the bill of the Platypus, reached the bank, and the strangest little creature climbed into view.  Dot had expected to see something big and hideous; but here was quite a small object after all!  It seemed quite ridiculous that the great Kangaroo should be evidently discomposed by the sight.  Dot could not hear what the Kangaroo said, but she saw the Platypus hurriedly prepare to regain the water.  It began to stumble clumsily down the bank.  The Kangaroo then raised her voice in pleading accents.  \"But,\" she said, \"it's such a little Human! I have treated it like my baby Kangaroo, and have carried it in my pouch.\"  This information seemed to arrest the movements of the Platypus; it had reached the water's edge, but it paused, and turned.  \"I tell you,\" it said in a high-pitched and irritable voice, \"that all Humans are alike!  They all come here to interview me for the same purpose, and I'm resolved it shall not happen again; I have been insulted enough by their ignorance.\"  \"I assure you,\" urged the Kangaroo, \"that she will not annoy you in that way.  She wouldn't think of doing such a thing to any animal.\"  As the Kangaroo called the Platypus an animal, Dot saw at once that it was offended, and in a great huff it turned towards the pool again.  \"I beg your pardon,\" said the Kangaroo nervously.  \"I didn't mean an altogether animal, or even a bird, but any a--a--a----.\"  She seemed puzzled how to speak of the Platypus,  when the strange creature, seeing the well-meaning embarrassment of the Kangaroo, said affably, \"any mammal or Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus.\"  \"Exactly,\" said the Kangaroo, brightening up, although she hadn't the least idea what a mammal was.  \"Well, bring the little Human here,\" said the Platypus in a more friendly tone, \"and if I feel quite sure on that point I will permit an interview.\"  Two bounds brought the Kangaroo to where Dot was hidden.  She seemed anxious that the child should make a good impression on the Platypus, and tried with the long claws on her little black hands to comb through Dot's long gleaming curls; but they were so tangled that the child called out at this awkward method of hairdressing, and the Kangaroo stopped.  She then licked a black smudge off Dot's forehead, which was all she could to tidy her.  Then she started back with a hop, and eyed the child with her head on one  side.  She was not quite satisfied. \"Ah!\" she said, \"if only you were a baby Kangaroo I could make you look so nice!  But I can't do anything to your sham coat, which gets worse every day, and your fur is all wrong, for one can't get one's claws through it.  You Humans are no good in the bush!\"  \"Never mind, dear Kangaroo,\" said the little girl; \"when I get home mother will put me on a new frock, and will get the tangles out of my hair.  Let us go to the Platypus now.\"  The Kangaroo felt sad as Dot spoke of returning home, for she had become really fond of the little Human.  She began to feel that she would be lonely when they parted.  However, she did not speak of what was in her mind, but bounded back to the Platypus to wait for Dot.  When the little girl reached the pool, she was still more surprised, on a nearer view of the Platypus, that the Kangaroo should think so much of it. At her feet she beheld a creature like a shapeless bit of wet matted fur. She thought it looked like an empty fur bag that had been fished out of the water.  Projecting from the head, that seemed much nearer to the ground than the back, was a broad duck's bill, of a dirty grey colour; and peeping out underneath were two fore feet that were like a duck's also. Altogether it was such a funny object that she was inclined to laugh, only the Kangaroo looked so serious, that she tried to look serious too, as if there was nothing strange in the appearance of the Platypus.  \"I am the Ornithorhynchus Paradoxus!\" said the Platypus pompously.  \"I am Dot,\" said the little girl.  \"Now we know one another's names,\" said the Platypus, with satisfaction. \"If the Kangaroo had introduced us, it would have stumbled over my name, and mumbled yours, and we should have been none the wiser.  Now tell me, little Human, are you going to write a book about me?  Because, if you are, I'm off.  I can't stand any more books being written about me; I've been annoyed enough that way.\"  \"I couldn't write a book,\" said Dot, with surprise inwardly wondering what"]]]
