The other professors, in whose classes he was not distinguished, took little notice of him. He had no taste for the study of languages, polite literature, or the arts. As there were no indications of his ever becoming a scholar, the pedants of the establishment were inclined to think him stupid. His superior intelligence was, however, sufficiently perceptible, even through the reserve under which it was veiled. If the monks to whom the superintendence of the establishment was confided had understood the organisation of his mind, if they had engaged more able mathematical professors, or if we had had any incitement to the study of chemistry, natural philosophy, astronomy, etc., I am convinced that Bonaparte would have pursued these sciences with all the genius and spirit of investigation which he displayed in a career, more brilliant it is true, but less useful to mankind. Unfortunately, the monks did not perceive this, and were too poor to pay for good masters. However, after Bonaparte left the college they found it necessary to engage two professors from Paris, otherwise the college would have fallen to nothing. These two new professors, MM. Durfort and Desponts, finished my education; and I regretted that they did not come sooner. The often-repeated assertion of Bonaparte having received a careful education at Brienne is therefore untrue. The monks were incapable of giving it him; and, for my own part, I must confess that the extended information of the present day is to me a painful contrast with the limited course of education I received at the Military College. It is only surprising that the establishment should have produced a single able man.  Though Bonaparte had no reason to be satisfied with the treatment he received from his comrades, yet he was above complaining of it; and when he had the supervision of any duty which they infringed, he would rather go to prison than denounce the criminals.  I was one day his accomplice in omitting to enforce a duty which we were appointed to supervise. He prevailed on me to accompany him to prison, where we remained three days. We suffered this sort of punishment several times, but with less severity.  In 1783 the Duke of Orleans and Madame de Montesson visited Brienne; and, for upwards of a month, the magnificent chateau of the Comte de Brienne was a Versailles in miniature. The series of brilliant entertainments which were given to the august travellers made them almost forget the royal magnificence they had left behind them.  The Prince and Madame de Montesson expressed a wish to preside at the distribution of the prizes of our college. Bonaparte and I won the prizes in the class of mathematics, which, as I have already observed, was the branch of study to which he confined his attention, and in which he excelled. When I was called up for the seventh time Madame de Montesson said to my mother, who had come from Sens to be present at the distribution, \"Pray, madame, crown your son this time; my hands are a-weary.\"  There was an inspector of the military schools, whose business it was to make an annual report on each pupil, whether educated at the public expense or paid for by his family. I copied from the report of 1784 a note which was probably obtained surreptitiously from the War Office. I wanted to purchase the manuscript, but Louis Bonaparte bought it. I did not make a copy of the note which related to myself, because I should naturally have felt diffident in making any use of it. It would, however, have served to show how time and circumstances frequently reversed the distinctions which arise at school or college. Judging from the reports of the inspector of military schools, young Bonaparte was not, of all the pupils at Brienne in 1784, the one most calculated to excite prognostics of future greatness and glory.  The note to which I have just alluded, and which was written by M. de Kerralio, then inspector of the military schools, describes Bonaparte in the following terms:              INSPECTION OF MILITARY SCHOOLS                  1784.        REPORT MADE FOR HIS MAJESTY BY M. DE KERALIO.     M. de Buonaparte (Napoleon), born 15th August 1769, height 4 feet 10    inches 10 lines, is in the fourth class, has a good constitution,    excellent health, character obedient, upright, grateful, conduct    very regular; has been always distinguished by his application to    mathematics. He knows history and geography very passably. He is    not well up in ornamental studies or in Latin in which he is only in    the fourth class. He will be an excellent sailor. He deserves to    be passed on to the Military School of Paris.  Father Berton, however, opposed Bonaparte's removal to Paris, because he had not passed through the fourth Latin class, and the regulations required that he should be in the third. I was informed by the vice-principal that a report relative to Napoleon was sent from the College of Brienne to that of Paris, in which he was described as being domineering, imperious, and obstinate.      --[Napoleon remained upwards of five years at Brienne, from April    1779 till the latter end of 1784. In 1783 the Chevalier Keralio,    sub-inspector of the military schools, selected him to pass the year    following to the military school at Paris, to which three of the    best scholars were annually sent from each of the twelve provincial    military schools of France. It is curious as well as satisfactory    to know the opinion at this time entertained of him by those who    were the best qualified to judge. His old master, Le Guille,    professor of history at Paris, boasted that, in a list of the    different scholars, he had predicted his pupil's subsequent career.    In fact, to the name of Bonaparte the following note is added: \"a    Corsican by birth and character--he will do something great, if    circumstances favour him.\" Menge was his instructor in geometry,    who also entertained a high opinion of him. M. Bauer, his German    master, was the only one who saw nothing in him, and was surprised    at being told he was undergoing his examination for the artillery.    --Hazlitt.]--  I knew Bonaparte well; and I think M. de Keralio's report of him was exceedingly just, except, perhaps, that he might have said he was very well as to his progress in history and geography, and very backward in Latin; but certainly nothing indicated the probability of his being an excellent seaman. He himself had no thought of the navy.      --[Bourrienne is certainly wrong as to Bonaparte having no thought    of the navy. In a letter of 1784 to the Minister of War his father    says of Napoleon that, \"following the advice of the Comte de    Marbeuf, he has turned his studies towards the navy; and so well has    he succeeded that he was intended by M. de Keralio for the school of    Paris, and afterwards for the department of Toulon. The retirement    of the former professor (Keralio) has changed the fate of my son.\"    It was only on the failure of his intention to get into the navy    that his father, on 15th July 1784 applied for permission for him to    enter the artillery; Napoleon having a horror of the infantry, where    he said they did nothing. It was on the success of this application    that he was allowed to enter the school of Parts (Iung, tome i. pp.    91-103). Oddly enough, in later years, on 30th August 1792, having    just succeeded in getting himself reinstated as captain after his    absence, overstaying leave, he applied to pass into the Artillerie    de la Marine. \"The application was judged to be simply absurd, and    was filed with this note, 'S. R.' ('sans reponse')\" (Iung, tome ii.    p. 201)]--  In consequence of M. de Keralio's report, Bonaparte was transferred to the Military College of Paris, along with MM. Montarby de Dampierre, de Castres, de Comminges, and de Laugier de Bellecourt, who were all, like him, educated at the public expense, and all, at least, as favorably reported.  What could have induced Sir Walter Scott to say that Bonaparte was the pride of the college, that our mathematical master was exceedingly fond of him, and that the other professors in the different sciences had equal reason to be satisfied with him? What I have above stated, together with the report of M. de Keralio, bear evidence of his backwardness in almost every branch of education except mathematics. Neither was it, as Sir Walter affirms, his precocious progress in mathematics that occasioned him to be removed to Paris. He had attained the proper age, and the report of him was favourable, therefore he was very naturally included among the number of the five who were chosen in 1784.  In a biographical account of Bonaparte I have read the following anecdote:--When he was fourteen years of age he happened to be at a party where some one pronounced a high eulogium on Turenne; and a lady in the company observed that he certainly was a great man, but that she should like him better if he had not burned the Palatinate. \"What signifies that,\" replied Bonaparte, \"if it was necessary to the object he had in view?\"  This is either an anachronism or a mere fabrication. Bonaparte was fourteen in the year 1783. He was then at Brienne, where certainly he did not go into company, and least of all the company of ladies.      CHAPTER II.   1784-1794.

Bonaparte was fifteen years and two months old when he went to the Military College of Paris.      --[Madame Junot relates some interesting particulars connected with    Napoleon's first residence in Paris:    \"My mother's first care,\" says she, \"on arriving in Paris was to    inquire after Napoleon Bonaparte. He was at that time in the    military school at Paris, having quitted Brienne in the September of    the preceding year.     \"My uncle Demetrius had met him just after he alighted from the coach    which brought him to town; 'And truly.' said my uncle, 'he had the    appearance of a fresh importation. I met him in the Palms Royal,    where he was gaping and staring with wonder at everything he saw.    He would have been an excellent subject for sharpers, if, indeed, he    had had anything worth taking!' My uncle invited him to dine at his    house; for though my uncle was a bachelor, he did not choose to dine    at a 'traiteur' (the name 'restaurateur' was not then introduced).    He told my mother that Napoleon was very morose. 'I fear,' added    he, 'that that young man has more self-conceit than is suitable to    his condition. When he dined with me he began to declaim violently    against the luxury of the young men of the military school. After a    little he turned the conversation on Mania, and the present    education of the young Maniotes, drawing a comparison between it and    the ancient Spartan system of education. His observations on this    head he told me he intended to embody in a memorial to be presented    to the Minister of War. All this, depend upon it, will bring him    under the displeasure of his comrades; and it will be lucky if he    escape being run through.' A few days afterwards my mother saw    Napoleon, and then his irritability was at its height. He would    scarcely bear any observations, even if made in his favour, and I am    convinced that it is to this uncontrollable irritability that he    owed the reputation of having been ill-tempered in his boyhood, and    splenetic in his youth. My father, who was acquainted with almost    all the heads of the military school, obtained leave for him    sometimes to come out for recreation. On account of an accident (a    sprain, if I recollect rightly) Napoleon once spent a whole week at    our house. To this day, whenever I pass the Quai Conti, I cannot    help looking up at a 'mansarde' at the left angle of the house on    the third floor. That was Napoleon's chamber when he paid us a    visit, and a neat little room it was. My brother used to occupy the    one next to it. The two young men were nearly of the same age: my    brother perhaps had the advantage of a year or fifteen months. My    mother had recommended him to cultivate the friendship of young    Bonaparte; but my brother complained how unpleasant it was to find    only cold politeness where he expected affection. This    repulsiveness on the part of Napoleon was almost offensive, and must    have been sensibly felt by my brother, who was not only remarkable    for the mildness of his temper and the amenity and grace of his    manner, but whose society was courted in the most distinguished    circles of Paris on account of his accomplishments. He perceived in    Bonaparte a kind of acerbity and bitter irony, of which he long    endeavoured to discover the cause. 'I believe,' said Albert one day    to my mother, 'that the poor young man feels keenly his dependent    situation.'\" ('Memoirs of the Duchesse d'Abrantes, vol. i. p. 18,    edit. 1883).]--  I accompanied him in a carriole as far as Nogent Sur Seine, whence the coach was to start. We parted with regret, and we did not meet again till the year 1792. During these eight years we maintained an active correspondence; but so little did I anticipate the high destiny which, after his elevation, it was affirmed the wonderful qualities of his boyhood plainly denoted, that I did not preserve one of the letters he wrote to me at that period, but tore them up as soon as they were answered.      --[I remember, however, that in a letter which I received from him    about a year after his arrival in Paris he urged me to keep my    promise of entering the army with him. Like him, I had passed    through the studies necessary for the artillery service; and in 1787    I went for three months to Metz, in order to unite practice with    theory. A strange Ordinance, which I believe was issued in 1778 by    M. de Segur, required that a man should possess four quarterings of    nobility before he could be qualified to serve his king and country    as a military officer. My mother went to Paris, taking with her the    letters patent of her husband, who died six weeks after my birth.    She proved that in the year 1640 Louis XIII. had, by letters    patent, restored the titles of one Fauvelet de Villemont, who in    1586 had kept several provinces of Burgundy subject to the king's    authority at the peril of his life and the loss of his property; and    that his family had occupied the first places in the magistracy    since the fourteenth century. All was correct, but it was observed    that the letters of nobility had not been registered by the    Parliament, and to repair this little omission, the sum of twelve    thousand francs was demanded. This my mother refused to pay, and    there the matter rested.]--  On his arrival at the Military School of Paris, Bonaparte found the establishment on so brilliant and expensive a footing that he immediately addressed a memorial on the subject to the Vice-Principal Berton of Brienne.      --[A second memoir prepared by him to the same effect was intended    for the Minister of War, but Father Berton wisely advised silence to    the young cadet (Iung, tome i. p. 122). Although believing in the    necessity of show and of magnificence in public life, Napoleon    remained true to these principles. While lavishing wealth on his    ministers and marshals, \"In your private life,\" said be, \"be    economical and even parsimonious; in public be magnificent\"    (Meneval, tome i. p. 146).]--  He showed that the plan of education was really pernicious, and far from being calculated to fulfil the object which every wise government must have in view. The result of the system, he said, was to inspire the pupils, who were all the sons of poor gentlemen, with a love of ostentation, or rather, with sentiments of vanity and self-sufficiency; so that, instead of returning happy to the bosom of their families, they were likely to be ashamed of their parents, and to despise their humble homes. Instead of the numerous attendants by whom they were surrounded, their dinners of two courses, and their horses and grooms, he suggested that they should perform little necessary services for themselves, such as brushing their clothes, and cleaning their boots and shoes; that they should eat the coarse bread made for soldiers, etc. Temperance and activity, he added, would render them robust, enable them to bear the severity of different seasons and climates, to brave the fatigues of war, and to inspire the respect and obedience of the soldiers under their command. Thus reasoned Napoleon at the age of sixteen, and time showed that he never deviated from these principles. The establishment of the military school at Fontainebleau is a decided proof of this.  As Napoleon was an active observer of everything passing around him, and pronounced his opinion openly and decidedly, he did not remain long at the Military School of Paris. His superiors, who were anxious to get rid of him, accelerated the period of his examination, and he obtained the first vacant sub-lieutenancy in a regiment of artillery.  I left Brienne in 1787; and as I could not enter the artillery, I proceeded in the following year to Vienna, with a letter of recommendation to M. de Montmorin, soliciting employment in the French Embassy at the Court of Austria.  I remained two months at Vienna, where I had the honour of twice seeing the Emperor Joseph. The impression made upon me by his kind reception, his dignified and elegant manners, and graceful conversation, will never be obliterated from my recollection. After M. de Noailles had initiated me in the first steps of diplomacy, he advised me to go to one of the German universities to study the law of nations and foreign languages. I accordingly repaired to Leipsic, about the time when the French Revolution broke out.  I spent some time at Leipsic, where I applied myself to the study of the law of nations, and the German and English languages. I afterwards travelled through Prussia and Poland, and passed a part of the winter of 1791 and 1792 at Warsaw, where I was most graciously received by Princess Tyszicwiez, niece of Stanislaus Augustus, the last King of Poland, and the sister of Prince Poniatowski. The Princess was very well informed, and was a great admirer of French literature: At her invitation I passed several evenings in company with the King in a circle small enough to approach to something like intimacy. I remember that his Majesty frequently asked me to read the Moniteur; the speeches to which he listened with the greatest pleasure were those of the Girondists. The Princess Tyszicwiez wished to print at Warsaw, at her own expense, a translation I had executed of Kotzebue's 'Menschenhass and Reue, to which I gave the title of 'L'Inconnu'.      --[A play known on the English stage as The Stranger.]--  I arrived at Vienna on the 26th of March 1792, when I was informed of the serious illness of the Emperor, Leopold II, who died on the following day. In private companies, and at public places, I heard vague suspicions expressed of his having been poisoned; but the public, who were admitted to the palace to see the body lie in state, were soon convinced of the falsehood of these reports. I went twice to see the mournful spectacle, and I never"]]]
