Selden Irwin (or as he was familiarly called \"Sel\") was at this time in the very flush of manhood, full of life and ambition, with a plethora of good looks and activity. He was essentially a dashing actor, and pleased the public immensely. Mrs. Irwin was even more of a favorite than \"Sel.\" If not great, she was very versatile, and they gave Salt Lakers a series of plays of very great variety, embracing classic tragedy, comedy and farce. Everything from \"Camille\" and the \"Lady of Lyons\" to \"That Rascal Pat\" and \"In and Out of Place.\" With Mr. and Mrs. Irwin was Harry Rainforth, a boy of sixteen years, a son of Mrs. Irwin by a former marriage, who in after years became a well-known manager, being a partner with Bob Miles in the Grand Opera House at Cincinnati. Harry was quite an actor as a boy, and helped out the cast on several occasions; his most conspicuous effort, however, was Lord Dundreary in \"Our American Cousin,\" which was put up to give \"Sel\" a chance at \"Asa Trenchard.\" It is not of record that Harry ever became a formidable rival of Sothern's in this part, but on this occasion he filled the role very acceptably.  The Irwins remained as stock stars to the end of the season, which came to a close after the April Conference, 1864. They were well liked by the Utahns, and came back for a short starring engagement the season of '66, after making a tour of Idaho and Montana with a small road company. The Irwin engagement inaugurated the three night performances a week and Saturday matinees. This increased the work of the company to such an extent that they had to neglect to a greater or less degree their regular business, that on which they depended for their living, for it must be understood that there was no compensation attached, beyond the honor of acting in the Salt Lake Theatre. So there began to be some dissatisfaction with this part of the business, and complaints from some that they were neglecting their business for the theatre and ought to be made good, so it was arranged near the end of the season to give two benefit performances one for the gentlemen and the other for the ladies of the company, and then divide the results pro rata among the members of the company. This scheme was carried out and served to conciliate the players and smooth the way to another season's work for the managers.  The writer at this time was probably the youngest member of the company and had attained but little prominence, hence his \"divvy\" was a very modest one, yet quite acceptable, as it was unexpected. The following autograph letter of Brigham Young's will show the method adopted by the management to carry on the business and make the company contribute liberally to the building of the theatre:                             SALT LAKE CITY, April 15th, 1864.      _Mr. John S. Lindsay_.      DEAR BROTHER:--Inclosed please find Twenty Dollars, being amount     assigned you out of the proceeds of the Benefit recently given at     the theatre.      Appreciating your faithful services, and the alacrity with which     you have contributed to our amusement during the past season, I     pray God to bless you, and increase your ability to do good.      Your brother in the Gospel,                                BRIGHAM YOUNG.  This plan served to keep the company in a contented mood, and was repeated at the close of the following season with like result.  The writer had made some progress in the company, and at the next benefit got seventy-five dollars for his pro rata; this was less than a dollar a performance during the season of seven months, but then we were doing good missionary work, in the way of amusing the people, and this company were engaged in a labor they delighted in; while they were assisting in a great measure to pay for the great Thespian temple in which they were performing, they were enjoying the labor immensely and gave the same enthusiastic efforts to it they would have done to a mission, had they been called to go and preach the gospel. Moreover, they were gaining an experience in art that would have been perhaps impossible for them, had not this splendid theatre been erected in the home of the Saints. Brigham Young's comprehensive mind had grasped the advantage to his people of blending art with religion, and relieving the monotony of arduous pioneer toil with innocent and refreshing amusements.     CHAPTER VI.  SEASON OF '64-'65.  _A Metropolitan Theatre in the Wilderness_.   The Salt Lake Theatre was a source of wonder and admiration to all strangers visiting it. Considering the time and the place of its erection, the isolated condition of the people, the meagre facilities within reach for so big a project, the quadrupled cost of everything that had to be imported, such as glass, nails, paints, cloth for scenery and everything in the shape of decorations, it was then, and remains today, a monument to the liberality, foresight and enterprise of Brigham Young. Since its erection, forty-three years ago, theatrical architecture has been vastly improved, and in many respects the Salt Lake Theatre is old-fashioned, but few theatres in the country, with all the improvements which have been introduced, surpass it in point of comfort and convenience, especially behind the curtain. When it is considered that not only the architectural designs, the mechanical construction, but all the interior decorations and the scene-painting was done by local talent, it speaks highly for the artistic and mechanical skill that was centered in Salt Lake even at that early period of its history. William H. Folsom was the architect and personally superintended its construction. He was also the architect of the big Tabernacle with its turtle-shaped roof spanning a stretch of 150 feet without a supporting column. The first installment of scenery was painted by W. V. Morris and George M. Ottinger, both clever artists, and with their assistants they gave the theatre stage a very nice investiture in the way of scenery. As the seasons rolled around the stock of scenery was continuously growing, for every new play had to have something done for it in the way of scenery, so that the painters were always working, and as a consequence the Salt Lake Theatre has probably a larger stock of scenery than any theatre in the country. The same may be said in regard to the stage properties. \"Charley\" Millard was the property man, and Charley could manufacture anything in the shape of a \"prop\" from a throne chair to a cuspidor, from a papier mache cannon to a firecracker, from a basket horse to a baby; so that in the course of a dozen years the property room became a veritable museum, an \"old curiosity shop\" well worth an hour of anybody's time to examine.  There was a wardrobe department, which was equal in importance if not superior to the scenic arid property departments. This was presided over by Mr. Claud Clive, an expert tailor, who with his assistants, manufactured all the costumes for the male characters of the plays, while the female costume department was presided over by Mrs. Marion Bowring. Mr. Robert Neslen had general charge of the costume and wig department, and dispensed the necessary apparel and wigs to the company. There was also a tonsorial artist connected with the house, who was always there to curl a wig or put it on in good shape for the actors who needed such assistance. John Squires was the tonsorial artist--he was a busy man in those days. He had his shop in a little adobe house that stood directly opposite the \"President's Office\" on the lot where the Amelia Palace was afterwards erected. John was the President's barber, and had a large run of custom from the church and tithing offices, besides nearly all the actors patronized him, so that he was a prosperous man in the community. He continued to shave his share of the people up to within a recent date, when he was obliged to retire; \"age with his stealing steps had clawed him in his clutch,\" so this knight of the razor was reluctantly compelled to lay down the implements of tonsorial art, the strong steady hand that once could clean a man's cheek in about three strokes had grown weak and tremulous, and but recently he passed peacefully away to that better land where it is to be hoped there is no shaving or need of hair-dye. His place is amply filled, however, for John has a numerous progeny--and all his sons and grandsons, so far as we know them, are barbers. Here we find a true touch of heredity.  After such a brilliant and successful season as the Irwins had just concluded, it seemed like a daring venture to open up the ensuing season with the stock company unassisted by the strength of a star; but notwithstanding this seeming riskiness, the managers did not wait for the _ensuing season_, but bravely ushered in a supplemental season on May 14th. Only five weeks after the Irwins had closed their long and brilliant run, the stock were hard at it again, notwithstanding the summer days were come; they kept going till the 18th of June, when the \"veteran tragedian\" (Lyne, at the time 58 years of age) was engaged to reinforce the stock, and add to the box office receipts. He opened this, his second star engagement, on June 25th and played up to July 16th. He repeated all his former triumphs and achieved some new ones, notably in \"Sir Giles Overreach\" in \"A New Way to Pay Old Debts.\"  In the meantime a new star had appeared in our dramatic horizon; by the time Lyne had closed his engagement, it was in our ascendant, astrologically speaking, and by the time it had reached our zenith, or midheaven, it had shed another halo over the Salt Lake Theatre and the drama in Utah. This bright"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35565"],["title","The Mormons and the Theatre; or, The History of Theatricals in Utah (#8)"],["body","star was George Pauncefort. \"He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one,\" an actor of rare and varied accomplishments, and proved to be an invaluable instructor and model for the company. Under his leadership a great progress was made. Pauncefort was an English actor, who had acquired considerable celebrity on the London stage. He was a married actor, and his wife and several daughters, at the time of which I am writing, were quite popular on the stage, and their names appeared frequently in the London casts. Pauncefort came to the United States as early as 1858. He was the original \"Armand Duval\" in \"Camille,\" when Matilda Heron first produced that play in New York. After his New York engagement, Pauncefort drifted West, and in 1864 came to Salt Lake for a brief engagement of a week or two. He had just concluded a stellar engagement with Jack Langrishe at Denver. Denver at that time was not so large as Salt Lake City, nor could it boast anything like so good a theatre. The great overland road had not been projected at this time, and people crossing the country from Denver to Salt Lake or San Francisco were obliged \"to stage it,\" or travel with private conveyances. So George had to stage it, not a difficult thing for an actor to do. He was accompanied by Mrs. Florence Bell who was featured with him as co-star during his first engagement. He opened on July 20th, 1864, just four nights after Lyne closed, in \"The Romance of a Poor Young Man,\" in the character of \"Manuel,\" Mrs. Bell playing \"Marguerite.\" Pauncefort's \"Manuel\" made a great hit, and stamped him at once as an actor of superior parts. It was a new awakening. His style was so different from anything we had seen, either in Lyne or Irwin. Mrs. Bell, however, fell as far below public expectation as Pauncefort went above it. She was not the equal of our own leading lady, Mrs. Gibson who in consequence of this engagement had to be retired from the leading roles, and bear with what grace she might to see an inferior actress usurping her place. The popular verdict was all in Mrs. Gibson's favor. Mrs. Bell was a pretty woman, but a very mediocre actress. The management would gladly have retired the lady after the first performance, but there was a contract, and she was allowed to play the leads in several plays, during this engagement. Pauncefort played until September 30th, when the season closed.  It no doubt cost the princely George a pang to realize that Mrs. Bell had not made a favorable impression with the public, as he had featured her on the bills. She had found great favor in his eyes, if not so fortunate in gaining the public favor. Their admiration was mutual and so apparent that it was frowned upon by \"the powers that be.\" George was given plainly to understand that although Mormons believed in and practiced polygamy, they drew the line in morals at promiscuity, and he could not continue his present intimate relations with Mrs. Bell and his engagement at the Salt Lake Theatre. George took the hint and severed the \"entangling alliance;\" all the easier, no doubt, as Mr. Bell had come closely on their heels from Denver. Bell was a good cornet player, and secured an engagement in the Theatre Orchestra, where he played until the end of the Pauncefort season, and then drifted off to Montana, \"taking the fair Desdemona along with him.\"  That the Bell alliance worked to Pauncefort's injury there is no question. President Young took great offense at it, and never attended the theatre during Pauncefort's engagement after the opening performances, when he became apprised of the intimacy existing between George and Florence. On Brigham's first visit to the theatre after the Pauncefort season, the writer met him on the stage near his box and took occasion to express his pleasure at seeing him occupy his accustomed seat after so long an absence, remarking, \"It is a long time since you were here, President Young.\" \"Yes,\" he replied. \"I told John T. and Hyrum (the managers of the house) that I would not come into the theatre while that man Pauncefort was here.\" This showed how strong a prejudice he had conceived against Pauncefort--and notwithstanding the very favorable impression his acting had made, it was quite a long time, nearly four months, before he again appeared.  The Lyne and Pauncefort engagement following each other in such close succession and in an extra season, and that season a mid-summer one, had given the theatre-going public a very gratifying sufficiency of theatricals, and consequently it was not thought advisable to open the theatre again until the ensuing October Conference; so the house was closed up for a period of five weeks and reopened on the 5th of October, just in time to catch the Conference gatherings. Although both Lyne and Pauncefort were in the vicinity, neither of them were engaged until after the Conference dates were passed. The management could rely on full houses during the Conference and could not see the policy of sharing up the profits with a star when the stock company could fill the house to its capacity. The Conference over, the following week T. A. Lyne opened his third engagement and played up to the 10th of December; a very long engagement, lasting eight weeks. Pauncefort should naturally, according to all professional ways of looking at it, have filled this time; and no doubt would have had the preference over Lyne if the managers had not been handicapped by the strong prejudice of the \"President\" against this actor; for he was the newer and more attractive star. Lyne had already played two long engagements and exhausted his repertoire, besides Pauncefort had introduced us to a more modern and popular school, and from financial considerations alone, any manager would have given him the preference, but he did not get back into the theatre for a second engagement until after Lyne had played everything he knew; still he lingered in the vicinity. He went out through the provinces--played smaller towns, such as Springville and Provo, with their home companies--and dabbled in merchandising, shipping fruit to Montana; it was bringing big prices just then. On the 17th of December, 1864, George Pauncefort began his second engagement in \"A Bachelor of Arts\" and \"Black-Eyed Susan.\" It was during this engagement that \"Hamlet\" and \"Macbeth\" had their initial performances in the Salt Lake Theatre. Both of these plays were marked events in the history of the theatre, more particularly \"Macbeth,\" which called into requisition the Tabernacle choir to play the witches and sing the music of the play, which was ably conducted by Prof. C. J. Thomas.  \"Macbeth\" was the last play of this engagement and closed the second Pauncefort season on January 7th, 1865--a brief season of three weeks--after waiting around about four months. Why this engagement ended so suddenly in the very height of its brilliancy is somewhat puzzling to understand, as there was no other star to follow, and the stock company played unassisted by any stellar attraction up till May 20th, which closed the season of '64 and '65.  Pauncefort shortly after the closing of his engagement went to San Francisco, where he remained for more than two years playing there at intervals.     CHAPTER VII.  SEASON '65 AND '66.   The next star to appear at the Mormon theatre was Julia Dean Hayne, and a brilliant one she proved to be. She created on her first appearance an impression that was profound and lasting, and each additional character she appeared in only served to strengthen her hold on the admiration and affection of her audiences.  The advent of such a well-known and popular actress into the heart of the Rocky Mountain region at such a time, years before the completion of the overland railroad, had in it a rich tinge of romance and wild managerial venture. Julia Dean came to Salt Lake City under the management and in the dramatic company of the veteran Western manager, John S. Potter. Some time prior to this she had gone to San Francisco from New York by way of the Isthmus, had played a successful engagement there, and being \"at liberty\" after it was over, Mr. Potter, who was an old acquaintance of Mrs. Hayne, made her a proposition to organize a company and play her through the principal towns of California. This was done, and after the state had been pretty thoroughly toured, the fair Julia appearing in many places that had very \"queer\" theatres, the tour was extended through the cities of Oregon and then through the sparsely inhabited territories of Montana, Idaho and Utah, finally arriving in Salt Lake July 26th, 1865, on a regular old-time stage coach, a tired and jaded-looking party. There was in this company John S. Potter, manager (then a man of sixty or more), Julia Deane Hayne (the star), George B. Waldron (leading man), Mr. and Mrs. O. F. Leslie (juveniles), Mr. A. K. Mortimer (heavies), Charles Graham (comedian). Mr. Potter himself played the \"old man\" parts, Miss Belle Douglas playing characters and old woman parts, and \"Jimmie\" Martin, property man and filling-in parts. The fame of Brigham Young's theatre had reached them in their travels, and they had traveled many miles to get the opportunity of playing in it. A week's engagement was soon effected, and on August 11th, 1865, \"The Potter Company\" with Julia Dean Hayne as the stellar character, opened up in the play of \"Camille.\" They were received by a packed house, and with every demonstration of welcome and approbation. Mrs. Hayne, who was no longer girlish in face and figure but a mature woman, verging on towards the \"fair, fat and forty\" period, was nevertheless so exquisitely beautiful and girlish-looking when made up for \"Camille\" or \"Julia\" in the \"Hunchback,\" that everybody sang her praises. The entire community seemed to have fallen irresistibly in love with the new star, and henceforward she had fair wind and smooth sailing while her lot lay cast among the Saints.
