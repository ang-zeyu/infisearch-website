In 1895 the average price of beef cattle in the principal markets of this country was $4.40 per hundredweight; in 1900, it had increased to $5.80; in 1907 the average was $7.60; in 1910, $8.85; in 1911, $9.35; in 1912, $10.25; in 1915, $11.60; and in 1916, about $11.90 per hundredweight.  The foregoing market prices tell the story of the cattle industry from a financial standpoint.  The following prices paid in 1901 and in 1916 for prize-winning exhibition beeves--at the International Live Stock Exposition held annually in Chicago, at the Union Stock Yards--well illustrate the trend of the cattle market:  In 1901, the Grand Champion carload of fat cattle was two-year-old stock, weighing an average of 1,497 pounds, and sold in the auction ring at $12 per hundredweight.  In 1916, the Grand Champion carload of fat cattle was one-year-old stock, weighing an average of 1,146 pounds, and sold in the auction ring at $28 per hundredweight.  In 1901, the Grand Champion Steer was two years old, weighed 1,600 pounds, and sold in the auction ring at 50 cents per pound.  In 1916, the Grand Champion Steer was one year old, weighed 1,120 pounds, and sold in the auction ring at $1.75 per pound.  The following top prices were paid in the auction ring of the Exposition for \"show cattle\" of various weights:      Cattle Weighing      Price in    Per Hundredweight     900 to 1050 pounds      1901          $ 8.70    900 to 1050 pounds      1916           17.75   1050 to 1200 pounds      1901            9.50   1050 to 1200 pounds      1916           28.00   1200 to 1350 pounds      1901            8.75   1200 to 1350 pounds      1916           20.00   1350 to 1500 pounds      1901           12.00   1350 to 1500 pounds      1916           18.50   1500 to 1900 pounds      1901            9.30   1500 to 1900 pounds      1916           15.75     [Illustration]     Transcriber's Notes:     Text in italics is enclosed with underscores: _italics_."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36651"],["title","The Castle of Andalusia: A Comic Opera, in Three Acts (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: CASTLE OF ANDALUSIA   PEDRILLO--OH! YOU MOST BEAUTIFUL GODDESS.   ACT II. SCENE I.   PAINTED BY SINGLETON. PUBLISH'D BY LONGMAN & CO. ENGRAVED BY C. WARREN.   1807.]       THE CASTLE OF ANDALUSIA;  A COMIC OPERA, IN THREE ACTS;  By JOHN O'KEEFFE, Esq.  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL, COVENT GARDEN.  PRINTED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE MANAGERS FROM THE PROMPT BOOK.  WITH REMARKS BY MRS. INCHBALD.    LONDON:    PRINTED FOR LONGMAN, HURST, REES, ORME, AND BROWN,   PATERNOSTER-ROW.     EDINBURGH:   Printed by James Ballantyne & Co.     REMARKS.   A reader must be acquainted with O'Keeffe on the stage to admire him in the closet. Yet he is entitled to more praise, in being the original author of a certain species of drama, made up of whim and frolic than numberless retailers of wit and sentiment with whom that class of readers are charmed, who are not in the habit of detecting plagiarism.  From Operas, since the Beggar's Opera, little has been required by the town except music and broad humour. The first delights the elegant, the second the inelegant part of an audience; by which means all parties are gratified.  Had O'Keeffe written less, his reputation would have stood higher with the public; and so would that of many an author beside himself: but when a man makes writing his only profession--industry, and prudent forecast for the morrow, will often stimulate him to produce, with heavy heart, that composition which his own judgment condemns. Yet is he compelled to bear the critic's censure, as one whom vanity has incited to send forth crude thoughts with his entire good will, and perfect security as to the high value they will have with the world.  Let it be known to the world, that more than half the authors who come before them thus apparently bold and self-approved, are perhaps sinking under the shame of their puerile works, and discerning in them more faults, from closer attention and laudable timidity, than the most severe of their censurers can point out.  These observations might be some apology for this Opera, if it required any. But it has pleased so well in representation, that its deserts as an exhibition are acknowledged; and if in reading there should appear something of too much intricacy in the plot, or of improbability in the events, the author must be supposed to have seen those faults himself; though want of time, or, most likely, greater reliance upon the power of music than upon his own labour, impelled him gladly to spare the one, in reverence to the other.  The songs have great comic effect on the stage; particularly those by some of the male characters: and the mistakes which arise from the impositions of Spado are highly risible.  As the reader, to form a just judgment on \"The Castle of Andalusia,\" should see it acted; so the auditor, to be equally just, must read it.     DRAMATIS PERSONÆ.

SCENE I.      _A Cavern with winding Stairs, and recesses cut in the Rock; a     large Lamp hanging in the Centre; a Table, Wine, Fruits, &c. in     disorder.--At the Head DON CÆSAR; on each Side SPADO, SANGUINO,     RAPINO, and others of the Banditti._   AIR I. AND CHORUS.    Don Cæsar. _Here we sons of freedom dwell,_   _In our friendly, rock-hewn cell;_   _Pleasure's dictates we obey,_   _Nature points us out the way,_   _Ever social, great and free,_   _Valour guards our liberty._  AIR.    Don Cæsar. _Of severe and partial laws,_     _Venal judges, Alguazils;_   _Dreary dungeons' iron jaws,_     _Oar and gibbet--whips or wheels,_   _Let's never think_   _While thus me drink_   _Sweet Muscadine_!   _O life divine!_    Chorus.--_Here we sons of freedom dwell_, &c.  _Don Cæsar._ Come, cavaliers, our carbines are loaded, our hearts are light: charge your glasses, Bacchus gives the word, and a volley makes us immortal as the rosy god.--Fire!  _Spado._ Ay, captain, this is noble firing--Oh, I love a volley of grape-shot.--Are we to have any sky-light in our cave?                                          [_Looking at SANGUINO's Glass._  _Don Cæsar._ Oh, no! a brimmer round.--Come, a good booty to us to-night.                                                            [_All drink._  _Spado._ Booty! Oh, I love to rob a fat priest.--Stand, says I, and then I knock him down.  _Sang._ My nose bleeds. [_Looks at his Handkerchief._] I wonder what colour is a coward's blood?  _Spado._ Don't you see it's red?  _Sang._ Ha! call me coward, [_Rises in fury._] sirrah? Captain! cavaliers!--But this scar on my forehead contradicts the miscreant.  _Spado._ Scar on your forehead!--Ay, you will look behind you, when you run away.  _Sang._ I'll stab the villain--[_Draws Stilletto._]--I will, by Heaven.  _Don Cæsar._ Pho, Sanguino! you know when a jest offers, Spado regards neither time, place, nor person.  _All._ [_Interposing._] Don't hurt little Spado.  _Spado._ [_Hiding behind._] No, don't hurt little Spado.  _Sang._ Run away! Armies have confessed my valour: the time has been--but no matter.                                                                 [_Sits._  _Don Cæsar._ Come, away with reflection on the past, or care for the future; the present is the golden moment of possession.--Let us enjoy it.  _All._ Ay, ay, let us enjoy it.  _Don Cæsar._ You know, cavaliers, when I entered into this noble fraternity, I boasted only of a little courage sharpened by necessity, the result of my youthful follies, a father's severity, and the malice of a good-natured dame.  _Spado._ Captain, here's a speedy walk-off to old women.  _All._ [_Drink_] Ha! ha! ha! ha!  _Don Cæsar._ When you did me the honour to elect me your captain, two conditions I stipulated:----Though at war with the world abroad, unity and social mirth should preside over our little commonwealth at home.  _Spado._ Yes, but Sanguino's for no head--he'll have ours a commonwealth of fists and elbows.  _Don Cæsar._ The other, unless to preserve your own lives, never commit a murder.  _Spado._ I murdered since that----a bishop's coach-horse.  _All._ Ha! ha! ha!  _Don Cæsar._ Hand me that red wine.   AIR II.--DON CÆSAR.      _Flow, thou regal purple stream,_     _Tinctur'd by the solar beam,_     _In my goblet sparkling rise,_     _Cheer my heart and glad my eyes._   _My brain ascend on fancy's wing,_   _'Noint me, wine, a jovial king._     _While I live, I'll lave my clay,_     _When I'm dead and gone away,_     _Let my thirsty subjects say,_     _A month he reign'd, but that was May._  [_Thunder._]  _Don Cæsar._ Hark, how distinct we hear the thunder through this vast body of earth and rock.--Rapino, is Calvette above, upon his post?  _Rap._ Yes.  _Don Cæsar._ Spado, 'tis your business to relieve the centinel.  _Spado._ Relieve! what's the matter with him?  _Don Cæsar._ Come, come, no jesting with duty--'tis your watch.  _Spado._ Let the wolves watch for me--my duty is to get supper ready.--[_Thunder._]--Go up! Od's fire, do you think I'm a Salamander?--D'ye hear?  _Sang._ No sport, I fear.  _Don Cæsar._ Then call Calvette, lock down the trap-door, and get us some more wine from the cistern.  _Spado._ Wine! Ay, captain; and this being a night of peace, we'll have a dish of olives.  _Sang._ No, peace! we'll up and scour the forest presently. But well thought on; a rich old fellow, one Don Scipio, has lately come to reside in the castle on the skirts of the forest--what say you to plunder there?  _Don Cæsar._ Not to-night--I know my time--I have my reasons--I shall give command on that business. But where's the stranger we brought in at our last excursion?  _Rap._ He reposes in yonder recess.  _Spado._ Ay, egad, there he lies, with a face as innocent--[_Aside._]--If my fellow-rooks would but fly off, I'd have the pigeon here within all to myself.  _Cal._ [_Appears at the Top of the winding Stairs, with a Lanthorn._] A booty.  _Sang._ Good news, cavaliers; here comes Calvette.  _Cal._ A booty!  _Sang._ What! where?  _Cal._ Soft--but one man!  _Sang._ But one man! Is he alone?  _Cal._ Quite.  _Spado._ One man, and alone--that's odd!  _Cal._ He seems in years, but his habit, as well as I could distinguish, speaks him noble.                                                             [_Descends._  _Don Cæsar._ Then he'll fight.--My arms!  _Spado._ Oh, he'll fight--get my arms; no, my legs will do for me.                                                                [_Aside._  _Sang._ Come, my carbine--quick!  _Don Cæsar._ To the attack of one man--paltry! Only you, Calvette, Sanguino, Rapino, and Spado go; the rest prepare for our general excursion.  _Spado._ Captain, don't send me; indeed I'm too rash!  _Don Cæsar._ Come, come, leave buffoonery, and to your duty.                  [_CALVETTE and RAPINO ascend; the rest go in at several                          Recesses; SPADO, the last, ascends up slowly._  _Enter DON ALPHONSO._  _Don Alph._ I find myself somewhat refreshed by my slumber; at such a time to fall into the hands of these ruffians, how unlucky! I'm pent up here; my rival, Fernando, once my friend, reaches Don Scipio's castle, weds my charming Victoria, and I lose her for ever; but if I could secure an interview, love should plead my cause.
