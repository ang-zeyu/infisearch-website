AND E. RAYMOND HALL   Several full species of the genus _Geomys_ have been recorded from Kansas. The purpose of the study now reported upon was to determine the present taxonomic status of these animals and the distribution of each within the boundaries of Kansas. No pocket gopher of any kind has been reported from the southeastern part of the state; in all other parts _Geomys_ is locally common.     HISTORY   The first published reference that we have found to pocket gophers of Kansas is Prof. Spencer F. Baird's (1857:377, 380) mention of two specimens from Fort Riley. One he identified as _Geomys bursarius_ (p. 377) and the other (p. 380) he doubtfully referred to _Geomys breviceps_. Both specimens were obtained by Dr. W. A. Hammond. J. A. Allen (1874:49) reported pocket gophers from Kansas under the generic name \"Geomys?\". Professor M. V. B. Knox (1875:21) published a list of Kansas mammals in which he used the names _Geomys bursarius_ Shaw and _Geomys breviceps_ Baird, the last one for the specimen taken by Dr. Hammond, at Fort Riley. Baker (1889:57) employed the name _Geomys bursarius_ Rich. for the gopher \"found along the hundredth meridian, between N latitude 38° 30' and 39° 30'.\" He reported this animal as common in western Kansas. Merriam (1895:129) recorded _G. bursarius_ and _G. lutescens_ from Kansas. Allen (1895:265) recorded five specimens of _Geomys lutescens_ collected between September 16 and October 13 at Long Island, Phillips County, Kansas, by W. W. Granger. Since that time several papers, some of them dealing mostly with habits of pocket gophers, have been published in which reference is made to _Geomys_ in Kansas. Hibbard (1933:240) recognized three species: _G. bursarius_, _G. lutescens_, and _G. breviceps llanensis_. In 1944 (74-75) he recorded _Cratogeomys_ from Meade County, on the basis of two skulls dug out of the ground, and he recognized the same three full species of the genus _Geomys_ that he did in 1933, along with two additional subspecies.  Specimens to the total number of 335 from Kansas have been available for the present study of the five subspecies recognized. The reason for arranging all of the named kinds as subspecies of a single species is that intergradation has been found to occur between every pair of kinds having contiguous geographic ranges. The characters previously thought by some writers constantly to differentiate, say, _Geomys lutescens_ of western Kansas from _Geomys bursarius_ of eastern Kansas, prove not to do so; instead, in areas geographically intermediate between the geographic ranges of the two kinds, the pocket gophers are intermediate in morphological characters and therefore are regarded as intergrades. Intergradation of this kind here is accepted as the criterion of subspecies, and lack of such intergradation as the criterion of species. Search for structural characters, distinctive of the different kinds, additional to those characters noted by other writers, has resulted in the finding of a few such characters but they too are subject to intergradation. Therefore the several kinds are arranged as subspecies of a single species which takes the name _Geomys bursarius_ because it is the oldest available name. Detailed comment on specimens showing intergradation are to be found in the accounts of _G. b. bursarius_ and _G. b. major_.     METHODS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The series with the largest number of individuals from one restricted locality was selected for initial study. These individuals were segregated by sex, and specimens of each sex were arranged from oldest to youngest. Each series was divided into age-groups, and within a given age-group of one sex from one locality of what was considered as one species, estimation was made of the amount of individual variation. Thus, it was possible when comparing different kinds of pocket gophers to use only one age class of one season of one sex.  Age was estimated to some extent by size of animal and nature of its pelage. The immature pelage is grayer and the hair is more crinkled than in adults. A more certain guide to age, however, is furnished by the skull. With increasing age some sutures disappear, the rostrum increases in length and the ridges marking the limits of the temporal muscles come to fuse and eventually, in males, form a high sagittal crest.    Cranial measurements were taken as follows:    Basilar length.--From the anteriormost inferior border of the   foramen magnum to a line connecting the posteriormost margins   of the alveoli of the first upper incisors.    Length of the nasals.--The greatest length of the nasals.    Zygomatic breadth.--The greatest distance across the zygomatic   arches.    Mastoid breadth.--The greatest distance across the mastoids.    Breadth of rostrum.--Width, perpendicular to long axis of the   skull.    Interorbital constriction.--The least distance between the   orbits.    Maxillary tooth row.--The greatest length of the upper   molariform tooth row at the alveolar border.    Extension of premaxillae posterior to nasals.--From the   posteriormost border of the nasals to the posterior end of the   extension of a premaxilla.    Depth of skull.--From the median suture of the frontals, on the   dorsal surface of the skull to the median suture of the   palatines at the level of the first molar (not premolar).    Length of rostrum.--From the anterior border of the nasal to   the maxilla at the lateral end of the hamulus of the lacrimal.    In the list of specimens examined, localities are arranged by   counties from west to east, beginning at the northwestern   corner of the state; specimens in each county are arranged from   north to south. If several localities are in the same latitude,   the westernmost is listed first. Capitalized color terms are   after Ridgway, Color Standards and Color Nomenclature,   Washington, D. C., 1912.

Vol. 1 No. 11] (#1)"],["body","discussion of Merriam's account of the distribution of _Geomys lutescens_ in Kansas is given by Swenk (1940:11-12).  Judging by specimens in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History, _G. bursarius lutescens_ in Kansas is restricted to the northwestern part of the state, reaching southward certainly to Scott County and eastward certainly to Ellis County; precise limits of distribution of this subspecies are unknown. Additional collecting is necessary to determine where the range of _lutescens_ meets the ranges of the other subspecies. The specimens studied are remarkably uniform. One specimen obtained in October, in Trego County, is slightly lighter colored than any other from Kansas. In other characteristics it agrees with specimens from northwestern Kansas and from the type locality.    _Specimens examined._--Total number 32, as follows: _Cheyenne   County_: 23 mi. (by road) NW St. Francis, 3. _Rawlins County_:   2 mi. NE Ludell, 10. _Logan County_: 5 mi. W Elkader, 3; no   locality more precise than county, 1. _Trego County_: Wakeeney,   4; 12 mi.

Size: Large, total    length averaging more than 280 mm. in males and 257 in females;    hind foot averaging 35 mm. or more in males. Skull: Large;    rostrum averaging more than twice as long as wide; sagittal    crest high in males and barely present in females; occiput    vertical when skull is laid top down; least width of braincase    less than    distance from alveolus of upper incisor to middle of lateral    border of P^4 at alveolar border.  _Comparisons._--From _Geomys bursarius lutescens_, _majusculus_ differs as follows: Color darker, Mummy Brown to Prout's Brown instead of Buckthorn Brown. In both sexes: head and body a fifth to a sixth longer; hind foot 5 to 6 per cent longer; skull averaging larger in all parts measured except that premaxillae (in each subspecies) extend equally far posteriorly to nasals; diastema longer in relation to basilar length; rostrum longer relative to its width; sagittal crest higher; rostrum often more depressed distally; angle of suture between maxilla and jugal more obtuse.  From _G. b. bursarius_, according to Swenk (1939:6), _majusculus_ differs in larger size.  From _G. b. illinoensis_, _majusculus_, according to Komarek and Spencer (1931:405), differs in brownish instead of slate-gray coloration and in two cranial characters as follows: Nasals straight-sided instead of shaped like an hour-glass, and superficial canals on palatine extending anteriorly beyond first molar, and from there anteriorly more or less separated. The first of these characters does not always hold; occasional individuals of _majusculus_, for example some from Douglas County, have the nasals shaped like an hour-glass.  From _G. breviceps dutcheri_, _majusculus_ differs in larger size (hind foot more than 33 mm. in males, and 29 in females; basilar length more than 42 mm. in males and 36 in females); dorsal exposure of jugal longer than width of rostrum measured between ventral margins of infraorbital foramina.  From _G. bursarius major_ of southcentral Kansas (for example Harvey County), _majusculus_ differs in slightly darker color, being Mummy Brown instead of Prout's Brown; size larger (in males total length more than 284 mm., hind foot 35 or more, basilar length of skull more than 42, and in females total length 265 or more, hind foot averaging 33 or more, and basilar length 40 or more).  Skull: Averaging larger in all parts measured, except that premaxillae do not extend so far posteriorly to nasals in either males or females; interorbital constriction slightly narrower in adult females; temporal ridges forming a more prominent sagittal crest in adult males (sagittal crest barely present in some adult males of _major_ from Harper County).  _Remarks._--In employing the subspecific name _majusculus_ we are following Swenk (1939:6) who on the basis of larger size differentiated the animals from southeastern South Dakota, the eastern parts of Nebraska and Kansas, and the western and southern parts of Iowa, from _G. bursarius bursarius_ to which he assigned a more northern geographic range. In the absence of comparative materials of the northern subspecies we cannot make an independent decision on the validity of _majusculus_ and recognize that if it is inseparable from _G. b. bursarius_ the latter name will apply to specimens from northeastern Kansas. We are the more uncertain about applying the name _majusculus_ to specimens from eastern Kansas because they average smaller than topotypes. Only at the northeasternmost locality in Kansas (3 mi. N Cummings, Atchison County) do specimens average as large as topotypes of _majusculus_. Farther southward they become progressively smaller in eastern Kansas, and we interpret this as intergradation with the still smaller subspecies _major_, to the southwest. The average external measurements of two adult males from Atchison County are: 321-99-35. Thirty-six miles farther south, in Douglas County, 16 adult males average 289-80-36. From Hamilton, Greenwood County, 80 miles farther southwest, nine adult males average 284-83-35. The maximum total length recorded at these three localities is: Atchison County, 342 (1 of 2 specimens), Douglas County, 308 (1 of 16 specimens), Greenwood County, 357 (in coll. of Dr. Glenn C. Rinker and 1 of 15 males of all ages involved). It will be seen, therefore, that although there is a trend to smaller average size toward the southward, the maximum of 357 millimeters total length at Hamilton exceeds the maximum of 352 millimeters recorded by Swenk (1939:3) among 86 males at Lincoln where the recorded average is largest.  Four specimens from Salina (Debold Farm) are intermediate structurally, as they are also geographically, between _G. b. majusculus_ on the one hand and _Geomys bursarius lutescens_ and _Geomys bursarius major_ on the other hand. In color they agree with _majusculus_, as they do also in width of nasals posteriorly, in more obtuse angle of the rostrum and maxillary arm of the zygomatic arch. They agree with _G. b. lutescens_ in having the occiput inclined anterodorsally, and are intermediate between _majusculus_ and _lutescens_, but nearer the latter in size of skull and in length of the rostrum relative to its width.    _Specimens examined._--Total number, 148, as follows: _Clay   County_: 6 mi.
