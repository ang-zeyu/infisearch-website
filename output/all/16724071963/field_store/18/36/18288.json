There were no troops within a mile of the place.  The two men who formed the crew of the monoplane were feverishly tackling the work of making good the damage.  One of the wires actuating the elevating gear had been cut through by a chance Belgian bullet--one amongst a thousand more that had been fired at the troublesome Taube.  \"Surrender!\" shouted Kenneth, advancing to within fifty feet of the aviators and levelling his revolver.  Rollo, cooler than his companion, steadied the barrel of his heavy pistol in the crook of his arm.  The pilot had been so engrossed in his work that he had not noticed the arrival of the lads.  At the sound of Kenneth's voice he had just completed the joining up of the severed wire.  He made a rush to the propeller and began to swing it in order to start the engine.  This was more than Kenneth had bargained for.  It seemed too much like shooting down a man in cold blood.  He need not have been so chivalrous, for the next instant a bullet tore through his hair and sent his cap a couple of yards away.  The observer of the Taube had, at the first alarm, flung himself upon the ground and had fired at the lad with a rifle.  Before the man could thrust home a fresh cartridge Kenneth was snug behind a rise in the ground.  Rollo, twenty paces to the right, had likewise taken cover.  The powerful motor was now working.  The propeller blades glittered like a circle of light as they revolved with a terrific buzz.  The draught of the propeller threw up a cloud of dust as high as a three-storied house.  Through the haze thus caused the lads could distinguish the forms of the aviators as they scrambled into their seats.  Both dispatch-riders emptied the contents of their revolvers, perhaps a little wildly, but the result was none the less disastrous to the Taube.  There was a blinding flash, a report, and a rush of air that drove the dust-cloud in all directions.  One of the bullets had pierced the petrol-tank, and a spark had done the rest.  In an instant the Taube was enveloped in flame.  The pilot, his hands held to his face, was stumbling blindly away from the inferno, his clothes burning furiously.  The observer ran for nearly twenty yards, spun round thrice, and collapsed.  Rollo was the one in this instance to take the initiative.  He ran to the pilot, tripped him up, and began to heap handfuls of dust upon his burning clothing.  By Kenneth's aid the flames were extinguished, but by this time the unfortunate German was unconscious.  As for the observer, he was found severely wounded, one of the heavy revolver bullets having passed completely through his shoulder.  \"Now, what's to be done?\" asked Rollo, as the lads ejected the expended ammunition and reloaded their revolvers.  \"Carry on with the dispatch, of course,\" replied Kenneth.  \"We can do no more here.  Hello!  Here are the Belgian cavalry.\"  Up rode a patrol of lancers.  Dismounting, and leaving their horses in charge of one-third of their number, the men advanced.  The officer in charge took in the situation at a glance, for the twelve empty revolver cartridges on the ground told their own tale.  \"You had better proceed; enough time has already been wasted,\" he said, when he learnt the mission of the dispatch-riders.  \"We will attend to these.\"  \"That's a nasty knock,\" observed Rollo ruefully, as they hurried back to their motor-cycles.  \"H'm, yes,\" admitted his companion reluctantly.  \"Perhaps the chap was a bit nettled because his men didn't bag the Taube.\"  But as they rode past the scene of their exploit the Captain called his men to attention--a tribute to the resource and daring of the British lads.  Already the Belgian cavalrymen had shown signs of their humanity, for by means of their lances two stretchers had been improvised, and the wounded aviators were on the way to one of the hospitals in the beleaguered city.     CHAPTER VIII  In British Uniforms  Shells were intermittently dropping upon the houses and in the streets as Kenneth and Rollo entered the apparently deserted city of Liége. The majority of the inhabitants, their numbers augmented by hundreds of terrified refugees from the surrounding villages, had taken refuge in cellars, while crowds, under the mistaken belief in the immunity of the churches from shell-fire, had sought doubtful shelter in the sacred edifices.  Others, again, fearful at the threat of von Emmich to begin a general bombardment upon the city unless the forts surrendered--a threat that the gallant General Leman treated with contempt--were boarding the last trains to leave Liége.  The day was excessively hot and close.  The wind that had blown strongly during the preceding night had dropped.  Several of the houses had taken fire, and the pungent smell of smoke filled the air. Frequently, before the dispatch-riders reached their destination, they were compelled to slacken pace, owing to the clouds of smoke that drifted slowly across the almost deserted streets.  They found the commandant, with several of his staff, calmly engaged in his work, and heedless of the fact that several shells had already burst in front of the Palace of Justice in which he had taken up his quarters.  Commandant Fleurus was a short, stocky man of about fifty, and rather inclined to corpulence.  His head was as bald as an egg, with the exception of a ring of jet-black hair like a monkish tonsure.  His eyes were small, resembling black beads, and rapid in their movements.  He was writing when Kenneth was shown in.  Without moving his head, which was slightly inclined, he fixed the dispatch-rider with his piercing stare.  \"Message, sir, from Major le Tourneur.\"  The commandant took the letter and, with a swift movement, tore open the flap of the envelope.  \"This is marked 7.15 a.m.!\" he exclaimed.  \"It's now a quarter to nine. Why this delay?\"  \"We--that is, my comrade--crippled a Taube, sir.\"  \"Crippled a Taube?  What, pray, has a dispatch-rider to do with Taubes?\" demanded Commandante Fleurus sternly.  \"Do you know that it is your duty to deliver messages at all costs, and in the least possible time, regardless of Taubes, Zeppelins, and the German Emperor himself?\"  Kenneth did not reply.  The fiery nature of the little Belgian literally consumed him.  He had, however, the good sense to see that the rebuke was merited.  \"Well, sir, what have you to say?\"  \"It was an error of judgment, sir, which I regret,\" said Kenneth.  \"We crippled the Taube as it was on the point of rising.  Otherwise----\"  \"Were there no troops available?\"  \"Some lancers arrived while the Taube was burning.\"  The commandant turned and took hold of a telephone that stood on the table at his side.  \"Send Captain Planchenoît to me,\" he ordered; then, leaning back in his chair, he again fixed the British lad with his beady eyes.  It was quite two minutes before the captain appeared, and the time seemed like two hours to the crestfallen Kenneth.  He had yet to learn the lesson that cast-iron discipline demands, and it seemed galling that his part in crippling one of the aerial spies should be practically ignored by the man who ought to have gone into ecstasies over the news.  Presently Captain Planchenoît entered, clicked his heels and saluted, then waited his superior officer's pleasure.  The captain was a smart-looking man of more than average height, with a pleasant, open countenance.  He was on the intelligence staff, attached to the brigade that had been hurriedly brought up from Diest.  \"Any information respecting the destruction of one of the enemy's aeroplanes?\" demanded the commandant.  \"Yes, mon commandant.  It descended near the village of Jupille. Before our lancers could approach it took fire.  Our men found both pilot and observer wounded and brought them back.  The captain of the troop reported that the Taube was set on fire by the pistol-shots of two dispatch-riders.\"  \"At any risk to themselves?\"  \"I know not, sir.\"  \"At any risk?\" repeated Commandant Fleurus, shifting his glance from Captain Planchenoît to Kenneth.  In reply the lad removed his Belgian military cap and pointed to the double hole made by the German observer's bullet.  To Kenneth's surprise the commandant leant back in his chair and gave vent to a hearty laugh.  Then he stood up and grasped the hand of the astonished youth.  \"Go, bring in your compatriot,\" he exclaimed.  \"What's the game, old man?\" asked Rollo, who was cooling his heels in the corridor.  \"Goodness knows!  I can't make the little commandant out.  He's an enigma.  I've had a gruelling.  Come along.\"  Kenneth jerked out his sentences awkwardly, then, catching hold of his chum's arm, led him into the commandant's presence.  \"Captain Planchenoît,\" said the latter, after returning Rollo's salute. \"You applied for two additional dispatch-riders, I believe?\"  \"That is so, mon commandant,\" replied the captain.  \"Good!  Now listen to this, you brave Englishmen.  This is the dispatch you brought.  It is from Major Résimont: 'In reply to your request for dispatch-riders I send you two English motor-cyclists, MM. Kenneth Everest and Rollo Barrington.  From what I already know of them they are courageous and resolute, and their services are likely to be of more use in the operations before Brussels than within the fortress of Barchon.  More so in view of the possible early appearance of the English forces who are to co-operate with the Belgian armies in the field.'\"  \"It is very good of Major Résimont to speak so well of us,\" said Kenneth.  \"Of course we must go where we are ordered, and that willingly; but we should be sorry to part from Major Résimont and the 9th Regiment of the Line.\"  \"It does not necessarily mean severing your connection with your old regiment--if old I might term it,\" declared the commandant.  \"In strict confidence I may tell you--I know that English gentlemen are always honourable--that perhaps before to-morrow we must abandon the city to the invaders.

EDITOR'S PREFACE.   Dr. N. Annandale's volume on the Freshwater SPONGES, POLYZOA, and HYDRIDA contains an account of three of the chief groups of freshwater organisms. Although he deals mainly with Indian forms the book contains an unusually full account of the life-history and bionomics of freshwater Sponges, Polyzoa, and Hydrozoa.  I have to thank Dr. Annandale for the great care he has taken in the preparation of his manuscript for the press, and also the Trustees of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, for their kindness in placing material at the disposal of the Author.
