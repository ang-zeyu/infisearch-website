Time fails me to speak of Erasmus, De Thou, Grotius, Goethe, Bodley; Hans Sloane, whose private library of fifty thousand volumes was the beginning of that of the British Museum; the Cardinal Borromeo, who founded the Ambrosian Library at Milan with his own forty thousand volumes, and the other great names entitled to the description of Bibliomaniac. We must not forget Sir Richard Whittington, of feline fame, who gave 400 pounds to found the library of Christ's Hospital, London.  The fair sex, good and bad, have been lovers of books or founders of libraries; witness the distinguished names of Lady Jane Gray, Catherine De Medicis, and Diane de Poictiers.  It only remains to speak of the great opium-eater, who was a sort of literary ghoul, famed for borrowing books and never returning them, and whose library was thus made up of the enforced contributions of friends--for who would have dared refuse the loan of a book to Thomas de Quincey? The name of the unhappy man would have descended to us with that of the incendiary of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus. But the great Thomas was recklessly careless and slovenly in his use of books; and Burton, in the \"Book-hunter,\" tells us that \"he once gave in copy written on the edges of a tall octavo 'Somnium Scipionis,' and as he did not obliterate the original matter, the printer was rather puzzled, and made a funny jumble between the letter-press Latin and the manuscript English.\" I seriously fear that with him must be ranked the gentle Elia, who said: \"A book reads the better which is our own, and has been so long known to us that we know the topography of its blots and dog's ears, and can trace the dirt in it to having read it at tea with buttered muffins, or over a pipe, which I think is the maximum.\" And yet a great degree of slovenliness may be excused in Charles because, according to Leigh Hunt, he once gave a kiss to an old folio Chapman's \"Homer,\" and when asked how he knew his books one from the other, for hardly any were lettered, he answered: \"How does a shepherd know his sheep?\"  The love of books displayed by the sensual Henry and the pugnacious Junot is not more remarkable than that of the epicurean and sumptuous Lucullus, to whom Pompey, when sick, having been directed by his physician to eat a thrush for dinner, and learning from his servants that in summer-time thrushes were not to be found anywhere but in Lucullus' fattening coops, refused to be indebted for his meal, observing: \"So if Lucullus had not been an epicure, Pompey had not lived.\" Of him the veracious Plutarch says: \"His furnishing a library, however, deserved praise and record, for he collected very many and choice manuscripts; and the use they were put to was even more magnificent than the purchase, the library being always open, and the walks and reading rooms about it free to all Greeks, whose delight it was to leave their other occupations and hasten thither as to the habitation of the Muses.\"  It is not recorded that Socrates collected books--his wife probably objected--but we have his word for it that he loved them. He did not love the country, and the only thing that could tempt him thither was a book. Acknowledging this to Phædrus he says:  \"Very true, my good friend; and I hope that you will excuse me when you hear the reason, which is, that I am a lover of knowledge, and the men who dwell in the city are my teachers, and not the trees or the country. Though I do indeed believe that you have found a spell with which to draw me out of the city into the country, like a hungry cow before whom a bough or a bunch of fruit is waved. For only hold up before me in like manner a book, and you may lead me all round Attica, and over the wide world. And now having arrived, I intend to lie down, and do you choose any posture in which you can read best.\"     III.  DIVERSE TASTES.   It is fortunate for the harmony of book-collectors that they do not all desire the same thing, just as it was fortunate for their young State that all the Romans did not want the same Sabine woman. Otherwise the Helenic battle of the books would be fiercer than it is. Thus there are bibliomaniacs who reprint rare books from their own libraries in limited numbers; authors, like Walpole, who print their own works, and whose fame as printers is better deserved than their reputation as writers; like Thackeray, who design the illustrations for their own romances, or, like Astor, who procure a single copy of their novel to be illustrated at lavish expense by artists; amateurs who bind their own books; lunatics who yearn for books wholly engraved, or printed only on one side of the leaf, or Greek books wholly in capitals, or others in the italic letter; or black-letter fanciers; or tall copy men; or rubricists, missal men, or first edition men, or incunabulists.  One seeks only ancient books; another limited editions; another those privately printed; a fourth wants nothing but presentation copies; yet another only those that have belonged to famous men, and still another illustrated or illuminated books. There is a perfectly rabid and incurable class, of whom the most harmless are devoted to pamphlets; another, rather more dangerous, to incorrect or suppressed editions; and a third, stark mad, to play-bills and portraits. One patronizes the drama, one poetry, one the fine arts, another books about books and their collectors; and a very recherche class devote themselves to works on playing-cards, angling, magic, or chess, emblems, dances of death, or the jest books and facetiæ. Finally, there are those unhappy beings who run up and down for duplicates, searching for every edition of their favorite authors. In very recent days there has arisen a large class who demand the first editions of popular novelists like Dickens, Thackeray and Hawthorne, and will pay large prices for these issues which have no value except that of rarity. I can quite understand the enthusiasm of the collector over the beautiful first editions of the Greek and Latin classics, or for the first \"Paradise Lost,\" or even for the ugly first folio \"Shakespeare,\" and why he should prefer the comparatively rude first Walton's Angler to Pickering's edition, the handsomest of this century, with its monumental title page. But why a first edition of a popular novel should be more desirable than a late one, which is usually the more elegant, I confess I cannot understand. It is one of those things which, like the mystery of religion, we must take on trust. So when a bookseller tells me that a copy of the first issue of \"The Scarlet Letter\" has sold for seventy-five dollars, and that a copy of the second, with the same date, but put out six months later, is worth only seventy-five cents, I open my eyes but not my purse, especially when I consider that the second is greatly superior to the first on account of its famous preface of apology, and when I read of some one's bidding $1875 for a copy of Poe's worthless \"Tamerlane,\" I am flattered by the reflection that there is one man in the world whom I believe to be eighteen hundred and seventy-five times as great a fool as I am!     IV.  THE SIZE OF BOOKS.   Were I a despotic ruler of the universe I would make it a serious offense to publish a book larger than royal octavo. Books should be made to read, or at all events to look at, and in this view comfort and ease should be consulted. Any one who has ever undertaken to read a huge quarto or folio will sympathize with this view. The older and lazier the Book-Worm grows the more he longs for little books, which he can hold in one hand without getting a cramp, or at least support with arms in an elbow chair without fatigue. Darwin remorselessly split big books in two. Mr. Slater says in \"Book Collecting:\" \"When the library at Sion College took fire the attendants, at the risk of their lives, rescued a pile of books from the flames, and it is said that the librarian wept when he found that the porters had taken it for granted that the value of a book was in exact proportion to its size.\" Few of us, I suspect, ever read our family Bible, and all of us probably groan when we lift out the unabridged dictionary. The \"Century Dictionary\" is a luxury because it is published in small and convenient parts. I cannot conceive any good in a big book except that the ladies may use it to press flowers or mosses in, or the nurses may put it in a chair to sit the baby on at table. I have heard of a gentleman who inherited a mass of folio volumes and arranged them as shelves for his smaller treasures, and of another who arranged his 12-mos on a stand made up of the seventeen volumes of Pinkerton's \"Voyages\" and Denon's \"Egypt\" for shelves. What reader would not prefer a dainty little Elzevir to the huge folio, Cæsar's \"Commentaries,\" even with the big bull in it, and the wicker idol full of burning human victims? What can be more pleasing than the modern Quantin edition of the classics? Or, to speak of a popular book, take the \"Pastels in Prose,\" the most exquisite book for the price ever known in the history of printing. The small book ought however to be easily legible. The health and comfort of the human eye should be consulted in the size of the type. Nothing can be worse in this regard than the Pickering diamond classics, if meant to be read; and it seems that there are too many of them to be intended as mere curiosities of printing. Let us approve the exit of the folio and the quarto, and applaud the modern tendency toward little and handy volumes. Large paper however is a worthy distinction when the subject is worth the distinction and the edition is not too large. Nothing raises the gorge of the true Book-Worm more than to see an issue on large paper of a row of histories, for example; and the very worst instance conceivable was a large paper Webster's \"Unabridged Dictionary\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36764"],["title","In the Track of the Bookworm (#2)"],["body","some years ago. The book thus distinguished ought to be a classic, or peculiar for elegance, never a series, or stereotyped, the first struck off, and the issue ought not to be more than from fifty to one hundred copies; any larger issue is not worth the extra margin bestowed, and no experienced buyer will tolerate it. But if all these conditions are observed, the large paper copies bear the same relation to the small that a proof before letters of a print holds to the other impressions. Large margins are very pleasant in a library as well as in Wall Street, and much more apt to be permanent. There are some favorite books of which the possessor longs in vain for a large copy, as for instance, the Pickering \"Walton and Cotton.\"  A great deal of fun is made of the Book-Worm because of his desire for large paper and of his insistence on uncut edges, but his reasons are sound and his taste is unimpeachable. The tricks of the book-trade to catch the inexperienced with the bait of large paper are very amusing. \"Strictly limited\" to so many copies for England and so many for America, say a thousand in all, or else the number is not stated, and always described as an edition de luxe, and its looks are always very repulsive. But the bait is eagerly bitten at by a shoal of beings anxious to get one of these rarities--a class to one of whom I once found it necessary to explain that \"uncut edges\" does not mean leaves not cut open, and that he would not injure the value of his book by being able to read it, and was not bound to peep in surreptitiously like a maid-servant at a door \"on the jar.\" I once knew a satirical Book-Worm who issued a pamphlet, \"one hundred copies on large paper, none on small.\" There is no just distinction in an ugly large-paper issue, and sometimes it is not nearly so beautiful as the small, especially when the latter has uncut edges. The independence of the collector who prefers the small in such circumstances is to be commended and imitated.  Too great inequality in uncut edges is also to be shunned as an ugliness. It seems that some French books are printed on paper of two different sizes, the effect of which is very grotesque, and the device is a catering to a very crude and extravagant taste.     V.  BINDING.   The binding of books for several centuries has held the dignity of a fine art, quite independent of printing. This has been demonstrated by exhibitions in this country and abroad. But every collector ought to observe fitness in the binding which he procures to be executed. True fitness prevails in most old and fine bindings; seldom was a costly garb bestowed on a book unworthy of it. But in many a luxurious library we see a modern binding fit for a unique or rare book given to one that is comparatively worthless or common. Not to speak of bindings that are real works of art, many collectors go astray in dressing lumber in purple and fine linen--putting full levant morocco on blockhead histories and such stuff that perishes in the not using. It is a sad spectacle to behold a unique binding wasted on a book of no more value than a backgammon board. There are of course not a great many of us who can afford unique bindings, but those who cannot should at least observe propriety and fitness in this regard, and draw the line severely between full dress and demi-toilette, and keep a sharp eye to appropriateness of color. I have known several men who bound their books all alike. Nothing could be worse except one who should bind particular subjects in special styles, pace Mr. Ellwanger, who, in \"The Story of My House,\" advises the Book-Worm to \"bind the poets in yellow or orange, books on nature in olive, the philosophers in blue, the French classics in red,\" etc. I am curious to know what color this pleasant writer would adopt for the binding of his books by military men, such for example as \"Major Walpole's Anecdotes.\" (p. 262).  Ambrose Fermin Didot recommended binding the \"Iliad\" in red and the \"Odyssey\" in blue, for the Greek rhapsodists wore a scarlet cloak when they recited the former and a blue one when they recited the latter. The churchmen he would clothe in violet, cardinals in scarlet, philosophers in black.  I have imagined    HOW A BIBLIOMANIAC BINDS HIS BOOKS.    I'd like my favorite books to bind     So that their outward dress   To every bibliomaniac's mind     Their contents should express.    Napoleon's life should glare in red,     John Calvin's gloom in blue;   Thus they would typify bloodshed     And sour religion's hue.    The prize-ring record of the past     Must be in blue and black;   While any color that is fast     Would do for Derby track.    The Popes in scarlet well may go;     In jealous green, Othello;   In gray, Old Age of Cicero,     And London Cries in yellow.    My Walton should his gentle art     In Salmon best express,   And Penn and Fox the friendly heart     In quiet drab confess.    Statistics of the lumber trade     Should be embraced in boards,   While muslin for the inspired Maid     A fitting garb affords.    Intestine wars I'd clothe in vellum,     While pig-skin Bacon grasps,   And flat romances, such as \"Pelham,\"     Should stand in calf with clasps.    Blind-tooled should be blank verse and rhyme     Of Homer and of Milton;   But Newgate Calendar of Crime     I'd lavishly dab gilt on.    The edges of a sculptor's life     May fitly marbled be,   But sprinkle not, for fear of strife,     A Baptist history.    Crimea's warlike facts and dates     Of fragrant Russia smell;   The subjugated Barbary States     In crushed Morocco dwell.    But oh! that one I hold so dear     Should be arrayed so cheap   Gives me a qualm; I sadly fear     My Lamb must be half-sheep.  No doubt a Book-Worm so far gone as this could invent stricter analogies and make even the binder fit the book.  So we should have    THE BIBLIOMANIAC'S ASSIGNMENT OF BINDERS.    If I could bring the dead to day,     I would your soul with wonder fill   By pointing out a novel way     For bibliopegistic skill.    My Walton, Trautz should take in hand,     Or else I'd give him o'er to Hering;   Matthews should make the Gospels stand     A solemn warning to the erring.    The history of the Inquisition,     With all its diabolic train   Of cruelty and superstition,     Should fitly be arrayed by Payne.    A book of dreams by Bedford clad,     A Papal history by De Rome,   Should make the sense of fitness glad     In every bibliomaniac's home.    As our first mother's folly cost     Her sex so dear, and makes men grieve,   So Milton's plaint of Eden lost     Would be appropriate to Eve.    Hayday would make \"One Summer\" be     Doubly attractive to the view;   While General Wolfe's biography     Should be the work of Pasdeloup.    For lives of dwarfs, like Thomas Thumb,     Petit's the man by nature made,   And when Munchasen strikes us dumb     It is by means of Gascon aid.    Thus would I the great binders blend     In harmony with work before 'em,   And so Riviere I would commend     To Turner's \"Liber Fluviorum.\"  After all, whether one can afford a three-hundred or a three-dollar binding, the gentle Elia has said the last word about fitness of bindings when he observed: \"To be strong-backed and neat-bound is the desideratum of a volume; magnificence comes after. This, when it can be afforded, is not to be lavished on all kinds of books indiscriminately.  \"Where we know that a book is at once both good and rare--where the individual is almost the species,    'We know not where is that Prometian torch   That can its light relumine;'  \"Such a book for instance as the 'Life of the Duke of Newcastle' by his Duchess--no casket is rich enough, no casing sufficiently durable, to honor and keep safe such a jewel.  \"To view a well arranged assortment of block-headed encyclopoedias (Anglicana or Metropolitanas), set out in an array of Russia and Morocco, when a tithe of that good leather would comfortably reclothe my shivering folios, would renovate Parcelsus himself, and enable old Raymond Lully to look like himself again in the world. I never see these impostors but I long to strip them and warm my ragged veterans in their spoils.\"  There spoke the true Book-Worm. What a pity he could not have sold a part of his good sense and fine taste to some of the affluent collectors of this period!  Doubtless an experienced binder could give some amusing examples of mistakes in indorsing books with their names. One remains in my memory. A French binder, entrusted with a French translation of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" in two volumes, put \"L'Oncle\" on both, and numbered them \"Tome 1,\" \"Tome 2.\" Charles Cowden-Clarke tells of his having ordered Leigh Hunt's poems entitled \"Foliage\" to be bound in green, and how the book came home in blue. That would answer for the \"blue grass\" region of Kentucky. I have no patience with those disgusting realists who bind books in human or snake skin. In his charming book on the Law Reporters, Mr. Wallace says of Desaussures' South Carolina Reports: \"When these volumes are found in their original binding most persons, I think, are struck with its peculiarity. The cause of it is, I believe, that it was done by negroes.\" What the \"peculiarity\" is he does not disclose. But book-binding seems to be an unwonted occupation for negro slaves. It was not often that they beat skins, although their own skins were frequently beaten.     VI.  PAPER.   It is a serious question whether the art of printing has been improved except in facility. Is not the first printed book still the finest ever printed? But in one point I am certain that the moderns have fallen away, at least in the production of cheap books, and that is in the quality and finish of the paper. Not to speak of injurious devices to make the book heavy, the custom of calendering the paper, or making it smooth and shiny, practised by some important publishers, is bad for the eyes, and the result is not pleasant to look at. It is "]]]
