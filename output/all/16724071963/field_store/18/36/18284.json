THEN CRASH!  KENNETH SUCCEEDED IN THROWING THE SPY TO THE FLOOR     THE DISPATCH-RIDERS    CHAPTER I  The Coming Storm  \"Let's make for Liége,\" exclaimed Kenneth Everest.  \"What's that?\" asked his chum, Rollo Harrington.  \"Liége?  What on earth possesses you to suggest Liége?  A crowded manufacturing town, with narrow streets and horrible _pavé_.  I thought we decided to fight shy of heavy traffic?\"  The two speakers were seated at an open window of the Hôtel Doré, in the picturesque town of Dinant.  In front of them flowed the Meuse; its placid water rippled with craft of varying sizes.  Huge barges, towed by snorting tugs, were laboriously passing along the busy international waterway that serves an empire, a kingdom, and a republic.  On the remote bank, and to the right of a bridge, were the quaint red-tiled houses of the town, above which rose the fantastic, pinnacled tower of the thirteenth-century church of Notre Dame, in turn overshadowed by the frowning limestone crag on which stands the citadel.  Kenneth was a well-set-up English youth of seventeen.  He was tall for his age, and withal broad-shouldered and well-knit.  His features were dark, his skin burnt a deep tan by reason of more than a nodding acquaintance with an open-air life.  In character and action he was impulsive.  He had the happy knack of making up his mind on the spur of the moment, and yet at the same time forming a fairly sound judgment. He was quick, too, with his fingers, having been gifted with a keen, mechanical turn of mind.  Rollo Barrington, who was his companion's junior by the space of three days, was rather the reverse of his versatile friend.  He was shorter in height by a good four inches; he was slightly built, although he possessed an unlooked-for reserve of physical strength and endurance. He was fresh-complexioned, with blue eyes and wavy chestnut hair.  If Kenneth acted upon impulse, Rollo went by rule of thumb.  He was cool and calculating when occasion served; but when in the company of his chum he was generally content to allow his will to be dominated by the impetuous Everest.  Both lads were at St. Cyprian's--a public school of note in the Home Counties.  The vacation started about the middle of July, and it was the custom for the senior members to put in a fortnight's camp with the Officers' Training Corps during the latter part of that month.  At the time this story opens--the first day of August, 1914--the two chums were on a motor-cycling tour through Northern France and Belgium. The parents of neither had offered any objection when their respective sons announced their intention of wandering through the high-roads and by-roads of that part of the Continent.  Kenneth had sprung the suggestion upon his father like the proverbial bombshell; and Mr. Everest, who was largely responsible for his son's impetuosity, merely acquiesced by observing: \"You lucky young dog!  I didn't have the chance when I was your age.  Well, I hope you'll have a good time.\"  On his part Rollo had broached the subject with his customary deliberation, and Colonel Barrington had not only given his consent, but had gone to the extreme toil of producing maps and a Baedeker, and had mapped out a route--to which neither of the lads had adhered.  The Colonel also realized that there was a considerable amount of self-education to be derived from the tour.  There was nothing like travel, he declared, to expand the mind; following up this statement by the practical action of \"forking out\", thereby relieving his son of any fear of pecuniary embarrassment.  Both lads rode identically similar motor-cycles--tourist models, of 3-½ horse-power, fitted with three-speed hubs.  But again the difference in character manifested itself in the care of their respective steeds.  Rollo had been a motor-cyclist ever since he was fourteen--as soon as he was qualified in point of age to obtain a driver's licence.  The close attention he bestowed upon his motor-bike never varied; he kept it as clean as he did in the first few days after taking over his new purchase.  He had thoroughly mastered its peculiarities, and studied both the theory and practice of its mechanism.  Kenneth Everest had first bestrode the saddle of a motor-cycle a week before their Continental tour began.  No doubt his experience as a \"push-cyclist\" helped him considerably; he quickly mastered the use of the various controls, without troubling to find out \"how it worked\". With his companion's knowledge at his back he felt quite at ease, since, in the event of any mechanical break-down, Rollo would point out the fault, and Kenneth's ready fingers would either do or undo the rest.  But so far, with the exception of a few tyre troubles, both motor-cyclists had done remarkably well.  Landing at Havre, they had pushed on, following the route taken by the English army that had won Agincourt.  This, by the by, was Rollo's suggestion.  From the site of the historic battle-field they had sped eastward, through Arras, St. Quentin, and Mézières.  Here, finding themselves in the valley of the Meuse, they had turned northward, and passing through the French frontier fortress of Givet, entered Belgium, spending the first night on Belgian soil in picturesque Dinant.  Hitherto they had overcome the initial difficulty that confronts British road users in France--the fact that all traffic keeps, or is supposed to keep, to the right.  They had endured the horrible and seemingly never-ending cobbles or _pavé_.  The language presented little difficulty, for Kenneth, prior to having joined St. Cyprian's, had been educated in Paris; and although his Parisian accent differed somewhat from the patois of the Ardennes, he had very little trouble in making himself understood.  Rollo, too, was a fairly proficient French linguist, since, in view of his future military career, he had applied himself with his usual diligence to the study of the language.  \"I say, what's this wheeze about Liége?\" persisted Harrington. \"There's something in the wind, old chap.\"  \"It's not exactly Liége I want to see,\" replied Kenneth, \"although it's a fine, interesting old place, with a history.  Fact is, my sister Thelma is at a boarding-school at Visé--that's only a few miles farther on--and we might just as well look her up.\"  \"By Jove!  I ought to have remembered.  I knew she was somewhere in Belgium.  Let me see, she's your youngest sister?\"  \"Twelve months my junior,\" replied Kenneth, \"and a jolly good pal she is, too.  It's rather rough luck on her.  The pater's just off on that Mediterranean trip, so she hasn't been able to go home for the holidays.  We'll just cheer her up a bit.\"  Rollo gave a final glance at the map before folding it and placing it in his pocket.  In response to a summons, the garçon produced the bill and gratefully accepted the modest tip that Everest bestowed upon him with becoming public schoolboy dignity.  This done, the two lads took their travelling cases and made their way to the hotel garage, where their motor-cycles had been placed under lock and key, out of the reach of sundry inquisitive and mischievous Belgian gamins.  \"Hello!  What's the excitement?\" asked Kenneth, pointing to a crowd of gesticulating townsfolk "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36500"],["title","The Dispatch-Riders: The Adventures of Two British Motor-cyclists in the Great (#1)"],["body","round a notice that had just been pasted to a wall.  \"Ask me another,\" rejoined his companion.  \"A circus or something of the sort about to turn up, I suppose.  If you're curious I'll hang on here while you go and find out.\"  Kenneth was off like a shot.  Half-way across the bridge that here spans the Meuse he nearly collided with the proprietor of the Hôtel Doré.  The man's face was red with excitement.  \"Quel dommage!\" he exclaimed, in reply to the lad's unspoken question. \"The Government has ordered the army to mobilize.  What inconsideration!  Jules, Michel, Georges, and Étienne--all will have to go.  I shall be left without a single garçon.  And the busy season approaches also.\"  \"Why is the army to be mobilized, then?\"  \"Ciel!  I know not.  We Belgians do not require soldiers.  We are men of peace.  Has not our neutrality been guaranteed by our neighbours? And, notwithstanding, the Government must have men to vie with the French _piou-piou_, give them rifles, and put them in uniforms at the expense of the community.  It is inconceivable!\"  The proprietor, unable to contain his feelings, rushed back to the hotel, while Kenneth, still wishing to satisfy his curiosity by ocular demonstration, made his way to the edge of the semicircular crowd of excited townsfolk.  The proclamation, dated the 31st day of July, was an order for partial mobilization, calling up the First Division of the Reserves.  No reason was given, and the lack of it, rather than the fact that the order had to be obeyed, was the subject of general comment.  From the nature of the conversation the lad gathered that military service was not regarded by the Belgians in anything approaching a tolerant spirit.  \"Nothing much; only a mobilization,\" announced Everest in reply to his companion's enquiry.  \"Let's make a move.  We may see something of the Belgian troops.  It would be rather interesting to see how they take to playing at soldiering.\"  \"Why playing?\" asked Rollo as he proceeded to secure his valise to the carrier.  \"What else would you expect from Belgians?\" rejoined Kenneth.  \"Even old Gallipot--or whatever the hotel proprietor's name is--was grumbling about the uselessness of the business, and most of those johnnies over there are of the same opinion.  No, Rollo, take my word for it, the Belgians are not a fighting race.  Let me see--didn't they skedaddle at Waterloo and almost let our fellows down?\"  \"They may have done,\" remarked Rollo.  \"But that's nearly a century old.  Ready?\"  With half-closed throttles, and tyres sufficiently soft to absorb most of the shocks, the young tourists bumped over the _pavé_, swung round, and soon settled down to a modest fifteen miles an hour along the Namur road.  For the best part of the journey the Meuse, with its limestone crags and dense foliage, was within a few yards on their right, while trees on either side of the road afforded a pleasant shade from the fierce rays of the sun.  The dust, too, rose in dense clouds whenever, as frequently happened, a motor-car tore past, or a flock of frightened sheep scampered madly all across the road.  At Namur their wishes regarding the Belgian troops were gratified.  The narrow street swarmed with soldiers and civil guards.  There were men with head-dresses resembling the busbies of the British guardsmen, leading teams of dogs harnessed to light quick-firing \"Berthier\" guns; infantry who, in spite of the broiling heat, wore heavy greatcoats; cavalry whose mounts were powerful enough to evoke the admiration of the critical Kenneth.  \"I wonder what all this fuss is about,\" he exclaimed.  Before Rollo could furnish any remark a little Belgian officer accosted them.  \"You gentlemen are English, without doubt?\"  \"We are.\"  \"It then is well,\" continued the officer, speaking in English with considerable fluency.  \"You have not heard, eh?  The news--the grave news?\"  \"No, monsieur.\"  \"Germany has declared war upon the Russians.\"     CHAPTER II  A Break-down  \"Is that so?\" asked Kenneth.  \"Then I hope to goodness the Russians will give the Germans a thundering good licking.  But why are your troops mobilizing?\"  The Belgian officer replied by producing a newspaper and pointing to a heavy-leaded column.  \"You understand our language?\" he asked.  The report, though a piece of journalistic conjecture, afterwards proved to be very near to the mark.  It was to the effect that Germany had declared war against Russia and also France, and that her troops were already pouring over the respective frontiers.  To take all necessary precautions the King of the Belgians had ordered a mobilization, and had appealed to King George to assist him in preserving the integrity of his small kingdom.  \"You'll notice it says that it is reported,\" observed the cautious Rollo.  \"By Jove, if it is true, the Kaiser will have a handful.  But, monsieur, surely Belgium will be out of it?  Her integrity is protected by treaties.\"  The Belgian officer shrugged his shoulders.  \"Let us hope so,\" he remarked.  \"We Belgians have little faith in the honour of a German.  Therefore, we arm.  Where do you propose to go?\"  \"To Liége, monsieur.\"  \"Then do not go.  It is not advisable.  If you take my advice you return to England as soon as possible.  Perhaps, soon, you come back again with a brave English army.\"  \"Whatever is the fellow aiming at?\" asked Kenneth, after the officer was out of ear-shot.  \"It's all so very mysterious about nothing.\"  \"Do you call war between Germany and France and Russia nothing, old fellow?\"  \"I wasn't referring to that,\" replied Kenneth.  \"Of course it is.  The Russians will simply walk over Prussia while the Germans are trying to batter the French frontier forts.  No; what I meant is, why should we be balked in going to Liége?  We'll go, and risk it--though I don't believe there is any risk.  If there is, so much the better for us.\"  \"Perhaps that Belgian officer knows more than he told us.\"  \"Or else less.  I'll tell you what, Rollo.  We'll see what's doing at Liége; then, if there's time, we'll run back almost to the French frontier and see what the excitement is like there.  Let's make another start.\"  The suggestion was quickly put into practice, but progress was tedious and slow.  The highway between Namur and Liége was crowded with traffic.  Military wagons, both motor-driven and drawn by horses and mules, seemed an unending stream.  The rattling of the huge motor-lorries prevented the chauffeurs from hearing any sounds beyond the pulsations of their engines.  In vain the two English lads sounded their horns.  It was invariably a case of throwing out the clutch and waiting for a favourable moment to dash past, often with a bare yard between the off-side wheel of the powerful lorries and the deep ditch by the side of the road.  There were thousands of troops, too, with their supply-carts; swarms of peasants driving cattle into the fortresses; motor-cars, motor-cycles, and ordinary cycles galore, till Rollo remarked, during one of the enforced halts, that it was ten times worse than Barnet Hill on fair night.  At length, after taking two hours to traverse fifteen miles, the lads came in sight of the town of Huy.  Here the traffic lessened slightly, and Kenneth called for an increased speed.  Suddenly Rollo saw his companion's cycle slip from under him.  It was all he could do to avoid coming into collision with the prostrate mount.  When he pulled up and dismounted, Kenneth was regaining his feet.  \"Hurt?\" asked Barrington laconically, yet with considerable anxiety.  \"Not a bit,\" replied Kenneth cheerfully.  \"Only barked my knuckles. Get up, you brute!\"  The last remark was addressed to the motor-cycle, which was lying on its side across a rounded stone embedded in the ground on the edge of the footpath.  Kenneth found, for the first time, that it required a fair amount of physical energy to restore a fallen motorcycle to its normal position.  Thrice he tried a running start, but without success.  The motor refused to fire.  \"Jack it up on its stand,\" suggested Rollo.  \"Inject a little petrol into the compression tap and have another shot.\"  Kenneth promptly acted upon this advice, but still without satisfactory result.  By this time Rollo had placed his cycle on its stand and was ready to give assistance.  \"There's no spark,\" he announced after testing the plug.  \"I hope it isn't the magneto.\"  With the usual perversity of things in general and motor-cycles in particular, it was the magneto that was out of action.  The round stone on which the cycle had fallen had given the delicate mechanism a nasty blow.  \"This job's beyond me,\" declared Rollo.  \"We must see what can be done in the next town.  Thank goodness it isn't far.  Off with the belt and push her; I won't risk towing you with this traffic about.\"  Already the disabled motor-cycle was surrounded by a crowd of peasants and soldiers, all of whom offered advice; but, as the majority of the onlookers were Walloons, their Flemish tongue was not understood by the two English lads.  At length Kenneth managed to get into conversation with a French-speaking corporal, and from him learnt that there was an efficient motor-repairer in Huy, whose place of business faced the market square.  It was exhausting work pushing the two motor-bicycles along the undulating, rough cobbled road in the fierce glare of the August sun. The crowd followed.  About a quarter of a mile farther along the road a chasseur passed. Reining in his horse he addressed the corporal.  \"What, then, has happened, Pierre?\"  The Belgian non-com. shrugged his shoulders.  \"Only two German tourists, Gaston,\" he replied.  \"They have had an accident.\"  \"German!\" exclaimed Kenneth indignantly.  \"You are wrong.  We are English.\"  \"Can Monsieur produce proof?\" asked the corporal.  Fortunately both lads possessed _permits de circulation_--documents issued to foreign tourists on entering French territory, and which they had not given up at the _douane_ "]]]
