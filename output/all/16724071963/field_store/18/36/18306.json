I'm told to-morrow she's to be immured in a convent; what if I ask Dame Isabel, if--but she, and indeed Don Scipio, carry themselves very strangely towards me--I can't imagine what's become of my rascal Pedrillo.  _Enter PEDRILLO, in an elegant Morning Gown, Cap and Slippers._  _Ped._ Strange, the respect I meet in this family. I hope we don't take horse after my master's wedding. I should like to marry here myself,--before I unrobe I'll attack one of the maids!--Faith, a very modish dress to go courting in,--hide my livery, and I am quite gallant.  _Don Fer._ Oh here's a gentleman I ha'n't seen before!  _Ped._ Tol de rol!  _Don Fer._ Pray, sir, may I--Pedrillo, [_Surprised._] where have you--hey! what, ha! ha! ha! what's the matter with you?  _Ped._ Matter!--Why, sir, I don't know how it was, but somehow or other last night, I happened to sit down to a supper of only twelve covers, cracked two bottles of choice wine, slept in an embroider'd bed, where I sunk in down, and lay till this morning like a diamond in cotton.--So, indeed, sir, I don't know what's the matter with me.  _Don Fer._ I can't imagine how, or what it all means.  _Ped._ Why, sir, Don Scipio, being a gentleman of discernment, perceives my worth, and values it.  _Don Fer._ Then, sir, if you are a gentleman of such prodigious merit, be so obliging, with submission to your cap and gown, as to--pull off my boots.  _Enter VASQUEZ._  _Vas._ Sir, the ladies wait breakfast for you.                                      [_To PEDRILLO, with great respect._  _Don Fer._ My respects, I attend them.  _Vas._ You! I mean his honour here.  _Ped._ Oh, you mean my honour here.  _Don Fer._ Well, but perhaps, my good friend, I may like a dish of chocolate as well as his honour here.  _Vas._ Chocolate, ha! ha! ha!                                                         [_With a sneer._  _Fed._ Chocolate, ha! ha! ha!  _Don Fer._ I'll teach you to laugh, sirrah!                                                       [_Beats PEDRILLO._  _Ped._ Teach me to laugh! you may be a good master, but you've a very bad method--But, hey for chocolate and the ladies.                                          [_Exeunt PEDRILLO and VASQUEZ._  _Don Fer._ Don Scipio shall render me an account for this treatment; bear his contempt, and become the butt for the jests of his insolent servants! As I don't like his daughter, I have now a fair excuse, and indeed a just cause, to break my contract, and quit his castle; but then, I leave behind the mistress of my soul--Suppose I make her a tender of my heart--but that might offend, as she must know my hand is engaged to another--When I looked, she turned her lovely eyes averted--Doom'd to a nunnery!   AIR XI.--FERNANDO.    _My fair one, like the blushing rose,_   _Can sweets to every sense disclose:_   _Those sweets I'd gather, but her scorn_   _Then wounds me like the sharpest thorn._    _With sighs each grace and charm I see_   _Thus doom'd to wither on the tree,_   _Till age shall chide the thoughtless maid,_   _When all those blooming beauties fade._   Hey, who comes here? this is the smart little girl who seems so much attached to the beautiful novice--No harm to speak with her--  _Enter CATILINA._  So my pretty primrose!  _Catil._ How do you do, Mr--[_Pert and familiar._] I don't know your name.  _Don Fer._ Not know my name! You must know who I am though, and my business here, child?  _Catil._ Lord, man, what signifies your going about to sift me, when the whole family knows you're Don Fernando's footman.  _Don Fer._ Am I faith? Ha! ha! ha! I'll humour this--Well then, my dear, you know that I am only Don Fernando's footman?  _Catil._ Yes, yes, we know that, notwithstanding your fine clothes.  _Don Fer._ But where's my master?  _Catil._ Don Fernando! he's parading the gallery yonder, in his sham livery and morning gown.  _Don Fer._ Oh, this accounts for twelve covers at supper and the embroider'd bed; but who could have set such a jest going? I'll carry it on though--[_Aside._] So then after all I am known here?  _Catil._ Ay, and if all the impostors in the castle were as well known, we shou'd have no wedding to-morrow night.  _Don Fer._ Something else will out--I'll seem to be in the secret, and perhaps may come at it--[_Aside._] Ay, ay, that piece of deceit is much worse than ours.  _Catil._ That! what, then you know that this Italian lady is not Don Scipio's daughter, but Dame Isabel's, and her true name Lorenza?  _Don Fer._ Here's a discovery! [_Aside._] O yes, I know that.  _Catil._ You do! Perhaps you know too, that the young lady you saw me speak with just now is the real Donna Victoria?  _Don Fer._ Is it possible! Here's a piece of villany! [_Aside._] Charming! let me kiss you, my dear girl.                                                           [_Kisses her._  _Catil._ Lord! he's a delightful man!  _Don Fer._ My little angel, a thousand thanks for this precious discovery.  _Catil._ Discovery!--Well, if you did not know it before, marry hang your assurance, I say--but I must about my business, can't play the lady as you played the gentleman, I've something else to do; so I desire you won't keep kissing me here all day.                                                                 [_Exit._  _Don Fer._ Why what a villain is this Don Scipio! ungrateful to--but I scorn to think of the services I rendered him last night in the forest; a false friend to my father, an unnatural parent to his amiable daughter! here my charmer comes.                                                              [_Retires._  _Enter VICTORIA._  _Vict._ Yes, Catilina must be mistaken, it is impossible he can be the servant,--no, no; that dignity of deportment, and native elegance of manner, can never be assumed; yonder he walks, and my fluttering heart tells me this is really the amiable Fernando, that I must resign to Dame Isabel's daughter.  _Don Fer._ Stay, lovely Victoria!  _Vict._ Did you call me, sir?--Heavens, what have I said! [_Confused._] I mean, signor, would you wish to speak with Donna Victoria? I'll inform her, sir.                                                                [_Going._  _Don Fer._ Oh, I could speak to her for ever, for ever gaze upon her charms, thus transfixed with wonder and delight.  _Vict._ Pray, signor, suffer me to withdraw.  _Don Fer._ For worlds I would not offend! but think not, lady, 'tis the knowledge of your quality that attracts my admiration.  _Vict._ Nay, signor.  _Don Fer._ I know you to be Don Scipio's daughter, the innocent victim of injustice and oppression; therefore I acknowledge to you, and you alone, that, whatever you may have heard to the contrary, I really am Fernando de Zelva.  _Vict._ Signor, how you became acquainted with the secret of my birth I know not; but, from an acquaintance so recent, your compliment I receive as a mode of polite gallantry without a purpose.  _Don Fer._ What your modesty regards as cold compliments, are sentiments warm with the dearest purpose; I came hither to ratify a contract with Don Scipio's daughter; you are she, the beautiful Victoria, destined for the happy Fernando.  _Vict._ Pray rise, signor:--My father perhaps, even to himself, cannot justify his conduct to me: But to censure that, or to pervert his intentions, would, in me, be a breach of filial duty.   AIR XII.--VICTORIA.    _By woes thus surrounded, how vain the gay smile_   _Of the little blind archer, those woes to beguile!_   _Though skilful, he misses, his aim it is cross'd,_   _His quiver exhausted, his arrows are lost._   _Your love, though sincere, on the object you lose,_   [Aside] _How sweet is the passion! Ah, must I refuse?_   _If filial affection that passion should sway,_   _Then love's gentle dictates I cannot obey._   _Don Fer._ And do you, can you, wish me to espouse Donna Lorenza, Isabella's daughter?--Say, you do not, do but satisfy me so far.  _Vict._ Signor, do not despise me if I own, that, before I saw in you the husband of Don Scipio's daughter, I did not once regret that I had lost that title.  _Don Fer._ A thousand thanks for this generous, this amiable condescension.--Oh, my Victoria! if fortune but favours my design, you shall yet triumph over the malice of your enemies.  _Vict._ Yonder is Dame Isabel, if she sees you speaking to me, she'll be early to frustrate whatever you may purpose for my advantage. Signor, farewell!  _Don Fer._ My life, my love, adieu!   AIR XIII.  DUET.--VICTORIA _and_ FERNANDO.    Don Fer.  _So faithful to my fair I'll prove,_   Vict.     _So kind and constant to my love,_   Don Fer.      _I'd never range,_   Vict.         _I'd never change,_   Both.     _Nor time, nor chance, my faith shall move._    Vict.     _No ruby clusters grace the vine,_   Don Fer.  _Ye sparkling stars forget to shine,_   Vict.         _Sweet flowers to spring,_   Don Fer.      _Gay birds to sing,_   Both.     _Those hearts then part that love shall join._                                                               [_Exeunt._  _Enter FERNANDO._  _Don Fer._ This is fortunate; the whole family, except Victoria, are firmly possessed with the idea that I am but the servant.--Well, since they will have me an impostor, they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36651"],["title","The Castle of Andalusia: A Comic Opera, in Three Acts (#6)"],["body"," find me one: In Heaven's name, let them continue in their mistake, and bestow their mock Victoria upon my sham Fernando. I shall have a pleasant and just revenge for their perfidy; and, perhaps, obtain Don Scipio's real, lovely daughter, the sum of my wishes.--Here comes Don Scipio--Now to begin my operations.  _Enter DON SCIPIO._  [_As wishing DON SCIPIO to overhear him._] I'm quite weary of playing the gentleman, I long to get into my livery again.  _Don Scipio._ Get into his livery!                                                                [_Aside._  _Don Fer._ These clothes fall to my share, however; my master will never wear them after me.  _Don Scipio._ His master! ay, ay.                                                                [_Aside._  _Don Fer._ I wish he'd own himself, for I'm certain Don Scipio suspects who I am.  _Don Scipio._ Suspect? I know who you are, [_Advancing to him._] so get into your livery again as fast as you can.  _Don Fer._ Ha, my dear friend, Don Scipio, I was--  _Don Scipio._ Friend! you impudent rascal! I'll break your head, if you make so free with me. None of your swaggering, sirrah--How the fellow acts! it wasn't for nothing he was among the strolling players; but, hark ye, my lad, be quiet, for you're blown here, without the help of your trumpet.  _Don Fer._ Lord, your honour, how came you to know that I am Pedrillo?  _Don Scipio._ Why, I was told of it by your fellow--hold, I must not betray my little dreamer though--[Aside.]--No matter who told me; I--but here comes your master.  _Don Fer._ Pedrillo! The fellow will spoil all; I wish I had given him his lesson before I began with Don Scipio.                                                                [_Aside._  _Don Scipio._ I hope he'll now have done with his gambols.  _Don Fer._ Sir, my master is such an obstinate gentleman, as sure as you stand here, he'll still deny himself to be Don Fernando.  _Don Scipio._ Will he? then I'll write his father an account of his vagaries.  _Enter PEDRILLO._  _Ped._ Master, shall I shave you this morning?  _Don Scipio._ Shave! Oh, my dear sir, time to give over your tricks and fancies.  _Ped._ [_Surprised._] My tricks and fancies!  _Don Fer._ Yes, sir, you are found out.  _Ped._ I am found out!  _Don Scipio._ So you may as well confess.  _Ped._ What the devil shall I confess?  _Don Scipio._ He still persists! Hark ye, young gentleman, I'll send your father an account of your pranks, and he'll trim your jacket for you.  _Ped._ Nay, sir, for the matter of that, my father could trim your jacket for you.  _Don Scipio._ Trim my jacket, young gentleman!  _Ped._ Why, he's the best tailor in Cordova.  _Don Scipio._ His father's a tailor in Cordova!  _Don Fer._ Ay, he'll ruin all--[_Aside._]--Let me speak to him. Tell Don Scipio you are the master.                                                    [_Apart to PEDRILLO._  _Ped._ I will, sir--Don Scipio, you are the master.  _Don Scipio._ What!  _Don Fer._ Stupid dog!--[_Apart to PEDRILLO._]--Say you are Fernando, and I am Pedrillo.  _Ped._ I will--Sir, you are Fernando, and I am Pedrillo.  _Don Fer._ Dull rogue! [_Aside._] I told you, sir, he'd persist in it.                                                  [_Apart to DON SCIPIO._  _Don Scipio._ Yes, I see it; but I tell you what, Don Fernando.--[_LORENZA sings without._] My daughter! Zounds! don't let your mistress see you any more in this cursed livery.--Look at the gentleman, hold up your head--egad, Pedrillo's acting was better than your natural manner.  _Don Fer._ Ah, sir, if you were to see my master dressed--the livery makes such an alteration!  _Don Scipio._ True! curse the livery.  _Ped._ It's bad enough; but my master gives new liveries on his marriage.  _Don Fer._ An insensible scoundrel!                                                                [_Aside._  _Enter LORENZA._  _Lor._ Oh, caro, signor, every body says that you are [_To DON FERNANDO._] not Don Fernando.  _Don Scipio._ Every body's right, for here he stands like a young tailor of Cordova.                                                          [_To PEDRILLO._  _Lor._ Oh, what? then this is Pedrillo?                                                          [_To FERNANDO._  _Don Fer._ At your service, ma'am.                                                               [_Bowing._  _Ped._ That Pedrillo! then, who the devil am I?  _Don Fer._ Here, rogue, this purse is yours--say you are Don Fernando.                                                    [_Apart to PEDRILLO._  _Ped._ Oh, sir--now I understand you.--True, Don Scipio, I am all that he says.  _Don Scipio._ Hey! Now that's right and sensible, and like yourself; but I'll go bustle about our business, for we'll have all our love affairs settled this evening.                                       [_Exeunt DON SCIPIO and FERNANDO._  _Lor._ So, then, you're to be my husband, ha! ha! ha!  _Ped._ Eh!  _Lor._ Well, if not, I can be as cold as you are indifferent.

ACT THE THIRD.   SCENE I.      _A Grand Saloon._  _Enter DON SCIPIO and VASQUEZ._  _Don Scipio._ D'ye hear, Vasquez? run to Father Benedick, tell him to wipe his chin, go up to the chapel, put on his spectacles, open his breviary,--find out matrimony, and wait till we come to him.--[_Exit VASQUEZ._] Then, hey, for a brace of weddings!   AIR XV.--DON SCIPIO.    _Then hey for a lass and a bottle to cheer,_   _And a thumping bantling every year!_   _With skin as white as snow,_   _And hair as brown as a berry!_   _With eyes as black as a sloe,_   _And lips as red as a cherry;_   _Sing rory tory,_   _Dancing, prancing,_   _Laugh and lie down is the play,_   _We'll fondle together,_   _In spite of the weather,_   _And kiss the cold winter away._   _Laugh while you live,_   _For as life is a jest,_   _Who laughs the most,_   _Is sure to live best._   _When I was not so old,_   _I frolick'd among the misses;_   _And when they thought me too bold,_   _I stopped their mouths with kisses._   _Sing rory, tory, &c._   I wonder, is Don Fernando drest--Oh, here comes the servant, in his proper habiliments!  _Enter DON FERNANDO, in a Livery._  Ay, now, my lad, you look something like.  _Don Fer._ Yes, your honour, I was quite sick of my grandeur--My passing so well in this disguise gives me a very humble opinion of myself.                                                                [_Aside._  _Don Scipio._ But, Pedrillo, is your master equipped? 'faith, I long to see him in his proper garb.  _Don Fer._ Why, no, sir, we're a little behind hand with our finery, on account of a portmanteau of clothes that's mislaid somewhere or other.  _Don Scipio._ Portmanteau! Oh, it's safe enough--Your fellow servant has it.  _Don Fer._ Fellow servant?  _Don Scipio._ Ay, the little spy has taken it in charge--Oh, here comes the very beagle.  _Enter SPADO._  Well, my little dreamer, look; Pedrillo has got into his own clothes again.  _Spado._ [_Surprised and aside._] Don Fernando in a livery! or is this really a servant? Zounds! sure I ha'n't been telling truth all this while!--We must face it though--Ah, my dear old friend!--Glad to see you yourself again.                                                         [_Shakes Hands._  _Don Fer._ My dear boy, I thank you--[_Aside._]--So, here's an old friend I never saw before.  _Don Scipio._ Tell Pedrillo where you have left your master's portmanteau. While I go lead him in triumph to his bride.                                                                [_Exit._  _Don Fer._ Pray, my good, new, old friend, where has your care deposited this portmanteau?  _Spado._ Gone!                                             [_Looking after DON SCIPIO._  _Don Fer._ The portmanteau gone!  _Spado._ Ay, his senses are quite gone.  _Don Fer._ Where's the portmanteau that Don Scipio says you took charge of?  _Spado._ Portmanteau! Ah, the dear gentleman! Portmanteau did he say? yes, yes, all's over with his poor brain; yesterday his head run upon purses, and trumpeters, and the lord knows what; and to-day he talks of dreamers, spies, and portmanteaus.--Yes, yes, his wits are going.  _Don Fer._ It must be so; he talked to me last night and to-day of I know not what, in a strange incoherent style.  _Spado._ Grief--all grief.  _Don Fer._ If so, this whim of my being Pedrillo is, perhaps, the creation of his own brain,--but then, how could it have run through the whole family?--This is the first time I ever heard Don Scipio was disordered in his mind.  _Spado._ Ay, we'd all wish to conceal it from your master, lest it might induce him to break off the match, for I don't suppose he'd be very ready to marry into a mad family.  _Don Fer._ And pray, what are you, sir, in this mad family?  _Spado._ Don Scipio's own gentleman, these ten years--Yet, you heard him just now call me your fellow servant.--How you did stare when I accosted you as an old acquaintance!--But we always humour him--I should not have contradicted him, if he had said I was the pope's nuncio.  _Don Fer._ [_Aside._] Oh, then I don't wonder at Dame Isabel taking advantage of his weakness.   _Spado._ Another new whim of his,--he has taken a fancy, that every body has got a ring from him, which, he imagines, belonged to his deceased lady.  _Don Fer._ True, he asked me something about a ring.  _Don Scipio._ [_Without._] I'll wait on you presently.  _Enter DON SCIPIO."]]]
