The commander took up the receiver.  \"Ach!\" he replied. \"That is good.\"  The message was from Unter-leutnant Klick, announcing that the airship was immediately over the large town of Barborough. Von Loringhoven glanced at the altitude indicator. It registered 2,000 metres--too great for practical purposes where no danger was to be anticipated from anti-aircraft guns. The speed of the Zeppelin was now less than ten miles an hour, just sufficient to keep her stationary over her objective.  The commander gave an order. A man on duty in the gondola thrust down a lever, Instantly the gas in several of the ballonets was withdrawn and forced under great pressure into a strong metal tank. This answered to the old-fashioned method of releasing gas from a balloon by means of an escape valve, but with a vast difference. The hydrogen was not wasted; it was merely stored for further service.  Down dropped the airship to less than a thousand feet. Von Eitelwurmer, leaning over the sill of the large scuttle, peered downwards. By means of a pair of powerful night-glasses he could locate his position with great accuracy. He recognised most of the conspicuous land marks of Barborough, in spite of their unfamiliar appearance when viewed from a height. There was the town-hall--a pile of smoke blackened stonework. The railway station with its web of steel lines radiating in four different directions; the huge factories, working day and night at high pressure; the main thoroughfares, rendered even more pronounced by the blue flashes of the electric tram-cars. The Zeppelin had the town at its mercy.  Ober-leutnant von Loringhoven was also examining the scene beneath him. He had no occasion to consult the spy. He knew quite as much as von Eitelwurmer of the topography of the district; thanks to the accurate air-maps supplied by the German government.  \"Now, watch!\" he exclaimed, at the same time holding up four fingers as a sign to the airman at the firing apparatus to release the missiles of destruction.  Von Eitelwurmer held his breath. He clearly heard the four metallic clicks as the man released the bombs at quick intervals. Seven seconds after the first had left the dropping apparatus a lurid flash threw the underside of the enormous envelope into an expanse of reflected light. A roar like the concentration of half a dozen thunder peals tore the air, followed by the rumbling of falling masonry. The other explosions took place in rapid succession, causing the Zeppelin to sway and rock in the violently disturbed atmosphere.  The place where the bombs had burst was hidden in a thick pall of smoke and dust. Tongues of red and yellow flames flickered through the vapour.  \"Two more,\" ordered von Loringhoven.  By this time the Zeppelin, forging ahead, was nearly a quarter of a mile from the scene of her first attempt. The objective was a purely conjectural one, for the missiles burst in a street in one of the poorer quarters of the town.  \"Two more!\"  The two bombs were released, but only one exploded. The other failed to detonate, but the raid was over. In a little over a minute and a half death had been poured upon the unprepared town.  \"I can claim the big munitions factory,\" remarked the ober-leutnant as he telephoned to the navigating gondola for full speed. \"Those first four had it to a nicety. The others--well, they did some damage.\"  The spy smiled.  \"Yes; it all helps,\" he said. \"Frightfulness always scores,\"  \"Realising, as we do, that every English baby is a potential enemy to Germany,\" added von Loringhoven. \"Not necessarily in a military sense, but in the forthcoming commercial war.\"  Von Eitelwurmer glanced at his companion,  \"The forthcoming commercial war,\" he repeated. \"Our Emperor will see to it that there will be no British Empire to threaten our mercantile supremacy.\"  The commander of the Zeppelin shrugged his shoulders.  \"I trust you are right,\" he rejoined, \"but you do not realise the big task in front of us. These Englishmen are only just beginning to bestir themselves. We hoped to have beaten them long ago. Time is no longer on our side, and----\"  Then, realising that his digression was bordering upon dangerous lines, he broke off.  \"And now, von Eitelwurmer, we are homeward bound. In four hours I hope to shake hands with you on German soil.\"  The spy merely grunted. He was thinking regretfully of his lost chance in the share of the twenty thousand marks.     CHAPTER VIII  'MIDST THE SCENE OF RED RUIN   FIVE minutes before the fall of the first bomb, Flight-Sub-lieutenant Barcroft alighted from a tram-car in the market square of Barborough.  The stopping of the railway service had upset his calculations, for instead of the train running into Barborough Station it had come to a stand still at Wolderton, a little town five miles from his destination.  \"Can't go no further yet awhile, sir,\" replied a porter in answer to the flight-sub's enquiry. \"They say as 'ow Zeps is about, though I fancy they won't come to Lancashire, sir. Don't hold wi' these silly scares mysen.\"  \"Where are we?\" asked Barcroft, striving vainly to read the name of the unlighted station. \"Wolderton, sir; if you're for Barborough you can get a car just outside. They are runnin', Zep, or no Zep.\"  The young officer alighted, made his way out of the station and boarded the first northbound car, which in due course deposited him at Barborough--a stranger in a strange land.  \"For Tarleigh, sir?\" rejoined a policeman to his question. \"Matter o' four or six miles. No, sir, you'll not be findin' a taxi to-night, I fancy. Just you go along yon road, take first on your right then straight on till you come to Chumley Old Road. There you'll find a car that'll take you as far as Black Pit Brow, and it'll be forty minutes sharp walking to Tarleigh.\"  Somewhat bewildered Barcroft set out to follow the constable's directions. He found himself slipping on the rough and greasy setts, jostling people in the darkened streets, and barking his shins against obtrusive door steps. The road was a mean and narrow one--a short cut to a main thoroughfare. A dank unwholesome smell permeated the misty air. It struck the young officer as being worse than the atmosphere of the lower deck of a battleship battened down during a three-days' gale.  Suddenly the darkness was rent by a terrific flash. The light was so dazzling that Barcroft was under the impression that it came from the centre of the street. Stunned by the deafening crash he felt himself lurching against a wall, amidst a shower of broken glass.  Another explosion followed and then two more. The flight-sub felt the wall of the house rock with the concussions. He was quite prepared to see the building collapse under the impact of the displaced air. Fragments of slates and tiles, mingled with shattered woodwork, hurtled overhead. Glass tinkled upon the setts. The rumble of falling masonry was added to the uproar, while flames shot up from a mound of debris that a brief instant earlier had been the homes of three English families, and threw a fitful glare upon the scene of destruction.  \"Factory explosion, I suppose,\" thought Barcroft. \"Can't be a Zep., or I should have heard her engines.\"  He put his hand to his cheek. It was warm and moist. Blood was welling from a deep gash. He hardly noticed it. His attention was attracted by the shouts and screams of the terrified inhabitants of the neighbourhood--those whose houses having escaped annihilation but were within the danger zone, had fled pell-mell into the streets.  Other crashes followed, but at a greater distance.  \"Then it is a Zep., by Jove!\" declared the young officer. For the first time he realised his helplessness. He was virtually one of the thousands of civilians unable to raise a hand in self-defence against the cowardly night-raider. A Tommy in a trench with only a rifle--an almost useless weapon against an aircraft of any description--has the satisfaction that he is armed. He is willing to take his chance. But here the townsfolk were utterly at a loss to defend themselves, and it was sorry consolation to be told by the authorities that the inhabitants of raided districts are only sharing the dangers to which the troops in the trenches are exposed.  \"If only I were up aloft with young Kirkwood,\" thought Barcroft. \"We'd make the beggars skip out of that gas-bag. Perhaps some day--\"  A woman, with her shawl wrapped tightly round her head, came hurrying in the opposite direction to which the stream of terrified people forced its way.  \"Eh!\" she exclaimed. \"An' I left t'owld mon's supper on t' stove. I'll be fair angry if 'tis spoilt.\"  It was genuine anxiety. Even in the midst of the scene of destruction her thoughts dwelt upon the little cares of everyday domesticity.  With the sailor's typical eagerness to render aid Barcroft hurried down the street. Already the ebb-tide of fugitives was thinning and giving place to the flood-tide of willing helpers. Here and there men staggered and groaned, bleeding from serious wounds caused by the flying fragments of the deadly missiles. Here and there came others supporting or carrying victims unable to help themselves-- stalwart men, frail women and puny children reduced in the fraction of a second to mangled wrecks.  Pungent, asphyxiating fumes drifted slowly down the narrow thoroughfare, while the glare of the burning buildings threw an eerie light upon the surroundings.  In the street not one panel of glass remained intact. Cast-iron stack-pipes were riddled with holes cut as cleanly as with a drill. Brick walls were perforated like paper; stone-steps--the \"scouring\" of which is a solemn rite with Lancashire folk--were chipped and splintered like glass. Doors were burst open as if with a sledge-hammer."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35374"],["title","The Dreamers: A Club (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: Cronkey Gudehart                         [Page 103   THE FIRST GLOOMSTER]       THE DREAMERS   A Club. _Being a More or Less Faithful   Account of the Literary Exercises   of the First Regular Meeting   of that Organization, Reported by_   JOHN KENDRICK BANGS   _WITH ILLUSTRATIONS_   _By_ EDWARD PENFIELD    [Illustration]    NEW YORK AND LONDON   HARPER & BROTHERS PUBLISHERS   1899       BY THE SAME AUTHOR.

It was Bedford Parke who suggested it to Tenafly Paterson, and Tenafly was so pleased with it that he in turn unfolded it in detail to his friend Dobbs Ferry, claiming its inception as his very own. Dobbs was so extremely enthusiastic about it that he invited Tenafly to a luncheon at the Waldoria to talk over the possibilities of putting the plan into practical operation, and so extract from it whatever of excellence it might ultimately be found to contain.  \"As yet it is only an idea, you know,\" said Dobbs; \"and if you have ever had any experience with ideas, Tenny, you are probably aware that, unless reduced to a practical basis, an idea is of no more value than a theory.\"  \"True,\" Tenafly replied. \"I can demonstrate that in five minutes at the Waldoria. For instance, you see, Dobbsy, I have an idea that I am as hungry as a bear, but as yet it is only a theory, from which I derive no substantial benefit. Place a portion of whitebait, a filet Bearnaise, and a quart of Sauterne before me, and--\"  \"I see,\" said Dobbsy. \"Come along.\"  [Illustration: DISCUSSING THE IDEA]  And they went; and the result of that luncheon at the Waldoria was the formation of \"The Dreamers: A Club.\" The colon was Dobbs Ferry's suggestion. The objects of the club were literary, and Dobbs, who was an observant young man, had noticed that the use of the colon in these days of unregenerate punctuation was confined almost entirely to the literary contingent and its camp-followers. With small poets particularly was it in vogue, and Dobbs--who, by-the-way, had written some very dainty French poems to the various _fiancées_ with whom his career had been checkered--had a sort of vague idea that if his brokerage business would permit him to take the necessary time for it he might become famous as a small poet himself. The French poems and his passion for the colon, combined with an exquisite chirography which he had assiduously cultivated, all contributed to assure him that it was only lack of time that kept him in the ranks of the mute, inglorious Herricks.  As formulated by Dobbs and Tenafly, then, Bedford Parke's suggestion that a Dreamers' Club be formed was amplified into this: Thirteen choice spirits, consisting of Dobbs, Tenafly, Bedford Parke, Greenwich Place, Hudson Rivers of Hastings, Monty St. Vincent, Fulton Streete, Berkeley Hights, Haarlem Bridge, the three Snobbes of Yonkers--Tom, Dick, and Harry--and Billy Jones of the _Weekly Oracle_, were to form themselves into an association which should endeavor to extract whatever latent literary talent the thirteen members might have within them. It was a generally accepted fact, Bedford Parke had said, that all literature, not even excepting history, was based upon the imagination. Many of the masterpieces of fiction had their basis in actual dreams, and, when they were not founded on such, might in every case be said to be directly attributable to what might properly be called waking dreams. It was the misfortune of the thirteen gentlemen who were expected to join this association that the business and social engagements of all, with the possible exception of Billy Jones of the _Weekly Oracle_, were such as to prevent their indulgence in these waking dreams, dreams which should tend to lower the colors of Howells before those of Tenafly Paterson, and cause the memory of Hawthorne to wither away before the scorching rays of that rising sun of genius, Tom Snobbe of Yonkers. Snobbe, by-the-way, must have inherited literary ability from his father, who had once edited a church-fair paper which ran through six editions in one week--one edition a day for each day of the fair--adding an unreceipted printer's bill for eighty-seven dollars to the proceeds to be divided among the heathen of Central Africa.  \"It's a well-known fact,\" said Bedford--\"a sad fact, but still a fact--that if Poe had not been a hard drinker he never would have amounted to a row of beans as a writer. His dreams were induced--and"]]]
