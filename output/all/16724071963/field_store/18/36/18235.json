Shortly before the completion of the molt, the dorsal area of molt divides into two patches, one on the rump and one on the nape. The areas last to be covered with new pelage are the crown and that between the ears and the eyes. A slight variation in the above process occurred in some specimens in which the lateral strips joined immediately cephalad of the tail instead of at the center of the dorsum. The entire process takes approximately three weeks.  Large voles (45 grams or more) grow hair in irregular patches that measured 5 to 15 mm. In these large voles the molt is accomplished slowly and does not cover large areas of the body at any one time. The small areas of molt are visible for 7 to 10 days, and were found on approximately three quarters of the large voles examined.     FOOD AND HABITAT   The diet of the prairie vole reflects both its environment and its choice of food. The plants eaten are usually green and succulent, but some dry, hard seeds and small stems of woody plants are also eaten. The vegetation, which supplies the food for the vole, is important as cover or nesting material. For this reason food and habitat are discussed together.   TYPES OF COVER  Prairie voles inhabit areas where the dominant plants in summer are clover or grasses or both. The lawn on the campus at the University of Kansas consists mostly of several kinds of grasses, but in some places alfalfa (_Medicago sativa_) replaces clover (_Trifolium_ sp.), and in other places sedges (_Scirpus_ spp.) are found in addition to the grasses. The grass is short; it is mowed to a length of 4 to 6 inches. Bluegrass (_Poa pratensis_) and crabgrass (_Digitaria ischaemum_) form most of the sod. Bluejoint (_Andropogon furcatus_) is common in a sparsely wooded part of the campus, an area which has many voles. Foxtail (_Setaria lutescens_ and _S. viridis_) and prairie threeawn (_Aristida oligantha_) are also common on the lawn, but these become dry in late summer, and at that time supply neither food nor cover for the voles. The voles make well-beaten depressions in the sod, and the grass arches over them to form canopies.  In the winter, when the snow flattened the grass on the campus so that there were no longer protective canopies of blades over the runways of the voles, they migrated into areas of Japanese honeysuckle (_Lonicera japonica_). At this season the honeysuckle was their main food. In areas where this vine was not available, the voles abandoned their surface runways and remained below the ground, coming to the surface only under the protection of a blanket of snow. The voles returned to the grass and clover habitat in March and April in 1946.  One pure stand of Ladino clover in Jefferson County, Kansas, was studied in late November and early December of 1945. The clover was 2 to 4 inches high, and although it was the sole food of the voles, it furnishes but little cover. They were common here; 300 traps yielded 111 voles in two nights.   CUTTINGS  The voles seek particularly the tender heads of grasses and the terminal leaves of sweet clover (_Melilotus alba_). To obtain these parts, the voles begin by cutting through the base of the plant. The surrounding plants are often near enough to support the freshly cut piece in an upright position. The vole makes successive cuttings, 40 or 50 millimeters from the ground, until the desired parts of the plant are within reach. The cuttings that have accumulated at the base of the plant may be eaten, but frequently they remain as evidence of the vole's feeding activity.  On May 12, 1946, an analysis was made of the cuttings found in an area of alfalfa, grasses, and weeds. From table 1 it may be seen that quackgrass, alfalfa, wild lettuce, and cleavers were common. In three nights 70 traps caught 8 prairie voles and 3 deer mice; no pine mice or cotton rats were caught on the area. The stomachs of the voles and the deer mice were examined, and only the stomachs of the voles contained green material. Analysis of the cuttings (see table 2) indicates that alfalfa was eaten in greater quantity than any other plant; it made up almost three quarters of the cuttings although but one quarter of the cover. All other plants occurred less commonly in the piles of cuttings than they did in the estimated composition of the cover. Grasses and wild lettuce were next to alfalfa in importance.

The last column gives the percentage of occurrence in the piles of cuttings of each species of plant in the area. Place and date for data in table 2 same as for table 1.]  Approximately one out of every ten voles caught in snap traps had a piece of plant in its mouth. Occasionally a vole took a piece of food into a live trap. Evidently the food is not always eaten where it is procured. Grasses of the genus _Poa_ are the kinds most frequently found in the mouths of dead voles. _Bromus carinatus_, _B. inermis_ and sweet clover (_Melilotus alba_) were found in the runways. The pulpy fruit of the horse nettle (_Solanum carolinense_) was found partly eaten, especially near the entrances to underground passages.   FOOD CACHES  Caches of seeds and underground parts of plants are stored in subterranean chambers. One lot of food was found stored on the surface of the ground. Four times, piles of seeds in runways indicated the species of plants which the voles were storing.  One underground cache was found on May 27, 1946, on the University campus, by John Evans, Richard Edgar, and the writer. This cache was in a large chamber in a tunnel system of the prairie vole, on an east-facing hillside of walnut trees, catalpas, and Kentucky coffee trees. The oval chamber was 250 mm. wide, 400 mm. long, and 200 mm. high. The roof, at its highest point, was 30 mm. below the surface of the ground. There were two entrances to the cavity, both on the downhill side. The cache consisted of eight quarts of seeds (approximately 2,800) of the Kentucky coffee tree (_Gymnocladus dioica_). The seeds were packed with earth and all were well preserved. The site of this cache was in an area which was shaded by a small coffee tree. A seed of this tree is spheroidal, measures 17 mm. in width, and weighs 2 grams.  Several times in the fall of 1945, in the above-mentioned grove, the writer found pods of the coffee tree lying in the runs of the voles. These pods were sometimes entire, but more often they had been gnawed; frequently only part of a pod remained, indicating that the voles were storing or feeding upon the seeds, although the possibility that the mice were storing food did not occur to the writer at the time. Three times, seeds of other plants were found piled at the entrances of the burrows of voles. Twice these piles consisted of from 50 to 70 seeds of the common dandelion (_Taraxacum officinale_). The third pile was composed of 20 seeds of the giant ragweed (_Ambrosia trifida_).  A pasture of Canadian bluegrass (_Poa compressa_), wild millet (_Echinochloa crusgalli_), sedges (_Scirpus_ spp.), and clover (_Trifolium_ sp.) in Atchison County, Kansas, was examined in November, 1945. This area was the home of a dense population of prairie voles. Wherever a path of the voles crossed a deep imprint of a horse's hoof, there was a collection of cuttings from the horizontal stems of the clover which bordered the runways. Some of the cuttings may have been made by lemming mice (_Synaptomys cooperi_) which were also common in the area.  Several kinds of voles store food. Bailey (1920) wrote of the caches of _Microtus pennsylvanicus_ in North Dakota, where, in one locality, this vole was known as the bean mouse. He stated that the Indians dug up beans (_Falcata comosa_) and the tubers of the Jerusalem artichoke (_Helianthus tuberosus_) which the voles had stored. Lantz (1907:17) found a cache of the roots of wild morning glory (_Convolvulus sepium_) laid away by _Microtus pennsylvanicus_. Nelson (1893:140) wrote that, as winter approached, _Microtus operarius_ gathered small bulbous roots, sometimes storing a peck or more in a single cavity. Fisher (1945) in Missouri found a gallon of the fruits of the horse nettle (_Solanum carolinense_) stored in a hollow stump by the prairie vole. Kennicott (1857:99) found five or six quarts of roots of two species of spike-flower (_Liatrus_), _Helianthus_, and various grasses among the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36286"],["title","Natural History of the Prairie Vole (Mammalian Genus Microtus) (#2)"],["body","provisions of the prairie vole in Illinois.   PLANTS USED AS FOOD AND AS COVER  Table 3 lists, according to their families, the species of plants which the prairie vole was observed to use for food. The same species are sometimes used as cover. The majority of the plants are in three families: the grass family (Graminae), the pulse family (Leguminosae), and the composite family (Compositae).  The grasses that supply the voles' food and cover are mostly _Poa_ (the bluegrasses) and _Bromus_ (bromegrass, chess, or cheat). _Poa pratensis_ is a common lawn and pasture grass, _P. annua_ is a weed species. The bluegrasses begin to grow in late winter about Lawrence, Kansas, and they remain green until late in the fall. During this time, the voles eat the blades and heads of bluegrass, and make their runways under the culms. The prairie voles utilize several species of _Bromus_. _Bromus inermis_ and _B. carinatus_ are important range and pasture grasses, but _japonicus_ is a weed of little or no economic value. These are soft, tender grasses, but, in contrast to the bluegrasses, they become dry in midsummer, and are then unsuitable as food. However, they continue to form a protection over the runways of the voles.  The legumes, which appeared to be most important to the prairie vole, are clover (_Trifolium_ spp. and _Melilotus alba_) and alfalfa (_Medicago sativa_). These plants are common in both cultivated and feral states. They form a different type of cover from that made by grasses. Voles, living in clover and alfalfa, do not make runways as distinct as they do in grasslands. The clover and alfalfa plants are branched and of a spreading growth form, whereas the grasses have leaves which are appressed to the main stem. The individual grass plants grow close together, and a vole cannot run through grass without trampling some of it. As voles use the same paths repeatedly, the grass in their runs becomes flattened and dies. There is sufficient room between the stems of the clover and alfalfa plants to allow the voles to pass through without treading on the stems. In such a habitat, vole runways are poorly developed, and are difficult to find. Voles in grasslands feed in runways, as attested by the piles of cuttings found in the runways and the nibbled grass which borders them. Voles in clover or alfalfa feed at the bases of the plants wherever the plants may grow. In the latter type of cover the cuttings are rather evenly distributed.  Compositae formed a minor part of the cover in most of the habitats studied. Many grasslands have a stand of dandelions; sow thistle, wild lettuce, and ragweed were also common in some grasslands. The voles ate the leaves and sometimes the seeds and underground parts of these plants.

Less frequently trapped were the common mole (_Scalopus aquaticus_), the large short-tailed shrew (_Blarina brevicauda_), the Cooper lemming mouse (_Synaptomys cooperi_), the pine mouse (_Pitymys nemoralis_), and the harvest mouse (_Reithrodontomys megalotis_). In the dense growth of Japanese honeysuckle, the prairie vole shared runways with the white-footed mouse (_Peromyscus leucopus_), the large short-tailed shrew, and the pine mouse.     NEST AND BURROWS   The prairie vole makes a tortuous network of paths through the grass and honeycombs the topsoil with its tunnels. The underground passages lead to nests or to chambers where food is sometimes stored. The runways through the grass are 40 to 50 mm. wide, and usually lie slightly below the surface of the ground. By using the same path repeatedly, the voles create little ruts in which they run. The bottom of the runways are bare soil or are covered with only a thin layer of trampled grass. Cotton rats, on the other hand, apparently do not use their runs over long periods, for they are not well-beaten runways, but are made merely by parting the grass and not by trampling it down or cutting it off. Voles were trapped in runways of the cotton rats, but no cotton rat was caught in a typical runway of a vole.  The burrows of the prairie vole are 40 to 50 mm. in diameter, and the shallowest part is usually 50 to 100 mm. below the surface of the ground. Burrows leading to nests or food chambers may descend deeper than the others. Some prairie voles were trapped in tunnels of the common mole (_Scalopus aquaticus_). The voles make their own burrows, and are especially active at this task when a hard rain has loosened the previously hard, dry soil. The rain in the first two weeks of October, 1945, made the soil much more friable than it had been at the beginning of the month, and the voles took advantage of the favorable opportunity to construct many new burrows. In October, particles of soil were packed beneath the toenails of many specimens.  In this time fifteen nests were found. They were 6 to 18 inches below the surface of the ground, and two tunnels led from each nest to the surface runway. The nest cavities were spheroidal, and measured 150 to 200 mm. horizontally, and 80 to 100 mm. vertically. The floors were slightly concave and were covered with loose dirt and a mixture of dried grass and one or two leaves. The remainder of the cavity was filled with the dry grass of which the nest was composed. Criddle (1926) stated that at Treesbank, Manitoba, this vole makes its nests in the burrow systems of the pocket gopher (_Thomomys talpoides_); and Kennicott (1857:98) found nests of the prairie vole in old ant hills.  Each of two nests that had been recently occupied was placed in a Berlese funnel, and in this way the arthropod fauna of the nests was collected. The most common arthropods in the nests were mites (parasitic, predaceous, and free-living) and springtails. Sowbugs, centipedes, spiders, and fleas were also present. Of these arthropods, the laelaptid mites, one kind of tick, and one kind of flea have a direct relationship with the vole. These parasites are the same species which are found on the vole itself. The mites were _Eulaelaps stabularis_ (Koch) and _Atricholaelaps glasgowi_ (Ewing). One adult tick, _Ixodes sculptus_ Newman, was in one nest. The fleas, about a dozen in each nest, were _Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes_ Baker, the flea most frequently found on the prairie vole.     EXTERNAL PARASITES   The pelage of prairie voles, pine mice, deer mice, and shrews forms a habitat for many kinds of parasitic arthropods. The fleas, lice, and mites from the prairie vole were collected, counted, and identified. The ectoparasites from the other small mammals living in the same habitat as the prairie vole were also considered. Some ectoparasites begin to leave the host when it dies, and any counts of ectoparasites made from snap-trapped voles may fall short of the number which was on the animal when it was alive. The average number of fleas recorded from live voles exceeds that found on snap-trapped voles (see table 4). The numbers of lice and mites were estimated, but selected voles were examined to obtain absolute numbers of these kinds of ectoparasites.  The fleas, lice, and mites were mounted on one inch by three inch glass slides; the ticks were preserved in 70 per cent alcohol. Dr. E. W. Baker identified the mites; Dr. R. A. Cooley and Dr. Glen M. Kohls, the ticks; Dr. G. W. Wharton, the chiggers; and Dr. Gordon F. Ferris, the lice. To each of these gentlemen I am grateful. The fleas were identified by myself.   FLEAS (SIPHONAPTERA)  The information on the average numbers of fleas on voles was obtained from live-trapped and some snap-trapped voles. Fleas were counted only on voles which were removed from the traps within twenty-four hours after the traps had been last examined. The average numbers of fleas found on prairie voles in this study are given in table 4.

The numbers in parentheses are the numbers of voles examined.]  Table 5 shows the average degree of infestation for ten months of an eleven month period. The monthly averages for the most part show no variations. The latter half of February provides an exception in that a series of 22 snap-trapped voles and 11 live-trapped voles taken at that time had on the average, 9.7 and 5.3 fleas respectively. Pine mice (_Pitymys nemoralis_) occurred in small numbers in the area where _Microtus ochrogaster_ was live-trapped, and _Ctenophthalmus pseudagyrtes_ was the flea found to be common on both of these voles.
