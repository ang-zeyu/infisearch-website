We have already referred to the study of human knowledge from this standpoint, in connexion with what was said above concerning Logic. It has a close kinship with Logic on the one hand, and with Psychology on the other; and nowadays it forms a distinct branch of speculative Philosophy under the title of _Criteriology_, _Epistemology_, or the _Theory of Knowledge_.  Arising out of the data of our direct experience, external and internal, as studied in the philosophical departments just outlined, we find a variety of evidences all pointing beyond the domain of this direct experience to the supreme conclusion that there exists of necessity, distinct from this directly experienced universe, as its Creator, Conserver, and Ruler, its First Beginning and its Last End, its _Alpha_ and _Omega_, One Divine and Infinite Being, the Deity. The existence and attributes of the Deity, and the relations of man and the universe to the Deity, form the subject-matter of _Natural Theology_.  VII. DEPARTMENTS OF METAPHYSICS: ONTOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY.—According to the Aristotelian and scholastic conception speculative philosophy would utilize as data the conclusions of the special sciences—physical, biological, and human. It would try to reach a deeper explanation of their data by synthesizing these under the wider aspects of change, quantity, and being, thus bringing to light the ultimate causes, reasons, and explanatory principles of things. This whole study would naturally fall into two great branches: General Metaphysics (_Cosmology_ and _Psychology_), which would study things exempt from quantity and change not really but only by mental abstraction; and Special Metaphysics (_Natural Theology_), which would study the positively immaterial and immutable Being of the Deity.  This division of Metaphysics, thoroughly sound in principle, and based on a sane and rational view of the relation between the special sciences and philosophy, has been almost entirely(24) supplanted in modern times by a division which, abstracting from the erroneous attitude that prompted it in the first instance, has much to recommend it from the standpoint of practical convenience of treatment. The modern division was introduced by Wolff (1679-1755), a German philosopher,—a disciple of Leibniz (1646-1716) and forerunner of Kant (1724-1804).(25) Influenced by the excessively deductive method of Leibniz’ philosophy, which he sought to systematize and to popularize, he wrongly conceived the metaphysical study of reality as something wholly apart and separate from the inductive investigation of this same reality in the positive sciences. It comprised the study of the most fundamental and essential principles of being, considered in themselves; and the deductive application of these principles to the three great domains of actual reality, the corporeal universe, the human soul, and God. The study of the first principles of being in themselves would constitute _General Metaphysics_, or _Ontology_ (ὄντος-λόγος). Their applications would constitute three great departments of _Special Metaphysics_: _Cosmology_, which he described as “transcendental” in opposition to the experimental physical sciences; _Psychology_, which he termed “rational” in opposition to the empirical biological sciences; and finally Natural Theology, which he entitled _Theodicy_ (Θεός-δίκη-δικαιόω), using a term invented by Leibniz for his essays in vindication of the wisdom and justice of Divine Providence notwithstanding the evils of the universe.       “The spirit that animated this arrangement of the departments of     metaphysics,” writes Mercier, “was unsound in theory and     unfortunate in tendency. It stereotyped for centuries a disastrous     divorce between philosophy and the sciences, a divorce that had     its origin in circumstances peculiar to the intellectual     atmosphere of the early eighteenth century. As a result of it     there was soon no common language or understanding between     scientists and philosophers. The terms which expressed the most     fundamental ideas—matter, substance, movement, cause, force,     energy, and such like—were taken in different senses in science     and in philosophy. Hence misunderstandings, aggravated by a     growing mutual distrust and hostility, until finally people came     to believe that scientific and metaphysical preoccupations were     incompatible if not positively opposed to each other.”(26)      How very different from the disintegrating conception here     criticized is the traditional Aristotelian and scholastic     conception of the complementary functions of philosophy and the     sciences in unifying human knowledge: a conception thus eloquently     expressed by NEWMAN in his _Idea of a University_:—(27)      “All that exists, as contemplated by the human mind, forms one     large system or complex fact.... Now, it is not wonderful that,     with all its capabilities, the human mind cannot take in this     whole vast fact at a single glance, or gain possession of it at     once. Like a short-sighted reader, its eye pores closely, and     travels slowly, over the awful volume which lies open for its     inspection. Or again, as we deal with some huge structure of many     parts and sides, the mind goes round about it, noting down, first     one thing, then another, as best it may, and viewing it under     different aspects, by way of making progress towards mastering the     whole.... These various partial views or abstractions ... are     called sciences ... they proceed on the principle of a division of     labour.... As they all belong to one and the same circle of     objects, they are one and all connected together; as they are but     aspects of things, they are severally incomplete in their relation     to the things themselves, though complete in their own idea and     for their own respective purposes; on both accounts they at once     need and subserve each other. And further, the comprehension of     the bearings of one science on another, and the use of each to     each, and the location and limitation and adjustment and due     appreciation of them all, one with another, this belongs, I     conceive, to a sort of science distinct from all of them, and in     some sense, a science of sciences, which is my own conception of     what is meant by Philosophy....”   Without in any way countenancing such an isolation of metaphysics from the positive sciences, we may, nevertheless, adopt the modern division in substance and in practice. While recognizing the intimate connexion between the special sciences and metaphysics in all its branches, we may regard as _General Metaphysics_ all inquiries into the fundamental principles of _being_ and of _knowing_, of _reality_ and of _knowledge_; and as _Special Metaphysics_ the philosophical study of physical nature, of human nature, and of God, the Author and Supreme Cause of all finite reality. Thus, while special metaphysics would embrace Cosmology, Psychology, and Natural Theology, general metaphysics would embrace Ontology and Epistemology. These two latter disciplines must no doubt investigate what is in a certain sense one and the same subject-matter, inasmuch as _knowledge_ is knowledge of reality, nor can the _knowing mind_ (the _subjectum cognoscens_) and the known reality (the _objectum cognitum_) be wholly separated or studied in complete isolation from each other. Yet the whole content of human experience, which forms their common subject-matter, can be regarded by mental abstraction from the two distinct standpoints of the knowing mind and the known reality, and can thus give rise to two distinct sets of problems. Epistemology is thus concerned with the truth and certitude of human knowledge; with the subjective conditions and the scope and limits of its validity; with the subjective or mental factors involved in knowing.(28) Ontology is concerned with the objects of knowledge, with reality considered in the widest, deepest, and most fundamental aspects under which it is conceived by the human mind: with the being and becoming of reality, its possibility and its actuality, its essence and its existence, its unity and plurality; with the aspects of truth, goodness, perfection, beauty, which it assumes in relation with our minds; with the contingency of finite reality and the grounds and implications both of its actual existence and of its intelligibility; with the modes of its concrete existence and behaviour, the supreme categories of reality as they are called: substance, individual nature, and personality; quantity, space and time, quality and relation, causality and purpose. These are the principal topics investigated in the present volume. The investigation is confined to fundamental concepts and principles, leaving their applications to be followed out in special metaphysics. Furthermore, the theory of knowledge known as _Moderate Realism_,(29) the Realism of Aristotle and the Scholastics, in regard to the validity of knowledge both sensual and intellectual, is assumed throughout: because not alone is this the true theory, but—as a natural consequence—it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35722"],["title","Ontology, or the Theory of Being (#6)"],["body"," the only theory which renders the individual things and events of human experience really intelligible, and at the same time keeps the highest and most abstract intellectual speculations of metaphysics in constant and wholesome contact with the concrete, actual world in which we live, move, and have our being.  VIII. REMARKS ON SOME MISGIVINGS AND PREJUDICES.—The student, especially the beginner, will find the investigations in this volume rather abstract; but if he remembers that the content of our intellectual concepts, be they ever so abstract and universal, is really embodied in the individual things and events of his daily experience, he will not be disposed to denounce all ultimate analysis of these concepts as “unprofitable” or “unreal”. He will recognize that the reproach of “talking in the air,” which was levelled by an eminent medieval scholastic(30) at certain philosophers of his time, tells against the metaphysical speculations of Conceptualism, but not against those of Moderate Realism. The reproach is commonly cast at _all_ systematic metaphysics nowadays—from prejudices too numerous and varied to admit of investigation here.(31) The modern prejudice which denies the very possibility of metaphysics, a prejudice arising from Phenomenism, Positivism, and Agnosticism—systems which are themselves no less metaphysical than erroneous—will be examined in due course.(32)  But really in order to dispel all such misgivings one has only to remember that metaphysics, systematic or otherwise, is nothing more than a man’s reasoned outlook on the world and life. Whatever his conscious opinions and convictions may be regarding the nature and purpose of himself, and other men, and the world at large—and if he use his reason at all he must have some sort of opinions and convictions, whether positive or negative, on these matters—those opinions and convictions are precisely that man’s metaphysics. “Breaking free for the moment from all historical and technical definition, let us affirm: _To get at reality_—this is the aim of metaphysics.” So writes Professor Ladd in the opening chapter of his _Theory of Reality_.(33) But if this is so, surely a systematic attempt to “get at reality,” no matter how deep and wide, no matter how abstract and universal be the conceptions and speculations to which it leads us, cannot nevertheless always and of necessity have the effect of involving us in a mirage of illusion and unreality.       Systematic metaphysics—to quote again the author just referred     to—(34) is ... the necessary result of a patient, orderly,     well-informed, and prolonged study of those ultimate problems     which are proposed to every reflective mind by the real existences     and actual transactions of selves and of things. Thus considered     it appears as the least abstract and foreign to concrete realities     of all the higher pursuits of reason. Mathematics is abstract;     logic is abstract; mathematical and so-called “pure” physics are     abstract. But metaphysics is bound by its very nature and calling     always to keep near to the actual and to the concrete. Dive into     the depths of speculation indeed it may; and its ocean is     boundless in expanse and deep beyond all reach of human plummets.     But it finds its place of standing, for every new turn of daring     explanation, on some bit of solid ground. For it is actuality     which it wishes to understand—although in reflective and     interpretative way. To quote from Professor Royce: “The basis of     our whole theory is the bare, brute fact of experience which you     have always with you, namely, the fact: _Something is real._ Our     question is: What is this reality? or, again, What is the     ultimately real?”(35)   The wonderful progress of the positive sciences during the last few centuries has been the occasion of prejudice against metaphysics in a variety of ways. It is objected, for instance, that metaphysics has no corresponding progress to boast of; and from this there is but a small step to the conclusion that all metaphysical speculation is sterile. The comparison is unfair for many reasons. Research into the ultimate grounds and causes of things is manifestly more difficult than research into their proximate grounds and causes. Again, while the positive sciences have increased our knowledge mainly in extent rather than in depth, it is metaphysics and only metaphysics that can increase this knowledge in its unity, comprehensiveness, and significance.  A positive increase in our knowledge of the manifold data of human experience is not the aim of metaphysics; its aim is to give an ultimate meaning and interpretation to this knowledge. It is not utilitarian in the narrower sense in which the positive and special sciences are utilitarian by ministering to our material needs; but in the higher and nobler sense of pointing out to us the bearing of all human knowledge and achievement on our real nature and destiny. True, indeed, individual leaders and schools of metaphysics have strayed from the truth and spoken with conflicting and uncertain voices, especially when they have failed to avail themselves of Truth Divinely Revealed. This, however, is not a failure of metaphysics but of individual metaphysicians. And furthermore, it is undeniable withal, that the metaphysical labours of the great philosophers in all ages have contributed richly to the enlightenment and civilization of mankind—particularly when these labours have been in concord and co-operation with the elevating and purifying influences of the Christian religion. Of no metaphysical system is this so entirely true as of that embodied in Scholastic Philosophy. The greatest intellect of the Middle Ages, St. Thomas Aquinas, gave to this philosophy an expression which is rightly regarded by the modern scholastic as his intellectual charter and the most worthy starting-point of his philosophical investigations. The following passage from an eminent representative of modern scholastic thought(36) is sufficiently suggestive to admit of quotation:—       Amid the almost uninterrupted disintegration of systems during the     last three centuries, the philosophy of St. Thomas has alone been     able to stand the shock of criticism; it alone has proved     sufficiently solid and comprehensive to serve as an intellectual     basis and unifying principle for all the new facts and phenomena     brought to light by the modern sciences. And unless we are much     mistaken, those who take up and follow this philosophy will come     to think, as we do, that on the analysis of mental acts and     processes, on the inner nature of corporeal things, of living     things, and of man, on the existence and nature of God, on the     foundations of speculative and moral science, none have thought or     written more wisely than St. Thomas Aquinas. But though we place     our programme and teaching under the patronage of the illustrious     name of this prince of scholastics, we do not regard the Thomistic     philosophy as an ideal beyond possibility of amelioration, or as a     boundary to the activity of the human mind. We do think, however,     on mature reflection, that we are acting no less wisely than     modestly in taking it as our starting-point and constant standard     of reference. This we say in answer to those of our friends and     enemies who are occasionally pleased to ask us if we really do     mean to lead back the modern mind into the Middle Ages, and to     identify philosophy _simply_ with the thought of any _one_     philosopher. Manifestly, we mean nothing of the kind. Has not Leo     XIII., the great initiator of the new scholastic movement,     expressly warned us(37) to be mindful of the present: “Edicimus     libenti gratoque animo recipiendum esse quidquid sapienter dictum,     quidquid utiliter fuerit a quopiam inventum atque excogitatum”?      St. Thomas himself would be the first to rebuke those who would     follow his own philosophical opinions in all things against their     own better judgment, and to remind them of what he wrote at the     head of his _Summa_: that in philosophy, of all arguments that     based on human authority is the weakest, “locus ab auctoritate quæ     fundatur super ratione humana, est infirmissimus.”(38)      Again, therefore, let us assert that respect for tradition is not     servility but mere elementary prudence. Respect for a doctrine of     whose soundness and worth we are personally convinced is not     fetishism; it is but a rational and rightful tribute to the     dominion of Truth over Mind.      Modern scholastics will know how to take to heart and profit by     the lessons of the seventeenth and eighteenth century     controversies; they will avoid the mistakes of their predecessors;     they will keep in close contact with the special sciences     subsidiary to philosophy and with the views and teachings of     modern and contemporary thinkers.(39)   An overweening confidence in the power of the special sciences to solve ultimate questions, or at least to tell us all that can be known for certain about these problems, a confidence based on the astonishing progress of those sciences in modern times, is the source of yet another prejudice against metaphysics. It is a prejudice of the half-educated mind, of the camp-followers of science, not of its leaders. These latter are keenly conscious that the solution of ultimate questions lies entirely beyond the methods of the special sciences. Not that even the most eminent scientists do not indulge in speculations about ultimate problems—as they have a perfect right to do. But though they may be themselves quite aware that such speculations are distinctly metaphysical, there are multitudes who seem to think that a theory ceases to be metaphysical and becomes scientific provided only it is broached by a scientific expert as distinct from a metaphysician.(40) But all"]]]
