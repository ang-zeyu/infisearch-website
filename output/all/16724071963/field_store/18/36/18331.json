But, hoity-toity! he had not titupped very many yards when the unwieldy steed came prematurely to a halt and adopted an unruly deportment. Mr Bhosh inflicted corporal punishment upon its loins with a golden-headed whip, at which the rebellious beast erected itself upon its hinder legs until it was practically a biped.      [Illustration: THE CANTANKEROUS STEED EXECUTED A LEAP WITH     ASTOUNDING AGILITY (Illustration V)]  Bindabun, although at the extremity of his wits to preserve his saddle by his firm hold on the bridle-rein, undauntedly aimed a swishing blow at the head and front of the offending animal, which instantaneously returned its forelegs to _terra firma_, but elevated its latter end to such a degree that our hero very narrowly escaped sliding over its neck by cleverly clutching the saddleback.  Next, the cantankerous steed executed a leap with astounding agility, arching its back like a bow, and propelling our poor friend into the air like the arrow, though by providential luck and management on his part he descended safely into his seat after every repetition of this dangerous manoeuvre.  All things, however, must come to an end at some time, and the unwieldy quadruped at last became weary of leaping and, securing the complete control of his bit, did a bolt from the blue.  Willy nilly was Mr Bhosh compelled to accompany it upon its mad, unbridled career, while all witnesses freely hazarded the conjecture that his abduction would be rather speedily terminated by his being left behind, and I will presume to maintain that a less practical horseman would long before have become an ordinary pedestrian.  But Bindabun, although both stirrupholes were untenanted, and he was compelled to hold on to his steed's mane by his teeth and nails, nevertheless remained triumphantly in the ascendant.  On, on he rushed, making the entire circumference of the Park in his wild, delirious canter, and when the galloping horse once more reappeared, and Mr Bhosh was perceived to be still snug on his saddle, the spectators were unable to refrain from heartfelt joy.  A second time the incorrigible courser careered round the Park on his thundering great hoofs, and still our heroic friend preserved his equilibrium--but, heigh-ho! I have to sorrowfully relate that, on his third circuit, it was the different pair of shoes--for the headstrong animal, abstaining from motion in a rather too abrupt manner, propelled Mr Bhosh over its head with excessive velocity into the elegant interior of a victoria-carriage.  He alighted upon a great dame who had maliciously been enjoying the spectacle of his predicament, but who now was forced to experience the crushing repartee of his _tu quoque_, for such a forcible collision with his person caused her not only two blackened optics but irremediable damage to the leather of her nose.  The pristine beauty of her features was irrecoverably dismantled, while Mr Bhosh--thanks to his landing on such soft and yielding material--remained intact and able to return to his domicile in a four-wheeled cab.  Beloved reader, however sceptical thou mayest be, thou wilt infallibly admire with me the inscrutable workings of Nemesis, when thou learnest that the aforesaid great lady was no other than the Duchess of Dickinson, and (what is still more wonderful) that it was she who had insidiously presented him with such a fearful gift of the Danaides as an obstreperous and unwieldy steed!  Truly, as poet Shakespeare sagaciously observes, there is a divinity that rough-hews our ends, however we may endeavour to preserve their shapeliness!     CHAPTER VIII  A RIGHTABOUT FACER FOR MR BHOSH      Halloo! at a sudden your love warfare is changed!     Your dress is changed! Your address is changed!     Your express is changed! Your mistress is changed!     Halloo! at a sudden your funny fair is changed!      _A song sung by Messengeress Binda before Krishnagee_           _Dr. Ram Kinoo Dutt (of Chittagong)._   Those who are _au faits_ in the tortoise involutions of the feminine disposition will hear without astonishment that Duchess Dickinson--so far from being chastened and softened by the circumstance that the curse she had launched at Mr Bhosh's head had returned, like an illominous raven, to roost upon her own nose and irreparably destroy its contour--was only the more bitterly incensed against him.  Instead of interring the hatchet that had flown back, as if it were that fabulous volatile the boomerang, she was in a greater stew than ever, and resolved to leave no stone unturned to trip him up. But what trick to play, seeing that all the honours were in Mr Bhosh's hands?  She could not officiate as Marplot to discredit him in the affections of his lady-love, since the Princess was too severely enamoured to give the loan of her ear to any sibillations from a snake in grass.  How else, then, to hinder his match? At this she was seized with an idea worthy of Maccaroni himself. She paid a complimentary visit to the Princess, arrayed in the sheepish garb of a friend, and contrived to lure the conversation on to the vexed question of prying into futurity.  Surely, she artfully suggested, the Princess at such a momentous epoch of her existence had, of course, not neglected the sensible precaution of consulting some competent soothsayer respecting the most propitious day for her nuptials with the accomplished Mr Bhosh?...  What, had she omitted to pop so important a question? How incredibly harebrained! Fortunately, there was yet time to do the needful, and she herself would gladly volunteer to accompany the Princess on such an errand.  Princess Petunia fell a ready victim into the jaws of this diabolical booby-trap and inquired the address and name of the cleverest necromancer, for it is matter of notoriety that London ladies are quite as superstitious and addicted to working the oracle as their native Indian sisters.  The Duchess replied that the Astrologer-Royal was a _facile princeps_ at uttering a prediction, and accordingly on the very next day she and the Princess, after disguising themselves, set forth on the summit of a tramway 'bus to the Observatory Temple of Greenwich, where, after first propitiating the prophet by offerings, they were ushered into a darkened inner chamber. Although they were strictly _pseudo_, he at once informed them of their genuine cognomens, and also told them much concerning their past of which they had hitherto been ignorant.  And to the Princess he said, stroking the long and silvery hairs of his beard, \"My daughter, I foresee many calamities which will inevitably befall thee shouldest thou marry before the day on which the bridegroom wins a certain contest called the Derby with a horse of his own.\"  The gentle Petunia departed melancholy as a gib cat, since Mr Bhosh was not the happy possessor of so much as a single racing-horse of any description, and it was therefore not feasible that he should become entitled to wear the _cordon bleu_ of the turf in his buttonhole on his wedding day!  With many sighs and tears she imparted her piece of news to the horror-stricken ears of our hero, who earnestly assured her that it was contrary to commonsense and _bonos mores_, to attach any importance to the mere _ipse dixit_ of so antiquated a charlatan as the Astrologer-Royal, who was utterly incapable--except at very long intervals--to bring about even such a simple affair as an eclipse which was visible from his own Observatory!      [Illustration: 'MY DAUGHTER, I FORESEE MANY CALAMITIES WHICH WILL     INEVITABLY BEFALL THEE' (Illustration VI)]  However, the Princess, being a feminine, was naturally more prone to puerile credulities, and very solemnly declared that nothing would induce her to kneel by Mr Bhosh's side at the torch of Hymen until he should first have distinguished himself as a Derby winner.  Whereat Mr Bhosh, perceiving that the date of his nuptial ceremony was become a _dies non_ in a Grecian calendar, did wring his hands in a bath of tears.  Alas! he was totally unaware that it was his implacable enemy, the Duchess Dickinson, who had thus upset his apple-cart of felicity--but so it was, for by a clandestine bribe, she had corrupted the Astrologer-Royal--a poor, weak, very avaricious old chap--to trump out such a disastrous prediction.  Some heroes in this hard plight would have thrown up the leek, but Mr Bhosh was stuffed with sterner materials. He swore a very long oath by all the gods that he had ceased to believe in, that sooner or later, by crook or hook, he would win the Derby race, though entirely destitute of horseflesh and very ill able to afford to purchase the most mediocre quadruped.  Here some sporting readers will probably object! Why could he not enlist his unwieldy gifthorse among Derby candidates and so hoist the Duchess on the pinnacle of her own petard?  To which I reply: Too clever by halves, Misters! _Imprimis_, the steed in question was of far too ferocious a temperament (though undeniably swift-footed) ever to become a favourite with Derby judges; secondly, after dismounting Mr Bhosh, it had again taken to its heels and departed into the Unknown, nor had Mr Bhosh troubled himself to ascertain its private address.  But fortune favours the brave. It happened that Mr Bhosh was one day promenading down the Bayswater Road when he was passed by a white horse drawing a milk chariot with unparalleled velocity, outstripping omnibuses, waggons, and even butcher-carts in its wind-like progress, which was unguided by any restraining hand, for the milk-charioteer himself was pursuing on foot.  His natural puissance in equine affairs enabled Mr Bhosh to infer that the steed which could cut such a record when handicapped with a cumbrous dairy chariot would exhibit even greater speed if in _puris naturalibus_, and that it might even not improbably carry off first prize in the Derby race.  So, as the milk-charioteer"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36703"],["title","A Bayard From Bengal (#6)"],["body","up, overblown with anxiety, to learn the result of his horse's escapade, Mr Bhosh stopped him to inquire what he would take for such an animal.  The dairy-vendor, rather foolishly taking it for granted that horse and cart were gone concerns, thought he was making the good stroke of business in offering the lot for a twenty-pound note.  \"I have done with you!\" cried Mr Bhosh sharply, handing over the purchase-money, which he very fortunately chanced to have about him, and galloping off to inspect his bargain, which was like buying a pig after once poking it in the ribs.  In what condition he found it I must leave you to learn, my dear readers, in an ensuing chapter.     CHAPTER IX  THE DARK HORSE      Full many a mare with coat of milkiest sheen,       Is dyed in dark unfathomed coal mines drab;     Full many a flyer's born to blush unseen,       And waste her swiftness on a hansom cab.      _Lines to order by a young English friend, who swears they     are original. But I regard them as an unconscious     plagiarism from Poet Young's \"Eulogy of a Country     Cemetery.\" H. B. J._      It is a gain, a precious, let me gain! let me gain!       Oh, Potentate! Oh, Potentate!     The shower of thine secret shoe-dust       Oh, Potentate! Oh, Potentate!      _Dr. Ram Kinoo Dutt_ (_of Chittagong_).   We left Mr Bhosh in full pursuit of the runaway horse and milk-chariot which he had so spiritedly purchased while still _en route_. After running a mile or two, he was unspeakably rejoiced to find that the equipage had automatically come to a standstill and was still in prime condition--with the exception of the lacteal fluid, which had made its escape from the pails.  Bindabun, however, was not disposed to weep for long over spilt milk, and had the excessive magnanimity to restore the chariot and pails to the dairy merchant, who was beside himself with gratitude.  Then, Mr Bhosh, with a joyful heart, having detached his purchase from the shafts, conducted it in triumph to his domicile. It turned out to be a mare, white as snow and of marvellous amiability; and, partly because of her origin, and partly from her complexion, he christened her by the appellation of _Milky Way_.  Although perforce a complete ignoramus in the art of educating a horse to win any equine contest, Mr Bhosh's nude commonsense told him that the first step was to fatten his rather too filamentous pupil with corn and similar seeds, and after a prolonged course of beanfeasts he had the gratification to behold his mare filling out as plump as a dumpling.  As he desired her to remain the dark horse as long as possible, he concealed her in a small toolshed at the end of the garden, ministering to her wants with his own hands, and conducting her for daily nocturnal constitutionals several times round the central grass-patch.  For some time he refrained from mounting--\"fain would he climb but that he feared to fall,\" as Poet Bunyan once scratched with a diamond on Queen Anne's window; but at length, reflecting that if nothing ventures nothing is certain to win, he purchased a padded saddle with appendages, and surmounted _Milky Way_, who, far from regarding him as an interloper, appeared gratified by his arrival, and did her utmost to make him feel thoroughly at home.  The next step was, of course, to obtain permission from the pundits who rule the roast of the Jockey Club, that _Milky Way_ might be allowed to compete in the approaching Derby.  Now this was a more delicately ticklish matter than might be supposed, owing to the circumstance that the said pundits are such warm men, and so well endowed with this world's riches that they are practically non-corruptible.  Fortunately, Mr Bhosh, as a dabster in English composition, was a pastmaster in drawing a petition, and, sitting down, he constructed the following:--      TO THOSE MOST WORSHIPFUL BIGHEADS IN CONTROL OF JOCKEYS CLUB.      BENIGN PERSONAGES!      This Petition humbly sheweth:      (1.) That your Petitioner is a native Indian Cambridge B.A., a     Barrister-at-law, and a most loyal and devoted subject of Her     Majesty the QUEEN-EMPRESS.      (2.) That it is of excessive importance to him, for private     reasons, that he should win a Derby Race.      (3.) That such a famous victory would be eminently popular with all     classes of Indian natives, and inordinately increase their affection     for British rule.      (4.) That for some time past your Petitioner has been diligently     training a quadruped which he fondly hopes may gain a victory.      (5.) That said quadruped is a member of the fair sex.      (6.) That she is a female horse of very docile disposition, but,     being only recently extracted from shafts of dairy chariot, is a     total neophyte in Derby racing.      (7.) That your lordships may direct that she is to be kindly     permitted to try her luck in this world-famous competition.      (8.) That it would greatly encourage her to exhibit topmost speed if     she could be allowed to start running a few minutes previously to     older stagers.      (9.) That if this is unfortunately contrary to regulations, then the     Judge should receive secret instructions to look with a favourable     eye upon the said female horse (whose name is _Milky Way_) and award     her first prize, even if by any chance she may not prove quite so     fast a runner as more professional hacks:      And your Petitioner will ever pray on bended knees that so truly     magnificent an institution as the Epsom Derby Course may never be     suppressed on grounds of encouraging national vice of gambling and     so forth. Signed, &c.  The wording of the above proved Mr Bhosh's profound acquaintance with the human heart, for it instantaneously attained the desired end.  The Honble Stewards returned a very kind answer, readily consenting to receive _Milky Way_ as a candidate for Derby honours, but regretting that it was _ultra vires_ to concede her a few minutes' start, and intimating that she must start with a scratch in company with all the other horses.  Bindabun was not in the least degree cast down or depressed by this refusal of a start, since he had not entertained any sanguine hope that it would be granted, and had only inserted it to make insurance doubly sure, for he was every day more confident that _Milky Way_ was to win, even though obliged to step off with the rank and file.     CHAPTER X  TRUST HER NOT! SHE IS FOOLING THEE!      As the Sunset flames most fiery when snuffed out by sudden night;     As the Swan reserves its twitter till about to hop the twig;     As the Cobra's head swells biggest just before he does his bite;     So a feminine smiles her sweetest ere she gives her nastiest dig.      _Satirical Stanza (unpublished) by H. B. J._   Now that our hero had obtained that the name of _Milky Way_ was to be inscribed on the Golden Book of Derby candidates, his next proceeding was to hire a practical jockey to assume supreme command of her.  And this was no simple matter, since practical jockeys are usually hired many weeks beforehand, and demand handsome wages for taking their seats. But at last, after protracted advertisements, Mr Bhosh had the good fortune to pitch upon a perfect treasure, whose name was Cadwallader Perkin, and who, for his riding in some race or other, had been awarded a whole year's holiday by the stewards who had observed the paramountcy of his horsemanship.  No sooner had Perkin inspected _Milky Way_ than he was quite in love with his stable companion, and assured his employer that, with more regular out-of-door exercise, she would be easily competent to win the Derby on her head, whereupon Mr Bhosh consented that she should be galloped after dark round the inner circle of Regent's Park, which is chiefly populated at such a time by male and female bicyclists.  But in order to pay Perkins charges, and also provide a silken jockey tunic and cap of his own racing colours (which were cream and sky-blue), Mr Bhosh was compelled to borrow more money from Mr McAlpine, who, as a Jewish Scotch, exacted the rather exorbitant interest of sixty per centum.  It leaked out in some manner that _Milky Way_ was a coming Derby favourite, and the property of a Native young Indian sportsman, whose entire fortunes depended on her success, and soon immense multitudes congregated in Regent's Park to witness her trials of speed, and cheered enthusiastically to behold the fiery sparks scintillating from the stones as she circumvented the inner circle in seven-leagued boots.  Mr Bhosh of course asseverated that she was a very mediocre sort of mare, and that he did not at all expect that she would prove a winner, but connoisseurs nevertheless betted long odds upon her success, and Bindabun himself, though not a speculative, did put on the pot himself upon the golden egg which he was so anxiously hatching.  One evening amongst those who were gathered to view the nocturnal exercises of _Milky Way_ there appeared a feminine spectator of rather sinister aspect, in a thick veil and a victoria-carriage.  It was no other than Duchess Dickinson, who had somehow learnt how courageously Mr Bhosh was endeavouring to fulfil the Astrologer-Royal's prediction, and who had come to ascertain whether his mare was indeed such a paragon of celerity as had been represented.  The very first time that _Milky Way_ cantered past with the gait of a streak of lightning, the Duchess realised with a sinking heart that Mr Bhosh must indubitably succeed at the Derby--_unless he was prevented_.  But how to achieve this? Her womanly instinct told her that Cadwallader Perkin was far too inexperienced to resist for long such mature and ripened charms as hers--even though the latter were unfortunately discounted by the accidental nose-flattening.  So, lowering her veil till only her eyes were visible above, she waited till he passed once more, then flung him such a liquid and flashing glance from her starry and now no"]]]
