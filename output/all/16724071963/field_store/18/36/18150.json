-----------------+-------------+---------+-------------+---------+-------------  [A] Orbital diameter.  The air bladder of KU 4253 is nearly as large as in _Gila_, and much larger than the degenerate air bladder of _R. cataractae_. Although the hybrid appears to be male, the gonads (especially the right one) are poorly developed. The hybrid is intermediate in curvature of the lateral line, which is nearly straight in _Rhinichthys_ and strongly decurved in _Gila_.  Specimen No. 4253 is mostly pallid, resembling _Gila_ much more than _Rhinichthys_ in pigmentation. A mid-dorsal dark streak is conspicuous in the hybrid, especially anteriorly, but is less intense than in _Gila_. _Rhinichthys_ lacks a well-developed dorsal stripe. The preorbital and suborbital areas are more heavily pigmented in the hybrid than in _Gila_, but not nearly so dark as in _Rhinichthys_. The hybrid has a faint dark basicaudal spot that is variably developed in _Rhinichthys_ but absent in _Gila_.  =_Notropis venustus venustus_ × _Notropis whipplei_=: KU 3516 (a male, 47.8 mm. in standard length), from Arkansas, Sevier Co., Winters Creek where it is crossed by U. S. Highway 71, 5 mi. N of Little River Bridge, March 8, 1956. Compared in Table 5 with four specimens of _N. whipplei_, KU 3517 (45.0-52.6 mm. in standard length, mean 50.6 mm.), same locality and date as KU 3516; four specimens of _N. v. venustus_, KU 3510 (44.5-49.6 mm. in standard length, mean 47.3 mm.), Louisiana, Winn Parish, Little Naches Bayou on U. S. Highway 71, 8.8 mi. NW Montgomery, March 4, 1956; three specimens of _Notropis lutrensis_ (Baird and Girard) × _N. v. venustus_, KU 3510 (43.3-47.3 mm. in standard length, mean 44.7 mm.), same locality and date as _N. v. venustus_ above; and with tabulated data on _N. v. venustus_ from Gibbs (1957a:185-186). All specimens are from the lower Red River Drainage; other series of _N. whipplei_, _N. venustus_, and _N. lutrensis_ × _N. venustus_, from the Red River Drainage and elsewhere, were examined but are not tabulated because of differences in size, and because of geographic variability that has been discussed by Gibbs (1957a).  The Subgenus _Cyprinella_ of _Notropis_, to which _N. venustus_ and _N. whipplei_ belong, has been studied intensively by Gibbs (1957a and b). _Notropis venustus_ differs conspicuously from _N. whipplei_ in having a large dark basicaudal spot; also, _N. venustus_ usually has 8 (rather than 9) anal rays, and 15 (rather than 13) scales above the lateral line immediately anterior to the dorsal fin. Specimens of _N. v. venustus_ from the Red River Drainage, where the most robust representatives of the species are found, differ from _N. whipplei_ in depth of head, body, and caudal peduncle (Table 5).  KU 3516 has a composite of the 9-rayed anal fin of _N. whipplei_ and the caudal spot (albeit diffuse) of _N. venustus_; and, the hybrid is intermediate in body-proportions that distinguish the two"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35838"],["title","Five Natural Hybrid Combinations in Minnows (Cyprinidae) (#4)"],["body","es, especially depth of head, body, and caudal peduncle. In other features KU 3516 has values within the overlapping ranges of variation of _whipplei_ and _venustus_ except that the ratio of postdorsal length to standard length is extremely long in the hybrid, and the ratio of prepelvic length to standard length is extremely short (Table 5). Both extreme values for the hybrid seem to result from the cumulative influence of characters in which the parental species differ slightly in mean value (especially head-length, in which the hybrid is like _whipplei_, and caudal peduncle-length, in which the hybrid approaches _venustus_, despite the 9-rayed anal fin of the hybrid). The basicaudal spot of the hybrid is like that of _N. v. venustus_ except for being less intense.  _Notropis venustus_ hybridizes extensively with _N. lutrensis_ (Hubbs, Kuehne, and Ball, 1953:226-230; Hubbs and Strawn, 1956), and that combination occurs in streams near the locality where KU 3516 was taken. KU 3516 resembles _N. lutrensis_ × _N. v. venustus_ in many ways, but is more slender than the latter hybrid. The depth of head, body, and caudal peduncle are greater in _N. lutrensis_ than in _N. venustus_ (much greater than in _N. whipplei_); therefore, specimens of _N. lutrensis_ × _N. venustus_ are usually deeper than _N. venustus_, whereas KU 3516 is less deep. KU 3516 has a rather sharp snout and thin, straight lips that are strongly suggestive of _N. whipplei_, rather than _N. lutrensis_, in which the snout is rounded and the lips are more obliquely decurved. There is less pigment underlying the anterior lateral-line scales in KU 3516 than in _N. lutrensis_ × _N. venustus_, and melanophores on the scale-pockets of KU 3516 are arranged in narrower, more distinct submarginal bars than in _N. lutrensis_ × _N. venustus_. Because of the difference in pigmentation, the lateral scales of _N. whipplei_ (and of KU 3516) appear more narrowly diamond-shaped than the lateral scales of _N. lutrensis_ or _N. lutrensis_ × _N. venustus_. The lengths and heights of the scales are approximately the same in all three species.  Winters Creek, where KU 3516 was taken, flowed approximately five cubic feet per second at the time our collection was made; a landowner on the stream stated that it had been dry, except for pools, in the previous two summers. The water was somewhat gray, but nearly clear. The habitat consisted mainly of short riffles, with average depth of four inches, and pools to depths of two feet. Twelve species of fish, including _N. whipplei_ but not _N. lutrensis_ or _N. venustus_, were found; other minnows were _Semotilus atromaculatus_, _N. chalybaeus_, _N. cornutus_, _N. umbratilis_, and _Campostoma anomalum_.
