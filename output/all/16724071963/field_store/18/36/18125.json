It is only the former field of investigation that is usually accorded to Logic nowadays; and thus understood Logic ought to come first in the curriculum as a preparatory training for philosophical studies, accompanied, however, by certain elementary truths from Psychology regarding the nature and functions of the human mind. The other domain of deeper and more speculative investigation was formerly explored in what was regarded as a second portion of logical science, under the title of “Critical” Logic—_Logica Critica_. In modern times this is regarded as a distinct department of Speculative Philosophy, under the various titles of _Epistemology_, _Criteriology_, or the _Theory of Knowledge_.  _Ethics or Moral Philosophy_ (ἤθος, _mos_, _mores_, morals, conduct) is that department of practical philosophy which has for its subject-matter all human acts, _i.e._ all acts elicited or commanded by the will of man considered as a free, rational and responsible agent. And it studies human conduct with the practical purpose of discovering the ultimate end or object of this conduct, and the principles whereby it must be regulated in order to attain to this end. Ethics must therefore analyse and account for the distinction of _right_ and _wrong_ or _good_ and _bad_ in human conduct, for its feature of _morality_. It must examine the motives that influence conduct: pleasure, well-being, happiness, duty, obligation, moral law, etc. The supreme determining factor in all such considerations will obviously be _the ultimate end of man_, whatever this may be: his destiny as revealed by a study of his nature and place in the universe. Now the nature of man is studied in Psychology, as are also the nature, conditions and effects of his free acts, and the facilities, dispositions and forms of character consequent on these. Furthermore, not only from the study of man in Psychology, but from the study of the external universe in Cosmology, we amass data from which in Natural Theology we establish the existence of a Supreme Being. We then prove in Ethics that the last end of man, his highest perfection, consists in knowing, loving, serving, and thus glorifying God, both in this life and in the next. Hence we can see how these branches of speculative philosophy subserve the practical science of morals. And since a man’s interpretation of the moral distinctions—as of right or wrong, meritorious or blameworthy, autonomous or of obligation—which he recognizes as pertaining to his own actions—since his interpretation of these distinctions is so intimately bound up with his religious outlook and beliefs, it is at once apparent that the science of Ethics will be largely influenced and determined by the system of speculative philosophy which inspires it, whether this be Theism, Monism, Agnosticism, etc. No doubt the science of Ethics must take as its data all sorts of moral beliefs, customs and practices prevalent at any time among men; but it is not a speculative science which would merely aim at _a posteriori_ inferences or inductive generalizations from these data; it is a practical, _normative_ science which aims at discovering the truth as to what is the right and the wrong in human conduct, and at pointing out the right application of the principles arising out of this truth. Hence it is of supreme importance for the philosopher of morals to determine whether the human race has really been vouchsafed a Divine Revelation, and, convincing himself that Christianity contains such a revelation, to recognize the possibility of supplementing and perfecting what his own natural reason can discover by what the Christian religion teaches about the end of man as the supreme determining principle of human conduct. Not that he is to take the revealed truths of Christianity as principles of moral _philosophy_; for these are the principles of the _supernatural __ Christian Theology_ of human morals; but that as a Christian philosopher, _i.e._ a philosopher who recognizes the truth of the Christian Revelation, he should reason out philosophically a science of Ethics which, so far as it goes, will be in harmony with the moral teachings of the Christian Religion, and will admit of being perfected by these. This recognition, as already remarked, will not be a hindrance but a help to him in exploring the wide domains of the individual, domestic, social and religious conduct of man; in determining, on the basis of theism established by natural reason, the right moral conditions and relations of man’s conduct as an individual, as a member of the family, as a member of the state, and as a creature of God. The nature, source and sanction of authority, domestic, social and religious; of the dictate of conscience; of the natural moral law and of all positive law; of the moral virtues and vices—these are all questions which the philosopher of Ethics has to explore by the use of natural reason, and for the investigation of which the Christian philosopher of Ethics is incomparably better equipped than the philosopher who, though possessing the compass of natural reason, ignores the beacon lights of Divinely Revealed Truths.  _Esthetics_, or the _Philosophy of the Fine Arts_, is that department of philosophy which studies the conception of the _beautiful_ and its external expression in the works of nature and of man. The arts themselves, of course, whether concerned with the realization of the useful or of the beautiful, are distinct from sciences, even from practical sciences.(13) The _technique_ itself consists in a skill acquired by practice—by practice guided, however, by a set of practical canons or rules which are the ripe fruit of experience.(14) But behind every art there is always some background of more or less speculative truth. The conception of the _useful_, however which underlies the mechanical arts and crafts, is not an ultimate conception calling for any further analysis than it receives in the various special sciences and in metaphysics. But the conception of the _beautiful_ does seem to demand a special philosophical consideration. On the subjective or mental side the esthetic sense, artistic taste, the sentiment of the beautiful, the complex emotions accompanying such experience; on the objective side the elements or factors requisite to produce this experience; the relation of the esthetic to the moral, of the beautiful to the good and the true—these are all distinctly philosophical questions. Up to the present time, however, their treatment has been divided between the other departments of philosophy—psychology, cosmology, natural theology, general metaphysics, ethics—rather than grouped together to form an additional distinct department.  V. DEPARTMENTS OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY: METAPHYSICS.—The philosophy which studies the order realized in things apart from our activity, speculative philosophy, has been variously divided up into separate departments from the first origins of philosophical speculation.  When we remember that all intellectual knowledge of things involves the apprehension of _general_ truths or laws about these things, and that this apprehension of intelligible aspects common to a more or less extensive group of things involves the exercise of _abstraction_, we can understand how the whole domain of speculative knowledge, whether scientific or philosophical, can be differentiated into certain layers or levels, so to speak, according to various degrees of abstractness and universality in the intelligible aspects under which the data of our experience may be considered. On this principle Aristotle and the scholastics divided all speculative knowledge into three great domains, _Physics_, _Mathematics_ and _Metaphysics_, with their respective proper objects, _Change_, _Quantity_ and _Being_, objects which are successively apprehended in three great stages of abstraction traversed by the human mind in its effort to understand and explain the Universal Order of things.  And as a matter of fact perhaps the first great common and most obvious feature which strikes the mind reflecting on the visible universe is the feature of all-pervading change (κίνησις), movement, evolution, progress and regress, growth and decay; we see it everywhere in a variety of forms, mechanical or local change, quantitative change, qualitative change, vital change. Now the knowledge acquired by the study of things under this common aspect is called _Physics_. Here the mind abstracts merely from the individualizing differences of this change in individual things, and fixes its attention on the great, common, sensible aspect itself of visible change.  But the mind can abstract even from the sensible changes that take place in the physical universe and fix its attention on a _static_ feature in the changing things. This static element (τὸ ἀκίνητον), which the intellect apprehends in _material_ things as naturally inseparable from them (ἀκίνητον ἀλλ᾽ οὐ χωριστόν), is their _quantity_, their extension in space. When the mind strips a material object of all its visible, sensible properties—on which its mechanical, physical and chemical changes depend—there still remains as an object of thought a something formed of parts outside parts in three dimensions of space. This _abstract_ quantity, _quantitas intelligibilis_—whether as continuous or discontinuous, as _magnitude_ or _multitude_—is the proper object of _Mathematics_.  But the mind can penetrate farther still into the reality of the material data which it finds endowed with the attributes of change and quantity: it can eliminate from the object of its thought even this latter or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35722"],["title","Ontology, or the Theory of Being (#4)"],["body"," attribute, and seize on something still more fundamental. The very essence, substance, nature, being itself, of the thing, the underlying subject and root principle of all the thing’s operations and attributes, is something deeper than any of these attributes, something at least mentally distinct from these latter (τὸ ἀκίνητον και χωριστόν): and this something is the proper object of man’s highest speculative knowledge, which Aristotle called ἡ πρώτη φιλοσοφία, _philosophia prima_, the _first_ or _fundamental_ or _deepest_ philosophy.(15)  But he gave this latter order of knowledge another very significant title: he called it _theology_ or _theological science_, ἐπιστήμη θεολογίκή, by a denomination derived _a potiori parte_, from its nobler part, its culmination in the knowledge of God. Let us see how. For Aristotle _first philosophy_ is the science of _being and its essential attributes_.(16) Here the mind apprehends its object as _static_ or abstracted from change, and as _immaterial_ or abstracted from quantity, the fundamental attribute of material reality—as ἀκίνητον καὶ χωριστόν. Now it is the substance, nature, or essence of _the things of our direct and immediate experience_, that forms the proper object of this highest science. But in these things the substance, nature, or essence, is not found in _real and actual_ separation from the material attributes of change and quantity; it is _considered_ separately from these only by an effort of mental abstraction. Even the nature of man himself is not wholly immaterial; nor is the spiritual principle in man, his soul, entirely exempt from material conditions. Hence in so far as first philosophy studies the being of the things of our direct experience, its object is immaterial only _negatively_ or _by mental abstraction_. But does this study bring within the scope of our experience any being or reality that is _positively and actually_ exempt from all change and all material conditions? If so the study of this being, the Divine Being, will be the highest effort, the crowning perfection, of _first philosophy_; which we may therefore call the _theological_ science. “If,” writes Aristotle,(17) “there really exists a substance absolutely immutable and immaterial, in a word, a Divine Being—as we hope to prove—then such Being must be the absolutely first and supreme principle, and the science that attains to such Being will be theological.”  In this triple division of speculative philosophy into Physics, Mathematics, and Metaphysics, it will naturally occur to one to ask: Did Aristotle distinguish between what he called Physics and what we nowadays call the special physical sciences? He did. These special _analytic_ studies of the various departments of the physical universe, animate and inanimate, Aristotle described indiscriminately as “partial” sciences: αἱ ἐν μέρει ἐπιστημάι—ἐπιστημαὶ ἐν μέρει λεγόμεναι. These descriptive, inductive, comparative studies, proceeding _a posteriori_ from effects to causes, he conceived rather as a preparation for scientific knowledge proper; this latter he conceived to be a _synthetic_, deductive explanation of things, in the light of some common aspect detected in them as principle or cause of all their concrete characteristics.(18) Such synthetic knowledge of things, in the light of some such common aspect as change, is what he regarded as scientific knowledge, meaning thereby what we mean by philosophical knowledge.(19) What he called _Physics_, therefore, is what we nowadays understand as _Cosmology_ and _Psychology_.(20)  Mathematical science Aristotle likewise regarded as science in the full and perfect sense, _i.e._ as philosophical. But just as we distinguish nowadays between the special physical and human sciences on the one hand, and the philosophy of external nature and man on the other, so we may distinguish between the special mathematical sciences and a Philosophy of Mathematics: with this difference, that while the former groups of special sciences are mainly inductive the mathematical group is mainly deductive. Furthermore, the Philosophy of Mathematics—which investigates questions regarding the ultimate significance of mathematical concepts, axioms and assumptions: unity, multitude, magnitude, quantity, space, time, etc.—does not usually form a separate department in the philosophical curriculum: its problems are dealt with as they arise in the other departments of Metaphysics.  Before outlining the modern divisions of Metaphysics we may note that this latter term was not used by Aristotle. We owe it probably to Andronicus of Rhodes († 40 B.C.), who, when arranging a complete edition of Aristotle’s works, placed next in order after the _Physics_, or physical treatises, all the parts and fragments of the master’s works bearing upon the immutable and immaterial object of the _philosophia prima_; these he labelled τὰ μετὰ τὰ (βιβλία) φυσικα, _post physica_, the books _after the physics_: hence the name _metaphysics_,(21) applied to this highest section of speculative philosophy. It was soon noticed that the term, thus fortuitously applied to such investigations, conveyed a very appropriate description of their scope and character if interpreted in the sense of “_supra_-physica,” or “_trans_-physica”: inasmuch as the object of these investigations is a _hyperphysical_ object, an object that is either positively and really, or negatively and by abstraction, beyond the material conditions of quantity and change. St. Thomas combines both meanings of the term when he says that the study of its subject-matter comes naturally _after_ the study of physics, and that we naturally pass from the study of the sensible to that of the suprasensible.(22)  The term _philosophia prima_ has now only an historical interest; and the term _theology_, used without qualification, is now generally understood to signify _supernatural_ theology.  VI. DEPARTMENTS OF METAPHYSICS: COSMOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, AND NATURAL THEOLOGY.—Nowadays the term _Metaphysics_ is understood as synonymous with speculative philosophy: the investigation of the being, nature, or essence, and essential attributes of the realities which are also studied in the various special sciences: the search for the _ultimate_ grounds, reasons and causes of these realities, of which the proximate explanations are sought in the special sciences. We have seen that it has for its special object that most abstract aspect of reality whereby the latter is conceived as changeless and immaterial; and we have seen that a being may have these attributes either by mental abstraction merely, or in actual reality. In other words the philosophical study of things that are really material not only suggests the possibility, but establishes the actual existence, of a Being that is really changeless and immaterial: so that metaphysics in all its amplitude would be _the philosophical science of things that are negatively_ (by abstraction) _or positively_ (in reality) _immaterial_. This distinction suggests a division of metaphysics into _general_ and _special_ metaphysics. The former would be the philosophical study of _all_ being, considered by mental abstraction as immaterial; the latter would be the philosophical study of the really and positively changeless and immaterial Being,—God. The former would naturally fall into two great branches: the study of _inanimate_ nature and the study of _living_ things, _Cosmology_ and _Psychology_; while special metaphysics, the philosophical study of the _Divine_ Being, would constitute _Natural Theology_. These three departments, one of special metaphysics and two of general metaphysics, would not be three distinct philosophical sciences, but three departments of the one speculative philosophical science. The standpoint would be the same in all three sections, _viz._ _being_ considered as _static and immaterial_ by _mental abstraction_: for whatever _positive_ knowledge we can reach about being that is really immaterial can be reached only through concepts derived from material being and applied analogically to immaterial being.  _Cosmology_ and _Psychology_ divide between them the whole domain of man’s immediate experience. Cosmology, utilizing not only the data of direct experience, but also the conclusions established by the analytic study of these data in the physical sciences, explores the origin, nature, and destiny of the material universe. Some philosophers include among the data of Cosmology all the phenomena of vegetative life, reserving sentient and rational life for Psychology; others include even sentient life in Cosmology, reserving the study of human life for Psychology, or, as they would call it, Anthropology.(23) The mere matter of location is of secondary importance. Seeing, however, that man embodies in himself all three forms of life, vegetative, sentient, and rational, all three would perhaps more naturally belong to Psychology, which would be the philosophical study of life in all its manifestations (ψυχή, the vital principle, the soul). Just as the conclusions of the physical sciences are the data of Cosmology, so the conclusions of the natural or biological sciences—Zoology, Botany, Physiology, Morphology, Cellular Biology, etc.—are the data of Psychology. Indeed in Psychology itself—especially in more recent years—it is possible to distinguish a positive, analytic, empirical study of the phenomena of consciousness, a study which would rank rather as a special than as an ultimate or philosophical science; and a synthetic, rational study of the results of this analysis, a study which would be strictly philosophical in character. This would have for its object to determine the origin, nature and destiny of living things in general and of man himself in particular. It would inquire into the nature and essential properties of living matter, into the nature of the subject of conscious states, into the operations and faculties of the human "]]]
