[_Exit VASQUEZ._  _Isab._ Don Fernando! Oh, then, this is the rascally valet, but I'll give him a welcome with a vengeance!  _Spado._ Hold, madam! Suppose, for a little sport, you seem to humour the deceit, only to see how the fellow acts his part; he'll play the gentleman very well, I'll warrant; the dog is an excellent mimic; for, you must know, ma'am, this Pedrillo's mother was a gipsy, his father a merry andrew to a mountebank, and he himself five years trumpeter to a company of strolling players.  _Isab._ So, I was likely to have a hopeful son-in-law! Good sir, we are eternally indebted to you for this timely notice of the imposition.  _Spado._ Madam, I've done the common duties of an honest man--I have been long in the family, and can't see my master making such a fool of himself, without endeavouring to prevent any mischance in consequence.  _Isab._ Dear sir, I beseech you be at home under this roof; pray be free, and want for nothing the house affords.  _Spado._ [_Bows._] Good madam! I'll want for nothing I can lay my fingers on. [_Aside._]                                                           [_Exit SPADO._  _Isab._ Heavens! what an honest soul it is! what a lucky discovery! Oh, here comes my darling girl!  _Enter LORENZA, magnificently dressed._  _Lor._ Oh, cara Madre! See, behold!--Can I fail of captivating Don Fernando? Don't I look charming?  _Isab._ Why, Lorenza, I must say the toilet has done its duty; I'm glad to see you in such spirits, my dear child!  _Lor._ Spirits! ever gay, ever sprightly, cheerful as a lark--but how shall I forget my Florence lover, my dear Ramirez?  _Isab._ I request, my dear, you'll not think of this Ramirez--even from your own account of him, he must be a person of most dissolute principles--fortunately he knows you only by your name of Lorenza. I hope he won't find you out here.  _Lor._ Then farewell, beloved Ramirez! In obedience to your commands, madam, I shall accept of this Don Fernando; and as a husband, I will love him if I can--   AIR VII.--LORENZA.    _Love! gay illusion!_   _Pleasing delusion,_   _With sweet intrusion,_       _Possesses the mind._    _Love with love meeting,_   _Passion is fleeting;_   _Vows in repeating_       _We trust to the wind._    _Faith to faith plighted,_   _Love may be blighted;_   _Hearts often slighted_       _Will cease to be kind._  _Enter VASQUEZ._  _Vas._ Madam--my master and Don Fernando.  _Isab._ Has Don Fernando a servant with him?  _Vas._ No, madam.  _Isab._ Oh, when he comes, take notice of him.  _Enter DON SCIPIO and FERNANDO._  _Don Scipio._ Oh, my darling dame, and my delicate daughter, bless your stars that you see poor old Scipio alive again--Behold my son-in-law and the preserver of my life--Don Fernando, there's your spouse, and this is Donna Isabella, a lady of vast merit, of which my heart is sensible.  _Don Fer._ Madam!                                                              [_Salutes._  _Isab._ What an impudent fellow!                                                                [_Aside._  _Don Scipio._ Dear Fernando, you are as welcome to this castle as flattery to a lady, but there she is--bill and coo--embrace--caress her.                                             [_FERNANDO salutes LORENZA._  _Lor._ If I had never seen Ramirez, I should think the man tolerable enough!                                                                [_Aside._  _Don Scipio._ Ha! ha! this shall be the happy night--Eh, Dame Isabel, by our agreement, before the lark sings, I take possession of this noble tenement.  _Don Fer._ Don Scipio, I hoped to have the honour of seeing your son.  _Don Scipio._ My son! Who, Cæsar? Oh, lord! He's--He was a--turned out a profligate--Sent him to Italy--got into bad company--don't know what's become of him--My dear friend, if you would not offend me, never mention Don Cæsar in my hearing. Egad--Eh, my dainty dame, is not Don Fernando a fine fellow?  _Isab._ Yes, he's well enough for a trumpeter.  _Don Scipio._ Trumpeter! [_With surprise._] what the devil do you mean by that? Oh, because I sound his praise; but, madam, he's a cavalier of noble birth, title, fortune, and valour--  _Isab._ Don Scipio, a word if you please.                                                      [_Takes him aside._  _Lor._ [_To FERNANDO._] Si--Signor, our castle here is rather a gloomy mansion, when compared to the beautiful cassinos on the banks of the Arno.  _Don Fer._ Arno! true, Don Scipio said in his letter, that his daughter had been bred at Florence.  _Lor._ You have had an unpleasant journey, signor?  _Don Fer._ I have encountered some difficulties by the way, it is true, madam; but am amply repaid by the honour and happiness I now enjoy.                                                                 [_Bows._  _Lor._ Sir!--I swear he's a polite cavalier! [_Aside._] Won't you please to sit, sir? I fancy you must be somewhat weary.                                                                 [_Sits._  _Don Scipio._ What the devil! Eh, sure--what this fellow only Don Fernando's footman! how! it can't be!  _Isab._ A fact; and presently you'll see Don Fernando himself in livery.  _Don Scipio._ Look at the impudent son of a gipsy--Sat himself down--Zounds! I'll--  _Isab._ Hold! let him play off a few of his airs.  _Don Scipio._ A footman! Ay, this accounts for his behaviour in the forest--Don Fernando would never have accepted my purse--[_Taps his Shoulder._]--Hey, what, you've got there!  _Don Fer._ Will you please to sit, sir?                                                                [_Rises._  _Don Scipio._ Yes, he looks like a trumpeter. [_Aside._] You may sit down, friend.                                                        [_With contempt._  _Don Fer._ A strange old gentleman!  _Enter VASQUEZ._  _Vas._ Sir, your servant Pedrillo is arrived.                                                         [_Exit VASQUEZ._  _Isab._ Servant Pedrillo! Ay, this is Fernando himself.                                            [_Apart, joyfully to SCIPIO._  _Don Fer._ Oh, then the fellow has found his way at last. Don Scipio--Ladies--excuse me a moment.                                                        [_Exit FERNANDO._  _Lor._ What a charming fellow!  _Don Scipio._ What an impudent rascal!  _Ped._ [_Without._] Is my master this way?  _Don Scipio._ Master! ay, this is Fernando.  _Enter PEDRILLO, with a Portmanteau._  _Ped._ Oh dear! I've got among the gentlefolks--I ask pardon.  _Isab._ How well he does look and act the servant!  _Don Scipio._ Admirable; yet I perceive the grandee under the livery.  _Isab._ Please to sit, sir.                                                   [_With great respect._  _Lor._ A livery servant sit down by me!  _Don Scipio._ Pray sit down, sir.                                                        [_Ceremoniously._  _Ped._ Sit down! [_Sits._] Oh, these must be the upper servants of the family--her ladyship here is the housekeeper, I suppose--the young tawdry tit, lady's maid--(Hey, her mistress throws off good clothes,) and Old Whiskers, Don Scipio's butler.                                                                [_Aside._  _Enter DON FERNANDO._  _Don Fer._ Pedrillo! how! seated! what means this disrespect?  _Ped._ Sir, [_Rises to him._] Old Whiskers, the butler there, asked me to sit down by Signora the waiting-maid here.  _Don Fer._ Sirrah!  _Ped._ Yes, sir.  _Don Scipio._ Sir and sirrah! how rarely they act their parts! I'll give them an item, though, that I understand the plot of their comedy.                                                                [_Aside._   AIR VIII.--QUINTETTO.  D.

What's your business here?  _Sang._ Revenge! Look--[_Shows a Stilletto._] if I meet Don Scipio--  _Don Cæsar._ A stilletto! I command you to quit your purpose.  _Sang._ What, no satisfaction for my wound last night, and lose my booty too!  _Don Cæsar._ Your wound was chance--Put up--We shall have noble booty here, and that's our business--But you seem to know your ground here, Sanguino?  _Sang._ I was formerly master of the horse to Count D'Olivi, the last resident here, so am well acquainted with the galleries, lobbies, windings, turnings, and every secret lurking place in the castle.  _Don Cæsar._ I missed Spado at the muster this morning--did he quit the cave with you?  _Spado._ [_Without._] As sure as I'm alive, it's fact, sir.--  _Don Cæsar._ Isn't that Spado's voice?  _Sang._ Impossible!  _Don Cæsar._ Hush!                                                          [_They retire._  _Enter DON SCIPIO and SPADO._  _Don Scipio._ Yes, I've heard of such places; but you say you have been in the cave where these ruffian banditti live?  _Spado._ Most certainly, sir: for, after having robbed me of five hundred doubloons, the wicked rogues barbarously stripped, and tied me neck and heels, threw me across a mule, like a sack of corn, and led me blindfold to their cursed cavern.  _Don Scipio._ Ah, poor fellow!  _Spado._ There, sir, in this sculking hole the villains live in all manner of debauchery, and dart out upon the innocent traveller, like beasts of prey.  _Don Scipio._ Oh, the tigers! just so they fastened upon me last night, but your sham Fernando, and I, made them run like hares; I gave him my purse for his trouble.  _Spado._ And he took it! what a mean fellow!--you ought not to have ventured out unarmed--I always take a blunderbuss when I go upon the road--the rascal banditti are most infernal cowards.  _Don Scipio._ What a glorious thing to deliver these reprobates into the hands of justice!  _Spado._ Ah, sir, 'twould be a blessed affair--Oh, I'd hang them up like mad dogs!  _Don Scipio._ Well, you say you know the cave?  _Spado._ Yes, yes, I slipped the handkerchief from my eyes and took a peep, made particular observations of the spot; so get a strong guard, and I'll lead you to the very trap-door of their den.  _Don Scipio._ 'Egad, then we'll surprise them, and you'll have the prayers of the whole country, my honest friend.  _Spado._ Heaven knows, sir, I have no motives for this discovery but the public good, so I expect the country will order me a hundred pistoles, as a reward for my honesty.  _Don Cæsar._ Here's a pretty dog!

[_Apart._  _Don Scipio._ An hundred pistoles!  _Spado._ Sir, have an eye upon their captain, as they call him, he's the most abandoned, impudent profligate--[_Suddenly turning sees CÆSAR, who shows a Pistol._] Captain did I say? [_Terrified._] Oh, no; the captain's a very worthy good-natured fellow--I meant a scoundrel, who thinks he ought to be captain, one Sanguino, the most daring, wicked, and bloody villain that--[_Turning the other may, perceives SANGUINO with a Pistol._] but indeed, I found Sanguino an honest, good-natured fellow too--                                                [_With increased terror._  _Don Scipio._ Hey, a bloody, wicked, honest, good-natured fellow! what is all this?  _Spado._ Yes; then, sir, I _thought_ I saw these two gentlemen, and at that instant, I _thought_ they looked so terrible, that with the fright I _awoke_.  _Don Scipio._ Awoke! what the devil then, is all this but a dream you have been telling me?  _Spado._ Ay, sir, and the most frightful dream I ever had in my life. I'm at this instant frightened out of my wits.  _Don Scipio._ You do look frightened indeed--poor man! I thought this cave was--  _Spado._ Don't mention cave, or I faint--heigho!  _Enter_ VASQUEZ.  _Vas._ Dame Isabel wants to speak with you, sir.  _Don Scipio._ I'll wait on her.  _Spado._ Yes, I'll wait on her.

Who could have thought of your finding me out here?  _Don Cæsar._ Yes, you are found out.

Didn't I hum the old fellow finely? Ha! ha! ha!  _Sang._ And for your reward, traitor, take this to your heart.                                                   [_Offers to stab him._  _Don Cæsar._ Hold, Sanguino.  _Spado._ Nay, my dear Sanguino, stay! What the devil--So here I can't run a jest upon a silly old man, but I must be run through with a stilletto!  _Don Cæsar._ Come, Spado, confess what really brought you here.  _Spado._ Business, my dear sir, business; all in our own way too, for I designed to let every man of you into the castle this very night, when all the family are in bed, and plunder's the word--Oh, such a delicious booty! pyramids of plate, bags of gold, and little chests of diamonds!  _Sang._ Indeed!  _Spado._ Sanguino, look at the closet.  _Sang._ Well!  _Spado._ A glorious prize!  _Sang._ Indeed!  _Spado._ Six chests of massy plate! Look, only look into the closet; wait here a moment, and I'll fetch a master key that shall open every one of them.  _Don Cæsar._ Hey! Let's see those chests.  _Sang._ Massy plate! Quick, quick, the master key.  _Spado._ I'll fetch it.  _Sang._ Do but make haste, Spado.  _Spado._ I will, my dear boy.

Are you there? What a pity the coming of my fellow-rogues! I should have had the whole castle to myself--Oh, what a charming seat of work for a man of my industry--[_Speaking at Closet Door._] You find the chests there--you may convey them out at night, and as for cutting Don Scipio's throat--that I leave to--  _Enter DON SCIPIO._  _Don Scipio._ Cut my throat!--What, are you at your dreams again?  _Spado._ [_Aside._] Oh, zounds!--Yes, sir, as I was telling you.  _Don Scipio._ Of a little fellow you have the worst dreams I ever heard.  _Spado._ Shocking, sir--then I thought--  _Don Scipio._ Hold, hold, let me hear no more of your curst dreams.  _Spado._ I've got off, thanks to his credulity.
