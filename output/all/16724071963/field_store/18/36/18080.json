The next report was alarming. In two weeks these leopards had carried off three score of goats, twenty bags of salt, and much ivory.  Leopards eat goats; there might conceivably be fastidious leopards that cannot eat goats without salt; but a leopard does not take ivory tusks even to pick his teeth with. So Sanders made haste to journey up the river, because little things were considerable in a country where people strain at gnats and swallow whole caravans.  \"Lord, it is true,\" said the chief of the Akasava, with some emotion, \"these goats disappear night by night, though we watch them; also the salt and ivory, because that we did not watch.\"  \"But no leopard could take these things,\" said Sanders irritably. \"These are thieves.\"  The chief's gesture was comprehensive.  \"Who could thieve?\" he said. \"The N'Gombi people live very far away; also the Isisi. The Ochori are fools, and, moreover, afraid.\"  Then Sanders remembered the egg games, and the midnight manoeuvres of the Ochori.  \"I will call on this new chief,\" he said; and crossed the river that day.  Sending a messenger to herald his coming, he waited two miles out of the city, and the councillors and wise men came out to him with offerings of fish and fruit.  \"Where is your chief?\" he asked.  \"Lord, he is ill,\" they said gravely. \"This day there came to him a feeling of sickness, and he fell down moaning. We have carried him to his hut.\"  Sanders nodded.  \"I will see him,\" he said grimly.  They led him to the door of the chief's hut, and Sanders went in. It was very dark, and in the darkest corner lay a prostrate man. Sanders bent over him, touched his pulse lightly, felt gingerly for the swelling on the neck behind the ears for a sign of sleeping sickness. No symptom could he find; but on the bare shoulder, as his fingers passed over the man's flesh, he felt a scar of singular regularity; then he found another, and traced their direction. The convict brand of the Monrovian Government was familiar to him.  \"I thought so,\" said Sanders, and gave the moaning man a vigorous kick.  \"Come out into the light, Bosambo of Monrovia,\" he said; and Bosambo rose obediently and followed the Commissioner into the light.  They stood looking at one another for several minutes; then Sanders, speaking in the dialect of the Pepper Coast, said--  \"I have a mind to hang you, Bosambo.\"  \"That is as your Excellency wishes,\" said Bosambo.  Sanders said nothing, tapping his boot with his walking-stick and gazing thoughtfully downward.  \"Having made thieves, could you make men of these people?\" he said, after a while.  \"I think they could fight now, for they are puffed with pride because they have robbed the Akasava,\" said Bosambo.  Sanders bit the end of his stick like a man in doubt.  \"There shall be neither theft nor murder,\" he said. \"No more chiefs or chiefs' sons shall die suddenly,\" he added significantly.  \"Master, it shall be as you desire.\"  \"As for the goats you have stolen, them you may keep, and the teeth (ivory) and the salt also. For if you hand them back to Akasava you will fill their stomachs with rage, and that would mean war.\"  Bosambo nodded slowly.  \"Then you shall remain, for I see you are a clever man, and the Ochori need such as you. But if----\"  \"Master, by the fat of my heart I will do as you wish,\" said Bosambo; \"for I have always desired to be a chief under the British.\"  Sanders was half-way back to headquarters before he missed his field-glasses, and wondered where he could have dropped them. At that identical moment Bosambo was exhibiting the binoculars to his admiring people.  \"From this day forth,\" said Bosambo, \"there shall be no lifting of goats nor stealing of any kind. This much I told the great Sandi, and as a sign of his love, behold, he gave me these things of magic that eat up space.\"  \"Lord,\" said a councillor in awe, \"did you know the Great One?\"  \"I have cause to know him,\" said Bosambo modestly, \"for I am his son.\"  Fortunately Sanders knew nothing of this interesting disclosure.       CHAPTER IV.    THE DROWSY ONE.   There were occasions when Sanders came up against the outer world, when he learnt, with something like bewilderment, that beyond the farthermost forests, beyond the lazy, swelling, blue sea, there were men and women who lived in houses and carefully tabooed such subjects as violent death and such horrid happenings as were daily features of his life.  He had to treat with folk who, in the main, were illogical and who believed in spirits. When you deal in the abstract with government of races so influenced, a knowledge of constitutional law and economics is fairly valueless.  There is one type of man that can rule native provinces wisely, and that type is best represented by Sanders.  There are other types, as, for instance:  Once upon a time a young man came from England with a reputation. He was sent by the Colonial Office to hold a district under Sanders as Deputy Commissioner. He was a Bachelor of Law, had read Science, and had acquired in a methodical fashion a working acquaintance with Swaheli, bacteriology, and medicines. He was a very grave young man, and the first night of his arrival he kept Sanders (furtively yawning) out of his bed whilst he demonstrated a system whereby the aboriginal could be converted--not converted spiritually, but from unproductive vagrancy to a condition of good citizenship.  Sanders said nothing beyond using the conventional expressions of polite interest, and despatched the young man and his tremendous baggage to an up-country station, with his official blessing.  Torrington--this was the grave young man's name--established himself at Entoli, and started forth to instil into the heathen mind the elementary principles of applied mechanics. In other words he taught them, through the medium of Swaheli--which they imperfectly understood--and a tin kettle, the lesson of steam. They understood the kettle part, but could not quite comprehend what meat he was cooking, and when he explained for the fortieth time that he was only cooking water, they glanced significantly one at the other and agreed that he was not quite right in his head.  They did not tell him this much to his face, for cannibals have very good manners--though their table code leaves much to be desired.  Mr. Torrington tried them with chemical experiments, showing them how sulphuric acid applied to sugar produced Su^{2}, Su^{4}, or words to that effect. He gained a reputation as a magician as a result, and in more huts than one he was regarded and worshipped as a Great and Clever Devil--which in a sense he was. But the first time he came up against the spirit of the people, his science, his law, and his cut-and-dried theories went _phutt_! And that is where Sanders came in--Sanders who had forgotten all the chemistry he ever knew, and who, as a student of Constitutional Law, was the rankest of failures.  It came about in this way.  There was a young man in Isisi who prophesied that on such a day, at such an hour, the river would rise and drown the people. When Mr. Torrington heard of this prophecy he was amused, and at first took no notice of it. But it occurred to him that here might be a splendid opportunity for revealing to the barbarian a little of that science with which he was so plentifully endowed.  So he drew a large sectional plan, showing--    (_a_) the bed of the river;   (_b_) the height of the banks;   (_c_) the maximum rise of the river;   (_d_) the height of the surrounding country; and demonstrated as           plainly as possible the utter absurdity of the prophecy.  Yet the people were unconvinced, and were preparing to abandon the village when Sanders arrived on the scene. He sent for the prophet, who was a young man of neurotic tendencies, and had a wooden prison cage built on the bank of the river, into which the youth was introduced.  \"You will stay here,\" said Sanders, \"and when the river rises you must prophesy that it will fall again, else assuredly you will be drowned.\"  Whereupon the people settled down again in their homes and waited for the river to drown the prophet and prove his words. But the river at this season of the year was steadily falling, and the prophet, like many another, was without honour in his own country.  Sanders went away; and, although somewhat discouraged, Mr. Torrington resumed his experiments. First of all, he took up sleeping sickness, and put in three months' futile work, impressing nobody save a gentleman of whom more must be written in a further chapter. Then he dropped that study suddenly and went to another.  He had ideas concerning vaccination, but the first baby he vaccinated died of croup, and Torrington came flying down the river telling Sanders a rambling story of a populace infuriated and demanding his blood. Then Torrington went home.  \"The country is now quiet,\" wrote Sanders to the Administrator, with sardonic humour. \"There are numerous palavers pending, but none of any particular moment. The Isisi people are unusually quiet, and Bosambo, the Monrovian, of whom I have written your Excellency, makes a model chief for the Ochori. No thefts have been traced to him for three months. I should be grateful if full information could be supplied to me concerning an expedition which at the moment is traversing this country under the style of the Isisi Exploitation Syndicate.\"  Curiously enough, Torrington had forgotten the fact that a member of this expedition had been one of the most interested students of his sleeping sickness clinics.  The Isisi Exploitation Syndicate, Limited, was born between the entre and the sweet at the house of a gentleman whose Christian name was Isidore, and who lived in Maida Vale. At dinner one night with a dear friend--who called himself McPherson every day of the year except on Yum Kippur, when he frankly admitted that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35545"],["title","Sanders of the River (#8)"],["body","had been born Isaacs--the question of good company titles came up, and Mr. McPherson said he had had the \"Isisi Exploitation\" in his mind for many years. With the aid of an atlas the Isisi country was discovered. It was one of those atlases on which are inscribed the staple products of the lands, and across the Isisi was writ fair \"Rubber,\" \"Kola-nut,\" \"Mahogany,\" and \"Tobacco.\"  I would ask the reader to particularly remember \"Tobacco.\"  \"There's a chief I've had some correspondence with,\" said Mr. McPherson, chewing his cigar meditatively; \"we could get a sort of concession from him. It would have to be done on the quiet, because the country is a British Protectorate. Now, if we could get a man who'd put up the stuff, and send him out to fix the concession, we'd have a company floated before you could say knife.\"  Judicious inquiry discovered the man in Claude Hyall Cuthbert, a plutocratic young gentleman, who, on the strength of once having nearly shot a lion in Uganda, was accepted by a large circle of acquaintances as an authority on Africa.  Cuthbert, who dabbled in stocks and shares, was an acquisition to any syndicate, and on the understanding that part of his duty would be the obtaining of the concession, he gladly financed the syndicate to the extent of seven thousand pounds, four thousand of which Messrs. Isidore and McPherson very kindly returned to him to cover the cost of his expedition.  The other three thousand were earmarked for office expenses.  As Mr. McPherson truly said:  \"Whatever happens, we're on velvet, my boy,\" which was perfectly true.  Before Cuthbert sailed, McPherson offered him a little advice.  \"Whatever you do,\" he said, \"steer clear of that dam' Commissioner Sanders. He's one of those pryin', interferin'----\"  \"I know the breed,\" said Cuthbert wisely. \"This is not my first visit to Africa. Did I ever tell you about the lion I shot in Uganda?\"  A week later he sailed.         *     *     *     *     *  In course of time came a strange white man through Sanders' domain. This white man, who was Cuthbert, was following the green path to death--but this he did not know. He threw his face to the forest, as the natives say, and laughed, and the people of the village of O'Tembi, standing before their wattle huts, watched him in silent wonder.  It was a wide path between huge trees, and the green of the undergrowth was flecked with sunlight, and, indeed, the green path was beautiful to the eye, being not unlike a parkland avenue.  N'Beki, chief of this village of the O'Tembi, a very good old man, went out to the path when the white man began his journey.  \"White man,\" he said solemnly, \"this is the road to hell, where all manner of devils live. Night brings remorse, and dawn brings self-hatred, which is worse than death.\"  Cuthbert, whose Swaheli was faulty, and whose Bomongo talk was nil, grinned impatiently as his coastboy translated unpicturesquely.  \"Dam nigger done say, this be bad place, no good; he say bimeby you libe for die.\"  \"Tell him to go to blazes!\" said Cuthbert noisily; \"and, look here, Flagstaff, ask him where the rubber is, see? Tell him we know all about the forest, and ask him about the elephants, where their playground is?\"  Cuthbert was broad-shouldered and heavily built, and under his broad sun-helmet his face was very hot and moist.  \"Tell the white man,\" said the chief quietly, \"there is no rubber within seven days' journey, and that we do not know ivory; elephants there were _cala cala_--but not now.\"  \"He's a liar!\" was Cuthbert's only comment. \"Get these beggars moving, Flagstaff. Hi, _alapa', avanti, trek_!\"  \"These beggars,\" a straggling line of them, resumed their loads uncomplainingly. They were good carriers, as carriers go, and only two had died since the march began.  Cuthbert stood and watched them pass, using his stick dispassionately upon the laggards. Then he turned to go.  \"Ask him,\" he said finally, \"why he calls this the road to what-d'ye-call-it?\"  The old man shook his head.  \"Because of the devils,\" he said simply.  \"Tell him he's a silly ass!\" bellowed Cuthbert and followed his carriers.  This natural path the caravan took extended in almost a straight line through the forest. It was a strange path because of its very smoothness, and the only drawback lay in the fact that it seemed to be the breeding-place of flies--little black flies, as big as the house-fly of familiar shape, if anything a little bigger.  They terrified the natives for many reasons, but principally because they stung. They did not terrify Cuthbert, because he was dressed in tapai cloth; none the less, there were times when these black flies found joints in his armour and roused him to anger. This path extended ten miles and made pleasant travelling. Then the explorer struck off into the forest, following another path, well beaten, but more difficult.  By devious routes Mr. Cuthbert came into the heart of Sanders' territories, and he was successful in this, that he avoided Sanders. He had with him a caravan of sixty men and an interpreter, and in due course he reached his objective, which was the village of a great chief ruling a remarkable province--Bosambo, of the Ochori, no less; sometime Krooman, steward of the Elder Dempster line, chief on sufferance, but none the less an interesting person. Bosambo, you may be sure, came out to greet his visitor.  \"Say to him,\" said Cuthbert to his interpreter, \"that I am proud to meet the great chief.\"  \"Lord chief,\" said the interpreter in the vernacular, \"this white man is a fool, and has much money.\"  \"So I see,\" said Bosambo.  \"Tell him,\" said Cuthbert, with all the dignity of an ambassador, \"that I have come to bring him wonderful presents.\"  \"The white man says,\" said the interpreter, \"that if he is sure you are a good man he will give you presents. Now,\" said the interpreter carefully, \"as I am the only man who can speak for you, let us make arrangements. You shall give me one-third of all he offers. Then will I persuade him to continue giving, since he is the father of mad people.\"  \"And you,\" said Bosambo briefly, \"are the father of liars.\"  He made a sign to his guard, and they seized upon the unfortunate interpreter and led him forth. Cuthbert, in a sweat of fear, pulled a revolver.  \"Master,\" said Bosambo loftily, \"you no make um fuss. Dis dam' nigger, he no good; he make you speak bad t'ings. I speak um English proper. You sit down, we talk um.\"  So Cuthbert sat down in the village of Ochori, and for three days there was a great giving of presents, and signing of concessions. Bosambo conceded the Ochori country--that was a small thing. He granted forest rights of the Isisi, he sold the Akasava, he bartered away the Lulungo territories and the \"native products thereof\"--I quote from the written document now preserved at the Colonial Office and bearing the scrawled signature of Bosambo--and he added, as a lordly afterthought, the Ikeli district.  \"What about river rights?\" asked the delighted Cuthbert.  \"What will you give um?\" demanded Bosambo cautiously.  \"Forty English pounds?\" suggested Cuthbert.  \"I take um,\" said Bosambo.  It was a remarkably simple business; a more knowledgeable man than Cuthbert would have been scared by the easiness of his success, but Cuthbert was too satisfied with himself to be scared at anything.  It is said that his leave-taking with Bosambo was of an affecting character, that Bosambo wept and embraced his benefactor's feet.  Be that as it may, his \"concessions\" in his pocket, Cuthbert began his coastward journey, still avoiding Sanders.  He came to Etebi and found a deputy-commissioner, who received him with open arms. Here Cuthbert stayed a week.  Mr. Torrington at the time was tremendously busy with a scheme for stamping out sleeping sickness. Until then, Cuthbert was under the impression that it was a pleasant disease, the principal symptom of which was a painless coma. Fascinated, he extended his stay to a fortnight, seeing many dreadful sights, for Torrington had established a sort of amateur clinic, and a hundred cases a day came to him for treatment.  \"And it comes from the bite of a tsetse fly?\" said Cuthbert. \"Show me a tsetse.\"  Torrington obliged him, and when the other saw the little black insect he went white to the lips.  \"My God!\" he whispered, \"I've been bitten by that!\"  \"It doesn't follow----\" began Torrington; but Cuthbert was blundering and stumbling in wild fear to his carriers' camp.  \"Get your loads!\" he yelled. \"Out of this cursed country we get as quick as we can!\"  Torrington, with philosophical calm, endeavoured to reassure him, but he was not to be appeased.  He left Etebi that night and camped in the forest. Three days later he reached a mission station, where he complained of headaches and pains in the neck (he had not attended Torrington's clinics in vain). The missionary, judging from the man's haggard appearance and general incoherence that he had an attack of malaria, advised him to rest for a few days; but Cuthbert was all a-fret to reach the coast. Twenty miles from the mission, Cuthbert sent his carriers back, and said he would cover the last hundred miles of the journey alone.  To this extraordinary proposition the natives agree--from that day Cuthbert disappeared from the sight of man.         *     *     *     *     *  Sanders was taking a short cut through the forest to avoid the interminable twists and bends of the river, when he came suddenly upon a village of death--four sad little huts, built hastily amidst a tangle of underwood. He called, but nobody answered him. He was too wary to enter any of the crazy habitations.  He knew these little villages in the forest. It was the native custom to take the aged and the dying--especially those who died sleepily--to far-away places, beyond the reach of man, and leave them there with a week's food and a fire, to die in decent solitude.  He called again, but only the forest answered him. The"]]]
