At this time it was generally assumed that Mars was a miniature of our own world. The brighter districts of its surface were supposed to be continents, the darker, seas. As Sir William Herschel had already pointed out long before, the little world evidently had its seasons, its axis being inclined to the plane of its orbit at much the same angle as is the case with the Earth; it had its polar caps, presumably of ice and snow; its day was but very little longer than that of the Earth; and the only important difference seemed to be that it had a longer year, and was a little further off the Sun. But the general conclusion was that it was so like the Earth in its conditions that we had practically found out all that there was to know; all that seemed to be reserved for future research was that a few minor details of the surface might be filled in as the power of our telescopes was increased.  But fortunately for progress, this sense of satisfaction was to be rudely disturbed. As Mars, in its progress round the Sun, receded from the Earth, or rather as the Earth moved away from it, the astronomers who observed so diligently during the autumn of 1877 turned their attention to other objects. One of them, however, Schiaparelli, the most distinguished astronomer on the continent of Europe, still continued to watch the planet, and, as the result of his labours, he published some months later the first of a magnificent series of _Memoirs_, bringing to light what appeared to be a new feature. His drawings not only showed the \"lands\" and \"seas,\" that is to say the bright and dark areas, that Green and his predecessors had drawn, but also a number of fine, narrow, dark lines crossing the \"lands\" in every direction. These narrow lines are the markings which have since been so celebrated as the \"canals of Mars,\" and the discussion as to the real nature of these canals has focussed attention upon Mars in a way that, perhaps, nothing else could have done. Before 1877 the study of planetary markings was left almost entirely to the desultory labours of amateurs, skilled though many of them were; since 1877, the most powerful telescopes of the great public observatories of the world have been turned upon Mars, and the most skilful and experienced of professional astronomers have not been ashamed to devote their time to it.  There is no need to pass in review the whole of the immense mass of observations that have been accumulated since Schiaparelli brought out the first of his great Memoirs. That Memoir gave rise to an immediate controversy, for many astronomers of skill and experience had observed the planet in 1877 without detecting the network of lines which Schiaparelli had revealed, and it was natural that they should feel some reluctance in accepting results so strange and novel. But little by little this controversy has passed. We now know that the \"canals\" vary much in their visibility, and \"curiously enough the canals are most conspicuous, not at the time the planet is nearest to the Earth and its general features are in consequence best seen, but as the planet goes away the canals come out. The fact is that the orbital position and the seasonal epoch conspire to a masking of the phenomena.\" This was the chief reason why Schiaparelli's discoveries seemed at first to stand so entirely without corroboration; the \"canals\" did not become conspicuous until after most observers had desisted from following the planet. Another reason was that, in 1877, Mars was low down in the sky for northern observatories, and good definition is an essential for their recognition. But the careful examination of drawings made in earlier oppositions, especially those made by Dawes and Green, afforded confirmation of not a few of Schiaparelli's \"canals\"; even in 1877 a few of the easiest and most conspicuous had been delineated by other astronomers before any rumour of Schiaparelli's work had come abroad, and as Mars came under observation again and again at successive oppositions, the number of those who were able to verify Schiaparelli's discoveries increased. It has now long been known that the great Italian astronomer was not the victim of a mere optical illusion; there were actual markings on the planet Mars where he had represented them; markings which, when seen under like conditions and with equal instrumental equipment, did present the appearance of straight, narrow lines. The \"canals of Mars\" are not mere figments of the imagination, but have a real objective basis.  As this controversy has passed away, another and a very different one has arisen out of an unfortunate mistranslation of the term chosen by Schiaparelli to indicate these linear streaks. In conformity with the type of nomenclature adopted by previous areographers who had divided Mars into \"seas,\" \"continents,\" \"islands,\" \"isthmuses,\" \"straits\" and the like, Schiaparelli had called the narrow lines he detected \"_canali_\", that is to say \"channels,\" but without intending to convey the idea of artificial construction. Indeed, he himself was careful to point out that these designations \"were not intended to prejudge the nature of the spot, and were nothing but an artifice for helping the memory and for shortening descriptions.\" And he added, \"We speak in the same way of the lunar seas, although we well know that there are no true seas on the Moon.\" But \"_canali_\" was unhappily rendered in English as \"canals,\" instead of \"channels.\" \"Channel\" would have left the nature of the marking an open question, but, in English, \"canal\" means an artificial waterway. Here then the question as to whether or no Mars is inhabited comes definitely before us. Have we sufficient grounds for believing that the \"canals\" are artificial constructions, or may they be merely natural formations?  In 1894, Mr. Percival Lowell founded at Flagstaff, Arizona, U.S.A., a well-equipped observatory for the special study of Mars, and he has continued his scrutiny of the planet from that time to the present with the most unrelaxing perseverance. The chief results that he has obtained have been the detection of many new \"canals\"; the discovery of a number of dark, round dots, termed by him \"oases,\" at the junctions of the \"canals\"; and the demonstration that the \"canals\" and certain of the dusky regions are subject to strictly seasonal change, as really as the polar caps themselves. In addition, he has formed the conclusion, which he has supported with much ingenuity and skill, that the regularity of the \"canals\" and \"oases\" quite precludes the possibility of their being natural formations. Hence there has arisen the second controversy: that on the nature of the \"canals\"; for Mr. Lowell considers that their presence proves the existence of inhabitants on Mars, who, by means of a Titanic system of irrigation, are fighting a losing battle against the gradual desiccation of their planet.  In a paper published in the _International Scientific Review_, \"Scientia,\" in January, 1910, Mr. Lowell gave a summary of his argument.      \"Organic life needs water for its existence. This water we see exists     on Mars, but in very scant amount, so that if life of any sort exists     there, it must be chiefly dependent on the semi-annual unlocking of     the polar snows for its supply, inasmuch as there are no surface     bodies of it over the rest of the planet. Now the last few years,     beginning with Schiaparelli in 1877, and much extended since at     Flagstaff, have shown:      \"The surface of the planet to be very curiously meshed by a fine     network of lines and spots.      \"Now if one considers first the appearance of this network of lines     and spots, and then its regular behaviour, he will note that its     geometrism precludes its causation on such a scale by any natural     process and, on the other hand, that such is precisely the aspect     which an artificial irrigating system, dependent upon the melting of     the polar snows, would assume. Since water is only to be had at the     time it is there unlocked, and since for any organic life it must be     got, it would be by tapping the disintegrated cap, and only so, that     it could be obtained. If Mars be inhabited, therefore, it is precisely     such a curious system we should expect to see, and only by such     explanation does it seem possible to account for the facts.      \"These lines are the so-called canals of Mars. It is not supposed that     what we see is the conduit itself. On the contrary, the behaviour of     these lines indicates that what we are looking at is vegetation. Now,     vegetation can only be induced by a water-supply. What we see     resembles the yearly inundation of the Nile, of which to a spectator     in space the river itself might be too narrow to be seen, and only the     verdured country on its banks be visible. This is what we suppose to     be the case with Mars. However the water be conducted, whether in     covered conduits, which seems probable, or not, science is not able to     state, but the effects of it are so palpable and so exactly in accord     with what such a system of irrigation would show, that we are     compelled to believe that such is indeed its _vera causa_.\"  Beside the bulky _Memoirs_ in which Prof. Lowell has published the scientific results obtained at his observatory at Flagstaff, and papers and articles appearing in various scientific journals, he has brought out three books of a more popular character: \"_Mars_\"; \"_Mars and its Canals_\"; and \"_Mars as the Abode of Life_.\" In these he shows that to the assiduity of the astronomer he adds the missionary's zeal and eagerness for converts as he pleads most skilfully for the acceptance of his chosen doctrine of the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/35968"],["title","A Check-List of the Birds of Idaho (#0)"],["body","Online Distributed Proofreading Team at https://www.pgdp.net          A Check-List of the Birds of Idaho  BY  M.

DALE ARVEY   There is comparatively little literature dealing with the avifauna of Idaho, mostly because relatively few persons have done field work in the state. In the ornithological literature, there is nothing even comparable to a \"state list,\" so that when birds supposedly unreported previously from Idaho are found, it is difficult to know whether or not they should be recorded as \"new\" to the state. The present paper has been prepared in the hope that it will stimulate additions to, and corrections of, the list. It is, admittedly, a beginning.  Material for the present article was obtained from personal collecting in the five years and ten months in which I resided in the state (October, 1938-September, 1944). Also, the published reports that could be found have been drawn upon; these publications are listed in the appended bibliography. Taxonomic problems, of which many are unsolved, are not here considered, since this is merely a list indicating whether or not the species or subspecies, as now understood, is known to be present, whether it is common, and where it might be found.  The nomenclature is that of the Fourth Edition of the American Ornithologists' Union Check-list and its supplements, except where a revision has been made that is seemingly valid but which has not yet been acted upon by the A. O. U. Committee. For each species or subspecies the objective is to give at least one reference to occurrence, as to date and place, as accurately as possible.  Reference is made to southern, central, and northern Idaho. These references denote the Snake River Plains, characterized by sagebrush desert; the wooded regions immediately to the north of this and in the foothills, extending to Idaho County in the west; and the so-called Panhandle, respectively. In all, 292 kinds of birds are recorded in the following list.     LIST OF SPECIES   _Gavia immer elasson_ Bishop. Lesser Loon.
