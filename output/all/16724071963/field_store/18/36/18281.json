The seamen affected to ignore them. Once Unter-leutnant Kaspar Klick passed, and gave them such a look that O'Hara afterwards remarked he would like to have a quiet five minutes with the German.  \"I wonder they haven't searched us,\" said Stirling in a low voice. \"Now I wish I had put my small revolver into my coat pocket.  I thought it would have been too risky.\"  \"For the same reason I practically emptied my pockets before we left the _Nichi Maru_,\" declared Denbigh.  \"And so did I,\" added O'Hara, \"but I took jolly good care to hide that little automatic pistol--you know the one: I collared it from a German officer in that little scrap at Herbertsh√∂he.\"  \"For goodness sake be careful,\" protested the cautious and level-headed Scot.  \"I'll try to be,\" replied O'Hara non-committedly.  \"Where is the pistol?\" asked Denbigh.  \"Inside the lining of my cap,\" replied the Irishman.  \"Can you see any sign of a bulge under the cap-cover?\"  \"Not a trace,\" declared Denbigh.  \"Only, old man, remember you are rather hot-headed.  Let's hope there won't be a premature explosion.\"  \"There won't,\" said O'Hara emphatically.  \"Because I've no cartridges.\"  \"That's something to be thankful for,\" remarked Stirling.  \"But what, might I ask, is the use of an automatic pistol, if you haven't any cartridges?\"  \"You never know your luck,\" replied O'Hara.  \"I may manage to pick up some on board.  Whist!\"  Von Langer, the fat ober-leutnant who had been in charge of the boarding-party, was approaching.  Possibly at a hint from his chief he had dropped his overbearing manner, for he addressed the prisoners in a mild tone.  \"It is nearly sunset,\" he remarked.  \"You vos go below.  I am sorry to tell you dis, but dese are orders.  Wir mussen vorsichtig zu Werke gehen.\"  Denbigh gave no sign that he understood.  Von Langer had hoped to trip the Englishman, but he had failed.  \"What was that Johnny spouting about?\" asked Stirling, when the three chums had retired to the cabin.  \"That they had to be very careful,\" replied Denbigh.  \"That I don't doubt.  I'll give them a week at the very outside.  If we are not free men then, I reckon we're booked to Davy Jones his locker.\"  The cabin was plainly furnished.  An electric light was burning, but the porthole had been previously closed and locked.  Overhead an electric fan was buzzing, while fresh air was admitted by means of ventilation pipes communicating with the open air.  \"We might do worse,\" remarked O'Hara as he proceeded to undress.  \"The rotten part of it is, we can't see what's going on outside.  The beggars have cooped us up pretty well.\"  \"They are evidently busy,\" said Stirling, as the bustling of some hundreds of men was plainly audible above the hum of the fan.  \"Perhaps they do the worst of their dirty work during the hours of darkness.\"  The three officers proceeded to make an examination of their quarters. The walls were of pitch-pine, but upon O'Hara sacrificing one of his razors, it was found that the woodwork merely formed a casing to a thin steel bulkhead.  The ceiling, too, was of steel, coated with a patent cement to preserve the metal and to prevent \"sweating\".  The door was of steel, and was fitted with a \"jalousie\" or latticed shutter; but their captors had taken the precaution of bolting a solid metal plate over the opening.  \"Not much chance for anyone who happens to be a somnambulist,\" said Denbigh.  \"Well, it's no use kicking against the pricks when you're barefooted.  I'm going to turn in.  By Jove, I do feel horribly sleepy.\"  \"And so do I,\" added Stirling, unable to stifle a terrific yawn.  \"I believe I'm asleep already,\" muttered O'Hara drowsily.  A moment later the three chums were lost in oblivion.  An opiate secretly administered by the doctor had been mixed with their food.  So soundly did they sleep that they were unaware of a terrific crash that took place during the middle watch--the explosion of a torpedo launched from the supposed Dutch liner at a large French vessel.  Von Riesser had risked an example of frightfulness.  The huge, heavily-charged missile--powerful enough to sink the largest battleship afloat within a couple of hours from the moment of impact--had literally torn to pieces the lightly-built hull of its victim.  Before the luckless passengers and crew rushed for the boats--and these were for the most part shattered--the French craft sunk like a stone.  It was not until the sun was almost overhead that Pat O'Hara awoke. The deadlight of the porthole had been unshipped and the cabin was flooded with dazzling sunlight.  He sat up in his bunk.  His head seemed to be splitting.  Everything in view was slowly moving to and fro with a semicircular motion.  \"What the deuce have I been up to?\" he soliloquized.  \"Where was I last night?  By Jove, I must have had another touch of that rotten malaria.\"  Presently the erratic movements of his surroundings quieted down.  He became aware that Denbigh and Stirling, lying in their bunks on the other side of the cabin, were still sleeping and breathing stertorously.  \"Now how in the name of goodness did those fellows get into my cabin?\" asked the puzzled Irishman, for he was under the impression that he was on board the _Nichi Maru_.  \"Has someone been having a rag?\"  From the alley-way came the sound of voices.  He listened.  The speakers were making use of a foreign language.  It was not the soft, pleasing Japanese tongue--something harsh and guttural.  \"German!\" ejaculated O'Hara.  \"By my blessed namesake I remember it all now.\"  He leapt from his bunk and, crossing the cabin, shook Denbigh by the shoulders.  The Sub's only reply was a grunt of semi-conscious expostulation.  O'Hara turned his attentions to the Scot.  \"Fore!\" muttered Stirling, engrossed in the joys of a round of golf in dreamland.  \"More like twelve, be jabbers,\" retorted O'Hara.  \"The sun's well over the fore-yard.  Show a leg and shine, you lazy bounder.\"  The discipline imbued in the old Dartmouth College was too strong to resist the nautical invitation to get up.  Stirling rolled from his bunk--fortunately it was the underneath one--and subsided heavily upon the floor.  \"Pull yourself together, man,\" counselled O'Hara.  \"Those rotten Huns have been hocussing our grub.\"  \"If they have, they have,\" muttered the imperturbable Stirling. \"That's no reason why you should bellow into my ear like a ninety-thousand horse-power siren.\"  Leaving the Sub huddled upon the floor O'Hara proceeded to dress.  Suddenly he exclaimed:  \"The dirty spalpeens!  They've been to my pockets while I was asleep.\"  This announcement literally electrified his companion, for Stirling remembered that he had over twenty pounds in Australian sovereigns in his purse.  Alas!  The gold had vanished.  \"Your pistol?\" asked Stirling.  The Irishman whipped his uniform cap from a hat-peg.  \"It's there,\" he reported.  \"And might you be wanting it to let daylight into the fellow who collared your cash?\"  \"Not much use without cartridges,\" replied Stirling savagely.  \"It might have got us into hot water if they had found it.  Better pitch it through the port-hole, old man, before it lands you in queer street.\"  \"No fear,\" declared O'Hara.  \"It may come in handy some day.\"  Some time elapsed before the two men were able to rouse Denbigh from his stupor.  He, too, discovered that a small amount of gold that he happened to have on him at the time of the capture of the _Nichi Maru_ had been taken from him.  Some silver and a few Japanese coins had been left.  \"We've been drugged right enough,\" said Denbigh.  \"I wonder why? There's some underhand game afoot during the hours of darkness. To-night we'll do without wine at dinner, and see how that acts.\"  Having completed their toilet the three Subs left the cabin, for the door was now unlocked and the metal covering to the jalousie removed. Without stood a seaman on sentry duty.  He drew himself up stiffly as the British officers passed, but made no salute, nor did he attempt to bar their progress.  At the foot of the companion-ladder a petty-officer stopped them.  \"Breakfast awaits you in this cabin,\" he said in German.  Neither Stirling nor O'Hara understood, while Denbigh was sufficiently on his guard to feign ignorance of the nature of the announcement.  \"Der vos a meal for you in dere,\" announced von Langer, stepping from behind the shaft of a ventilator.  \"Thank you!\" replied the three Subs in unison.  \"But it's nearly lunch time, isn't it?\" added O'Hara.  \"Dey vos tell me der Englische are very fond of sleep,\" retorted von Langer with a laugh.  \"Himmel!  I tink dot is very true.\"  The meal over, the prisoners went on deck.  Out of curiosity Denbigh walked to the rail and leant over the side.  He was not surprised at what he saw.  The ship's sides had been painted during the night.  The black band still remained, but the yellow paint had been replaced with a coat of blue.  Already the tropical sun was blistering the still wet paint, revealing patches of the original hue underneath.  The funnels, too, had been redecorated.  They were now red with black tops.  Some minutes later Kapitan von Riesser descended from the bridge and walked aft.  Seeing the British officer he crossed the deck.  \"You like our new colour scheme?\" he asked.  Denbigh did not reply to the question.  He asked another.  \"Mr. Stirling and I both lost some gold during the night.  Our cabin was entered while we were asleep and the money taken from our pockets. Was the--er--theft committed at your instigation?\"  For a moment von Riesser hesitated.  \"There was no theft,\" he replied.  \"The gold was taken from you prisoners----\"  \"Contrary to----\" began Stirling hotly.  \"In accordance with my instructions,\" continued the Kapitan.  \"Gold is of no use to you.  Instead, you will be furnished with Notes to its equivalent as soon as we arrive.\"  \"You may as well get your purser to write out a receipt,\" said O'Hara. \"It will come in handy "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/36499"],["title","Rounding up the Raider: A Naval Story of the Great War (#4)"],["body","the _Zwaan_--if that's her proper name--is captured.\"  Von Riesser laughed boisterously.  \"Captured?\" he repeated.  \"Ach!  I don't think there is much danger now.  South of the Line there is not a solitary British cruiser that can touch us in speed.  There are plenty of them, I admit, but that is your English all over.  Three swift vessels would be worth all your East India fleet put together, yet you pack highly-trained crews into slow and out-of-date tubs.\"  \"Possibly the captain of the _Emden_ thought the same as you do,\" remarked Stirling.  \"M√ºller had difficulties that I have not,\" replied von Riesser.  \"He was known to be in the Indian Ocean and swift cruisers were dispatched from England and Australia to hunt for him.  Our presence on the High Seas will not be known to your Admiralty until it is too late.  So, gentlemen, I must ask you to seriously consider the possibility of finding yourselves prisoners of war in our well-defended Colony of German East Africa.\"     CHAPTER IV  Threatened  That night, according to their pre-arranged plans, the captive sub-lieutenants avoided taking any of the wines that were placed before them.  They dined alone in a small cabin placed at least fifty feet from their sleeping quarters.  As it was now after sunset the porthole was closed and locked.  The door, too, was shut, but not secured.  Outside, a sentry paced to and fro.  \"Look here, you fellows!\" exclaimed Denbigh after the man deputed to attend to their needs had gone.  \"It's all very well knocking off the fizz, but they'll notice we haven't drunk any.\"  \"Pour it into the grate,\" suggested Pat O'Hara recklessly.  Denbigh shook his head.  \"Won't do,\" he objected, giving a glance in the direction of the small \"bogie\" stove.  \"I suppose there isn't any possibility of prizing open the port-lid?\"  \"You'd be spotted even if you could.  There are plenty of men on deck,\" said O'Hara, glad of the opportunity of countering Denbigh's objection with another.  \"Come along, old bird; what do you suggest?\"  Stirling, to whom the invitation was addressed, thrust his hand into the breast pocket of his coat.  \"What would you do if I weren't here to look after you?\" he enquired, at the same time producing three sponges.  \"I took them from our cabin.\"  \"For dessert?\" queried O'Hara, lifting his eyebrows in surprise.  \"Yes, if you are a goat,\" said Stirling with asperity.  \"Goats are, I believe, rather partial to this sort of tack.\"  Coolly the Scot poured out a wineglassful of sherry--it was from the same decanter that they had taken some the previous evening--and slowly spilt the liquid on the sponge.  \"Fill your glass first,\" cautioned Stirling.  \"Then they'll think we have had some of the poisonous stuff.  Slip your sponge into your pocket, Denbigh.  Don't squeeze it.  I am presuming you'll want it again later.  Of course if Pat wishes, he can chew his.\"  Dinner over, the chums retired to their sleeping cabin.  In fact they had no option, since they were forbidden to go on deck after sunset. Here they talked and looked at the illustrations of some old Spanish newspapers until lights out; then, turning in, they lay awake awaiting possible developments.  Eight bells struck.  The _Pelikan_ was no longer moving through the water.  Outside the cabin men were talking. Springing from his bunk Denbigh approached the door, putting his ear to the covered jalousie.  \"I suppose those English swine are sound asleep,\" said a voice which the sub recognized as that of Kapitan von Riesser.  \"I cannot hear them grunting--we did last night.\"  \"Nor can I, sir,\" replied Unter-leutnant Klick, who as officer of the watch was accompanying the captain on his rounds.  \"But they must be. They went for that doctored sherry like fishes.\"  \"Himmel!  That is good news,\" exclaimed von Riesser.  \"It will be quite safe to settle that vessel.  When she first answered our call she was only forty kilometres away.  In twenty minutes----\"  The listener fancied he could hear the kapitan rubbing his hands with glee.  \"It is much the better way,\" continued von Riesser: \"'Lost with all hands' is quite a plausible theory.  I am almost sorry we didn't wait until night when we tackled the Japanese ship.  We run a good risk of being made a quarry for a dozen or more of those accursed cruisers. Those English may even send some swift destroyers on our track.  You are sure those fellows are quite insensible?\"  \"As quiet as the grave, sir,\" assured the unter-leutnant.  \"They will hear nothing.  Even that terrific explosion when our torpedo took the Frenchman by surprise never disturbed them.  But, of course, sir, I'll make doubly sure.  We'll squirt some chloroform into the cabin.\"  \"Then be sharp about it,\" said von Riesser.  \"There's no time to be lost.  That English vessel ought to be in sight within the next quarter of an hour.\"  The German officer moved away.  In a trice Denbigh communicated the news to his companions.  \"Oh for a respirator!\" whispered O'Hara.  \"Don't worry,\" said Stirling.  \"The electric fan will carry off the fumes as quickly as they pump them in.\"  Even as he spoke the fan ceased to revolve.  The current actuating the ventilating gear had been switched off.  Already Unter-leutnant Klick was putting his scheme into effect.  \"Those voice tubes,\" hissed Denbigh.  \"They lead nowhere,\" protested Stirling.  \"They are blocked.  I tried them some time ago.\"  The cabin had previously been used as the purser's office, and from it voice-tubes had communicated with the captain's cabin, the head steward's quarters, and the clerk's office.  The metal pipes had been removed, but three lengths of flexible tubing had been left.  With a sharp tug Denbigh wrenched one of the tubes from the flange securing it to the bulkhead.  The second gave more trouble.  As he was straining at it a sharp rasping sound fell upon his ear.  In the adjoining cabin someone was at work drilling a hole through the metal partition.  Smearing the bell-shaped mouth-pieces of two of the detached pipes with soap from the wash-basin, Denbigh clapped them together.  \"Hold on here, Pat,\" he whispered.  \"Press 'em tightly.\"  O'Hara obeyed unhesitatingly.  Instinctively he realized that this was Denbigh's pigeon, and once Denbigh undertook a task he was pretty certain of the result.  Stirling was then told to hold one end of the second and third sections.  The united length of tubing was now nearly nine feet.  One end Denbigh wedged into the opening in the ceiling for the electric fan.  The other he held in his hand in readiness.  At length, after a tedious wait, Denbigh saw the tip of the drill emerging from the bulkhead.  Marking the spot he instantly switched off the light.  A dull thud announced that the boring tool had made a complete perforation and that the handle had struck home against the steelwork.  The drill was withdrawn.  In its place a small metal tube was inserted. Deftly and noiselessly Denbigh slipped the lower end of the flexible piping over the projecting nozzle.  Then he waited.  He could hear the Irishman breathing heavily.  The portion of the tube that he was holding quivered in his excitable grasp.  Stirling, cool and collected, gave no sign of the potential alertness that possessed him.  A gentle hissing sound, repeated at short intervals, announced that the Germans were injecting the stupefying fumes by means of a bellows.  A faint, sickly odour assailed Denbigh's nostrils.  He had to fight hard to refrain from gasping.  Grimly he stood by until the hissing noise ceased.  His plan had been successful.  Save for a slight leakage the fumes had travelled through the pipe and had been carried through the louvres of the ventilator, while the hot air of the cabin was sufficient to create an up-draught to disperse the noxious vapour.  Denbigh removed his end of the tube.  As he did so he heard a voice exclaim:  \"It is enough.  More will kill them.  You had better enter the cabin, Herr Doktor, and see that they are still breathing.\"  The sub drew the piping from his companions' grasp.  \"Turn in and pretend you're insensible,\" he whispered, fearful lest the sound should be heard through the newly-made hole in the bulkhead.  It was less than five minutes later when the door was unlocked and a dim figure cautiously entered.  \"Not half so bad as I expected,\" said a guttural voice.  The smell of the an√¶sthetic had almost dispersed.  \"Where is the switch?\"  \"Here, Herr Doktor,\" replied a petty officer.  The next instant the cabin was bathed in brilliant light.  In spite of their efforts to the contrary the three supposed sleepers twitched their eyelids.  The ship's surgeon bent over O'Hara.  A short scrutiny confirmed his suspicions.  He turned to the bunk on which Stirling was lying, and, lifting the sub's eyelid, placed the tip of his forefinger upon the eyeball.  \"Ach, is it so?\" ejaculated the German, for Stirling had been compelled to contract his eyelids.  A similar test bore the same result in Denbigh's case; then, without another word, the doctor hurried from the cabin.  \"The old pillbox has tumbled to it,\" muttered Denbigh.  \"Now what will their little game be?\"  The sub was not left long in doubt.  Ober-leutnant von Langer, who had followed the doctor into the cabin, made his presence known by bawling out an order to half a dozen of the crew who were waiting without:  \"Come!  Out mit you!\" he exclaimed, addressing the sham sleepers.  \"It is that I know your little pretend.  Ach! you tink you smart?\"  Yet Denbigh and his companions kept still, half-hoping that the doctor's test had not been successful and von Langer was trying his hand.  The ober-leutnant gave another order.  Unceremoniously the three British officers were hauled out of the bunks by the seamen, who seemed to take a delight in roughly handling anyone of commissioned rank. Perhaps, if von Langer did but know it, his men would have been only too pleased to use him in the same way, for the ober-leutnant was a"]]]
