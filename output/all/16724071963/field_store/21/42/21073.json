There were enough men and horses and lines, however, so that the crossing was made without loss.  Then, turning three-quarters of a circle, the cavalcade made slow way back down the river, along its north bank, toward the forbidding gorge of the Low Umpasseurs.  The north bank was different, vastly different, from the south one. Mountains of bare rock, incredible thousands of feet higher than the plateau forming the south bank, towered at the rushing torrent's very edge. What passed for a road was narrow, steep, full of hair-pin turns, and fearfully rugged. But this, too, was passed--by dint of what labor and stress it is not necessary to dwell upon--and as the army debouched out onto the sparsely-wooded, gullied and eroded terrain of the high barren valley and began to make camp for the night. Tedric became deeply concerned. Sciro's small force would have left no obvious or lasting traces of its passing; but such blatant disfigurements as these....  He glanced at the king, then stared back at the broad, trampled, deep-rutted way the army had come. \"South of the river our tracks do not matter,\" he said, flatly. \"In the gorge they exist not. But _those_ traces, sire, matter greatly and are not to be covered or concealed.\"  \"Tedric, I approve of you--you begin to think!\" Much to the young man's surprise, Phagon smiled broadly. \"How wouldst handle the thing, if decision yours?\"  \"A couple of fives of bowmen to camp here or nearby, sire,\" Tedric replied promptly, \"to put arrows through any who come to spy.\"  \"'Tis a sound idea, but not enough by half. Here I leave _you_; and a full century each of our best scouts and hunters. See to it, my lord captain, that none sees this our trail from here to the Lake of the Spiders; or, having seen it, lives to tell of the seeing.\"  Tedric, after selecting his sharp-shooters and watching them melt invisibly into the landscape, went down the valley about a mile and hid himself carefully in a cave. These men knew the business in hand a lot better than he did, and he would not interfere. What he was for was to take command in an emergency; if the operation were a complete success he would have nothing whatever to do!  He was still in the cave, days later, when word came that the launching had begun. Rounding up his guerillas, he led them at a fast pace to the Lake of the Spiders, around it, and to the place where the Lomarrian army had been encamped. Four fifty-man rafts were waiting, and Tedric noticed with surprise that a sort of house had been built on the one lying farthest down-stream. This luxury, he learned, was for him and his squire Rahlion and their horses and armor!  The Middle Branch was wide and swift; and to Tedric and his bowmen, landlubbers all, it was terrifyingly rough and boisterous and full of rocks. Tedric, however, did not stay a landlubber long. He was not the type to sit in idleness when there was something physical to do, something new to learn. And learning to be a riverman was so much easier than learning to be King Phagon's idea of a strategist!  Thus, stripped to clout and moccasins, Tedric reveled in pitting his strength and speed at steering-oar or pole against the raft's mass and the river's whim.  \"A good man, him,\" the boss boatman remarked to one of his mates. Then, later, to Tedric himself: \"'Tis shame, lord, that you got to work at this lord business. Wouldst make a damn good riverman in time.\"  \"My thanks, sir, and 'twould be more fun, but King Phagon knows best. But this 'Bend' you talk of--what is it?\"  \"'Tis where this Middle Branch turns a square angle 'gainst solid rock to flow west into the Sarlo; the roughest, wickedest bit of water anybody ever tried to run a raft over. Canst try it with me if you like.\"  \"'Twould please me greatly to try.\"  Well short of the Bend, each raft was snubbed to the shore and unloaded. When the first one was bare, the boss riverman and a score of his best men stepped aboard. So did Tedric.  \"What folly this?\" Phagon yelled. \"Tedric, ashore!\"  \"Canst swim, Lord Tedric?\" the boss asked.  \"Like an eel,\" Tedric admitted modestly, and the riverman turned to the king.  \"'Twill save you rafts, sire, if he works with us. He's quick as a cat and strong as a bull, and knows more of white water already than half my men.\"  \"In that case ...\" Phagon waved his hand and the first raft took off.  Many of the rafts were lost, of course; and Tedric had to swim in icy water more than once, but he loved every exhausting, exciting second of the time. Nor were the broken logs of the wrecked rafts allowed to drift down the river as tell-tales. Each bit was hauled carefully ashore.  Below the Bend, the Middle Branch was wide and deep, hence the reloaded rafts had smooth sailing; and the Sarlo itself was of course wider and deeper still. In fact, it would have been easily navigable by an 80,000-ton modern liner. The only care now was to avoid discovery--which matter was attended to by several centuries of far-ranging scouts and by scores of rivermen in commandeered boats.  Moyla's Landing, the predetermined point of debarkation, was a scant fifteen miles from the city of Sarlo. It was scarcely a hamlet, but even so any one of its few inhabitants could have given the alarm. Hence it was surrounded by an advance force of bowmen and spearmen, and before those soldiers set out Phagon voiced the orders he was to repeat so often during the following hectic days.  \"NO BURNING AND NO WANTON KILLING! None must know we come, but nonetheless Sarlon is to be a province of Lomarr my kingdom and _I will not have its people or its substance destroyed_! To that end I swear by my royal head, by the Throne, by Great Llosir's heart and brain and liver, that any man of whatever rank who slays or burns without my express permission will be flayed alive and then boiled in oil!\"  Hence the taking of Moyla's Landing was very quiet, and its people were held under close guard. All that day and all the following night the army rested. Phagon was pretty sure that Taggad knew nothing of the invasion as yet; but it would be idle to hope to get much closer without being discovered. Every mile gained, however, would be worth a century of men. Therefore, long before dawn, the supremely ready Lomarrian forces rolled over the screening bluff and marched steadily toward Sarlo. Not fast, note; thirteen miles is a long haul when there is to be a full-scale battle at the end of it.  Plodding slowly along on mighty Dreegor at the king's right, Tedric roused himself from a brown study and, gathering his forces visibly, spoke: \"Knowst I love the Lady Rhoann, sire?\"  \"Aye. No secret that, nor has been since the fall of Sarpedion.\"  \"Hast permission, then, to ask her to be my wife, once back in Lompoar?\"  \"Mayst ask her sooner than that, if you like. Wilt be here tomorrow--with the Family, the Court, and an image of Great Llosir--for the Triumph.\"  Tedric's mouth dropped open. \"But sire,\" he managed finally, \"how couldst be _that_ sure of success? The armies are too evenly matched.\"  \"In seeming only. They have no body of horse or foot able to stand against my Royal Guard; they have nothing to cope with you and Sciro and your armor and weapons. Therefore I have been and am certain of Lomarr's success. Well-planned and well-executed ventures do not fail. This has been long in the planning, but only your discovery of the god-metal made it possible of execution.\" Then, as Tedric glanced involuntarily at his gold-plated armor: \"Yea, the overlay made it possible for me to live--although I may die this day, being the center of attack and being weaker and of lesser endurance that I thought--but my life matters not beside the good of Lomarr. A king's life is of import only to himself, to his Family, and to a few--wouldst be surprised to learn how _very_ few--real friends.\"  \"Your life matters to me, sire--and to Sciro!\"  \"Aye, Tedric my almost-son, that I know. Art in the forefront of those few I spoke of. And take this not _too_ seriously, for I expect fully to live. But in case I die, remember this: kings come and kings go; but as long as it holds the loyalty of such as you and Sciro and your kind, the Throne of Lomarr endures!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Taggad of Sarlon was not taken completely by surprise. However, he had little enough warning, and so violent and hasty was his mobilization that the Sarlonians were little if any fresher than the Lomarrians when they met, a couple of miles outside the city's limit.  There is no need to describe in detail the arrangement of the centuries and the legions, nor to dwell at length upon the bloodiness and savagery of the conflict as a whole nor to pick out individual deeds of derring-do, of heroism, or of cowardice. Of prime interest here is the climactic charge of Lomarr's heavy horse--the Royal Guard--that ended it.  There was little enough of finesse in that terrific charge, led by glittering Phagon and his two alloy-clad lords. The best their Middlemarch horses could do in the way of speed was a lumbering canter, but their tremendous masses--a Middlemarch warhorse was not considered worth saving unless he weighed at least one long ton--added to the weight of man and armor each bore, gave them momentum starkly irresistible. Into and through the ranks of Sarlonian armor the knights of Lomarr's Old Blood crashed; each rising in his stirrups and swinging down with all his might, with sword or axe or hammer, upon whatever luckless wight was nearest at hand.  Then, re-forming, a backward smash; then another drive forward. But men were being unhorsed; horses were being hamstrung or killed; of a sudden king Phagon himself went down. Unhorsed, but not out--his god-metal axe, scarcely stoppable by iron, was taking heavy toll.

Elbows in, sire. Short thrusts only, and never mind your legs. Now, men--_DRIVE!_\"  With three giants in impregnable armor at point--Tedric and Sciro were so close beside and behind the king as almost to be one with him--that flying wedge simply could not be stopped. In little over a minute it reached the pavilion and its terribly surprised owner. Golden tigers seemed to leap and creep as the lustrous silk of the tent rippled in the breeze; magnificent golden tigers adorned the Sarlonian's purple-enameled armor.  \"Yield, Taggad of Sarlon, or die!\" Phagon shouted.  \"If I yield, Oh Phagon of Lomarr, what....\" Taggad began a conciliatory speech, but even while speaking he whirled a long and heavy sword out from behind him, leaped, and struck--so fast that neither Phagon nor either of his lords had time to move; so viciously hard that had Lomarr's monarch been wearing anything but super-steel he would have joined his fathers then and there. As it was, however, the fierce-driven heavy blade twisted, bent double, and broke.  Phagon's counter-stroke was automatic. His axe, swung with all his strength and speed, crashed to the helve through iron and bone and brain; and, as soon as the heralds with their clarions could spread the news that Phagon had killed Taggad in hand to hand combat, all fighting ceased.  \"Captain Sciro, kneel!\" With the flat of his sword Phagon struck the steel-clad back a ringing blow. \"Rise, Lord Sciro of Sarlon!\"  _\"So be it,\" Skandos One murmured gently, and took up the life and the work of Skandos Four._  _Ultimate catastrophe was five hundred twenty-nine years away._   THE END         *       *       *       *       *  [Footnote A: See Encyclopedia Britannica (plug).
