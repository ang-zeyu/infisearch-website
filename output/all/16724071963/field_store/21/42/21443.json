To be sure you don't want vodka, but    you want a young woman. All right, brother, all right!    Everyone has his own ways, and Father Missail and I    have only one thing which we care for--we drink to the    bottom, we drink; turn it upside down, and knock at    the bottom.     MISSAIL. Well said, Father Varlaam.     GREGORY. (To Hostess.) Whom do they want? Who    escaped from Moscow?     HOSTESS. God knows; a thief perhaps, a robber. But here    even good folk are worried now. And what will come of    it? Nothing. They will not catch the old devil; as if    there were no other road into Lithuania than the highway!    Just turn to the left from here, then by the pinewood    or by the footpath as far as the chapel on the    Chekansky brook, and then straight across the marsh to    Khlopin, and thence to Zakhariev, and then any child    will guide you to the Luyov mountains. The only good    of these inspectors is to worry passers-by and rob us poor    folk. (A noise is heard.) What's that? Ah, there    they are, curse them! They are going their rounds.     GREGORY. Hostess! Is there another room in the cottage?     HOSTESS. No, my dear; I should be glad myself to hide.    But they are only pretending to go their rounds; but    give them wine and bread, and Heaven knows what--    May perdition take them, the accursed ones! May--     (Enter OFFICERS.)     OFFICERS. Good health to you, mine hostess!     HOSTESS. You are kindly welcome, dear guests.     AN OFFICER. (To another.) Ha, there's drinking going on    here; we shall get something here. (To the Monks.)    Who are you?     VARLAAM. We--are two old clerics, humble monks; we are    going from village to village, and collecting Christian    alms for the monastery.     OFFICER. (To GREGORY.) And thou?     MISSAIL. Our comrade.     GREGORY. A layman from the suburb; I have conducted the    old men as far as the frontier; from here I am going to    my own home.     MISSAIL. So you have changed your mind?     GREGORY. (Sotto voce.) Be silent.     OFFICER. Hostess, bring some more wine, and we will    drink here a little and talk a little with these old men.     2ND OFFICER. (Sotto voce.) Yon lad, it appears, is poor;    there's nothing to be got out of him; on the other hand    the old men--     1ST OFFICER. Be silent; we shall come to them presently.    --Well, my fathers, how are you getting on?     VARLAAM. Badly, my sons, badly! The Christians have    now turned stingy; they love their money; they hide    their money. They give little to God. The people of    the world have become great sinners. They have all    devoted themselves to commerce, to earthly cares; they    think of worldly wealth, not of the salvation of the soul.    You walk and walk; you beg and beg; sometimes in    three days begging will not bring you three half-pence.    What a sin! A week goes by; another week; you look    into your bag, and there is so little in it that you are    ashamed to show yourself at the monastery. What are    you to do? From very sorrow you drink away what is    left; a real calamity! Ah, it is bad! It seems our last    days have come--     HOSTESS. (Weeps.) God pardon and save you!    (During the course of VARLAAM'S speech the 1st    OFFICER watches MISSAIL significantly.)     1ST OFFICER. Alexis! Have you the tsar's edict with you?     2ND OFFICER. I have it.     1ST OFFICER. Give it here.     MISSAIL. Why do you look at me so fixedly?     1ST OFFICER. This is why; from Moscow there has fled a    certain wicked heretic--Grishka Otrepiev. Have you    heard this?     MISSAIL. I have not heard it.     OFFICER. Not heard it? Very good. And the tsar has    ordered to arrest and hang the fugitive heretic. Do you    know this?     MISSAIL. I do not know it.     OFFICER. (To VARLAAM.) Do you know how to read?     VARLAAM. In my youth I knew how, but I have forgotten.     OFFICER. (To MISSAIL.) And thou?     MISSAIL. God has not made me wise.     OFFICER. So then here's the tsar's edict.     MISSAIL. What do I want it for?     OFFICER. It seems to me that this fugitive heretic, thief,    swindler, is--thou.     MISSAIL. I? Good gracious! What are you talking about?     OFFICER. Stay! Hold the doors. Then we shall soon get    at the truth.     HOSTESS. O the cursed tormentors! Not to leave even the    old man in peace!     OFFICER. Which of you here is a scholar?     GREGORY. (Comes forward.) I am a scholar!     OFFICER. Oh, indeed! And from whom did you learn?     GREGORY. From our sacristan.     OFFICER (Gives him the edict.) Read it aloud.     GREGORY. (Reads.) \"An unworthy monk of the Monastery    Of Chudov, Gregory, of the family of Otrepiev, has fallen    into heresy, taught by the devil, and has dared to vex    the holy brotherhood by all kinds of iniquities and acts    of lawlessness. And, according to information, it has    been shown that he, the accursed Grishka, has fled to the    Lithuanian frontier.\"     OFFICER. (To MISSAIL.) How can it be anyone but you?     GREGORY. \"And the tsar has commanded to arrest him--\"     OFFICER. And to hang!     GREGORY. It does not say here \"to hang.\"     OFFICER. Thou liest. What is meant is not always put into    writing. Read: to arrest and to hang.     GREGORY. \"And to hang. And the age of the thief    Grishka\" (looking at VARLAAM) \"about fifty, and his    height medium; he has a bald head, grey beard, fat    belly.\"     (All glance at VARLAAM.)     1ST OFFICER, My lads! Here is Grishka! Hold him!    Bind him! I never thought to catch him so quickly.     VARLAAM. (Snatching the paper.) Hands off, my lads!    What sort of a Grishka am I? What! Fifty years old,    grey beard, fat belly! No, brother. You're too young    to play off tricks on me. I have not read for a long time    and I make it out badly, but I shall manage to make it    out, as it's a hanging matter. (Spells it out.) \"And his    age twenty.\" Why, brother, where does it say fifty?--    Do you see--twenty?     2ND OFFICER. Yes, I remember, twenty; even so it was    told us.     1ST OFFICER. (To GREGORY.) Then, evidently, you like a    joke, brother.     (During the reading GREGORY stands with downcast    head, and his hand in his breast.)     VARLAAM. (Continues.) \"And in stature he is small, chest    broad, one arm shorter than the other, blue eyes, red    hair, a wart on his cheek, another on his forehead.\"    Then is it not you, my friend?     (GREGORY suddenly draws a dagger; all give way    before him; he dashes through the window.)     OFFICERS. Hold him! Hold him!     (All run out in disorder.)     MOSCOW. SHUISKY'S HOUSE  SHUISKY. A number of Guests. Supper     SHUISKY. More wine! Now, my dear guests.     (He rises; all rise after him.)                           The final draught!    Read the prayer, boy.     Boy.                Lord of the heavens, Who art    Eternally and everywhere, accept    The prayer of us Thy servants. For our monarch,    By Thee appointed, for our pious tsar,    Of all good Christians autocrat, we pray.    Preserve him in the palace, on the field    Of battle, on his nightly couch; grant to him    Victory o'er his foes; from sea to sea    May he be glorified; may all his house    Blossom with health, and may its precious branches    O'ershadow all the earth; to us, his slaves,    May he, as heretofore, be generous.    Gracious, long-suffering, and may the founts    Of his unfailing wisdom flow upon us;    Raising the royal cup, Lord of the heavens,    For this we pray.     SHUISKY. (Drinks.) Long live our mighty sovereign!    Farewell, dear guests. I thank you that ye scorned not    My bread and salt. Farewell; good-night.     (Exeunt Guests: he conducts them to the door.)     PUSHKIN. Hardly could they tear themselves away; indeed,    Prince Vassily Ivanovitch, I began to think that we    should not succeed in getting any private talk.     SHUISKY. (To the Servants.) You there, why do you stand    Gaping? Always eavesdropping on gentlemen! Clear    the table, and then be off.     (Exeunt Servants.)                               What is it, Athanasius    Mikailovitch?     PUSHKIN.    Such a wondrous thing!    A message was sent here to me today    From Cracow by my nephew Gabriel Pushkin.     SHUISKY. Well?     PUSHKIN. 'Tis strange news my nephew writes. The son    Of the Terrible--But stay--     (Goes to the door and examines it.)                               The royal boy,    Who murdered was by order of Boris--     SHUISKY. But these are no new tidings.     PUSHKIN.                        Wait a little;    Dimitry lives.     SHUISKY.     So that's it! News indeed!    Dimitry living!--Really marvelous!    And is that all?     PUSHKIN.       Pray listen to the end;    Whoe'er he be, whether he be Dimitry    Rescued, or else some spirit in his shape,    Some daring rogue, some insolent pretender,    In any case Dimitry has appeared.     SHUISKY. It cannot be.     PUSHKIN.             Pushkin himself beheld him    When first he reached the court, and through the ranks    Of Lithuanian gentlemen went straight    Into the secret chamber of the king.     SHUISKY. What kind of man? Whence comes he?     PUSHKIN.                             No one knows.    'Tis known that he was Vishnevetsky's servant;    That to a ghostly father on a bed    Of sickness he disclosed himself; possessed    Of this strange secret, his proud master nursed him,    From his sick bed upraised him, and straightway    Took him to Sigismund.     SHUISKY.             And what say men    Of this bold fellow?     PUSHKIN.           'Tis said that he is wise,    Affable, cunning, popular with all men.    He has bewitched the fugitives from Moscow,    The Catholic priests see eye to eye with him.    The King caresses him, and, it is said,    Has promised help.     SHUISKY.         All this is such a medley    That my head whirls. Brother, beyond all doubt    This man is a pretender, but the danger    Is, I confess,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],["title","Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#4)"],["body","slight. This is grave news!    And if it reach the people, then there'll be    A mighty tempest.     PUSHKIN.        Such a storm that hardly    Will Tsar Boris contrive to keep the crown    Upon his clever head; and losing it    Will get but his deserts! He governs us    As did the tsar Ivan of evil memory.    What profits it that public executions    Have ceased, that we no longer sing in public    Hymns to Christ Jesus on the field of blood;    That we no more are burnt in public places,    Or that the tsar no longer with his sceptre    Rakes in the ashes? Is there any safety    In our poor life? Each day disgrace awaits us;    The dungeon or Siberia, cowl or fetters,    And then in some deaf nook a starving death,    Or else the halter. Where are the most renowned    Of all our houses, where the Sitsky princes,    Where are the Shestunovs, where the Romanovs,    Hope of our fatherland? Imprisoned, tortured,    In exile. Do but wait, and a like fate    Will soon be thine. Think of it! Here at home,    Just as in Lithuania, we're beset    By treacherous slaves--and tongues are ever ready    For base betrayal, thieves bribed by the State.    We hang upon the word of the first servant    Whom we may please to punish. Then he bethought him    To take from us our privilege of hiring    Our serfs at will; we are no longer masters    Of our own lands. Presume not to dismiss    An idler. Willy nilly, thou must feed him!    Presume not to outbid a man in hiring    A labourer, or you will find yourself    In the Court's clutches.--Was such an evil heard of    Even under tsar Ivan? And are the people    The better off? Ask them. Let the pretender    But promise them the old free right of transfer,    Then there'll be sport.     SHUISKY.              Thou'rt right; but be advised;    Of this, of all things, for a time we'll speak    No word.     PUSHKIN. Assuredly, keep thine own counsel.    Thou art--a person of discretion; always    I am glad to commune with thee; and if aught    At any time disturbs me, I endure not    To keep it from thee; and, truth to tell, thy mead    And velvet ale today have so untied    My tongue...Farewell then, prince.     SHUISKY.                 Brother, farewell.    Farewell, my brother, till we meet again.     (He escorts PUSHKIN out.)     PALACE OF THE TSAR  The TSAREVICH is drawing a map. The TSAREVNA. The NURSE of the Tsarevna     KSENIA. (Kisses a portrait.) My dear bridegroom, comely    son of a king, not to me wast thou given, not to thy    affianced bride, but to a dark sepulchre in a strange    land; never shall I take comfort, ever shall I weep for    thee.     NURSE. Eh, tsarevna! A maiden weeps as the dew falls;    the sun will rise, will dry the dew. Thou wilt have    another bridegroom--and handsome and affable. My    charming child, thou wilt learn to love him, thou wilt    forget Ivan the king's son.     KSENIA. Nay, nurse, I will be true to him even in death.     (Boris enters.)     TSAR. What, Ksenia? What, my sweet one? In thy girlhood    Already a woe-stricken widow, ever    Bewailing thy dead bridegroom! Fate forbade me    To be the author of thy bliss. Perchance    I angered Heaven; it was not mine to compass    Thy happiness. Innocent one, for what    Art thou a sufferer? And thou, my son,    With what art thou employed? What's this?     FEODOR.                           A chart    Of all the land of Muscovy; our tsardom    From end to end. Here you see; there is Moscow,    There Novgorod, there Astrakhan. Here lies    The sea, here the dense forest tract of Perm,    And here Siberia.     TSAR.           And what is this    Which makes a winding pattern here?     FEODOR.                           That is    The Volga.     TSAR.    Very good! Here's the sweet fruit    Of learning. One can view as from the clouds    Our whole dominion at a glance; its frontiers,    Its towns, its rivers. Learn, my son; 'tis science    Which gives to us an abstract of the events    Of our swift-flowing life. Some day, perchance    Soon, all the lands which thou so cunningly    Today hast drawn on paper, all will come    Under thy hand. Learn, therefore; and more smoothly,    More clearly wilt thou take, my son, upon thee    The cares of state.     (SEMYON Godunov enters.)                       But there comes Godunov    Bringing reports to me. (To KSENIA.) Go to thy chamber    Dearest; farewell, my child; God comfort thee.     (Exeunt KSENIA and NURSE.)     What news hast thou for me, Semyon Nikitich?     SEMYON G. Today at dawn the butler of Prince Shuisky    And Pushkin's servant brought me information.     TSAR. Well?     SEMYON G. In the first place Pushkin's man deposed    That yestermorn came to his house from Cracow    A courier, who within an hour was sent    Without a letter back.     TSAR.                Arrest the courier.     SEMYON G. Some are already sent to overtake him.     TSAR. And what of Shuisky?     SEMYON G.               Last night he entertained    His friends; the Buturlins, both Miloslavskys,    And Saltikov, with Pushkin and some others.    They parted late. Pushkin alone remained    Closeted with his host and talked with him    A long time more.     TSAR.           For Shuisky send forthwith.     SEMYON G. Sire, he is here already.     TSAR.                       Call him hither.     (Exit SEMYON Godunov.)     Dealings with Lithuania? What means this?    I like not the seditious race of Pushkins,    Nor must I trust in Shuisky, obsequious,    But bold and wily--     (Enter SHUISKY.)                      Prince, I must speak with thee.    But thou thyself, it seems, hast business with me,    And I would listen first to thee.     SHUISKY.                        Yea, sire;    It is my duty to convey to thee    Grave news.     TSAR.     I listen.     SHUISKY. (Sotto voce, pointing to FEODOR.)                      But, sire--     TSAR.                      The tsarevich    May learn whate'er Prince Shuisky knoweth. Speak.     SHUISKY. My liege, from Lithuania there have come    Tidings to us--     TSAR.        Are they not those same tidings    Which yestereve a courier bore to Pushkin?     SHUISKY. Nothing is hidden from him!--Sire, I thought    Thou knew'st not yet this secret.     TSAR.                           Let not that    Trouble thee, prince; I fain would scrutinise    Thy information; else we shall not learn    The actual truth.     SHUISKY.        I know this only, Sire;    In Cracow a pretender hath appeared;    The king and nobles back him.     TSAR.                       What say they?    And who is this pretender?     SHUISKY.                 I know not.     TSAR. But wherein is he dangerous?     SHUISKY.                         Verily    Thy state, my liege, is firm; by graciousness,    Zeal, bounty, thou hast won the filial love    Of all thy slaves; but thou thyself dost know    The mob is thoughtless, changeable, rebellious,    Credulous, lightly given to vain hope,    Obedient to each momentary impulse,    To truth deaf and indifferent; it feedeth    On fables; shameless boldness pleaseth it.    So, if this unknown vagabond should cross    The Lithuanian border, Dimitry's name    Raised from the grave will gain him a whole crowd    Of fools.     TSAR. Dimitry's?--What?--That child's?--Dimitry's?    Withdraw, tsarevich.     SHUISKY.           He flushed; there'll be a storm!     FEODOR. Suffer me, Sire--     TSAR.                  Impossible, my son;    Go, go!     (Exit FEODOR.)           Dimitry's name!     SHUISKY.            Then he knew nothing.     TSAR. Listen: take steps this very hour that Russia    Be fenced by barriers from Lithuania;    That not a single soul pass o'er the border,    That not a hare run o'er to us from Poland,    Nor crow fly here from Cracow. Away!     SHUISKY.                           I go.     TSAR. Stay!--Is it not a fact that this report    Is artfully concocted? Hast ever heard    That dead men have arisen from their graves    To question tsars, legitimate tsars, appointed,    Chosen by the voice of all the people, crowned    By the great Patriarch? Is't not laughable?    Eh? What? Why laugh'st thou not thereat?     SHUISKY.                               I, Sire?     TSAR. Hark, Prince Vassily; when first I learned this child    Had been--this child had somehow lost its life,    'Twas thou I sent to search the matter out.    Now by the Cross and God I do adjure thee,    Declare to me the truth upon thy conscience;    Didst recognise the slaughtered boy; was't not    A substitute? Reply.     SHUISKY.           I swear to thee--     TSAR. Nay, Shuisky, swear not, but reply; was it    Indeed Dimitry?     SHUISKY.      He.     TSAR.           Consider, prince.    I promise clemency; I will not punish    With vain disgrace a lie that's past. But if    Thou now beguile me, then by my son's head    I swear--an evil fate shall overtake thee,    Requital such that Tsar Ivan Vasilievich    Shall shudder in his grave with horror of it.     SHUISKY. In punishment no terror lies; the terror    Doth lie in thy disfavour; in thy presence    Dare I use cunning? Could I deceive myself    So blindly as not recognise Dimitry?    Three days in the cathedral did I visit    His corpse, escorted thither by all Uglich.    Around him thirteen bodies lay of those    Slain by the people, and on them corruption    Already had set in perceptibly.    But lo! The childish face of the tsarevich    Was bright and fresh and quiet as if asleep;    The deep gash had congealed not, nor the lines    Of his face even altered. No, my liege,    There is no doubt; Dimitry sleeps in the grave.     TSAR. Enough, withdraw.     (Exit SHUISKY.)                     I choke!--let me get my breath!    I felt it; all my blood surged to my face,    And heavily fell back.--So that is why    For thirteen years together I have dreamed    Ever about the murdered child. Yes, yes--    'Tis that!--now I perceive. But who is he,    My terrible antagonist? Who is "]]]
