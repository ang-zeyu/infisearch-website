The 2nd section of the 4th     Article of the Constitution of the United States (which all are     solemnly bound to support), declares that the \"citizens of each     State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of     citizens of the several States.\" This privilege extends in full     force to the Territories of the United States. The first Amendment     to the Constitution of the United States declares that \"Congress     shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or     prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"      The Ordinance of Congress of the 13th July, 1787, for the     government of the Territory northwest of the river Ohio, secures     to the citizens of said Territory, and the citizens of the States     thereafter to be formed therein, certain privileges which were, by     the late Act of Congress organizing the Territory of Iowa, extended     to the citizens of this Territory.      The first fundamental Article in that Ordinance, which is declared     to be forever unalterable, except by common consent, reads as     follows, to-wit: \"No person demeaning himself in a peaceable and     orderly manner, shall ever be molested on account of his mode of     worship, or religious sentiments in said Territory.\"      These principles, I trust, will ever be adhered to in the Territory     of Iowa. They make no distinction between religious sects. They     extend equal privileges and protection to all; each must rest upon     its own merits, and will prosper in proportion to the purity of its     principles, and the fruit of holiness and piety produced thereby.      With regard to the peculiar people mentioned in your letter, I know     but little. They had a community in the northern part of Ohio for     several years; and I have no recollection of ever having heard in     that State of any complaints against them from violating the laws     of the country. Their religious opinions, I consider, has nothing     to do with our political transactions. They are citizens of the     United States, and are entitled to the same political rights and     legal protection that other citizens are entitled to.      The foregoing are briefly my views on the subject of your inquiries.                 With sincere respect,                       I am your obedient servant,                                           ROBERT LUCAS.      To ISAAC GALLAND, Esq., Commerce, Illinois.  This communication Dr. Galland sent to the Quincy _Argus_, accompanied by the following note:                                                    COMMERCE, ILLINOIS,                                                       April 12, 1839.      MESSRS. EDITORS:--Enclosed I send you a communication from Governor     Lucas of Iowa Territory. If you think the publication thereof     will in any way promote the cause of justice, by vindicating     the slandered reputation of the people called Mormons, from the     ridiculous falsehoods which the malice, cupidity and envy of     their murderers in Missouri have endeavored to heap upon them,     you are respectfully solicited to publish it in the _Argus_. The     testimony of Governor Lucas as to the good moral character of     these people, I think will have its deserved influence upon the     people of Illinois, in encouraging our citizens in their humane and     benevolent exertions to relieve this distressed people, who are now     wandering in our neighborhoods without comfortable food, raiment,     or a shelter from the pelting storm.               I am, gentlemen, very respectfully,                     Your obedient servant,                              ISAAC GALLAND.  In conversation with Dr. Galland, Isaac Van Allen, Esq., attorney-general for the same Territory (Iowa), gave him to understand that he would, so far as within his power, protect the Mormon people from insult and injury. It was these assurances of sympathy and protection which led to a reconsideration of the conclusion of the former conference, and the appointment of a committee to examine the lands offered. But little or nothing was ever done by this committee.  On the twenty-second of April, 1839, the Prophet Joseph joined the exiled Saints at Quincy. After a cruel imprisonment of over five months, he had escaped from his persecutors while en route from Liberty prison, Clay County, to Columbia, Boone County, to which he and his companions in prison had taken a change of venue for trial. The guards got drunk and were evidently willing for their prisoners to escape. At any rate, the Prophet, in stating the circumstance in his history, says: \"We thought it a favorable opportunity to make our escape; knowing that the only object of our enemies was our destruction; and likewise knowing that a number of our brethren had been massacred by them on Shoal Creek, amongst whom were two children; and they had sought every opportunity to abuse others who were left in the State; and that they were never brought to an account for their barbarous proceedings, but were winked at and encouraged by those in authority. We thought that it was necessary for us, inasmuch as we loved our lives, and did not wish to die by the hand of murderers and assassins; and inasmuch as we loved our families and friends, to deliver ourselves from our enemies.\" And so the Prophet and his companions escaped and arrived in Quincy as already stated.  I need not stop to undertake a description of the scenes of this exiled people welcoming their youthful Prophet into their midst, after such trials as they had passed through, in which the strength of each man's soul and love for his brethren had been tested. The Saints had seen their Prophet and his fellow prisoners betrayed into the hands of a merciless enemy, and knew that a court-martial of the Missouri State militia had condemned him and his companions to be shot in the public square at Far West. They had seen him and his fellow-prisoners torn away from their parents and families, and their people, under circumstances the most distressing. They had been told by the haughty commander-in-chief of the mob militia forces which invested Far West--General Clark--that the doom of their leaders was sealed, and they need not expect, nor even let it enter into their hearts that they would be permitted to see them again. Many of them had seen him chained like a felon, standing before unjust judges, whose hearts were filled to overflowing with hatred towards him. Contrary to every principle of justice, he had been sent to languish in prison in the midst of his enemies; while they themselves, with bursting hearts and blinding tears, were compelled to sign away their lands and homes at the muzzle of the musket and flee from the Christian State of Missouri, under the exterminating order issued by Governor Boggs. Yet in all these trials, from the dangers of the murderous militia camps, from the malice of corrupt courts, and the injustice of drunken juries, and at last from the prison's gloom, a kind Providence had delivered him, and he was again in their midst, again with them to still their fears and direct their movements.  His presence was the signal for action. He arrived in Quincy on the 22nd of April. The day following he spent in greeting his friends, and receiving visits from the brethren; but on the twenty-fourth he called and presided over a conference, at which, in connection with Bishop Knight and Alanson Ripley, he was appointed to go to Iowa to select a place for the gathering of the exiled Saints. The conference also advised the brethren, who could do so, to go to Commerce and locate in Dr. Galland's neighborhood.  On the first of May the committee purchased a farm of one hundred and thirty-five acres, for which they agreed to pay five thousand dollars; also another and a larger farm of Dr. Galland for nine thousand dollars. The committee desired that these farms should be deeded to Alanson Ripley, but Sidney Rigdon, manifesting a rather sour disposition, said that no committee should control any property that he had anything to do with. So the purchase made of Dr. Galland was deeded to Sidney Rigdon's son-in-law, G. W. Robinson, with the understanding that he should deed it to The Church as soon as it was paid for according to the contract. This was the first purchase of lands made in Commerce. The place is thus described by Joseph: \"When I made the purchase of White and Galland, there was one stone house, three frame houses, and two blockhouses, which constituted the whole city of Commerce.\"  This small collection of houses was immediately on the banks of the river, and scattered between them and what afterwards became the south part of the city of Nauvoo, were one stone and three log houses. It was one of these humble dwellings that Joseph moved into on the tenth of May, 1839. Back some distance from the river, however, were other dwellings scattered over the country, one of which was the home of Daniel H. Wells, a justice of the peace for the district of Commerce, and who afterwards became a prominent Church leader, one of the counselors, in fact, in the First Presidency of The Church.  Later, when referring to the purchase of lands about Commerce, the Prophet Joseph said:      The place was literally a wilderness. The land was mostly covered     with trees and bushes, and much of it was so wet that it was with     the utmost difficulty that a footman could get through, and totally     impossible for teams. Commerce was unhealthy, very few could live     there; but believing that it might become a healthy place by the     blessing of heaven to the Saints, and no more eligible place     presenting itself, I considered it wisdom to make an attempt to     build up a city.  Having spoken of the first purchase of lands at Commerce, it may not be amiss here to say that subsequently more extensive purchases were made of Dr. Galland and Messrs. Hubbard, Wells,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50302"],["title","The Rise and Fall of Nauvoo (#4)"],["body","and others. Considerable difficulty and embarrassment to Joseph personally and to The Church in general arose over misunderstandings about the Hotchkiss land purchase. Hotchkiss sold to Joseph for The Church upwards of five hundred acres of land in Commerce, for which he was to receive fifty-three thousand five hundred dollars, half to be paid in ten years, and the remainder in twenty years. This amount was secured to Hotchkiss & Company by two notes, one payable in ten years and the other in twenty, signed by Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and Sidney Rigdon. The difficulty connected with this extensive land purchase arose from some exchanges that were made of property in the east, by some of the Saints, for its equivalent in value in land out of the Hotchkiss purchase in Commerce; the matter, however, was finally amicably settled.  The terms on which Dr. Galland let The Church have lands were extremely advantageous to the Saints. He sold at a reasonable rate, and on long credit, that the people might not be distressed in paying for the inheritance they purchased. In addition to the first purchase, he exchanged lands with the Saints in the vicinity of Commerce for lands in Missouri, to the value of eighty thousand dollars. And he gave them a good title to the same. He is described as a man of literary attainments and extensive information and influence. All of which he used for the good of the exiled Saints in giving them a standing among his friends. Finally he joined The Church, thus casting his lot with the exiled people he had assisted, and from that time until his death, partook of their joys and their sorrows; shared their fortunes and reverses.  In addition to these land purchases, The Church made others; some of them even more extensive than those already mentioned. The village of Nashville, in Lee County, Iowa, and twenty thousand acres of land adjoining, was bought, though upon what terms the purchase was made cannot be learned. Another purchase also in Iowa was made by Bishop Knight, and a settlement was started there called Zarahemla, which was opposite Nauvoo. This place was organized into a stake [1] of Zion, but in January, 1842, the stake organization was discontinued; though Zarahemla continued as an organized branch of The Church.  Stakes of Zion in the following year were organized at Lima, in Illinois; also at Quincy, in Adams County, for the benefit of the Saints who continued there. Another stake was organized at Columbus, in Adams County, Illinois, known as Mount Hope stake; besides these stakes, branches of the Church were organized in various parts of Lee County, Iowa, and Adams and Hancock counties, Illinois. But as Nauvoo rose from the swamps and underbrush of Commerce, and, under the industry and enterprise of the Saints, and the blessings of a kindly disposed Providence, developed into a healthy, beautiful and prosperous commercial and manufacturing city, these stake organizations in the surrounding country were discontinued, and Nauvoo became the one great gathering place of the Saints.  Footnotes  1. A stake of Zion is a territorial division of The Church that embraces several wards or branches. The stake is presided over by a president, who must be a High Priest, assisted by two counselors, also High Priests. There must also be in each stake of Zion a high council, consisting of twelve High Priests, over which council the presidency of the stake preside. This high council constitutes the judicial power (ecclesiastical) of the stake, to which appeals lie from the bishops' courts.    CHAPTER IV.  \"AS FLIES IN THE OINTMENT.\"  HAVING described the site of Nauvoo, and related the circumstances connected with its establishment as a gathering place of the Saints, it is necessary to return to the consideration of some events which occurred at Quincy during the sojourn of the Saints at that place.  Paul, in his day, told the Hebrews that all were not Israel that were of Israel: so all were not Saints that flocked into Quincy with the exiles from Missouri; many of them were altogether unworthy of the association of the people of God. These preyed upon the hospitality of the people of Quincy to such an extent, that The Church by action of a conference authorized Elder John Taylor, then one of the Twelve Apostles, and who afterwards became President of the Church, to write the following letter, which was printed in the Quincy _Argus_:      In consequence of so great an influx of strangers, arriving in     this place daily, owing to their late expulsion from the State     of Missouri, there must of necessity be, and we wish to state to     the citizens of Quincy and the vicinity, through the medium of     your columns, that there are many individuals among the numbers     who have already arrived, as well as among those who are now on     their way here, who never did belong to our Church, and others who     once did, but who, for various reasons, have been expelled from     our fellowship. Among these are some who have contracted habits     which are at variance with principles of moral rectitude (such     as swearing, dram-drinking, etc.,) which immoralities the Church     of Latter-day Saints is liable to be charged with, owing to our     amalgamation under our late existing circumstances. And as we as a     people do not wish to lay under any such imputation, we would also     state, that such individuals do not hold a name or a place amongst     us; that we altogether discountenance everything of the kind,     that every person once belonging to our community, contracting or     persisting in such immoral habits, have hitherto been expelled from     our society; and that such as we may hereafter be informed of, we     will hold no communion with, but will withdraw our fellowship from     them.      We wish further to state, that we feel laid under peculiar     obligations to the citizens of this place for the patriotic     feelings which have been manifested, and for the hand of liberality     and friendship which was extended to us, in our late difficulties;     and should feel sorry to see that philanthropy and benevolence     abused by the wicked and designing people, who under pretense of     poverty and distress, should try to work up the feelings of the     charitable and humane, get into their debt without any prospect     or intention of paying, and finally, perhaps, we as a people be     charged with dishonesty.      We say that we altogether disapprove of such practices, and we warn     the citizens of Quincy against such individuals who may pretend to     belong to our community.  I have given this letter _in extenso_, because it bears upon its face the evidence of the honesty of The Church, and its disposition to treat the people of Illinois, who had so nobly and kindly received its members in the days of their distress, with candor. It also tells us of a class even then in The Church, who by the vileness of their lives gave some coloring to the charges subsequently so unjustly made against the whole Church; a class who brought upon The Church reproach; an unrighteous, apostate element, which lingered with The Church for the sake of advantage--the bane of the body religious.    CHAPTER V.  POLITICAL AGITATION.  ABOUT this time, too, the good feeling entertained toward the Saints by the people of Quincy and vicinity was not a little endangered through the unwise course of Lyman Wight. He began the publication of a series of letters in the Quincy _Whig_, in which he laid the responsibility of the outrages perpetrated against the Saints in Missouri upon the Democratic party, implicating not only the Democrats of Missouri, but indirectly the National Democratic party. This gave much dissatisfaction to members of that party in the vicinity of Quincy, a number of whom had been very active in assisting the Saints; and some of the leading men approached prominent brethren, who still remained in Quincy, and desired to know if The Church sustained the assertions of Lyman Wight. Elder R. B. Thompson wrote a letter to President Joseph Smith on the subject, in which he protested against the course taken by Lyman Wight, because of the influence it was having on many of those who had so nobly befriended the Saints in the day of their distress. Besides, it was altogether unjust, for no particular political party in Missouri was responsible for the cruelty practiced towards the Saints. Those who were in the mobs which robbed them of their homes, burned their houses, ran off their stock, and who whipped, murdered and finally drove the people from the State of Missouri, were made up of individuals of every shade of political faith, and of every religion, and many of no religion whatever. It was unfair, then, under these circumstances, that the responsibility should be laid at the charge of any one party or sect of religion. So that Wight's course was not only doing much mischief, but was also unjust.  To counteract the evil effect of Lyman Wight's communication to the _Whig_, Joseph Smith, Sidney Rigdon and Hyrum Smith, then the presiding quorum of the Church, published a letter in the _Whig_, from which I make the following quotation:      We have not at any time thought there was any political party,     as such, chargeable with the Missouri barbarities, neither any     religious society, as such. They were committed by a mob, composed     of all parties, regardless of difference of opinion, either     political or religious.      The determined stand in this State, and by the people of Quincy     in particular, made against the lawless outrages of the Missouri     mobbers by all parties in politics and religion, have entitled     them equally to our thanks and our profoundest regards, and such,     gentlemen, we hope they will always receive from us. * * * We wish     to say to the public, through your paper, that we disclaim any     intention of making a political question of our"]]]
