He might've been attracted by our descent. Anyway, we can look for that later. Let's go back now so you can look over the ship while it's still light. We should be ready for a quick take-off, if we run into anything too hot to handle.\"  Jon looked the surprise he felt. This sudden responsibility was making Jak more practical than he had ever been before ... just the same as it was making him. After all, it was to be expected. Jon knew Jak had an excellent mind--the elder brother had just used it for what Jon had previously felt were unimportant things--not mechanics, math, or such practical interests.  But the way Jak had taken care of Pop; the way he had figured out how to feed him, and the right medicines to use on the bruise on his head--that must have injured Pop inside--and had known how to set his leg--it was a danged good thing, after all, that Jak had spent so much time studying those other subjects. Maybe mechanics and such sciences were not the main things in life, after all. Other things had their uses, too.  Now the two went back to the ship and around to the stern. There, while Jak stayed on the ground on guard, watching in all directions in turn for any possible dangers, Jon surveyed the great driving tubes.  He climbed the metal rungs set into the ship for that purpose, so he could reach each of the tubes. With his glotorch he studied the lining of each tube, crawling partially inside each one in turn.  Finally he backed out of the last one and down to the ground. \"They're all in fine shape,\" he reported happily to his brother. \"Can't find a single thin spot in any of them. That new alloy is really something.\"  Although the older brother did not know too much about such things, he felt a sudden relief at this report, for he felt that Jon did know, and he had real confidence in him. He had long realized the differences in their temperaments, and for several years had known his brother was almost a genius in the mechanical field.  He remembered mentioning this matter to their father one time, and how his eyes had shone with pride as he answered, \"Jon's really remarkable. Some day, if he keeps on like this, he's going to be known all over the galaxy because of what he'll do in mechanics.\"  Nor had Jak been jealous at this high praise of his younger brother. \"Jon's just a kid,\" he had said, \"and he's thoughtless rather than conceited. But sometimes he makes me so darned mad.\"  His father laughed. \"Yes, like all kids, he hates the thought of letting anyone get ahead of him. That's particularly true of younger brothers. They feel, within themselves, that they are just as good or better than the older members of the family, and sometimes can't help showing it.\"  Jak grinned. \"I'll bust him one yet, some day, though, if he doesn't watch out.\"  But he knew, and so did his father, that he never would. For both knew the real love that existed between the two brothers. Jak realized that his swiftly growing brother--now several inches taller and many pounds heavier than he--had a terrific mind. So, as now, he generally respected Jon's ideas, and shrugged away any momentary angers when Jon was particularly \"bossy.\"  Jak followed as Jon walked slowly along the side of the ship, giving it a careful survey, especially toward the bottom, to see if anything on the lower surfaces appeared wrong.  \"I'll climb up and give the top a going-over tomorrow,\" Jon said as they went ahead.  The _Star Rover_ was really a space-yacht. It was seventy-two feet long, and about eighteen feet in diameter at its thickest part, which was about a third of the way back from the bow. The front of the ship was bluntly rounded, and contained the control room with its thick, quartzite window-ports, and just outside that room the four bow-retarding tubes, which Jon also carefully examined when the boys reached them.  Just aft of the control room were the living quarters. These consisted of the large, comfortable living room, and two small but compact bunkrooms, the bath-toilet, the kitchen and many ingeniously designed closet and drawer spaces for stowing personal belongings, clothing and supplies.  Beyond these were the storerooms for food, tools and other supplies and equipment. The stern two-fifths of the ship was devoted to the storage of fuel and the various machines that drove the space-yacht and kept it a self-contained world while in space.  Here were the refrigerators and heaters, the air- and water-purifiers, the generators of electricity for light and cooking and for their auxiliary motors, such as the ones controlling the airlock doors and pumps. In the lower part of the hull, under their living and control rooms and storerooms, were hydroponic tanks which not only grew vegetables and greens for their table, but which furnished oxygen to replace that unavoidably lost when the locks were opened.  At the far stem were the driving mechanisms. The latter were the latest development in the atomic-powered field, and were surprisingly small for the tremendous work they did.  Even Jon did not yet fully understand how they operated, although he knew how to run them. He did know they took specially-treated copper, in the form of small nuggets, and utilized the tremendous force locked within their atoms as the propelling medium by which the ship operated.  In some manner these nuggets were vaporized inside the generators, into which they were automatically fed from the storage bins as needed--the power-controls regulating the speed with which they were fed into the generators. This vaporized copper was run through some sort of a modified cyclotron-type mechanism, where the binding-force of its atoms was liberated. That indescribable power then forced its vaporized particles out through the tubes--using the Newtonian law of action and reaction to propel the ship.  Suddenly Jon turned to his brother. \"Hey, I just happened to think. We ought to rig up a siren or something, so Mom can call us if she needs us when we're away from the ship.\"  \"Sounds like a swell idea. Can fix?\"  \"Sure, nothing to it. We may even have one among the stores. If not, it's just a diaphragm inside a tube, oscillated by electricity. I'll see if we've got one, or else make one and install it.\"  As they neared the entrance to the ship they saw their mother standing in the opened lock, getting a breath of fresh air, and looking about the clearing with an interested expression.  Jon had just opened his mouth to call to her when suddenly, without warning, without even a change in the light or feeling in the air, rain began coming down in great sheets. The boys, after only a momentary start of surprise, raced for the airlock. Their mother stayed to help them climb in. But by the time they were inside and the outer door was closed, they were wet through to the skin.  \"Wow, that's sure some storm! Wonder if it's a regular feature here?\"  \"I wouldn't know,\" Jak panted. \"Did you get a look at that lightning, and hear the thunder?\"  \"Didn't take time--I was too busy running.\" Jon laughed as he tried to wring the worst of the water out of his coveralls before going through the living room to the bunkroom, where they could change to dry garments.  As they came out their mother, now also in dry clothes, met them with a smile. \"I think your father is getting better--he moved about quite a bit a while ago, although he didn't completely regain consciousness.\"  \"Wonderful!\"  \"That's super!\"  Later, as the three were eating dinner, Jak suddenly laid down his fork in excitement. \"Just happened to think. We didn't see any cities here, so doesn't that make this a prime discovery?\"  \"That it do, that it do,\" Jon said delightedly.  \"Then that means we have the right to name and claim this system....\"  \"Unless there are intelligent inhabitants on some of the other planets.\"  \"Seems to me if there were any, they'd be here--this is certain to be the most logical world to support life. What'll we call this system?\"  \"'Carveria,' of course, stupid. After Pop,\" Jon answered witheringly.  \"That's very thoughtful of you, Son.\" His mother smiled at him fondly.  \"We'll call the sun 'Carveria,' then, and the five planets will be 'Tad,' 'Marci,' 'Jak,' 'Jon,' and 'Rover.'\"  \"Ouch, how corny can you get?\" Jon sniffed. \"Since there are five, I know the fifth should be named for the ship, and we can't very well call it 'Star Rover.' But certainly not just 'Rover,' either.\"  \"Why not leave off the last 'r' and just call it 'Rove'?\" their mother suggested.  \"Good!\" \"Swell!\" the two exclaimed at once.  \"That means this one is named after you, Mom. How does it feel to have a whole world named after you?\"  \"You ought to know,\" she retorted with a smile that brought out her dimples in the old way. \"You've each got one named for you.\"  \"Then let's call this moon 'Diana,' after the ancient goddess of the moon,\" Jak said.  \"Look, Owl, this is Mom's planet. She has the right to name her own moon.\" Jon's voice was almost a sneer.  \"I think 'Diana' is a very nice name, and I'll accept that, although I'm going to make it 'Diane,'\" his mother soothed. \"That has always been my favorite girl name. If I'd ever had a daughter, I probably would have named her 'Diane.' So it will make a doubly fine name for my moon.\"  \"Haven't time to measure or weigh it now, but I'll bet it's big enough, and close enough, to cause tides,\" Jon said meditatively.  \"What's that got to do with the price of onions in Bermuda?\"  \"Nothing, just thought it was interesting. Well, bed for me. Need a good rest tonight.\"  \"Why, especially, Son? What do you plan for tomorrow?\"  \"Just some more exploring, that's all. And we'll be careful,\" Jon added hastily as he saw the familiar words forming on her lips. \"'Night, Mom.\"     4   At breakfast the next morning Jon suddenly stopped eating. \"Say, as we were coming down, did you notice a small river or creek just over there to the right? "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50682"],["title","The Planet Mappers (#7)"],["body","was pretty busy at the time, but seem to remember something of the sort.\"  \"Yes, there was one near, but don't know just how far. Why?\"  The boy grinned. \"If there's a stream, there're probably fish. I was thinking we could get some fresh supplies that way.\"  \"You and your fishing! Don't you ever think of anything else?\"  \"Sure I do, but I notice you always eat your share when I catch any and Mom cooks 'em.\"  Their mother said quickly, \"Some fresh fish would taste good, Boys. If you have time and can catch any, I know we would all appreciate them.\"  \"Look, Jak, you want to explore some more of that jungle, and I want to see if there's any of that stuff Pop was looking for, near here. We can just as well do both while working toward that creek, and I can take my rod along. But first, we've got to set up our marker here in the clearing.\"  \"That's right, I'd almost forgotten your telling us about that. And we don't want to stay too long, either. Didn't you say we have to place one on each planet in order to prove our claim as original discovers?\"  \"Yes, and one in an orbit about the sun, too.\" Jon pushed back his chair and rose. \"I'll go get one from the storeroom.\"  \"I'll get my specimen cases ready, and see to the guns.\" Jak, too, rose, then forestalled his mother by turning to her, \"I'll feed Father first, and we'll be careful outside. You can call us back with the new siren Jon installed, if you need us.\"  \"All right, Boys.\" She smiled at them. \"Mr. C. seemed to rest well last night, although I do wish he would regain full consciousness. I've plenty of housekeeping to keep busy while you're gone. Really should do some washing, but that doesn't take long. Just don't stay out too late.\"  \"We won't,\" they both assured her. \"We'll be back long before dark.\"  The marker which Jon fetched from the storeroom and placed near the inner lockdoor, ready to take outside and set up, was one developed by the scientists and technies of Terra for just such use.  It consisted of an exceptionally strong broadcasting unit that beamed the message of a tape, continuously, toward Terra. Jon made up the tape while Jak was giving the feeding. It read, \"This planetary system was first discovered by Tad Carver, on fourteenth January, 2136. This is the second planet, and has been named 'Marci.'\"  Over and over, at five-minute intervals, the sender would broadcast that message on a beam aimed at Terra. The controlling mechanism was a marvelously precise uranium clock, and a small atomic motor with fuel enough for five years gave all the needed power.  By the terms of the Terran Colonial laws, this was supposed to entitle the prime discover to certain rights in the system. For one thing, he would receive a one-half per cent share of the value of all minerals, oils, jewels and certain other natural resources later colonists might wrest from those planets, for twenty years following his discovery and the acceptance of his claim.  In this way, the Colonial Board of the World Government of Terra sponsored and assured the far-flung exploration which the development of deep-space travel had made possible. The dangers and expense were so considerable that something well worth while had to be offered to make individuals or companies willing to gamble on the hardships and tremendous costs of exploration.  When the boys left the ship to place the marker, they left both lockdoors open so that the fresh morning air from outside could circulate throughout the ship, replacing the somewhat stuffy, although chemically pure air that their purifiers kept renewed.  \"Keep your eyes and ears open, and shut the doors if you think there's any danger,\" both boys cautioned their mother, after making sure she knew how to work the door controls.  \"I will,\" she promised with a laugh, and couldn't help adding, \"Just you be as careful as I'll be.\"  The boys carried the signal-sender to a distant corner of the clearing, to what Jon said was a good spot. \"The book says to dig a hole and plant it with the top projecting three inches above the ground, whenever such a thing is possible.\"  \"You know what to do, so take charge,\" Jak said simply. When they had dug the hole and placed the sender in it, they shoveled the dirt back, then Jon opened the lid. He started the tape reels and the broadcasting unit, then carefully shut and locked the cover.  In digging, they found the ground here to be damp and soggy, apparently from that terrific downpour of the previous evening. It was almost like a wet clay, although, even to their inexperienced eyes, it seemed to be a very rich type of soil.  \"Look how wet it is, even over two feet down,\" Jon said.  \"That was a real rain last night,\" Jak shook his head slowly, \"but somehow I can't believe it made this. Maybe this is the rainy season.\"  They started toward the jungle, but turned to look back toward the ship. They saw their mother at the open door, and waved to her.  After seeing her answering wave, they plunged into the forest at a point where they saw a trail, left either by the frequent passings of the great triped they had shot, or by other beasts of some type not yet seen. Memory of that gigantic beast, though, made them doubly cautious.  \"Sure don't want to meet his relatives,\" Jon said.  \"Especially the mate,\" Jak added, and could not conceal a shiver.  They had noticed with considerable interest and surprise that those native ant-like scavengers had almost entirely eaten the bones of the triped.  \"Apparently we'll not find much in the way of remains on this world,\" Jak commented as they walked carefully along the trail. \"Those scavenger birds and ants sure clean up things in a hurry.\"  \"Except for old vegetation,\" Jon grunted as he stumbled over a dead branch protruding out into the trail. He was keeping his rifle ready in his hands, and his keen eyes alert to one side and then the other, rather than downward.  Knowing his younger brother was so carefully on guard, Jak felt free to study and examine the various trees and other plant life near the irregular path they were following. He was almost in a frenzy of delight, constantly darting off the trail a few yards to look at some specimen he had detected, studying it carefully and exclaiming over his find.  \"Hey, this one is like an _acer compestris_,\" he yelped, intently studying the bark with his magnifying glass.  \"Spik Englis,\" Jon scolded. \"What is it?\"  \"A hard maple,\" Jak's voice was condescending. Then he ran over to another. \"This one's almost like a silver poplar. See how its light bark glints where the sunlight hits it?\"  He started toward another farther away, but Jon called him back. \"Don't get so far from the trail.\" Reluctantly, Jak retraced his steps, only to be off again a moment later.  \"This 'un's got nuts almost like small coconuts.\" He picked a fallen one from the ground and tossed it to Jon. \"See if you can crack it and find out what's inside.\"  But when Jon had done so, it proved to be dried and half-rotted. They could not get a fresh one from the tree by shaking, and it was too smooth and high to climb without spurs.  Jak quickly filled his knapsacks with first one and then another of the smaller plants, twigs and leaves he was continually finding. Soon Jon was laughing heartily, for his brother now had to discard an older specimen to make room for the new.  \"You'll have to make several trips to get anywhere near all of those just around here, Owl,\" Jon called at last. \"You can't take back everything, anyway. Way you're going now, you'd soon have the ship so full of your junk there'd be no place for us. And this is only the first planet, remember?\"  \"But these are unique,\" Jak wailed. \"Botanists will want to study them.\"  \"Then let them come here,\" Jon stated practically.  Jak looked at him, and grew shamefaced. \"Guess I did go a little nuts,\" he said. But before long his excitement rose to fever pitch again. \"There's so much here that's new and different, yet something like the ones we know. I must take back samples of everything.\"  \"How many different kinds of--oh, say, roses--are there on Terra?\"  \"Why ... why ... I don't really know. Hundreds, I'm sure. Maybe thousands. What's that got to do with this?\"  \"Simply trying to make you realize you can't take back samples of 'everything,' as you said.\"  \"Ouch!\" Jak laughed good-naturedly then. \"You've got me, pal. I'll take it easier.\"  But he soon forgot his good intentions as he found ever newer and more different plants and trees and mosses. There was such a dissimilarity, yet at the same time so many points of likeness between the plant life of this new world and that of Terra, that the young botanist was in a continual state of excitement.  Jon, meanwhile, although still keeping a sharp watch for any possible dangers, had been noticing the profusion of other life in this jungle. There were a number of different bird forms, although he saw that those he was close enough to examine were fur-covered rather than feathered. Nor did they seem to be songsters, for the only noises he heard were the soughing of the wind through the trees and vines and bushes, and the _swish_ of wings as the birds flew past.  They had gone some distance when he stopped short. Off at one side there was movement among the small bushes. A quick sibilant whisper froze Jak in his tracks. Jon raised his gun, his eyes searching quickly. Then two quick shots ... and a threshing in the underbrush. Soon stillness--and the two boys advanced cautiously, both with their guns at the ready. In the bushes they found what Jon had shot--two small tripeds somewhat resembling large jack rabbits.  \"Hah, these should be good eating.\" Jon was in transports as he picked them up, examining them carefully.  \"Should be tender, at least, if the flesh is suitable to us.\" Jak was excited, too. \"There's enough for a good meal.\"  Jon took a piece of cord from his coverall pocket and tied the hind legs together, then slung them over his shoulder. \"Let's"]]]
