As a matter of fact, had the water not been but inches from the bottom of the pontoon, and Dave able to sit down quickly, the plane would have cartwheeled over and gone in wingtips first to really crack up. As it was, the hasty emergency landing made Dave's teeth click, and his backbone to feel as though it had been snapped off in half a dozen places. However, the plane stayed put on its pontoon, and in a couple of seconds the stars and comets ceased dancing around inside Dave's head.  The first thing he did was to twist his head around and look for the strange submarine. But it wasn't anywhere to be seen. It had obviously crash-dived once the Swordfish had been hit. There wasn't even the froth of its wake to be seen. Dave took a good look in all directions, and then looked at Freddy Farmer's wide eyed and slightly pale face. He grinned and touched a finger to his flying helmet.  \"Weren't in a hurry to get any place, were you, boss?\" he called out. \"I think we've had an accident. In fact, I'm cockeyed sure of it, boss.\"  The kidding words snapped the strain that was gripping the English youth. Freddy slowly relaxed, swallowed a couple of times, and then matched Dave's grin.  \"It doesn't matter, driver,\" he said. Then with a wave of his hand, \"Welcome to Singapore. Nice place, isn't it?\"  \"Oh, jolly, as the beef eating English say,\" Dave mimicked with a chuckle. \"A trifle on the wet side, though. You okay, Freddy?\"  \"My heart's stuck fast against my back teeth,\" the other said. \"I fancy, though, it'll drop back into place in a moment. But that was the damnedest ever, Dave. What in the world do you think?\"  Dave gave a shake of his head and heaved a long puzzled sigh.  \"I can't even try to guess, much less think,\" he finally grunted. \"Thank the gods that only one shell hit us ... and it on the nose. About ten feet farther back and you and I would be going places right now full of slivers of steel. What do you think?\"  \"Less than that, I'm afraid,\" Freddy said, and cast anxious eyes about the surface of the surrounding water. \"To tell the truth, I feel like I've just awakened from a horrible nightmare.\"  \"Take a look at our engine!\" Dave growled. \"It was no nightmare, son. Say, Freddy. You won't laugh, will you?\"  \"Lord knows I could do with a good laugh right now,\" the English youth said and unbuckled his uncomfortable parachute harness. \"But what's on your mind? I promise not to laugh.\"  \"Those guys who came popping out on that sub's deck like rabbits,\" Dave said after a long frowning pause. \"Know what they looked like to me?\"  \"What?\"  \"Like Japs,\" Dave said, straight faced.  Freddy Farmer gulped and blinked. It was a couple of seconds before he could get his tongue to form the word.  \"Japs?\" he gasped.  \"Sure, Japs,\" Dave repeated. \"You know, short for Japanese. I'll bet you that was a Jap submarine, and those guys who let fly at us were Japs.\"  The English youth pondered over that a moment, and meanwhile kept up his nervous-eyed search of the surrounding rolling swells.  \"They did have the Japanese build, I'll admit,\" he finally said. \"But.... Lord! It's fantastic, Dave! Why in the world would a Jap submarine come to the surface and blast away at us? We're not even carrying a torpedo, to say nothing of bombs.\"  \"But we are carrying a two-way radio,\" Dave pointed out gravely. \"It could be that they didn't want anybody to know they were this close to Singapore. They didn't hear us use the radio, so decided to surprise us and blast us before we could use it. I only hope they don't surface again and make sure with those bow guns. Say! What are you hunting for anyway?\"  \"What do you think?\" Freddy Farmer snapped. \"I'm hoping they _don't_ come back to the surface, either. That they'll believe they got us with that one blast. But, Dave, it's still fantastic. England's not at war with Japan. Standers of the Harkness would have been informed if war was declared while we were at sea. And he certainly would have told his officers.\"  \"You and your English rules of war!\" Dave groaned. \"Look, little man, they don't _declare_ war any more these days. You only find out you're at war when you feel the pain of the knife going into your back. But I only said they _looked_ like Japs. Maybe they weren't. Maybe they grow them that way in Hitlerland, now. Who can tell?\"  \"Well, I guess it doesn't make much difference who they were,\" Freddy said with a shrug. \"The point is, _here_ we are, and _what_ are we going to do about it.\"  \"We could swim,\" Dave grunted, \"but I never was very good at making friends with man-eating sharks. If you must know the truth, I figure we've got to sit here and wait.\"  \"But that might be forever!\" Freddy cried in a startled voice.  \"Yeah, a long time,\" Dave said, and tapped a finger to his head. \"Stop wondering about the Japs, pal, and relax and use your brains. Or did you leave them in England?\"  \"Very funny!\" Freddy growled. \"But just what are you being so long winded about? Come on, spit it out!\"  \"What would you do without me always around to hold your hand, and dry your tears,\" Dave taunted with a grin. \"We sit here until they come out and pick us up, of course.\"  \"Until _they_ come out?\" Freddy echoed sharply. \"Who knows where we...?\"  He stopped short and made a face as though he had bitten his tongue. Then he grinned sheepishly as the flush came into his cheeks.  \"Sorry, old thing,\" he mumbled. \"Stupid of me, wasn't it? I see what you mean, of course. When Air Vice Marshal Bostworth doesn't see us return from a two hour mystery patrol over this area, he'll jolly well send out search planes, eh?\"  \"He'd jolly well better!\" Dave grunted and fished for the chocolate bars he always carried. \"Or I'll punch him right on the nose if I ever meet up with him again. He got us into this, and he can get us out! Here, have a hunk of chocolate. And don't chew with your mouth open. It's not nice, and it makes me nervous.\"  Freddy Farmer shrugged when he could think of no fitting retort to that one. However, he accepted one of the bars of chocolate, and both boys fell to eating and silently staring out over the expanse of rolling blue water that seemed to touch no land in any direction.     CHAPTER FOUR  _Satan Over Singapore_   Exactly five hours later the two boys were still staring out across the rolling blue swells, and in between times they had searched and researched the blazing China Sea skies with their tired eyes. But from then until now they had seen nothing to bring joy or alarm to their hearts. No planes or ships had appeared, and although they had kidded and horsed around to keep each other's spirits at a high level, tiny fears, and dreads, and doubts, were little by little boring deeper into their thoughts. For five hours neither had seen the slightest sign of anything that might mean rescue. And for five solid hours each had expected the mysterious submarine to rise to the surface again and really finish them off. After all, they had been shot down by the undersea boat's guns for reasons they still couldn't figure out. But just to be shot down and left floating alive was something else again. That is, unless the crew and officers of that strange submarine were of the belief that they had died.  Licking his dry lips, Dave half turned in the seat and shot a quick glance back at Freddy Farmer. There was a set smile on the English youth's lips, but the tightness at the corners of his eyes, and a faint line of worry that creased his forehead told that the youth was struggling inwardly to keep control of his jangled nerves and not go haywire.  \"I think I forgot to ask you,\" Dave said. \"Just how did you like your visit to Singapore, anyway?\"  \"Top-hole!\" Freddy said with a forced smile. \"So ... so stimulating, and educational, you know. Fact is, I don't believe I'll ever forget it. One of the milestones in my life.\"  \"Speaking of things educational,\" Dawson said to keep the conversation alive, \"what do you know about Singapore, anyway?\"  \"Ask me, and find out, my little man,\" Freddy said with a little wave of his hand.  Dave dragged down the corners of his mouth, and squinted at his pal.  \"A smart guy, huh?\" he grunted. \"Okay, I will ask you a few things. First, what does Singapore mean?\"  \"Don't you know?\" Freddy retorted.  \"Come on, none of that stuff!\" Dave cried. \"Stop crawling, young man. Tell teacher, or else admit you're dumb. What does Singapore mean?\"  \"Singapore means nothing!\" Freddy shot at him. \"It is the modern spelling of the city's real name centuries ago. Then it was Singhapura. That is a Sanskrit word that means City of the Lion.\"  Dave made a mock bow and went through the motions of tipping his hat.  \"Well, knock me over with a Flying Fortress!\" he exclaimed. \"I guess the guy did spend two or three years in school. Okay, tell me some more, sonny.\"  \"It's rather a nice sort of place, if you go in for that sort of place,\" Freddy said gravely. \"It is an island, of course. It was picked as a British navy outpost by a Sir Stafford Raffles many, many years ago. It covers about two hundred and sixteen square miles and it guards the trade routes to the Indian Ocean. It is very well fortified, and any nation who tries to take it away from us is going to have a battle on his hands, I can tell you. The city is built....\"  \"Okay, okay!\" Dave laughed and threw up his hands. \"I guess you've read books. Spare me the rest of the details. I read a book once, myself.\"  \"Right-o,\" Freddy Farmer said. \"Now it's my turn to ask questions. No, not about Singapore. Here's a question that oddly enough not one man in fifty could answer correctly.\"  \"Then shoot!\" Dawson said with a chuckle. \"Me, I'm that one man.\"  \"Here goes then,\" the English born R.A.F. ace said. \"Is there a type of Nazi dive bomber called the Stuka?\"  Dave Dawson sat up a little straighter in the cockpit seat and gave his friend a keen look.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50661"],["title","Dave Dawson at Singapore (#4)"],["body","\"What was that last one?\" he demanded. \"You wouldn't be kidding a pal, would you, pal?\"  \"Certainly not!\" Freddy retorted. \"And _you_ stop crawling. Answer the question. Is there a type of Nazi dive bomber called the Stuka?\"  \"I hope to kiss a Messerschmitt there is!\" Dave replied. \"And I wish I had a dime for every time one of them has come piling down in my direction. What is this, anyway? You didn't drop your brains over the side, did you?\"  \"No, but you must have!\" the English youth snapped back. \"My poor misinformed little friend, Stuka is a name for _all_ kinds of dive bombers. Not just one type, as is commonly believed. It comes from the German word _Sturzkampfflugzeug_. And that word means, plunge-battle-fight-apparatus. And so, I would suggest that you go back and make your solo flight all over again.\"  \"My, my!\" Dave breathed and gave a shake of his head in mock admiration. \"After all this time and I didn't once dream that you had that big word inside of you. I must really get to know you one of these days. You'd be quite something to have along at one of those radio quiz programs. I just bet you got sore fingers from tearing off box tops, and sending into the corner drugstore. But hold it! You don't have advertising on your English radio programs, do you?\"  \"No, we don't,\" Freddy said with a frown. \"And what do you mean, tear off a box top?\"  \"It's a radio stunt used back home to build up sales,\" Dave explained. \"A manufacturer may be offering a booklet, or some kind of prize free, see? You can get it for nothing. All you do is buy say five or ten boxes of his product, tear off the tops and send them in with your name and address. And they send you whatever it is they are offering special, see? The catch is to get you to buy more of his product so's you can tear off the box tops. I once tried to get a book of old American songs that was being offered, but the folks wouldn't let me. It would have cost my Dad close to six thousand dollars to get the top of the boxes their product came in.\"  Freddy Farmer's eyes popped, and his mouth fell open.  \"Six thousand dollars?\" he gasped. \"Good Lord! Why that much money?\"  \"The company sold pianos!\" Dave said and ducked as Freddy flushed and swung his opened hand.  \"When will I learn not to believe a thing that falls out of your big mouth!\" Freddy groaned. Then after a moment's silence, he said, \"This is a bit of foolishness, isn't it? Why don't we talk about what's really on our minds?\"  \"Okay,\" Dave said with a shrug. \"Let's talk about it, then. Go ahead.\"  \"Well, right at this moment I'm not feeling too kindly toward Air Vice Marshal Bostworth,\" Freddy said. \"It's over three hours since we were to meet him at Singapore R.A.F. Base. I should think he would have sent planes out hunting for us by now. What do you think?\"  Dave didn't answer for a moment. He slowly twisted around in the seat and took a good look at the sky and at the four horizons. He saw nothing in the air, and only far to the south did he see the thin dark line low down that marked land of some sort. It could be any one of the several islands that dotted the Strait.  \"The same as you think, I guess, Freddy,\" he said presently, turning to his friend. \"I frankly thought that we might have to wait for a spell or so. But not so long as this. If help's coming I hope it comes soon. That sun is getting closer and closer to the western horizon. Maybe when we didn't show up Air Vice Marshal Bostworth decided that Captain Standers wouldn't let us take a plane. And speaking of Standers, he's sure going to tear out his hair when he doesn't get this Fairey Swordfish back. He struck me as a lad who doesn't like folks to keep things they borrow.\"  \"Oh, bother to Standers!\" Freddy grunted and shook a hand impatiently. \"What do we do when darkness falls, Dave?\"  \"Let it fall,\" the Yank replied. \"What else?\"  \"Lord, what a help you are to a chap!\" the English youth groaned. \"We can't stay here forever. In case you don't realize it, my funny man, a seam has split in the pontoon, and we've been taking in water for an hour now. We're going to go under eventually.\"  \"Yes, I've known we were taking in water, Freddy,\" Dave said quietly. \"It isn't our combined weight that's making this job list a few degrees. But.... Well, Freddy, if it happens, I guess we've just got to take it, that's all. To tell the truth I've been beating my brains all over the place trying to figure some way to get in touch with the nearest shore. But the only way I can figure, wouldn't help us at all. Not unless help came out quicker than greased lightning.\"  \"Well, as you've often said, anything's worth a try!\" Freddy exclaimed. \"What's your idea?\"  \"A bum one, and definitely out,\" Dave replied with a vigorous shake of his head. \"The only way we could attract attention on shore is to set the plane on fire. If we did, it would only be a case of who got us first, the flames, or the sharks. Nope! I shouldn't even have brought it up.\"  \"I'll say you shouldn't have!\" Freddy growled and glared at the radio panel. \"Look at that thing, there! Perfectly good when we're in the air but not worth a hoot down here on the water. Runs off the engine. Why don't they fit the things with hand driven generators so a chap can still work the radio when he's forced down?\"  \"They do on the big ships,\" Dave said. \"But every extra pound of weight counts on this type of plane. Besides, Air Ministry expects you to be a good pilot and not get forced down.\"  \"Blast Air Ministry!\" Freddy snarled. \"I wish some of those precious Brass Hats were here with us now. Perhaps they'd get a better idea of what a flying johnnie has to go through. It's all wrong, I tell you, Dave. The blokes at Air Ministry think that....\"  \"Tell me tomorrow, pal!\" Dave suddenly broke in excitedly and flung up a hand toward the southwest. \"Take a good look up there. Is that a plane, or have they got birds that big in this neck of the world?\"  Freddy Farmer snapped his opened mouth shut and swiveled eagerly around in his seat, and peered intently in the direction of Dave's pointed finger. After a long minute he let clamped air out of his lungs in a great sigh of unbelievable relief.  \"It's not a bird, Dave, it's a plane!\" he cried. \"A flying boat. It's one of our American built patrol Catalinas. Can't you recognize it? Lord knows you had enough experience on one!\"[1]  [Footnote 1: _Dave Dawson On Convoy Patrol._]  \"Old Freddy Farmer, the lad with telescopic eyes!\" Dave cried as the prospect of immediate rescue drove all the little gnawing fears away. \"They should get you to censor mail. You wouldn't have to take the letters out of the envelopes. But.... I hope you're right, sweetheart. I can see something headed this way, but it's too doggone small for a good look.\"  \"Don't fret, it's a Catalina!\" the English youth cried out happily. \"I'm sure of it now. See? They've sighted us. They're coming down.\"  \"They could be going out for lunch, for all I could tell,\" Dave grunted as he strained his eyes at the faint blackish blur high up in the China Sea sky. \"But I'll take your word for it. Tell me, how many aboard? And has the pilot got a mustache or not?\"  \"He has not, but he's got a gold tooth!\" Freddy snapped at him. \"Stop pulling my leg. You must be able to see it clearly, now. Just because you're being rescued from a possible watery grave, my good man, don't be so blasted funny.\"  \"Funny?\" Dave echoed with a snort. \"Look at me! I could weep with joy. Now that things look okay for us, I can admit that I was plenty worried awhile back. And no kidding, either!\"  \"Hardly the word to express how I felt,\" Freddy murmured and took a deep breath. \"But perhaps we were really born under a lucky star, Dave. We always manage to skin through, somehow.\"  \"Skin through, he says?\" Dave echoed. \"You mean, I walk through and pull you through after me. But let it go. Boy! What I'm going to tell Air Vice Marshal Bostworth when I see him!\"  \"Well, don't do it unless I'm outside the building,\" Freddy said.  \"Outside the building?\" Dave echoed and gave him a puzzled look. \"Why?\"  \"To catch you when you come out,\" the English youth replied with a grin. \"Air Vice Marshal Bostworth is six foot, three, as you know. And he is a holy terror about insubordination, as you _also_ know.\"  \"Yeah, that's true,\" Dave murmured, and watched the Catalina slide down lower and lower. \"Well, at least I'll be thinking plenty when, and if, I meet him. Five hours on this sea of liquid fire is enough to make anybody sore. Okay, Freddy, give the pilot a wave. He's waving at us. Man, oh man! Doesn't it make you feel good to see that old R.A.F. insignia on the wings and hull?\"  Freddy simply nodded. For the moment he was unable to speak. He was too choked up with emotion to dare trust his tongue. So he simply nodded, waved his hand and smiled all over the place as the Catalina sank lower, then cut around into the wind and made a feather-duster landing not over thirty yards to the lee of the slowly foundering Fairey Swordfish. Some clever sea rudder and engine throttling by the pilot soon brought the Catalina close enough for the boys to catch the line that came singing out through the hull door. Another couple of moments and they were both way out on the Swordfish's left lower wing and scrambling aboard the Catalina.  \"Dawson and Farmer, of course?\" asked the sergeant gunner who helped them aboard.  \"Check!\" Dave gulped. \"And were we glad to see this job. We were getting the feeling that we'd soon be food for those sharks that were gathering around.\"  \"Nasty devils, those man eaters in these waters, sir,\" the Sergeant said, and stepped around Dave. \"Stand clear, sir. I'm tossing a little time bomb into the Fairey. No sense having it float around for some johnny to run into. There! There we are.\"  A pang of sadness touched Dave's heart as he watched the small time bomb arc from the Sergeant's hand and plop down into the cockpit of the Fairey"]]]
