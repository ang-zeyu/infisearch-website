He could feel his heart beating against the soft white cushion beneath him. There was no time to look at this calmly and he was glad of that. He spent some time being very much afraid of the unknown things beyond the trees, but even then he realized that this was the one thing in his life he had to do.  It is not a matter of dying, he thought, but of _doing_. Sooner or later a man must do a thing which justifies his life, or the life is not worth living. The long cold line of his existence had reached this point, here and now in the snow at this moment. He would go on from here as a man ... or not at all.  Rush had sat down beside him, beginning to understand, watching without words. He was an old man. Like all Earthmen, he had never fought with his hands. He had not fought the land, or the tides, or the weather, or any of the million bitter sicknesses which Man had grown up fighting, and he was beginning to realize that somewhere along the line he had been betrayed. Now, with a dead paw of the enemy in his hand, he did not feel like a man. And he was ready to fight now, but it was much too late and he saw with a vast leaden shame that he did not know how, could not even begin.  \"Can I help?\" he said.  Dylan shook his head. \"Go back and let them know about the robots, and, if the ship is ready to leave before I get back, well--then good luck.\"  He started to slither forward on his belly but Rush reached out and grabbed him, holding with one hand to peace and gentleness and the soft days which were ending.  \"Listen,\" he said, \"you don't owe anybody.\"  Dylan stared at him with surprise. \"I know,\" he said, and then he slipped up over the mound before him and headed for the trees.         *       *       *       *       *  Now what he needed was luck. Just good, plain old luck. He didn't know where they were or how many there were or what kinds there were, and the chances were good that one of them was watching him right now. Well, then he needed some luck. He inched forward slowly, carefully, watching the oncoming line of trees. The snow was falling on him in big, leafy flakes and that was fine, because the blackness of his suit was much too distinct and the more white he was the better. Even so, it was becoming quite dark by now and he thought he had a chance. He reached the first tree.  Silently he slipped off his heavy cap. The visor got in his way and above all he must be able to see. He let the snow thicken on his hair before he raised himself on his elbows and looked outward.  There was nothing but the snow and the dead quiet and the stark white boles of the trees. He slid past the first trunk to the next, moving forward on his elbows with his pistol in his right hand. His elbow struck a rock and it hurt and his face was freezing. Once he rubbed snow from his eyebrows. Then he came through the trees and lay down before a slight rise, thinking.  Better to go around than over. But if anything is watching, it is most likely watching from above.  Therefore, go around and come back up from behind. Yes.  His nose had begun to run. With great care he crawled among some large rocks, hoping against hope that he would not sneeze. Why had nothing seen him? Was something following him now? He turned to look behind him but it was darker now and becoming difficult to see. But he would have to look behind him more often.  He was moving down a gorge. There were large trees above him and he needed their shelter, but he could not risk slipping down the sides of the gorge. And far off, weakly, out of the gray cold ahead, he heard a noise.  He lay face down in the snow, listening. With a slow, thick shuffle, a thing was moving through the trees before him. In a moment he saw that it was not coming toward him. He lifted his head but saw nothing. Much more slowly now, he crawled again. The thing was moving down the left side of the gorge ahead, coming away from the rise he had circled. It was moving without caution and he worried that if he did not hurry, he would lose it. But for the life of him he couldn't stand up.         *       *       *       *       *  The soldier went forward on his hands and knees. When his clothes hung down, the freezing cold entered his throat and shocked his body, which was sweating. He shifted his gun to his gloved hand and blew on the bare fingers of his right, still crawling. When he reached the other end of the gorge, he stood upright against a rock wall and looked in the direction of the shuffling thing.  He saw it just as it turned. It was a great black lump on a platform. The platform had legs and the thing was plodding methodically upon a path which would bring it past him. It had come down from the rise and was rounding the gorge when Dylan saw it. It did not see him.  If he had not ducked quickly and brought up his gun, the monkey would not have seen him either, but there was no time for regret. The monkey was several yards to the right of the lump on the platform when he heard it start running, and he had to look up this time and saw it leaping toward him over the snow.  All right, he said to himself. His first shot took the monkey in the head, where the eyes were. As the thing crashed over, there was a hiss and a stench, and flame seared into his shoulder and the side of his face. He lurched to the side, trying to see, his gun at arm's-length as the lump on the platform spun toward him. He fired four times. Three bolts went home in the lump, the fourth tore a leg off the platform and the whole thing fell over.  Dylan crawled painfully behind a rock, his left arm useless. The silence had come back again and he waited, but neither of the alien things moved. Nothing else moved in the woods around him. He turned his face up to the falling snow and let it come soothingly upon the awful wound in his side.  After a while he looked out at the monkey. It had risen to a sitting position but was frozen in the motion of rising. It had ceased to function when he hit the lump. Out of the numbness and the pain, he felt a great gladness rising.  The guide. He had killed the guide.         *       *       *       *       *  He would not be cautious any more. Maybe some of the other robots were self-directing and dangerous, but they could be handled. He went to the lump, stared at it without feeling. A black doughy bulge was swelling out through one of the holes.  It was too big to carry, but he would have to take something back. He went over and took the monkey by a stiff jutting arm and began dragging it back toward the village.  Now he began to stumble. It was dark and he was very tired. But the steel he had been forging in his breast was complete, and the days which were coming would be days full of living. He would walk with big shoulders and he would not bother to question, because Man was not born to live out his days at home, by the fire.  It was a very big thing that Dylan had learned and he could not express it, but he knew it all the same, knew it beyond understanding. And so he went home to his people.  One by one, increasing, in the wee black corner of space which Man had taken for his own, other men were learning. And the snow fell and the planets whirled, and, when it was spring where Dylan had fought, men were already leaping back out to the stars."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50863"],["title","Alien Minds (#0)"],["body","MINDS                            by E.

Nor could anyone, glancing at him, know he was not a native of this planet, Szstruyyah, which the Inter-Stellar Corpsmen, in self-defense, called \"Estrella.\" For the cosmetic-specialist who handled the secret servicemen's disguises had done a marvelous job in transforming the blond young Corpsman into an Estrellan native.  Hanlon continued looking into the outside cages containing these tailless roches, the Estrellan equivalent of wild dogs. \"I want eight, all as near the same size, coloring and age as possible.\"  \"Eight, did you say?\" the merchant looked at him in astonishment. Hanlon, carefully reading the surface of the man's mind, sensed the conflict there between the ethics his religion and philosophy had taught him, his natural love of haggling, and a desire to make as much profit as possible. But he could not sense the slightest suspicion that the man confronting him was not another Estrellan.  This was a great relief to Hanlon, for he was still afraid he might be recognized as a stranger and an alien. In his disguise he was still humanoid in shape, and still his five feet eleven inches in height. But in addition to the ragged beard and longish hair, he had undergone outward structural differences that made him seem almost totally unhuman.  \"That's right. Eight. I want them to be about two years old, in good health. Can you supply them?\"  \"I can if you can pay for them,\" the native looked somewhat questioningly at Hanlon's cheap clothing.  The young secret serviceman smiled, and jingled coins in his pocket. \"I can pay.\"  \"Then come with me, nyer, and we will find the ones you want.\"  Hanlon followed him inside the peculiar little open-faced stall that was one of the hundreds surrounding the great market square of this city of Stearra, largest on the West Continent of Estrella. His nose wrinkled against the stench of the uncleaned kennels.  The roches, seeing a stranger and, perhaps, being somewhat upset by his strange, alien effluvia, set up the peculiar, frenzied yelping that was their customary sound. To Hanlon, it was reminiscent of the wail of earthly coyotes.  The young Corpsman was on a very hair-trigger of caution and tenseness. Despite his splendid disguise, he had plodded through the crowd of the market place with a great deal of trepidation.  He had seemingly come through all right so far, and he began to relax a bit, yet was still somewhat fearful that he might give himself away by some difference of action, or speech, or by breaking one of their customs or taboos about which he knew all too little, despite his briefing and study before coming here.  \"Have you decided which ones you want, nyer?\" the proprietor asked, waving his hand toward the various cages, hardly able to believe he was to make such a large sale.  Hanlon said nothing, continuing to scan closely the roches, for his thoughts were still very much on this, his first prolonged venture into the streets and among the crowds of this strange new world to which he had been assigned on his second problem.  His mind was constantly contacting others, for George Spencer Newton Hanlon was the only member of the secret service who was at all able to read minds. But he could read only their surface thoughts--and these Estrellans had such peculiar mental processes, so different from those of the humans with whom he was familiar, that they were almost non-understandable.  So he was still a bit hesitant to start the bickering he knew he must engage in to stay in character. To delay a bit further he continued examining the animals in the cages, not only with his eyes but mentally scanning the brain of each, that he might be sure of finding those in perfect health, with minds he could most easily control.  \"Though how I can expect to find healthy ones in a filthy dump like this, I don't know,\" he thought. But he finally did.  While he was doing this, however, he was reminded of the time he had discovered this ability to \"read\" animal minds, and how his subsequent studies had enabled him to control their minds and bodily actions with amazing skill. It was this ability that had led him to this market place on his unusual quest.  \"I'll take that one, and that, and that,\" he said at last, pointing out, one after another, the eight animals he wanted.  \"Yes, nyer, yes,\" the puzzled but delighted proprietor said, as he transferred the indicated animals to a single, large cage. \"That will cost you ...\" he eyed Hanlon carefully to see if he could get away with an exorbitant price. Something seemed to tell him the stranger did not know just how much roches customarily sold for, and he decided to raise his asking price considerably. \"... they will be seven silver pentas each, nyer, and believe me, you are getting a fine price. I usually get ten each,\"--he was lucky to get two, Hanlon read in his mind--\"but since this is such a large sale I can afford to make you a bargain.\"  Hanlon grinned to himself as he computed quickly. Five iron pentas, he knew, made one copper penta, five coppers one tin penta, five of these one silver penta, and five silvers a gold one. This made the silver piece worth about one-half a Federation credit. The price seemed ridiculously low, even with this big mark-up. Hanlon would willingly have paid it, but he had learned from the briefing tapes, and again now from his reading of this merchant's mind, that they loved to haggle over their sales--made a sort of game of it--so he turned away, registering disgust.  \"A fool you think me, perhaps,\" he said witheringly. \"Seven silver pentas, indeed. One would be a great price for such ill-fed, scrawny, pitiable animals as those.\"  The merchant raised his hands and voice in simulated rage--which did not prevent him from running around to face Hanlon's retreating figure, and bar his way. \"'Robber', he calls me, then tries to rob me in turn. Six?\" he suggested hopefully.  Hanlon was now enjoying the game, and threw himself into it with vigor. \"I call on Zappa to witness that you are, indeed, the worst thief unhung,\" he also spoke loudly, angrily, largely for the benefit of the crowd of natives that was swiftly gathering to watch and listen to this sport. \"Look, that one is crooked of leg, this one's hair is ready to fall out, that one is fifteen years old if a day. I'll give you two.\"  Yet he knew all the animals were in perfect health, and all about two years old. He had carefully selected only such.  \"I ask anyone here,\" the seller wailed as he waved toward the crowd that was watching and listening with huge enjoyment, \"I ask anyone here who knows roches to examine these you have chosen. They are all exceptional, all perfect. The best in my shop. Five and a half.\"  Hanlon turned away again. \"I'll go find an _honest_ dealer,\" he started to push through the crowd, but the merchant hurried after him and grasped his smock. \"Wait, nyer, wait. It breaks my heart to do this. I'll lose a month's profit, but I'll sell them to you for five pentas each. To my best friend I wouldn't give a better price.\"  \"That shows why you have no friends. Three even, take it or leave it,\" Hanlon was still pretending indifference.  \"I'm ruined; I'll be forced out of business,\" the dealer screamed. \"They cost me more than that. Oh, why did I rise this morning. Give me four?\"  Hanlon grinned and dug out a handful of the pentagonal-shaped gold and silver pieces. He counted into the merchant's quivering but dirty hands the agreed-upon thirty-two pentas.  The native looked at them, wordlessly, but his face was a battleground of mixed emotions. Finally he reluctantly counted out half of them into his other hand, and held them out to Hanlon. \"No, nyer, I cannot over-charge you. Two is the price.\"  \"You're an honest man after all, and I apologize,\" Hanlon said, smiling, as he pushed back the outstretched hand. \"Those I chose are fine animals, perfect, and the best in your shop. So keep the money. Send them to my room this midday,\" he commanded. \"It's on the street of the Seven Moons, at the corner of the street of the Limping Caval--the house painted pink in front. Second floor to the rear. My name--Gor Anlo--is on the door.\"  He had taken that name on this planet since it most nearly corresponded to his own from among the common Estrellan names.  The roch-dealer, well pleased with the outcome, bobbed obsequiously. \"It shall be done as you say, nyer, and I shall include feeding and drinking dishes. What about food for them?\"  \"That's right, they'll need dishes, and thank you. Let's see your meat.\" But after examining the poor quality food the merchant displayed, he would not buy.  \"I'll get something elsewhere, if this is the best you have,\" Hanlon told the man with a disarming smile. \"Such"]]]
