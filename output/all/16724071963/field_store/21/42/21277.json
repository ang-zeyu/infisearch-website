Such a condition of course, shall not be. When Elijah restored this Priesthood, he said that the time spoken of had fully come, and that the dreadful day of the Lord was near, even at the doors.  Let us now see what Joseph Smith had to say in relation to this. Speaking of the baptism and salvation for the dead, he said:      \"The GREATEST RESPONSIBILITY in this world that God has laid upon     us, is to seek after our dead. The apostle says they without us     cannot be made perfect. Now I will speak of them: I say to you,     Paul, you cannot be perfect without us; it is necessary that those     who have gone before, and those who come after us should have     salvation in common with us, and thus hath God made it OBLIGATORY     to man. Hence God said He would send Elijah.\" (Times and Seasons,     6:616).  Moreover, at the conference held October, 1841, to which I have already referred, the prophet said this:      \"Baptism for the dead is the only way that men can appear as     saviors on Mount Zion. The proclamation of the first principles of     the gospel was a means of salvation to men individually, and it was     the truth, not men, that saved them; but men by actively engaging     in rites of salvation _substitutionally_, become instrumental in     bringing multitudes of their kin into the Kingdom of God.\"      \"This doctrine\"--that is, baptism for the dead--\"he said, presents     in a clear light the wisdom and mercy of God, in preparing an     ordinance for the salvation of the dead, being baptized by proxy,     their names recorded in heaven, and they judged according to the     deeds done in the body.\"  Now here comes the most important statement.      --\"This doctrine was the BURDEN OF THE SCRIPTURES. Those Saints     who NEGLECT it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at the     PERIL OF THEIR OWN SALVATION.\"  There we have the key to the whole situation. If we neglect the salvation of our dead when we have the opportunity to save them, then we ourselves will be rejected, and that is just what the revelation of January 19, 1841, says. In the Doctrine and Covenants, Section 128, verse 5, we are told that baptism for the dead was prepared from before the foundation of the world, \"for the salvation of the dead,\" mark this, \"WHO SHOULD DIE WITHOUT A KNOWLEDGE OF THE GOSPEL!\" And in verse 15:      \"And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you     that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living     that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation,     as Paul says concerning the fathers, 'that they without us cannot     be made perfect, neither can we without our dead be made perfect.'\"  Here we have it in this revelation that if we do not save our dead we cannot ourselves be saved, therefore if we neglect their salvation, we ourselves will be rejected. Now verse 18:      \"It is sufficient to know * * * that the earth will be smitten     with a curse, UNLESS there is a welding link of some kind or     other, between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or     other, and behold what is that subject? IT IS THE BAPTISM FOR THE     DEAD. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they     without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect     without those who have died in the Gospel also; for it is necessary     in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulnesss of times,     which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and     complete and perfect union and welding together of dispensations,     and keys, and powers, and glories, should take place, and be     revealed, from the days of Adam even to the present time; and not     only this, but those things which never have been revealed from     the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise     and prudent shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this the     dispensation of the fulness of times.\"   SALVATION FOR THE DEAD IMPORTANT.  Now, is it not plain to see how important this doctrine is, and why the Saints were to be rejected? But they were not rejected for they performed the baptisms for their dead, and are today performing the baptisms and the ordinances for and in behalf of their dead. Therefore they are not rejected. Again, the Prophet says that the Saints have not too much time to save and redeem their dead, and gather their living relatives together that they may be saved also, before the earth will be smitten, as revealed by Malachi. Therefore it is quite evident why the Lord permitted them to baptize in the river, and not wait until those ordinances could be performed in the Temple, and why He was so anxious that they should hurry and prepare a place in the Temple, where they could be performed in accordance with the plan from before the foundation of the world.  Here is another statement that I wish to refer to. In an editorial in the Times and Seasons written by the Prophet, in volume 3, pages 759-761, where he is speaking of the remarks made by the Savior to the Jews, that upon them should come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias, who was slain between the Temple and the altar, Joseph the Prophet declares in most emphatic terms that the reason why this blood was to come upon these Jews was, that:      \"They possessed greater privileges than any other generation, not     only as pertaining to themselves but to their dead, their sin was     greater as they not only neglected their own salvation but that     of their progenitors, and hence their blood was required at their     hands.\"  Now, if these Jews were to answer for the blood of their progenitors because they neglected the salvation of their dead, then, may we not ask; will not we have to answer for the blood of our dead if we neglect these ordinances in their behalf? It matters not even if we have been baptized and have had hands laid on our heads for the reception of the Holy Ghost; if we wilfully neglect the salvation of our dead, then also we shall stand rejected of the Lord because we have rejected our dead; and just so sure their blood will be required at our hands.  Now, what is the attitude of the \"Reorganized\" Church in relation to the salvation of the dead, the neglect of which the Church--yes, and also the individual--was to stand rejected of the Lord? I have here a copy of a resolution that was passed by the general conference of that sect in 1886, at the time that Mr. Briggs withdrew. This resolution is in reply to his charge that he could not accept the principle of \"baptism for the dead.\" Here it is:      \"That as to the alleged Temple building and ceremonial endowments     therein, that we know of no Temple building, except as edifices     wherein to worship God, and no endowment except the endowment of     the Holy Spirit of the kind experienced by the early Saints on     Pentecost day.\"      \"'Baptism for the dead' referred to belongs to those local     questions of which the body has said by resolution:      \"'That the commandments of a local character, given to the first     organization of the Church are binding on the Reorganization only     so far as they are either reiterated or referred to as binding by     commandment to this church. And _that_ principle has neither been     reiterated nor referred to as a commandment.\"  Just think of that! They declare that we were rejected because we failed to build a house where these ordinances were to be performed, and yet they actually have the audacity to say that the work of salvation for the dead is not binding on them because it has not been reiterated or referred to as a commandment binding on them. Now is that consistent? They call it a local commandment, yet we have seen that this commandment was the burden of the Scriptures and the greatest responsibility that God has placed upon us, and we are obliged to save our dead if we would ourselves be saved. And yet, this commandment without which the whole earth was to be utterly wasted and destroyed--this eternal commandment that had been prepared before the foundation of the world--is not binding on them! \"A local commandment!\" \"A permissive rite!\" My friends, from the teachings of Joseph Smith the Prophet, which I have presented, you may well judge which is the Church \"rejected with its dead.\"[14]   Footnotes  1. This statement that the Latter-day Saints were endeavoring to get beyond the jurisdiction of the United States, which is repeated so often by anti-\"Mormon\" writers and speakers, including many devotees of the \"Reorganization,\" who vainly attempt to prove the disloyalty of the Saints, is rather astonishing in the face of the facts of history. The exodus to the Rocky Mountains was undertaken _of necessity_, as it was from Missouri to Illinois, because the Saints had been ruthlessly driven from their homes by armed mobocrats. Notwithstanding this, the Church came to the Rocky Mountains because the Lord willed it so, for He permitted the expulsion from Nauvoo that His purposes might be fulfilled. The Prophet Joseph Smith, as early as 1842, received a revelation declaring that the Saints would be driven to these valleys. That revelation is found in the history of the Church for Saturday, August 6, 1842. Our friends the Reorganites, have themselves testified in their more sober moments to the truth of this grand prediction. In a history published by them in 1880, and which they said was \"the aim of the publishers to place within the reach of those who cared to know, a more correct standard from which to determine the character and work of Joseph Smith, the founder, under divine direction, of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,\" \"And is the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50357"],["title","Origin of the 'Reorganized' Church and the Question of Succession (#8)"],["body","book published by the (Reorganized) Church.\" They record the following:  \"Just at this time (1842) also occurred Joseph's first marked prophecy, on record, concerning the removal of the Saints to the Rocky Mountains. Says the Record:  \"Saturday 6th, (August, 1842). Passed over the river to Montrose, Iowa, in company with General Adams, Colonel Brewer, and others, and witnessed the installation of the officers of the Rising Sun Lodge of Ancient York Masons, at Montrose, by General James Adams, Deputy Grand Master of Illinois. While the Deputy Grand Master was engaged in giving the requisite instructions to the Master Elect, I had a conversation with a number of brethren, in the shade of the building, on the subject of our persecutions in Missouri, and the constant annoyance which has followed us since we were driven from the State. I prophesied that the Saints would continue to suffer much affliction, and would be driven to the Rocky Mountains, many would apostatize, others would be put to death by our persecutors, or lose their lives in consequence of exposure or disease, and some would live to go and assist in making settlements and building cities, and see the Saints become a mighty people in the midst of the Rocky Mountains.\"  \"The exodus is a great historic fact. It would do violence to history to expunge this record. The Twelve, however, may have shaped the record thus to fit their own events. It is not even affirmed that Joseph gave such a revelation to the Church; but the historical landmark, pointing to the Rocky Mountains, is this prophecy to his Masonic brethren, on the 6th of August, 1842, just about five years before the feet of the pioneers emerged from the last mountain gorge into the beautiful valley of the Great Salt Lake.\" (Tullidge's Life of Joseph Smith, Lamoni edition, page 398-9).  In February 1844 a company was selected to go and explore Oregon and California (Utah then being a portion of what was called \"Upper California,\") for the purpose of selecting a site where the Saints could build a city. The minutes of this meeting say: \"At a meeting of the Twelve, at the Mayor's office, Nauvoo, February 21, 1844, seven o'clock, p. m., Brigham Young, Parley P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, Wilford Woodruff, John Taylor, George A. Smith, Willard Richards and four others being present, called by previous notice, by instruction of President Joseph Smith on the 20th instant, for the purpose of selecting a company to explore Oregon and California, and select a site for a new city for the Saints.\"  Jonathan Dunham, Phineas H. Young, David D. Yearsley and David Fullmer, volunteered to go; and Alphonzo Young, James Emmett, George D. Watt, and Daniel Spencer were requested to go. These brethren were requested to meet with the council on the following Friday evening at the Assembly Room, and the history of the Prophet continues: \"Met with the Twelve in the Assembly Room (Friday 23rd) concerning the Oregon and California Exploring Expedition; Hyrum and Sidney present. I told them I wanted an exploration of all that mountain country. Perhaps it would be best to go direct to Santa Fe. Send twenty-five men: let them preach the Gospel wherever they go. Let that man go that can raise $500, a good horse and mule, a double-barrel gun, one barrel rifle, and the other smooth bore, a saddle and bridle, a pair of revolving pistols, bowie-knife, and a good saber. Appoint a leader, and let him beat up for volunteers. I want every man that goes to be a king and a priest. When he gets on the mountains he may want to talk with his God; when with the savage nations have power to govern, etc. If we don't get volunteers wait until after the election.\"  On this and other occasions shortly following, these volunteered to go: George D. Watt, Samuel Bent, Joseph A. Kelting, David Fullmer, James Emmett, Daniel Spencer, Samuel Rolfe, Daniel Avery, Samuel W. Richards, Almon L. Fuller, Hosea Stout, Thomas S. Edwards, Moses Smith and Rufus Beach. There were also others. It is also a fact that on the evening of June 22, 1844, because of persecution, the Prophet Joseph Smith, his brother Hyrum and a few others crossed the Mississippi river with the intention of going to the Rocky Mountains, beyond the persecutions of their enemies. The following day they were accused of cowardice by false friends who declared that they were fleeing from the flock in time of danger. This falsehood so wounded the Prophet who had stood in the breach from the beginning to protect the Saints, that he returned to Nauvoo, and gave himself up declaring that if his life was of no value to his friends, it was of none to himself. Four days later he suffered martyrdom, sealing his testimony with his blood.  Mr. George Derry, himself a Reorganite, in the Saints' Herald for January 31, 1906, in reply to the editor who doubted that any such intention as a settlement in the West was contemplated by Joseph Smith, wrote the following:  \"In reading the article in Saints' Herald, No. 46, 'The Editor at Home,' I got the impression that the writer was in doubt as to the correct statement of S. W. Richards that he was one of twenty-five men that were selected by Joseph Smith, Jr., to go out west to try to find a location for the Saints beyond the reach of mobs--a condition no doubt desirable in those trying times. S. W. Richards was president of the Church in the British Isles while I lived in London. I was president of a branch there and I was often brought in contact with other presiding officers as they met in council every month. The London conference was composed of forty-two branches, was often visited by the president of the mission and his counselors. I well remember S. W. Richards and others making the same statement at one of our monthly meetings, for they frequently dwelt at considerable length on the persecutions and trials of the Saints in that day. I believed the statements then--fifty-three years ago. I have no reason to reject it now. I have never heard it disproved. The testimony of S. W. Richards is as true in 1905 [See Era, Vol. 7, 927] as it was in 1853, that the company was organized. Recording the facts would not add to their _truthfulness_. I never heard that the company went west, but the company was _organized_, although conditions were changed.  \"In reading of the wonderful manifestations given in Kirtland, I find the following vision seen by Joseph Smith: 'I saw Brigham Young standing in a strange land in the far South and West in a desert place on a rock in the midst of about a dozen men of color. He was preaching to them in their own tongue. I saw the twelve apostles of the Lamb that _now are_ upon the earth standing together in a circle, much fatigued. I finally saw them in the celestial Kingdom of God.'  \"The conditions here stated very much resemble the conditions existing in Utah extending four hundred miles south of Salt Lake City. Here is certainly strong indication, if visions are reliable, that Brigham Young with the rest of the apostles would go to a strange land beyond the bounds of civilization. And in view of the mobbings and drivings they had to endure, is it any wonder that they should seek a quiet resting-place? Who shall say there was anything dishonorable in organizing a company by Joseph Smith, Jr., to seek out a quiet resting-place where they could be free to worship God in peace, none to make them afraid? The writer seems to have serious doubts as to the truth of the statements of the two men he met in Salt Lake City, because we have no record of the preparations made. I never heard it stated that the company did go west, because conditions changed, but the fact still remains--the company was formed, firearms and provisions were agreed upon, but as to what happened to change the program we have no record. But that the company was formed under the direction and choice of Joseph Smith is beyond doubt.\" As early as 1831, the Lord in a revelation (Doc. & Cov. 49:25) declared that \"Zion shall flourish upon the hills and rejoice upon the mountains, and shall be assembled together unto the place which I have appointed.\" When Brigham Young therefore, and the apostles, lead the Church to the valleys of the mountains, it was in fulfillment of the word of the Lord to Joseph Smith, uttered first, in March, 1831, second in August 1842, and moreover, it was but carrying out the design of the Prophet Joseph Smith. When men accuse the Saints of fleeing to the west desiring to get beyond the borders of the United States, and of being disloyal to the American government, they not only place themselves at variance with the facts of history, but utter a miserable falsehood that merits only the severest contempt. In B. H. Roberts' \"Succession,\" pages 109 to 126, a complete array of evidence regarding the exodus as outlined by Joseph Smith may be found.  2. In several of the revelations given to the Church in the beginning, the doctrine of common consent is made mandatory. In the revelation of April 6, 1830, the date of the organization of the Church--the Lord says: \"The elders are to receive their licenses from other elders, by vote of the Church (branch) to which they belong, or from the conferences.\" * * * * * No person is to be ordained to any office in this Church, where there is a regularly organized branch of the same, without the vote of that Church.\" In section 26, verse 2: \"All things shall be done by common consent in the Church, by much prayer and faith, for all things ye shall receive by faith.\" See also Sec. 124:144.  The Saints by vote accepted the Twelve Apostles as the presiding quorum of the Church at this special conference August 8, and again at the regular conference in October. This fact settled the matter of succession according to the revelations. These authorities and their successors, have been sustained at each conference of the Church, twice a year, and at the quarterly conferences of the various stakes four times a year "]]]
