Boyle, watching the first red tongue of flame lick out from the building behind, patted the serum case and set himself for the next step.  Immortality.         *       *       *       *       *  Locke took the helicar down through the mountains, skirting a clear swift river that broke into tumultuous falls a hundred yards below Boyle's cottage, and set it down in a flagstone court.  \"Out,\" Boyle ordered.  Moira met them in the spacious living room, her pretty face comical with surprise and dismay.  \"Philip, what's _happened_? You look so--\"  She saw the alien then and put a hand to her mouth.  \"Keep her quiet while I deal with Fermiirig,\" Boyle said to Locke. \"I have no time for argument. If either of you gives me any trouble....\"  He left the threat to Locke's stunned fancy and turned on the Alcorian.  \"Let me have the injection you had ready for Cornelison. Now.\"  The Alcorian moved his narrow shoulders in what might have been a shrug. \"You are making a mistake. You are not fitted for life beyond the normal span.\"  \"I didn't bring you here to moralize,\" Boyle said. \"If you mean to see your mate again, Fermiirig, give me the injection!\"  \"There was a time in your history when force was justifiable,\" Fermiirig said. \"But that time is gone. You are determined?\" He shook his head soberly when Boyle did not answer. \"I was afraid so.\"  He took the hypodermic needle out of its case, squeezed out a pale drop of liquid and slid the point into the exposed vein of Boyle's forearm.  Boyle, watching the slow depression of the plunger, asked: \"How long a period will this guarantee, in Earth time?\"  \"Seven hundred years,\" Fermiirig said. He withdrew the instrument and replaced it in its case, his liquid glance following Boyle's rising gesture with the freeze-gun. \"At the end of that time, the treatment may be renewed if facilities are available.\"  _Immortality!_  \"Then I won't need you any more,\" Boyle said, and rayed him down. \"Nor these other two.\"  Locke, characteristically, sprang up and tried to shield Moira with his own body. \"Boyle, what are you thinking of? You can't murder us without--\"  \"There's a very effective rapids a hundred yards down river,\" Boyle said. \"You'll both be quite satisfactorily dead after going through it, I think. Possibly unrecognizable, too, though that doesn't matter particularly.\"  He was pressing the firing stud, slowly because something in the tension of the moment appealed to the sadism in his nature, when an Orderman's freeze-beam caught him from behind and dropped him stiffly beside Fermiirig.         *       *       *       *       *  The details of his failure reached him later in his cell, anticlimactically, through a fat and pimply jailer inflated to bursting with the importance of guarding the first murderer in his generation.  \"AL&O kept this quiet until the Council killing,\" the turnkey said, \"but it had to come out when the Board of Order went after you. The Alcorians are telepathic. Santikh led the Ordermen to your place in the mountains. Fermiirig guided her.\"  He grinned vacuously at his prisoner, visibly pleased to impart information. \"Lucky for you we don't have capital punishment any more. As it is, you'll get maximum, but they can't give you more than life.\"  Lucky? The realization of what lay ahead of him stunned Boyle with a slow and dreadful certainty.  A sentence of life.  Seven hundred years.  Not immortality--  Eternity."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5089"],["title","Boris Godunov: a drama in verse (#0)"],["body","GODUNOV  A Drama in Verse  By Alexander Pushkin   Rendered into English verse by Alfred Hayes     DRAMATIS PERSONAE*    BORIS GODUNOV, afterwards Tsar.

PALACE OF THE KREMLIN  (FEBRUARY 20th, A.D. 1598)  PRINCE SHUISKY and VOROTINSKY     VOROTINSKY. To keep the city's peace, that is the task    Entrusted to us twain, but you forsooth    Have little need to watch; Moscow is empty;    The people to the Monastery have flocked    After the patriarch. What thinkest thou?    How will this trouble end?     SHUISKY.                 How will it end?    That is not hard to tell. A little more    The multitude will groan and wail, Boris    Pucker awhile his forehead, like a toper    Eyeing a glass of wine, and in the end    Will humbly of his graciousness consent    To take the crown; and then--and then will rule us    Just as before.     VOROTINSKY.   A month has flown already    Since, cloistered with his sister, he forsook    The world's affairs. None hitherto hath shaken    His purpose, not the patriarch, not the boyars    His counselors; their tears, their prayers he heeds not;    Deaf is he to the wail of Moscow, deaf    To the Great Council's voice; vainly they urged    The sorrowful nun-queen to consecrate    Boris to sovereignty; firm was his sister,    Inexorable as he; methinks Boris    Inspired her with this spirit. What if our ruler    Be sick in very deed of cares of state    And hath no strength to mount the throne? What    Say'st thou?     SHUISKY. I say that in that case the blood in vain    Flowed of the young tsarevich, that Dimitry    Might just as well be living.     VOROTINSKY.                 Fearful crime!    Is it beyond all doubt Boris contrived    The young boy's murder?     SHUISKY.              Who besides? Who else    Bribed Chepchugov in vain? Who sent in secret    The brothers Bityagovsky with Kachalov?    Myself was sent to Uglich, there to probe    This matter on the spot; fresh traces there    I found; the whole town bore witness to the crime;    With one accord the burghers all affirmed it;    And with a single word, when I returned,    I could have proved the secret villain's guilt.     VOROTINSKY. Why didst thou then not crush him?     SHUISKY.                        At the time,    I do confess, his unexpected calmness,    His shamelessness, dismayed me. Honestly    He looked me in the eyes; he questioned me    Closely, and I repeated to his face    The foolish tale himself had whispered to me.     VOROTINSKY. An ugly business, prince.     SHUISKY.                    What could I do?    Declare all to Feodor? But the tsar    Saw all things with the eyes of Godunov.    Heard all things with the ears of Godunov;    Grant even that I might have fully proved it,    Boris would have denied it there and then,    And I should have been haled away to prison,    And in good time--like mine own uncle--strangled    Within the silence of some deaf-walled dungeon.    I boast not when I say that, given occasion,    No penalty affrights me. I am no coward,    But also am no fool, and do not choose    Of my free will to walk into a halter.     VOROTINSKY. Monstrous misdeed! Listen; I warrant you    Remorse already gnaws the murderer;    Be sure the blood of that same innocent child    Will hinder him from mounting to the throne.     SHUISKY. That will not baulk him; Boris is not so timid!    What honour for ourselves, ay, for all Russia!    A slave of yesterday, a Tartar, son    By marriage of Maliuta, of a hangman,    Himself in soul a hangman, he to wear    The crown and robe of Monomakh!--     VOROTINSKY.                   You are right;    He is of lowly birth; we twain can boast    A nobler lineage.     SHUISKY.        Indeed we may!     VOROTINSKY. Let us remember, Shuisky, Vorotinsky    Are, let me say, born princes.     SHUISKY.                     Yea, born princes,    And of the blood of Rurik.     VOROTINSKY.              Listen, prince;    Then we, 'twould seem, should have the right to mount    Feodor's throne.     SHUISKY.       Rather than Godunov.     VOROTINSKY. In very truth 'twould seem so.     SHUISKY.                      And what then?    If still Boris pursue his crafty ways,    Let us contrive by skilful means to rouse    The people. Let them turn from Godunov;    Princes they have in plenty of their own;    Let them from out their number choose a tsar.     VOROTINSKY. Of us, Varyags in blood, there are full many,    But 'tis no easy thing for us to vie    With Godunov; the people are not wont    To recognise in us an ancient branch    Of their old warlike masters; long already    Have we our appanages forfeited,    Long served but as lieutenants of the tsars,    And he hath known, by fear, and love, and glory,    How to bewitch the people.     SHUISKY. (Looking through a window.) He has dared,    That's all--while we--Enough of this. Thou seest    Dispersedly the people are returning.    We'll go forthwith and learn what is resolved.     THE RED SQUARE  THE PEOPLE     1ST PERSON. He is inexorable! He thrust from him    Prelates, boyars, and Patriarch; in vain    Prostrate they fall; the splendour of the throne    Affrights him.     2ND PERSON.  O, my God, who is to rule us?    O, woe to us!     3RD PERSON. See! The Chief Minister    Is coming out to tell us what the Council    Has now resolved.     THE PEOPLE.     Silence! Silence! He speaks,    The Minister of State. Hush, hush! Give ear!     SHCHELKALOV. (From the Red Balcony.)    The Council have resolved for the last time    To put to proof the power of supplication    Upon our ruler's mournful soul. At dawn,    After a solemn service in the Kremlin,    The blessed Patriarch will go, preceded    By sacred banners, with the holy ikons    Of Donsky and Vladimir; with him go    The Council, courtiers, delegates, boyars,    And all the orthodox folk of Moscow; all    Will go to pray once more the queen to pity    Fatherless Moscow, and to consecrate    Boris unto the crown. Now to your homes    Go ye in peace: pray; and to Heaven shall rise    The heart's petition of the orthodox.     (The PEOPLE disperse.)     THE VIRGIN'S FIELD  THE NEW NUNNERY. The People.     1ST PERSON. To plead with the tsaritsa in her cell    Now are they gone. Thither have gone Boris,    The Patriarch, and a host of boyars.     2ND PERSON.                        What news?     3RD PERSON. Still is he obdurate; yet there is hope.     PEASANT WOMAN. (With a child.)    Drat you! Stop crying, or else the bogie-man    Will carry you off. Drat you, drat you! Stop crying!     1ST PERSON. Can't we slip through behind the fence?     2ND PERSON.                         Impossible!    No chance at all! Not only is the nunnery    Crowded; the precincts too are crammed with people.    Look what a sight! All Moscow has thronged here.    See! Fences, roofs, and every single storey    Of the Cathedral bell tower, the church-domes,    The very crosses are studded thick with people.     1ST PERSON. A goodly sight indeed!     2ND PERSON.                     What is that noise?     3RD PERSON. Listen! What noise is that?--The people groaned;    See there! They fall like waves, row upon row--    Again--again--Now, brother, 'tis our turn;    Be quick, down on your knees!     THE PEOPLE. (On their knees, groaning and wailing.)                                      Have pity on us,    Our father! O, rule over us! O, be    Father to us, and tsar!     1ST PERSON. (Sotto voce.) Why are they wailing?     2ND PERSON. How can we know? The boyars know well enough.    It's not our business.     PEASANT WOMAN. (With child.)                         Now, what's this? Just when    It ought to cry, the child stops crying. I'll show you!    Here comes the bogie-man! Cry, cry, you spoilt one!    (Throws it on the ground; the child screams.)    That's right, that's right!     1ST PERSON.               As everyone is crying,    We also, brother, will begin to cry.     2ND PERSON. Brother, I try my best, but can't.     1ST PERSON.                             Nor I.    Have you not got an onion?     2ND PERSON.              No; I'll wet    My eyes with spittle. What's up there now?     1ST PERSON.                      Who knows    What's going on?     THE PEOPLE.    The crown for him! He is tsar!    He has yielded!--Boris!--Our tsar!--Long live Boris!
