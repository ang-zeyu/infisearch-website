The recollection of the first night's work is still fresh in my memory: It was till half-past 5 o'clock in the morning, for which I received one shilling. Just think of it, boys! For ten hours' work I received twenty-four cents--all in cash! Would you not think \"hard times\" had come again if you had to labor so long for such a small amount, especially if you were endeavoring to save means to emigrate? From this time my employer agreed to pay me three halfpence an hour--three cents. Shortly after it was raised to twopence (four cents); then to threepence (six cents). The latter was the highest amount received by me for overwork.  Besides the money earned by overwork, I had a little pocket money given me out of my weekly wages. My mother was not aware that I devoted these means for emigration purposes, but had an idea I had some money saved up. It was the usual custom to go to town on Saturday evenings, and she believed a portion of my gains was spent there. In this she judged wrongly.  My companion, Richard, was working for Mr. Carter, the picture-frame maker. He, like myself, was saving money for the same purpose. He put away most of what he received from his parents as pocket money, and sometimes earned a little by overwork.  From the time my mother forbade my associating with the \"Mormons\" till the Spring of 1866 (three years) was an unpleasant period of my life. It is true the meetings of the Saints were times of refreshing to me, for I loved my religion; but the fear that my parents would discover my attachment to the Latter-day Saints was ever a source of dread. My home was no longer a home to me. Disobedience to my mother's wishes was ever a sore affliction.  Whenever there was an opportunity for my companion and myself to attend a Latter-day Saint meeting, we did so; but when we had not that privilege, if the weather was fine, we visited the cemetery, the docks, or other places of interest in Middlesbrough and vicinity. These were days which will not easily be forgotten.  In the early part of February, 1866, my mother received a letter from America, which stated that some of her relatives were desirous our family should come to reside with them, and intimated they would send our passage money to cross the ocean.  This was good news to my mother, as she was very anxious, and had been for some time, to go to that land. She was the only one of her father's family remaining in England, the rest having previously emigrated.  There was one thing which prevented our family from emigrating: I had three more years of my apprenticeship to serve. In an interview between Mr. Gould and my mother respecting canceling my indentures, he declined doing so. Under these circumstances it was thought best for the family to remain for a season.  Poor woman! She little contemplated that for the last three years and a half I had been carefully saving means to emigrate to Utah, and intended to leave the coming Spring!    CHAPTER IV.  RICHARD AND MYSELF DETERMINE TO EMIGRATE WITH THE SAINTS--RECEIVE BAPTISM--THE NOTIFICATION PAPERS--FIRST ATTEMPT TO LEAVE HOME.  In the Spring of 1866, Richard Sedgwick and myself fully resolved to leave our homes and emigrate to Utah. I had managed to get means enough to take me to the frontier, where the mule and ox teams started to cross the plains to Salt Lake. Richard had only sufficient to take him to New York, where he expected to stay awhile and then proceed to Utah. The time for our departure was drawing near, and we very anxiously looked forward to it with great interest.  As it was my intention to soon leave for Utah, it was deemed advisable by President Littlefair that I should get baptized. Accordingly, on the morning of March 24, 1866, in the River Tees, that ordinance was attended to by Elder John Scott; and I was confirmed by President Littlefair in the afternoon.  My parents knew nothing about it. Nearly every Sunday morning I was in the habit of going early for milk to a small village called Newport. That morning I proceeded as usual, taking with me a small tin bucket. I went to the residence of the Scott family and called for William and others of the family. Richard also accompanied us. On starting out, it commenced to rain, but by the time we arrived at the river side it cleared up. About half a dozen were present. After singing a hymn, prayer was offered and baptism was performed. Another hymn was sung and we started homeward, chatting pleasantly together.  Richard was baptized a few days later. Arrangements were made that William, Richard and myself should sail on the third ship that season, the _American Congress_, and accordingly we sent our deposit money to secure a berth on that vessel. Every day we were expecting our notification papers, which would inform us what day the ship would start. They came on the 13th of May of that year.  We held meeting that day at Sister Jane Scott's, at whose house the meetings were held from the time the Scott family arrived in Middlesbrough, in 1863. Just prior to the arrival of Thomas Watson, clerk of the branch, I was remarking on the heat of the room. On his entry, William H. Scott asked him:  \"Have you brought the _Millennial Stars?_\"  \"Yes,\" said Brother Watson, \"and the notification papers, too.\"  As soon as he uttered these words a nervous feeling crept over me; I felt cold and went to the fire place to warm me.  We held our usual testimony meeting, and among those who bore testimony to the truth of the latter-day work I was one, and while doing so the tears trickled down my cheeks.  The notification papers stated that the _American Congress_ would sail from London on the 23rd of May, which gave us ten days' notice.  A day or two after this William H. Scott received a letter, stating that a small company of Saints would leave Sunderland by steamer on the next Saturday morning, May 19th, for London, from which place the _American Congress_ had to leave on the 23rd of that month. We thought this would be a good opportunity to go on this route, as it was much cheaper by this means than by rail. To do this we would have to leave Middlesbrough on the evening of May 18th, five days before the ship would sail.  We were in a rather peculiar situation, and wondered what excuse we could give our parents and employers to be absent a few days without them suspecting our intentions.  To make matters worse, our right-hand man, William H. Scott, received a letter from President Brigham Young, Jr., at Liverpool, assigning him a mission. This was unpleasant news to both Richard and myself, for to start on our journey without him was almost like being left without a shepherd.  As it could not be avoided, however, we determined to make the best of it and leave on Friday evening, the 18th.  On Wednesday evening, the 16th, I broached the subject of being away two days. I told my parents I wished to go with Richard Sedgwick to Hartlepool the following Friday, on a visit to some of his friends, and return on the following Sunday evening. My father was a little opposed to my going, but my mother was favorably inclined. Hartlepool was about twelve miles from Middlesbrough, and Sunderland was over forty.  Having secured the consent of my parents to be away from home two days, the next thing was to see my employer. It so happened that we were very busy at the printing business, and to ask for a holiday would be almost absurd. We were bent on leaving on the Friday night, and go we must. But what bothered me most was what excuse I could give my employer to be away. To tell him the same story as I had told my parents would hardly do, as he might say I could go there some other time when we were not quite so busy. Finally, on Thursday, the 17th, I saw Mr. Gould and told him I wished to go and see some of my relatives at Bradford, who were going to remove from that place and desired to see me before they left. I asked leave of absence from 4 o'clock Friday evening till Monday morning. Mr. Gould granted my request.  It was much easier for Richard to get permission to be away a few days than it was for me. He told his parents and his employer that he wanted to go to Hartlepool, and his wish was granted without any particular questions being asked.  After Mr. Gould granted my request, he paid me my full week's wages and gave me a shilling for pocket money. He was in the habit of giving me sixpence a week as pocket money, but this time he was kind enough to give me double the amount. I thanked him for his kindness. Mr. Gould had been kind to me ever since I entered his employ, and now that I was about to leave him, expecting never more to see him again, reflections of an unpleasant nature crossed my mind.  On reaching home I quickly put on my Sunday clothes and was soon ready to start, but became so confused as to forget to bid the folks good-by. Just as I was near the door, my mother said:  \"What! are you going off without bidding us good-by?\"  I turned quickly around and said:  \"Good-by! Good-by!\"  They watched me as I left the door. I hurried on my journey and was soon out of sight.    CHAPTER V.  ARRIVAL AT SUNDERLAND--ON THE STEAMER \"GENERAL HAVELOCK\"--IN LONDON--ON BOARD THE \"AMERICAN CONGRESS\"--UNPLEASANT NEWS--A MEETING OF THE SAINTS--AN AWFUL SURPRISE--\"I WANT YOU!\"--TAKEN PRISONERS.  I went down to a steamboat landing, crossed the River Tees in a small steamer and waited there nearly half an hour, when Richard came. He brought with him our box, which contained a bed-quilt, some books and other articles.  On this side of the river was the Port Clarence railway station, where, after securing our tickets, we took the train for Sunderland.  We arrived at the latter place about 7:30 p.m. After some little trouble we found President George J. Linford, who was staying at a Brother Inglefield's. We procured lodgings for the night, for which we paid fourpence (eight cents) each.  Early next morning we went on board the steamer _General Havelock_. Quite a "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/49401"],["title","Eventful Narratives (#3)"],["body","of Saints (between fifty and sixty) embarked on the steamer; they hailed from Newcastle, Sunderland and other places.  About 8 o'clock the steamer started. It was pleasant sailing. This was the first time we had been on sea. Richard and I enjoyed ourselves and felt very happy. We were pleased to be away from home and soon made intimate acquaintance with the Saints, finding among them many good-hearted people. We had some interesting conversation which helped to pass away the time.  The following day we arrived in the great metropolis--London--about half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon.  During the forenoon of the next day President Linford informed us we could go on board the _American Congress_, but said he did not know whether we could sail on that vessel or not. He told us that shortly after we left Sunderland on the Saturday morning, a telegram came there from Brigham Young, Jr., asking him not to let the Saints start, but for them to wait till the next ship was ready.  In the evening of that day, President Linford went to Liverpool to see Brother Young and make final arrangements about sailing.  This was rather unpleasant news to Richard and myself, for if we could not go with that ship, it would be expensive to wait two or three weeks till the next vessel started; in fact, we did not have means to do so. Not only this, but we were in suspense about being away, for we were afraid we might be captured and taken back to our homes.  In the forenoon of that day we went down to St. Catherine's Docks and got on board the _American Congress_.  The next morning Bro. Barker Childs, one of the Saints who sailed with us from Sunderland, asked me a rather curious question. Said he:  \"What would you think if you were taken off the ship?\"  I replied: \"I don't know.\"  Shortly after this, President Linford came.  \"Good morning,\" said Barker.  \"Good morning,\" responded Linford.  \"Well,\" said Barker, \"what's the news? Have we to stay here or not?\"  \"You can go with this vessel,\" replied President Linford.  This was good news to all of us who had sailed from Sunderland, and we felt to rejoice when he told us.  Late in the afternoon of Wednesday the ship was towed down the river to Shadwell Basin, and word was passed around that she would sail early next morning.  About 7 o'clock in the evening a meeting of the Saints was held on the deck. There were some good, soul-stirring hymns sung, and addresses were delivered by Elders John Nicholson and N. H. Felt.  While the services were in progress quite a crowd of spectators were viewing us from the shore, and among them was a short, stout man, who gazed intently at Richard and I.  After the meeting was over we both went below to our bunk, where we anxiously awaited the morrow to come, when we would be out on the ocean beyond all danger of pursuit. The ship was well filled with passengers--every berth being taken.  Early next morning we were up in good time. I walked about the cabin and on the deck with a feeling of gloom over me. I told Richard of my foreboding of something unpleasant, but what it was I could not tell. The sailors were busy preparing for the long voyage, and we expected soon to start.  About half past 7 o'clock I went off the ship to get a supply of water. Returning, I came near to where Richard was on deck, and said:  \"Here's the water; now let's go and get breakfast.\"  No sooner had I said these words than a noise occurred in the gangway, and the next moment a voice cried out:  \"That's one of them!\"  I had hardly time to turn around when a rough hand seized me by the collar. The next words I heard were:  \"I want you!\"  The person who spoke first was Mr. Thomas Carter, Richard's employer; the other speaker was a London detective, the man who watched us so closely the night previous at the meeting.  Mr. Carter then, in a quick tone, enquired:  \"Where's Richard?\"  \"He is there,\" I replied, pointing towards him as he stood close by, an eye-witness to what was going on.  The detective then seized him and pulled him towards me, taking from his breast coat pocket two summonses.  \"Robert Aveson,\" said he to me, \"Is that your name?\"  \"Yes,\" was my answer.  \"And Richard Sedgwick?\"  Richard responded to his name.  \"You have absconded from your apprenticeship,\" continued the detective. \"You thought no one could catch you, did you?\"  I replied, \"No.\"  Mr. Carter then asked Richard if he had any luggage, who replied in the negative.  I quickly said, \"I have.\"  Then we all went down into the cabin together.    CHAPTER VI.  THE SCENE IN THE CABIN--ONE OF THE SAINTS DEFENDS US AND IS THREATENED--JOHN NICHOLSON, PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY, COMES FORWARD--THE PARTING SCENE--GOOD BY TO THE SAINTS--TAKEN TO THE THAMES POLICE OFFICE--TRYING TO GET THE PASSAGE MONEY--LOCKED IN THE CELL.  On making our appearance in the cabin, the Saints rushed up to see what was the matter, and in a few seconds a large crowd gathered around. I jumped up in our bunk, commenced to get our things together and put in our box what articles I could.  One of the Saints, named Isaac Sutliffe, said to the detective:  \"What are you going to do with these boys?\"  The response came from the officer in a sharp tone:  \"We're going to take them away with us.\"  \"No you ain't,\" said Sutliffe in an emphatic manner  After further argument the detective said to Sutliffe:  \"If you don't hush up we'll take you, too.\"  At this juncture, John Nicholson, president of the company, came forward and asked what was the matter.  The detective answered:  \"We are going to take these boys away because they have absconded from their apprenticeship.\"  The officer then produced the papers and showed them to Brother Nicholson, who, after reading them, said:  \"That's all right. I did not know anything about the boys.\"  The officer then asked for our passage money. Brother Nicholson replied:  \"I cannot give you it; but the boys can get it by going to President Young's office at Islington.\"  Our ship tickets were then endorsed by Brother Nicholson, to the effect that the passage money had to be given to no one but the boys (Richard and myself).  Having our luggage ready for starting we disposed of our ship outfit to two of the Saints, the cost of which was about five shillings. We began to shake hands with the Saints, many of whom, with tears in their eyes, bade us a sad \"good-by.\" While thus engaged the detective seized me by the collar and pulling me towards the steps, said:  \"Come along, we can't wait for you!\"  With aching hearts away we went with our box, accompanied by Carter and the detective. Our destination was the Thames Police Office, which was about a mile distant. On arriving there, Carter and the detective left as soon as they had ordered breakfast for us.  There were two men in charge of the office, who took quite an interest in us and treated us very kindly.  Considering all things, the morning passed away very well. Something seemed to be whispering within me, \"It's all for the best.\" I told Richard so, and he said he felt the same.  We were made to feel worse by hearing a number of church bells ringing merrily, and upon enquiring the cause were informed it was the anniversary of the queen's birthday. The morning seemed a long one, and when dinner time came we were provided with a good meal of roast beef, potatoes, etc.  In the early afternoon we were taken in a hack to the office of President B. Young, Jr., at Islington, by Mr. Carter and the detective, whose object in taking us there was to endeavor to get our passage money and use it in paying the expenses of taking us back to our homes.  As we approached the office the detective asked for our ship tickets. I told him I would not give them up. There were three tickets--two to take us across the ocean, the other to take me to Wyoming, Nebraska.  Again the officer asked me for the tickets, which I still refused to give up. He said he would soon return them to me. On that condition I handed them to him with many misgivings. It was a severe trial to be taken back home; but to lose our hard-earned savings as well we felt keenly.  Arriving at our destination, inquiry was made for Brother Young, but we were informed that he was not there. We were invited in and told to wait a few minutes, when some gentlemen would see us; and soon Elders N. H. Felt, George Linford and other brethren made their appearance.  The officer then told them he wished to get the money for the ship tickets, whereupon the brethren returned to another room to hold council. In a few minutes they came and said that Brigham Young had gone to Liverpool, but if the boys (Richard and myself) would send their tickets to George J. Linford at Sunderland the money would be refunded. We were then taken back to the police office.  While on the way back, Carter got out of the hack. After he had gone the detective drew close to us and said he did not want us to think any the less of him for the part he had taken, as he had only done his duty. I told him it was all right, we knew it.  We arrived at the police office between 4 and 5 o'clock and shortly afterwards had our supper, after which I wrote a letter to George J. Linford and inclosed the three tickets. Just as it was finished, one of the men in charge of the jail said:  \"Come, mates, we must do our duty; you'll have to go into the cell.\"  \"All right,\" said I, and then asked him to post our letter, and he said he would.  We were then escorted into a cell. Some bed clothes were given us and we were told that anyone else would not have been allowed this privilege. They said if we wanted anything we were to shout for it. So they locked us up and went away.    CHAPTER VII.  HOW THE TIME WAS SPENT IN THE CELL--A TRUE TESTIMONY--AN OFFICER FROM MIDDLESBROUGH--HANDCUFFED--LEAVE LONDON--ARRIVAL AT MIDDLESBROUGH--THE POLICE OFFICE.  It was a small cell built of rock, with stationary scats around it. In the middle of the door was a square hole, with an extended ledge, "]]]
