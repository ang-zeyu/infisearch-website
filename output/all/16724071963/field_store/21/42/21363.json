Once they saw one of the huge tripeds in the distance, and stopped instantly, being very quiet as they slipped behind the boles of large trees, from which they peered out cautiously. But apparently the great beast had not heard, seen nor smelled them--it finally wandered away--grazing.  \"Well, I'll be a tadpole!\" Jon exclaimed. \"A grass-eater.\"  But Jak was not so sure. \"Lots of meat-eaters also eat a little grass. Those teeth didn't look like the ones of a herbivore. I think I'll keep away from them, anyway.\"  \"You and me both!\" Jon was agreeable to the idea.  At last, after nearly two hours, the two boys came to the banks of the stream, which was about a quarter mile wide at this point, and seemed not too deep, at least near the shore. Now it was Jon's turn to become the most excited. He ran to the edge and peered into the shallow depths, then called out delightedly at seeing dozens of darting forms of some type of marine life in the clear waters.  \"You watch while I fish,\" he commanded, dropping his gun and the two hare-like creatures. He took the carrying case from his shoulder, opened it and in moments had his rod, reel and line ready.  \"Yippee!\" he yelled as he got an immediate strike on his first cast. With true fisherman's skill, he played the now fighting, swiftly darting denizen of the river. Carefully he reeled in his catch, giving line when the fish ran or plunged, reeling in when he felt the least bit of slack, exerting only enough pressure to force the fish-thing in toward him without losing it.  Soon the wriggling creature was in shallow water, and Jon waded out with his landing net. A quick, darting movement with hand and net, and he had his first catch.  He took it carefully from the net and held it aloft, examining and admiring it, while Jak danced about on the shore near him, uttering shrill yelps of triumph.  They could see that Jon's catch was streamlined almost like a trout or barracuda. It was nearly fifteen inches long, and very slender. There seemed to be no scales--the skin was more like that of an eel or bullhead.  \"Fish or snake?\" Jak asked.  \"Don't know for sure.\" Jon was still studying it. \"Think it's a fish, all right, but it hasn't any fins, and swims with the same wriggles a snake uses. I think it's more eel than snake, though, and I'm quite sure it'll be good eating.\"  The mouth was large and ran back almost three and a half inches. When Jon pried it open to remove his hook he saw there was a triple row of needle-sharp teeth, so quickly took a pair of pliers from his tool belt, and used these to remove the deeply swallowed hook.  The eel-fish freed, he dropped it into his creel, then cast again. It was apparent these water denizens were unused to lures, for hardly had his spinner touched the surface of the water than he had another strike.  As swiftly as he could reel in and remove one from his hook and cast again, Jon brought in fish after fish. All this time Jak was dancing about, now as excited as his brother at this prospect of fresh food to replace for the time the nourishing but hardly-delectable concentrates and frozen foods on which they had been living for so long.  But when Jon finally was satisfied with the size of his catch, he found that leaving the river was not to be a simple matter of wading ashore. So intent had he been on his fun he had not noticed that his feet were sinking further and further into the bottom.  Only now, as he tried to return to shore, did he find he could not lift his feet. They were firmly embedded in the sand or muck, more than halfway to his knees.  For a long moment he struggled to pull first one foot and then the other from the clinging stuff. Then he realized he must be in a sort of quicksand, and he began to panic.  \"Quick, Jak, come help me! I'm caught.\"  But almost instantly he countermanded that sharply. \"No! Stay back. The bottom here's quicksand or something.\"  Jak had come running at Jon's first cry. At this warning, though, he slid to a halt just short of the water. \"How can I help?\" he cried anxiously.  \"Catch these first.\" And Jon threw first his rod, then his creel filled with fish.  Jak caught each and tossed them farther back onto the bank. He then looked quickly about, and spied a long, fallen branch at some little distance. He called to his brother, who was still trying desperately to free himself, \"Hang on a minute. I'll be right back.\"  Racing for the branch, he picked it up and brought it back to the water's edge. But when he extended it toward Jon, it was too short by several feet, even though both leaned forward. Jak would have gone into the water with it, but Jon would not let him.  \"We'll have to try something else, then.\" Jak was getting really worried now, for he could see that the water was up to Jon's waist.  \"You'll have to make it snappy,\" Jon spoke as calmly as he could. \"I'm sinking deeper all the time.\"  Again Jak searched swiftly and purposefully about him. He saw something he thought might help and ran swiftly toward one of the smaller trees. With difficulty, because of the scarcity of limbs, he climbed this and soon was hacking, with his machete-like knife, at the long, slender liana or climbing vine that hung downward from it. It took only a few moments to sever the top end, then Jak slid down the trunk and traced the vine to its root, cutting it there. With this long section he ran back to the water's edge.  \"Catch,\" he yelled--but it took several attempts before he could get the unwieldy vine-end near enough for Jon to grasp.  Jak dug his heels into the ground and started pulling. His face grew red, cords stood out in his neck, and his muscles bulged. But quickly the strain proved too great for him. Since he was the lighter and weaker he was being pulled toward the water, rather than freeing his embedded brother.  \"I ... can't ... do it,\" Jak panted, his strength gone, his muscles and limbs aching and trembling.  \"Tie your end around a tree. I'll try to work myself out.\"  Jak did so, and the muscles on Jon's more powerful arms, back and shoulders stood out in ridges as he threw all his splendid young strength into this climactic effort. He pulled, he wriggled about from side to side.  Slow, heartbreaking moments passed as the tug of war continued. Inch by hard-fought inch Jon was withdrawing his imprisoned legs from the sucking, gripping stuff that was so determined not to yield its victim.  But he was still only a boy, and he had neither the strength nor the endurance to continue for long this tremendous struggle. Slowly his efforts grew weaker and less successful. The sand began reclaiming that which it had lost. Before long Jon sank back, and the strain on the vine relaxed.  \"Can't ... make it. You've been a great brother....\" He tried to smile. \"Take care of Mom and Pop ... and break it to them gently.\"  \"Shut up, you dope,\" Jak yelled, but there was a catch in his voice. \"We're not licked yet!\"  Desperately his mind raced. He must think of some more effective mode of leverage. If only he knew how to handle the ship! He could bring that here, and with the loading winch in the lock drag his brother loose. But that was out--he didn't know how to handle it.  He thought of going after his mother, but realized quickly that before he got her and brought her back, Jon would be gone.  No, it was strictly up to him--and time was swiftly running out.     5   Jak Carver's eyes searched the edge of the jungle feverishly for any idea--for some means of rescuing his younger brother, embedded in the quicksand of the stream there.  Suddenly he spied a slim but stout-looking tree close to the water's edge ... and a trick the two boys had often played with a small tree in their back yard at home sprang into his mind.  \"Got an idea, Jon. Slack off a minute.\"  For Jon had been trying again and again, as he felt a momentary return of part of his strength, to pull himself free. He had, by this means, barely managed to keep from sinking further, but that was all.  Now, with a quick twist, Jak unfastened the end of the liana from the tree to which he had tied it. \"Tie your end about you, just under the arms,\" he called. Then, placing his end of the vine in his mouth and gripping it firmly with his teeth, he started climbing that slim tree. It was about seven inches in diameter at the base, and some forty to forty-five feet tall.  His brother instantly recognized what he had in mind. So, as Jak climbed, Jon made sure his end was securely fastened about him. Then he grasped the vine firmly with both hands, a few inches in front of his chest.  As Jak climbed ever higher into the tree, the slender sapling bent beneath his weight. He still climbed, but carefully now, on the side nearest the water, so the treetop would bend in that direction. The higher he climbed the tree, the more his weight made it curve downward, so that toward the last, his back was almost parallel to the ground.  Holding with his legs wrapped about the trunk, when he was almost three-quarters of the way up, Jak fastened his end of the liana tautly in place. This was extremely difficult because of his unnatural position, as well as the stiffness of the vine and his having to work with one hand. But without wasting time, he took pains to make sure the knot was tight and secure.  Then he started climbing again, further and further toward the slender top of the now bent tree. But carefully, lest his weight and the bending splinter or snap the treetop as it bent still further.  \"Get tight, Jon. Be ready for the yank when I let go.\"  \"All set and line tight. Yell when you drop.\"  Glancing down to see that the way was clear below him, Jak let his legs go and swung by his arms until he was hanging clear. He yelled sharply and let go--plunging down the fifteen or eighteen feet to the ground.  Disregarding the shock, he scrambled up, and peered closely at the tree, then the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/507"],["title","Adam Bede (#0)"],["body","Bede  by George Eliot   CONTENTS   Book First  Chapter I — The Workshop  Chapter II — The Preaching  Chapter III — After the Preaching  Chapter IV — Home and Its Sorrows  Chapter V — The Rector  Chapter VI — The Hall Farm  Chapter VII — The Dairy  Chapter VIII — A Vocation  Chapter IX — Hetty’s World  Chapter X — Dinah Visits Lisbeth  Chapter XI — In the Cottage  Chapter XII — In the Wood  Chapter XIII — Evening in the Wood  Chapter XIV — The Return Home  Chapter XV — The Two Bed-Chambers  Chapter XVI — Links   Book Second  Chapter XVII — In Which the Story Pauses a Little  Chapter XVIII — Church  Chapter XIX — Adam on a Working Day  Chapter XX — Adam Visits the Hall Farm  Chapter XXI — The Night-School and the Schoolmaster   Book Third  Chapter XXII — Going to the Birthday Feast  Chapter XXIII — Dinner-Time  Chapter XXIV — The Health-Drinking  Chapter XXV — The Games  Chapter XXVI — The Dance   Book Fourth  Chapter XXVII — A Crisis  Chapter XXVIII — A Dilemma  Chapter XXIX — The Next Morning  Chapter XXX — The Delivery of the Letter  Chapter XXXI — In Hetty’s Bed-Chamber  Chapter XXXII — Mrs. Poyser “Has Her Say Out”  Chapter XXXIII — More Links  Chapter XXXIV — The Betrothal  Chapter XXXV — The Hidden Dread   Book Fifth  Chapter XXXVI — The Journey of Hope  Chapter XXXVII — The Journey in Despair  Chapter XXXVIII — The Quest  Chapter XXXIX — The Tidings  Chapter XL — The Bitter Waters Spread  Chapter XLI — The Eve of the Trial  Chapter XLII — The Morning of the Trial  Chapter XLIII — The Verdict  Chapter XLIV — Arthur’s Return  Chapter XLV — In the Prison  Chapter XLVI — The Hours of Suspense  Chapter XLVII — The Last Moment  Chapter XLVIII — Another Meeting in the Wood   Book Sixth  Chapter XLIX — At the Hall Farm  Chapter L — In the Cottage  Chapter LI — Sunday Morning  Chapter LII — Adam and Dinah  Chapter LIII — The Harvest Supper  Chapter LIV — The Meeting on the Hill  Chapter LV — Marriage Bells   Epilogue     Book First     Chapter I The Workshop   With a single drop of ink for a mirror, the Egyptian sorcerer undertakes to reveal to any chance comer far-reaching visions of the past. This is what I undertake to do for you, reader. With this drop of ink at the end of my pen, I will show you the roomy workshop of Mr. Jonathan Burge, carpenter and builder, in the village of Hayslope, as it appeared on the eighteenth of June, in the year of our Lord 1799.  The afternoon sun was warm on the five workmen there, busy upon doors and window-frames and wainscoting. A scent of pine-wood from a tentlike pile of planks outside the open door mingled itself with the scent of the elder-bushes which were spreading their summer snow close to the open window opposite; the slanting sunbeams shone through the transparent shavings that flew before the steady plane, and lit up the fine grain of the oak panelling which stood propped against the wall. On a heap of those soft shavings a rough, grey shepherd dog had made himself a pleasant bed, and was lying with his nose between his fore-paws, occasionally wrinkling his brows to cast a glance at the tallest of the five workmen, who was carving a shield in the centre of a wooden mantelpiece. It was to this workman that the strong barytone belonged which was heard above the sound of plane and hammer singing—  Awake, my soul, and with the sun Thy daily stage of duty run; Shake off dull sloth...   Here some measurement was to be taken which required more concentrated attention, and the sonorous voice subsided into a low whistle; but it presently broke out again with renewed vigour—  Let all thy converse be sincere, Thy conscience as the noonday clear.   Such a voice could only come from a broad chest, and the broad chest belonged to a large-boned, muscular man nearly six feet high, with a back so flat and a head so well poised that when he drew himself up to take a more distant survey of his work, he had the air of a soldier standing at ease. The sleeve rolled up above the elbow showed an arm that was likely to win the prize for feats of strength; yet the long supple hand, with its broad finger-tips, looked ready for works of skill. In his tall stalwartness Adam Bede was a Saxon, and justified his name; but the jet-black hair, made the more noticeable by its contrast with the light paper cap, and the keen glance of the dark eyes that shone from under strongly marked, prominent and mobile eyebrows, indicated a mixture of Celtic blood. The face was large and roughly hewn, and when in repose had no other beauty than such as belongs to an expression of good-humoured honest intelligence.  It is clear at a glance that the next workman is Adam’s brother. He is nearly as tall; he has the same type of features, the same hue of hair and complexion; but the strength of the family likeness seems only to render more conspicuous the remarkable difference of expression both in form and face. Seth’s broad shoulders have a slight stoop; his eyes are grey; his eyebrows have less prominence and more repose than his brother’s; and his glance, instead of being keen, is confiding and benign. He has thrown off his paper cap, and you see that his hair is not thick and straight, like Adam’s, but thin and wavy, allowing you to discern the exact contour of a coronal arch that predominates very decidedly over the brow.  The idle tramps always felt sure they could get a copper from Seth; they scarcely ever spoke to Adam.  The concert of the tools and Adam’s voice was at last broken by Seth, who, lifting the door at which he had been working intently, placed it against the wall, and said, “There! I’ve finished my door to-day, anyhow.”  The workmen all looked up; Jim Salt, a burly, red-haired man known as Sandy Jim, paused from his planing, and Adam said to Seth, with a sharp glance of surprise, “What! Dost think thee’st finished the door?”  “Aye, sure,” said Seth, with answering surprise; “what’s awanting to’t?”  A loud roar of laughter from the other three workmen made Seth look round confusedly. Adam did not join in the laughter, but there was a slight smile on his face as he said, in a gentler tone than before, “Why, thee’st forgot the panels.”  The laughter burst out afresh as Seth clapped his hands to his head, and coloured over brow and crown.  “Hoorray!” shouted a small lithe fellow called Wiry Ben, running forward and seizing the door. “We’ll hang up th’ door at fur end o’ th’ shop an’ write on’t ‘Seth Bede, the Methody, his work.’ Here, Jim, lend’s hould o’ th’ red pot.”  “Nonsense!” said Adam. “Let it alone, Ben Cranage. You’ll mayhap be making such a slip yourself some day; you’ll laugh o’ th’ other side o’ your mouth then.”  “Catch me at it, Adam. It’ll be a good while afore my head’s full o’ th’ Methodies,” said Ben.  “Nay, but it’s often full o’ drink, and that’s worse.”  Ben, however, had now got the “red pot” in his hand, and was about to begin writing his inscription, making, by way of preliminary, an imaginary S in the air.  “Let it alone, will you?” Adam called out, laying down his tools, striding up to Ben, and seizing his right shoulder. “Let it alone, or I’ll shake the soul out o’ your body.”  Ben shook in Adam’s iron grasp, but, like a plucky small man as he was, he didn’t mean to give in. With his left hand he snatched the brush from his powerless right, and made a movement as if he would perform the feat of writing with his left. In a moment Adam turned him round, seized his other shoulder, and, pushing him along, pinned him against the wall. But now Seth spoke.  “Let be, Addy, let be. Ben will be joking. Why, he’s i’ the right to laugh at me—I canna help laughing at myself.”  “I shan’t loose him till he promises to let the door alone,” said Adam.  “Come, Ben, lad,” said Seth, in a persuasive tone, “don’t let’s have a quarrel about it. You know Adam will have his way. You may’s well try to turn a waggon in a narrow lane. Say you’ll leave the door alone, and make an end on’t.”  “I binna frighted at Adam,” said Ben, “but I donna mind sayin’ as I’ll let ’t alone at your askin’, Seth.”  “Come, that’s wise of you, Ben,” said Adam, laughing and relaxing his grasp.  They all returned to their work now; but Wiry Ben, having had the worst in the bodily contest, was bent on retrieving that humiliation by a success in sarcasm.  “Which was ye thinkin’ on, Seth,” he began—“the pretty parson’s face or her sarmunt, when ye forgot the panels?”  “Come and hear her, Ben,” said Seth, good-humouredly; “she’s going to preach on the Green to-night; happen ye’d get something to think on yourself then, instead o’ those wicked songs you’re so fond on. Ye might get religion, and that ’ud be the best day’s earnings y’ ever made.”  “All i’ good time for that, Seth; I’ll think about that when I’m a-goin’ to settle i’ life; bachelors doesn’t want such heavy earnin’s. Happen I shall do the coortin’ an’ the religion both together, as _ye_ do, Seth; but ye wouldna ha’ me get converted an’ chop in atween ye an’ the pretty preacher, an’ carry her aff?”  “No fear o’ that, Ben; she’s neither for you nor for me to win, I doubt. Only you come and hear her, and you won’t speak lightly on her again.”  “Well, I’m half a mind t’ ha’ a look at her to-night, if there isn’t good company at th’ Holly Bush. What’ll she take for her text? Happen ye can tell me, Seth, if so be as I shouldna come up i’ time for’t. Will’t be—what come ye out for to see? A prophetess? Yea, I say unto you, and more than a prophetess—a uncommon pretty young woman.”  “Come, Ben,” said Adam, rather sternly, “you let the words o’ the Bible alone; you’re going too far now.”  “What! Are _ye_ a-turnin’ roun’, Adam? I thought ye war dead again th’ women preachin’, a while agoo?”  “Nay, I’m not turnin’ noway. I said nought about the women preachin’. I said, You let the Bible alone: you’ve got a jest-book, han’t you, as you’re rare and proud on? Keep your dirty fingers to that.”  “Why, y’ are gettin’ as big a saint as Seth. Y’ are goin’ to th’ preachin’ to-nig"]]]
