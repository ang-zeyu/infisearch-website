As it was, all he could do was groan.  \"He's coming to,\" said the nurse.  \"Good,\" asserted Dr. Manson. \"Get a release, Nurse, and the minute he's capable of following directions, have him sign it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  In the corridor outside, two white-clad interns stopped at the door of Ollie's room and listened. They could not properly have been described as man and woman, but at any rate one was male and the other female. If you didn't look at them too closely, they seemed to be human, which, of course, was what they wanted you to think.  \"Just as I said,\" observed Zolto. \"They intend to operate. And their attention has already been drawn to the nut.\"  \"We can stop them by violence, if necessary. But I abhor violence.\"  \"I know, dear,\" Zolto said thoughtfully. \"What has happened is clear enough. He kept sending all that food through, and our people analyzed it and discovered what it was. They must have been surprised to discover no message from us, but after a while they arrived at the conclusion that we needed some of our own food and they sent it to us. It's a good thing that they didn't send more of it at one time.\"  \"The poor man must be in agony as it is.\"  \"Never mind the poor man. Think of our own situation.\"  \"But don't you see, Zolto? His digestive juices can't dissolve such unfamiliar chemical constituents, and his stomach must be greatly irritated.\"  She broke off for a moment as the nurse came past them, giving them only a casual glance. The X-ray specialist followed shortly, his face reflecting the bewilderment he felt as a result of studying the plate he was holding.  \"That leaves only Dr. Manson with him,\" said Zolto. \"Pojim, I have a plan. Do you have any of those pandigestive tablets with you?\"  \"I always carry them. I never know when in this world I'll run into something my stomach can't handle.\"  \"Fine.\" Zolto stepped back from the doorway, cleared his throat, and began to yell, \"Calling Dr. Manson! Dr. Manson, report to surgery!\"  \"You've been seeing too many of their movies,\" said Pojim.  But Zolto's trick worked. They heard Dr. Manson mutter, \"Damn!\" and saw him rush into the corridor. He passed them without even noticing that they were there.  \"We have him to ourselves,\" said Zolto. \"Quick, the tablets.\"  They stepped into the room, where Zolto passed a small inhalator back and forth under Ollie's nose. Ollie jerked away from it, and his eyes opened.  \"Take this,\" said Pojim, with a persuasive smile. \"It will ease your pain.\" And she put two tablets into Ollie's surprised mouth.  Automatically, Ollie swallowed and the tablets sped down to meet the collection in his stomach. Pojim gave him another smile, and then she and Zolto were out of the room.  To Ollie, things seemed to be happening in more and more bewildering fashion. No sooner had these strange doctors left than Dr. Manson came rushing back, cursing, in a way that would have shocked Hippocrates, the unknown idiot who had summoned him to surgery. Then the nurse came in, with a paper. Ollie gathered that he was being asked to sign something.  He shook his head vigorously. \"Not me. I don't sign _nothin'_, sister.\"  \"It's a matter of life and death. Your own life and death. We have to get those things out of your stomach.\"  \"No, sir, you're not cuttin' me open.\"  Dr. Manson gritted his teeth in frustration. \"You don't feel so much pain now because of the morphine I gave you. But it's going to wear off in a few minutes and then you'll be in agony again. You'll have to let us operate.\"  \"No, sir,\" repeated Ollie stubbornly. \"You're not cuttin' me open.\"  And then he almost leaped from his bed. His already distended stomach seemed to swell outward, and before the astonished eyes of doctor and nurse, a strange new bump appeared.  \"Help!\" yelled Ollie.  \"That's exactly what we're trying to do,\" said Dr. Manson angrily. \"Only you won't let us. Now sign that paper, man, and stop your nonsense.\"  Ollie groaned and signed. The next moment he was being rushed into the operating room.         *       *       *       *       *  The morphine was wearing off rapidly, and he lay, still groaning, on the table. From the ceiling, bright lights beat down upon him. Near his head the anesthetist stood with his cone of sleep poised in readiness. At one side a happy Dr. Manson was slipping rubber gloves on his antiseptic hands, while the attentive nurses and assistants waited.  Two interns were standing near the doorway. One of them, Zolto, said softly, \"We may have to use violence after all. They must not find it.\"  \"I should have given him a third tablet,\" said Pojim, the other intern, regretfully. \"Who would have suspected that the action would be so slow?\"  They fell silent. Zolto slipped a hand into his pocket and grasped the weapon, the one he had hoped he wouldn't have to use.  Dr. Manson nodded curtly and said, \"Anesthetic.\"  And then, as the anesthetist bent forward, it happened. Ollie's uncovered stomach, lying there in wait for the knife, seemed to heave and boil. Ollie shrieked and, as the assembled medicos watched in dazed fascination, the knobs and bumps smoothed out. The whole stomach began to shrink, like a cake falling in when some one has slammed the oven door. The pandigestive tablets had finally acted.  Ollie sat up. He forgot that he was wearing the skimpy and shameless nightgown, forgot, too, that he had a roomful of spectators. He pushed away the anesthetist who tried to stop him.  \"I feel fine,\" he said.  \"Lie down,\" ordered Dr. Manson sternly. \"We're going to operate and find out what's wrong with you.\"  \"You're not cuttin' into me,\" said Ollie. He swung his feet to the floor and stood up. \"There ain't nothin' wrong with me. I feel wonderful. For the first time in my life I ain't hungry, and I'm spoilin' for trouble. Don't nobody try to stop me.\"  He started to march across the floor, pushing his way through the protesting doctors.  \"This way,\" said one of the interns near the door. \"We'll get your clothes.\" Ollie looked at her in suspicion, but she went on, \"Remember? I'm the one who gave you the tablets to make the pain go away.\"  \"They sure worked,\" said Ollie happily, and allowed himself to be led along.  He heard the uproar behind him, but he paid no attention. Whatever they wanted, he was getting out of here, fast. There might have been trouble, but at a critical point the public address system swung into operation, thanks to the foresight of his intern friends, who had rigged up a special portable attachment to the microphone. It started calling Dr. Manson, calling Dr. Kolanyi, calling Dr. Pumber, and all the others.  In the confusion, Ollie escaped and found himself, for the first time in his life, a passenger in a taxicab. With him were the two friendly interns, no longer in white.  \"Just in case any more of those lumps appear in your stomach,\" said the female, \"you'd better take another couple of tablets.\"  She was so persuasive that Ollie put up only token resistance. The tablets went down his stomach, and then he settled back to enjoy the cab ride. It was only later that he wondered where they were taking him. By that time, he was too sleepy to wonder very much.  With the aid of the first two tablets, he had digested the equivalent of a tremendous meal. The blood coursed merrily in his veins and arteries, and he had a warm sensation of well-being.  As the taxi sped along, his eyes closed.         *       *       *       *       *  \"You transmitted the message in one of the latter tablets?\" asked Zolto in their native tongue.  \"I have explained all that has happened,\" replied his wife. \"They will stop sending food and wait for other directives.\"  \"Good. Now we'll have to get the transfer out of him as soon as possible. We ourselves can operate and he will never be the wiser.\"  \"I wonder,\" said Pojim. \"Once we have the transfer, it will only be a nuisance to us. We'll have to guard it carefully and be in continual fear of losing it. Perhaps it would be more sensible to leave it inside him.\"  \"Inside him? Pojim, my sweet, have you taken leave of your senses?\"  \"Not at all. It is easier to guard a man than a tiny object. I took a look at one of the X-ray plates, and it is clear that the transfer switch has adhered to his stomach. It will remain there indefinitely. Suppose we focus a transpositor on that stomach of his. Then, as the objects we want arrive from our own universe in their collapsed condition, we can transpose them into our laboratory, enlarge them, and send them off to Aldebaran, where they are needed.\"  \"But suppose that he and that stomach of his move around!\"  \"He will stay in one place if we treat him well. Don't you see, Zolto? He is a creature who has always lacked food. We shall supply him such food as his own kind have never dreamed of, complete with pandigestion fluid. At the same time, we shall set him to doing light work in order to keep him busy. Much of his task will involve studying and improving himself. And at night we shall receive the things we need from our own universe.\"  \"And when we have enough to supply the colony on Aldebaran II?\"  \"Then it will be time enough to remove the transfer switch.\"  Zolto laughed. It was a laugh that would have been curiously out of place in a human being, and if the taxi driver hadn't been so busy steering his way through traffic, he would have turned around to look. Pojim sensed the danger, and held up a warning finger.  Zolto subsided. \"You have remarkable ideas, my wife. Still, I see no reason why this should not work. Let us try it.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Ollie awoke to a new life. He was feeling better than he had ever felt in his entire miserable existence. The two interns who had come along with him had been transformed magically into a kindly lady and gentleman, who wished to hire him to do easy work at an excellent salary. Ollie let"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50796"],["title","Shipping Clerk (#3)"],["body"," be hired.  He had his choice of things to eat now, but, strangely enough, he no longer had his old hunger. It was as if he were being fed from some hidden source, and he ate, one might almost have said, for the looks of it. The little he did consume, however, seemed to go a long way.  He gained weight, his muscles hardened, his old teeth fell out and new ones appeared. He himself was astonished at this latter phenomenon, but after his previous experience at the hospital, he kept his astonishment to himself. The spots on his lungs disappeared, his spine straightened. After a time he reached a weight of a hundred and ninety pounds, and his eyes were bright and clear. At night he slept the sleep of the just--or the drugged.  At first he was happy. But after several months, there came a feeling of boredom. He sought out Mr. and Mrs. Zolto, and said, \"I'm sorry, I can't stay here any longer.\"  \"Why?\" asked the lady.  \"There's no room here, ma'am, for advancement,\" he said, almost apologetically. \"I've been studyin' and I got ideas about things I can do. All sorts of ideas.\"  Pojim and Zolto, who had planted the ideas, nodded solemnly.  Pojim said, \"We're glad to hear that, Ollie. The fact is that we ourselves had decided to move to--to a warmer climate, some distance away from here. We were wondering how you'd get along without us.\"  \"Don't you worry about me. I'll do fine.\"  \"Well, that's splendid. But it would be convenient to us if you could wait till tomorrow. We'd like to give you something to remember us by.\"  \"I'll be glad to wait, ma'am.\"  That night Ollie had a strange nightmare. He dreamed that he was on the operating table again, and that the doctors and nurses were once more closing in on him. He opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out. And then the two interns were there, once more wearing their uniforms.  The female said, \"It's all right. It's perfectly all right. We're just removing the transfer switch. In the morning you won't even remember what happened.\"  And, in fact, in the morning he didn't. He had only a vague feeling that something _had_ happened.  They shook hands with him and they gave him a very fine letter of reference, in case he tried to get another job, and Mrs. Zolto presented him with an envelope in which there were several bills whose size later made his eyes almost pop out of his head.  He walked down the street as if it belonged to him, or were going to. Gone was the slouch, gone the bleariness of the eyes, gone the hangdog look.  Gone was all memory of the dismal past.  And then Ollie had a strange feeling. At first it seemed so peculiar that he couldn't figure out what it was. It started in his stomach, which seemed to turn over and almost tie itself into a knot. He felt a twinge of pain and winced almost perceptibly.  It took him several minutes to realize what it was.  For the first time in months, he was hungry."]]]
