We got a planet-wide radar, and ain't no unidentified ships come near, not since we first landed more'n a year ago.\" He lifted the rifle and peered through the bore. \"Uh-uh. One of us did it.\"  The man had been thinking. And he knew the planet.  \"Telepathy?\" asked Dylan.  \"Might be.\"  \"Can't see it. You people live too close, you'd notice right away if one of you wasn't ... himself. And, if they've got one, why not all?\"  Rush calmly--at least outwardly calmly--lit his pipe. There was a strength in this man that Dylan had missed before.  \"Don't know,\" he said gruffly. \"But these are aliens, mister. And until I know different I'm keepin' an eye on my neighbor.\"  He gave Rossel a sour look and Rossel stared back, uncomprehending.  Then Rossel jumped. \"My God!\"  Dylan moved to quiet him. \"Look, is there any animal at all that ever comes near here that's as large as a dog?\"  After a pause, Rush answered. \"Yep, there's one. The viggle. It's like a reg'lar monkey but with four legs. Biology cleared 'em before we landed. We shoot one now and then when they get pesky.\" He rose slowly, the rifle held under his arm. \"I b'lieve we might just as well go post them sentries.\"  Dylan wanted to go on with this but there was nothing much else to say. Rossel went with them as far as the radio shack, with a strained expression on his face, to put through that call to Three.  When he was gone Rush asked Dylan, \"Where you want them sentries? I got Walt Halloran and Web Eggers and six others lined up.\"  Dylan stopped and looked around grimly at the circling wall of snow. \"You know the site better than I do. Post 'em in a ring, on rises, within calling distance. Have 'em check with each other every five minutes. I'll go help your people at the ship.\"  The gloomy man nodded and fluffed up his collar. \"Nice day for huntin',\" he said, and then he was gone with the snow quickly covering his footprints.         *       *       *       *       *  The Alien lay wrapped in a thick electric cocoon, buried in a wide warm room beneath the base of a tree. The tree served him as antennae; curiously he gazed into a small view-screen and watched the humans come. He saw them fan out, eight of them, and sink down in the snow. He saw that they were armed.  He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb a spiced lizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, he had been watching steadily, and now it was apparent that the humans were aware of their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave.  That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late that night and he could not, of course, press the assault by day. But _flexibility_, he reminded himself sternly, _is the first principle of absorption_, and therefore he moved to alter his plans. A projection reached out to dial several knobs on a large box before him, and the hour of assault was moved forward to dusk. A glance at the chronometer told him that it was already well into the night on Planet Three, and that the attack there had probably begun.  The Alien felt the first tenuous pulsing of anticipation. He lay quietly, watching the small square lights of windows against the snow, thanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so devised that he would not have to venture out into that miserable cold.  Presently an alarming thought struck him. These humans moved with uncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was distinctly possible that they could be gone before nightfall. He could take no chance, of course. He spun more dials and pressed a single button, and lay back again comfortably, warmly, to watch the disabling of the colonists' ship.         *       *       *       *       *  When Three did not answer, Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow, thinking of other things, and he called again. Several moments later the realization of what was happening struck him like a blow. Three had never once failed to answer. All they had to do when they heard the signal buzz was go into the radio shack and say hello. That was all they had to do. He called again and again, but nobody answered. There was no static and no interference and he didn't hear a thing. He checked frenziedly through his own apparatus and tried again, but the air was as dead as deep space. He raced out to tell Dylan.  Dylan accepted it. He had known none of the people on Three and what he felt now was a much greater urgency to be out of here. He said hopeful things to Rossel, and then went out to the ship and joined the men in lightening her. About the ship at least, he knew something and he was able to tell them what partitions and frames could go and what would have to stay or the ship would never get off the planet. But even stripped down, it couldn't take them all. When he knew that, he realized that he himself would have to stay here, for it was only then that he thought of Bossio.  Three was dead. Bossio had gone down there some time ago and, if Three was dead and Bossio had not called, then the fact was that Bossio was gone too. For a long, long moment Dylan stood rooted in the snow. More than the fact that he would have to stay here was the unspoken, unalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was dead--the one thing that Dylan could not accept. Bossio was the only friend he had. In all this dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his friendship and his trust.  He left the ship blindly and went back to the settlement. Now the people were quiet and really frightened, and some of the women were beginning to cry. He noticed now that they had begun to look at him with hope as he passed, and in his own grief, humanly, he swore.  Bossio--a big-grinning kid with no parents, no enemies, no grudges--Bossio was already dead because he had come out here and tried to help these people. People who had kicked or ignored him all the days of his life. And, in a short while, Dylan would also stay behind and die to save the life of somebody he never knew and who, twenty-four hours earlier, would have been ashamed to be found in his company. Now, when it was far, far too late, they were coming to the army for help.         *       *       *       *       *  But in the end, damn it, he could not hate these people. All they had ever wanted was peace, and even though they had never understood that the Universe is unknowable and that you must always have big shoulders, still they had always sought only for peace. If peace leads to no conflict at all and then decay, well, that was something that had to be learned. So he could not hate these people.  But he could not help them either. He turned from their eyes and went into the radio shack. It had begun to dawn on the women that they might be leaving without their husbands or sons, and he did not want to see the fierce struggle that he was sure would take place. He sat alone and tried, for the last time, to call Bossio.  After a while, an old woman found him and offered him coffee. It was a very decent thing to do, to think of him at a time like this, and he was so suddenly grateful he could only nod. The woman said that he must be cold in that thin army thing and that she had brought along a mackinaw for him. She poured the coffee and left him alone.  They were thinking of him now, he knew, because they were thinking of everyone who had to stay. Throw the dog a bone. Dammit, don't be like that, he told himself. He had not had anything to eat all day and the coffee was warm and strong. He decided he might be of some help at the ship.  It was stripped down now and they were loading. He was startled to see a great group of them standing in the snow, removing their clothes. Then he understood. The clothes of forty people would change the weight by enough to get a few more aboard. There was no fighting. Some of the women were almost hysterical and a few had refused to go and were still in their cabins, but the process was orderly. Children went automatically, as did the youngest husbands and all the women. The elders were shuffling around in the snow, waving their arms to keep themselves warm. Some of them were laughing to keep their spirits up.  In the end, the ship took forty-six people.  Rossel was one of the ones that would not be going. Dylan saw him standing by the airlock holding his wife in his arms, his face buried in her soft brown hair. A sense of great sympathy, totally unexpected, rose up in Dylan, and a little of the lostness of thirty years went slipping away. These were his people. It was a thing he had never understood before, because he had never once been among men in great trouble. He waited and watched, learning, trying to digest this while there was still time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and the airlock closed. But when the ship tried to lift, there was a sharp burning smell--she couldn't get off the ground.         *       *       *       *       *  Rush was sitting hunched over in the snow, his rifle across his knees. He was coated a thick white and if he hadn't spoken Dylan would have stumbled over him. Dylan took out his pistol and sat down.  \"What happened?\" Rush asked.  \"Lining burned out. She's being repaired.\"  \"Coincidence?\"  Dylan shook his head.  \"How long'll it take to fix?\"  \"Four--five hours.\"  \"It'll be night by then.\" Rush paused. \"I wonder.\"  \"Seems like they want to wait 'til dark.\"  \"That's what I was figurin'. Could be they ain't got much of a force.\"  Dylan shrugged. \"Also could mean they see better at night. Also could mean they move slow. Also could mean they want the least number of casualties.\"  Rush was quiet and the snow fell softly on his face, on his eyebrows, where it had begun to gather. At length he said, \"You got any idea how they got to the ship?\"  Dylan shook his head again. \"Nobody saw anything--but they were all pretty busy. Your theory about it maybe being one of us is "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50848"],["title","Soldier Boy (#3)"],["body","to look pretty good.\"  The colonist took off his gloves, lit a cigarette. The flame was strong and piercing and Dylan moved to check him, but stopped. It didn't make much difference. The aliens knew where they were.  And this is right where we're gonna be, he thought.  \"You know,\" he said suddenly, speaking mostly to himself, \"I been in the army thirty years, and this is the first time I was ever in a fight. Once in a while we used to chase smugglers--never caught any, their ships were new--used to cut out after unlicensed ships, used to do all kinds of piddling things like that. But I never shot at anybody.\"  Rush was looking off into the woods. \"Maybe the mail ship will come in.\"  Dylan nodded.  \"They got a franchise, dammit. They got to deliver as long as they's a colony here.\"  When Dylan didn't answer, he said almost appealingly: \"Some of those guys would walk barefoot through hell for a buck.\"  \"Maybe,\" Dylan said. After all, why not let him hope? There were four long hours left.         *       *       *       *       *  Now he began to look down into himself, curiously, because he himself was utterly without hope and yet he was no longer really afraid. It was a surprising thing when you looked at it coldly, and he guessed that, after all, it was because of the thirty years. A part of him had waited for this. Some crazy part of him was ready--even after all this time--even excited about being in a fight. Well, what the hell, he marveled. And then he realized that the rest of him was awakening too, and he saw that this job was really his ... that he had always been, in truth, a soldier.  Dylan sat, finding himself in the snow. Once long ago he had read about some fool who didn't want to die in bed, old and feeble. This character wanted to reach the height of his powers and then explode in a grand way--\"in Technicolor,\" the man had said. Explode in Technicolor. It was meant to be funny, of course, but he had always remembered it, and he realized now that that was a small part of what he was feeling. The rest of it was that he was a soldier.  _Barbarian_, said a small voice, _primitive._ But he couldn't listen.  \"Say, Cap,\" Rush was saying, \"it's getting a mite chilly. I understand you got a bottle.\"  \"Sure,\" he said cheerfully, \"near forgot it.\" He pulled it out and gave it to Rush. The colonist broke the seal and drank, saying to Dylan half-seriously, half-humorously: \"One for the road.\"  Beneath them the planet revolved and the night came on. They waited, speaking briefly, while the unseen sun went down. And faintly, dimly through the snow, they heard at last the muffled beating of a ship. It passed overhead and they were sighting their guns before they recognized it. It was the mailship.  They listened while she settled in a field by the camp, and Rush was pounding Dylan's arm. \"She will take us all,\" Rush was shouting, \"she'll take us all,\" and Dylan too was grinning, and then he saw a thing.         *       *       *       *       *  Small and shadowy, white-coated and almost invisible, the thing had come out of the woods and was moving toward them, bobbing and shuffling in the silent snow.  Dylan fired instinctively, because the thing had four arms and was coming right at him. He fired again. This time he hit it and the thing fell, but almost immediately it was up and lurching rapidly back into the trees. It was gone before Dylan could fire again.  They both lay flat in the snow, half-buried. From the camp there were now no sounds at all. For the first time today Dylan could hear the snow fall.  \"Did you get a good look?\"  Rush grunted, relaxing. \"Should've saved your fire, son. Looked like one o' them monkeys.\"  But there was something wrong. There was something that Dylan had heard in the quickness of the moment which he could not remember but which was very wrong.  \"Listen,\" he said, suddenly placing it. \"Dammit, that was no monkey.\"  \"Easy--\"  \"I hit it. I hit it cold. It made a _noise_.\"  Rush was staring at him.  \"Didn't you hear?\" Dylan cried.  \"No. Your gun was by my ear.\"  And then Dylan was up and running, hunched over, across the snow to where the thing had fallen. He had seen a piece of it break off when the bolt struck, and now in the snow he picked up a paw and brought it back to Rush. He saw right away there was no blood. The skin was real and furry all right but there was no blood. Because the bone was steel and the muscles were springs and the thing had been a robot.         *       *       *       *       *  The Alien rose up from his cot, whistling with annoyance. When that ship had come in, his attention had been distracted from one of the robots, and of course the miserable thing had gone blundering right out into the humans. He thought for a while that the humans would overlook it--the seeing was poor and they undoubtedly would still think of it as animal, even with its firing ports open--but then he checked the robot and saw that a piece was missing and knew that the humans had found it. Well, he thought unhappily, flowing into his suit, no chance now to disable that other ship. The humans would never let another animal near.  And therefore--for he was, above all, a flexible being--he would proceed to another plan. The settlement would have to be detonated. And for that he would have to leave his own shelter and go out in that miserable cold and lie down in one of his bunkers which was much farther away. No need to risk blowing himself up with his own bombs, but still, that awful cold.  He dismissed his regrets and buckled his suit into place. It carried him up the stairs and bore him out into the snow. After one whiff of the cold, he snapped his viewplate shut and immediately, as he had expected, it began to film with snow. Well, no matter, he would guide the unit by coordinates and it would find the bunker itself. No need for caution now. The plan was nearly ended.  In spite of his recent setback, the Alien lay back and allowed himself the satisfaction of a full tremble. The plan had worked very nearly to perfection, as of course it should, and he delighted in the contemplation of it.         *       *       *       *       *  When the humans were first detected, in the region of Bootes, much thought had gone into the proper method of learning their technology without being discovered themselves. There was little purpose in destroying the humans without first learning from them. Life was really a remarkable thing--one never knew what critical secrets a star-borne race possessed. Hence the robots. And it was an extraordinary plan, an elegant plan. The Alien trembled again.  The humans were moving outward toward the Rim, their base was apparently somewhere beyond Centaurus. Therefore, a ring of defense was thrown up on most of the habitable worlds toward which the humans were coming--oh, a delightful plan--and the humans came down one by one and never realized that there was any defense at all.  With a cleverness which was almost excruciating, the Aliens had carefully selected a number of animals native to each world, and then constructed robot duplicates. So simple then to place the robots down on a world with a single Director, then wait ... for the humans to inhabit. Naturally the humans screened all the animals and scouted a planet pretty thoroughly before they set up a colony. Naturally their snares and their hunters caught no robots, and never found the deep-buried Alien Director.  Then the humans relaxed and began to make homes, never realizing that in among the animals which gamboled playfully in the trees there was one which did not gambol, but watched. Never once noticing the monkey-like animals or the small thing like a rabbit which was a camera eye, or the thing like a rat which took chemical samples, or the thing like a lizard which cut wires.  The Alien rumbled on through the snow, trembling so much now with ecstasy and anticipation that the suit which bore him almost lost its balance. He very nearly fell over before he stopped trembling, and then he contained himself. In a little while, a very little while, there would be time enough for trembling.         *       *       *       *       *  \"They could've been here 'til the sun went out,\" Rush said, \"and we never would've known.\"  \"I wonder how much they've found out,\" Dylan said.  Rush was holding the paw.  \"Pretty near everything, I guess. This stuff don't stop at monkeys. Could be any size, any kind ... look, let's get down into camp and tell 'em.\"  Dylan rose slowly to a kneeling position, peering dazedly out into the far white trees. His mind was turning over and over, around and around, like a roulette wheel. But, at the center of his mind, there was one thought, and it was rising up slowly now, through the waste and waiting of the years. He felt a vague surprise.  \"Gettin' kind of dark,\" he said.  Rush swore. \"Let's go. Let's get out of here.\" He tugged once at Dylan's arm and started off on his knees.  Dylan said: \"Wait.\"  Rush stopped. Through the snow he tried to see Dylan's eyes. The soldier was still looking into the woods.  Dylan's voice was halting and almost inaudible. \"They know everything about us. We don't know anything about them. They're probably sittin' out there right now, a swarm of 'em there behind those trees, waitin' for it to get real nice and dark.\"  He paused. \"If I could get just one.\"  It was totally unexpected, to Dylan as well as Rush. The time for this sort of thing was past, the age was done, and for a long while neither of them fully understood.  \"C'mon,\" Rush said with exasperation.  Dylan shook his head, marveling at himself. \"I'll be with you in a little while.\"  Rush came near and looked questioningly into his face.  \"Listen,\" Dylan said hurriedly, \"we only need one. If we could just get one back to a lab we'd at least have some clue to what they are. This way we don't know anything. We can't just cut and run.\" He struggled with the unfamiliar, time-lost words.
