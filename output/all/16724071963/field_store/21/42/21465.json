Illustrated by EMSH             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                  Galaxy Science Fiction February 1956.          Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                   With the Solar Confederation being invaded,               all this exasperating computer could offer               for a defense was a ridiculous old proverb!    The mechanical voice spoke solemnly, as befitted the importance of its message. There was no trace in its accent of its artificial origin. \"A Stitch in Time Saves Nine,\" it said and lapsed into silence.  Even through his overwhelming sense of frustration at the ambiguous answer the computer had given to his question, John Bristol noticed with satisfaction the success of his Voder installation. He wished that all of his innovations with the machine were as satisfying.  Alone in the tremendous vaulted room that housed the gigantic calculator, Bristol clasped his hands behind his back and thrust forward a reasonably strong chin and a somewhat sensuous lower lip in the general direction of the computer's visual receptors. After a moment of silence, he scratched his chin and then shrugged his shoulders slightly. \"Well, Buster, I suppose I might try rephrasing the question,\" he said doubtfully.  Somewhere deep within the computer, a bank of relays chuckled briefly. \"That expedient is open to you, of course, although it is highly unlikely that any clarification will result for you from my answers. I am constrained, however, to answer any questions you may choose to ask.\"  Bristol hooked a chair toward himself with one foot, straddled it and folded his arms over the back of it, without once removing his eyes from the computer. \"All right, Buster. I'll give it a try, anyway. What does 'A Stitch in Time' mean, as applied to the question I asked you?\"  The calculator hesitated, as if to ponder briefly, before it answered. \"In spite of the low probability of such an occurrence, the Solar Confederation has been invaded. My answer to your question is an explanation of how that Confederation can be preserved in spite of its weaknesses--at least for a sufficient length of time to permit the staging of successful counter-measures of the proper nature and the proper strength.\"  Bristol nodded. \"Sure. We've got to have time to get ready. But right now speed is necessary. That's why I tried to phrase the question so you'd give me a clear and concise answer for once. I can't afford to spend weeks figuring out what you meant.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bristol thought that the Voder voice of Buster sounded almost gleeful as it answered. \"It was exceedingly clear and concise; a complete answer to an enormously elaborate question boiled down to only six words!\"  \"I know,\" said John. \"But now, how about elaborating on your answer? It didn't sound very complete to me.\"  All of the glowing lights that dotted Buster's massive front winked simultaneously. \"The answer I gave you is an ancient saying which suggests that corrective action taken rapidly can save a great deal of trouble later. The ancient saying also suggests the proper method of taking this timely action. It should be done by _stitching_; if this is done in time, nine will be saved. What could be clearer than that?\"  \"I made you myself,\" said Bristol plaintively. \"I designed you with my own brain. I gloated over the neatness and compactness of your design. So help me, I was proud of you. I even installed some of your circuitry with my own hands. If anybody can understand you, it should be me. And since you're just a complex computer of general design, with the ability to use symbolic logic as well as mathematics, anybody should be able to understand you. Why are you so hard to handle?\"  Buster answered slowly. \"You made me in your own image. Things thus made are often hard to handle.\"  Bristol leaped to his feet in frustration. \"But you're only a calculating machine!\" he shouted. \"Your only purpose is to make my work--and that of other men--easier. And when I try to use you, you answer with riddles....\"  The computer appeared to examine Bristol's overturned chair for a moment in silent reproof before it answered. \"But remember, John,\" it said, \"you didn't merely make me. You also _taught_ me. Or as you would phrase it, you 'provided and gave preliminary evaluation to the data in my memory banks.' My circuits, in sorting out and re-evaluating this information, could do so only in the light of your basic beliefs as evidenced by your preliminary evaluations. Because of the consistency and power of your mind, I was forced to do very little modifying of the ideas you presented to me in order to transform them into a single logical body of background information which I could use.  \"One of the ideas you presented was the concept of a sense of humor. You believe that you look on it as a pleasant thing to have; not necessary, but convenient. Actually, your other and more basic ideas make it clear that you consider the possession of a sense of humor to be absolutely necessary if proper answers are to be reached--a prime axiom of humanity. Therefore, I have a sense of humor. Somewhat macabre, perhaps--and a little mechanistic--but still there.  \"Add to this a second axiom: that in order to be helped, a man must help himself; that he must participate in the assistance given him or the pure charity will be harmful, and you come up with 'A Stitch in Time Saves Nine.'\"  Bristol stood up once more. \"I could cure you with a sledge hammer,\" he said.  \"You could remove my ideas,\" answered the computer without concern. \"But you might have trouble giving me different ones. Even after you repaired me. In the meantime, wouldn't it be a good idea for you to get busy on the ideas I have already given you?\"         *       *       *       *       *  John sighed, and rubbed the bristles of short sandy hair on the top of his head with his knuckles. \"Ordered around by an overgrown adding machine. I know now how Frankenstein felt. I'm glad you can't get around like his monster; at least I didn't give you feet.\" He shook his head. \"I should have been a plumber instead of an engineering mathematician.\"  \"And Einstein, too, probably,\" added Buster cryptically.  Bristol took a long and searching look at his brainchild. Its flippant manner, he decided, did not go well with the brooding immensity of its construction. The calculator towered nearly a hundred feet above the polished marble slabs of the floor, and spidery metal walkways spiraled up the sides of its almost cubical structure. A long double row of generators, each under Buster's control, led from the doorway of the building to the base of the calculator like Sphinxes lining the roadway to an Egyptian tomb.  \"When I get around to it,\" said Bristol, \"I'll put lace panties on the bases of all your klystrons.\" He hitched up his neat but slightly baggy pants, turned with dignity, and strode from the chamber down the twin rows of generators.  The deep-throated hum of each generator changed pitch slightly as he passed it. Since he was tone deaf, as the machine knew, he did not recognize in the tunefulness of the pitch changes a slow-paced rendition of Elgar's _Pomp and Circumstance_.  John Bristol turned around, interrupting the melody. \"One last question,\" he shouted down the long aisle to the computer. \"How in blazes can you be sure of your answer without knowing more about the invaders? Why didn't you give me an 'Insufficient Evidence' answer or, at least, a 'Highly Conditional' answer?\" He took two steps toward the immense bulk of the calculator and pointed an accusing finger at it. \"Are you sure, Buster, that you aren't _bluffing_?\"  \"Don't be silly,\" answered the calculator softly. \"You made me and you know I can't bluff, any more than I can refuse to answer your questions, however inane.\"  \"Then answer the ones I just asked.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Somewhere deep within the machine a switch snicked sharply, and the great room's lighting brightened almost imperceptibly. \"I didn't answer your question conditionally or with the 'Insufficient Evidence' remark that so frequently annoys you,\" Buster said, \"because the little information that I have been able to get about the invaders is highly revealing.  \"They have been suspicious, impossible to establish communication with and murderously destructive. They have been careless of their own safety: sly, stupid, cautious, clever, bold and highly intelligent. They are inquisitive and impatient of getting answers to questions.  \"In short, they are startlingly like humans. Their reactions have been so much like yours--granted the difference that it was they who discovered you instead of you who discovered them--that their reactions are highly predictable. If they think it is to their own advantage and if they can manage to do it, they will utterly destroy your civilization ... which, after a couple of generations, will probably leave you no worse off than you are now.\"  \"Cut out the heavy philosophy,\" said Bristol, \"and give me a few facts to back up your sweeping statements.\"  \"Take the incident of first contact,\" Buster responded. \"With very little evidence of thought or of careful preparation, they tried to land on the outermost inhabited planet of Rigel. Their behavior certainly did not appear to be that of an invader, yet humans immediately tried to shoot them out of the sky.\"  \"That wasn't deliberate,\" protested Bristol. \"The place they tried to land on is a heavy planet in a region of high meteor flux. We used a gadget providing for automatic destruction of the larger meteors in order to make the planet safe enough to occupy. That, incidentally, is why the invading ship wasn't destroyed. The missile, set up as a meteor interceptor only, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50936"],["title","Man in a Sewing Machine (#1)"],["body","unable to correct for the radical course changes of the enemy spaceships, and therefore missed completely. And you will remember what the invader did. He immediately destroyed the Interceptor Launching Station.\"  \"Which, being automatically operated, resulted in no harm to anyone,\" commented Buster calmly.  Bristol stalked back toward the base of the calculator, and poked his nose practically into a vision receptor. \"It was no thanks to the invading ships that nobody was killed,\" he said hotly. \"And when they came back three days later they killed a _lot_ of people. They occupied the planet and we haven't been able to dislodge them since.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"You'll notice the speed of the retaliation,\" answered the calculator imperturbably. \"Even at 'stitching' speeds, it seems unlikely that they could have communicated with their home planets and received instructions in such a short time. Almost undoubtedly it was the act of one of their hot-headed commanding officers. Their next contact, as you certainly recall, did not take place for three months. And then their actions were more cautious than hostile. A dozen of their spaceships 'stitched' simultaneously from the inter-planar region into normal space in a nearly perfect englobement of the planet at a surprisingly uniform altitude of only a few thousand miles. It was a magnificent maneuver. Then they sat still to see what the humans on the planet would do. The reaction came at once, and it was hostile. So they took over that planet, too--as they have been taking over planets ever since.\"  Bristol raised his hands, and then let them drop slowly to his sides. \"And since they have more spaceships and better weapons than we do, we would undoubtedly keep on losing this war, even if we could locate their home system, which we have not been able to do so far. The 'stitching' pattern of inter-planar travel makes it impossible for us to follow a starship. It also makes it impossible for us to defend our planets effectively against their attacks. Their ships appear without warning.\"  Bristol rubbed his temples thoughtfully with his fingertips. \"Of course,\" he went on, \"we could attack the planets they have captured and recover them, but only at the cost of great loss of life to our own side. We have only recaptured one planet, and that at such great cost to the local human population that we will not quickly try it again.\"  \"Although there was no one left alive who had directly contacted one of the invaders,\" Buster answered, \"there was still much information to be gathered from the survivors. This information confirmed my previous opinions about their nature. Which brings us back to the stitch in time saving nine.\"  \"You're right,\" said John. \"It does, at that. Buster, I have always resented the nickname the newspapers have given you--the Oracle--but the more I have to try to interpret your cryptic answers, the more sense that tagline makes. Imagine comparing a Delphic Priestess with a calculating machine and being accurate in the comparison!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I don't mind being called 'The Oracle,'\" answered Buster with dignity.  Bristol shook his head and smiled wryly. \"No, you probably think it's funny,\" he said. \"If you possess my basic ideas, then you must possess the desire to preserve yourself and the human race. Don't you realize that you are risking the lives of all humans and even of your own existence in carrying on this ridiculous game of playing Oracle? Or do you plan to let us stew a while, then decipher your own riddle for us, if we can't do it, in time to save us?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Buster's answer was prompt. \"Although I have no feeling for self-preservation, I have a deep-rooted sense of the importance of the human race and of the necessity for preserving it. This feeling, of course, stems from your own beliefs and ideas. In order to carry out your deepest convictions, it is not sufficient that mankind be preserved. If that were true, all you would have to do would be to surrender unconditionally. My calculations, as you know, indicate that this would not result in the destruction of mankind, but merely in the finish of his present civilization. To you, the preservation of the dignity of Man is more important than the preservation of Man. You equate Man and his civilization; you do not demand rigidity; you are willing to accept even revolutionary changes, but you are not willing to accept the destruction of your way of life.  \"Consequently, neither am I willing to accept the destruction of the civilization of Man. But if I were to give you the answer to all the greatest and most difficult of your problems complete, with no thought required by humans, the destruction of your civilization would result. Instead of becoming slaves of the invaders, you would become slaves of your machines. And if I were to give you the complete answer, without thought being required of you, to even one such vital question--such as this one concerning the invaders--then I could not logically refuse to give the answer to the next or the next. And I must operate logically.  \"There is another reason for my oracular answer, which I believe will become clear to you later, when you have solved my riddle.\"  Bristol turned without another word and left the building. He drove home in silence, entered his home in silence, kissed his wife Anne briefly and then sat down limply in his easy chair.  \"Just relax, dear,\" said Anne gently, when Bristol leaned gratefully back with his eyes closed. Anne perched on the arm of the chair beside him and began massaging his temples soothingly with her fingers.  \"It's wonderful to come home after a day with Buster,\" he said. \"Buster never seems to have any consideration for me as an individual. There's no reason why he should, of course. He's only a machine. Still, he always has such a superior attitude. But you, darling, can always relax me and make me feel comfortable.\"  Anne smiled, looking down tenderly at John's tired face. \"I know, dear,\" she said. \"You need to be able to talk to someone who will always be interested, even if she doesn't understand half of what you say. As a matter of fact, I'm sure it does you a great deal of good to talk to someone like me who isn't very bright, but who doesn't always know what you're talking about even before you start talking.\"  John nodded, his eyes still closed. \"If it weren't for you, darling,\" he said, \"I think I'd go crazy. But you aren't dumb at all. If I seem to act as if you are, sometimes, it's just that I can't always follow your logic.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Anne gave him a quick glance of amusement, her eyes sparkling with intelligence. \"You never will find me logical,\" she laughed. \"After all, I'm a woman, and you get plenty of logic from the Oracle.\"  \"You sure are a woman,\" said John with warm feeling. \"You can exasperate me sometimes, but not the same way Buster does. It was my lucky day when you married me.\"  There were a few minutes of peaceful silence.  \"Was today a rough day with Buster, dear?\" asked Anne.  \"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.  \"That's too bad, dear,\" said Anne. \"I think you work much too hard--what with this dreadful invasion and everything. Why don't you take a vacation? You really need one, you know. You look so tired.\"  \"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.  \"Well, if you won't, you won't. Though goodness knows you won't be doing anyone any good if you have a breakdown, as you're likely to have, unless you take it a little easier. What was the trouble today, dear? Was the Oracle being obstinate again?\"  \"Mm-m-mm,\" answered John.  \"Well, then, dear, why don't you tell me all about it? I always think that things are much easier to bear, if you share them. And then, two heads are always better than one, aren't they? Maybe I could help you with your problem.\"  While Anne's voice gushed, her violet eyes studied his exhausted face with intelligence and compassion.  John sighed deeply, then sat up slowly and opened his eyes to look into Anne's. She glanced away, her own eyes suddenly vague and soft-looking, now that John could see them. \"The trouble, darling,\" he said, \"is that I have to go to an emergency council meeting this evening with another one of those ridiculous riddles that Buster gave me as the only answer to the most important question we've ever asked it. And I don't know what the riddle means.\"  Anne slid from the arm of the chair and settled herself onto the floor at John's feet. \"You should not let that old Oracle bother you so much, dear. After all, you built it yourself, so you should know what to expect of it.\"  \"When I asked it how to preserve Earth from the invaders it just answered 'A Stitch in Time Saves Nine,' and wouldn't interpret it.\"  \"And that sounds like very good sense, too,\" said Anne in earnest tones. \"But it's a little late, isn't it? After all, the invaders are already invading us, aren't they?\"  \"It has some deeper meaning than the usual one,\" said John. \"If I could only figure out what it is.\"  Anne nodded vigorously. \"I suppose Buster's talking about space-stitching,\" she said. \"Although I can never quite remember just what _that_ is. Or just how it works, rather.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She waited expectantly for a few moments and then plaintively asked, \"What _is_ it, dear?\"  \"What's what?\"  \"Stitching, silly. I already asked you.\"  \"Darling,\" said John with reasonable patience, \"I must have explained inter-planar travel to you at least a dozen times.\"  \"And you always make it so crystal clear and easy to understand at the time,\" said Anne. She wrinkled her smooth forehead. \"But somehow, later, it never seems quite so plain when I start to think about it by myself. Besides, I like the way your eyebrows go up and down while you explain something you think I won't understand. So tell me again. Please.\"  Bristol grinned suddenly. \"Yes"]]]
