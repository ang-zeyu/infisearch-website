Persecution soon arose and raged so that, with her family who had now joined the Church, she left Kirtland, going to Davies Co., Mo. On the 10th of December, 1838, Miss Snow with her father's family, left Davies Co., the Mormons in that locality having been ordered by the Governor to leave the county within ten days.  \"They passed through almost unendurable sufferings, and reaching Far West found the Prophet and many others had been dragged to jail leaving their families destitute. March 1839, they left Far West leaving much of their property behind. Eliza and her sister stopped in Quincy, Ill., awhile. In July 1839, Miss Snow went to Commerce, (since called Nauvoo) to teach school. During her seven years' residence there she wrote much and advanced rapidly in her knowledge of the principles of the Gospel. Here, the Relief Society was organized by Joseph, March, 1842, and Sister Eliza was chosen for secretary.\" There are now three hundred branches of the Relief Society. \"Eliza was at this time the wife of the Prophet. In the latter part of July 1842, Mrs. Smith, President of the Relief Society, proposed a petition to Governor Carlin, asking his protection of Joseph. Sister Eliza, as secretary, wrote the petition which was signed by several hundred ladies, and in company with President Emma and Mrs. Warren Smith visited the Governor at his residence in Quincy, Adams Co., Ill., where they were most cordially received by the Governor. He replied to them, 'I believe Mr. Smith is innocent.' Soon after their return home they learned that the Governor in connection with Missouri officials was plotting the destruction of the lives of those noble men.  \"The Prophet and Patriarch were massacred! For awhile, thought of all else was forgotten but this overwhelming woe. But God gave them his sustaining love, and Eliza, widowed, turned again to the work Joseph had established, consecrating even her life to its service. The Temple was at length finished, and Sister Eliza then began another era, ministering in the Temple in the holy rites that pertain to the House of the Lord, as Priestess and Mother in Israel to hundreds of her sex.  \"In Feb., 1846, she left Nauvoo, on her way to the Rocky Mountains. At the middle Fork of Green River they stopped at one of the resting places. Here Sister Eliza and friends with whom the latter traveled, lived in a log house laid up like children's cob houses, with cracks from one to four inches wide. A tent cloth stretched over the top, blankets and carpets hung up inside as protection against the inclement weather. On the 19th of August when they were leaving here, they were minus a teamster. Sister Eliza undertook to drive ox team, and after some experience became an adept. August 27th they crossed the Missouri river, and on the 28th, arrived at Winter Quarters. From constant exposure and continued hardships Sister Eliza broke down. Fever set in, chills and fever followed; heavy rains came on and she was wet nearly from head to foot. She felt that she stood at the gates of death, it was but a step beyond, and once inside the portals she would be free from pain and suffering. But the great lifework lay before her, and she summoned courage and supreme faith to her aid. They moved into a log house partly finished, no chinking, no chimney. The fire was built on one side, and the room which had no floor was always filled with smoke. The cooking had to be done out of doors, the intense cold being preferable to the smoke.\" About the close of the year she received the sad news of the death of her mother.  \"April 7th, 1847, the pioneers under the direction of President Brigham Young started to find a gathering place for the Pilgrim Saints. In June Sister Eliza resumed her journey westward. Nursing the sick in tents and wagons, and burying the dead by the wayside in the wild desert were indeed mournful, yes, pitiful. On the 4th of August, several of the Mormon Battallion returning to Winter Quarters, met the Pilgrim Companies, and joyful indeed was the meeting for they were husbands, fathers, brothers and sons of women who were in those companies. They soon met the returning pioneers and heard of the resting place found, and arrived safely in the valley in October. Here Sister Eliza took up her abode with Mrs. Clara Decker Young. Shortly after, the Saints numbering six hundred arrived in the valley, a pole was erected and the _flag_ which had been preserved with the greatest care, was raised. * * As time passed on a place was selected and consecrated in which holy ordinances might be administered. Sister Eliza was called upon to take part, in which calling she has officiated up to the present. When the wards and settlements were pretty generally systematized, Pres. Young re-organized the Relief Society. He called on Sister Eliza to assist, and associate with her in the labor, Zina D. Young; this gave to them the precedence which they have since held.  \"At a Mass Meeting held in this city January 13th, 1870, in the Old Tabernacle, (where the Assembly Hall now stands) by about 6,000 women to protest against the 'Cullom Bill,' Sister Eliza made a strong and brilliant speech. Politically this was the turning point in the history of the women of Utah. A few weeks later and the women of Utah received the right of franchise. They will ever hold Governor S. A. Mann in special grateful remembrance. * * In 1854-5, the Lion House was completed and Sister Eliza has ever since resided there. It was some years later before the domestic spinning, dyeing and weaving were discontinued, in these things Sister Eliza also excelled.  \"In 1869, the Retrenchment Meetings were by the counsel of Pres. Young, organized. An association with a presiding board of seven officers. These meetings are still held in the Fourteenth Ward Assembly Rooms semi-monthly, at the same hour, the same ladies presiding, excepting Sister M. T. Smoot since removed to Provo. Here good instructions are given, and here the Junior Associations' secretaries bring the minutes of their respective Wards' Meetings, also the secretaries of the Primary Associations, (girls under twelve years of age, generally,) thus bringing together for mutual benefit an interchange of ideas, experience and suggestions, the aged veterans, the younger matrons and maidens, and little children.  \"October 26th, 1872, Sister Eliza left Salt Lake City on a journey to the Holy Land, her brother, Apostle Lorenzo Snow, joining her in Ogden. Pres. George A. Smith and party met them in New York. They took the steamer for Liverpool November 5th. In Rome Sister Eliza spent five days, visited Naples, Corfu, Alexandria, Cairo, Suez, Joppa, the plains of Sharon, the Valley of Ajelon became realized, and in due time they beheld Jerusalem. This tour through the Holy Land was a mission pertaining to the Latter Day Work. An account of the trip was published in book form, entitled 'Palestine Tourists.' Sunday, March 2nd, 1873, they ascended the Mount of Olives, and held service there after the manner of the Holy Priesthood as revealed in this dispensation. March 25th, embarked for Constantinople. Sister Eliza had been enduring twenty-nine days of tent life, and twenty-one of riding on horseback. And this in her seventieth year! At Athens they took tea with the American Minister, and met the American Consul General to Constantinople. They visited Munich then went to Vienna and thence to Hamburg. May 16th, 1873, they took steamer for London, and met the Saints in their Conference, May 25th. Embarked for home on the 28th. Returning early in July, she visited many old scenes and friends of her early life, received with honors from place to place. So quiet was her return to Utah, that four days elapsed before her many friends became aware of it. A brief rest sufficed, Sister Eliza could not be idle. She visited Ogden and Provo in August, Cache Valley in September, holding meetings in these and many other places.  \"Just after the October Conference of 1876, Sister Eliza entered upon the superintendency of the 'Woman's Store,' a Commission House for Utah home made goods. Officers and employees were women. During this year she prepared her second volume of poems for the press, also assisted in selecting and preparing the manuscript for the 'Women of Mormondom,' and in raising funds for its publication, and not least of all, gave the proof her attention. Also still continued her labors in the House of the Lord.\" At this time occurred the death of President Brigham Young. To one so disciplined in order, with such continuity of purpose, such adhesiveness to principle and friends, it would seem that to ordinary persons, the loss of one in whose house she had her place, and whose friendship and counsels she had shared for over twenty-five years, would be an overwhelming shock. But the same strength of mind which had risen from the martyrdom of the Prophet and Patriarch supported her again, and she \"renewed her diligence, if it were possible, in her broad field of labor.\" Political events and duties occupied her attention during December and January 1878. During the ensuing summer she traveled hundreds of miles, holding generally two meetings a day wherever they stopped. While attending a meeting at Farmington, Davis Co., the efforts of Sister Aurelia Spencer Rogers received her consideration and the Primary Associations, for children, became part of our system. \"The first Organization at Farmington dates from September 7th, 1878; about this time an Association was organized in the Eleventh Ward of this city, taking the lead.\" This new feature so suggestive of great benefit to the children so enlisted her feelings that she has visited most of the settlements"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50958"],["title","Representative Women of Deseret: A Book of Biographical Sketches (#2)"],["body","wards in this matter organizing Associations. Sister Eliza returned from a long tour of missionary labor just in time to preside at a grand Mass Meeting of 15,000 women, held in the Theatre, November 16th, 1878, in reply to representations of the Anti-Polygamic Society. The year 1880 was spent visiting the L. D. S. Women's Organizations, and the production of the Childrens Primary Hymn Book, soon followed by a tune book to accompany the above. On Saturday, July 17th, Fourteenth Ward Assembly Rooms, President John Taylor ordained Sister Eliza to the office to which she had been elected; President of Latter Day Saints' Women's Organizations throughout the world, wherever our people are; also, Sister Zina D. H. Young as her First Counselor, Elizabeth A. Whitney (since deceased) Second Counselor, Sarah M. Kimball as Secretary, and Mary Isabella Horne as Treasurer.  \"In August Sister Eliza visited Sanpete Co., and in Thistle Valley assisted the Bishop in organizing a Relief Society, with an Indian sister as a counselor; the first Indian woman ordained and set apart to an office in this dispensation. November 8th, Sister Eliza accompanied by Sister Zina D. Young, left home for St. George to do a work in the Temple. They traveled over one thousand miles in carriages and wagons, doing missionary work among the Saints. In St. George the anniversary of Sister Eliza's birthday was publicly celebrated, and on the same day the people of Weber Stake paid a delicate tribute to the honorable lady by a similar celebration at Ogden City.  \"Sisters Eliza and Zina returned from St. George March 31st, and were met at the depot by a party of thirty ladies who escorted them to the Lion House, where a reception, a welcome home, awaited them. In 1881, during the intervals of her many public duties, she prepared her new book Bible Questions and Answers. In September, visited Thistle Valley, organizing a Primary Association with ten little Indian children enrolled as members. April 1883, the Relief Society was organized among the Indians at Washakie, an Indian village in Box Elder Co. After duly considering the long-felt necessity among our own people of an institution for the sick and injured, where the ordinances of faith might be administered freely and without restraint, in fact, one that we might term our own, and as one of the links in our system of organizations, the sisters took a course that led to the establishment of the Deseret Hospital, at which institution the dedication services were held, July 17th, 1882, by the First Presidency, Stake Presidency, Apostles Wilford Woodruff and F. D. Richards; Mayor William Jennings, C. W. Penrose, Editor _Deseret News_, L. John Nuttall and Joseph Horne being present. Eliza R. S. Smith, President, E. B. Wells, Secretary.\"  I will conclude this brief sketch with one of her latest poems:    BURY ME QUIETLY WHEN I DIE.    When my spirit ascends to the world above,   To smile with the choirs in celestial love,   Let the finger of silence control the bell,   To restrain the chime of a funeral knell,   Let no mourning strain--not a sound be heard,   By which a pulse of the heart is stirred--   No note of sorrow to prompt a sigh;   Bury me quietly when I die.    I am aiming to earn a celestial crown--   To merit a heavenly; pure renown;   And, whether in grave or in tomb I'm laid,   Beneath the tall oak or the cypress shade;   Whether at home with dear friends around;   Or in distant lands upon stranger ground--   Under wintry clouds or a summer sky;   Bury me quietly when I die.    What avail the parade and the splendor here,   To a legal heir to a heavenly sphere?   To the heirs of salvation what is the worth,   In their perishing state, the frail things of earth?   What is death to the good, but an entrance gate   That is placed on the verge of a rich estate   Where commissioned escorts are waiting by?   Bury me quietly when I die.    On the \"iron rod\" I have laid my hold;   If I keep the faith, and like Paul of old   Shall have \"fought the good fight\" and Christ the Lord   Has a crown in store with a full reward   Of the holy priesthood in fulness rife,   With the gifts and the powers of an endless life,   And a glorious mansion for me on high;   Bury me quietly when I die.    Like a beacon that rises o'er ocean's wave,   There's a light--there's a life beyond the grave;   The future is bright and it beckons me on   Where the noble and pure and the brave have gone;   Those who have battled for truth with their mind and might,   With their garments clean and their armor bright;   They are dwelling with God in a world on high:   Bury me quietly when I die.    ZINA D. H. YOUNG,  FIRST COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE L. D. S. WOMEN'S ORGANIZATIONS.  \"And he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.\" How fitting are these sacred words to the subject of this sketch and her family. In obedience to this command renewed in this dispensation, searching through their genealogical records for ten generations back, they have brought forth to light, and to eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God, the forgotten and unknown ancestry of their family, finding now and then some noble representative of their race linked with even a kingdom's honor, and at last, far back, upon the throne of England.  Sister Zina's career of religious devotion and service is not a new feature in the Huntington family, nor America a new field of labor to them. One hundred years ago Lady Salina Huntington, saving to herself only sufficient for the real needs of life, devoted a great portion of her vast fortune to missionary service, for the introduction of Christianity among the North American Indians, by the founding of schools for the natives and the support of ministers and teachers. \"She allowed herself but one dress a year. Lady Salina Huntington was the second daughter of the Earl of Ferrars. She was born in 1707, and was the co-laborer of Whitefield and Wesley. 'The pedigree of Lady Huntington and her husband, and of George Washington, first President of the United States, (as traced by Mapleson in his researches) meet in the same parentage.' 'Lady Huntington and her chaplains often journeyed during the summer, making their presence a means of religious revivals wherever they went. A church needed. With her, to resolve was to accomplish. Her jewels she determined to offer to the Lord. They were sold for six hundred and ninety-eight pounds, and with this she erected a house of worship in 1760. Her daughter, Lady Salina, was one of the six earls daughters chosen to assist the Princess Augusta to bear the train of Queen Charlotte on her coronation day.\" Did it foreshadow an era of revelations dawning upon the world, when she prayed \"that God would give us new bread, not stale, but what was baked in the oven that day.\" Lady Huntington built seven chapels, her private property, beside aiding sixty others. At the age of eighty-four a few hours before the last struggle she whispered joyfully, \"I shall go to my Father tonight,\" and so she went home, June 17th, 1791.  Thus by birthright and by heritage is the land of Freedom the Huntingtons' field of religious labor. The mantles of Lady Huntington and remoter noble ancestors have at last been lifted from the silence and the shadows of departed centuries to the shoulders of worthy descendants and representatives, who are doing works of greater magnitude than they ever comprehended. Superintended by Dimock B. Huntington, and assisted by the family, Zina and her sister Prescinda have been baptized for ten generations, numbering nearly five thousand.  By permission I select from matter collected and published by Emmeline B. Wells, in _Woman's Exponent_ the following portions of biography:  \"Zina Diantha Huntington was born January 31st, 1821, at Watertown. Her father was William Huntington, her mother Zina Baker, whose father was one of the first physicians in New Hampshire. Her grandmother on the mother's side was Dorcas Dimock, 'descended from the noble family of Dimocks, whose representatives held the hereditary knight-championship of England; instance: Sir Edward Dymock, Queen Elizabeth's champion.'  \"The father of Mrs. Zina D. H. Young was also a patriot and served in the war of 1812. Samuel Huntington, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, was the uncle of this old revolutionary soldier. She says: 'My father's family is directly descended from Simon Huntington, the Puritan immigrant who sailed for America in 1633. He died at sea, but left three sons and his widow, Margaret. The church records of Roxbury, Mass., contain the earliest record of the Huntington name known in New England, and is in the handwriting of the Rev. John Elliot himself, the pastor of that ancient church. This is the record: 'Margaret Huntington, widow, came in 1633, her husband died by the way of small pox. She brought children with her.' 'My grandfather, Wm. Huntington, the revolutionary soldier, married Prescinda Lathrop, and was one of the first settlers in the Black River Valley, Northern New York. The Huntingtons and Lathrops intermarried, and my sister Prescinda Lathrop Huntington, bears the family name of generations.' The Huntingtons embraced the Gospel at Watertown, New York, and Zina D., when only fifteen years old was baptized by the Patriarch Hyrum Smith, August 14th, 1835, and soon after went to Kirtland with her father's family. In this year she received the gift of tongues. On one occasion in the Kirtland Temple she heard a whole invisible choir of angels singing, till the house seemed filled with numberless voices. At Kirtland she received the gift of interpretation. She was also at the memorable Pentecost when the spirit of God filled the house like a mighty, rushing wind. Zina was also a member of the Kirtland Temple Choir, of whom but few are now living."]]]
