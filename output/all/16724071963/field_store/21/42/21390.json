There was really nothing there to hold her attention but her curiosity was insatiable and childlike.  And in many ways she seemed immature. And that led to an elusive thought: what child was she? Not whose child--what child. Her actual parents were known, obscure technicians and mechanics, descendants themselves of a long line of mechanics and technicians. Not one notable or distinguished person among them, her family was decently unknown to fame or misfortune in every branch--until she'd come along. And what was her place, according to heredity? Docchi didn't know but he didn't share the official medical view.  With an effort Docchi stopped thinking about Nona. \"We appealed to the medicouncilor,\" he said. \"We asked for a ship to go to the nearest star, a rocket, naturally. Even allowing for a better design than we now have the journey will take a long time--forty or fifty years going and the same time back. That's entirely too long for a normal crew, but it wouldn't matter to us. You know what the Medicouncil did with that request. That's why we're here.\"  \"Why rockets?\" interrupted Jordan. \"Why not some form of that gravity drive you were talking about? Seems to me for travel over a long distance it would be much better.\"  \"As an idea it's very good,\" said Docchi. \"Theoretically there's no upper limit to the gravity drive except the velocity of light and even that's questionable. If it would work the time element could be cut in fractions. But the last twenty years have proved that gravity drives don't work at all outside the solar system. They work very well close to the sun, start acting up at the orbit of Venus and are no good at all from Earth on out.\"  \"Why don't they?\" asked Jordan. \"You said they used the same generator as passenger gravity. Those work away from the sun.\"  \"Sure they do,\" said Docchi impatiently. \"Like ours is working now? Actually ship internal gravity is more erratic than we had on the asteroid, and that's hardly reliable. For some reason the drive is always worse than passenger gravity. Don't ask me why. If I knew I wouldn't be on Handicap Haven. Arms or no arms, biocompensator or not, I'd be the most important scientist on Earth.\"  \"With multitudes of women competing for your affections,\" said Anti.  \"I think he'd settle for one,\" suggested Jordan.  \"Poor unimaginative man,\" said Anti. \"When I was young I was not so narrow in my outlook.\"  \"We've heard about your youth,\" said Jordan. \"I don't believe very much of it.\"  \"Talk about your youth and love affairs privately if you want but spare us the details. Especially now, since there are more important things to attend to.\" Docchi glowered at them. \"Anyway the gravity drive is out,\" he resumed. \"At one time they had hopes for it but no longer. The present function of the generator is to provide gravity _inside_ the ship, for passenger comfort. Nothing else.  \"So it is a rocket ship, slow and clumsy but reliable. It'll get us there. The Medicouncil refused us and so we'll have to go higher.\"  \"I'm all for it,\" said Anti. \"How do we get higher?\"  \"We've discussed it before,\" answered Docchi. \"The Medicouncil is responsible to the Solar Government, and in turn Solar has been known to yield to devious little pressures.\"  \"Or not so devious great big pressures. Fine. I'm in favor,\" said Anti. \"I just wanted to be sure.\"  \"Mars is close,\" continued Docchi. \"But Earth is more influential. Therefore I recommend it.\" His voice trailed off and he stopped and listened, listened.  Anti listened too but the sound was too faint for her hearing. \"What's the matter?\" she said. \"I think you're imagining things.\"  Jordan leaned forward in his seat and examined the instrument panel carefully before answering. \"That's the trouble, Anti. You're not supposed to _hear_ it, but you should be able to feel vibrations as long as the rocket's on.\"  \"I don't feel it either.\"  \"I know,\" said Jordan, looking at Docchi. \"I can't understand. There's plenty of fuel.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The momentum of the ship carried it along after the rockets stopped firing. They were still moving but not very fast and not in the direction they ultimately had to go. Gingerly Docchi tried out the magnetic shoes. He was clumsy but no longer helpless in the gravityless ship. He stared futilely at the instruments as if he could wring out more secrets than the panel had electronic access to.  \"It's mechanical trouble of some sort,\" he said uneasily. \"I don't know where to begin.\"  Before he could get to it Anti was in the passageway that led from the control compartment. \"Course I'm completely ignorant,\" she said. \"Seems to me we ought to start with the rocket tubes and trace the trouble from there.\"  \"I was going to,\" said Docchi. \"You stay here, Anti. I'll see what's wrong.\"  She reached nearly from the floor to the ceiling. She missed by scant inches the sides of the corridor. Locomotion was easy for her, turning around wasn't. So she didn't turn. \"Look, honey,\" her voice floated back. \"You brought me along for the ride. That's fine. I'm grateful but I'm not satisfied with just that. Seems to me I've got to earn my fare. You stay and run the ship. You and Jordan know how. I don't. I'll find out what's wrong.\"  \"But you won't know what to do.\"  \"I don't have to. You don't have to be a mechanic to see something's broken. I'll find it, and when I do you can come and fix it.\"  He knew when it was useless to argue with her. \"We'll both go,\" he said. \"Jordan will stay at the controls.\"  It was a dingy poorly lighted passageway in an older ship. Handicap Haven didn't rate the best equipment that was being produced, and even when it was new the ship had been no prize. On one side of the corridor was the hull of the ship; on the other a few small cabins. None were occupied. Anti stopped. The long hall ended in a cross corridor that led to the other side of the ship where a return passage led back to the control compartment.  \"We'll check the stern tubes,\" he said, still unable to see around her. \"Open the door and we'll look in.\"  \"Can't,\" said Anti. \"Tried to but the handle won't turn. There's a red light too. Does it mean anything?\"  He'd expected something like this but nevertheless his heart sank now that he was actually confronted with it. \"It does. Don't try again. With your strength you might be unlucky enough to open the door.\"  \"There's a man for you,\" said Anti. \"First you tell me to open it and then you don't want me to.\"  \"There's no air in the rear compartment, Anti. The combustion chamber's been retracted--that's why the rockets stopped firing. The air rushed out into space as soon as it happened. That's what the red light means.\"  \"We'd all die if I opened it now?\"  \"We would.\"  \"Then let's get busy and fix it.\"  \"We will. But we've got to make sure it doesn't happen again. You see, it wasn't accidental. Someone, or something, was responsible.\"  \"Are you sure?\"  \"Very sure. Did you see anyone while we were loading your tank in the ship?\"  \"Nothing. How could I? I heard Cameron shouting, other noise. But I couldn't see a thing that wasn't directly overhead, and there wasn't anything.\"  \"I thought so. A geepee _could_ have got in without anyone seeing him. I didn't count them but I was certain all of them had dropped outside. I was mistaken; one of them didn't.\"  \"Why does it have to be a geepee?\"  \"It just does, Anti. The combustion chamber was retracted while we were all in the control compartment. We didn't do it and therefore it had to be someone back here.  \"No man is strong enough to retract the cap, but if he somehow exerted superhuman effort, as soon as the chamber cleared the tubes rocket action would cease and the air in the compartment would exhaust into space.\"  \"So we have a dead geepee in the rocket compartment.\"  \"A geepee doesn't die or even become inactive. Lack of air doesn't hinder it in the least. Not only that, a geepee might be able to escape from the compartment. It's strong and fast enough to open the door against the pressure and get out and close it again in less than a second. We wouldn't notice it because the ship would automatically replenish the small amount of air that would escape.\"  Anti settled down grimly. \"Then there's a geepee on the loose, intent on wrecking us?\"  \"I'm afraid so.\"  \"Then what are we standing around for? All we have to do is go back to the controls and pick up the robot on the radio. We'll make it go in there and repair the damage it's done.\"  She partly turned around and saw Docchi's face. \"Don't tell me,\" she said, \"I should have thought of it. The radio doesn't work inside the ship.\"  Docchi nodded reluctantly. \"It doesn't. Robots are never used aboard and so the emergency band is broadcast by the bow antenna. The hull of the ship is a pretty good insulation.\"  \"Ain't that nice?\" said Anti happily. \"We've got a robot hunt ahead of us.\"  \"And our bare hands to hunt it with.\"  \"Oh come. It's not as hopeless as that. Look, the robot was back here when the rockets stopped. It couldn't get by the control compartment without our seeing it.\"  \"That's right. There are two corridors leading through the compartment, one on each side of the ship.\"  \"That's what I mean. We came down one and there wasn't any geepee. So it's got to be in the other. If it goes in a cabin a light will shine outside. It can't hide from us.\"  \"I don't doubt we'll find it. But what'll we do then?\"  \"I was thinking,\" said Anti. \"Can you get past me when I'm standing like this?\"  \"No.\"  \"That's what I thought. Neither can a geepee. All I need is a toaster, or something that looks like it. I'll drive the robot forward and Jordan can burn it down.\" Determinedly she began to move toward the far corridor. \"Hurry back to Jordan and tell him. There ought to be another weapon on the ship.

A. Henty     PREFACE.   MY DEAR LADS,  You are nowadays called upon to acquire so great a mass of learning and information in the period of life between the ages of twelve and eighteen that it is not surprising that but little time can be spared for the study of the history of foreign nations. Most lads are, therefore, lamentably ignorant of the leading events of even the most important epochs of Continental history, although, as many of these events have exercised a marked influence upon the existing state of affairs in Europe, a knowledge of them is far more useful, and, it may be said, far more interesting than that of the comparatively petty affairs of Athens, Sparta, Corinth, and Thebes.  Prominent among such epochs is the Thirty Years' War, which arose from the determination of the Emperor of Austria to crush out Protestantism throughout Germany. Since the invasion of the Huns no struggle which has taken place in Europe has approached this in the obstinacy of the fighting and the terrible sufferings which the war inflicted upon the people at large. During these thirty years the population of Germany decreased by nearly a third, and in some of the states half the towns and two-thirds of the villages absolutely disappeared.  The story of the Thirty Years' War is too long to be treated in one volume. Fortunately it divides itself naturally into two parts. The first begins with the entry of Sweden, under her chivalrous monarch Gustavus Adolphus, upon the struggle, and terminates with his death and that of his great rival Wallenstein. This portion of the war has been treated in the present story. The second period begins at the point when France assumed the leading part in the struggle, and concluded with the peace which secured liberty of conscience to the Protestants of Germany. This period I hope to treat some day in another story, so that you may have a complete picture of the war. The military events of the present tale, the battles, sieges, and operations, are all taken from the best authorities, while for the account of the special doings of Mackay's, afterwards Munro's Scottish Regiment, I am indebted to Mr. J. Grant's Life of Sir John Hepburn.  Yours sincerely,  G. A. HENTY     CHAPTER I THE INVITATION   It was late in the afternoon in the spring of the year 1630; the hilltops of the south of Scotland were covered with masses of cloud, and a fierce wind swept the driving rain before it with such force that it was not easy to make way against it. It had been raining for three days without intermission. Every little mountain burn had become a boiling torrent, while the rivers had risen above their banks and flooded the low lands in the valleys.  The shades of evening were closing in, when a lad of some sixteen years of age stood gazing across the swollen waters of the Nith rushing past in turbid flood. He scarce seemed conscious of the pouring rain; but with his lowland bonnet pressed down over his eyes, and his plaid wrapped tightly round him, he stood on a rising hummock of ground at the edge of the flood, and looked across the stream.  “If they are not here soon,” he said to himself, “they will not get across the Nith tonight. None but bold riders could do so now; but by what uncle says, Captain Hume must be that and more. Ah! here they come.”  As he spoke two horsemen rode down the opposite side of the valley and halted at the water's edge. The prospect was not a pleasant one. The river was sixty or seventy feet wide, and in the centre the water swept along in a raging current.  “You cannot cross here,” the boy shouted at the top of his voice. “You must go higher up where the water's deeper.”  The wind swept his words away, but his gestures were understood.  “The boy is telling us to go higher up,” said one of the horsemen.  “I suppose he is,” the other replied; “but here is the ford. You see the road we have travelled ends here, and I can see it again on the other side. It is getting dark, and were we to cross higher up we might lose our way and get bogged; it is years since I was here. What's the boy going to do now? Show us a place for crossing?”  The lad, on seeing the hesitation of the horsemen, had run along the bank up the stream, and to their surprise, when he had gone a little more than a hundred yards he dashed into the water. For a time the water was shallow, and he waded out until he reached the edge of the regular bank of the river, and then swam out into the current.  “Go back,” the horseman shouted; but his voice did not reach the swimmer, who, in a few strokes, was in the full force of the stream, and was soon lost to the sight of the horsemen among the short foaming waves of the torrent.  “The boy will be drowned,” one of the horsemen said, spurring his horse up the valley; but in another minute the lad was seen breasting the calmer water just above the ford.  “You cannot cross here, Captain Hume,” he said, as he approached the horsemen. “You must go nigh a mile up the river.”  “Why, who are you, lad?” the horseman asked, “and how do you know my name?”  “I'm the nephew of Nigel Graheme. Seeing how deep the floods were I came out to show you the way, for the best horse in the world could not swim the Nith here now.”  “But this is the ford,” Captain Hume said.  “Yes, this is the ford in dry weather. The bottom here is hard rock and easy to ride over when the river is but waist deep, but below and above this place it is covered with great boulders. The water is six feet deep here now, and the horses would be carried down among the rocks, and would never get across. A mile up the river is always deep, and though the current is strong there is nothing to prevent a bold horseman from swimming across.”  “I thank you heartily, young sir,” Captain Hume said. “I can see how broken is the surface of the water, and doubt not that it would have fared hard with us had we attempted to swim across here. In faith, Munro, we have had a narrow escape.”  “Ay, indeed,” the other agreed. “It would have been hard if you and I, after going through all the battlefields of the Low Countries, should have been drowned here together in a Scottish burn. Your young friend is a gallant lad and a good swimmer, for in truth it was no light task to swim that torrent with the water almost as cold as ice.”  “Now, sirs, will you please to ride on,” the boy said; “it is getting dark fast, and the sooner we are across the better.”  So saying he went off at a fast run, the horses trotting behind him. A mile above he reached the spot he had spoken of. The river was narrower here, and the stream was running with great rapidity, swirling and heaving as it went, but with a smooth even surface.  “Two hundred yards farther up,” the boy said, “is the beginning of the deep; if you take the water there you will get across so as to climb up by that sloping bank just opposite.”  He led the way to the spot he indicated, and then plunged into the stream, swimming quietly and steadily across, and allowing the stream to drift him down.  The horsemen followed his example. They had swum many a swollen river, and although their horses snorted and plunged at first, they soon quieted down and swam steadily over. They just struck the spot which the boy had indicated. He had already arrived there, and, without a word, trotted forward.  It was soon dark, and the horsemen were obliged to keep close to his heels to see his figure. It was as much as they could do to keep up with him, for the ground was rough and broken, sometimes swampy, sometimes strewn with boulders.  “It is well we have a guide,” Colonel Munro said to his companion; “for assuredly, even had we got safely across the stream, we should never have found our way across such a country as this. Scotland is a fine country, Hume, a grand country, and we are all proud of it, you know, but for campaigning, give me the plains of Germany; while, as for your weather here, it is only fit for a water rat.”  Hume laughed at this outburst.  “I sha'n't be sorry, Munro, for a change of dry clothes and a corner by a fire; but we must be nearly there now if I remember right. Graheme's hold is about three miles from the Nith.”  The boy presently gave a loud shout, and a minute later lights were seen ahead, and in two or three minutes the horsemen drew up at a door beside which two men were standing with torches; another strolled out as they stopped.  “Welcome, Hume! I am glad indeed to see you; and--ah! is it you, Munro? it is long indeed since we met.”  “That is it, Graheme; it is twelve years since we were students together at St. Andrews.”  “I did not think you would have come on such a night,” Graheme said.  “I doubt that we should have come tonight, or any other night, Nigel, if it had not been that that brave boy who calls you uncle swam across the Nith to show us the best way to cross. It was a gallant deed, and I consider we owe him our lives.”  “It would have gone hard with you, indeed, had you tried to swim the Nith at the ford; had I not made so sure you would not come I would have sent a man down there. I missed Malcolm after dinner, and wondered what had become of him. But come in and get your wet things off. It is a cold welcome keeping you here. My men will take your horses round to the stable and see that they are well rubbed down and warmly littered.”  In a quarter of an hour the party were assembled again in the sitting room. It was a bare room with heavily timbered ceiling and narrow windows high up from the ground; for the house was built for purposes of defence, like most Scottish residences in those days. The floor was thickly strewn with rushes. Arms and trophies of the chase hung on the walls, and a bright fire blazing on the hearth gave it a warm and cheerful aspect. As his guests entered the room Graheme presented them with a large silver cup of steaming liquor.  “Drain this,” he said, “to begin with. "]]]
