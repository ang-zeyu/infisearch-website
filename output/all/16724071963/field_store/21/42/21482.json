About this time three brethren who went with the Mormon Battallion, came back to Winter Quarters, having been sent on special business from Pueblo. Says Sister Prescendia, 'I never saw such a pitiful sight before as these poor, worn-out travelers presented. Their clothing hung in rags, their faces burned, and with sun and snow they were nearly blind. Their feet were wrapped in rawhide from the buffalo. I sat and heard them tell how fearfully they had suffered crossing the prairies in the dead of winter, and all this in defence of a Government that had driven us defenceless women and children into a strange wilderness. I could not refrain from weeping when I looked upon these my brethren and realized how they had suffered.'  \"Early in the spring a few pioneers left to search out a haven of refuge for the Saints. The sisters left almost alone, lived near to God. They used often to meet together and pray. The gifts of tongues, interpretation and prophecy were given them at this time for their consolation. In May, 1846, Sister Prescendia and her little son, Oliver, left Winter Quarters. She, like many others, had to drive team, yoke cattle, &c., though in delicate health. She arrived in Salt Lake Valley September 22nd, and moved into the old Fort. January 6th, 1848, Sister Prescendia had born to her a daughter. The baby was a great comfort to the lonely mother who had left her home and come thousands of miles away. No daughter was ever more fondly loved than this little one.  \"She was named Prescendia Celestia, and was rightly named Celestia, for she was more like a celestial being than a mortal one. President Young once asked her name; quick as thought, he said, _'Celestial Prescendia.'_ Coming here as the Saints did provided with only the barest necessities, there was much privation to contend against. The families of Brigham and Heber shared in these respects equally with the others. When Sister Prescendia's babe was quite small, she had to put up an umbrella over them in bed to protect them from the rain. Sister Prescendia was patient and thanked her Father in heaven that he had permitted her to gather to the Rocky Mountains, and also that she had been permitted to become a mother under the new and everlasting covenant of marriage.\" Nothing could be more affecting than her story of the loss of this lovely child. She dressed her for a visit, and gave her in charge of her brother, while she finished her preparations. He took her to the family of President Young, and as they were seated at table, each gave her a kiss, admiring her beauty, President Young last.  \"Returning to the mother, he sat her down a moment to cut a willow from the water's edge, and turning to her--she was gone. The sweet face, that going out smiled such a tender good-bye, was brought in cold in death. Vilate, the first wife of Heber, said, \"The flower of the flock is gone.\" Years have passed since then, but the beauty of that little face is undimmed in her mother's memory.\"  Sister Prescendia was for fifteen years secretary of the Sixteenth Ward Relief Society.  Sister Prescendia's labors have been in the House of the Lord, and annointing and administering to the sick. Hundreds have asked for her presence at their bedside--the name, Prescendia--has been almost like that sweet word, _mother_. I reflect upon the lonely, trial path that she has trod, the wounds her heart has borne; and listening to the tender pathos of her voice, the sublimity of her words; the nobility of her life commanding my love and reverence.  If I could choose the picture which should be historical, it should be as I have seen her; standing, her grand figure becomingly wrapped in a large, circular cloak, a handsome, large black bonnet shielding her venerable and beloved face from the falling flakes of snow. Looking upon her I thought her the very picture of a Puritan exile, a revolutionary ancestress, and a Latter-Day Saint veteran and pioneer. I shall always remember her thus, it is an ineffaceable picture in my memory.  Since writing the above, the following appears in the _Deseret News_ of September 11th:  \"MANIFESTATION OF RESPECT.  \"Yesterday being the anniversary of the birthday of Sister Prescendia L. Kimball, a party of ladies numbering about thirty, of her personal friends, mostly of very long standing, assembled at her residence. A lunch was partaken of about noon, and subsequently the gathering took the form of a meeting, at which all present expressed themselves appropriately to the occasion. The sisters also presented the venerable and respected lady, a handsome black satin cloak, trimmed with fur and lined with crimson plush, for winter wear. We are pleased to be able to state that Sister Kimball's health has considerably improved during the last few days.\"    PHOEBE W. CARTER WOODRUFF.  WIFE OF WILFORD WOODRUFF, PRESIDENT OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES, OF THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  \"I, Phoebe W. Carter, wife of Apostle Wilford Woodruff, was born in Scarboro, in the State of Maine, March 8th, 1807. My father was of English descent, coming to America at about the close of the seventeenth century. My mother, Sarah Fabyan, was also of England, and of the third generation from England. The name of Fabyan is ancient, and of a noble family. My father's family, also, much of the old Puritan stamp.  \"In the year 1834, I embraced the Gospel, as revealed through the Prophet Joseph Smith, and, about a year after, I left my parents and kindred, and journeyed to Kirtland, Ohio, a distance of one thousand miles, a lone maid, sustained only by my faith and trust in Israel's God. My friends marvelled at my course, as did I, but something within impelled me on. My mother's grief at my leaving home was almost more than I could bear; and had it not been for the spirit within I should have faltered at the last. My mother told me she would rather see me buried than going thus alone into the heartless world, and especially was she concerned about my leaving home to cast my lot among the Mormons. 'Phoebe,' she said, impressively, 'will you come back to me if you find Mormonism false?' I answered thrice, 'Yes, mother, I will.' These were my words well remembered to this day; she knew I would keep my promise. My answer relieved her trouble; but it cost us all much sorrow to part. When the time came for my departure I dared not trust myself to say farewell, so I wrote my good-bye to each, and leaving them on my table, ran down stairs and jumped into the carriage. Thus I left my beloved home of childhood to link my life with the Saints of God.'  \"When I arrived in Kirtland I became acquainted with the Prophet Joseph Smith, and received more evidence of his divine mission. There in Kirtland I formed the acquaintance of Elder Wilford Woodruff, to whom I was married in 1836. With him I went to the 'Islands of the Sea' and to England, on missions. Here I will bear my testimony to the power of God which I have often seen manifested among the Latter-Day Saints. The following is one notable instance:  \"When the Saints were settling Nauvoo, the unhealthy labor of breaking new land on the banks of the Mississippi for the founding of the city, invited pestilence. Nearly everyone was attacked with fever and ague. The Prophet had the sick borne into his house and dooryard until the place was like a hospital. At length even he succumbed to the deadly contagion and for several days was as helpless as the rest of our people, who were all nearly exhausted by their extermination from Missouri. But the spirit of the Lord came down upon Joseph, commanding him to arise and stay the pestilence. The Prophet arose from his bed and the power of God rested upon him. He commenced in his own house and dooryard, commanding the sick in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and be made whole; and they were healed according to his word. He then continued to travel from house to house, and from tent to tent, upon the bank of the river, healing the sick as he went, until he arrived at the upper stone house, where he crossed the river in a boat accompanied by several of the Quorum of the Twelve, whom he had bade to follow him, and landed in Montrose. He walked into the cabin of Brigham Young, who was lying sick, and commanded him in the name of Jesus Christ to arise and be made whole, and follow him, which he did. They came to our house next, and Joseph bade Mr. Woodruff, also, to follow, and then they went to the house of Brother Elijah Fordham, who was supposed by his family and friends to have been dying, for two weeks. The Prophet stepped to his bedside, took him by the hand, and commanded him in the name of Jesus Christ to arise from his bed and be made whole. His voice, Joseph Smith's, was as the voice of God. Brother Fordham instantly leaped from his bed, called for his clothing and dressed himself, and followed the Apostles into the street. They then went into the house of Joseph B. Nobles, who lay very sick, and he was healed in like manner. And when by the power of God granted unto him, Joseph had healed all the sick, he recrossed the river and returned to his own house. Thousands of witnesses bear testimony of the miracle. It was a day never to be forgotten. Hearing of the case of Brother Fordham, whom I with the rest had believed to be dying, I thought I would go and see with my own eyes. I found him very happy, sitting in his chair. He told me he had been out to work in his garden. This was only a few hours after the miracle. From that day I never doubted that this was the work of God.  \"It will be expected that I should say something on polygamy. I have this to say. When the principle of plural marriage was first taught, I thought it was the most wicked thing I ever heard of; consequently I opposed it to the best of my ability, until I became sick and wretched. As soon, however, as I became convinced that it originated as a revelation from God through Joseph, knowing him to be a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50958"],["title","Representative Women of Deseret: A Book of Biographical Sketches (#8)"],["body","het, I wrestled with my Heavenly Father in fervent prayer, to be guided aright at that all-important moment of my life. The answer came. Peace was given to my mind. I knew it was the will of God; and from that time to the present I have sought to faithfully honor the patriarchal law.  \"Of Joseph, my testimony is that he was one of the greatest prophets the Lord ever called, that he lived for the redemption of mankind and died a martyr for the truth. The love of the Saints for him will never die.  \"It was after the martyrdom of Joseph that I accompanied my husband to England in 1845. On our return the advance companies of the Saints had left Nauvoo under President Young and others of the Twelve. We followed immediately and journeyed to Winter Quarters. The next year my husband went with the pioneers to the mountains while the care of the family rested on me. After his return and the re-organization of the First Presidency, I accompanied my husband on his mission to the Eastern States. In 1850 we arrived in the Valley and since that time Salt Lake City has been my home.  \"Of my husband, I can truly say I have found him a worthy man with scarcely his superior on earth. He has built up a branch of the Church wherever he has labored. He has been faithful to God and his family, every day of his life. My respect for him has increased with our years, and my desire for an eternal union with him will be the last wish of my mortal life.\"  At the first organization of the Relief Society in the Fourteenth Ward, in the spring of 1857, Mrs. Woodruff was chosen by Bishop A. Hoagland as President, which position she held until by the \"move\" south, the society was discontinued. After their return she was invited to resume her position, but so much of the family care and management of business devolved upon her as her husband's faithful partner, that she felt she could not do justice to that object, and Bishop Hoagland asked her to nominate her successor. She chose her first counselor, Mary Isabella Horne. Mrs. Woodruff is also one of the presiding board of six, over the General Retrenchment Meetings, held semi-monthly in the Fourteenth Ward. In May, 1882, Mrs. Woodruff was elected one of the Executive Board of the Deseret Hospital. She often accompanies Apostle Wilford Woodruff on his visits among the settlements, holding meetings with the sisters, who look upon her as one of the wisest women in the knowledge of the Scriptures and in her counsels among her sisters in the _Church_. The record of her life and labors would make a deeply interesting volume which could not fail to inspire the youth of Zion with a desire to emulate her worthy example, and the hearts of older ones with admiration and reverence. The eighteen years of our acquaintance have served to strengthen and beautify my friendship for Phoebe W. Woodruff, as wife, mother and Saint. It seems but fitting, to record here that the mother and father of Sister Woodruff were baptized by Apostle Wilford Woodruff. Thus ended all the fears of the Puritan mother.  Quoting an historian of note (himself an occupant of part of the Woodruff residence for a long period): \"Sister Phoebe W. Woodruff is one of the noblest examples of her sex,--truly a mother in Israel; and in her strength of character, consistency and devotion, she has but few peers in the Church.\"    BATHSHEBA W. SMITH.  WIFE OF APOSTLE GEORGE A. SMITH, OF REVERED MEMORY, WHO WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PRESIDENCY OF THE CHURCH OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS.  Bathsheba W. Smith is the daughter of Mark and Susannah Bigler, and was born at Shirnsten, Harrison Co., West Virginia, on May 3rd, 1822. Her father was from Pennsylvania, her mother from Maryland. The school facilities in her vicinity were limited. The county of Harrison was hilly, and the roads of primitive character; the mode of travel was chiefly on horseback riding, in which few could excel her.  In her girlhood she was religiously inclined, loved virtue, honesty, truthfulness and integrity; attended secret prayers, studied to be cheerful, industrious and happy, and was always opposed to rudeness.  During her fifteenth year some Latter-Day Saints visited the neighborhood, she heard them preach and believed what they taught. She knew by the spirit of the Lord, in answer to her prayer, that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the Lord, and that the Book of Mormon was a divine record. On the 21st of August, 1837, Bathsheba W. Bigler was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ, and the most of her father's family also, about the same time. They soon felt a desire to gather with the rest of the Saints in Missouri, her sister, Nancy, and family sold their property, intending to go in the fall, and Bathsheba was very anxious to go with them. Her father having not yet sold out his property, she was told she could not go. This caused her to retire very early, feeling very sorrowful. While weeping, a voice said to her, \"Weep not, you will go this fall.\" She was comforted and perfectly satisfied, and the next morning testified to what the voice had said to her.  Soon after, her father sold his home and they all went to Missouri, to her great joy, but on their arrival there found the State preparing to war against the Saints. A few nights before they reached Far West, they camped with a company of eastern Saints, but separated on account of each company choosing different ferries. The company Sister Bathsheba and her family were in, arrived safely at their destination, but the others were overtaken by an armed mob; seventeen were killed, others were wounded, and some maimed for life. In a few days after their arrival there was a battle between the Saints and the mob, in which David W. Patten (one of the first Twelve Apostles,) was wounded, and he was brought to the house where they were stopping. Sister Bathsheba witnessed his death a few days after, and saw thousands of mobbers arrayed against the Saints, and heard their dreadful threats and savage yells, when our Prophet Joseph and his brethren were taken into their camp. The Prophet, Patriarch and many others were taken to prison; and the Saints had to leave the State. In the spring they had the joy of having the prophet and his brethren restored to them at Quincy, Illinois.  In the spring of 1840, the family of Sister Bathsheba moved to Nauvoo, where she had many opportunities of hearing the Prophet Joseph preach, and tried to profit by his instructions, and also received many testimonies of the truths which he taught.  On the 25th of July, 1841, Bathsheba W. Bigler was married to George A. Smith, the then youngest member of the Twelve Apostles, Elder Don Carlos Smith (brother of the prophet) officiating. George A. Smith was own cousin to the Prophet Joseph. When Sister Bathsheba first became acquainted with George A. Smith he was the junior member of the First Quorum of Seventies. On the 26th of June, 1838, he was ordained a member of the High Council of Adam Ondi Ahman, in Davis County, Missouri. Just about the break of day on the 26th of April, 1834, while kneeling on the corner stone of the foundation of the Lord's House at Far West, Caldwell County, Missouri, he was ordained one of the Twelve Apostles, and from thence started on a mission to Europe, from which he returned ten days previous to their marriage.  As the 4th of July, 1842, came on the Sabbath day, they celebrated the anniversary on Monday the 5th. There was a military display of the Nauvoo Legion, and a sham battle fought. George A. Smith was in the general's staff in the uniform of a chaplain. Sister Bathsheba watched the proceedings with great interest. On the 7th of July a son was born to them; they named him George Albert. Two months after, George A., as the Saints loved to call him, went on a mission to the Eastern States. On his previous mission (to England,) he injured his left lung, causing hemorrhage. In the fall of 1843, George A. and Bathsheba received their endowments and were united under the holy order of celestial marriage. Sister Bathsheba heard the Prophet Joseph charge the Twelve with the duty and responsibility of the ordinances of endowments and sealing, for the living and the dead. Sister Bathsheba met many times with her husband, Joseph and others who had received their endowments, in an upper room dedicated for the purpose, and prayed with them repeatedly in those meetings. In the spring of 1844, Mr. Smith went on another mission, and soon after he left persecution began in the city of Nauvoo which ended in the martyrdom of our beloved prophet and patriarch. Mr. Smith returned about the 1st of August, and on the 14th a daughter was born, and they named her Bathsheba.  Having become thoroughly convinced that the doctrine of plurality of wives was from God, and firmly believing that she should participate with him in all his blessings, glory and honor, Sister Bathsheba gave to her husband different wives during the year of his return home. She says of this; \"Being proud of my husband and loving him very much, knowing him to be a man of God, and having a testimony that what I had done was acceptable to my Father in heaven, I was as happy as I knew how to be.\"  It would be in vain to describe how they traveled through snow, wind and rain, how roads had to be made, bridges built and rafts constructed, how our poor animals had to drag on day after day with scanty food; nor how we suffered from poverty, sickness and deaths, but the Lord was with us, His power was made manifest daily. Quoting from her, \"My dear mother died on the 11th of March, 1844, and on the 4th of April I had a son born who lived but four hours.\" They arrived in Salt Lake Valley (now city) in October, 1849, after traveling over sterile deserts and plains, over high mountains and through deep canyons, ferrying some streams and fording others, but all was joy now. Sister Bathsheba went to her sister's house, and O, how delightful it did seem to be once more in a comfortable room"]]]
