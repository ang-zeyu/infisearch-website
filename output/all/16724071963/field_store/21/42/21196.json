The day after the probe's ineffectual departure, Burke got back to his plant. He brought Holmes with him. Together, they looked over the accumulated material for Burke's enterprise and began to sort out the truckloads of plaster of Paris, masses of punched-sheet aluminum, girders, rods, beams of shining metal, cased dynamos, crated pumps, tanks, and elaborately padded objects whose purpose was not immediately clear. Sandy was overwhelmed by the job of inventorying, indexing, and otherwise making the material available for use as desired. There were bales of fluffy white cloth and drums and drums of liquids which insisted on leaking, and smelled very badly when they did. But Burke found some items not yet on hand, and fretted, so Sandy brought her sister Pam into the office to add to the office force.  Sandy and Pam worked quite as hard in the office as Burke and Holmes in the construction shed. They telephoned protests at delays, verified shipments, scolded shipping-clerks, argued with transportation-system expediters, wrote letters, answered letters, compared invoices with orders, sternly battled with negligence and delays of all kinds, and in between kept the books of Burke Development, Inc., up to date so that at any instant Burke could find out how much money he'd spent and how little remained. The two girls in the office were necessary to the operations which at first centered in the construction shed, but shortly began to show up outside.  Four workmen arrived from the Holmes' Yacht shipyard. They looked at blueprints and drawings made by Holmes and Burke together, regarded with pained expressions the material they were to use, and set to work. This was on the day the second Russian space-probe lifted from somewhere in the Caucasus Mountains at 1:10 A.M., local time.  The second probe did not veer off its proper line. Its four boosters fired at appropriate intervals and it went streaking off toward emptiness almost straight away from the sun. It left behind it a thin whining transmission which was not at all like the beepings of the asteroid transmitter.  In two days a framework of struts and laths took form outside the construction shed. It looked more like a mock-up of a radio telescope than anything else, but it was smaller and had a different shape. It was an improbable-looking bowl. Under Holmes' supervision, dozens of sacks of plaster of Paris found their way into it, coating it roughly on the outside and very smoothly within. It was then lined tenderly with carefully cut sections of fluffy cloth, with bars and beams and girders placed between the layers. Then reeking drums of liquid were moved to the working-site and their contents saturated the glass-wool.  The smell was awful, so the workmen knocked off for a day until it diminished. But Sandy and Pam continued to expostulate with shippers by long-distance, type letters threatening lawsuits if orders were not filled immediately, and once found that items Burke indignantly demanded had come in and Holmes had carted them off and used them without notifying anybody. That was the day Pam threatened to resign.  \"It looks like a pudding,\" grumbled Pam, after Sandy had mollified her and Burke had apologized for having made her fight needlessly with two transport-lines, a shipping department, and a vice-president in charge of sales. \"And they act like it was a baby!\"  \"It'll be a ship,\" said Sandy. \"You know what kind.\"  \"I'll believe it when I see it,\" said Pam. Then she demanded indignantly, \"Has Joe looked at you twice since this nonsense started?\"  \"No,\" admitted Sandy. \"He works all the time. At night he has a receiver tuned to the beepings to make sure he knows if the broadcast changes again. The Russians are still trying to make a two-way contact. But the broadcast just keeps on, ignoring everybody.\" Then she said, \"Anyhow, Joe's going to feel awful if it doesn't work. I've got to be around to pick up the pieces of his vanity and put them together again.\"  \"Huh!\" said Pam. \"Catch me doing that!\"  At just that moment Holmes came into the office with a finger dripping blood. He had been supervising and, at the same time, assisting in the building of an additional section of laths and struts and he was annoyed with himself for the small injury which interfered with his work.  Pam did the bandaging. She cooed over him distressedly, and had him grinning before the dressing was finished. He went back to work very much pleased with himself.  \"I,\" said Sandy, \"wouldn't act like you just did!\"  \"Sister, darling,\" said Pam, \"I won't cramp your act. Don't you criticize mine! That large wounded character is as attractive as anything I've seen in months.\"  \"But I feel,\" said Sandy, \"as if I hadn't seen Joe in years!\"  Their viewpoint was strictly feminine and geared to female ideas and aspirations. But, in fact, they were probably as satisfied as two girls could be. They were on the side lines of interesting happenings which were being prepared by interesting men. They were useful enough to the enterprise to belong to it without doing anything outstanding enough to amount to rivalry with the men. From a girl's standpoint, it wasn't at all bad.  But neither Burke nor Holmes even faintly guessed at the appraisal of their work by Sandy and Pam. To Holmes, the task was fascinating because it was a ship he was building. It was not a beautiful object, to be sure. If the lath-and-plaster mould were removed, the thing inside it would look rather like an obese small whale. There were recesses in its rotund sides in which distinctly eccentric apparatus appeared. Its interior was even more curious. And still it was a ship. Holmes found deep satisfaction in fitting its interior parts into place. It was like, but not the same as, equipping a small vessel with fathometers, radars, direction-finders, air-conditioners, stoves, galleys, heads and refrigerators without getting it crowded.  To be sure, no seagoing ship would have sections of hydroponic wall-garden installed, nor would an auxiliary schooner normally have six pairs of closed-circuit television cameras placed outside for a view in each and every direction. This ship had such apparatus. But to Holmes the building of what Burke had designed was an extremely attractive task.  Burke had less fun. He'd set up a huge metal lathe in the construction shed, and he labored at carving out of a specially built-up Swedish-iron shaft a series of twenty-odd magnet-cores like the triple unit he considered successful. Each of the peculiar shapes had to be carved out of the shaft, and all had to remain part of the shaft when completed. Then each had to be wound with magnet-wire, coated with plastic as it was wound. Then a bronze tube had to be formed over all, with no play of any sort anywhere. The task required the workmanship of a jeweller and the patience of Job. And Burke had had enough experience with new constructions to be acutely doubtful that this would be right when it was done.  The Russians sent up a third space-probe, aimed at Asteroid M-387. It functioned perfectly. Three days later, a fourth. Three days later still, a fifth. Their aim with the fifth was not too good.  The beeping sounds continued to come in from space. The second message remained the same but the crackling sounds changed. There was a systematic and consistent variation in what they apparently had to say. M.I.T. discovered the modification. When its report reached the newspapers, Sandy invaded the construction shed to show Burke the news account. Oil-smeared and harassed, he stopped work to read it.  \"Hell!\" he said querulously. \"I should've had somebody watching for this! I figured the second broadcast was telling us something that would change as time went on. They're telemetering something to us. I'd guess there's an emergency or an ultimatum in the works, and this is telling how fast it's coming to a crisis. But I'm already working as fast as I can!\"  \"Some cases marked 'Instruments' came this morning,\" Sandy told him. \"They're the solidest shipping cases I ever saw. And the bills for them!\"  \"Wire Keller,\" said Burke. \"Tell him they're here and to come along.\"  \"Who's Keller?\" asked Sandy. \"And what's his address?\"  Burke blew up unreasonably, and Sandy said \"I quit!\" In seconds, he had apologized and assured Sandy that she was quite right and that he was an idiot. Of course she couldn't know who Keller was. Keller was the man who would install the instruments in the ship outside. Burke gave her his address. Sandy was not appeased.  Burke ran a grimy hand despairingly through his hair.  \"Sandy,\" he protested, \"bear with me just a little while! In just a few more days this thing will be finished, and I'll know whether I'm the prize imbecile of history or whether I've actually managed to do something worth while! Bear with me like you would with a half-wit or a delinquent child or something. Please, Sandy--\"  She turned her back on him and walked out of the shed. But she didn't quit. Burke turned back to his work.  The Russians sent up another probe. It went off course. There were now six unmanned Russian probes in emptiness, of which four were lined up reasonably well along the route which a manned probe, if one were sent up, should ultimately travel. The advance probes formed an ingenious approach to the problem of getting a man farther out in space than any man had been before, but it was horribly risky. But apparently the Russians could afford to take such risks. The Americans couldn't. They had a settled policy of spending a dollar instead of a man. It was humanitarian, but it had one drawback. There was a tendency to keep on spending dollars and not ever let a man take a chance.  The Russians had four fuel-carrying drones in line out in space. If a ship could grapple them in turn and refuel, it might make the journey to M-387 in eight or ten weeks instead of as many months.

Winfield     INTRODUCTION  My Dear Boys: This volume is a complete story in itself, but forms the seventeenth in a line issued under the general title of \"The Rover Boys Series for Young Americans.\"  As I have mentioned several times, in other volumes, this line was started with the publication of \"The Rover Boys at School,\" \"On the Ocean\" and \"In the Jungle.\" The cordial reception afforded the stories called for the publication of the next volume, \"The Rover Boys Out West,\" and then, year after year, by the issuing of \"On the Great Lakes,\" \"In Camp,\" \"On Land and Sea,\" \"On the River,\" \"On the Plains,\" \"In Southern Waters,\" \"On the Farm,\" \"On Treasure Isle,\" \"At College,\" \"Down East,\" and then by \"In the Air,\" where we last met them.  The boys are not as young as they once were--indeed, in this book, Dick, the oldest, gets married and settles down to business. But all are as bright and lively as ever, and Tom is just as full of fun. When they go to New York City they have some strenuous times, and all prove their worth in more ways than one. Their father is in deep trouble and they aid him, and clear up quite a mystery.  Up to this writing, the sale on this line of books is but a trifle short of one million and a quarter copies! This is to me, of course, tremendously gratifying. Again, as in the past, I thank my many readers for their interest in what I have written for them; and I trust the perusal of my works will do them good.  Affectionately and sincerely yours,                                                     Arthur M. Winfield.     CHAPTER I  THE BOYS AT BRILL   \"Boys, what do you say to a trip in the Dartaway this afternoon?\"  \"Suits me, Sam,\" replied Tom Rover.  \"Providing the breeze doesn't get too strong,\" returned Dick Rover, as he put up his hand to feel the air.  \"Oh, I don't think it will blow too much,\" went on Sam Rover. \"I don't mind some air.\"  \"But no more storms for me!\" cried his brother Tom, with a shake of his head. \"That last old corker was enough for me.\"  \"Where shall we go?\" questioned Dick, with a queer little smile creeping around the corners of his mouth.  \"Oh, my, just to hear Dick!\" cried Tom, with a grin. \"As if he would go anywhere but to Hope Seminary, to call on Dora!\"  \"And as if you would go anywhere but to call on Nellie, at the same place!\" retorted the oldest Rover boy.  \"Now, children, children'\" came sweetly from Sam. \"You mustn't quarrel about the dear girls. I know both of you are as much gone as can be. But----\"  \"And how about Grace, Sam?\" said Tom. \"Didn't I hear you making up some poetry about her yesterday, 'Those limpid eyes and pearly ears, and'----\"  \"Rats, Tom! I don't make up poetry--I leave that to Songbird,\" interrupted the youngest Rover boy. \"Just the same, it will be nice to call on the girls. They'll be looking for us some day this week.\"  \"That's right--and maybe we can give them a little ride,\" put in Dick Rover.  \"Do you remember the ride we gave Dora and Nellie, when we rescued them from Sobber, Crabtree, and the others?\" asked Tom.  \"Not likely to forget that in a hurry,\" answered his big brother. \"By the way, I wonder when the authorities will try those rascals?\"  \"Not right away, I'm thinking, Dick,\" answered Tom. \"The law is rather slow up here in these back counties.\"  \"Never mind--they will get what is coming to them sooner or later,\" was Sam's comment.  \"Abduction is rather a serious offense.\"  \"Right you are,\" answered Dick. \"And I'll be glad to see Crabtree, Sobber, and our other enemies behind the bars. Then they won't be able to bother us any more.\"  \"That will be the end of Sobber's efforts to annex the Stanhope fortune,\" mused Sam. \"How hard he did try to get it away from Mrs. Stanhope and the girls!\"  \"I shouldn't have minded that had he used fair methods, Sam,\" returned the big brother. \"But when it came to stealing and abducting----\"  \"Hello, you fellows!\" shouted a voice from behind the Rover boys. \"Plotting mischief?\"  \"Not just now, Stanley,\" answered Dick, as his college chum caught him by the shoulder and swung him around playfully.  \"Want to go for a row on the river?\" asked Stanley Browne.  \"Not just now, Stanley. I've got a lecture to attend, and this afternoon we are going over to Hope in the biplane.\"  \"Wish I had a flying machine,\" said the student, wistfully.  \"Better swap the boat for one,\" suggested Sam.  \"No, I think rowing is safer. Some day, if you are not careful, you'll get an awful tumble from that machine.\"  \"We try to be as careful as possible,\" answered Dick. \"Seriously, though, Stanley, I don't care for flying as much as I thought I would.\"  \"Is that so? Now, I thought you were planning a honeymoon trip by aeroplane. Think of the novelty of it!\"  \"No, a steamboat or a parlor car will be good enough for me, when I go on a honeymoon trip,\" answered Dick, and for a very good reason he blushed deeply.  \"Hello, William Philander Tubbs!\" cried Tom, as a tall, dudish-looking student crossed the college campus. \"What's the price of eggs this morning?\"  \"What is that, Tom?\" questioned the stylishly-dressed youth, as he turned in the direction of the others.  \"I asked what was the price of eggs?\" said Tom, innocently.  \"The--er--the price of eggs? How should I know?\" stammered William Philander Tubbs in astonishment.  \"Weren't you in the chicken business once?\"  \"Gracious me! No, Tom, no!\"  \"Funny I made the mistake--and I want to know the price of eggs the worst way,\" went on the fun-loving Rover, innocently.  \"What do you want to know the price of eggs for?\" questioned William Philander, curiously.  \"Why, you see, we've got a new problem in geometry to solve, and the price of eggs will help out,\" continued Tom, looking very serious.  \"What is it, Tom?\"  \"It's this, Tubby, my boy. If the diameter of an egg ten degrees west of its North Pole is two and eleven-tenths inches, what is the value of the shell unfilled? I thought you might help me out on that.\"  \"Tom, you are poking fun at me!\" cried the dudish student, as a snicker went up from the other youths. \"And please don't call me Tubby, I beg of you,\" pleaded William Philander.  \"All right, Billy Gander,\" murmured Tom. \"It shan't occur again.\"  \"Billy Gander! That is worse than Tubby!\" groaned the dudish youth. \"Oh, you are awful!\" he added, and strode off, trying to look very indignant.  \"Poor Tubbs, I wonder if he will ever be sensible and get over his dudish ways,\" was Dick's comment.  \"I doubt it--for it seems to be born in him,\" returned Sam.  \"But he's a good sort with it all,\" ventured Stanley Browne.  \"First-rate,\" agreed Tom. \"But I--well, I simply can't help poking fun at him when he's around, he's such a dandy, and so lordly in his manner.\"  \"Here comes Songbird!\" interrupted Sam. \"And, see, he is writing verses, as usual. I wonder----\"  \"Look!\" exclaimed Dick. \"Oh! There's a collision for you!\"  William Philander Tubbs had started across the campus with his head high in the air. He was looking to one side and did not notice the approach of another student, who was coming forward thoughtfully, carrying a pad in one hand and writing as he walked. There was a sudden meeting of the pair, and the pad fell to the ground and with it the fancy headgear the dudish student was wearing.  \"Oh, I--er--I beg your pardon, really I do, don't you know!\" stammered William Philander.  \"Great Hannibal's tombstone!\" spluttered the other student. \"What are you trying to do, Tubbs, knock me down?\"  \"I beg your pardon, Powell, I didn't see you coming,\" answered the other, as he picked up his hat and commenced to brush it off with care.  \"You must be getting blind,\" growled John Powell, otherwise known as Songbird. \"Confound the luck--you spoilt one of my best rhymes,\" he added, as he stooped to pick up his writing pad.  \"Sorry, upon my honor I am,\" returned William Philander. \"Can I help you out on it?\"  \"I don't think you can. Did you ever try to write poetry--real poetry, I mean?\"  \"No, my dear boy, no. I'm afraid I would not be equal to it.\"  \"Then I don't see how you are going to help me,\" murmured Songbird, and he passed on a few steps, coming to a halt presently to jot down some words on his pad.  \"Hello, Songbird!\" called out Tom. \"How is the Muse to-day, red-hot?\"  For a moment John Powell did not answer, but kept on writing. Then his face broke out into a sudden smile.  \"There, that's it!\" he cried. \"I've got it at last! I knew I'd get it if I kept at it long enough.\"  \"Knew you'd get what, the measles?\" asked the fun-loving Tom.  \"'Measles' nothing!\" snorted the would-be poet. \"I have been writing a poem on 'The Springtime of Love,' and I wished to show how----\"  \"'The Springtime of Love!'\" interrupted Tom. \"That must be a second cousin to the ditty entitled ''Tis Well to Meet Her at the Well.'\"  \"I never heard of such a poem,\" answered Songbird, with a serious air. \"How does it go?\"  \"It doesn't go, Songbird; it stands still. But what have you got on the pad?\"  \"Yes, let us hear the latest effusion,\" put in Sam.  \"But not if it takes too long,\" was Dick's comment. \"I've only got about ten minutes before that lecture on 'The Cave Dwellers.'\"  \"I can give Songbird six minutes,\" said Stanley, as he consulted his watch.  \"This is--er--something of a private poem,\" stammered Songbird. \"I wrote it for a--er--for a personal friend of mine.\"  \"Minnie Sanderson!\" cried Sam, mentioning the name of a farmer's daughter with whom all were well acquainted, and a young lady Songbird called on occasionally.  \"Read it, anyway, Songbird,\" said Dick.  \"Well, if you care to hear it,\" responded the would-be poet, and he began to read from the pad:    \"In early Spring, when flowers bloom    In garden and on fields afar,    My thoughts go out to thee, sweet love,    And then I wonder where you are!    When pansies show their varied hues    And birds are singing as they soar,    I listen and I look, and dream   "]]]
