A chap could fly every day, then, regardless of rank. That is, up until the last nine months or so. Then C.O.s were grounded, as being too valuable to lose. But still there was no paper work. Not a bit of it.\"  \"True, it is a bit of a task and a bore,\" Adjutant Phipps agreed from his desk in the corner. \"Seems Adastral House must know everything from what the lads have for breakfast to whether or not they wear their socks on the wrong feet. All for a good reason, I suppose. But it does give a chap the writer's cramp. What do you make of this latest memo that came through, sir? Number Six-Four-Two-Nine.\"  The Squadron Leader pulled his hands down from his face and blinked.  \"Eh?\" he grunted. \"Don't believe I saw that one. Must have passed it over. What's it about, Phipps? Does it make sense or is it like the usual stuff that comes through?\"  The Adjutant fished an official looking sheet of yellow paper from a pile on his desk, got up from his chair and crossed the office.  \"There it is,\" he said placing it in front of the Officer Commanding. \"Frankly, I haven't the faintest idea, sir. Looks to me like some bloke at Air Ministry wasn't quite recovered from a terrific binge, or something. All a lot of Greek, as they say.\"  Markham blinked his eyes a couple of more times, leaned forward a bit and squinted at the yellow sheet of paper. The top half was filled with all the routine junk ... code letters, numbers, and file reference marks ... that always accompany official communications. So he gave that part just a sweeping glance. It was the communication itself that attracted and held his attention.  It read:       Reconnaissance pictures considered obsolete as of Twenty-Fifth.      Zone K-24 believed to be evacuated. It is essential that      confirmation of this be obtained at the earliest possible moment,      regardless of cost. Plan X-4-B depends upon complete knowledge of      the situation. You are advised to communicate at once with      Squadrons assigned to this task, and to make your arrangements as      speedily as possible. You are also advised to carry out the      assignment on a voluntary basis. Please acknowledge this.       Group Captain Ball       Air Ministry  Squadron Leader Markham read the thing through three times, then pushed back from his desk and cocked a stern eye at Phipps.  \"I'm surprised, Phipps!\" he said.  The Adjutant gulped a little and blinked.  \"I beg your pardon, sir?\" he said.  Markham tapped the paper with his finger.  \"About this,\" he said. \"Do you mean to tell me that you don't understand? You don't comprehend?\"  Phipps licked his lips, fumbled with a loose button on his tunic, and wondered if he should have enlisted in the artillery instead of the R.A.F. So many blasted mysteries in the Air Force.  \"Well, sir,\" he began. \"That is ... I mean.... Well, frankly, sir, I don't think I do understand.\"  \"Don't _think_?\" Markham barked at him. \"Well, that's the difference between us!\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the Adjutant said weakly.  \"Exactly the difference!\" the Officer Commanding said with a curt nod of his head. Then grinning broadly, \"You don't _think_ you know, Phipps, but I blessed well _know_ I don't know. It's the craziest memo I've ever received. I'd almost say that Group Captain Ball was stone spiffed, but I know him personally, and he never touches a drop. Get him on the wire for me, will you, Phipps? I believe I have half an idea as to what's up.\"  \"You have, sir?\" the Adjutant echoed with interest.  \"I read lots of detective books,\" the Officer Commanding said with a wave of his hand. \"Fine for taking a chap's mind off this blasted war. Yes, I fancy the postman stopped at the wrong house this morning.\"  \"Eh, sir?\" Phipps mumbled with a frown.  \"Obvious, I think, Phipps,\" Markham said and tapped the paper again. \"This was supposed to be delivered to some other bloke, not to me. Now, get Ball on the wire like a good chap, eh?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" Phipps said and spun back to his own desk. \"Oh, quite, sir.\"  As the Adjutant reached his desk he stopped short and turned toward the window. So did Squadron Leader Markham for that matter. Outside the air had suddenly become filled with the roar of powerful aircraft engines. Markham leaped over to the window and looked out and up at the five plane formation playing tag at some three or four thousand feet over the field. They were Supermarine Spitfires, the new Mark 5 type; the latest and fastest fighter plane off the British aircraft factory assembly lines.  They looked exactly like the old Spitfires, and in many ways they were just the same. But there were also many changes, and improvements. There was more horsepower in the Rolls-Royce engine in the nose. There was more fire power due to the addition of four 20-mm. aircraft cannon to the already standard equipment of eight death chopping machine guns that could blast out bullets at the rate of nine thousand odd per minute. And there were a few very hush-hush gadgets on the new Mark 5 that the Nazi Luftwaffe would sell its soul to have on their planes. But that is the difference between the Royal Air Force and Hitler's Luftwaffe. The Royal Air Force will always be better tomorrow than it is today, but the Luftwaffe gets just so good, and there it stops. There just isn't that something in the Nazi aeronautical make-up that drives a man on to improve upon his best efforts!  \"Those Mark Fives!\" Markham breathed as his face lighted up with honest pride. \"What a plane! And, do I wish I was just a Pilot Officer again, instead of a Squadron Leader. See those two flying Number Two and Three on the right, Phipps?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" the Adjutant nodded with a smile. \"Flying Officers Dawson and Farmer, aren't they, sir?\"  \"That's right,\" the O.C. replied. \"And it was a lucky day for Eighty-Four when those two were assigned to us. Just kids, both of them, but worth their weight in gold. They're going far, I fancy. Fact is, if this blasted war lasts long enough, I'll probably one day be giving them the salute, and calling them, sir! Just look at that!\"  Phipps was already looking at the five plane formation wheeling around into the wind to come in to land. Number Two and Three planes on the right slid down through the air as though they were wired together. There wasn't an inch change of air space between the two planes as they wheeled around and down. It was precision flying, plus! And Squadron Leader Markham was breathing hard when he finally turned away from the window.  \"Born in an airplane, those two!\" he grunted. \"I swear they must have been. I ... I say there, Phipps, old thing! Did you get Ball on the wire? After all, this crazy paper may be very important, and all that sort of thing. Hop to it, my lad!\"  Adjutant Phipps hopped to it, and in less than a minute he had the Air Ministry official on the wire. Markham took the call, and talked with his superior for some ten minutes. Phipps listened to the snatches of conversation he could hear, but it all made very little sense to him.  Eventually the Squadron Leader hung up. That is to say, he banged the receiver back in its cradle, and sat glaring at the instrument as though he would like to hurl it against the wall. Phipps waited a minute or so, and then couldn't stand the suspense any longer.  \"Bad news, sir?\" he ventured.  Markham snorted and reached for a cigarette.  \"You've been in Service long enough to know that every time you talk with Adastral House it means bad news!\" he growled. \"Blast it! Why did you show me that confounded thing in the first place, anyway? Why didn't you tear it up and throw it away, and say nothing?\"  \"But, sir!\" Phipps protested. \"That wouldn't be quite right, you know, sir!\"  \"There are times when a wrong is perfectly right!\" Squadron Leader Markham grunted between puffs on his cigarette. Then with a faint gesture of his hand, \"But don't go and shoot your brains out, old thing. Not your fault, of course. Some nit-wit, balmy bloke at Air Ministry who put it in the wrong dispatch pouch. Fact is, I was wrong to have called Ball. Now we're in for it, I fancy.\"  \"A special assignment, sir?\" Phipps asked.  \"Something like that,\" the Squadron Leader nodded. \"Don't know the details, but I'm quite sure that it'll turn out something very messy. That blasted paper should have gone to Hundred and Seven Squadron, not us. When I told Ball we had received it he was over-joyed, blast his hide. Said he realized that we should have been selected in the first place. And having received the thing by mistake, he is going to assign us to it, anyway.\"  \"To what, sir?\" Adjutant Phipps persisted.  Markham sighed and shook his head.  \"I don't know,\" he said. \"Ball wouldn't give details over the phone, of course. Said he was flying down here, himself. Be here sometime this afternoon. But you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50400"],["title","Dave Dawson, Flight Lieutenant (#1)"],["body"," be sure that it'll be something like capturing two whole Nazi Staffels complete with equipment, or kidnapping Hitler, Goering, and Himmler, and bringing them back here to England to keep Rudolph Hess company. And chances are, it'll be something even more difficult. You know, Group Captain Ball has been given a standing order at Air Ministry.\"  \"A standing order, sir?\" Phipps echoed with a blank look.  Squadron Leader Markham crushed out his cigarette and stood up.  \"I suspect it, anyway!\" he mumbled and stared fixedly at the huge pin-pointed map of Europe on the opposite wall. \"I believe he has orders to think up the strangest, the riskiest, and the craziest patrol assignments. And then pass them out to poor blasted beggars like us. Well, I suppose a lot of chaps have got to take-off and get themselves killed before this confounded war is won. But it's a rum business, Phipps. Always bear that in mind.\"  \"Yes sir, I will,\" the Adjutant said and shook his head sadly from side to side as Markham walked out of the office.  When the door slammed shut Adjutant Phipps sighed heavily, leaned back in his chair and stroked his greying hair.  \"Yes, I should have joined the artillery,\" he murmured. \"I'm too old to understand these brave young lads who wear wings. They're chaps from another world, I fancy.\"     CHAPTER TWO  _A Present from Satan_   Out on the tarmac of Eighty-Four Dave Dawson and Freddy Farmer stood peeling off their flying gear and feasting their eyes on the new Mark 5 Spitfires. Lights of joy danced in their eyes, and their faces were flushed with excitement and eagerness for the future to become the present in a hurry.  \"That _is_ an airplane!\" Dave cried and slung his parachute pack up into the pit. \"That's a dream. The sugar in my coffee. The moonlight on a summer night. The smell of a lovely rose. The goal from the field in the last ten seconds of play. The whozit of the whatzit. And how!\"  Freddy looked at him and sighed unhappily.  \"And he was such a bright chap before he took that Mark Five up for a test hop!\" he murmured. \"He could count all the way up to ten. He could write his own name. And he even knew what day of the month it was. But, now.... O well! They say his kind last just so long. And, of course, he's a blinking Yank at heart. So.... Hey! Ouch!\"  The swinging Mae West life preserver jacket caught Freddy on the ear, and almost toppled him off his feet. He caught himself in time, ducked as the Mae West came sailing around again, and charged at his best pal. Dave backed up and stepped quickly to the side.  \"You had that coming to you, my little man,\" he said sternly. \"You should learn to understand expressions of beauty.\"  \"Sugar in his coffee!\" the English youth snorted. \"Moonlight on a summer night! Good grief! Whoever heard of such things?\"  \"Oh, I've got lots more of them,\" Dave chuckled. \"Better ones, too. Listen.\"  \"Don't!\" Freddy groaned.  Dave ignored him and stuck one hand inside his tunic and extended the other palm up toward the nearest Spitfire.  \"A Mark Five is the lace in your shoe!\" he cried. \"It is the frosting on mother's cake. It is the apple in her dumpling pie. It is the breath of spring. It is the kiss of your girl. It is....\"  Dave stopped short and shook his head.  \"No, that's wrong,\" he said. \"No girl would kiss that map of yours, Freddy. They'd.... Hey! So I'm talking to myself, huh?\"  It was true. Dave was simply throwing beautiful words at free air. Freddy had left him cold and walked over to Flight Lieutenant Barker, who had led the test hop patrol. Dave went over there scowling.  \"Fine business!\" he growled. \"I try to better his education and he walks out on me!\"  Freddy snorted in disgust and Flight Lieutenant Barker grinned.  \"You've got a bite, Dawson?\" he asked. \"Fleas, perhaps?\"  \"Huh, me?\" Dave echoed, and then turned beet red.  He still had one hand stuck inside his tunic. He pulled it out and they all laughed.  \"No kidding, though, Flight Lieutenant,\" he said. \"Isn't that Mark Five the best thing that ever came down the pike?\"  \"Down the pike?\" the senior officer murmured. Then brightening, \"Oh yes, I get what you mean. Quite! Best bus in the R.A.F. I'm all for having a go at a Jerry or two right now. I think we'll sweep the skies with the Mark Fives. But I hear that even better planes are on the drafting boards right now.\"  \"Phew, that's hard to believe!\" Freddy breathed. \"I mean, that anything could be better than the Mark Five.\"  \"Shame, Farmer!\" Barker said with a grin. \"And that statement from the lips of an Englishman!\"  \"Is he?\" Dave asked with a mock gasp.  \"Is he what?\" Barker wanted to know.  \"Is Freddy really and truly an Englishman?\" Dave replied and set himself to jump fast. \"From the way his eyes slant up, I'd always thought that he was a little bit....\"  Dave didn't finish the rest. And it was not Freddy making a dive for him that choked off his words. On the contrary it was the wail of the alarm siren mounted atop the Operations Office. As one man the three spun around and dashed over to the little hut that was the nerve center of the Squadron. And so did every other pilot on stand-to duty.  The Operations Officer met them at the door. He waved a slip of paper at them.  \"Zone Ten Spotters!\" he snapped. \"A single Messerschmitt One-Ten sneaking in from the coast. Altitude twenty one thousand. Course, due west. Intercept and teach the beggar a lesson. Chap's balmy to try it alone these days. Off with you. I'll give you further spotter reports in the air.\"  The half dozen pilots turned from the Operations Office door and raced back to the line of Spitfires. Mechanics already had the propellers ticking over. Dave skidded to a halt by his ship and practically jumped into the parachute harness and Mae West that his own mechanic held up for him. Then in a single leap he vaulted into the pit, snapped his safety harness in place, plugged in his radio jack, and reached for the throttle.  \"Get one of the dirty beggars for me, sir!\" the mechanic cried out. \"I come from Coventry, you know, sir!\"  \"Fair enough!\" Dave yelled and sent the Mark 5 Spitfire streaking straight out across the field. \"One Messerschmitt coming up, for Coventry! I mean, coming _down_!\"  Split seconds after the words popped off his lips he was in the air with wheels up, and curving up and around toward Zone 10. He did not have to glance at his map to determine the location of Zone 10. Its location, like the locations of all the zones that Eighty-Four guarded, was stamped indelibly on his brain. Zone 10 was on the coast south of Harwich, and he headed in that direction at top speed.  Out the corner of his eye he saw the other planes of the flight streaking along in the same direction. He grinned and jammed his hand against the already wide open throttle as though in so doing he might get more power out of the singing Rolls-Royce in the nose. And he knew that Freddy, Flight Lieutenant Barker, and the three other Spitfire pilots were doing the same thing. If the alarm had said two or more enemy aircraft were sighted the Eighty-Four lads would have dropped into formations of flights of three with Barker giving the orders for attack and so forth. That wasn't necessary, however, with just one lone Jerry plane in the offing. Instead, it was a case of first come, first crack at the Jerry. And so the six Eighty-Four lads were hopping their planes along as fast as they could so that they might be the one to get first licks at the Messerschmitt. True, that sort of thing wasn't strictly regulations, but the R.A.F. lads did it ... and often.  \"Ten shillings says you guys are wasting your time!\" Dave shouted happily into his radio mike.  \"Ten shillings says you've forgotten there's lots of radios in England, Dawson!\" Flight Lieutenant Barker snapped back at him in the earphones.  Dave gulped and went beet red to the roots of his hair. In his excitement he had clean forgotten that ground stations are tuned in on aircraft aloft all the time. Whatever is said up there goes right into the ears of the big shots, if they happen to be listening.  \"I mean when the formation reaches the objective!\" Dave said hurriedly. \"One Mark Five is more than enough for any One-Ten!\"  Barker's laugh came over the radio.  \"That's nice quick thinking, Dawson,\" he said. \"No wonder you've got more than a couple of the beggars in your bag.\"  \"Luck! Absolutely nothing else. I was present each time!\"  The voice was Freddy Farmer's. Dave opened his mouth to make a fitting retort, but checked himself. At that instant he heard the voice of the Operations officer back down on the field.  \"Tiger Flight!\" he called, using the code name for the patrol in the air. \"Change course twenty degrees north. Clouds ahead of you. Enemy aircraft climbing to twenty-four thousand. Operations to Tiger. That is all!\"  \"Tiger to Operations!\" Dave heard Flight Lieutenant Barker check back. \"Changing course. Right you are!\"  Dave had already swung his ship around more to the north, and was hunched forward over the stick staring hard at the mountain cloud bank looming up ahead. His eagle eyes swept it from side to side and from top to bottom. But he failed to see a single moving dot that could be the Messerschmitt One-Ten trying to climb up over the stuff. He saw nothing but that bank of clouds and the crazy shadows that marked nature's nooks and crags in the stuff.  And then he heard Freddy Farmer's excited voice coming into his earphones.  \"Enemy aircraft sighted! Five more degrees northward. Just under the tip of that finger of the stuff on the left!\"  Dave snapped his gaze in the direction indicated, and then suddenly saw the blurred dot curving upward and to the north. He grinned and gave a little shake of his head.  \"Old Sharp Eyes Freddy Farmer!\" he grunted. \"Boy! How does he do it?\"  \"Simple!\" the radio's earphones told him instantly. \"I jolly well fly with my eyes _open_. Try it sometime, old bean. You'll be surprised at the"]]]
