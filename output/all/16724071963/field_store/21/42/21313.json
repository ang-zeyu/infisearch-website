I can think of no better answer to this question than is contained in the Articles of Faith, formulated by the Prophet Joseph Smith soon after the Church of Christ was organized in this dispensation:  \"1. We believe in God the Eternal Father, and in his Son Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost.  \"2. We believe that men will be punished for their own sins, and not for Adam's transgression.  \"3. We believe that through the atonement of Christ all men may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel.  \"4. We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel are:--First, faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, repentance; third, baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.  \"5. We believe that a man must be called of God by prophecy, and by the laying on of hands, by those who are in authority, to preach the gospel and administer in the ordinances thereof.  \"6. We believe in the same organization that existed in the primitive church, viz.: apostles, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, etc.  \"7. We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, etc.  \"8. We believe the Bible to be the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly; we also believe the Book of Mormon to be the word of God.  \"9. We believe all that God has revealed, all that he does now reveal, and we believe that he will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the kingdom of God.  \"10. We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes; that Zion will be built upon this continent; that Christ will reign personally upon the earth: and that the earth will be renewed and receive its paradisaical glory.  \"11. We claim the privilege of worshiping Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and allow all men the same privilege, let them worship how, where, or what they may.  \"12. We believe in being subject to kings, presidents, rulers and magistrates, in obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.  \"13. We believe in being honest, true, chaste, benevolent, virtuous, and in doing good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the admonition of Paul, We believe all things, we hope all things, we have endured many things, and hope to be able to endure all things. If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.\"    CHAPTER IV.  Repentance.  The First Fruit of Faith.--The first fruit of faith is repentance. Repentance follows faith as naturally as kindness follows love, as obedience springs from reverence, as a desire to be congenial with, succeeds admiration for, one whose example is deemed worthy of emulation. God commands all men everywhere to repent. A desire to please him and become acceptable in his sight, leads the soul of faith of repentance.  A Gift from God.--No repentance is possible, however, without the Spirit of the Lord, which \"giveth light to every man that cometh into the world\" (D&C 84:45-47). This is what makes repentance, no less than faith, a gift from God. When his Spirit ceases to strive with men, they no longer desire to repent, and are delivered over to the buffetings of Satan. They deliver themselves over to those buffetings. They make their choice between the spirit of good and the spirit of evil, both of which are in the world, influencing the spirit of man, and they receive their wages from the master whom they list to obey.  The Spirit of God and the Holy Ghost.--A distinction should be drawn between the Spirit \"that enlighteneth every man,\" and the Holy Ghost, whose gifts are given to members of the Church of Christ. The former is an influence, proceeding from the Divine Presence; the latter a personage, one of the Godhead, concerning whom the Prophet Joseph says: \"The Father has a body of flesh and bones, as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us\" (D&C 130:22).  The Prophet says further upon this subject: \"There is a difference between the Holy Ghost and the gift of the Holy Ghost. Cornelius received the Holy Ghost before he was baptized, which was the convincing power of God unto him of the truth of the gospel, but he could not receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, until after he was baptized. Had he not taken this sign or ordinance upon him, the Holy Ghost which convinced him of the truth of God would have left him.\"--(\"Joseph Smith's Teachings,\" p. 69.)  Real Repentance.--Repentance is not that superficial sorrow felt by a criminal when caught in the act of wrong-doing--a sorrow not for sin, but for sin's detection, for being taken in transgression. Chagrin is not repentance. Mortification and shame, alone, bring no change of heart toward right living or right feeling. Repentance involves remorse; but even remorse is not all there is to repentance. In its highest meaning and fullest measure, repentance is equivalent to reformation--a resolve to \"sin no more,\" backed by conduct consistent with such a determination. \"Repentance is a thing that cannot be trifled with every day. Daily transgression and daily repentance is not that which is pleasing in the sight of God\" (\"Joseph Smith's Teachings,\" p. 136). \"By this ye may know if a man repenteth of his sins. Behold, he will confess them and forsake them\" (D&C 58:43). This is a real, genuine repentance. All who truly repent can be forgiven. These, and these alone, are ready for the cleansing process--baptism for the remission of sins. Without repentance, there is no forgiveness, and consequently no remission of sins.  Damnation No Part of the Gospel.--Damnation is no part of the gospel. Damnation or condemnation is simply the sad alternative, the inevitable consequence of rejecting the means of escape. When men hear the gospel and refuse to obey it, the come under condemnation. This cannot be helped. God would save them, but they will not be saved. They are free agents, and they damn themselves. Says Joseph the prophet: \"When God offers knowledge or a gift to a man, and he refuses to receive it, he will be damned.\" Not because God wishes to damn him, but because damnation is inevitable when one rejects the offer of salvation.  Sin, a Wilful Transgression of Law.--A man sins when he goes contrary to light and knowledge--that is, contrary to the light and knowledge that has come to him. One may blunder in ignorance, and suffer painful consequences; but one does not sin unless one knows better than to do the thing in which the sin consists.  Carlyle on Repentance.--\"Of all acts,\" says Carlyle, \"is not, for a man, repentance the most divine? The deadliest sin, I say, were that same supercilious consciousness of no sin;--that is death; the heart so conscious is divorced from sincerity, humility and fact; is dead: it is 'pure' as dead dry sand is pure.\"--\"Heroes and Hero-Worship,\" Lecture II.  Condemnation Measured by Culpability.--They who refuse to repent will be damned; they damn themselves by that refusal. But damnation is not necessarily permanent, and like salvation or exaltation, it exists in degrees. The degree of condemnation is according to the measure of culpability in those condemned. Even the damned, who repent, can be saved.  Some Souls Incapable of Repentance.--Some sinners cannot repent. Their sins are of such a heinous character as to preclude it. The spirit of repentance cannot lay hold upon them. T heir conduct has so grieved it, that it is completely withdrawn. Consequently they cannot repent, and that is what makes their case hopeless. If they could repent, they could be forgiven; but not being able to repent, the pardoning power cannot reach them. There would be no unpardonable sin if all sinners were capable of repentance. Those who cannot repent, who have committed the sin unpardonable, are called sons of perdition.  A Hint from Shakespeare.--Apropos of the inability to repent, Shakespeare gives a philosophic hint in his tragedy of \"Hamlet.\" Claudius, brother to the king of Denmark, has murdered the king in order to obtain his crown and queen. But remorse gnaws at the murderer's conscience--not a godly remorse, leading to repentance, but the terror that guilty souls feel at the prospect of judgment and retribution. Claudius kneels to pray, but can only pray with his lips, his heart being far from God. It is therefore no prayer at all. \"The soul's sincere desire\" is lacking.    \"My words fly up, my thoughts remain below;   Words without thoughts never to heaven go.\"  So says the murderous monarch, as he rises from his knees. Prior to his ineffectual attempt to supplicate the Throne of Grace, he thus soliloquizes:    \"My fault is past. But O what form of prayer   Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder?'   That cannot be, since I am still possessed   Of those effects for which I did the murder,   My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.   May one be pardoned and retain the offense?   * * * * * *   \"Try what repentance can: what can it not?   Yet what can it when one can not repent?\"   (\"Hamlet,\" Act. III, Scene III.)  The unpardonable sin involves utter recreancy to divine light and power previously possessed. It is the sin against the Holy Ghost; but one must first receive the Holy Ghost before he is capable of sinning against it. Such a sin can be committed only by men who have been equipped with every qualification for celestial glory.  The Sons of Perdition.--\"Thus saith the Lord, concerning all those who know my power, and have been made partakers there of, and suffered themselves, through the power of the devil, to be overcome, and to deny the truth and defy my power--  \"They are they who are the sons of perdition, of whom I say that it had been better for them never to have been born,  \"For they are vessels of wrath, doomed to suffer the wrath of God, with the devil and his angels "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50536"],["title","Gospel Themes: A Treatise on Salient Features of \"Mormonism\" (#8)"],["body","eternity;  \"Concerning whom I have said there is no forgiveness in this world nor in the world to come,  \"Having denied the Holy Spirit after having received it, and having denied the Only Begotten Son of the Father--having crucified him unto themselves, and put him to an open shame.  \"They are they who shall go away into the lake of fire and brimstone, with the devil and his angels,  \"And the only ones on whom the second death shall have any power;  \"Wherefore, he saves all except them.\" (D.&C. 76:31-37,44.)  The Saved and Glorified.--But the saved are rewarded according to their works. The glorified differ like the sun, moon, and stars, typifying, respectively, celestial, terrestrial, and telestial conditions. They who cannot abide any of these conditions, \"are not meet for a kingdom of glory,\" and the utterly disobedient, who will to abide in sin, are fated to \"remain filthy still\" (D&C 88:22-35).  The Celestial Glory.--The inheritors of celestial exaltation, the highest degree of glory, are they who render to the Great Giver the fulness of their obedience, manifesting a willingness to lay all upon the altar at his bidding. In short, \"to do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them\" (Abr. 3:25).  \"They are they who received the testimony of Jesus, and believed on his name and were baptized after the manner of his burial, being buried in the water in his name, and this according to the commandment which he has given,  \"That by keeping the commandments they might be washed and cleansed from all their sins, and receive the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands of him who is ordained and sealed unto this power.  \"And who overcome by faith, and are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, which the Father sheds forth upon all those who are just and true.  \"They are they who are the Church of the first born.  \"They are they into whose hands the Father has given all things--  \"They are they who are Priests and Kings, who have received of his fulness, and of his glory,  \"And are Priests of the Most High, after the order to Melchizedek, which was after the order of Enoch, which was after the order of the Only Begotten Son;  \"Wherefore, as it is written, they are Gods, even the sons of God--  \"Wherefore all things are theirs, whether life or death, or things present, or things to come, all are theirs and they are Christ's and Christ is God's. * * *  \"These shall dwell in the presence of God and his Christ for ever and ever.  \"These are they whom he shall bring with him, when he shall come in the clouds of heaven, to reign on the earth over his people.  \"These are they who shall have part in the first resurrection.  \"These are they who shall come forth in the resurrection of the just. * * *  \"These are they whose bodies are celestial, whose glory is that of the sun, even the glory of God, the highest of all, whose glory the sun of the firmament is written of as being typical.\"--(D.&C. 76:51-59, 62-65, 70.)  The Terrestrial Glory.--They who receive not the gospel here, but receive it hereafter; they who die without law; also \"honorable men of the earth, blinded by the craftiness of men;\"--  \"These are they who receive of his glory, but not of his fulness;  \"These are they who receive of the presence of the Son, but not of the fulness of the Father;  \"Wherefore they are bodies terrestrial, and not bodies celestial, and differ in glory as the moon differs from the sun.  \"These are they who are not valiant in the testimony of Jesus; wherefore they obtain not the crown over the kingdom of our God.\" (D.& C. 76:76-79.)  The Telestial World.--Concerning the inhabitants of the telestial world, it is written:  \"These are they who received not the gospel of Christ, neither the testimony of Jesus.  \"These are they who deny not the Holy Spirit.  \"These are they who are thrust down to hell.  \"These are they who shall not be redeemed from the devil, until the last resurrection, until the Lord, even Christ the Lamb, shall have finished his work.  \"These are they who receive not of his fulness in the eternal world, but of the Holy Spirit through the ministration of the terrestrial:  \"And also the telestial receive it of the administering of angels who are appointed to minister for them, or who are appointed to be ministering spirits for them, for they shall be heirs of salvation. * * *  \"These are they who are liars, and sorcerers, and adulterers and whoremongers, and whosoever loves and makes a lie.  \"These are they who suffer the wrath of God on the earth.  \"These are they who suffer the vengeance of eternal fire.  \"These are they who are cast down to hell and suffer the wrath of Almighty God, until the fulness of times when Christ shall have subdued all enemies under his feet, and shall have perfected his work. * * *  \"And they shall be servants of the Most High, but where God and Christ dwell they cannot come, worlds without end.\" (D.&C. 76:82-88, 103-106, 112.)  \"And the glory of the celestial is one, even as the glory of the sun is one.  \"And the glory of the terrestrial is one, even as the glory of the moon is one.  \"And the glory of the telestial is one, even as the glory of the stars is one, for as one star differs from another star in glory, even so differs one from another in glory in the telestial world.\" (D.&C. 76:96-98; 1 Cor. 15:40,41.)  A Nautical Illustration.--Thirty years ago I was crossing the Atlantic on an ocean liner. I was a first cabin passenger, and besides myself there were forty or fifty others in that part of the vessel. The second cabin had about twice as many passengers, and in the steerage were several hundred more. I found that the first cabin berths--secured by a fortunate few--were not only the best furnished, but the most favorably situated for comfort, convenience, and safety. The food was of the choicest, every possible courtesy was shown to the passengers, and they had the full freedom of the ship. They might go down into the second cabin, or lower down, into the steerage, at will, and return without hindrance or question. They had paid for these privileges, and were therefore entitled to them. The captain and other officers were their associates.  It was different in the second cabin. There the food was not so good, the berths were not so comfortable, and the privileges were fewer. The passengers there might descend into the steerage, but were not permitted upon the upper deck. In the steerage, conditions were even less favorable. The food was still poorer, and the restrictions yet more rigid. The occupants of that section were not allowed even in the second cabin. Having paid only for steerage accommodations, these were all they could consistently claim.  Viewing the situation, I said to myself, What a striking analogy of the final destiny of the human race, as set forth in the revelations of God! All men rewarded according to their works, and saved according to their merits in the eternal mansions of the Father! And I then and there resolved anew that I would be a first cabin passenger on the good ship Zion, over the ocean of life, into the haven of celestial glory.  Men's Desires a Basis of Judgment.--At a date subsequent to February 16, 1832, when Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon received that wonderful vision, portraying the celestial, terrestrial and telestial glories, the heavens were again opened to the Prophet, who thus describes what he saw:  \"I beheld the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell. I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire; also the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the Son. I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with gold. I saw Fathers Adam and Abraham, and my father and mother, my brother, Alvin, that has long since slept, and marveled how it was that he had obtained an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set His hand to gather Israel the second time, and had not been baptized for the remission of sins.  \"Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying--  \"All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God; also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom, for I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.  \"And I also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability, are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven.\" (History of the Church, Vol. 2, p. 380.)  Grades of Celestial Glory.--The Prophet also taught that there are grades of glory, even in the celestial kingdom; his exact language being: \"In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees\" (D&C 131:1).    CHAPTER V.  Water and Spirit Birth.  The Initial Ceremony.--As faith is the first principle of the gospel of Christ, so baptism is the initial ceremony. Baptism is twofold, corresponding to the soul, its subject, which is both spiritual and temporal. It signifies for that soul rebirth and illumination.  \"Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.\"  \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God\" (John 3:3,5).  So said the King of that kingdom, the only One empowered to prescribe conditions upon which men might become his subjects, or his fellow citizens, in that heavenly common-wealth where he shines first and foremost among the sons of God.  Jesus to Nicodemus.--Jesus, when he uttered those words, was speaking to Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, a Pharisee, and, as some suppose, a member of the Sanhedrim. Favorably inclined toward the unpopular Nazarene, yet too politic to be"]]]
