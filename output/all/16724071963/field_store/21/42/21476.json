Then they ceased from their sports and sat them down to picnic out of great hampers. They took out such viands! Ah me, I have not tasted cooked food in a twelve month! Who knows? I might have made myself known and been made much of among so many maidens; but I forebore, and came here to acquaint you with the fact.\"  A shout of laughter arose. \"Come on, boys,\" volunteered one.  \"But Lamanites!\"  \"I care not,\" decided Omner. \"We are outcasts among our own people, and we dare not return to Lehi-Nephi. For my part, a Lamanite maid is good enough to cook my food and live in my tepee.\"  \"Mine, too, if she be good looking. Omner, lead out.\"  As gaily as a crowd of school boys on a lark, they hurried through the woods. Others joined them on their way.  After the order of primitive man did they lie in wait for, and carry off, their mates. After the first panic, the girls, when they found the white-skinned men were inclined to be wooers, were nothing loth. So the camp was doubled that night, for the fifty of Omo's imagination had dwindled to twenty-four.  Also like primitive man, they fought for their mates. A dispute arose as to who should have a tall, slender girl who wore great golden ornaments in her black hair. She was well worth fighting for, as most of the men seemed to think, for the riot soon developed into a free-for-all fight. It threatened to turn the camp into a hospital, when Amulon, returning from the hunt, strode in and threw a buck from his shoulders.  Without more ado he threw himself into the midst of the melee and separated the opponents. As soon as the combatants saw who it was they decided to leave the decision with him.  Amulon listened to the story of the day's conquest, and patiently heard each claim. In the meantime he had casually looked the girl over. She stood with heaving bosom and scornful lips while the parley went on. She narrowed her eyes, however, and paid attention when this big, powerful man, so evidently the master, took a hand.  Finally he announced his decision, \"I shall keep her myself.\"  An ominous murmur arose.  \"He struck not a blow, but he seizes the plunder.\"  Not a man there but knew Amulon would make his claim good, but where he was sure of his ground he could afford to be politic.  He had exchanged a meaning look with the dark-eyed beauty, so he said magnanimously, \"Come, we will let the girl herself make the choice.\"  As soon as she understood the import of his words, she went over and stood up straight and tall by his side.  As with primitive man, the strongest had won out. So Amulon, garbed in a leopard's skin was wed to the Indian girl in the forest. He did not know until afterwards that she was Lamona, the daughter of the king of the Lamanites.  VII.  THE REVENGE.  Alma came in and hung his sickle on the wall. Although he assumed cheerfulness, his wife, who greeted him brightly over the pile of colored wool with which she was working, knew that he was sorely troubled. The room was airy, but simple, in its appointments. The floor was carpeted with rush mats and bears' skins, while the walls bore trophies of the chase in the form of antlers and deer heads. The supper looked inviting, and Alma came to it with the hunger born of hard labor in the fields.  \"I wish you would not work so hard,\" admonished Zara, laying her work aside. \"Amulon exempted you from labor.\"  Alma laughed shortly. \"Small satisfaction that, to rest in the shade while I see my brethren toiling in the hot sun, with hard taskmasters over them. When I refused to be king, I explained that we are all equal in the sight of the Lord. Now that disaster has come upon us, I am no better than they. The drivers will not even allow our people to pray aloud any more.\"  \"Surely Amulon has not forbidden that,\" gasped Zara, with dilated eyes.  The Lamanites had conquered all the southern provinces of the Nephites. The latter had only saved their lives by paying tribute of one-half their substance to their hard masters. At the time he fled from the armies of King Noah, Alma had traveled with his followers to a land of pure water where they built the beautiful city of Helem.  When Amulon and the gay priests stole the Indian girls and married them, King Laman had been wrathful. He sent out spies, located them where they were living and was getting ready to visit punishment upon them when his daughter Lamona, the wife of Amulon, came and threw herself at her father's feet and pleaded for mercy for the white men. She prevailed and the king of the Lamanites gladly welcomed his big son-in-law into favor. The head priest of King Noah rapidly resumed his old place of king's favorite. He introduced his own liberal schemes with the learning of the Nephites, and King Laman appropriated part of his kingdom for Amulon and his daughter to rule over. It so chanced that this province included the city of Helem.  When Amulon, accompanied by his dusky princess, and flanked by the barbarian armies, marched in, he was much surprised to find that the inhabitants were the followers of Alma. He found them easy prey, for their leader commanded them not to shed blood. The new ruler did not make it any easier for the captives because Alma had been a fellow priest of his who had won his sweetheart.  \"Something has got to be done,\" pronounced Alma, looking across at his wife. \"The people must break this yoke of bondage, for they cannot stand it any longer. I want you to unite with me in calling on the Lord for help.\"  Zara acquiesced, and when she arose a new light shone on her face as she rapidly unfolded to him her plan.  \"Why don't you reproach me for having brought you to this?\" he asked, drawing her tenderly toward him, for he realized that the task she had set herself was no easy one.  \"Nay, I have been happier here helping you than I ever was before, with all my luxury. I never realized what a blessing work is!\"  * * * * * * * *  Zara went and presented herself before Amulon. With mingled emotions they looked on one another. Zara noticed that the black-bearded, handsome man was more dominating than ever. The deep-eyed, dusky princess by his side was well suited to such a husband. Lamona, for her part, was curiously interested in her prince's former love. Amulon marked that Zara had retained her beauty, and looked very little older. He wondered what this slip of a woman who had preferred a soft-voiced missionary, could have to ask of him.  \"I have a petition to make, my lord,\" she began, bowing low.  \"And that is--\"  \"That you, your lady, and all your soldiery will dine with us at a banquet that we have prepared. There is much ill-feeling between the people and the soldiers. There has been a brutal quarrel or two, and we would seek to allay the trouble.\"  Amulon's eyes lighted with pleasure. It was long since he had eaten at a Nephite board, and he would like to sup with Zara. I think I can answer for the men.  They will come, like a horse to water. What say you, my girl? He turned to Lamona.  In thick, musical tones she graciously accepted the invitation.  On the day of the banquet Zara flitted among the wine jars, pouring into them a concoction brewed of the sleeping herb and the juice of the white poppy. Practically all of the Helemite's store would be guzzled down the throats of the thirsty horde in one night. The people of Alma would drink none. That was a part of the game.  That night at the feast, when the atmosphere was redolent with perfume and the air vibrant with music, Amulon cornered Zara and with his compelling gaze fixed on her face demanded that she drink with him the toast, \"For old time's sake,\" while Lamona watched with jealous eyes. Fearful that this virile leader would not drink enough for her purpose, she raised the goblet with quaking hand to her lips. They were almost driven white by a new fear. What if she herself should go to sleep in this dire exigency? Already the drugged soldiers were lying in heaps about the room. Some still kept up the feast, but even these were too far gone to notice that the halls were being strangely emptied of Nephites. Already their flocks and herds were being rapidly driven into the mountains, to be speedily followed by their owners, for the Helemites were abandoning their homes to their conquerors.  Outside in the starlit night, Zara a second time faced the desert. Seated on a horse, like another Mary, she fearfully clasped her little son to her bosom. He was Alma, son of Alma, future high priest of Zarahemla.  [Caption: THE SACRIFICIAL STONE.]    THE GADIANTONS.  \"And it came to pass that the Lamanites did hunt the band of robbers of Gadianton; * * insomuch that this band of robbers was utterly destroyed from among the Lamanites.\"  I.  THE GOSSIPS AT THE FOUNTAIN  [Illustration: THE LAMANITE GIRL WAS PRETTY.]  \"Hurry with your trifling, and lend me your cup that I may fill my jars,\" admonished Abish.  \"You are in a hurry, today?\" queried Sara lazily. The water in the fountain was low and it had to be scooped up from the bottom. Sara was trickling the cool liquid over her fingers quite oblivious to her own empty water pitchers standing; with gaping mouths on the curb.  The two women, Abish, servant in the house of Ahah, and Sara a servant of Seantum, often met at the fountain to gossip. At these times the possible union between the heads of their two houses was an inexhaustible subject, for Seantum, the proud Nephite, was a suitor for the hand of Ahah, a girl of mixed blood. Possible exigencies were suggested by the fact that Ahah was believed to love Hagoth, a Lamanite soldier; on the other hand her mother, the widowed Miriam, openly encouraged the suit of Seantum.  Truly the plaza in the beautiful suburb, Antionum was a pleasant place to loiter. The fountain was the life source of the city, and sooner or later everyone came there to drink. The gorgeous flowers of the tropics were so rich that the very bees became intoxicated and produced a honey that was "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50955"],["title","The Cities of the Sun (#5)"],["body","original nectar. A long line of Biblical looking girls carrying water jars on their heads extended from the fountain. Alternating with oval Madonna-like faces lit with lustrous eyes was the ardent gypsy coloring that told of mixed blood, for Lamanites and Nephites mingled freely in the community.  \"The servants at our house do not dawdle the day away,\" announced Abish severely, \"Our mistress looks after her household.\"  Sara felt the implied sneer, for the ancient halls of Seantum languished in bachelor neglect.  \"When the fair Ahah comes to preside over our household then may I have to run home heavy laden.\"  \"If your white faced master be not so slow that he lets Hagoth the Lamanite walk off with her before his eyes, I could tell him things--\"  \"A Lamanite,\" laughed Sara derisively. \"Ahah is not particular in her taste. But then, poor girl, she cannot help it, it is in her blood\"--Sara stopped short, for along the street, ringing with startling distinctness arose the cry, \"Cezoram, son of Cezoram, the chief judge, is dead.\"  For a moment there was absolute stillness, then wild clamor broke forth. Rumor, with her thousand tongues told that Cezoram, chief judge of all the Nephites, had not risen that morning and when an attendant went to wake him he found him lying naturally in his bed--dead. He had been struck upon the head as he slept, by an assassin who had come and gone as stealthily as the night air.  \"Who killed him?\" inquired Abish plucking at the arm of a man who passed with broad strides, muttering in his beard.  \"Who should it be but the Gadiantons, a handful of robbers, the mention of whose very name blanches the faces of the people and shakes the government. The Nephite officials are in secret league with them else we would not be so terrorized. Two chief judges slain within a year: Cezoram the elder struck down as he sat upon the judgment seat; his son and successor most foully murdered in his room! Is there no end to our endurance?\"  \"The Gadiantons!\" Bursting with her news Abish caught up her half-filled jars and hurried out through some deserted gardens that she might more quickly arrive home. As she picked her way through some overgrown vines she stopped suddenly. Her eye had caught sight of a familiar crest. Across the open space was the stalwart figure of Hagoth clothed in the tiger skin, his badge of knighthood. By his side in flaunting red petticoat walked a Lamanite girl. At the edge of the woods he returned the basket he had been carrying and the head of the plumed chief bent low over her.  \"Hagoth making love to an Indian; I wonder what Ahah will say?\"  Later she heard what her mistress had to say, and the servant's tale lost nothing in the telling of it.  II.  IN THE PATIO OF MIRIAM.  A party of four sat at the supper board of Miriam. It was spread in the roofed cloisters, midway between the patio where the margherites, like Psyche, flirted with their own fair image in the fountain, and the house, where, through gold embroidered gauze curtains, an occasional glimpse was had of a vast inner apartment set with mosaics.  Before the guests, who sat on mats, were spread tempting dulces (sweets) and heaped up salvers of the strange fruits of the tropics, the butter, eggs, and custards that grow on trees.  A servant brought cups of frothing chocolate to the two women, Ahah, whose gold crowned head rose like an aureole above the sea foam green of her gown, and her mother Miriam, massive and handsome despite her years. Shem, an aged traveler from the far south, was scooping out spoonfuls of papaya, a peptonized squash, while Seantum leaned against a marble pillar, his pale face with its weak features peering luridly through clouds of tobacco smoke.  The murder of the morning was under discussion.  \"Who are these Gadiantons?\" asked Shem, who was a stranger in the country. \"Methinks it was they who robbed a pack train of a merchant in our town. Though he carried the matter to the tribunal he could get no restitution.\"  \"Restitution!\" Miriam smiled grimly. \"How can we expect justice when the Nephite officials are in secret league with the robbers?\"  \"They have been a menace to our nation since their organization,\" hastily interposed Seantum, anxious to change the subject.  \"Indeed.\" Shem thoughtfully stroked his long beard while his Jewish face bent forward with interest.  \"The chief judges have been their victims ever since Kishkumen, an unscrupulous adventurer stabbed the judge Pahoran. The good Heleman would have suffered a like fate had not a servant of his overheard the plot and killed Kishkuman first. The blackguard followers of this professional assassin were organized into a secret society by Gadianton who introduced Satan's own machinations. After that the bandits fled to the mountain where they have subsisted ever since.\"  \"Cannot they be apprehended?\" asked Shem astonished.  \"They hold the mountain fastnesses and rout every army sent against them. Only occasionally do they infest the valleys to drive off the cattle,\" explained Seantum surprised at the other's ignorance.  \"They'd do well if they drove off only the cattle,\" remarked Miriam sharply. \"They swooped down upon a village when most of the men were away at the late war, and carried off the women and children.\"  \"The Gadianton robbers are dreadful men.\" Ahah shuddered. \"They brought one who had been taken prisoner to fight upon the sacrificial stone before Tubaloth, king of the Lamanites. With one foot chained to the rock and armed only with sword and shield he fought and vanquished eight warriors. The king granted him his freedom.\"  \"They will surely punish this slayer of Cezoram,\" suggested Shem.  \"Certainly, if they can find him.\"  \"Must a whole nation quail before those bloodthirsty barbarians,\" exclaimed Ahah passionately. Remembering that it was whispered that Seantum himself, like many of the officials, was helpless against the bandits, she asked suddenly: \"Seantum, why don't you lead an army against them?\"  \"Impossible!\" returned that effeminate youth. \"Perhaps our friend, the husky Lamanite, will undertake the task,\" he added sneeringly. \"They say that Tubaloth's young men are deserting the army to join the robbers. The king has sworn vengeance on them.\"  \"When did the Nephites have to call upon their ancient enemies for help?\" interposed Miriam haughtily.  The meal was finished and despite the fuming of Seantum and the open displeasure of her mother, Ahah excused herself on the plea of illness and fled to her room Although the servants came in and lighted the torches, for the three that remained, the light had gone out.  [Illustration: \"With one foot chained to the rock the Gadianton robber fought and vanquished eight warriors.\"]  III.  THE BALCONY.  Ahah threw herself in the hammock on the balcony that her apartment opened on. She was shaken with rage, but the more violent the passion the sooner does it consume itself. Destruction would have descended on the head of Hagoth, if it had appeared at that moment; as it was her anger had just three hours to cool.  The stars hung low in the tropic heavens; a nearby field was illumined by the phosphorescent glow of flitting fireflies; below a tree burst into a galaxy of white stars.  As she clenched her small hands until the nails cut the palms, Ahah was not in a mood to contemplate scenery.  \"Flirting with a Lamanite frump, indeed! How do I know that Hagoth has not a dozen Indian loves among his own people?\" Hitherto Ahah had been so engrossed by her condescension in loving a mere Lamanite, that the possibility of anyone else loving him had never occurred to her. That Hagoth had been whole souled in his devotion to her she admitted. Nothing wins a woman quite so quick as the knowledge that a man has staked his all on her. Else why had she stooped to love him?  Slowly she lived over their acquaintance; all the details were graven on her brain. It had been romantic from the start. The horses of the Lamanite king were running away, dragging the broken chariot behind them. The driver had been hurled out in turning the corner and Tubaloth himself was reeling, when the careening animals were stopped by the impact of a lithe body hurled full at their heads. The catapult was Hagoth who thereafter was knighted and received the order of the tiger, a distinction he valued less than the murmured thanks of a mother who caught up her little brown baby that had been playing in the road directly in the way of the runaway. Since then Ahah's every meeting with Hagoth had tightened the grip on her heart. Yet the thing that made her angriest of all was that she should care so much.  [Illustration: HALL OF THE MONOLITHS, MITLA]  [Illustration: PALACE RUINS AT MITLA]  When a plumed crest of sable hue loomed up above the passion flower of the balcony she started up as if she had not been looking long for that apparition.  As Hagoth swung himself easily in front of her she faced him with the accusation, \"You are late.\"  \"I have been watching the lights below for hours. I thought you were there with Seantum.\"  \"Did he stay so long with mother? I left them hours ago--to wait here alone, while you, forsooth, amused yourself with an Indian girl--Ugh.\"  \"Ahah!\"  \"I tell you, you were seen walking in the woods with her, whispering to her, carrying her basket, and they said she was pretty,\" she finished with a wail.  \"It is a mistake. I--\"  \"A mistake! Look at me,\" she cried fiercely, \"You, a Lamanite, an associate of laboring wenches, have made me weep. I, Ahah, who do not shed tears once in five years have wept this night over you.\" She laughed bitterly.  \"But the girl gave me some information from a relative of hers.\"  \"What could I expect, I who without reason, against the warnings of my friends, the opposition of my relatives, have squandered my attention on you.\"  \"Ahah you possess the best part of my life, but if I am bringing you such unhappiness--\"  That brought her to terms. Her face shone"]]]
