Now I was panicked, wild with a nerve-destroying fright. I'm not a coward. I set up a radar transmitter in Okinawa within ninety feet of a nest of Japs. That was something real. I could face it. But under two suns and a pair of little moons, with weird people I knew were not human--all right; I was a coward. I steadied myself in the saddle, trying with every scrap of my will to calm myself. If this was a nightmare, well, I'd had some beauties--  But it wasn't. I knew that. The frost hurting my face, the sound of shod steel on stones, the vivid colors around me, told me I was wide awake. Dreams are not techni-colored. And through all this I was riding hell-for-leather, my knees gripped on the saddle, guiding the horse with the grip of my thighs--and I'd never been on a horse's back in my life. Rode--and rode--  We had ridden about seven miles, and stopped twice to breathe the horses, but we were still beneath the great archway of trees. The sky's pink sunset light had faded; the land was flooded with a blue, fluorescent starlight, a light I'd never seen before. I strained my eyes upward through the black foliage. I suppose I had some confused idea of guessing _when_ I was by the stars. But the view to the North was hidden by mountains, and I don't know one constellation from another, with that single exception. A glance at Karamy, in this fright, un-nerved me; I touched the reins, dropped back till I rode between Gamine and the girl in flame-color. \"Adric,\" the spell-singer saluted coolly, and the girl in the winged cloak threw back her hood; I saw dark eyes watching me from a pure, sweet young face. Before the luminous innocence of those eyes I wanted to cry out in protest. I was not Adric, warlock of Narabedla. I was just a poor guy named Mike, I was just--me. I rode beside Gamine for minutes, trying to think what I would say.  Gamine's musical voice was not raised, yet it carried perfectly to my ears. \"You seem wholly yourself again.\"  I didn't answer. What was there to say? Still, there seemed to be sympathy in the sharply-edged tones. \"You will remember--perhaps too much--at the Dreamer's Keep.\"  \"Gamine,\" I asked, \"Who is _Narayan_?\"  I saw the blue robes quiver a little; across from Gamine, I saw a curious flickering look pass across the face of the girl in the orange winged cloak. But Gamine's answer was perfectly even and disinterested. \"The name is not familiar to me. Have you heard it, Cynara?\"  The girl did not answer, only moved her dark head a little.  \"I should know,\" I mused. But the name _Cynara_ had touched another of those live wires within my mind. Narayan. Cynara. Cynara and Narayan! If I could only remember! Suddenly I turned. \"Gamine--who are you?\" Gamine sat quiet, eerily motionless on the tall horse. The robed figure seemed to blend into the starlit shadows around us. I had the sudden feeling of having re-lived this moment before, then the veiled shoulders twitched impatiently.  \"Is this an inquisition?\"  Rebuked, and stung by the arrogant voice, I touched my heel to my horse's flank and rode forward to rejoin Karamy. Gamine! The hell with Gamine!  For several minutes the road had been climbing, and now we topped the summit of a little rise and abruptly the trees came to an end. By tacit consent we all drew our horses to a walk. We stood atop the lip of a broad bowl of land, perhaps thirty miles across, filled to the brim with thick dark forest. Far out in this valley lay a cleared space, and in the center of that space lay a great tower; but not a slender and fairylike spire like the Towers of Rainbow City. This was a massive donjon thrusting heavy shoulders upward into the moon-washed sky.  The Keep of the Dreamers.  Something in me murmured, \"This is the forest where the Dreamer walks!\"--or had the murmured voice come from Gamine, motionless behind me? Karamy rode eagerly, her face drawn tautly together, her slim tanned hands clenched on the reins. All this while I was Mike Kenscott--but a Mike who watched himself without knowing what he would do next, like those puzzling nightmares where a man is both actor and audience to some mummery being played. I watched myself say and do things as if I were two men at once. In effect, I suppose I was.... Karamy turned in her saddle, facing me.  \"Adric,\" she murmured, \"Lead me where the Dreamer walks!\"  I knew, with a sudden surety, that because of some bond between the freed Dreamer and myself, I could do this. But again, something outside myself told me what to say. \"That bond is broken, Karamy. Did you not break it yourself? How can I guide you then?\" And for my reward I saw unsureness leap in her cat's eyes. That shot had told. Karamy _had_ been guessing, then!  The answer had shaken her. But this woman was a past mistress at subtlety. She murmured, \"It can be forged again. That I swear.\"  Ah, but I knew how far to trust even Karamy's oaths!  We had dipped down into the bowl of forest and we were riding through thick woods, along a road that struggled windingly, with many curves and sharp corners. Adric knew this country; his knowledge made Mike Kenscott shiver. He had hunted here, and for no fourlegged game. As if Karamy read my thoughts I hear her low laughter. \"So. My wrist aches for the feel of a falcon. We'll hunt here again--soon, you and I!\" I was partly bewildered by her words, but they gave me a shivering excitement, an insidious thrill.  Behind me, I heard Gamine's chanting take on a new note. The words were still indistinguishable, but the very tune screamed warning. A pulse began to twitch jerkily in my neck.  Without any warning, the road twisted. Karamy and I spurred our horses and rounded the curve in one swift, racing burst of speed--and were fairly in the trap before we knew it.  It was the agonized whinny of my horse, and the jolt of my body righting itself automatically from the plunging animal beneath me, that made me realize we had ridden straight on a chevaux-de-frise. I yelled, cursing, shouting to Karamy to get back, get back, but her own momentum carried her on; I saw her light body fly out of the saddle and disappear. The others, rounding the curve in a wild dash, were fairly on the barrier already, and the place was a bedlam, a scramble, with riderless horses milling in a melee of curses and the screaming of women and the threshing of feet. I was out of my saddle in an instant, thrusting Gamine's mount back from the stabbing points fixed invisibly against the dark barrier in the road, shouting to Evarin and Idris. Evarin leaped to my side, catching at Karamy's wild horse, while I tore madly at the barrier where the woman had been thrown. Idris bore down on me, mounted. \"Go round!\" he shouted. I plunged through the underbrush at the side of the road, with hasty feet twice snaked by long creepers. Past the barrier, the road lay open and deserted, and Karamy lay in a shimmer of crumpled silk, motionless. \"Gamine, Evarin--\" I bellowed, \"No one's here! Quick, Karamy is hurt--\"  The head and shoulders of Idris' horse thrust through the thick brushwood. \"Is she dead?\" the dwarf muttered. I bent, thrusting my hand to her breasts. \"Her heart's beating. Only stunned. Get down,\" I ordered. Idris scrambled, monkey-fashion, from the saddle. I lifted the woman in my arms, but she did not move or open her eyes. Idris touched my arm.  \"Put her on the saddle,\" he suggested, and together we laid her across the pommel. Suddenly, the dwarf cried out.  \"What?\" I asked sharply.  \"I hear--\"  I never knew what Idris heard. His head vanished, as if snatched away by a giant's hand; a rough grip collared me, choking fingers clawed at my throat, a thousand rockets went off in my head and I lay sprawling in the brushwood, eating dust, with an elephant sitting on my chest and threatening hands gouging my throat. My last coherent thought before the breath went out of me, was--  \"I'm waking up!\"     CHAPTER SIX  Narayan   But I wasn't. When I came to--it could only have been a few seconds that I was unconscious--it was to hear Evarin snarling curses and Idris barking incoherently with rage. I heard Karamy screaming my name, and started to answer, but the steely fingers were still at my throat and with that weight on top of me, I hadn't a chance. The fall, or something, had knocked Adric clean out of me. I was fuzzy-brained, but sane. I was an innocent bystander again.  I could see Evarin and Idris in the road, casting wary glances at the brushwood all around them. I could just make out the face of the man who was holding me pinned to the earth with his body. He had the general build of a hippopotamus and a face to match. I squirmed, but the threatening face came closer and I subsided. The man could have broken me in two like a match.  Around me in the thicket were dozens of crouching forms, fantastic snipers with weapons at their shoulders. Weapons that could have been crossbows or disintegrators, or both. \"Enter Buck Rogers,\" I thought wearily. I was beginning to feel faint again, and old welter-weight on my stomach didn't help any. Abruptly he moved, delicate fingers knotting a gag in my gasping mouth; then the intolerable weight on my chest was suddenly gone and I sucked in air with relief. The fat man eased himself cautiously up, and I felt a steel point caress my lowest rib. The threat didn't need words. I could see the Narabedlans gathered, a tight little knot in the road. The snipers around me were still holding their weapons, but the fat man commanded in a low voice \"Don't fire! They're sure to have guards riding behind them--\" the voice died to a rasping mutter, and I lay motionless, trying to dredge up some of Adric's memories that might help; but the only thing I got was a fleeting memory of my own football days and a flying tackle by a Penn State halfback that had knocked me ten feet. Adric was gone; clean gone.  The Narabedlans were talking in low"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50566"],["title","Falcons of Narabedla (#7)"],["body","nes, Gamine the rallying-point round which they clustered. Evarin had his sword out, but even he did not step toward the mantling thicket. Cynara was holding Evarin's arm, protesting wildly. \"No, no, no, no! They'll kill Adric--\"  Suddenly, between two breaths, the road was alive with mounted men. Who they were, I never knew; I was quickly dragged to my feet and jerked away. Behind me I heard shouting, and steel, and saw thin flashes of colored flame. Spots of black danced before my eyes as I stumbled along between two captors. I felt my sword dragged from my scabbard. Oh well, I thought wryly, now that Adric's run out on the party I don't know how to use it anyway.  Under the impetus of a knife I found myself clambering awkwardly into a saddle, felt the horse running beneath me. There wasn't a chance of getting away, and the frying pan couldn't be much worse than the fire, anyway.  Behind us the noises of battle died away. The horse I rode raced, sure-footed, into the darkness. I hung on with both hands to keep from falling; only Adric's habitual reflexes kept me from tumbling ignominiously to the ground. I don't think I had any more coherent thoughts until the jolting rhythm broke and we came out of the forest into full moonlight and a glare of open fires.  I raised my head and looked around me. We were in a grove, tree-ringed like a Druid temple, lit by watch-fires and the waver of torches. Tents sprouted in the clearing, giving it an untidy, gypsy appearance; at the back was a white frame house with a flat roof and wide doors, but no windows.  Men and women were coming out of the tents everywhere. The talk was a Pentecost of tongues, but I heard one name, repeated over and over again.  \"Narayan! Narayan!\" the shouts clamored.  A slim young man, blond, dressed in rough brown, came from one of the larger tents and walked deliberately toward me. The crowd drew back, widening to let him approach; before he came within twenty yards he made a signal to one of the men to untie my gag and let me down. I stood, clinging to the saddle, exhausted; the young man came forward until he could almost have touched me, and studied my face dispassionately. At last he raised his head, turning to the fat man, my captor.  \"This isn't Adric,\" he said. \"This man is a stranger.\"  I should have been relieved; I don't know why I wasn't. Instead, my first reaction was bewilderment and angry annoyance. How could he tell that? I was as furiously embarrassed as if I'd been accused of wearing stolen clothing. My beefy captor was as angry as I was. \"What do you mean, this isn't Adric?\" he demanded belligerently, \"We took him right out of their accursed cavalcade! If it isn't Adric, who is it?\"  \"I wish I knew,\" Narayan muttered under his breath. His eyes, still fixed on my face, were level, disconcerting. He was tall and straightly built, with pale blond hair cut square around his shoulders like a squire from a Provencal ballad, and grey eyes that looked grave, but friendly. I liked his looks, but he had a trace of the uncanny stillness I'd noticed in old Rhys, in Gamine. For a moment I decided to tell my whole fantastic story to this man with the grave eyes. He would surely believe it. But to my surprise, he spoke and called me Adric; definitely, as if he had forgotten his doubts.  \"Adric,\" he said, \"Do you still remember me? Or did Karamy take that too?\"  I sighed. I didn't dare tell the truth, and I felt too chilled and exhausted and disoriented to lie convincingly. Yet lie I must, and do it well.  The fat man scowled and fronted Narayan. \"Karamy--Zandru's eyelashes!\" he growled. \"Look you, did Brennan come back this afternoon? He knows his way around Rainbow City. Ask Adric what happened to Brennan!\"  The clamoring broke out around us again, but Narayan never took his eyes from my face as he answered gently, \"There is always danger, Raif. Blame no man unjustly. Brennan knew he faced all the dangers of Rainbow City. And even Adric is not to blame if a she-witch has him under her spells.\"  \"Traitor!\" Raif snarled at me and spat.  I loosed the saddle-horn and stepped dizzily forward. \"You might try asking me,\" I said with a weary anger.  \"Are you Adric of the Crimson Tower?\" fat Raif snapped.  \"I don't know--\" I said tiredly. \"I don't know, I don't know!\"  Narayan's eyes met mine in skeptical puzzlement. Abruptly he put out one hand and took my wrist in a firm grip. \"We can't talk here, whoever you are,\" he said, \"Come along.\"  He led me through the thinning crowd into the frame house at the grove's edge; Raif and one other man trailed after us, the rest clustering hive-fashion around the door. Inside, in a great timbered room, a fire burned and glowing globes chased away darkness. I went gratefully toward the fire; I was stiff with riding and I felt chilled and stupid and empty with the cold. From a wood settle near the fire, a woman rose. She was slight and dark and around her shoulders the luminescent shimmer of her winged cloak flowed like another flame. Cynara.  \"Adric--\" she said half-aloud, holding out her hands. I took them, partly because she seemed to expect it, partly because the girl seemed the only thing real in a world gone haywire. She flung her arms suddenly around my neck and held herself to me with a shy deliberation. \"Adric, Adric, Adric--\" she begged, \"I slipped away in the dark--I suppose Gamine knows--but they'll never find me here, no, never--\"  Narayan's hand pulled the girl sternly away from me; she shrank before the annoyance in his eyes. \"Please--Narayan, no--\"  The blond man looked at her without speaking for long moments. At last he said gravely, \"Sister, you must go back to Narabedla. I would not make you go if there was another way; but you must, for a time.\" He beckoned to one of the men. \"Kerrel--\" he commanded, \"Take Cynara back to Rainbow City, but don't get caught. Cynara; tell them you were lost in the woods, or that you were caught and escaped.\"  The childish mouth trembled, and she turned to me appealingly, but I gave a little shrug. What was I supposed to do? Narayan gave Cynara a gentle push. \"Go with Kerrel, little sister,\" he ordered in a quiet voice; Kerrel took her arm and they hurried out of the room, the winged cloak she wore fluttering on her shoulders. Narayan motioned to Raif to follow them through the door. \"I'll talk with him alone.\"  Raif's thick lips set stubbornly. He looked as if he'd be nasty in a fight. \"If he's Adric, and if he's under Karamy's devilments, then--\"  \"I have faced Adric, and Karamy too,\" said Narayan with a friendly grin at the man. \"Get out, Raif; you're not my bodyguard, or even my nurse!\"  The fat man accepted dismissal reluctantly, and Narayan came to my side. There was real friendliness in his grin. \"Well,\" he said, \"Now we will talk. You cannot kill me, any more than I could kill you, so we may as well be truthful with each other. Why did you leave us, Adric? What has Karamy done to you this time?\"  The room reeled around me. I put out a hand to steady myself--when the dizziness cleared, Narayan's arm was around my shoulders and he was holding me up with a strength surprising in his slight frame. He let me settle down on the seat Cynara had left. \"You have been roughly handled,\" he said in apology, \"Just sit still a minute. My men--\" he made a deprecating little gesture, \"have had orders. And if I know Karamy's ways, you've been heavily drugged for a long time.\" His eyes studied me intently. \"Better come and have a drink. And--when did you eat last? You look half starved. That's the way of the _sharig_--\"  I rubbed my forehead. \"I can't remember,\" I told him honestly.  \"I thought so. Come along.\" Narayan went into the next room, assuming that I would follow and that I knew my way around. After the insanely furnished rooms in Rainbow City, I was a little surprised when the next room proved to be a strictly functional and ordinary kitchen, equipped with the usual items. Out of a relatively un-extraordinary icebox he assembled something that looked rather like the food I was accustomed to from the 20th century, and poured some kind of liquid into an oddly shaped glass. He motioned me into a chair and set the things on the table. \"Here, eat this. I know the drugs they give you; you'll have more sense when you've eaten. We've plenty of time to talk, all night if we choose.\" He saw me glance side-wise at the glass, laughed sketchily, and from the same bottle poured himself a drink and sat down opposite me, sipping it slowly. \"Go ahead. I won't poison you till I find out what Karamy's up to.\"  I laughed apologetically and started eating, with a mental shrug. It had been at least forty-eight hours since I had last tasted food, and I did justice to the plateful before me. Narayan sipped his drink--which, when I tasted mine, appeared to be excellent cognac--and watched me; and when I finally pushed the empty plate aside, he put back his glass and said \"Now. Who are you, and what happened?\"  I felt better and stronger; more like myself than I'd felt since Rhys had catapulted me into this world. But now that I was on the carpet, I felt I must talk fast and convincingly before those searching grey eyes.  \"Karamy had me shut in the Tower,\" I told him, \"I was freed today, and we were on our way to the Dreamers Keep. Then your men came along. I didn't know if I was being rescued or captured. I still don't.\" I stared with purposeful blankness at Narayan; he stared back and I could feel him debating what to do and say. Obviously, an Adric sane and glib and possibly untruthful was a different thing than an Adric too bewildered and shaken to tell anything but the truth. Finally Narayan said, \"I'm not sure what I ought to do or say, Adric. The bond between us isn't as strong as it was. You know that.\"  I nodded, perturbed. Adric's thoughts seemed to be surging back, insidiously, as if Narayan held the key to unlock them. What crazy drama was going to be unfolded in my mind now? "]]]
