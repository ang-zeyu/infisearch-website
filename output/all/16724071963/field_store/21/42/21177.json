Doors were opened all along the corridor; light steps passed Priscilla’s room. She heard the rustle of silk and the sweet, high tinkle of girlish laughter.  She stayed in her room till the last footsteps had died away, then in desperation made a rush for it, flew down the wide stairs in a bashful agony, and, as a matter of course, entered the spacious dining-hall by the door devoted to the dons.  A girl’s life at one of the women’s colleges is supposed to be more or less an unfettered sort of existence. The broad rules guiding conduct are few and little more than those which must be exercised in any well-organized family. But there is the unspoken etiquette made chiefly by the students themselves, which fills the place like an atmosphere, and which can only be transgressed at the risk of surly glances and muttered comments and even words of derision.  No student was expected to enter the hall by the dons’ entrance, and for this enormity to be perpetrated by a fresher immediately made her the cynosure of all eyes. Poor Priscilla was unconscious of any offense. She grew scarlet under the gaze of the merciless young eyes and further added to her sins by sitting down at one of the tables at the top of the hall.  No one reproved her in words or requested her to take a lower seat, but some rude giggles were not inaudible; and Priscilla, who would thankfully have taken her dinner in the scullery, heard hints about a certain young person’s presumption, and about the cheek of those wretched freshers, which must instantly be put down with a high hand.  Priscilla had choked over her soup, and was making poor way with the fish that followed, when suddenly a sweet, low voice addressed her.  “This is your first evening at St. Benet’s,” said the voice. “I hope you will be happy. I know you will, after a little.”  Priscilla turned and met the full gaze of lovely eyes, brown like a nut, soft and deep as the thick pile of velvet, and yet with a latent flash and glow in them which gave them a red, half-wild gleam now and then. The lips that belonged to this face were slightly parted in a smile; the smile and the expression in the eyes stole straight down with a glow of delicious comfort into Priscilla’s heart.  “Thank you,” she said in her stiff, wooden tone; but her eyes did not look stiff, and the girl began to talk again.  “I believe my room is next to yours. My name is Oliphant— Margaret Oliphant, but every one calls me Maggie. That is, of course, I mean my friends do. Would you like to come into my room and let me tell you some of the rules?”  “Thank you,” said Priscilla again. She longed to add, “I should love beyond words to come into your room”; but instead she remarked icily, “I think Miss Heath has given me printed rules.”  “Oh, you have seen our dear Dorothea— I mean Miss Heath. Isn’t she lovely?”  “I don’t know,” answered Priscilla. “I think she’s rather a plain person.”  “My dear Miss”— I have not caught your name— “you really are too deliciously prosaic. Stay here for a month, and then tell me if you think Dorothea— I mean Miss Heath— plain. No, I won’t say any more. You must find out for yourself. But now, about the rules. I don’t mean the _printed_ rules. We have, I assure you, at St. Benet’s all kinds of little etiquettes which we expect each other to observe. We are supposed to be democratic and inclined to go in for all that is advanced in womanhood. But, oh dear, oh dear! let any student dare to break one of our own little pet proprieties, and you will see how conservative we can be.”  “Have I broken any of them?” asked Priscilla in alarm. “I did notice that every one stared at me when I came into the hall, but I thought it was because my face was fresh, and I hoped people would get accustomed to me by and by.”  “You poor, dear child, there are lots of fresh faces here besides yours. You should have come down under the shelter of my wing, then it would have been all right.”  “But what have I done? Do tell me. I’d much rather know.”  “Well, dear, you have _only_ come into the hall by the dons’ entrance, and you have _only_ seated yourself at the top of the table, where the learned students who are going in for a tripos take their august meals. That is pretty good for a fresher. Forgive me, we call the new girls freshers for a week or two. Oh, you have done nothing wrong. Of course not, how could you know any better? Only I think it would be nice to put you up to our little rules, would it not?”  “I should be very much obliged,” said Priscilla. “And please tell me now where I ought to sit at dinner.”  Miss Oliphant’s merry eyes twinkled.  “Look down this long hall,” she said. “Observe that door at the further end— that is the students’ door; through that door you ought to have entered.”  “Yes— well, well?”  “What an impatient ‘well, well.’ I shall make you quite an enthusiastic Benetite before dinner is over.”  Priscilla blushed.  “I am sorry I spoke too eagerly,” she said.  “Oh, no, not a bit too eagerly.”  “But please tell me where I ought to have seated myself.”  “There is a table near that lower entrance, Miss——”  “Peel,” interposed Priscilla. “My name is Priscilla Peel.”  “How quaint and great-grandmotherly. Quite delicious! Well, Miss Peel, by that entrance door is a table, a table rather in a draught, and consecrated to the freshers— there the freshers humbly partake of nourishment.”  “I see. Then I am as far from the right place as I can be.”  “About as far as you can be.”  “And that is why all the girls have stared so at me.”  “Yes, of course; but let them stare. Who minds such a trifle?”  Priscilla sat silent for a few moments. One of the neat waiting-maids removed her plate; her almost untasted dinner lay upon it. Miss Oliphant turned to attack some roast mutton with truly British vigor.  By and by Priscilla’s voice, stiff but with a break in it, fell upon her ear.  “I think the students at St. Benet’s must be very cruel.”  “My dear Miss Peel, the honor of the most fascinating college in England is imperiled. Unsay those words.”  Maggie Oliphant was joking. Her voice was gay with badinage, her eyes brimful of laughter. But Priscilla, unaccustomed to light repartee or chaff in any form, replied to her with heavy and pained seriousness.  “I think the students here are cruel,” she repeated. “How can a stranger know which is the dons’ entrance and which is the right seat to take at table? If nobody shows her, how can a stranger know? I do think the students are cruel, and I am sorry— very sorry I came.”     CHAPTER III AN UNWILLING “AT HOME”   Most of the girls who sat at those dinner-tables had fringed or tousled or curled locks. Priscilla’s were brushed simply away from her broad forehead. After saying her last words, she bent her head low over her plate and longed even for the protection of a fringe to hide her burning blushes. Her momentary courage had evaporated; she was shocked at having betrayed herself to a stranger; her brief fit of passion left her stiffer and shyer than ever. Blinding tears rushed to Priscilla’s eyes, and her terror was that they would drop on to her plate. Suppose some of those horrid girls saw her crying? Hateful thought. She would rather die than show emotion before them.  At this moment a soft, plump little hand was slipped into hers and the sweetest of voices said:  “I am so sorry anything has seemed unkind to you. Believe me, we are not what you imagine. We have our fun and our prejudices, of course, but we are not what you think we are.”  Priscilla could not help smiling, nor could she resist slightly squeezing the fingers which touched hers.  “You are not unkind, I know,” she answered; and she ate the rest of her dinner in a comforted frame of mind.  After dinner one of the lecturers who resided at Heath Hall, a pleasant, bright girl of two- or three-and-twenty, came and introduced herself, and presently took Priscilla with her to her own room, to talk over the line of study which the young girl proposed to take up. This conference lasted some little time, and then Priscilla, in the lecturer’s company, returned to the hall for tea.  A great many girls kept coming in and out. Some stayed to have tea, but most helped themselves to tea and bread and butter and took them away to partake of in their own private rooms.  Maggie Oliphant and Nancy Banister presently rushed in for this purpose. Maggie, seeing Priscilla, ran up to her.  “How are you getting on?” she asked brightly. “Oh, by-the-by, will you cocoa with me to-night at half-past ten?”  “I don’t know what you mean,” answered Priscilla. “But I’ll do it,” she added, her eyes brightening.  “All right, I’ll explain the simple ceremony when you come. My room is next to yours, so you’ll have no difficulty in finding me out. I don’t expect to have any one present except Miss Banister,” nodding her head in Nancy’s direction, “and perhaps one other girl. By-by, I’ll see you at half-past ten.”  Maggie turned to leave the hall, but Nancy lingered for a moment by Priscilla’s side.  “Wouldn’t you like to take your tea up to your room?” she asked. “We most of us do it. You may, you know.”  “I don’t think I wish to,” answered Priscilla in an uncertain voice.  Nancy half turned to go, then came back.  “You are going to unpack by and by, aren’t you?” she asked.  “Oh, yes, when I get back to my room.”  “Perhaps you ought to know beforehand; the girls will be coming to call.”  Priscilla raised her eyes.  “What girls?” she asked, alarm in her tone.  “Oh, most of the students in your corridor. They always call on a fresher the first night in her room. You need not bother yourself about them; they’ll just talk for a little while and then go away. What is the matter, Miss Peel? Maggie has told me your name, you see.”  “What you tell me sounds so very— very formal.”  “But it isn’t— not really. Shall I come and help you to entertain them?”  “I wish——” began"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4989"],["title","A Sweet Girl Graduate (#3)"],["body","iscilla. She hesitated; the words seemed to stick in her throat.  “What did you say?” Nancy bent forward a little impatiently.  “I wish— yes, do come,” with a violent effort.  “All right, you may expect me.”  Nancy flew after Maggie Oliphant, and Priscilla went slowly up the wide, luxurious stairs. She turned down the corridor which led to her own room. There were doors leading out of this corridor at both sides, and Priscilla caught glimpses of luxurious rooms bright with flowers and electric light. Girls were laughing and chatting in them; she saw pictures on the walls and lounges and chairs scattered about. Her own room was at the far end of the corridor. The electric light was also brightening it, but the fire was unlit, and the presence of the unpacked trunk, taking up a position of prominence on the floor, gave it a very unhomelike feel. In itself the room was particularly picturesque. It had two charming lattice windows, set in deep square bays. One window faced the fireplace, the other the door. The effect was slightly irregular, but for that very reason all the more charming. The walls of the room were painted light blue; there was a looking-glass over the mantel-piece set in a frame of the palest, most delicate blue. A picture-rail ran round the room about six feet from the ground, and the high frieze above had a scroll of wild roses painted on it in bold, free relief.  The panels of the doors were also decorated with sprays of wild flowers in picturesque confusion. Both the flowers and the scroll were boldly designed, but were unfinished, the final and completing touches remaining yet to be given.  Priscilla looked hungrily at these unexpected trophies of art. She could have shouted with glee as she recognized some of her dear, wild Devonshire flowers, among the groups on the door panels. She wondered if all the rest of the students were treated to these artistic decorations and grew a little happier and less homesick at the thought.  Priscilla could have been an artist herself had the opportunity arisen, but she was one of those girls all alive with aspiration and longing who never up to the present had come in the way of special culture in any style.  She stood for some time gazing at the groups of wild flowers, then remembering with horror that she was to receive visitors that night, she looked round the room to see if she could do anything to make it appear homelike and inviting.  It was a nice room, certainly. Priscilla had never before in her whole life occupied such a luxurious apartment, and yet it had a cold, dreary, uninhabited feel. She had an intuition that none of the other students’ rooms looked like hers. She rushed to light the fire, but could not find the matches, which had been removed from their place on the mantel-piece, and felt far too shy to ring the electric bell. It was Priscilla’s fashion to clasp her hands together when she felt a sense of dismay, and she did so now as she looked around the pretty room, which yet with all its luxuries looked to her cold and dreary.  The furniture was excellent of its kind. A Turkey carpet covered the center of the floor, the boards round the edge were stained and brightly polished. In one corner of the room was a little bed, made to look like a sofa by day, with a Liberty cretonne covering. A curtain of the same shut away the wardrobe and washing apparatus. Just under one of the bay windows stood a writing-table, so contrived as to form a writing-table, and a bookcase at the top, and a chest of drawers to hold linen below. Besides this there was a small square table for tea in the room and a couple of chairs. The whole effect was undoubtedly bare.  Priscilla was hesitating whether to begin to unpack her trunk or not when a light knock was heard at her door. She said “Come in,” and two girls burst rather noisily into the apartment.  “How do you do?” they said, favoring the fresh girl with a brief nod. “You came to-day, didn’t you? What are you going to study? Are you clever?”  These queries issued rapidly from the lips of the tallest of the girls. She had red hair, tousled and tossed about her head. Her face was essentially commonplace; her small restless eyes now glanced at Priscilla, now wandered over the room. She did not wait for a reply to any of her queries, but turned rapidly to her companion.  “I told you so, Polly,” she said. “I was quite sure that she was going to be put into Miss Lee’s room. You see, I’m right; this _is_ Annabel Lee’s old room; it has never been occupied since.”  “Hush!” said the other girl.  The two walked across the apartment and seated themselves on Priscilla’s bed.  There came a fresh knock at the door, and this time three students entered. They barely nodded to Priscilla and then rushed across the room with cries of rapture to greet the girls who were seated on the bed.  “How do you do, Miss Atkins? How do you do, Miss Jones?”  Miss Jones and Miss Atkins exchanged kisses with Miss Phillips, Miss Marsh and Miss Day. The babel of tongues rose high, and every one had something to say with regard to the room which had been assigned to Priscilla.  “Look,” said Miss Day, “it was in that corner she had her rocking-chair. Girls, _do_ you remember Annabel’s rocking-chair, and how she used to sway herself backward and forward in it and half-shut her lovely eyes?”  “Oh, and don’t I just seem to _see_ that little red tea-table of hers near the fire,” burst from Miss Marsh. “That Japanese table, with the Japanese tea-set— oh dear, oh dear! those cups of tea— those cakes! Well, the room _was_ luxurious, _was_ worth coming to see in Annabel’s time.”  “It’s more than it is now,” laughed Miss Jones in a harsh voice. “How bare the walls look without her pictures. It was in that recess the large figure of Hope by Burne-Jones used to hang, and there, that queer, wild, wonderful head looking out of clouds. You know she never would tell us the artist’s name. Yes, she had pretty things everywhere! How the room is altered! I don’t think I care for it a bit now.”  “Could any one who knew Annabel Lee care for the room without her?” asked one of the girls. She had a common, not to say vulgar, face, but it wore a wistful expression as she uttered these words.  All this time Priscilla was standing, feeling utterly shy and miserable. From time to time other girls came in; they nodded to her and then rushed upon their companions. The eager talk began afresh, and always there were looks of regret and allusions, accompanied by sighs, to the girl who had lived in the room last.  “Well,” said one merry little girl, who was spoken to by the others as Ada Hardy, “I have no doubt that by and by, when Miss——” She glanced toward Priscilla.  “Peel,” faltered Priscilla.  “When Miss Peel unpacks her trunk, she’ll make the room look very pretty, too.”  “She can’t,” said Miss Day in a tragic voice; “she never could make the room look at it used to— not if she was to live till the age of Methuselah. Of course you’ll improve it, Miss Peel; you couldn’t possibly exist in it as it is now.”  “I can tell you of a capital shop in Kingsdene, Miss Peel,” said Miss Marsh, “where you can buy tables and chairs, and pretty artistic cloths, and little whatnots of all descriptions. I’d advise you to go to Rigg’s. He’s in the High Street, No. 48.”  “But Spilman has much the most _recherche’_ articles, you know, Lucy,” interposed Miss Day. “I’ll walk over to Spilman’s to-morrow with you, if you like, Miss Peel.”  Before Priscilla had time to reply there was again a knock at the door, and this time Nancy Banister, looking flushed and pretty, came in.  She took in the scene at a glance; numbers of girls making themselves at home in Priscilla’s room, some seated on her trunk, some on her bureau, several curled up in comfortable attitudes on her bed and she herself standing, meek, awkward, depressed, near one of the windows.  “How tired you look, Miss Peel!” said Nancy Banister.  Priscilla smiled gratefully at her.  “And your trunk is not unpacked yet?”  “Oh! there is time enough,” faltered Priscilla.  “Are we in your way?” suddenly spoke Miss Marsh, springing to her feet. “Good night. My name is Marsh, my room is thirty-eight.”  She swung herself lazily and carelessly out of the room, followed, at longer or shorter intervals, by the other girls, who all nodded to Priscilla, told her their names and one or two the numbers of their rooms. At last she was left alone with Nancy Banister.  “Poor thing! How tired and white you look!” said Nancy. “But now that dreadful martyrdom is over, you shall have a real cozy time. Don’t you want a nice hot cup of cocoa? It will be ready in a minute or two. And please may I help you to unpack?”  “Thank you,” said Priscilla; her teeth were chattering. “If I might have a fire?” she asked suddenly.  “Oh, you poor, shivering darling! Of course. Are there no matches here? There were some on the mantel-piece before dinner. No, I declare they have vanished. How careless of the maid. I’ll run into Maggie’s room and fetch some.”  Miss Banister was not a minute away. She returned with a box of matches, and, stooping down, set a light to the wood, and a pleasant fire was soon blazing and crackling merrily.  “Now, isn’t that better?” said Nancy. “Please sit down on your bed and give me the key of your trunk. I’ll soon have the things out and put all to rights for you. I’m a splendid unpacker.”  But Priscilla had no desire to have her small and meager wardrobe overhauled even by the kindest of St. Benet’s girls.  “I will unpack presently myself, if you don’t mind,” she said. She felt full of gratitude, but she could not help an almost surly tone coming into her voice.  Nancy drew back, repulsed and distressed.  “Perhaps you would like me to go away?” she said. “I will go into Maggie’s room and let you know when cocoa is ready.”  “Thank you,” said Prissie. Miss Banister disappeared, and Priscilla sat on by the fire, unconscious that she had given any"]]]
