The young man had a room on the second floor, and to this he was speedily taken, and placed in the care of the doctor.  \"No bones broken so far as I can ascertain,\" said Doctor Havens, after a long examination. \"He has cut his forehead, and he also has a bruise behind his left ear, but I think he is suffering more from shock than anything else.\"  \"Did you say you knew him?\" questioned Tom.  \"Oh, no, only that I had seen him around this hotel.\"  \"What is his name?\" asked Sam, of the hotel proprietor, who had followed them to the room.  \"His name is Pelter.\"  \"Pelter!\" The cry came from Tom and Sam simultaneously, and the brothers looked at each other questioningly.  \"Yes, Pelter. Do you know him?\"  \"What is his first name?\" demanded Tom.  \"Why, let me see,\" The hotel man mused for a moment. \"I have it! Barton Pelter.\"  \"I never heard that name before,\" said Tom. \"We know a man in----\" And then, as Sam looked at him in a peculiar way, he added, \"Oh, well, never mind. We don't know this fellow, anyway. I hope he gets over this trouble.\"  By this time the sufferer had again recovered consciousness, but he was evidently very weak, and the doctor motioned for the Rover boys and the hotel man to leave the room.  \"All right, but let us know in the morning by telephone how he is, Doctor,\" returned Tom; and then the Rover boys and the hotel man went below.  \"Can you tell us anything about this Barton Pelter?\" questioned Sam, of the proprietor.  \"I know very little about him, excepting that he is registered as from Brooklyn, and that he came here three days ago. What his business is in Ashton, I haven't the least idea.\"  \"Is he well off--that is, does he appear to have much money?\" asked Tom.  \"Oh, he hasn't shown any great amount of cash around here,\" laughed the hotel man. \"My idea is that he is some sort of a commercial traveler, although he hasn't anything with him but his suitcase.\"  This was all the hotel man could tell them, and a few minutes later the Rover boys were in their automobile once more and headed back for the scene of the accident.  \"We ought to have put up some danger signal, Tom,\" remarked Sam, while on the way.  \"I know it, but we hadn't any time to waste while we had that poor chap on our hands. By the way, do you think he can be any relative of Jesse Pelter, the rascal who knocked me out with the footstool, and who tried his best to rob dad?\"  \"I'm sure I don't know. One thing is certain: The name of Pelter is not common. Still, there may be other Pelters besides those related to that scoundrel of a broker.\"  Arriving at the vicinity of the broken bridge, the boys found a farmer with a wagon there. The countryman was placing some brushwood across the road.  \"The blame bridge is busted down,\" said the farmer, \"and I thought I ought to put up some kind of a thing to warn folks of it.\"  \"That is what we came for,\" answered Sam; and then he and his brother related some of the particulars of what had occurred.  \"Gee, shoo! You don't mean to tell me that one of them automobiles is down in the river!\" gasped the countryman. \"I don't see nothin' of it.\"  \"It most be down on the bottom, close to where that end of the bridge settled,\" answered Sam \"I suppose there will be a job here for somebody to haul it out.\"  \"If they want a man for that, I'm the feller to do it,\" returned the countryman. \"Maybe I had better go down to the hotel and see about it.\"  \"Better wait till morning,\" suggested Tom. \"The young man who owns the machine can't see anyone now.\"  \"All right, just as you say.\"  \"Now that this bridge is down, how can we get over the river?\" mused Sam.  \"Where do you want to go?\"  \"We were on our way to Hope Seminary. I suppose we can go around to the Upper Road, but it will be four or five miles out of our way.\"  \"It ain't necessary to go that far. You go down stream about half a mile on the Craberry Road, and you can cross The Shallows.\"  \"Isn't it too deep for an automobile?\" questioned Tom.  \"No, not now. It might be, though, in wet weather.\"  \"I don't know about that,\" said Sam, and shook his head. \"We don't want any accident in the water, Tom.\"  \"Oh, come ahead, we can try it, anyway,\" returned Tom, who, in spite of the recent happenings, was as anxious as ever to get to the seminary and see Nellie.  Leaving the countryman at his self-appointed task of putting a barrier across the road--and he had said that he would also, get over to the other side of the river somehow and put a barrier there--the Rover boys swung around once again in their touring car, and headed for the side road which had been mentioned to them. Soon they reached what was known as \"The Shallows,\" a spot where the river broadened out, and was filled with loose stones and sandbars.  By the rays from the headlights, which they now turned on to their fullest extent, the car was guided into the water. At the edge, they saw several tracks made, undoubtedly, by wagons, and one track evidently made by the anti-skid tires of an automobile.  \"Well, if one auto got through, we ought to be able to make it,\" remarked Tom, grimly.  \"Better take it on low gear,\" suggested his brother. \"We can't see in this water, and we may go down in a hole before we know it.\"  Slowly and cautiously, Tom guided the machine along, trying to keep as much as possible to the high points of the various sandbars which ran in a diagonal direction to the stream itself. Once or twice they bumped over some rather large stones, and once they went into a hollow which was somewhat deeper than expected, but, with it all, they managed to keep the working parts of the car above the surface of the stream, and inside of five minutes found themselves safe and sound on the opposite shore, and headed for another side road which joined the main highway less than a quarter of a mile beyond.  \"I am mighty glad we are out of that,\" remarked Sam, as they left the rather uneven side road and came out on the smooth highway. \"I must say, I don't like autoing in the water.\"  \"Pooh, that wasn't so bad!\" replied Tom. \"But it would be, I think, after a heavy storm, when the river was swollen. It must be getting late,\" he added. \"Better speed her up a little, or we'll get to Hope just in time to say 'good-night,'\" and he smiled grimly.  Fortunately for the boys, there was very little traveling that night. They met but two wagons and one automobile; and these on straight stretches of the road where there was little danger of collision. Tom was now running at thirty-five to forty miles an hour, and this was rather dangerous where the highway curved, and where what was ahead was partly hidden by, trees and bushes.  \"Here we are at last!\" cried Tom, presently, as they came in sight of Hope Seminary, a fine collection of buildings nestling in a pretty grove of trees. All the dormitory windows showed lights, and there was also a light in the reception parlor of the main building, for which the lads were thankful.  \"Give 'em the horn, Tom,\" suggested Sam.  \"Sure! I was only waiting to get a little closer,\" was the answer, and then, as the automobile turned into the seminary grounds and ran along the road leading up to the main entrance, Tom sounded the horn in a peculiar fashion, a signal which had been arranged between the boys and the girls long before.  \"Tom!\"  \"Sam!\"  The cries came from two girls dressed in white, who had been seated on a rustic bench near a small fountain. Now, as Tom brought the car to a quick stop, the girls hurried forward.  \"Hello, here we are again!\" sang Tom, merrily, and leaping to the ground he caught Nellie Laning by both hands. \"How are you?\"  \"Oh, I am pretty well, Tom.\"  \"And how are you, Grace?\" came from Sam, as he, too, left the automobile.  \"Oh, Sam, I am so glad you have come!\" cried Grace Laning. \"Nellie and I have been waiting for you.\"  \"Well, we are glad we are here. We have had quite an adventure to-night.\"  \"Oh, did you have a breakdown?\" questioned Grace, anxiously.  \"No, but we had to go to the rescue of a fellow who ran into the river.\"  \"Oh, dear! Troubles never seem to come singly,\" sighed Nellie.  \"What do you mean!\" demanded Tom, quickly. \"Is something wrong here?\"  \"Indeed there is, Tom!\" answered Grace. And then, with a look at her older sister, who had turned her face away, she continued: \"I think it is a shame! If it was not that it would make it look as if Nellie were guilty, we would pack up at once and leave this place.\"  \"Why, what do you mean?\" came from both of the Rovers.  \"Oh, Grace, perhaps you had better not tell them,\" cried Nellie, with almost a sob.  \"Nellie!\" And now Tom caught the girl tightly in his arms. \"What has happened?\"  \"I--I--can't tell!\" sobbed the girl. \"Grace will tell you.\"  \"I don't suppose it is necessary to go into all the details,\" said Grace, \"but the long and short of it is, that Nellie is suspected of stealing a four-hundred-dollar diamond ring.\"  \"What!\" ejaculated Tom.  \"It was this way, Tom,\" pursued Grace. \"One of the teachers here, a Miss Harrow, who assists the seminary management by keeping some of the books, had a diamond ring said to be worth four hundred dollars placed in her possession by a Miss Parsons, another teacher. It seems that Miss Parsons had an eccentric old aunt, who wished to give the seminary some money, and so turned over the ring, to be converted into cash. This ring Miss Harrow left on her desk in the office. Nellie went into the office to see the teacher, but finding no one there, came away. Then Miss Harrow came back a few minutes later, and found the diamond ring gone. She at once made inquiries, but as she could find nobody who had been in the once after Nellie had left, she called Nellie in and wanted her to tell what had become of the piece of jewelry.\"    CHAPTER IV   A FOUR-HUNDRED-DOLLAR RING  \"Did you see this ring, Nellie?\" questioned Tom, after a painful pause.  \"Why, yes, it was lying in the middle of "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5002"],["title","The Rover Boys in Business; Or, The Search for the Missing Bonds (#4)"],["body","flat-top desk,\" responded the girl, wiping her eyes with her handkerchief.  \"Didn't somebody go into the office after you were there?\"  \"I don't know, Tom. In fact, nobody seems to know.\"  \"I was in the office with another girl about five minutes before Nellie went there,\" came from Grace. \"I saw the ring there, too, and I thought it was very foolish to leave it so exposed. Why, anybody could have run off with it.\"  \"It certainly was careless,\" put in Sam.  \"Miss Harrow said she was on the point of putting it in the safe when she was called by 'phone to one of the other buildings. She had a dispute to settle between some of the hired help, and she did not think of the ring until some time later. Then, so she says, she rushed back to the office to find it missing.\"  \"Well, I think it is a shame that she accused Nellie,\" said Tom, stoutly and with something of a savage look in his eyes. \"Nellie, if I were you, I wouldn't stand for it.\"  \"She--she hasn't accused me, exactly,\" returned the suffering girl. \"But she intimated that I must have taken the ring, so it's just as bad.\"  \"What does the seminary management have to say about it?\" asked Sam.  \"They seem to think it lies between Nellie and the teacher,\" answered Grace.  \"In that case, how do we know the teacher didn't take the ring herself?\" broke in Tom, quickly.  \"Oh, do you think that possible?\" questioned Nellie, in surprise.  \"It's more reasonable to think she took it than you did. Anyway, she hasn't any right to accuse you,\" went on Tom, bluntly.  \"As I said, Tom, she hasn't accused me--that is, openly; but I know what she thinks, and I know what she will make others think,\" returned Nellie. And now she showed signs of bursting into tears again. \"Oh, I feel as if I must pack up and go home!\"  \"Don't you do it, Nellie. That would make it look as if you were guilty. You stay here and face the music.\" Then, as Nellie began to cry again, Tom took her in his arms and held her tightly.  \"Come on!\" said Sam, in a low tone of voice. \"I think some people at the window are listening.\" And he led the way to a distant portion of the seminary grounds. After that, Grace told all she knew of the miserable affair, and Nellie related just how she had seen the diamond ring on the teacher's desk.  \"Was the window open at the time?\" questioned the older Rover boy.  \"If I remember rightly, the window was tight shut,\" replied Nellie.  \"Yes, it was shut when I was in the office,\" put in Grace. \"I have been trying to think out some way by which the ring could have disappeared, but without success.\"  The matter was talked over for some time, and then the girls questioned the boys regarding the happening at the broken bridge. Nellie, and Grace also, wanted to know the latest news from Dick and Dora.  \"So far as I know, Dora is in fine health and enjoying herself in the city,\" said Tom. \"But Dick is having his hands full, and I rather think that, sooner or later, I'll have to pack up and go to his assistance.\"  \"Then you'll leave Brill for good?\" questioned Nellie.  \"I think so. I can't be breaking in on my college course every now and then as I have been doing, and pass my examinations. More than that, I begin to believe that I was not cut out for a college man. I am like Dick; I prefer a business career rather than a professional one. It is Sam who is going to make the learned one of the family.\"  \"Oh, come now, Tom! Don't pile it on!\" pleaded the younger brother. And yet he looked greatly pleased; and Grace looked pleased, too.  \"But if you leave Brill, you won't be able to get here very often, Tom,\" remarked Nellie, wistfully.  \"That is true. But if I have to go to New York, why can't you go, too?\"  \"Oh, Tom!\"  \"Well, that is what Dora did when Dick gave up his college career. I think the folks understand----\"  Just then a bell in the tower of the main seminary building began to clang loudly. At the first stroke both girls started.  \"There goes the first bell!\" cried Grace. \"We must go.\"  \"Oh, hang the bell!\" muttered Tom, and then, as Grace ran towards the building, with Sam beside her, he once more caught Nellie by the hand.  \"Now say, Nellie, don't you think----\"  \"Oh, Tom, I must get in before the second bell rings!\" pleaded Nellie.  \"Yes, but won't you promise----\"  \"How can I promise anything, Tom, with this affair of the missing ring----\"  \"Missing ring! You don't suppose for one minute that that is going to make any difference to me, do you?\"  \"Oh, no, Tom. I know you too well for that.\" And now Nellie gave him a look that thrilled him through and through. \"But I think I ought to clear my name before--before I do anything else.\"  \"All right. I suppose it has got to be as you say,\" returned Tom, hopelessly. \"But listen! If they make any more trouble for you, promise me that you will let me know.\"  \"All right, Tom, I will.\" And then, after Tom had stolen a quick kiss, Nellie hastened her steps, and a few seconds later she and her sister disappeared within the building.  \"Do you know what I'd like to do, Sam?\" muttered Tom, as the brothers turned away from the seminary grounds in the automobile. \"I'd like to wring that Miss Harrow's neck! What right has she to accuse Nellie?\"  \"No right at all, Tom. But one thing is certain, the ring must be missing. I don't think that the teacher had anything to do with taking it. They don't have that sort here.\"  \"Possibly not. At the same time, to my mind it is far more reasonable to suppose that she took it than that Nellie had anything to do with it,\" declared Tom, stoutly.  \"If the window was closed down, it seems to me that the ring must have been taken by somebody in the building,\" pursued Sam, thoughtfully. \"Perhaps one of the hired help did it.\"  \"Maybe.\" Tom gave a long sigh. \"I certainly hope they clear the matter up before long. I shall be very anxious to hear from the girls about it.\"  As the young collegians had received permission to be out after hours, they did not attempt to take the short cut through The Shallows on returning to Brill. Instead, they went around by another road, over a bridge that was perfectly safe.  \"It's not so late, after all,\" remarked Sam, as they entered their room. \"Perhaps I had better, finish that theme.\"  \"Oh, finish it in the morning,\" returned Tom, with a yawn. \"You'll feel brighter.\"  \"All right,\" answered Sam, who felt sleepy himself; and a few minutes later the brothers retired.  The next morning found Sam at work on the theme long before the hour for breakfast. Tom was also up, and said he would take a walk around the grounds to raise an appetite.  \"As if you needed anything of that sort,\" grinned Sam. \"The first thing you know, you'll be eating so much that the college management will be charging you double for board.\"  Down on the campus, Tom ran into Songbird, and, a few minutes later, William Philander Tubbs. Songbird, as usual, had a pad and pencil in his hand.  \"Composing verses, I suppose,\" remarked Tom. \"What have you got now?\"  \"Oh, it isn't so very much,\" returned Songbird, hesitatingly. \"It's a little poem I was writing about dogs.\"  \"Dogs!\" chimed in William Philander. \"My gracious me! What sort of poetry can you get up about dogs? I must confess, I don't like them. Unless, of course, they are the nice little lap-dog kind.\"  \"This isn't about a lap-dog, exactly,\" returned Songbird. \"It's about a watchdog.\"  \"Um! By the way, Songbird, haven't the Sandersons a new watchdog?\"  \"Yes.\" And now Songbird reddened a little.  \"Well, let us have the poem, anyway. I love dogs, and some poetry about them ought to run along pretty good.\"  Thereupon, rather hesitatingly, Songbird held up his writing-pad and read the following:    \"The sun sinks low far in the west--       The farmer plodeth home to rest,    The watchdog, watching in the night,       Assures him ev'ry thing is right.\"  \"Fine!\" cried Tom. \"Real, dyed-in-the-wool poetry that, Songbird. Give us some more.\" And then the would-be poet continued:     \"The sun comes up and it is morn,       The farmer goes to plow his corn,    The watchdog, watching through the day,       Keeps ev'ry tramp and thief away.\"     And be it night or be it day----\"    \"The watchdog's there, and there to stay!\"  continued Tom, and then on:    \"The watchdog, watching in his sleep,       Catches each flea and makes him weep!\"  \"Catching fleas indeed!\" interrupted Songbird. \"Now, Tom, I didn't have any fleas in this poem.\"  \"But all dogs have fleas, Songbird--they own them naturally. You wouldn't deprive a poor, innocent dog of his inheritance, would you?\"  \"But, Tom, see here----\"  \"But I wanted to say the poem couldn't be better,\" went on the fun-loving Rover. \"Why don't you send it to some of the dog journals? They would be sure to print it.\"  \"Dog journals?\" snorted the would-be poet. \"Do you think I write for such a class of publications as that?\"  \"Well, you might do worse,\" responded Tom, coolly. \"Now, for a first-class journal, they ought to pay you at least a dollar a foot.\"  \"Oh, Tom, you are the worst ever!\" murmured Songbird, as he turned away. A few minutes later, Tom saw him sit down on a bench to compose verses as industriously as ever.  \"I think I must be going,\" said William Philander, who had listened to Songbird's effort without making any comment.  \"Wait a minute, my dear Billy, I want----\"  \"Now, Tom, please don't call me Billy,\" pleaded the dudish student.  \"Oh, all right, Philly. I was just going to say----\"  \"Now, Tom, Philly is just as bad as Billy, if not worse. You know my name well enough.\"  \"All right, Tubblets. If you prefer any such handle to the tub, why I----\"  \"Tom, if you are going to talk that way, I'll really have to leave you, don't you know,\" cried William Philander. \"I am not going to stand for it any longer. I have told you at least a hundred times----\"  \"No, not a hundred times, not more than sixty-eight times at the most,\" interrupted Tom.  \"Well, I've told you enough times, anyway, Tom. So if you----\"  \"Don't "]]]
