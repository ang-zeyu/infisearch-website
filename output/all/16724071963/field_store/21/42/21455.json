Jeremiah Smith was allowed to go along as an observer, and Dexter was accorded a similar favor. By evening, everything was in place. The colonel's Cadillac, parked in the valley's center, had something of the aspect of a chrome-bedizened lamb resting on an altar of crab grass, buttercups and mustard weeds. Surrounding it were half a dozen floodlights, suspended over it was a microphone, standing next to it was a pole supporting three P.A. speakers, and located several hundred feet away was a TV camera. Beyond this impressive  display, Old Man Tillson's homestead could be discerned, and beyond the homestead rose his mountainous collection of beer bottles.  Colonel Mortby came out of the command-post tent and walked over to where Dexter and Jeremiah were standing, looking down into the valley. He handed each of them a pair of cobalt-blue glasses. \"If you watch the blast, make sure you wear these,\" he said, raising his voice above the amplified purring of the Cadillac's motor. \"You'll be glad to hear that the two VEMs are already on their way, Mr. Foote--our walkie-talkie squad just called in. However, the creatures move so slowly that they probably won't be here before dawn.\"  Dexter came out of a brown study. \"One thing still bugs me,\" he said. \"Why should two members of a race of extraterrestrials technically intelligent enough to build spaceships behave like a pair of gluttonous savages the minute they land on another planet?\"  \"But you explained that,\" Jeremiah pointed out. \"They just can't resist eating American automobiles.\"  \"I'm afraid I got carried away by my analogy. Civilized beings simply don't go running across the countryside the minute they land, and start grabbing up everything that strikes their eye. They make contact with the authorities first, and _then_ they go running across the countryside and start grabbing up everything that strikes their eye.\"  Colonel Mortby grinned. \"You've got a good point there, Mr. Foote. Well, I'm going to see if I can't grab forty winks or so--it's been a trying day.\"  \"Me too,\" Jeremiah said, heading for his model A.  Left alone, Dexter wedged a flashlight in the fork of a little tree, sat down in its dim radiance, got out pen and notebook, and began his article. _The Solid Cheese Cadillac_, he wrote, _by Dexter Foote_....  Dawn found him dozing over page 16. \"There they are!\" someone shouted, jerking him awake. \"The filthy fiends!\"  The \"someone\" was General Longcombe. Joining him, Dexter saw the two VEMs. They were moving relentlessly across the valley floor toward the helpless Cadillac. Jeremiah came up, rubbing his eyes. Colonel Mortby could be discerned through the entrance of the command-post tent, leaning over a technician's shoulder.  The two VEMs reached the Cadillac and began licking off the chrome with their long, tong-like tongues. General Longcombe went wild. He waved his arms. \"Monsters!\" he screamed, \"I'll blow you to Kingdom Come personally!\" and stomped into the tent.  Dexter and Jeremiah started to put on their cobalt-blue glasses. Abruptly thunder sounded, and a shadow darkened the land. Looking skyward, Dexter saw it--  The ship. The saucer. Whichever word you cared to apply to it. But whichever noun you chose, you had to prefix it with the adjective \"gigantic,\" for the ventral hatch alone, which had just yawned open, was large enough to accommodate the Sugardale Methodist Church.  In the command-post tent, the general, as yet unaware of the UFO's presence, was giving the countdown in an anguished voice. \"Two--\"  In the valley, the two VEMs were trying vainly to extricate themselves from a huge metallic net that had dropped over them.  \"One--\"  On the lip of the valley, Dexter Foote was grappling with an insight.  \"Zero--\"  Pfft!...         *       *       *       *       *  \"It wasn't a dud after all,\" General Longcombe said. \"They cancelled out the chain-reaction with some kind of a ray. I wonder....\" He shook his head wistfully. \"What a weapon, though.\"  He and Colonel Mortby and the tech were standing by the chrome-stripped carcass of the Cadillac. Dexter and Jeremiah had just come up. \"My theory turned out to be a little bit off-center,\" Dexter said. \"You see, I overlooked the possibility that our children aren't necessarily the only galactic small fry who run away from home and get themselves in Dutch. My birthday-cake analogy still holds true, but I would have done better to have compared our late-model automobiles to appetizing candy bars, or Easter baskets filled with jelly beans and chocolate chickens.\"  The general regarded him blankly. \"I'm afraid I don't follow you at all, Mr. Foote.\"  \"Did you ever turn a pair of hungry kids loose in a candy store, sir?\"  Understanding came into General Longcombe's eyes then, and he turned and gazed sadly at his chromeless Cadillac. \"I wonder if they have castor oil on Planet X,\" he said.  \"I bet they have its equivalent,\" grinned Dexter Foote."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50928"],["title","Hot Planet (#0)"],["body","PLANET                              By HAL CLEMENT                           Illustrated by FINLAY             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                      Galaxy Magazine August 1963.

Why was it developing one now?   I  The wind which had nearly turned the _Albireo's_ landing into a disaster instead of a mathematical exercise was still playing tunes about the fins and landing legs as Schlossberg made his way down to Deck Five.  The noise didn't bother him particularly, though the endless seismic tremors made him dislike the ladders. But just now he was able to ignore both. He was curious--though not hopeful.  \"Is there anything at all obvious on the last sets of tapes, Joe?\"  Mardikian, the geophysicist, shrugged. \"Just what you'd expect ... on a planet which has at least one quake in each fifty-mile-square area every five minutes. You know yourself we had a nice seismic program set up, but when we touched down we found we couldn't carry it out. We've done our best with the natural tremors--incidentally stealing most of the record tapes the other projects would have used. We have a lot of nice information for the computers back home; but it will take all of them to make any sense out of it.\"  Schlossberg nodded; the words had not been necessary. His astronomical program had been one of those sabotaged by the transfer of tapes to the seismic survey.  \"I just hoped,\" he said. \"We each have an idea why Mercury developed an atmosphere during the last few decades, but I guess the high school kids on Earth will know whether it's right before we do. I'm resigned to living in a chess-type universe--few and simple rules, but infinite combinations of them. But it would be nice to know an answer sometime.\"  \"So it would. As a matter of fact, I need to know a couple right now. From you. How close to finished are the other programs--or what's left of them?\"  \"I'm all set,\" replied Schlossberg. \"I have a couple of instruments still monitoring the sun just in case, but everything in the revised program is on tape.\"  \"Good. Tom, any use asking you?\"  The biologist grimaced. \"I've been shown two hundred and sixteen different samples of rock and dust. I have examined in detail twelve crystal growths which looked vaguely like vegetation. Nothing was alive or contained living things by any standards I could conscientiously set.\"  Mardikian's gesture might have meant sympathy.  \"Camille?\"  \"I may as well stop now as any time. I'll never be through. Tape didn't make much difference to me, but I wish I knew what weight of specimens I could take home.\"  \"Eileen?\" Mardikian's glance at the stratigrapher took the place of the actual question.  \"Cam speaks for me, except that I could have used any more tape you could have spared. What I have is gone.\"  \"All right, that leaves me, the tape-thief. The last spools are in the seismographs now, and will start running out in seventeen hours. The tractors will start out on their last rounds in sixteen, and should be back in roughly a week. Will, does that give you enough to figure the weights we rockhounds can have on the return trip?\"         *       *       *       *       *  The _Albireo's_ captain nodded. \"Close enough. There really hasn't been much question since it became evident we'd find nothing for the mass tanks here. I'll have a really precise check in an hour, but I can tell right now that you have about one and a half metric tons to split up among the three of you.  \"Ideal departure time is three hundred ten hours away, as you all know. We can stay here until then, or go into a parking-and-survey orbit at almost any time before then. You have all the survey you need, I should think, from the other time. But suit yourselves.\"  \"I'd just as soon be space-sick as seasick,\" remarked Camille Burkett. \"I still hate to think that the entire planet is as shivery as the spot we picked.\"  Willard Rowson smiled. \"You researchers told me where to land after ten days in orbit mapping this rockball. I set you just where you asked. If you'd found even five tons of juice we could use in the reaction tanks I could still take you to another one--if you could agree which one. I hate to say 'Don't blame me,' but I can't think of anything else that fits.\"  \"So we sit until the last of the tractors is back with the precious seismo tapes, playing battleship while our back teeth are being shaken out by earthquakes--excuse the word. What a thrill! Glorious adventure!\" Zaino, the communications specialist who had been out of a job almost constantly since the landing, spoke sourly. The captain was the only one who saw fit to answer.  \"If you want adventure, you made a mistake exploring space. The only space adventures I've heard of are second-hand stories built on guesswork; the people who really had them weren't around to tell about it. Unless Dr. Marini discovers a set of Mercurian monsters at the last minute and they invade the ship or cut off one of the tractors, I'm afraid you'll have to do without adventures.\" Zaino grimaced.  \"That sounds funny coming from a spaceman, Captain. I didn't really mean adventure, though; all I want is something to do besides betting whether the next quake will come in one minute or five. I haven't even had to fix a suit-radio since we touched down. How about my going out with one of the tractors on this last trip, at least?\"  \"It's all right with me,\" replied Rowson, \"but Dr. Mardikian runs the professional part of this operation. I require that Spurr, Trackman, Hargedon and Aiello go as drivers, since without them even a minor mechanical problem would be more than an adventure. As I recall it, Dr. Harmon, Dr. Schlossberg, Dr. Marini and Dr. Mardikian are scheduled to go; but if any one of them is willing to let you take his or her place, I certainly don't mind.\"  The radioman looked around hopefully. The geologists and the biologist shook their heads negatively, firmly and unanimously; but the astronomer pondered for a moment. Zaino watched tensely.  \"It may be all right,\" Schlossberg said at last. \"What I want to get is a set of wind, gas pressure, gas temperature and gas composition measures around the route. I didn't expect to be more meteorologist than astronomer when we left Earth, and didn't have exactly the right equipment. Hargedon and Aiello helped me improvise some, and this is the first chance to use it on Darkside. If you can learn what has to be done with it before starting time, though, you are welcome to my place.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The communicator got to his feet fast enough to leave the deck in Mercury's feeble gravity.  \"Lead me to it, Doc. I guess I can learn to read a home-made weathervane!\"  \"Is that merely bragging, or a challenge?\" drawled a voice which had not previously joined the discussion. Zaino flushed a bit.  \"Sorry, Luigi,\" he said hastily. \"I didn't mean it just that way. But I still think I can run the stuff.\"  \"Likely enough,\" Aiello replied. \"Remember though, it wasn't made just for talking into.\" Schlossberg, now on his feet, cut in quickly.  \"Come on, Arnie. We'll have to suit up to see the equipment; it's outside.\"  He shepherded the radioman to the hatch at one side of the deck and shooed him down toward the engine and air lock levels. Both were silent for some moments; but safely out of earshot of Deck Five the younger man looked up and spoke.  \"You needn't push, Doc. I wasn't going to make anything of it. Luigi was right, and I asked for it.\" The astronomer slowed a bit in his descent.  \"I wasn't really worried,\" he replied, \"but we have several months yet before we can get away from each other, and I don't like talk that could set up grudges. Matter of fact, I'm even a little uneasy about having the girls along, though I'm no misogynist.\"  \"Girls? They're not--\"  \"There goes your foot again. Even Harmon is about ten years older than you, I suppose. But they're girls to me. What's more important, they no doubt think of themselves as girls.\"  \"Even Dr. Burkett? That is--I mean--\"  \"Even Dr. Burkett. Here, get into your suit. And maybe you'd better take out the mike. It'll be enough if you can listen for the next hour or two.\" Zaino made no answer, suspecting with some justice that anything he said would be wrong.  Each made final checks on the other's suit; then they descended one more level to the airlock. This occupied part of the same deck as the fusion plants, below the wings and reaction mass tanks but above the main engine. Its outer door was just barely big enough to admit a spacesuited person. Even with the low air pressure carried by spaceships, a large door area meant large total force on jamb, hinges and locks. It opened onto a small balcony from which a ladder led to the ground. The two men paused on the balcony to look over the landscape.  This hadn't changed noticeably since the last time either had been out, though there might have been some small difference in the volcanic cones a couple of miles away to the northeast. The furrows down the sides of these, which looked as though they had been cut by water but were actually bone-dry ash slides, were always undergoing alteration as gas from below kept blowing fresh scoria fragments out of the craters.         *       *       *       *       *  The spines--steep, jagged fragments of rock which thrust upward from the plain beyond and to both sides of the cones--seemed dead as ever.  The level surface between the _Albireo_ and the cones was more interesting. Mardikian and Schlossberg believed it to be a lava sheet dating from early in Mercury's history, when more volatile substances still existed in the surface rocks to cut down their viscosity when molten. They supposed that much--perhaps most--of the surface"]]]
