The region had not been desert when the vaults were constructed. The War had left its mark of devastation here, Rik saw, looking in vain for a trace of the magnificent towered city that had once been just beyond this spot.  He shook off his dismay and set himself to the task for which he'd emerged.  The animals had to be alive, yet, or they were doomed. He'd always regretted the haste in their preparations that had precluded preparing survival vaults for the food animals. The best they'd been able to do, before the Day of Devastation, was herd the stupid beasts into caves and pile the entrances with loose rock, hoping the animals would dig themselves out only after the worst fury of the War had passed.... Rik threw off the bitter memory, abruptly, as his ears detected a tiny buzz of sound.  He dropped to the ground and lay still, watching to see what sort of beast would appear. It sounded larger than the animals he remembered. \"I must be near a waterhole,\" he reasoned. \"There's a pathway here, made by many animals passing this way....\" he mused, studying the narrow, flattened track that he'd spotted in the night-chilled sand.  Then he saw something coming slowly up the trail, a thing much larger than the animals he remembered.  It was a long moment before he realized what it was, and smiled. Then he reached out his hands and had it. It buzzed loudly in his grip until he pounded it to silence on a rock. By the time he'd returned to the pump chamber, he'd managed to prise it open, but its contents--mangled by the smashing upon the rock--were barely fit to eat.  \"It's better than I could have hoped,\" he said to Zina, when they and the others had picked the thing clean. \"Life promises to be much more exciting, infinitely more sporting in this new age outside the vaults. With care, we can survive until our engineers rig up some whip-rays and herding-claws again.\"  \"It _will_ be fun,\" Zina agreed, smiling with grim anticipation. \"I enjoy a challenge in the hunt. Who'd have thought the animals would have come so _far_ from the caves!\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was hours later that the bus company grew worried about their missing vehicle, and started an investigation. But they could find no trace of the bus, anywhere, and it remained a mystery until the day everybody suddenly knew what had happened.

May's man Reuben, of the eighty-third level, Atomist, knew there was something wrong when the binoculars flashed and then went opaque. Inwardly he cursed, hoping that he had not committed himself to anything. Outwardly he was unperturbed. He handed the binoculars back to Rudolph's man Almon, of the eighty-ninth level, Maintainer, with a smile.  \"They aren't very good,\" he said.  Almon put them to his own eyes, glanced over the parapet and swore mildly. \"Blacker than the heart of a crazy Angel, eh? Never mind; here's another pair.\"  This pair was unremarkable. Through it, Reuben studied the thousand setbacks and penthouses, of Denv that ranged themselves below. He was too worried to enjoy his first sight of the vista from the eighty-ninth level, but he let out a murmur of appreciation. Now to get away from this suddenly sinister fellow and try to puzzle it out.  \"Could we--?\" he asked cryptically, with a little upward jerk of his chin.  \"It's better not to,\" Almon said hastily, taking the glasses from his hands. \"What if somebody with stars happened to see, you know? How'd _you_ like it if you saw some impudent fellow peering up at you?\"  \"He wouldn't dare!\" said Reuben, pretending to be stupid and indignant, and joined a moment later in Almon's sympathetic laughter.  \"Never mind,\" said Almon. \"We are young. Some day, who knows? Perhaps we shall look from the ninety-fifth level, or the hundredth.\"  Though Reuben knew that the Maintainer was no friend of his, the generous words sent blood hammering through his veins; ambition for a moment.  He pulled a long face and told Almon: \"Let us hope so. Thank you for being my host. Now I must return to my quarters.\"  He left the windy parapet for the serene luxury of an eighty-ninth-level corridor and descended slow moving stairs through gradually less luxurious levels to his own Spartan floor. Selene was waiting, smiling, as he stepped off the stairs.  She was decked out nicely--too nicely. She wore a steely hued corselet and a touch of scent; her hair was dressed long. The combination appealed to him, and instantly he was on his guard. Why had she gone to the trouble of learning his tastes? What was she up to? After all, she was Griffin's woman.  \"Coming _down_?\" she asked, awed. \"Where have you been?\"  \"The eighty-ninth, as a guest of that fellow Almon. The vista is immense.\"  \"I've never been....\" she murmured, and then said decisively: \"You belong up there. And higher. Griffin laughs at me, but he's a fool. Last night in chamber we got to talking about you, I don't know how, and he finally became quite angry and said he didn't want to hear another word.\" She smiled wickedly. \"I was revenged, though.\"  Blank-faced, he said: \"You must be a good hand at revenge, Selene, and at stirring up the need for it.\"  The slight hardening of her smile meant that he had scored and he hurried by with a rather formal salutation.  Burn him for an Angelo, but she was easy enough to take! The contrast of the metallic garment with her soft, white skin was disturbing, and her long hair suggested things. It was hard to think of her as scheming something or other; scheming Selene was displaced in his mind by Selene in chamber.  But what was she up to? Had she perhaps heard that he was to be elevated? Was Griffin going to be swooped on by the Maintainers? Was he to kill off Griffin so she could leech onto some rising third party? Was she perhaps merely giving her man a touch of the lash?  He wished gloomily that the binoculars-problem and the Selene-problem had not come together. That trickster Almon had spoken of youth as though it were something for congratulation; he hated being young and stupid and unable to puzzle out the faulty binoculars and the warmth of Griffin's woman.         *       *       *       *       *  The attack alarm roared through the Spartan corridor. He ducked through the nearest door into a vacant bedroom and under the heavy steel table. Somebody else floundered under the table a moment later, and a third person tried to join them.  The firstcomer roared: \"Get out and find your own shelter! I don't propose to be crowded out by you or to crowd you out either and see your ugly blood and brains if there's a hit. Go, now!\"  \"Forgive me, sir! At once, sir!\" the latecomer wailed; and scrambled away as the alarm continued to roar.  Reuben gasped at the \"sirs\" and looked at his neighbor. It was May! Trapped, no doubt, on an inspection tour of the level.  \"Sir,\" he said respectfully, \"if you wish to be alone, I can find another room.\"  \"You may stay with me for company. Are you one of mine?\" There was power in the general's voice and on his craggy face.  \"Yes, sir. May's man Reuben, of the eighty-third level, Atomist.\"  May surveyed him, and Reuben noted that there were pouches of skin depending from cheekbones and the jaw line--dead-looking, coarse-pored skin.  \"You're a well-made boy, Reuben. Do you have women?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Reuben hastily. \"One after another--I _always_ have women. I'm making up at this time to a charming thing called Selene. Well-rounded, yet firm, soft but supple, with long red hair and long white legs--\"  \"Spare me the details,\" muttered the general. \"It takes all kinds. An Atomist, you said. That has a future, to be sure. I myself was a Controller long ago. The calling seems to have gone out of fashion--\"  Abruptly the alarm stopped. The silence was hard to bear.  May swallowed and went on: \"--for some reason or other. Why don't youngsters elect for Controller any more? Why didn't you, for instance?\"  Reuben wished he could be saved by a direct hit. The binoculars, Selene, the raid, and now he was supposed to make intelligent conversation with a general.  \"I really don't know, sir,\" he said miserably. \"At the time there seemed to be very little difference--Controller, Atomist, Missiler, Maintainer. We have a saying, 'The buttons are different,' which usually ends any conversation on the subject.\"  \"Indeed?\" asked May distractedly. His face was thinly filmed with sweat. \"Do you suppose Ellay intends to clobber us this time?\" he asked almost hoarsely. \"It's been some weeks since they made a maximum effort, hasn't it?\"  \"Four,\" said Reuben. \"I remember because one of my best Servers was killed by a falling corridor roof--the only fatality and it had to happen to my team!\"  He laughed nervously and realized that he was talking like a fool, but May seemed not to notice.  Far below them, there was a series of screaming whistles as the interceptors were loosed to begin their intricate, double basketwork wall of defense in a towering cylinder about Denv.  \"Go on, Reuben,\" said May. \"That was most interesting.\" His eyes were searching the underside of the steel table.  Reuben averted his own eyes from the frightened face, feeling some awe drain out of him. Under a table with a general! It didn't seem so strange now.  \"Perhaps, sir, you can tell me what a puzzling thing, that happened this afternoon, means. A fellow--Rudolph's man Almon, of the eighty-ninth level--gave me a pair of binoculars that flashed in my eyes and then went opaque. Has your wide experience--\"  May laughed hoarsely and said in a shaky voice: \"That old trick! He was photographing your retinas for the blood-vessel pattern. One of Rudolph's men, eh? I'm glad you spoke to me; I'm old enough to spot a revival like that. Perhaps my good friend Rudolph plans--\"  There was a thudding volley in the air and then a faint jar. One had got through, exploding, from the feel of it, far down at the foot of Denv.  The alarm roared again, in bursts that meant all clear; only one flight of missiles and that disposed of.         *       *       *       *       *  The Atomist and the general climbed out from under the table; May's secretary popped through the door. The general waved him out again and leaned heavily on the table, his arms quivering. Reuben hastily brought a chair.  \"A glass of water,\" said May.  The Atomist brought it. He saw the general wash down what looked like a triple dose of XXX--green capsules which it was better to leave alone.  May said after a moment: \"That's better. And don't look so shocked, youngster; you don't know the strain we're under. It's only a temporary measure which I shall discontinue as soon as things ease up a bit. I was saying that perhaps my good friend Rudolph plans to substitute one of his men for one of mine. Tell me, how long has this fellow Almon been a friend of yours?\"  \"He struck up an acquaintance with me only last week. I should have realized--\"  \"You certainly should have. One week. Time enough and more. By now you've been photographed, your fingerprints taken, your voice recorded and your gait studied without your knowledge. Only the retinascope is difficult, but one must risk it for a real double. Have you killed your man, Reuben?\"  He nodded; It had been a silly brawl two years ago over precedence at the refectory; he disliked being reminded of it.  \"Good,\" said May grimly. \"The way these things are done, your double kills you in a secluded spot, disposes of your body and takes over your role. We shall reverse it. You will kill the double and take over _his_ role.\"  The powerful, methodical voice ticked off possibilities and contingencies, measures, and countermeasures. Reuben absorbed them and felt his awe return. Perhaps May had not really been frightened under the table; perhaps it had been he reading his own terror in the general's face. May was actually talking to him of"]]]
