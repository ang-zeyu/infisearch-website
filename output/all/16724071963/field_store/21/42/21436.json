Bruce heard their feet on the gravel outside and got up reluctantly to open the door for them. He'd been reading some of Byron's poems he'd sneaked aboard the ship; after that he had been on the point of dozing off, and now one of those strangely realistic dreams would have to be postponed for a while. Funny, those dreams. There were faces in them of human beings, or of ghosts, and other forms that weren't human at all, but seemed real and alive--except that they were also just parts of a last unconscious desire to escape death. Maybe that was it.  \"'Oh that my young life were a lasting dream, my spirit not awakening till the beam of an eternity should bring the 'morrow,\" Bruce said. He smiled without feeling much of anything and added, \"Thanks, Mr. Poe.\"  Jacobs and Anhauser stood outside. The icy wind cut through and into Bruce, but he didn't seem to notice. Anhauser's bulk loomed even larger in the special cold-resisting suiting. Jacobs' thin face frowned slyly at Bruce.  \"Come on in, boys, and get warm,\" Bruce invited.  \"Hey, poet, you're still here!\" Anhauser said, looking astonished.  \"We thought you'd be running off somewhere,\" Jacobs said.  Bruce reached for the suit on its hook, started climbing into it. \"Where?\" he asked. \"Mars looks alike wherever you go. Where did you think I'd be running to?\"  \"Any place just so it was away from here and us,\" Anhauser said.  \"I don't have to do that. You are going away from me. That takes care of that, doesn't it?\"  \"Ah, come on, get the hell out of there,\" Jacobs said. He pulled the revolver from its holster and pointed it at Bruce. \"We got to get some sleep. We're starting up that mountain at five in the morning.\"  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"I'll be glad to see you climb the mountain.\"  Outside, in the weird light of the double moons, Bruce looked up at the gigantic overhang of the mountain. It was unbelievable. The mountain didn't seem to belong here. He'd thought so when they'd first hit Mars eight months back and discovered the other four rockets that had never got back to Earth--all lying side by side under the mountain's shadow, like little white chalk marks on a tallyboard.  They'd estimated its height at over 45,000 feet, which was a lot higher than any mountain on Earth. Yet Mars was much older, geologically. The entire face of the planet was smoothed into soft, undulating red hills by erosion. And there in the middle of barren nothingness rose that one incredible mountain. On certain nights when the stars were right, it had seemed to Bruce as though it were pointing an accusing finger at Earth--or a warning one.         *       *       *       *       *  With Jacobs and Anhauser and the remainder of the crew of the ship, _Mars V_, seven judges sat in a semi-circle and Bruce stood there in front of them for the inquest.  In the middle of the half-moon of inquisition, with his long legs stretched out and his hands folded on his belly, sat Captain Terrence. His uniform was black. On his arm was the silver fist insignia of the Conqueror Corps. Marsha Rennels sat on the extreme right and now there was no emotion at all on her trim, neat face.  He remembered her as she had been years ago, but at the moment he wasn't looking very hard to see anything on her face. It was too late. They had gotten her young and it was too late.  Terrence's big, square face frowned a little. Bruce was aware suddenly of the sound of the bleak, never-ending wind against the plastilene shelter. He remembered the strange misty shapes that had come to him in his dreams, the voices that had called to him, and how disappointed he had been when he woke from them.  \"This is a mere formality,\" Terrence finally said, \"since we all know you killed Lieutenant Doran a few hours ago. Marsha saw you kill him. Whatever you say goes on the record, of course.\"  \"For whom?\" Bruce asked.  \"What kind of question is that? For the authorities on Earth when we get back.\"  \"When you get back? Like the crews of those other four ships out there?\" Bruce laughed without much humor.  Terrence rubbed a palm across his lips, dropped the hand quickly again to his belly. \"You want to make a statement or not? You shot Doran in the head with a rifle. No provocation for the attack. You've wasted enough of my time with your damn arguments and anti-social behavior. This is a democratic group. Everyone has his say. But you've said too much, and done too much. Freedom doesn't allow you to go around killing fellow crew-members!\"  \"Any idea that there was any democracy or freedom left died on Venus,\" Bruce said.  \"Now we get another lecture!\" Terrence exploded. He leaned forward. \"You're sick, Bruce. They did a bad psych job on you. They should never have sent you on this trip. We need strength, all the strength we can find. You don't belong here.\"  \"I know,\" Bruce agreed indifferently. \"I was drafted for this trip. I told them I shouldn't be brought along. I said I didn't want any part of it.\"  \"Because you're afraid. You're not Conqueror material. That's why you backed down when we all voted to climb the mountain. And what the devil does Venus--?\"  Max Drexel's freckles slipped into the creases across his high forehead. \"Haven't you heard him expounding on the injustice done to the Venusian aborigines, Captain? If you haven't, you aren't thoroughly educated to the crackpot idealism still infecting certain people.\"  \"I haven't heard it,\" Terrence admitted. \"What injustice?\"  Bruce said, \"I guess it couldn't really be considered an injustice any longer. Values have changed too much. Doran and I were part of the crew of that first ship to hit Venus, five years ago. Remember? One of the New Era's more infamous dates. Drexel says the Venusians were aborigines. No one ever got a chance to find out. We ran into this village. No one knows how old it was. There were intelligent beings there. One community left on the whole planet, maybe a few thousand inhabitants. They made their last mistake when they came out to greet us. Without even an attempt at communication, they were wiped out. The village was burned and everything alive in it was destroyed.\"  Bruce felt the old weakness coming into his knees, the sweat beginning to run down his face. He took a deep breath and stood there before the cold nihilistic stares of fourteen eyes.  \"No,\" Bruce said. \"I apologize. None of you know what I'm talking about.\"  Terrence nodded. \"You're psycho. It's as simple as that. They pick the most capable for these conquests. Even the flights are processes of elimination. Eventually we get the very best, the most resilient, the real conquering blood. You just don't pass, Bruce. Listen, what do you think gives you the right to stand here in judgment against the laws of the whole Solar System?\"  \"There are plenty on Earth who agree with me,\" Bruce said. \"I can say what I think now because you can't do more than kill me and you'll do that regardless....\"  He stopped. This was ridiculous, a waste of his time. And theirs. They had established a kind of final totalitarianism since the New Era. The psychologists, the Pavlovian Reflex boys, had done that. If you didn't want to be reconditioned to fit into the social machine like a human vacuum tube, you kept your mouth shut. And for many, when the mouth was kept shut long enough, the mind pretty well forgot what it had wanted to open the mouth for in the first place.  A minority in both segments of a world split into two factions. Both had been warring diplomatically and sometimes physically, for centuries, clung to old ideas of freedom, democracy, self-determinism, individualism. To most, the words had no meaning now. It was a question of which set of conquering heroes could conquer the most space first. So far, only Venus had fallen. They had done a good, thorough job there. Four ships had come to Mars and their crews had disappeared. This was the fifth attempt--         *       *       *       *       *  Terrence said, \"why did you shoot Doran?\"  \"I didn't like him enough to take the nonsense he was handing me, and when he shot the--\" Bruce hesitated.  \"What? When he shot what?\"  Bruce felt an odd tingling in his stomach. The wind's voice seemed to sharpen and rise to a kind of wail.  \"All right, I'll tell you. I was sleeping, having a dream. Doran woke me up. Marsha was with him. I'd forgotten about that geological job we were supposed to be working on. I've had these dreams ever since we got here.\"  \"What kind of dreams?\"  Someone laughed.  \"Just fantastic stuff. Ask your Pavlovian there,\" Bruce said. \"People talk to me, and there are other things in the dreams. Voices and some kind of shapes that aren't what you would call human at all.\"  Someone coughed. There was obvious embarrassment in the room.  \"It's peculiar, but many faces and voices are those of crew members of some of the ships out there, the ones that never got back to Earth.\"  Terrence grinned. \"Ghosts, Bruce?\"  \"Maybe. This planet may not be a dead ball of clay. I've had a feeling there's something real in the dreams, but I can't figure it out. You're still interested?\"  Terrence nodded and glanced to either side.  \"We've seen no indication of any kind of life whatsoever,\" Bruce pointed out. \"Not even an insect, or any kind of plant life except some fungi and lichen down in the crevices. That never seemed logical to me from the start. We've covered the planet everywhere except one place--\"  \"The mountain,\" Terrence said. \"You've been afraid even to talk about scaling it."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50868"],["title","The Highest Mountain (#1)"],["body","\"  \"Not afraid,\" Bruce objected. \"I don't see any need to climb it. Coming to Mars, conquering space, isn't that enough? It happens that the crew of the first ship here decided to climb the mountain, and that set a precedent. Every ship that has come here has had to climb it. Why? Because they had to accept the challenge. And what's happened to them? Like you, they all had the necessary equipment to make a successful climb, but no one's ever come back down. No contact with anything up there.  \"Captain, I'm not accepting a ridiculous challenge like that. Why should I? I didn't come here to conquer anything, even a mountain. The challenge of coming to Mars, of going on to where ever you guys intend going before something bigger than you are stops you--it doesn't interest me.\"  \"Nothing's bigger than the destiny of Earth!\" Terrence said, sitting up straight and rigid.  \"I know,\" Bruce said. \"Anyway, I got off the track. As I was saying, I woke up from this dream and Marsha and Doran were there. Doran was shaking me. But I didn't seem to have gotten entirely awake; either that or some part of the dream was real, because I looked out the window--something was out there, looking at me. It was late, and at first I thought it might be a shadow. But it wasn't. It was misty, almost translucent, but I think it was something alive. I had a feeling it was intelligent, maybe very intelligent. I could feel something in my mind. A kind of beauty and softness and warmth. I kept looking--\"  His throat was getting tight. He had difficulty talking. \"Doran asked me what I was looking at, and I told him. He laughed. But he looked. Then I realized that maybe I wasn't still dreaming. Doran saw it, too, or thought he did. He kept looking and finally he jumped and grabbed up his rifle and ran outside. I yelled at him. I kept on yelling and ran after him. 'It's intelligent, whatever it is!' I kept saying. 'How do you know it means any harm?' But I heard Doran's rifle go off before I could get to him. And whatever it was we saw, I didn't see it any more. Neither did Doran. Maybe he killed it. I don't know. He had to kill it. That's the way you think.\"  \"What? Explain that remark.\"  \"That's the philosophy of conquest--don't take any chances with aliens. They might hinder our advance across the Universe. So we kill everything. Doran acted without thinking at all. Conditioned to kill everything that doesn't look like us. So I hit Doran and took the gun away from him and killed him. I felt sick, crazy with rage. Maybe that's part of it. All I know is that I thought he deserved to die and that I had to kill him, so I did.\"  \"Is that all, Bruce?\"  \"That's about all. Except that I'd like to kill all of you. And I would if I had the chance.\"  \"That's what I figured.\" Terrence turned to the psychologist, a small wiry man who sat there constantly fingering his ear. \"Stromberg, what do you think of this gobbledegook? We know he's crazy. But what hit him? You said his record was good up until a year ago.\"  Stromberg's voice was monotonous, like a voice off of a tape. \"Schizophrenia with mingled delusions of persecution. The schizophrenia is caused by inner conflict--indecision between the older values and our present ones which he hasn't been able to accept. A complete case history would tell why he can't accept our present attitudes. I would say that he has an incipient fear of personal inadequacy, which is why he fears our desire for conquest. He's rationalized, built up a defense which he's structured with his idealism, foundationed with Old Era values. Retreat into the past, an escape from his own present feelings of inadequacy. Also, he escapes into these dream fantasies.\"  \"Yes,\" Terrence said. \"But how does that account for Doran's action? Doran must have seen something--\"  \"Doran's charts show high suggestibility under stress. Another weak personality eliminated. Let's regard it that way. He _imagined_ he saw something.\" He glanced at Marsha. \"Did _you_ see anything?\"  She hesitated, avoiding Bruce's eyes. \"Nothing at all. There wasn't anything out there to see, except the dust and rocks. That's all there is to see here. We could stay a million years and never see anything else. A shadow maybe--\"  \"All right,\" Terrence interrupted. \"Now, Bruce, you know the law regulating the treatment of serious psycho cases in space?\"  \"Yes. Execution.\"  \"No facilities for handling such cases en route back to Earth.\"  \"I understand. No apologies necessary, Captain.\"  Terrence shifted his position. \"However, we've voted to grant you a kind of leniency. In exchange for a little further service from you, you can remain here on Mars after we leave. You'll be left food-concentrates to last a long time.\"  \"What kind of service?\"  \"Stay by the radio and take down what we report as we go up the mountain.\"  \"Why not?\" Bruce said. \"You aren't certain you're coming back, then?\"  \"We might not,\" Terrence admitted calmly. \"Something's happened to the others. We're going to find out what and we want it recorded. None of us want to back down and stay here. You can take our reports as they come in.\"  \"I'll do that,\" Bruce said. \"It should be interesting.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Bruce watched them go, away and up and around the immediate face of the mountain in the bleak cold of the Martian morning. He watched them disappear behind a high ledge, tied together with plastic rope like convicts.  He stayed by the radio. He lost track of time and didn't care much if he did. Sometimes he took a heavy sedative and slept. The sedative prevented the dreams. He had an idea that the dreams might be so pleasant that he wouldn't wake up. He wanted to listen to Terrence as long as the captain had anything to say. It was nothing but curiosity.  At fifteen thousand feet, Terrence reported only that they were climbing.  At twenty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We're still climbing, and that's all I can report, Bruce. It's worth coming to Mars for--to accept a challenge like this!\"  At twenty-five thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"We've put on oxygen masks. Jacobs and Drexel have developed some kind of altitude sickness and we're taking a little time out. It's a magnificent sight up here. I can imagine plenty of tourists coming to Mars one of these days, just to climb this mountain! Mt. Everest is a pimple compared with this! What a feeling of power, Bruce!\"  From forty thousand feet, Terrence said, \"We gauged this mountain at forty-five thousand. But here we are at forty and there doesn't seem to be any top. We can see up and up and the mountain keeps on going. I don't understand how we could have made such an error in our computations. I talked with Burton. He doesn't see how a mountain this high could still be here when the rest of the planet has been worn so smooth.\"  And then from fifty-three thousand feet, Terrence said with a voice that seemed slightly strained: \"No sign of any of the crew of the other four ships yet. Ten in each crew, that makes fifty. Not a sign of any of them so far, but then we seem to have a long way left to climb--\"  Bruce listened and noted and took sedatives and opened cans of food concentrates. He smoked and ate and slept. He had plenty of time. He had only time and the dreams which he knew he could utilize later to take care of the time.  From sixty thousand feet, Terrence reported, \"I had to shoot Anhauser a few minutes ago! He was dissenting. Hear that, Bruce? One of my most dependable men. We took a vote. A mere formality, of course, whether we should continue climbing or not. We knew we'd all vote to keep on climbing. And then Anhauser dissented. He was hysterical. He refused to accept the majority decision. 'I'm going back down!' he yelled. So I had to shoot him. Imagine a man of his apparent caliber turning anti-democratic like that! This mountain will be a great tester for us in the future. We'll test everybody, find out quickly who the weaklings are.\"  Bruce listened to the wind. It seemed to rise higher and higher. Terrence, who had climbed still higher, was calling. \"Think of it! What a conquest! No man's ever done a thing like this. Like Stromberg says, it's symbolic! We can build spaceships and reach other planets, but that's not actual physical conquest. We feel like gods up here. We can see what we are now. We can see how it's going to be--\"  Once in a while Terrence demanded that Bruce say something to prove he was still there taking down what Terrence said. Bruce obliged. A long time passed, the way time does when no one cares. Bruce stopped taking the sedatives finally. The dreams came back and became, somehow, more real each time. He needed the companionship of the dreams.  It was very lonely sitting there without the dreams, with nothing but Terrence's voice ranting excitedly on and on. Terrence didn't seem real any more; certainly not as real as the dreams.         *       *       *       *       *  The problem of where to put the line between dream and reality began to worry Bruce. He would wake up and listen and take down what Terrence was saying, and then go to sleep again with increasing expectancy. His dream took on continuity. He could return to the point where he had left it, and it was the same--allowing even for the time difference necessitated by his periods of sleep.  He met people in the dreams, two girls and a man. They had names: Pietro, Marlene, Helene.  Helene he had seen from the beginning, but she became more real to him all the time, until he could talk with her. After that, he could also talk with Marlene and Pietro, and the conversations made sense. Consistently, they made sense.  The Martian landscape was entirely different in the dreams. Green valleys and rivers, or actually wide canals, with odd trees trailing their branches on the slow, peacefully gliding currents. Here and there were pastel-colored cities and there were things drifting through them that were alive and intelligent and soft"]]]
