We can do nothing here.\"  \"Haven't we got time to go to Hope?\" asked Sam, a bit wistfully.  \"Well, I don't know,\" answered his big brother, just as wistfully.  \"Let us take time--Doctor Wallington didn't want us to hurry back,\" put in Tom. \"I think the girls ought to know about this, so as to be on guard, in case old Crabtree tries to molest them again.\"  As the lads were all of one mind, the biplane was headed in the direction of Hope. As before, the flying machine swung through the air at a good rate of speed, and half an hour before sundown they came in sight of the Seminary buildings.  \"Wonder where they are?\" mused Dick, as the biplane came to earth at the spot where they had landed before.  \"If they are around they must have heard us,\" answered Tom. \"The engine makes noise enough to wake the dead.\" And this was well expressed, for the motor, like many of the flying machine kind, had no muffler attached, and the explosions were not unlike the firing of a gatling gun.  Some girls had seen them come down, and presently the boys saw three figures hurrying towards them.  \"Oh, what made you come so late?\" cried Grace, as she rushed up and shook hands with Sam and then with the others.  \"We thought you might come to-day,\" put in Nellie, as she beamed on Tom, and extended both hands.  \"I heard the machine first,\" declared Dora, and came straight to Dick, who did not hesitate to give her the hearty kiss to which he thought his engagement entitled him.  \"We have been to Plankville,\" came from Tom and Sam, in a breath.  \"Have you heard the news?\" questioned their big brother, and he looked anxiously from Dora to her cousins.  \"What news?\" cried Dora, quickly. \"We have heard nothing unusual.\"  \"Josiah Crabtree broke out of the Plankville jail and ran away.\"  \"Oh, Dick!\" and Dora grew suddenly pale. \"Do you really mean it?\"  \"When was this?\" demanded Nellie.  \"Tell us all about it,\" supplemented Grace.  \"We can't tell you any more than what we have heard,\" answered Sam. \"We just got word ourselves this morning.\"  Then the boys told their story and answered innumerable questions which the girls put to them.  \"This will be bad news for mother,\" said Dora, to Dick. \"She is afraid of Josiah Crabtree, and always has been--because of his strange hypnotic power.\"  \"I don't think he will dare to show himself--at least, not for a while, Dora,\" he answered. \"He knows only too well that the jail is waiting to receive him.\"  \"That strange man with the bushy eyebrows and the pointed chin must have helped him to get away,\" was Nellie's comment.  \"So we think,\" answered Tom.  \"But who was he?\" questioned her sister.  \"That's a conundrum we can't answer,\" returned Sam. \"I think he was waiting around with that auto, and as soon as the fire started Crabtree saw the chance he wanted and got out.\"  \"Maybe Crabtree started the fire?\" suggested Dora.  \"No, that was purely an accident--so the jailer says. The wind blew a curtain against a lamp and the burning curtain fell into some excelsior in a box of new dishes. The excelsior made quite a blaze and a lot of smoke, and everybody in the jail was badly frightened for a while.\"  After that the talk became general, and quite unconsciously Dick and Dora strolled off by themselves, down towards a tiny brook that flowed past the campus grounds.  \"You must be very careful, Dora, now that Crabtree is at liberty,\" said the eldest Rover boy. \"I wouldn't have him run off with you again for the world,\" he added, tenderly.  \"I shall watch out, Dick,--and I'll make the others watch out, too.\" And then, as he squeezed her hand, she added, in a lower voice: \"How is that other matter coming along?\"  \"Not very well, Dora,\" and Dick's face became more serious than ever.  \"Can't your father manage it?\"  \"I don't think so. You see, he isn't in very good health--he breaks down every once in a while. Those business matters worry him a great deal.\"  \"Can't your uncle help him?\"  \"No, Uncle Randolph means well, but he is no business man--he showed that when he allowed those men to swindle him out of those bonds,\" went on Dick, referring to an event which has been related in detail in \"The Rover Boys on the Farm.\"  \"But what can you do, Dick?\" questioned the girl, earnestly.  \"I think I'll have to quit college and take up the matter myself,\" answered Dick Rover.     CHAPTER IV  THE END OF THE \"DARTAWAY\"   \"Quit college? Oh, Dick, do you want to do that?\"  \"Not exactly, Dora--and yet I don't think I am exactly fitted for a professional career. That seems to be more in Tom and Sam's line. I like business, and I'd enjoy getting into something big, something worth while. I think I could handle those matters, if father would only let me try. And then there is another thing, Dora,\" went on the youth, looking squarely into his companion's face. \"Perhaps you can guess what that is.\"  She blushed deeply.  \"What?\" she whispered.  \"I want to marry you, and take you some place where I know you'll be safe from such creatures as Crabtree and Sobber and Larkspur--and I want the right to look after your mother, too.\"  \"Oh, Dick!\" And she clung tightly to his arm.  \"Aren't you willing, Dora?\"  \"Yes.\" She looked at him frankly. \"Yes, Dick, whenever you say.\"  \"And your mother----\"  \"Mamma depends upon me in everything, and she has told me to do just as we thought best.\"  Dick gave a swift look around. Nobody was in sight at that moment. He pressed Dora to him.  \"You best and dearest sweetheart in all the world!\" he cried, in a low tone. \"Then I can depend on you? We'll be the happiest couple in the whole world!\"  \"Indeed, yes, Dick!\" And Dora's eyes fairly beamed with happiness as she snuggled closer to him. \"But about your father,\" she continued, a moment later. \"I am selfish to forget him. Then he is not so well?\"  \"He is fairly well, but he gets a bad spell ever so often, and then to attend to business is out of the question. But that isn't the worst of it. He has gotten tangled up in some sort of financial scheme with some brokers in New York City and it is worrying him half to death. He has told me something about it, but I don't know half as much as I'd like to know.\"  \"Then you must find out, Dick, and help him all you possibly can,\" declared the girl, promptly.  \"I'm looking for a letter from home every day--I mean one telling about these financial affairs. As soon as it comes I'll know what to do.\"  All too soon the boys' visit to Hope Seminary had to come to an end. Sam and Tom returned to the biplane and gave the motor a brief \"try-out,\" which noise reached Dick's ears just as he was trying to break away from Dora. He gave her a last hug and a kiss and then ran to join his brothers.  \"The best of friends must part, as the hook said to the eye!\" sang out Tom, merrily.  \"I believe you are anxious to leave us!\" returned Nellie, teasingly.  \"Sure thing!\" he retorted, promptly. \"I planned to get away an hour before I came.\" And then she playfully boxed his ear, at which he chased her around the biplane and gave her a hearty smack just below her own pretty ear.  \"Tom Rover!\" she gasped. But, somehow, she looked pleased, nevertheless.  \"All in the family!\" sang out the fun-loving Rover, coolly. \"As the lady said when she kissed her cow.\"  \"Who is going to run the Dartaway back?\" questioned Sam. \"I think it's my turn at the wheel.\"  \"It's rather dark, Sam,\" answered Dick. \"But you can try it--if you want to.\"  \"All right--I think I can see as much as you or Tom,\" responded the youngest Rover. \"If I get off the course, and you find it out, let me know.\"  Darkness was settling down when the boys finally bid the girls good-bye and flew away. \"Beware of old Crabtree!\" sang out Dick.  \"We'll watch out!\" answered Nellie.  \"Indeed we will!\" came from Dora and Grace.  \"If you catch sight of him, have him arrested!\" yelled Sam, and then the biplane sailed out of hearing.  Sam knew how to handle the Dartaway almost as well as did Dick and Tom, and as there was but little wind, and the flying machine appeared to be in good condition, the others did not doubt but what Sam would make a fine flight of the trip.  \"Keep a little to the south,\" called out Dick, after Hope had been left behind and when they were sailing over some broad fields. \"If you do that you can follow the old turnpike for quite a distance.\"  \"I thought I'd run for the railroad tracks,\" answered the lad at the steering wheel.  \"You can do that later--after we pass that big farmhouse with the four barns.\"  Running along in the air is a different proposition from running on the ground, and the air-man has to be careful about the lay of the land below him or he will soon go astray from his course. The earth looks altogether different when viewed from the sky from what it does when looked at from a level, and when an air-man is five or six hundred feet up he has all he can do to make out what is below him.  It had begun to cloud up a little and this made it darker than ever. After following the turn-pike for nearly two miles, Sam veered slightly to catch the railroad tracks and the gleam of the signal lights.  \"I can follow the lights best of all!\" he shouted, into Dick's ear. \"It's too dark to see the road.\"  \"All right, follow the railroad right to Ashton,\" answered the oldest Rover boy, naming the town that was the railroad station for Brill College.  The cloudiness increased rapidly, and long before Ashton was gained it commenced to blow, gently at first, and then stronger and stronger. Evidently a storm was in the air.  \"We are going to catch it!\" was Tom's comment.  \"Oh, I don't think it will storm just yet,\" returned Sam.  \"Watch yourself, Sam!\" cried Dick, warningly. \"If the wind gets too strong bring her down in the first field we come to.\"  \"I will,\" was the answer.  They were now flying close to the railroad tracks. Presently they saw a glare of light illuminate the rails and a long line of freight cars, drawn by a big locomotive,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5003"],["title","The Rover Boys in New York; Or, Saving Their Father's Honor (#4)"],["body","beneath them.  \"Wish that was going our way--we could follow it with ease,\" said Sam, as the train disappeared from view, leaving the landscape below darker than ever.  The youngest Rover boy now had to give the Dartaway all of his attention. The breeze was coming in fitful gusts, sending the biplane first to one side and then to the other. They struck a \"bank,\" and he had to use all his wit and courage to bring the flying machine to a level keel once more.  \"Better go down!\" cried Tom. \"This is getting dangerous.\"  \"Don't go down here!\" sang out Dick. \"There are woods on both sides of the track!\"  Sam had been working the horizontal rudder, to bring the biplane down, but at Dick's words he shifted again and they went up.  \"I'll tell you when we reach an open field,\" went on the oldest Rover. \"Say, this sure is some blow!\" he added.  Another fitful gust struck the Dartaway and for one brief moment it looked as if the biplane would be turned over. Had this occurred the machine would have dropped like a shot and most likely all of the boys would have been killed.  But Sam was on guard, and worked his levers like lightning. As quickly as she had tipped, the Dartaway righted herself, and then they shot upward on a long slant.  \"Phew! that was some escape!\" muttered Tom. \"Dick, can't you see any open field where we can land?\"  \"Must be one ahead,\" was the answer. \"I fancy----\"  Dick did not finish, for at that moment came a blast of air stronger than any that had gone before. The Dartaway spun around, left the railroad tracks, made a semi-circle, and then came back again. As it made the final turn there was a crack like that of a pistol.  \"What was that?\" cried Tom. \"Was it the engine?\"  \"No, it was one of the stays!\" answered Dick. He glanced around. \"The right plane is giving 'way! Sam, let her down, as quick as you can!\"  \"On the tracks!\" gasped the lad at the wheel.  \"Yes--anywhere--before we tumble!\"  The biplane was already out of control. Sam manipulated the rudders as best he could, and likewise the ailerons, and the machine dropped in several wild dashes.  \"The train!\" yelled Tom. \"Look out for the express!\"  There was another gleam of light along the railroad tracks. The evening express was approaching, running at topmost speed, to make up some lost time.  The biplane was coming down swiftly. It veered towards the woods beside the railroad tracks. Then it took another wild turn and hung directly over the railroad. The boys were speechless, not knowing what to do. The light of the express train kept coming closer and closer.  Crash! the biplane had struck the earth, directly beside the railroad tracks. One end of the machine rested across the rails, the other end hung in the bushes bordering the tracks.  As they struck Tom and Dick were thrown out--the former into the bushes and the latter on the tracks. Sam kept at the wheel, the force of the intact smashing the landing wheels beneath him.  For the instant all three boys were too stunned to do anything. Then, as the gleam from the express train came closer, Tom let out a wild cry.  \"Jump! Jump for your lives! We haven't a moment to lose!\"  \"Dick!\" screamed Sam. \"Save Dick! He is on the tracks!\"  \"Where?\"  \"There!\" and Sam pointed with one hand, while he clambered down from his seat. The seat was broken and his coat got caught in the splinters, and it was several seconds before he could release himself.  Tom looked to where his brother pointed and saw Dick lying in a heap, face downward. The fall had been sufficient to stun him and he was thus unable to help himself.  Tom did not hesitate over what to do. Dick was very dear to him and never for an instant did he consider the risk he was running in going to the rescue. He made a flying leap from the bushes to the tracks and took another leap to his brother's side.  \"Get up, Dick,\" he yelled. \"Here, let me get you off the tracks! The train is coming!\"  Only a faint groan answered him. Dick was still too dazed to think or to act.  Tom caught hold of his brother and raised him up, and commenced to drag him to the other side of the tracks, away from the wrecked biplane. As he did this there came a shrill warning shriek from the locomotive whistle. The engineer had seen the obstruction on the tracks and had put on brakes, in a vain endeavor to stop the express.  As Tom commenced to haul Dick across the tracks, Sam came bounding to his assistance, the shreds of his torn coat flapping behind him. He caught his big brother by one arm.  \"Hurry!\" he yelled, hoarsely. \"The express is almost here!\"  Both boys made a wild leap to the edge of the railroad, dragging Dick between them. Tom got his foot caught in the rails and almost pitched headlong. They fairly fell into the bushes, and Dick went down with them.  Then the express thundered up, the whistle shrieking loudly and the sparks flying from the wheels where the brakes gripped them. The locomotive struck the Dartaway, and the next instant the biplane was smashed to pieces, the broken parts flying in all directions!     CHAPTER V  TWO VISITORS   \"That's the last of the Dartaway!\"  \"Are you hurt, Dick?\"  \"My, wasn't that a narrow escape!\"  \"A minute later and it would have been all up with us!\"  \"I--I guess I'm all right,\" stammered Dick, putting one hand to his forehead, where a lump was rapidly rising. \"I got some fall though!\" he added, grimly.  \"Look what hit me!\" cried Sam, picking up a section of a bamboo stick--one which had supported one of the planes of the flying machine.  \"I'm glad we weren't closer to that smash-up!\"  Having plowed through the biplane, the express train had come to a halt with the last car standing not a great distance beyond the scene of the collision. Already the trainmen were hurrying out, some with lanterns, to learn if anybody had been killed or hurt.  \"Why, it's an airship!\" cried the conductor. \"How in the name of Adam did that get here?\"  \"Here are three fellows!\" cried the engineer, as the rays of a lantern revealed the Rover boys. \"Were you in that flying machine?\" he called.  \"We were,\" answered Tom, grimly.  \"Anybody hurt?\"  \"My brother got a bad tumble and is partly stunned.\"  \"We didn't hit anybody, did we?\" questioned the engineer, anxiously.  \"Nothing but the biplane,\" answered Sam. \"You made mince-meat of that.\"  \"How did you happen to land on the track?\" asked the fireman.  \"The wind put the machine out of control and we came down quicker than we wanted to,\" explained Sam. \"Then you came along--before we had a chance to drag the biplane off the tracks.\"  \"Well, I'm glad I didn't hit anybody,\" said the engineer, in tones of relief.  \"We had a close shave,\" returned Tom, and then he and Sam told of how they had struck, and of how Dick had been dragged out of the way. By this time the oldest Rover boy was feeling more like himself and he managed to stand up, even though somewhat dizzy.  \"Well, we're losing time,\" said the conductor, consulting his watch by the light of his lantern. \"We'll have to get into Ashton and report this.\"  \"And somebody has got to pay for the biplane,\" said Tom.  \"I don't see as it is our fault,\" answered the trainman, and then he gave the order to go ahead--after it had been ascertained that the track was clear.  \"We'll ride to Ashton with you,\" said Dick. \"No use of staying with this wreckage,\" he added, to his brothers. \"We can drive down to-morrow and look it over. I don't think it is worth much.\"  \"Never mind--I am glad nobody was seriously hurt,\" returned Sam.  \"I guess we all feel that way,\" added Tom.  It was a run of only a few minutes to Ashton. On the way the conductor of the train took the Rover boys' names and address.  \"I don't see how you can blame us for smashing the flying machine,\" he said. \"You had no business to come down on the track.\"  \"We might have gotten our biplane off the track, if you had halted the train,\" returned Dick. \"We could have dragged it into the bushes.\"  \"I don't know about that.\"  As soon as the train rolled into Ashton the bays alighted. The only other passenger to get off was one of the local storekeepers.  \"You were lucky boys,\" said the man, pleasantly. He knew them by sight, for they had traded at his shop.  \"That's true, Mr. Striker,\" said Dick. \"But we don't seem to be lucky just now.\"  \"How's that?\"  \"There isn't a conveyance of any kind here to take us to Brill, and I must say I don't feel like walking.\"  \"You go around to Carson's livery stable. He'll take you over to the college,\" answered Mr. Striker.  The livery stable was but a short distance away and they found the proprietor on hand, reading a newspaper and smoking his pipe.  \"It's a wonder you wouldn't have a rig over at the depot, to meet the main trains,\" grumbled Tom.  \"'Twouldn't pay,\" answered Neal Carson. \"I tried it once, and earned two dollars and a half in two weeks. Folks that want me can come here for me.\"  \"Well, we want to get to Brill College,\" said Dick.  \"All right, but it will cost you fifty cents each.\"  \"Very well.\"  The livery stable keeper hustled around and soon had a team ready. The boys were glad enough to take it easy in the carriage, and on the way to college but little was said.  \"Rather late, young gentlemen,\" remarked Professor Blackie, sharply, as they entered.  \"We had an accident, Professor,\" returned Dick.  \"An accident?\" and the instructor was all attention.  \"Our biplane got smashed up,\" put in Tom.  \"Indeed! I am sorry to hear that. Are you hurt?\"  \"Got a shaking up and a few scratches,\" answered Sam.  Then their story had to be told in detail. Soon it became noised all over the place that the Dartaway had been wrecked, and before they could get a mouthful to eat the three Rovers had to tell the story over and over again.  \"I'm sorry the biplane was wrecked, but glad you escaped,\" said Songbird, earnestly. He cherished his old friends as if they were brothers.  \"Just what I say already,\" cried Max Spangler, a German-American student. \"You can buy a new"]]]
