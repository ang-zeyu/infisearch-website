See if you can do better with this one than Buster did.\" He repeated word for word the question he had asked of the computer, that had resulted in its cryptic answer.  Anne stared solemnly at nothing for a moment, with her cheeks puffed out. Then, in measured tones, she recited, \"It's Like Looking for a Needle in a Haystack.\"  John smiled. \"That seems to make as much sense as the Oracle did, anyway,\" he said.  \"Sure,\" answered Anne. \"And you get three words more than your other Oracle gave you, if you count 'it's' as one word. If you want wise-sounding answers, just come to me and save yourself a trip.\"  John leaped to his feet, spilling his drink and strode to Anne's side.  \"Say it again!\" he shouted. \"You may have made more sense than you knew!\"  \"I said you could come to me and save yourself a trip.\"  \"No, no! I mean the proverb. How did you come to think of that proverb?\"  Anne managed to look bewildered.  \"What's wrong with it? I just thought that you can't do any stitching in time without a needle. I just was trying to think of a proverb to use as an answer and that one popped into my head. Uh.... Are you all right, dear?\"         *       *       *       *       *  John picked her up and spun her around. \"You just bet your boots I'm all right. I'm feeling swell! You've given us the answer we needed. You know right where the haystack is, and you know there's a needle there. But finding it is something else again. I don't think the invaders will be able to locate _this_ needle.\"  He set her down. \"Where are my shoes?\" he said. \"I've got to get back to the Capitol.\"  Anne seemed faintly surprised. \"Because of what I said? They're right on the floor there between you and the sofa. But I was just making conversation. What are you going to do?\"  \"Oh, I'm just going to get started at taking stitches in time. Good-by, darling.\" He started out the door, ran back to give Anne a lingering kiss and was soon gone at top speed.  Anne, waving to him, looked very pleased with herself.  By the time Bristol arrived at the Capitol building, the rest of the Council was once again assembled and waiting for him.  \"Well, John,\" said the President. \"You sounded excited enough when you called us together again. Have you figured out what the Oracle meant?\"  \"Yes, sir. With my wife's help. It's obvious, when you finally think about it. It will save us from any danger. And we should have been able to figure it out for ourselves. There's no reason that we should have had to go to the Oracle at all. And it only took Buster--the computer, I mean--two or three minutes to think of the answer, and of a proverb that would conceal the answer. It's amazing!\"  \"And if you don't mind telling us, just what is this answer?\" The President sounded very impatient.  \"We almost had it when we talked of stitching Earth out of reach,\" John answered eagerly. \"If we keep cutting back and forth from one universe toward the other, we will be out of reach, even if we can't move very far. Once a day we reappear in this Universe for a few million-millionths of a second--although it will seem like a whole day to us.  \"Then we spend the following day between this universe and beta. Even if the invaders are right on top of us when we reappear, we'll be gone again before they can do anything. Since we can vary the time of our return within limits, the invaders will never know exactly when we will flick in and out of the alpha plane until they hear our arriving 'bong' wave, and then we will already be gone, since we will be using accelerated subjective time.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Chief Scientist shook his dark head and sighed. \"No, John,\" he said, \"I'm afraid that isn't the answer. I'm sorry. If we start the operation you suggested, we will be cutting ourselves off from solar energy. The Earth's heat will gradually radiate away. Although beta is at a higher entropy level than our universe, we can't use that energy, except to provide power for the stitching process itself. It's true that we would deny our planet to the invaders, but we would soon kill ourselves doing it.\"  \"I didn't mean that we should transfer only Earth, but our entire Solar System,\" answered Bristol. \"As the Oracle told us, the stitch saves nine. A series of time-matched transmitters could do the trick. If we sent the entire Solar System back and forth, the average man in the street would notice no change, except that sometimes there would be no stars in the sky. And when they were there, they wouldn't be moving.\"  \"That would work theoretically,\" said the Chief Scientist. \"And once we were in continuous stitching operations, any invader, as you suggested, could join the system only by synchronizing the transmitter in his ship exactly with all of our synchronized transmitters. That's a job I don't think could ever be done.  \"Remember, though, that our own transmitters would have to be time-matched to within a minute fraction of a micro-second. Considering that some of the instruments would have to be so far apart that at the speed of light it would take hours to get from one to the other, the problem becomes enormous. Any radio-timing link would be useless.\"  Bristol nodded. \"The Oracle said that the stitch must be taken in time,\" he agreed. \"But that is no real problem. We can just send a small robot ship into inter-planar travel and let it bounce back. The 'bong' of its return will reach all transmitters simultaneously and we can use that as the initial time-pulse. Once the operation starts, it will be easy to synchronize, since we will always switch over again on the instant of our return to the alpha plane.\"  The Chief Scientist relaxed. \"I think that does it, John. We hide in time, instead of in distance.\"  \"We stitch in time,\" corrected the President, \"and hide like a needle in a haystack.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"The invaders may eventually find out a method of countering our defense,\" said the Chief Scientist, \"but it will undoubtedly take a great deal of time. And in the meantime, we will have the opportunity to seek out and destroy their home planets. It will be a long, slow process of extermination, but we have a good chance to win.\"  \"I don't agree with that, Tom,\" said John. \"I don't think extermination can be the answer. With our example to guide them, the invaders can use stitching to escape us as easily as we can use it to escape them. What we should do now is to contact the invaders and show them that it is to both our advantages to bring hostilities to an end. By stitching the Solar System, and the other systems of our confederation in and out of the alpha plane, we should be able to gain the time necessary for contact with the enemy and make peace with him.  \"From what the Oracle has told me about the humanlike traits of the invaders, it's very likely they will listen to reason when it's proved that it will be to their advantage.\"  John snapped his fingers and spoke with considerable excitement. \"Now I understand, I believe, why Buster indicated to me that there was another reason for his vague answer to our question. The Oracle feels an unwillingness to accept the destruction of Man's civilization. It feels equally unwilling, I'm certain, to allow the destruction of the invaders' civilization. Buster has an objective viewpoint in applying the _morés_ Man has given him. And it seems to me that Buster felt it important for us to reach this spirit of compromise by ourselves. How do you feel about it, gentlemen?\"  Debate quickly determined that all seven members of the Council favored an attempt to establish a truce--some of them forced into this opinion by their inability to find any method of reaching the throats of the invaders.  Having reached this conclusion, the Council swung immediately into action. Within a few weeks, the entire Solar System, along with the other planetary systems of the confederation, except for their brief daily return, disappeared from the alpha universe.  John Bristol, a few days after the continuous stitching started, was relaxing lazily on the sofa in his living room when there was a sudden pounding on the door. He opened it to find the Chief Scientist standing on his doorstep, his eyes red from loss of sleep.  \"Good Lord! What's the matter with you?\" asked Bristol. \"Have you been celebrating too much? Come in, Tom, come in.\"  The Chief Scientist entered wearily and sat down. \"No. I haven't been celebrating. I've been trying to work out a little problem you left with us. We have been planning, as you suggested, to send out expeditions to contact and make agreement with the invaders. We can send them out all right, but how can we ever get them back into our solar system? They won't be able to find us any easier than the invaders can.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He dropped his hat wearily on a side table and slumped into the closest chair. \"If we don't contact each other,\" he said, \"I am certain that the invaders will some day find a means of penetrating our defenses. Even needles in haystacks can be found, if you take enough time and aren't disturbed while you are hunting. This thing has me licked.\"  Bristol sat down slowly. \"Your whole department hasn't been able to find an answer?\"  \"Not even the glimmering of an idea.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"It looks as if we are going to need the advice of your Oracle again.\"  Bristol stood for a minute in thought and then with a smile said, \"Why, of course. Excuse me for a second, please. I'll be right back.\"  He stepped to the foot of the stairs and called out in a confident voice, \"Come down a minute, please, Anne, darling! I have an important question I want to ask you!\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50940"],["title","Wailing Wall (#0)"],["body","Wall                               By ROGER DEE                        Illustrated by ED ALEXANDER             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                    Galaxy Science Fiction July 1952.

Somewhere above him, the silent audience chambers lay shrouded in lesser gloom, heavy with the dust of generations and peopled only by cryptic apian images. Outside the dome, in a bend of lazy silver river, sprawled the Sadr III village with its stoic handful of once-normal Terran colonists and, on the hillside above the village, Gibson and Stryker and Xavier would be waiting for him in the disabled_ Marco Four.  _Waiting for him...._  _They might as well have been back on Terra, five hundred light-years away._  _Six feet away on either side, the corridor walls curved up faintly, a flattened oval of tunneling designed for multiple alien feet, lighted for faceted eyes demanding the merest fraction of light necessary for an Earthman's vision. For two yards Farrell could see dimly, as through a heavy fog; beyond was nothing but darkness and an outlandish labyrinth of cross-branching corridors that spiraled on forever without end._  _Behind him, his pursuers--human natives or Hymenop invaders, he had no way of knowing which--drew nearer with a dry minor rustling whose suggestion of imminent danger sent Farrell plunging blindly on into the maze._  _--To halt, sweating, when a sound exactly similar came to him from ahead._  _It was what he had feared from the beginning. He could not go on, and he could not go back._  _He made out the intersecting corridor to his right, then a vague oval opening that loomed faintly grayer than the wall about it. He darted into it as into a sanctuary, and realized too late that the choice had been forced upon him._  _It had been intended from the start that he should take this way. He had been herded here like a halterless beast, driven by the steady threat of action never quite realized._ They _had known where he was going, and why._  _But there was light down there somewhere at the end of the tunnel's aimless wanderings. If, once there, he could see--_  _He did not find light, only a lesser darkness. The tunnel led him into a larger place whose outer reaches were lost in shadow, but whose central area held a massive cylindrical machine at once alien and familiar._  _He went toward it hesitantly, confused for the moment by a paramnesiac sense of repeated experience, the specious recognition of_ déjà vu.  _It was a Ringwave generator, and it was the thing he had ventured into the dome to find._  _His confusion stemmed from its resemblance to the disabled generator aboard the_ Marco Four, _and from the stereo-sharp associations it evoked: Gibson working over the ship's power plant, his black-browed face scowling and intent, square brown body moving with a wrestler's easy economy of motion; Stryker, bald and fat and worried, wheezing up and down the companionway from engine bay to chart room, his concern divided between Gibson's task and Farrell's long silence in the dome._  _Stryker at this moment would be regretting the congenital optimism that had prompted him to send his navigator where he himself could not go. Sweating anxiety would have replaced Stryker's pontifical assurance, dried up his smug pattering of socio-psychological truisms lifted from the Colonial Reclamations Handbook...._         *       *       *       *       *  \"So far as adaptability is concerned,\" Stryker had said an eternal evening before, \"_homo sapiens_ can be a pretty weird species. More given to mulish paradox, perhaps, than any alien life-form we're ever likely to run across out here.\"  He had shifted his bulk comfortably on the grass under the _Marco Four's_ open port, undisturbed by the busy clatter of tools inside the ship where Gibson and Xavier, the _Marco's_ mechanical, worked over the disabled power plant. He laced his fingers across his fat paunch and peered placidly through the dusk at Farrell, who lay on his back, smoking and watching the stars grow bright in the evening sky.  \"Isolate a human colony from its parent planet for two centuries, enslave it for half that time to a hegemony as foreign as the Hymenops' hive-culture before abandoning it to its own devices, and anything at all in the way of eccentric social controls can develop. But men remain basically identical, Arthur, in spite of acquired superficial changes. They are inherently incapable of evolving any system of control mechanisms that cannot be understood by other men, provided the environmental circumstances that brought that system into being are known. At bottom, these Sadr III natives are no different from ourselves. Heredity won't permit it.\"  Farrell, half listening, had been staring upward between the icy white brilliance of Deneb and the twin blue-and-yellow jewels of Albireo, searching for a remote twinkle of Sol. Five hundred light-years away out there, he was thinking, lay Earth. And from Earth all this gaudy alien glory was no more than another point of reference for backyard astronomers, a minor configuration casually familiar and unremarkable.  A winking of lighted windows springing up in the village downslope brought his attention back to the scattered cottages by the river, and to the great disquieting curve of the Hymenop dome that rose above them like a giant above pygmies. He sat up restlessly, the wind ruffling his hair and whirling the smoke of his cigarette away in thin flying spirals.  \"You sound as smug as the Reorientation chapter you lifted that bit from,\" Farrell said. \"But it won't apply here, Lee. The same thing happened to these people that happened to the other colonists we've found, but they don't react the same. Either those Hymenop devils warped them permanently or they're a tribe of congenital maniacs.\"  Stryker prodded him socratically: \"Particulars?\"  \"When we crashed here five weeks ago, there were an even thousand natives in the village, plus or minus a few babes in arms. Since that time they've lost a hundred twenty-six members, all suicides or murders. At first the entire population turned out at sunrise and went into the dome for an hour before going to the fields; since we came, that period has shortened progressively to a few minutes. That much we've learned by observation. By direct traffic we've learned exactly nothing except that they can speak Terran Standard, but won't. What sort of system is that?\"  Stryker tugged uncomfortably at the rim of white hair the years had left him. \"It's a stumper for the moment, I'll admit ... if they'd only _talk_ to us, if they'd tell us what their wants and fears and problems are, we'd know what is wrong and what to do about it. But controls forced on them by the Hymenops, or acquired since their liberation, seem to have altered their original ideology so radically that--\"  \"That they're plain batty,\" Farrell finished for him. \"The whole setup is unnatural, Lee. Consider this: We sent Xavier out to meet the first native that showed up, and the native talked to him. We heard it all by monitoring; his name was Tarvil, he spoke Terran Standard, and he was amicable. Then we showed ourselves, and when he saw that we were human beings like himself and not mechanicals like Xav, he clammed up. So did everyone in the village. It worries me, Lee. If they didn't expect men to come out of the _Marco_, then what in God's name _did_ they expect?\"  He sat up restlessly and stubbed out his cigarette. \"It's an unimportant world anyway, all ocean except for this one small continent. I think we ought to write it off and get the hell out as soon as the _Marco_'s Ringwave is repaired.\"  \"We can't write it off,\" Stryker said. \"Besides reclaiming a colony, we may have added a valuable marine food source to the Federation. Arthur, you're not letting a handful of disoriented people get under your skin, are you?\"  Farrell made an impatient sound and lit another cigarette. The brief flare of his lighter pierced the darkness and picked out a hurried movement a short stone's throw away, between the _Marco Four_ and the village.         *       *       *       *       *  \"There's one reason why I'm edgy,\" Farrell said. \"These Sadrians may be harmless, but they make a point of posting a guard over us. There's a sentry out there in the grass flats again tonight.\" He turned on Stryker uneasily. \"I've watched on the infra-scanner while those sentries changed shifts, and they don't speak to each other. I've tracked them back to the village, but I've never seen one of them turn in a--\"  Down in the village a man screamed, a raw, tortured sound that brought both men up stiffly. A frantic drumming of running feet came to them, unmistakable across the little distance. The fleeing man came up from the dark huddle of cottages by the river and out across the grass flats, screaming.  Pursuit overtook him halfway to the ship. There was a brief scuffling, a shadowy dispersal of silent figures. After that, nothing.  \"They did it again,\" Farrell said. \"One of them tried to come up here to us. The others killed him, and who's to say what sort of twisted motive prompted them? They go to the dome together every morning, not speaking. They work all day in the fields without so much as looking at each other. But every night at least one of them tries to escape from the village and come up here--and this is what"]]]
