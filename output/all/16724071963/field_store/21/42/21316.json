I kicked the little mirror out of his reach, bent to retrieve it. \"I'll keep this,\" I said, and wadding the insulated silk around it, I thrust it into a pocket. Evarin's eyes glared at me helplessly. \"You'll stay solid for awhile now,\" I jeered. \"_Toymaker!_ Damned freak--\" I stormed out of the room, leaving him rubbing his bruised shoulder.  Now that Adric was back in control, I had no trouble discovering where I wanted to go. Some blind instinct led me through the maze of elevators and staircases; I stepped into servant's quarters, kitchens, a roomful of buzzing machinery I dismissed with a glance of familiarity; and finally found myself in the open, the semicircle of rainbow towers around me.  Overhead the suns, red and white, sent a curious, double-shadowed light downward through the neatly-trimmed trees. A little day moon, smaller than any moon I had known, peeped, a curious crescent, over the edge of a mountain. The grass under my feet was just grass, but the brightly-tinted flowers in mathematically regular beds were strange to me. Paths, bordered by narrow ditches to keep the pedestrian off the flowers, wandered in and out of this strange pleasaunce; I accepted all this without conscious thought, but some unconscious scrap of memory gave me a vague practical reason for the ditches. I carefully avoided them.  Faint shrill music tugged siren-like at my ears; wordless, like Gamine's crooning. Staring, I realized that the flowers themselves sang. The singing flowers of Karamy's garden--I remembered their lotus song. A song of welcome? Or of danger?  I was not alone in the garden. Men, kilted and belted in the same gaudy red and gold as the flowers, passed and repassed restlessly, unquiet as chained flames. For a moment the old vanity turned upper-most in my mind. For all her slaves, all her--lovers, Karamy paid tribute to the Lord of the Crimson Tower! Paid--would continue to pay!  The men passed me, silent. They were sworded, but their swords were blunt, like children's toys; they were a regiment of corpses, of zombies. Their salutes as I passed were jerky, mechanical.  A high note sang suddenly in the flowers; I felt, not heard, their empty parading cease. In a weird ballet they ranged themselves into blind lines that filed away nowhere; toy soldiers, all alike.  And between the backs of the toy-soldiers and the patterned, painted flowers, I saw a man running. Another me, from another world, thought briefly of the card-soldiers, flat on their faces in the Red Queen's garden. Wonderland. I heard myself say, with half-conscious amusement, \"They all look so alike until you turn them over!\"  The man running between the ditched flower-beds was no dummy from a pack of cards. I saw him beckon, still running. He called to me; to Adric.  \"Adric! Karamy walks here--just listen to the flowers! I was afraid I'd have to get all the way into the tower to find you!\" His voice was urgent, breathless; he slid to a stop not three feet from me. \"Narayan _knew_ they'd freed you! He's outside the gates. He sent me to help. Come on!\"  The sight of the man touched another of those live-wires in my brain; the name of _Narayan_, another still. \"Narayan--\" I said in dull recognition. The word, on my lips, hit a chord of fear, of dread and danger--  But I had come straight from Evarin. I knew the man; I knew the response he expected, but the brief glimpse into Evarin's mirror had set up a chain of actions I could not control. I tried to put out my hand in friendly greeting; instead I felt, with horror, my fingers at my belt and tried, without success, to halt the sword that flew without volition from its sheath. The man backed away, his eyes full of terror. \"Adric--no--the Sign--\" he held up one arm, deprecatingly, then howled with agony, clutching the severed fingers. I heard my own voice, savage, inhuman, the thin laughter of Evarin snarling through it. \"Sign?? There's a sign for you!\"  The man threw himself out of range; but his face, convulsed with pain, held a stunned bewilderment. \"Adric--Narayan promised--you were sane--\" he breathed.  I forced my sword back into the scabbard, staring without comprehension at the blood from the wound I had inflicted, and at the darting heads of the flowers. I could not kill this man who carried the name of Narayan on his tongue.  The flowers twitched--stirred--threw tendrils at the man's bleeding hand. A quick nausea tightened my throat; I motioned urgently to him.  \"Run!\" I begged, \"Quick, or I can't--\"  The flowers shrilled. The man threw back his head, his eyes wide with panic, and screamed.  \"Karamy! Aiiieeeee--!\" he staggered back wildly, teetering on the edge of the ditch. I cried another warning, incoherent--but too late. He trod on the flowers--stumbled across the little ditch. The writhing flower-heads shot up shoulder-high. They screamed a wild paean of flower-music, and he fell among them, sprawling, floundering helplessly. I heard him scream, hoarsely, horribly--I turned my eyes away. There was a wild thrashing, a flailing, a yell that died and echoed among the brilliant towers. There was a sort of purring murmur from the blossoms.  Then the flowers stilled and were quiet, waving innocently behind their ditches.  Karamy, gold and fire, walked along the winding path through the trees. And in the space of a second I forgot the man who lay lifeless in the bed of the terrible flowers.  Karamy was all gold. From her glowing crown of hair to the tips of her little slippers, she was one sunny shimmer; there was amber on her brows and at her throat, and an amber rod twisted lightly between her fingers, its delicate movement outlining my face. Karamy's smile of welcome was a dream which made me know I could be well content if this were my world.  But old habit made me turn my face away; her eyes, cat-eyes of wide yellow, watched me slyly, but her face was turned to the sprawled man in the flowers. \"So? I thought I heard--something.\" Without taking her eyes from my face, she spun the lucent rod. The flower-song rose again, a soft keening wail. Two of the silent guards moved noiselessly through the garden, and at an expressive movement of the rod, they lifted the corpse and bore it away. The music died. The woman's hands went out to pull me close.  \"Adric, Adric! As soon as you are free, they pursue you! That is not what you want, is it?\"  \"Isn't it?\" I asked shortly. I still could not look full at the cat-eyes, the caressing face. A memory scuttled, rabbit-fashion, across my mind, giving name and identity to the man I had betrayed to the flowers.  Karamy slid in front of me so I had to look at her, and the lovely lazy voice murmured the name I was beginning to know. \"You are angry,\" the soft voice caressed me, \"I knew it was not right to let Evarin near you! Adric, we need you, Narabedla needs you! We felt betrayed when you left us, when you shut yourself up alone with your stars! Have you forgotten, or are you still--my lover?\"  It rang phony! Phony, was the way I put it to myself. Part of me felt like calling her a lying she-devil and having that much, at least, on record. But I was fast acquiring a double cunning. The animal cunning of Adric's old habit--and a desperate, trapped cunning of my own, born of a desperate fear of this unfamiliar world. There was nothing I could do except ride on the surface and let my hunches take me where they would. Karamy was very soft and sweet and something more than lovely in my arms and I held her crushingly close while I struggled with a memory. Who was Karamy? Who--and what--was I?  Karamy dropped her arms. The mantle of lazy seductiveness dropped with them. She spoke with eager annoyance. \"You are still angry because I sent you on the Time Ellipse! You do not know it was for your own good--you haven't learned your lesson yet--\"  That talk meant danger for me. I could think of only one way to silence it. She seemed to like it; but even with her lips acquiescent under mine, I was wary. Was I fooling her--or was she only playing my own game, and playing it a little better?  \"Now we can make plans,\" she said a little later, \"First, Gamine.\" She looked sharply at me, but I kept my face expressionless. \"Gamine is always with the old Dreamer; she lets him wake; he will grow too strong. We must send Rhys away from Narabedla. Gamine may stay or follow him to exile. But Rhys must go.\"  \"Rhys must go,\" I conceded.  \"He should be slain, but Gamine will never do it,\" said Karamy with a shrug that disposed of Rhys. \"Evarin--\" she snapped her jewelled fingers. \"His Dreamer sleeps sound! Evarin fears even his own power! My Dreamer grows strong--but he serves me!\" The beautiful face looked ruthless and savage. \"Your Dreamer walks--free in the forest! Only you can re-bind him. You, with my help--Adric of the Crimson Tower!\"  Her eyes smoldered. \"Yes, and my Dreamer shall serve you as well, till then!\" She breathed. \"I will pay to put power in your hands!\"  The very phrase Evarin had used! A shudder stung me briefly.  Her glowing face burned through my sting of fear. \"I go to the Dreamer this night, Adric! Ride with me, and he shall lead you where the Dreamer walks--and lead you back to power! I have said enough--\" the lambent eyes tilted at me, \"Have I not?\"  She had, and too much. For I knew now how the Dreamer must be paid. And the small part of me that was still Mike Kenscott cowered; the rest of me accepted the memory with a shrug. It was this Adric part that spoke. \"I'll go. And afterward, I'll go into the forest where the Dreamer walks--and bring him back to you!\"  But even as I swept Karamy into my arms and bent her head back roughly under my mouth, a warning prickle iced my spine. I said, insinuatingly \"And then, Karamy--\" but my eyes narrowed over her golden head.  Karamy had tricked me before this.     CHAPTER FOUR  Trapped!   Afterward, when I had found my way back to the Crimson"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50566"],["title","Falcons of Narabedla (#5)"],["body","r, I searched for hours for something that might give a clue to Adric's mystifying past. I was puzzled about this Adric who came and went as he pleased in the chambers of my memory. But I found nothing; whoever had stolen Adric's memory, had made sure that nothing in his surroundings should clear up the puzzle in his mind. I knew only one thing. Adric was feared, disliked, distrusted by all the Narabedlans, and all except Gamine had something to gain by feigning friendship. I could not decide whether Karamy's attitude was love that pretended contempt to mold Adric, or me, to her will, or contempt that pretended love for the same reason. And although habit found affection for Evarin, I could not trust him long. Trust a cyclone sooner than that half-mad effeminate! The name, _Narayan_, stuck burr-like in my mind. Friend, or enemy? I sat at the barred window of Adric's high room, trying to force memory from the alien mind in which I was prisoner. And whether it was sheer effort of will, or the result of the fragmentary look in Evarin's mirror, or whether, as Gamine insisted, I was really Adric and Mike Kenscott was a mere superficial illusion of my conscious mind, memory did begin to pulse back.  In the early days....  In the early days, before the vagueness came on my mind, I, Adric of the Crimson Tower, had been a power in the Rainbow City. The memories of that time were not the kind Mike Kenscott would have cared to own, but I, as Adric, found them vastly pleasing. Unlike Gamine, who loved only knowledge, or Evarin, who toyed with pleasure and trickery, I had wanted power. I had it, unlimited, from a Dreamer who stirred only vaguely in sleep. Half the known portions of this world had known the Crimson Tower as lord. And Karamy--  Some memories were triumphant. Some were humorous in Adric's cynical mind. Some were terrible beyond guessing--for Adric had not counted cost, and even he shuddered from the price the Dreamer had exacted.  Then, to this wilful and wild man, something had happened. I had no idea what; Karamy had reached that far back and blurred, though not entirely erased, my memory. It had something to do with a blond boy's face, lifted in incredulous terror--or joy; and a fleeing form, veiled, that retreated down the long corridor of my mind, averting its face as I followed. Whatever had happened, it had come when Adric was sick with blood and horror, when he was surfeited, even if momentarily, with conquest, and sickened at the price the Dreamer extorted. The power, forced through the mind of the Dreamer, called for energy; kinetic energy, available from one source and one only. Adric had fed the Dreamer with that power. For a while.  One day, as a whim, I had redeemed a young woman slave--then the vagueness came and choked me. I might think; I might burst my brain, but so far and no farther my memories would carry me. I _could not_ force memory of that chain of events. But after that, Adric's reign had collapsed like the unstable arch it had been. His armies scattered, and he had shut himself up or been imprisoned in his Tower; his memories had been stolen and he had gone, or been sent, spinning along a time line forward, or perhaps back, until somewhere in the abyss of time he touched Mike Kenscott.  It had been then, perhaps, that Adric had escaped. He had reached, drawn Mike Kenscott back--and switched the two. It was a perfect escape from a life Adric had come to hate.  But I _was_ Adric. There was an explanation for that, too. The physical body could not make the transit in time. I had Adric's body; the convolutions of his brain, the synaptic links of habit. His memory banks. Only the Ego, the super-imposed pattern of the conscious identity, insisted I was Mike Kenscott. In Adric's body, the old patterns ruled, and to all intents and purposes, I _was_ Adric. And back in my own time, I thought, Adric was living in my body--living Mike Kenscott's life, going through the motions, with only the same queer lapses I was making here. And after a while, even these would stop. I was wholly trapped. Here, living Adric's life, the part of me that was Adric would grow stronger and stronger till--he?--unseated the other identity wholly. And he, in my body? Andy, I thought with a wild swift fear, _what will he do to Andy_?  Nothing. He could not hurt Andy--not in my pattern--any more than I could hate Evarin. Or could he?  I had to get back! God, I _had_ to get back!  When the white sun had set and the red sun glowed a darkening ember across the Sierra, a summons came, brought by one of Karamy's toy-soldier cohorts. I dressed--in crimson again, for there was no other clothing anywhere--and followed the voiceless sentry down through a labyrinth of elevators, finally emerging into a long corridor. I strode down it, hearing my own steps echo; a second rhythm joined them imperceptibly, and Gamine stole out of the darkness, swathed in the luminous veiling, creeping noiselessly as a ghost behind me. Later I became conscious of Evarin's padding cat-steps behind Gamine, trailing us, single-file. And other figures came from darkened recesses to stretch the silent parade; a slim girl in a winged cloak, flame color; a dwarfed man who walked beneath the amethyst huddle of purple cap and furs. Memory fitted names to them, but I did not speak to them, or they to me.  After a long time, the immense corridor began to tilt upward, climbing toward a glimmer of light at the end. Without realizing it I had swung into an arrogant, loping stride; now I brushed away the slave-soldier who headed the column and took the lead myself. Behind me the others fell into place as if I had bidden them; the flame-clothed girl in the winged cloak, the cat-footed Evarin, the dwarf bent in his jester's cap, Gamine in the blue shroud. Without warning, we came out into a vast court; an enclosed space, yet wide as the outdoors, a yard, a plaza, a place of imposing grandeur. A place of memory.  The red sun above us glowed like a lurid coal. There were tall pillars on three sides of the courtyard, and at the far end, a vaulted archway led into a treelined drive that stretched away for miles into the twilight. Between two pillars, Karamy waited; slim, shimmering golden from head to foot. A hungry impatience sparked in her cat's eyes. \"You're late.\"  \"I'm ready,\" I said. What I was ready for, I was not sure.  Karamy waved an impatient signal to the Narabedlans who were coming up. \"Adric is with us again,\" she said in her curious lazy voice, \"Your allegiance to Adric--children of the Rainbow!\"  I stood at her side, mute, waiting; a guard of silent men behind us. \"Lord Idris;\" Karamy summoned. The hunchback came to bow jerkily before us. \"Welcome home--Lord!\"  The girl in flame-color darted to where we stood and her dipping curtsy was like the waver of a moth toward a flame. \"Adric--\" she murmured. The wings of her cloak lifted and fluttered across her shoulders as if they would fly of themselves. She was a shy thing, and her dark hair waved softly as if it too were winged. I touched her fingers lightly, but under the smolder of Karamy's gaze I let her go. She watched me, shyly, with averted face.  Evarin's face was slyly malicious, but his voice was pure silk. \"It is--pleasure to follow you again, my brother,\" he almost purred, and I scowled at the mockery at his face and refused his offered hand. Only Gamine said nothing, coming forward on gliding feet to bow briefly and retire; but the silver-sweet, sexless voice of the spell-singer murmured in a singing, almost wordless, croon.  \"Save your spells, Gamine,\" said Karamy savagely, and Evarin jerked round at the shrouded form, but Gamine heeded neither of them, and the sweet contralto chanting went on.  From somewhere the silent men brought horses. Horses--here, in this nightmare world? I had never been on a horse in my life. I found myself vaulting, with a nice co-ordination of movement, into the saddle. The courtyard, for all the bustle of department, seemed to hold the silence of a grave. Karamy kept me close to her. When we were all mounted, she threw the amber rod upward, and the last rays of the red sun caught its rays and sent a pure shaft of light down the darkened alleyway lined with trees. At the sight of that gleam, a curiously familiar emotion stole through me. I threw up one arm over my head, mimicking Karamy's gesture. \"Ride!\" I shouted.  And the flying steeds kept pace with mine.  The driveway under the arch of trees led for miles under the thick boughs. Through the easy drumming of hooves, I could still hear the sweet distant sound of Gamine's singing, which floated on the wind, keeping pace with the rise and fall of the rolling road, in a quick cadence. The wind whipped Karamy's golden hair like a halo about her head. I glanced over my shoulder to where the rainbow towers stood, now black, silhouetted against the greater darkness of the mountains. Overhead in the pink sky, the crescent of the tiny moon was brightening, and lower in the sky I saw another, wider disc, nearly at full. Cold air was stinging my cheeks and nipping my bones with frost, and I felt the sparks struck from hooves beating on the frozen ground.  _Cold!_ Yet in Karamy's garden flowers had glowed in a tropical glory--  And for a moment, it was entirely Mike Kenscott--sick, bewildered and panicky--who glanced about him with horror, feeling the swirling cold and a colder chill from the golden sorceress at my side. It was Mike Kenscott's will that jerked at the reins of the big gelding to end this farce now--  \"What is it?\" Karamy cried, over the noise of the hooves.  And I heard my own voice, raised above the galloping rhythm, cry back \"Nothing!\" and call out a command to the horse.  Good God! I was Mike Kenscott--but prisoner in a body that would not obey me--a mind that persisted in thoughts and habits I could not share, a--soul?--that would carry me to destruction!
