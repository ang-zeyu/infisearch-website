I don't want to know differently--until it's too late.\"  This was just real great. Larson had some fantastic notion, and he wanted it to be true so damned badly that he was taking us into blind jeopardy when we had the means to probe it first. Real scientific, that.  Humans! Men, and their so-called sense of reason! Larson was a crowning example of the sloppy-hearted thing I was fleeing when I embarked on this joy-ride, and now it would probably be my undoing.  We were homing in on the transmission from \"New Columbia\", easing down into the atmosphere, and now clouds and land and water formations took shape. The beam led us to the sunlit rim of dawn, and suddenly we were hovering over a great forest, slit at intervals with streaks of glittering blue that looked like deep, wide rivers.  Now Mac touched a switch, and the CW whistle gave us a tight audio beam to follow to the source of the signal. Larson switched to the micro landing controls to ride in like a jet liner on the Frisco-Shanghai run. We slanted gently down until the forest became trees, and the little blue-green splotches were lush, grassy meadows.  And there was the tower, and the low buildings--and the spaceship!  Something happened to me inside when I saw that. It was a kind of tremolo feeling, like a note in a new symphony, a note that springs free and alone, wavering uncertainly, and you don't know which way it will turn.  In seconds that seemed like hours, we were on the ground, the ramp was jammed out and Larson was blundering down it crying like a baby.         *       *       *       *       *  I stood in the port breathing the warm air redolent with exotic new scents and yawped like an idiot, trying to make sense of the huge banner strung a hundred yards across one whole side of the little village. The banner read:      WELCOME, HANS! WELCOME           ALBERT E.     WE KNEW YOU WERE COMING,              SO--  And near the center of the banner was the largest chocolate cake, or facsimile thereof, in all creation. It must have been ten feet high and twenty feet in diameter.  But Hans Larson wasn't amused by the cosmic gag. He galloped off that gang-plank like a love-sick gorilla. And I'm a comet's uncle if Tina wasn't there, racing out to meet him, Larson had guessed the truth, and no wonder he hadn't had the guts to test it beforehand!  By the time I got down, out and over to where they were all wrapped up mingling tears, I had it pretty well doped out myself.  I don't know why we had figured that all progress and improvement in interstellar flight would cease just because we had left earth. The eternal, colossal conceit of men, I guess.  When our last signal back to earth had given the okay sign, sure, they started building bigger ships and recruiting another crew. But by the time that the _Albert E. II_, was ready to take off for a more extended expedition, the _Larson Drive_ was now the _Larson-McKendrick Drive_, with a velocity of a full half the speed of light, some five times our velocity.  Somehow, Tina had managed to get herself in the party, as Hans had sensed she would. And the time-differential, as it worked out, wasn't serious at all. Tina had been only 32 when we left her on earth. Including the year and a half she had already been with the colony on New Columbia, she was still quite a bit younger than Hans, and just twice as pretty as the day of their separation.  The tremolo note was rising now, the soft, mystic pitch of excitement inherent in the new world.  I turned to Mac, who was grinning like to split his face. I said, \"Looks like you were wrong, old boy--about the impossibility of colonizing.\"  He nodded his head readily, but he wouldn't tear his eyes away from that monsterous, preposterous chocolate cake. The attraction, I discovered, was a little bevy of on-lookers who stood at its base. They were a dozen or more most attractive colonists in the younger age-bracket and unmistakably of the opposite sex.  Mac said, \"Yeah, I was wrong about colonizing prospects. Dead wrong. Aren't you glad?\"  And now the tremolo feeling split into a crescendo of sub-harmonics and overtones, a magnificent chord of attunement with life and humanity everywhere in the universe. And all at once I knew _I was glad_, happy as hell to see these people from the old hometown of earth."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51435"],["title","The Business, As Usual (#0)"],["body","BUSINESS, AS USUAL                              By JACK SHARKEY                          Illustrated by TRATTNER             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                      Galaxy Magazine August 1960.

In 1962, the United States Air Force found itself possessed of a formidable tool of battle, a radar resistant airplane. While this was the occasion for much rejoicing among the Defense Department members who were cleared for Top Secret, this national-defense solution merely posed a greater problem: What should we do with it?  \"There must,\" said the Secretary of Defense, \"be some utilization of this new device to demonstrate to 'Certain Powers' that the world can be made safe for Freedom and Democracy!\"  \"'Certain Powers,' my foot,\" said the President. \"Why don't we ever come out and just say it?\"  \"Policy,\" the Secretary said. \"We've always walked softly in our Foreign Policy; especially softly in cases where we didn't have the 'big stick' to carry.\"  \"Well,\" grumbled the President, \"we've got the big stick now. What do we do with it?\"  \"We just want to shake it a bit,\" said the Secretary. \"No contusions intended, of course. We just have to let them know we _have_ it, but are too kind-hearted to use it. Unless provoked, naturally.\"  \"I can see,\" said the President, \"that this new plane is burning a hole in your pocket. Suppose we do send it flying over Rus--\"  \"_Mister_ President!\" said the Secretary of Defense.  The President sighed. \"All right, all right. Flying over 'Certain Areas,' then. Let's say we get it there. Fine. What do we do with it? Drop leaflets?\"  \"No. That comes under the proselytizing clause in the Geneva Conference of '59.\"  \"I don't suppose a small--well, you know.\"  \"Aggression,\" said the Secretary. \"We'd lose face in the Middle East.\"  \"So?\" demanded the President, spreading his hands. \"They don't like us anyhow, do they? Or the competition--or each other, for that matter.\"  \"That's not the point. We have to _feel_ as though our dollars are buying friends, whether or not it's true.\"  \"Well, then, what _can_ we do?\" said the President. \"No leaflets, no aggression. We couldn't maybe seed their clouds and make it rain on them?\"  \"And get sued by other countries for artificially creating low-pressure conditions that, they could claim, robbed them of their rightful rainfall? We've had it happen right here between our own states.\"  \"Maybe we should just forget about it, then?\"  \"Never! It must be demonstrated to the world that--\"  \"We could take a full-page ad in the New York _Times_.\"  \"It just isn't done that way,\" the Secretary protested.  \"Why not? It'd save money, wouldn't it? A simple ad like, '_Hey, there, Certain Powers! Lookie what we got!_' What'd be wrong with that?\"  \"They'd accuse us of Capitalistic Propaganda, that's what! And to get the egg off our face, we'd have to demonstrate the plane and--\"  \"And be right back where we are now,\" the President realized aloud, nodding gloomily. \"Okay, so what do we do?\"  The Secretary looked to left and right, although they were alone together in a soundproofed, heavily guarded room, before replying.  \"We drop an agent!\" he whispered.  <tb>  The President blinked twice before responding. \"Have you gone mad? What man in his right mind would volunteer for such a thing? 'Drop an agent,' indeed! Ten minutes after landing, he'd be up against a wall and shot. Wouldn't _that_ be lovely for Freedom and Democracy? We'd have the R--the Certain Powers gloating over the air waves for weeks about nipping a Capitalist Assassination Plot in the bud, not to mention the Mothers of America beating down the White House door because one of Our Boys was sacrificed. You know how our country reacts: If an entire division is wiped out, we bite the bullet and erect statues and make speeches and then forget it. But let a single man get in dutch and the whole populace goes crazy until something is 'done' about it. No, it won't work.\"  \"May I finish?\" said the Secretary patiently.  The President shrugged. \"Why not?\"  \"This agent would be something special, sir. One that would not only demonstrate our new aircraft, but which would positively leave the R--damn, you've got _me_ doing it!--Certain Powers tied in knots. In point of fact, our military psychologists think that this agent might be the wedge to split Communism apart in hopeless panic!\"  \"Really?\" the President said, with more enthusiasm than he had shown throughout the entire meeting. \"I'd like to meet this agent.\"  The Secretary pressed a black button upon the conference table. An instant later, the door opened and the Secretary's personal aide stepped in. \"Yes, sir?\"  \"Jenkins, have the corridor cleared and Secret Service men posted at all entrances and exits. When it's safe, bring in Agent X-45.\" He paused. \"And Professor Blake, too.\"  \"At once, sir.\" Jenkins hurried out.  \"X-45?\" said the President. \"Has he no name?\"  The Secretary smiled inscrutably. \"Teddy, sir.\"  \"Why that smirk?\"  \"You'll see, sir.\"  They sat in fidgety silence for another minute, and then a buzzer sounded, twice.  \"Ah, that's Jenkins,\" said the Secretary, and pressed the button once more.  Jenkins came in, followed by a tall gray-haired man who carried a large black suitcase. The President arose, and, as Jenkins left the room again, shook hands with the man. \"Agent X-45?\" he asked.  \"Professor Charles Blake,\" the man corrected him calmly. \"Agent X-45 is in here.\"  The President stared. \"In the _suitcase_? What are we sending? A _dwarf_?\"  \"Hardly,\" said the Secretary, snapping up the hasps on the suitcase and opening it upon the table. \"This,\" he said, lifting something from under tissue-paper padding, \"is Agent X-45.\"  The President's gaze was returned by two shiny black eyes, set on either side of a little brown muzzle with a gentle, stitched-on smile. Agent X-45 was clad in flight helmet, miniature jacket and tiny boots, with a baggy pair of brown canvas trousers belted at the waist with a bandolier holding a dozen small wooden bullets, and dangling a patent-leather holster containing a plastic water pistol. And he wore a small parachute and harness.  \"But that's a teddy bear!\" cried the President.  \"Precisely,\" Professor Blake said.  <tb>  \"I think I'll sit down,\" said the President, and did so, visibly looking like a man who believes he is surrounded by lunatics.  \"And look here!\" said the Secretary, slipping his hand within Teddy's jacket and withdrawing a small oilskin pouch. \"It's rather rudimentary, but the Cyrillic lettering is genuine, and our ambassador assures us the layout is correct.\"  The President took the pouch, unfolded it and drew out a small sheet of paper, covered with the inscrutable letterings, and numerous rectangles and curving red lines.  \"I give up,\" he said. \"What is it?\"  \"A map of the Kremlin,\" said the Secretary, his eyes dancing. \"That big red 'X' is the location of the Politburo Council Chamber.\"  \"Perhaps,\" the President said weakly, \"you could explain...?\"  \"Mister President,\" said Professor Blake, \"I am the new Chief of Propaganda for the government.\"  The President nodded, poured himself a glass of water from a pitcher and drained it. \"Yes, yes?\" he said.  \"Naturally, I have spent my career studying the psychology of a Certain Power....\"  The President groaned. \"Please, gentlemen, let's name names! It need never go outside this room. _My_ lips are sealed!\"  The professor and the Secretary exchanged a look, a raising of eyebrows, then a shrug of surrender.  \"Very well,\" said Blake. \"Russia--\"  \"There,\" said the President. \"That's more like it.\"  Blake cleared his throat and went on.  \"We know the weak spot in the Russian armor is the mentality of the average Communist official,\" he explained, while the Secretary, who had heard this all before, fiddled with the straps of Teddy's parachute and hummed softly to himself. \"They have a distrust complex. Everything and everybody is under 24-hour-a-day suspicion.\"  \"Yes, so I hear,\" said the President.  \"What do you suppose would happen to an agent that was caught by the Russians?\" asked Blake.  \"I'd rather not even think about that.\"  \"Not the sadistic details, sir. I mean the general train of events, from the time of capture onward.\"  The President pondered this. \"After his capture,\" he said thoughtfully, \"he would be questioned. Through various methods--hopelessly at variance with the regulations of the Geneva Convention--they would discover his mission, and then he would be shot, I guess, or imprisoned.\"  Blake nodded grimly. \"And what if an agent landed there that could _not_ divulge his mission?\"  <tb>  The Secretary stopped fiddling with the harness and watched the President's face. On the worn features he read first puzzlement, then incredulity, then a flash of sheer amazement.  \"Good heavens!\" said the President. \"They'd--they'd have to admit a defeat, I suppose....\"  \"But can they?\" Blake leaned forward and slammed his fist upon the tabletop. \"Can the Communist mentality ever admit that it's been bested?\"  \"I--I guess not. At least, they never do,\" said the President. \"But this--\" he wagged a forefinger at the stuffed thing on the table--\"this certainly won't upset them. I mean, after all....\" He looked from one to the other for agreement and found none. \"But, gentlemen, it's nothing but a stuffed bear!\"  \"It won't upset them?\" queried Blake slowly. \"Are you sure?\"  \"Of course I'm sure. They'll find the bear, wherever it lands, and they'll--well, they'll _know_ it's a gag and just laugh at us.\"  \"_How_ will they know?\" Blake persisted.  \"Well, they'll be _pretty_ well certain!\" the President said scathingly: \"I mean a"]]]
