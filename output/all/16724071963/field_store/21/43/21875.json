This thing has left me in a wounding mood.\"  \"Is Mary really in such danger?\" Firebird asked.  \"She may last a week, not much more. Today she'll meet _Klebsiella_, probably; perhaps _E. coli_ and _Shigella_. Pretty soon she'll start to sniffle with the first common cold she's ever experienced. Polio virus and the ECHO group may get to her first, and establish themselves before there is sufficient growth of bacterial flora to give them competition. Her intestinal walls are thin and weak, so she may suffer megacolon as a result of gas-producing fermentation. From a pathologist's point of view, I'll find it most instructive to learn the manner of Mary Lofting's death. From the standpoint of a friend and fellow Lapin, though, I'll think her death a damned shame.\"  \"I'm getting a little drunk, Johnny,\" the Firebird said, \"and a little maudlin. So, say you're right. After all, you're the doctor and I'm just a dumb dietitian. But don't you think maybe it's worth while, what Mary's done? Condemning herself to die, I mean, because she's really in love, and death is what she's got to pay for a few days' happiness. Don't you think the price is fair, Johnny?\"  \"If I did, I'd be paying it,\" I said.... \"No, Firebird. Seizing a little love and poetry before the sacrifice is great stuff for epics, but it doesn't make much sense to me. When I'm married I'll want to see my children all the way through Spock and Gesell. I'll want to grow old with my wife, if you'll excuse the corn.\"  \"We Flesh-Pressers have a natural reverence for corn,\" the Firebird said. \"It's part of the syndrome. Johnny, if you really want what you just said, want those things badly enough to set up a marriage on half a love, give me a call. Anytime. Even though I don't set your blood aflame.\" She stood up, a little unsteady, and rubbed her hand across her eyes in a tardy effort to hide tears. \"Save the brushoff till tomorrow, Johnny,\" she said. \"Goodnight.\"  \"Goodnight, sweet Firebird,\" I said. She turned and walked quickly from the dining-room.  Bud Dorsey, our weight-lifting astronomer, left his three companions to bring his coffee over and sit with me. Bud was the Lapin who'd have been a Central U. fullback as an undergraduate, if only Dr. McQueen had let him play the game in a chastity-suit. \"What will happen to Mary deWitte, John?\" he asked.  \"She'll die,\" I said.  \"One flight in the sunlight, then her wings fall off. We Lapins are a fragile race. May I?\" I nodded. Dorsey poured some of the Scotch into Firebird's empty water-glass and sipped it.         *       *       *       *       *  \"The men who devised the Nuremberg Principles failed us when they forgot to underwrite the romantic aspirations of human guinea-pigs,\" I said. \"As a result of their oversight, it seems that McQueen's Beasts have made a bigger contribution to sociology than to bacteriology. We've demonstrated that familiarity doesn't breed. Here we are, now, fourteen pairs of healthy Americans in their middle twenties, and neither a marriage nor a pregnancy amongst us. Why?\"  \"Tell me, John,\" Dorsey said.  \"I'll tell you why,\" I said. \"It's because we're fond of our foster-sisters, but we're also a little bored with them. And they with us. We men know every canned peach's flirtations and frailties and conversational gambits so thoroughly that one of us could no more marry one of them than the average outsider could marry his kid sister.\"  \"Even that's been done, John, just for principle's sake,\" Dorsey said. \"The Pharaohs wed their sisters because no one else was exalted enough for the honor. Our predicament is not dissimilar. The primal urge, John, will in time overwhelm the curse of contiguity.\"  \"Could be,\" I said. \"But it's not just sex that's agonizing me, Bud. Prison has whole constellations of frustration. However warm and understanding our guards may be, this is still a prison, and half of us are stir-crazy. Why did Mike Bohrman take off his chastity-suit last winter, to walk barefoot through the snow with only his suit-shorts on, till he collapsed from the cold? It was a prison-break, Bud. So was Mary deWitte's witless marriage. They were both suicide, the lifer's one way over the wall.\"  \"Stir-crazy?\" Dorsey asked. \"You're exaggerating, John.\"  \"Open your eyes, Bud,\" I said. \"Look at Karl Fyrmeister's hands, for example. I'm violating no medical confidence to tell you that Karl got his dermatitis as the result of compulsive hand-washing. There's a fine neurotic symptom for a germ-free Lapin! If I'm exaggerating our collective un-sanity, Bud, tell me why Lucy Cashdollar has become an apprentice alcoholic. Why does Fizz Ewell, with an I.Q. that must range in the 150's and the most brilliant record the Nuclear Engineering Department has ever seen, spend six hours a day working crossword puzzles? Why do you have that tic of your left orbicularis oculi? Why am I an insomniac, with a nasty barbiturate habit? Look around, Bud. You'll see that our little home has turned into something of a snakepit. Our neuroses are only garter snakes so far; but they'll grow into cobras, given time and further frustration to feed on.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Dorsey's left eye twitched as though my mentioning his tic had triggered it. He self-consciously raised his fingers to the vellicating muscle, more to hide than to soothe it.  \"While our keepers were sending Lapins through every major discipline offered on the campus,\" he said, \"it seems they'd have done well to have trained one of us in psychiatry.\"  \"For what?\" I demanded. \"So we could have someone right here in the Tank to spoon out our soothing-syrups? Man, we've got a right to be stir-crazy. We're life prisoners and we've committed no crime.\" I stopped to get my calm back. \"Bud,\" I asked, \"do you know what I want more than anything else, next to Anne?\"  \"Of course I do,\" Dorsey said. \"Like you've pointed out, John, we've got no secrets from each other. Your big itch is to step aboard one of the Orion ships. You want to join up for the chase after interplanetary white whales.\"  \"It's only natural,\" I said. \"When we were kids, Bud, we saw the same TV programs, the same space-adventure movies, as the kids who are now the men in space. Every boy in America was conditioned to long for a space-suit. I'm one of the ones who could have made it, Bud. I love medicine, and I think I'm going to be a damned fine pathologist; but I'd turn in my M.D. for an Ordinary Spaceman's ticket without a second's hesitation. When I read, two years ago, that Immermann had discovered that human skull in the oxide rubble below Roosevelt Ridge in Syrtis Major, I cried for the first time since I was six years old. Twenty thousand years ago there was man on Mars. And I'm confined to Earth for life.\"  \"How much do you know about the Immermann skull, John?\" Dorsey asked me.  \"What I've said. Is there more?\"  \"One point,\" Dorsey said. \"My field, radio astronomy, is a deep-space sort of specialty; but I do from time to time condescend to read the _Journal of Aerology_ and the other parochial, solar-system publications. Somewhere I read that there's something odd about that skull Colonel Immermann dug up.\"  \"If you're suggesting that it was a second Piltdown hoax, planted in that Martian talus to jar larger Air Force appropriations from Congress, keep it from me,\" I said. \"I cherish the illusion that the Immermann is genuine, and a mystery.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"It isn't phony, and it's sure as hell a mystery,\" Dorsey said. \"Colonel Immermann's initial report of the skull's discovery was verified by every member of the _Orion Gamma's_ crew, a gang recruited mostly from Service-Academy grads and other high moral types. The peculiarity I'm talking about isn't forensic. It's functional. If you were to mix in the Immermann skull with an assortment of skulls of modern western men, age forty or thereabouts, only one characteristic would allow you to pick it out from the mixture again. 'Look, Mom--No Cavities!' Like us Lapins, Immermann Man had acarious teeth.\"  \"Because he was germ-free?\" I suggested.  \"It's possible. Or his medical science may have gotten oral bacteria under control with drugs. Maybe he preserved his teeth by diet, or with fluorides in his drinking-water. Perhaps his mother never let him eat candy when he was a kid,\" Dorsey said. \"Who knows? Good teeth and all, though, our Immermann Man died twenty thousand years ago. Why? Was he germ-free, as you suggest; and was he killed by some species of Martian micro-organism that's since gone extinct from drought and a shortage of hosts? The big question, to my mind, is why none of our explorers has yet found any sign of the rest of the expedition.\"  \"Expedition?\" I asked.  \"A man could hardly have been alone on Mars,\" Dorsey said.  \"From where?\"  \"Pick any 'F'- or 'G'-type star with planets,\" Dorsey said. \"After all, it's easier to posit extra-solar man than to suppose a flint-drive spaceship was devised by some early neolithic von Brauns.\"  \"I'd never expected to see an astrophysicist take off on such a flight of improbabilia,\" I said.  \"John, would you like to hear a thread-recording I just got from the radio observatory at Adelaide?\" Dorsey asked.  \"Hi-fi?\"  \"The radio sky is strictly spark-gap quality, no fi at all,\" Dorsey said, getting up to lead the way from the dining-room. \"This transmission you're going to hear doesn't have anything to do with the ordinary 21.12-centimeter neutral-hydrogen radiation; but of course you realize that our big paraboloid bowls can catch anything from hydrogen hiss to low-flying bats. Remember the Christmas celebration at New Caanan that was telecast to earth a couple years back? That show was caught by the six-hundred-foot receiver at Green Bank, West Virginia, and rebroadcast by C.B.S.\"         *       *       *       *       *  We entered the Big Tank's common room, where a few of our colleagues sat reading or writing notes for tomorrow'"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51824"],["title","World in a Bottle (#5)"],["body","classes--talking; playing chess or bridge; or sitting behind the closed glass doors of the TV alcove watching the picture through stereo spectacles. We entered the alcove at the other end of the room, where the record-player and music library were, and closed the door.  Dorsey took a three-inch spool of magnetic thread from his shirt pocket and fit it to the playback head of the machine.  \"I'm interested in your uninstructed reaction, John,\" he said. \"So don't ask me any questions till you've heard the whole sequence.\"  \"Spin it, professor,\" I said.  The Australian thread had a noisy background, sounding like a dozen rashers of bacon tossed into a too-hot skillet. Over this hissing, the code began to sound. \"DIT ... DIT ... DIT-DIT ... DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT ... DIT-DIT-DIT ... DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT ... DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT....\" I dutifully entered my count of each burst of DIT's in my pocket notebook. The sequence went: 1, 1; 2, 4; 3, 9; 4, 16; 5, 25; 6, 36; then 5, 2, 49; 8, 64. There the count stopped climbing and commenced again with the pair of ones, to repeat the whole set again.  Dorsey cut off the machine. \"I've got four hours of the same thing on this thread,\" he said. \"Want to hear it all, or have you got it already?\"  \"It's obvious, up to a point,\" I asked. \"It's a table of the first eight natural integers and their squares, except for the number seven, which for some reason is split in two.\"  \"It took me quite a while to recognize what happened to that seven,\" Dorsey said. \"Listen to it again.\" He spooled the thread back and I listened again to the fractured seven: \"DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT ... DIT-DIT.\" Then again the forty-nine clicks, seven-squared. Dorsey switched off the player.  \"Let's have the distillate of your cerebrations now, Brother Bogardus,\" he said, dropping into the deep, red-leather easy chair beside the thread-player.  \"It's syncopation, Brother Dorsey,\" I said.  \"I'd never have given my own modest observations so high-flown a title,\" Dorsey said. \"I'd simply have called it, country boy at heart that I am, 'Shave-and-a-Haircut, two-bits!'\"  \"So it is,\" I said. \"Now we've deciphered that broadcast, and listened to the singing commercial. But I'm still puzzled, Bud. We don't have the sponsor's name and address; and I'm not at all sure I caught the name of his product. What's he advertising?\"  \"His presence,\" Dorsey said. \"I interpret the message as a simple CQ.\"  \"Seek you?\" I asked.  \"Yes. Radio-ham code for, I'm lonely--will somebody please talk to me?'\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I'll accept that interpretation only till I can think of one even more fantastic,\" I said.  \"O.K., John,\" Dorsey said. \"Getting the address of the station was a simple exercise, thanks to my Digger confreres in Adelaide and the men at Harvard's South African radio observatory. We first heard the message two years ago. It's still being broadcast, unchanged. The fist on the key that sent out our arithmetic message belongs to someone in the neighbourhood of Alpha Centauri.\"  \"Hot damn!\" I said. \"But why didn't I know about this? I read _Time_, and all. Why wasn't this headlined?\"  \"Because it's guesswork,\" Dorsey explained. \"This may be the result of some cosmic coincidence as unrelated to intelligent planning as Bode's Law.\"  \"You'll have to explain that to this groundsman,\" I said.  \"Bode's law, too, looks like an intelligently devised code of some sort,\" Dorsey said. \"Take the series: 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192. Add 4 to each number, and divide by ten. The result will be, when you take the asteroid belt into consideration and fudge a little, very nearly the proportional distance from the sun of the first seven planets. Accident, or evidence of intelligent planning? Turned out there are excellent physical reasons for this relationship, reasons old Johann Elert Bode couldn't possibly have guessed. Things like this make astronomers leary of teleology. Make them avoid the splendid guess.\"  \"Go ahead, make a splendid guess,\" I said. \"I won't report you to the Astronomers Union.\"  \"Sure,\" Dorsey said. \"Alpha Centauri, as the U. Cal's five-meter Luna 'scope demonstrated several years ago, has a system of at least three planets. We don't know much about those planets except their time of revolution.\"  \"And that one of them has a citizen clever enough to calculate natural squares and build a radio transmitter....\"  \"... one hell of a transmitter!\" Dorsey said.  \"... and whistle, 'Shave and a Haircut, Two Bits,'\" I went on; \"which musical interlude argues for a certain degree of conviviality on the part of our Centaurian. This thing of his message, though. Do you think he was just looking for other hams to talk with?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Then he's awfully patient, sending out the same 'CQ' for two solid years,\" Dorsey said. \"It's hardly practical to communicate between stars, John. Broadcasting from here to Alpha C. and back, it would take more than nine years just to ask how's the wife and kids.  \"The way it looks to me, our friend out there got the duty of cutting an educational recording to be broadcast automatically to the rest of the galaxy. Kind of a lighthouse, to help his race get in touch with any relatives it might have. That same recording has been played over and over again ever since, sending To Whom It Might Concern its dual message. Simple math--and the most persistent rhythmical cliche known to man.\"  \"What's being done about it?\" I asked.  \"We've answered,\" Dorsey said. \"A big radio noise on the moon is broadcasting the same message, minus the syncopation, and adding the next two terms; all this beamed toward Alpha Centauri. And two years ago, the Defense Department cut other programs to the bone to start construction of _Orion Zeta_, the sixth of the big nuclear-pulse ships. She's up in von Weizsäcker Crater on the back of the moon now, John, nearly finished. She's not meant to call at solar-system ports.\"  \"The government thinks, and you think, that our operator four and a half light-years from here was human,\" I said.  \"I can't speak for the government. But that's what I think. Isn't it human to toss notes out to sea in bottles? What's more human than dropping a joke into an arithmetical table?\"  \"All we've got to do to prove your splendid guess is to highjack a germ-free spaceship,\" I said. \"You and me and any of the other Lapins who feel as we do. We'll go shake the hand--or other prehensile member, if he's not human after all--of our Centaurian thread-jockey. What's to keep our feet in the mud, when our heads are 'way the hell out in a southern constellation?\"  \"I gather, Herr Doktor, that you jest,\" Dorsey said. \"If you were serious, I'd point out one minor flaw in your blueprint for adventure. It would take our little band of pirates one hundred twenty-five years to get to Alpha Centauri, after we'd stolen the ship. That's with the gas-pedal to the floor.\"  \"I was joking,\" I said. \"I was pretending to be the hero of one of those TV space-operas we used to watch.... But if I were serious, I don't think a mere century and a quarter would faze me. We couldn't reach our goal in person, Bud; but we could send our children's children. All we'd need to make the trip, if I were serious about my suggestion, would be a few more volunteers. A proper proportion of those volunteers had best be philoprogenitive females.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Do you think the BICUSPID brass will be happy to see its expensive guinea-pigs taking off into space?\" Dorsey asked. \"Since '29, John, there's been eighty million bucks poured into gnotobiotics here at Central University. We're the payoff. We can hardly expect Dr. McQueen to stand on the launching-pad, tossing roses and shouting Bon Voyage as we blast off forever.\"  \"I think they could be persuaded to be, if not enthusiastic, at least resigned to our departure,\" I said.  \"It does prisoners good to plot escape-plans, even when they're as obviously fantastic as this one,\" Dorsey said. \"Go on, John.\"  \"As you say, our purpose in this adventure would be to escape,\" I said. \"There's no place on earth that can take us, so we're forced to escape into space. We'll have to talk this up around the Big Tank to see how many want to break out with us. What the sex-distribution of the volunteers is, whether we've got the right range of specialists to man a spaceship. Right, Bud?\"  \"It's your dream,\" Dorsey said.  \"O.K. Immermann Man appears to have been germ-free,\" I said. \"Perhaps his culture had been gnotobiotic for so long that they'd forgotten the existence of micro-organisms. Landing on other planets, they'd not rediscover the danger of infectious disease till it was too late. Suddenly they'd start falling, dying of illnesses as mysterious to them as the plague was to men of the Renaissance. This may have been the manner in which the original owner of the Immermann skull died, on Mars. We have a reasonable suspicion that there was germ-free human life in our corner of the galaxy twenty thousand years ago. Perhaps, as you suggested, these visitors were members of an exploration party. From Alpha Centauri? Is our ham who hammered out the table-of-squares a member of that gnotobiotic race? Is he our brother in purity?\"  \"Go on, Johnny,\" Dorsey said. \"You ain't even winded, yet.\"  \"The _Orion Zeta_ is being built for deep space,\" I went on. \"Some group from earth is certain to set out in her on the four-generation hop to Alpha Centauri. Would it be morally right to allow this group of ambassadors to be made up of 'normal,' contaminated humans? To carry to a possibly defenceless population a mixed bag of goodies like _Micrococcus ureae_, _Bacillus vulgaris_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_--a whole spectrum of benign and malignant bacteria? Remember, Bud, bugs that are benign or only mildly pernicious on earth might prove to be killers away from home.\"  \"Lots of maybes,\" Dorsey said. \"Lots of "]]]
