Somebody at Albuquerque did something to Tracey’s P-Forty oxygen tank so that actually he was gas poisoned and knocked cold when he took the first sip as he flew at altitude over the mountains. And--and, by the best of luck, Freddy’s sharp eyes spotted his wrecked plane. Do those guesses sound a little reasonable to you, sir? To you, Freddy?”  “It could be a mighty close to the truth account of what actually did happen!” Colonel Welsh said softly to himself. “But it still doesn’t get us anywhere. It still doesn’t give us anything to jump on.”  “I don’t agree with you there, sir,” Freddy Farmer spoke up quietly.  The senior Intelligence officer looked across the desk at him as though he were a long lost brother with a precious family secret.  “Well, thank Heavens, you don’t!” he breathed. “Go ahead and tell me why you don’t agree.”  The English born flying ace took a couple of seconds out to think up the words he wanted to use.  “I believe I know what is in the back of Dawson’s mind,” he eventually said. “We _have_ got something. It may prove to be nothing; to be absolutely worthless. But we don’t know about that yet. I’m speaking of this Second Lieutenant Marble with the Ninety-Sixth Squadron down in the Canal Zone. Perhaps there is the chance that he can give us a lead on what Tracey was working on. Is there any way you can contact him, sir?”  “Why, certainly!” Colonel Welsh replied quickly. “I can--”  “Contact him, nothing!” Dave cut in harshly. “I mean, not unless it is a personal contact. But Freddy’s only come up with half the stuff I had in mind. Right here in Frisco--right here in this room--we have a perfect lead.”  Colonel Welsh sat up straight and quickly glared about the office as though he expected it to fill suddenly with people.  “Here in this room?” he demanded, fixing Dave with his steady eyes. “What in the world do you mean?”  “Not in the room, exactly,” Dave said with a faint grin, “but the man who went out of the room. I mean, whoever it was that slugged Rigby and stole your decoded message to him. He’s here. And it’s a cinch he’s been keeping an eye on this place. So who says he won’t continue to keep an eye on it? You follow me, sir?”  “Not exactly,” the senior officer grunted. “But you’re right when you say he’s been keeping an eye on this place. I could name on the fingers of one hand the men who know this is not strictly a Civilian Defense office for this section of the city. And they’re all trustworthy. Yet somebody else found out, either Seven-Eleven in person, or somebody in his pay. Anyway, that’s the end of this place for Intelligence contact work. I’ve got to dig up a new spot now, one that I hope will be fool-proof. No, I mean spy proof, I guess.”  Dave frowned and gave a little shake of his head.  “Naturally, you know best, sir,” he said slowly, after a moment or two. “As the saying goes, it’s not for the likes of me to tell you your business. But--well--I mean--”  The Yank born air ace floundered to a stop, and a faint flush stole into his face. Colonel Welsh stared at him for a moment, and then suddenly chuckled softly.  “I seem to remember a couple of times when you weren’t so polite to your senior officer, Dawson,” he said. “And _I_ was the senior officer. I understand, but forget it, Dawson. All this is just between the three of us. So give it to me right from the shoulder. What’s wrong with my closing up this place as far as Intelligence work is concerned?”  “Everything, Colonel,” Dave told him bluntly. “Close up this place and open another, and you’ll lose the only contact you have with the enemy agent, _or agents_, working in Frisco. Of course you haven’t what you’d call a real contact with him now. He’s just a man Rigby saw for a split second before he got slammed on the head. But maybe we could make a real contact with him.”  “What’s your idea on how to do it?” the Chief of all U.S. Intelligence asked quietly. “And what would we gain by making a definite contact?”  Dave looked at him, and grinned faintly.  “Maybe this one is going to hurt, Colonel,” he said. “What made him come here in the first place?”  The senior officer stiffened slightly, and looked puzzled.  “What’s that?” he echoed. “Aren’t you making it a little complicated, Dawson?”  “Perhaps I am,” Dave said with a shrug. “Perhaps I am, because it’s not very clear to me. Let’s put it this way. The object of our unknown enemies was to put poor Tracey out of the way, wasn’t it?”  “Yes, of course!” Colonel Welsh replied sharply. “So what?”  “So this,” Dawson said evenly. “It was done. But it wasn’t done from this end. At least, I’d bet my shirt on it. Tracey’s death was caused by somebody _at Albuquerque_! So why did that slugger come to see Rigby?”  “To get my code message,” Colonel Welsh said. “I think that fact’s obvious.”  Dave leaned forward and held the senior officer with his steady eyes.  “And what did your message say?” he demanded.  “I’ve already told you!” the other replied with a scowl. “I wired Rigby in code that Tracey was on his way here to meet me.”  “I follow your line of reasoning, Dave!” Freddy Farmer broke in excitedly. “He simply found out something he already knew!”  “Bright lad!” Dawson beamed at him. “Go to the basket and pick yourself a nice red apple. You catch on quick, pal!”  “I do more than that, my little man!” the English youth shot back at him. “That chap’s visit here had no connection at all with Tracey’s death. Correct?”  “Now, wait a minute, you two!” Colonel Welsh shouted before Dave could speak. “I’m supposed to be the expert on riddles, but, by Heaven, you’ve got my brain tied up in knots. What in thunder are you talking about anyway?”  “Why, that lad’s visit here, sir,” Dave replied with an innocent grin. “Why he came here. This is just a wild guess, of course, but I think he came here _hoping_ to find out _more_ from your wire.”  “Ah!” Colonel Welsh breathed as his face brightened. “I get it now, of course. Just another bit of proof that I must be slipping in my old age. Maybe I should resign from the Service. Anyway, I see what you mean. The rat in Albuquerque found out about Tracey’s wire to me. He then contacted his rat co-worker here in Frisco and told him to keep a keener eye on this office, because I would undoubtedly be wiring instructions here. Which I did. But, thunderation! What else did he expect me to say in my wire to Rigby?”  “That’s anybody’s guess,” Dave said with a frown. “But somehow it spells WORRY to me, in big letters.”  “Quite!” Freddy Farmer echoed, and gave an emphatic nod of his head.  Colonel Welsh flushed and threw up his hands.  “Confound it, there you go again!” he bit off. “Worry? What the blue blazes has worry got to do with it?”  “Plenty!” Dave threw the word at him. “Worry that maybe you _did_ make telephone or telegraph contact with Tracey before he left Albuquerque, and that he gave you a good idea of why he wanted to see you here. So maybe you wired certain instructions to Rigby. But you _didn’t_ wire any such instructions to Rigby. So our rat friend learned nothing. So he’s still in the dark about your knowing anything of poor Tracey’s secret. So he must still be worrying.”  “I get it, I get it!” Colonel Welsh murmured softly.  “I spoke about maybe something hurting, awhile back,” Dave said, and pointed a finger. “I meant that maybe your phones here are tapped. Maybe this place is full of leaks. Well, there’s one way to find out, and maybe get some results.”  Colonel Welsh just looked at him with raised eyebrows as Dave paused.  “So let’s put out a bit of bait, and see what we catch,” Dawson continued. “Phone some cooked up message back to your Washington office.”  “Such as?” Colonel Welsh grunted.  Dave didn’t reply at once. He sat frowning off into space and absently tapping a fingernail against his top front teeth. Suddenly he took his hand down and snapped his fingers, and flashed a grin at Freddy Farmer before he gave his attention to the Colonel.  “Got it, I think!” he breathed excitedly. “Wire your office, in code of course, that Tracey is dead, but _that his message got through_! And that you are sending two of your agents to Albuquerque to begin operations there!”  “What operations?” Colonel Welsh demanded.  Dave laughed and snapped his fingers again.  “That’s just _it_!” he cried. “That’s just what our rat friend will wonder--and wonder plenty. So he’ll probably do something about it, and you can nail him. If nothing else, that will put an end to the Number One Man here in Frisco. And there’s just the chance that we may also grab the lad--whoever he is--at the Albuquerque Base.”  “Yes, that’ll be something,” Colonel Welsh said grimly. “That will be a lot, in fact. And your words aren’t riddles to me now. The two agents who are supposed to be going to Albuquerque with information? They wouldn’t be you two, by any chance, would they?”  “They’d be anybody else over our dead bodies!” Freddy Farmer spoke up. “Quite. And I think that’s rather a clever idea. It coming from Dawson, I’m no end surprised. He’s been reading books, I fancy, when I haven’t been looking.”  “See that window, pal?” Dave said softly, and pointed.  “Certainly,” Freddy replied. “Why?”  “It only happens to be fourteen floors above the street!” Dave said darkly. “And you’re not wearing your parachute now. Just keep that little item in mind, sweetheart!”  “If I go, there’ll be _two_ of us!” the English youth snorted, and then grinned.  “Okay, okay!” Colonel Welsh growled, though there was a smile at the corners of his mouth. “Recess is over, children. Let’s get back to serious things. And it is _mighty_ serious. We know what happened to poor Tracey, and I wouldn’t want--”  The senior officer hesitated and gestured with one hand.  “Neither would we, sir,” Dave spoke up quietly. “But this isn’t any pink tea. And Freddy and I have played plenty of long shot chances before. So there’s no sense talking about the danger part. Now, here is my idea. We’ll"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/52095"],["title","Dave Dawson with the Air Corps (#7)"],["body","to Albuquerque by air, of course. And don’t worry! We’ll keep low enough so that we won’t have to sip oxygen at all. So that angle’s out. And we’ll also give the plane a darn good going over before a throttle is opened wide. On the way, we will keep our eyes open. And every minute after that.”  “You could be attacked from the air,” Colonel Welsh said with a scowl. “It’s happened before. And this time it might be odds that you two sky scrappers couldn’t match.”[2]  “That’s one of the chances we take,” Freddy Farmer said gravely. “But I’ve got an idea. Why not have another plane follow us--one piloted by one of your agents, sir? Then if Dave and I bump into trouble, he can give us a hand. Then, too, he might spot the chap hiking after us, scare him off, and trail him back home. Then you’d have him, nice as can be. And in his secret drome hide-out, no doubt.”  “Somebody else has been reading books on the sly, too!” Dave said with a chuckle. “Pick yourself another apple, Freddy. That was tops for an idea. Don’t you think so, sir?”  “Well, it would make me feel a lot better to work it that way,” the Chief of U.S. Intelligence said. “And of course, I’ll arrange--and not from _this_ office--for a couple of my men to keep an eye on you when you arrive in Albuquerque. Then if somebody gets on your tail down there my agents can close in and grab him. But--”  Colonel Welsh let the rest hang in mid air and sat chewing on his lower lip in brooding silence.  “So what?” Freddy Farmer said. Then catching himself and blushing slightly. “I mean, sir, what were you going to say?”  “Supposing we have all the luck in the world,” the senior officer said, as though talking to himself. “Supposing we catch, the Axis rat at this end, and at the Albuquerque end. What then? Notwithstanding what we read in the papers lately, I don’t think we’ll be able to learn a lot from our two prisoners. Most certainly, nothing that would make it possible either to get our hands on this confounded Seven-Eleven, or to learn the secret poor Tracey was never able to reveal. And that, of course, is our real goal. That is, if it’s possible to have a goal in this mess.”  “Well, we’ve just been talking about this end of things, sir,” Dave said. “Just a way to clear up a couple of puzzling details. When Freddy and I reach Albuquerque, we certainly don’t intend to stop there.”  “What’s that again?” Colonel Welsh asked sharply.  “Quite!” Freddy Farmer echoed. “I don’t get the point of that one, myself.”  Dave turned to him, and grinned.  “Ever see the Panama Canal, Freddy?” he asked.  “Eh?” the English youth ejaculated as his eyes flew open wide. “Why, no, never. But I’ve always heard it’s quite a wonderful sight to see.”  “It’s more than that,” Dave said firmly. “You’ll get a big kick out of seeing it, particularly from the air. You see the whole works that way, from end to end. Oh, sure--”  “Just a minute, now!” Colonel Welsh cut in. “Why should you and Farmer go to the Canal Zone? What in thunder do you--?”  The senior officer stopped short, clenched his teeth in a gesture of self-exasperation, and whistled air between them.  “Of course, of course!” he grated. “What in thunder is the matter with me today.”  “You get the idea, sir,” Dave said with a grin. “Second Lieutenant Marble, of the Ninety-Sixth Attack Squadron, is in the Canal Zone. Can you arrange with Army Air Corps H.Q. in Washington to have us assigned for duty with the Ninety-Sixth?”  “I can do much better than that,” Colonel Welsh replied. “If you were assigned strictly to the Squadron for active duty, your chances of getting around--in the event you did get hold of something--might be a bit limited. And that’s not even mentioning the suspicions you might create. I’ll see that you are assigned to Ninety-Six, but for special duty, we’ll say. It will appear that you’re making some kind of an inspection trip on orders from Washington. That way you can come and go as you please, and nobody will think anything of it.”  “Swell!” Dave breathed. “It couldn’t be better.”  “If, and when, you arrive in the Canal Zone,” Colonel Welsh said almost in a tone of prayer.  “Oh, we jolly well will, sir!” Freddy Farmer spoke up. “Now that I’ve the chance to see that wonderful feat of engineering, no blasted Axis agents are going to stop me. At least, not if I can help it!”  “Atta boy, Freddy,” Dave chuckled. “We’ll give them the works, hey, kid? Well, Colonel, I guess that’s about all, isn’t it? Isn’t now as good a time as any to make that Washington call, and bait our little trap?”  The Chief of all U.S. Intelligence Services drummed his fingers on the desk for a moment, and then nodded.  “Yes, I guess it is,” he grunted. “And I hope you’re right, Dawson. I hope our friend did put a smooth one over on me, and that he tapped into these things.”  And on saying that, the Colonel reached out a hand and pulled one of the phones to him.  -----  Footnote 2:    “_Dave Dawson with the Pacific Fleet._”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  CHAPTER SEVEN                              _Missing Wings_   IT WAS EARLY the next morning and the first flaming rays of the new day’s sun were just shooting up over the peaks of the mountains to the east. The last of the thin night fog was drifting out across San Francisco Bay, leaving the air washed and crisp and tangy. Though it was still early, activity at the Frisco Air Corps Base was in full swing. Swarms of wings flashed back and forth across the robin’s-egg blue sky, and the air was filled with the thunder and power whines of many engines.  Down on the field, Dave and Freddy stood beside the Vultee they had flown up in from Los Angeles. Colonel Welsh was with them, and although the pilots’ faces were bright with eager expectation of new adventures before them, there was no eagerness in the Colonel’s face. There wasn’t even so much as the ghost of a smile. His eyes were somber and brooding, and there was a tightness about the corners of his mouth. Dave glanced at him, and grinned.  “Chin up, white tie, and all that sort of thing, as Freddy would say, sir,” he said. “This will probably turn out to be nothing more than a swell joy ride. Who knows? Maybe my ideas on the wire tapping were as wet as the Bay over there. Please don’t feel so tough about it, Colonel.”  The senior officer forced a smile to his lips, made a little gesture with his hands, and sighed.  “I know, I know,” he said. “I always act like an undertaker whenever I see any of my agents off on a mission. Can’t seem to change, or get used to it. I guess it’s because it gets me inside that I’m not going along, that I’ve got to stick here and take care of all the confounded paper work. Makes me feel useless, like a doddering old man too old to take part in the tough jobs.”  “Oh, I say, hardly, sir!” Freddy Farmer said with a laugh. “If there weren’t the brains for the paper work, as you call it, there wouldn’t be any jobs for the agents to tackle. And I fancy, sir, there was a time not so long ago when you were the one who was being seen off by some other senior officer.”  “Yes, you’re right, Farmer,” Colonel Welsh nodded sadly. “There was a day like that. But it seems centuries ago. I swear, if I had it all to live over again I’d never let them push me up to a post of important command. When you’re on the way up you never stop to think how lucky you are you haven’t reached the top yet. But I suppose that comes under the heading of ambition, or something.”  “That makes two,” Dave chuckled. “Only yesterday the Base Commandant at L.A. was telling Freddy and me the same thing. And by the way, sir, is that why you made us a couple of captains in the Air Corps, instead of colonels or generals?”  Colonel Welsh laughed out loud and shook his head.  “No, not for that reason,” he said. “True, despite your youthful looks, you might get by as colonels. But not generals. We don’t make them that young, yet. No. As captains you can mingle with the higher ranks if you have to, and not appear as though you were reaching for the moon. And as captains you can mingle with the lower ranks, and enlisted men, and not appear as though you were out sticking your noses into things. Matter of fact, I’ve always regarded a captaincy as the halfway mark in a man’s military career. As a captain he still has close contact with those on the bottom of the ladder, and new contacts with those on the top. But--here I stand gabbing, and you two are just busting to get away. Right?”  “Well, it has to happen sometime, sir,” Dave said kindly. “And--well, count on us to stay in there pitching to the very end, regardless of what the end may be.”  “Here, drop that sort of talk!” Freddy Farmer cried scornfully. “You’ll have me flooding that rear cockpit with tears. One thing, sir. You’ll be sure to make it all right with the Base Commandant at Los Angeles? I mean, about our taking his plane? After that bit of luck yesterday--well, the ship is sort of a good fortune charm, if you understand what I mean.”  “Perfectly,” Colonel Welsh said gravely. “And don’t worry about the L.A. Base Commandant. He happens to be one of the whitest men in the Air Corps. Besides, when he loaned you his ship in the first place, that meant it was yours as long as you wanted it. He’s that way. Now--well, get out of here before I change my mind! I feel like the executioner at Sing Sing waiting to throw the switch. Get off with you. Good luck.... And may He watch over you as He has in the past.”  “Thanks, sir,” Dave said with an effort. “And--so long.”  “Quite, sir,” Freddy Farmer murmured. “Happy landings until we meet again--which of course will be very soon.”  The two flying aces clicked their heels, saluted smartly, then turned abruptly away and climbed into the Vultee’s pits. Dave ran his eye over the instruments in an automatic check, opened his throttle a bit to “blow” his engine and clear the cylinders of dead gas"]]]
