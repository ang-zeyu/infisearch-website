He _did_ tell her, over and over, that he knew she was unhappy and that it was his fault. But he was at the same time soothing her, petting her, as if _he was afraid of her_.  He talked on and on. Gradually, Mary understood in his trembling body, in his perspiring palms, in his pleading eyes, that he was afraid of dying, that he was afraid _she_ would kill him with the merest thing she said, with her very presence.  This was not painful to Mary, because, suddenly, something came with ponderous enormity to stand before her: _I would just as soon the child did not realize her relationship to this sordid situation._  Her relationship. It was some kind of relationship to Conrad and Clara Manz, because those were the people they had been talking about.  The moment her father left the apartment, she went to his desk and took out the file of family records. After she found the address of Conrad Manz, the idea occurred to her to write it on her body. Mary was certain that Susan Shorrs never bathed and she thought this a clever idea. Sometime on Susan's rest day, five days from now, she would try to force the shift and go to see Conrad and Clara Manz. Her plan was simple in execution, but totally vague as to goal.  Mary was already late when she hurried to the children's section of a public shifting station. A Children's Transfer Bus was waiting, and Mary registered on it for Susan Shorrs to be taken to school. After that she found a shifting room and opened it with her wristband. She changed into a shifting costume and sent her own clothes and belongings home.  Children her age did not wear makeup, but Mary always stood at the mirror during the shift. She always tried as hard as she could to see what Susan Shorrs looked like. She giggled over a verse that was scrawled beside the mirror ...      Rouge your hair and comb your face;     Many a third head is lost in this place.  ... and then the shift came, doubly frightening because of what she knew she was going to do.         *       *       *       *       *  Especially if you were a hyperalter like Mary, you were supposed to have some sense of the passage of time while you were out of shift. Of course, you did not know what was going on, but it was as though a more or less accurate chronometer kept running when you went out of shift. Apparently Mary's was highly inaccurate, because, to her horror, she found herself sitting bolt upright in one of Mrs. Harris's classes, not out on the playgrounds, where she had expected Susan Shorrs to be.  Mary was terrified, and the ugly school dress Susan had been wearing accented, by its strangeness, the seriousness of her premature shift. Children weren't supposed to show much difference from hyperalter to hypoalter, but when she raised her eyes, her fright grew. Children did change. She hardly recognized anyone in the room, though most of them must be the alters of her own classmates. Mrs. Harris was a B-shift and overlapped both Mary and Susan, but otherwise Mary recognized only Carl Blair's hypoalter because of his freckles.  Mary knew she had to get out of there or Mrs. Harris would eventually recognize her. If she left the room quietly, Mrs. Harris would not question her unless she recognized her. It was no use trying to guess how Susan would walk.  Mary stood and went toward the door, glad that it turned her back to Mrs. Harris. It seemed to her that she could feel the teacher's eyes stabbing through her back.  But she walked safely from the room. She dashed down the school corridor and out into the street. So great was her fear of what she was doing that her hypoalter's world actually seemed like a different one.  It was a long way for Mary to walk across town, and when she rang the bell, Conrad Manz was already home from work. He smiled at her and she loved him at once.  \"Well, what do you want, young lady?\" he asked.  Mary couldn't answer him. She just smiled back.  \"What's your name, eh?\"  Mary went right on smiling, but suddenly he blurred in front of her.  \"Here, here! There's nothing to cry about. Come on in and let's see if we can help you. Clara! We have a visitor, a very sentimental visitor.\"  Mary let him put his big arm around her shoulder and draw her, crying, into the apartment. Then she saw Clara swimming before her, looking like her mother, but ... no, not at all like her mother.  \"Now, see here, chicken, what is it you've come for?\" Conrad asked when her crying stopped.  Mary had to stare hard at the floor to be able to say it. \"I want to live with you.\"  Clara was twisting and untwisting a handkerchief. \"But, child, we have already had our first baby appointed to us. He'll be with us next shift, and after that I have to bear a baby for someone else to keep. We wouldn't be allowed to take care of you.\"  \"I thought maybe I was your real child.\" Mary said it helplessly, knowing in advance what the answer would be.  \"Darling,\" Clara soothed, \"children don't live with their natural parents. It's neither practical nor civilized. I have had a child conceived and borne on my shift, and this baby is my exchange, so you see that you are much too old to be my conception. Whoever your natural parents may be, it is just something on record with the Medicorps Genetic Division and isn't important.\"  \"But you're a special case,\" Mary pressed. \"I thought because it was a special arrangement that you were my real parents.\" She looked up and she saw that Clara had turned white.  And now Conrad Manz was agitated, too. \"What do you mean, we're a special case?\" He was staring hard at her.  \"Because....\" And now for the first time Mary realized how special this case was, how sensitive they would be about it.  He grasped her by the shoulders and turned her so she faced his unblinking eyes. \"I said, what do you mean, we're a special case? Clara, what in thirty heads does this kid mean?\"  His grip hurt her and she began to cry again. She broke away. \"You're the hypoalters of my appointed father and mother. I thought maybe when it was like that, I might be your real child ... and you might want me. I don't want to be where I am. I want somebody....\"  Clara was calm now, her sudden fear gone. \"But, darling, if you're unhappy where you are, only the Medicorps can reappoint you. Besides, maybe your appointed parents are just having some personal problems right now. Maybe if you tried to understand them, you would see that they really love you.\"  Conrad's face showed that he did not understand. He spoke with a stiff, quiet voice and without taking his eyes from Mary. \"What are you doing here? My own hyperalter's kid in my house, throwing it up to me that I'm married to his wife's hypoalter!\"  They did not feel the earth move, as she fearfully did. They sat there, staring at her, as though they might sit forever while she backed away, out of the apartment, and ran into her collapsing world.         *       *       *       *       *  Conrad Manz's rest day fell the day after Bill Walden's kid showed up at his apartment. It was ten days since that strait jacket of a conference on Santa Fe had lost him a chance to blast off a rocket racer. This time, on the practical knowledge that emergency business conferences were seldom called after lunch, Conrad had placed his reservation for a racer in the afternoon. The visit from Mary Walden had upset him every time he thought of it. Since it was his rest day, he had no intention of thinking about it and Conrad's scrupulously drugged mind was capable of just that.  So now, in the lavish coolness of the lounge at the Rocket Club, Conrad sipped his drink contentedly and made no contribution to the gloomy conversation going on around him.  \"Look at it this way,\" the melancholy face of Alberts, a pilot from England, morosely emphasized his tone. \"It takes about 10,000 economic units to jack a forty ton ship up to satellite level and snap it around the course six times. That's just practice for us. On the other hand, an intellectual fellow who spends his spare time at a microfilm library doesn't use up 1,000 units in a year. In fact, his spare time activity may turn up as units gained. The Economic Board doesn't argue that all pastime should be gainful. They just say rocket racing wastes more economic units than most pilots make on their work days. I tell you the day is almost here when they ban the rockets.\"  \"That's just it,\" another pilot put in. \"There was a time when you could show that rocket races were necessary for better spaceship design. Design has gone way beyond that. From their point of view we just burn up units as fast as other people create them. And it's no use trying to argue for the television shows. The Board can prove people would rather see a jet-skiing meet at a cost of about one-hundredth that of a rocket race.\"  Conrad Manz grinned into his drink. He had been aware for several minutes that pert little Angela, Alberts' soft-eyed, husky-voiced wife, was trying to catch his eye. But stranded as she was in the buzzing traffic of rockets, she was trying to hail the wrong rescuer. He had about fifteen minutes till the ramp boys would have a ship ready for him. Much as he liked Angela, he wasn't going to miss that race.  Still, he let his grin broaden and, looking up at her, he lied maliciously by nodding. She interpreted this signal as he knew she would. Well, at least he would afford her a graceful exit from the boring conversation.  He got up and went over and took her hand. Her full lips parted a little and she kissed him on the mouth.  Conrad turned to Alberts and interrupted him. \"Angela and I would like to spend a little time together. Do you mind?\"  Alberts was annoyed at having his train of thought broken and rather snapped out the usual courtesy. \"Of course not. I'm glad for both of you.\"  Conrad looked the group over with a bland stare. \"Have you lads ever"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51842"],["title","Beyond Bedlam (#7)"],["body"," jet-skiing? There's more genuine excitement in ten minutes of it than an hour of rocket racing. Personally, I don't care if the Board does ban the rockets soon. I'll just hop out to the Rocky Mountains on rest days.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Conrad knew perfectly well that if he had made this assertion before asking Alberts for his wife, the man would have found some excuse to have her remain. All the faces present displayed the _aficionado's_ disdain for one who has just demonstrated he doesn't _belong_. What the straitjacket did they think they were--some ancient order of noblemen?  Conrad took Angela's yielding arm and led her serenely away before Alberts could think of anything to detain her.  On the way out of the lounge, she stroked his arm with frank admiration. \"I'm so glad you were agreeable. Honestly, Harold could talk rockets till I died.\"  Conrad bent and kissed her. \"Angela, I'm sorry, but this isn't going to be what you think. I have a ship to take off in just a few minutes.\"  She flared and dug into his arm now. \"Oh, Conrad Manz! You ... you made me believe....\"  He laughed and grabbed her wrists. \"Now, now. I'm neglecting you to _fly_ a rocket, not just to talk about them. I won't let you die.\"  At that she could not suppress her husky musical laugh. \"I found that out the last time you and I were together. Clara and I had a drink the other day at the Citizen's Club. I don't often use dirty language, but I told Clara she must be keeping you in a _straitjacket_ at home.\"  Conrad frowned, wishing she hadn't brought up the subject. It worried him off and on that something was wrong with Clara, something even worse than that awful _dreaming_ business ten days ago. For several shifts now she had been cold, nor was it just a temporary lack of interest in himself, for she was also cold to the men of their acquaintance of whom she was usually quite fond. As for himself, he had had to depend on casual contacts such as Angela. Not that they weren't pleasant, but a man and wife were supposed to maintain a healthy love life between themselves, and it usually meant trouble with the Medicorps when this broke down.  Angela glanced at him. \"I didn't think Clara laughed well at my remark. Is something wrong between you?\"  \"Oh, no,\" he declared hastily. \"Clara is sometimes that way ... doesn't catch a joke right off.\"  A page boy approached them where they stood in the rotunda and advised Conrad that his ship was ready.  \"Honestly, Angela, I'll make it up, I promise.\"  \"I know you will, darling. And at least I'm grateful you saved me from all those rocket jets in there.\" Angela raised her lips for a kiss and afterward, as she pushed him toward the door, her slightly vacant face smiled at him.         *       *       *       *       *  Out on the ramp, Conrad found another pilot ready to take off. They made two wagers--first to reach the racing course, and winner in a six-lap heat around the six-hundred-mile hexagonal course.  They fired together and Conrad blasted his ship up on a thunderous column of flame that squeezed him into his seat. He was good at this and he knew he would win the lift to the course. On the course, though, if his opponent was any good at all, Conrad would probably lose because he enjoyed slamming the ship around the course in his wasteful, swashbuckling style much more than merely winning the heat.  Conrad kept his drive on till the last possible second and then shot out his nose jets. The ship shuddered up through another hundred miles and came to a lolling halt near the starting buoys. The other pilot gasped when Conrad shouted at him over the intership, \"The winner by all thirty heads!\"  It was generally assumed that a race up to the course consisted of cutting all jets when you had enough lift, and using the nose brakes only to correct any over-shot. \"What did you do, just keep your power on and flip the ship around?\" The other racer coasted up to Conrad's level and steadied with a brief forward burst.  They got the automatic signal from the starting buoy and went for the first turn, nose and nose, about half a mile apart. Conrad lost 5000 yards on the first turn by shoving his power too hard against the starboard steering Jets.  It made a pretty picture when a racer hammered its way around a turn that way with a fan of outside jets holding it in place. The Other fellow made his turns cleanly, using mostly the driving jets for steering. But that didn't look like much to those who happened to flip on their television while this little heat was in progress. On every turn, Conrad lost a little in space, but not in the eye of the automatic televisor on the buoy marking the turn. As usual, he cut closer to the buoys than regulations allowed, to give the folks a show.  Without the slightest regret, Conrad lost the heat by a full two sides of the hexagon. He congratulated his opponent and watched the fellow let his ship down carefully toward earth on its tail jets. For a while Conrad lolled his ship around near the starting buoy and its probably watching eye, flipping through a series of complicated maneuvers with the steering jets.  Conrad did not like the grim countenance of outer space. The lifeless, gemlike blaze of cloud upon cloud of stars in the perspectiveless black repelled him. He liked rocket racing only because of the neat timing necessary, and possibly because the knowledge that he indulged in it scared poor old Bill Walden half to death.  Today the bleak aspect of the Galaxy harried his mind back upon its own problems. A particularly nasty association of Clara with Bill Walden and his sniveling kid kept dogging Conrad's mind and, as soon as stunting had exhausted his excess of fuel, he turned the ship to earth and sent it in with a short, spectacular burst.  Now that he stopped to consider it, Clara's strange behavior had begun at about the same time that Bill Walden started cheating on the shifts. That kid Mary must have known something was going on, or she would not have done such a disgusting thing as to come to their apartment.  Conrad had let the rocket fall nose-down, until now it was screaming into the upper ionosphere. With no time to spare, he swiveled the ship on its guiding jets and opened the drive blast at the up-rushing earth. He had just completed this wrenching maneuver when two appalling things happened together.  Conrad suddenly knew, whether as a momentary leak from Bill's mind to his, or as a rapid calculation of his own, that Bill Walden and Clara shared a secret. At the same moment, something tore through his mind like fingers of chill wind. With seven gravities mashing him into the bucket-seat, he grunted curses past thin-stretched lips.  \"Great blue psychiatrists! What in thirty straitjackets is that three-headed fool trying to do, kill us both?\"  Conrad just managed to raise his leaden hand and set the plummeting racer for automatic pilot before Bill Walden forced him out of the shift. In his last moment of consciousness, and in the shock of his overwhelming shame, Conrad felt the bitter irony that he could not cut the power and kill Bill Walden.         *       *       *       *       *  When Bill Walden became conscious of the thunderous clamor of the braking ship and the awful weight of deceleration into which he had shifted, the core of him froze. He was so terrified that he could not have thought of reshifting even had there been time.  His head rolled on the pad in spite of its weight, and he saw the earth coming at him like a monstrous swatter aimed at a fly. Between his fright and the inhuman gravity, he lost consciousness without ever seeing on the control panel the red warning that saved him: _Automatic Pilot_.  The ship settled itself on the ramp in a mushroom of fire. Bill regained awareness several seconds later. He was too shaken to do anything but sit there for a long time.  When at last he felt capable of moving, he struggled with the door till he found how to open it, and climbed down to the still-hot ramp he had landed on. It was at least a mile to the Rocket Club across the barren flat of the field, and he set out on foot. Shortly, however, a truck came speeding across to him.  The driver leaned out. \"Hey, Conrad, what's the matter? Why didn't you pull the ship over to the hangars?\"  With Conrad's makeup on, Bill felt he could probably get by. \"Controls aren't working,\" he offered noncommittally.  At the club, a place he had never been to before in his life, Bill found an unused helicopter and started it with his wristband. He flew the machine into town to the landing station nearest his home.  He was doomed, he knew. Conrad certainly would report him for this. He had not intended to force the shift so early or so violently. Perhaps he had not intended to force it at all this time. But there was something in him more powerful than himself ... a need to break the shift and be with Clara that now acted almost independently of him and certainly without regard for his safety.  Bill flew his craft carefully through the city traffic, working his way between the widely spaced towers with the uncertain hand of one to whom machines are not an extension of the body. He put the helicopter down at the landing station with some difficulty.  Clara would not be expecting him so early. From his apartment, as soon as he had changed makeup, he visiophoned her. It was strange how long and how carefully they needed to look at each other and how few words they could say.  Afterward, he seemed calmer and went about getting ready with more efficiency. But when he found himself addressing the package of Conrad's clothes to his home, he chuckled bitterly.  It was when he went back to drop the package in the mail chute that he noticed the storage room door ajar. He disposed of the package and went over to the door. Then he stood still, listening. He had to stop his own breathing to hear clearly.  Bill tightened himself and opened the door."]]]
