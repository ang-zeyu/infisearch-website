After drinking his fill, he hoisted his pack and set a southwest course into the desert.  For three days he trekked to the southwest; then on the fourth day he veered to due south, following an increasingly rich trace. The sun, eternally hidden, beat down on him, and the dead-white sky was like a roof of heated iron over his head. Morrison followed the traces, and something followed him.  On the sixth day, he sensed movement just out of the range of his vision. On the seventh day, he saw what was trailing him.         *       *       *       *       *  Venus's own brand of wolf, small, lean, with a yellow coat and long, grinning jaws, it was one of the few mammals that made its home in the Scorpion Desert. As Morrison watched, two more sandwolves appeared beside it.  He loosened the revolver in its holster. The wolves made no attempt to come closer. They had plenty of time.  Morrison kept on going, wishing he had brought a rifle with him. But that would have meant eight pounds more, which meant eight pounds less water.  As he was pitching camp at dusk the eighth day, he heard a crackling sound. He whirled around and located its source, about ten feet to his left and above his head. A little vortex had appeared, a tiny mouth in the air like a whirlpool in the sea. It spun, making the characteristic crackling sounds of 'porting.  \"Now who could be 'porting anything to me?\" Morrison asked, waiting while the whirlpool slowly widened.  Solidoporting from a base projector to a field target was a standard means of moving goods across the vast distances of Venus. Any inanimate object could be 'ported; animate beings couldn't because the process involved certain minor but distressing molecular changes in protoplasm. A few people had found this out the hard way when 'porting was first introduced.  Morrison waited. The aerial whirlpool became a mouth three feet in diameter. From the mouth stepped a chrome-plated robot carrying a large sack.  \"Oh, it's you,\" Morrison said.  \"Yes, sir,\" the robot said, now completely clear of the field. \"Williams 4 at your service with the Venus Mail.\"  It was a robot of medium height, thin-shanked and flat-footed, humanoid in appearance, amiable in disposition. For twenty-three years it had been Venus's entire postal service--sorter, deliverer, and dead storage. It had been built to last, and for twenty-three years the mails had always come through.  \"Here we are, Mr. Morrison,\" Williams 4 said. \"Only twice-a-month mail call in the desert, I'm sorry to say, but it comes promptly and that's a blessing. This is for you. And this. I think there's one more. Sandcar broke down, eh?\"  \"It sure did,\" Morrison said, taking his letters.  Williams 4 went on rummaging through its bag. Although it was a superbly efficient postman, the old robot was known as the worst gossip on three planets.  \"There's one more in here somewhere,\" Williams 4 said. \"Too bad about the sandcar. They just don't build 'em like they did in my youth. Take my advice, young man. Turn back if you still have the chance.\"  Morrison shook his head.  \"Foolish, downright foolish,\" the old robot said. \"Pity you don't have my perspective. Too many's the time I've come across you boys lying in the sand in the dried-out sack of your skin, or with your bones gnawed to splinters by the sandwolves and the filthy black kites. Twenty-three years I've been delivering mail to fine-looking young men like you, and each one thinking he's unique and different.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The robot's eyecells became distant with memory. \"But they _aren't_ different,\" Williams 4 said. \"They're as alike as robots off the assembly line--especially after the wolves get through with them. And then I have to send their letters and personal effects back to their loved ones on Earth.\"  \"I know,\" Morrison said. \"But some get through, don't they?\"  \"Sure they do,\" the robot said. \"I've seen men make one, two, three fortunes. And then die on the sands trying to make a fourth.\"  \"Not me,\" Morrison said. \"I just want one. Then I'm going to buy me an undersea farm on Earth.\"  The robot shuddered. \"I have a dread of salt water. But to each his own. Good luck, young man.\"  The robot looked Morrison over carefully--probably to see what he had in the way of personal effects--then climbed back into the aerial whirlpool. In a moment, it was gone. In another moment, the whirlpool had vanished.  Morrison sat down to read his mail. The first letter was from his jewel broker, Max Krandall. It told about the depression that had hit Venusborg, and hinted that Krandall might have to go into bankruptcy if some of his prospectors didn't strike something good.  The second letter was a statement from the Venus Telephone Company. Morrison owed two hundred and ten dollars and eight cents for two months' telephone service. Unless he remitted this sum at once, his telephone was liable to be turned off.  The last letter, all the way from Earth, was from Janie. It was filled with news about his cousins, aunts and uncles. She told him about the Atlantic farm sites she had looked over, and the wonderful little place she had found near Martinique in the Caribbean. She begged him to give up prospecting if it looked dangerous; they could find another way of financing the farm. She sent all her love and wished him a happy birthday in advance.  \"Birthday?\" Morrison asked himself. \"Let's see, today is July twenty-third. No, it's the twenty-fourth, and my birthday's August first. Thanks for remembering, Janie.\"  That night he dreamed of Earth and the blue expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. But toward dawn, when the heat of Venus became insistent, he found he was dreaming of mile upon mile of goldenstone, of grinning sandwolves, and of the Prospector's Special.         *       *       *       *       *  Rock gave way to sand as Morrison plowed his way across the bottom of a long-vanished lake. Then it was rock again, twisted and tortured into a thousand gaunt shapes. Reds, yellows and browns swam in front of his eyes. In all that desert, there wasn't one patch of green.  He continued his trek into the tumbled stone mazes of the interior desert, and the wolves trekked with him, keeping pace far out on either flank.  Morrison ignored them. He had enough on his mind just to negotiate the sheer cliffs and the fields of broken stone that blocked his way to the south.  By the eleventh day after leaving the sandcar, the traces were almost rich enough for panning. The sandwolves were tracking him still, and his water was almost gone. Another day's march would finish him.  Morrison thought for a moment, then unstrapped his telephone and dialed Public Utility in Venusborg.  The video screen showed a stern, severely dressed woman with iron-gray hair. \"Public Utility,\" she said. \"May we be of service?\"  \"Hi,\" Morrison said cheerfully. \"How's the weather in Venusborg?\"  \"Hot,\" the woman said. \"How's it out there?\"  \"I hadn't even noticed,\" Morrison said, grinning. \"Too busy counting my fortune.\"  \"You've found goldenstone?\" the woman asked, her expression becoming less severe.  \"Sure have,\" Morrison said. \"But don't pass the word around yet. I'm still staking my claim. I think I can use a refill on these.\"  Smiling easily, he held up his canteens. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes, if you showed enough confidence, Public Utility would fill you up without checking your account. True, it was embezzling, but this was no time for niceties.  \"I suppose your account is in order?\" asked the woman.  \"Of course,\" Morrison said, feeling his smile grow stiff. \"The name's Tom Morrison. You can just check--\"  \"Oh, I don't do that personally,\" the woman said. \"Hold that canteen steady. Here we go.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gripping the canteen in both hands, Morrison watched as the water, 'ported four thousand miles from Venusborg, appeared as a slender crystal stream above the mouth of his canteen. The stream entered the canteen, making a wonderful gurgling sound. Watching it, Morrison found his dry mouth actually was beginning to salivate.  Then the water stopped.  \"What's the matter?\" Morrison asked.  His video screen went blank. Then it cleared, and Morrison found himself staring into a man's narrow face. The man was seated in front of a large desk. The sign in front of him read _Milton P. Reade, Vice President, Accounts_.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Mr. Morrison,\" Reade said, \"your account is overdrawn. You have been obtaining water under false pretenses. That is a criminal offense.\"  \"I'm going to pay for the water,\" Morrison said.  \"When?\"  \"As soon as I get back to Venusborg.\"  \"With what,\" asked Mr. Reade, \"do you propose to pay?\"  \"With goldenstone,\" Morrison said. \"Look around here, Mr. Reade. The traces are rich! Richer than they were for the Kirk claim! I'll be hitting the outcroppings in another day--\"  \"That's what every prospector thinks,\" Mr. Reade said. \"Every prospector on Venus is only a day from goldenstone. And they all expect credit from Public Utility.\"  \"But in this case--\"  \"Public Utility,\" Mr. Reade continued inexorably, \"is not a philanthropic organization. Its charter specifically forbids the extension of credit. Venus is a frontier, Mr. Morrison, a _farflung_ frontier. Every manufactured article on Venus must be imported from Earth at outrageous cost. We do have our own water, but locating it, purifying it, then 'porting it is an expensive process. This company, like every other company on Venus, necessarily operates on a very narrow margin of profit, which is invariably plowed back into further expansion. That is why there can be no credit on Venus.\"  \"I know all that,\" Morrison said. \"But I'm telling you, I only need a day or two more--\"  \"Absolutely impossible. By the rules, we shouldn't even help you out now. The time to report bankruptcy was"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51768"],["title","Prospector's Special (#2)"],["body"," week ago, when your sandcar broke down. Your garage man reported, as required by law. But you didn't. We would be within our rights to leave you stranded. Do you understand that?\"  \"Yes, of course,\" Morrison said wearily.  \"However, the company has decided to stretch a point in your favor. If you turn back immediately, we will keep you supplied with water for the return trip.\"  \"I'm not turning back yet. I'm almost on the real stuff.\"  \"You must turn back! Be reasonable, Morrison! Where would we be if we let every prospector wander over the desert while we supplied his water? There'd be ten thousand men out there, and we'd be out of business inside of a year. I'm stretching the rules now. Turn back.\"  \"No,\" said Morrison.  \"You'd better think about it. If you don't turn back now, Public Utility takes no further responsibility for your water supply.\"  Morrison nodded. If he went on, he would stand a good chance of dying in the desert. But if he turned back, what then? He would be in Venusborg, penniless and in debt, looking for work in an overcrowded city. He'd sleep in a community shed and eat at a soup kitchen with the other prospectors who had turned back. And how would he be able to raise the fare back to Earth? When would he ever see Janie again?  \"I guess I'll keep on going,\" Morrison said.  \"Then Public Utility takes no further responsibility for you,\" Reade repeated, and hung up.  Morrison packed up his telephone, took a sip from his meager water supply, and went on.         *       *       *       *       *  The sandwolves loped along at each side, moving in closer. Overhead, a delta-winged kite found him. It balanced on the up-drafts for a day and a night, waiting for the wolves to finish him. Then a flock of small flying scorpions sighted the waiting kite. They drove the big creature upstairs into the cloud bank. For a day the flying reptiles waited. Then they in turn were driven off by a squadron of black kites.  The traces were very rich now, on the fifteenth day since he had left the sandcar. By rights, he should be walking over goldenstone. He should be surrounded by goldenstone. But still he hadn't found any.  Morrison sat down and shook his last canteen. It gave off no wet sound. He uncapped it and turned it up over his mouth. Two drops trickled down his parched throat.  It was about four days since he had talked to Public Utility. He must have used up the last of his water yesterday. Or had it been the day before?  He recapped the empty canteen and looked around at the heat-blasted landscape. Abruptly he pulled the telephone out of his pack and dialed Max Krandall in Venusborg.  Krandall's round, worried face swam into focus on the screen. \"Tommy,\" he said, \"you look like hell.\"  \"I'm all right,\" Morrison said. \"A little dried out, that's all. Max, I'm near goldenstone.\"  \"Are you sure?\" Krandall asked.  \"See for yourself,\" Morrison said, swinging the telephone around. \"Look at the stone formations! Do you see the red and purple markings over there?\"  \"Traces, all right,\" Krandall admitted dubiously.  \"There's rich stuff just beyond it,\" Morrison said. \"There has to be! Look, Max, I know you're short on money, but I'm going to ask you a favor. Send me a pint of water. Just a pint, so I can go on for another day or two. We can both get rich for the price of a pint of water.\"  \"I can't do it,\" Krandall said sadly.  \"You can't?\"  \"That's right. Tommy, I'd send you water even if there wasn't anything around you but sandstone and granite. Do you think I'd let you die of thirst if I could help it? But I can't do a thing. Take a look.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Krandall rotated his telephone. Morrison saw that the chairs, table, desk, filing cabinet and safe were gone from the office. All that was left in the room was the telephone.  \"I don't know why they haven't taken out the phone,\" Krandall said. \"I owe two months on my bill.\"  \"I do too,\" said Morrison.  \"I'm stripped,\" Krandall said. \"I haven't got a dime. Don't get me wrong, I'm not worried about myself. I can always eat at a soup kitchen. But I can't 'port you any water. Not you or Remstaater.\"  \"Jim Remstaater?\"  \"Yeah. He was following a trace up north past Forgotten River. His sandcar broke an axle last week and he wouldn't turn back. His water ran out yesterday.\"  \"I'd bail him out if I could,\" said Morrison.  \"And he'd bail you out if he could,\" Krandall said. \"But he can't and you can't and I can't. Tommy, you have only one hope.\"  \"What's that?\"  \"Find goldenstone. Not just traces, find the real thing worth real money. Then phone me. If you really have goldenstone, I'll bring in Wilkes from Tri-Planet Mining and get him to advance us some money. He'll probably want fifty per cent of the claim.\"  \"That's plain robbery!\"  \"No, it's just the high cost of credit on Venus,\" Krandall answered. \"Don't worry, there'll still be plenty left over. But you have to find goldenstone first.\"  \"OK,\" Morrison said. \"It should be around here somewhere. Max, what's today's date?\"  \"July thirty-first. Why?\"  \"Just wondering. I'll call you when I've found something.\"  After hanging up, Morrison sat on a little boulder and stared dully at the sand. July thirty-first. Tomorrow was his birthday. His family would be thinking about him. Aunt Bess in Pasadena, the twins in Laos, Uncle Ted in Durango. And Janie, of course, waiting for him in Tampa.  Morrison realized that tomorrow might be his last birthday unless he found goldenstone.  He got to his feet, strapped the telephone back in his pack beside the empty canteens, and set a course to the south.         *       *       *       *       *  He wasn't alone. The birds and beasts of the desert marched with him. Overhead, the silent black kites circled endlessly. The sandwolves crept closer on his flanks, their red tongues lolling out, waiting for the carcass to fall....  \"I'm not dead yet!\" Morrison shouted at them.  He drew his revolver and fired at the nearest wolf. At twenty feet, he missed. He went down on one knee, held the revolver tightly in both hands and fired again. The wolf yelped in pain. The pack immediately went for the wounded animal, and the kites swooped down for their share.  Morrison put the revolver back in its holster and went on. He could tell he was in a badly dehydrated state. The landscape jumped and danced in front of him, and his footing was unsure. He discarded the empty canteens, threw away everything but the testing kit, telephone and revolver. Either he was coming out of the desert in style or he wasn't coming out at all.  The traces continued to run rich. But still he came upon no sign of tangible wealth.  That evening he found a shallow cave set into the base of a cliff. He crawled inside and built a barricade of rocks across the entrance. Then he drew his revolver and leaned back against the far wall.  The sandwolves were outside, sniffing and snapping their jaws. Morrison propped himself up and got ready for an all-night vigil.  He didn't sleep, but he couldn't stay awake, either. Dreams and visions tormented him. He was back on Earth and Janie was saying to him, \"It's the tuna. Something must be wrong with their diet. Every last one of them is sick.\"  \"It's the darnedest thing,\" Morrison told her. \"Just as soon as you domesticate a fish, it turns into a prima donna.\"  \"Are you going to stand there philosophizing,\" Janie asked, \"while your fish are sick?\"  \"Call the vet.\"  \"I did. He's off at the Blake's place, taking care of their dairy whale.\"  \"All right, I'll go out and take a look.\" He slipped on his face mask. Grinning, he said, \"I don't even have time to dry off before I have to go out again.\"  His face and chest were wet.         *       *       *       *       *  Morrison opened his eyes. His face and chest _were_ wet--from perspiration. Staring at the partially blocked mouth of the cave, he could see green eyes, two, four, six, eight.  He fired at them, but they didn't retreat. He fired again, and his bullet richocheted off the cave wall, stinging him with stone splinters. With his next shots, he succeeded in winging one of the wolves. The pack withdrew.  That emptied the revolver. Morrison searched through his pockets and found five more cartridges. He carefully loaded the gun. Dawn couldn't be far away now.  And then he was dreaming again, this time of the Prospector's Special. He had heard about it in every little saloon that bordered the Scorpion. Bristly-bearded old prospectors told a hundred different stories about it, and the cynical bartenders chimed in with their versions. Kirk had it in '89, ordered up big and special just for him. Edmonson and Arsler received it in '93. That was certain. And other men had had it too, as they sat on their precious goldenstone claims. Or so people said.  But was it real? Was there such a thing as the Prospector's Special? Would he live to see that rainbow-hued wonder, tall as a church steeple, wide as a house, more precious than goldenstone itself?  Sure he would! Why, he could almost see it now....  Morrison shook himself awake. It was morning. Painfully, he crawled out of the cave to face the day.  He stumbled and crawled to the south, escorted closely by wolves, shaded by predatory flying things. His fingers scrabbled along rock and sand. The traces were rich, rich!  But where in all this desolation was the goldenstone?  Where? He was almost past caring. He drove his sunburned, dried-out body, stopping only to fire a single shot when the wolves came too close.  Four bullets left.  He had to fire again when the kites, growing impatient, started diving at his head. A lucky shot tore into the flock, downing two. It gave the wolves something to fight over. Morrison crawled on blindly.  And fell over the edge of a little cliff.  It wasn't a serious fall, but the revolver was knocked from his hand. Before he could find it, the wolves were on him. Only their greed saved Morrison. While they fought over him,"]]]
