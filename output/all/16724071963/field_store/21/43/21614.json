Barlow won unanimously.  \"You don't know how close you came to losing me,\" he said in his first official address to the joint Houses. \"I'm not the boy to haggle; either I get what I ask or I go elsewhere. The first thing I want is to see designs for a new palace for me--nothing _un_ostentatious, either--and your best painters and sculptors to start working on my portraits and statues. Meanwhile, I'll get my staff together.\"  He dismissed the Polar President and the Polar Congress, telling them that he'd let them know when the next meeting would be.  A week later, the program started with North America the first target.  Mrs. Garvy was resting after dinner before the ordeal of turning on the dishwasher. The TV, of course, was on and it said: \"Oooh!\"--long, shuddery and ecstatic, the cue for the _Parfum Assault Criminale_ spot commercial. \"Girls,\" said the announcer hoarsely, \"do you want your man? It's easy to get him--easy as a trip to Venus.\"  \"Huh?\" said Mrs. Garvy.  \"Wassamatter?\" snorted her husband, starting out of a doze.  \"Ja hear that?\"  \"Wha'?\"  \"He said 'easy like a trip to Venus.'\"  \"So?\"  \"Well, I thought ya couldn't get to Venus. I thought they just had that one rocket thing that crashed on the Moon.\"  \"Aah, women don't keep up with the news,\" said Garvy righteously, subsiding again.  \"Oh,\" said his wife uncertainly.  And the next day, on _Henry's Other Mistress_, there was a new character who had just breezed in: Buzz Rentshaw, Master Rocket Pilot of the Venus run. On _Henry's Other Mistress_, \"the broadcast drama about you and your neighbors, _folksy_ people, _ordinary_ people, _real_ people\"! Mrs. Garvy listened with amazement over a cooling cup of coffee as Buzz made hay of her hazy convictions.  MONA: Darling, it's so good to see you again!  BUZZ: You don't know how I've missed you on that dreary Venus run.  SOUND: _Venetian blind run down, key turned in door lock._  MONA: Was it _very_ dull, dearest?  BUZZ: Let's not talk about my humdrum job, darling. Let's talk about us.  SOUND: _Creaking bed._  Well, the program was back to normal at last. That evening Mrs. Garvy tried to ask again whether her husband was sure about those rockets, but he was dozing right through _Take It and Stick It_, so she watched the screen and forgot the puzzle.  She was still rocking with laughter at the gag line, \"Would you buy it for a quarter?\" when the commercial went on for the detergent powder she always faithfully loaded her dishwasher with on the first of every month.         *       *       *       *       *  The announcer displayed mountains of suds from a tiny piece of the stuff and coyly added: \"Of course, Cleano don't lay around for you to pick up like the soap root on Venus, but it's pretty cheap and it's almost pretty near just as good. So for us plain folks who ain't lucky enough to live up there on Venus, Cleano is the real cleaning stuff!\"  Then the chorus went into their \"Cleano-is-the-stuff\" jingle, but Mrs. Garvy didn't hear it. She was a stubborn woman, but it occurred to her that she was very sick indeed. She didn't want to worry her husband. The next day she quietly made an appointment with her family freud.  In the waiting room she picked up a fresh new copy of _Readers Pablum_ and put it down with a faint palpitation. The lead article, according to the table of contents on the cover, was titled \"The Most Memorable Venusian I Ever Met.\"  \"The freud will see you now,\" said the nurse, and Mrs. Garvy tottered into his office.  His traditional glasses and whiskers were reassuring. She choked out the ritual: \"Freud, forgive me, for I have neuroses.\"  He chanted the antiphonal: \"Tut, my dear girl, what seems to be the trouble?\"  \"I got like a hole in the head,\" she quavered. \"I seem to forget all kinds of things. Things like everybody seems to know and I don't.\"  \"Well, that happens to everybody occasionally, my dear. I suggest a vacation on Venus.\"  The freud stared, open-mouthed, at the empty chair. His nurse came in and demanded, \"Hey, you see how she scrammed? What was the matter with _her_?\"  He took off his glasses and whiskers meditatively. \"You can search me. I told her she should maybe try a vacation on Venus.\" A momentary bafflement came into his face and he dug through his desk drawers until he found a copy of the four-color, profusely illustrated journal of his profession. It had come that morning and he had lip-read it, though looking mostly at the pictures. He leafed through to the article _Advantages of the Planet Venus in Rest Cures_.  \"It's right there,\" he said.  The nurse looked. \"It sure is,\" she agreed. \"Why shouldn't it be?\"  \"The trouble with these here neurotics,\" decided the freud, \"is that they all the time got to fight reality. Show in the next twitch.\"  He put on his glasses and whiskers again and forgot Mrs. Garvy and her strange behavior.  \"Freud, forgive me, for I have neuroses.\"  \"Tut, my dear girl, what seems to be the trouble?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Like many cures of mental disorders, Mrs. Garvy's was achieved largely by self-treatment. She disciplined herself sternly out of the crazy notion that there had been only one rocket ship and that one a failure. She could join without wincing, eventually, in any conversation on the desirability of Venus as a place to retire, on its fabulous floral profusion. Finally she went to Venus.  All her friends were trying to book passage with the Evening Star Travel and Real Estate Corporation, but naturally the demand was crushing. She considered herself lucky to get a seat at last for the two-week summer cruise. The space ship took off from a place called Los Alamos, New Mexico. It looked just like all the spaceships on television and in the picture magazines, but was more comfortable than you would expect.  Mrs. Garvy was delighted with the fifty or so fellow-passengers assembled before takeoff. They were from all over the country and she had a distinct impression that they were on the brainy side. The captain, a tall, hawk-faced, impressive fellow named Ryan-Something or other, welcomed them aboard and trusted that their trip would be a memorable one. He regretted that there would be nothing to see because, \"due to the meteorite season,\" the ports would be dogged down. It was disappointing, yet reassuring that the line was taking no chances.  There was the expected momentary discomfort at takeoff and then two monotonous days of droning travel through space to be whiled away in the lounge at cards or craps. The landing was a routine bump and the voyagers were issued tablets to swallow to immunize them against any minor ailments. When the tablets took effect, the lock was opened and Venus was theirs.  It looked much like a tropical island on Earth, except for a blanket of cloud overhead. But it had a heady, other-worldly quality that was intoxicating and glamorous.  The ten days of the vacation were suffused with a hazy magic. The soap root, as advertised, was free and sudsy. The fruits, mostly tropical varieties transplanted from Earth, were delightful. The simple shelters provided by the travel company were more than adequate for the balmy days and nights.  It was with sincere regret that the voyagers filed again into the ship, and swallowed more tablets doled out to counteract and sterilize any Venus illnesses they might unwittingly communicate to Earth.         *       *       *       *       *  Vacationing was one thing. Power politics was another.  At the Pole, a small man was in a soundproof room, his face deathly pale and his body limp in a straight chair.  In the American Senate Chamber, Senator Hull-Mendoza (Synd., N. Cal.) was saying: \"Mr. President and gentlemen, I would be remiss in my duty as a legislature if'n I didn't bring to the attention of the au-gust body I see here a perilous situation which is fraught with peril. As is well known to members of this au-gust body, the perfection of space flight has brought with it a situation I can only describe as fraught with peril. Mr. President and gentlemen, now that swift American rockets now traverse the trackless void of space between this planet and our nearest planetarial neighbor in space--and, gentlemen, I refer to Venus, the star of dawn, the brightest jewel in fair Vulcan's diadome--now, I say, I want to inquire what steps are being taken to colonize Venus with a vanguard of patriotic citizens like those minutemen of yore.  \"Mr. President and gentlemen! There are in this world nations, envious nations--I do not name Mexico--who by fair means or foul may seek to wrest from Columbia's grasp the torch of freedom of space; nations whose low living standards and innate depravity give them an unfair advantage over the citizens of our fair republic.  \"This is my program: I suggest that a city of more than 100,000 population be selected by lot. The citizens of the fortunate city are to be awarded choice lands on Venus free and clear, to have and to hold and convey to their descendants. And the national government shall provide free transportation to Venus for these citizens. And this program shall continue, city by city, until there has been deposited on Venus a sufficient vanguard of citizens to protect our manifest rights in that planet.  \"Objections will be raised, for carping critics we have always with us. They will say there isn't enough steel. They will call it a cheap giveaway. I say there _is_ enough steel for _one_ city's population to be transferred to Venus, and that is all that is needed. For when the time comes for the second city to be transferred, the first, emptied city can be wrecked for the needed steel! And is it a giveaway? Yes! It is the most glorious giveaway in the history of mankind! Mr. President and gentlemen, there is no time to waste--Venus must be American!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Black-Kupperman,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51233"],["title","The Marching Morons (#6)"],["body","the Pole, opened his eyes and said feebly, \"The style was a little uneven. Do you think anybody'll notice?\"  \"You did fine, boy; just fine,\" Barlow reassured him.  Hull-Mendoza's bill became law.  Drafting machines at the South Pole were busy around the clock and the Pittsburgh steel mills spewed millions of plates into the Los Alamos spaceport of the Evening Star Travel and Real Estate Corporation. It was going to be Los Angeles, for logistic reasons, and the three most accomplished psycho-kineticists went to Washington and mingled in the crowd at the drawing to make certain that the Los Angeles capsule slithered into the fingers of the blind-folded Senator.  Los Angeles loved the idea and a forest of spaceships began to blossom in the desert. They weren't very good space ships, but they didn't have to be.  A team at the Pole worked at Barlow's direction on a mail setup. There would have to be letters to and from Venus to keep the slightest taint of suspicion from arising. Luckily Barlow remembered that the problem had been solved once before--by Hitler. Relatives of persons incinerated in the furnaces of Lublin or Majdanek continued to get cheery postal cards.         *       *       *       *       *  The Los Angeles flight went off on schedule, under tremendous press, newsreel and television coverage. The world cheered the gallant Angelenos who were setting off on their patriotic voyage to the land of milk and honey. The forest of spaceships thundered up, and up, and out of sight without untoward incident. Billions envied the Angelenos, cramped and on short rations though they were.  Wreckers from San Francisco, whose capsule came up second, moved immediately into the city of the angels for the scrap steel their own flight would require. Senator Hull-Mendoza's constituents could do no less.  The president of Mexico, hypnotically alarmed at this extension of _yanqui imperialismo_ beyond the stratosphere, launched his own Venus-colony program.  Across the water it was England versus Ireland, France versus Germany, China versus Russia, India versus Indonesia. Ancient hatreds grew into the flames that were rocket ships assailing the air by hundreds daily.      Dear Ed, how are you? Sam and I are fine and hope you are fine. Is     it nice up there like they say with food and close grone on trees?     I drove by Springfield yesterday and it sure looked funny all the     buildings down but of coarse it is worth it we have to keep the     greasers in their place. Do you have any truble with them on Venus?     Drop me a line some time. Your loving sister, Alma.      Dear Alma, I am fine and hope you are fine. It is a fine place here     fine climate and easy living. The doctor told me today that I seem     to be ten years younger. He thinks there is something in the air     here keeps people young. We do not have much trouble with the     greasers here they keep to theirselves it is just a question of us     outnumbering them and staking out the best places for the Americans.     In South Bay I know a nice little island that I have been saving     for you and Sam with lots of blanket trees and ham bushes. Hoping     to see you and Sam soon, your loving brother, Ed.  Sam and Alma were on their way shortly.  Poprob got a dividend in every nation after the emigration had passed the halfway mark. The lonesome stay-at-homes were unable to bear the melancholy of a low population density; their conditioning had been to swarms of their kin. After that point it was possible to foist off the crudest stripped-down accommodations on would-be emigrants; they didn't care.  Black-Kupperman did a final job on President Hull-Mendoza, the last job that genius of hypnotics would ever do on any moron, important or otherwise.  Hull-Mendoza, panic-stricken by his presidency over an emptying nation, joined his constituents. The _Independence_, aboard which traveled the national government of America, was the most elaborate of all the spaceships--bigger, more comfortable, with a lounge that was handsome, though cramped, and cloakrooms for Senators and Representatives. It went, however, to the same place as the others and Black-Kupperman killed himself, leaving a note that stated he \"couldn't live with my conscience.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The day after the American President departed, Barlow flew into a rage. Across his specially built desk were supposed to flow all Poprob high-level documents and this thing--this outrageous thing--called Poprob_term_ apparently had got into the executive stage before he had even had a glimpse of it!  He buzzed for Rogge-Smith, his statistician. Rogge-Smith seemed to be at the bottom of it. Poprobterm seemed to be about first and second and third derivatives, whatever they were. Barlow had a deep distrust of anything more complex than what he called an \"average.\"  While Rogge-Smith was still at the door, Barlow snapped, \"What's the meaning of this? Why haven't I been consulted? How far have you people got and why have you been working on something I haven't authorized?\"  \"Didn't want to bother you, Chief,\" said Rogge-Smith. \"It was really a technical matter, kind of a final cleanup. Want to come and see the work?\"  Mollified, Barlow followed his statistician down the corridor.  \"You still shouldn't have gone ahead without my okay,\" he grumbled. \"Where the hell would you people have been without me?\"  \"That's right, Chief. We couldn't have swung it ourselves; our minds just don't work that way. And all that stuff you knew from Hitler--it wouldn't have occurred to us. Like poor Black-Kupperman.\"  They were in a fair-sized machine shop at the end of a slight upward incline. It was cold. Rogge-Smith pushed a button that started a motor, and a flood of arctic light poured in as the roof parted slowly. It showed a small spaceship with the door open.         *       *       *       *       *  Barlow gaped as Rogge-Smith took him by the elbow and his other boys appeared: Swenson-Swenson, the engineer; Tsutsugimushi-Duncan, his propellants man; Kalb-French, advertising.  \"In you go, Chief,\" said Tsutsugimushi-Duncan. \"This is Poprobterm.\"  \"But I'm the world Dictator!\"  \"You bet, Chief. You'll be in history, all right--but this is necessary, I'm afraid.\"  The door was closed. Acceleration slammed Barlow cruelly to the metal floor. Something broke and warm, wet stuff, salty-tasting, ran from his mouth to his chin. Arctic sunlight through a port suddenly became a fierce lancet stabbing at his eyes; he was out of the atmosphere.  Lying twisted and broken under the acceleration, Barlow realized that some things had not changed, that Jack Ketch was never asked to dinner however many shillings you paid him to do your dirty work, that murder will out, that crime pays only temporarily.  The last thing he learned was that death is the end of pain."]]]
