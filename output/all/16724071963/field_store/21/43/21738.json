Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                     Who or what was the scoundrel that kept                these couriers from the swift completion                  of their handsomely appointed rondos?   On Tenthmonth 1, 2457 A.D., at exactly 9 A.M. Planetary Federation Time--but with a permissible error of a millionth of a second either way--in the fifth sublevel of NewNew York Robot Postal Station 68, Black Sorter gulped down ten thousand pieces of first-class mail.  This breakfast tidbit did not agree with the mail-sorting machine. It was as if a robust dog had been fed a large chunk of good red meat with a strychnine pill in it. Black Sorter's innards went _whirr-klunk_, a blue electric glow enveloped him, and he began to shake as if he might break loose from the concrete.  He desperately spat back over his shoulder a single envelope, gave a great _huff_ and blew out toward the sorting tubes a medium-size snowstorm consisting of the other nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine pieces of first-class mail chewed to confetti. Then, still convulsed, he snapped up a fresh ten thousand and proceeded to chomp and grind on them. Black Sorter was rugged.  The rejected envelope was tongued up by Red Subsorter, who growled deep in his throat, said a very bad word, and passed it to Yellow Rerouter, who passed it to Green Rerouter, who passed it to Brown Study, who passed it to Pink Wastebasket.  Unlike Black Sorter, Pink Wastebasket was very delicate, though highly intuitive--the machine equivalent of a White Russian countess. She was designed to scan in 3,137 codes, route special-delivery spacemail to interplanetary liners by messenger rocket, and distinguish 9s from upside-down 6s.  Pink Wastebasket haughtily inhaled the offending envelope and almost instantly turned a bright crimson and began to tremble. After a few minutes, small atomic flames started to flicker from her mid-section.  White Nursemaid Seven and Greasy Joe both received Pink Wastebasket's distress signal and got there as fast as their wheels would roll them, but the high-born machine's malady was beyond their simple skills of oilcan and electroshock.         *       *       *       *       *  They summoned other machine-tending-and-repairing machines, ones far more expert than themselves, but all were baffled. It was clear that Pink Wastebasket, who continued to tremble and flicker uncontrollably, was suffering from the equivalent of a major psychosis with severe psychosomatic symptoms. She spat a stream of filthy ions at Gray Psychiatrist, not recognizing her old friend.  Meanwhile, the paper blizzard from Black Sorter was piling up in great drifts between the dark pillars of the sublevel, and flurries had reached Pink Wastebasket's aristocratic area. An expedition of sturdy machines, headed by two hastily summoned snowplows, was dispatched to immobilize Black Sorter at all costs.  Pink Wastebasket, quivering like a demented hula dancer, was clearly approaching a crisis. Finally Gray Psychiatrist--after consulting with Green Surgeon, and even then with an irritated reluctance, as if he were calling in a witch-doctor--summoned a human being.  The human being walked respectfully around Pink Wastebasket several times and then gave her a nervous little poke with a rubber-handled probe.  Pink Wastebasket gently regurgitated her last snack, turned dead white, gave a last flicker and shake, and expired. Black Coroner recorded the immediate cause of death as tinkering by a human being.  The human being, a bald and scrawny one named Potshelter, picked up the envelope responsible for all the trouble, stared at it incredulously, opened it with trembling fingers, scanned the contents briefly, gave a great shriek and ran off at top speed, forgetting to hop on his perambulator, which followed him making anxious clucking noises.  The nearest human representative of the Solar Bureau of Investigation, a rather wooden-looking man named Krumbine, also bald, recognized Potshelter as soon as the latter burst gasping into his office, squeezing through the door while it was still dilating. The human beings whose work took them among the Top Brass, as the upper-echelon machines were sometimes referred to, formed a kind of human elite, just one big nervous family.  \"Sit down, Potshelter,\" the SBI Man said. \"Hold still a second so the chair can grab you. Hitch onto the hookah and choose a tranquilizer from the tray at your elbow. Whatever deviation you've uncovered can't be that much of a danger to the planets. I imagine that when you leave this office, the Solar Battle Fleet will still be orbiting peacefully around Luna.\"  \"I seriously doubt that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Potshelter gulped a large lavender pill and took a deep breath. \"Krumbine, a letter turned up in the first-class mail this morning.\"  \"Great Scott!\"  \"It is a letter from one person to another person.\"  \"Good Lord!\"  \"The flow of advertising has been seriously interfered with. At a modest estimate, three hundred million pieces of expensive first-class advertising have already been chewed to rags and I'm not sure the Steel Helms--God bless 'em!--have the trouble in hand yet.\"  \"Judas Priest!\"  \"Naturally the poor machines weren't able to cope with the letter. It was utterly outside their experience, beyond the furthest reach of their programming. It threw them into a terrible spasm. Pink Wastebasket is dead and at this very instant, if we're lucky, three police machines of the toughest blued steel are holding down Black Sorter and putting a muzzle on him.\"  \"Great Scott! It's incredible, Potshelter. And Pink Wastebasket dead? Take another tranquilizer, Potshelter, and hand over the tray.\"  Krumbine received it with trembling fingers, started to pick up a big pink pill but drew back his hand from it in sudden revulsion at its color and swallowed two blue oval ones instead. The man was obviously fighting to control himself.  He said unsteadily, \"I almost never take doubles, but this news you bring--Good Lord! I seem to recall a case where someone tried to send a sound-tape through the mails, but that was before my time. Incidentally, is there any possibility that this is a letter sent by one _group_ of persons to another group? A hive or a therapy group or a social club? That would be bad enough, of course, but--\"  \"No, just one single person sending to another.\" Potshelter's expression set in grimly solicitous lines. \"I can see you don't quite understand, Krumbine. This is not a sound-tape, but a letter written in letters. You know, letters, characters--like books.\"  \"Don't mention books in this office!\" Krumbine drew himself up angrily and then slumped back. \"Excuse me, Potshelter, but I find this very difficult to face squarely. Do I understand you to say that one person has tried to use the mails to send a printed sheet of some sort to another?\"  \"Worse than that. A written letter.\"  \"Written? I don't recognize the word.\"  \"It's a way of making characters, of forming visual equivalents of sound, without using electricity. The writer, as he's called, employs a black liquid and a pointed stick called a pen. I know about this because one hobby of mine is ancient means of communication.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Krumbine frowned and shook his head. \"Communication is a dangerous business, Potshelter, especially at the personal level. With you and me, it's all right, because we know what we're doing.\"  He picked up a third blue tranquilizer. \"But with most of the hive-folk, person-to-person communication is only a morbid form of advertising, a dangerous travesty of normal newscasting--catharsis without the analyst, recitation without the teacher--a perversion of promotion employed in betraying and subverting.\"  The frown deepened as he put the blue pill in his mouth and chewed it. \"But about this pen--do you mean the fellow glues the pointed stick to his tongue and then speaks, and the black liquid traces the vibrations on the paper? A primitive non-electrical oscilloscope? Sloppy but conceivable, and producing a record of sorts of the spoken word.\"  \"No, no, Krumbine.\" Potshelter nervously popped a square orange tablet into his mouth. \"It's a hand-written letter.\"  Krumbine watched him. \"I never mix tranquilizers,\" he boasted absently. \"Hand-written, eh? You mean that the message was imprinted on a hand? And the skin or the entire hand afterward detached and sent through the mails in the fashion of a Martian reproach? A grisly find indeed, Potshelter.\"  \"You still don't quite grasp it, Krumbine. The fingers of the hand move the stick that applies the ink, producing a crude imitation of the printed word.\"  \"Diabolical!\" Krumbine smashed his fist down on the desk so that the four phones and two-score microphones rattled. \"I tell you, Potshelter, the SBI is ready to cope with the subtlest modern deceptions, but when fiends search out and revive tricks from the pre-Atomic Cave Era, it's almost too much. But, Great Scott, I dally while the planets are in danger. What's the sender's code on this hellish letter?\"  \"No code,\" Potshelter said darkly, proferring the envelope. \"The return address is--hand-written.\"  Krumbine blanched as his eyes slowly traced the uneven lines in the upper left-hand corner:      _from_ Richard Rowe     215 West 10th St. (horizontal)     2837 Rocket Court (vertical)     Hive 37, NewNew York 319, N. Y.     Columbia, Terra  \"Ugh!\" Krumbine said, shivering. \"Those crawling characters, those letters, as you call them, those _things_ barely enough like print to be readable--they seem to be on the verge of awakening all sorts of horrid"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51530"],["title","The Last Letter (#1)"],["body","memories. I find myself thinking of fur-clad witch-doctors dipping long pointed sticks in bubbling black cauldrons. No wonder Pink Wastebasket couldn't take it, brave girl.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Firming himself behind his desk, he pushed a number of buttons and spoke long numbers and meaningful alphabetical syllables into several microphones. Banks of colored lights around the desk began to blink like a theatre marquee sending Morse Code, while phosphorescent arrows crawled purposefully across maps and space-charts and through three-dimensional street diagrams.  \"There!\" he said at last. \"The sender of the letter is being apprehended and will be brought directly here. We'll see what sort of man this Richard Rowe is--if we can assume he's human. Seven precautionary cordons are being drawn around his population station: three composed of machines, two of SBI agents, and two consisting of human and mechanical medical-combat teams. Same goes for the intended recipient of the letter. Meanwhile, a destroyer squadron of the Solar Fleet has been detached to orbit over NewNew York.\"  \"In case it becomes necessary to Z-Bomb?\" Potshelter asked grimly.  Krumbine nodded. \"With all those villains lurking just outside the Solar System in their invisible black ships, with planeticide in their hearts, we can't be too careful. One word transmitted from one spy to another and anything may happen. And we must bomb before they do, so as to contain our losses. Better one city destroyed than a traitor on the loose who may destroy many cities. One hundred years ago, three person-to-person postcards went through the mails--just three postcards, Potshelter!--and _pft_ went Schenectady, Hoboken, Cicero, and Walla Walla. Here, as long as you're mixing them, try one of these oval blues--I find them best for steady swallowing.\"  Bells jangled. Krumbine grabbed up two phones, holding one to each ear. Potshelter automatically picked up a third. The ringing continued. Krumbine started to wedge one of his phones under his chin, nodded sharply at Potshelter and then toward a cluster of microphones at the end of the table. Potshelter picked up a fourth phone from behind them. The ringing stopped.  The two men listened, looking doped, Krumbine with an eye fixed on the sweep second hand of the large wall clock. When it had made one revolution, he cradled his phones. Potshelter followed suit.  \"I do like the simplicity of the new on-the-hour Puffyloaf phono-commercial,\" the latter remarked thoughtfully. \"The Bread That's Lighter Than Air. Nice.\"  Krumbine nodded. \"I hear they've had to add mass to the leadfoil wrapping to keep the loaves from floating off the shelves. Fact.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He cleared his throat. \"Too bad we can't listen to more phono-commercials, but even when there isn't a crisis on the agenda, I find I have to budget my listening time. One minute per hour strikes a reasonable balance between duty and self-indulgence.\"  The nearest wall began to sing:      Mister J. Augustus Krumbine,     We all think you're fine, fine, fine, fine.     Now out of the skyey blue     Come some telegrams for you.  The wall opened to a small heart shape toward the center and a sheaf of pale yellow envelopes arced out and plopped on the middle of the desk. Krumbine started to leaf through them, scanning the little transparent windows.  \"Hm, Electronic Soap ... Better Homes and Landing Platforms ... Psycho-Blinkers ... Your Girl Next Door ... Poppy-Woppies ... Poopsy-Woopsies....\"  He started to open an envelope, then, after a quick look around and an apologetic smile at Potshelter, dumped them all on the disposal hopper, which gargled briefly.  \"After all, there _is_ a crisis this morning,\" he said in a defensive voice.  Potshelter nodded absently. \"I can remember back before personalized delivery and rhyming robots,\" he observed. \"But how I'd miss them now--so much more distingué than the hives with their non-personalized radio, TV and stereo advertising. For that matter, I believe there are some backward areas on Terra where the great advertising potential of telephones and telegrams hasn't been fully realized and they are still used in part for personal communication. Now me, I've never in my life sent or received a message except on my walky-talky.\" He patted his breast pocket.  Krumbine nodded, but he was a trifle shocked and inclined to revise his estimate of Potshelter's social status. Krumbine conducted his own social correspondence solely by telepathy. He shared with three other SBI officials a private telepath--a charming albino girl named Agnes.  \"Yes, and it's a very handsome walky-talky,\" he assured Potshelter a little falsely. \"Suits you. I like the upswept antenna.\" He drummed on the desk and swallowed another blue tranquilizer. \"Dammit, what's happened to those machines? They ought to have the two spies here by now. Did you notice that the second--the intended recipient of the letter, I mean--seems to be female? Another good Terran name, too, Jane Dough. Hive in Upper Manhattan.\" He began to tap the envelope sharply against the desk. \"Dammit, where _are_ they?\"  \"Excuse me,\" Potshelter said hesitantly, \"but I'm wondering why you haven't read the message inside the envelope.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Krumbine looked at him blankly. \"Great Scott, I assumed that at least _it_ was in some secret code, of course. Normally I'd have asked you to have Pink Wastebasket try her skill on it, but....\" His eyes widened and his voice sank. \"You don't mean to tell me that it's--\"  Potshelter nodded grimly. \"Hand-written, too. Yes.\"  Krumbine winced. \"I keep trying to forget that aspect of the case.\" He dug out the message with shaking fingers, fumbled it open and read:      _Dear Jane_,      _It must surprise you that I know your name, for our hives are     widely separated. Do you recall day before yesterday when your     guided tour of Grand Central Spaceport got stalled because the     aide blew a fuse? I was the young man with hair in the tour behind     yours. You were a little frightened and a groupmistress was     reassuring you. The machine spoke your name._      _Since then I have been unable to forget you. When I go to sleep,     I dream of your face looking up sadly at the mistress's kindly     photocells. I don't know how to get in touch with you, but my     grandfather has told me stories his grandfather told him that     his grandfather told him about young men writing what he calls     love-letters to young ladies. So I am writing you a love-letter._      _I work in a first-class advertising house and I will slip this     love-letter into an outgoing ten-thousand-pack and hope._      _Do not be frightened of me, Jane. I am no caveman except for my     hair. I am not insane. I am emotionally disturbed, but in a way     that no machine has ever described to me. I want only your     happiness._      _Sincerely_,      _Richard Rowe_  Krumbine slumped back in his chair, which braced itself manfully against him, and looked long and thoughtfully at Potshelter. \"Well, if that's a code, it's certainly a fiendishly subtle one. You'd think he was talking to his Girl Next Door.\"  Potshelter nodded wonderingly. \"I only read as far as where they were planning to blow up Grand Central Spaceport and all the guides in it.\"  \"Judas Priest, I think I have it!\" Krumbine shot up. \"It's a pilot advertisement--Boy Next Door or--that kind of thing--printed to look like hand-writtening, which would make all the difference. And the pilot copy got mailed by accident--which would mean there is no real Richard Rowe.\"  At that instant, the door dilated and two blue detective engines hustled a struggling young man into the office. He was slim, rather handsome, had a bushy head of hair that had somehow survived evolution and radioactive fallout, and across the chest and back of his paper singlet was neatly stamped: \"RICHARD ROWE.\"  When he saw the two men, he stopped struggling and straightened up. \"Excuse me, gentlemen,\" he said, \"but these police machines must have made a mistake. I've committed no crime.\"  Then his gaze fell on the hand-addressed envelope on Krumbine's desk and he turned pale.         *       *       *       *       *  Krumbine laughed harshly. \"No crime! No, not at all. Merely using the mails to communicate. Ha!\"  The young man shrank back. \"I'm sorry, sir.\"  \"Sorry, he says! Do you realize that your insane prank has resulted in the destruction of perhaps a half-billion pieces of first-class advertising?--in the strangulation of a postal station and the paralysis of Lower Manhattan?--in the mobilization of SBI reserves, the de-mothballing of two divisions of G. I. machines and the redeployment of the Solar Battle Fleet? Good Lord, boy, why did you do it?\"  Richard Rowe continued to shrink but he squared his shoulders. \"I'm sorry, sir, but I just had to. I just had to get in touch with Jane Dough.\"  \"A girl from another hive? A girl you'd merely gazed at because a guide happened to blow a fuse?\" Krumbine stood up, shaking an angry finger. \"Great Scott, boy, where was Your Girl Next Door?\"  Richard Rowe stared bravely at the finger, which made him look a trifle cross-eyed. \"She died, sir, both of them.\"  \"But there should be at least six.\"  \"I know, sir, but of the other four, two have been shipped to the Adirondacks on vacation and two recently got married and haven't been replaced.\"  Potshelter, a faraway look in his eyes, said softly, \"I think I'm beginning to understand--\"  But Krumbine thundered on at Richard Rowe with, \"Good Lord, I can see you've had your troubles, boy. It isn't often we have these shortages of Girls Next Door, so that temporarily a boy can't marry the Girl Next Door, as he always should. But, Judas Priest, why didn't you take your troubles to your psychiatrist, your groupmaster, your socializer, your Queen Mother?\"  \"My psychiatrist is being overhauled,"]]]
