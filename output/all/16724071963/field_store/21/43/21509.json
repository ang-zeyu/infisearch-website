In time people remarked that Ed Austin's metamorphosis was no harder to understand than that of his wife.  It was true. She had changed. The alteration reached to the very bone and marrow of her being. At first the general pity had wounded her, then it had offended, and finally angered her. That people should notice her affliction, particularly when she strove so desperately to hide it, seemed the height of insolence.  The management of Las Palmas was almost her only relief. Having sprung from a family of ranchers, the work came easy, and she grew to like it--as well as she could like anything with that ever-present pain in her breast. The property was so large that it gave ample excuse for avoiding the few visitors who came, and the range boss, Benito Gonzales, attended to most of the buying and selling. Callers gradually became rarer; friends dropped away almost entirely. Since Las Palmas employed no white help whatever, it became in time more Mexican than in the days of \"Old Ed\" Austin's ownership.  In such wise had Alaire fashioned her life, living meanwhile under a sort of truce with her husband.  But Las Palmas had prospered to admiration, and La Feria would have prospered equally had it not been for the armed unrest of the country across the border. No finer stock than the \"Box A\" was to be found anywhere. The old lean, long-horned cattle had been interbred with white-faced Herefords, and the sleek coats of their progeny were stretched over twice the former weight of beef. Alaire had even experimented with the Brahman strain, importing some huge, hump-backed bulls that set the neighborhood agog. People proclaimed they were sacred oxen and whispered that they were intended for some outlandish pagan rite--Alaire by this time had gained the reputation of being \"queer\"--while experienced stockmen declared the venture a woman's folly, affirming that buffaloes had never been crossed successfully with domestic cattle. It was rumored that one of these imported animals cost more than a whole herd of Mexican stock, and the ranchers speculated freely as to what \"Old Ed\" Austin would have said of such extravagance.  It was Blaze Jones, one of the few county residents granted access to Las Palmas, who first acquainted himself with the outcome of Alaire's experiment, and it was he who brought news of it to some visiting stock-buyers at Brownsville.  Blaze was addicted to rhetorical extravagance. His voice was loud; his fancy ran a splendid course.  \"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"you-all interest me with your talk about your prize Northern stock; but I claim that the bigger the state the bigger the cattle it raises. That's why old Texas beats the world.\"  \"But it doesn't,\" some one contradicted.  \"It don't, hey? My boy\"--Blaze jabbed a rigid finger into the speaker's ribs, as if he expected a ground-squirrel to scuttle forth--\"we've got steers in this valley that are damn near the size of the whole state of Rhode Island. If they keep on growin' I doubt if you could fatten one of 'em in Delaware without he'd bulge over into some neighboring commonwealth. It's the God's truth! I was up at Las Palmas last month--\"  \"Las Palmas!\" The name was enough to challenge the buyers' interest.  Blaze nodded. \"You-all think you know the stock business. You're all swollen up with cow-knowledge, now, ain't you?\" He eyed them from beneath his black eyebrows. \"Well, some of our people thought they did, too. They figured they'd inherited all there was to know about live stock, and they grew plumb arrogant over their wisdom. But--pshaw! They didn't know nothing. Miz Austin has bred in that Brayma strain and made steers so big they run four to the dozen. And here's the remarkable thing about 'em--they 'ain't got as many ticks as you gentlemen.\"  Some of the cattlemen were incredulous, but Blaze maintained his point with emphasis. \"It's true. They're a grave disappointment to every kind of parasite.\"  But Alaire had not confined her efforts to cattle; she had improved the breed of \"Box A\" horses, too, and hand in hand with this work she had carried on a series of agricultural experiments.  Las Palmas, so people used to say, lay too far up the river to be good farming-land; nevertheless, once the pumping-plant was in, certain parts of the ranch raised nine crops of alfalfa, and corn that stood above a rider's head.  There was no money in \"finished\" stock; the border was too far from market--that also had long been an accepted truism--yet this woman built silos which she filled with her own excess fodder in scientific proportions, and somehow or other she managed to ship fat beeves direct to the packing-houses and get big prices for them.  These were but a few of her many ventures. She had her hobbies, of course, but, oddly enough, most of them paid or promised to do so. For instance, she had started a grove of paper-shelled pecans, which was soon due to bear; the ranch house and its clump of palms was all but hidden by a forest of strange trees, which were reported to ripen everything from moth-balls to bicycle tires. Blaze Jones was perhaps responsible for this report, for Alaire had shown him several thousand eucalyptus saplings and some ornamental rubber-plants.  \"That Miz Austin is a money-makin' piece of furniture,\" he once told his daughter Paloma. \"I'm no mechanical adder--I count mostly on my fingers--but her and me calculated the profits on them eucher--what's-their-name trees?--and it gave me a splittin' headache. She'll be a drug queen, sure.\"  \"Why don't you follow her example?\" asked Paloma. \"We have plenty of land.\"  Blaze, in truth, was embarrassed by the size of his holdings, but he shook his head. \"No, I'm too old to go rampagin' after new gods. I 'ain't got the imagination to raise anything more complicated than a mortgage; but if I was younger, I'd organize myself up and do away with that Ed Austin. I'd sure help him to an untimely end, and then I'd marry them pecan-groves, and blooded herds, and drug-store orchards. She certainly is a heart-breakin' device, with her red hair and red lips and--\"  \"FATHER!\" Paloma was deeply shocked.  Complete isolation, of course, Alaire had found to be impossible, even though her ranch lay far from the traveled roads and her Mexican guards were not encouraging to visitors. Business inevitably brought her into contact with a considerable number of people, and of these the one she saw most frequently was Judge Ellsworth of Brownsville, her attorney.  It was perhaps a week after Ed had left for San Antonio that Alaire felt the need of Ellsworth's counsel, and sent for him. He responded promptly, as always. Ellsworth was a kindly man of fifty-five, with a forceful chin and a drooping, heavy-lidded eye that could either blaze or twinkle. He was fond of Alaire, and his sympathy, like his understanding, was of that wordless yet comprehensive kind which is most satisfying. Judge Ellsworth knew more than any four men in that part of Texas; information had a way of seeking him out, and his head was stored to repletion with facts of every variety. He was a good lawyer, too, and yet his knowledge of the law comprised but a small part of that mental wealth upon which he prided himself. He knew human nature, and that he considered far more important than law. His mind was like a full granary, and every grain lay where he could put his hand upon it.  He motored out from Brownsville, and, after ridding himself of dust, insisted upon spending the interval before dinner in an inspection of Alaire's latest ranch improvements. He had a fatherly way of walking with his arm about Alaire's shoulders, and although she sometimes suspected that his warmth of good-fellowship was merely a habit cultivated through political necessities, nevertheless it was comforting, and she took it at its face value.  Not until the dinner was over did Ellsworth inquire the reason for his summons.  \"It's about La Feria. General Longorio has confiscated my stock,\" Alaire told him.  Ellsworth started. \"Longorio! That's bad.\"  \"Yes. One of my riders just brought the news. I was afraid of this very thing, and so I was preparing to bring the stock over. Still--I never thought they'd actually confiscate it.\"  \"Why shouldn't they?\"  Alaire interrogated the speaker silently.  \"Hasn't Ed done enough to provoke confiscation?\" asked the Judge.  \"Ed?\"  \"Exactly! Ed has made a fool of himself, and brought this on.\"  \"You think so?\"  \"Well, I have it pretty straight that he's giving money to the Rebel junta and lending every assistance he can to their cause.\"  \"I didn't know he'd actually done anything. How mad!\"  \"Yes--for a man with interests in Federal territory. But Ed always does the wrong thing, you know.\"  \"Then I presume this confiscation is in the nature of a reprisal. But the stock is mine, not Ed's. I'm an American citizen, and--\"  \"My dear, you're the first one I've heard boast of the fact,\" cynically affirmed the Judge. \"If you were in Mexico you'd profit more by claiming allegiance to the German or the English or some other foreign flag. The American eagle isn't screaming very loudly on the other side of the Rio Grande just now, and our dusky neighbors have learned that it's perfectly safe to pull his tail feathers.\"  \"I'm surprised at you,\" Alaire smiled. \"Just the same, I want your help in taking up the matter with Washington.\"  Ellsworth was pessimistic. \"It won't do any good, my dear,\" he said. \"You'll get your name in the papers, and perhaps cause another diplomatically worded protest, but there the matter will end. You won't be paid for your cattle.\"  \"Then I shall go to La Feria.\"  \"No!\" The Judge shook his head decidedly.  \"I've been there a hundred times. The Federals have always been more than courteous.\"  \"Longorio has a bad reputation. I strongly advise against your going.\"  \"Why, Judge, people"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50998"],["title","Delay in Transit (#0)"],["body","IN TRANSIT                             By F.

But the horror              is the offer of help that cannot be accepted!   \"Muscles tense,\" said Dimanche. \"Neural index 1.76, unusually high. Adrenalin squirting through his system. In effect, he's stalking you. Intent: probably assault with a deadly weapon.\"  \"Not interested,\" said Cassal firmly, his subvocalization inaudible to anyone but Dimanche. \"I'm not the victim type. He was standing on the walkway near the brink of the thoroughfare. I'm going back to the habitat hotel and sit tight.\"  \"First you have to get there,\" Dimanche pointed out. \"I mean, is it safe for a stranger to walk through the city?\"  \"Now that you mention it, no,\" answered Cassal. He looked around apprehensively. \"Where is he?\"  \"Behind you. At the moment he's pretending interest in a merchandise display.\"  A native stamped by, eyes brown and incurious. Apparently he was accustomed to the sight of an Earthman standing alone, Adam's apple bobbing up and down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all travelers were crazy.  Cassal looked up. Not an air taxi in sight; Godolph shut down at dusk. It would be pure luck if he found a taxi before morning. Of course he _could_ walk back to the hotel, but was that such a good idea?  A Godolphian city was peculiar. And, though not intended, it was peculiarly suited to certain kinds of violence. A human pedestrian was at a definite disadvantage.  \"Correction,\" said Dimanche. \"Not simple assault. He has murder in mind.\"  \"It still doesn't appeal to me,\" said Cassal. Striving to look unconcerned, he strolled toward the building side of the walkway and stared into the interior of a small cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside, he might find safety for a time.  Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy enough to elude him in a normal city. On Godolph, nothing was normal. In an hour the streets would be brightly lighted--for native eyes. A human would consider it dim.  \"Why did he choose me?\" asked Cassal plaintively. \"There must be something he hopes to gain.\"  \"I'm working on it,\" said Dimanche. \"But remember, I have limitations. At short distances I can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological data. I can't read minds. The best I can do is report what a person says or subvocalizes. If you're really interested in finding out why he wants to kill you, I suggest you turn the problem over to the godawful police.\"  \"Godolph, not godawful,\" corrected Cassal absently.  That was advice he couldn't follow, good as it seemed. He could give the police no evidence save through Dimanche. There were various reasons, many of them involving the law, for leaving the device called Dimanche out of it. The police would act if they found a body. His own, say, floating face-down on some quiet street. That didn't seem the proper approach, either.  \"Weapons?\"  \"The first thing I searched him for. Nothing very dangerous. A long knife, a hard striking object. Both concealed on his person.\"  Cassal strangled slightly. Dimanche needed a good stiff course in semantics. A knife was still the most silent of weapons. A man could die from it. His hand strayed toward his pocket. He had a measure of protection himself.  \"Report,\" said Dimanche. \"Not necessarily final. Based, perhaps, on tenuous evidence.\"  \"Let's have it anyway.\"  \"His motivation is connected somehow with your being marooned here. For some reason you can't get off this planet.\"  That was startling information, though not strictly true. A thousand star systems were waiting for him, and a ship to take him to each one.  Of course, the one ship he wanted hadn't come in. Godolph was a transfer point for stars nearer the center of the Galaxy. When he had left Earth, he had known he would have to wait a few days here. He hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. Still, it wasn't unusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances were not as reliable as they might be.  Was this man, whoever and whatever he might be, connected with that delay? According to Dimanche, the man thought he was. He was self-deluded or did he have access to information that Cassal didn't?         *       *       *       *       *  Denton Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental survey of himself. He was a good engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched to his instrument, the best salesman that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the basis of these qualifications, he had been selected to make a long journey, the first part of which already lay behind him. He had to go to Tunney 21 to see a man. That man wasn't important to anyone save the company that employed him, and possibly not even to them.  The thug trailing him wouldn't be interested in Cassal himself, his mission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. And money wasn't the objective, if Dimanche's analysis was right. What _did_ the thug want?  Secrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And that was too well kept on Earth, where the instrument was invented and made, for anyone this far away to have learned about it.  And yet the thug wanted to kill him. Wanted to? Regarded him as good as dead. It might pay him to investigate the matter further, if it didn't involve too much risk.  \"Better start moving.\" That was Dimanche. \"He's getting suspicious.\"  Cassal went slowly along the narrow walkway that bordered each side of that boulevard, the transport tide. It was raining again. It usually was on Godolph, which was a weather-controlled planet where the natives like rain.  He adjusted the controls of the weak force field that repelled the rain. He widened the angle of the field until water slanted through it unhindered. He narrowed it around him until it approached visibility and the drops bounced away. He swore at the miserable climate and the near amphibians who created it.  A few hundred feet away, a Godolphian girl waded out of the transport tide and climbed to the walkway. It was this sort of thing that made life dangerous for a human--Venice revised, brought up to date in a faster-than-light age.  Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, infinitely flexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at break-neck speed, the ribbon of the transport tide flowed at different levels throughout the city. The Godolphian merely plunged in and was carried swiftly and noiselessly to his destination. Whereas a human--Cassal shivered. If he were found drowned, it would be considered an accident. No investigation would be made. The thug who was trailing him had certainly picked the right place.  The Godolphian girl passed. She wore a sleek brown fur, her own. Cassal was almost positive she muttered a polite \"Arf?\" as she sloshed by. What she meant by that, he didn't know and didn't intend to find out.  \"Follow her,\" instructed Dimanche. \"We've got to investigate our man at closer range.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Obediently, Cassal turned and began walking after the girl. Attractive in an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even from behind. Not graceful out of her element, though.  The would-be assassin was still looking at merchandise as Cassal retraced his steps. A man, or at least man type. A big fellow, physically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do with it. The face, though, was out of character. Mild, almost meek. A scientist or scholar. It didn't fit with murder.  \"Nothing,\" said Dimanche disgustedly. \"His mind froze when we got close. I could feel his shoulderblades twitching as we passed. Anticipated guilt, of course. Projecting to you the action he plans. That makes the knife definite.\"  Well beyond the window at which the thug watched and waited, Cassal stopped. Shakily he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter.  \"Excellent thinking,\" commended Dimanche. \"He won't attempt anything on this street. Too dangerous. Turn aside at the next deserted intersection and let him follow the glow of your cigarette.\"  The lighter flared in his hand. \"That's one way of finding out,\" said Cassal. \"But wouldn't I be a lot safer if I just concentrated on getting back to the hotel?\"  \"I'm curious. Turn here.\"  \"Go to hell,\" said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he came to that intersection, he turned there.  It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, oily slow-moving water gurgling at one side, high cavernous walls looming on the other.  He would have to adjust the curiosity factor of Dimanche. It was all very well to be interested in the man who trailed him, but there was also the problem of coming out of this adventure alive. Dimanche, an electronic instrument, naturally wouldn't consider that.  \"Easy,\" warned Dimanche. \"He's at the entrance to the alley, walking fast. He's surprised and pleased that you took this route.\"  \"I'm surprised, too,\" remarked Cassal. \"But I wouldn't say I'm pleased. Not just now.\"  \"Careful. Even subvocalized conversation is distracting.\" The mechanism concealed within his body was silent for an instant and then continued: \"His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. At a time like this, he may be ready to verbalize why he wants to murder you. This is critical.\"  \"That's no lie,\" agreed Cassal bitterly. The lighter was in his hand. He clutched it grimly. It was difficult not to look back. The darkness assumed an even more sinister quality.  \"Quiet,\" said Dimanche. \"He's verbalizing about you.\"  \"He's decided I'm a nice fellow after all. He's going to stop and ask me for a light.\"  \"I"]]]
