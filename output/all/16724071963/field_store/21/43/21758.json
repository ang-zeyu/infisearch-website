You were that little old man.\"  Beth rolled and sat up, her legs tangled in the robe. She took a deep breath. \"Listen, Ben. I got a kick out of changing into different kinds of people. It was a help in my work at the Actors' Lab. Then I got the idea it would be fun to try other things. Animals, chairs, tables. One rainy night I was a footstool until it was time to go to bed.\"  \"I was a tea kettle as a boy. Stop kidding.\"  \"I don't know, Ben. It gets sort of vacant all around when you're away somewhere. I had this feeling that I wanted to see if I could just step into a store or someplace and try to swipe something. Anything.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Pendleton found himself starting to shake. He put his arms around Beth. \"That was you, then, taking junk from an old Chinese.\"  \"I could change, you see, and take things as all sorts of odd characters. If I was spotted and followed, I'd try to duck in an alley or a doorway and change again. The clothes are extra. Sometimes I could hide clothes in a lot. Most of the time, though, I'd have to change into something new. A bird, a cat. Then I'd carry what I had stolen in my beak or around my neck.\" She laughed softly. \"Once I copped an umbrella and changed into a big dog and went off with it in my mouth.\" She twisted slightly in his arms. \"I'm sorry. It's all sort of odd and silly. I do it.\"  \"Well, why?\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"Beth?\" He inched up, lifting her with him.  \"Yes?\" She let him sit her in the sofa chair.  \"You have to go see somebody. You have to stop.\"  She stiffened. \"If it was as simple as insanity, I would.\"  \"Please, Beth.\" He wandered to the fireplace and threw in more wood.  \"The stealing _does_ bother me. I think the changing is good. I can use it to really go someplace in my acting career. Quit the secretary business altogether. I actually changed to an old woman for one of Alex's one-acters. He thought I'd just done a good job of makeup. I don't believe I want to simply stop, Ben.\"  \"You have to!\"  \"Don't start shouting commands.\"  Pendleton sat across from her on the sofa. \"Will you promise to start seeing somebody? Maybe I can find out about a good man. Promise you'll see him.\"  \"You going to ask around? Why don't you do a TV spot? 'We are happy to announce that Beth Gershwin is daffy.'\"  \"Relax, Beth. You decide what you want to do. I won't talk to anybody.\"  Beth moved to the window. The wind had died. \"I don't know, Ben.\"  \"Let it rest. Let's have the drink.\" He came to her side.  \"I think I'd like to be alone for a while.\"  \"I'd like to stay.\"  \"I'd like you to go. Please.\"  \"Beth.\"  \"Go on, Ben.\" She stared at him, then walked into her bedroom.  She didn't close the door and he followed.  Her robe was spread-eagled on the bed. Pendleton looked around the room. Before, there had been one carved stool at the vanity table. Now there were two.  Pendleton left the apartment and ran down the hall, taking short, shallow breaths. But he couldn't just leave her. He bit his lip and went back through the still open door.  \"Come on, Beth. Don't be stubborn,\" he said into the bedroom, watching the two stools.  He waited an hour. Then he turned off the lights and started to leave. Going out this time, he stepped on one of the wooden beads and almost fell onto the coffee table.  Pendleton slammed Beth's door and went out into the clear night. If she could be stubborn, so could he.         *       *       *       *       *  It was almost two weeks before she called him to apologize. She'd got him at the agency. He didn't stay in his apartment much. He kept talking to himself if he did.  You could see the street from the little Italian restaurant they'd agreed to meet in. Pendleton sat at a round table close to the wide window and watched for Beth. There was a slight haze in the afternoon air and most of the secretaries that passed were coatless.  Beth started smiling a quarter of a block from him. She was in a light cotton dress, weaving in and out of the noontime pedestrians.  \"Nice day,\" Pendleton said, standing.  Beth smiled and sat down. \"I noticed that right off.\"  They ordered and Pendleton said, \"How've you been?\"  \"Great.\" She clasped her hands together on the checkered table top. \"You were right, Ben. I'm sorry I was mean.\"  Pendleton moved his glass of water three inches. \"Good.\"  \"I've started seeing a very highly recommended analyst. Things are starting to look up. I haven't even had an impulse to filch anything in days.\"  The food arrived. \"It'll take time.\"  \"I have a great part in Alex's next play. It's really a challenge. By Ionesco. Being able to change will help.\"  Pendleton set his fork down. \"Huh?\"  \"I tried changing into the character last night. It came off fine.\"  \"What are you seeing a psychiatrist for, then?\" he asked, his voice low.  \"So I won't steal things any more.\"  He held the edge of the table for a minute, not meeting her eyes. Finally he said, \"I see. Well, that's fine, Beth. How've things been at work?\"  Beth grinned and told him.         *       *       *       *       *  The days were turning cool and the trees had started scattering dry leaves into the wind. On a sharp weekend afternoon Pendleton was killing time in the produce district before driving over to Beth's.  There was a coffee shop open and Pendleton thought about crossing over for a cup of coffee. The whitewashed door of the place shot open and a fat woman with an orange-fringed shawl came out. She was carrying something wrapped up in a paper napkin. She glanced at Pendleton, hesitated a second and then went running off toward a closed warehouse. By the time she reached it, the short-order cook was on the street looking after her. He threw a gesture after her and went back inside.  Pendleton shivered once slightly. He started walking for his car and a block from it he found himself running. He got to Beth's place ahead of the approaching dusk.  The downstairs door wasn't locked, but Beth's apartment door didn't open when he tried it. Pendleton grunted, slapping his pockets for something to pick the lock with.  The door opened. Beth, in capris and a striped sweater, looked out at him, her head tilted slightly to one side. \"Did I hear applause? You're early.\"  \"You know why I'm here early.\" He pushed into the room. \"I thought you were better. What the hell were you doing down there?\"  \"Where? What's the matter?\" She backed across the rug to the fireplace. A small fire was going and she turned to warm her hands at it.  \"I just saw you steal something from that diner. Silverware maybe. You want me to search the place?\"  Facing him, her lips hardly parted, Beth said, \"I should think you would trust me, being we love each other and all. I was rehearsing until a half hour ago and Alex dropped me off. I've been here since then.\"  Pendleton's hands fell to his sides. \"Well, nothing I guess is wrong. I'm just jumpy. This changing thing bothers me.\"  Beth reached out and patted his arm. \"It's okay, Ben?\"  \"Yeah.\" He sat down in the tan chair and looked up at her.  \"Want to eat here tonight, by the fire? I'll have the Flying Something deliver food.\"  \"Good. And send out for a bottle or two.\"  Beth bent and kissed him. \"Trust me again?\"  He brushed at her hair and nodded.         *       *       *       *       *  Pendleton dropped too much wood into the fireplace and a stick snapped out onto the rug. He gingerly picked up the stick and poked it back into the flames. He went back to the low sofa Beth was on. He found his glass in the dark and refilled it from the pitcher.  Beth reached out with one bare foot and stroked the side of his head. She had put on a dark blue dress with several stiff lace petticoats and whenever he tried to touch her she made crackling sounds.  \"You're really a nice fellow,\" Beth said, finding his ear with her toe.  \"So are you,\" he said, finishing his drink.  \"Maybe we should go ahead and get married.\"  Ben agreed and poured fresh drinks.  \"Ben?\"  \"Yeah?\"  \"I'm sorry.\" She was crying.  \"What is it?\"  \"It _was_ me this afternoon. I _have_ been doing those things. I never went to any highly recommended man at all.\"  Pendleton felt tolerant. \"So what? Things will work out somehow.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Beth sat up. \"I can't stop it, Ben.\"  Pendleton thought he heard an odd quaver in her voice. \"You're not onstage now, kid. Save the phony touches.\"  Her leg swung round, just missing his head, and she stood up. \"That's your trouble. You're totally incapable of comprehending.\"  \"I comprehend you. You're loony and a liar.\"  Beth slapped him. \"It'll be simpler if I stop being me!\"  Pendleton had somehow gotten his arm stuck under the sofa. \"Take it easy.\"  He was aware of a rustling sound and when he got loose and came up he saw Beth naked by the window for an instant. As he looked she changed. Then there were two tan sofa chairs in the room.  Pendleton called Beth's name over and over, but she wouldn't come back. It got cold in the apartment after a time and he threw all the wood he could find in the fire. He crawled over to the martini pitcher and drank from it. He noticed that some sticks had fallen out and landed in the tangle of petticoats Beth had left and he smiled at the disorder of everything and put his head back against the sofa.  Petticoats crackling woke him. Even before he got his head up very high in the room, he was coughing. The room was turning bright, sparkling orange.  \"Beth!\" he said. \"Beth!\"  There were still the two tan sofa chairs.  \"Beth, sober up now! Come on, change! We've got to get out!\"  Nothing happened. Pendleton looked at the chairs a moment. The one on the left. He grabbed it up and wavered to the apartment door. To make sure, he'd have to come up for the other one.  For several minutes it seemed the chair would stay wedged in the doorway. It came free finally"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51571"],["title","Subject to Change (#2)"],["body"," he went back with it and tumbled and twisted down the stairs.         *       *       *       *       *  A siren met him in the cold night outside. The engines were already there. The firemen were heading for the building.  Spray fell back across the street where Pendleton took the chair. \"Beth, please,\" he said in a low voice. \"Change now.\" He tried to go get the other chair, to be sure, but they wouldn't let him.  He fell into the one he'd picked and began crying softly. The sirens stopped. Before he let the ambulance people look at him, he insisted that the chair be looked after.  No trace of Beth was found and Pendleton couldn't explain what had happened. After they let him go, he had the chair sent to his apartment.  He put it very carefully in the living room by the liquor cabinet and sat down near it to wait."]]]
