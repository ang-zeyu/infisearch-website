You can live without skycars and rocket ships, you know.\"  \"Did you ever wonder what kind of weapons they might have?\"  \"The important thing,\" Eckert mused, \"is not if they have them, but if they'd use them. And I rather doubt that they would. We've been here for two weeks now and they've been very kind to us, seeing that we've had food and water and what fuel we need.\"  \"It's known in the livestock trade as being fattened up for the slaughter,\" Templeton said.  Eckert sighed and watched a fat bug waddle across a small patch of sunlight on the wooden floor. It was bad enough drawing an assignment in a totally foreign culture, even if the natives were humanoid. It complicated things beyond all measure when your partner in the project seemed likely to turn into a vendettist. It meant that Eckert would have to split his energies. He'd have to do what investigating he could among the Tunpeshans, and he'd have to watch Templin to see that he didn't go off half-cocked and spoil everything.  \"You're convinced that Pendleton was murdered, aren't you?\"  Templin nodded. \"Sure.\"  \"Why?\"  \"The Tunpeshans know why we're here. We've dropped enough hints along those lines. But nobody has mentioned Pendleton; nobody has volunteered any information about him. And he was an attache here for three years. Didn't anybody know him during that time? We've let slip a few discreet statements that we would like to talk to Pendleton's friends, yet nobody's come around. Apparently, in all the three years he was here, Pendleton didn't make any friends. And that's a little hard to believe. It's more likely that his friends have been silenced and any information about him is being withheld for a reason.\"  \"What reason?\"  Templin shrugged. \"Murder. What other reason could there be?\"  Eckert rolled up the thin, slatted blinds and stared out at the scenery. A hundred feet down the road, a native woman was going to market, leading a species of food animal by the halter.  \"They grow their women nice, don't they?\"  \"Physically perfect, like the men,\" Templin grumbled. \"You could get an inferiority complex just from watching the people here. Everybody's so damn perfect. Nobody's sick, nobody's unhealthy, nobody is too fat or too thin, nobody's unhappy. The only variation is that they don't all look alike. Perfection. It gets boring after a while.\"  \"Does it? I hadn't noticed.\" Eckert turned away from the blinds. His voice was crisp. \"I knew Don Pendleton quite well, too,\" he said. \"But it isn't blinding me to what I'm here for. We came to find out what happened to him, not to substantiate any preconceived notions. What we find out may be vitally important to anybody serving here in the future. I would hate to see our efforts spoiled because you've already made up your mind.\"  \"You knew Pendleton,\" Templin repeated grimly. \"Do you think it was suicide?\"  \"I don't think there's such a thing as a suicide type, when you come down to it. I'm not ruling out the possibility of murder, either. I'm trying to keep an open mind.\"  \"What have we accomplished so far? What have we found out?\"  \"We've got six months,\" Eckert said quietly. \"Six months in which we'll try to live here inconspicuously and study the people and try to cultivate informants. We would get nowhere if we came barging in asking all sorts of questions. And don't forget, Ray, we're all alone on Tunpesh. If it is a case of murder, what happens when the natives find out that we know it is?\"  Templin's eyes dueled for a moment. Then he turned his back and walked to the window. \"I suppose you're right,\" he said at last. \"It's nice living here, Ted. Maybe I've been fighting it. But I can't help thinking that Don must have liked it here, too.\"         *       *       *       *       *  One of the hardest things to learn in a foreign culture, Eckert thought, is when to enjoy yourself, when to work and when to worry.  \"_Pelache, menshar?_\"  \"_Sharra!_\" He took the small bowl of _pelache_ nuts, helped himself to a few, and passed the bowl on. This was definitely the time to enjoy himself, not to work or worry. He had heard about the _halera_ a few days ago, and, by judicious hinting to the proper authorities, he and Templin had been invited. It was a good chance to observe native customs. A little anthropology--with refreshments.  The main courses started making the rounds and he took generous helpings of the roasted _ulami_ and the broiled _halunch_ and numerous dabs from the side dishes of steaming vegetables. Between every course, they passed around a small flagon of the hot, spiced native wine, but he noticed that nobody drank to excess.  _The old Greek ideal_, he thought: _moderation in everything._  He looked at Templin, sitting across from him in the huge circle, and shrugged mentally. Templin looked as if he was about to break down and enjoy himself, but there was still a slight bulge under his tunic, where he had strapped his power pack. Any fool should have known that nothing would happen at a banquet like this. The only actual danger lay in Templin's getting excited and doing something he was bound to regret later on. And even that danger was not quite as likely now.  _There will be hell to pay_, Eckert thought, _if Templin ever finds out that I sabotaged his power pack._  \"You look thoughtful, _menshar_ Eckert.\"  Eckert took another sip of the wine and turned to the Tunpeshan on his left. He was a tall, muscular man with sharp eyes, a firm chin and a certain aura of authority.  \"I was wondering if my countryman Pendleton had offended your people in any way, Nayova.\" Now was as good a time as any to pump him for what he knew about Pendleton's death.  \"So far as I know, _menshar_ Pendleton offended no one. I do not know what duties he had to perform here, but he was a generous and courteous man.\"  Eckert gnawed the dainty meat off a slender _ulami_ bone and tried to appear casual in his questioning.  \"I am sure he was, Nayova. I am sure, too, that you were as kind to him as you have been to Templin and myself. My Government is grateful to you for that.\"  Nayova seemed pleased. \"We tried to do as well for _menshar_ Pendleton as we could. While he was here, he had the house that you have now and we saw that he was supplied with food and all other necessities.\"  Eckert had a sudden clammy feeling which quickly passed away. What Nayova had said was something he'd make sure Templin never heard about. He wiped his mouth on a broad, flat leaf that had been provided and took another sip of the wine.  \"We were shocked to find out that _menshar_ Pendleton had killed himself. We knew him quite well and we could not bring ourselves to believe he had done such a thing.\"  Nayova's gaze slid away from him. \"Perhaps it was the will of the Great One,\" he said vaguely. He didn't seem anxious to talk about it.  Eckert stared bleakly at his wine glass and tried to put the pieces of information together. They probably had a taboo about self-destruction which would make it difficult to talk about. That would make it even harder for him to find out by direct questioning.  A native fife trilled shrilly and a group of young men and women walked into the room. The circle broke to let them through and they came and knelt before Nayova. When he clapped his hands sharply, they retreated to the center of the circle and began the slow motions of a native dance.  The sound of the fife softened and died and the slow monotonous beat of drums took its place. The beat slowly increased and so did the rhythm of the dancers. The small fires at the corners of the hut were allowed to dwindle and the center of the circle became filled with the motions of shadows intermixed with the swift, sure movements of glistening limbs. Eckert felt his eyebrows crawl upward. Apparently the dance was the Tunpeshan version of the _rites de passage_. He glanced across the circle at Templin. Templin's face--what he could see of it by the flickering light--was brick red.  A voice spoke in his ear. \"It is hard for us to imagine anybody doing what _menshar_ Pendleton did. It is ...\" and he used a native word that Eckert translated as being roughly equivalent to \"_obscene_.\"  The dancers at the center of the circle finally bowed out with small garlands of flowers on their heads that signified their reaching adulthood. Acrobats then took the stage and went through a dizzying routine, and they in turn were succeeded by a native singer.  They were all excellent, Eckert thought. If anything, they were too good.  The bowl of _pelache_ nuts made its way around again and Nayova leaned over to speak to him. \"If there is any possibility that I can help you while you are here, _menshar_ Eckert, you have but to ask.\"  It would probably be a mistake to ask for a list of Pendleton's friends, but there was a way around that. \"I would like to meet any of your people who had dealings with Pendleton, either in business or socially. I will do everything not to inconvenience them in any way.\"  \"I think they would be glad to help you. I shall ask them to go to you this coming week.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It wasn't a driving rain, just a gentle drizzle that made the lanes muddy and plastered Eckert's tunic against him. He didn't mind it; the rain was warm and the trees and grass smelled good in the wet.  \"How would you classify the culture after seeing the ceremony, Ted?\" Templin asked.  \"About what you would expect. An Apollonian culture, simple and dignified. Nothing in excess, no striving for great emotional release.\"  Templin nodded soberly. \"It grows on you, doesn't it? You find yourself getting to like the place. And I suppose that's dangerous, too. You tend to let your guard down, the way Pendleton must have. You--what was that?\"  Eckert tensed. There was a gentle padding in the mud, several hundred feet behind them. Templin flattened himself in the shadows alongside a house. His hand darted inside his tunic and came out with the slim "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51170"],["title","The Fire and the Sword (#3)"],["body","of a needle gun.  \"Don't use it!\" Eckert whispered tersely.  Templin's eyes were thin, frightened slits in the darkness. \"Why not?\"  Eckert's mind raced. It might be nothing at all, and then again it might be disaster. But there was still a chance that Templin might be wrong. And there were more immediate reasons.  \"How many charges do you have for that?\"  \"Twelve.\"  \"You think you can stand there and hold them off with only twelve charges for your needle gun?\"  \"There's my power pack.\"  \"It's no good,\" Eckert said softly. \"The batteries in it are dead. I was afraid you might do something foolish with it.\"  The footsteps were only yards away. He listened intently, but it was hard to tell how many there were by the sound.  \"What do we do then?\"  \"See if they're following us first,\" Eckert said practically. \"They might not be, you know.\"  They slid out from the shadows and ducked down another lane between the houses. The footsteps behind them speeded up and came down the same lane.  \"We'll have to head back for our house,\" Eckert whispered.  They started running as quietly as they could, slipping and sliding in the mud. Another stretch past the shuttered, crouching houses and they found themselves in the square they had visited on the day they had landed. It was deserted, the looms and pottery wheels covered with cloth and reeds to keep off the rain. They darted across it, two thin shadows racing across the open plaza, and hurried down another path.  The last path led to the small river that cut through the city. Templin looked around, gestured to Eckert, waded into the water and crouched under the small bridge that spanned it. Eckert swore silently to himself, then followed Templin in.  The cold water swirled under his armpits and he bit his lips to keep himself from sneezing. Templin's emotions were contagious. Would he have worried about the footsteps? He frowned and tried to be honest with himself. Perhaps he would--and perhaps he wouldn't have. But he couldn't have let Templin stay there and face the unknown approachers. Not Templin.  Footsteps approached the bridge, hesitated a moment, then pattered on the wooden structure and faded off down the muddy path. Eckert let his breath out slowly. The footsteps were curiously light.  There was only one pair of them.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I would like to know something,\" Templin said coldly. He stripped off his power pack and let it fall to the floor of their house. \"Why did you decide to substitute dead batteries in the pack?\"  \"Because,\" Eckert said shortly, \"I was afraid you would do something with it that you might regret later. You're inexperienced in situations like this. Your reactions aren't to be trusted. One false move here and we could follow Pendleton, however he died. You know that.\" He wriggled out of his tunic and slowly peeled off his wet trousers.  There was a timid knock at the door. He wrapped a blanket about himself and motioned to Templin to stand to one side. Templin grabbed a small stool, hefted it in one hand, and complied.  Eckert went to the door and casually threw it open.  A girl stood there, half in the outer darkness and half in the yellowish light from the room, covered with mud to the knees and drenched to the skin.  \"The _menshar_ forgot this at the _halera_,\" she said softly. She quickly handed him his pipe and a soggy bag of tobacco, and disappeared instantly into the rain. He listened for the sound of her footsteps in the soft mud and then closed the door.  Templin put down the stool and stared stupidly at the pipe and the tobacco sack. Eckert placed them carefully on the table and began to towel himself.  \"We probably face as much danger from our own imaginations as from anything else,\" he said grimly. \"Tell me, would you have fired first, or would you have waited until you found out for sure who she was and what she wanted when she first started to follow us?\"  \"I don't know,\" Templin said sullenly.  \"Then I'll leave to your imagination the position we would be in now, if you had given in to your impulse.\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"We haven't found out much, have we?\" Templin demanded some days later.  \"No,\" Eckert admitted. \"We haven't.\"  He riffled through the thick stack of cards on the table. Statistically, the results were not only interesting but slightly phenomenal. During the three years or so that Pendleton had been on Tunpesh, he had met and known approximately seven hundred of the natives. By far the greater majority of these, of course, were purely casual and meant nothing. Almost a hundred, though, had had extended relations with Pendleton in business or social affairs. Of this hundred, none--not a single one--would admit that he had known Pendleton well or could be considered a friend of his. About all they had to say was that Pendleton had been healthy and easy to get along with, and one warm night he had shocked the community by going off and shooting himself.  \"Like Richard Cory,\" Eckert said aloud.  \"Like who?\" Templin asked.  \"Richard Cory. A character in a poem by a Twentieth Century poet, Edwin Arlington Robinson. Apparently he had everything to live for, but 'Richard Cory, one calm summer night, went home and put a bullet through his head.'\"  \"I'll have to look it up some day,\" Templin said. He pointed to the stack of cards. \"That's so much waste paper, isn't it?\"  \"Yes, it is,\" Eckert said reluctantly. \"To be frank, I had hoped we'd know a lot more by now. I still can't understand why we haven't dug up anybody who will admit having been his friend.\"  \"How do you know they're telling the truth? Or, for that matter, how do you know that the ones we've seen so far are the ones who _actually_ knew Pendleton?\"  Eckert drummed his fingers on the table. _You handle different human cultures for twenty-five years and you get to the point where you can tell if people are lying or not. Or do you? Maybe just an old man's conceit. Age alone never lent wisdom. Regardless of the personal reasons that Templin might have for thinking the Tunpeshans are lying, the fact remains that they very easily could be. And what should you do if they are?_  There was a polite knock at the door.  \"We've got another visitor,\" Templin said sarcastically. \"He probably saw Pendleton at a _halera_ four years ago and wants to be sure we know all about it.\"  The Tunpeshan looked faintly familiar to Eckert. There was something about the man's carriage....  \"I met you the day you landed,\" the Tunpeshan began, and Eckert remembered. Jathong, the guide who had shown them to the house.  \"You knew Pendleton?\"  Jathong nodded. \"I and a fellow weaver took over his small office after he had left it.\" Eckert recalled the small office in the square with the bolts of cloth on display, and the small mud brick on the window ledge with the incised lettering reading:      DONALD PENDLETON, SERVICE ATTACHE.  \"Why you didn't tell us this before?\"  \"I didn't know what kind and how much information you wanted.\"  _We didn't ask him_, Eckert thought, _so he didn't volunteer any information. Polite, to say the least._  \"How long did you know him?\"  \"Since he landed. I was the one appointed to him.\"  \"What do you mean--appointed to him?\"  \"To try to learn his language, and try to teach him ours.\"  Eckert felt his interest rising. Jathong, then, must have known Pendleton fairly well.  \"Did he have any enemies that you know of?\"  \"Enemies?\" Jathong seemed ignorant of the meaning of the word, so Eckert explained. \"No, he had no enemies. He would naturally have none such on Tunpesh.\"  Templin leaned forward, tense. \"If he had no enemies, why did he have no friends? You, for example, knew him longer and better than most. Why is it that you weren't his friend?\"  Jathong looked unhappy, as if being forced to say something he wanted not to say. \"Pendleton was _kava_--I cannot explain it. The concept is difficult. You would not understand.\"  He might be running the danger of throwing too many questions at Jathong, Eckert realized, and having him freeze up or turn vague. But it couldn't be helped. They had made no progress at all by subtlety, and time would eventually run out.  He tried to broach the next question delicately. \"Did Pendleton know any of the women of your race?\"  \"He knew some of the women, as he knew the men.\"  The answer didn't tell Eckert what he wanted to know. \"Was he in love with any woman?\" It sounded crude the way he put it, but it was hard to think of any other way of asking it.         *       *       *       *       *  Jathong looked at him incredulously, as if Eckert had asked him if Pendleton had had two heads.  \"That would have been impossible. None of our women would have--could have--been in love with _menshar_ Pendleton.\"  _One line of inquiry just gone phht_, Eckert thought. _But Pendleton wasn't one to let a broken heart get him down anyway._  \"Why not?\" Templin cut in harshly. \"He wasn't hard to look at and he would have made a good husband.\"  Jathong diplomatically turned around to face Templin. \"I have told you once--Pendleton was _kava_. It would have been quite impossible.\"  The answer to what had happened to Pendleton probably lay in Jathong's inability to explain his own terms, Eckert believed. One could get just so close, and then the definitions became vague and useless.  He asked a few more questions and finally dismissed Jathong. The interview, like all the others he and Templin had held during the last week, had been worthless. They knew nothing more than they had when they landed.  \"I still think they're lying,\" Templin said almost savagely. \"Or perhaps the ones who really know something haven't come around.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Eckert got his pipe and sat near the doorway, letting the sunlight streaming through the foliage of a nearby tree dapple his face with a checkerboard pattern of modulated lights and velvety shadows.  \"If they're evading us or if"]]]
