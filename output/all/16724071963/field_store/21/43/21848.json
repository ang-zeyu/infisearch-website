I hoped at first I had broken my neck, and was just congratulating myself upon the misfortune, when a witch-woman came along and rubbed some ointment upon my bruises, in spite of my protests.  To my great grief the pain left me, and I was soon well again.  But, as a slight compensation for my disappointment, my horse had run away; so I began my journey anew and on foot.  \"That afternoon I stepped into a nest of wasps, but the thoughtless creatures flew away without stinging me.  Then I met a fierce tiger, and my heart grew light and gay.  'Surely this will cause me suffering!' I cried, and advanced swiftly upon the brute.  But the cowardly tiger turned tail and ran to hide in the bushes, leaving me unhurt!  \"Of course, my many disappointments were some consolation; but not much.  That night I slept on the bare ground, and hoped I should catch a severe cold; but no such joy was to be mine.  \"Yet the next afternoon I experienced my first pleasure.  The thieves caught me, stripped off all my fine clothes and jewels and beat me well.  Then they carried me to their cave, dressed me in rags, and perched me on the top of the casks, where the slightest movement on my part would send me tumbling among the sword points.  This was really delightful, and I was quite happy until you came and released me.  \"I thought then that I might gain some pleasure by provoking you to anger; and our fight was the result.  That blow on the ear was exquisite, and by forcing me to become your servant you have made me, for the first time in my life, almost contented.  For I hope in your company to experience a great many griefs and disappointments.\"  As Nerle concluded his story Prince Marvel turned to him and grasped his hand.  \"Accept my sympathy!\" said he.  \"I know exactly how you feel, for my own life during the past few centuries has not been much different.\"  \"The past few centuries!\" gasped Nerle.  \"What do you mean?\"  At this the prince blushed, seeing he had nearly disclosed his secret. But he said, quickly:  \"Does it not seem centuries when one is unhappy?\"  \"It does, indeed!\" responded Nerle, earnestly.  \"But please tell me your story.\"  \"Not now,\" said Prince Marvel, with a smile.  \"It will please you to desire in vain to hear a tale I will not tell.  Yet I promise that on the day we part company I shall inform you who I am.\"    7.  The Gray Men  The adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving the cave of the reformed thieves, but their horses accidentally took the direction of the foot-hills that led into the wild interior Kingdom of Spor.  Therefore the travelers, when they had finished their conversation and begun to look about them, found themselves in a rugged, mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of Heg they had left behind.  Now, as I have before said, the most curious and fearful of the island people dwelt in this Kingdom of Spor.  They held no friendly communication with their neighbors, and only left their own mountains to plunder and rob; and so sullen and fierce were they on these occasions that every one took good care to keep out of their way until they had gone back home again.  There was much gossip about the unknown king of Spor, who had never yet been seen by any one except his subjects; and some thought he must be one of the huge giants of Spor; and others claimed he was a dwarf, like his tiny but ferocious dart-slingers; and still others imagined him one of the barbarian tribe, or a fellow to the terrible Gray Men.  But, of course, no one knew positively, and all these guesses were very wide of the mark.  The only certainty about this king was that his giants, dwarfs, barbarians and Gray Men meekly acknowledged his rule and obeyed his slightest wish; for though they might be terrible to others, their king was still more terrible to them.  Into this Kingdom of Spor Prince Marvel and Nerle had now penetrated and, neither knowing nor caring where they were, continued along the faintly defined paths the horses had found.  Presently, however, they were startled by a peal of shrill, elfish laughter, and raising their eyes they beheld a horrid-looking old man seated upon a high rock near by.  \"Why do you laugh?\" asked Prince Marvel, stopping his horse.  \"Have you been invited?  Tell me--have you been invited?\" demanded the old man, chuckling to himself as if much amused.  \"Invited where?\" inquired the prince.  \"To Spor, stupid!  To the Kingdom of Spor!  To the land of King Terribus!\" shrieked the old man, going into violent peals of laughter.  \"We go and come as we please,\" answered Prince Marvel, calmly.  \"Go--yes!  Go if you will.  But you'll never come back--never! never! never!\" The little old man seemed to consider this such a good joke that he bent nearly double with laughing, and so lost his balance and toppled off the rock, disappearing from their view; but they could hear him laugh long after they had passed on and left him far behind them.  \"A strange creature!\" exclaimed the prince thoughtfully.  \"But perhaps he speaks truth,\" answered Nerle, \"if, in fact, we have been rash enough to enter the Kingdom of Spor.  Even my father, the bravest baron in Heg, has never dared venture within the borders of Spor.  For all men fear its mysterious king.\"  \"In that case,\" replied Prince Marvel, \"it is time some one investigated this strange kingdom.  People have left King Terribus and his wild subjects too much to themselves; instead of stirring them up and making them behave themselves.\"  Nerle smiled at this speech.  \"They are the fiercest people on the Enchanted Island,\" said he, \"and there are thousands upon thousands who obey this unknown king.  But if you think we dare defy them I am willing to go on.  Perhaps our boldness will lead them into torturing me, or starving me to death; and at the very least I ought to find much trouble and privation in the Kingdom of Spor.\"  \"Time will determine that,\" said the prince, cheerfully.  They had now ridden into a narrow defile of the mountains, the pathway being lined with great fragments of rock.  Happening to look over his shoulder Prince Marvel saw that as they passed these rocks a man stepped from behind each fragment and followed after them, their numbers thus constantly increasing until hundreds were silently treading in the wake of the travelers.  These men were very peculiar in appearance, their skins being as gray as the rocks themselves, while their only clothing consisted of gray cloth tunics belted around the waists with bands of gray fox-hide. They bore no weapons except that each was armed with a fork, having three sharp tines six inches in length, which the Gray Men carried stuck through their fox-hide belts.  Nerle also looked back and saw the silent throng following them, and the sight sent such a cold shiver creeping up his spine that he smiled with pleasure.  There was no way to avoid the Gray Men, for the path was so narrow that the horsemen could not turn aside; but Prince Marvel was not disturbed, and seemed not to mind being followed, so long as no one hindered his advance.  He rode steadily on, Nerle following, and after climbing upward for a long way the path began to descend, presently leading them into a valley of wide extent, in the center of which stood an immense castle with tall domes that glittered as if covered with pure gold.  A broad roadway paved with white marble reached from the mountain pass to the entrance of this castle, and on each side of this roadway stood lines of monstrous giants, armed with huge axes thrust into their belts and thick oak clubs, studded with silver spikes, which were carried over their left shoulders.  The assembled giants were as silent as the Gray Men, and stood motionless while Prince Marvel and Nerle rode slowly up the marble roadway.  But all their brows were scowling terribly and their eyes were red and glaring--as if they were balls of fire.  \"I begin to feel very pleasant,\" said Nerle, \"for surely we shall not get away from these folks without a vast deal of trouble.  They do not seem to oppose our advance, but it is plain they will not allow us any chance of retreat.\"  \"We do not wish to retreat,\" declared the prince.  Nerle cast another glance behind, and saw that the Gray Men had halted at the edge of the valley, while the giants were closing up as soon as the horses passed them and now marched in close file in their rear.  \"It strikes me,\" he muttered, softly, \"that this is like to prove our last adventure.\" But although Prince Marvel might have heard the words he made no reply, being evidently engaged in deep thought.  As they drew nearer the castle it towered above them like a veritable mountain, so big and high was it; and the walls cast deep shadows far around, as if twilight had fallen.  They heard the loud blare of a trumpet sounding far up on the battlements; the portals of the castle suddenly opened wide, and they entered a vast courtyard paved with plates of gold.  Tiny dwarfs, so crooked that they resembled crabs, rushed forward and seized the bridles of the horses, while the strangers slowly dismounted and looked around them.  While the steeds were being led to the stables an old man, clothed in a flowing robe as white in color as his beard, bowed before Prince Marvel and said in a soft voice:  \"Follow me!\"  The prince stretched his arms, yawned as if tired with his ride, and then glared upon the old man with an expression of haughty surprise.  \"I follow no one!\" said he, proudly.  \"I am Prince Marvel, sirrah, and if the owner of this castle wishes to see me I shall receive him here, as befits my rank and station.\"  The man looked surprised, but only bowed lower than before.  \"It is the king's command,\" he answered.  \"The king?\"  \"Yes; you are in the castle of King Terribus, the lord and ruler of Spor.\"  \"That is different,\" remarked the prince, lightly.  \"Still, I will follow "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/518"],["title","The Enchanted Island of Yew (#6)"],["body","man.  Point out the way and I will go to meet his Majesty.\"  The old man extended a lean and trembling finger toward an archway. Prince Marvel strode forward, followed by Nerle, and passing under the arch he threw open a door at the far end and boldly entered the throne-room of King Terribus.    8.  The Fool-Killer  The room was round, with a dome at the top.  The bare walls were of gray stone, with square, open windows set full twenty feet from the floor.  Rough gray stone also composed the floor, and in the center of the room stood one great rock with a seat hollowed in its middle.  This was the throne, and round about it stood a swarm of men and women dressed in rich satins, velvets and brocades, brilliantly ornamented with gold and precious stones.  The men were of many shapes and sizes--giants and dwarfs being among them.  The women all seemed young and beautiful.  Prince Marvel cast but a passing glance at this assemblage, for his eye quickly sought the rude throne on which was seated King Terribus.  The personal appearance of this monster was doubtless the most hideous known in that age of the world.  His head was large and shaped like an egg; it was bright scarlet in color and no hair whatever grew upon it. It had three eyes--one in the center of his face, one on the top of his head and one in the back.  Thus he was always able to see in every direction at the same time.  His nose was shaped like an elephant's trunk, and swayed constantly from side to side.  His mouth was very wide and had no lips at all, two rows of sharp and white teeth being always plainly visible beneath the swaying nose.  King Terribus, although surrounded by so splendid a court, wore a simple robe of gray cloth, with no ornament or other finery, and his strange and fearful appearance was strongly contrasted with the glittering raiment of his courtiers and the beauty of his ladies in waiting.  When Prince Marvel, with Nerle marching close behind, entered the great room, Terribus looked at him sharply a moment, and then bowed.  And when he bowed the eye upon the top of his head also looked sharply at the intruders.  Then the king spoke, his voice sounding so sweet and agreeable that it almost shocked Nerle, who had expected to hear a roar like that from a wild beast.  \"Why are you here?\" asked Terribus.  \"Partly by chance and partly from curiosity,\" answered Prince Marvel. \"No one in this island, except your own people, had ever seen the king of Spor; so, finding myself in your country, I decided to come here and have a look at you.\"  The faces of the people who stood about the throne wore frightened looks at the unheard of boldness of this speech to their terrible monarch.  But the king merely nodded and inquired:  \"Since you have seen me, what do you think of me?\"  \"I am sorry you asked that question,\" returned the prince; \"for I must confess you are a very frightful-looking creature, and not at all agreeable to gaze upon.\"  \"Ha! you are honest, as well as frank,\" exclaimed the king.  \"But that is the reason I do not leave my kingdom, as you will readily understand.  And that is the reason I never permit strangers to come here, under penalty of death.  So long as no one knows the King of Spor is a monster people will not gossip about my looks, and I am very sensitive regarding my personal appearance.  You will perhaps understand that if I could have chosen I should have been born beautiful instead of ugly.\"  \"I certainly understand that.  And permit me to say I wish you were beautiful.  I shall probably dream of you for many nights,\" added the prince.  \"Not for many,\" said King Terribus, quietly.  \"By coming here you have chosen death, and the dead do not dream.\"  \"Why should I die?\" inquired Prince Marvel, curiously.  \"Because you have seen me.  Should I allow you to go away you would tell the world about my ugly face.  I do not like to kill you, believe me; but you must pay the penalty of your rashness--you and the man behind you.\"  Nerle smiled at this; but whether from pride at being called a man or in pleasurable anticipation of the sufferings to come I leave you to guess.  \"Will you allow me to object to being killed?\" asked the prince.  \"Certainly,\" answered the king, courteously.  \"I expect you to object. It is natural.  But it will do you no good.\"  Then Terribus turned to an attendant and commanded:  \"Send hither the Fool-Killer.\"  At this Prince Marvel laughed outright.  \"The Fool-Killer!\" he cried; \"surely your Majesty does me little credit.  Am I, then, a fool?\"  \"You entered my kingdom uninvited,\" retorted the king, \"and you tell me to my face I am ugly.  Moreover, you laugh when I condemn you to death. From this I conclude the Fool-Killer is the proper one to execute you. Behold!\"  Marvel turned quickly, to find a tall, stalwart man standing behind him.  His features were strong but very grave, and the prince caught a look of compassion in his eye as their gaze met.  His skin was fair and without blemish, a robe of silver cloth fell from his shoulders, and in his right hand he bore a gleaming sword.  \"Well met!\" cried Marvel, heartily, as he bowed to the Fool-Killer.  \"I have often heard your name mentioned, but 'tis said in the world that you are a laggard in your duty.\"  \"Had I my way,\" answered the Fool-Killer, \"my blade would always drip. It is my master, yonder, who thwarts my duty.\"  And he nodded toward King Terribus.  \"Then you should exercise your right on him, and cleave the ugly head from his shoulders,\" declared the prince.  \"Nay, unless I interfered with the Fool-Killer,\" said the king, \"I should soon have no subjects left to rule; for at one time or another they all deserve the blade.\"  \"Why, that may be true enough,\" replied Prince Marvel.  \"But I think, under such circumstances, your Fool-Killer is a needless servant.  So I will rid you of him in a few moments.\"  With that he whipped out his sword and stood calmly confronting the Fool-Killer, whose grave face never changed in expression as he advanced menacingly upon his intended victim.  The blades clashed together, and that of the Fool-Killer broke short off at the hilt.  He took a step backward, stumbled and fell prone upon the rocky floor, while Prince Marvel sprang forward and pressed the point of his sword against his opponent's breast.  \"Hold!\" cried the king, starting to his feet.  \"Would you slay my Fool-Killer?  Think of the harm you would do the world!\"  \"But he is laggard and unfaithful to his calling!\" answered the prince, sternly.  \"Nevertheless, if he remove but one fool a year he is a benefit to mankind,\" declared the king.  \"Release him, I pray you!\"  Then the victor withdrew his sword and stood aside, while the Fool-Killer slowly got upon his feet and bowed humbly before the king.  \"Go!\" shouted Terribus, his eye flashing angrily.  \"You have humiliated me before my enemy.  As an atonement see that you kill me a fool a day for sixty days.\"  Hearing this command, many of the people about the throne began to tremble; but the king paid no attention to their fears, and the Fool-Killer bowed again before his master and withdrew from the chamber.    9.  The Royal Dragon of Spor  \"Now,\" said Terribus, regarding the prince gloomily, \"I must dispose of you in another way.\"  For a moment he dropped his scarlet head in thought.  Then he turned fiercely upon his attendants.  \"Let the Wrestler come forward!\" he shouted, as loudly as his mild voice would carry.  Instantly a tall blackamoor advanced from the throng and cast off his flowing robe, showing a strong figure clad only in a silver loincloth.  \"Crack me this fellow's bones!\" commanded Terribus.  \"I beg your Majesty will not compel me to touch him,\" said Prince Marvel, with a slight shudder; \"for his skin is greasy, and will soil my hands.  Here, Nerle!\" he continued, turning to his esquire, \"dispose of this black man, and save me the trouble.\"  Nerle laughed pleasantly.  The black was a powerfully built man, and compared with Nerle and the prince, who had but the stature of boys, he towered like a very giant in size.  Nevertheless, Nerle did not hesitate to spring upon the Wrestler, who with a quick movement sent the boy crashing against the stone pavement.  Nerle was much bruised by the fall, and as he painfully raised himself to his feet a great lump was swelling behind his left ear, where his head had struck the floor, and he was so dizzy that the room seemed swimming around him in a circle.  But he gave a happy little laugh, and said to the prince, gratefully:  \"Thank you very much, my master!  The fall is hurting me delightfully. I almost feel as if I could cry, and that would be joy indeed!\"  \"Well,\" answered the prince, with a sigh, \"I see I must get my hands greased after all\"--for the black's body had really been greased to enable him to elude the grasp of his opponents.  But Marvel made a quick leap and seized the Wrestler firmly around the waist.  The next moment, to the astonishment of all, the black man flew swiftly into the air, plunged through one of the open windows high up in the wall, and disappeared from view.  When the king and his people again turned their wondering eyes upon the prince he was wiping his hands carefully upon a silk handkerchief.  At this sight a pretty young girl, who stood near the throne, laughed aloud, and the sound of her laughter made King Terribus very angry.  \"Come here!\" he commanded, sternly.  The girl stepped forward, her face now pale and frightened, while tear-drops trembled upon the lashes that fringed her downcast eyes.  \"You have dared to laugh at the humiliation of your king,\" said Terribus, his horrid face more crimson than ever, \"and as atonement I command that you drink of the poisoned cup.\"  Instantly a dwarf came near, bearing a beautiful golden goblet in his crooked hands.  \"Drink!\" he said, an evil leer upon his face.  The girl well knew this goblet contained a vile poison, one drop of which on her tongue would cause death; "]]]
