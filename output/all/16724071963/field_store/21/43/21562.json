Personally, he was in favor of the coming of the Earthmen to the world of Zur.  At the head of the long, shining table sat old Kalrab Masur, in his dotage, but still giving what he could of aid and comfort to the Pottery of Masur, even though nobody listened to him any more and he knew it. Around the table sat the six brothers--Koltan, eldest and Director of the Pottery; Morvan, his vice-chief; Singula, their treasurer; Thendro, sales manager; Lubiosa, export chief; and last in the rank of age, Zotul, who was responsible for affairs of design.  \"Behold, my sons,\" said Kalrab, stroking his scanty beard. \"What are these Earthmen to worry about? Remember the clay. It is our strength and our fortune. It is the muscle and bone of our trade. Earthmen may come and Earthmen may go, but clay goes on forever ... and with it, the fame and fortune of the House of Masur.\"  \"It _is_ a damned imposition,\" agreed Morvan, ignoring his father's philosophical attitude. \"They could have landed just as easily here in Lor.\"  \"The Thorabians will lick up the gravy,\" said Singula, whose mind ran rather to matters of financial aspect, \"and leave us the grease.\"  By this, he seemed to imply that the Thorabians would rob the Earthmen, which the Lorians would not. The truth was that all on Zur were panting to get their hands on that marvelous ship, which was all of metal, a very scarce commodity on Zur, worth billions of ken.         *       *       *       *       *  Lubiosa, who had interests in Thorabia, and many agents there, kept his own counsel. His people were active in the matter and that was enough for him. He would report when the time was ripe.  \"Doubtless,\" said Zotul unexpectedly, for the youngest at a conference was expected to keep his mouth shut and applaud the decisions of his elders, \"the Earthmen used all the metal on their planet in building that ship. We cannot possibly bilk them of it; it is their only means of transport.\"  Such frank expression of motive was unheard of, even in the secret conclave of conference. Only the speaker's youth could account for it. The speech drew scowls from the brothers and stern rebuke from Koltan.  \"When your opinion is wanted, we will ask you for it. Meantime, remember your position in the family.\"  Zotul bowed his head meekly, but he burned with resentment.  \"Listen to the boy,\" said the aged father. \"There is more wisdom in his head than in all the rest of you. Forget the Earthmen and think only of the clay.\"  Zotul did not appreciate his father's approval, for it only earned him a beating as soon as the old man went to bed. It was a common enough thing among the brothers Masur, as among everybody, to be frustrated in their desires. However, they had Zotul to take it out upon, and they did.  Still smarting, Zotul went back to his designing quarters and thought about the Earthmen. If it was impossible to hope for much in the way of metal from the Earthmen, what could one get from them? If he could figure this problem out, he might rise somewhat in the estimation of his brothers. That wouldn't take him out of the rank of scapegoat, of course, but the beatings might become fewer and less severe.         *       *       *       *       *  By and by, the Earthmen came to Lor, flying through the air in strange metal contraptions. They paraded through the tile-paved streets of the city, marveled here, as they had in Thorabia, at the buildings all of tile inside and out, and made a great show of themselves for all the people to see. Speeches were made through interpreters, who had much too quickly learned the tongue of the aliens; hence these left much to be desired in the way of clarity, though their sincerity was evident.  The Earthmen were going to do great things for the whole world of Zur. It required but the cooperation--an excellent word, that--of all Zurians, and many blessings would rain down from the skies. This, in effect, was what the Earthmen had to say. Zotul felt greatly cheered, for it refuted the attitude of his brothers without earning him a whaling for it.  There was also some talk going around about agreements made between the Earthmen and officials of the Lorian government, but you heard one thing one day and another the next. Accurate reporting, much less a newspaper, was unknown on Zur.  Finally, the Earthmen took off in their great, shining ship. Obviously, none had succeeded in chiseling them out of it, if, indeed, any had tried. The anti-Earthmen Faction--in any culture complex, there is always an \"anti\" faction to protest any movement of endeavor--crowed happily that the Earthmen were gone for good, and a good thing, too.  Such jubilation proved premature, however. One day, a fleet of ships arrived and after they had landed all over the planet, Zur was practically acrawl with Earthmen.  Immediately, the Earthmen established what they called \"corporations\"--Zurian trading companies under terrestrial control. The object of the visit was trade.  In spite of the fact that a terrestrial ship had landed at every Zurian city of major and minor importance, and all in a single day, it took some time for the news to spread.  The first awareness Zotul had was that, upon coming home from the pottery one evening, he found his wife Lania proudly brandishing an aluminum pot at him.  \"What is that thing?\" he asked curiously.  \"A pot. I bought it at the market.\"  \"Did you now? Well, take it back. Am I made of money that you spend my substance for some fool's product of precious metal? Take it back, I say!\"         *       *       *       *       *  The pretty young wife laughed at him. \"Up to your ears in clay, no wonder you hear nothing of news! The pot is very cheap. The Earthmen are selling them everywhere. They're much better than our old clay pots; they're light and easy to handle and they don't break when dropped.\"  \"What good is it?\" asked Zotul, interested. \"How will it hold heat, being so light?\"  \"The Earthmen don't cook as we do,\" she explained patiently. \"There is a paper with each pot that explains how it is used. And you will have to design a new ceramic stove for me to use the pots on.\"  \"Don't be idiotic! Do you suppose Koltan would agree to produce a new type of stove when the old has sold well for centuries? Besides, why do you need a whole new stove for one little pot?\"  \"A dozen pots. They come in sets and are cheaper that way. And Koltan will have to produce the new stove because all the housewives are buying these pots and there will be a big demand for it. The Earthman said so.\"  \"He did, did he? These pots are only a fad. You will soon enough go back to cooking with your old ones.\"  \"The Earthman took them in trade--one reason why the new ones are so cheap. There isn't a pot in the house but these metal ones, and you will have to design and produce a new stove if you expect me to use them.\"  After he had beaten his wife thoroughly for her foolishness, Zotul stamped off in a rage and designed a new ceramic stove, one that would accommodate the terrestrial pots very well.  And Koltan put the model into production.  \"Orders already are pouring in like mad,\" he said the next day. \"It was wise of you to foresee it and have the design ready. Already, I am sorry for thinking as I did about the Earthmen. They really intend to do well by us.\"  The kilns of the Pottery of Masur fired day and night to keep up with the demand for the new porcelain stoves. In three years, more than a million had been made and sold by the Masurs alone, not counting the hundreds of thousands of copies turned out by competitors in every land.         *       *       *       *       *  In the meantime, however, more things than pots came from Earth. One was a printing press, the like of which none on Zur had ever dreamed. This, for some unknown reason and much to the disgust of the Lorians, was set up in Thorabia. Books and magazines poured from it in a fantastic stream. The populace fervidly brushed up on its scanty reading ability and bought everything available, overcome by the novelty of it. Even Zotul bought a book--a primer in the Lorian language--and learned how to read and write. The remainder of the brothers Masur, on the other hand, preferred to remain in ignorance.  Moreover, the Earthmen brought miles of copper wire--more than enough in value to buy out the governorship of any country on Zur--and set up telegraph lines from country to country and continent to continent. Within five years of the first landing of the Earthmen, every major city on the globe had a printing press, a daily newspaper, and enjoyed the instantaneous transmission of news via telegraph. And the business of the House of Masur continued to look up.  \"As I have always said from the beginning,\" chortled Director Koltan, \"this coming of the Earthmen had been a great thing for us, and especially for the House of Masur.\"  \"You didn't think so at first,\" Zotul pointed out, and was immediately sorry, for Koltan turned and gave him a hiding, single-handed, for his unthinkable impertinence.  It would do no good, Zotul realized, to bring up the fact that their production of ceramic cooking pots had dropped off to about two per cent of its former volume. Of course, profits on the line of new stoves greatly overbalanced the loss, so that actually they were ahead; but their business was now"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51129"],["title","A Gift from Earth (#1)"],["body","upon the supply of the metal pots from Earth.  About this time, plastic utensils--dishes, cups, knives, forks--made their appearance on Zur. It became very stylish to eat with the newfangled paraphernalia ... and very cheap, too, because for everything they sold, the Earthmen always took the old ware in trade. What they did with the stuff had been hard to believe at first. They destroyed it, which proved how valueless it really was.  The result of the new flood was that in the following year, the sale of Masur ceramic table service dropped to less than a tenth.         *       *       *       *       *  Trembling with excitement at this news from their book-keeper, Koltan called an emergency meeting. He even routed old Kalrab out of his senile stupor for the occasion, on the off chance that the old man might still have a little wit left that could be helpful.  \"Note,\" Koltan announced in a shaky voice, \"that the Earthmen undermine our business,\" and he read off the figures.  \"Perhaps,\" said Zotul, \"it is a good thing also, as you said before, and will result in something even better for us.\"  Koltan frowned, and Zotul, in fear of another beating, instantly subsided.  \"They are replacing our high-quality ceramic ware with inferior terrestrial junk,\" Koltan went on bitterly. \"It is only the glamor that sells it, of course, but before the people get the shine out of their eyes, we can be ruined.\"  The brothers discussed the situation for an hour, and all the while Father Kalrab sat and pulled his scanty whiskers. Seeing that they got nowhere with their wrangle, he cleared his throat and spoke up.  \"My sons, you forget it is not the Earthmen themselves at the bottom of your trouble, but the _things_ of Earth. Think of the telegraph and the newspaper, how these spread news of every shipment from Earth. The merchandise of the Earthmen is put up for sale by means of these newspapers, which also are the property of the Earthmen. The people are intrigued by these advertisements, as they are called, and flock to buy. Now, if you would pull a tooth from the kwi that bites you, you might also have advertisements of your own.\"  Alas for that suggestion, no newspaper would accept advertising from the House of Masur; all available space was occupied by the advertisements of the Earthmen.  In their dozenth conference since that first and fateful one, the brothers Masur decided upon drastic steps. In the meantime, several things had happened. For one, old Kalrab had passed on to his immortal rest, but this made no real difference. For another, the Earthmen had procured legal authority to prospect the planet for metals, of which they found a good deal, but they told no one on Zur of this. What they did mention was the crude oil and natural gas they discovered in the underlayers of the planet's crust. Crews of Zurians, working under supervision of the Earthmen, laid pipelines from the gas and oil regions to every major and minor city on Zur.         *       *       *       *       *  By the time ten years had passed since the landing of the first terrestrial ship, the Earthmen were conducting a brisk business in gas-fired ranges, furnaces and heaters ... and the Masur stove business was gone. Moreover, the Earthmen sold the Zurians their own natural gas at a nice profit and everybody was happy with the situation except the brothers Masur.  The drastic steps of the brothers applied, therefore, to making an energetic protest to the governor of Lor.  At one edge of the city, an area had been turned over to the Earthmen for a spaceport, and the great terrestrial spaceships came to it and departed from it at regular intervals. As the heirs of the House of Masur walked by on their way to see the governor, Zotul observed that much new building was taking place and wondered what it was.  \"Some new devilment of the Earthmen, you can be sure,\" said Koltan blackly.  In fact, the Earthmen were building an assembly plant for radio receiving sets. The ship now standing on its fins upon the apron was loaded with printed circuits, resistors, variable condensers and other radio parts. This was Earth's first step toward flooding Zur with the natural follow-up in its campaign of advertising--radio programs--with commercials.  Happily for the brothers, they did not understand this at the time or they would surely have gone back to be buried in their own clay.  \"I think,\" the governor told them, \"that you gentlemen have not paused to consider the affair from all angles. You must learn to be modern--keep up with the times! We heads of government on Zur are doing all in our power to aid the Earthmen and facilitate their bringing a great, new culture that can only benefit us. See how Zur has changed in ten short years! Imagine the world of tomorrow! Why, do you know they are even bringing _autos_ to Zur!\"  The brothers were fascinated with the governor's description of these hitherto unheard-of vehicles.  \"It only remains,\" concluded the governor, \"to build highways, and the Earthmen are taking care of that.\"  At any rate, the brothers Masur were still able to console themselves that they had their tile business. Tile served well enough for houses and street surfacing; what better material could be devised for the new highways the governor spoke of? There was a lot of money to be made yet.         *       *       *       *       *  Radio stations went up all over Zur and began broadcasting. The people bought receiving sets like mad. The automobiles arrived and highways were constructed.  The last hope of the brothers was dashed. The Earthmen set up plants and began to manufacture Portland cement.  You could build a house of concrete much cheaper than with tile. Of course, since wood was scarce on Zur, it was no competition for either tile or concrete. Concrete floors were smoother, too, and the stuff made far better road surfacing.  The demand for Masur tile hit rock bottom.  The next time the brothers went to see the governor, he said, \"I cannot handle such complaints as yours. I must refer you to the Merchandising Council.\"  \"What is that?\" asked Koltan.  \"It is an Earthman association that deals with complaints such as yours. In the matter of material progress, we must expect some strain in the fabric of our culture. Machinery has been set up to deal with it. Here is their address; go air your troubles to them.\"  The business of a formal complaint was turned over by the brothers to Zotul. It took three weeks for the Earthmen to get around to calling him in, as a representative of the Pottery of Masur, for an interview.  All the brothers could no longer be spared from the plant, even for the purpose of pressing a complaint. Their days of idle wealth over, they had to get in and work with the clay with the rest of the help.  Zotul found the headquarters of the Merchandising Council as indicated on their message. He had not been this way in some time, but was not surprised to find that a number of old buildings had been torn down to make room for the concrete Council House and a roomy parking lot, paved with something called \"blacktop\" and jammed with an array of glittering new automobiles.  An automobile was an expense none of the brothers could afford, now that they barely eked a living from the pottery. Still, Zotul ached with desire at sight of so many shiny cars. Only a few had them and they were the envied ones of Zur.  Kent Broderick, the Earthman in charge of the Council, shook hands jovially with Zotul. That alien custom conformed with, Zotul took a better look at his host. Broderick was an affable, smiling individual with genial laugh wrinkles at his eyes. A man of middle age, dressed in the baggy costume of Zur, he looked almost like a Zurian, except for an indefinite sense of alienness about him.  \"Glad to have you call on us, Mr. Masur,\" boomed the Earthman, clapping Zotul on the back. \"Just tell us your troubles and we'll have you straightened out in no time.\"         *       *       *       *       *  All the chill recriminations and arguments Zotul had stored for this occasion were dissipated in the warmth of the Earthman's manner.  Almost apologetically, Zotul told of the encroachment that had been made upon the business of the Pottery of Masur.  \"Once,\" he said formally, \"the Masur fortune was the greatest in the world of Zur. That was before my father, the famous Kalrab Masur--Divinity protect him--departed this life to collect his greater reward. He often told us, my father did, that the clay is the flesh and bones of our culture and our fortune. Now it has been shown how prone is the flesh to corruption and how feeble the bones. We are ruined, and all because of new things coming from Earth.\"  Broderick stroked his shaven chin and looked sad. \"Why didn't you come to me sooner? This would never have happened. But now that it has, we're going to do right by you. That is the policy of Earth--always to do right by the customer.\"  \"Divinity witness,\" Zorin said, \"that we ask only compensation for damages.\"  Broderick shook his head. \"It is not possible to replace an immense fortune at this late date. As I said, you should have reported your trouble sooner. However, we can give you an opportunity to rebuild. Do you own an automobile?\"  \"No.\"  \"A gas range? A gas-fired furnace? A radio?\"  Zotul had to answer no to all except the radio. \"My wife Lania likes the music,\" he explained. \"I cannot afford the other things.\"  Broderick clucked sympathetically. One who could not afford the bargain-priced merchandise of Earth must be poor indeed.  \"To begin with,\" he said, \"I am going to make you a gift of all these luxuries you do not have.\" As Zotul made to protest, he cut him off with a wave of his hand. \"It is the least we can do for you. Pick a car from the lot outside. I will arrange to have the other things delivered and installed in your home.\"  \"To receive gifts,\" said Zotul, \"incurs an obligation.\"  \"None at all,\" beamed the"]]]
