Now, Belsir, please, I've got to finish packing. It'll be just my luck to have today be the day the bus to Zrig's on time.\"  \"A couple of weeks ago I was in Zrig shopping and I saw an Earthman,\" she said, folding his cloak into the kit. \"The way he walked, the way he moved, reminded me a little of you.\"  It was a long moment before he could speak. \"Do I look to you like a dark-faced, dark-haired, brown-eyed--\"  \"I didn't _say_ you were an Earthman! But if Earthmen can travel through the sky, they might be able to do other things, too; maybe even change the way a man looks.\"  He snapped the kit-fastener. \"If you really believe that, you should be careful. Creatures as clever as that might be able to pluck your words from my brain.\"  \"What if they did? I'm not ashamed. Or afraid, either.\"  He reached out and patted her arm. Maybe she wasn't afraid, but he was. For her. And for the people of Damorlan. If there was a deep-probe on the staff ship.... If only something could happen to him, so he could never reach Barshwat ... Spano wouldn't know. He might guess, but he wouldn't know. He'd have to start all over again--and maybe things would turn out better next time.         *       *       *       *       *  General Spano and his secretary were waiting in Blynn's office. Clarey stretched out his foot in greeting, then recollected himself and reached out his hand. \"You see, sir,\" he said with a too-hearty laugh, \"I'm really living my part.\"  Spano beamed. \"Damorlan certainly seems to agree with you, my boy. You look positively blooming. Doesn't he, Han?\"  She nodded grave agreement.  The general sniffed. \"What's that you two are smoking?\"  \"Marac leaves,\" Clarey said. \"A native product. Care to try one?\" He extended his pouch to Spano.  \"Don't mind if I do,\" the general said, taking a roll. \"Which part do you light? And why don't you offer one to Secretary Vollard?\"  \"Oh, sorry; I didn't think of it. The women here don't use it. Care to try one, Secretary?\" As she took a roll, she looked at him searchingly. She was still beautiful in an Amazonian way, but he preferred Embelsira's way. He could never imagine Han Vollard warm and tender.  \"Well, Clarey,\" Spano said, \"you seem to be doing a splendid job. I've been absolutely enthralled by your reports.\" He settled himself behind Blynn's desk. \"Pity the information's top secret. It could make a fortune on the tri-dis.\"  Clarey bowed.  \"And those musictapes you sent back created quite a stir. We've brought along some superior equipment. The rig here is good enough for routine work, but we need better fidelity for this. And it would be appreciated if the colonel didn't beat time with his foot while you played--no offense, Blynn.\"  He turned back to Clarey. \"Do you think you can pick up some of those what-do-you-call-'ems--ulerins--for us, too, or is there a tabu of some kind?\"  \"Not ulerins,\" Clarey corrected, \"uleran. And you can walk up to any marketplace and get as many as you like--providing you have the cash, of course.\"  \"I _told_ you the job had musical overtones. I'll bet that makes up for some of the discomforts and privations.\"  \"It's not too uncomfortable.\"  \"There speaks a true patriot!\" Spano approved.  Han measured Clarey with her eyes. \"You're quiet, Secretary,\" he said nervously. \"You used to talk a lot more.\"  Blynn stared at him. She smiled. \"You're the one who has things to tell now, Clarey.\"  \"And show,\" the general said, almost licking his lips. \"Every one of your tapes made my mouth fairly water. I trust you brought an ample and varied supply of those delicacies.\"  Clarey's smile was unforced this time. \"I got your message and I brought along a large hamperful, but it'll be hard to make the people back home keep thinking my aunt's an invalid if she eats like a team of hax. My wife baked some pastries, which I especially recommend to your attention.\"  \"I think we ought to get business over before we start on refreshments,\" Han suggested.  \"Yes,\" Spano agreed reluctantly. \"I suppose you had better be deep-probed first, Clarey.... Not even one taste beforehand, Han?... Well, I suppose not.\"  Clarey tensed. \"You've got a probe on the ship?\" he asked, as if the possibility had never occurred to him.  \"That's right,\" Han Vollard said. \"It's an up-to-date model. The whole thing'll take you less than an hour, and we'll have the information collated by morning.\"  \"I--I would prefer not to be deep-probed. You never can tell: it might upset all the conditioning I've received here; it--\"  \"Let us worry about that, Clarey,\" she said.         *       *       *       *       *  He didn't sleep that night. He sat looking out of the window, knowing there was nothing he could do. Embelsira was in danger--her people were in danger--and he couldn't lift a finger to save them.  When he came down to breakfast, he saw that the reports had been collated and read. \"So your wife suspects, does she?\" the general asked. \"Shrewd little creature. You must have picked one of the more intelligent ones.\"  Clarey struggled on the pin. \"Wives often have strange fancies about their husbands. You mustn't take it too seriously.\"  \"How often have you been married, Clarey?\" Han asked. \"Or even linked in liaison? How many married people did you know well back on Earth?\"  There was no need to answer; she knew all the answers.  \"I think Clarey did a rattling good job,\" Blynn said stoutly. \"It wasn't his fault that she suspects.\"  \"Of course not!\" the general agreed. \"Feminine intuition isn't restricted to human females. In fact, in some female ilfs it's even stronger than in humans. The precognitive faculties in the grua, for example--\"  \"What are you going to do?\" Clarey interrupted bluntly.  Han Vollard answered him: \"Nothing yet. You've got us a lot of information, but it's not enough. You'll have to keep on as you are for another three years or so.\"  It was all Clarey could do to keep from trembling visibly with relief.  \"It doesn't even matter too much that one of the natives suspects,\" Han went on, \"as long as she doesn't definitely know.\"  \"She doesn't,\" Clarey said, \"and she won't. And she won't tell anybody; she'd be afraid for me.\" But he wasn't all that sure. The Damorlanti didn't hate Earthmen and they didn't fear them, and so Embelsira wouldn't think it was a shameful thing to be. He was glad he'd already been deep-probed. At least this thought would be safe for three years or so.  \"At any rate, they don't seem antagonistic toward Earthmen,\" the general said, almost as if he'd read part of Clarey's mind. \"I think that's nice.\"  Han Vollard looked at him. \"It's not their attitude toward us that matters. They couldn't do anything if they tried. It's what they are that matters, what they will be that matters even more.\"  \"I take back what I said before!\" Clarey flared. \"You talk too damn much!\"  There was a chilling silence.  \"Nerves,\" said Blynn nervously. \"Every agent lets go when he's back among his own kind. Nothing but release of tension.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Several days later the staff ship was ready to go back to Earth. \"Don't forget to tell your wife how much I enjoyed the pies,\" Spano said; then, \"Oh, I was forgetting; you could hardly do that. But do see if you can work out something with the dehydro-freeze. I'd hate to have to wait three years before tasting them again. You can keep your marac rolls, though; I'll take my smoke-sticks.\"  \"Try not to get any more involved, Clarey,\" Han Vollard said as they stood outside the airlock. \"Maybe you ought to move on--to a city, perhaps, another country--\"  \"When I want your advice, I'll ask for it!\" he snapped.  After they'd gone, Blynn turned on him. \"Man, you must be out of your mind, talking to Secretary Vollard like that.\"  \"Why does she have to keep meddling? It's none of her business--\"  \"None of her business! Secretary of the Space Service, and you say it's none of her business?\"  Clarey blinked. \"I thought she was Spano's secretary.\"  Blynn laughed until the tears dampened his dark cheeks. \"Spano's only Head of Intelligence. She's his Mistress.\"  \"Of course--_mistress_, feminine of _master_! I should have realized that before.\" Then Clarey laughed, too. \"I'm a real all-round alien. I can't even understand my own language.\"  On the way back home he couldn't help thinking that Han Vollard might be right. It could be the best thing for him to disappear now; the best thing for himself, the best thing for Embelsira. He could pretend to desert her--better yet, Blynn could fake some kind of accident, so her feelings wouldn't be hurt. A pension of some kind would be arranged. She could marry again, have the children she wanted so much. If he waited the full ten years, she might never be able to have them. He had no idea at what age Damorlant females ceased to be fertile.  But she wasn't just a Damorlant female--she was his wife. He didn't want to leave her. Maybe he never would have to. Hadn't Spano said that when his term was over he could pick his planet? He would pick Damorlan.         *       *       *       *       *  When Clarey came home from Barshwat, Embelsira said nothing more about her suspicions, but greeted him affectionately and prepared a special supper for him. Afterward, he wondered if making love to an Earth girl could be as pleasant. He wondered how it would be to make love to Han Vollard.  The days passed and he forgot about Han Vollard. After much persuasion, he agreed to give a series of concerts at Zrig, but only on condition that Rini played with him and had one solo each performance. He was embarrassed at having so far outstripped his teacher, but Rini seemed unperturbed.  \"My technique's still better than yours will ever be,\" he said. \"It's this new style of yours that gets 'em. I understand it's spreading; it's reached as far as Barshwat. You should see the angry letters Irik writes about it!\" Rini"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51867"],["title","Sentry of the Sky (#8)"],["body","ckled. \"And he hasn't the least idea it started right here in his own home village that he's always sneered at for being so backward!\"  Clarey smiled and clapped the boy on the neck. If it made Rini feel better to think Clarey had a new style rather than that Clarey played better than he did, Clarey had no objection.  Clarey was offered the post of head librarian at Zrig, but Embelsira didn't want to leave Katund, and, when he thought about it, he really didn't want to either. So he refused the job and didn't bother mentioning the matter to Headquarters.  As he grew more sure of himself and his position, he allowed his wealth to show. He and Embelsira moved into a larger dome. Instead of sending to Zrig or even Barshwat for the furnishings, they hired local talent. Tavan, the carpenter, made them some exquisite blackwood pieces inlaid with opalescent stone that everyone said was the equal of anything in Barshwat. A talented nephew of Hanxi's painted glowing murals; Embelsira's mother wove rugs and draperies in muted water-tones. The dome became the district showplace. Clarey realized he now had a position to keep up, but sometimes it annoyed him when perfect strangers asked to see the place.  He was invited to run against Malesor as headman but declined. He didn't want to be brought into undue prominence. Trouble was, as he became popular, he also aroused animosity. There were the girls who felt he should have married them instead of Embelsira, and their mothers and subsequent husbands. A lot of people resented Clarey because they felt he should have decorated his house differently, dressed differently, spent his money differently.  A man can live ignored by everyone, he discovered, but he can't be liked by some without finding himself disliked by others.         *       *       *       *       *  Matters came to a head in his fourth spring there. He thought of it as spring, although on Damorlan the seasons had no separate identities; they blended into one another, without its ever being very hot or very cold, very rainy or very dry. The reason he called this time of the year spring was that it seemed closest to perfection.  It was less perfect that year. Because it was then that Rini's brother Irik came back from Barshwat, after a six years' absence. He was very much the city man, far more so than anyone Clarey had seen in Barshwat itself. His tunics were shorter than his fellow villagers', and his cloaks iridesced restlessly from one vivid color to another. He wore a great deal of jewelry and perfume, neither of the best quality, and the toes of his boots were divided.  Clarey described this in detail to Embelsira the night Irik put in his first appearance at the Furbush. \"You should have seen the little horror!\"  \"That's the way city men dress,\" Embelsira told him. \"It's fashionable.\"  \"But, dear, I've been to Barshwat.\"  \"You don't have an eye for clothes. You never notice when I put on anything new. And I think it's unfair to take a dislike to Irik just because you don't care for the way he dresses.\"  \"It's more than that, Belsira.\" And yet how could he explain to her what he couldn't quite understand himself, that Irik was vain, stupid, hostile; hence, dangerous?  \"I swear to you, Balt,\" Embelsira said demurely, \"that whatever there was between me and Irik, it all ended six years ago.\"  Clarey gave a start and then held back a smile. \"I believe you, dear.\" And he kissed her nose.         *       *       *       *       *  Irik held forth in the Furbush every evening of his stay in Katund. He had grievances and he aired them generously. He hated everything--the government, taxes, modern music, and Earthmen, whom he seemed to consider in some way responsible for the modern music, or at least its popularization. \"Barbarians--slept completely through my concerts.\"  \"But people are always falling asleep during concerts, Irik,\" Malesor pointed out reasonably. \"And how could you expect barbarians to appreciate good music? What do you care for Earthmen's opinions as long as your own people like your music?\"  Irik hesitated. \"But the Earthmen have taken up the new kind of music; they stay awake during that. And--a lot of people seem to think that whatever's strange is good, so whatever the Earthmen like eventually becomes fashionable.\"  Hanxi wiggled his ears. \"Fashions change. Well, who's ready to have his mug refilled?\"  \"But the Earthmen will keep on setting the fashions,\" Irik snarled. \"Many people think the Earthmen know everything, just because they're aloof and have sky cars.\"  \"Well,\" Malesor said, \"the sky cars certainly prove they know something we don't. Better stick to your music, boy.\"  The smoky little bar-parlor resounded with laughter and Irik's face turned a nasty red. \"They don't know anything about music and they don't know everything about machinery. We might surprise them yet. A friend of mine knows Guhak, the fellow who invented that new brake for the track car a few years ago.\"  \"We know about that brake,\" Piq observed. \"It stops a car so good, the chains are twice as late nowadays as they used to be, and you couldn't strictly say they were ever on time.\"  Everybody laughed again. Irik quivered with anger. \"Guhak has invented a car that doesn't need to go on tracks. It can run _whenever_ it wants _wherever_ it wants. And one car will be able to go faster than three hax teams.\"  \"That I'll believe when I've ridden on it,\" Kuqal grinned. \"Even the chains aren't that fast.\" The others bit their thumbs and nodded--except Clarey, who was rigidly keeping out of the conversation. He forced squfur down his tightening throat and said nothing.  \"You're backward clods!\" Irik raged. \"If the Earthmen can have cars that go through the sky without tracks why shouldn't we have cars that run on the ground the same way? Have we tried?\"  \"Doesn't seem to me it's worth the effort,\" Malesor said. \"Our cars can get us where we're going as fast as we need to go already, why bother?\"  \"Whatever an Earthman can do, we can do better! Soon Guhak will get his ground cars on the road. After that, it'll only be a short step to cars that go in the sky. Then we'll find out where the Earthmen come from and why they're here. We'll be as powerful as they are. We'll get rid of them and their rotten music.\"  The bar parlor was silent, except for the clink as Clarey put his mug on the table. If he held it an instant longer, he was afraid he would spill it. One or two of the men looked at him uneasily out of the corners of their eyes. Malesor spoke: \"In the first place, you don't know how powerful Earthmen are. In the second place, who wants to be powerful, anyway? The Earthmen haven't done us any harm and they're a good thing for the economy. My cousin in Zrig tells me one of 'em come into his store a coupla months ago and bought out his whole stock, every bolt of cloth. Paid twice what it was worth, too. Live and let live, I say.\"  The others murmured restlessly.  \"If there are ways of doing things better,\" Rini suggested, \"why shouldn't we have them, too?\" His eyes darted quickly toward Clarey's and then as quickly away.  Irik turned his head and looked directly at Clarey for the first time. \"You're silent, stranger. What do _you_ think of the Earthmen?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Clarey picked up his drink, finished the squfur and set the mug back down on the table. \"I don't know much about Earthmen. An ugly-looking lot, true, but there doesn't seem to be any harm in them. Of course, living in Barshwat, you probably know a lot more about them than I do.\"  \"I doubt that,\" Irik said. \"You have an aunt in Barshwat.\"  Clarey allowed himself to look surprised before he said courteously, \"I'm glad you find me and my family so interesting. Yes, it so happens I do have an aunt there, but she's rather advanced in years and doesn't enjoy hanging around the starship field the way the children do.\"  Irik's face darkened. \"What is your aunt's name?\"  This time everyone looked surprised. The question itself was not too out-of-the-way, but his tone decidedly was.  \"She's a great-grandmother,\" Clarey said. \"She would be too old for you. And I assure you it's difficult to part her from her money. I've tried.\"  Everybody laughed. Irik was furious. \"I understand that your aunt lives very close to Earth Headquarters!\"  Somebody must have followed him on one or more of his trips to Barshwat, Clarey realized. \"If the Earthmen chose to establish themselves in the best residential section of Barshwat, then probably my aunt does live near them. She's not the type to leave a comfortable dome simply because foreigners move into the neighborhood.\"  \"Perhaps she has more than neighborhood in common with Earthmen.\"  The room was suddenly very quiet again.  \"She does sometimes go to sleep at concerts,\" Clarey conceded.  Irik opened his mouth. Malesor held up a hand. \"Before you say anything more against the Earthmen, Irik,\" he advised, \"you oughta find out more about them. Their cars move faster and higher than ours. Maybe their catapults do, too.\"  No one looked at Clarey. Malesor had averted a showdown, he knew, but this was the beginning of the end. And he had a suspicion who was responsible--innocently perhaps, perhaps not. Love does not always imply trust. And when he told Embelsira what had happened in the Furbush, she, too, couldn't meet his eye. \"That Irik,\" she said, \"I never liked him.\"  \"I wonder how he knows so much about me.\"  \"Rini writes him very often,\" she babbled. \"He must have told him you were responsible for the new music. That would make him hate you. Rini likes to irritate Irik, because he's always been jealous of him. But the whole thing's silly. How could you possibly make over the world's music, even if you were--\" Her voice ran down.  \"An Earthman?\" he finished coldly. \"I suppose you went around telling everybody your suspicions, and Rini wrote that to Irik, too?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"I"]]]
