Burned-out cars littered the parking lot and what had once been a green lawn. They seemed to have been bulldozed out of the way, but not an inch farther than was necessary to clear the approach roads.  To his right, as he stared out onto the field, was a strange-looking construction on three legs, several stories high. It did not seem to serve any useful purpose. Perhaps it had been a sort of luxury restaurant at one time, like the Space Needle from the old Seattle Fair, but now it too was burned out and glassless in its windows. The field itself was swept bare except for two or three parked planes in the bays, but he could see wrecked transports lining the approach strips. All in all, Los Angeles International Airport appeared to be serviceable, but only just.  He wondered where all the people were.  Distant truck noises answered part of the question. An Army six by six came bumping across a bridge that led from the takeoff strips to this parking area of the airport. Five men got out next to one of the ships. They glanced at him but did not speak as they began loading crates of some sort of goods from the truck into the aircraft, a four-engine, swept-wing jet of what looked to Chandler like an obsolete model. Perhaps it was one of the early Boeings. There hadn't been many of those in use at the time the troubles began, too big and fast for short hops, too slow to compete over long distances with the rockets. But, of course, with all the destruction, and with no new aircraft being built anywhere in the world any more, no doubt they were as good as could be found.  The truckmen did not seem to be possessed; they worked with the normal amount of grunting and swearing, pausing to wipe sweat away or to scratch an itch. They showed neither the intense malevolent concentration nor the wide-eyed idiot curiosity of those whose bodies were no longer their own. Chandler settled the woolen cap over the brand on his forehead, to avoid unpleasantness, and drifted over toward them.  They stopped work and regarded him. One of them said something to another, who nodded and walked toward Chandler. \"What do you want?\" he demanded warily.  \"I don't know. I was going to ask you the same question, I guess.\"  The man scowled. \"Didn't your exec tell you what to do?\"  \"My what?\"  The man paused, scratched and shook his head. \"Well, stay away from us. This is an important shipment, see? I guess you're all right or you couldn't've got past the guards, but I don't want you messing us up. Got enough trouble already. I don't know why,\" he said in the tones of an old grievance, \"we can't get the execs to let us _know_ when they're going to bring somebody in. It wouldn't hurt them! Now here we got to load and fuel this ship and, for all I know, you've got half a ton of junk around somewhere that you're going to load onto it. How do I know how much fuel it'll take? No weather, naturally. So if there's headwinds it'll take full tanks, but if there's extra cargo I--\"  \"The only cargo I brought with me that I can think of is a book,\" said Chandler. \"Weighs maybe a pound. You think I'm supposed to get on that plane?\"  The man grunted non-committally.  \"All right, suit yourself. Listen, is there any place I can get something to eat?\"  The man considered. \"Well, I guess we can spare you a sandwich. But you wait here. I'll bring it to you.\"  He went back to the truck. A moment later one of the others brought Chandler two cold hamburgers wrapped in waxed paper, but would answer no questions.         *       *       *       *       *  Chandler ate every crumb, sought and found a washroom in the wrecked building, came out again and sat in the sun, watching the loading crew. He had become quite a fatalist. It did not seem that it was intended he should die immediately, so he might as well live.  There were large gaps in his understanding, but it seemed clear to Chandler that these men, though not possessed, were in some way working for the possessors. It was a distasteful concept; but on second thought it had reassuring elements. It was evidence that whatever the \"execs\" were, they were very possibly human beings--or, if not precisely human, at least shared the human trait of working by some sort of organized effort toward some sort of a goal. It was the first non-random phenomenon he had seen in connection with the possessors, barring the short-term tactical matters of mass slaughter and destruction. It made him feel--what he tried at once to suppress, for he feared another destroying frustration--a touch of hope.  The men finished their work but did not leave. Nor did they approach Chandler, but sat in the shade of their truck, waiting for something. He drowsed and was awakened by a distant sputter of a single-engined Aerocoupe that hopped across the building behind him, turned sharply and came down with a brisk little run in the parking bay itself.  From one side the pilot climbed down and from the other two men lifted, with great care, a wooden crate, small but apparently heavy. They stowed it in the jet while the pilot stood watching; then the pilot and one of the other men got into the crew compartment. Chandler could not be sure, but he had the impression that the truckman who entered the plane was no longer his own master. His movements seemed more sure and confident, but above all it was the mute, angry eyes with which his fellows regarded him that gave Chandler grounds for suspicion. He had no time to worry about that; for in the same breath he felt himself occupied once more.  He did not rise. His own voice said to him, \"You. Votever you name, you fellow vit de book! You go get de book verever you pud it and get on dat ship dere, you see?\" His eyes turned toward the waiting aircraft. \"And don't forget de book!\"  He was released. \"I won't,\" he said automatically, and then realized that there was no longer anyone there to hear his answer.  When he retrieved the Gibran volume from the car and approached the plane the loading crew said nothing. Evidently they knew what he was doing--either because they too had been given instructions, or because they were used to such things. He paused at the wheeled stairs. \"Listen,\" he said, \"can you at least tell me where I'm going?\"  The four remaining men looked at him silently, with the same angry, worried expression he had seen on their faces before. They did not answer, but after a moment one of them raised his arm and pointed.  West. Out toward the Pacific. Out toward some ten million square miles of nearly empty sea.         *       *       *       *       *  Long before they reached their destination Chandler had reasoned what it must be. He was correct: it was the islands of Hawaii.  Chandler knew that the pilot and his coopted partner were up forward, in the crew compartment, but the door was locked and he never saw them again. Apart from them he was the only living person on the plane.  The plane was lightly loaded with cargo of unidentifiable sorts. In the rear section, where once tourist-class passengers had eaten their complimentary tray meals and planned their vacations, the seats had been removed and a thin scatter of crates and boxes were strapped to the floor. In the luxury of the forward section Chandler sat, stared at the water and drowsed. He seemed to be always sleepy. Perhaps it was the consequence of his exertions; more likely it was a psychological phenomenon. He was beyond worry. He had reached that point in emotional fatigue when the sudden rattle of cannonfire or the enemy's banzai charge can no longer flood the blood with adrenalin. The glands are dry. The emotions have been triggered too often. Battle fatigue takes men in many different ways, but in Chandler it was only apathy. He not only could not worry, he could not even rouse himself to feel hunger, although the pricking of habit made him get up and search the flight kitchen, unsuccessfully, for food.  He had no idea how much time had passed when the hiss of the jets changed key.  The horizon dipped below the wingtip and straightened again, and he beheld land. He never saw the airfield, only water, then beach, then water again, then a few buildings. Then there was a roar of jets, with their clamshells deflecting their thrust forward to brake their speed, and then the wheels were on the ground. As the plane stopped he felt himself once more possessed. It was no longer terrifying--though Chandler was sure he was doomed.  Without knowing where he was going or why he picked up the ripped book, opened the cabin exit and stepped down onto the rolling steps that had immediately been brought into place. He was conscious of a horde of men swarming around the plane, stripping it of its cargo, and wondered briefly at the rush; but he could not stop to watch them, his legs carried him swiftly across a paved strip to where a police car was cruising.  Chandler cringed inside, instinctively, but his body did not falter as it stepped into the path of the car and raised its hand.  The police car jammed on its brakes. The policeman at the wheel, Chandler thought inside himself, looked startled, but he also looked resigned. \"To de South Gate, qvickly,\" said Chandler's lips, and he felt his legs carry him around to the door on the other side.  There was another policeman on the seat next to the driver. He leaped like a hare to get the door open and get out before Chandler's body got there. He made it with nothing to spare. \"Jack, you go on, I'll tell Headquarters,\" he said hurriedly. The driver nodded without speaking. His lips were white. He reached over Chandler to close the door and made a sharp U-turn.  As soon as the car was moving Chandler felt himself able to move his lips again.  \"I,\" he said. \"I don't know--\"  \"Friend,\" said the policeman, \"kindly keep your mouth shut. 'South Gate,' the exec said, and South Gate is where I'm going.\"  Chandler shrugged and looked out the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51809"],["title","Survival Kit (#0)"],["body","wasn't fair--a smart but luckless man                like Mooney had to scrounge, while Harse                always made out just because he had a....

It was a sudden, bright, cold flare and it was gone again. It had no more features than a fog, at least not through the window that was showered with snow and patterned with spray from the windy sea.  Mooney blew on his hands and frowned at the window.  \"Son of a gun,\" he said, and thought for a moment about phoning the Coast Guard station. Of course, that meant going a quarter of a mile in the storm to reach the only other house nearby that was occupied; the Hansons had a phone that worked, but a quarter of a mile was a long way in the face of a December gale. And it was all dark out there now. Less than twenty miles across the bay was New York, but this Jersey shore coast was harsh as the face of the Moon.  Mooney decided it was none of his business.  He shook the kettle, holding it with an old dish towel because it was sizzling hot. It was nearly empty, so he filled it again and put it back on the stove. He had all four top burners and the oven going, which made the kitchen tolerably warm--as long as he wore the scarf and the heavy quilted jacket and kept his hands in his pockets. And there was plenty of tea.  Uncle Lester had left that much behind him--plenty of tea, nearly a dozen boxes of assorted cookies and a few odds and ends of canned goods. And God's own quantity of sugar.  It wasn't exactly a balanced diet, but Mooney had lived on it for three weeks now--smoked turkey sausages for breakfast, and oatmeal cookies for lunch, and canned black olives for dinner. And always plenty of tea.         *       *       *       *       *  The wind screamed at him as he poured the dregs of his last cup of tea into the sink and spooned sugar into the cup for the next one. It was, he calculated, close to midnight. If the damn wind hadn't blown down the TV antenna, he could be watching the late movies now. It helped to pass the time; the last movie was off the air at two or three o'clock, and then he could go to bed and, with any luck, sleep till past noon.  And Uncle Lester had left a couple of decks of sticky, child-handled cards behind him, too, when the family went back to the city at the end of the summer. So what with four kinds of solitaire, and solo bridge, and television, and a few more naps, Mooney could get through to the next two or three A.M. again. If only the wind hadn't blown down the antenna!  But as it was, all he could get on the cheap little set his uncle had left behind was a faint gray herringbone pattern--  He straightened up with the kettle in his hand, listening.  It was almost as though somebody was knocking at the door.  \"That's crazy,\" Mooney said out loud after a moment. He poured the water over the tea bag, tearing a little corner off the paper tag on the end of the string to mark the fact that this was the second cup he had made with the bag. He had found he could get three cups out of a single bag, but even loaded with sugar, the fourth cup was no longer very good. Still, he had carefully saved all the used, dried-out bags against the difficult future day when even the tea would be gone.  That was going to be one bad day for Howard Mooney.  Rap, tap. It really was someone at the door! Not knocking, exactly, but either kicking at it or striking it with a stick.  Mooney pulled his jacket tight around him and walked out into the frigid living room, not quite so frigid as his heart.  \"Damn!\" he said. \"Damn, damn!\"  What Mooney knew for sure was that nothing good could be coming in that door for him. It might be a policeman from Sea Bright, wondering about the light in the house; it might be a member of his uncle's family. It was even possible that one of the stockholders who had put up the money for that unfortunate venture into frozen-food club management had tracked him down as far as the Jersey shore. It could be almost anything or anybody, but it couldn't be good.  All the same, Mooney hadn't expected it to turn out to be a tall, lean man with angry pale eyes, wearing a silvery sort of leotard.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I come in,\" said the angry man, and did.  Mooney slammed the door behind him. Too bad, but he couldn't keep it open, even if it was conceding a sort of moral right to enter to the stranger; he couldn't have all that cold air coming in to dilute his little bubble of warmth.  \"What the devil do you want?\" Mooney demanded.  The angry man looked about him with an expression of revulsion. He pointed to the kitchen. \"It is warmer. In there?\"  \"I suppose so. What do--\" But the stranger was already walking into the kitchen. Mooney scowled and started to follow, and stopped, and scowled even more. The stranger was leaving footprints behind him, or anyway some kind of marks that showed black on the faded summer rug. True, he was speckled with snow, but--that much snow? The man was drenched. It looked as though he had just come out of the ocean.  The stranger stood by the stove and glanced at Mooney warily. Mooney stood six feet, but this man was bigger. The silvery sort of thing he had on covered his legs as far as the feet, and he wore no shoes. It covered his body and his arms, and he had silvery gloves on his hands. It stopped at the neck, in a collar of what looked like pure silver, but could not have been because it gave with every breath the man took and every tensed muscle or tendon in his neck. His head was bare and his hair was black, cut very short.  He was carrying something flat and shiny by a molded handle. If it had been made of pigskin, it would have resembled a junior executive's briefcase.  The man said explosively: \"You will help me.\"  Mooney cleared his throat. \"Listen, I don't know what you want, but this is my house and--\"  \"You will help me,\" the man said positively. \"I will pay you. Very well?\"  He had a peculiar way of parting his sentences in the middle, but Mooney didn't care about that. He suddenly cared about one thing and that was the word \"pay.\"  \"What do you want me to do?\"  The angry-eyed man ran his gloved hands across his head and sluiced drops of water onto the scuffed linoleum and the bedding of the cot Mooney had dragged into the kitchen. He said irritably: \"I am a wayfarer who needs a. Guide? I will pay you for your assistance.\"  The question that rose to Mooney's lips was \"How much?\" but he fought it back. Instead, he asked, \"Where do you want to go?\"  \"One moment.\" The stranger sat damply on the edge of Mooney's cot and, click-snap, the shiny sort of briefcase opened itself in his hands. He took out a flat round thing like a mirror and looked into it, squeezing it by the edges, and holding it this way and that.  Finally he said: \"I must go to Wednesday, the twenty-sixth of December, at--\" He tilted the little round thing again. \"Brooklyn?\" he finished triumphantly.  Mooney said, after a second: \"That's a funny way to put it.\"  \"Question?\"  \"I mean,\" said Mooney, \"I know where Brooklyn is and I know _when_ the twenty-sixth of December is--it's next week--but you have to admit that that's an odd way of putting it. I mean you don't _go_ anywhere in time.\"  The wet man turned his pale eyes on Mooney. \"Perhaps you are. Wrong?\"   II  Mooney stared at his napping guest in a mood of wonder and fear and delight.  Time traveler! But it was hard to doubt the pale-eyed man. He had said he was from the future and he mentioned a date that made Mooney gasp. He had said: \"When you speak to me, you must know that my. Name? Is Harse.\" And then he had curled up on the floor, surrounding his shiny briefcase like a mother cat around a kitten, and begun dozing alertly.  But not before he showed Mooney just what it was he proposed to pay him with.  Mooney sipped his cooling tea and forgot to shiver, though the drafts were fiercer and more biting than ever, now just before dawn. He was playing with what had looked at first like a string of steel ball-bearings, a child's necklace, half-inch spheres linked together in a strand a yard long.  Wampum! That was what Harse had called the spheres when he picked the string out of his little kit, and that was what they were.  Each ball-bearing was hollow. Open them up and out come the treasures of the crown. Pop, and one of the spheres splits neatly in half, and out spills a star sapphire, as big as the ball of your finger, glittering like the muted lights of hell. Pop, and another sphere drops a ball of yellow gold into your palm. Pop for a narwhal's tooth, pop for a cube of sugar; pop, pop, and there on the table before Harse sparkled diamonds and lumps of coal, a packet of heroin, a sphere of silver, pearls, beads of glass, machined pellets of tungsten, lumps of saffron and lumps of salt.  \"It is,\" said Harse, \"for your. Pay? No, _no_!\" And he headed off Mooney's greedy fingers.  Click, click, click, and the little pellets of treasure and trash were back in the steel balls.  \"No, _no_!\" said Harse again, grinning, snapping the balls together like poppets in a string. \"After you have guided me to Brooklyn and the December twenty-sixth. But I must say to you. This? That some of the balls contain plutonium and some radium. And I do not think that you can get them. Open? But if you did, you perhaps would die. Oh. Ho?\" And, laughing, he began his taut nap.         *       *       *       *       *  Mooney swallowed the last of his icy tea. It was full daylight outside.  Very well, castaway, he said silently to the dozing"]]]
