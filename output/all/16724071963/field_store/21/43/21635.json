Blots and blobs of green, orange, pink and yellow spattered the blue-caped agents.  At the end of the street, someone ran up tugging a lion by the mane.  \"_Go_, dog! _Run!_\"  Somewhere a child cried out in terror.  The lion roared.  The troops on the steps opened their eyes.  An old man's voice, amplified, spoke out with icy authority:  \"_Deploy for street-fighting! First rank, move out along Center Street toward North Viaduct. Rifles at full charge. Wide intervals. Use every scrap of cover. Shoot the false-belted usurpers on sight._  \"_Second rank, move out along West Ocean Avenue toward the sea wall...._\"  Shots rang out.  There was a faint thrumming hum, like wires in the wind, and streaks of cherry radiance criss-crossed in the air.  The lion roared, unable to find the child. The roars of other lions joined in.  Dan was aware that he was lying atop the hard base of the statue, but he didn't know how he had come to be there. He tried to stand up.  He heard voices screaming orders, then falling still, and a scene swung into his line of sight like something watched through the rear-view mirror of a turning groundcar.  Half a dozen men, guns in their hands, their bodies and blue capes spattered and smeared till they could hardly be recognized, lay motionless on the pavement  Then the scene swung up and away, and Dan felt weightless. Something hit him hard. His head bounced and he rolled over. Soft grass was in his face. It smelled fresh.  There was a dull boom that moved the ground under him.  He twisted his head to look up.  A massive arm was stretched out over him, its hand firmly gripping the cut edges of a big metal ring.  Somewhere a drum took up a steady monotonous beat.  He fell into a deep black quiet and all the sights and sounds grew smaller and fainter and disappeared entirely.         *       *       *       *       *  He awoke in a Porcyn hospital. Kielgaard was there, wearing a broad grin and brilliant Porcyn clothes and promising Dan a huge bonus. But it was all like a dream.  Kielgaard said the Porcyns were as mad as hornets. They had raised a battle fleet and it had taken a corps of diplomats and the Combined Intergalactic Space Fleet to argue them out of personally chopping Trans-Space into fine bits. No one knew what would finally happen, but meanwhile Galactic had its contract and everyone was tentatively happy.  His account finished, Kielgaard grinned more broadly yet and switched on a bedside televiewer.  Dan lifted his head off the pillow and looked at the screen. Then he stared.  It was the statue, solid once more on its base, the ring grasped firmly in one hand and a big wrench in the other. But something seemed different.  Dan at last saw what it was.  It was the face. It wasn't a bad face, if one expected to see strong cheekbones, copper skin and a high-arched nose.  \"What a compliment!\" he said, embarrassedly pleased. \"I--hell, I feel like blushing.\"  \"Make it a good one,\" said Kielgaard. \"After tomorrow, you'll have to blush with your own face again.\"  \"_Tomorrow?_\"  \"Sure. You're still working for us, remember.\"  Dan sank back on the pillow and gazed up speculatively at the ceiling. \"All right, but I want some time off. I have a fat bonus to spend.\"  \"You could use a holiday,\" Kielgaard agreed. \"Why not try the Andromedan cloud gardens? Pretty expensive, but with your bonus--\"  \"I've got a place picked out,\" said Dan. \"I'm going to take a vacation on Porcys.\"  Kielgaard started. \"You're joking! Or you've gone twitchy!\"  \"No. Before I have to give this face back to Surgery, I ought to get a _little_ enjoyment out of it. And what could be more enjoyable than hanging around the statue, letting people see the resemblance? Besides, they can't make me take my vacation on the Vacation Planet--I've already had it.\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51274"],["title","Ambition (#0)"],["body","By WILLIAM L. BADE                         Illustrated by L. WOROMAY             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                  Galaxy Science Fiction October 1951.          Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                    To the men of the future, the scientific                 goals of today were as incomprehensible                as the ancient quest for the Holy Grail!   There was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half awake, and opened his eyes. The room was dark except where a broad shaft of moonlight from the open window fell on the foot of his bed. Outside, the residential section of the Reservation slept silently under the pale illumination of the full Moon. He guessed sleepily that it was about three o'clock.  What had he heard? He had a definite impression that the sound had come from within the room. It had sounded like someone stumbling into a chair, or--  Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the room. Maitland started to sit up and it was as though a thousand volts had shorted his brain....  This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked through the window at a section of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds somewhere outside. A beautiful day. In the middle of the process of stretching his rested muscles, arms extended back, legs tensed, he froze, looking up--for the first time really seeing the ceiling. He turned his head, then rolled off the bed, wide awake.  _This wasn't his room!_  The lawn outside wasn't part of the Reservation! Where the labs and the shops should have been, there was deep prairie grass, then a green ocean pushed into waves by the breeze stretching to the horizon. This wasn't the California desert! Down the hill, where the liquid oxygen plant ought to have been, a river wound across the scene, almost hidden beneath its leafy roof of huge ancient trees.  Shock contracted Maitland's diaphragm and spread through his body. His breathing quickened. _Now_ he remembered what had happened during the night, the sound in the darkness, the dimly seen figure, and then--what? Blackout....  Where was he? Who had brought him here? For what purpose?  He thought he knew the answer to the last of those questions. As a member of the original atomic reaction-motor team, he possessed information that other military powers would very much like to obtain. It was absolutely incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from the heavily guarded confines of the Reservation, yet someone had done it. How?         *       *       *       *       *  He pivoted to inspect the room. Even before his eyes could take in the details, he had the impression that there was something wrong about it. To begin with, the style was unfamiliar. There were no straight lines or sharp corners anywhere. The walls were paneled in featureless blue plastic and the doors were smooth surfaces of metal, half ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table, built apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the impression of arrested motion. Even after allowances were made for the outlandish design, something about the room still was not right.  His eyes returned to the doors, and he moved over to study the nearer one. As he had noticed, there was no knob, but at the right of this one, at about waist level, a push-button projected out of the wall. He pressed it; the door slid aside and disappeared. Maitland glanced in at the disclosed bathroom, then went over to look at the other door.  There was no button beside this one, nor any other visible means of causing it to open.  Baffled, he turned again and looked at the large open window--and realized what it was that had made the room seem so queer.  It did not look like a jail cell. There were no bars....  Striding across the room, he lunged forward to peer out and violently banged his forehead. He staggered back, grimacing with pain, then reached forward cautious fingers and discovered a hard sheet of stuff so transparent that he had not even suspected its presence. Not glass! Glass was never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he hadn't heard of. Security sometimes had disadvantages.  He looked out at the peaceful vista of river and prairie. The character of the sunlight seemed to indicate that it was afternoon. He became aware that he was hungry.  Where the devil could this place be? And--muscles tightened about his empty stomach--what was in store for him here?  He stood trembling, acutely conscious that he was afraid and helpless, until a flicker of motion at the bottom of the hill near the river drew his attention. Pressing his nose against the window, he strained his eyes to see what it was.  A man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they had been swimming, for each had a towel; the man's was hung around his neck, and the woman was still drying her bobbed black hair.  Maitland speculated on the possibility that this might be Sweden; he didn't know of any other country where public bathing at this time of year was customary. However, that prairie certainly didn't look Scandinavian....  As they came closer, he saw that both of them had dark uniform suntans and showed striking muscular development, like persons who had trained for years with weights. They vanished below his field of view, presumably into the building.  He sat down on the edge of the cot and glared helplessly at the floor.         *       *       *       *       *  About half an hour later, the door he couldn't open slid aside into the wall. The man Maitland had seen outside, now clad in gray trunks and sandals, stood across the threshold looking in at him. Maitland stood up and stared back, conscious suddenly that in his rumpled pajamas he made an unimpressive figure.  The fellow looked about forty-five. The first details Maitland noticed were the forehead, which was quite broad, and the calm, clear eyes. The dark hair, white at the temples, was combed back, still damp from swimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and a firm, rounded chin.  This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure of himself.  Somehow, the face didn't go with the rest of him. The man had the head of a thinker, the body of a trained athlete--an unusual combination.  Impassively, the man said, \"My name is Swarts. You want to know where you are. I am not going to tell you.\" He had an accent, European, but otherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. Maitland opened his mouth to protest, but Swarts went on, \"However, you're free to do all the guessing you want.\" Still there was no suggestion of a smile.  \"Now, these are the rules. You'll be here for about a week. You'll have three meals a day, served in this room. You will not be allowed to leave it except when accompanied by myself. You will not be harmed in any way, provided you cooperate. And you can forget the silly idea that we want your childish secrets about rocket motors.\" Maitland's heart jumped. \"My reason for bringing you here is altogether different. I want to give you some psychological tests....\"  \"Are you crazy?\" Maitland asked quietly. \"Do you realize that at this moment one of the greatest hunts in history must be going on? I'll admit I'm baffled as to where we are and how you got me here--but it seems to me that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give your tests to.\"  Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. \"They won't find you,\" he said. \"Now, come with me.\"         *       *       *       *       *  After that outlandish cell, Swarts' laboratory looked rather commonplace. There was something like a surgical cot in the center, and a bench along one wall supported several electronics cabinets. A couple of them had cathode ray tube screens, and they all presented a normal complement of meters, pilot lights, and switches. Cables from them ran across the ceiling and came to a focus above the high flat cot in the center of the room.  \"Lie down,\" Swarts said. When Maitland hesitated, Swarts added, \"Understand one thing--the more you cooperate, the easier things will be for you. If necessary, I will use coercion. I can get all my results against your will, if I must. I would prefer not to. Please don't make me.\"  \"What's the idea?\" Maitland asked. \"What is all this?\"  Swarts hesitated, though not, Maitland astonishedly felt, to evade an answer, but to find the proper words. \"You can think of it as a lie detector. These instruments will record your reactions to the tests I give you. That is as much as you need to know. Now lie down.\"  Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his tensed muscles. \"Make me.\"  If Swarts was irritated, he didn't show it. \"That was the first test,\" he said. \"Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it a lot if you'd lie down on this cot. I would like to test my apparatus.\"  Maitland shook his head stubbornly.  \"I see,\" Swarts said. \"You want to find out what you're up against.\"  He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It was to the solar plexus, just hard enough to double him up, fighting for breath. He felt an arm under his back, another behind his knees. Then he was on the cot. When he was able to breathe again, there were straps across his chest, hips, knees, ankles, and arms, and Swarts was tightening a clamp that held his head immovable.  Presently, a number of tiny electrodes were adhering to his temples and to other portions of his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to the skin over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung from the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly around his left upper arm, its rubber tube trailing to a small black box clamped to the frame of the cot. Another cable left the box and joined the others.  So--Maitland thought--Swarts could record changes in his skin potential, heartbeat, and blood"]]]
