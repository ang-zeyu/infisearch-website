But it's really his life or mine'.\"  \"He's more right than he knows. Why all this violence, though? Isn't there any clue?\"  \"None at all,\" admitted Dimanche. \"He's very close. You'd better turn around.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Cassal turned, pressed the stud on the lighter. It should have made him feel more secure, but it didn't. He could see very little.  A dim shadow rushed at him. He jumped away from the water side of the alley, barely in time. He could feel the rush of air as the assailant shot by.  \"Hey!\" shouted Cassal.  Echoes answered; nothing else did. He had the uncomfortable feeling that no one was going to come to his assistance.  \"He wasn't expecting that reaction,\" explained Dimanche. \"That's why he missed. He's turned around and is coming back.\"  \"I'm armed!\" shouted Cassal.  \"That won't stop him. He doesn't believe you.\"  Cassal grasped the lighter. That is, it had been a lighter a few seconds before. Now a needle-thin blade had snapped out and projected stiffly. Originally it had been designed as an emergency surgical instrument. A little imagination and a few changes had altered its function, converting it into a compact, efficient stiletto.  \"Twenty feet away,\" advised Dimanche. \"He knows you can't see him, but he can see your silhouette by the light from the main thoroughfare. What he doesn't know is that I can detect every move he makes and keep you posted below the level of his hearing.\"  \"Stay on him,\" growled Cassal nervously. He flattened himself against the wall.  \"To the right,\" whispered Dimanche. \"Lunge forward. About five feet. Low.\"  Sickly, he did so. He didn't care to consider the possible effects of a miscalculation. In the darkness, how far was five feet? Fortunately, his estimate was correct. The rapier encountered yielding resistance, the soggy kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, but did not break. His opponent gasped and broke away.  \"Attack!\" howled Dimanche against the bone behind his ear. \"You've got him. He can't imagine how you know where he is in the darkness. He's afraid.\"  Attack he did, slicing about wildly. Some of the thrusts landed; some didn't. The percentage was low, the total amount high. His opponent fell to the ground, gasped and was silent.  Cassal fumbled in his pockets and flipped on a light. The man lay near the water side of the alley. One leg was crumpled under him. He didn't move.  \"Heartbeat slow,\" said Dimanche solemnly. \"Breathing barely perceptible.\"  \"Then he's not dead,\" said Cassal in relief.  Foam flecked from the still lips and ran down the chin. Blood oozed from cuts on the face.  \"Respiration none, heartbeat absent,\" stated Dimanche.         *       *       *       *       *  Horrified, Cassal gazed at the body. Self-defense, of course, but would the police believe it? Assuming they did, they'd still have to investigate. The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would question him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but what could he do about it?  Suppose he were detained long enough to miss the ship bound for Tunney 21?  Grimly, he laid down the rapier. He might as well get to the bottom of this. Why had the man attacked? What did he want?  \"I don't know,\" replied Dimanche irritably. \"I can interpret body data--a live body. I can't work on a piece of meat.\"  Cassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal articles of no value in identifying the man. A clip with a startling amount of money in it. A small white card with something scribbled on it. A picture of a woman and a small child posed against a background which resembled no world Cassal had ever seen. That was all.  Cassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, there seemed to be no connection between this dead man and his own problem of getting to Tunney 21.  Right now, though, he had to dispose of the body. He glanced toward the boulevard. So far no one had been attracted by the violence.  He bent down to retrieve the lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted at him. Before he could react, someone landed on him. He fell forward, vainly trying to grasp the weapon. Strong fingers felt for his throat as he was forced to the ground.  He threw the attacker off and staggered to his feet. He heard footsteps rushing away. A slight splash followed. Whoever it was, he was escaping by way of water.  Whoever it was. The man he had thought he had slain was no longer in sight.  \"Interpret body data, do you?\" muttered Cassal. \"Liveliest dead man I've ever been strangled by.\"  \"It's just possible there are some breeds of men who can control the basic functions of their body,\" said Dimanche defensively. \"When I checked him, he had no heartbeat.\"  \"Remind me not to accept your next evaluation so completely,\" grunted Cassal. Nevertheless, he was relieved, in a fashion. He hadn't _wanted_ to kill the man. And now there was nothing he'd have to explain to the police.  He needed the cigarette he stuck between his lips. For the second time he attempted to pick up the rapier-lighter. This time he was successful. Smoke swirled into his lungs and quieted his nerves. He squeezed the weapon into the shape of a lighter and put it away.  Something, however, was missing--his wallet.  The thug had relieved him of it in the second round of the scuffle. Persistent fellow. Damned persistent.  It really didn't matter. He fingered the clip he had taken from the supposedly dead body. He had intended to turn it over to the police. Now he might as well keep it to reimburse him for his loss. It contained more money than his wallet had.  Except for the identification tab he always carried in his wallet, it was more than a fair exchange. The identification, a rectangular piece of plastic, was useful in establishing credit, but with the money he now had, he wouldn't need credit. If he did, he could always send for another tab.  A white card fluttered from the clip. He caught it as it fell. Curiously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word, STAB. His unknown assailant certainly had tried.         *       *       *       *       *  The old man stared at the door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling precariously on his head. He closed his eyes and the lettering on the door disappeared. Cassal was too far away to see what it had been. The technician opened his eyes and concentrated. Slowly a new sign formed on the door.                           TRAVELERS AID BUREAU                      Murra Foray, First Counselor  It was a drab sign, but, then, it was a dismal, backward planet. The old technician passed on to the next door and closed his eyes again.  With a sinking feeling, Cassal walked toward the entrance. He needed help and he had to find it in this dingy rathole.  Inside, though, it wasn't dingy and it wasn't a rathole. More like a maze, an approved scientific one. Efficient, though not comfortable. Travelers Aid was busier than he thought it would be. Eventually he managed to squeeze into one of the many small counseling rooms.  A woman appeared on the screen, crisp and cool. \"Please answer everything the machine asks. When the tape is complete, I'll be available for consultation.\"  Cassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. \"Is this necessary?\" he asked. \"It's merely a matter of information.\"  \"We have certain regulations we abide by.\" The woman smiled frostily. \"I can't give you any information until you comply with them.\"  \"Sometimes regulations are silly,\" said Cassal firmly. \"Let me speak to the first counselor.\"  \"You are speaking to her,\" she said. Her face disappeared from the screen.  Cassal sighed. So far he hadn't made a good impression.  Travelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was abundantly supplied with official curiosity. When the machine finished with him, Cassal had the feeling he could be recreated from the record it had of him. His individuality had been capsuled into a series of questions and answers. One thing he drew the line at--why he wanted to go to Tunney 21 was his own business.  The first counselor reappeared. Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed, that anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than average, rather on the slender side. Face was broad at the brow, narrow at the chin and her eyes were enigmatic. A dangerous woman.         *       *       *       *       *  She glanced down at the data. \"Denton Cassal, native of Earth. Destination, Tunney 21.\" She looked up at him. \"Occupation, sales engineer. Isn't that an odd combination?\" Her smile was quite superior.  \"Not at all. Scientific training as an engineer. Special knowledge of customer relations.\"  \"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient.\" Her eyebrows arched.  \"I think so,\" he agreed blandly. \"Anything else you'd like to know?\"  \"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.\"  He could believe that or not as he wished. He didn't.  \"You refused to answer why you were going to Tunney 21. Perhaps I can guess. They're the best scientists in the Galaxy. You wish to study under them.\"  Close--but wrong on two counts. They were good scientists, though not necessarily the best. For instance, it was doubtful that they could build Dimanche, even if they had ever thought of it, which was even less likely.  There was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on Tunney 21 that Neuronics wanted on their staff. If the fragments of his studies that had reached Earth across the vast distance meant anything, he could help Neuronics perfect instantaneous radio. The company that could build a radio to span the reaches of the Galaxy with no time lag could set its own price, which could be control of all communications, transport, trade--a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share would be a cut of all that.  His part was simple, on the surface. He was to persuade that researcher to come to Earth, _if he could_. Literally, he had to guess the Tunnesian's price before the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50998"],["title","Delay in Transit (#2)"],["body","himself knew it. In addition, the reputation of Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their arrogance, Cassal had to convince him that he wouldn't be working for ignorant Earth savages. The existence of such an instrument as Dimanche was a key factor.  Her voice broke through his thoughts. \"Now, then, what's your problem?\"  \"I was told on Earth I might have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've been here three weeks. I want information on the ship bound for Tunney 21.\"  \"Just a moment.\" She glanced at something below the angle of the screen. She looked up and her eyes were grave. \"_Rickrock C_ arrived yesterday. Departed for Tunney early this morning.\"  \"Departed?\" He got up and sat down again, swallowing hard. \"When will the next ship arrive?\"  \"Do you know how many stars there are in the Galaxy?\" she asked.  He didn't answer.         *       *       *       *       *  \"That's right,\" she said. \"Billions. Tunney, according to the notation, is near the center of the Galaxy, inside the third ring. You've covered about a third of the distance to it. Local traffic, anything within a thousand light-years, is relatively easy to manage. At longer distances, you take a chance. You've had yours and missed it. Frankly, Cassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney will show up on or near Godolph. Within the next five years--maybe.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He blanched. \"How long would it take to get there using local transportation, star-hopping?\"  \"Take my advice: don't try it. Five years, if you're lucky.\"  \"I don't need that kind of luck.\"  \"I suppose not.\" She hesitated. \"You're determined to go on?\" At the emphatic nod, she sighed. \"If that's your decision, we'll try to help you. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your identification tab.\"  \"There's something funny about her,\" Dimanche decided. It was the usual speaking voice of the instrument, no louder than the noise the blood made in coursing through arteries and veins. Cassal could hear it plainly, because it was virtually inside his ear.  Cassal ignored his private voice. \"Identification tab? I don't have it with me. In fact, I may have lost it.\"  She smiled in instant disbelief. \"We're not trying to pry into any part of your past you may wish concealed. However, it's much easier for us to help you if you have your identification. Now if you can't _remember_ your real name and where you put your identification--\" She arose and left the screen. \"Just a moment.\"  He glared uneasily at the spot where the first counselor wasn't. His _real_ name!  \"Relax,\" Dimanche suggested. \"She didn't mean it as a personal insult.\"  Presently she returned.  \"I have news for you, whoever you are.\"  \"Cassal,\" he said firmly. \"Denton Cassal, sales engineer, Earth. If you don't believe it, send back to--\" He stopped. It had taken him four months to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month wait on Earth for a ship to show up that was bound in the right direction. Over distances such as these, it just wasn't practical to send back to Earth for anything.  \"I see you understand.\" She glanced at the card in her hand. \"The spaceport records indicate that when _Rickrock C_ took off this morning, there was a Denton Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21.\"  \"It wasn't I,\" he said dazedly. He knew who it was, though. The man who had tried to kill him last night. The reason for the attack now became clear. The thug had wanted his identification tab. Worse, he had gotten it.  \"No doubt it wasn't,\" she said wearily. \"Outsiders don't seem to understand what galactic travel entails.\"  Outsiders? Evidently what she called those who lived beyond the second transfer ring. Were those who lived at the edge of the Galaxy, beyond the first ring, called Rimmers? Probably.         *       *       *       *       *  She was still speaking: \"Ten years to cross the Galaxy, without stopping. At present, no ship is capable of that. Real scheduling is impossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken off a run for repairs and is never put back on. It's more urgently needed elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years pass before he learns it's never coming.  \"If we had instantaneous radio, that would help. Confusion wouldn't vanish overnight, but it would diminish. We wouldn't have to depend on ships for all the news. Reservations could be made ahead of time, credit established, lost identification replaced--\"  \"I've traveled before,\" he interrupted stiffly. \"I've never had any trouble.\"  She seemed to be exaggerating the difficulties. True, the center was more congested. Taking each star as the starting point for a limited number of ships and using statistical probability as a guide--why, no man would arrive at his predetermined destination.  But that wasn't the way it worked. Manifestly, you couldn't compare galactic transportation to the erratic paths of air molecules in a giant room. Or could you?  For the average man, anyone who didn't have his own inter-stellar ship, was the comparison too apt? It might be.  \"You've traveled outside, where there are still free planets waiting to be settled. Where a man is welcome, if he's able to work.\" She paused. \"The center is different. Populations are excessive. Inside the third ring, no man is allowed off a ship without an identification tab. They don't encourage immigration.\"  In effect, that meant no ship bound for the center would take a passenger without identification. No ship owner would run the risk of having a permanent guest on board, someone who couldn't be rid of when his money was gone.  Cassal held his head in his hands. Tunney 21 was inside the third ring.  \"Next time,\" she said, \"don't let anyone take your identification.\"  \"I won't,\" he promised grimly.         *       *       *       *       *  The woman looked directly at him. Her eyes were bright. He revised his estimate of her age drastically downward. She couldn't be as old as he. Nothing outward had happened, but she no longer seemed dowdy. Not that he was interested. Still, it might pay him to be friendly to the first counselor.  \"We're a philanthropic agency,\" said Murra Foray. \"Your case is special, though--\"  \"I understand,\" he said gruffly. \"You accept contributions.\"  She nodded. \"If the donor is able to give. We don't ask so much that you'll have to compromise your standard of living.\" But she named a sum that would force him to do just that if getting to Tunney 21 took any appreciable time.  He stared at her unhappily. \"I suppose it's worth it. I can always work, if I have to.\"  \"As a salesman?\" she asked. \"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult to do business with Godolphians.\"  Irony wasn't called for at a time like this, he thought reproachfully.  \"Not just another salesman,\" he answered definitely. \"I have special knowledge of customer reactions. I can tell exactly--\"  He stopped abruptly. Was she baiting him? For what reason? The instrument he called Dimanche was not known to the Galaxy at large. From the business angle, it would be poor policy to hand out that information at random. Aside from that, he needed every advantage he could get. Dimanche was his special advantage.  \"Anyway,\" he finished lamely, \"I'm a first class engineer. I can always find something in that line.\"  \"A scientist, maybe,\" murmured Murra Foray. \"But in this part of the Milky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a technician who hasn't yet gained practical experience.\" She shook her head. \"You'll do better as a salesman.\"  He got up, glowering. \"If that's all--\"  \"It is. We'll keep you informed. Drop your contribution in the slot provided for that purpose as you leave.\"  A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling cubicle, swung open. The agency was efficient.  \"Remember,\" the counselor called out as he left, \"identification is hard to work with. Don't accept a crude forgery.\"  He didn't answer, but it was an idea worth considering. The agency was also eminently practical.  The exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet inescapable contribution station. He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the bureau.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I've got it,\" said Dimanche as Cassal gloomily counted out the sum the first counselor had named.  \"Got what?\" asked Cassal. He rolled the currency into a neat bundle, attached his name, and dropped it into the chute.  \"The woman, Murra Foray, the first counselor. She's a Huntner.\"  \"What's a Huntner?\"  \"A sub-race of men on the other side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing about her home planet when I managed to locate her.\"  \"Any other information?\"  \"None. Electronic guards were sliding into place as soon as I reached her. I got out as fast as I could.\"  \"I see.\" The significance of that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless, it sounded depressing.  \"What I want to know is,\" said Dimanche, \"why such precautions as electronic guards? What does Travelers Aid have that's so secret?\"  Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly inquisitive at times.  Cassal had entered one side of a block-square building. He came out on the other side. The agency was larger than he had thought. The old man was staring at a door as Cassal came out. He had apparently changed every sign in the building. His work finished, the technician was removing the visual projector from his head as Cassal came up to him. He turned and peered.  \"You stuck here, too?\" he asked in the uneven voice of the aged.  \"Stuck?\" repeated Cassal. \"I suppose you can call it that. I'm waiting for my ship.\" He frowned. He was the one who wanted to ask questions. \"Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers Aid was an old agency. Why did you change so many signs? I could understand it if the agency were new.\"  The old man chuckled. \"Re-organization. The previous first counselor resigned suddenly, in the middle of the night, they say. The new one didn't like the name of the"]]]
