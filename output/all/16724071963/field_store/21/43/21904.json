It was thought that even Wolves were entitled to the common human decencies in the brief interval between exposure and the Donation of Fluid. The Keeper would not have dreamed of scowling at the detected Wolf or of interfering with whatever wretched imitation of meditation-before-dying the creature might practice. But he could not, all the same, bring himself to offer even an assurance-of-identity gesture.  Tropile had no such qualms.  He scowled at Keeper Harmane with such ferocity that the old man almost hurried away. He turned an almost equally ugly scowl upon Citizen Boyne. How dared that knife-murderer be so calm, so relaxed!  Tropile said brutally: \"They'll kill us! You know that? They'll stick a needle in our spines and drain us dry. It _hurts_. Do you understand me? They're going to drain us, and then they're going to drink our spinal fluid, and it's going to _hurt_.\"  He was gently corrected. \"We shall make the Donation,\" Citizen Boyne said calmly. \"Is not the difference intelligible to a Son of the Wolf?\"  True culture demanded that that remark be accepted as a friendly joke, probably based on a truth--how else could an unpalatable truth be put in words? Otherwise the unthinkable might happen. They might quarrel. They might even come to blows!  The appropriate mild smile formed on Tropile's lips, but harshly he wiped it off. They were going to _kill_ him. He would _not_ smile for them! And the effort was enormous.  \"I'm _not_ a Son of the Wolf!\" he howled, desperate, knowing he was protesting to the man of all men in Wheeling who didn't care, and who could do least about it if he did. \"What's this crazy talk about Wolves? I don't know what a Son of the Wolf is and I don't think you or anybody does. All I know is that I was acting _sensibly_. And everybody began howling! You're supposed to know a Son of the Wolf by his unculture, his ignorance, his violence. But you chopped down three people and I only picked up a piece of bread! And _I'm_ supposed to be the dangerous one!\"  \"Wolves never know they're Wolves,\" sighed Citizen Boyne. \"Fish probably think they're birds and you evidently think you're a Citizen. Would a Citizen speak as you are speaking?\"  \"But they're going to kill us!\"  \"Then why aren't you composing your death poem?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Glenn Tropile took a deep breath. Something was biting him. It was bad enough that he was about to die, bad enough that he had done nothing worth dying for. But what was gnawing at him now had nothing to do with dying.  The percentages were going the wrong way. This pale Citizen was getting an edge on him.  An engorged gland in Tropile's adrenals--it was only a pinhead in Citizen Boyne's--gushed raw hormones into his bloodstream. He could die, yes--that was a skill everyone had to acquire, sooner or later. But while he was alive, he could not stand to be bested in an encounter, an argument, a relationship--not and stay alive. Wolf? Call him Wolf. Call him Operator, or Percentage Player; call him Sharp Article; call him Gamesman.  If there was an advantage to be derived, he would derive it. It was the way he was put together.  He said, for time: \"You're right. Stupid of me. I must have lost my head!\"  He thought. Some men think by poking problems apart; some think by laying facts side by side to compare. Tropile's thinking was neither of these, but a species of judo. He conceded to his opponent such things as Strength, Armor, Resource. He didn't need these things for himself; to every contest, the opponent brought enough of them to supply two. It was Tropile's habit (and Wolfish, he had to admit) to use the opponent's strength against him, to break the opponent against his own steel walls.  He thought.  The first thing was to make up his mind: He was Wolf. Then let him _be_ Wolf. He wouldn't stay around for the spinal tap; he would go from there. But how?  The second thing was to plan. There were obstacles. Citizen Boyne was one. The Keeper of the House of the Five Regulations was another.  Where was the pole which would permit him to vault over these hurdles? There was always his wife, Gala. He owned her; she would do what he wished--provided he made her _want_ to do it.  Yes, Gala. He walked to the door and shouted to Citizen Harmane: \"Keeper! I must see my wife! Have her brought to me!\"  It was impossible for the Keeper to refuse. He called gently, \"I will invite the Citizeness,\" and toddled away.  The third thing was time.  Tropile turned to Citizen Boyne. \"Citizen,\" he said persuasively, \"since your death poem is ready and mine is not, will you be gracious enough to go first when they--when they come?\"  Citizen Boyne looked temperately at his cellmate and made the Quirked Smile.  \"You see?\" he said. \"Wolf.\"  And that was true. But what was also true was that Boyne couldn't and didn't refuse.   IV  Half a world away, the midnight-blue Pyramid sat on its planed-off peak as it had sat since the days when Earth had a real sun of its own.  It was of no importance to the Pyramid that Glenn Tropile was about to receive a slim catheter into his spine, to drain his saps and his life. It didn't matter to the Pyramid that the pretext for the execution was an act which human history had long stopped considering a capital crime. Ritual sacrifice in any guise made no difference to the Pyramid.  The Pyramid saw them come and the Pyramid saw them go--if the Pyramid could be said to \"see.\" One human being more or less, what matter? Who bothers to take a census of the cells in a hangnail?  And yet the Pyramid did have a kind of interest in Glenn Tropile. Or, at least, in the human race of which he was a part.  Nobody knew much about the Pyramids, but everybody knew _that_ much. They wanted something--else why would they have bothered to steal the Earth?  The date of the theft was 2027. A great year--the year of the first landings on the Runaway Planet that had come blundering into the Solar System. Maybe those landings were a mistake--although they were a very great triumph, too; but maybe if it hadn't been for the landings, the Runaway Planet might have run right through the ecliptic and away.  However, the triumphal mistake was made and that was the first time a human eye saw a Pyramid.  Shortly after--though not before a radio message was sent--that human eye winked out forever; but by then the damage was done. What passed in a Pyramid for \"attention\" had been attracted. The next thing that happened set the wireless channels between Palomar and Pernambuco, between Greenwich and the Cape of Good Hope, buzzing and worrying, as astronomers all over the Earth reported and confirmed and reconfirmed the astonishing fact that our planet was on the move. Rejoice in Messias had come to take us away.  A world of ten billion people, some of them brilliant, many of them brave, built and flung the giant rockets of Operation Up at the invader: Nothing.  The first, and only, Interplanetary Expeditionary Force was boosted up to no-gravity and dropped onto the new planet to strike back: Nothing.  Earth moved spirally outward.  If a battle could not be won, then perhaps a migration. New ships were built in haste. But they lay there rusting as the sun grew small and the ice grew thick, because where was there to go? Not Mars. Not the Moon, which was trailing alone. Not choking Venus or crushing Jupiter.  The migration was defeated as surely as the war, there being no place to migrate to.  One Pyramid came to Earth, only one. It shaved the crest off the highest mountain there was and squatted on it. An observer? A warden? Whatever it was, it stayed.  The sun grew too distant to be of use, and out of the old Moon, the Pyramid aliens built a new small sun in the sky--a five-year sun that burned out and was replaced, again and again and endlessly again.  It had been a fierce struggle against unbeatable odds on the part of the ten billion; and when the uselessness of struggle was demonstrated at last, many of the ten billion froze to death, and many of them starved, and nearly all of the rest had something frozen or starved out of them; and what was left, two centuries and more later, was more or less like Citizen Boyne, except for a few--a very few--like Glenn Tropile.         *       *       *       *       *  Gala Tropile stared miserably at her husband. \"I want to get out of here,\" he was saying urgently. \"They mean to kill me. Gala, you know you can't make yourself suffer by letting them kill me!\"  She wailed: \"I _can't_!\"  Tropile looked over his shoulder. Citizen Boyne was fingering the textured contrasts of a golden watch-case which had been his father's--and soon would be his son's. Boyne's eyes were closed and he wasn't listening.  Tropile leaned forward and deliberately put his hand on his wife's arm. She started and flushed, of course.  \"You _can_,\" he said, \"and what's more, you will. You can help me get out of here. I insist on it, Gala, because I must save you that pain.\"  He took his hand off her arm, content.  He said harshly: \"Darling, don't you think I know how much we've always meant to each other?\"  She looked at him wretchedly. Fretfully she tore at the billowing filmy sleeve of her summer blouse. The seams hadn't been loosened; there had not been time. She had just been getting into the appropriate Sun Re-creation Day costume, to be worn under the parka, when the messenger had come with the news about her husband.  She avoided his eyes. \"If you're really Wolf....\"  Tropile's sub-adrenals pulsed and filled him with confident strength. \"_You_ know what I am--you better than anyone else.\" It was a sly reminder of their curious furtive behavior together; like the hand on her arm, it had its effect. \"After all, why do we quarrel the way we did last night?\"  He hurried on; the job of the rowel was to spur her to action, not to inflame a wound. \"Because we're _important_ to each other. I know that you would count on me to help if"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51845"],["title","Wolfbane (#5)"],["body"," were in trouble. And I know that you'd be hurt--_deeply_, Gala!--if I didn't count on you.\"  She sniffled and scuffed the bright strap over her open-toed sandal.  Then she met his eyes.  It was the after-effect of the argument, of course. Glenn Tropile knew just how heavily he could rely on the after-spiral of a quarrel. She was submitting.  She glanced furtively at Citizen Boyne and lowered her voice.  \"What do I have to do?\" she whispered.         *       *       *       *       *  In five minutes, she was gone, but that was more than enough time. Tropile had at least thirty minutes left. They would take Boyne first; he had seen to that. And once Boyne was gone--  Tropile wrenched a leg off his three-legged stool and sat precariously balanced on the other two. He tossed the loose leg clattering into a corner.  The Keeper of the House of Five Regulations ambled slack-bodied by and glanced into the room. \"Wolf, what happened to your stool?\"  Tropile made a left-handed sign of no-importance. \"It doesn't matter. Except it _is_ hard to meditate, sitting on this thing, with every muscle tensing and fighting against every other to keep my balance....\"  The Keeper made an overruling sign of please-let-me-help. \"It's your last half-hour, Wolf,\" he reminded Tropile. \"I'll fix the stool for you.\"  He entered and slammed and banged it together, and left with an expression of mild concern. Even a Son of the Wolf was entitled to the fullest appreciation of that unique opportunity for meditation, the last half-hour before a Donation.  In five minutes, the Keeper was back, looking solemn and yet glad, like a bearer of serious but welcome tidings.  \"It is the time for the first Donation,\" he announced. \"Which of you--\"  \"Him,\" said Tropile quickly, pointing.  Boyne opened his eyes calmly and nodded. He got to his feet, made a formal leavetaking bow to Tropile, and followed the Keeper toward his Donation and his death. As they were going out, Tropile coughed a would-you-please-grant-me-a-favor cough.  The Keeper paused. \"What is it, Wolf?\"  Tropile showed him the empty water pitcher--empty, all right; he had emptied it out the window.  \"My apologies,\" the Keeper said, flustered, and hurried Boyne along. He came back almost at once to fill the pitcher, even though he should be there to watch Boyne's ceremonial Donation.  Tropile stood looking at the Keeper, his sub-adrenals beginning to pound like the rolling boil of Well-aged Water. The Keeper was at a disadvantage. He had been neglectful of his charge--a broken stool, no water in the pitcher. And a Citizen, brought up in a Citizen's maze of consideration and tact, could not help but be humiliated, seeking to make amends.  Tropile pressed his advantage home. \"Wait,\" he said to the Keeper. \"I'd like to talk to you.\"  The Keeper hesitated, torn. \"The Donation--\"  \"Damn the Donation,\" Tropile said calmly. \"After all, what is it but sticking a pipe into a man's backbone and sucking out the juice that keeps him alive? It's killing, that's all.\"  The Keeper turned literally white. Tropile was speaking blasphemy and he wasn't stopping.  \"I want to tell you about my wife,\" Tropile went on, assuming a confidential air. \"Now there's a real _woman_. Not one of these frozen-up Citizenesses, you know? Why, she and I used to--\" He hesitated. \"You're a man of the world, aren't you?\" he demanded. \"I mean you've seen life.\"  \"I--suppose so,\" the Keeper said faintly.  \"Then you won't be shocked,\" Tropile lied. \"Well, let me tell you, there's a lot to women that these stuffed-shirt Citizens don't know about. Boy! Ever see a woman's knee?\" He sniggered. \"Ever kiss a woman with--\" he winked--\"with the _light on_? Ever sit in a big armchair, say, with a woman in your _lap_--all soft and heavy, and kind of warm, and slumped up against your chest, you know, and--\"  He stopped and swallowed. He was almost making himself retch, it was so hard to say these things. But he forced himself to go on: \"Well, that's what she and I used to do. Plenty. All the time. That's what I call a real _woman_.\"  He stopped, warned by the Keeper's sudden change of expression, glazed eyes, strangling breath. He had gone too far. He had only wanted to paralyze the man, revolt him, put him out of commission, but he was overdoing it. He jumped forward and caught the Keeper as he fell, fainting.         *       *       *       *       *  Tropile callously emptied the water pitcher over the man. The Keeper sneezed and sat up groggily. He focused his eyes on Tropile and agonizedly blushed.  Tropile said harshly: \"I wish to see the new sun from the street.\"  The request was incredible. Even after the unbelievable obscenities he had heard, the Keeper was not prepared for this; he was staggered. Tropile was in detention regarding the Fifth Regulation. That was all there was to it. Such persons were not to be released from their quarters. The Keeper knew it, the world knew it, Tropile knew it.  It was an obscenity even greater than the lurid tales of perverted lust, for Tropile had asked something which was impossible! No one _ever_ asked anything that was impossible to grant, for no one could ever refuse anything. That was utterly graceless, unthinkable.  One could only attempt to compromise. The Keeper stammeringly said: \"May I--may I let you see the new sun from the corridor?\" And even that was wretchedly wrong, but he had to offer something. One always offered something. The Keeper had never since babyhood given a flat no to anybody about anything. No Citizen had. A flat no led to anger, strong words--perhaps even hurt feelings. The only flat no conceivable was the enormous terminal no of an amok. Short of that--  One offered. One split the difference. One was invariably filled with tepid pleasure when, invariably, the offer was accepted, the difference was split, both parties were satisfied.  \"That will do for a start,\" Tropile snarled. \"Open, man, open! Don't make me wait.\"  The Keeper reeled and unlatched the door to the corridor.  \"Now the street!\"  \"I can't!\" burst in an anguished cry from the Keeper. He buried his face in his hands and began to sob, hopelessly incapacitated.  \"The street!\" Tropile said remorselessly. He himself felt wrenchingly ill; he was going against custom that had ruled his own life as surely as the Keeper's.  But he was Wolf. \"I _will_ be Wolf,\" he growled, and advanced upon the Keeper. \"My wife,\" he said, \"I didn't finish telling you. Sometimes she used to put her arm around me and just snuggle up and--I remember one time she kissed my ear. Broad daylight. It felt funny and warm--I can't describe it.\"  Whimpering, the Keeper flung the keys at Tropile and tottered brokenly away.  He was out of the action. Tropile himself was nearly as badly off; the difference was that he continued to function. The words coming from him had seared like acid in his throat.  \"They call me Wolf,\" he said aloud, reeling against the wall. \"I will be one.\"  He unlocked the outer door and his wife was waiting, holding in her arms the things he had asked her to bring.  Tropile said strangely to her: \"I am steel and fire. I am Wolf, full of the old moxie.\"  She wailed: \"Glenn, are you sure I'm doing the right thing?\"  He laughed unsteadily and led her by the arm through the deserted streets.   V  Citizen Germyn, as was his right by position and status as a connoisseur, helped prepare Citizen Boyne for his Donation. There was nothing much to it--which made it an elaborate and lengthy task, according to the ethic of the Citizens; it had to be protracted, each step being surrounded by fullest dress of ritual.  It was done in the broad daylight of the new Sun, and as many of the three hundred citizens of Wheeling as could manage it were in the courtyard of the old Federal Building to watch.  The nature of the ceremony was this: A man who revealed himself Wolf, or who finally crumbled under the demands of life and ran amok, could not be allowed to live. He was hauled before an audience of his equals and permitted--with the help of regretful force, if that should be necessary, but preferably not--to make the Donation of Spinal Fluid.  Execution was murder and murder was not permitted under the gentle code of Citizens; this was not execution. The draining of a man's spinal fluid did not kill him. It only insured that, after a time and with much suffering, his internal chemistry would so arrange itself that it would continue to function, only not in a way that would sustain life.  Once the Donation was made, the problem was completely altered, of course. Suffering was bad in itself. To save the Donor from the suffering that lay ahead, it was the custom to have the oldest and gentlest Citizen on hand stand by with a sharp-edged knife. When the Donation was complete, the Donor's head was removed--purely to avert suffering. That was not execution, either, but only the hastening of an inevitable end.  The dozen or so Citizens whose rank permitted them to assist then dissolved the spinal fluids in water and ceremoniously sipped them, at which time it was proper to offer a small poem in commentary. All in all, it was a perfectly splendid opportunity for the purest form of meditation for everyone concerned.  Citizen Germyn, whose role was Catheter Bearer, took his place behind the Introducer Bearer, the Annunciators and the Questioner of Purpose. As he passed Citizen Boyne, Germyn assisted him to assume the proper crouched-over position. Boyne looked up gratefully and Germyn found the occasion correct for a commendatory half-smile.  The Questioner of Purpose said solemnly to Boyne: \"It is your privilege to make a Donation here today. Do you wish to do so?\"  \"I do,\" said Boyne raptly. The anxiety had passed; clearly he was confident of making a good Donation. Germyn approved with all his heart.  The Annunciators, in alternate stanzas, announced the right pause for meditation to the meager crowd, and all fell silent. Citizen Germyn began"]]]
