You can work here a few days, sleep at my house, and we'll run the tests after dark.\"  He was old for an Earthling, well over sixty, with white hair and lined leathery face. But his blue eyes were as keen and steady, his gnarled hands as strong and sure as those of any young man. He spoke softly and steadily, around the pipe which rarely left his mouth, and there was a serenity in him which I could hardly associate with anarch fanaticism. But the first night he led me into his cellar, and through a well-hidden trapdoor to a room below, and there he had a complete psychological laboratory.  I gaped at the gleaming apparatus. \"How off Earth--\"  \"It came piece by piece, much of it from Epsilon Eridani itself,\" he smiled. \"There is, after all, no ban on humans owning such material. But to play safe, we spread the purchases over several years, and made them in the names of many people.\"  \"But you--\"  \"I took a degree in psychiatry once. I can handle this.\"  He could. He put me through the mill in the next few nights--intelligence tests, psychometry, encephalography, narcosis, psycho-probing, everything his machines and his skill could cover. He did not find out anything we hadn't meant to be found out. The Service had ways of guarding its agents with counter-blocks. But he got a very thorough picture of Conrad Haugen.  In the end he said, still calmly, \"This is amazing. You have an IQ well over the borderline of genius, an astonishing variety of assorted knowledge about the Empire and about technical subjects, and an implacable hatred of Eridanian rule--based on personal pique and containing self-seeking elements, but no less firm for that. You're out for yourself, but you'll stand by your comrades and your cause. We'd never hoped for more recruits of your caliber.\"  \"When do I start?\" I asked impatiently.  \"Easy, easy,\" he smiled. \"There's time. We've waited fifty years; we can wait a while longer.\" He riffled through the dossier. \"Actually, the difficulty is where to assign you. A man who knows astrogation, the use of weapons and machines, and the Empire, who is physically strong as a bull, can lead men, and has a dozen other accomplishments, really seems wasted on any single job. I'm not sure, but I think you'll do best as a roving agent, operating between Main Base and the planets where we have cells, and helping with the work at the base when you're there.\"         *       *       *       *       *  My heart fairly leaped into my throat. This was more than _I_ had dared hope for!  \"I think,\" said Nat Hawkins, \"you'd better just drop out of sight now. Go to Hood Island and stay there till the spaceship comes next time. You can spend the interval profitably, resting and getting a little fattened up; you look half starved. And Barbara can tell you about the Legion.\" His leather face smiled itself into a mesh of fine wrinkles. \"I think you deserve that, Conrad. And so does Barbara.\"  Mentally, I shrugged. My stay in New Chicago had pretty well convinced me that all Earthling females were sluts. And what of it?  The following night, Hawkins and I rowed out to Hood Island. It lay about a mile offshore, a wooded, rocky piece of land on which a moon-whitened surf boomed and rattled. The place had belonged to the Hood family since the first settlements here, but Barbara was the last of them.  Hawkins' voice came softly to me above the crash of surf, the surge of waves and windy roar of trees as we neared the dock. \"She has more reason than most to hate the Eridanians. The Hoods used to be great people around here. They were just about ruined when the redskins first came a-conquering, space bombardment wiped out their holdings, but they made a new start. Then her grandfather and all his brothers were killed in the revolt. Ten years ago, her father was caught while trying to hijack a jetload of guns, and her mother didn't live long after that. Then her brother was drafted into a road crew and reported killed in an accident. Since then she hasn't lived for much except the Legion.\"  \"I don't blame her,\" I said. My voice was a little tight, for indeed I didn't. But somebody has to suffer; civilization has a heavy price. I couldn't help adding, \"But the Empire's lately begun paying pensions to cases like that.\"  \"I know. She draws hers, too, and uses it for the Legion.\"  _That, of course, was the reason for the pensions._  The boat bumped against the dock. Hawkins threw the painter up to the man who suddenly emerged from the shadow. I saw the cold silver moonlight gleam off the rifle in his hand. \"You know me, Eb,\" said Hawkins. \"This here's Con Haugen. I slipped you the word about him.\"  \"Glad to know you, Con.\" Eb's horny palm clasped mine. I liked his looks, as I did those of most of the higher-up Legionnaires. They were altogether different from the low-caste barbarians who were all the rebels I'd seen before. They had a great load of ignorance to drag with them.  We went up a garden path to a rambling stone house. Inside, it was long and low and filled with the memoirs of more gracious days, art and fine furniture, books lining the walls, a fire crackling ruddily in the living room.  \"Barbara Hood--Conrad Haugen.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Almost, I gaped at her. I had expected some gaunt, dowdy fanatic, a little mad perhaps. But she was--well, she was tall and supple and clad in a long dark-blue evening gown that shimmered against her white skin. She was not conventionally pretty, her face was too strong for all of its fine lines, but she had huge blue eyes and a wide soft mouth and a stubborn chin. The light glowed gold on the hair that tumbled to her shoulders.  I blurted something out and she smiled, with a curious little twist that somehow caught in me, and said merely, \"Hello, Conrad.\"  \"Glad to be here,\" I mumbled.  \"The spaceship should arrive in a month or so,\" she went on. \"I'll teach you as much as I can in that time. And you'd better get your own special knowledge onto a record wire, just in case. I understand you've been in the Vegan System, for instance, which nobody else in the Legion knows very much about.\"  Her tone was cool and business-like, but with an underlying warmth. It was like the sea wind which blew over the islands, and as reviving. I recovered myself and helped mix some drinks. The rest of the evening passed very pleasantly.  Later a servant showed me to my room, a big one overlooking the water. I lay for a while listening to the waves, thinking drowsily how rebellion, when its motives were honest, drew in the best natives of any world, and presently I fell asleep.  The month passed all too quickly and agreeably. I learned things which Intelligence had spent the last three years trying to find out, and dared not attempt to transmit the information. That was maddening, though I knew there was time. But otherwise--  I puttered about the place. There were only three servants, old family retainers who had also joined the anarchs. They had little modern machinery, and of course Earthlings weren't allowed robots, so there was need for an extra man or two. I cut wood and repaired the roof and painted the boathouse, spaded the garden and cleared out brush and set up a new picket fence. It was good to use my hands and muscles again.  And then Barbara was around to help with most of what I did. In jeans and jersey, the sun ablaze on her hair, laughing at my clumsy jokes or frowning over some tough bit of work, she was another being than the cool, lovely woman who talked books and music and history with me in the evenings, or the crisp bitter anarch who spat facts and figures at me like an angry machine. And yet they were all her. I remembered Ydis, who was dead, and the old pain stirred again. But Barbara was alive.  She was more alive to me than most of Valgolia.  I make no apologies for my feelings. I had been away from anything resembling home for some two years now. But I was careful to remain merely friendly with Barbara.         *       *       *       *       *  She didn't know a great deal about the rebel movement--no one agent on Earth did--but her knowledge was still considerable. There was a fortified base somewhere out in space, built up over a period of four years with the help of certain unnamed elements or planets outside the Empire. I suspected several rival states of that!  Weapons of all kinds were manufactured there in quantities sufficient to arm the million or so rebels of the \"regular\" force, the twenty million or so in the Solar System and elsewhere who held secret drills and conducted terrorist activities, and the many millions more who were expected to rise spontaneously when the rebel fleet struck.  There was close coordination and a central command at Main Base for the undergrounds of all dissatisfied planets--a new and formidable feature which had not been present in the earlier uprisings. There were rumors of a new and terrible weapon being developed.  In any case, the plan was to assault Epsilon Eridani itself simultaneously with the uprisings in the colonies, so that the Imperial fleet would be recalled to defend the mother world. The anarchs hoped to blast Valgolia to ruin in a few swift blows, and expected that the Empire's jealous neighbors would sweep in to complete the wreckage.  This gentle girl spoke of the smashing of worlds, the blasting of helpless humans, and the destruction of a culture as if it were a matter of insect extermination.  \"Have you ever thought,\" I asked casually once, \"that the Juranians and the Slighs and our other hypothetical allies may not respect the integrity of Sol any more than the Eridanians do?\"  \"We can handle them,\" she answered confidently. \"Oh, it won't be easy, that time of transition. But we'll be free.\"  \"And what then?\" I went on. \"I don't want to be defeatist, Barbara, but you know as well as I do that the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51184"],["title","Inside Earth (#4)"],["body","didn't conquer all mankind at a single swoop. When they invented the interstellar engine and arrived here, man was tearing the Solar System apart in a war between super-nations that was rapidly reducing him to barbarism. The redskins traded for a while, sold arms, some of their adventurers took sides in the conflict, the government stepped in to protect Eridanian citizens and investments--the side which the Eridanians helped won the war, then found its allies were running things and tried to revolt against the protectorate--and without really meaning to, the strangers were conquering and ruling Earth.  \"But the different factions of man still hate each other's guts. There are still capitalists and communists, blacks, whites and Browns, Hindus and Moslems, Germans and Frenchmen, city people and country people--a million petty divisions. There'll be civil war as soon as the Eridanians are gone.\"  \"Some, perhaps,\" she agreed. \"But I think it can be handled. If we have to have civil wars, well, let's get them over with and live as free men.\"  Personally, I could see nothing in the sort of military dictatorship that would inevitably arise which was preferable to an alien, firm, but just rule that insured stability and a reasonable degree of individual liberty.  But I didn't say that aloud.         *       *       *       *       *  Another time we talked of the de-industrialization of Earth. Barbara was, of course, venomous about it. \"We were rich once,\" she said. \"All Earth was. We have one of the richest planets in the Galaxy. But because their own world is poor, the redskins have to take the natural resources of their conquests. Earth is a granary and a lumberyard for Valgolia, and the iron of Mars and the petrolite of Venus go back to their industry. What few factories they allow us, they take their fat percentage of the product.\"  \"Certainly they've made us economically dependent,\" I said, \"and their standard of living is undoubtedly higher than ours. But ours has, on the whole, gone up since the conquest. We eat better, we're healthier, we aren't burdened with the cost of past and present and future wars. Our natural resources aren't being squandered. The forests and watersheds and farmlands we ruined are coming back under Eridanian supervision.\"  She gave me an odd look. \"I thought you didn't like the Empire.\"  \"I don't,\" I growled. \"I don't want to be held back just because I'm white-skinned. But I've known enough reddies personally so that I try to be fair.\"  \"It's all right with me,\" she said. \"I can see your point, intellectually, though I can't really _feel_ it. But not many of the people will out at Main Base.\"  \"Free men,\" I muttered sardonically.  We went fishing, and swam in the tumbling surf, and stretched lazily on the beach with the sun pouring over us. Or we might go tramping off into the woods on a picnic, to run laughing back when a sudden rain rushed out of the sky, and afterward sit with beer and cheese sandwiches listening to a wire of Beethoven or Mozart or Tchaikovsky--the old Earthlings could write music, if they did nothing else!--and to the rain shouting on the roof. We might have a little highly illegal target practice, or a game of chess, or long conversations which wandered off every which way. I began to have a sneaking hope that the spaceship would be delayed.  We went out one day in Barbara's little catboat. The waves danced around us, chuckling against the hull, glittering with sunlight, and the sail was like a snow mountain against the sky. For a while we chatted dreamily, ate our lunch, threw the scraps to the hovering gulls. Then Barbara fell silent.  \"What's the matter?\" I asked.  \"Oh, nothing. Touch of _Weltschmerz_, maybe.\" She smiled at me. \"You know, Con, you don't really belong in the Legion.\"  \"How so?\" I raised my eyebrows.  \"You--well, you're so darned honest, so really decent under that carefully rough surface, so--reasonable. You'll never make a good fanatic.\"  _Honest!_ I looked away from her. The bright day seemed suddenly to darken.   IV  Spaceships from Main Base had little trouble coming to Earth with their cargoes of guns, propaganda, instructors, and whatever else the rebels on the planet needed. They would take up an orbit just beyond the atmosphere and send boats to the surface after dark. There was little danger of their being detected if they took the usual precautions; a world is simply too big to blockade completely.  Ours dropped on noiseless gravitic beams into the nighted island woods. We had been watching for it the last few days, and now Eb came running to tell us it was here. The pilot followed after him.  \"Harry Kane, Conrad Haugen,\" Barbara introduced us.  I shook hands, sizing him up. He was tall for an Earthling, almost as big as I, dark-haired, with good-looking young features. He wore some approximation of a uniform, dark-blue tunic and breeches, peaked cap, captain's insignia, which gave him a rather dashing look. It shouldn't have made any difference to me, of course, but I didn't like the way he smiled at Barbara.  She explained my presence, and he nodded eagerly. \"Glad to have you, Haugen. We need good men, and badly.\" Then to her: \"Get Hawkins. You and he are recalled to Main Base.\"  \"What? But--\"  A dark exultation lit his face. \"The time for action is near--very near! We're pulling all our best agents off the planets. They can work more effectively with the fleet now.\"  I tried to look as savagely gleeful as they, but inwardly I groaned. How in all the hells was I going to contact Vorka? If I were stranded out in space when the fleet got under way--no, they must have an ultrabeam. I'd manage somehow to call on that even if they caught me at it.  We sent Eb in a boat to get Hawkins while Barbara and I packed a few necessities. Kane paced back and forth, spilling out the news from Main Base, word of mighty forces gathering, rumors of help promised from outside, it was like the thunder which mutters just before a gale.  Presently Hawkins arrived. The old man's calm was undisturbed: he puffed his pipe and said quietly, \"I called up my housekeeper, told her my sister in California was suddenly taken sick and I was leaving at once for the transcontinental jetport. Just to account for disappearing, you know. There aren't any Eridanians or Terries hereabouts, but we desperate characters--\" he grinned, briefly--\"can't be too careful. Brought my equipment along, of course. I suppose they want me to do psychometry on fleet personnel?\"  \"Something on that order. I don't know.\"  We made our way through a fine drizzle of rain to the little torpedo of the spaceboat. I looked around into the misty dark and breathed a deep lungful of the cool wet wind. And I saw that Barbara was doing the same.         *       *       *       *       *  She smiled up at me through the night and the thin sad rain. \"Earth is a beautiful world, Con,\" she whispered. \"I wonder if we'll ever see it again.\"  I squeezed her hand, silently, and we crowded into the boat.  Kane made a smooth takeoff. In minutes we were beyond the atmosphere, Earth was a great glowing shield of cloudy blue behind us, and the stars were bitter bright against darkness. We sent a coded call signal and got a directional beam from the ship. Before long we were approaching it.  I studied the lean black cruiser. She seemed to be of about the same design as the old Solarian interplanetary ships, modified somewhat to accommodate the star drive. Apparently, she was one of those built at Main Base. Her bow guns were dark shadows against the clotted cold silver of the Milky Way. I thought of the death and the ruin which could flame from them, I thought of the hell she and her kind bore--atomic bombs, radiodust bombs, chemical bombs, disease bombs, gravity snatchers, needle beams, disintegrative shells, darkness and doom and the new barbarism--and felt a stiffening within me. Fostering this murderousness was a frightful risk. The main defense against it was Intelligence, and that depended on agents like myself. Perhaps _only_ myself.  The crew was rather small, no battles being anticipated. But they were well disciplined, uniformed and trained, a new Solarian army built up from the fragments of the old. The captain was a stiff gray German who had been a leader in the earlier revolt and since fled to space, but most of the officers, such as Kane, were young and violent in their eagerness.  We orbited around the planet for another day or so till all the boats had returned. There was tension in the ship--if the Imperial navy should happen to spot us, we were done. Off duty, we would sit around talking, smoking, playing games with little concentration.  Kane spent most of his free hours with Barbara. They had much to talk about. I swallowed a certain irrational jealousy and wandered around cautiously pumping as many men as I could.  We got under way at last. By this time I had learned that Main Base was a planet, but no more. Only the highest leadership of the Legion knew its location, and they were pledged to swallow the poison they always carried if there seemed to be any danger of capture.  For several days by the clocks we ran outward, roughly toward Draco. Our velocity was not revealed, and the slow shift in the outside view didn't help much. I guess that we had come perhaps ten parsecs, but that was only a guess.  \"_Approaching Main Base. Stand by._\"         *       *       *       *       *  When the call rang hollowly down the ship's passageways, I could feel the weariness and tautness easing, I could see homecoming in the faces around me. I stole a glance at Barbara. Her eyes were wide and her lips parted, she looked ahead as if to stare through the metal walls. She had never been here either, here where all her dreams came home.  So we landed, we slipped down out of the dark and the cold and the void, and I heard the rattle and groan of metal easing into place. When the ship's interior grav-field "]]]
