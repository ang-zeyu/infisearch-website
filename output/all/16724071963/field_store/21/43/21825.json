The ground-repulsor unit is on. She heaves up, like she is grunting, and goes bulging up into the air, and the humming gets deeper and deeper, and fainter and fainter--and suddenly there's a keen whistling and she's gone. It's all very normal. Nobody would guess that this is the last time but one a Earth ship will ever lift off Moklin!  Inspector Caldwell taps her foot, icy. \"When will you send for Mr. Brooks?\" she demands.  \"Right away,\" I says to her. \"Deeth--\"  \"I sent a runner for him, ma'am,\" says Deeth. \"If he was in hearing of the ship's landing, he may be on the way here now.\"  He bows and goes in the trade room. There are Moklins that came to see the ship land, and now have tramped over to do some trading. Inspector Caldwell jumps.  \"Wh-what's that?\" she asks, tense.  The trees that crowded off the field to make room for the _Palmyra_ are waddling back. I realize for the first time that it might look funny to somebody just landed on Moklin. They are regular-looking trees, in a way. They got bark and branches and so on. Only they can put their roots down into holes they make in the ground, and that's the way they stay, mostly. But they can move. Wild ones, when there's a water shortage or they get too crowded or mad with each other, they pull up their roots and go waddling around looking for a better place to take root in.  The trees on our landing field have learned that every so often a ship is going to land and they've got to make room for it. But now the ship is gone, and they're lurching back to their places. The younger ones are waddling faster than the big ones, though, and taking the best places, and the old grunting trees are waving their branches indignant and puffing after them mad as hell.  I explain what is happening. Inspector Caldwell just stares. Then Sally comes lumbering up. I got a friendly feeling for Sally. She's pretty old--her trunk is all of three feet thick--but she always puts out a branch to shade my window in the morning, and I never let any other tree take her place. She comes groaning up, and uncoils her roots, and sticks them down one by one into the holes she'd left, and sort of scrunches into place and looks peaceful.  \"Aren't they--dangerous?\" asks Inspector Caldwell, pretty uneasy.  \"Not a bit,\" I says. \"Things can change on Moklin. They don't have to fight. Things fight in other places because they can't change and they get crowded, and that's the only way they can meet competition. But there's a special kind of evolution on Moklin. Cooperative, you might call it. It's a nice place to live. Only thing is everything matures so fast. Four years and a Moklin is grown up, for instance.\"  She sniffs. \"What about that other trading post?\" she says, sharp. \"Who's back of it? The Company is supposed to have exclusive trading rights here. Who's trespassing?\"  \"Brooks is trying to find out,\" I says. \"They got a good complete line of trade goods, but the Moklins always say the humans running the place have gone off somewhere, hunting and such. We ain't seen any of them.\"  \"No?\" says the girl, short. \"_I'll_ see them! We can't have competition in our exclusive territory! The rest of Mr. Brooks' reports--\" She stops. Then she says, \"That clerk of yours reminds me of someone I know.\"  \"He's a Moklin,\" I explain, \"but he looks like a Company man named Casey. Casey's Area Director over on Khatim Two now, but he used to be here, and Deeth is the spit and image of him.\"  \"Outrageous!\" says Inspector Caldwell, looking disgusted.  There's a couple of trees pushing hard at each other. They are fighting, tree-fashion, for a specially good place. And there's others waddling around, mad as hell, because somebody else beat them to the spots they liked. I watch them. Then I grin, because a couple of young trees duck under the fighting big ones and set their roots down in the place the big trees was fighting over.  \"I don't like your attitude!\" says Inspector Caldwell, furious.  She goes stamping into the post, leaving me puzzled. What's wrong with me smiling at those kid trees getting the best of their betters?         *       *       *       *       *  That afternoon Brooks comes back, marching ahead of a pack of woods-Moklins with greenish skins and saucer eyes that've been guiding him around. He's a good-looking kind of fellow, Brooks is, with a good build and a solid jaw.  When he comes out of the woods on the landing field--the trees are all settled down by then--he's striding impatient and loose-jointed. With the woods-Moklins trailing him, he looks plenty dramatic, like a visi-reel picture of a explorer on some unknown planet, coming back from the dark and perilous forests, followed by the strange natives who do not yet know whether this visitor from outer space is a god or what. You know the stuff.  I see Inspector Caldwell take a good look at him, and I see her eyes widen. She looks like he is a shock, and not a painful one.  He blinks when he sees her. He grunts. \"What's this? A she-Moklin?\"  Inspector Caldwell draws herself up to her full five-foot-three. She bristles.  I say quick, \"This here is Inspector Caldwell that the _Palmyra_ dumped off here today. Uh--Inspector, this is Brooks, the Head Trader.\"  They shake hands. He looks at her and says, \"I'd lost hope my reports would ever get any attention paid to them. You've come to check my report that the trading post on Moklin has to be abandoned?\"  \"I have not!\" says Inspector Caldwell, sharp. \"That's absurd! This planet has great potentialities, this post is profitable and the natives are friendly, and the trade should continue to increase. The Board is even considering the introduction of special crops.\"  That strikes me as a bright idea. I'd like to see what would happen if Moklins started cultivating new kinds of plants! It would be a thing to watch--with regular Moklin plants seeing strangers getting good growing places and special attention! I can't even guess what'll happen, but I want to watch!  \"What I want to ask right off,\" says Inspector Caldwell, fierce, \"is why you have allowed a competitive trading post to be established, why you did not report it sooner, and why you haven't identified the company back of it?\"  Brooks stares at her. He gets mad.  \"Hell!\" he says. \"My reports cover all that! Haven't you read them?\"  \"Of course not,\" says Inspector Caldwell. \"I was given an outline of the situation here and told to investigate and correct it.\"  \"Oh!\" says Brooks. \"That's it!\"  Then he looks like he's swallowing naughty words. It is funny to see them glare at each other, both of them looking like they are seeing something that interests them plenty, but throwing off angry sparks just the same.  \"If you'll show me samples of their trade goods,\" says Inspector Caldwell, arrogant, \"and I hope you can do _that_ much, I'll identify the trading company handling them!\"  He grins at her without amusement and leads the way to the inside of the trading post. We bring out the stuff we've had some of our Moklins go over and buy for us. Brooks dumps the goods on a table and stands back to see what she'll make of them, grinning with the same lack of mirth. She picks up a visi-reel projector.  \"Hmm,\" she says, scornful. \"Not very good quality. It's....\" Then she stops. She picks up a forest knife. \"This,\" she says, \"is a product of--\" Then she stops again. She picks up some cloth and fingers it. She really steams. \"I see!\" she says, angry. \"Because we have been on this planet so long and the Moklins are used to our goods, the people of the other trading post _duplicate_ them! Do they cut prices?\"  \"Fifty per cent,\" says Brooks.  I chime in, \"But we ain't lost much trade. Lots of Moklins still trade with us, out of friendship. Friendly folks, these Moklins.\"  Just then Deeth comes in, looking just like Casey that used to be here on Moklin. He grins at me.  \"A girl just brought you a compliment,\" he lets me know.  \"Shucks!\" I says, embarrassed and pleased. \"Send her in and get a present for her.\"  Deeth goes out. Inspector Caldwell hasn't noticed. She's seething over that other trading company copying our trade goods and underselling us on a planet we're supposed to have exclusive. Brooks looks at her grim.  \"I shall look over their post,\" she announces, fierce, \"and if they want a trade war, they'll get one! We can cut prices if we need to--we have all the resources of the Company behind us!\"  Brooks seems to be steaming on his own, maybe because she hasn't read his reports. But just then a Moklin girl comes in. Not bad-looking, either. You can see she is a Moklin--she ain't as convincing human as Deeth is, say--but she looks pretty human, at that. She giggles at me.  \"Compliment,\" she says, and shows me what she's carrying.  I look. It's a Moklin kid, a boy, just about brand-new. And it has my shape ears, and its nose looks like somebody had stepped on it--my nose is that way--and it looks like a very small-sized working model of me. I chuck it under the chin and say, \"Kitchy-coo!\" It gurgles at me.  \"What's your name?\" I ask the girl.  She tells me. I don't remember it, and I don't remember ever seeing her before, but she's paid me a compliment, all right--Moklin-style.  \"Mighty nice,\" I say. \"Cute as all get-out. I hope he grows up to have more sense than I got, though.\" Then Deeth comes in with a armload of trade stuff like Old Man Bland gave to the first Moklin kid that was born with long whiskers like his, and I say, \"Thanks for the compliment. I am greatly honored.\"  She takes the stuff and giggles again, and goes out. The kid beams at me over her shoulder and waves its fist. Mighty humanlike. A right cute kid, any way you look at it.  Then I hear a noise. Inspector Caldwell is regarding me with loathing in her eyes.  \"Did you say they were friendly creatures?\" she asks, bitter. \"I think affectionate would be a better word!\" Her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51752"],["title","If You Was a Moklin (#2)"],["body","shakes. \"You are going to be transferred out of here the instant the _Palmyra_ gets back!\"  \"What's the matter?\" I ask, surprised. \"She paid me a compliment and I gave her a present. It's a custom. She's satisfied. I never see her before that I remember.\"  \"You _don't_?\" she says. \"The--the _callousness_! You're revolting!\"  Brooks begins to sputter, then he snickers, and all of a sudden he's howling with laughter. He is laughing at Inspector Caldwell. Then I get it, and I snort. Then I hoot and holler. It gets funnier when she gets madder still. She near blows up from being mad!  We must look crazy, the two of us there in the post, just hollering with laughter while she gets furiouser and furiouser. Finally I have to lay down on the floor to laugh more comfortable. You see, she doesn't get a bit of what I've told her about there being a special kind of evolution on Moklin. The more disgusted and furious she looks at me, the harder I have to laugh. I can't help it.         *       *       *       *       *  When we set out for the other trading post next day, the atmosphere ain't what you'd call exactly cordial. There is just the Inspector and me, with Deeth and a couple of other Moklins for the look of things. She has on a green forest suit, and with her red hair she sure looks good! But she looks at me cold when Brooks says I'll take her over to the other post, and she doesn't say a word the first mile or two.  We trudge on, and presently Deeth and the others get ahead so they can't hear what she says. And she remarks indignant, \"I must say Mr. Brooks isn't very cooperative. Why didn't he come with me? Is he afraid of the men at the other post?\"  \"Not him,\" I says. \"He's a good guy. But you got authority over him and you ain't read his reports.\"  \"If I have authority,\" she says, sharp, \"I assure you it's because I'm competent!\"  \"I don't doubt it,\" I says. \"If you wasn't cute, he wouldn't care. But a man don't want a good-looking girl giving him orders. He wants to give them to her. A homely woman, it don't matter.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She tosses her head, but it don't displease her. Then she says, \"What's in the reports that I should have read?\"  \"I don't know,\" I admit. \"But he's been sweating over them. It makes him mad that nobody bothered to read 'em.\"  \"Maybe,\" she guesses, \"it was what I need to know about this other trading post. What do you know about it, Mr. Brinkley?\"  I tell her what Deeth has told Brooks. Brooks found out about it because one day some Moklins come in to trade and ask friendly why we charge so much for this and that. Deeth told them we'd always charged that, and they say the other trading post sells things cheaper, and Deeth says what trading post? So they up and tell him there's another post that sells the same kind of things we do, only cheaper. But that's all they'll say.  So Brooks tells Deeth to find out, and he scouts around and comes back. There is another trading post only fifteen miles away, and it is selling stuff just like ours. And it charges only half price. Deeth didn't see the men--just the Moklin clerks. We ain't been able to see the men either.  \"Why haven't you seen the men?\"  \"Every time Brooks or me go over,\" I explain, \"the Moklins they got working for them say the other men are off somewhere. Maybe they're starting some more posts. We wrote 'em a note, asking what the hell they mean, but they never answered it. Of course, we ain't seen their books or their living quarters--\"  \"You could find out plenty by a glimpse at their books!\" she snaps. \"Why haven't you just marched in and made the Moklins show you what you want to know, since the men were away?\"  \"Because,\" I says, patient, \"Moklins imitate humans. If we start trouble, they'll start it too. We can't set a example of rough stuff like burglary, mayhem, breaking and entering, manslaughter, or bigamy, or those Moklins will do just like us.\"  \"Bigamy!\" She grabs on that sardonic. \"If you're trying to make me think you've got enough moral sense--\"  I get a little mad. Brooks and me, we've explained to her, careful, how it is admiration _and_ the way evolution works on Moklin that makes Moklin kids get born with long whiskers and that the compliment the Moklin girl has paid me is just exactly that. But she hasn't listened to a word.  \"Miss Caldwell,\" I says, \"Brooks and me told you the facts. We tried to tell them delicate, to spare your feelings. Now if you'll try to spare mine, I'll thank you.\"  \"If you mean your finer feelings,\" she says, sarcastic, \"I'll spare them as soon as I find some!\"  So I shut up. There's no use trying to argue with a woman. We tramp on through the forest without a word. Presently we come on a nest-bush. It's a pretty big one. There are a couple dozen nests on it, from the little-bitty bud ones no bigger than your fist, to the big ripe ones lined with soft stuff that have busted open and have got cacklebirds housekeeping in them now.  There are two cacklebirds sitting on a branch by the nest that is big enough to open up and have eggs laid in it, only it ain't. The cacklebirds are making noises like they are cussing it and telling it to hurry up and open, because they are in a hurry.  \"That's a nest-bush,\" I says. \"It grows nests for the cacklebirds. The birds--uh--fertilize the ground around it. They're sloppy feeders and drop a lot of stuff that rots and is fertilizer too. The nest-bush and the cacklebirds kind of cooperate. That's the way evolution works on Moklin, like Brooks and me told you.\"  She tosses that red head of hers and stamps on, not saying a word. So we get to the other trading post. And there she gets one of these slow-burning, long-lasting mads on that fill a guy like me with awe.  There's only Moklins at the other trading post, as usual. They say the humans are off somewhere. They look at her admiring and polite. They show her their stock. It is practically identical with ours--only they admit that they've sold out of some items because their prices are low. They act most respectful and pleased to see her.  But she don't learn a thing about where their stuff comes from or what company is horning in on Moklin trade. And she looks at their head clerk and she burns and burns.         *       *       *       *       *  When we get back, Brooks is sweating over memorandums he has made, getting another report ready for the next Company ship. Inspector Caldwell marches into the trade room and gives orders in a controlled, venomous voice. Then she marches right in on Brooks.  \"I have just ordered the Moklin sales force to cut the price on all items on sale by seventy-five per cent,\" she says, her voice trembling a little with fury. \"I have also ordered the credit given for Moklin trade goods to be doubled. They want a trade war? They'll get it!\"         *       *       *       *       *  She is a lot madder than business would account for. Brooks says, tired, \"I'd like to show you some facts. I've been over every inch of territory in thirty miles, looking for a place where a ship could land for that other post. There isn't any. Does that mean anything to you?\"  \"The post is there, isn't it?\" she says. \"And they have trade goods, haven't they? And we have exclusive trading rights on Moklin, haven't we? That's enough for me. Our job is to drive them out of business!\"  But she is a lot madder than business would account for. Brooks says, very weary, \"There's nearly a whole planet where they could have put another trading post. They could have set up shop on the other hemisphere and charged any price they pleased. But they set up shop right next to us! Does _that_ make sense?\"  \"Setting up close,\" she says, \"would furnish them with customers already used to human trade goods. And it furnished them with Moklins trained to be interpreters and clerks! And--\" Then it come out, what she's raging, boiling, steaming, burning up about. \"And,\" she says, furious, \"it furnished them with a Moklin head-clerk who is a very handsome young man, Mr. Brooks! He not only resembles you in every feature, but he even has a good many of your mannerisms. You should be very proud!\"  With this she slams out of the room. Brooks blinks.  \"She won't believe anything,\" he says, sour, \"except only that man is vile. Is that true about a Moklin who looks like me?\"  I nod.  \"Funny his folks never showed him to me for a compliment-present!\" Then he stares at me, hard. \"How good is the likeness?\"  \"If he is wearing your clothes,\" I tell him, truthful, \"I'd swear he is you.\"  Then Brooks--slow, very slow--turns white. \"Remember the time you went off with Deeth and his folks, hunting? That was the time a Moklin got killed. You were wearing guest garments, weren't you?\"  I feel queer inside, but I nod. Guest garments, for Moklins, are like the best bedroom and the drumstick of the chicken among humans. And a Moklin hunting party is something. They go hunting _garlikthos_, which you might as well call dragons, because they've got scales and they fly and they are tough babies.  The way to hunt them is you take along some cacklebirds that ain't nesting--they are no good for anything while they're honeymooning--and the cacklebirds go flapping around until a _garlikthos_ comes after them, and then they go jet-streaking to where the hunters are, cackling a blue streak to say, \"Here I come, boys! Hold everything until I get past!\" Then the _garlikthos_ dives after them and the hunters get it as it dives.  You give the cacklebirds its innards, and they sit around and eat, cackling to each other, zestful, like they're bragging about the other times they done the same thing, only better.  \"You were wearing guest garments?\" repeats Brooks, grim.  I feel very queer inside, but I nod again. Moklin guest garments are mighty easy on the skin and feel mighty good. They ain't exactly practical hunting clothes, but the Moklins feel bad if a human that's their guest don't wear them. And of course he"]]]
