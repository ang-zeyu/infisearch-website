At first, despite the lack of success in straightening the bent metal of the scout bottom, there had been a subdued exhilaration in reporting each new discovery concerning the symbiote, but as time passed, his enthusiasm ebbed. His one really important problem was how to repair the scout and he was fast becoming discouraged.  At last Kaiser could bear the futility of his efforts no longer. He sent out a terse message to the _Soscites II_:      TAKING SHORT TRIP TO ANOTHER LOCATION ON RIVER. HOPE TO FIND MORE     INTELLIGENT NATIVES. COULD BE THAT THE SETTLEMENT I FOUND HERE IS     ANALOGOUS TO TRIBE OF MONKEYS ON EARTH. I KNOW THE CHANCE IS SMALL,     BUT WHAT HAVE I TO LOSE? I CAN'T FIX SCOUT WITHOUT BETTER TOOLS,     AND IF MY GUESS IS RIGHT, I MAY BE ABLE TO GET EQUIPMENT. EXPECT TO     RETURN IN TEN OR TWELVE HOURS. PLEASE KEEP CONTACT WITH SCOUT.      SMOKY  Kaiser packed a mudsled with tent, portable generator and guard wires, a spare sidearm and ammunition, and food for two days. He had noticed that a range of high hills, which caused the bend in the river at the native settlement, seemed to continue its long curve, and he wondered if the hills might not turn the river in the shape of a giant horseshoe. He intended to find out.  Wrapping his equipment in a plastic tarp, Kaiser eased it out the doorway and tied it on the sled. He hooked a towline to a harness on his shoulders and began his journey--in the opposite direction from the first native settlement.  He walked for more than seven hours before he found that his surmise had been correct. And a second cluster of huts, and seal-people in the river, greeted his sight. He received a further pleasant surprise. This group was decidedly more advanced than the first!  They were little different in actual physical appearance; the change was mainly noticeable in their actions and demeanor. And their odor was more subdued, less repugnant.  By signs, Kaiser indicated that he came in peace, and they seemed to understand. A thick-bodied male went solemnly to the river bank and called to a second, who dived and brought up a mouthful of weed. The first male took the weed and brought it to Kaiser. This was obviously a gesture of friendship.  The weed had a white starchy core and looked edible. Kaiser cleaned part of it with his handkerchief, bit and chewed it.  The weed had a slight iron taste, but was not unpalatable. He swallowed the mouthful and tried another. He ate most of what had been given him and waited with some trepidation for a reaction.         *       *       *       *       *  As dusk fell, Kaiser set up his tent a few hundred yards back from the native settlement. All apprehension about how his stomach would react to the river weed had left him. Apparently it could be assimilated by his digestive system. Lying on his air mattress, he felt thoroughly at peace with this world.  Once, just before dropping off to sleep, he heard the snuffling noise of some large animal outside his tent and picked up a pistol, just in case. However, the first jolt of the guard-wire charge discouraged the beast and Kaiser heard it shuffle away, making puzzled mewing sounds as it went.  The next morning, Kaiser left off all his clothes except a pair of shorts and went swimming in the river. The seal-people were already in the water when he arrived and were very friendly.  That friendliness nearly resulted in disaster. The natives crowded around as he swam--they maneuvered with an otter-like proficiency--and often nudged him with their bodies when they came too close. He had difficulty keeping afloat and soon turned and started back. As he neared the river edge, a playful female grabbed him by the ankle and pulled him under.  Kaiser tried to break her hold, but she evidently thought he was clowning and wrapped her warm furred arms around him and held him helpless. They sank deeper.  When his breath threatened to burst from his lungs in a stream of bubbles, and he still could not free himself, Kaiser brought his knee up into her stomach and her grip loosened abruptly. He reached the surface, choking and coughing, and swam blindly toward shore until his feet hit the river bottom.  As he stood on the bank, getting his breath, the natives were quiet and seemed to be looking at him reproachfully. He stood for a time, trying to think of a way to explain the necessity of what he had done, but there was none. He shrugged helplessly.  There was no longer anything to be gained by staying here--if they had the tools he needed, he had no way of finding out or asking for them--and he packed and started back to the scout.  Kaiser's good spirits returned on his return journey. He had enjoyed the relief from the tedium of spending day after day in the scout, and now he enjoyed the exercise of pulling the mudsled. Above the waist, he wore only the harness and the large, soft drops of rain against his bare skin were pleasant to feel.  When he reached the scout, Kaiser began to unload the sled. The tarpaulin caught on the edge of a runner and he gave it a tug to free it. To his amazement, the heavy sled turned completely over, spilling the equipment to the ground.  Perplexed, Kaiser stooped and began replacing the spilled articles in the tarp. They felt exceptionally light. He paused again, and suddenly his eyes widened.         *       *       *       *       *  Moving quickly to the door of the scout, he shoved his equipment through and crawled in behind it. He did not consult the communicator, as he customarily did on entering, but went directly to the warped place on the floor and picked up the crowbar he had laid there.  Inserting the bar between the metal of the scout bottom and the engine casing, he lifted. Nothing happened. He rested a minute and tried again, this time concentrating on his desire to raise the bar. The metal beneath yielded slightly--but he felt the palms of his hands bruise against the lever.  Only after he dropped the bar did he realize the force he had exerted. His hands ached and tingled. His strength must have been increased tremendously. With his plastic coat wrapped around the lever, he tried again. The metal of the scout bottom gave slowly--until the fuel pump hung free!  Kaiser did not repair the tube immediately. He let the solution rest in his hands, like a package to be opened, the pleasure of its anticipation to be enjoyed as much as the final act.  He transmitted the news of what he had been able to do and sat down to read the two messages waiting for him.  The first was quite routine:      REPORTS FROM THE OCTOPUS INDICATE THAT BIG MUDDY UNDERGOES RADICAL     WEATHER-CYCLE CHANGES DURING SPRING AND FALL SEASONS, FROM EXTREME     MOISTURE TO EXTREME ARIDITY. AT HEIGHT OF DRY SEASON, PLANET MUST     BE COMPLETELY DEVOID OF SURFACE LIQUID.      TO SURVIVE THESE UNUSUAL EXTREMES, SEAL-PEOPLE WOULD NEED EXTREME     ADAPTABILITY. THIS VERIFIES OUR EARLIER GUESS THAT NATIVES HAVE     SYMBIOSIS WITH THE SAME VIRUS FORM THAT INVADED YOU. WITH     SYMBIOTES' AID, SUCH RADICAL PHYSICAL CHANGE COULD BE POSSIBLE.     WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED.      GIVE US ANY NEW INFORMATION YOU MIGHT HAVE ON NATIVES.      SS II  The second report was not so routine. Kaiser thought he detected a note of uneasiness in it.      SUGGEST YOU DEVOTE ALL TIME AND EFFORT TO REPAIR OF SCOUT.     INFORMATION ON SEAL-PEOPLE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PURPOSES.      SS II  Kaiser did not answer either communication. His earlier report had covered all that he had learned lately. He lay on his cot and went to sleep.  In the morning, another message was waiting:      VERY PLEASED TO HEAR OF PROGRESS ON REPAIR OF SCOUT. COMPLETE AS     QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND RETURN HERE IMMEDIATELY.      SS II         *       *       *       *       *  Kaiser wondered about the abrupt recall. Could the _Soscites II_ be experiencing some difficulty? He shrugged the thought aside. If they were, they would have told him. The last notes had had more than just a suggestion of urgency--there appeared to be a deliberate concealing of information.  Strangely, the messages indicated need for haste did not prod Kaiser. He knew now that the job could be done, perhaps in a few hours' time. And the _Soscites II_ would not complete its orbit of the planet for two weeks yet.  Without putting on more than the shirt and trousers he had grown used to wearing, Kaiser went outside and wandered listlessly about the vicinity of the ship for several hours. When he became hungry, he went back inside.  Another message came in as he finished eating. This one was from the captain himself:      WHY HAVE WE RECEIVED NO VERIFICATION OF LAST INSTRUCTIONS? REPAIR     SCOUT IMMEDIATELY AND RETURN WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY. THIS IS AN     ORDER!      H. A. HESSE, CAPT.  Kaiser pushed the last of his meal--which he had been eating with his fingers--into his mouth, crumpled the tape, wiped the grease from his hands with it and dropped it to the floor.  He pondered mildly, as he packed his equipment, why he was disregarding the captain's message. For some reason, it seemed too trivial for serious consideration. He placated his slightly uneasy conscience only to the extent of packing the communicator in with his other equipment. It was a self-contained unit and he'd be able to receive messages from the ship on his trip.         *       *       *       *       *  The tracks of his earlier journey had been erased by the soft rain, and when Kaiser reached the river, he found that he had not returned to the village he had visited the day before. However, there were other seal-people here.  And they were almost human!  The resemblance was still not so much in their physical makeup--that was little changed from the first he had found--as in their obviously greater intelligence.  This was mainly noticeable in their facile expressions as they talked. Kaiser was even"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51398"],["title","Growing up on Big Muddy (#3)"],["body","that he read smiles on their faces when he slipped on a particularly slick mud patch as he hurried toward them. Where the members of the first tribes had all looked almost exactly alike, these had very marked individual characteristics. Also, these had no odor--only a mild, rather pleasing scent. When they came to meet him, Kaiser could detect distinct syllabism in their pipings.  Most of the natives returned to the river after the first ten minutes of curious inspection, but two stayed behind as Kaiser set up his tent.  One was a female.  They made small noises while he went about his work. After a time, he understood that they were trying to give names to his paraphernalia. He tried saying \"tent\" and \"wire\" and \"tarp\" as he handled each object, but their piping voices could not repeat the words. Kaiser amused himself by trying to imitate their sounds for the articles. He was fairly successful. He was certain that he could soon learn enough to carry on a limited conversation.  The male became bored after a time and left, but the girl stayed until Kaiser finished. She motioned to him then to follow. When they reached the river bank, he saw that she wanted him to go into the water.         *       *       *       *       *  Before he had time to decide, Kaiser heard the small bell of the communicator from the tent behind him. He stood undecided for a moment, then returned and read the message on the tape:      STILL ANXIOUSLY AWAITING WORD FROM YOU.      IN MEANTIME, GIVE VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO FOLLOWING.      WE KNOW THAT THE SYMBIOTES MUST BE ABLE TO MAKE RADICAL CHANGES IN     THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE SEAL-PEOPLE. THERE IS EVERY PROBABILITY THAT     YOURS WILL ATTEMPT TO DO THE SAME TO YOU--TO BETTER FIT YOUR BODY     TO ITS PRESENT ENVIRONMENT.      THE DANGER, WHICH WE HESITATED TO MENTION UNTIL NOW--WHEN YOU HAVE     FORCED US BY YOUR OBSTINATE SILENCE--IS THAT IT CAN ALTER YOUR     MIND ALSO. YOUR REPORT ON SECOND TRIBE OF SEAL-PEOPLE STRONGLY     INDICATES THAT THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING. THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT     MORE INTELLIGENT AND HUMANLIKE THAN THE OTHERS. ON THE CONTRARY,     YOU ARE BECOMING MORE LIKE THEM.      DANGER ACUTE. RETURN IMMEDIATELY. REPEAT: IMMEDIATELY!      SS II  Kaiser picked up a large rock and slowly, methodically pounded the communicator into a flattened jumble of metal and loose parts.  When he finished, he returned to the waiting girl on the river bank. She pointed at his plastic trousers and made laughing sounds in her throat. Kaiser returned the laugh and stripped off the trousers. They ran, still laughing, into the water.  Already the long pink hair that had been growing on his body during the past week was beginning to turn brown at the roots."]]]
