Winkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.  \"... Sir,\" Bailey added.  \"That's better,\" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said meditatively, \"Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have sufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a bottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.\"  \"But, Sir....\" Bailey began.  \"You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat to the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic slops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of this sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in no condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you understand, Belly-Robber?\" he demanded.  \"I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed, slave-driving....\"  \"Watch your noun,\" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. \"Your adjectives are insubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.\"  \"Captain, you've gone too far,\" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was scarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.  \"Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's Surgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,\" Winkelmann said.  \"Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,\" I said. \"The other officers and the men have been more than satisfied with his work.\"  \"That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,\" Winkelmann said. \"Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,\" he added.         *       *       *       *       *  Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him to my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my bunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal bulkhead. \"You'll have that drink now,\" I said.  \"No, dammit!\" he shouted.  \"Orders,\" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. \"This is therapy, Bailey,\" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat like water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.  After a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. \"Sorry, Doc,\" he said.  \"You've taken more pressure than most men would,\" I said. \"Nothing to be ashamed of.\"  \"He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel and sauerkraut and _Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art_ out of an algae tank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out molecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And he expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet of the Friends of Escoffier!\"  \"Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,\" I said. \"You've worked your fingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're not appreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year from now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that restaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.\"  \"I hate him,\" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He reached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be an apt confederate of _vis medicatrix naturae_, the healing power of nature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it off. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.  For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in horribleness, a pottage or boiled _Chlorella vulgaris_ that looked and tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey, red-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as though daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the disgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, \"Belly-Robber, you're improving a little at last.\"  Bailey nodded and smiled. \"Thank you, Sir,\" he said.  I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were now strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of irony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was a price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann theory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain had pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I thought.  Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted of salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were vehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for the decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He served the algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galley oblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.         *       *       *       *       *  There being only three seats in the _Sale's_ mess compartment, we ate our meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to supper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell to make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier, of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss of canned beer being church-keyed. \"He's done it, Doc!\" one of the first-shift diners said. \"It actually tastes of food!\"  \"Then he's beat the Captain at his game,\" I said.  \"The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,\" the crewman said.  I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric warming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of us with the small \"steaks.\" Each contained about a pound of dried Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched in a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron skillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut a bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are limits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the galley door. I gestured for him to join me. \"You've done it, Bailey,\" I said. \"Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is actually _good_.\"  \"Thanks, Doc,\" Bailey said.  I smiled and took another bite. \"You may not realize it, Bailey; but this is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph; you couldn't have done it without him.\"  \"You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?\" Bailey asked.  \"He was driving you to do the impossible,\" I said; \"and you did it. Our Captain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum performance out of his Ship's Cook.\"  Bailey stood up. \"Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?\" he asked.  I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job. He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good of the ship and his crew. \"Do I like Captain Winkelmann?\" I asked, spearing another piece of my artificial steak. \"Bailey, I'm afraid I'll have to admit that I do.\"  Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my plate. \"Then have another piece,\" he said."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51603"],["title","All the People (#0)"],["body","THE PEOPLE                             By R. A. LAFFERTY                          Illustrated by GAUGHAN             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                       Galaxy Magazine April 1961.          Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that          the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]                     Tin Tony Trotz had only one job--to                    watch out for something a little                   odd--in a universe that was insane!   Anthony Trotz went first to the politician, Mike Delado. \"How many people do you know, Mr. Delado?\"  \"Why the question?\"  \"I am wondering just what amount of detail the mind can hold.\"  \"To a degree I know many. Ten thousand well, thirty thousand by name, probably a hundred thousand by face and to shake hands with.\"  \"And what is the limit?\" Anthony inquired.  \"Possibly I am the limit.\" The politician smiled frostily. \"The only limit is time, speed of cognizance and retention. I am told that the latter lessens with age. I am seventy, and it has not done so with me. Whom I have known I do not forget.\"  \"And with special training could one go beyond you?\"  \"I doubt if one could--much. For my own training has been quite special. Nobody has been so entirely with the people as I have. I've taken five memory courses in my time, but the tricks of all of them I had already come to on my own. I am a great believer in the commonality of mankind and of near equal inherent ability. Yet there are some, say the one man in fifty, who in degree if not in kind do exceed their fellows in scope and awareness and vitality. I am that one man in fifty, and knowing people is my specialty.\"  \"Could a man who specialized still more--and to the exclusion of other things--know a hundred thousand men well.\"  \"It is possible. Dimly.\"  \"A quarter of a million?\"  \"I think not. He might learn that many faces and names, but he would not know the men.\"  Anthony went next to the philosopher, Gabriel Mindel.  \"Mr. Mindel, how many people do you know?\"  \"How know? _Per se?_ _A se?_ Or _In Se_? _Per suam essentiam_, perhaps? Or do you mean _Ab alio_? Or to know as _Hoc aliquid_? There is a fine difference there. Or do you possibly mean to know in _Substantia prima_, or in the sense of comprehensive _noumena_?\"  \"Somewhere between the latter two. How many persons do you know by name, face, and with a degree of intimacy?\"  \"I have learned over the years the names of some of my colleagues, possibly a dozen of them. I am now sound on my wife's name, and I seldom stumble over the names of my offspring--never more than momentarily. But you may have come to the wrong man for--whatever you have come for. I am notoriously poor at names, faces, and persons. I have even been described (_vox faucibus haesit_) as absent-minded.\"  \"Yes, you do have the reputation. But perhaps I have not come to the wrong man in seeking the theory of the thing. What is it that limits the comprehensive capacity of the mind of man? What will it hold? What restricts?\"  \"The body.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"The brain, I should say, the material tie. The mind is limited by the brain. It is skull-bound. It can accumulate no more than its cranial capacity, though not one tenth of that is ordinarily used. An unbodied mind would (in esoteric theory) be unlimited.\"  \"And how in practical theory?\"  \"If it is practical, a _pragma_, it is a thing and not a theory.\"  \"Then we can have no experience with the unbodied mind, or the possibility of it?\"  \"We have not discovered any area of contact, but we may entertain the possibility of it. There is no paradox there. One may rationally consider the irrational.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Anthony went next to see the priest.  \"How many people do you know?\"  \"I know all of them.\"  \"That has to be doubted,\" said Anthony after a moment.  \"I've had twenty different stations. And when you hear five thousand confessions a year for forty years, you by no means know all about people, but you do know all people.\"  \"I do not mean types. I mean persons.\"  \"Oh, I know a dozen or so well, a few thousands somewhat less.\"  \"Would it be possible to know a hundred thousand people, a half million?\"  \"A mentalist might know that many to recognize; I don't know the limit. But darkened man has a limit set on everything.\"  \"Could a somehow emancipated man know more?\"  \"The only emancipated man is the corporally dead man. And the dead man, if he attains the beatific vision, knows all other persons who have ever been since time began.\"  \"All the billions?\"  \"All.\"  \"With the same brain?\"  \"No. But with the same mind.\"  \"Then wouldn't even a believer have to admit that the mind which we have now is only a token mind? Would not any connection it would have with a completely comprehensive mind be very tenuous? Would we really be the same person if so changed? It is like saying a bucket would hold the ocean if it were fulfilled, which only means filled full. How could it be the same mind?\"  \"I don't know.\"  Anthony went to see a psychologist.  \"How many people do you know, Dr. Shirm?\"  \"I could be crabby and say that I know as many as I want to; but it wouldn't be the truth. I rather like people, which is odd in my profession. What is it that you really want to know?\"  \"How many people can one man know?\"  \"It doesn't matter very much. People mostly overestimate the number of their acquaintances. What is it that you are trying to ask me?\"  \"Could one man know everyone?\"  \"Naturally not. But unnaturally he might seem to. There is a delusion to this effect accompanied by an euphoria, and it is called--\"  \"I don't want to know what it is called. Why do specialists use Latin and Greek?\"  \"One part hokum, and two parts need; there simply not being enough letters in the alphabet of exposition without them. It is as difficult to name concepts as children, and we search our brains as a new mother does. It will not do to call two children or two concepts by one name.\"  \"Thank you. I doubt that this is delusion, and it is not accompanied by euphoria.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Anthony had a reason for questioning the four men since (as a new thing that had come to him) he knew everybody. He knew everyone in Salt Lake City, where he had never been. He knew everybody in Jebel Shah where the town is a little amphitheater around the harbor, and in Batangas and Weihai. He knew the loungers around the end of the Galata bridge in Istambul, and the porters in Kuala Lumpur. He knew the tobacco traders in Plovdiv, and the cork-cutters of Portugal. He knew the dock workers in Djibouti, and the glove-makers in Prague. He knew the vegetable farmers around El Centro, and the muskrat trappers of Barrataria Bay. He knew the three billion people of the world by name and face, and with a fair degree of intimacy.  \"Yet I'm not a very intelligent man. I've been called a bungler. And they've had to reassign me three different times at the filter center. I've seen only a few thousands of these billions of people, and it seems unusual that I should know them all. It may be a delusion as Dr. Shirm says, but it is a heavily detailed delusion, and it is not accompanied by euphoria. I feel like green hell just thinking of it.\"  He knew the cattle traders in Letterkenny Donegal; he knew the cane cutters of Oriente, and the tree climbers of Milne Bay. He knew the people who died every minute, and those who were born.  \"There is no way out of it. I know everybody in the world. It is impossible, but it is so. And to what purpose? There aren't a handful of them I could borrow a dollar from, and I haven't a real friend in the lot. I don't know whether it came to me suddenly, but I realized it suddenly. My father was a junk dealer in Wichita, and my education is spotty. I am maladjusted, introverted, incompetent and unhappy, and I also have weak kidneys. Why would a power like this come to a man like me?\"  The children in the streets hooted at him. Anthony had always had a healthy hatred for children and dogs, those twin harassers of the unfortunate and the maladjusted. Both run in packs, and both are cowardly attackers. And if either of them spots a weakness he will never let it go. That his father had been a junk dealer was not reason to hoot at him. But how did the children even know about that? Did they possess some fraction of the power that had come to him lately?         *       *       *       *       *  But he had strolled about the town for too long. He should have been at work at the filter center. Often they were impatient with him when he wandered off from his work, and Colonel Peter Cooper was waiting for him when he came in now.  \"Where have you been, Anthony?\"  \"Walking. I talked to four men. I mentioned no subject in the province of the filter center.\"  \"Every subject is in the province of the filter center. And you know that our work here is confidential.\"  \"Yes, sir, but I do not understand the import of my work here. I would not be able to give out information that I do not have.\"  \"A popular misconception. There are others who might understand the import of it, and be able to reconstruct it from what you tell them. How do you feel?\"  \"Nervous, unwell, my tongue is furred, my kidneys--\"  \"Ah yes, there will be someone here this afternoon to fix your kidneys. I had not forgotten. Is there anything that you want to tell me?\"  \"No, sir.\"  Colonel Cooper had the habit of asking that of his workers in the manner of a mother asking a child if he wants to go to the bathroom. There was something embarrassing in his intonation.  Well, he did want to tell him something, but he didn't know how to phrase it. He wanted to tell the colonel that he had newly acquired the power of knowing everyone in the world, that he was worried how he could hold so much in his head that was not noteworthy for its capacity. But he feared ridicule more than he feared anything else and he was a tangle of"]]]
