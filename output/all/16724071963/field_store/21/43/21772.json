Instantly the other creatures--his host with them--were racing forward to the site of the encounter. Jerry felt his host's long gummy tongue flick out and snare one--just one--of the dead adult insects. It was ingested whole by a deft backflip of tongue to gullet. As his host turned tail and scurried for the tunnel once more, Jerry swiftly took control again, and halted it to observe any further developments.         *       *       *       *       *  Each of the other things, after a one-insect gulp, was just vanishing back underground. The turf-tops were dropping neatly into almost undetectable place hiding the tunnels. The sunlight nipped at his pale flesh, but Jerry held off from a return to the underground sanctuary, still watching that lump-covered corpse on the earth. Then....  The vine, its burden gone, began to drip a thick ichor from its ragged end upon the dead animal beneath it.  And as the ichor touched upon a white lump, the lump would swell, wriggle, and change color. Jerry watched with awe as the color became a mottled pink, and the surface of the lumps cracked and shriveled away, and tiny forms plopped out onto the ground: miniature bear-things, tiny throats emitting eager mouse-squeaks of hunger.  They rushed upon the body in which they'd been so violently incubated and swiftly, systematically devoured it, blood, bone and sinew.  And when not even a memory of the dead beast was left upon the soil, the tiny pink-white things began to burrow downward into the ground. Soon there was nothing left in the area but a dried fragment of vine, a few loose mounds of soil and a vast silence.  \"I'll be a monkey's uncle!\" said Jerry ... forgetting in his excitement that this phrase was nearly a concise parody of the Space Zoologists' final oath of duty, and kiddingly used as such by the older members of the group.  The whole damned planet was symbiotic! After witnessing those alien life-death rites, it didn't take him long to figure out the screwball connections between the species. Insects, once born of vine-gourds and fully grown, then propagated their species by a strange means: laying bear-eggs in a bear-thing and dying. And dying, eaten by the surviving bears, they turned to seeds which--left in the tunnels by the bear-things as droppings--in turn took root and became trees.  And the trees, under the onslaught of another bear-thing on a dangling pod, would produce new insects, then drip its ichor to fertilize the eggs in the newly dead bear-thing....  Jerry found his mind tangling as he attempted a better pinpointing of the plant-animal-insect relationship. A dead adult insect, plus a trip through a bear-thing's alimentary canal, produced a tree. A tree-pod, with the swatting stimulus of a bear-thing's paws, gave birth to new insects. And insect eggs in animal flesh, stimulated by the tree-ichor, gestated swiftly into young animals....  That meant, simply, that insect plus bear equals tree, tree plus bear equals insect, and insect plus tree equals bear. With three systems, each relied on the non-inclusive member for the breeding-ground. Insect-plus-ichor produced small animals _in_ the animal flesh. Dead-insect-plus-bear produced tree _in_ the tree-flesh (if one considered dead tree leaves and bark and such as the makeup of the soil.) Bear-swats-plus-tree produced insects.... \"Damn,\" said Jerry to himself, \"but _not_ in the insect-flesh. The thing won't round off....\"  He tried again, thinking hard. In effect, the trees were parents to the insects, insects parents to the bears, and bears parents to the trees.... Though in another sense, bear-flesh gave birth to new bears, digested insects gave birth (through the tree-medium) to new insects, and trees (through the insect-medium) gave birth to new trees....  Jerry's head spun pleasantly as he tried vainly to solve the confusion. Men of science, he realized, would spend decades trying to figure out which species were responsible for which. It made the ancient chicken-or-egg question beneath consideration. And a lot of diehard evolutionists were going to be bedded down with severe migraines when his report went into circulation....  A dazzle of silent lightning, and Contact was over.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Ready with that first tape again,\" Bob Ryder said as Jerry removed the Contact helmet and brushed his snow-white hair back from his tanned, youthful face. \"Or do you want a breather first?\"  Jerry shook his head. \"I won't need to re-Contact that other species, Ensign. I got its life-relationships from the second Contact.\"  \"Really, sir?\" said Bob. \"That's pretty unusual, isn't it?\"  \"The whole damned planet's unusual,\" said Jerry, rising from his supine position and stretching luxuriously in the warm jungle air. \"You'll see what I mean when you process the second tape.\"  Bob decided that Jerry--running pretty true to form for a Space Zoologist--wasn't in a particularly talkative mood, so he had to satisfy himself with waiting for the transcription of the Contact to get the details.  Later that day, an hour after takeoff, with Viridian already vanished behind them as the great ship plowed through hyper-space toward Earth and home, Bob finished reading the report. Then he went down the passageway to the ward room for coffee. Jerry was seated there already. Bob, quickly filling a mug from the polished percolator, slid into a seat across the table from his superior and asked the question that had been bugging him since seeing the report.  \"Sir--on that second Contact. Has it occurred to you that you'd relinquished control to the host _before_ you saw that other creature move out and start swatting the gourd-thing?\"  \"You mean was I taking a chance on being destroyed in the host if the creature I was Contacting gave in to the urge to do the swatting?\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said Bob. \"I mean, I know you can take control any time, if things get dangerous. But wasn't that cutting it kind of thin?\"  Jerry shook his head and sipped his coffee. \"Wrong urge, Ensign. You'll note I recognized it as the _goofy_ urge, the impulse to die followed instantly by a violent surge of self-preservation. It wasn't the death-wish at all. Myself and the creatures who remained safely at the tunnel-mouths had a milder form of what was affecting the creature that _did_ start swatting the gourd.\"  \"Then what was the difference, sir? Why did that one particular creature get the full self-destruction urge and no other?\"  Jerry wrinkled his face in thought. \"I wish I didn't suspect the answer to that, Ensign. The only thing I hope it _isn't_ is the thing I have the strongest inkling it _is_: Rotation. Something in their biology has set them up in a certain order for destruction. And that rite I saw performed was so un-animal, so formalized--\"  Bob's eyes widened as he caught the inference. \"You think they have an inbuilt protocol? That if one particular creature missed its cue, somehow, the designated subsequent creature would simply wait forever, never jumping its turn?\"  \"That's what I mean,\" nodded Jerry. \"I hope I'm wrong.\"  \"But the right creature made it,\" said Bob, blinking. \"We can't have upset the ecology, can we?\"  \"Things develop fast on Viridian,\" mused Jerry. \"If I figure the time-relationship between their egg-hatching rate and growth rate, those trees must mature in growth in about a month. And we managed to shrivel a half dozen vines with our rocket fires when we landed, and probably that many again when we blasted off....\"  \"We dropped CO_{2} bombs after we cleared the trees,\" offered the tech, uneasily. \"The fire was out in seconds.\"  \"That wouldn't help an already-shriveled vine, though, now would it!\" sighed Jerry. \"And if my hunch about protocol is correct--\"  \"The life-cycle would interrupt?\" gasped the tech.  \"We'll see,\" said Jerry. \"It'll take us a month to get back, and there'll be another six months before the first wave of engineers is sent to begin the homesteads and industry sites. We'll see, Ensign.\"         *       *       *       *       *  It took two months for the engineers to go out and return.  They hadn't landed. A few orbits about the planet had shown them nothing but a vast dead ball of dust and rotted vegetation, totally unfit for human habitation. They brought back photographs taken of the dead planet that no longer deserved the name it had rated in life.  But Jerry Norcriss, Space Zoologist, made it a special point to avoid looking at any of them."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51622"],["title","Extracts from the Galactick Almanack: Music Around the Universe (#0)"],["body","FROM THE GALACTICK ALMANACK                         Music Around the Universe                            By LARRY M.

This first selection deals entirely with the Music Section of the Almanack. Passed over in this anthology, which is intended for general readership, are all references to the four-dimensional doubly extensive polyphony of Green III (interested parties are referred to \"Time in Reverse, or the Musical Granny Knot,\" by Alfid Carp, _Papers of the Rigel Musicological Society_) or, for reasons of local censorship, the notices regarding Shem VI, VII and IX and the racial-sex \"music\" which is common on those planets.  All dates have been made conformable with the Terran Calendar (as in the standard Terran edition of the Almanack) by application of Winstock Benjamin's Least Square Variable Time Scale.         *       *       *       *       *  _FEBRUARY 17_: Today marks the birth date of Freem Freem, of Dubhe IV, perhaps the most celebrated child prodigy in musical history. Though it is, of course, true that he appeared in no concerts after the age of twelve, none who have seen the solidographs of his early performances can ever forget the intent face, the tense, accurate motions of the hands, the utter perfection of Freem's entire performance.  His first concert, given at the age of four, was an amazing spectacle. Respected critics refused to believe that Freem was as young as his manager (an octopoid from Fomalhaut) claimed, and were satisfied only by the sworn affidavit of Glerk, the well-known Sirian, who was present at the preliminary interviews.  Being a Sirian, Glerk was naturally incapable of dissimulation, and his earnest supersonics soon persuaded the critics of the truth. Freem was, in actuality, only four years old.  In the next eight years, Freem concertized throughout the Galaxy. His triumph on Deneb at the age of six, the stellar reception given him by a deputation of composers and critics from the Lesser Magellanic Cloud when he appeared in that sector, and the introduction (as an encore) of his single composition, the beloved _Memories of Old Age_, are still recalled.  And then, at the age of eleven, Freem's concerts ceased. Music-lovers throughout the Galaxy were stunned by the news that their famed prodigy would appear no longer. At the age of twelve, Freem Freem was dead.  Terrans have never felt this loss as deeply as other Galactic races, and it is not difficult to see why. The standard \"year\" of Dubhe IV equals 300 Earth years; to the short-lived Terrans, Freem Freem had given his first concert at the age of 1200, and had died at the ripe old age of 3600 years.  \"Calling a 1200-year-old being a child prodigy,\" states the Terran Dictionary of Music and Musicians, rather tartly, \"is the kind of misstatement up with which we shall not put.\"  Particularly noteworthy is the parallel attitude expressed by the inhabitants of Terk I, whose \"year\" is approximately three Terran days, to the alleged \"short\" life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.         *       *       *       *       *  _MAY 12_: Wilrik Rotha Rotha Delk Shkulma Tik was born on this date in 8080. Although he/she is renowned both as the creator of symphonic music on Wolf XVI and as the progenitor of the sole Galactic Censorship Law which remains in effect in this enlightened age, very little is actually known about the history of that law.  The full story is, very roughly, as follows:  In 8257, a composition was published by the firm of Scholer and Dichs (Sirius), the Concerto for Wood-Block and Orchestra by Tik. Since this was not only the first appearance of any composition by Tik, but was in fact the first composition of any kind to see publication from his planet of Wolf XVI, the musical world was astonished at the power, control and mastery the piece showed.  A review which is still extant stated: \"It is not possible that a composition of such a high level of organization should be the first to proceed from a composer--or from an entire planet. Yet we must recognize the merit and worth of Tik's Concerto, and applaud the force of the composer, in a higher degree than usual.\"  Even more amazing than the foregoing was the speed with which Tik's compositions followed one another. The Concerto was followed by a sonata, Tik's _Tock_, his/her Free-Fall Ballet for Centipedals, _Lights! Action! Comrades!_, a Symphony, an Imbroglio for Unstrung Violin, and fourteen Wolfish Rhapsodies--_all within the year_!  Scholars visited Wolf XVI and reported once again that there was no musical history on the planet.  Success, fame and money were Tik's. Succeeding compositions were received with an amount of enthusiasm that would have done credit to any musician.  And Wolf XVI seemed to awaken at his/her touch. Within ten years, there was a school of composition established there, and works of astounding complexity and beauty came pouring forth. The \"great flowering,\" as it was called, seemed to inspire other planets as well--to name only a few, Dog XII, Goldstone IX and Trent II (whose inhabitants, dwelling underwater for the most part, had never had anything like a musical history).  Tik's own income began to go down as the process continued. Then the astonishing truth was discovered.  Tik was not a composer at all--merely an electronics technician! He/she had recorded the sounds of the planet's main downtown business center and slowed the recording to half-speed. Since the inhabitants of Wolf XVI converse in batlike squeals, this slowing resulted in a series of patterns which fell within sonic range, and which had all of the scope and the complexity of music itself.  The other planets had copied the trick and soon the Galaxy was glutted with this electronic \"music.\" The climax came when a judge on Paolo III aided in the recording of a court trial over which he presided. During the two weeks of subsonic testimony, speech and bustle, he supervised recording apparatus and, in fact, announced that he had performed the actual \"arrangement\" involved: speeding up the recordings so that the two-week subsonic trial became a half-hour fantasia.  The judge lost the subsequent election and irrationally placed the blame on the recording (which had not been well-received by the critics). Single-handed, he restored the state of pure music by pushing through the Galactic Assembly a censorship rule requiring that all recording companies, musicians, technicians and composers be limited to the normal sonic range of the planet on which they were working.  Tik himself, after the passage of this law, eked out a bare living as a translator from the supersonic. He died, alone and friendless, in 9501.         *       *       *       *       *  _JUNE 4_: The composition, on this date, in 8236, of Wladislaw Wladislaw's Concertino for Enclosed Harp stirs reflections in musical minds of the inventor and first virtuoso on this instrument, the ingenious Barsak Gh. Therwent of Canopus XII. Nowadays, with compositions for that instrument as common as the _chadlas_ of Gh. Therwent's home planet, we are likely to pass over the startling and almost accidental circumstance that led to his marvelous discovery.  As a small boy, Gh. Therwent was enamored of music and musicians; he played the _gleep_-flute before the age of eight and, using his hair-thin minor arms, was an accomplished performer on the Irish (or small open) harp in his fifteenth year. A tendency to confuse the strings of the harp with his own digital extremities, however, seemed serious enough to rule out a concert career for the young _flalk_, and when an Earth-made piano was delivered to the home of a neighbor who fancied himself a collector of baroque instruments, young Gh. was among the first to attempt playing on it.  Unfortunately, he could not muster pressure sufficient in his secondary arms and digits to depress the keys; more, he kept slipping between them. It was one such slip that led to his discovery of the enclosed strings at the back of the piano (a spinet).  The subtle sonorities of plucked strings at the back of a closed chamber excited him, and he continued research into the instrument in a somewhat more organized manner. Soon he was able to give a concert of music which he himself had arranged--and when Wladislaw Wladislaw dedicated his composition to Gh., the performer's future was assured.  The rest of his triumphant story is too well known to repeat here. The single observation on Gh. Therwent's playing, however, by the composer Ratling, is perhaps worthy of note.  \"He don't play on the white keys, and he don't play on the black keys,\" said Ratling, with that cultivated lack of grammar which made him famous as an eccentric. \"He plays in the cracks!\"         *       *       *       *       *  _JULY 23_: On this date, the Hrrshtk Notes were discovered in a _welf_-shop cellar on Deneb III.  These notes are, quite certainly, alone in their originality, and in the force which they have had on the growth of subsequent musicians.  To begin at the beginning: it is well established that Ludwig Hrrshtk, perhaps the most widely known Denebian composer, died of overwork in his prime. His compositions, until the famous T85 discoveries of G'g Rash, were almost alone in their universal appeal. Races the Galaxy over have thrilled to Hrrshtk's Second Symphony, his Concerto for Old Men, and the inspiring Classic Mambo Suite. It is, as a matter of fact, said that G'g Rash himself was led to his discovery by considering the question:  \"How can many different races, experiencing totally different"]]]
