He'd have to save that one for himself, because he was too tired to go on. He sank to his knees. The traces were rich here. Fantastically rich. Somewhere nearby....  \"Well, I'll be damned,\" Morrison said.  The little ravine into which he had fallen was solid goldenstone.         *       *       *       *       *  He picked up a pebble. Even in its rough state he could see the deep luminous golden glow, the fiery red and purple flecks deep in the shining stone.  \"Make sure,\" Morrison told himself. \"No false alarms, no visions, no wild hopes. Make sure.\"  He broke off a chunk of rock with the butt of his revolver. It still looked like goldenstone. He took out his testing kit and spilled a few drops of white solution on the rock. The solution foamed green.  \"Goldenstone, sure as sure,\" Morrison said, looking around at the glowing cliff walls. \"Hey, I'm rich!\"  He took out his telephone. With trembling fingers he dialed Krandall's number.  \"Max!\" Morrison shouted. \"I've hit it! I've hit the real stuff!\"  \"My name is not Max,\" a voice over the telephone said.  \"Huh?\"  \"My name is Boyard,\" the man said.  The video screen cleared, and Morrison saw a thin, sallow-faced man with a hairline mustache.  \"I'm sorry, Mr. Boyard,\" Morrison said. \"I must have gotten the wrong number. I was calling--\"  \"It doesn't matter who you were calling,\" Mr. Boyard said. \"I am District Supervisor of the Venus Telephone Company. Your bill is two months overdue.\"  \"I can pay it now,\" Morrison said, grinning.  \"Excellent,\" said Mr. Boyard. \"As soon as you do, your service will be resumed.\"  The screen began to fade.  \"Wait!\" Morrison cried. \"I can pay as soon as I reach your office. But I must make one telephone call. Just one call, so that I--\"  \"Not a chance,\" Mr. Boyard said decisively. \"_After_ you have paid your bill, your service will be turned on immediately.\"  \"I've got the money right here!\" Morrison said. \"Right here in my hand!\"  Mr. Boyard paused. \"Well, it's unusual, but I suppose we could arrange for a special robot messenger if you are willing to pay the expenses.\"  \"I am!\"  \"Hm. It's irregular, but I daresay we ... Where is the money?\"  \"Right here,\" Morrison said. \"You recognize it, don't you? It's goldenstone!\"  \"I am sick and tired of the tricks you prospectors think you can put over on us. Holding up a handful of pebbles--\"  \"But this is really goldenstone! Can't you see it?\"  \"I am a businessman,\" Mr. Boyard said, \"not a jeweler. I wouldn't know goldenstone from goldenrod.\"  The video screen went blank.         *       *       *       *       *  Frantically, Morrison tried to reach the operator. There was nothing, not even a dial tone. His telephone was disconnected.  He put the instrument down and surveyed his situation. The narrow crevice into which he had fallen ran straight for about twenty yards, then curved to the left. No cave was visible in the steep walls, no place where he could build a barricade.  He heard a movement behind him. Whirling around, he saw a huge old wolf in full charge. Without a moment's hesitation, Morrison drew and fired, blasting off the top of the beast's head.  \"Damn it,\" Morrison said. \"I was going to save that bullet for myself.\"  It gave him a moment's grace. He ran down the ravine, looking for an opening in its sides. Goldenstone glowed at him and sparkled red and purple. And the sandwolves loped along behind him.  Then Morrison stopped. In front of him, the curving ravine ended in a sheer wall.  He put his back against it, holding the revolver by its butt. The wolves stopped five feet from him, gathering themselves for a rush. There were ten or twelve of them, and they were packed three deep in the narrow pass. Overhead, the kites circled, waiting for their turn.  At that moment, Morrison heard the crackling sound of 'porting equipment. A whirlpool appeared above the wolves' heads and they backed hastily away.  \"Just in time!\" Morrison said.  \"In time for what?\" asked Williams 4, the postman.  The robot climbed out of the vortex and looked around.  \"Well, young man,\" Williams 4 said, \"this is a fine fix you've gotten yourself into. Didn't I warn you? Didn't I advise you to turn back? And now look!\"  \"You were perfectly right,\" Morrison said. \"What did Max Krandall send me?\"  \"Max Krandall did not, and could not, send a thing.\"  \"Then why are you here?\"  \"Because it's your birthday,\" Williams 4 said. \"We of the Postal Department always give special service for birthdays. Here you are.\"  Williams 4 gave him a handful of mail, birthday greetings from Janie, and from his aunts, uncles and cousins on Earth.  \"Something else here,\" Williams 4 said, rummaging in his bag. \"I _think_ there was something else here. Let me see.... Yes, here it is.\"  He handed Morrison a small package.         *       *       *       *       *  Hastily, Morrison tore off the wrappings. It was a birthday present from his Aunt Mina in New Jersey. He opened it. It was a large box of salt-water taffy, direct from Atlantic City.  \"Quite a delicacy, I'm told,\" said Williams 4, who had been peering over his shoulder. \"But not very satisfactory under the circumstances. Well, young man, I hate to see anyone die on his birthday. The best I can wish you is a speedy and painless departure.\"  The robot began walking toward the vortex.  \"Wait!\" Morrison cried. \"You can't just leave me like this! I haven't had any water in days! And those wolves--\"  \"I know,\" Williams 4 said. \"Do you think I feel _happy_ about it? Even a robot has some feelings!\"  \"Then help me.\"  \"I can't. The rules of the Postal Department expressly and categorically forbid it. I remember Abner Lathe making much the same request of me in '97. It took three years for a burial party to reach him.\"  \"You have an emergency telephone, haven't you?\" Morrison asked.  \"Yes. But I can use it only for personal emergencies.\"  \"Can you at least carry a letter for me? A special delivery letter?\"  \"Of course I can,\" the robot postman said. \"That's what I'm here for. I can even lend you pencil and paper.\"  Morrison accepted the pencil and paper and tried to think. If he wrote to Max now, special delivery, Max would have the letter in a matter of hours. But how long would Max need to raise some money and send him water and ammunition? A day, two days? Morrison would have to figure out some way of holding out....  \"I assume you have a stamp,\" the robot said.  \"I don't,\" Morrison replied. \"But I'll buy one from you. Solidoport special.\"  \"Excellent,\" said the robot. \"We have just put out a new series of Venusborg triangulars. I consider them quite an esthetic accomplishment. They cost three dollars apiece.\"  \"That's fine. Very reasonable. Let me have one.\"  \"There is the question of payment.\"  \"Here,\" Morrison said, handing the robot a piece of goldenstone worth about five thousand dollars in the rough.  The postman examined the stone, then handed it back. \"I'm sorry, I can accept only cash.\"  \"But this is worth more than a thousand postage stamps!\" Morrison said. \"This is goldenstone!\"  \"It may well be,\" Williams 4 said. \"But I have never had any assaying knowledge taped into me. Nor is the Venus Postal Service run on a barter system. I'll have to ask for three dollars in bills or coins.\"  \"I don't have it.\"  \"I am very sorry.\" Williams 4 turned to go.  \"You can't just go and let me die!\"  \"I can and must,\" Williams 4 said sadly. \"I am only a robot, Mr. Morrison. I was made by men, and naturally I partake of some of their sensibilities. That's as it should be. But I also have my limits, which, in their nature, are similar to the limits most humans have on this harsh planet. And, unlike humans, I cannot transcend my limits.\"  The robot started to climb into the whirlpool. Morrison stared at him blankly, and saw beyond him the waiting wolfpack. He saw the soft glow of several million dollars' worth of goldenstone shining from the ravine's walls.  Something snapped inside him.         *       *       *       *       *  With an inarticulate yell, Morrison dived, tackling the robot around the ankles. Williams 4, half in and half out of the 'porting vortex, struggled and kicked, and almost succeeded in shaking Morrison loose. But with a maniac's strength Morrison held on. Inch by inch he dragged the robot out of the vortex, threw him on the ground and pinned him.  \"You are disrupting the mail service,\" said Williams 4.  \"That's not all I'm going to disrupt,\" Morrison growled. \"I'm not afraid of dying. That was part of the gamble. But I'm damned if I'm going to die fifteen minutes after I've struck it rich!\"  \"You have no choice.\"  \"I do. I'm going to use that emergency telephone of yours.\"  \"You can't,\" Williams 4 said. \"I refuse to extrude it. And you could never reach it without the resources of a machine shop.\"  \"Could be,\" said Morrison. \"I plan to find out.\" He pulled out his empty revolver.  \"What are you going to do?\" Williams 4 asked.  \"I'm going to see if I can smash you into scrap metal _without_ the resources of a machine shop. I think your eyecells would be a logical place to begin.\"  \"They would indeed,\" said the robot. \"I have no personal sense of survival, of course. But let me point out that you would be leaving all Venus without a postman. Many would suffer because of your anti-social action.\"  \"I hope so,\" Morrison said, raising the revolver above his head.  \"Also,\" the robot said hastily, \"you would be destroying government property. That is a serious offense.\"  Morrison laughed and swung the pistol. The robot moved its head quickly, dodging the blow. It tried to wriggle free, but Morrison's two hundred pounds was seated firmly on its thorax.  \"I won't miss this time,\" Morrison promised, hefting the revolver.  \"Stop!\" Williams 4 said. \"It is my duty to protect government property, even if that property happens to be myself. You may use my telephone, Mr. Morrison.

Morrison dialed Max Krandall and explained the situation.  \"I see, I see,\" Krandall said. \"All right, I'll try to find Wilkes. But, Tom, I don't know how much I can do. It's after business hours. Most places are closed--\"  \"Get them open again,\" said Morrison. \"I can pay for it. And get Jim Remstaater out of trouble, too.\"  \"It can't be done just like that. You haven't established any rights to your claim. You haven't even proved that your claim is valuable.\"  \"Look at it.\" Morrison turned the telephone so that Krandall could see the glowing walls of the ravine.  \"Looks real,\" Krandall said. \"But unfortunately, all that glitters is not goldenstone.\"  \"What can we do?\" Morrison asked.  \"We'll have to take it step by step. I'll 'port you the Public Surveyor. He'll check your claim, establish its limits, and make sure no one else has filed on it. You give him a chunk of goldenstone to take back. A big chunk.\"  \"How can I cut goldenstone? I don't have any tools.\"  \"You'll have to figure out a way. He'll take the chunk back for assaying. If it's rich enough, you're all set.\"  \"And if it isn't?\"  \"Perhaps we better not talk about that,\" Krandall said. \"I'll get right to work on this, Tommy. Good luck!\"  Morrison signed off. He stood up and helped the robot to its feet.  \"In twenty-three years of service,\" Williams 4 said, \"this is the first time anybody has threatened the life of a government postal employee. I must report this to the police authorities at Venusborg, Mr. Morrison. I have no choice.\"  \"I know,\" Morrison said. \"But I guess five or ten years in the penitentiary is better than dying.\"  \"I doubt it. I carry mail there, you know. You will have the opportunity of seeing for yourself in about six months.\"  \"What?\" said Morrison, stunned.  \"In about six months, after I have completed my mail calls around the planet and returned to Venusborg. A matter like this must be reported in person. But first and foremost, the mails must go through.\"  \"Thanks, Williams. I don't know how--\"  \"I am simply performing my duty,\" the robot said as it climbed into the vortex. \"If you are still on Venus in six months, I will be delivering your mail to the penitentiary.\"  \"I won't be here,\" Morrison said. \"So long, Williams!\"  The robot disappeared into the 'porting vortex. Then the vortex disappeared. Morrison was alone in the Venusian twilight.         *       *       *       *       *  He found an outcropping of goldenstone larger than a man's head. He chipped at it with his pistol butt, and tiny particles danced and shimmered in the air. After an hour, he had put four dents in his revolver, but he had barely scratched the highly refractory surface of the goldenstone.  The sandwolves began to edge forward. Morrison threw stones at them and shouted in his dry, cracked voice. The wolves retreated.  He examined the outcropping again and found a hairline fault running along one edge. He concentrated his blows along the fault.  The goldenstone refused to crack.  Morrison wiped sweat from his eyes and tried to think. A chisel, he needed a chisel....  He pulled off his belt. Putting the edge of the steel buckle against the crack, he managed to hammer it in a fraction of an inch. Three more blows drove the buckle firmly into the fault. With another blow, the outcropping sheared off cleanly. He had separated a twenty-pound piece from the cliff. At fifty dollars a troy ounce, this lump should be worth about twelve thousand dollars--if it assayed out as pure as it looked.  The twilight had turned a deep gray when the Public Surveyor 'ported in. It was a short, squat robot with a conservative crackle-black finish.  \"Good day, sir,\" the surveyor said. \"You wish to file a claim? A standard unrestricted mining claim?\"  \"That's right,\" Morrison said.  \"And where is the center of the aforesaid claim?\"  \"Huh? The center? I guess I'm standing on it.\"  \"Very well,\" the robot said.  Extruding a steel tape, it walked rapidly away from Morrison. At a distance of two hundred yards, it stopped. More steel tape fluttered as it walked, flew and climbed a square with Morrison at the center. When it had finished, the surveyor stood for a long time without moving.  \"What are you doing?\" Morrison asked.  \"I'm making depth-photographs of the terrain,\" the robot said. \"It's rather difficult in this light. Couldn't you wait till morning?\"  \"No!\"  \"Well, I'll just have to cope,\" the robot said.  It moved and stood, moved and stood, each subterranean exposure taking longer than the last as the twilight deepened. If it had had pores, it would have sweated.  \"There,\" said the robot at last, \"that takes care of it. Do you have a sample for me to take back?\"  \"Here it is,\" Morrison said, hefting the slab of goldenstone and handing it to the surveyor. \"Is that all?\"  \"Absolutely all,\" the robot said. \"Except, of course, that you haven't given me the Deed of Search.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Morrison blinked. \"I haven't given you the what?\"  \"The Deed of Search. That is a government document showing that the claim you are filing on is free, as per government order, of fissionable material in excess of fifty per cent of the total mass to a depth of sixty feet. It's a mere formality, but a necessary one.\"  \"I never heard of it,\" Morrison said.  \"It became a requirement last week,\" explained the surveyor. \"You don't have the Deed? Then I'm afraid your standard unrestricted claim is invalid.\"  \"Isn't there anything I can do?\"  \"Well,\" the robot said, \"you _could_ change your standard unrestricted claim to a special restricted claim. That requires no Deed of Search.\"  \"What does the special restricted part mean?\"  \"It means that in five hundred years all rights revert to the Government of Venus.\"  \"All right!\" Morrison shouted. \"Fine! Good! Is that all?\"  \"Absolutely all,\" the surveyor said. \"I shall bring this sample back and have it assayed and evaluated immediately. From it and the depth-photographs we can extrapolate the value and extent of your claim.\"  \"Send me back something to take care of the wolves,\" Morrison said. \"And food. And listen--I want a Prospector's Special.\"  \"Yes, sir. It will all be 'ported to you--if your claim is of sufficient value to warrant the outlay.\"  The robot climbed into the vortex and vanished.  Time passed, and the wolves edged forward again. They snarled at the rocks Morrison threw, but they didn't retreat. Jaws open and tongues lolling, they crept up the remaining yards between them and the prospector.  Then the leading wolf leaped back and howled. A gleaming vortex had appeared over his head and a rifle had fallen from the vortex, striking him on a forepaw.  The wolves scrambled away. Another rifle fell from the vortex. Then a large box marked _Grenades, Handle With Care_. Then another box marked _Desert Ration K_.  Morrison waited, staring at the gleaming mouth of the vortex. It crossed the sky to a spot a quarter of a mile away and paused there, and then a great round brass base emerged from the vortex, and the mouth widened to allow an even greater bulge of brass to which the base was attached. The bulge grew higher as the base was lowered to the sand. When the last of it appeared, it stood alone in the horizon-to-horizon expanse, a gigantic ornate brass punchbowl in the desert. The vortex rose and paused again over the bowl.  Morrison waited, his throat raw and aching. Now a small trickle came out of the vortex and splashed down into the bowl. Still Morrison didn't move.         *       *       *       *       *  And then it came. The trickle became a roar that sent the wolves and kites fleeing in terror, and a cataract poured from the vortex to the huge punchbowl.  Morrison began staggering toward it. He should have ordered a canteen, he told himself thirstily, stumbling across the quarter of a mile of sand. But at last he stood beneath the Prospector's Special, higher than a church steeple, wider than a house, filled with water more precious than goldenstone itself. He turned the spigot at the bottom. Water soaked the yellow sands and ran in rivulets down the dune.  He should have ordered a cup or glass, Morrison thought, lying on his back with open mouth."]]]
