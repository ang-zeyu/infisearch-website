He's Councilman Aldrich.\"  He rested his eyes for a second. \"But your name--?\" he heard himself say.  \"My stepfather, I should have said. Mother married him when I was two. _What were you going to do?_\"  \"I,\" he said, \"intended to end it all. All of this. All of it Outside. End everything.\"  The girl turned from him.  \"Then why don't you do it?\"  \"You mean you don't want our friends to succeed in torturing a sick world?\"  \"I don't like pain,\" she said. \"There's something clean, positive and challenging about killing. I'd like to kill. But pain seems so pointless. If you can stop them, go ahead. I'll help you.\"  He was exhausted and in fever. \"Joel won't let me.\"  \"Then--kill him,\" she said.         *       *       *       *       *  He knew it was all useless, tired, stale, unrewarding. It was done. He was nothing, and the girl was less. The Pack would succeed and a tortured world would die of a greater famine because he had failed all down the line. And he blamed himself for making a mistake that actually was unimportant. For a moment, he had trusted the girl.  \"You _can_ kill him.\" Julie turned back and faced him. \"How much do you think those Broadcasters can really control human beings? We aren't fighting wars because we don't want to. We've finally seen what war can do and we're scared. We've retreated. The human race is hiding just like you are now.\"  Danniels laughed.  She lunged forward, tense. For a moment he thought she had actually stamped her foot. \"It's true, you fool! Doesn't the actions of these men prove it to you? They are going to risk destroying the planet. If pacifism really controlled them do you think they could do that?\"  He mumbled something about Wolf Pack members.  \"There's never been any law or moral credo that human beings couldn't break and justify within themselves some way,\" Julie intoned carefully. \"People can do the same with the induced precepts of the Broadcasters. If you really want to stop them, you can--by killing Joel and going ahead.\"  \"Maybe later,\" Danniels mumbled. \"I'll think about it.\"  Julie slapped his face. He wondered why he didn't feel it.  \"You don't have much time left,\" Julie whispered. \"Don't you know what's wrong with your foot? _Gangrene._ You have to get those toes amputated soon or you'll die.\"  \"Yes,\" he said numbly. \"Must get amputation.\" But it didn't seem urgent. He felt he should get some rest first.  \"It's too bad you can't allow the operation,\" the girl said sweetly. \"You can't allow lives to be destroyed just to save your own personality.\"  \"What lives?\" he demanded.  \"All the cells and microorganisms in your toes,\" Julie told him. \"You know they'll _die_ if you are operated on. Are they any worse than the little bacteria you refused to murder? I suppose it's just as well that you die. How can you stand it on your conscience to breathe all the time and burn up innocent germs in your foul breath?\"  Danniels understood. To live was to kill.  Every instant he lived his old cells were dying and new ones being born. So Danniels, who thought he could not kill any living thing, finally accepted himself as a killer. It wasn't human life he was taking ... but it was life.  If he could be wrong about taking any life at all--and he had always believed himself unable to kill anything--he might be wrong about being able to kill men. In spite of everything he had been taught and what he believed about the influence of the Broadcasters.  He studied Joel in the gloom. The man represented everything he loathed--stupidity, brutality, the mob. If I can kill anyone, he told himself, it should be Joel.  He could try. Yes, he could. And that was a victory in itself.  He moved, and that was another triumph over the physical defeat that was already upon him.  Joel looked up, narrow eyes widened, as Danniels came down on him.         *       *       *       *       *  Danniels caught him in the stomach with the flat of his palm and shoved up.  Joel gargled in the back of his throat and rammed his thumbs for the prisoner's eyes. Danniels nodded and caught the balls of the thumbs on his forehead. He brought his fist up sharply and hit Joel on the point of the chin. His head snapped but righted itself slowly. He lashed into Danniels' body with both eager hands and Danniels, weakened, went down before he had time to think about it.  From the crazy angle of the floor he saw far above him Joel's lips curl back and closer, further down, a shoe was lifted to kick. It was aimed at Danniels' swollen foot.  Danniels smiled. He shouldn't have done that. If he had acted like a man instead of an animal he would have been fine. But now ... Danniels rolled over quickly against the one leg of Joel's firmly on the floor. Off balance, Joel fell backwards with a curse, the back of his skull ringing against the side of one of the bombs.  Exertion was painting red lines across his vision but Danniels climbed to his knees, put his hands to Joel's corded throat and squeezed.  Yes. He knew he could kill. A few more seconds and he would be dead.  Danniels stopped.  There was no need to kill the boy. He would be unconscious long enough for him to do his job. And he found that fear had left him. He was no longer afraid of killing small things, because he was no longer afraid of killing men.  He had been able to kill when he had to, but more important, he had been able to keep from killing when it wasn't needed. He didn't need to be afraid of the old blood-lust--because he knew now he could best it.  And Julie had seen. She had seen something she had never believed was possible. That a man could keep from being a savage without the restraints of the Broadcasters or of society.  He limped to the stacked pseudies and sat down. \"Now we can make it clean, Julie. We can end the whole mess. Ready?\"  \"Yes,\" she told him.  He picked up a pseudie and threw the switch.         *       *       *       *       *  The radio signal went out, and all over the world receivers noted a pseudo explosion in the heart of a Disaster Area. Danniels could imagine the men in the council room in the heart of the city seeing the flash and feeling the doom of a renewed twenty years of isolation and heading for the exact spot of the flash.  More signals flashed. And flashed. And flashed.  And he thought of the people all over the world wondering about the devastating sneak attack on the United States, and the incredible readings of the instruments.  \"Keep working,\" Danniels said. \"The Wolf Pack or the officials from the city will be here soon. I hope it's a dead heat. But,\" he said, \"I think we've done it. But we can keep working on the safety margin.\"  \"What have we done, Abe?\" Julie asked trustingly.  He was going to feel foolish saying it. \"We have just blown up the world according to the official records of the War Games.\"  \"Then they'll have to start over,\" she said.  \"Maybe,\" Danniels whispered. \"If they do, we'll all start even. Everybody's a Jonah. The world is a Disaster Area. Maybe they'll start the War Games over. Or maybe they'll try the real thing again, now that they've seen how easy it is with pseudies.\"  He felt the numb foot and knew he would have to have an emergency operation if he survived the mobs that were coming. But he had a way of surviving mobs. He looked at Julie. He would see that their children could eat.  \"At least,\" he said, triggering another H-bomb for the world's records, \"it isn't a bad day when the world has been given a fresh slate, a new start.\"  There were footsteps outside, coming closer."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51833"],["title","Meeting of the Minds (#0)"],["body","of the Minds                            By ROBERT SHECKLEY                        Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                     Galaxy Magazine February 1960.

Even he couldn't remember any more--but                he refused to die till it was completed!   PART ONE  The Quedak lay on a small hilltop and watched a slender jet of light descend through the sky. The feather-tailed jet was golden, and brighter than the sun. Poised above it was a glistening metallic object, fabricated rather than natural, hauntingly familiar. The Quedak tried to think what it was.  He couldn't remember. His memories had atrophied with his functions, leaving only scattered fragments of images. He searched among them now, leafing through his brief scraps of ruined cities, dying populations, a blue-water-filled canal, two moons, a spaceship....  That was it. The descending object was a _spaceship_. There had been many of them during the great days of the Quedak.  Those great days were over, buried forever beneath the powdery sands. Only the Quedak remained. He had life and he had a mission to perform. The driving urgency of his mission remained, even after memory and function had failed.  As the Quedak watched, the spaceship dipped lower. It wobbled and sidejets kicked out to straighten it. With a gentle explosion of dust, the spaceship settled tail first on the arid plain.  And the Quedak, driven by the imperative Quedak mission, dragged itself painfully down from the little hilltop. Every movement was an agony. If he were a selfish creature, the Quedak would have died. But he was not selfish. Quedaks owed a duty to the universe; and that spaceship, after all the blank years, was a link to other worlds, to planets where the Quedak could live again and give his services to the native fauna.  He crawled, a centimeter at a time, and wondered whether he had the strength to reach the alien spaceship before it left this dusty, dead planet.         *       *       *       *       *  Captain Jensen of the spaceship _Southern Cross_ was bored sick with Mars. He and his men had been here for ten days. They had found no important archeological specimens, no tantalizing hints of ancient cities such as the _Polaris_ expedition had discovered at the South Pole. Here there was nothing but sand, a few weary shrubs, and a rolling hill or two. Their biggest find so far had been three pottery shards.  Jensen readjusted his oxygen booster. Over the rise of a hill he saw his two men returning.  \"Anything interesting?\" he asked.  \"Just this,\" said engineer Vayne, holding up an inch of corroded blade without a handle.  \"Better than nothing,\" Jensen said. \"How about you, Wilks?\"  The navigator shrugged his shoulders. \"Just photographs of the landscape.\"  \"OK,\" Jensen said. \"Dump everything into the sterilizer and let's get going.\"  Wilks looked mournful. \"Captain, one quick sweep to the north might turn up something really--\"  \"Not a chance,\" Jensen said. \"Fuel, food, water, everything was calculated for a ten-day stay. That's three days longer than _Polaris_ had. We're taking off this evening.\"  The men nodded. They had no reason to complain. As the second to land on Mars, they were sure of a small but respectable footnote in the history books. They put their equipment through the sterilizer vent, sealed it, and climbed the ladder to the lock. Once they were inside, Vayne closed and dogged the hatch, and started to open the inside pressure door.  \"Hold it!\" Jensen called out.  \"What's the matter?\"  \"I thought I saw something on your boot,\" Jensen said. \"Something like a big bug.\"  Vayne quickly ran his hands down the sides of his boots. The two men circled him, examining his clothing.  \"Shut that inner door,\" the captain said. \"Wilks, did you see anything?\"  \"Not a thing,\" the navigator said. \"Are you sure, Cap? We haven't found anything that looks like animal or insect life here. Only a few plants.\"  \"I could have sworn I saw something,\" Jensen said. \"Maybe I was wrong.... Anyhow, we'll fumigate our clothes before we enter the ship proper. No sense taking any chance of bringing back some kind of Martian bug.\"  The men removed their clothing and boots and stuffed them into the chute. They searched the bare steel room carefully.  \"Nothing here,\" Jensen said at last. \"OK, let's go inside.\"  Once inside the ship, they sealed off the lock and fumigated it. The Quedak, who had crept inside earlier through the partially opened pressure door, listened to the distant hiss of gas. After a while he heard the jets begin to fire.  The Quedak retreated to the dark rear of the ship. He found a metal shelf and attached himself to the underside of it near the wall. After a while he felt the ship tremble.         *       *       *       *       *  The Quedak clung to the shelf during the long, slow flight through space. He had forgotten what spaceships were like, but now memory revived briefly. He felt blazing heat and freezing cold. Adjusting to the temperature changes drained his small store of vitality, and the Quedak began to wonder if he was going to die.  He _refused_ to die. Not while there was still a possibility of accomplishing the Quedak mission.  In time he felt the harsh pull of gravity, and felt the main jets firing again. The ship was coming down to its planet.         *       *       *       *       *  After a routine landing, Captain Jensen and his men were taken to Medic Checkpoint, where they were thumped, probed and tested for any sign of disease.  Their spaceship was lowered to a flatcar and taken past rows of moonships and ICBMs to Decontamination Stage One. Here the sealed outer hull was washed down with powerful cleansing sprays. By evening, the ship was taken to Decontamination Stage Two.  A team of two inspectors equipped with bulky tanks and hoses undogged the hatch and entered, shutting the hatch behind them.  They began at the bow, methodically spraying as they moved toward the rear. Everything seemed in order; no animals or plants, no trace of mold such as the first Luna expedition had brought back.  \"Do you really think this is necessary?\" the assistant inspector asked. He had already requested a transfer to Flight Control.  \"Sure it is,\" the senior inspector said. \"Can't tell what these ships might bring in.\"  \"I suppose so,\" the assistant said. \"Still, a Martian whoosis wouldn't even be able to live on Earth. Would it?\"  \"How should I know?\" the senior inspector said. \"I'm no botanist. Maybe they don't know, either.\"  \"Seems like a waste of--hey!\"  \"What is it?\" the senior inspector asked.  \"I thought I saw something,\" the assistant said. \"Looked a little like a palmetto bug. Over by that shelf.\"  The senior inspector adjusted his respirator more snugly over his face and motioned to his assistant to do the same. He advanced slowly toward the shelf, unfastening a second nozzle from the pressure tank on his back. He turned it on, and a cloud of greenish gas sprayed out.  \"There,\" the senior inspector said. \"That should take care of your bug.\" He knelt down and looked under the shelf. \"Nothing here.\"  \"It was probably a shadow,\" the assistant said.  Together they sprayed the entire interior of the ship, paying particular attention to the small box of Martian artifacts. They left the gas-filled ship and dogged the hatch again.  \"Now what?\" the assistant asked.  \"Now we leave the ship sealed for three days,\" the senior inspector said. \"Then we inspect again. You find me the animal that'll live through that.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The Quedak, who had been clinging to the underside of the assistant's shoe between the heel and the sole, released his hold. He watched the shadowy biped figures move away, talking in their deep, rumbling, indecipherable voices. He felt tired and unutterably lonely.  But buoying him up was the thought of the Quedak mission. Only that was important. The first part of the mission was accomplished. He had landed safely on an inhabited planet. Now he needed food and drink. Then he had to have rest, a great deal of rest to restore his dormant faculties. After that he would be ready to give this world what it so obviously needed--the cooperation possible only through the Quedak mind.  He crept slowly down the shadowy yard, past the deserted hulls of spaceships. He came to a wire fence and sensed the high-voltage electricity running through it. Gauging his distance carefully, the Quedak jumped safely through one of the openings in the mesh.  This was a very different section. From here the Quedak could smell water and food. He moved hastily forward, then stopped.  He sensed the presence of a man. And something else. Something much more menacing.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Who's there?\" the watchman called out. He waited, his revolver in one hand, his flashlight in the other. Thieves had broken into the yards last week; they had stolen three cases of computer parts bound for Rio. Tonight he was ready for them.  He walked forward, an old, keen-eyed man holding his revolver in a rock-steady fist. The beam of his flashlight probed among the cargoes. The yellow light flickered along a great pile of precision machine tools for South Africa, past a water-extraction plant for Jordan and a pile of mixed goods for Rabaul.  \"You better come out,\" the watchman shouted. His flashlight probed at sacks of rice for Shanghai and power saws for Burma. Then the beam of light stopped abruptly.  \"I'll be damned,\" the watchman said. Then he laughed. A huge and red-eyed rat was glaring into the beam of his flashlight. It had something in its jaws, something that looked like an unusually large cockroach.  \"Good eating,\" the watchman said. He"]]]
