The Deputies of Santa Claus     YOUTH    1.  Burzee  Have you heard of the great Forest of Burzee?  Nurse used to sing of it when I was a child.  She sang of the big tree-trunks, standing close together, with their roots intertwining below the earth and their branches intertwining above it; of their rough coating of bark and queer, gnarled limbs; of the bushy foliage that roofed the entire forest, save where the sunbeams found a path through which to touch the ground in little spots and to cast weird and curious shadows over the mosses, the lichens and the drifts of dried leaves.  The Forest of Burzee is mighty and grand and awesome to those who steal beneath its shade.  Coming from the sunlit meadows into its mazes it seems at first gloomy, then pleasant, and afterward filled with never-ending delights.  For hundreds of years it has flourished in all its magnificence, the silence of its inclosure unbroken save by the chirp of busy chipmunks, the growl of wild beasts and the songs of birds.  Yet Burzee has its inhabitants--for all this.  Nature peopled it in the beginning with Fairies, Knooks, Ryls and Nymphs.  As long as the Forest stands it will be a home, a refuge and a playground to these sweet immortals, who revel undisturbed in its depths.  Civilization has never yet reached Burzee.  Will it ever, I wonder?    2.  The Child of the Forest  Once, so long ago our great-grandfathers could scarcely have heard it mentioned, there lived within the great Forest of Burzee a wood-nymph named Necile.  She was closely related to the mighty Queen Zurline, and her home was beneath the shade of a widespreading oak.  Once every year, on Budding Day, when the trees put forth their new buds, Necile held the Golden Chalice of Ak to the lips of the Queen, who drank therefrom to the prosperity of the Forest.  So you see she was a nymph of some importance, and, moreover, it is said she was highly regarded because of her beauty and grace.  When she was created she could not have told; Queen Zurline could not have told; the great Ak himself could not have told.  It was long ago when the world was new and nymphs were needed to guard the forests and to minister to the wants of the young trees.  Then, on some day not remembered, Necile sprang into being; radiant, lovely, straight and slim as the sapling she was created to guard.  Her hair was the color that lines a chestnut-bur; her eyes were blue in the sunlight and purple in the shade; her cheeks bloomed with the faint pink that edges the clouds at sunset; her lips were full red, pouting and sweet.  For costume she adopted oak-leaf green; all the wood-nymphs dress in that color and know no other so desirable.  Her dainty feet were sandal-clad, while her head remained bare of covering other than her silken tresses.  Necile's duties were few and simple.  She kept hurtful weeds from growing beneath her trees and sapping the earth-food required by her charges.  She frightened away the Gadgols, who took evil delight in flying against the tree-trunks and wounding them so that they drooped and died from the poisonous contact.  In dry seasons she carried water from the brooks and pools and moistened the roots of her thirsty dependents.  That was in the beginning.  The weeds had now learned to avoid the forests where wood-nymphs dwelt; the loathsome Gadgols no longer dared come nigh; the trees had become old and sturdy and could bear the drought better than when fresh-sprouted.  So Necile's duties were lessened, and time grew laggard, while succeeding years became more tiresome and uneventful than the nymph's joyous spirit loved.  Truly the forest-dwellers did not lack amusement.  Each full moon they danced in the Royal Circle of the Queen.  There were also the Feast of Nuts, the Jubilee of Autumn Tintings, the solemn ceremony of Leaf Shedding and the revelry of Budding Day.  But these periods of enjoyment were far apart, and left many weary hours between.  That a wood-nymph should grow discontented was not thought of by Necile's sisters.  It came upon her only after many years of brooding. But when once she had settled in her mind that life was irksome she had no patience with her condition, and longed to do something of real interest and to pass her days in ways hitherto undreamed of by forest nymphs.  The Law of the Forest alone restrained her from going forth in search of adventure.  While this mood lay heavy upon pretty Necile it chanced that the great Ak visited the Forest of Burzee and allowed the wood-nymphs as was their wont--to lie at his feet and listen to the words of wisdom that fell from his lips.  Ak is the Master Woodsman of the world; he sees everything, and knows more than the sons of men.  That night he held the Queen's hand, for he loved the nymphs as a father loves his children; and Necile lay at his feet with many of her sisters and earnestly harkened as he spoke.  \"We live so happily, my fair ones, in our forest glades,\" said Ak, stroking his grizzled beard thoughtfully, \"that we know nothing of the sorrow and misery that fall to the lot of those poor mortals who inhabit the open spaces of the earth.  They are not of our race, it is true, yet compassion well befits beings so fairly favored as ourselves. Often as I pass by the dwelling of some suffering mortal I am tempted to stop and banish the poor thing's misery.  Yet suffering, in moderation, is the natural lot of mortals, and it is not our place to interfere with the laws of Nature.\"  \"Nevertheless,\" said the fair Queen, nodding her golden head at the Master Woodsman, \"it would not be a vain guess that Ak has often assisted these hapless mortals.\"  Ak smiled.  \"Sometimes,\" he replied, \"when they are very young--'children,' the mortals call them--I have stopped to rescue them from misery.  The men and women I dare not interfere with; they must bear the burdens Nature has imposed upon them.  But the helpless infants, the innocent children of men, have a right to be happy until they become full-grown and able to bear the trials of humanity.  So I feel I am justified in assisting them.  Not long ago--a year, maybe--I found four poor children huddled in a wooden hut, slowly freezing to death.  Their parents had gone to a neighboring village for food, and had left a fire to warm their little ones while they were absent.  But a storm arose and drifted the snow in their path, so they were long on the road.  Meantime the fire went out and the frost crept into the bones of the waiting children.\"  \"Poor things!\" murmured the Queen softly.  \"What did you do?\"  \"I called Nelko, bidding him fetch wood from my forests and breathe upon it until the fire blazed again and warmed the little room where the children lay.  Then they ceased shivering and fell asleep until their parents came.\"  \"I am glad you did thus,\" said the good Queen, beaming upon the Master; and Necile, who had eagerly listened to every word, echoed in a whisper: \"I, too, am glad!\"  \"And this very night,\" continued Ak, \"as I came to the edge of Burzee I heard a feeble cry, which I judged came from a human infant.  I looked about me and found, close to the forest, a helpless babe, lying quite naked upon the grasses and wailing piteously.  Not far away, screened by the forest, crouched Shiegra, the lioness, intent upon devouring the infant for her evening meal.\"  \"And what did you do, Ak?\" asked the Queen, breathlessly.  \"Not much, being in a hurry to greet my nymphs.  But I commanded Shiegra to lie close to the babe, and to give it her milk to quiet its hunger.  And I told her to send word throughout the forest, to all beasts and reptiles, that the child should not be harmed.\"  \"I am glad you did thus,\" said the good Queen again, in a tone of relief; but this time Necile did not echo her words, for the nymph, filled with a strange resolve, had suddenly stolen away from the group.  Swiftly her lithe form darted through the forest paths until she reached the edge of mighty Burzee, when she paused to gaze curiously about her.  Never until now had she ventured so far, for the Law of the Forest had placed the nymphs in its inmost depths.  Necile knew she was breaking the Law, but the thought did not give pause to her dainty feet.  She had decided to see with her own eyes this infant Ak had told of, for she had never yet beheld a child of man.  All the immortals are full-grown; there are no children among them.  Peering through the trees Necile saw the child lying on the grass.  But now it was sweetly sleeping, having been comforted by the milk drawn from Shiegra.  It was not old enough to know what peril means; if it did not feel hunger it was content.  Softly the nymph stole to the side of the babe and knelt upon the sward, her long robe of rose leaf color spreading about her like a gossamer cloud.  Her lovely countenance expressed curiosity and surprise, but, most of all, a tender, womanly pity.  The babe was newborn, chubby and pink.  It was entirely helpless.  While the nymph gazed the infant opened its eyes, smiled upon her, and stretched out two dimpled arms.  In another instant Necile had caught it to her breast and was hurrying with it through the forest paths.    3.  The"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/520"],["title","The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (#1)"],["body","The Master Woodsman suddenly rose, with knitted brows.  \"There is a strange presence in the Forest,\" he declared.  Then the Queen and her nymphs turned and saw standing before them Necile, with the sleeping infant clasped tightly in her arms and a defiant look in her deep blue eyes.  And thus for a moment they remained, the nymphs filled with surprise and consternation, but the brow of the Master Woodsman gradually clearing as he gazed intently upon the beautiful immortal who had wilfully broken the Law.  Then the great Ak, to the wonder of all, laid his hand softly on Necile's flowing locks and kissed her on her fair forehead.  \"For the first time within my knowledge,\" said he, gently, \"a nymph has defied me and my laws; yet in my heart can I find no word of chiding. What is your desire, Necile?\"  \"Let me keep the child!\" she answered, beginning to tremble and falling on her knees in supplication.  \"Here, in the Forest of Burzee, where the human race has never yet penetrated?\" questioned Ak.  \"Here, in the Forest of Burzee,\" replied the nymph, boldly.  \"It is my home, and I am weary for lack of occupation.  Let me care for the babe! See how weak and helpless it is.  Surely it can not harm Burzee nor the Master Woodsman of the World!\"  \"But the Law, child, the Law!\" cried Ak, sternly.  \"The Law is made by the Master Woodsman,\" returned Necile; \"if he bids me care for the babe he himself has saved from death, who in all the world dare oppose me?\"  Queen Zurline, who had listened intently to this conversation, clapped her pretty hands gleefully at the nymph's answer.  \"You are fairly trapped, O Ak!\" she exclaimed, laughing.  \"Now, I pray you, give heed to Necile's petition.\"  The Woodsman, as was his habit when in thought, stroked his grizzled beard slowly.  Then he said:  \"She shall keep the babe, and I will give it my protection.  But I warn you all that as this is the first time I have relaxed the Law, so shall it be the last time.  Never more, to the end of the World, shall a mortal be adopted by an immortal.  Otherwise would we abandon our happy existence for one of trouble and anxiety.  Good night, my nymphs!\"  Then Ak was gone from their midst, and Necile hurried away to her bower to rejoice over her new-found treasure.    4.  Claus  Another day found Necile's bower the most popular place in the Forest. The nymphs clustered around her and the child that lay asleep in her lap, with expressions of curiosity and delight.  Nor were they wanting in praises for the great Ak's kindness in allowing Necile to keep the babe and to care for it.  Even the Queen came to peer into the innocent childish face and to hold a helpless, chubby fist in her own fair hand.  \"What shall we call him, Necile?\" she asked, smiling.  \"He must have a name, you know.\"  \"Let him be called Claus,\" answered Necile, \"for that means 'a little one.'\"  \"Rather let him be called Neclaus,\"** returned the Queen, \"for that will mean 'Necile's little one.'\"  The nymphs clapped their hands in delight, and Neclaus became the infant's name, although Necile loved best to call him Claus, and in afterdays many of her sisters followed her example.  Necile gathered the softest moss in all the forest for Claus to lie upon, and she made his bed in her own bower.  Of food the infant had no lack.  The nymphs searched the forest for bell-udders, which grow upon the goa-tree and when opened are found to be filled with sweet milk. And the soft-eyed does willingly gave a share of their milk to support the little stranger, while Shiegra, the lioness, often crept stealthily into Necile's bower and purred softly as she lay beside the babe and fed it.  So the little one flourished and grew big and sturdy day by day, while Necile taught him to speak and to walk and to play.  His thoughts and words were sweet and gentle, for the nymphs knew no evil and their hearts were pure and loving.  He became the pet of the forest, for Ak's decree had forbidden beast or reptile to molest him, and he walked fearlessly wherever his will guided him.  Presently the news reached the other immortals that the nymphs of Burzee had adopted a human infant, and that the act had been sanctioned by the great Ak.  Therefore many of them came to visit the little stranger, looking upon him with much interest.  First the Ryls, who are first cousins to the wood-nymphs, although so differently formed.  For the Ryls are required to watch over the flowers and plants, as the nymphs watch over the forest trees.  They search the wide world for the food required by the roots of the flowering plants, while the brilliant colors possessed by the full-blown flowers are due to the dyes placed in the soil by the Ryls, which are drawn through the little veins in the roots and the body of the plants, as they reach maturity.  The Ryls are a busy people, for their flowers bloom and fade continually, but they are merry and light-hearted and are very popular with the other immortals.  Next came the Knooks, whose duty it is to watch over the beasts of the world, both gentle and wild.  The Knooks have a hard time of it, since many of the beasts are ungovernable and rebel against restraint.  But they know how to manage them, after all, and you will find that certain laws of the Knooks are obeyed by even the most ferocious animals. Their anxieties make the Knooks look old and worn and crooked, and their natures are a bit rough from associating with wild creatures continually; yet they are most useful to humanity and to the world in general, as their laws are the only laws the forest beasts recognize except those of the Master Woodsman.  Then there were the Fairies, the guardians of mankind, who were much interested in the adoption of Claus because their own laws forbade them to become familiar with their human charges.  There are instances on record where the Fairies have shown themselves to human beings, and have even conversed with them; but they are supposed to guard the lives of mankind unseen and unknown, and if they favor some people more than others it is because these have won such distinction fairly, as the Fairies are very just and impartial.  But the idea of adopting a child of men had never occurred to them because it was in every way opposed to their laws;  so their curiosity was intense to behold the little stranger adopted by Necile and her sister nymphs.  Claus looked upon the immortals who thronged around him with fearless eyes and smiling lips.  He rode laughingly upon the shoulders of the merry Ryls; he mischievously pulled the gray beards of the low-browed Knooks;  he rested his curly head confidently upon the dainty bosom of the Fairy Queen herself.  And the Ryls loved the sound of his laughter; the Knooks loved his courage; the Fairies loved his innocence.  The boy made friends of them all, and learned to know their laws intimately.  No forest flower was trampled beneath his feet, lest the friendly Ryls should be grieved.  He never interfered with the beasts of the forest, lest his friends the Knooks should become angry.  The Fairies he loved dearly, but, knowing nothing of mankind, he could not understand that he was the only one of his race admitted to friendly intercourse with them.  Indeed, Claus came to consider that he alone, of all the forest people, had no like nor fellow.  To him the forest was the world.  He had no idea that millions of toiling, striving human creatures existed.  And he was happy and content.   ** Some people have spelled this name Nicklaus and others Nicolas,    which is the reason that Santa Claus is still known in some lands    as St. Nicolas.  But, of course, Neclaus is his right name, and    Claus the nickname given him by his adopted mother, the fair nymph    Necile.    5.  The Master Woodsman  Years pass swiftly in Burzee, for the nymphs have no need to regard time in any way.  Even centuries make no change in the dainty creatures; ever and ever they remain the same, immortal and unchanging.  Claus, however, being mortal, grew to manhood day by day.  Necile was disturbed, presently, to find him too big to lie in her lap, and he had a desire for other food than milk.  His stout legs carried him far into Burzee's heart, where he gathered supplies of nuts and berries, as well as several sweet and wholesome roots, which suited his stomach better than the belludders.  He sought Necile's bower less frequently, till finally it became his custom to return thither only to sleep.  The nymph, who had come to love him dearly, was puzzled to comprehend the changed nature of her charge, and unconsciously altered her own mode of life to conform to his whims.  She followed him readily through the forest paths, as did many of her sister nymphs, explaining as they walked all the mysteries of the gigantic wood and the habits and nature of the living things which dwelt beneath its shade.  The language of the beasts became clear to little Claus; but he never could understand their sulky and morose tempers.  Only the squirrels, the mice and the rabbits seemed to possess cheerful and merry natures; yet would the boy laugh when the panther growled, and stroke the bear's glossy coat while the creature snarled and bared its teeth menacingly. The growls and snarls were not for Claus, he well knew, so what did they matter?  He could sing the songs of the bees, recite the poetry of the wood-flowers and relate the history of every blinking owl in Burzee. He helped the Ryls to feed their plants and the Knooks to keep order among the animals.  The little immortals regarded him as a privileged person, being especially protected by Queen Zurline and her nymphs and favored by the great Ak himself.  One day the Master Woodsman came back to the forest of Burzee.  He had visited, in turn, all his forests throughout the world, and they were many and broad.  Not until he entered the glade where the Queen and her nymphs were assembled to greet him did Ak remember the child he had permitted Necile"]]]
