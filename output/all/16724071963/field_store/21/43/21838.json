I'll tell you something. You think I'm sitting on top of the world, huh? I own this town, and everybody in it. All the luxury and fancy dinners and women I can use. And you know what? I'm bored.\"  \"And you think running the Navy might be diverting?\"  \"Call it whatever you want to. There's something big going on out there, and I don't plan to be left out.\"  \"Arena, when I clear atmosphere, we'll talk. Take it or leave it.\"  The smile was gone now. Arena looked at me, rubbing a finger along his blue cheek.  \"Suppose I was to tell you I know where your other three boys are, Maclamore?\"  \"Do you?\" I said.  \"And the boat,\" Arena said. \"The works.\"  \"If you've got them here, I want to see them, Arena. If not, don't waste my time.\"  \"I haven't exactly got 'em here, Maclamore. But I know a guy that knows where they are.\"  \"Yeah.\" I said.  Arena looked mad. \"Okay, I'll give it to you, Maclamore. I got a partner in this deal. Between us we got plenty. But we need what you got, too.\"  \"I've made my offer, Arena. It stands.\"  \"Have I got your word on that, Maclamore?\" He stood up and came over to stand before me. \"The old Academy word. You wouldn't break that, would you Maclamore?\"  \"I'll do what I said.\"  Arena walked to his desk, a massive boulder of Jadeite, cleaved and polished to a mirror surface. He thumbed a key.  \"Send him in here,\" he said.  I waited. Arena sat down and looked across at me.  Thirty seconds passed and then the door opened and Stenn walked in.         *       *       *       *       *  Stenn glanced at me. \"Well,\" he said. \"Mr. Smith.\"  \"The Smith routine is just a gag,\" Arena said. \"His name is--Maclamore.\"  For an instant, I thought I saw a flash of expression on Stenn's face. He crossed the room and sat down.  \"Well,\" he said. \"A very rational move, your coming here. I trust you struck a profitable bargain?\" He looked hard at me, and this time there was expression. Hate, I would call it, offhand.  \"Not much of a deal at that, Stenn,\" Arena said. \"The captain is a tough nut to crack. He wants my help with no strings attached. I think I'm going to buy it.\"  \"How much information has he given you?\"  Arena laughed. \"Nothing,\" he said. \"Max Arena going for a deal like that. Funny, huh? But that's the way the fall-out fogs 'em.\"  \"And what have you arranged?\"  \"I turn him loose, him and Williams. I figure you'll go along, Stenn, and let him have the three guys you got. Williams will tell him where the Scout boat is, so there's no percentage in your holding out.\"  \"What else?\"  \"What else is there?\" Arena spread his hands. \"They pick up the boat, fuel up--someplace--and they're off. And the captain here gives me the old Academy word he cuts me in, once he's clear.\"  There was a long silence. Arena smiled comfortably; Stenn sat calmly, looking at each of us in turn. I crossed my fingers and tried to look bored.  \"Very well,\" Stenn said. \"I seem to be presented with a _fait accompli_....\"  I let a long breath out. I was going to make it....  \"... But I would suggest that before committing yourself, you take the precaution of searching Mr. Maclamore's person. One never knows.\"  I could feel the look on my face. So could Arena.  \"So,\" he said. \"Another nifty.\" He didn't seem to move, but the stunner was in his hand. He wasn't smiling now, and the stunner caught me easily.   V  The lights came on, and I blinked, looking around the room.  My mementos didn't look like much, resting in the center of Arena's polished half-acre of desk top. The information was stored in the five tiny rods, less than an inch long, and the projector was a flat polyhedron the size of a pill-box. But the information they contained was worth more than all the treasure sunk in all the seas.  \"This is merely a small sample,\" Stenn said. \"The star surveys are said to be unbelievably complete. They represent a mapping task which would require a thousand years.\"  \"The angles,\" Arena said. \"Just figuring the angles will take plenty time.\"  \"And this is what you almost let him walk out with,\" Stenn said.  Arena gave me a slashing look.  \"Don't let your indignation run away with you, Arena,\" Stenn said. \"I don't think you remembered to mention the fuel situation to Mr. Maclamore, did you?\"  Arena turned to Stenn, looming over the smaller man. \"Maybe you better button your lip,\" he said quietly. \"I don't like the way you use it.\"  \"Afraid I'll lower you in the gentleman's esteem?\" Stenn said. He looked Arena in the eye.  \"Nuts to the gentleman's esteem,\" Arena said.  \"You thought you'd squeeze me out, Arena,\" Stenn said. \"You didn't need me any more. You intended to let Maclamore and Williams go and have them followed. There was no danger of an escape, since you knew they'd find no fuel.\"  He turned to me. \"During your years in space, Mr. Maclamore, technology moved on. And politics as well. Power fuels could be used to construct bombs. Ergo, all stations were converted for short half-life secondaries, and the primary materials stored at Fort Knox. You would have found yourself fuelless and therefore helpless. Mr. Arena would have arrived soon thereafter to seize the scout-boat.\"  \"What would he want with the boat without fuel?\" I asked.  \"Mr. Arena was foresighted enough to stock up some years ago,\" Stenn said. \"I understand he has enough metal hoarded to power your entire squadron for an indefinite time.\"  \"Why tell this guy that?\" Arena asked. \"Kick him to hell out of here and let's get busy. You gab too much.\"  \"I see that I'm tacitly reinstated as a partner,\" Stenn said. \"Most gratifying.\"  \"Max Arena is no welcher,\" Arena said. \"You tipped me to the tapes, so you're in.\"  \"Besides which you perhaps sense that I have other valuable contributions to make.\"  \"I figure you to pull your weight.\"  \"What are your plans for Mr. Maclamore?\"  \"I told you. Kick him out. He'll never wise up and cooperate with us.\"  \"First, you'd better ask him a few more questions.\"  \"Why? So he'll blow his head off and mess up my rug, like....\" Arena stopped. \"You won't get anything out of him.\"  \"A man of his type has a strong aversion to suicide. He won't die to protect trivial information. And if he does--we'll know there's something important being held out.\"  \"I don't like messy stuff,\" Arena said.  \"I'll be most careful,\" Stenn said. \"Get me some men in here to secure him to a chair, and we'll have a nice long chat with him.\"  \"No messy stuff,\" Arena repeated. He crossed to his desk, thumbed a lever and spoke to someone outside.  Stenn was standing in front of me.  \"Let him think he's pumping you,\" he hissed.  \"Find out where his fuel is stored. I'm on your side.\" Then Arena was coming back, and Stenn was looking at me indifferently.         *       *       *       *       *  Arena had overcome his aversion to messy stuff sufficiently to hit me in the mouth now and then during the past few hours. It made talking painful, but I kept at it.  \"How do I know you have Williams?\" I said.  Arena crossed to his desk, took out a defaced snapshot.  \"Here's his I. D.\" he said. \"Take a look.\" He tossed it over. Stenn held it up.  \"Let me talk to him.\"  \"For what?\"  \"See how he feels about it,\" I mumbled. I was having trouble staying awake. I hadn't seen a bed for three days. It was hard to remember what information I was supposed to get from Arena.  \"He'll join in if you do,\" Arena said. \"Give up. Don't fight. Let it happen.\"  \"You say you've got fuel. You're a liar. You've got no fuel.\"  \"I got plenty fuel, wise guy,\" Arena yelled. He was tired too.  \"Lousy crook,\" I said. \"Can't even cheat a little without getting caught at it.\"  \"Who's caught now, swabbie?\" Arena was getting mad. That suited me.  \"You're a lousy liar, Arena. You can't hide hot metal. Even Stenn ought to know that.\"  \"What else was in the cache, Maclamore?\" Stenn asked--for the hundredth time. He slapped me--also for the hundredth time. It jarred me and stung. It was the last straw. If Stenn was acting, I'd help him along. I lunged against the wires, swung a foot and caught him under the ribs. He oofed and fell off his chair.  \"Don't push me any farther, you small-time chiselers,\" I yelled. \"You've got nothing but a cast brass gall to offer. There's no hole deep enough to hide out power metal, even if a dumb slob like you thought of it.\"  \"Dumb slob?\" Arena barked. \"You think a dumb slob could have built the organization I did, put this town in his hip pocket? I started stock-piling metal five years ago--a year before the ban. No hole deep enough, huh? It don't need to be so deep when it's got two feet of lead shielding over it.\"  \"So you smuggled a few tons of lead into the Public Library and filed it under Little Bo Peep.\"  \"The two feet was there ahead of me, wisenheimer. Remember the Polaris sub that used to be drydocked at Norfolk for the tourists to rubberneck?\"  \"Decommissioned and sold for scrap,\" I said. \"Years ago.\"  \"But not scrapped. Rusted in a scrapyard for five years. Then I bought her--beefed up her shielding--loaded her and sank her in ten fathoms of water in Cartwright Bay.\"  \"That,\" Stenn said, \"is the information we need.\"  Arena whirled. Stenn was still sitting on the floor. He had a palm gun in his hand, and it was pointed at the monogram on Arena's silk shirt.  \"A cross,\" Arena said. \"A lousy cross....\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Move back, Arena.\" Stenn got to his feet, eyes on Arena.  \"Where'd you have the stinger stashed?\"  \"In my hand. Stop there.\"  Stenn moved over to me. Eyes on Arena, he reached for the twisted ends of wire, started loosening them.  \"I don't want to be nosey,\" I said. \"But just where the hell do you fit into this, Stenn?\"  \"Naval Intelligence,\" Stenn said.  Arena cursed. \"I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51781"],["title","The King of the City (#5)"],["body"," that name should have rung a bell. Vice Admiral Stenn. The papers said you got yours when the Navy was purged.\"  \"A few of us eluded the net.\"  Arena heaved a sigh.  \"Well, fellows,\" he said--and jumped.  Stenn's shot went wild, and Arena left-hooked him down behind the chair. As he followed, Stenn came up fast, landed a hard left, followed up, drove Arena back. I yanked at my wires. Almost--  Then Arena, a foot taller, hammered a brutal left-right, and Stenn sagged. Carefully Arena aimed a right cross to the jaw. Stenn dropped.  Arena wiped an arm across his face.  \"The little man tried, Mister. Let's give him that.\"  He walked past my chair, stooped for Stenn's gun. I heaved, slammed against him, and the light chair collapsed as we went over. Arena landed a kick, then I was on my feet, shaking a slat loose from the dangling wire. Arena stepped in, threw a whistling right. I ducked it, landed a hard punch to the midriff, another on the jaw. Arena backed, bent over but still strong. I couldn't let him rest. I was after him, took two in the face, ducked a haymaker that left him wide open just long enough for me to put everything I had in an uppercut that sent him back across his fancy desk. He sprawled, then slid onto the floor.  I went to him, kicked him lightly in the ribs.  \"Where's Williams,\" I said. I kept kicking and asking. After five tries, Arena shook his head and tried to sit up. I put a foot in his face and he relaxed. I asked him again.  \"You didn't learn this kind of tactics at the Academy,\" Arena whined.  \"It's the times,\" I said. \"They have a coarsening effect.\"  \"Williams was a fancy-pants,\" Arena said. \"No guts. He pulled the stopper.\"  \"Talk plainer,\" I said, and kicked him again, hard--but I knew what he meant.  \"Blew his lousy head off,\" Arena yelled. \"I gassed him and tried scop on him. He blew. He was out cold, and he blew.\"  \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Hypnotics will trigger it.\"  \"Fancy goddam wiring job,\" Arena muttered, wiping blood from his face.         *       *       *       *       *  I got the wire and trussed Arena up. I had to clip him twice before I finished. I went through his pockets, looked at things, recovered my souvenirs. I went over to Stenn. He was breathing.  Arena was watching. \"He's okay, for crissake,\" he said. \"What kind of punch you think I got?\"  I hoisted Stenn onto my shoulder.  \"So long, Arena,\" I said. \"I don't know why I don't blow your brains out. Maybe it's that Navy Cross citation in your wallet.\"  \"Listen,\" Arena said. \"Take me with you.\"  \"A swell idea,\" I said. \"I'll pick up a couple of tarantulas, too.\"  \"You're trying for the hack, right?\"  \"Sure. What else?\"  \"The roof,\" he said. \"I got six, eight rotos on the roof. One high-speed job. You'll never make the hack.\"  \"Why tell me?\"  \"I got eight hundred gun boys in this building alone. They know you're here. The hack is watched, the whole route. You can't get through.\"  \"What do you care?\"  \"If the boys bust in here after a while and find me like this.... They'll bury me with the wires still on, Maclamore.\"  \"How do I get to the roof?\"  He told me. I went to the right corner, pushed the right spot, and a panel slid aside. I looked back at Arena.  \"I'll make a good sailor, Maclamore,\" he said.  \"Don't crawl, Arena,\" I said. I went up the short stair, came out onto a block-square pad.  Arena was right about the rotos. Eight of them. I picked the four-place Cad, and got Stenn tied in. He was coming to, muttering. He was still fighting Arena, he thought.  \"... I'll hold ... you ... get out....\"  \"Take it easy, Stenn,\" I said. \"Nothing can touch this bus. Where's the boat?\" I shook him. \"Where's the boat, Stenn?\"  He came around long enough to tell me. It wasn't far--less than an hour's run.  \"Stand by, Admiral,\" I said. \"I'll be right back.\"  \"Where ... you....\"  \"We need every good man we can get,\" I said. \"And I think I know a guy that wants to join the Navy.\"   EPILOGUE  Admiral Stenn turned away from the communicator screen.  \"I think we'd be justified in announcing victory now, Commodore.\" As usual, he sounded like a professor of diction, but he was wearing a big grin.  \"Whatever you say, chief,\" I said, with an even sappier smile.  I made the official announcement that a provisional Congress had accepted the resignations of all claims by former office holders, and that new elections would be underway in a week.  I switched over to Power Section. The NCO in charge threw me a snappy highball. Damned if he wasn't grinning too.  \"I guess we showed 'em who's got the muscle, Commodore,\" he said.  \"Your firepower demonstration was potent, Max,\" I said. \"You must have stayed up nights studying the tapes.\"  \"We've hardly scratched the surface yet,\" he said.  \"I'll be crossing back to _Alaska_ now, Mac,\" Stenn said.  I watched him move across the half-mile void to the flagship. Five minutes later the patrol detail broke away to take up surveillance orbits. They would be getting all the shore leave for the next few years, but I was glad my squadron had been detailed to go with the flagship on the Deep Space patrol. I wanted to be there when we followed those star surveys back to where their makers came from. Stenn wasn't the man to waste time, either. He'd be getting under way any minute. It was time to give my orders. I flipped the communicator key to the squadron link-up.  \"Escort Commander to Escort,\" I said. \"Now hear this....\""]]]
