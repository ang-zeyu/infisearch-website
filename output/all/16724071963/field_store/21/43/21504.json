In fact, it might make it rather difficult.\"  \"You have your choice between going back to the zarquil house with me and switching or getting your current insides burned out.\"  Carmody exhaled a small hissing sigh that he hoped would not be recognized as obvious relief to the man behind him. \"You'll have to pay. I haven't enough folio on me.\"  \"I'll pay; I'll pay,\" the voice snarled. \"I always pay. But you'll come peacefully?\" he asked in some surprise.  \"Yes. Matter of fact, I'll be glad to get out of this body. No matter how much I try, somehow I can never manage to keep it clean.... Gently, now, you don't want to muss up a body you're planning to occupy yourself, now do you?\"  \"This is too easy,\" Keats' voice murmured dubiously. \"Maybe it's another trap....\"  \"You're always going to imagine traps, Mr. Exterminator, whether they're there or not. You and Lockard both--people who run must have something to run from, and half the time it's not there and half the time, of course, it is; only you never know which is which--\"  \"You talk too much,\" the man behind him snarled. \"Shut up and keep moving.\"  \"Back again?\" the Vinzz at the door asked. The present Carmody was a little startled. Somehow he had thought of the Vinzz as too remote from humanity to be able to distinguish between individual members of the species. \"I'm afraid neither of you is qualified to play.\"  \"No reason why we shouldn't have a private game, is there?\" John Keats demanded belligerently.  The Vinzz' tendrils quivered. \"In that case, no, no reason at all. If you want to be so unsporting and can afford it. It will cost you a hundred thousand credits each.\"  \"But that's twice what I had to pay last week!\" Keats protested angrily.  The Vinzz shrugged an antenna. \"You are, of course, at liberty to take your trade elsewhere, if you choose.\"  \"Oh, hell,\" the temporarily poetic-looking killer snarled. \"We're stuck and you know it. Let's get it over with!\"         *       *       *       *       *  It was odd to come out of unconsciousness back into the thin young man's body again. More uncomfortable than usual, because the criminal's body had been in such splendid physical condition and this one so poor--now worse than before, because it had been worked far beyond its attenuated capabilities. The individuality that had originally been Gabriel Lockard's, formerly housed in Jed Carmody's body, now opened John Keats' eyes and looked at the Vinzz who stood above him.  \"The other human has been told you awakened before him and have already departed,\" the Vinzz explained. \"He has violence in his heart and we do not care for violence on our doorstep. Bad for business.\"  \"Has he gone already?\"  The Vinzz nodded.  \"How long has he been gone?\" He scrambled to his feet and investigated the clothing he wore. Carmody had been in too much of a hurry to clean himself out. There was some money left, a container of milgot sticks, and a set of electroseals.  \"He has just left.\" The extra-terrestrial's eyes flickered in what might have been surprise. \"Don't you wish to avoid him?\"  \"No, I must go where he goes.\"  The Vinzz shrugged. \"Well, it's your funeral in the most literal sense of the word.\" He sighed as the young man plunged out into the darkness. \"But, from the objective viewpoint, what a waste of money!\"  The massive, broad-shouldered figure of Jed Carmody was still visible at the end of the street, so the thin man slowed down. He wanted to follow Carmody, to keep close watch on where he was going and, if necessary, guide him in the right direction, though he didn't think he'd have to do that. But he had no intention of overtaking him. Carmody might not want openly to use the gun the former tenant had so carefully left him, but with his physique he could break the fragile body of John Keats in two, if he so desired, and he probably did.  Meanwhile Carmody--the real Carmody--having been deprived of an immediate revenge, had begun to realize how much better the situation was as it now stood. If he killed Keats out of hand, he might miss out on half a million credits, because it was his custom to get cash in advance for all his flights, and this was his flight pattern now. He wouldn't trust that Lockard life-form to defoliate after the job was done.  Of course he himself had plenty of money stashed away, but every half million helped. It would be no trouble to find the sickly Keats later. And there was no reason the hounds should get him--Carmody--after all, the other had been rocketing around in his body and he hadn't been caught. Carmody had allowed himself to be stampeded into panic. He smiled. Gorman wouldn't ever be able to chart any pattern like that, or like anything, again. Fortunately there was no permanent harm done, and a half million credits to cover the zarquil losses, with a nice profit left over. Maybe he could even beat Lockard up to a million; that one was obviously a coward and a fool. A few threats should be enough to get him to hand over.  Carmody paused for a moment outside the hotel. It still took some nerve to walk boldly into the brightly lit lobby.         *       *       *       *       *  The automatic doors slid open as he entered. At the same time, the pneumo gates lifted and Gabe Lockard came out, dragging a heavily veiled Helen, their luggage floating behind them. Both stopped as they caught sight of the killer; Lockard paled--Helen gasped.  _Too bad I have to leave her in the tentacles of this low life-form_, Carmody thought with regret, but there was no help for it. He approached them with what he thought was an ingratiating smile. \"Mr. Lockard, I've decided to give you another chance.\"  It was an unhappy choice of word. \"Oh, you have, have you!\" the big blond man yelled. \"I thought I did have another chance. And now you've spoiled that, too!\"  \"What do you mean by that?\" Carmody demanded, his thick dark brows almost meeting across his nose.  \"I figured on getting away before you came back,\" Gabriel babbled in a frenzy, \"but you'd have found me anyway. You always find me. I'm sick of this running. There's only one way to stop you, only one way to be sure that, whatever happens to me, you won't be around to enjoy it.\"  \"Listen, Lockard, you're making a mistake. I--\"  \"The only mistake I made was in hiring somebody else to do the job I should have done myself.\"  He pulled out the gun--Carmody's own gun--and fired it. He wasn't a good shot, but that didn't matter. He had the flash on full blast and he pumped and pumped and pumped the trigger until the searing heat rays had whipped not only the killer's astonished body but all through the lobby. The few people still there rushed for cover as rug, chairs, potted palms were shriveled by the lancing holocaust. There was a penetrating odor of burning fabric and frond and flesh.  Helen let out a wail as Carmody, more ash than man, fell to the charred carpet. \"Gabe, Gabe, what have you done!\"  The gun dropped from his hand to rejoin its owner. His face crumpled. \"I didn't really mean to kill ... only to scare him.... What'll I do now?\"  \"You'll run, Mr. Lockard,\" John Keats' body said as he entered the devastated lobby. \"You'll run and run and run. He's dead, but you'll keep on running forever. No, not forever--I apologize--some day you'll get caught, because the hounds aren't amateurs like you and ... him....\" He pointed to the crumbling, blackened corpse, keeping his hand steady with an effort for, God knew, he was the biggest amateur of them all.  Lockard licked his lips and gazed apprehensively around. Frightened faces were beginning to peer out from their places of concealment. \"Look, Carmody,\" he said in a low, stiff voice, \"let's talk this over. But let's get out of here first before somebody calls the hounds.\"  \"All right,\" the thin man smiled. \"I'm always willing to talk. We can go over to Gorman's office. They won't look for us there right away.\"  \"How'll we get in?\"  \"I have a 'seal,\" Keats said. Surely one of the electroseals he carried must belong to Gorman's office. It was a chance he'd have to take.   XI  Keats had to try five different seals before he found the one that opened the lawyer's office. He was afraid his obvious lack of familiarity would arouse Lockard's suspicions, but the big man was too much preoccupied with his own emotions.  An unpleasantly haunting aroma of cooked meat seeped out from inside. \"For Christ's sake, Carmody, hurry!\" Lockard snarled, and gave a sigh of relief as the door swung open and the illuminators went on, lighting the shabby office. Gorman was there. His horribly seared body lay sprawled on the dusty rug--quite dead.  \"You--you killed him?\" Gabriel quavered. The sight of murder done by another hand seemed to upset him more than the murder he himself had just committed.  The thin man gave a difficult smile. \"Carmody killed him.\" Which was undoubtedly the truth. \"The gun that did it is in his pocket. I had nothing to do with it.\" His eyes sought for the ones behind the veil. He wanted the girl who stood frozenly by the door to know that this, at least, was the truth.  Gabriel also stayed near the door, unable to take his eyes off the corpse. In death Carmody and Gorman, the big man and the small man, had looked the same; each was just a heap of charred meat and black ash. No blood, no germs--all very hygienic. \"You're smart, Carmody,\" he said from taut lips. \"Damn smart.\"  \"I'm Keats, not Carmody! Remember that.\" He dropped into the chair behind the desk. \"Sit down, both of you.\" Only Gabriel accepted the invitation. \"Why don't you take that thing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/50988"],["title","Bodyguard (#8)"],["body"," your face, Mrs. Lockard? You aren't hiding from anybody, are you?\"  Gabriel gave a short laugh. \"She's hiding her face from everybody. I spoiled it a little for her. She was going to sell me out to ... the guy in your body.\"  Keats' hand tightened on the arm of his chair. Lose his temper now and he lost the whole game. \"It was a good body,\" he said, not looking at the thing on the rug, trying not to remember the thing on the rug on the other side of town. \"A very good body.\" Through the veil, Helen's shadowy eyes were fixed on his face. He wanted to see what Lockard had done to her, but he couldn't tear off the veil, as he longed to do; he was afraid of the expression that might be revealed on her face--triumph when there should have been anguish; anguish when there should have been triumph.  \"Not as good as the one I have here.\" Lockard thumped his own chest, anxious to establish the value of the only ware he had left.  \"Matter of opinion,\" Keats said. \"And mine was in better shape.\"  \"This one isn't in bad condition,\" Gabriel retorted defensively. \"It could be brought back to peak in short order.\"  \"You won't have much opportunity to do it, though. But maybe the government will do it for you; they don't pamper prisoners, I understand, especially lifers.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gabriel whitened. \"You're an extralegal, Carmody--Keats,\" he whined. \"You know your course. You know how to hide from the hounds.... I'm a--a respectable citizen.\" He spread his hands wide in exaggerated helplessness. \"Strictly an amateur, that's what I am--I admit I've been playing out of my league.\"  \"So?\"  \"I'm worth a lot of money, Keats, a hell of a lot. And half of it can be yours, if you ... change bodies with me.\"  Keats' angular face remained expressionless, but there was a sharp cry from the girl--a cry that might have been misunderstood as one of pain, but wasn't.  Gabriel turned toward her, and his upper lip curled back over his teeth. \"I'll throw her in to the bargain. You must have seen her when she wasn't banged up so you know she's not permanently disfigured. Isn't she worth taking a risk for?\"  Keats shrugged. \"If the hounds pull you down, she'll be a legal widow anyway.\"  \"Yes, but you'd have no ... chance with her in the body you now have.... No chance,\" he repeated. His voice broke. \"Never had a chance.\"  \"Go ahead, feel sorry for yourself,\" the other man said. \"Nobody else will.\"  Gabriel's face darkened, but he also had to control his temper to gain what he fancied were his own ends. \"You won't deny that this hulk is better than the one you have now?\"  \"Except that there's one thing about the head that I don't like.\"  Gabriel stared in bewilderment. His body was beyond criticism. \"What is it you don't like about the head?\"  \"There's a price on it now.\"  Gabriel pressed his spine against the back of the chair. \"Don't play the innocent, Carmody. You've killed people, too.\"  \"Well, sure, but not out in the open like that. You know how many people saw you blast him? Too many. If you're going to exterminate somebody, you do it from a dark doorway or an alley--not in a brilliantly lit hotel lobby, and you blast him in the back. But there's no use giving you lessons; it's not likely you'll ever be able to use them where you're going.\"  Gabriel suddenly sagged in his chair. He looked down at the floor. \"So you won't do it?\"  Keats grew apprehensive. He hadn't expected the big man to give in to despair so soon--it might spoil all his plans and leave him trapped in this sick unwanted body. He lit a milgot. \"I didn't say that,\" he pointed out, trying to sound unconcerned. \"Matter of fact, I might even consider your proposition, if....\"  There was hope in Lockard's eyes again. It made Keats a little sick to think of the game he had to play with the other; then he thought of the game the other had played with him, the game the other had played with his wife, and the faint flickering of compassion died out in him. \"What do you want?\" Gabriel asked.  Keats took a moment before he answered. \"I want _all_ of what you've got.\"  Gabriel uttered an inarticulate sound.  \"You can't take it with you, colleague. If we hulk-hop, it's got to be tonight, because the hounds will be baying on your trail any moment. You wouldn't have the chance to transfer the property to my name and, if you take my word that I'll hand over half afterward, you're just plain out of this dimension.... Think of it this way, Lockard--what's worth more to you, a couple of lousy billions or your freedom?\"  \"All right, Carmody,\" Lockard said dully, \"you're the dictator.\"   XII  The Vinzz' eyes flickered in astonishment. \"_Another_ private game? However....\" he shrugged eloquently. \"It will cost you a hundred thousand credits each, gentlemen.\"  \"No discount for a steady customer?\" Keats inquired lightly, though he was trembling inside.  The Vinzz' tendrils quivered. \"None. You ought to be glad I didn't raise the price again.\"  \"Why didn't you?\" he couldn't help asking.  The Vinzz looked steadily into the man's eyes. \"I don't know,\" it answered at last. \"Perhaps I have been so long on this planet that I have developed a sentimental streak.... In any case, I am going back to Vinau the day after tomorrow....\"  \"For God's sake,\" Lockard, his senses so confused with fear and apprehension that he was able to catch only fragments of their talk, screamed, \"pay him what he asks and don't haggle!\"  \"All right,\" Keats agreed. \"The lady will wait for me here,\" he told the Vinzz.  The extraterrestrial quivered indecisively. \"Most irregular,\" it murmured. \"However, I cannot refuse a slight favor for such an old customer. This way, madam.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gabriel Lockard opened Gabriel Lockard's eyes.  \"Well,\" the Vinzz who stood above him lisped, \"how does it feel to be back in your own body again?\"  Gabriel got up and stretched. He stretched again, and then an expression of wonderment came over his handsome features. \"I feel ... exactly the way I felt in ... any of the others,\" he said haltingly. \"I'm not comfortable in this one either. It's not right--it doesn't fit. My own body....\"  \"You've grown out of it,\" the green one told him, not unkindly. \"But you will be able to adjust to it again, if you'll give it a chance....\"  \"There's that word again.\" Gabriel winced. \"I'm beginning to respond to it the way my ... predecessor did. Do we ever really get another chance, I wonder?\"  \"Take my advice.\" The Vinzz' face became almost human. \"This is costing my people money, but we've made enough out of you and your--shall we say?--friends. It is a shame,\" it murmured, \"to prey upon unsophisticated life-forms, but one must live. However, I'll tell you this: The compulsion will come over you again and again to play the game--your body will torment you unbearably and you will long for relief from it, but you must conquer that desire or, I warn you, you will be lost to yourself forever. It's a pattern that's enormously difficult to break, but it can be broken.\"  Gabriel smiled down at the little green creature. \"Thanks, colleague. I'll remember that advice. And I'll take it.\"  \"The other is still asleep,\" the Vinzz told him. \"This time I thought it best to let you awaken first. Good-by, and ... good luck.\"  \"Thanks, fellow-man,\" Gabriel said. The Vinzz' tendrils quivered.         *       *       *       *       *  Helen awaited him in an anteroom, her veil flung back so that he could see her poor, marred face. Anger rose hotly in him, but he pushed it down. Her suffering had not been meaningless and revenge was already consummated.  \"Gabriel!\" Her voice was taut. \"... Jed!\"  \"Gabriel,\" he smiled. \"The genuine, original Gabriel--accept no substitutes.\"  \"I'm so glad.\" Her lips formed the words, for she had no voice with which to make them.  \"Come.\" He took her arm and led her out into the quiet street. It was almost daylight and the sky was a clear pearl gray. Again a star detached itself from the translucent disk of the Moon and sped out into the Galaxy.  _Soon_, he thought, _we'll be on a starship like that one, leaving this played-out planet for the new worlds up in the sky._  \"You're going to let Gabe--the other Gabriel--go?\" she asked.  He bent his head to look at her swollen face. \"You're free, Helen; I have my body back; why should we concern ourselves with what happens to him? He can't hurt us any more.\"  \"I suppose you're right,\" she muttered. \"It seems unfair....\" She shivered. \"Still, you have no idea of the things he did to me--the things he made me do....\" She shivered again.  \"You're cold. Let's get started.\"  \"But where are we going?\" She placed her hand on his arm and looked up at him.  \"Back to the hotel to pick up your luggage. And then--I still think Proxima is a good idea, don't you? And then perhaps farther out still. I'm sick of this old world.\"  \"But, Je--Gabriel, you must be mad! The police will be waiting for you at the hotel.\"  \"Of course they'll be waiting, but with a citation, not handcuffs.\"  She looked at him as if he had gone extradimensional. He laughed. \"What your ex-husband didn't know, my dear, was that there was a reward out for Jed Carmody, _dead or alive_.\"  Her face was blank for a moment. \"A reward! Oh, G-G-G-Gabriel!\" The girl erupted into hysterical laughter.  \"Shhh, darling, control yourself.\" He put his arm around her, protectively, restrainingly. \"We'll be conspicuous,\" for already the Sun's first feeble rays were beginning to wash the ancient tired streets with watery gold. \"Think of the reward we're going to get--five thousand credits, just for us!\"  She wiped her eyes and pulled down her veil. \"Whatever will we do with all that money!\"  \"I think it would be nice if we turned it over to the hotel,\" he smiled. \"I made rather a shambles of their lobby when, pursuant to my duty as a solar citizen, I exterminated the killer Carmody. Let's give it to them and leave only pleasant memories behind us on"]]]
