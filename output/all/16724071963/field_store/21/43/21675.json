Stop playing possum and stand up! You aren't fooling anyone!\"  The Ghrynians got off the huddled little assassin and tried to stop Gorb. \"Your pardon, but the dead require your respect,\" began one of the lizards mildly.  Gorb whirled angrily. \"Maybe the dead do--but this character isn't dead!\"  He knelt and said loudly in the Kallerian's dishlike ear, \"You might as well quit it, Heraal. Listen to this, you shamming mountain of meat--_your mother knits doilies for the Clan Verdrokh_!\"  The supposedly dead Kallerian emitted a twenty-cycle rumble that shook the floor, and clambered to his feet, pulling the sword out of his body and waving it in the air. Gorb leaped back nimbly, snatched up the Stortulian's fallen blaster, and trained it neatly on the big alien's throat before he could do any damage. The Kallerian grumbled and lowered his sword.  I felt groggy. I thought I knew plenty about non-terrestrial life-forms, but I was learning a few things today. \"I don't understand. How--\"  The police were blue with chagrin. \"A thousand pardons, Earthman. There seems to have been some error.\"  \"There seems to have been a cute little con game,\" Gorb remarked quietly.  I recovered my balance. \"Try to milk me of a hundred grand when there's been no crime?\" I snapped. \"I'll say there's been an error! If I weren't a forgiving man, I'd clap the bunch of you in jail for attempting to defraud an Earthman! Get out of here! And take that would-be murderer with you!\"  They got, and they got fast, burbling apologies as they went. They had tried to fox an Earthman, and that's a dangerous sport. They dragged the cocooned form of the Stortulian with them. The air seemed to clear, and peace was restored. I signaled to Auchinleck and he slammed the door.  \"All right.\" I looked at Gorb and jerked a thumb at the Kallerian. \"That's a nice trick. How does it work?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gorb smiled pleasantly. He was enjoying this, I could see. \"Kallerians of the Clan Gursdrinn specialize in a kind of mental discipline, Corrigan. It isn't too widely known in this area of the Galaxy, but men of that clan have unusual mental control over their bodies. They can cut off circulation and nervous-system response in large chunks of their bodies for hours at a stretch--an absolutely perfect imitation of death. And, of course, when Heraal put the sword through himself, it was a simple matter to avoid hitting any vital organs en route.\"  The Kallerian, still at gunpoint, hung his head in shame. I turned on him. \"So--try to swindle me, eh? You cooked this whole fake suicide up in collusion with those cops.\"  He looked quite a sight, with that gaping slash running clear through his body. But the wound had begun to heal already. \"I regret the incident, Earthman. I am mortified. Be good enough to destroy this unworthy person.\"  It was a tempting idea, but a notion was forming in my showman's mind. \"No, I won't destroy you. Tell me--how often can you do that trick?\"  \"The tissues will regenerate in a few hours.\"  \"Would you mind having to kill yourself every day, Heraal? And twice on Sundays?\"  Heraal looked doubtful. \"Well, for the honor of my Clan, perhaps--\"  Stebbins said, \"Boss, you mean--\"  \"Shut up. Heraal, you're hired--$75 a week plus expenses. Stebbins, get me a contract form--and type in a clause requiring Heraal to perform his suicide stunt at least five but no more than eight times a week.\"  I felt a satisfied glow. There's nothing more pleasing than to turn a swindle into a sure-fire crowd-puller.  \"Aren't you forgetting something, Corrigan?\" asked Ildwar Gorb in a quietly menacing voice. \"We had a little agreement, you know.\"  \"Oh. Yes.\" I moistened my lips and glanced shiftily around the office. There had been too many witnesses. I couldn't back down. I had no choice but to write out a check for five grand and give Gorb a standard alien-specimen contract. Unless....  \"Just a second,\" I said. \"To enter Earth as an alien exhibit, you need proof of alien origin.\"  He grinned, pulled out a batch of documents. \"Nothing to it. Everything's stamped and in order--and anybody who wants to prove these papers are fraudulent will have to find Wazzenazz XIII first!\"  We signed and I filed the contracts away. But only then did it occur to me that the events of the past hour might have been even more complicated than they looked. Suppose, I wondered, Gorb had conspired with Heraal to stage the fake suicide, and rung in the cops as well--with contracts for both of them the price of my getting off the hook?  It could very well be. And if it was, it meant I had been taken as neatly as any chump I'd ever conned.  Carefully keeping a poker face, I did a silent burn. Gorb, or whatever his real name was, was going to find himself living up to that contract he'd signed--every damn word and letter of it!         *       *       *       *       *  We left Ghryne later that week, having interviewed some eleven hundred alien life-forms and having hired fifty-two. It brought the register of our zoo--pardon me, the Institute--to a nice pleasant 742 specimens representing 326 intelligent life-forms.  Ildwar Gorb, the Wazzenazzian--who admitted that his real name was Mike Higgins, of St. Louis--turned out to be a tower of strength on the return voyage. It developed that he really _did_ know all there was to know about alien life-forms.  When he found out I had turned down the 400-foot-long Vegan because the upkeep would be too big, Gorb-Higgins rushed off to the Vegan's agent and concluded a deal whereby we acquired a fertilized Vegan ovum, weighing hardly more than an ounce. Transporting _that_ was a lot cheaper than lugging a full-grown adult Vegan, besides which, he assured me that the infant beast could be adapted to a diet of vegetables without any difficulty.  He made life a lot easier for me during the six-week voyage to Earth in our specially constructed ship. With fifty-two alien life-forms aboard, all sorts of dietary problems arose, not to mention the headaches that popped up over pride of place and the like. The Kallerian simply refused to be quartered anywhere but on the left-hand side of the ship, for example--but that was the side we had reserved for low-gravity creatures, and there was no room for him there.  \"We'll be traveling in hyperspace all the way to Earth,\" Gorb-Higgins assured the stubborn Kallerian. \"Our cosmostatic polarity will be reversed, you see.\"  \"Hah?\" asked Heraal in confusion.  \"The cosmostatic polarity. If you take a bunk on the left-hand side of the ship, you'll be traveling on the right-hand side all the way there!\"  \"Oh,\" said the big Kallerian. \"I didn't know that. Thank you for explaining.\"  He gratefully took the stateroom we assigned him.  Higgins really had a way with the creatures, all right. He made us look like fumbling amateurs, and I had been operating in this business more than fifteen years.  Somehow Higgins managed to be on the spot whenever trouble broke out. A highly strung Norvennith started a feud with a pair of Vanoinans over an alleged moral impropriety; Norvennithi can be _very_ stuffy sometimes. But Gorb convinced the outraged being that what the Vanoinans were doing in the washroom was perfectly proper. Well, it was, but I'd never have thought of using that particular analogy.  I could list half a dozen other incidents in which Gorb-Higgins' special knowledge of outworld beings saved us from annoying hassles on that trip back. It was the first time I had ever had another man with brains in the organization and I was getting worried.  When I first set up the Institute back in the early 2920s, it was with my own capital, scraped together while running a comparative biology show on Betelgeuse IX. I saw to it that I was the sole owner. And I took care to hire competent but unspectacular men as my staffers--men like Stebbins, Auchinleck and Ludlow.  Only now I had a viper in my bosom, in the person of this Ildwar Gorb-Mike Higgins. He could think for himself. He knew a good racket when he saw one. We were birds of a feather, Higgins and I. I doubted if there was room for both of us in this outfit.         *       *       *       *       *  I sent for him just before we were about to make Earthfall, offered him a few slugs of brandy before I got to the point. \"Mike, I've watched the way you handled the exhibits on the way back here.\"  \"The _other_ exhibits,\" he pointed out. \"I'm one of them, not a staff man.\"  \"Your Wazzenazzian status is just a fiction cooked up to get you past the immigration authorities, Mike. But I've got a proposition for you.\"  \"Propose away.\"  \"I'm getting a little too old for this starcombing routine,\" I said. \"Up to now, I've been doing my own recruiting, but only because I couldn't trust anyone else to do the job. I think you could handle it, though.\" I stubbed out my cigarette and lit another. \"Tell you what, Mike--I'll rip up your contract as an exhibit, and I'll give you another one as a staffman, paying twice as much. Your job will be to roam the planets finding new material for us. How about it?\"  I had the new contract all drawn up. I pushed it toward him, but he put his hand down over mine and smiled amiably as he said, \"No go.\"  \"No? Not even for twice the pay?\"  \"I've done my own share of roaming,\" he said. \"Don't offer me more money. I just want to settle down on Earth, Jim. I don't care about the cash. Honest.\"  It was very touching, and also very phony, but there was nothing I could do. I couldn't get rid of him that way. I had to bring him to Earth.  The immigration officials argued about his papers, but he'd had the things so cleverly faked that there was no way of proving he wasn't from Wazzenazz XIII. We set him up in a key spot of the building.  The Kallerian, Heraal, is one of our top attractions now. Every day at two in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51361"],["title","Birds of a Feather (#4)"],["body","oon, he commits ritual suicide, and soon afterward rises from death to the accompaniment of a trumpet fanfare. The four other Kallerians we had before are wildly jealous of the crowds he draws, but they're just not trained to do his act.  But the unquestioned number one attraction here is confidence man Mike Higgins. He's billed as the only absolutely human life-form from an extraterrestrial planet, and though we've had our share of debunking, it has only increased business.  Funny that the biggest draw at a zoo like ours should be a home-grown Earthman, but that's show business.         *       *       *       *       *  A couple of weeks after we got back, Mike added a new wrinkle to the act. He turned up with a blonde showgirl named Marie, and now we have a Woman from Wazzenazz too. It's more fun for Mike that way. And downright clever.  He's too clever, in fact. Like I said, I appreciate a good confidence man, the way some people appreciate fine wine. But I wish I had left Ildwar Gorb back on Ghryne, instead of signing him up with us.  Yesterday he stopped by at my office after we had closed down for the day. He was wearing that pleasant smile he always wears when he's up to something.  He accepted a drink, as usual, and then he said, \"Jim, I was talking to Lawrence R. Fitzgerald yesterday.\"  \"The little Regulan? The green basketball?\"  \"That's the one. He tells me he's only getting $50 a week. And a lot of the other boys here are drawing pretty low pay too.\"  My stomach gave a warning twinge. \"Mike, if you're looking for a raise, I've told you time and again you're worth it to me. How about twenty a week?\"  He held up one hand. \"I'm not angling for a raise for _me_, Jim.\"  \"What then?\"  He smiled beatifically. \"The boys and I held a little meeting yesterday evening, and we--ah--formed a union, with me as leader. I'd like to discuss the idea of a general wage increase for every one of the exhibits here.\"  \"Higgins, you blackmailer, how can I afford--\"  \"Easy,\" he said. \"You'd hate to lose a few weeks' gross, wouldn't you?\"  \"You mean you'd call a strike?\"  He shrugged. \"If you leave me no choice, how else can I protect my members' interests?\"  After about half an hour of haggling, he sweated me into an across-the-board increase for the entire mob, with a distinct hint of further raises to come. But he also casually let me know the price he's asking to call off the hounds. He wants a partnership in the Institute; a share in the receipts.  If he gets that, it makes him a member of management, and he'll have to quit as union leader. That way I won't have him to contend with as a negotiator.  But I _will_ have him firmly embedded in the organization, and once he gets his foot in the door, he won't be satisfied until he's on top--which means when I'm out.         *       *       *       *       *  But I'm not licked yet! Not after a full lifetime of conniving and swindling! I've been over and over the angles and there's one thing you can always count on--a trickster will always outsmart himself if you give him the chance. I did it with Higgins. Now he's done it with me.  He'll be back here in half an hour to find out whether he gets his partnership or not. Well, he'll get his answer. I'm going to affirm, as per the escape clause in the standard exhibit contract he signed, that he is no longer of scientific value, and the Feds will pick him up and deport him to his home world.  That leaves him two equally nasty choices.  Those fake documents of his were good enough to get him admitted to Earth as a legitimate alien. How the World Police get him back there is their headache--and his.  If he admits the papers were phony, the only way he'll get out of prison will be when it collapses of old age.  So I'll give him a third choice: He can sign an undated confession, which I will keep in my safe, as guarantee against future finagling.  I don't expect to be around forever, you see, though, with that little secret I picked up on Rimbaud II, it'll be a good long time, not even barring accidents, and I've been wondering whom to leave the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science to. Higgins will make a fine successor.  Oh, one more thing he will have to sign. It remains the Corrigan Institute as long as the place is in business.  Try to outcon me, will he?"]]]
