We're going to have to forest this whole area first, and in doing so, change the whole climate. _Then_ it'll....\"  Mellor interrupted him. \"I'm as familiar with the program of the Sahara Reforestation Commission as you are, I am sure, McCord. I need no lecture. See that Miss Desage gets as sympathetic a picture of our work as possible. And, for heaven's sake, don't let anything happen that might influence her toward writing something that would change opinions either at home or in the Reunited Nations.\"  \"I'll do my best,\" Johnny said sourly.  The other clicked off.         *       *       *       *       *  Pierre was handy with another can of beer, already opened. \"So Mademoiselle Desage is to be handled with loving care.\"  Johnny groaned, \"And from what we've seen so far of Mademoiselle Desage, she's going to take quite a bit of loving care to handle.\"  Outside, they could hear the beating of rotors coming in. Two helicopters, from the sound of it. Beer cans in hand they went over to the window and watched them approach.  \"Derek and the girl in one, Mohammed in the other,\" Pierre said. \"Evidently our good captain left the messy work of butchering goats to his men, while he remains on the scene to be as available to our girl Hélène as she will allow.\"  The copters swooped in, landed, the rotors came to a halt and the occupants stepped from the cockpits. The Arab ground crew came running up to take over.  Preceded by Hélène Desage, the two men made their way toward the main office. Even at this distance there seemed to be an aggressive lift to the girl's walk.  \"Oh, oh, my friend,\" Pierre said. \"I am afraid Mademoiselle Desage is unhappy about something.\"  Johnny groaned. \"I think you're right. But smile, Reuben, smile. You heard the city slicker's orders. Handle her with all the care of a new-born heifer.\"  Hélène Desage stormed through the door and glared at Johnny McCord. \"Do you realize what your men are doing?\"  \"I thought I did,\" Johnny said placatingly.  Derek and Mohammed Mohmoud entered behind her. Derek winked at Johnny McCord and made a beeline for the refrigerator. \"Beer, everybody?\" he said.  Mohammed Mohmoud said, \"A soft drink for me, if you please, Mr. Mason.\"  Derek said, \"Sorry, I forgot. Beer, Miss Desage?\"  She turned and glared at him. \"You did nothing whatsoever to prevent them!\"  Derek shrugged. \"That's why we went out there, honey. Did you notice how much damage those goats had done to the trees? Thousands of dollars worth.\"  Johnny said wearily, \"What happened?\" He sank into the chair behind his desk.  The reporter turned to him again. \"Your men are shooting the livestock of those poverty-stricken people.\"  Mohammed Mohmoud said, \"We are keeping an accurate count of every beast destroyed, Mr. McCord.\" His dark face was expressionless.  Johnny McCord attempted to explain to the girl. \"As I told you, Miss Desage, goats are the curse of the desert. They prefer leaves, twigs and even the bark of young trees to grass. The Commission before ever taking on this tremendous project arranged through the Mali Federation government to buy up and have destroyed every grazing animal north of the Niger. It cost millions upon millions. But our work couldn't even begin until it was accomplished.\"  \"But why slaughter the livelihood of those poor people? You could quite easily insist that they return with their flocks to whatever areas are still available to them.\"  Derek offered her a can of beer. She seemed to be going to reject it, but a desert-born thirst changed her mind. She took it without thanking him.  The lanky Canadian said mildly, \"I tried to explain to her that the Tuareg aren't exactly innocent children of the desert. They're known as the Apaches of the Sahara. For a couple of thousand years they've terrified the other nomads. They were slave raiders, bandits. When the Commission started its work the other tribes were glad to sell their animals and take up jobs in the new oases. Send their kids to the new schools we've been building in the towns. Begin fitting into the reality of modern life.\"  Her eyes were flashing now. \"The Apaches of the Sahara, eh? _Bien sur!_ If I remember correctly, the American Apaches were the last of the Indian tribes which you Americans destroyed. The last to resist. Now you export your methods to Africa!\"  Johnny McCord said mildly, \"Miss Desage, it seems to be the thing these days to bleed over the fate of the redman. Actually, there are a greater number of them in the United States today than there were when Columbus landed. But even if you do carry a torch for the noble Indian, picking the Apaches as an example is poor choice. They were bandit tribes, largely living off what they could steal and raid from the Pueblo and other harder working but less warlike Indians. The Tuareg are the North African equivalent.\"  \"Who are you to judge?\" she snapped back. \"Those tribesmen out there are the last defenders of their ancient desert culture. Their flocks are their way of life. You mercilessly butcher them, rob their women and children of their sole source of food and clothing.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Johnny McCord ran his hand over his face in an unhappy gesture. \"Look,\" he said plaintively. \"Those goats and sheep have already been bought and paid for by the Commission. The Tuareg should have destroyed them, or sold them as food to be immediately butchered, several years ago. Where they've been hiding is a mystery. But they simply have no right to be in possession of those animals, no right to be in this part of the country, and, above all, no right to be grazing in our transplants.\"  \"It's their country! What right have you to order them away?\"  Johnny McCord held up his hands, palms upward. \"This country is part of the Mali Federation, Miss Desage. It used to be called French Sudan and South Algeria. The government of the Federation gladly accepted the project of reforestating the Sahara. Why not? We've already succeeded in making one of the most poverty-stricken areas in the world a prosperous one. Far from there being unemployment here, we have a labor shortage. Schools have opened, even universities. Hospitals have sprung up. Highways have been laid out through country that hadn't even trails before. The Federation is booming. If there are a few Tuareg who can't adapt to the new world, it's too bad. Their children will be glad for the change.\"  She seated herself stiffly. \"I am not impressed by your excuses,\" she said.  Johnny shrugged and turned to Mohammed Mohmoud who had been standing silently through all this, almost as though at attention.  Johnny said, \"Did you learn where this band comes from? Where they had kept that many animals for so long without detection?\"  The Moslem officer shook his head. \"They wouldn't reveal that.\"  Johnny looked at Derek Mason. The Canadian shook his head. \"None of them spoke French, Johnny. Or if they did, they wouldn't admit it. When we first came up they looked as though they were going to fight. Happily, the size of the captain's command made them decide otherwise. At any rate, they're putting up no resistance. I let them know through the captain, here, that when they got back to Tissalit, or Timbuktu, they could put in a demand for reimbursement for their animals--if the animals were legally theirs.\"  Johnny looked at the Malian officer again. \"How come you've returned to camp? Shouldn't you be out there with your men?\"  \"There were a few things to be discussed,\" the Moslem said. He looked significantly at the French reporter.  Hélène Desage said, \"Let me warn you, I will not tolerate being sent away. I want to hear this. If I don't, I demand you let me communicate immediately with my magazine and with the Transatlantic Newspaper Alliance for whom I am also doing a series of articles on the Sahara Reforestation _scheme_.\"  Johnny McCord winced. He said, \"There is nothing going on around here, Miss Desage, that is secret. You won't be ordered away.\" He turned to Mohammed Mohmoud. \"What did you wish to discuss, Captain?\"  \"First, what about the camels, asses and horses?\"  \"Shoot them. Practically the only graze between here and Tissalit are our trees.\"  \"And how will they get themselves and their property out of this country?\" the reporter snapped.  Johnny said wearily, \"We'll truck them out, Miss Desage. They and all their property. And while we're doing it, we'll feed them. I imagine, before it's all over it will cost the Commission several thousand dollars.\" He turned back to the desert patrol captain. \"What else?\"  From a tunic pocket Mohammed Mohmoud brought a handgun and handed it to Johnny McCord. \"I thought you might like to see this. They were quite well armed. At first I thought there might be resistance.\"  Johnny turned the automatic over in his hands, scowling at it. \"What's there to see that's special? I don't know much about guns.\"  Mohammed Mohmoud said, \"It was made in Pilsen.\"  Johnny looked up at him. \"Czechoslovakia, eh?\"  The other said, \"So were most of their rifles.\"  Hélène Desage snorted in deprecation. \"So, we'll drag in that old wheeze. The red menace. Blame it on _la Russie_.\"  Johnny McCord said mildly, \"We haven't blamed anything on the Russkies, Miss Desage. The Tuareg have a right to bear arms, there are still dangerous animals in the Mali Federation. And they are free to purchase Czech weapons if they find them better or cheaper than western ones. Don't find an exciting story where there is none. Things are tranquil here.\"  Hélène Desage stared at him. So did Mohammed Mohmoud and Derek Mason for that matter.  Only Pierre Marimbert realized Johnny McCord's position, and he chuckled and went for more beer.   V  Johnny McCord was a man who didn't like to be thrown out of routine. He resented the interference with his schedule of the past few days. By "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51799"],["title","Farmer (#5)"],["body","he was methodical, not given to inspiration.  All of which was probably the reason that he spent a sleepless night trying to find rhyme and reason where seemingly there was none.  At dawn, he stepped from the door of his Quonset hut quarters and looked for a moment into the gigantic red ball which was the Saharan sun. Neither dawn nor sunset at Bidon Cinq were spectacular, nor would they become so until the Sahara Reforestation Commission began to return moisture to desert skies. Johnny wondered if he would live to see it.  He made his way over to the huge steel shed which doubled as garage and aircraft hanger. As yet, none of the native mechanics were stirring, although he could hear sounds of activity in the community kitchen.  Derek Mason looked up from his inspection of Hélène Desage's air-cushion Land Rover.  Johnny McCord scowled at him. \"What in the hell are you doing here?\"  The lanky Canadian came erect and looked for a long moment at his superior. He said finally, soberly, \"It occurs to me that I'm probably doing the same thing you came to do.\"  \"What have you found?\"  \"That a small bomb has been attached to the starter.\"  Johnny didn't change expression. It fitted in. \"What else?\" he said.  Derek handed him a steel ring.  Johnny McCord looked at it, recognized it for what it was and stuck it in his pocket. \"Let's go back to the office. Yell in to the cook to send some coffee over, and call Pierre. We've got some notes to check.\"  Mademoiselle Desage was a late riser. When she entered the office, the three Sahara Reforestation Commission officers were already at work.  She said snappishly to Johnny McCord, \"Today I would like to see these destroyed pumps.\"  Johnny said, his eyebrows questioning, \"How did you know they were destroyed?\"  \"It doesn't seem to be much of a secret. The story is all about the camp.\"  \"Oh?\" Johnny sighed, then drawled to Derek, \"I say, Si, you better go get the hired hand, we might as well finish this up so we can get back to work.\"  Derek nodded and left.  Johnny McCord left the collator he'd been working with, went around behind his desk and sat down. \"Take a chair, Miss Desage. I want to say a few things in the way of background to you.\"  She sat, but said defiantly, \"I have no need of a lengthy lecture on the glories of the Sahara Reforestation Commission.\"  \"Coffee?\" Pierre Marimbert said politely.  \"No, thank you.\"  Johnny said, his voice thoughtful, \"I imagine the real starting point was back about 1957 when the Chinese discovered that a nation's greatest natural resource is its manpower.\"         *       *       *       *       *  She frowned at him. \"What in the world are you talking about?\"  He ignored her and went on. \"Originally, appalled by the job of feeding over half a billion mouths, they had initiated a birth control plan. But after a year or two they saw it was the wrong approach. They were going to succeed, if they succeeded, in their _Great Leaps Forward_ by utilizing the labor of every man, woman and child in the country. And that's what they proceeded to do. The lesson was brought home to the rest of the world in less than ten years, when such other countries as India and Indonesia failed to do the same.\"  Johnny leaned back in his chair, and his eyes were thoughtful but unseeing. \"Even we of the west learned the lesson. The most important factor in our leadership was our wonderful trained labor force. As far back as 1960 we had more than 65 million Americans working daily in industry and distribution. Even the Russkies, with their larger population, didn't begin to equal that number.\"  \"What are you driveling about?\" the reporter demanded.  \"To sum it up,\" Johnny said mildly, \"the battle for men's minds continues and each of the world's great powers has discovered that it can't afford to limit its population--its greatest resource. So population continues to explode and the world is currently frantically seeking sources of food for its new billions. The Amazon basin is being made into a tropical garden; the Japanese, landless, are devising a hundred methods of farming the sea; Australia is debouching into its long unpopulated interior, doing much the same things we are here in the Sahara. The Chinese are over-flowing into Sinkiang, Mongolia and Tibet; the Russkies into Siberia. We of the west, with the large underdeveloped areas of the western hemisphere have not been so greatly pushed as some others. However, there is always tomorrow.\"  Derek entered with Captain Mohammed Mohmoud. The latter day Rudolph Valentino had a puzzled expression on his dark face.  \"Here's the hired man, Hiram,\" Derek drawled.  The desert patrol officer nodded questioningly to the men and said, \"_Bonjour_,\" to Hélène Desage.  Johnny went on. \"Yes, there's tomorrow. And by the time we run out of _Lebensraum_ in Brazil and Alaska, in Central America and the Argentine, in Texas and Saskatchewan, we're going to need the three million square miles of the Sahara.\"  She said in ridicule, \"It will take you a century at least to reforest the desert.\"  \"At least.\" Johnny nodded agreeably. \"And we're willing and able to look that far ahead. Possibly by that time our opponents will also be looking for new lands for their expanding peoples. And where will they find them? The advantage will be ours, Miss Desage.\"  Mohammed Mohmoud looked from one to the other, frowning. \"What are we discussing?\" he said. \"I should be getting back to my men.\"  Derek yawned and said, \"Forget about it, pal. You're never going to be getting back to your men again.\"         *       *       *       *       *  The desert patrol officer's eyes widened. He turned his glare on Johnny McCord, \"What is all this?\"  Johnny said, \"I'll tell it, Derek.\"  Hélène Desage was as surprised as the Malian. \"What is going on? Are you trying to whitewash yourselves by casting blame on this gentleman?\"  \"Let me go on,\" Johnny said. \"Needless to say, there are conflicting interests. The Soviet Complex obviously would as soon we didn't succeed. However, wars are impractical today, and the Russkies and Chinese are taken up with their own development. The Southeast Asia bloc wouldn't mind taking over here themselves, they desperately need land already. But they aren't our biggest opponents. There's another group even more involved--the _colons_ of Algeria and Morocco and those of even such Mali cities as Dakar. I suppose it is this last element that you represent, Miss Desage.\"  She was staring unbelievingly at him now.  \"Their interest is to get the Sahara Reforestation Commission out of the way so that they can immediately exploit the area. They are interested in the _now_, not the potentialities of the future. They resent the use of the Niger for reforestation, when they could use it for immediate irrigation projects. They would devote the full resources of the Mali Federation and Algeria to seeking oil and minerals and in the various other ways the country might be exploited. Finally, they rather hate to see the western schools, hospitals, and other means used to raise the local living standards. They liked the low wage rates that formerly applied.\"  Johnny nodded. \"Yes, I imagine that's your angle.\"  Hélène Desage stormed to her feet. \"I don't have to listen to this!\"  Derek said, \"Honey, we sure aren't holding you. You're free to go any time you want. And you can take this pal of yours along with you.\" He jerked his head contemptuously at Mohammed Mohmoud.  Pierre Marimbert said, \"Mademoiselle, we have no idea of where you two met originally, nor how close your relationship, but the captain should have remembered that I too am French. A gentleman, on first meeting a lady, would never, never address her as _tu in our_ language.\"  Johnny sighed again and looked at his watch. \"Other things pile up too, Miss Desage. You let slip a few moments ago that you knew about the pumps being destroyed. You said the rumor was all around camp. But it couldn't be. The only persons who knew about it were myself, Pierre and Derek. On top of that, there were no signs of bedouin or animals near the exploded pumps; the person who did the job must have come in an aircraft or air-cushion car. And, besides, we found the pin of a hand grenade in your land rover this morning. We had thought at first that dynamite had been used, but evidently you smuggled your much more compact bombs across the desert with you. Obviously, no one would have dreamed of searching your vehicle.  \"No, Miss Desage, it's obvious that you detoured from the track on the way down from Poste Weygand, went over to In Ziza, a comparatively short distance, and blew up twenty-five of our pumps.\"  Johnny turned to the Malian officer now. \"At the same time you were coordinating with her, you and whatever gang is hiring you. Someone supplied those Tuareg with the livestock and paid them to trek up here. You, of course, turned your back and let them through. The same someone who supplied the livestock also supplied Czech weapons.\"  Hélène Desage was still sputtering indignation. \"Ridiculous! Why? What would motivate me to such nonsense?\"  Johnny grimaced. \"The whole thing makes a beautiful story at a time when the American government is debating the practicality of the whole project. You could do quite a sob story on the poor, poverty-stricken Tuareg having their livestock destroyed. Then, quite a tale about the bedouin raiding our pumping stations and blowing them up. And quite a tale about the Tuareg being armed with Czech weapons. Oh, I imagine before it was through you'd have drawn a picture of civil war going on here between the nomads and the Commission. Blowing up your own car with a small bomb attached to the starter was just one more item. By the way, were you going to do it yourself? Or did you intend to allow one of our mechanics to kill himself?\"  She flushed. \"Don't be ridiculous. No one would have been hurt. The bomb is a very small one. More smoke and flash than"]]]
