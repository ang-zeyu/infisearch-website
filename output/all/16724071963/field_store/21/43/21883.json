The city had the aura of oppression and decay he thought of as belonging to nineteenth century London.  Danniels had waited out New Year's and St. Valentine's in a cell between a convicted burglar and an endless parade of drunks. Finally, two weeks ago the mayor himself came, apologizing profusely but without much feeling. Danniels was escorted to the old Milne Laboratory buildings and told to go to work on his idea. He had, they said, two weeks to produce. And he was getting nowhere.  His deadline was up. The deadline of the real world. But the one he had given himself was much, much more pressing.  \"You'll kill yourself if you don't get some sleep,\" the girl's voice said behind his back.  Danniels closed the drawer on the nearly depleted sack of grain. It was the girl. Julie Amprey. He had been expecting her but not anticipating her. He didn't like her very much. The only reason he could conceive for her venture Outside was a search for thrills. It might be understandable, if immature, in a man; but he found it unattractive in a woman. He had no illusions about masculine superiority, but women were socially, if not physically and emotionally, ill-equipped for simple adventuring.  Julie was more attractive dressed in a woman's clothes, even if they were a dozen years out of style. Her hair had a titian glint. She was perhaps really too slender for the green knit dress.         *       *       *       *       *  \"It's a big job,\" he said. \"I'm beginning to think it's a lifetime job.\"  He half-turned and motioned awkwardly at the lab table and the naked piece of electronics.  \"That's the encephalographic projector I jury-rigged,\" he explained.  \"You can spare me the fifty-cent tour,\" Julie said.  He wondered how she had managed to get so irritating in such a short lifetime. \"There's not much else to see,\" Danniels grunted. \"I've got some reaction out of the bacteria, but I can't seem to control their reproduction or channel them into a food-producing cycle.\"  Julie tossed her head.  \"Oh, I can tell you why you haven't done that,\" she said.  He didn't like the way she said that. \"Why?\"  \"You don't _want_ to control them,\" Julie said simply. \"If you really control them, you'll cause some to be recessive. You'll breed some strains out of existence. You'll _kill_ some of them. And you don't want to kill any living thing.\"  She was wrong.  He wanted to kill her.  But he couldn't. She was right about the bacteria. He should have realized it before. He had planned for almost a year, and worked for two weeks; and this girl had walked in and destroyed everything in five minutes. But she was right; he spun towards the door.  \"Where are you going?\" she demanded.  \"I'm leaving. See what somebody else can do with the idea.\"  \"But where are you going?\" Julie repeated.  \"Nowhere.\"  And he was absolutely right.  Danniels walked aimlessly through the littered streets for the rest of the day and night. He couldn't remember walking at night, but neither could he remember staying anywhere when he discovered dawn in the sky.  It was that time of dawn that looks strangely like an old two-color process movies that they show on TV occasionally--all orange and green, with no yellow to it at all, when even the truest black seems only an off-brown or a sinister purple.  He shivered in the chill of morning and decided what to do.  He would have to walk around for a few hours even yet.         *       *       *       *       *  The drink his friend, Paul, placed before him was not entirely distinct. Neither were the bills he had in his hand. It was money the mayor's hireling had given him to use for laboratory supplies. Danniels peeled off a bill of uncertain denomination and gave it to his friend. Paul seemed pleased. He put it into the pocket of his white shirt, the pocket eight inches below and slightly to the left of the black bow tie, and polished the bar briskly.  Danniels picked up the glass and sipped silently until it was empty.  \"Do you want to talk about anything, Abe?\" Paul asked solicitously.  \"No,\" Danniels said cheerfully. \"Just give me another drink.\"  \"Sure thing.\"  Danniels studied his green hair in the glass. Here, the mark of the Jonah wasn't important. Not yet. But he would be unwelcome even here after the time of Disaster ran out. He would have to move on sooner or later. Eventually--why not now? That slogan went better than the one in pink light over the mirror--The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous. There hadn't been any Milwaukee beer here for thirteen years. Most of the stuff came out of bathtubs.  Why not now?  He smoothed another bill on the damp polished wood and negotiated his way through the hazy room.  Outside, he turned a corner and the city dropped away from him. He seemed to be in a giant amusement park with acres of empty ground patterned off in squares by unwinking dots of light.  He grinned to himself, changed direction with great care, and started down the one-way street to the lake front.  He heard the footsteps behind him.  Danniels put his palm to the brick wall, scaling posters, and turned.  The clean-cut young man smiled disarmingly. \"I saw you in at Paul's. You'll never make it home under your own power. Better let me take you in my cab.\"  Danniels knocked him out on his feet with a clean right cross.  He blinked down at the boy. Self-preservation had become instinctive with him during his months as a wandering Jonah.  Gnawing at his under lip, he studied the twisted way the supposed cabbie lay. If he really were.... Danniels patted the man down and brought something out of a hip pocket.  He inspected the leather blackjack, weighing it critically in his hand.  It slid out of his palm and thudded heavily on the cracked sidewalk.  Danniels shrugged and grinned and moved unsteadily away. Towards the lake.  The lake looked gray and winterish.  There was no help for it.  Danniels swung his leg over the rust-spotted railing and looked down to where the water lapped at crumbling bricks blotched with green. He peered out over the water. Only a few miles to the beach where he had left the car parked in the undergrowth. He would have preferred to use the little sub, but he could swim it if he had to.  The surface below showed clearly in the globe lights.  Danniels dived.  Before he hit the water, he remembered that he should have taken off some of his clothes.  When he parted the icy foam with his body, he knew he had committed suicide. And he realized that that had been what he intended to do all along.         *       *       *       *       *  There was something in the lake holding him, and it had a twelve-foot reach.  It kept holding on to him under the surface of green ice and begging him for help. He couldn't breathe, and he couldn't help. Of the two, not being able to help seemed the worse. Not breathing wasn't so bad.... It hurt to breathe. It choked him. It was very unpleasant to breathe. He had much preferred not breathing to this....  Some time later, he opened his eyes.  A small, round-faced man was staring down at him through slender-framed spectacles. For a moment he thought it was the man in whose face he had smashed the car door at the diner weeks before. But this man was different--among other things his glasses were gold, not silver. Yet he was also the same. Danniels knew the signs of the Wolf Pack.  \"How's your foot?\" the little man asked in a surprisingly full-bodied voice.  Danniels instantly became aware of a dull sub-pain sensation in the toes of his left foot. He looked over the crest of his chest and saw the foot, naked below the cuff of his wrinkled trousers. The three smaller toes were red. No, maroon. A red so dark it was almost black. Fainter streaks of red shot away from the toes, following the tendon.  Danniels swallowed. \"The foot doesn't _feel_ so bad, but I think it _is_.\"  \"We may have to operate,\" the small man said eagerly.  \"How did I get out of the lake?\"  \"Joel. The man you knocked out. He came to and followed you. Naturally, he had to save your life. He banged your foot up dragging you ashore.\"  Or afterwards, Danniels thought.  Abruptly, the stranger was gone and a door was closing and latching on the other side of the room.  Danniels tried to rise and fell back, his head floating around somewhere above him. Maybe a Wolf Pack member would have to save his life but he wouldn't have to bring him home and nurse him back to health.  Why?  He fell asleep without even trying to guess the answer.  He woke when they brought food to him.  Danniels finished with the tray and sat it aside.  The small man who had identified himself as Richard beamed. \"I think you are strong enough to attend the celebration tonight.\"  Danniels did feel stronger after rest and food, but at the same time he felt vaguely dizzy and his leg was beginning to hurt. \"What kind of a celebration?\" he asked.  Richard chuckled. \"Don't worry. You'll like it.\"  Danniels had seen the same expression of the faces of hosts at stag dinners; but with a Wolf Pack it was hard to know what to expect.   IV  The place he was in did not seem to be a house after all.  Danniels leaned on the shoulder of Richard, who helped him along solicitously. They entered a large chamber nearly a hundred feet wide. There were people there. It wasn't crowded but there were many people standing around the walls. A lot of them were holding three-foot lengths of wood.  Richard led him to a chair, the only one apparent in the room.  \"I'll go tell we're ready now,\" the small man said, chuckling.  Danniels looked around slowly at the shadowed faces. Of those holding clubs, he knew only the man Richard had told him was Joel, the man who had pulled him from Lake Michigan. Apparently the ones with clubs were members of the Pack, while the others were observers and potential members. Among these, he spotted a member of the city council.  And Julie.  She stood in a loose sweater and skirt, her hands hugging her"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51832"],["title","The Place Where Chicago Was (#4)"],["body","lbows, eyes intent on the empty center of the room. Danniels was reminded of some of the women he had seen at unorthodox political meetings.  Danniels was surprised to find that he wanted to talk to her. He might try hobbling over to her or calling her over to him. But with the instinct he had developed while being hunted, he knew it was wrong to call attention to the two of them together.  He noticed that he was in line with the door. Julie would have to pass by him when she left ... after the celebration.  \"The celebration begins in five minutes.\"  Someone he hadn't seen had shouted into the big room. The words bounced back slightly and hung suspended.  The people's waiting became an activity. Tension lived in the room.  And then the cat was released.  The Pack members moved apart from the rest and struck at the scrawny yellow beast. The cat didn't make it very far down the line. The men from the other end of the room moved up quickly to be in on the kill.  The clubs rose and fell even after it was clear there was no reason for it.  Their ranks parted and they left their handiwork where it could be admired.  It must be hard to find animals in a closed city like this, Danniels thought. It must be quite a treat to find one to beat to death.  He sat and waited for them to leave. But he found the Celebration was just beginning. The group was laughing and talking. Now that it was over they wanted to talk about it the rest of the evening. They had created death.  He searched out Julie Amprey again. She was looking at what they did. He thought she was sick at first. His lips thinned. Yes, she was sick.  Her eyes suddenly met his. Shock washed over her face, and in the next moment she was moving to him.  \"So,\" she said coolly, \"you found out my little secret. This is where I get my kicks.\"  He nodded, thinking of nothing to say.  \"Did you ever read them?\" she asked breathlessly. \"All the old banned books--Poe and Spillane and Proust. The pornography of death. I grew up on them, so you see there's no harm in them. Look at me.\"  \"You want to kill?\" Danniels asked her.  She lit an expensive king-size cigarette. \"Yes,\" she exhaled. \"I thought I might join a Pack on the Outside. But, you'll remember, I didn't quite make it. I couldn't even kill a cockroach. I want to, but the damned Broadcasters keep interfering with me.\"  Richard came back, smiling broadly. \"Well, Abe, has Miss Amprey been telling you of our plans to ruin the planet?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Danniels was incredibly tired. He had been listening and arguing for hours.  \"You're a scientist,\" Joel persisted. \"Help us.\"  \"There are different kinds of scientists,\" Danniels repeated. \"I'm not a nuclear physicist.\"  \"Right there.\" Richard tapped the pink rubber of his pencil against the map of Cook County. \"Right there. An Armory no one else knows anything about. Enough H-bombs to wipe out human life on the planet. And rockets to send them in.\"  \"The councilman may be lying,\" Danniels said. \"How do you think he should happen to find it and no one else?\"  \"The information was in the city records,\" Richard said patiently, \"but buried and coded so it would take twenty years to locate. Bureaucracy is an insidious evil, Abe.\"  Danniels rubbed his face with his palms. \"I'm not even sure if I understand what you mean to do. You want to rocket the H-bombs out almost but not quite beyond Earth's gravitation and explode them so the fallout will be evenly distributed over the surface of the planet. You think it will cause no more than injury and destruction--\"  \"That's all,\" Joel said sharply.  Richard gave an eager nod.  They had had to convince themselves of that, he knew. \"But why do you want to do anything as desperate as that?\"  \"Simple revenge.\" Richard's tone was even and cold. \"And to show them what we can do if they don't cut off the Broadcasters.\" The small man's liquid brown eyes softened. \"You've got to understand that we really don't want to kill people. Our actions are merely necessary demonstrations against insane visionary politics. I only want the Broadcasters shut off so I can do efficient police work--Joel, so that he can fight in the ring with the true will to win of a sportsman. The rest of us have equally good reasons.\"  \"I think I understand,\" Danniels said. \"I'll do what I can to help you.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Danniels was not surprised when Julie Amprey was in the raiding party. He was past the capacity for surprise.  He was getting around on his own today only because he was learning to stand the pain. It was worse. And he was weak and dizzy from a fever.  They had all managed to produce bicycles. Richard had even managed to find one for him with a tiny engine powered by solar-charged batteries.  Julie looked crisp and attractive in sweater and jeans. Joel was strikingly handsome in the clear sun, and even Richard looked like a jolly fatherly type.  As they wheeled down the street, Danniels was afraid only he with his wet, tossed green hair and drooping cheeks warped the holiday mood of those who in some other probability sequence were happy picnickers.  When they reached the place, Richard giggled nervously.  \"It takes a code to open the hatch,\" he explained. \"If Aldrich didn't decode it correctly there will be a small but effective chemical explosion in this area.\"  Danniels leaned against a maple, watching. The bicycles were parked in the brush and a shallow hole had been dug at an exact spot in the suburban park. Only a few inches below ground was the gray steel door flush with the level of grass.  Richard hummed as he worked a prosaic combination dial.  Finally there was a muffled click and a churning whine began.  The hatch raised jerkily and latched at right angles.  The Pack milled about the opening, excited. Joel got the honor of going down first. Richard seemed to fumble his chance for the glory, Danniels observed. The other men went down, one and one. And finally only Julie and Richard were left. He supposed that this meant the girl had been accepted as a full member of the Wolf Pack. That would change the whole character of the organization. He vaguely wondered who her sponsor was. Joel?  Julie and the little man came to him. They started to help him down into the opening and suddenly he was at the bottom of a ladder. Things were beginning to seem to him as if they were taking place underwater.  They walked down a corridor of shadow, lit only by tarnished yellow from red sparks caught on the tips of silver wire inside water-clear bulbs recessed in the concrete ceiling.  When they passed a certain point sparks showered from slots in opposite walls. They burned out ineffectively before they reached the floor of cross-hatched metallic mats.  \"Power failing,\" Richard observed with a chuckle. \"Congress should investigate the builders.\"  There was a large, sliding door many feet thick but so well-balanced it slid open easily. And they were there.         *       *       *       *       *  It was a big room full of many little rooms. Each little room had a door that a man could enter by stooping and a chair-ledge inside for him to sit and read or adjust instruments. The outside of the rooms were finished off cleanly in shining metal with large, rugged objects fitted to all sides. These were hydrogen bombs.  The Wolf Pack ranged joyously through the maze.  Danniels found one of several stacks of small instruments and sat down on it. The things looked like radios but obviously weren't.  Richard came to him, wringing his hands. \"These bombs seemed to be designed to be dropped from bombers. There are supposed to be rockets here too. I hope the H-bombs will fit. They seem so bulky....\"  \"Perhaps the rockets have self-contained bomb units,\" Danniels suggested.  \"Perhaps. We're all going off and try to find the rockets. You'd be amazed at all the cutoffs down here. I'll leave Joel here to look after you.\"  Danniels sat on the instruments. Joel stayed several hundred feet away, an uncertain shadow in the light, smoking a red dot of a cigarette. Somehow Danniels associated fire and munitions instead of atomics and felt uneasy.  He discovered Julie Amprey at his side. She didn't say anything. She seemed to be sulking. Like a spoiled brat, he thought.  He fingered one of the portable instruments from an open crate beside him. \"Wonder what these are?\" he said to break up the heavy silence.  \"Pseudo-H Bombs,\" the girl snapped.  Of course. Just as money had to be backed by gold or silver reserves, every pseudo bomb or mock-gas had to be backed by the real thing which, after its representative had been used, was dismantled, neutralized or retired. International inspection saw to that.  \"There's enough here to blow up the whole world ... if they were real,\" Danniels said.  The girl pointed out into the chamber. \"Those _are_ real.\"  Each nation had many times over the nuclear armament necessary to destroy human life. There was enough for that right in this vault--both in reality and in the Games.  Danniels stopped drifting and took a course. He stopped observing and began to act. There was a mob in action.  Even if they did somehow manage not to kill off the population with the fallout they were engineering, they would ruin farmland, create new recessive mutations.  Famine would cease to be a psychological affliction for half the world and become a physiological reality instead ... for all the world.  He had failed in his plans to end the psychological Famine because of his own attunement to the Broadcasters. He wouldn't fail in stopping the new physiological Famine.   V  \"Put that thing down,\" Joel said. \"I don't trust you any further than I can spit, and that looks like a radio. You trying to warn the city council?\"  Danniels put down the instrument. One wouldn't do it, and he could tell from Joel's eyes that he would get a very bad experience out of disobeying him.  \"You were going to do something,\" Julie said. \""]]]
