But then I had to be someone's daughter and since my name is Cheever, you may be right. I don't remember you. We must have met ages and ages ago.\"  \"This is the first time we've met. You were pointed out to me by a friend.\"  She considered this with a puzzled air, and, idly curious, said, \"Do you want to marry me?\"  \"Good heavens, no!\"  Jenny didn't seem to be insulted by his abruptness. \"I just wondered why you'd speak to me,\" she said. \"Because if you want to marry me you have to wait. I've promised to marry him first.\" She gestured to the man on the bench with her. The man looked at Staghorn for the first time.  \"Yeah,\" he said.         *       *       *       *       *  \"I see,\" said Staghorn. \"And when is this ... merry event to take place?\"  \"Some day,\" Jenny said indifferently. \"When we both feel like it. There's no use rushing things. I don't want to use up all the men too soon.\"  \"Use them up?\"  \"He'll be my twenty-fifth husband.\"  \"Yeah,\" said the man. \"She'll be my thirty-second wife.\"  \"Your marriages can't last very long,\" said Staghorn. Despite the physical attractiveness of both Jenny and her escort, Staghorn began to feel clammy in their presence. He had an impression of deep ill health, a sense of unclean, almost reptilian lassitude.  \"They get shorter all the time,\" said Jenny, and turned away as though the conversation bored her. The man too had lost interest.  Staghorn stood ignored for a moment and then spoke bluntly.  \"Who are the Atavars?\"  The word produced the first genuine reaction. Jenny leaped to her feet. The man turned red.  \"Don't say that word!\" Jenny said.  \"I'm sorry. I'm a stranger.\"  \"No one can be that much of a stranger!\"  \"It's indecent,\" the man said. He stood up and touched Jenny's arm. \"I feel my blood pounding. Let's go get married.\"  Jenny nodded and, with a cold glance at Staghorn, moved away with her companion. Staghorn was tempted to follow and demand an answer to his question when he saw Miss Terry approaching. Miss Terry was more likely to have the information he needed, and in any case--since she was only in her fifties--she was less than half of Jenny Cheever's age. He hoped this would make a difference in her attitude. That she was capable of emotion he already knew. Her expression, as she approached, was disconsolate.  Staghorn bowed low before her and introduced himself. \"Good afternoon, Miss Terry. I'm a stranger to you but since you're a teacher by profession, you may have heard of me. I'm Dr. Roger Staghorn.\" He straightened, twisted his lips into a smile and waited for Miss Terry to associate his name with those scientific achievements that had so startled the world a hundred years earlier. To his chagrin Miss Terry only gazed at him blankly and shook her head.         *       *       *       *       *  \"No,\" she murmured. Then tears formed in her eyes and she tried to move on. Staghorn stopped her.  \"Forgive me,\" he said. \"I'm aware of your recent loss. Your pupil, Paul.\"  Her tears dropped more freely. \"Sooner or later I knew they'd get him. The only child in town. And now I have nothing to do. Nothing at all!\"  \"They? Just who are they--the Atavars?\"  Miss Terry turned pale. \"Don't say it,\" she pleaded. \"In time I'll forget.\"  \"But where have they taken Paul? And what will they do with him?\"  \"He'll die, of course.\" She spoke these words almost indifferently, then wept copiously as she added, \"But I'll live on with nothing to do!\"  \"Then why didn't someone stop them?\" He gestured angrily at the handsome young males wandering through the park. \"All these men--why don't they rescue Paul?\"  This suggestion so shocked Miss Terry that she stopped weeping. \"That's impossible! There'd be violence. Someone might get killed!\"  \"They think of _that_ with a boy's life at stake?\" Staghorn felt his rage rising. He was an irascible man by nature and had controlled himself so far only because he knew he was part of an illusion. The sense of illusion was fading rapidly, however. The guiding principles of morals and ethics were themselves abstractions and therefore operated just as powerfully in an abstract universe. He grasped Miss Terry by the arm.  \"I'll go after him myself. Where do I find him?\"  \"You can't find him! If you follow they'll capture you too!\"  \"I'll chance that! Where have they gone?\"  \"I can't tell you! They might punish me!\"  Staghorn shook her heartily, ignoring the fact that she was over fifty. \"Tell me! It so happens that besides Paul, they've captured Dr. Clarence Peccary, and I'm responsible for his life!\"  At this statement Miss Terry let out a cry of horror. \"They've caught Dr. Peccary? No! No!\"  \"They most certainly have. So hurry up and tell me--\"  \"We'll all die!\" wailed Miss Terry. \"We'll all die!\"  \"In that case it can't hurt you to tell me.\"  \"The mountains!\" cried Miss Terry. \"High Canyon!\"  It was with great difficulty that Staghorn forced directions from her. The news of Peccary's capture had unsettled her entirely. But despite the roughness with which he was forced to use her, no one came to her rescue. Several young men and women gathered at a safe distance to watch, but they did nothing to interfere.         *       *       *       *       *  Staghorn finally elicited the information that High Canyon was several miles north of town and could be reached by following a dirt road. To his inquiry as to where he could rent a car, Miss Terry went blank again. There were no cars. They had been abolished before Miss Terry was born. She thought there might be one in the museum.  Staghorn glanced at his watch.  He'd already been in the transmitter thirty minutes. He had only two and a half hours to get to High Canyon, rescue Dr. Peccary and Paul and return to the square. He dared not cut it too fine. He'd have to be back with a few minutes to spare.  So, after learning the location of the museum, he took off at a run.  It was evident that at some period in the past the town had gone through a surge of prosperity, for there were several quite majestic buildings whose cornerstones bore dates of the late twentieth century. But it was also clear that during the last fifty years not only had few new enterprises been started but the old ones had been allowed to languish. The museum even lacked an attendant at the door--unless one gave this title to the bust of Dr. Peccary which stood on a pedestal just inside the entrance. The plaque beneath the bust noted that Dr. Peccary had given the museum to the city in 1985 \"to preserve for our immortal posterity a true picture of the world of mortals.\"  In the seven and a half decades since, however, this true picture had suffered badly.  In the absence of curtains and draperies, and in the nudeness of the mannekins whose purpose could only have been to display twentieth century costumes, Staghorn gained a hint as to where the populace got at least a part of the rags they wore. He didn't pause to examine details, however. A wall directory with a faded map of the building had given him the location of the wing of twentieth century machines. He headed there at once, passing by displays of tractors, bulldozers, jackhammers and other commonplaces before reaching the automobiles.  There was an excellent selection of standard and sports models, all a uniform gray under their coats of dust--and all of them out of gas.  After so long a time it was doubtful if any would have run anyway. He had simply hoped that one lone attendant might have kept one in working condition.  In the next room, however, he found the reward for his effort. Bicycles. He chose a racing model.  A few minutes later he was pedaling rapidly northward on the dirt road that led to High Canyon.   IV  Dr. Peccary could feel fingers probing at his sore head. A bit of damp cloth or cotton was pressed against his upper lip. The sharp odor that stabbed his nostrils made him jerk his head away and suck in his breath.  \"Good. He's coming around.\"  Dr. Peccary opened his eyes. For a few seconds faces and objects swung around him giddily, but finally the environment achieved stability. He saw that he was in a log cabin, on a bunk. Seated in a chair beside him was a man whose manner could belong only to a doctor. Standing behind the doctor was the bearded man.  \"He'll be all right,\" the doctor said, packing bottles and probes into his little black bag.  Dr. Peccary sat up and touched the back of his head gingerly. It was very, very sore. He'd never had an illusion quite like this before. Besides, the illusion had persisted too long. How long had he been out? Hours? Days? Good lord, had Staghorn deserted him?  The bearded man ushered the doctor out, locked the door and came back to observe Peccary. He put a booted foot on the chair and leaned an elbow on his knee.  \"I hardly need tell you, Dr. Peccary,\" he said, \"that this is the happiest day of my life.\"  \"But not of mine,\" Peccary responded sourly. \"I doubt if you can make it a bit worse by telling me what this is all about and what you plan to do with me.\"  The bearded man showed surprise. \"You don't know?\"  \"No! I don't know!\" Peccary was losing his detachment.  The bearded man considered him thoughtfully. \"I shouldn't have let the doctor go so soon. Apparently you were hit harder than we thought. On the other hand it's just possible, living as you have these last seventy years locked up in your palace and isolated from the rest of the world, that you've lost touch with what is going on.\"  \"I've lost touch with a great many things. Obviously I'm a prisoner. How long is this going to last?\"  \"Only until my demolition squad is ready. Then we take you to your production plant where you produce the Y Hormone. There will be a gun at your back, of course. You know the combination to get us safely past the automatic guards. "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51801"],["title","The Immortals (#5)"],["body","Ah, I've waited all my life for this! Once we're in the plant, my men will do the rest.\"  \"You're going to blow it up?\"  \"Absolutely!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"And what do you gain by that? The formula for the Y Hormone still exists!\"  The bearded man laughed. \"Yes, I can see you've been out of touch with the world. It's been thirty years since the country produced anyone capable of working with that formula. That's when the last university closed down--thirty years ago.\"  \"That's shocking,\" said Dr. Peccary. \"But my experiments showed conclusively that the Y Hormone has no deleterious effect upon intelligence. I took every precaution!\"  \"Nothing wrong with anyone's intelligence,\" said the bearded man, \"except that no one's under pressure to use it. When the future stretches on indefinitely, it gets easier and easier to put things off until tomorrow--even education--until finally it's put off forever. There's only one man living who understands that formula.\"  \"And who is that?\"  The bearded man looked down at him hatefully. \"Yourself, Dr. Peccary! That's why we're so delighted to capture you--because now you'll never use it again!\"  Peccary stared at him aghast. \"I understand now! You mean to steal it. You mean to force it out of me and start producing the Y Hormone yourself!\"  This accusation resulted in a violent reaction from the bearded man. He grasped Peccary by the lapels of his jacket and hauled him to his feet. Peccary could feel the man's powerful hands trembling with rage.  \"You fool! You utter imbecile! Don't you even yet know who we are?\"  Peccary was so throttled by the man's clutch that he could only waggle his head in the negative. The bearded man's face came close to his.  \"We're mortals!\" He flung Peccary back on the bunk contemptuously. \"We accept our allotted span of years and call it quits. But during that time we live! We have to. It's all the time we have!\" He glared at Peccary a moment before resuming in a milder tone. \"After we destroy your production plant, Dr. Peccary, we're going to kill you. You might as well know. It's the only way to make certain that the formula for the Y Hormone will never be used again.\" Then he smiled. \"But take consolation. With the plant destroyed you'd gradually get old and die anyway. For the brief period before we execute you, you might even regain an appreciation for life.\" He bent suddenly, gripped Peccary's wrist and hauled him to his feet again. \"In fact, you might have forgotten what life is. I'll refresh your memory. Come along!\"  He dragged Peccary to the door, opened it and led him outside.  Peccary looked around. He found himself on the level floor of a canyon whose vertical walls rose high on either side. He recognized the place at once. Often when he was a boy he'd come here to camp overnight. It had been a delightful wilderness with a year-round stream.         *       *       *       *       *  The canyon had changed. Some forty cabins like the one he'd been in were built in the shade of the southern cliff, and the canyon floor was covered with green crops and pasture. He heard singing, laughter. People were at work in the fields, children were building rock castles at the base of the cliff. On a cabin porch two elderly men sat playing checkers.  \"The last of the mortals,\" said the bearded man. \"If there are any other colonies we don't know of them. But when you're gone, Dr. Peccary, they'll be the first of a new race! You asked earlier what we intended to do with the boy we kidnaped. There he is.\" And he pointed toward the canyon wall.  Peccary looked and saw Paul climbing upward along crevices and ledges. The bearded man cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted. \"Paul! How is it?\"  The boy straightened on a rocky pinnacle and looked back. His face was ecstatic. \"I'm climbing!\" he crowed. \"I've never been so high! I'm climbing all the way to the top!\" He waved and clambered on.  \"Once in a great while a child is born to one of the immortals,\" the bearded man said. \"If we find him in time we can save him.\"  Peccary watched the boy move upward along the cliff. \"Then why was he so terrified when you captured him?\"  \"Because he'd had it pounded into him that if the Atavars got him he'd die. He will, too, eventually. Like any other mortal. But in the meanwhile--\" He broke off and turned on Peccary savagely. \"You see, there's one thing you didn't consider at all! The Y Hormone stops aging and keeps people healthy, but it can't protect them from accidents. The immortals can still die if they get hit by a train or fall overboard in the middle of the ocean. A mortal can accept the possibility of accidental death because he knows he's going to die anyway sooner or later, but can't you see the psychological shock to the immortals when one of them dies? A man who had the potential of living forever, suddenly wiped out! It's like the end of the world. And so they started eliminating hazards. Automobiles went first. Then planes and trains. They weren't needed anyway, because people stopped traveling. To travel is to court accident. But one precaution breeds another, and before long people were avoiding all dangerous occupations. With immortality at stake, even the smallest risk was too much. Planing mills, machine shops, mines, smelters--bah! Name me an occupation that doesn't occasionally entail some hazard. Even motherhood!\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"But I anticipated the need for birth control! I had the plans all set up.\"  \"There was birth control all right, but not the way you planned it. Ten years after your hormone went on the market the world had an extra five billion people. For a few years they produced a surge of energy until the older immortals started eliminating the hazards. After that, starvation set in. Three-fourths of the population died. Your hormone can't keep people from starving, either, and it was a shock from which those who survived never recovered. Every new mouth to feed was a threat. Childbirth practically stopped. But that left the remaining immortals in a very soft position. For years now they've been existing on the leftovers from civilization, finding shelter in the old houses, ransacking the attics and closets of the dead for scraps of clothing, daring to plant a few crops in areas where they'll grow with little care. And after that--boredom.\"  He thrust an accusing finger at Peccary. \"And you dared to use the slogan, 'Time to achieve perfection!' I tell you, Dr. Peccary, the source of man's courage and energy is the knowledge of death! Man was meant to be mortal. We strive because we know the time is short. We climb mountains, make love, descend to the depths of the sea and reach for the stars because the certainty of death urges us on. It's the only certainty the world had--and you would destroy it!\"  Peccary quailed before the bearded man's ferocity. He was relieved when his captor's attention was diverted by a party of horsemen who rode up in neat order and stopped before their leader. Several horses were loaded with explosives.  \"We're ready, Sir,\" their spokesman said.  \"Good,\" said the bearded man. \"I see no reason to delay an instant.\"  An extra horse had been provided for Dr. Peccary. He was on the point of being forcibly hoisted into the saddle when he was given a reprieve by a diversion of another kind.  Approaching on the path through the center of the canyon, pedaling his bicycle frantically, came--Staghorn!         *       *       *       *       *  He rode up to the group and leapt from his seat, his face blue from exertion. He'd been climbing all the way from town. He stood gasping for breath while he dragged his big gold watch from his pocket and consulted the time. He managed a groan. \"Only thirty minutes left. Miles to go! But it's down hill all the way; we can make it!\" He shoved his bicycle forward. \"On the handlebars, Dr. Peccary, quick!\"  Peccary would have liked nothing better. But his movement toward Staghorn was stopped instantly by the men who were trying to put him on his horse. \"They're going to kill me!\" he cried. \"They're going to blow up my factory and kill me!\"  \"No, no!\" said Staghorn. \"That can't be. The consequences would be disastrous.\" He turned to the bearded leader. \"Look, Sir, I have no time to explain, and I'm sure you wouldn't believe me even if I did. All of you are illusions! This entire situation is nothing but a mathematical probability. And so I insist that you release my friend, Dr. Peccary, at once!\"  The bearded man was so amazed by this request that he forgot to take offense. He gaped at Staghorn. \"Who are you? I can't imagine an immortal risking himself on a bicycle!\"  \"At this moment I'm desperately mortal, and so is Dr. Peccary!\"  \"Nonsense. Dr. Peccary is a hundred and forty-two years old!\"  \"I've told you this situation has no existence in reality!\"  The bearded man stomped the ground. \"I've been living on this planet fifty-five years. I know reality when I see it! And what's more, I'm beginning to think you _are_ one of the immortals. Even an immortal might show some courage when he knows he's going to be deprived of the Y Hormone.\"  \"If you must know, I'm Dr. Roger Staghorn! I can see that there's industry and education in this canyon and so it's possible you've heard of me. I have quite a record of scientific achievements back in the twentieth century.\"         *       *       *       *       *  At this announcement the bearded man goggled at him, then threw back his head and laughed uproariously. \"You couldn't have picked a worse masquerade. Dr. Roger Staghorn died in 1994!\"  \"I can't help that I'm Staghorn!\"  The bearded man stopped laughing and thrust his face forward threateningly. \"You're a fraud! Because it so happens that _I'm_ Staghorn!\"  \"You? Staghorn?\"  \"I'm Henry Staghorn, great-grandson of the real Dr. Roger Staghorn!\"  \"Impossible. I have no intention of ever getting married!\"  \"Dr. Roger Staghorn married when "]]]
