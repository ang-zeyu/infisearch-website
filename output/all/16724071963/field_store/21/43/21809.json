Two cops were standing by Foster's car. One of them went around to the back and got out a pad and took down the license number, then said something over his shoulder and started across the street. The second cop planted himself by the car, his eye on the front of the hotel.  I whirled on Foster. \"Get your shoes on,\" I croked. \"Let's get the hell out of here.\"  We went down the stairs quietly and found a back door opening on an alley. Nobody saw us go.         *       *       *       *       *  An hour later, I sagged in a grimy coach seat and studied Foster, sitting across from me--a middle-aged nut with the face of a young kid and a mind like a blank slate. I had no choice but to drag him with me; my only chance was to stick close and hope he got back enough of his memory to get me off the hook.  It was time for me to be figuring my next move. I thought about the fifty thousand dollars I had left behind in the car, and groaned. Foster looked concerned.  \"Are you in pain?\" he said.  \"And how I'm in pain,\" I said. \"Before I met you I was a homeless bum, broke and hungry. Now I can add a couple more items: the cops are after me, and I've got a mental case to nursemaid.\"  \"What law have you broken?\" Foster said.  \"None,\" I barked. \"As a crook, I'm a washout. I've planned three larcenies in the last twelve hours, and flunked out on all of them. And now I'm wanted for murder.\"  \"Whom did you kill?\" Foster inquired courteously.  I leaned across so I could snarl in his face: \"You!\" Then, \"Get this through your head, Foster. The only crime I'm guilty of is stupidity. I listened to your crazy story; because of you I'm in a mess I'll never get straightened out.\" I leaned back. \"And then there's the question of old men that take a nap and wake up in their late teens; we'll go into that later, after I've had my nervous breakdown.\"  \"I'm sorry if I've been the cause of difficulty,\" Foster said. \"I wish that I could recall the things you've spoken of. Is there anything I can do to assist you now?\"  \"And you were the one who wanted help,\" I said. \"There is one thing; let me have the money you've got on you; we'll need it.\"  Foster got out his wallet--after I told him where it was--and handed it to me. I looked through it; there was nothing in it with a photo or fingerprints. When Foster said he had arranged matters so that he could disappear without a trace, he hadn't been kidding.  \"We'll go to Miami,\" I said. \"I know a place in the Cuban section where we can lie low, cheap. Maybe if we wait a while, you'll start remembering things.\"  \"Yes,\" Foster said. \"That would be pleasant.\"  \"You haven't forgotten how to talk, at least,\" I said. \"I wonder what else you can do. Do you remember how you made all that money?\"  \"I can remember nothing of your economic system,\" Foster said. He looked around. \"This is a very primitive world, in many respects,\" he said. \"It should not be difficult to amass wealth here.\"  \"I never had much luck at it,\" I said. \"I haven't even been able to amass the price of a meal.\"  \"Food is exchanged for money?\" Foster asked.  \"Everything is exchanged for money,\" I said. \"Including most of the human virtues.\"  \"This is a strange world,\" Foster said. \"It will take me a long while to become accustomed to it.\"  \"Yeah, me, too,\" I said. \"Maybe things would be better on Mars.\"  Foster nodded. \"Perhaps,\" he said. \"Perhaps we should go there.\"  I groaned, then caught myself. \"No, I'm not in pain,\" I said. \"But don't take me so literally, Foster.\"  We rode along in silence for a while.  \"Say, Foster,\" I said. \"Have you still got that notebook of yours?\"  Foster tried several pockets, came up with the book. He looked at it, turned it over, frowning.  \"You remember it?\" I said, watching him.  He shook his head slowly, then ran his finger around the circles embossed on the cover.  \"This pattern,\" he said. \"It signifies....\"  \"Go on, Foster,\" I said. \"Signifies what?\"  \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I don't remember.\"  I took the book and sat looking at it. I didn't really see it, though. I was seeing my future. When Foster didn't turn up, they'd naturally assume he was dead. I'd been with him just before his disappearance. It wasn't hard to see why they'd want to talk to me--and my having vanished too wouldn't help any. My picture would blossom out in post offices all over the country; and even if they didn't catch me right away, the murder charge would always be there, hanging over me.  It wouldn't do any good to turn myself in and tell them the whole story; they wouldn't believe me, and I wouldn't blame them. I didn't really believe it myself, and I'd lived through it. But then, maybe I was just imagining that Foster looked younger. After all, a good night's rest----  I looked at Foster, and almost groaned again. Twenty was stretching it; eighteen was more like it. I was willing to swear he'd never shaved in his life.  \"Foster,\" I said. \"It's got to be in this book; who you are, where you came from----It's the only hope I've got.\"  \"I suggest we read it, then,\" Foster said.  \"A bright idea,\" I said. \"Why didn't I think of that?\" I thumbed through the book to the section in English and read for an hour. Starting with the entry dated January 19, 1710, the writer had scribbled a few lines every few months. He seemed to be some kind of pioneer in the Virginia Colony. He complained about prices, and the Indians, and the ignorance of the other settlers and every now and then threw in a remark about the Enemy. He often took long trips, and when he got home, he complained about those, too.  \"It's a funny thing, Foster,\" I said. \"This is supposed to have been written over a period of a couple of hundred years, but it's all in the same hand. That's kind of odd, isn't it?\"  \"Why should a man's handwriting change?\" Foster said.  \"Well, it might get a little shaky there toward the last, don't you agree?\"  \"Why is that?\"  \"I'll spell it out, Foster,\" I said. \"Most people don't live that long. A hundred years is stretching it, to say nothing of two.\"  \"This must be a very violent world, then,\" Foster said.  \"Skip it,\" I said. \"You talk like you're just visiting. By the way; do you remember how to write?\"  Foster looked thoughtful. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I can write.\"  I handed him the book and the stylus. \"Try it,\" I said. Foster opened to a blank page, wrote, and handed the book back to me.  \"Always and always and always,\" I read.  I looked at Foster. \"What does that mean?\" I looked at the words again, then quickly flipped to the pages written in English. I was no expert on penmanship, but this came up and cracked me right in the eye.  The book was written in Foster's hand.         *       *       *       *       *  \"It doesn't make sense,\" I was saying for the fortieth time. Foster nodded sympathetic agreement.  \"Why would you write out this junk yourself, and then spend all that time and money trying to have it deciphered? You said experts worked over it and couldn't break it. But,\" I went on, \"you must have known you wrote it; you knew your own handwriting. But on the other hand, you had amnesia before; you had the idea you might have told something about yourself in the book....\"  I sighed, leaned back and tossed the book over to Foster. \"Here, you read a while,\" I said. \"I'm arguing with myself and I can't tell who's winning.\"  Foster looked the book over carefully.  \"This is odd,\" he said.  \"What's odd?\"  \"The book is made of khaff. It is a permanent material--and yet it shows damage.\"  I sat perfectly still and waited.  \"Here on the back cover,\" Foster said. \"A scuffed area. Since this is khaff, it cannot be an actual scar. It must have been placed there.\"  I grabbed the book and looked. There was a faint mark across the back cover, as though the book had been scraped on something sharp. I remembered how much luck I had had with a knife. The mark had been put here, disguised as a casual nick in the finish. It had to mean something.  \"How do you know what the material is?\" I asked.  Foster looked surprised. \"In the same way that I know the window is of glass,\" he said. \"I simply know.\"  \"Speaking of glass,\" I said. \"Wait till I get my hands on a microscope. Then maybe we'll begin to get some answers.\"     CHAPTER IV   The two-hundred pound señorita with the wart on her upper lip put a pot of black Cuban coffee and a pitcher of salted milk down beside the two chipped cups, leered at me in a way that might have been appealing thirty years before, and waddled back to the kitchen. I poured a cup, gulped half of it, and shuddered. In the street outside the cafe a guitar cried _Estrellita_.  \"Okay, Foster,\" I said. \"Here's what I've got: The first half of the book is in pot-hooks--I can't read that. But this middle section: the part coded in regular letters--it's actually encrypted English. It's a sort of résumé of what happened.\" I picked up the sheets of paper on which I had transcribed my deciphering of the coded section of the book, using the key that had been micro-engraved in the fake scratch on the back cover.  I read:      _For the first time, I am afraid. My attempt to construct the     communicator called down the Hunters upon me. I made such a shield     as I could contrive, and sought their nesting place._      _I came there and it was in that place that I knew of old, and it     was no hive, but a pit in the ground, built by men of the Two     Worlds. And I would have come into it, but the Hunters swarmed in     their multitudes. I fought them and killed many, but at last I fled     away. I came to the western shore, and there I hired bold sailors     and a poor craft, and set forth._      _In forty-nine days we came to shore in this wilderness, and there     were men as from the dawn of time, and I fought them, and when they     had learned fear, I lived among them in peace, and the Hunters have     not found this place. Now it may be that "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51712"],["title","A Trace of Memory (#7)"],["body","saga ends here, but I     will do what I am able._      _The Change may soon come upon me; I must prepare for the stranger     who will come after me. All that he must know is in these pages.     And say I to him:_      _Have patience, for the time of this race draws close. Venture not     again on the Eastern continent, but wait, for soon the Northern     sailors must come in numbers into this wilderness. Seek out their     cleverest metal-workers, and when it may be, devise a shield, and     only then return to the pit of the Hunters. It lies in the plain,     50/10,000 parts of the girth of this(?) to the west of the Great     Chalk Face, and 1470 parts north from the median line, as I reckon.     The stones mark it well with the sign of the Two Worlds._  I looked across at Foster. \"It goes on then with a blow-by-blow account of dealings with aborigines. He was trying to get them civilized in a hurry. They figured he was a god and he set them to work building roads and cutting stone and learning mathematics and so on. He was doing all he could to set things up so this stranger who was to follow him would know the score, and carry on the good work.\"  Foster's eyes were on my face. \"What is the nature of the Change he speaks of?\"  \"He never says--but I suppose he's talking about death,\" I said. \"I don't know where the stranger is supposed to come from.\"  \"Listen to me, Legion,\" Foster said. There was a hint of the old anxious look in his eyes. \"I think I know what the Change was. I think he knew he would forget----\"  \"You've got amnesia on the brain, old buddy,\" I said.  \"----and the stranger is--himself. A man without a memory.\"  I sat frowning at Foster. \"Yeah, maybe,\" I said. \"Go on.\"  \"And he says that all that the stranger needs to know is there--in the book.\"  \"Not in the part I decoded,\" I said. \"He describes how they're coming along with the road-building job, and how the new mine panned out--but there's nothing about what the Hunters are, or what had gone on before he tangled with them the first time.\"  \"It must be there, Legion; but in the first section, the part written in alien symbols.\"  \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But why the hell didn't he give us a key to that part?\"  \"I think he assumed that the stranger--himself--would remember the old writing,\" Foster said. \"How could he know that it would be forgotten with the rest?\"  \"Your guess is as good as any,\" I said. \"Maybe better; you know how it feels to lose your memory.\"  \"But we've learned a few things,\" Foster said. \"The pit of the Hunters--we have the location.\"  \"If you call this 'ten thousand parts to the west of chalk face' a location,\" I said.  \"We know more than that,\" Foster said. \"He mentions a plain; and it must lie on a continent to the east----\"  \"If you assume that he sailed from Europe to America, then the continent to the east would be Europe,\" I said. \"But maybe he went from Africa to South America, or----\"  \"The mention of Northern sailors--that suggests the Vikings----\"  \"You seem to know a little history, Foster,\" I said. \"You've got a lot of odd facts tucked away.\"  \"We need maps,\" Foster said. \"We'll look for a plain near the sea----\"  \"Not necessarily.\"  \"----and with a formation called a chalk face to the east.\"  \"What's this 'median line' business?\" I said. \"And the bit about ten thousand parts of something?\"  \"I don't know. But we must have maps.\"  \"I bought some this afternoon,\" I said. \"I also got a dime-store globe. I figured we might need them. Let's get out of this and back to the room, where we can spread out. I know it's a grim prospect, but....\" I got to my feet, dropped some coins on the oilcloth-covered table, and led the way out.  It was a short half block to the flea trap we called home. We kept out of it as much as we could, holding our long daily conferences across the street at the Novedades. The roaches scurried as we passed up the dark stairway to our not much brighter room. I crossed to the bureau and opened a drawer.  \"The globe,\" Foster said, taking it in his hands. \"I wonder if perhaps he meant a ten-thousandth part of the circumference of the earth?\"  \"What would he know about----\"  \"Disregard the anachronistic aspect of it,\" Foster said. \"The man who wrote the book knew many things. We'll have to start with some assumptions. Let's make the obvious ones: that we're looking for a plain on the west coast of Europe, lying----\" He pulled a chair up to the scabrous table and riffled through to one of my scribbled sheets: \"50/10,000s of the circumference of the earth--that would be about 125 miles--west of a chalk formation, and 3675 miles north of a median line....\"  \"Maybe,\" I said, \"he means the Equator.\"  \"Certainly. Why not? That would mean our plain lies on a line through----\" he studied the small globe \"----Warsaw, and south of Amsterdam.\"  \"But this part about a rock outcropping,\" I said. \"How do we find out if there's any conspicuous chalk formation around there?\"  \"We can consult a geology text. There may be a library in this neighborhood.\"  \"The only chalk deposits I ever heard about,\" I said, \"are the White cliffs of Dover.\"  \"White cliffs....\"  We both reached for the globe at once.  \"One hundred twenty-five miles west of the chalk cliffs,\" said Foster. He ran a finger over the globe. \"North of London, but south of Birmingham. That puts us reasonably near the sea----\"  \"Where's the atlas?\" I said. I rummaged, came up with a cheap tourists' edition, flipped the pages.  \"Here's England,\" I said. \"Now we look for a plain.\"  Foster put a finger on the map. \"Here,\" he said. \"A large plain--called Salisbury.\"  \"Large is right,\" I said. \"It would take years to find a stone cairn on that. We're getting excited about nothing. We're looking for a hole in the ground, hundreds of years old--if this lousy notebook means anything--maybe marked with a few stones--in the middle of miles of plain. And it's all guesswork anyway....\" I took the atlas, turned the page.  \"I don't know what I expected to get out of decoding those pages,\" I said. \"But I was hoping for more than this.\"  \"I think we should try, Legion,\" Foster said. \"We can go there, search over the ground. It would be costly, but not impossible. We can start by gathering capital----\"  \"Wait a minute, Foster,\" I said. I was staring at a larger-scale map showing southern England. Suddenly my heart was thudding. I put a finger on a tiny dot in the center of Salisbury Plain.  \"Six, two and even,\" I said. \"There's your Pit of the Hunters....\"  Foster leaned over, read the fine print.  \"Stonehenge.\"         *       *       *       *       *  I read from the encyclopedia page:  --_this great stone structure, lying on the Plain of Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, is pre-eminent among megalithic monuments of the ancient world. Within a circular ditch 300' in diameter, stones up to 22' in height are arranged in concentric circles. The central altar stone, over 16' long, is approached from the northeast by a broad roadway called the Avenue_--  \"It is not an altar,\" said Foster.  \"How do you know?\"  \"Because----\" Foster frowned. \"I know, that's all.\"  \"The journal said the stones were arranged in the sign of the Two Worlds,\" I said. \"That means the concentric circles, I suppose; the same thing that's stamped on the cover of the notebook.\"  \"And the ring,\" Foster said.  \"Let me read the rest: _A great sarsen stone stands upright in the Avenue; the axis through the two stones, when erected, pointed directly to the rising of the sun on Midsummer Day. Calculations based on this observation indicate a date of approximately 1600 B.C._\"  Foster took the book and I sat on the window sill and looked out at a big Florida moon over the ragged line of roofs with a skinny royal palm sticking up in silhouette. It didn't look much like the postcard views of Miami. I lit a cigarette and thought about a man who long ago had crossed the North Atlantic in a dragon boat to be a god among the Indians. I wondered where he came from, and what it was he was looking for, and what kept him going in spite of the hell that showed in the spare lines of the journal he kept. If, I reminded myself, he had ever existed....  Foster was poring over the book. \"Look,\" I said. \"Let's get back to earth. We have things to think about, plans to make. The fairy tales can wait until later.\"  \"What do you suggest?\" Foster said. \"That we forget the things you've told me, and the things we've read here, discard the journal, and abandon the attempt to find the answers?\"  \"No,\" I said. \"I'm no sorehead. Sure, there's some things here that somebody ought to look into--some day. But right now what I want is the cops off my neck. And I've been thinking. I'll dictate a letter; you write it--your lawyers know your handwriting. Tell them you were on the thin edge of a nervous breakdown--that's why all the artillery around your house--and you made up your mind suddenly to get away from it all. Tell them you don't want to be bothered, that's why you're travelling incognito, and that the northern mobster that came to see you was just stupid, not a killer. That ought to at least cool off the cops----\"  Foster looked thoughtful. \"That's an excellent suggestion,\" he said. \"Then we need merely to arrange for passage to England, and proceed with the investigation.\"  \"You don't get the idea,\" I said. \"You can arrange things by mail so we get our hands on that dough of yours----\"  \"Any such attempt would merely bring the police down on us,\" Foster said. \"You've already pointed out the unwisdom of attempting to pass myself off as--myself.\"  \"There ought to be a way....\" I said.  \"We have only one avenue of inquiry,\" Foster said. \"We have no choice but to explore it. We'll take passage on a ship to England----\"  \"What'll we use for money--and papers? It would cost hundreds. Unless----\" I added, \"----we worked our way. But that's no good. We'd still need passports--plus union cards and seamen's tickets.\"  \"Your friend,\" Foster said. "]]]
