I  Roget Germyn, banker, of Wheeling, West Virginia, a Citizen, woke gently from a Citizen's dreamless sleep. It was the third-hour-rising time, the time proper to a day of exceptional opportunity to appreciate.  Citizen Germyn dressed himself in the clothes proper for the appreciation of great works--such as viewing the Empire State ruins against storm clouds from a small boat, or walking in silent single file across the remaining course of the Golden Gate Bridge. Or as today--one hoped--witnessing the Re-creation of the Sun.  Germyn with difficulty retained a Citizen's necessary calm. One was tempted to meditate on improper things: Would the Sun be re-created? What if it were not?  He put his mind to his dress. First of all, he put on an old and storied bracelet, a veritable identity bracelet of heavy silver links and a plate which was inscribed:                             PFC JOE HARTMANN                                 _Korea_                                  1953  His fellow jewelry-appreciators would have envied him that bracelet--if they had been capable of such an emotion as envy. No other ID bracelet as much as two hundred and fifty years old was known to exist in Wheeling.  His finest shirt and pair of light pants went next to his skin, and over them he wore a loose parka whose seams had been carefully weakened. When the Sun was re-created, every five years or so, it was the custom to remove the parka gravely and rend it with the prescribed graceful gestures ... but not so drastically that it could not be stitched together again. Hence the weakened seams.  This was, he counted, the forty-first day on which he and all of Wheeling had donned the appropriate Sun Re-creation clothing. It was the forty-first day on which the Sun--no longer white, no longer blazing yellow, no longer even bright red--had risen and displayed a color that was darker maroon and always darker.         *       *       *       *       *  It had, thought Citizen Germyn, never grown so dark and so cold in all of his life. Perhaps it was an occasion for special viewing. For surely it would never come again, this opportunity to see the old Sun so near to death....  One hoped.  Gravely, Citizen Germyn completed his dressing, thinking only of the act of dressing itself. It was by no means his specialty, but he considered, when it was done, that he had done it well, in the traditional flowing gestures, with no flailing, at all times balanced lightly on the ball of the foot. It was all the more perfectly consummated because no one saw it but himself.  He woke his wife gently, by placing the palm of his hand on her forehead as she lay neatly, in the prescribed fashion, on the Woman's Third of the bed.  The warmth of his hand gradually penetrated the layers of sleep. Her eyes demurely opened.  \"Citizeness Germyn,\" he greeted her, making the assurance-of-identity sign with his left hand.  \"Citizen Germyn,\" she said, with the assurance-of-identity inclination of the head which was prescribed when the hands are covered.  He retired to his tiny study.  It was the time appropriate to meditation on the properties of Connectivity. Citizen Germyn was skilled in meditation, even for a banker; it was a grace in which he had schooled himself since earliest childhood.  Citizen Germyn, his young face composed, his slim body erect as he sat but in no way tense or straining, successfully blanked out, one after another, all of the external sounds and sights and feelings that interfered with proper meditation. His mind was very nearly vacant except of one central problem: Connectivity.  Over his head and behind, out of sight, the cold air of the room seemed to thicken and form a--call it a blob; a blob of air.  There was a name for those blobs of air. They had been seen before. They were a known fact of existence in Wheeling and in all the world. They came. They hovered. And they went away--sometimes not alone. If someone had been in the room with Citizen Germyn to look at it, he would have seen a distortion, a twisting of what was behind the blob, like flawed glass, a lens, like an eye. And they were called Eye.  Germyn meditated.  The blob of air grew and slowly moved. A vagrant current that spun out from it caught a fragment of paper and whirled it to the floor. Germyn stirred. The blob retreated.  Germyn, all unaware, disciplined his thoughts to disregard the interruption, to return to the central problem of Connectivity. The blob hovered....  From the other room, his wife's small, thrice-repeated throat-clearing signaled to him that she was dressed. Germyn got up to go to her, his mind returning to the world; and the overhead Eye spun relentlessly, and disappeared.         *       *       *       *       *  Some miles east of Wheeling, Glenn Tropile--of a class which found it wisest to give itself no special name, and which had devoted much time and thought to shaking the unwelcome name it had been given--awoke on the couch of his apartment.  He sat up, shivering. It was cold. The damned Sun was still bloody dark outside the window and the apartment was soggy and chilled.  He had kicked off the blankets in his sleep. _Why couldn't_ he learn to sleep quietly, like anybody else? Lacking a robe, he clutched the blankets around him, got up and walked to the unglassed window.  It was not unusual for Glenn Tropile to wake up on his couch. This happened because Gala Tropile had a temper, was inclined to exile him from her bed after a quarrel, and--the operative factor--he knew he always had the advantage over her for the whole day following the night's exile. Therefore the quarrel was worth it. An advantage was, by definition, worth anything you paid for it or else it was no advantage.  He could hear her moving about in one of the other rooms and cocked an ear, satisfied. She hadn't waked him. Therefore she was about to make amends. A little itch in his spine or his brain--it was not a physical itch, so he couldn't locate it; he could only be sure that it was there--stopped troubling him momentarily; he was winning a contest. It was Glenn Tropile's nature to win contests ... and his nature to create them.  Gala Tropile, young, dark, attractive, with a haunted look, came in tentatively carrying coffee from some secret hoard of hers.  Glenn Tropile affected not to notice. He stared coldly out at the cold landscape. The sea, white with thin ice, was nearly out of sight, so far had it retreated as the little sun waned.  \"Glenn--\"  Ah, good! _Glenn._ Where was the proper mode of first-greeting-one's-husband? Where was the prescribed throat-clearing upon entering a room?  Assiduously, he had untaught her the meticulous ritual of manners that they had all of them been brought up to know; and it was the greatest of his many victories over her that sometimes, now, _she_ was the aggressor, _she_ would be the first to depart from the formal behavior prescribed for Citizens.  Depravity! Perversion!  Sometimes they would touch each other at times which were not the appropriate coming-together times, Gala sitting on her husband's lap in the late evening, perhaps, or Tropile kissing her awake in the morning. Sometimes he would force her to let him watch her dress--no, not now, for the cold of the waning sun made that sort of frolic unattractive, but she had permitted it before; and such was his mastery over her that he knew she would permit it again, when the Sun was re-created....  If, a thought came to him, _if_ the Sun was re-created.         *       *       *       *       *  He turned away from the cold outside and looked at his wife. \"Good morning, darling.\" She was contrite.  He demanded jarringly: \"Is it?\" Deliberately he stretched, deliberately he yawned, deliberately he scratched his chest. Every movement was ugly. Gala Tropile quivered, but said nothing.  Tropile flung himself on the better of the two chairs, one hairy leg protruding from under the wrapped blankets. His wife was on her best behavior--in his unique terms; she didn't avert her eyes.  \"What've you got there?\" he asked. \"Coffee?\"  \"Yes, dear. I thought--\"  \"Where'd you get it?\"  The haunted eyes looked away. Still better, thought Glenn Tropile, more satisfied even than usual; she's been ransacking an old warehouse again. It was a trick he had taught her, and like all of the illicit tricks she had learned from him, a handy weapon when he chose to use it.  It was not prescribed that a Citizen should rummage through Old Places. A Citizen did his work, whatever that work might be--banker, baker or furniture repairman. He received what rewards were his due for the work he did. A Citizen _never_ took anything that was not his due--not even if it lay abandoned and rotting.  It was one of the differences between Glenn Tropile and the people he moved among.  I've got it made, he exulted; it was what I needed to clinch my victory over her.  He spoke: \"I need you more than I need coffee, Gala.\"  She looked up, troubled.  \"What would I do,\" he demanded, \"if a beam fell on you one day while you were scrambling through the fancy groceries? How can you take such chances? Don't you _know_ what you mean to me?\"  She sniffed a couple of times. She said brokenly: \"Darling, about last night--I'm sorry--\" and miserably held out the cup. He took it and set it down. He took her hand, looked up at her, and kissed it lingeringly. He felt her tremble. Then she gave him a wild, adoring look"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51845"],["title","Wolfbane (#1)"],["body"," flung herself into his arms.  A new dominance cycle was begun at the moment he returned her frantic kisses.  Glenn knew, and Gala knew, that he had over her an edge, an advantage--the weather gauge, initiative of fire, percentage, the can't-lose lack of tension. Call it anything, but it was life itself to such as Glenn Tropile. He knew, and she knew, that having the advantage he would press it and she would yield--on and on, in a rising spiral.  He did it because it was his life, the attaining of an advantage over anyone he might encounter; because he was (unwelcomely but justly) called a Son of the Wolf.         *       *       *       *       *  A world away, a Pyramid squatted sullenly on the planed-off top of the highest peak of the Himalayas.  It had not been built there. It had not been carried there by Man or Man's machines. It had--come, in its own time; for its own reasons.  Did it wake on that day, the thing atop Mount Everest, or did it ever sleep? Nobody knew. It stood, or sat, there, approximately a tetrahedron. Its appearance was known: constructed on a base line of some thirty-five yards, slaggy, midnight-blue in color. Almost nothing else about it was known--at least, to mankind.  It was the only one of its kind on Earth, though men thought (without much sure knowledge) that there were more, perhaps many thousands more, like it on the unfamiliar planet that was Earth's binary, swinging around the miniature Sun that hung at their common center of gravity like an unbalanced dumbbell. But men knew very little about that planet itself, only that it had come out of space and was now there.  Time was when men had tried to label that binary, more than two centuries before, when it had first appeared. \"Runaway Planet.\" \"The Invader.\" \"Rejoice in Messias, the Day Is at Hand.\" The labels were sense-free; they were Xs in an equation, signifying only that there was _something_ there which was unknown.  \"The Runaway Planet\" stopped running when it closed on Earth.  \"The Invader\" didn't invade; it merely sent down one slaggy, midnight-blue tetrahedron to Everest.  And \"Rejoice in Messias\" stole Earth from its sun--with Earth's old moon, which it converted into a miniature sun of its own.  That was the time when men were plentiful and strong--or thought they were--with many huge cities and countless powerful machines. It didn't matter. The new binary planet showed no interest in the cities or the machines.  There was a plague of things like Eyes--dust-devils without dust, motionless air that suddenly tensed and quivered into lenticular shapes. They came with the planet and the Pyramid, so that there probably was some connection. But there was nothing to do about the Eyes. Striking at them was like striking at air--was the same thing, in fact.  While the men and machines tried uselessly to do something about it, the new binary system--the stranger planet and Earth--began to move, accelerating very slowly.  But accelerating.  In a week, astronomers knew something was happening. In a month, the Moon sprang into flame and became a new sun--beginning to be needed, for already the parent Sol was visibly more distant, and in a few years it was only one other star among many.         *       *       *       *       *  When the little sun was burned to a clinker, they--whoever \"they\" were, for men saw only the one Pyramid--would hang a new one in the sky. It happened every five clock-years, more or less. It was the same old moon-turned-sun, but it burned out, and the fires needed to be rekindled.  The first of these suns had looked down on an Earthly population of ten billion. As the sequence of suns waxed and waned, there were changes, climatic fluctuation, all but immeasurable differences in the quantity and kind of radiation from the new source.  The changes were such that the forty-fifth such sun looked down on a shrinking human race that could not muster up a hundred million.  A frustrated man drives inward; it is the same with a race. The hundred million that clung to existence were not the same as the bold, vital ten billion.  The thing on Everest had, in its time, received many labels, too: The Devil, The Friend, The Beast, A Pseudo-living Entity of Quite Unknown Electrochemical Properties.  All these labels were also Xs.  If it did wake that morning, it did not open its eyes, for it had no eyes--apart from the quivers of air that might or might not belong to it. Eyes might have been gouged; therefore it had none. So an illogical person might have argued--and yet it was tempting to apply the \"purpose, not function\" fallacy to it. Limbs could be crushed; it had no limbs. Ears could be deafened; it had none. Through a mouth, it might be poisoned; it had no mouth. Intentions and actions could be frustrated; apparently it had neither.  It was there. That was all.  It and others like it had stolen the Earth and the Earth did not know why. It was there. And the one thing on Earth you could not do was hurt it, influence it, or coerce it in any way whatever.  It was there--and it, or the masters it represented, owned the Earth by right of theft. Utterly. Beyond human hope of challenge or redress.   II  Citizen and Citizeness Roget Germyn walked down Pine Street in the chill and dusk of--one hoped--a Sun Re-creation Morning.  It was the convention to pretend that this was a morning like any other morning. It was not proper either to cast frequent hopeful glances at the sky, nor yet to seem disturbed or afraid because this was, after all, the forty-first such morning since those whose specialty was Sky Viewing had come to believe the Re-creation of the Sun was near.  The Citizen and his Citizeness exchanged the assurance-of-identity sign with a few old friends and stopped to converse. This also was a convention of skill divorced from purpose. The conversation was without relevance to anything that any one of the participants might know, or think, or wish to ask.  Germyn said for his friends a twenty-word poem he had made in honor of the occasion and heard their responses. They did line-capping for a while--until somebody indicated unhappiness and a wish to change by frowning the Two Grooves between his brows. The game was deftly ended with an improvised rhymed exchange.  Casually, Citizen Germyn glanced aloft. The sky-change had not begun yet; the dying old Sun hung just over the horizon, east and south, much more south than east. It was an ugly thought, but suppose, thought Germyn, just _suppose_ that the Sun were not re-created today? Or tomorrow. Or--  Or ever.  The Citizen got a grip on himself and told his wife: \"We shall dine at the oatmeal stall.\"  The Citizeness did not immediately reply. When Germyn glanced at her with well-masked surprise, he found her almost staring down the dim street at a Citizen who moved almost in a stride, almost swinging his arms. Scarcely graceful.  \"That might be more Wolf than man,\" she said doubtfully.  Germyn knew the fellow. Tropile was his name. One of those curious few who made their homes outside of Wheeling, though they were not farmers. Germyn had had banking dealings with him--or would have had, if it had been up to Tropile.  \"That is a careless man,\" he decided, \"and an ill-bred one.\"  They moved toward the oatmeal stall with the gait of Citizens, arms limp, feet scarcely lifted, slumped forward a little. It was the ancient gait of fifteen hundred calories per day, not one of which could be squandered.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a need for more calories. So many for walking, so many for gathering food. So many for the economical pleasures of the Citizens, so many more--oh, many more, these days!--to keep out the cold. Yet there were no more calories; the diet the whole world lived on was a bare subsistence diet.  It was impossible to farm well when half the world's land was part of the time drowned in the rising sea, part of the time smothered in falling snow.  Citizens knew this and, knowing, did not struggle--it was ungraceful to struggle, particularly when one could not win. Only--well, Wolves struggled, wasting calories, lacking grace.  Citizen Germyn turned his mind to more pleasant things.  He allowed himself his First Foretaste of the oatmeal. It would be warm in the bowl, hot in the throat, a comfort in the belly. There was a great deal of pleasure there, in weather like this, when the cold plucked through the loosened seams and the wind came up the sides of the hills. Not that there wasn't pleasure in the cold itself, for that matter. It was proper that one should be cold now, just before the re-creation of the Sun, when the old Sun was smoky-red and the new one not yet kindled.  \"--still looks like Wolf to me,\" his wife was muttering.  \"Cadence,\" Germyn reproved his Citizeness, but took the sting out of it with a Quirked Smile.  The man with the ugly manners was standing at the very bar of the oatmeal stall where they were heading. In the gloom of mid-morning, he was all angles and strained lines. His head was turned awkwardly on his shoulder, peering toward the back of the stall where the vendor was rhythmically measuring grain into a pot. His hands were resting helter-skelter on the counter, not hanging by his sides.  Citizen Germyn felt a faint shudder from his wife. But he did not reprove her again, for who could blame her? The exhibition was revolting.  She said faintly: \"Citizen, might we dine on bread this morning?\"  He hesitated and glanced again at the ugly man. He said indulgently, knowing that he was indulgent: \"On Sun Re-creation Morning, the Citizeness may dine on bread.\" Bearing in mind the occasion, it was only a small favor and therefore a very proper one.  The bread was good, very good. They shared out the half-kilo between them and ate it in silence, as it deserved. Germyn finished his first portion and, in the prescribed pause before beginning his second, elected to refresh his eyes upward.  He nodded to his wife and "]]]
