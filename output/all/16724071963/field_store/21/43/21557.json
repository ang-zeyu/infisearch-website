But if you could accept the concept of pre-arranged visions, why not pre-arranged Thefts?  Eric shook his head. He was getting into very dark corridors mentally: his world was turning into sheer confusion.  But one thing he knew. Making an arrangement with a Stranger, as his uncle had done, was definitely an act contrary to all the laws and practices of Mankind. Thomas's uncertain speech had underlined that fact. It was--well, it was _wrong_.  Yet his uncle was the greatest man in all Mankind, so far as Eric was concerned. Thomas the Trap-Smasher could do no wrong. But Thomas the Trap-Smasher was evidently leaning toward Alien-science. Alien-science was wrong. But again, on the other hand, his parents, according to the Trap-Smasher, his father and his mother had been Alien-sciencers.  Too much. There was just too much to work out. There was too much he didn't know. He'd better concentrate on his Theft.  The strange burrow had come to an end. The hairs rose on the back of his neck as he walked into the great dark area and sensed enormous black heights above him. He began to hurry, turning every once in a while to make certain that he was staying in a straight line with the light from the entrance. Here, his forehead glow lamp was almost no use at all. He didn't like this place. It felt almost like being out in the open.  What, he wondered again feverishly, was this structure in the world of the Monsters? What function did it have? He was not sure he wanted to know.  Eric was running by the time he came to the end of the open space. He hit the wall so hard that he was knocked over backwards.  For a moment, he was badly frightened, then he realized what had happened. He hadn't taken his bearings for a while: he must have moved off at an angle.  Groping along the wall with extended arms, he found the entrance to the low burrow at last. It was quite low--he had to bend his knees and duck his head as he went up to. It was an unpleasantly narrow little corridor. But then there was an opening on his right--the fork his uncle had told him about--and he turned into it with relief.  He had arrived.  There was a burst of light from a group of glow lamps. And there were Strangers, there were _several_ Strangers here. Three of them--no, four--no, five! They squatted in a corner of this large, square burrow, three of them talking earnestly, the other two engaged in some incomprehensible task with materials that were mostly unfamiliar.         *       *       *       *       *  All of them leaped to their feet as he trotted in and deployed instantly in a wide semi-circle facing him. Eric wished desperately he had been holding two heavy spears instead of the single light one. With two heavy spears you had both a shield and a dangerous offensive weapon. A light spear was good for a single cast, and that was that.  He held it nevertheless in the throwing position above his shoulder and glared fiercely, as a warrior of Mankind should. If he had to throw, he decided, he would spring to one side immediately afterward and try to pluck the two heavy spears from his back-sling. But if they rushed him right now--  \"Who are you?\" asked a strong-faced, middle-aged man in the center of the semi-circle, his spear throbbing in an upraised arm. \"What's your name--what's your people?\"  \"Eric the Only,\" Eric told him quickly. Then he remembered to add: \"I'm destined to be Eric the Eye. My people are Mankind.\"  \"He's expected, one of us,\" the middle-aged man told the others who immediately relaxed, slung their spears and went back to what they had been doing. \"Welcome, Eric the Only of Mankind. Put up your spear and sit with us. I am Arthur the Organizer.\"  Eric gingerly dropped his spear into the back-sling. He studied the Stranger.  A man about as old as his uncle and not nearly as hefty, although well-muscled enough for normal warlike purposes. He wore the loin-straps of a full warrior, but--as if these were not enough honor for a man--he also wore straps laced about his chest and across his shoulders, though he was carrying no knapsack. This was the fashion of many Strangers, Eric knew, as was the strap at the back of the head that held the hair in a tight tail away from the eyes instead of letting it hang wild and free as the hair of a warrior should. And the straps were decorated with odd, incised designs--another weak and unmanlike Stranger fashion.  Who but Strangers, Eric thought contemptuously, would group up in so an alien place without setting sentries at either end of their burrow? Truly Mankind had good reason to despise them!  But this man was a leader, he realized, a born leader, with an even more self-assured air than Thomas the Trap-Smasher, captain of the best band in all Mankind. He was studying Eric in turn, with eyes that weighed carefully and then, having decided on the measure, made a definite placement, fitting Eric permanently into this plan or that plan. He looked like a man whose head was full of many plans, each one evolving inexorably through action to a predetermined end.  He took Eric's arm companionably and led him to where the others squatted and talked and worked. This was no tribal burrow of any sort: it was quite apparently a field headquarters--and Arthur the Organizer was Commander-in-Chief. \"I met your uncle,\" he told Eric, \"about a dozen auld lang synes ago, when he came to us on a trading expedition--back in our burrows, I mean. A fine man, your uncle, very progressive. He's attended our secret meetings regularly, and there's going to be an important place for him in the great burrows we will dig, in the new world we are making. He reminds me a lot of your father. But so do you, my boy, so do you.\"  \"Did you know my father?\"         *       *       *       *       *  Arthur the Organizer smiled and nodded. \"Very well. He could have been a great man. He gave his life for the Cause. Who among us will ever forget Eric the--the--Eric the Store-keeper or something, wasn't it?\"  \"The Storeroom-Stormer. His name was Eric the Storeroom-Stormer.\"  \"Yes, of course. Eric the Storeroom-Stormer. An unforgettable name with us, and an unforgettable man. But that's another story; we'll talk about it some other time. You'll have to be getting back to your uncle very soon.\" He picked up a flat board covered with odd markings and studied it with his glow lamp.  \"How do you like that?\" one of the men working with the unfamiliar materials muttered to his neighbor. \"You ask him his people, and he says, 'Mankind.' _Mankind!_\"  The other man chuckled. \"A front-burrow tribe. What the hell do you expect--sophistication? Each and every front-burrow tribe calls itself Mankind. As far as these primitives are concerned, the human race stops at their outermost burrow. Your tribe, my tribe--you know what they call us? Strangers. In their eyes, there's not too much difference between us and the Monsters.\"  \"That's what I mean. They don't see us as fellow-men. They are narrow-minded savages. Who needs them?\"  Arthur the Organizer glanced at Eric's face. He turned sharply to the man who had spoken last.  \"I'll tell you who needs them, Walter,\" he said. \"The Cause needs them. If the front-burrow tribes are with us, it means our main lines of supply to Monster territory are kept open. But we need every fighter we can get, no matter how primitive. Every single tribe has to be with us if Alien-science is to be the dominant religion of the burrows, if we're to avoid the fiasco of the last rising. We need front-burrow men for their hunting, foraging skills and back-burrow men for their civilized skills. We need everybody in this thing, especially now.\"  The man called Walter put down his work and scowled at Eric dubiously. He seemed to be totally unconvinced.  \"These arrogant back-burrowers with their ornamented straps and unmilitary manners! Men from different tribes sitting around and talking, when--if they had any sense of propriety at all--they should be killing each other!\"  Suddenly, the floor shook under him. He almost fell. He staggered back and forth, trying to grab at the spears in his back-sling. He finally got used to it, managed to find a solid footing in the upheaval. The spear he held vibrated in his hand.         *       *       *       *       *  From far away came a series of ear-splitting thumps. The floor swung to their rhythm. \"What is it?\" he cried, turning to Arthur. \"What's going on?\"  \"You've never heard a Monster walking before?\" the Organizer asked him unbelievingly. \"That's right--this is your Theft, your first time out. It's a Monster, boy. A Monster's moving around in the Monster larder, doing whatever Monsters do. They have a right, you know,\" he added with a smile. \"It's their larder. We're just--visitors.\"  Eric noticed that none of the others seemed particularly concerned. He drew a deep breath and reslung his spear. How the floor and the walls shook! What a fantastic, enormous creature that must be!  As an apprentice warrior, he had often stood with the rear-guard on the other side of the doorway to Monster territory while the band went in to steal for Mankind. A few times there had been heavy, thumping noises off in the distance, and the walls of the burrow had quivered slightly. But not like this. It had never been remotely as awesome as this.  He raised his eyes to the straight, flat ceiling of the burrow above them. He remembered the dark space further back stretching up limitlessly. \"And this,\" he said aloud. \"This structure we're in. What is _this_ to them?\"  Arthur the Organizer shrugged. \"A piece of Monster furniture. Something they use for something or other. We're in one of the open spaces they always leave in the bases of their furniture. Makes the furniture lighter, easier to move around, I guess.\" He listened for a moment as the thumps drifted further away and then died out. \"Let's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51125"],["title","Mars is My Destination (#0)"],["body","IS MY                               DESTINATION                      a science-fiction adventure by                           FRANK BELKNAP LONG                               PYRAMID BOOKS                                NEW YORK                          MARS IS MY DESTINATION                              A Pyramid Book                         First printing, June 1962         This book is fiction.

Men killed for the coveted ticket that allowed them to go there. And, once there, the killing went on....   MARS  ... Ralph Graham's goal since boyhood--and he was Mars-bound with authority that put the whole planet in his pocket--if he could live long enough to assert it!   MARS  ... source of incalculable wealth for humanity--and deadly danger for those who tried to get it!   MARS  ... in Earth's night sky, a symbol of the god of war--in this tense novel of the future, a vivid setting for stirring action!     1   I'd known for ten minutes that something terrible was going to happen. It was in the cards, building to a zero-count climax.  The spaceport bar was filled with a fresh, washed-clean smell, as if all the winds of space had been blowing through it. There was an autumn tang in the air as well, because it was open at both ends, and out beyond was New Chicago, with its parks and tall buildings, and the big inland sea that was Lake Michigan.  It was all right ... if you just let your mind dwell on what was outside. Men and women with their shoulders held straight and a new lift to the way they felt and thought, because Earth wasn't a closed-circuit any more. Kids in the parks pretending they were spacemen, bundled up in insulated jackets, having the time of their lives. A blue jay perched on a tree, the leaves turning red and yellow around it. A nurse in a starched white uniform pushing a perambulator, her red-gold hair whipped by the wind, a dreamy look in her eyes.  Nothing could spoil any part of that. It was there to stay and I breathed in deeply a couple of times, refusing to remember that in the turbulent, round-the-clock world of the spaceports, Death was an inveterate barhopper.  Then I did remember, because I had to. You can't bury your head in the sand to shut out ugliness for long, unless you're ostrich-minded and are willing to let your integrity go down the drain.  I didn't know what time it was and I didn't much care. I only knew that Death had come in late in the afternoon, and was hovering in stony silence at the far end of the bar.  He was there, all right, even if he had the same refractive index as the air around him and you could see right through him. The sixth-sense kind of awareness that everyone experiences at times--call it a premonition, if you wish--had started an alarm bell ringing in my mind.  It was still ringing when I raised my eyes, and knew for sure that all the furies that ever were had picked that particular time and place to hold open house.  I saw it begin to happen.  It began so suddenly it had the impact of a big, hard-knuckled fist crashing down on the spaceport bar, startling everyone, jolting even the solitary drinkers out of their private nightmares.  Actually the violence hadn't quite reached that stage. But it was a safe bet that it would in another ten or twelve seconds. And when it did there was no chain or big double lock on Earth that could keep it from terminating in bloodshed.  The tipoff was the way it started, as if a fuse had been lit that would blow the place apart. Just two voices for an instant, raised in anger, one ringing out like a pistol shot. But I knew that something was dangerously wrong the instant I caught sight of the two men who were doing the arguing.  The one whose voice had made every glass on the long bar vibrate like a tuning fork was a blond giant, six-foot-four at least and built massive around the shoulders. His shirt was open at the throat and his chest was sweat-sheened and he had the kind of outsized ruggedness that made you feel it would have taken a heavy rock-crushing machine a full half hour to flatten him out.  The other was of average height and only looked small by contrast. He was more than holding his own, however, standing up to the Viking character defiantly. His weather-beaten face was as tight as a drum, and his hair was standing straight up, as though a charge of high-voltage electricity had passed right through him.  He just happened to have unusually bristly hair, I guess. But it gave him a very weird look indeed.  I don't know why someone picked that critical moment to shout a warning, because everyone could see it was the kind of argument that couldn't be stopped by anything short of strong-armed intervention. Advice at that point could be just as dangerous as pouring kerosene on the fuse, to make it burn faster.  But someone did yell out, at the top of his lungs. \"Pipe down, you two! What do you think this is, a debating society?\"  It could have turned into that, all right, the deadliest kind of debating society, with the stoned contingent taking sides for no sane reason. It could have started off as a free-for-all and ended with five or six of the heaviest drinkers lying prone, with bashed-in skulls.  The barkeep made a makeshift megaphone of his two hands and added to the confusion by shouting: \"Get back in line or I'll have you run right out of here. I'll show you just how tough I can get. Every time something like this happens I get blamed for it. I'm goddam sick of being in the middle.\"  \"That's telling them, John! Need any help?\"  \"No, stay where you are. I can handle it.\"  I didn't think he could, not even if he was split down the middle into two men twice his size. I didn't think anyone could, because by this time I'd had a chance to take a long, steady, camera-eye look at the expression on the Viking character's face.  I'd seen that expression before and I knew what it meant. The Viking character was having a virulent sour grapes reaction to something Average Size had said. It had really taken hold, like a smallpox vaccination that's much too strong, and his inner torment had become just agonizing enough to send him into a towering rage.  Average Size had probably been boasting, telling everyone how lucky he was to be on the passenger list of the next Mars-bound rocket. And in a crowded spaceport bar, where Martian Colonization Board clearances are at a terrific premium, you don't indulge in that kind of talk. Not unless you have a suicide complex and are dead set on leaving the earth without traveling out into space at all.  Now things were coming to a head so fast there was no time to cheat Death of his cue. He was starting to come right out into the open, scythe swinging, punctual to the dot. I was sure of it the instant I saw the gun gleaming in the Viking character's hand and the smaller man recoiling from him, his eyes fastened on the weapon in stark terror.  _Oh, you fool!_ I thought. _Why did you provoke him? You should have expected this, you should have known. What good is a Mars clearance if you end up with a bullet in your spine?_  For some strange reason the Viking character seemed in no hurry to blast. He seemed to be savoring the look of terror in Average Size's eyes, letting his fury diminish by just a little, as if by allowing a tenth of it to escape through a steam-spigot safety valve he could make more sure of his aim. It made me wonder if I couldn't still get to them in time.  The instant I realized there was still a chance I knew I'd have to try. I was in good physical trim and no man is an island when the sands are running out. I didn't want to die, but neither did Average Size and there are obligations you can't sidestep if you want to go on living with yourself.  I moved out from where I was standing and headed straight for the Viking character, keeping parallel with the long bar. I can't recall ever having moved more rapidly, and I was well past the barkeep--he was blinking and standing motionless, as white as a sheet now--when the Viking character's voice rang out for the second time.  \"You think you're better than the rest of us, don't you? Sure you do. Why deny it? Who are you, who is anybody, to come in here and strut and put on airs? I'm going to let you have it, right now!\"  The blast came then, sudden, deafening. They were standing so close to each other I thought for a minute the gun had misfired, for Average Size didn't stiffen or sag or change his position in any way and his face was hidden by smoke from the blast.  I should have known better, for it was a big gun with a heavy charge, and when a man is half blown apart his body can become galvanized for an instant, just as if he hasn't been hit at all. Sometimes he'll be lifted up and hurled back twenty feet and sometimes he'll just stand rigid, with the life going out of him in a rush, an instant before his knees give way and there's a terrible, welling redness to make you realize how mistaken you were about the shot going wild.  The smoke thinned out fast enough, eddying away from him in little spirals. But one quick look at him sinking down, passing into eternity with his head lolling, was all I had time for. Pandemonium was breaking loose all around me, and my only thought was to make a mad dog killer pay for what he had done before someone got between us.  Mad dog killers enrage me beyond all"]]]
