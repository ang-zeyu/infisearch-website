The recovery of the Trimalchionian episode, and the subsequent pamphleteering would by no means eradicate this “cacoethes emendandi.”  When, circa 1650, the library of the unfortunate Nicolas Cippico yielded up the Trau fragment, the news of this discovery spread far and wide and about twelve years later, Statileo, in response to the repeated requests of the Venetian ambassador, Pietro Basadonna, made with his own hand a copy of the MS., which he sent to Basadonna.  The ambassador, in turn, permitted this MS. to be printed by one Frambotti, a printer endowed with more industry than critical acumen, and the resultant textual conflation had much to do with the pamphlet war which followed.  Had this Paduan printer followed the explicit directions which he received, and printed exactly what was given him much good paper might have been saved and a very interesting chapter in the history of literary forgery would probably never have been written.  The pamphlet war did not die out until Bleau, in 1670-71, printed his exact reproduction of the Trau manuscript and the corrections introduced by that licentiousness of emendation of which we have spoken.  In October, 1690, Francois Nodot, a French soldier of fortune, a commissary officer who combined belles lettres and philosophy with his official duties, wrote to Charpentier, President of the Academy of France, calling, his attention to a copy of a manuscript which he (Nodot) possessed, and which came into his hands in the following manner: one Du Pin, a French officer detailed to service with Austria, had been present at the sack of Belgrade in 1688.  That this Du Pin had, while there, made the acquaintance of a certain Greek renegade, having, as a matter of fact, stayed in the house of this renegade.  The Greek’s father, a man of some learning, had by some means come into possession of the MS., and Du Pin, in going through some of the books in the house, had come across it.  He had experienced the utmost difficulty in deciphering the letters, and finally, driven by curiosity, had retained a copyist and had it copied out.  That this Du Pin had this copy in his house at Frankfort, and that he had given Nodot to understand that if he (Nodot) came to Frankfort, he would be permitted to see this copy.  Owing to the exigencies of military service, Nodot had been unable to go in person to Frankfort, and that he had therefore availed himself of the friendly interest and services of a certain merchant of Frankfort, who had volunteered to find an amanuensis, have a copy made, and send it to Nodot.  This was done, and Nodot concludes his letter to Charpentier by requesting the latter to lay the result before the Academy and ask for their blessing and approval.  These Nodotian Supplements were accepted as authentic by the Academics of Arles and Nimes, as well as by Charpentier. In a short time, however, the voices of scholarly skeptics began to be heard in the land, and accurate and unbiased criticism laid bare the fraud.  The Latinity was attacked and exception taken to Silver Age prose in which was found a French police regulation which required newly arrived travellers to register their names in the book of a police officer of an Italian village of the first century.  Although they are still retained in the text by some editors, this is done to give some measure of continuity to an otherwise interrupted narrative, but they can only serve to distort the author and obscure whatever view of him the reader might otherwise have reached.  They are generally printed between brackets or in different type.  In 1768 another and far abler forger saw the light of day.  Jose Marchena, a Spaniard of Jewish extraction, was destined for an ecclesiastical career.  He received an excellent education which served to fortify a natural bent toward languages and historical criticism.  In his early youth he showed a marked preference for uncanonical pursuits and heretical doctrines and before he had reached his thirtieth year prudence counseled him to prevent the consequences of his heresy and avoid the too pressing Inquisition by a timely flight into France. He arrived there in time to throw himself into the fight for liberty, and in 1800 we find him at Basle attached to the staff of General Moreau. While there he is said to have amused himself and some of his cronies by writing notes on what Davenport would have called “Forbidden Subjects,”  and, as a means of publishing his erotic lucubrations, he constructed this fragment, which brings in those topics on which he had enlarged. He translated the fragment into French, attached his notes, and issued the book.  There is another story to the effect that he had been reprimanded by Moreau for having written a loose song and that he exculpated himself by assuring the general that it was but a new fragment of Petronius which he had translated.  Two days later he had the fragment ready to prove his contention.  This is the account given by his Spanish biographer.  In his preface, dedicated to the Army of the Rhine, he states that he found the fragment in a manuscript of the work of St. Gennadius on the Duties of Priests, probably of the XI Century.  A close examination revealed the fact that it was a palimpsest which, after treatment, permitted the restoration of this fragment.  It is supposed to supply the gap in Chapter 26 after the word “verberabant.”  Its obscenity outrivals that of the preceding text, and the grammar, style, and curiosa felicitas Petroniana make it an almost perfect imitation.  There is no internal evidence of forgery.  If the text is closely scrutinized it will be seen that it is composed of words and expressions taken from various parts of the Satyricon, “and that in every line it has exactly the Petronian turn of phrase.”  “Not only is the original edition unprocurable,” to quote again from Mr. Gaselee’s invaluable bibliography, “but the reprint at Soleure (Brussels), 1865, consisted of only 120 copies, and is hard to find. The most accessible place for English readers is in Bohn’s translation, in which, however, only the Latin text is given; and the notes were a most important part of the original work.”  These notes, humorously and perhaps sarcastically ascribed to Lallemand, Sanctae Theologiae Doctor, “are six in number (all on various forms of vice); and show great knowledge, classical and sociological, of unsavory subjects.  Now that the book is too rare to do us any harm, we may admit that the pastiche was not only highly amusing, but showed a perverse cleverness amounting almost to genius.”  Marchena died at Madrid in great poverty in 1821.  A contemporary has described him as being rather short and heavy set in figure, of great frontal development, and vain beyond belief.  He considered himself invincible where women were concerned.  He had a peculiar predilection in the choice of animal pets and was an object of fear and curiosity to the towns people.  His forgery might have been completely successful had he not acknowledged it himself within two or three years after the publication of his brochure.  The fragment will remain a permanent tribute to the excellence of his scholarship, but it is his Ode to Christ Crucified which has made him more generally known, and it is one of the ironies of fate that caused this deformed giant of sarcasm to compose a poem of such tender and touching piety.  Very little is known about Don Joe Antonio Gonzalez de Salas, whose connecting passages, with the exception of one which is irrelevant, are here included.  The learned editors of the Spanish encyclopedia naively preface their brief sketch with the following assertion: “no tenemos noticias de su vida.”  De Salas was born in 1588 and died in 1654.  His edition of Petronius was first issued in 1629 and re-issued in 1643 with a copper plate of the Editor.  The Paris edition, from which he says he supplied certain deficiencies in the text, is unknown to bibliographers and is supposed to be fictitious.  To distinguish the spurious passages, as a point of interest, in the present edition, the forgeries of Nodot are printed within round brackets, the forgery of Marchena within square brackets, and the additions of De Salas in italics {In this PG etext in curly brackets}.  The work is also accompanied by a translation of the six notes, the composition of which led Marchena to forge the fragment which first appeared in the year 1800.  These have never before been translated.  Thanks are due Ralph Straus, Esq., and Professor Stephen Gaselee.

(It has been so long since I promised you the story of my adventures, that I have decided to make good my word today; and, seeing that we have thus fortunately met, not to discuss scientific matters alone, but also to enliven our jolly conversation with witty stories.  Fabricius Veiento has already spoken very cleverly on the errors committed in the name of religion, and shown how priests, animated by an hypocritical mania for prophecy, boldly expound mysteries which are too often such to themselves.  But) are our rhetoricians tormented by another species of Furies when they cry, “I received these wounds while fighting for the public liberty; I lost this eye in your defense: give me a guide who will lead me to my children, my limbs are hamstrung and will not hold me up!”  Even these heroics could be endured if they made easier the road to eloquence; but as it is, their sole gain from this ferment of matter and empty discord of words is, that when they step into the Forum, they think they"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5225"],["title","The Satyricon — Complete (#3)"],["body"," been carried into another world.  And it is my conviction that the schools are responsible for the gross foolishness of our young men, because, in them, they see or hear nothing at all of the affairs of every-day life, but only pirates standing in chains upon the shore, tyrants scribbling edicts in which sons are ordered to behead their own fathers; responses from oracles, delivered in time of pestilence, ordering the immolation of three or more virgins; every word a honied drop, every period sprinkled with poppy-seed and sesame.     CHAPTER THE SECOND.  Those who are brought up on such a diet can no more attain to wisdom than a kitchen scullion can attain to a keen sense of smell or avoid stinking of the grease.  With your indulgence, I will speak out: you--teachers --are chiefly responsible for the decay of oratory.  With your well modulated and empty tones you have so labored for rhetorical effect that the body of your speech has lost its vigor and died.  Young men did not learn set speeches in the days when Sophocles and Euripides were searching for words in which to express themselves.  In the days when Pindar and the nine lyric poets feared to attempt Homeric verse there was no private tutor to stifle budding genius.  I need not cite the poets for evidence, for I do not find that either Plato or Demosthenes was given to this kind of exercise.  A dignified and, if I may say it, a chaste, style, is neither elaborate nor loaded with ornament; it rises supreme by its own natural purity.  This windy and high-sounding bombast, a recent immigrant to Athens, from Asia, touched with its breath the aspiring minds of youth, with the effect of some pestilential planet, and as soon as the tradition of the past was broken, eloquence halted and was stricken dumb.  Since that, who has attained to the sublimity of Thucydides, who rivalled the fame of Hyperides?  Not a single poem has glowed with a healthy color, but all of them, as though nourished on the same diet, lacked the strength to live to old age.  Painting also suffered the same fate when the presumption of the Egyptians “commercialized” that incomparable art.  (I was holding forth along these lines one day, when Agamemnon came up to us and scanned with a curious eye a person to whom the audience was listening so closely.)     CHAPTER THE THIRD.  He would not permit me to declaim longer in the portico than he himself had sweat in the school, but exclaimed, “Your sentiments do not reflect the public taste, young man, and you are a lover of common sense, which is still more unusual.  For that reason, I will not deceive you as to the secrets of my profession.  The teachers, who must gibber with lunatics, are by no means to blame for these exercises.  Unless they spoke in accordance with the dictates of their young pupils, they would, as Cicero remarks, be left alone in the schools!  And, as designing parasites, when they seek invitations to the tables of the rich, have in mind nothing except what will, in their opinion, be most acceptable to their audience --for in no other way can they secure their ends, save by setting snares for the ears--so it is with the teachers of rhetoric, they might be compared with the fisherman, who, unless he baits his hook with what he knows is most appetizing to the little fish, may wait all day upon some rock, without the hope of a catch.”     CHAPTER THE FOURTH.  What, then, is there to do?  The parents who are unwilling to permit their children to undergo a course of training under strict discipline, are the ones who deserve the reproof.  In the first place, everything they possess, including the children, is devoted to ambition.  Then, that their wishes may the more quickly be realized, they drive these unripe scholars into the forum, and the profession of eloquence, than which none is considered nobler, devolves upon boys who are still in the act of being born!  If, however, they would permit a graded course of study to be prescribed, in order that studious boys might ripen their minds by diligent reading; balance their judgment by precepts of wisdom, correct their compositions with an unsparing pen, hear at length what they ought to imitate, and be convinced that nothing can be sublime when it is designed to catch the fancy of boys, then the grand style of oratory would immediately recover the weight and splendor of its majesty.  Now the boys play in the schools, the young men are laughed at in the forum, and, a worse symptom than either, no one, in his old age, will confess the errors he was taught in his school days.  But that you may not imagine that I disapprove of a jingle in the Lucilian manner, I will deliver my opinions in verse,--     CHAPTER THE FIFTH.      “The man who emerges with fame, from the school of stern art,       Whose mind gropes for lofty ideals, to bring them to light,       Must first, under rigid frugality, study his part;       Nor yearn for the courts of proud princes who frown in their might:       Nor scheme with the riff-raf, a client in order to dine,       Nor can he with evil companions his wit drown in wine       Nor sit, as a hireling, applauding an actor’s grimace.       But, whether the fortress of arms-bearing Tritonis smile       Upon him, or land which the Spartan colonials grace,       Or home of the sirens, with poetry let him beguile       The years of young manhood, and at the Maeonian spring       His fortunate soul drink its fill: Then, when later, the lore       Of Socrates’ school he has mastered, the reins let him fling,       And brandish the weapons that mighty Demosthenes bore.       Then, steeped in the culture and music of Greece, let his taste       Be ripened and mellowed by all the great writers of Rome.       At first, let him haunt not the courts; let his pages be graced       By ringing and rhythmic effusions composed in his home       Next, banquets and wars be his theme, sung in soul-stirring chant,       In eloquent words such as undaunted Cicero chose.       Come!  Gird up thy soul!  Inspiration will then force a vent       And rush in a flood from a heart that is loved by the muse!”     CHAPTER THE SIXTH.  I was listening so attentively to this speech that I did not notice the flight of Ascyltos, and while I was pacing the gardens, engulfed in this flood-tide of rhetoric, a large crowd of students came out upon the portico, having, it would seem, just listened to an extemporaneous declamation, of I know not whom, the speaker of which had taken exceptions to the speech of Agamemnon.  While, therefore, the young men were making fun of the sentiments of this last speaker, and criticizing the arrangement of the whole speech, I seized the opportunity and went after Ascyltos, on the run; but, as I neither held strictly to the road, nor knew where the inn was located, wherever I went, I kept coming back to the same place, until, worn out with running, and long since dripping with sweat, I approached a certain little old woman who sold country vegetables.     CHAPTER THE SEVENTH.  “Please, mother,” I wheedled, “you don’t know where I lodge, do you?”  Delighted with such humorous affability, “What’s the reason I don’t” she replied, and getting upon her feet, she commenced to walk ahead of me.  I took her for a prophetess until, when presently we came to a more obscure quarter, the affable old lady pushed aside a crazy-quilt and remarked, “Here’s where you ought to live,” and when I denied that I recognized the house, I saw some men prowling stealthily between the rows of name-boards and naked prostitutes.  Too late I realized that I had been led into a brothel.  After cursing the wiles of the little old hag, I covered my head and commenced to run through the middle of the night-house to the exit opposite, when, lo and behold! whom should I meet on the very threshold but Ascyltos himself, as tired as I was, and almost dead; you would have thought that he had been brought by the self-same little old hag!  I smiled at that, greeted him cordially, and asked him what he was doing in such a scandalous place.     CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.  Wiping away the sweat with his hands, he replied, “If you only knew what I have gone through!”  “What was it?”  I demanded.  “A most respectable looking person came up to me,” he made reply, “while I was wandering all over the town and could not find where I had left my inn, and very graciously offered to guide me.  He led me through some very dark and crooked alleys, to this place, pulled out his tool, and commenced to beg me to comply with his appetite.  A whore had already vacated her cell for an as, and he had laid hands upon me, and, but for the fact that I was the stronger, I would have been compelled to take my medicine.”  (While Ascyltos was telling me of his bad luck, who should come up again but this same very respectable looking person, in company with a woman not at all bad looking, and, looking at Ascyltos, he requested him to enter the house, assuring him that there was nothing to fear, and, since he was unwilling to take the passive part, he should have the active.  The woman, on her part, urged me very persistently to accompany her, so we followed the couple, at last, and were conducted between the rows of name-boards, where we saw, in cells, many persons of each sex amusing themselves in such a manner) that it seemed to me that every one of them must have been drinking satyrion.  (On catching sight of us, they attempted to seduce us with paederastic wantonness, and one wretch, with his clothes girded up, assaulted Ascyltos, and, having thrown him down upon a couch, attempted to gore him from above.  I succored the sufferer immediately, however,) and having joined forces, we defied the troublesome wretch.  (Ascyltos ran out of the house and took to his heels, leaving me as the object of their lewd attacks, but the crowd, finding me the stronger in body and purpose, let me go unharmed.)
