It was the noon sun that woke me. I wasn't just warm. I was _hot_.  And I was very reluctant to let go of my dream; I kept grabbing at the tag ends of it with both hands. It was the most exciting dream I'd had since the one about succeeding Mr. Picks. Only _very_ different.  I'd made a fortune cultivating perfume trees. My dream was full of perfume. Some of it came from the exotic plants of my African estate. Some of it was from a long-legged, pink-haired girl, the kind African millionaires have.  It was the sort of dream, I mused, unable to keep it in mood any longer, as large-minded men have. Men like--Uncle Isadore!  I sat up suddenly. Uncle Isadore--large-minded? Why hadn't he had the avuncular decency to leave me his fortune the usual way?  Why?         *       *       *       *       *  Because then he wouldn't be able to play penny-ante psychology and get me dreaming about wild schemes with perfume trees and African estates. That's why.  Or maybe there wasn't any fortune! Suddenly I understood why people smoke. It gives them something to do when they feel helpless.  If there wasn't any fortune, then I was hopelessly tied to the perfume trees. If Uncle Izzy had lost his last cent, it would be very like him to borrow enough from friends to finance a perfume tree scheme. And if he didn't make it to the planet he had in mind--why, he'd make the planet he'd crashed on do.  Anyone else would have shot the birds for fresh meat. Anyone else would have seen immediately that Alvarla was the last planet in the Galaxy where perfume trees would grow.  Anyone else would have seen immediately that I was one of the minor, comfortable people in the world who likes the happy regularities of a little job and an assured, if limited, future. Anyone else would have seen I had the sort of personality that could not be changed.  But Uncle Izzy wasn't anyone else.  _Why_ did I keep smelling the perfume from my dream?  I followed my nose out of the crater and found the snow melting around a water tank about four feet long and two feet in diameter--part of the ruined fuel system from Uncle Izzy's ship.  I dislodged it from the ice beneath and shook it. The perfume was so strong, as it unfroze, that it made me dizzy. And all that smell was coming from a pinhole.  There seemed to be half a gallon in it. Enough to pay off Mother's bonds and whatever I owed Rene, with a handsome sum left over for me.  I could go home and forget about perfume trees and Alvarla and Uncle Isadore.  But that dream of the African estate kept irritating the back of my mind. And the large, free sky of Alvarla was soothing to the eye, when compared to the little squares of blue I noted occasionally when riding the slidewalks of Brooklyn.  What _did_ I want out of life, anyway? _Damn_ Uncle Isadore. I'd never test 10:9 on job adjustment again.  I was still thinking when evening swept in fast, as it does in dry climates, and the birds began to wake up and climb out of the crater, presumably to forage for food.  \"Wait!\" I cried. \"Isadore!\"         *       *       *       *       *  I drew out a lunch package and spread it to attract him. It attracted all of them.  I pulled out \"The Dodo.\"  \"'Tell me what thy lordly name is/On the Night's Plutonian shore.'\"  \"Isadore,\" he volunteered, swallowing fast while I climbed aboard him.  \"Take me back.\"  Then I realized I had made a mistake with the food.  \"Go!\" I cried. \"Spaceship! More food!\" He just stood there, his beak poking around the ground for crumbs.  But I had to get that skin spray washed off before twenty-four hours were up.  \"Nepenthe!\" I shouted desperately.  The dodo was off like a flash and didn't stop till we were back at the ship.  \"You were gone quite a while,\" Rene said nonchalantly. \"Find anything?\"  \"Enough to pay you off,\" I said. \"And we'll make it five thousand because _I_ found it. Stow this somewhere. It's perfume.\"  He did. \"Find anything else?\"  \"Nothing that would interest you. I'll be ready to blast off as soon as I've had a shower.\"  Rene shrugged.  The perfume, when we returned to Earth, proved to be worth what he'd said it would be. A lot of people wanted to know where I'd gotten it. \"The crops on Odoria,\" they said, \"are entirely sewed up by Odoria, Inc.\"  \"They certainly are,\" I always replied agreeably.  It took all I cleared from the perfume to put a down payment on a ship and hire an expert on fertilizing perfume flowers. But this time _I_ wanted to run the show.  Mr. Picks shook his head sadly when I told him to replace me permanently.  \"You have a great future ahead of you in studs and neck clasps,\" he said. \"Why not take a little time and reconsider your decision? Or--\"  \"Nevermore,\" I answered.         *       *       *       *       *  Not until five years later did I find out what happened to the rest of good old Uncle Algernon's fortune.  I was stretched out on a gently undulating force-field in my interior patio, a huge, scarlet fan-flower tree sifting in the sunshine. Leda, her pink hair flowing down to her knees, was just emerging from the pool of grilch milk. She bent to an Aphrodite of Cnidos position.  \"Perfect!\" I said, and threw away my cigarene.  \"Depart!\" I told the robot, who came rolling in.  \"But, master, it's the Cha'n of Betelgeuse, Lord of the Seven Planets and the Four Hundred Moons.\"  \"Get dressed, Leda,\" I said regretfully. \"We have company.\"  I'd never met him, but I knew he was one of Uncle Isadore's best friends and I felt obliged to see him.  The Cha'n had several meals and four cigarenes, maintaining a courteous silence all the while. Then he loosened his belt, reached into his furry pouch and handed me a piece of copper scroll.  It was a check for five million dollars.  \"You won,\" he told me. \"Or lost, as the case may be.\"  I just looked at him.  \"I was holding it in trust for you,\" the Cha'n explained, \"in accordance with your Uncle Isadore's last wishes.\"  I blew a perfect smoke ring, let it float before my face for a perfect moment, and then asked, \"And suppose I had lost? Or won, as the case may be?\"  \"I was to save it to try on your son, the gods permitting you have one.\"  \"If necessary,\" I told him, \"I'll try it on him myself, O Cha'n of the Seven Planets and the Four Hundred Moons.\"  \"Call me Charlie,\" he said."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51759"],["title","Traveling Companion Wanted (#0)"],["body","Companion Wanted                             By Richard Wilson                           Illustrated by DILLON             [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from                       Galaxy Magazine June 1959.

You remember Regan. He's the man who fell overboard in a spacesuit and found that there really is a passage to India. It winds down from the Champion Deep in the Atlantic and comes out somewhere off Bombay. It took Regan a week to pop in one end of that underworld river and emerge at the other. He was delirious when he bobbed to the surface and was picked up by the Chinese motorship. Starved, of course; had to spend a long time in the hospital after he'd been transferred to shore.  The newspapers and radio and television made quite a thing of it. Reporters managed to interview Regan while he was still weak and maybe talking a little crazy. They got together afterward and agreed among themselves on what parts to leave out. Then Regan sold the first-person rights to a syndicate. He insisted on writing the installments himself, but a lot was edited out while the staff writer was re-doing it.  I didn't hear Regan's unpublished story till I met him in the bar at the Palmer House in Chicago. He'd been attending a geophysical meeting that I'd had to cover and we'd both got bored with it about the same time. I thought I recognized him from his pictures and said so. Regan seemed glad to have a non-longhair to talk to, and he talked.  You know why Regan had been wearing a spacesuit in the first place; he'd become something of a hero on the return trip of one of the Earth-Mars hops after a meteor struck. Regan went out through the airlock to make repairs. It was his job as chief of maintenance. Patched up the hole and went back in. Routine, he said.  But the skipper messaged a report to Earth, and when the spaceship reached the way station to take on landing fuel, the press was waiting for it. The photographers were along and they wanted Regan to re-enact the repair scene. He didn't want to, but the skipper insisted because it would be good public relations. So Regan climbed into the spacesuit again and took along his mobile repair gear and tinkered away on the hull while the photogs snapped away from a patrol boat.  That was when the repair unit went out of whack.         *       *       *       *       *  Its mobility factor wasn't supposed to do anything more than move him around on the hull to wherever he had to go. He'd worked with it a hundred times in test sessions and once in reality and it'd always been a lamb. But this time it went all screwy and shoved him off the hull. In some way one of the conduits wrapped itself around his arms like an octopus, pinning them so he couldn't reach the controls. And in some other way the tiny rocket engine zipped over to full power and plunged him down toward Earth.  If it had headed him out toward space, it would have been all right. The patrol boat could have overtaken him in a few hours at most and hauled him aboard. But Regan was heading Earthward and soon he was down where the traffic's pretty congested. The patrol boat made some valiant efforts, but after a couple of near misses with transcontinental rockets, it gave up. Better to lose one person than a couple of hundred.  Radio messages were sent to low-flying craft and ships at sea. These didn't do any good, except that a trawler was able to spot the position where Regan, in his spacesuit, smacked the water and went under. The trawler didn't have a radio transmitter. It waited a while, and when nothing came up, it put about for land. A day later, the spot where Regan had gone down was alive with would-be rescue ships, submarines and diving equipment.  But Regan never came up--not in that ocean, at any rate.  I knew this story pretty well, so Regan didn't elaborate on it. He'd blacked out, anyway, soon after he hit the atmosphere and didn't come to till he was close to smacking the surface. That's when it began to get interesting.  You've seen enough undersea movies to know what the ocean is like, so we won't go into that. This is what happened when Regan got down to what should have been the bottom:  There was a big crater there, with the bottom stretching away in all directions from the cavity--but the hole itself kept going down. Funnel-shaped, Regan said. He could see it quite clearly because he was plunging into it head down. The tentacles of the conduit were still wrapped around his arms and the mobility gadget's rocket was naturally working almost as well under water as it had in space.  After a while, it got dark, with Regan still zipping along into the depths of the funnel. He'd long since passed the stage of being merely worried; now he was scared. By this time, it was entirely black, but Regan could sense that he was being carried along swiftly.         *       *       *       *       *  Not because he thought it would do any good, but because he had to do something, Regan experimented with his feet. He found that after some back-stretching calisthenics he was able to bring his right boot up near his waist. Maneuvering it with total disregard for his sacroiliac, Regan managed to hook the boot under one of the coils the conduit had made around him. Gradually he was able to loosen it enough to give his left arm some play and from there it was relatively simple. He switched off the rocket engine, switched on his headlamp and looked around.  Regan said it was quite a sight, in a reverse sort of way. Nothing anywhere. With the rocket turned off, he kind of floated around aimlessly, going nowhere in particular. He should have been going up, but that didn't happen. He swirled like a lazy eddy. A school of things that were caricatures of fish--big, white, revolting things--swished over and puckered blindly into his faceplate, then went away. Otherwise there was nothing.  Regan was pretty discouraged. By this time, he'd been in a slow spin for so long that he had no idea which way was up. He had the equipment for getting up--there were about two hundred hours of fuel in the rocket engine strapped to his back--but no way seemed any better than another.  He remembered that the funnel had steadily narrowed and so he tried experimental bursts from the engine to see if he could reach one of the sides. Eventually he got to something that wasn't water. It was a sort of mud. Regan studied the markings on it for a possible clue. No go. Regan was a spaceman, not an oceanographer.  So, since it was better than doing nothing, Regan got himself into a drift parallel with the mud side and switched on his rocket.  He whizzed along at a good rate, staying close to the mud wall, but not knowing whether he was going down, up or around in circles at the same depth. After what he judged to be some hours of this, the mud began to be streaked with a gray substance and, still farther along, it appeared to become rock. Regan didn't know whether this was good or bad.  More hours went by, apparently. Regan was wearing a watch, but it was hidden under the heavy sleeve of his spacesuit. He dozed off, he said, and when he snapped back into consciousness he noticed that there was another wall, far off, opposite the one he was rocketing along.  It was gray, too, as far as he could make out in the light of his headlamp, which was weak over distances. What woke him up fully was something that went skimming past him at a much greater rate than his own. It was a cask, its wood brown as if from long submersion and its hoops rusted into redness. The cask was turning lazily end over end, but it outdistanced him and disappeared ahead as he watched. It had been traveling out in the middle of the passage.         *       *       *       *       *  Regan pondered this for a while and then reasoned that there was a swift current, swifter in the middle even than his rocket propulsion at the side of the channel. He worked himself out toward the center, then switched off his rocket, experimentally. By watching the rock side of the passage, he was able to gauge that he was moving much faster.  The watching, however, had a hypnotic effect on him and Regan felt himself dozing off. He tried to fight it but reasoned finally that there wasn't much point. So he turned off his headlamp and let himself go to sleep.  He felt weird when he woke up. He was hot and sweating. He remembered instantly where he was. It was no comfort to him. He felt entirely hopeless, even more so than if he'd been marooned in space. At least there was traffic out there. Here there was just himself, with a wooden cask up ahead and nightmarish fish somewhere behind.  He also felt weak. Spacesuits come equipped with water, of course, if they're the repair variety, and Regan drank sparingly through the tube at the base of his faceplate. But his suit carried no rations, so he tried to ignore his hunger.  He drowsed again and switched off his headlamp. This became a pattern for him--a semi-conscious nightmare of smooth, eerie motion, punctuated with sips at his water supply and hopeless watching through the faceplate, blinking away the sweat. Regan talked to himself, he said, and sometimes sang, to keep himself sane in the silence and loneliness. It probably helped, although some of his talk was pretty idiotic.  It was after one of his dozes--whose duration he had no way of measuring even by his thirst and hunger, which were constant--that he awoke to something new. Automatically he switched on his headlamp, then switched it off again, realizing what the newness was.  The passage he was being washed through was no longer dark; there was a radiance in the water now.  Regan"]]]
