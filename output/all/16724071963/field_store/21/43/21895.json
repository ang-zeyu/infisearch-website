Her warm, clear laughter, teasing him, tumbled forth like a cloud of gay butterflies.  \"Are you afraid to see me here at home because my husband might _walk in on us_?\"  Bill had been put completely at ease by this bantering indication that Clara knew who he was and welcomed him as an intriguing diversion. Quite literally, the one person who could not _walk in on them_, as the ancients thought of it, was his own hypoalter, Conrad Manz.         *       *       *       *       *  Bill finished retouching his makeup and hurried to leave the apartment. But this time, as he passed the table where Mary's dinner was set out, he decided to write a few words to the child, no matter how empty they sounded to himself. The note he left explained that he had some early work to do at the microfilm library where he worked.  Just as Bill was leaving the apartment, the visiophone buzzed. In his hurry Bill flipped the switch before he thought. Too late, his hand froze and the implications of this call, an hour before anyone would normally be home, shot a shaft of terror through him.  But it was not the image of a medicop that formed on the screen. The woman introduced herself as Mrs. Harris, one of Mary's teachers.  It was strange that she should have thought he might be home. The shift for children was half a day earlier than that for adults, so the parents could have half their rest day free. This afternoon would be for Mary the first classes of her shift, but the teacher must have guessed something was wrong with the shifting schedules in Mary's family. Or had the child told her?  Mrs. Harris explained rather dramatically that Mary was being neglected. What could he say; to her? That he was a criminal breaking drug regulations in the most flagrant manner? That nothing, not even the child appointed to him, meant more to him than his wife's own hypoalter? Bill finally ended the hopeless and possibly dangerous conversation by turning off the receiver and leaving the apartment.  Bill realized that now, for both him and Clara, the greatest joy had been those first few times together. The enormous threat of a Medicorps retaliation took the pleasure from their contact and they came together desperately because, having tasted this fantastic non-conformity and the new undrugged intimacy, there was no other way for them. Even now as he drove through the traffic toward where she would be waiting, he was not so much concerned with meeting Clara in their fear-poisoned present as with the vivid, aching remembrance of what those meetings once had really been like.  He recalled an evening they had spent lying on the summer lawn of the park, looking out at the haze-dimmed stars. It had been shortly after Clara joined him in cutting down on the drugs, and the clear memory of their quiet laughter so captured his mind now that Bill almost tangled his car in the traffic.  In memory he kissed her again and, as it had then, the newly cut grass mixed with the exciting fragrance of her skin. After the kiss they continued a mock discussion of the ancient word \"sin.\" Bill pretended to be trying to explain the meaning of the word to her, sometimes with definitions that kept them laughing and sometimes with demonstrational kisses that stopped their laughter.  He could remember Clara's face turned to him in the evening light with an outrageous parody of interest. He could hear himself saying, \"You see, the ancients would say we are not _sinning_ because they would disagree with the medicops that you and Helen are two completely different people, or that Conrad and I are not the same person.\"  Clara kissed him with an air of tentative experimentation. \"Mmm, no. I can't say I care for that interpretation.\"  \"You'd rather be sinning?\"  \"Definitely.\"  \"Well, if the ancients did agree with the medicops that we are distinct from our alters, Helen and Conrad, then they would say we are sinning--but not for the same reasons the Medicorps would give.\"  \"That,\" asserted Clara, \"is where I get lost. If this sinning business is going to be worth anything at all, it has to be something you can identify.\"  Bill cut his car out of the main stream of traffic and toward the park, without interrupting his memory.  \"Well, darling, I don't want to confuse you, but the medicops would say we are sinning only because you are my wife's hypoalter, and I am your husband's hyperalter--in other words, for the very reason the ancients would say we are _not_ sinning. Furthermore, if either of us were with anyone else, the medicops would think it was perfectly all right, and so would Conrad and Helen. Provided, of course, I took a hyperalter and you took a hypoalter only.\"  \"Of course,\" Clara said, and Bill hurried over the gloomy fact.  \"The ancients, on the other hand, would say we are sinning because we are making love to someone we are not married to.\"  \"But what's the matter with that? Everybody does it.\"  \"The ancient Moderns didn't. Or, that is, they often did, but....\"  Clara brought her full lips hungrily to his. \"Darling, I think the ancient Moderns had the right idea, though I don't see how they ever arrived at it.\"  Bill grinned. \"It was just an invention of theirs, along with the wheel and atomic energy.\"  That evening was long gone by as Bill stopped the little taxi beside the park and left it there for the next user. He walked across the lawns toward the statue where he and Clara always met. The very thought of entering one's own hypoalter's house was so unnerving that Bill brought himself to do it only by first meeting Clara near the statue. As he walked between the trees, Bill could not again capture the spirit of that evening he had been remembering. The Medicorps was too close. It was impossible to laugh that way now.  Bill arrived at the statue, but Clara was not there. He waited impatiently while a livid sunset coagulated between the branches of the great trees. Clara should have been there first. It was easier for her, because she was leaving her shift, and without doing it prematurely.  The park was like a quiet backwater in the eddying rush of the evening city. Bill felt conspicuous and vulnerable in the gloaming light. Above all, he felt a new loneliness, and he knew that now Clara felt it, too. They needed each other as each had been, before fear had bleached their feeling to white bones of desperation.  They were not taking their drugs as prescribed, and for that they would be horribly punished. That was the only unforgivable _sin_ in their world. By committing it, he and Clara had found out what life could be, in the same act that would surely take life from them. Their powerful emotions they had found in abundance simply by refusing to take the drugs, and by being together briefly each fifth day in a dangerous breach of all convention. The closer their discovery and the greater their terror, the more desperately they needed even their terror, and the more impossible became the delight of their first meetings.  Telegraphing bright beads of sound, a night bird skimmed the sunset lawns to the looming statue and skewed around its monolithic base. The bird's piping doubled and then choked off as it veered frantically from Bill. After a while, far off through the park, it released a fading protest of song.  Above Bill, the towering statue of the great Alfred Morris blackened against the sunset. The hollowed granite eyes bore down on him out of an undecipherable dark ... the ancient, implacable face of the Medicorps. As if to pronounce a sentence on his present crimes by a magical disclosure of the weight of centuries, a pool of sulfurous light and leaf shadows danced on the painted plaque at the base of the statue.      On this spot in the Gregorian year 1996, Alfred Morris announced to     an assembly of war survivors the hypothalamic block. His stirring     words were, \"This new drug selectively halts at the thalamic brain     the upward flow of unconscious stimuli and the downward flow of     unconscious motivations. It acts as a screen between the cerebrum     and the psychosomatic discharge system. Using hypothalamic block,     we will not act emotively, we will initiate acts only from the     logical demands of situations.\"      This announcement and the subsequent wholehearted action of the     war-weary people made the taking of hypothalamic block obligatory.     This put an end to the powerful play of unconscious mind in the     public and private affairs of the ancient world. It ended the     great paranoid wars and saved mankind.  In the strange evening light, the letters seemed alive, a centuries-old condemnation of any who might try to go back to the ancient pre-pharmacy days. Of course, it was not really possible to go back. Without drugs, everybody and all society would fall apart.  The ancients had first learned to keep endocrine deviates such as the diabetic alive with drugs. Later they learned with other drugs to \"cure\" the far more prevalent disease, schizophrenia, that was jamming their hospitals. The big change came when the ancients used these same drugs on everyone to control the private and public irrationality of their time and stop the wars.  In this new, drugged world, the schizophrene thrived better than any, and the world became patterned on him. But, just as the diabetic was still diabetic, the schizophrene was still himself, plus the drugs. Meanwhile, everyone had forgotten what it was the drugs did to you--that the emotions experienced were blurred emotions, that insight was at an isolated level of rationality because the drugs kept true feelings from ever emerging.  How inconceivable it would be to Helen and the other people of his world to live on as little drug as possible ... to experience the conflicting emotions, the interplay of passion and logic that almost tore you apart! Sober, the ancients called it, and they lived that way most of the time, with only the occasional crude and clublike effects of alcohol or"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51842"],["title","Beyond Bedlam (#5)"],["body","to relieve their chronic anxiety.  By taking as little hypothalamic block as possible, he and Clara were able to desire their fantastic attachment, to delight in an absolutely illogical situation unheard of in their society. But the society would judge their refusal to take hypothalamic block in only one sense. The weight of this judgment stood before him in the smoldering words, \"_It ended the great paranoid wars and saved mankind_.\"  When Clara did appear, she was searching myopically in the wrong vicinity of the statue. He did not call to her at once, letting the sight of her smooth out the tensions in him, convert all the conflicts into this one intense longing to be with her.  Her halting search for him was deeply touching, like that of a tragic little puppet in a darkening dumbshow. He saw suddenly how like puppets the two of them were. They were moved by the strengthening wires of a new life of feeling to batter clumsily at an implacable stage setting that would finally leave them as bits of wood and paper.  Then suddenly in his arms Clara was at the same time hungrily moving and tense with fear of discovery. Little sounds of love and fear choked each other in her throat. Her blonde head pressed tightly into his shoulder and she clung to him with desperation.  She said, \"Conrad was disturbed by my tension this morning and made me take a sleeping compound. I've just awakened.\"  They walked to her home in silence and even in the darkened apartment they used only the primitive monosyllables of apprehensive need. Beyond these mere sounds of compassion, they had long ago said all that could be said.  Because Bill was the hyperalter, he had no fear that Conrad could force a shift on him. When later they lay in darkness, he allowed himself to drift into a brief slumber. Without the sleeping compound, distorted events came and went without reason. Dreaming, the ancients had called it. It was one of the most frightening things that had begun to happen when he first cut down on the drugs. Now, in the few seconds that he dozed, a thousand fragments of incidental knowledge, historical reading and emotional need melded and, in a strange contrast to their present tranquility, he was dreaming a frightful moment in the 20th century. _These are the great paranoid wars_, he thought. And it was so because he had thought it.  He searched frantically through the glove compartment of an ancient automobile. \"Wait,\" he pleaded. \"I tell you we have sulfonamide-14. We've been taking it regularly as directed. We took a double dose back in Paterson because there were soft-bombs all through that part of Jersey and we didn't know what would be declared Plague Area next.\"  Now Bill threw things out of his satchel onto the floor and seat of the car, fumbling deeper by the flashlight Clara held. His heart beat thickly with terror. Then he remembered his pharmacase. Oh, why hadn't they remembered sooner about their pharmacases. Bill tore at the belt about his waist.  The Medicorps captain stepped back from the door of their car. He jerked his head at the dark form of the corporal standing in the roadway. \"Shoot them. Run the car off the embankment before you burn it.\"  Bill screamed metallically through the speaker of his radiation mask. \"Wait. I've found it.\" He thrust the pharmacase out the door of the car. \"This is a pharmacase,\" he explained. \"We keep our drugs in one of these and it's belted to our waist so we are never without them.\"  The captain of the Medicorps came back. He inspected the pharmacase and the drugs and returned it. \"From now on, keep your drugs handy. Take them without fail according to radio instructions. Do you understand?\"  Clara's head pressed heavily against Bill's shoulder, and he could hear the tinny sound of her sobbing through the speaker of her mask.  The captain stepped into the road again. \"We'll have to burn your car. You passed through a Plague Area and it can't be sterilized on this route. About a mile up this road you'll come to a sterilization unit. Stop and have your person and belongings rayed. After that, keep walking, but stick to the road. You'll be shot if you're caught off it.\"  The road was crowded with fleeing people. Their way was lighted by piles of cadavers writhing in gasoline flames. The Medicorps was everywhere. Those who stumbled, those who coughed, the delirious and their helping partners ... these were taken to the side of the road, shot and burned. And there was bombing again to the south.  Bill stopped in the middle of the road and looked back. Clara clung to him.  \"There is a plague here we haven't any drug for,\" he said, and realized he was crying. \"We are all mad.\"  Clara was crying too. \"Darling, what have you done? Where are the drugs?\"  The water of the Hudson hung as it had in the late afternoon, ice crystals in the stratosphere. The high, high sheet flashed and glowed in the new bombing to the south, where multicolored pillars of flame boiled into the sky. But the muffled crash of the distant bombing was suddenly the steady click of the urgent signal on a bedside visiophone, and Bill was abruptly awake.  Clara was throwing on her robe and moving toward the machine on terror-rigid limbs. With a scrambling motion, Bill got out of the possible view of the machine and crouched at the end of the room.  Distinctly, he could hear the machine say, \"Clara Manz?\"  \"Yes.\" Clara's voice was a thin treble that could have been a shriek had it continued.  \"This is Medicorps Headquarters. A routine check discloses you have delayed your shift two hours. To maintain the statistical record of deviations, please give us a full explanation.\"  \"I ...\" Clara had to swallow before she could talk. \"I must have taken too much sleeping compound.\"  \"Mrs. Manz, our records indicate that you have been delaying your shift consistently for several periods now. We made a check of this as a routine follow up on any such deviation, but the discovery is quite serious.\" There was a harsh silence, a silence that demanded a logical answer. But how could there be a logical answer?  \"My hyperalter hasn't complained and I--well, I have just let a bad habit develop. I'll see that it--doesn't happen again.\"  The machine voiced several platitudes about the responsibilities of one personality to another and the duty of all to society before Clara was able to shut it off.  Both of them sat as they were for a long, long time while the tide of terror subsided. When at last they looked at each other across the dim and silent room, both of them knew there could be at least one more time together before they were caught.         *       *       *       *       *  Five days later, on the last day of her shift, Mary Walden wrote the address of her appointed father's hypoalter, Conrad Manz, with an indelible pencil on the skin just below her armpit.  During the morning, her father and mother had spoiled the family rest day by quarreling. It was about Helen's hypoalter delaying so many shifts. Bill did not think it very important, but her mother was angry and threatened to complain to the Medicorps.  The lunch was eaten in silence, except that at one point Bill said, \"It seems to me Conrad and Clara Manz are guilty of a peculiar marriage, not us. Yet they seem perfectly happy with it and you're the one who is made unhappy. The woman has probably just developed a habit of taking too much sleeping compound for her rest day naps. Why don't you drop her a note?\"  Helen made only one remark. It was said through her teeth and very softly. \"Bill, I would just as soon the child did not realize her relationship to this sordid situation.\"  Mary cringed over the way Helen disregarded her hearing, the possibility that she might be capable of understanding, or her feelings about being shut out of their mutual world.  After the lunch Mary cleared the table, throwing the remains of the meal and the plastiplates into the flash trash disposer. Her father had retreated to the library room and Helen was getting ready to attend a Citizen's Meeting. Mary heard her mother enter the room to say good-bye while she was wiping the dining table. She knew that Helen was standing, well-dressed and a little impatient, just behind her, but she pretended she did not know.  \"Darling, I'm leaving now for the Citizen's Meeting.\"  \"Oh ... yes.\"  \"Be a good girl and don't be late for your shift. You only have an hour now.\" Helen's patrician face smiled.  \"I won't be late.\"  \"Don't pay any attention to the things Bill and I discussed this morning, will you?\"  \"No.\"  And she was gone. She did not say good-bye to Bill.  Mary was very conscious of her father in the house. He continued to sit in the library. She walked by the door and she could see him sitting in a chair, staring at the floor. Mary stood in the sun room for a long while. If he had risen from his chair, if he had rustled a page, if he had sighed, she would have heard him.  It grew closer and closer to the time she would have to leave if Susan Shorrs was to catch the first school hours of her shift. Why did children have to shift half a day before adults?  Finally, Mary thought of something to say. She could let him know she was old enough to understand what the quarrel had been about if only it were explained to her.  Mary went into the library and hesitantly sat on the edge, of a couch near him. He did not look at her and his face seemed gray in the midday light. Then she knew that he was lonely, too. But a great feeling of tenderness for him went through her.  \"Sometimes I think you and Clara Manz must be the only people in the world,\" she said abruptly, \"who aren't so silly about shifting right on the dot. Why, I don't _care_ if Susan Shorrs _is_ an hour late for classes!\"  Those first moments when he seized her in his arms, it seemed her heart would shake loose. It was as though she had uttered some magic formula, one that had abruptly opened the doors to his love. It was only after he "]]]
