Thomas the Trap-Smasher nodded in the direction of the signal.  \"The council's beginning, boy. We'll talk later, on expedition. Now remember this: stealing from the third category is your own idea, and all your own idea. Forget everything else we've talked about. If you hit any trouble with the chief, I'll be there. I'm your sponsor, after all.\"  He threw an arm about his confused nephew and walked to the end of the burrow where the other members of the band waited.   II  The tribe had gathered in its central and largest burrow under the great, hanging glow lamps that might be used in this place alone. Except for the few sentinels on duty in the outlying corridors, all of Mankind was here. It was an awesome sight to behold.  On the little hillock known as the Royal Mound, lolled Franklin the Father of Many Thieves, Chieftain of all Mankind. He alone of the cluster of warriors displayed heaviness of belly and flabbiness of arm--for he alone had the privilege of a sedentary life. Beside the sternly muscled band leaders who formed his immediate background, he looked almost womanly; and yet one of his many titles was simply The Man.  Yes, unquestionably The Man of Mankind was Franklin the Father of Many Thieves. You could tell it from the hushed, respectful attitudes of the subordinate warriors who stood at a distance from the mound. You could tell it from the rippling interest of the women as they stood on the other side of the great burrow, drawn up in the ranks of the Female Society. You could tell it from the nervousness and scorn with which the women were watched by their leader, Ottilie, the Chieftain's First Wife. And finally, you could tell it from the faces of the children, standing in a distant, disorganized bunch. A clear majority of their faces bore an unmistakable resemblance to Franklin's.  Franklin clapped his hands, three evenly spaced, flesh-heavy wallops.  \"In the name of our ancestors,\" he said, \"and the science with which they ruled the Earth, I declare this council opened. May it end as one more step in the regaining of their science. Who asked for a council?\"  \"I did.\" Thomas the Trap-Smasher moved out of his band and stood before the chief.  Franklin nodded, and went on with the next, formal question:  \"And your reason?\"  \"As a band leader, I call attention to a candidate for manhood. A member of my band, a spear-carrier for the required time, and an accepted apprentice in the Male Society. My nephew, Eric the Only.\"  As his name was sung out, Eric shook himself. Half on his own volition and half in response to the pushes he received from the other warriors, he stumbled up to his uncle and faced the chief. This, the most important moment of his life, was proving almost too much for him. So many people in one place, accredited and famous warriors, knowledgeable and attractive women, the chief himself, all this after the shattering revelations from his uncle--he was finding it hard to think clearly. And it was vital to think clearly. His responses to the next few questions had to be exactly right.         *       *       *       *       *  The chief was asking the first: \"Eric the Only, do you apply for full manhood?\"  Eric breathed hard and nodded. \"I do.\"  \"As a full man, what will be your value to Mankind?\"  \"I will steal for Mankind whatever it needs. I will defend Mankind against all outsiders. I will increase the possessions and knowledge of the Female Society so that the Female Society can increase the power and well-being of Mankind.\"  \"And all this you swear to do?\"  \"And all this I swear to do.\"  The Chief turned to Eric's uncle. \"As his sponsor, do you support his oath and swear that he is to be trusted?\"  With just the faintest hint of sarcasm in his voice, Thomas the Trap-Smasher replied: \"Yes. I support his oath and swear that he is to be trusted.\"  There was a rattling moment, the barest second, when the chief's eyes locked with those of the band leader. With all that was on Eric's mind at the moment, he noticed it. Then the chief looked away and pointed to the women on the other side of the burrow.  \"He is accepted as a candidate by the men. Now the women must ask for proof, for only a woman's proof bestows full manhood.\"  The first part was over. And it hadn't been too bad. Eric turned to face the advancing leaders of the Female Society, Ottilie, the Chieftain's First Wife, in the center. Now came the part that scared him. The women's part.  As was customary at such a moment, his uncle and sponsor left him when the women came forward. Thomas the Trap-Smasher led his band to the warriors grouped about the Throne Mound. There, with their colleagues, they folded their arms across their chests and turned to watch. A man can only give proof of his manhood while he is alone; his friends cannot support him once the women approach.  It was not going to be easy, Eric realized. He had hoped that at least one of his uncle's wives would be among the three examiners: they were both kindly people who liked him and had talked to him much about the mysteries of women's work. But he had drawn a trio of hard-faced females who apparently intended to take him over the full course before they passed him.  Sarah the Sickness-Healer opened the proceedings. She circled him belligerently, hands on hips, her great breasts rolling to and fro like a pair of swollen pendulums, her eyes glittering with scorn.  \"Eric the Only,\" she intoned, and then paused to grin, as if it were a name impossible to believe, \"Eric the Singleton, Eric the one and only child of either his mother or his father. Your parents almost didn't have enough between them to make a solitary child. Is there enough in you to make a man?\"         *       *       *       *       *  There was a snigger of appreciation from the children in the distance, and it was echoed by a few growling laughs from the vicinity of the Throne Mound. Eric felt his face and neck go red. He would have fought any man to the death for remarks like these. Any man at all. But who could lift his hand to a woman and be allowed to live? Besides, one of the main purposes of this exhibition was to investigate his powers of self-control.  \"I think so,\" he managed to say after a long pause. \"And I'm willing to prove it.\"  \"Prove it, then!\" the woman snarled. Her right hand, holding a long, sharp-pointed pin, shot to his chest like a flung spear. Eric made his muscles rigid and tried to send his mind away. That, the men had told him, was what you had to do at this moment: it was not you they were hurting, not you at all. You, your mind, your knowledge of self, were in another part of the burrow entirely, watching these painful things being done to someone else.  The pin sank into his chest for a little distance, paused, came out. It probed here, probed there; finally it found a nerve in his upper arm. There, guided by the knowledge of the Sickness-Healer, it bit and clawed at the delicate area until Eric felt he would grind his teeth to powder in the effort not to cry out. His clenched fists twisted agonizingly at the ends of his arms in a paroxysm of protest, but he kept his body still. He didn't cry out; he didn't move away; he didn't raise a hand to protect himself.  Sarah the Sickness-Healer stepped back and considered him. \"There is no man here yet,\" she said grudgingly. \"But perhaps there is the beginnings of one.\"  He could relax. The physical test was over. There would be another one, much later, after he had completed his theft successfully; but that would be exclusively by men as part of his proud initiation ceremony. Under the circumstances, he knew he would be able to go through it almost gaily.  Meanwhile, the women's physical test was over. That was the important thing for now. In sheer reaction, his body gushed forth sweat which slid over the bloody cracks in his skin and stung viciously. He felt the water pouring down his back and forced himself not to go limp, prodded his mind into alertness.  \"Did that hurt?\" he was being asked by Rita, the old crone of a Record-Keeper. There was a solicitous smile on her forty-year-old face, but he knew it was a fake. A woman as old as that no longer felt sorry for anybody. She had too many aches and pains and things generally wrong with her to worry about other people's troubles.  \"A little,\" he said. \"Not much.\"  \"The Monsters will hurt you much more if they catch you stealing from them, do you know that? They will hurt you much more than we ever could.\"  \"I know. But the stealing is more important than the risk I'm taking. The stealing is the most important thing a man can do.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Rita the Record-Keeper nodded. \"Because you steal things Mankind needs in order to live. You steal things that the Female Society can make into food, clothing and weapons for Mankind, so that Mankind can live and flourish.\"  He saw the way, saw what was expected of him. \"No,\" he contradicted her. \"That's not why we steal. We live on what we steal, but we do not steal just to go on living.\"  \"Why?\" she asked blandly, as if she didn't know the answer better than any other member of the tribe. \"Why do we steal? What is more important than survival?\"  Here it was now. The catechism.  \"_To hit back at the Monsters_,\" he began. \"_To drive them from the planet, if we can. Regain Earth for Mankind, if we can. But, above all, hit back at the Monsters...._\"  He ploughed through the long verbal ritual, pausing at the end of each part, so that the Record-Keeper could ask the proper question and initiate the next sequence.  She tried to trip him once. She reversed the order of the fifth and sixth questions. Instead of \"_What will we do with the Monsters when we have regained the Earth from them?_\" she asked, \"_Why can't we use the Monsters' own Alien-Science to fight the Monsters?_\"  Carried along by mental habit, Eric was well into the passage beginning \"_We will"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/51122"],["title","The Men in the Walls (#3)"],["body","them as our ancestors kept all strange animals, in a place called a zoo, or we will drive them into our burrows and force them to live as we have lived_,\" before he realized the switch and stopped in confusion. Then he got a grip on himself, sought the right answer in his memory with calmness, as his uncle's wives had schooled him to do, and began again.  \"_There are three reasons why we cannot ever use Alien-Science_,\" he recited, holding up his hand with the thumb and little finger closed. \"_Alien-Science is non-human, Alien-Science is inhuman, Alien-Science is anti-human. First, since it is non-human_,\" he closed his forefinger, \"_we cannot use it because we can never understand it. And because it is inhuman, we would never want to use it even if we could understand it. And because it is anti-human and can only be used to hurt and damage Mankind, we would not be able to use it so long as we remain human ourselves. Alien-Science is the opposite of Ancestor-Science in every way, ugly instead of beautiful, hurtful instead of helpful. When we die, Alien-Science would not bring us to the world of our ancestors, but to another world full of Monsters._\"         *       *       *       *       *  All in all, it went very well, despite the trap into which he had almost fallen.  But he couldn't help remembering the conversation with his uncle in the other burrow. As his mouth reeled off the familiar words and concepts, his mind kept wondering how the two fitted together. His uncle was Alien-Science, and, according to his uncle, so had been his parents. Did that make them non-human, inhuman, anti-human?  And what did it make him? He knew his religious duty well: he should at this moment be telling all Mankind about his uncle's horrible secret.  The whole subject was far too complicated for someone with his limited experience.  When he had completed the lengthy catechism, Rita the Record-Keeper said: \"And this is what you say about the science of our ancestors. Now we will find out what the science of our ancestors says about you.\"  She signaled over her shoulder, without turning her head, and two young girls--female apprentices--pulled forward the large record machine which was the very center of the tribe's religious life. They stepped back, both smiling shyly and encouragingly at Eric the Only.  He knew the smiles meant little more than simple best wishes from apprentices of one sex to apprentices of the other, but even that was quite a bit at the moment. It meant that he was much closer to full status than they. It meant that, in the opinion of unprejudiced, disinterested observers, his examination was proceeding very well indeed.  _Singleton_, he thought fiercely to himself. _I'll show them what a singleton can do!_  Rita the Record-Keeper turned a knob at the top of the squat machine and it began to hum. She flung her arms up, quiveringly apart, and all, warriors, women, children, apprentices, even the chief himself, all bowed their heads.  \"Harken to the words of our ancestors,\" she chanted. \"Watch closely the spectacle of their great achievements. When their end was upon them, and they knew that only we, their descendants, might regain the Earth they had lost, they made this machine for the future generations of Mankind as a guide to the science that once had been and must be again.\"  The old woman lowered her arms. Simultaneously, heads went up all over the burrow and stared expectantly at the wall opposite the record machine, waiting for the magic message.  \"Eric the Only,\" Rita called, spinning the dial on the left of the machine with one hand and stabbing at it randomly with the forefinger of the other. \"This is the sequence in the science of our ancestors that speaks for you alone. This is the appointed vision under which you will live and die.\"         *       *       *       *       *  He stared at the wall, breathing hard. Now he would find out what his life was to be about--_now_! His uncle's vision at this moment, years ago, had suggested the nickname he came to bear: the Trap-Smasher. At the last initiation ceremony, a youth had called forth a sequence in which two enormous airborne vehicles of the ancestors had collided.  They'd tried to cheer the boy up, but he'd known his fate was upon him. Sure enough, he had been caught by a monster in the middle of his Theft and dashed to pieces against a wall.  Even then, Eric decided, he'd rather have that kind of a sequence than the awful emptiness of a _blank_ vision. When, every once in a while, the machine went on and showed nothing but a blinding white rectangle, the whole tribe knew that the youth being examined had no possibility of manhood in him at all. And the machine was never wrong. A boy who'd drawn a blank vision inevitably became more and more effeminate as he grew older without ever going out on his Theft. He tended to shun the company of warriors and to ask the women for minor tasks to perform. The machine of the ancestors looked at a boy and told exactly what he was and what he would become.  It had been great, that science which had produced this machine, no doubt about it. There was a power source in it which was self-contained, and which was supposed to be like the power behind all things. It would run almost forever, if the machine were not tampered with--although who could dream of tampering with it? In its visions were locked, not only the secrets of every individual human being, but enormous mysteries which the whole of Mankind had to solve before it could work out its salvation through the rituals and powers of the ancestral science.  Now, however, there was only one small part of Mankind that concerned Eric. Himself. His future. He waited, growing more and more tense as the power hum from the machine increased in pitch. And suddenly there was a grunt of awe from the entire burrow of people as a vision was thrown upon the wall.  He hadn't drawn a blank. That was the most important thing. He had been given an authentic ancestral vision.  \"Scattergood's does it again!\" a voice blared, as the picture projected on the wall showed people coming from all directions, wearing the strange body wrappings of the ancestors. They rushed, men, women, children, from the four corners of the glittering screen to some strange structure in the center and disappeared into its entrance. More and more poured in, more and more kept materializing at the edges and scrambling toward the structure in the center.  \"Scattergood's does it again!\" the vision yelled out at them. \"The sale of sales! The value of values! Only at Scattergood's three stores tomorrow. Binoculars, tape recorders, cameras, all at tremendous reductions, many below cost. Value, value, value!\"  Now the vision showed only objects. Strange, unfamiliar objects such as the ancestors used. And as each object appeared, the voice recited a charm over it. Powerful and ancient magic this, the forgotten lore of Ancestor-Science.  \"Krafft-Yahrmann Exposure Meters, the best there is, you've heard about them and now you can buy them, the light meter that's an eye-opener, a price to fit every pocketbook, eight dollars and ninety-five cents, tomorrow at Scattergood's, absolutely only one to a customer.  \"Kyoto Automatic Eight-Millimeter Movie Cameras with an f 1.4 lens and an electric eye that does all the focusing and gives you a perfect exposure every single time. As low as three dollars a week. The supply is limited, so hurry, hurry, hurry!\"         *       *       *       *       *  Eric watched the sequence unfold, his hands squeezing each other, his eyes almost distended in reverence and concentration. This was the clue to his life, to what he might become. This was the sequence that the record machine of the ancestors, turned on at random, had vouchsafed as a prophecy of his future.  All knowledge was in that machine--and no possibility of error.  But Eric was getting worried. The vision was so strange. Sometimes there would be a vision that baffled even the wisest women. And that meant the youth who had called it forth would always be a puzzle, to himself and all of Mankind.  Let it not happen to him! O ancestors, O science, O record machine, let it not happen to him!  Let him only have a clear and definite vision so that his personality could be clear and definite for the rest of his life!  \"Our special imported high-power precision binoculars,\" the voice roared on as a man appeared in the vision and brought one of the strange objects up to his eyes. \"If we told you the manufacturer's name, you'd recognize it immediately. 7 x 50, only fourteen dollars and ninety-five cents, _with case_. 10 x 50, only fifteen dollars and ninety-five cents, _with case_. You see further, you see clearer, you pay less. You always pay less at Scattergood's. Rock-bottom prices! Skyscraper values! Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, at Scattergood's annual week-after-Hallowe'en Sale!\"  There was a click as the vision went off abruptly to be replaced by a white rectangle on the wall of the burrow. Eric realized that this was all the clue there was to be to his life. What did it mean? Could it be interpreted?  Anxiously, now, he turned to Ottilie, the Chieftain's First Wife. He turned to her as everyone else in Mankind was now turning, Sarah the Sickness-Healer and Rita the Record-Keeper amongst them.  Only Ottilie could read a vision, only short, squat, imperious Ottilie. The Chieftain's First Wife was her title of honor and her latest title, but long before she had acquired that, long before even she had become Head of the Female Society, she had been Ottilie the Augur, Ottilie the Omen-Teller, Ottilie who could walk in her mind from the homey burrow of the present into the dark, labyrinthine corridors of the future, Ottilie who could read signs, Ottilie who could announce portents.         *       *       *       *       *  It was as Ottilie the Augur that she could pick out the one new-born babe in a litter of three"]]]
