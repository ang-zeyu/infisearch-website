Ye'd believe he'd sind wurrud down to his agent f'r to secure forty feet iv Evansville be moonlight an' be con-tint.  But he don't.  \"Ye don't catch Higbie changin' iv anny iv his dividends on domestic finished art.  He jumps on a boat an' goes sthraight acrost to th' centhral deepo.  The first thing he gets is a porthrait iv himsilf be wan iv th' gr-reat modhren masthers, Sargent be name.  This here Sargent, Hogan tells me, used to live in this counthry, an' faith, if he'd stayed here ye might see him to-day on a stagin'.  But he had a mind in his head an' he tore off f'r Europe th' way a duck hunter goes f'r a rice swamp.  Afther awhile, Higbie shows up, an' says he: 'I'm Higbie iv th' Non-Adhesive Consolidated Glue Company,' he says.  'Can ye do me?' 'I can an' will,' says Sargent.  'I'll do ye good.  How much have ye got?' he says.  'Get some more an' come around,' he says.  An' Higbie puts on his Prince Albert coat an' laves it open so that ye can see his watch charm--th' crown iv Poland with th' Kohinoor in th' top iv it--an' me frind Sargent does him brown an' red.  He don't give him th' pitcher iv coorse.  If ye have ye'er porthrait painted be a gr-reat painther, it's ye'er porthrait but 'tis his pitcher, an' he keeps it till ye don't look that way anny more.  So Higbie's porthrait is hung up in a gallery an' th' doctors brings people to see it that ar-re sufferin' fr'm narvous dyspepsia to cheer thim up.  Th' pa-apers says 'tis fine.  'Number 108 shows Sargent at his best.  There is the same marvellous ticknick that th' great master displayed in his cillybrated take-off on Mrs. Maenheimer in last year's gallery.  Th' skill an' ease with which th' painther has made a monkey iv his victim are beyond praise.  Sargent has torn th' sordid heart out iv th' wretched crather an' exposed it to th' wurruld.  Th' wicked, ugly little eyes, th' crooked nose, th' huge graspin' hands, tell th' story iv this miscreant's character as completely as if they were written in so manny wurruds, while th' artist, with wondherful malice, has painted onto th' face a smile iv sickenin' silf-complacency that is positively disgustin'.  No artist iv our day has succeeded so well in showin' up th' maneness iv th' people he has mugged.  We ondershtand that th' atrocious Higbie paid wan hundherd thousan' dollars f'r this comic valentine.  It is worth th' money to ivrybody but him.'  \"But Higbie don't see th' pa-aper.  He's over in Paris.  Th' chimes are rung, bonefires are lighted in th' sthreets an' th' Pannyma Comp'ny declares a dividend whin he enters th' city.  They'se such a demand f'r paint that th' supply runs out an' manny gr-reat imprishonist pitcher facthries is foorced to use bluein'.  Higbie ordhers paintin's be th' ton, th' r-runnin' foot, th' foot pound, th' car load.  He insthructs th' pitcher facthries to wurruk night an' day till his artistic sowl is satisfied.  We follow his coorse in th' pa-apers.  'Th' cillybrated Gainsborough that niver wud be missed has been captured be Misther Higbie, th' American millyionaire. Th' price paid is said to be wan hundherd thousan' dollars.  Th' pitcher riprisints a lady in a large hat fondlin' a cow.  It is wan iv th' finest Gainsboroughs painted be th' Gainsborough Mannyfacthrin' comp'ny iv Manchester.  At th' las' public sale, it was sold f'r thirty dollars.  Misther Higbie has also purchased th' cillybrated Schmartzmeister Boogooroo, wan iv th' mos' horrible examples iv this delightful painther's style.  He is now negotyatin' with th' well-known dealer Moosoo Mortheimer f'r th' intire output iv th' Barabazah School.  Yisterdah in a call on th' janial dealer, th' name iv th' cillybrated painther Mooney was mintioned.  \"How manny pitchers has he painted?\" \"Four hundherd and forty-three thousan' at ilivin o'clock to-day,\" says th' dealer.  \"But four hundherd thousan' iv thim ar-re in America.\" \"Get th' r-rest iv thim f'r me,\" says th' connysoor.  \"What did ye say th' gintleman's name was?\" We ondershtand that Misther Mooney has had to put in two new four-deck machines to meet th' ordhers, which include thirty green an' mauve haystacks, forty blue barns or childher at play, an' no less thin ninety riprisintations iv mornin' at sea, moonlight avenin', flock iv sheep, or whativer ye may call thim.'  \"An' whin he comes home, he hangs thim in his house, so that his frinds can't turn around without takin' off a pasthral scene on their coats, an' he pastes th' price on th' frame, an' whin he dies, he laves his pitcher to some definceless art museem.  An' there ye ar-re.  \"So I tell ye, Hinnissy, if I was a young an' ambitious American painther, I'd go to Europe.  Whin Hannigan was over there, he met a young man that painted that fine head iv Murphy that looks so much like Casey that hangs in Schwartzmeister's back room.  'Ar-re ye still at th' art?' says Hannigan.  'I am,' says th' young man. 'How does it go?' asks Hannigan.  'I've more thin I can do,' says th' young man.  'Since steel rails got so high, I've had to hire an assistant.  Ye see, I didn't get on in Chicago.  Me \"Bridgepoort in a Fog\" was th' on'y pitcher I sold, an' a sausage mannyfacthrer bought that because his facthry was in it.  I come over here, an' so's me pitchers will have a fair show, I sign annywan's name ye want to thim.  Ye've heerd iv Michael Angelo? That's me.  Ye've heerd iv Gainsborough? That's me.  Ye've heerd iv Millet, th' boy that painted th' pitcher give away with th' colored supplimint iv th' Sundah Howl? That's me.  Yis, sir, th' rale name iv near ivry distinguished painther iv modhren times is Remsen K. Smith.  Whin ye go home, if ye see a good painther an' glazier that'd like a job as assistant Rimbrandt f'r th' American thrade, sind him to me.  F'r,' he says, 'th' on'y place an American artist can make a livin' is here.  Charity f'r artists,' he says, 'begins abroad,' he says.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Hennessy, \"perhaps a bum Europeen pitcher is betther thin a good American pitcher.\"  \"Perhaps so,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"I think it is so.  Annyhow, no matther how bad a painther he is, annywan that can get money out iv an American millyionaire is an artist an' desarves it.  There's th' rale art.  I wish it was taught in th' schools.  I'd like to see an exhibition at th' Museem with 'Check iv American Gintleman, dhrawn fr'm life,' hung on th' wall.\"     Immigration   \"Well, I see Congress has got to wurruk again,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"The Lord save us fr'm harm,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"Yes, sir,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"Congress has got to wurruk again, an' manny things that seems important to a Congressman 'll be brought up befure thim.  'Tis sthrange that what's a big thing to a man in Wash'nton, Hinnissy, don't seem much account to me. Divvle a bit do I care whether they dig th' Nicaragoon Canal or cross th' Isthmus in a balloon; or whether th' Monroe docthrine is enfoorced or whether it ain't; or whether th' thrusts is abolished as Teddy Rosenfelt wud like to have thim or encouraged to go on with their neefaryous but magnificent entherprises as th' Prisidint wud like; or whether th' water is poured into th' ditches to reclaim th' arid lands iv th' West or th' money f'r thim to fertilize th' arid pocket-books iv th' conthractors; or whether th' Injun is threated like a depindant an' miserable thribesman or like a free an' indepindant dog; or whether we restore th' merchant marine to th' ocean or whether we lave it to restore itsilf.  None iv these here questions inthrests me, an' be me I mane you an' be you I mane ivrybody.  What we want to know is, ar-re we goin' to have coal enough in th' hod whin th' cold snap comes; will th' plumbin' hold out, an' will th' job last.  \"But they'se wan question that Congress is goin' to take up that you an' me are intherested in.  As a pilgrim father that missed th' first boats, I must raise me claryon voice again' th' invasion iv this fair land be th' paupers an' arnychists iv effete Europe. Ye bet I must--because I'm here first.  'Twas diff'rent whin I was dashed high on th' stern an' rockbound coast.  In thim days America was th' refuge iv th' oppressed iv all th' wurruld.  They cud come over here an' do a good job iv oppressin' thimsilves. As I told ye I come a little late.  Th' Rosenfelts an' th' Lodges bate me be at laste a boat lenth, an' be th' time I got here they was stern an' rockbound thimsilves.  So I got a gloryous rayciption as soon as I was towed off th' rocks.  Th' stars an' sthripes whispered a welcome in th' breeze an' a shovel was thrust into me hand an' I was pushed into a sthreet excyvatin' as though I'd been born here.  Th' pilgrim father who bossed th' job was a fine ol' puritan be th' name iv Doherty, who come over in th' Mayflower about th' time iv th' potato rot in Wexford, an' he made me think they was a hole in th' breakwather iv th' haven iv refuge an' some iv th' wash iv th' seas iv opprission had got through.  He was a stern an' rockbound la-ad himsilf, but I was a good hand at loose stones an' wan day--but I'll tell ye about that another time.  \"Annyhow, I was rayceived with open arms that sometimes ended in a clinch.  I was afraid I wasn't goin' to assimilate with th' airlyer pilgrim fathers an' th' instichoochions iv th' counthry, but I soon found that a long swing iv th' pick made me as good as another man an' it didn't require a gr-reat intellect, or sometimes anny at all, to vote th' dimmycrat ticket, an' befure I was here a month, I felt enough like a native born American to burn a witch.  Wanst in a while a mob iv intilligint collajeens, whose grandfathers had bate me to th' dock, wud take a shy at me Pathrick's Day procission or burn down wan iv me churches, but they got tired iv that befure long; 'twas too much like wurruk.  \"But as I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4729"],["title","Observations By Mr. Dooley (#5)"],["body","ye, Hinnissy, 'tis diff'rent now.  I don't know why 'tis diff'rent but 'tis diff'rent.  'Tis time we put our back again' th' open dure an' keep out th' savage horde.  If that cousin iv ye'ers expects to cross, he'd betther tear f'r th' ship.  In a few minyits th' gates 'll be down an' whin th' oppressed wurruld comes hikin' acrost to th' haven iv refuge, they'll do well to put a couplin' pin undher their hats, f'r th' Goddess iv Liberty 'll meet thim at th' dock with an axe in her hand.  Congress is goin' to fix it.  Me frind Shaughnessy says so.  He was in yisterdah an' says he: ''Tis time we done something to make th' immigration laws sthronger,' says he.  'Thrue f'r ye, Miles Standish,' says I; 'but what wud ye do?' 'I'd keep out th' offscourin's iv Europe,' says he.  'Wud ye go back?' says I.  'Have ye'er joke,' says he.  ''Tis not so seeryus as it was befure ye come,' says I.  'But what ar-re th' immygrants doin' that's roonous to us?' I says.  'Well,' says he, 'they're arnychists,' he says; 'they don't assymilate with th' counthry,' he says.  'Maybe th' counthry's digestion has gone wrong fr'm too much rich food,' says I; 'perhaps now if we'd lave off thryin' to digest Rockyfellar an' thry a simple diet like Schwartzmeister, we wudden't feel th' effects iv our vittels,' I says.  'Maybe if we'd season th' immygrants a little or cook thim thurly, they'd go down betther,' I says.  \"'They're arnychists, like Parsons,' he says.  'He wud've been an immygrant if Texas hadn't been admitted to th' Union,' I says. 'Or Snolgosh,' he says.  'Has Mitchigan seceded?' I says.  'Or Gittoo,' he says.  'Who come fr'm th' effete monarchies iv Chicago, west iv Ashland Av'noo,' I says.  'Or what's-his-name, Wilkes Booth,' he says.  'I don't know what he was--maybe a Boolgharyen,' says I.  'Well, annyhow,' says he, 'they're th' scum iv th' earth.' 'They may be that,' says I; 'but we used to think they was th' cream iv civilization,' I says.  'They're off th' top annyhow.  I wanst believed 'twas th' best men iv Europe come here, th' la-ads that was too sthrong and indepindant to be kicked around be a boorgomasther at home an' wanted to dig out f'r a place where they cud get a chanst to make their way to th' money.  I see their sons fightin' into politics an' their daughters tachin' young American idee how to shoot too high in th' public school, an' I thought they was all right.  But I see I was wrong.  Thim boys out there towin' wan heavy foot afther th' other to th' rowlin' mills is all arnychists.  There's warrants out f'r all names endin' in 'inski, an' I think I'll board up me windows, f'r,' I says, 'if immygrants is as dangerous to this counthry as ye an' I an' other pilgrim fathers believe they are, they'se enough iv thim sneaked in already to make us aborigines about as infloointial as the prohibition vote in th' Twinty-ninth Ward.  They'll dash again' our stern an' rock-bound coast till they bust it,' says I.  \"'But I ain't so much afraid as ye ar-re.  I'm not afraid iv me father an' I'm not afraid iv mesilf.  An' I'm not afraid iv Schwartzmeister's father or Hinnery Cabin Lodge's grandfather. We all come over th' same way, an' if me ancestors were not what Hogan calls rigicides, 'twas not because they were not ready an' willin', on'y a king niver come their way.  I don't believe in killin' kings, mesilf.  I niver wud've sawed th' block off that curly-headed potintate that I see in th' pitchers down town, but, be hivins, Presarved Codfish Shaughnessy, if we'd begun a few years ago shuttin' out folks that wudden't mind handin' a bomb to a king, they wudden't be enough people in Mattsachoosetts to make a quorum f'r th' Anti-Impeeryal S'ciety,' says I.  'But what wud ye do with th' offscourin' iv Europe?' says he.  'I'd scour thim some more,' says I.  \"An' so th' meetin' iv th' Plymouth Rock Assocyation come to an end.  But if ye wud like to get it together, Deacon Hinnissy, to discuss th' immygration question, I'll sind out a hurry call f'r Schwartzmeister an' Mulcahey an' Ignacio Sbarbaro an' Nels Larsen an' Petrus Gooldvink, an' we 'll gather to-night at Fanneilnoviski Hall at th' corner iv Sheridan an' Sigel sthreets.  All th' pilgrim fathers is rayquested f'r to bring interpreters.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Hennessy, \"divvle th' bit I care, on'y I'm here first, an' I ought to have th' right to keep th' bus fr'm bein' overcrowded.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"as a pilgrim father on me gran' nephew's side, I don't know but ye're right.  An' they'se wan sure way to keep thim out.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Mr. Hennessy.  \"Teach thim all about our instichoochions befure they come,\" said Mr. Dooley.     White House Discipline   \"Where did ye spind th' New Year's?\" asked Mr. Dooley.  \"I didn't go to th' White House rayciption,\" said Mr. Hennessy, pleasantly.  \"I see ye didn't,\" said Mr. Doolcy.  \"Ye'er ar-rm is not in a sling.  Man an' boy, Hinnissy, I've taken manny a chanst on me life, but I'd as lave think iv declarin' th' sintimints iv me heart in an Orange meetin' as dhroppin' in f'r a socyal call at what Hogan calls th' ixicutive mansion.  That is, if I was a govermint emplyee, which I ain't, havin' been born wrong.  \"Th' time was whin a man lost his job an' his heart to th' prisidint at th' same time.  A reproof was administhered to him with chloryform. He woke up an' rubbed his eyes an' says, 'Where am I?' an' th' polisman says: 'Ye're in an ash bar'l.' He come fr'm th' White House with tears in his eyes an' was tol' he was out iv wurruk. But, Hinnissy, th' prisint occypant iv th' White House is a heartier person.  A reproof fr'm him is th' same thing as a compound fracture. A wurrud iv caution will lay a man up f'r a week an' a severe riprimand will sind him through life with a wooden leg.  \"There was me frind, Gin'ral Miles.  No more gallant sojer iver dhrew his soord to cut out a patthern f'r a coat thin Gin'ral Miles. He's hunted th' Apachy, th' Sioux, th' Arapahoo, th' Comanchee, th' Congressman an' other savages iv th' plain; he's faced death an' promotion in ivry form, an' no harm come to him till he wint up th' White House stairs or maybe 'twas till he come down.  Annyhow, Gin'ral Miles was pursooin' th' thrue coorse iv a nachral warryor an' enlightenin' th' wurruld on th' things he happened to think iv.  'Tis what is ixpicted iv him.  If ye don't read him ye don't know what's goin' on in th' wurruld.  Ivry Sundah I pick up me pa-aper an' hurry through th' articles on what's a suitable Christmas gift f'r th' hired girl who'll pizen th' soup if she gets three yards iv calico, be Winnyfield Scott Schley, an' what ought to be done f'r th' Chinee, be Cap. Mahan, an' get down to what Gin'ral Miles thinks.  'Tis always good an' full iv meaty advice.  'Is Mars inhabited?' 'Th' future iv th' Columbya river salmon,' 'Is white lead good f'r th' complexion?' 'What wud I do if I had a millyion dollars an' it was so,' 'England's supreemacy in Cochin China,' 'Pink gaiters as a necissity iv warfare,' 'Is th' Impire shouldhers goin' out?' 'Waist measurements iv warriors I have met,' an' so on.  Gin'ral Miles is th' on'y in-an'-out, up an' down, catch-as-catch-can, white, red or black, with or without, journylist we have left.  On anny subject fr'm stove polish to sun worship, I'd take th' wurrud iv me frind Gin'ral Miles befure th' man that made th' goods.  \"'Twas that got him into throuble.  Wan day afther inspictin' th' army, Gin'ral Miles give a chat to wan iv his fav'rite journals on what he thought about th' navy, him bein' a great authority on navy affairs befure steam come in.  I don't know what th' divvle he said an' I don't care, f'r me mind was made up long ago, an' ivrybody that don't agree with me is little betther thin a thraitor or a cow'rd.  But annyhow he give his opinyion, an' afther givin' it he took his bonnet out, had a goold beater in to fix up th' epylets, got th' ilicthric lights goin' in th' buttons, found th' right pair iv blue an' pink pants, pulled on th' shoes with th' silver bells, harnessed to his manly hips th' soord with the forget-me-nots on th' handle an' pranced over to th' White House. As he wint up th' hall, he noticed an atmosphere iv what Hogan calls cold hatoor, f'r wan iv th' durekeepers said th' prisidint wasn't home an' another lightly kicked him as he passed, but like a sojer he wint on to th' East room where Mr. Rosenfelt, th' pa-apers tells me, shtud in front iv th' fireplace, nervously pluckin' Sicrety Gage be th' beard.  'I've come,' says Gin'ral Miles, 'to pay me rayspicts to th' head iv th' naytion.' 'Thank ye,' says th' prisidint, 'I'll do th' same f'r th' head iv th' army,' he says, bouncin' a coal scuttle on th' vethran's helmet. 'Gin'ral, I don't like ye'er recent conduct,' he says, sindin' th' right to th' pint iv th' jaw.  'Ye've been in th' army forty year,' he says, pushin' his head into th' grate, 'an' ye shud know that an officer who criticizes his fellow officers, save in th' reg'lar way, that is to say in a round robin, is guilty iv I dinnaw what,' he says, feedin' him with his soord.  'I am foorced to administher ye a severe reproof,' he says.  'Is that what this is?' says Gin'ral Miles.  'It is,' says th' prisidint.  'I thought it was capital punishnmint,' says Gin'ral Miles as he wint out through th' window pursooed be a chandelier.  His nex' article will be entitled 'Hospital Sketches,' an' I undhershtand he's dictatin' a few remarks to his nurse on providin' atthractive suits iv steel plate f'r gin'rals in th' army.  \"Well, sir, they'll be gr-reat times down there f'r a few years. A movement is on foot f'r to establish an emergency hospital f'r office holders an' politicians acrost th' sthreet fr'm th' White House where they can be threated f'r infractions iv th' Civil Sarvice law followed be pers'nal injuries.  I'll be watchin' th' pa-apers ivry mornin'.  'Rayciption at th' White House.  Among th' casulties was so-an'-so.  Th' prisidint was in a happy mood.  He"]]]
