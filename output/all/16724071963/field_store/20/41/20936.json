She wept long and bitterly in the solitude of her chamber, and perhaps her wounded pride caused many of her tears to flow. But better thoughts came at last, and she took up the Bible which lay on the bed, and read a few passages. Then she prayed to God that he would be with Katy in the midst of the crowd, and guide her safely through the perils and temptations that would assail her. She tried to banish her foolish pride, when she considered her circumstances, she could almost believe it was a wicked pride; but when she endeavored to be reconciled to her lot, the thought of her father's fine house, and the servants that used to wait upon her, came up, and the struggle in her heart was very severe. In spite of all she had said to Katy about the disgrace of selling candy in the streets, she could not but be thankful that the poor girl had none of her foolish pride. She read in the New Testament about the lowly life which Jesus and the apostles led, and then asked herself what right she had to be proud. And thus she struggled through the long hours she remained alone--trying to be humble, trying to be good and true. Those who labor and struggle as hard as she did are always the better for it, even though they do not achieve a perfect triumph over the passions that torment them.  Katy blushed when she met the keeper of the grocery at the corner of the court, for in spite of all her fine talk about false pride, she had not entirely banished it from her heart. Some queer ideas came into her head as she thought what she was doing. What would her grandfather, the rich Liverpool merchant, say, should he meet her then? Of course he would not know her; he would be ashamed of her. But she did not permit such reflections as these to influence her; and as soon as she was conscious of the nature of her thoughts she banished them.  \"I'm going to support my mother, and I have no right to be proud. If I meet my grandfather, I should like to sell him twenty sticks of candy.\"  \"Hallo, Katy! What are you going to do?\" said a voice behind, which she recognized as that of her friend Tommy Howard.  \"I'm going to sell this candy,\" replied Katy.  \"You're a spunky one; mother told me all about it. I should like two sticks,\" said Tommy, as he offered her the money.  \"Take two, Tommy, and as many more as you like.\"  \"Two is all I want;\" and he placed the two cents on the tray.  \"No, Tommy, I won't take your money,\" replied Katy, with a blush, for she felt ashamed to take his money.  \"That's no way to trade,\" laughed Tommy. \"You won't make much, it you do so. Keep the money and I will keep the candy.\"  \"I can't keep it, Tommy.\"  \"You must; if you don't take the money, I won't take the candy.\"  \"I owe you two cents, Tommy. I will pay you now.\"  \"No, you don't!\"  \"Please to take them; I shall feel very bad, if you don't.\"  Tommy Howard looked her in the eye a moment; he saw a tear there. Her pride was wounded, and he took the two cents from the tray, for he did not wish to give her pain.  \"Now, we are square, Tommy,\" said Katy, as her face brightened up again.  \"Yes, we are, but I don't like it pretty well. One of these days, when you get out of this scrape, I will let you give me as much candy as you have a mind to.\"  This was very obliging of Tommy; and when Katy understood his motive, she was sorry she had not permitted him to pay for the candy, for she saw that he did not feel just right about the transaction. It was not exactly mercantile, but then the heart comes before commerce. As she walked along, she could not help thinking that her natural generosity might seriously interfere with the profits of her enterprise. She had a great many friends; and it became a knotty question for her to decide whether, if she met any of her school companions, she should give each of them a stick of candy. She would like to do so very much indeed; but it was certain she could not afford to pursue such a liberal policy. It was a hard question, and, hoping she should not meet any of her schoolmates, she determined to refer it to her mother for settlement.  When she got into Washington Street, she felt that the time for action had come. Now was the time to sell candy; and yet she did not feel like asking folks to buy her wares. The night before, as she lay thinking about her business, it had all seemed very easy to her; but now it was quite a different thing. No one seemed to take any notice of her, or to feel the least interest in the great mission she had undertaken. But Katy was aware that it requires some effort in these days to sell goods, and she must work; she must ask people to buy her candy.  There was a nice-looking gentleman, with a good-natured face, coming down the street, and she resolved to make a beginning with him. He couldn't say much more than no to her, and she placed herself in a position to accost him. But when he came near enough, her courage all oozed out, and she let him pass without speaking to him.  \"What a fool I am!\" exclaimed she to herself when he had passed. \"I shall never do anything in this way. There comes another gentleman who looks as though he had a sweet tooth; at any rate, he seems as good-natured as a pound of sugar. I will certainly try him.\"  Her heart pounded against her ribs as though it had been worked by a forty-horse engine--poor girl. It was a great undertaking to her; quite as great as taking a six-story granite warehouse, piling it full of merchandise from cellar to attic, and announcing himself as ready for business, to a child of a larger growth. Everything seemed to hang on the issues of that tremendous moment.  \"Buy some candy?\" said she, in tremulous tones, her great, swelling heart almost choking her utterance.  \"No, child. I don't want any,\" replied the gentleman, kindly, as he glanced at the tray on which the candy had been so invitingly spread.  \"It is very nice,\" stammered Katy; \"and perhaps your children at home would like some, if you do not.\"  Bravo, Katy! That was very well done, though the gentleman was an old bachelor, and could not appreciate the full force of your argument.  \"Are you sure it is very nice?\" asked the gentleman, with a benevolent smile, when he had laughed heartily at Katy's jumping conclusion.  \"I know it is,\" replied the little candy merchant, very positively.  \"Then you may give me six sticks;\" and he threw a fourpence on her tray.  Six sticks! Katy was astonished at the magnitude of her first commercial transaction. Visions of wealth, a fine house, and silk dresses for her mother and herself, danced through her excited brain, and she thought that her grandfather, the great Liverpool merchant, would not have been ashamed of her if he had been present to witness that magnificent operation.  \"Have you any paper to wrap it up in?\" asked the gentleman.  Here was an emergency for which Katy had not provided. Her grandest expectations had not extended beyond the sale of one stick at a time, and she was not prepared for such a rush of trade. However, she tore off a piece from one of the white sheets at the bottom of the tray, wrapped up the six sticks as nicely as she could, and handed them to the gentleman, who then left her to find another customer.  Katy, elated by her first success, ran home as fast as she could to procure some more white paper, of which she had a dozen sheets that had been given her by a friend. It was in the back room, so that she did not disturb her mother, choosing to astonish her with the whole story of her success at noon.    CHAPTER VIII.  KATY SELLS OUT AND VISITS THE MAYOR.  Katy reached Washington Street once more. She had lost all her timidity, and would not have feared to accost the governor, if she had met him, and request him to purchase a cent's worth of molasses candy.  \"Buy some candy?\" said she to the first person who passed near her.  \"No!\" was the prompt and emphatic answer of the gentleman addressed.  \"It is very nice,\" suggested Katy.  \"Get out of my may,\" growled the gentleman, and the little candy merchant deemed it prudent to heed the command.  She was nettled by this rude reception, and would have been disposed to resent it, if there had been any way for her to do so. She had not yet learned to bear up against the misfortunes of trade, and her eye followed the sour gentleman far down the street. Why should he treat her in such a rude and unkind manner? What would he say if she should tell him that her grandfather was a great Liverpool merchant, lived in a big house, and had lots of servants to wait upon him? She was as good as he was, any day.  \"Give me a stick of candy,\" said a nice little girl with a silk dress on, whom a lady was holding by the hand, at the same time placing a cent on her tray.  Katy started at the words, and reproved herself for her want of meekness. She might, perhaps, have sold half a dozen sticks of candy while she had been watching the sour gentleman, and persuading herself that she had been very badly used. She tore off a piece of paper, in which she wrapped up the candy for the purchaser, and handed it to her.  \"Thank you,\" said she, as she picked up the copper, and transferred it to her pocket.  \"Your candy looks very nice,\" added the lady evidently pleased with Katy's polite manners.  \"It is very nice, ma'am.\"  \"Have you sold much to-day?\"  \"No, ma'am; I have but just come out.\"  \"It looks so good, I will take half a dozen sticks for the children at home.\"  \"Thank you, ma'am; you are very kind,\" replied Katy; and her nimble fingers had soon made a nice little parcel for the lady, who gave her a fourpence.  Here was another avalanche of good fortune, and the little candy merchant could hardly believe her senses. At this rate she would soon become a wholesale dealer in the article.  \"Buy some candy?\" said she, addressing the next person she met.  \"No.\"  \"Buy some candy?\" she continued, turning to the next.  \"No.\"  And so she went from one to another, and no one seemed to have the least"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/485"],["title","The Road to Oz (#0)"],["body","Road to Oz     In which is related how Dorothy Gale of Kansas,    The Shaggy Man, Button Bright, and Polychrome          the Rainbow's Daughter met on an            Enchanted Road and followed               it all the way to the                   Marvelous Land                       of Oz.   by  L.

Toto is in this story, because you wanted him to be there, and many other characters which you will recognize are in the story, too.  Indeed, the wishes of my little correspondents have been considered as carefully as possible, and if the story is not exactly as you would have written it yourselves, you must remember that a story has to be a story before it can be written down, and the writer cannot change it much without spoiling it.  In the preface to \"Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz\" I said I would like to write some stories that were not \"Oz\" stories, because I thought I had written about Oz long enough; but since that volume was published I have been fairly deluged with letters from children imploring me to \"write more about Dorothy,\" and \"more about Oz,\" and since I write only to please the children I shall try to respect their wishes.  There are some new characters in this book that ought to win your love. I'm very fond of the shaggy man myself, and I think you will like him, too.  As for Polychrome--the Rainbow's Daughter--and stupid little Button-Bright, they seem to have brought a new element of fun into these Oz stories, and I am glad I discovered them.  Yet I am anxious to have you write and tell me how you like them.  Since this book was written I have received some very remarkable News from The Land of Oz, which has greatly astonished me.  I believe it will astonish you, too, my dears, when you hear it.  But it is such a long and exciting story that it must be saved for another book--and perhaps that book will be the last story that will ever be told about the Land of Oz.  L. FRANK BAUM  Coronado, 1909.     1.  The Way to Butterfield   \"Please, miss,\" said the shaggy man, \"can you tell me the road to Butterfield?\"  Dorothy looked him over.  Yes, he was shaggy, all right, but there was a twinkle in his eye that seemed pleasant.  \"Oh yes,\" she replied; \"I can tell you.  But it isn't this road at all.\"  \"No?\"  \"You cross the ten-acre lot, follow the lane to the highway, go north to the five branches, and take--let me see--\"  \"To be sure, miss; see as far as Butterfield, if you like,\" said the shaggy man.  \"You take the branch next the willow stump, I b'lieve; or else the branch by the gopher holes; or else--\"  \"Won't any of 'em do, miss?\"  \"'Course not, Shaggy Man.  You must take the right road to get to Butterfield.\"  \"And is that the one by the gopher stump, or--\"  \"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy.  \"I shall have to show you the way, you're so stupid.  Wait a minute till I run in the house and get my sunbonnet.\"  The shaggy man waited.  He had an oat-straw in his mouth, which he chewed slowly as if it tasted good; but it didn't.  There was an apple-tree beside the house, and some apples had fallen to the ground. The shaggy man thought they would taste better than the oat-straw, so he walked over to get some.  A little black dog with bright brown eyes dashed out of the farm-house and ran madly toward the shaggy man, who had already picked up three apples and put them in one of the big wide pockets of his shaggy coat.  The little dog barked and made a dive for the shaggy man's leg; but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in his big pocket along with the apples.  He took more apples, afterward, for many were on the ground; and each one that he tossed into his pocket hit the little dog somewhere upon the head or back, and made him growl.  The little dog's name was Toto, and he was sorry he had been put in the shaggy man's pocket.  Pretty soon Dorothy came out of the house with her sunbonnet, and she called out:  \"Come on, Shaggy Man, if you want me to show you the road to Butterfield.\"  She climbed the fence into the ten-acre lot and he followed her, walking slowly and stumbling over the little hillocks in the pasture as if he was thinking of something else and did not notice them.  \"My, but you're clumsy!\" said the little girl.  \"Are your feet tired?\"  \"No, miss; it's my whiskers; they tire very easily in this warm weather,\" said he.  \"I wish it would snow, don't you?\"  \"'Course not, Shaggy Man,\" replied Dorothy, giving him a severe look. \"If it snowed in August it would spoil the corn and the oats and the wheat; and then Uncle Henry wouldn't have any crops; and that would make him poor; and--\"  \"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man.  \"It won't snow, I guess.  Is this the lane?\"  \"Yes,\" replied Dorothy, climbing another fence; \"I'll go as far as the highway with you.\"  \"Thankee, miss; you're very kind for your size, I'm sure,\" said he gratefully.  \"It isn't everyone who knows the road to Butterfield,\" Dorothy remarked as she tripped along the lane; \"but I've driven there many a time with Uncle Henry, and so I b'lieve I could find it blindfolded.\"  \"Don't do that, miss,\" said the shaggy man earnestly; \"you might make a mistake.\"  \"I won't,\" she answered, laughing.  \"Here's the highway.  Now it's the second--no, the third turn to the left--or else it's the fourth.  Let's see.  The first one is by the elm tree, and the second is by the gopher holes; and then--\"  \"Then what?\" he inquired, putting his hands in his coat pockets.  Toto grabbed a finger and bit it; the shaggy man took his hand out of that pocket quickly, and said \"Oh!\"  Dorothy did not notice.  She was shading her eyes from the sun with her arm, looking anxiously down the road.  \"Come on,\" she commanded.  \"It's only a little way farther, so I may as well show you.\"  After a while, they came to the place where five roads branched in different directions; Dorothy pointed to one, and said:  \"That's it, Shaggy Man.\"  \"I'm much obliged, miss,\" he said, and started along another road.  \"Not that one!\" she cried; \"you're going wrong.\"  He stopped.  \"I thought you said that other was the road to Butterfield,\" said he, running his fingers through his shaggy whiskers in a puzzled way.  \"So it is.\"  \"But I don't want to go to Butterfield, miss.\"  \"You don't?\"  \"Of course not.  I wanted you to show me the road, so I shouldn't go there by mistake.\"  \"Oh!  Where DO you want to go, then?\"  \"I'm not particular, miss.\"  This answer astonished the little girl; and it made her provoked, too, to think she had taken all this trouble for nothing.  \"There are a good many roads here,\" observed the shaggy man, turning slowly around, like a human windmill.  \"Seems to me a person could go 'most anywhere, from this place.\"  Dorothy turned around too, and gazed in surprise.  There WERE a good many roads; more than she had ever seen before.  She tried to count them, knowing there ought to be five, but when she had counted seventeen she grew bewildered and stopped, for the roads were as many as the spokes of a wheel and ran in every direction from the place where they stood; so if she kept on counting she was likely to count some of the roads twice.  \"Dear me!\" she exclaimed.  \"There used to be only five roads, highway and all.  And now--why, where's the highway, Shaggy Man?\"  \"Can't say, miss,\" he responded, sitting down upon the ground as if tired with standing.  \"Wasn't it here a minute ago?\"  \"I thought so,\" she answered, greatly perplexed.  \"And I saw the gopher holes, too, and the dead stump; but they're not here now.  These roads are all strange--and what a lot of them there are!  Where do you suppose they all go to?\"  \"Roads,\" observed the shaggy man, \"don't go anywhere.  They stay in one place, so folks can walk on them.\"  He put his hand in his side-pocket and drew out an apple--quick, before Toto could bite him again.  The little dog got his head out this time and said \"Bow-wow!\"  so loudly that it made Dorothy jump.  \"O, Toto!\" she cried; \"where did you come from?\"  \"I brought him along,\" said the shaggy man.  \"What for?\" she asked.  \"To guard these apples in my pocket, miss, so no one would steal them.\"  With one hand the shaggy man held the apple, which he began eating, while with the other hand he pulled Toto out of his pocket and dropped him to the ground.  Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once, barking joyfully at his release from the dark pocket.  When the child had patted his head lovingly, he sat down before her, his red tongue hanging out one side of his mouth, and looked up into her face with his bright brown eyes, as if asking her what they should do next.  Dorothy didn't know.  She looked around her anxiously for some familiar landmark; but everything was strange.  Between the branches of the many roads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees, but she couldn't see anywhere the farm-house from which she had just come, or anything she had ever seen before--except the shaggy man and Toto.  Besides this, she had turned around and around so many times trying to find out where she was, that now she couldn't even tell which direction the farm-house ought to be in; and this began to worry"]]]
