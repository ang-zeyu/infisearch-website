She never called her friend Meg, pronouncing that name to be \"too domestic and altogether unlovely.\"  Meg glanced from her own waist to her friend's slender, beautiful one, and sighed profoundly.  \"What ought I to be?\" she said in a low tone; and Aldith had answered, \"Eighteen--or nineteen, Marguerite, at the most; true symmetrical grace can never be obtained with a waist twenty-three inches round.\"  Aldith had not only made statements and comparisons, she had given her friend practical advice, and shown her how the thing was to be done.  And every night and morning Meg pulled away ruthlessly at her corset laces, and crushed her beautiful little body into narrower space.  She had already brought it within a girdle of twenty-one inches, which was a clear saving of two, and she had taken in all her dresses at the seams.  But she gave up the evening game of cricket, and she never made one at rounders now, much to the others' disgust.  No one, to look at the sweet blossom-like face, and soft, calm eyes, could have guessed what torture was being felt beneath the now pretty, welt-fitting dress body.  To walk quickly was positive pain; to stoop, almost agony; but she endured it all with a heroism worthy of a truly noble cause.  \"How long shall I have to go on like this, Aldith?\" she asked once faintly, after a French lesson that she had scarcely been able to sit through.  And the older girl answered carelessly, \"Oh, you mustn't leave it off, of course, but you don't feel it at all after a bit.\"  With which assurance Meg pursued her painful course.  Esther, the only person in a position to exercise any authority in the matter, had not noticed at all, and, indeed, had she done, so would not have thought very gravely of it, for it was only four years since she, too, had been sixteen, and a \"waist\" had been the most desirable thing on earth.  Once she had said unwittingly,  \"What a nice little figure you are getting, Meg; this new dressmaker certainly fits better than Miss Quinn\"; and foolish Meg, with a throb of delight, had redoubled her efforts.  Lynx-eyed Judy would have found her out long ago, and laughed her to utter shame, but unfortunately for Meg's constitution she was still at school, it being now the third month of her absence.  Aldith only lived about twenty minutes' walk from Misrule, so the two girls were always together.  Twice a week they went down to town in the river-boat to learn how to inquire, in polite French, \"Has the baker's young daughter the yellow hat, brown gloves, and umbrella of the undertaker's niece?\" And twice a week, after they had answered irrelevantly, \"No, but the surgeon had some beer, some mustard, and the dinner-gong,\" Aldith conducted her friend slowly up and down that happy hunting-ground of Sydney youth and fashion--the Block.  \"Just see how many hats I'll get taken off,\" Miss Aldith would say as they started; and by the end of the time Meg would say longingly, \"How lovely it must be to know crowds of gentlemen like you do.\"  Sometimes one or two of them would stop and exchange a word or two, and then Aldith would formally introduce Meg; often, however, the latter, who was sharp enough for all her foolishness, would fancy she detected a patronizing, amused air in these gentlemen's manners.  As, indeed, there often was; they were chiefly men whom Aldith had met at dances and tennis in her own home; and who thought that young lady a precocious child who wanted keeping in the schoolroom a few more years.  One day Aldith came to Misrule brimming over with mysterious importance.  \"Come down the garden, Marguerite,\" she said, taking no notice whatever of Baby, who had, with much difficulty, beguiled her eldest sister into telling her the ever delightful legend of the three little pigs.  \"Oh, no, by the hair of my chiny-chin-chin, then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in,\" had only been said twice, and the exciting part was still to come.  Baby looked up with stormy eyes.  \"Go away, Aldiff,\" she said.  \"Miss MacCarthy,--Baby, dear,\" Meg suggested, gently, catching Aldith's half-scornful smile.  \"ALDIFF,\" repeated Baby obstinately.  Then she relented, and put one caressing little arm round her sister's neck.  \"I will say Miff MacCarfy iss you will say ze uzzer little pig, too.\"  \"Oh, send her away, Marguerite, do,\" Aldith said impatiently, \"I have an enthralling secret to tell you, and I'll have to go soon.\"  Meg looked interested immediately.  \"Run away, Baby, dear,\" she said, kissing the disappointed little face; \"go and play Noah's Ark with Bunty, and I'll finish the piggies to-night or to-morrow.\"  \"But I want them NOW,\" Baby said insistently.  Meg pushed her gently aside.  \"No, run away, pet--run away at once like a good girl, and I'll tell you Red Riding Hood, too, to-morrow.\"  Baby looked up at her sister's guest.  \"You are a horrid old pig, Aldiff MacCatfy,\" she said, with slow emphasis, \"an' I hates you hard, an' we all hates you here, 'ceps Meg; and Pip says you're ze jammiest girl out, an' I wis' a drate big ziant would come and huff and puff and blow you into ze middlest part of ze sea.\"  Aldith laughed, a little aggravating grown-up laugh, that put the finishing touch to Baby's anger.  She put out her little hand and gave the guest's arm in its muslin sleeve a sharp, scientific pinch that Pip had taught her.  Then she fled madly away down the long paddocks, to the bit of bush beyond.  \"Insufferable,\" Aldith muttered angrily, and it needed all Meg's apologies and coaxings to get her into an amiable frame of mind again, and to induce her to communicate the enthralling secret.  At last, however, it was imparted, with great impressiveness. Aldith's eldest sister was engaged, engaged to be married!  Oh! wasn't it heavenly?  Wasn't it romantic?--and to the gentleman with the long fair moustache who had been so much at their house lately.  \"I knew it would come--I have seen it coming for a long time. Oh! I'm not easily blinded;\" Aldith said.  \"I know true love when I see it.  Though certainly for myself I should prefer a dark moustache, should not you, Marguerite?\"  \"Ye--es,\" said Meg.  Her views were hardly formed yet on the subject.  \"Jet black, with waxed ends, very stiff,\" Aldith continued thoughtfully, \"and a soldierly carriage, and very long black lashes.\"  \"So should I,\" Meg said, fired in a moment.  \"Like Guy Deloraine in 'Angelina's Ambition'.\"  Aldith put her arm more tightly round her friend.  \"Wouldn't it be HEAVENLY, Marguerite, to be engaged--you and I?\" she said, in a tone of dreamy rapture.  \"To have a dark, handsome man with proud black eyes just dying with love for you, going down on his knees, and giving you presents, and taking you out and all--oh, Marguerite, just think of it!\"  Melt's eyes looked wistful.  \"We're not old enough, though, yet,\" she said with a sigh.  Aldith tossed her head.  \"That's nonsense; why, Clara Allison is only seventeen, and look at your own stepmother.  Plenty of girls are actually married at sixteen, Marguerite, and a man proposed my sister Beatrice when she was only fifteen.\"  Meg looked impressed and thoughtful.  Then Aldith rose to go.  \"Mind you're in time for the boat to-morrow,\" she said, as they reached the gate; \"and, Marguerite, be sure you make yourself look very nice--wear your cornflower dress, and see if Mrs. Woolcot will lend you a pair of her gloves, your grey ones are just a little shabby, aren't they, dear?\"  \"H'm,\" said Meg, colouring.  \"And Mr. James Graham always comes back on that boat, and the two Courtney boys--Andrew Courtney told Beatrice he thought you seemed a nice little thing; he often notices you, he says, because you blush so.\"  \"I can't help it,\" Meg said, unhappily.  \"Aldith, how ought the ribbon to go on my hat?  I'm going to retrim it again.\"  \"Oh, square bows, somewhat stiff, and well at the side,\" the oracle, said.  \"I'm glad you're going to, dear, it looked just a wee bit dowdy, didn't it?\"  Meg coloured again.  \"Have you done your French?\" she said, as she pulled open the gate.  \"In a way,\" Aldith said carelessly.  Then she put up her chin, \"Those frowzy-looking Smiths always make a point of having no mistakes; and, Janet Green, whose hats are always four seasons behind the fashions; I prefer to have a few errors, just to show I haven't to work hard and be a teacher after I--\"  But just here she stumbled and fell down her full length in a most undignified manner, right across the muddy sidewalk.  It was a piece of string and Baby's vengeance.     CHAPTER VII  \"What Say You to Falling in Love?\"   Meg was looking ill, there was no doubt about it.  Her pretty pink-and-white complexion was losing its fresh look, a slightly irritable expression had settled round a mouth that a few months back had seemed made for smiles only.  And terribly unromantic fact, her nose was quite florid-looking at times. Now a heroine may have the largest, deepest, and most heavily lashed eyes imaginable; she may have hair in very truth like the gold \"mown from a harvest's middle floor\"; she may have lips like cherries and teeth like pearls, and a red nose will be so utterly fatal that all these other charms will pass unnoticed.  It cost Meg real anguish of spirit. She carefully read all the Answers to Correspondents in the various papers Aldith lent her in search of a remedy, but nearly everyone seemed to be asking for recipes to promote the growth of the eyelashes or to prevent _embonpoint_.  Not one she chanced on said, \"A red nose in a girl is generally caused by indigestion or tight-lacing.\"  She asked Aldith to suggest something, and that young person thought that vaseline and sulphur mixed together, and spread over the afflicted member, would have the desired effect.  So every night Meg fastened her bedroom door with a wedge of wood, keys being unknown luxuries at Misrule, and anointed her, poor little nose most carefully with the greasy mixture, lying all night on her back to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4731"],["title","Seven Little Australians (#8)"],["body","it rubbing off on the pillow.  Once Pip had forced his way into demand a few stitches for his braces which had split, and she had been compelled to wrap her whole face hastily up in a towel and declare she had violent neuralgia, and he must go to Esther or one of the servants.  Had he seen and known the cause there would have been no end to the teasing.  Nowadays Meg spent a great deal of time in her bedroom, that she had all to herself while Judy was away.  In its privacy she trimmed and retrimmed her hats, altered her dresses, read her novels, and sat in front of the looking-glass with her hair down, dreaming of being quite grown up and in love.  For just now both to Aldith, and herself that state of life seemed the only one altogether lovely and desirable.  Meg used to curl herself up in a big easy-chair that had drifted to her room because its springs were broken, and dream long, beautiful, hopeless dreams of a lover with \"long black lashes and a soldierly carriage.\"  Of course it was highly reprehensible to have such thoughts at the tender age of sixteen, but then the child had no mother to check that erring imagination, and she was a daughter of the South.  Australian girls nearly always begin to think of \"lovers and nonsense,\" as middlefolks call it, long before their English aged sisters do.  While still in the short-frock period of existence, and while their hair is still free-flowing, they take the keenest interest in boys--boys of neighbouring schools, other girls' brothers, young bank clerks, and the like.  Not because they would be good playmates, but because they look at them in the light of possible \"sweethearts.\"  I do not say English girl children are free from this. By no means; in every school there may be found one or two this way inclined, giggling, forward young things who want whipping and sending to play cricket or dolls again.  But in this land of youthfulness it is the rule more frequently than the exception, and herein lies the chief defect of the very young Australian girl. She is like a peach, a beautiful, smooth, rich peach, that has come to ripeness almost in a day, and that hastens to rub off the soft, delicate bloom that is its chief charm, just to show its bright, warm colouring more clearly.  Aldith had, to her own infinite satisfaction, brushed away her own \"bloom,\" and was at present busily engaged in trying to remove Meg's, which was very soft and lovely before she touched it.  The novels had taken away a little, and the \"Block\" a little more, but, Meg was naturally freshminded, and it took time to make much difference.  Just now, under her friend's tutelage, she was being inducted into the delightful mysteries of sweethearting, and for the time, it quite filled her some what purposeless young life.  But it all ended with an adventure that years afterwards used to make her cheeks tingle painfully at the thought.  After the bi-weekly French lesson, as I have said, the two friends used to come back together in the river-boat at five o'clock. And by this boat there always came two boys by the name of Courtney, and a third boy, Aldith's particular property, James Graham.  Now the young people had become known to each other at picnics and the like in the neighbourhood, but the acquaintance, instead of ripening on frequent meeting into a frank, pleasant friendship, had taken the turn of secrecy and silly playing at love.  James Graham was in a lawyer's office, a young articled cleric of seventeen in undue haste to be that delightful thing, a man. He carried a cane, and was very particular about his hat and necktie and his boots, which generally were tan.  And he had the faintest possible moustache, that he caressed with great frequency; and that privately Aldith thought adorable.  Aldith's pert, sprightly manner pleased him, and in a very short time they had got to the period of passing notes into each other's hands and sighing sentimentally.  Not that the notes contained much harm, they were generally of rather a formal character.   \"My dear' Miss MacCarthy,\" one would run--  \"Why were you not on the boat yesterday?  I looked for you till it was no use looking longer, and then the journey was blank. How charmingly that big hat suits you, and those jonquils at your neck.  Might I beg one of the flowers? just one, please, Aldith.  Your devoted friend,   James Graham.\"   And Aldith's, written on a sheet of her note-book with a pink programme pencil that she always kept in her purse, might be no worse than:   \"Dear Mr. Graham,  \"What EVER can you want these flowers at my neck for?  They have been there all day, and are dead and spoiled.  I can't IMAGINE what good they'll be to you.  Still, of course, if you REALLY care for them you shall have them.  I am so glad you like this hat.  I shall always like it NOW.  Did you REALLY miss me yesterday?  I had gone to have my photo taken.  Marguerite thinks it very good indeed, but I am SURE it flatters me TOO much.  Yours truly,   L. Aldith Evelyn MacCarthy.\"   Now Mr. James Graham had a great friend in one of the before-mentioned Courtney boys, Andrew by name.  He was a handsome lad of eighteen, still a schoolboy, but possessed of fascinating manners and a pair of really beautiful eyes.  And, since his friend and companion Jim had taken to \"having fun\" with \"the girl MacCarthy,\" he objected to being left out in the cold.  So he began to pay marked attentions to Meg, who blushed right up to her soft, pretty fringe every time he spoke to her, and looked painfully conscious and guilty if he said anything at all complimentary to her.  The other boy, Alan Courtney, was very tall and broad-shouldered, and not at all good-looking.  He had a strong, plain face, grey eyes deeply set, and brown hair that looked as if he was in a constant state of rumpling it up the wrong way.  He was a University student, and a great footballer, and he never diverted himself on the long homeward journey in the way Andrew and his friend did.  He used generally to give a half-contemptuous nod as he passed the little group, uncovering his head for the shortest possible period consistent with civility, and making his way to the far end of the boat.  One time as he passed them Aldith was drooping her lashes and using her eyes with great effect, and Meg was almost positive she heard him mutter under his breath, \"Silly young fools!\" He used to smoke at his end of the boat--cigars at the beginning of term and a short, black, villainous-looking pipe at the end--and Meg used secretly to think how manly he looked, and to sigh profoundly.  For I may as well tell you now as later what this foolish little thing had done after a few months' course of Aldith and novels. She had fallen in love as nearly as it is possible for sweet sixteen to do; and it was with Alan, who had no good looks nor pleasant manners--not Andrew, who had speaking eyes, and curls that \"made his forehead like the rising sun\"; not Andrew, who gave her tender glances and conversation peppermints that said \"My heart is thine,\" but Alan, who took no notice whatever of her beyond an occasional half-scornful bow.  Poor little Meg!  She was very miserable in these days, and yet it was a kind of exquisite misery that she hugged to her to keep it warm.  No one guessed her secret.  She would have died rather than allow even Aldith to get a suspicion of it, and accepted Andrew's notes and smiles as if there was nothing more she wanted.  But she grew a trifle thin and large-eyed, and used to make copious notes in her diary every night, and to write a truly appalling quantity of verses, in which \"heart\" and \"part,\" \"grieve\" and \"leave,\" \"weep\" and \"keep,\" and \"sigh\" and \"die,\" were most often the concluding words of the lines.  She endured Andrew for several reasons.  He was Alan's brother for one thing, and was always saying things about \"old Al,\" and recording his prowess on the football field; and Aldith might discover her secret if she gave him the cold shoulder altogether.  Besides this Andrew had the longest eyelashes she had ever seen and she must have somebody to say pretty things to her, even if it was not the person she would have wished it to be.  One day things came to a crisis.  \"No more trips on the dear old boat for a month,\" Aldith remarked, from her corner of the cabin.  \"This is appalling! Whatever do you mean, Miss MacCarthy?\" James Graham said, with exaggerated despair in his voice.  \"Monsieur H---- has given the class a month's holiday.  He is going to Melbourne,\" Aldith returned, with a sigh.  Meg echoed it as in duty bound, and Andrew said fiercely that hanging was too good for Monsieur H----.  What did he mean by such inhuman conduct, he should like to know; and however were Jim and himself to maintain life in the meantime?  \"It was James who speedily thought of a way out.\"  \"Couldn't we go for a walk somewhere one evening--just we four?\" he said insinuatingly.  Aldith and Andrew thought the proposal a brilliant one; and though Meg had at first shaken her head decidedly, in the end she was prevailed upon, and promised faithfully to go.  They were to meet in a bush paddock adjoining the far one belonging to Misrule, to walk for about an hour, returning by half-past seven, before it grew dusk.  \"I am going to ask you for something that day, Meg,\" Andrew whispered just as they were parting.  \"I wonder if I shall get it.\"  Meg flushed in her nervous, conscious way, and wondered to herself for a moment whether he intended to ask for a lock of her hair, a thing Graham had already obtained from Aldith.  \"What?\" she said unwillingly.  \"A kiss,\" he whispered.  The next minute the others had joined them, and there was no chance for the indignant answer that trembled on her lips.  She had even to shake hands, to appear as if nothing had happened, and to part apparently good friends.  \"Half-past six sharp, Marguerite.  I will never forgive you if you don't come,\" Aldith said, as they parted at her gate.  \""]]]
