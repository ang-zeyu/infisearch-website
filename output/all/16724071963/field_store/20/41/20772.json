We must do all three until evil is wiped out. Right now you are in a peculiar position and the only one on whom I can rely.”  “I’ll try not to betray your trust,” she said. “I learned just now that Tini’s friend had been staying at Hotel Carlton over in the city. I’m afraid he’s already left there. He wrote her he had to leave unexpectedly.”  Suddenly the major’s hearty laughter filled the little room. “So he got wise to the fact that he was being watched!”  “Oh—so you already knew he was staying there?”  Major Reed became wary. “We had a line on him.”  “But how?” asked Nancy. “Tini did come in on that next bus the other night. Nobody here had time to get into the village and follow him after he put Tini on the bus.”  “I acted on your information promptly. There’s such a thing as the telephone,” he reminded Nancy.  He made this unsatisfactory explanation with a finality that told her she must inquire no further into his end of the business.  “Have you learned anything else?” he asked.  “Yes. Tini told us she met him in Charleston. He’s a traveling salesman, uses the trains instead of a car. He suggested that Tini join the Army Nurse Corps.”  “So!” Major Reed’s dark eyebrows lifted slightly.  “Mabel Larsen took nurse’s training in the same hospital with her. She said Tini went into it originally because she was crazy about one of the internes. But that may be only gossip, for it does sound mean. I’m afraid Tini isn’t very well liked.”  Major Reed was abstractedly making crosses on a scrap of paper. Finally his pencil stopped, and he looked squarely across at Nancy.  “Has Miss Hoffman done anything to make you feel she has gotten on the inside merely to supply information to our enemies?”  “That’s a stiff question, Major.”  “I know it is. But you’re in a better position to judge of such things than any of the instructors.”  “Tini gripes a lot about regulations and the hardships of the military training, but Mabel said she was always complaining during her nurse’s training. She’s an only child. Her family has plenty of money, and she’s rather spoiled. All those things have to be taken into consideration.”  Nancy saw the ghost of a smile flicker around the major’s nice lips. Then he said, “But you’ve evaded my question.”  “Oh, no. I’m not trying to evade, because I honestly don’t think Tini has the makings of a spy. I think she’s motivated entirely by selfishness. She would be horribly bored here without dates—she’ll go with most anybody rather than be dateless.”  “I suppose with a little flattery a man could wheedle a good bit out of her.”  “You may be right,” Nancy conceded.  She rose to leave and he stood up.  “All this has been a great help,” he told her. “But keep in mind it’s still between us two.”  She was almost at the door when he added, “And by the way—a notice has just been put on the bulletin board that will interest you.”  “Oh, are we going to be sent overseas soon?”  He laughed again. “You’re optimistic! Some nurses have been waiting to go over for a year or more, and here you’re expecting to go in a few weeks.”  “It has been done,” Nancy came back promptly. “Oh, Major Reed, if they’d only send me to the South Pacific in a hurry! I have a brother out there who’s almost finished his flying missions. If I get there before he comes back, I may have a chance to see him.”  “Just keep your shirt on,” he told her. “You’ll probably get into the thick of it before it’s all over. I’m afraid there’s more than we dreamed of ahead. That notice out there says you’re to get a taste of tent life, starting Monday.”  “Oh, that’s really to my liking!” exclaimed Nancy. She hurried away to find Mabel and tell her the news.  On Sunday just before supper Nancy and Mabel were packed to start off by army truck at dawn next morning. It was exciting to put into practice their instructions about packing compactly for travel, for they were to move on now as if they were going into a combat area.  “Seems like the real thing,” said Mabel eagerly.  They had had their supper and were ready for bed early when they heard a knock on their door. It proved to be Lieutenant Hauser.  “Long-distance call for you, Miss Dale,” she said when they opened the door.  Nancy stood stunned for a moment. Her arrangement with the folks back home was that she would call them every Sunday at two o’clock, as long as phone calls of that kind were permissible. She had talked with her mother and father only a few hours ago, though she had not been able to tell them she was moving on to another address. They would have to be informed about that later when the unit had arrived safely. To have them call back like this alarmed her. She knew no one else who would call her by long-distance telephone here.  “She said you had a long-distance call,” Mabel repeated, when Nancy still stood where she had received the message.  “But why would they be calling back?” Nancy wanted to know.  “Oh come on, gal!” exclaimed Mabel, wrapping her housecoat around her and taking Nancy’s arm. “How will you ever face all those bombs if you get so scared over a little telephone bell ringing?”  Nancy could think only that something terrible must have happened to her parents. She let Mabel lead her like a sleep-walker to the phone in Lieutenant Hauser’s office.  “Hello! Yes—this is Nancy. Oh Dad, that you? I was afraid something was wrong with you or Mom.”  Mabel could hear Mr. Dale’s deep voice as she stood close to Nancy: “No, we’re all right, but we had upsetting news just now from the government—”  “From the government—you—you mean about Tommy?” asked Nancy.  “They report he’s been missing in action over enemy territory since the second of March.”  “Oh Dad!” wailed Nancy. “It can’t be true! It just can’t! God wouldn’t let anything happen to our Tommy.”  “Not if our prayers can keep it from happening, darling,” came the firm voice confidently over the wire. “You just keep on praying like we’ve been doing all along, and he’ll be taken care of.”  “Oh Dad, how I wish I could be there with you and Mom right now! How is she?”  “Just the same brave saint she’s always been. She’s writing you a letter now to hearten you.”  “Kiss her for me,” said Nancy. “And tell her I’ll pray harder than ever.”  Nancy put down the phone and faced Mabel.  “I could hear what he said,” her friend told her gently. “Don’t give up hope, Nancy. Lots of times they turn up after they’re reported missing. Maybe he’s not dead.”  “Oh, no, he’s not!” Nancy asserted firmly. “I’m not going to think of it for a minute. He wrote me in that last letter he could feel our prayers helping protect him, and he’s going to feel it more than ever now.”  From sunrise till mid-afternoon the following day the convoy rolled smoothly west along the paved highway. At noon they stopped in a large city to eat a lunch the canteen girls had prepared. It was good to get out and stretch their legs after sitting on the hard truck seats all morning. No one knew where they were going, or how long they would be on their way, so the nurses made the best of their hour’s rest. They took turns in the canteen dressing room, freshening up to continue their journey.  While they rested Nancy slipped her brother’s last letter from her pocket and re-read it. Mabel caught her at it and tried to cheer her.  “Come on now,” she said, “it does no good grieving.”  “I’m not grieving. It—it makes me feel more certain he’s going to come out all right when I re-read his letter.”  “Let’s take a sprint around the block,” suggested Mabel. “We have a few minutes before we take off.”  “Not a bad idea. A little exercise will do us good.”  “We may never get a peep at this burg again. I sure don’t mean to miss anything on the way.”  Other girls were out pacing up and down the sidewalk in front of the canteen, but Nancy and Mabel wanted to see more. They were in the heart of town, and the street back of the canteen had many attractive shop windows. Nancy kept glancing at her watch as they paused to admire the pretty dresses.  “Do you feel like someone who’s renounced the world when you look at those dresses?” asked Mabel.  “Oh, well, it won’t be forever,” Nancy said consolingly. “At least we can still wear evening dresses for dances on the post, Miss Hauser said.”  “Yeah! That will be a slight morale booster.”  “I never felt more smartly dressed than I do in this uniform,” continued Nancy.  “I must admit they do look rather stunning,” Mabel agreed.  The next store carried drugs, and they were about to pass by when Nancy seized Mabel’s arm. “Say, that looks like Tini in there!”  Mabel stepped back and looked in. “Sure is! Come on, I’ll get some dental floss and see what she’s up to.”  As they went in, Tini’s back was toward them. She sat on a stool at the soda counter, drinking a coke. Why had she come here for a coke when they had all the cold drinks they wanted back at the canteen? Tini was leaning across the counter, turning her charm on the soda jerker who was at least five years her junior. What was she up to now, Nancy wondered?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   CHAPTER SIX                                 CAMOUFLAGE   Nancy was not too surprised when she found Tini having a whispered conversation with the soda jerker in the strange town. Tini seemed always involved in some undercurrent.  She glanced at her watch and saw they had only five minutes before the transport was due to move on. “We’ve got to beat it,” she told Mabel.  “Better come along, Tini, or you’ll be left behind!” warned Mabel as they went toward the door.  Tini threw her money on the counter and overtook the girls.  “Don’t see why you wanted a coke ’round here when we had plenty of free ones at the Canteen,” Mabel said.  “Oh, just an excuse to talk to the clerk. I wanted to ask him if Carl Benton had been here lately.”  “C"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47307"],["title","Nancy Dale, Army Nurse (#7)"],["body","Benton,” repeated Nancy as they almost ran toward their trucks. “You mean that fellow you dated back yonder?”  “Sure. He sells soda-fountain supplies. Said he came through here often.”  “Did that chap know him?” asked Nancy.  “Dumb bloke—no! He’s only had that job a few days.”  “Surely you’ve heard from him since he left,” said Mabel, not without an acid flavor in her tone.  “You bet! But I thought if he was around this way I might get a chance to see him again.”  “May as well put him out of your mind,” Nancy suggested.  “Gal, if my hunch is right we won’t be doing any dating till we get through some maneuvers ahead of us,” said Mabel.  Toward sunset it began to look as though Mabel’s hunch had some material foundation. They turned off the paved highway and bumped for five miles over a rutted clay road before they entered a swamp made shadowy by the Spanish moss that hung from the oaks, cypress and sweet gum trees. Though the nurses were tired after their long day’s travel, Nancy and Mabel exchanged satisfied glances.  “Say, gal,” whispered Mabel. “Looks like they’re preparing us for the real thing.”  “We’ll sure have to sleep under nets down here or there won’t be any snoozing,” said Nancy.  The sun had already gone down, leaving a red glow in the west, when the convoy circled a clearing in the swamp where there was a small tent village already set up. The passengers climbed out gratefully, each nurse loaded with her personal baggage.  Lieutenant Hauser called the roll and assigned four girls to each tent. The tents were numbered, so the nurses hurried off to see what their new homes were like.  “Four cots and that’s all!” exclaimed Mabel, the first to reach number four, their new habitation.  Nancy’s heart had taken a dive when she learned that Tini and her former room-mate, Ida Hall, were to share the tent with Mabel and herself. Had this been prearranged by Major Reed, she wondered? She certainly had no desire to continue serving as a day and night watchman for Tini Hoffman.  “Must think we’re made of cast iron,” complained Tini when she tried out her cot.  “But here are mattress cases,” said Nancy. “We can stuff ’em with Spanish moss from the trees and make grand mattresses. We used to do that when Dad took us fishing in the river swamp.”  “Not a bad idea,” agreed Ida.  They took their casings and hurried off under the trees to fill them before dark. The suggestion spread, and soon the swamp was alive with nurses preparing for a comfortable night’s sleep.  Their mess hall was a long tent in the center of the camp. They ate by lantern light. The food was all from cans, and cold, but the nurses were too hungry that night to be critical.  “Say, this is going to be real fun,” said Mabel, as they made their way back to their tents by G.I. flashlights.  Though it was spring the swampy air had a penetrating chill, which, however, did not discourage the mosquitoes at all.  “When we used to go camping we drove away the pests with a big campfire,” said Nancy, thinking sadly of the good times she had had with her dad, Tommy and their friends at their swamp shack.  “No fires here,” said Ida. “I heard Lieutenant Hauser say we must live just as if we were in range of enemy fire.”  Each tent had one lantern that hung from the center pole. Under it Nancy nailed a puny mirror, which had to serve all of them in turn. They transformed canned goods packing boxes into chairs. Their individual toilet articles had to be fished out from their musette bags every time they were used.  As neither Mabel nor Tini had ever been camping, they had their initiation that night in sleeping under mosquito nets.  “Gosh, feels like a prison in here!” exclaimed Mabel.  “A prison you’ll be glad to stay in,” Nancy informed her, “when you hear how those mosquitoes sing outside it.”  Long before day, however, each of the nurses was rolled in a blanket under her net and the discouraged pests had returned to their swamp muck.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _The Nurses Washed Their Clothes in the River_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  In the days that followed the nurses discovered what it meant to do all their bathing and clothes washing in the shallows along the river shore. With only a compass to guide them, they learned to cut their way through the dense undergrowth of the river swamp. More than one rattler had to be killed in the process. But many others they left alone, as they had been given careful instructions about poisonous snakes and insects in various parts of the world. They crossed streams and lagoons in high boots, and several times ate from their mess kits the food they prepared for themselves on all-day hikes.  All nursing work was suspended while they were put through these physical fitness tests. To Nancy’s amazement, Tini Hoffman stood hers along with the others, for she seemed to understand its significance. Tini became another person when there were no men around on whom to turn her charms.  They had been camping on the river shore only three days when at breakfast one morning they were given orders to be prepared to leave by noon.  “I’m surely ready to go,” said Tini, who sat next to Nancy on the long bench at the table. “It’s been an eternity since we had any mail.”  They seemed so remote from civilization here that it seemed ages to Nancy also since she had heard what was going on in the rest of the world. But their high hopes proved premature as they were not yet scheduled for city lights.  Lieutenant Hauser gave the orders. “Every group is to take down its own tent, roll and pack it, according to previous instructions.”  Buzzing with talk and excitement the nurses scattered to their various quarters. Nancy had left her washing on a bush over night, so snatched it up as she hurried back to begin packing. Ten minutes before twelve all tents had been cleared to the last tent peg, and the nurses began to pack their belongings into the trucks in which they had arrived. It was thrilling and exciting business, for none of the trainees knew where the next stop would be.  To their surprise the convoy did not move out by the way it had come. Instead it turned toward the river. The nurses had discovered no bridges in all their hikes up and down the small stream, so they were not surprised when the trucks had to cross the stream at a shallow ford. For the first time they had a sample of what it would be like to travel where there were no paved roads and bridges.  After leaving the river the trucks moved on to higher ground. They left the gray-bearded trees behind and plowed through sand-rutted roads winding through a pine forest. At noon they stopped to eat from tins under the sighing pines. Then they learned they were not on their way back to their original training center.  “In about two hours we will pitch our tents again,” explained Lieutenant Hauser. “Some of your most difficult work is just ahead. Our camp will have a public highway on one side, but I warn you to talk to no one outside our unit, or give out any information about the tests you’re going through.”  “You mean we can’t even write our friends about what we’ve been doing on this trip?” asked Mabel.  “Certainly not! Too many times spies have deduced from the nature of a group’s training what its overseas destination might be.”  A surprised murmur swept over the semicircle of young women sitting on the carpet of brown pine needles. Nancy wondered about the letters Tini had written every day while they were in camp. She herself had written long descriptions of their camping life to her parents, but she realized now those letters she had been hoping to mail would have to be torn up.  But Miss Hauser was continuing, “This period is a try-out for actual overseas duty. We must conform to all restrictions we would have there.”  “Overseas duty!” Those were the magic words they had long wanted to hear. They brought a joyous outburst from the eager nurses, that ended in clapping.  “Aren’t we the lucky blokes!” exclaimed Mabel.  “And say, it looks as though it’s going to be in the tropics,” Nancy whispered.  When they rose to go back to the trucks Tini began to complain. “It’s utterly silly not letting us tell anything about what we’ve been doing in the swamp.”  “Ah, gee, who minds that?” asked Mabel. “After all, we agreed to submit ourselves to this rigorous training.”  “Of course we did,” said Nancy. “I’m sure they have good reasons for all these restrictions. You can never tell what spies may make of the smallest bit of information that may leak out.”  When they were rolling along again in their trucks, Nancy recalled how Tini had spent all her spare time back on the river shore, writing letters. Every night she had pushed her cot close to the lantern and sat under her mosquito bar to finish her writing. With her usual lack of consideration for others she kept the light burning till the tent swarmed with mosquitoes, moths and other insects.  “I bet she’ll try to mail those letters in spite of what Lieutenant Hauser said,” Nancy thought with disgust.  For the next twenty-four hours, however, there was no time to dwell on her tent mate’s tendency to insubordination. The nurses had thought they had stiff training in the swamp, but they truly got a taste of real training when their journey ended in the pine thicket at three that afternoon. No sooner were the ropes tied to the last tent peg than they were ordered to a near-by field.  They found several soldiers with guns in the bushy cover on the edge of the field. When the nurses came up in their coveralls and G.I. shoes, Sergeant Tanner gave them instructions.  “We’re going to let you find out what it feels like to be fleeing with the enemy firing behind you,” he said, a mischievous twinkle in his brown eyes. “You’re to start across the field, and every time a blast of firing comes you’re to fall on your faces.”  “We won’t"]]]
