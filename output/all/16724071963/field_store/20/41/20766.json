She sung a song; an' orl them bitter things   That chewin' over lovers' quarrils brings     Guv place to thorts of sorrer an' remorse.   Like when some dilly punter goes an' slings     'Is larst, lone deener on some stiffened 'orse,   An' learns them vain regrets wot 'urts an' stings.    'Twas at a beano where I lobs along   To drown them memories o' fancied wrong.     I swears I never knoo that she'd be there.   But when I met 'er eye--O, 'struth, 'twas strong!     'Twas bitter strong, that jolt o' dull despair!   'Er look o' scorn!...An' then, she sung a song.    The choon was one o' them sad, mournful things   That ketch yeh in the bellers 'ere, and brings     Tears to yer eyes.  The words was uv a tart   'Oo's trackin' wiv a silly coot 'oo slings     'Er love aside, an' breaks 'er tender 'eart....   But 'twasn't that; it was the way she sings.    To 'ear 'er voice!...A bloke 'ud be a log   'Oo kep' 'is block.  Me mind wus in a fog     Of sorrer for to think 'ow I wus wrong;   Ar, I 'ave been a fair ungrateful 'og!     The feelin' that she put into that song   'Ud melt the 'eart-strings of a chiner dog.    I listens wiv me 'eart up in me throat;   I drunk in ev'ry word an' ev'ry note.     Tears trembles in 'er voice when she tells 'ow   That tart snuffed out becos 'e never wrote.     An' then I seen 'ow I wus like that cow.   Wiv suddin shame me guilty soul wus smote.    Doreen she never looked my way; but stood   'Arf turned away, an' beefed it out reel good,     Until she sang that bit about the grave;   \"Too late 'e learned 'e 'ad misunderstood!\"     An' then--Gorstrooth!  The pleadin' look she gave   Fair in me face 'ud melt a'eart o' wood.    I dunno 'ow I seen that evenin' thro'.   They muster thort I was 'arf shick, I knoo.     But I 'ad 'urt Doreen wivout no call;   I seen me dooty, wot I 'ad to do.     O, strike!  I could 'a' blubbed before 'em all!   But I sat tight, an' never cracked a boo.    An' when at larst the tarts they makes a rise,   A lop-eared coot wiv 'air down to 'is eyes     'E 'ooks on to Doreen, an' starts to roam   Fer 'ome an' muvver.  I lines up an' cries,     \"'An's orf!  I'm seein' this 'ere cliner 'ome!\"   An' there we left 'im, gapin' wiv surprise.    She never spoke; she never said no word;   But walked beside me like she never 'eard.     I swallers 'ard, an' starts to coax an' plead,   I sez I'm dead ashamed o' wot's occurred.     She don't reply; she never takes no 'eed;   Jist stares before 'er like a startled bird.    I tells 'er, never can no uvver tart   Be 'arf wot she is, if we 'ave to part.     I tells 'er that me life will be a wreck.   It ain't no go.  But when I makes a start     To walk away, 'er arms is roun' me neck.   \"Ah, Kid!\" she sobs.  \"Yeh nearly broke me 'eart!\"    I dunno wot I done or wot I said.   But 'struth!  I'll not forgit it till I'm dead--     That night when 'ope back in me brisket lobs:   'Ow my Doreen she lays 'er little 'ead     Down on me shoulder 'ere, an' sobs an' sobs;   An' orl the lights goes sorter blurred an' red.    Say, square an' all--It don't seem right, some'ow,   To say such things; but wot I'm feelin' now     'As come at times, I s'pose, to uvver men   When you 'ave 'ad a reel ole ding-dong row,     Say, ain't it bonzer makin' up agen?   Straight wire, it's almost worth...Ar, I'm a cow!    To think I'd ever seek to 'arm a 'air   Of 'er dear 'ead agen!  My oath, I swear     No more I'll roust on 'er in angry 'eat!   But still, she never seemed to me so fair;     She never wus so tender or so sweet   As when she smooged beneath the lamplight there.    She's never been so lovin' wiv 'er gaze;   So gentle wiv 'er pretty wimmin's ways.     I tells 'er she's me queen, me angel, too.   \"Ah, no, I ain't no angel, Kid,\" she says.     \"I'm jist a woman, an' I loves yeh true!   An' so I'll love yeh all me mortal days!\"    She sung a song....'Ere, in me barmy style,   I sets orl tarts; for in me hour o' trile     Me soul was withered be a woman's frown,   An' broodin' care come roostin' on me dile.     She sung a song....Me 'eart, wiv woe carst down,   Wus raised to 'Eaven be a woman's smile.      VIII.  Mar     \"'Er pore dear par,\" she sez, \"'e kept a store\";   An' then she weeps an' stares 'ard at the floor.     \"'Twas thro' 'is death,\" she sez, \"we wus rejuiced   To this,\" she sez...An' then she weeps some more.    \"'Er Par,\" she sez, \"me poor late 'usband, kept   An 'ay an' corn store.  'E'd no faults ixcept     'Im fallin' 'eavy orf a load o' charf   W'ich--killed 'im--on the---\" 'Struth!  But 'ow she wept.    She blows 'er nose an' sniffs.  \"'E would 'a' made\"   She sez \"a lot of money in the trade.     But, 'im took orf so sudden-like, we found   'E 'adn't kept 'is life insurince paid.    \"To think,\" she sez, \"a child o' mine should be   Rejuiced to workin' in a factory!     If 'er pore Par 'e 'adn't died,\" she sobs...   I sez, \"It wus a bit o' luck for me.\"    Then I gits red as 'ell, \"That is--I mean,\"   I sez, \"I mighter never met Doreen   If 'e 'ad not\"--an' 'ere I lose me block--\"I 'ope,\"   I sez, \"'e snuffed it quick and clean.\"    An' that wus 'ow I made me first deboo.   I'd dodged it cunnin' fer a month or two.     Doreen she sez, \"You'll 'ave to meet my Mar,   SOME day,\" she sez.  An' so I seen it thro'.    I'd pictered some stern female in a cap   Wot puts the fear o' Gawd into a chap.   An' 'ere she wus, aweepin' in 'er tea   An' drippin' moistcher like a leaky tap.    Two dilly sorter dawgs made outer delf   Stares 'ard at me frum orf the mantelshelf.     I seemed to symperthise wiv them there pups;   I felt so stiff an' brittle-like meself.    Clobber?  Me trosso, 'ead to foot, wus noo--   Got up regardless, fer this interview.     Stiff shirt, a Yankee soot split up the back,   A tie wiv yeller spots an' stripes o' blue.    Me cuffs kep' playin' wiv me nervis fears   Me patent leathers nearly brought the tears     An' there I sits wiv, \"Yes, mum.  Thanks.  Indeed?\"   Me stand-up collar sorin' orf me ears.    \"Life's 'ard,\" she sez, an' then she brightens up.   \"Still, we 'ave alwus 'ad our bite and sup.     Doreen's been SICH a help; she 'as indeed.   Some more tea, Willy?  'Ave another cup.\"    Willy!  O 'ell!  'Ere wus a flamin' pill!   A moniker that alwus makes me ill.     \"If it's the same to you, mum,\" I replies   \"I answer quicker to the name of Bill.\"    Up goes 'er 'ands an' eyes, \"That vulgar name!\"   No, Willy, but it isn't all the same,     My fucher son must be respectable.\"   \"Orright,\" I sez, \"I s'pose it's in the game.\"    \"Me fucher son,\" she sez, \"right on frum this   Must not take anythink I say amiss.     I know me jooty be me son-in-lor;   So, Willy, come an' give yer Mar a kiss.\"    I done it.  Tho' I dunno 'ow I did.   \"Dear boy,\" she sez, \"to do as you are bid.     Be kind to 'er,\" she sobs, \"my little girl!\"   An' then I kiss Doreen.  Sez she \"Ah Kid!\"    Doreen!  Ar 'ow 'er pretty eyes did shine.   No sight on earth or 'Eaving's 'arf so fine,     An' as they looked at me she seemed to say   \"I'm proud of 'im, I am, an' 'e is mine.\"    There wus a sorter glimmer in 'er eye,   An 'appy, nervis look, 'arf proud, 'arf shy;     I seen 'er in me mind be'ind the cups   In our own little kipsie, bye an' bye.    An' then when Mar-in-lor an' me began   To tork of 'ouse'old things an' scheme an' plan,     A sudden thort fair jolts me where I live:   \"These is my wimmin folk!  An' I'm a man!\"    It's wot they calls responsibility.   All of a 'eap that feelin' come to me;     An' somew'ere in me 'ead I seemed to feel   A sneakin' sort o' wish that I was free.    'Ere's me 'oo never took no 'eed o' life,   Investin' in a mar-in-lor an' wife:     Someone to battle fer besides meself,   Somethink to love an' shield frum care and strife.    It makes yeh solim when yeh come to think   Wot love and marridge means.  Ar, strike me pink!     It ain't all sighs and kisses.  It's yer life.   An' 'ere's me tremblin' on the bloomin' brink.    \"'Er pore dead Par,\" she sez, an' gulps a sob.   An' then I tells 'er 'ow I got a job,     As storeman down at Jones' printin' joint,   A decent sorter cop at fifty bob.    Then things get 'ome-like; an' we torks till late,   An' tries to tease Doreen to fix the date,     An' she gits suddin soft and tender-like,   An' cries a bit, when we parts at the gate.    An' as I'm moochin' 'omeward frum the car   A suddin notion stops me wiv a jar--   Wot if Doreen, I thinks, should grow to be,   A fat ole weepin' willer like 'er Mar!    O, 'struth! It won't bear thinkin' of!  It's crook!   An' I'm a mean, unfeelin' dawg to look     At things like that.  Doreen's Doreen to me,   The sweetest peach on w'ich a man wus shook.    'Er \"pore dear Par\"...I s'pose 'e 'ad 'is day,   An' kissed an' smooged an' loved 'er in 'is way.   An' wed an' took 'is chances like a man--   But, Gawd, this splicin' racket ain't all play.    Love is a gamble, an' there ain't no certs.   Some day, I s'pose, I'll git wise to the skirts,     An' learn to take the bitter wiv the sweet...   But, strike me purple!  \"Willy!\"  THAT'S wot 'urts.      IX. Pilot Cove     Young friend,\" 'e sez...Young friend!     Well, spare me days!   Yeh'd think I wus 'is own white-'eaded boy--   The queer ole finger, wiv 'is gentle ways.     \"Young friend,\" 'e sez, \"I wish't yeh bofe great joy.\"     The langwidge that them parson blokes imploy   Fair tickles me.  The way'e bleats an' brays!         \"Young friend,\" 'e sez.    \"Young friend,\" 'e sez...Yes, my Doreen an' me     We're gettin' hitched, all straight an' on the square.   Fer when I torks about the registry--     O 'oly wars!  yeh should 'a' seen 'er stare;     \"The registry?\" she sez, \"I wouldn't dare!   I know a clergyman we'll go an' see\"...         \"Young friend,\" 'e sez.    \"Young friend,\" 'e sez.

An' then 'e mags a lot     Of jooty an' the spiritchuil life,   To which I didn't tumble worth a jot.     \"I'm sure,\" 'e sez, \"as you will 'ave a wife    'Oo'll 'ave a noble infl'ince on yer life.

There ain't no tart a 'undreth part so dear     As 'er.

Fer many, many years I've lived.   An' I kin but recall wiv tears an' sighs     The lives of some I've seen in marridge gived.\"     \"My Gawd!\" I sez.  \"I'll strive as no bloke strivved!

An' when I seen 'er standin' blushin' there,   I turns an' kisses 'er, fair on the lips.         \"Young friend!\" 'e sez.      X.

Still,     I does me stunt in this 'ere hitchin' rot,   An' speaks me piece: \"Righto!\" I sez, \"I will.\"    \"I will,\" I sez.  An' tho' a joyful shout     Come from me bustin' 'eart--I know it did--   Me voice got sorter mangled comin' out,     An' makes me whisper like a frightened kid.     \"I will,\" I squeaks.  An' I'd 'a' give a quid   To 'ad it on the quite, wivout this fuss,     An' orl the starin' crowd that Mar 'ad bid   To see this solim hitchin' up of us.    \"Fer--rich-er--er--fer--por-er.\"  So 'e bleats.     \"In--sick-ness--an'--in-ealth,\"...An' there I stands,   An' dunno'arf the chatter I repeats,     Nor wot the 'ell to do wiv my two 'ands.     But 'e don't 'urry puttin' on our brands--   This white-'aired pilot-bloke--but gives it lip,     Dressed in 'is little shirt, wiv frills an' bands.   \"In sick-ness--an'--in--\" Ar! I got the pip!   An' once I missed me turn; an' Ginger Mick,     'Oo's my best-man, 'e ups an' beefs it out.   \"I will!\" 'e 'owls; an' fetches me a kick.     \"Your turn to chin!\" 'e tips wiv a shout.     An' there I'm standin' like a gawky lout.   (Aw, spare me!  But I seemed to be ALL 'ands!)     An' wonders wot 'e's goin' crook about,   Wiv 'arf a mind to crack 'im where 'e stands.    O, lumme!  But ole Ginger was a trick!     Got up regardless fer the solim rite.   ('E 'awks the bunnies when 'e toils, does Mick)     An' twice I saw 'im feelin' fer a light     To start a fag; an' trembles lest'e might,   Thro' force o' habit like.  'E's nervis too;     That's plain, fer orl 'is air o' bluff an' skite;   An' jist as keen as me to see it thro'.    But, 'struth, the wimmin!  'Ow they love this frill!     Fer Auntie Liz, an' Mar, o' course, wus there;   An' Mar's two uncles' wives, an' Cousin Lil,     An' 'arf a dozen more to grin and stare.     I couldn't make me 'ands fit anywhere!   I felt like I wus up afore the Beak!     But my Doreen she never turns a 'air,   Nor misses once when it's 'er turn to speak.    Ar, strike!  No more swell marridges fer me!     It seems a blinded year afore 'e's done.   We could 'a' fixed it in the registree     Twice over 'fore this cove 'ad 'arf begun.     I s'pose the wimmin git some sorter fun   Wiv all this guyver, an' 'is nibs's shirt.     But, seems to me, it takes the bloomin' bun,   This stylish splicin' uv a bloke an' skirt.    \"To--be--yer--weddid--wife--\" Aw, take a pull!     Wot in the 'ell's 'e think I come there for?   An' so 'e drawls an' drones until I'm full,     An' wants to do a duck clean out the door.     An' yet, fer orl 'is 'igh-falutin' jor,   Ole Snowy wus a reel good-meanin' bloke.     If 'twasn't fer the 'oly look 'e wore   Yeh'd think 'e piled it on jist fer a joke.    An', when at last 'e shuts 'is little book,     I 'eaves a sigh that nearly bust me vest.   But 'Eavens!  Now 'ere's muvver goin' crook!     An' sobbin' awful on me manly chest!     (I wish she'd give them water-works a rest.)   \"My little girl!\" she 'owls.  \"O, treat'er well!     She's young--too young to leave 'er muvver's nest!\"   \"Orright, ole chook,\" I nearly sez.  Oh, 'ell!    An' then we 'as a beano up at Mar's--     A slap-up feed, wiv wine an' two big geese.   Doreen sits next ter me, 'er eyes like stars.     O, 'ow I wished their blessed yap would cease!     The Parson-bloke 'e speaks a little piece,   That makes me blush an' 'ang me silly 'ead.     'E sez 'e 'opes our lovin' will increase--   I LIKES that pilot fer the things 'e said.    'E sez Doreen an' me is in a boat,     An' sailin' on the matrimonial sea.   'E sez as 'ow 'e 'opes we'll allus float     In peace an' joy, from storm an' danger free.     Then muvver gits to weepin' in 'er tea;   An' Auntie Liz sobs like a winded colt;     An' Cousin Lil comes 'round an' kisses me;   Until I feel I'll 'AVE to do a bolt.    Then Ginger gits end-up an' makes a speech--     ('E'd 'ad a couple, but 'e wasn't shick.)   \"My cobber 'ere,\" 'e sez, \"'as copped a peach!     Of orl the barrer-load she is the pick!     I 'opes 'e won't fergit 'is pals too quick   As wus 'is frien's in olden days, becors,     I'm trustin', later on,\" sez Ginger Mick,   \"To celebrate the chris'nin'.\"...'Oly wars!    At last Doreen an' me we gits away,     An' leaves 'em doin' nothin' to the scran.   (We're honey-moonin' down beside the Bay.)     I gives a 'arf a dollar to the man     Wot drives the cab; an' like two kids we ran   To ketch the train--Ah, strike!  I could 'a' flown!     We gets the carridge right agen the van.   She whistles, jolts, an' starts...An' we're alone!    Doreen an' me!  My precious bit o' fluff!     Me own true weddid wife!...An' we're alone!   She seems so frail, an' me so big an' rough--     I dunno wot this feelin' is that's grown     Inside me 'ere that makes me feel I own   A thing so tender like I fear to squeeze     Too 'ard fer fear she'll break...Then, wiv a groan   I starts to 'ear a coot call, \"Tickets, please!\"    You could 'a' outed me right on the spot!     I wus so rattled when that porter spoke.   Fer, 'struth! them tickets I 'ad fair forgot!     But 'e jist laughs, an' takes it fer a joke.     \"We must ixcuse,\" 'e sez, \"new-married folk.\"   An' I pays up, an' grins, an' blushes red....   It shows 'ow married life improves a bloke:   If I'd bin single I'd 'a' punched 'is head!      XI.  Beef Tea     She never magged; she never said no word;   But sat an' looked at me an' never stirred.     I could 'a' bluffed it out if she 'ad been   Fair narked, an' let me 'ave it wiv 'er tongue;   But silence told me 'ow 'er 'eart wus wrung.         Poor 'urt Doreen!    Gorstruth!  I'd sooner fight wiv fifty men   Than git one look like that frum 'er agen!    She never moved; she never spoke no word;   That 'urt look in 'er eyes, like some scared bird:     \"'Ere is the man I loved,\" it seemed to say.   \"'E's mine, this crawlin' thing, an' I'm 'is wife;   Tied up fer good; an' orl me joy in life         Is chucked away!\"   If she 'ad bashed me I'd 'a felt no 'urt!   But 'ere she treats me like--like I wus dirt.    'Ow is a man to guard agen that look?   Fer other wimmin, when the'r blokes go crook,     An' lobs 'ome wiv the wages uv a jag,   They smashes things an' carries on a treat   An' 'owls an' scolds an' wakes the bloomin' street         Wiv noisy mag.   But 'er--she never speaks; she never stirs...   I drops me bundle...An' the game is 'ers.    Jist two months wed!  Eight weeks uv married bliss   Wiv my Doreen, an' now it's come to this!     Wot wus I thinkin' uv?  Gawd!  I ain't fit   To kiss the place 'er little feet 'as been!   'Er that I called me wife, me own Doreen!         Fond dreams'as flit;   Love's done a bunk, an' joy is up the pole;   An' shame an' sorrer's roostin' in me soul.    'Twus orl becors uv Ginger Mick--the cow!
