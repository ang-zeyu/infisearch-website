Once we shot more than thirty prisoners in our determination to punish three murderers.  And when we caught the Commissar of Borok, a sergeant tells me we left his body in the street, stripped, with sixteen bayonet wounds.  We surprised Borok, and the Commissar, a civilian, did not have time to arm himself.  The sergeant was quite exultant over it.  He killed Bolsheviki because they were barbarians and cruel.  This was the only thing his government had ever told him as to why they should be killed.  And the only safe way to fight barbarians is with their own methods.  The spoliation of scores of Russian villages and thousands of little farms, and the utter disorganization of the life and industry of a great section of the country with the attendant wanderings and sufferings of thousands of peasant-folk who had lost everything but life, are but the natural and necessary results of a military operation, and especially a weak and unsuccessful military operation such as this one was. One would hardly say, however, that it was necessary to close the school in order to use the schoolhouse for the storage of whisky, nor to put an entire Russian family into the street in order to make room for one officer, nor to loot personal property and ransack churches, nor to take so much whisky into the country that it could hardly be consumed when there was the greatest need for all kinds of merchandise, yet all these things were done, and acts of this kind are now outstanding features of the military \"helpfulness\" we went into so reluctantly.  We have been told about the employment by the Bolsheviki of Chinese mercenaries, and the dreadfulness of this was much stressed in April, but in July, August, and September we were importing large numbers of Chinese to Archangel, dressing them in British uniforms, and training them for fighting the Bolsheviki.                                       *XV*                               *THE MUTINIES*   Early in the year there had been a few small defections of conscripted Russians at Shenkursk, Murmansk, and later at Toulgas, but the thing that broke loose in July when the Yankees had gone home and the new British army had come and started its big campaign was quite another matter.  At Troitsa, at Onega, at Pinega, at Obozerskaya, on the Vaga and on the Murmansk railroad our Russian soldiers mutinied, killed their officers, and went over to the Bolsheviki.  On six of our seven fronts these mutinies occurred.  They were evidently not concerted, not uniform in method, but spontaneous, having the same nature, and springing from the same causes.  There were some distinctive features about the Troitsa affair of July seventh.  The Dyer’s Battalion that mutinied here was composed of ex-Bolsheviki prisoners who had been given the option of joining our army or remaining prisoners of war, and who for obvious reasons had chosen to join the army.  This battalion had been fêted and honored in many ways, and the privilege of wearing the British name on their shoulders was supposed to give assurance of their loyalty to our army. We did not conceal our stupidity about the Bolsheviki from these men. We did not keep them from hearing the stories on which we had fed our men.  They saw the attitude of the English military toward the Russians and had learned the true state of Russian peasant feeling toward the military. They despised the name of the Slavo-British Legion that they wore.  On Troitsa’s fateful night they murdered five English officers and eight Russian officers and went over to the Bolsheviki.  We recaptured a considerable number of them and executed them.  Those that had not been in the mutiny we disarmed and put to labor.  We had lost heavily and by treachery. It was enough to get the wind up of anybody. It got ours up.  I heard many an Englishman say after that that he would never again trust any Russian anywhere.  He would not discriminate. They were all treacherous, ungrateful swine.  Every Russian was a Bolo. There was no longer possible any big coöperative campaign.  On the other fronts the mutinies were not of ex-Bolsheviki prisoners but of the \"mobilized\" conscripts who had never been tainted by Bolshevist theories or ideals and whose defection is therefore of greater significance.  These men were the peasant inhabitants of North Russia who had welcomed our advent at Archangel. They had been in a sense our hosts all winter. They had worked for us, driven our transport, sold us hay and potatoes, smoked our cigarettes, and hated our enemies.  But also they had told me in the spring that if the Americans went home the English, would have to go home too. Now they were murdering their officers, surrendering their positions to the enemy, refusing to advance, going over to the Bolsheviki in large numbers.  The British fought wonderfully well under these trying circumstances. At every point except Onega they re-took all positions that had been lost by treachery.  They caught and shot traitors.  And they also shot all other Russian soldiers who were suspected of treason.  They did this with a brutality the details of which I will spare you, but not one item, of which escaped the Russian people.  The British wind was up.  They were soldiers, and prepared for any fight that might be in store for them.  But being shot in bed by your own men is not fighting.  It is not war. There was no question of courage involved. The army had courage enough.  But this was next to suicide, to go to the front leading traitors.  There was evidence one day on the railroad front that a new mutiny was brewing.  All the men of the suspected company were put on a train and then disarmed.  A guard went through the train and counted off the men, taking every tenth man outside to be shot without trial.  The men had not mutinied, but they might, and something had to be done.  I was told about another company of eighty Russians who were under suspicion at the same time.  The British officer in command gave them the option of declaring who the ringleaders were or being shot _en masse_.  Under the fear of this threat fifteen out of the eighty men were named and shot without trial.                                      *XVI*                               *THE DÉBÂCLE*   And so, there being nothing else possible, the débâcle began.  But it is a big job to get an expedition out of a country, much bigger than to get it in.  There were great quantities of munitions and supplies to be transported or destroyed.  There were fortifications to destroy, bridges to burn, railways to tear up, all fighting facilities to cripple.  There were civilians to evacuate, and all the service branches of the army, with all their vast and varied stores, to be disposed of.  And there was the enemy to be dealt with.  The thing simply couldn’t be done with any chance of success on all of those long fingers of this expedition until a smashing blow had been delivered to the Bolsheviki, both to reduce his morale and to increase your own, which had been so seriously impaired by the mutinies.  So a smashing blow was delivered successfully at one of the finger-points, costing us more men than any other fight in North Russia; and instanter the latest retreat from Moscow began. Now there was something quite peculiar about this retreat from the finger-points in North Russia.  We were not pursued.  The Bolsheviki knew we were going. In fact, they seemed to be remarkably well posted as to our plans. They were willing to have us go.  But they did not chase us out.  The Bolsheviki had little to do with causing this retreat.  This retreat was forced by the conscripted soldiers and people of North Russia, who wanted the English to go, and who were so sincere in this that they were willing to face all the dangers of the \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" commissar, and the unrestrained spite of every personal enemy, without English protection.  A school teacher who supposed himself to be on the Bolshevik black list, said to me in July, \"Our duty is to Russia.  The Bolsheviki may rule us or may kill us, but our duty is to Russia.  The English must go.\"  The Labor Congress, assembled at Solombola, passed resolutions urging the hasty withdrawal of the British and were at once disbanded by the army and charged with being Bolshevik propagandists.  But the retreat was on.  Every embassy received orders from home to leave with all its citizens, bag and baggage, and in the early days of September they went as from a pestilence, shipload after shipload, the Americans, the French, Italian, Chinese, Serbian, Japanese embassies, consulates of all sorts, Y.M.C.A., Y.W.C.A., military missions, bourgeois Russians, and any number of enterprising citizens of enterprising countries got out.  The military preceded, accompanied, followed. By September twentieth, the last British soldier was out and the washout was complete. We heard wild rumors that the Labor Congress continued to meet in spite of the army, that they turned upon the Russian military leaders, who are well-known to be monarchist in sympathy, and informed them that they must make peace with the Bolsheviki, and that there was some bad rioting in Solombola.  Two British soldiers had been beaten to death in the streets by Russians.  More Russians had been shot because they were suspected of Bolshevist sympathies. As our ships pulled out of the harbor great fires broke out in the vast lumber yards on both sides of the river, the laborers were charged with Bolshevik sabotage, and an enormous pall of black smoke hung for days over the scene of this most unfortunate expedition, a sinister emblem of the ruin and hatred that lay behind us, and a symbol of angry protest from the sky itself over our stupid failure to understand the Russian people.                                      *XVII*                      *MILITARY INTERVENTION FINANCE*   The financial contrivances of this "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/462"],["title","The Errand Boy; Or, How Phil Brent Won Success (#0)"],["body","ERRAND BOY;  OR, HOW PHIL BRENT WON SUCCESS.

Fred Sargent's Revenge.       The Smuggler's Trap.      THE ERRAND BOY.      CHAPTER I.  PHIL HAS A LITTLE DIFFICULTY.  Phil Brent was plodding through the snow in the direction of the house where he lived with his step-mother and her son, when a snow-ball, moist and hard, struck him just below his ear with stinging emphasis. The pain was considerable, and Phil's anger rose.  He turned suddenly, his eyes flashing fiercely, intent upon discovering who had committed this outrage, for he had no doubt that it was intentional.  He looked in all directions, but saw no one except a mild old gentleman in spectacles, who appeared to have some difficulty in making his way through the obstructed street.  Phil did not need to be told that it was not the old gentleman who had taken such an unwarrantable liberty with him. So he looked farther, but his ears gave him the first clew.  He heard a chuckling laugh, which seemed to proceed from behind the stone wall that ran along the roadside.  “I will see who it is,” he decided, and plunging through the snow he surmounted the wall, in time to see a boy of about his own age running away across the fields as fast as the deep snow would allow.  “So it's you, Jonas!” he shouted wrathfully. “I thought it was some sneaking fellow like you.”  Jonas Webb, his step-brother, his freckled face showing a degree of dismay, for he had not calculated on discovery, ran the faster, but while fear winged his steps, anger proved the more effectual spur, and Phil overtook him after a brief run, from the effects of which both boys panted.  “What made you throw that snow-ball?” demanded Phil angrily, as he seized Jonas by the collar and shook him.  “You let me alone!” said Jonas, struggling ineffectually in his grasp.  “Answer me! What made you throw that snowball?” demanded Phil, in a tone that showed he did not intend to be trifled with.  “Because I chose to,” answered Jonas, his spite getting the better of his prudence. “Did it hurt you?” he continued, his eyes gleaming with malice.  “I should think it might. It was about as hard as a cannon-ball,”  returned Phil grimly. “Is that all you've got to say about it?”  “I did it in fun,” said Jonas, beginning to see that he had need to be prudent.  “Very well! I don't like your idea of fun. Perhaps you won't like mine,”  said Phil, as he forcibly drew Jonas back till he lay upon the snow, and then kneeling by his side, rubbed his face briskly with snow.  “What are you doin'? Goin' to murder me?” shrieked Jonas, in anger and dismay.  “I am going to wash your face,” said Phil, continuing the operation vigorously.  “I say, you quit that! I'll tell my mother,” ejaculated Jonas, struggling furiously.  “If you do, tell her why I did it,” said Phil.  Jonas shrieked and struggled, but in vain. Phil gave his face an effectual scrubbing, and did not desist until he thought he had avenged the bad treatment he had suffered.  “There, get up!” said he at length.  Jonas scrambled to his feet, his mean features working convulsively with anger.  “You'll suffer for this!” he shouted.  “You won't make me!” said Phil contemptuously.  “You're the meanest boy in the village.”  “I am willing to leave that to the opinion of all who know me.”  “I'll tell my mother!”  “Go home and tell her!”  Jonas started for home, and Phil did not attempt to stop him.  As he saw Jonas reach the street and plod angrily homeward, he said to himself:  “I suppose I shall be in hot water for this; but I can't help it. Mrs. Brent always stands up for her precious son, who is as like her as can be. Well, it won't make matters much worse than they have been.”  Phil concluded not to go home at once, but to allow a little time for the storm to spend its force after Jonas had told his story. So he delayed half an hour and then walked slowly up to the side door. He opened the door, brushed off the snow from his boots with the broom that stood behind the door, and opening the inner door, stepped into the kitchen.  No one was there, as Phil's first glance satisfied him, and he was disposed to hope that Mrs. Brent--he never called her mother--was out, but a thin, acid, measured voice from the sitting-room adjoining soon satisfied him that there was to be no reprieve.  “Philip Brent, come here!”  Phil entered the sitting-room.  In a rocking-chair by the fire sat a thin woman, with a sharp visage, cold eyes and firmly compressed lips, to whom no child would voluntarily draw near.  On a sofa lay outstretched the hulking form of Jonas, with whom he had had his little difficulty.  “I am here, Mrs. Brent,” said Philip manfully.  “Philip Brent,” said Mrs. Brent acidly, “are you not ashamed to look me in the face?”  “I don't know why I should be,” said Philip, bracing himself up for the attack.  “You see on the sofa the victim of your brutality,” continued Mrs. Brent, pointing to the recumbent figure of her son Jonas.  Jonas, as if to emphasize these words, uttered a half groan.  Philip could not help smiling, for to him it seemed ridiculous.  “You laugh,” said his step-mother sharply. “I am not surprised at it. You delight in your brutality.”  “I suppose you mean that I have treated Jonas brutally.”  “I see you confess it.”  “No, Mrs. Brent, I do not confess it. The brutality you speak of was all on the side of Jonas.”  “No doubt,” retorted Mrs. Brent, with sarcasm.  “It's the case of the wolf and the lamb over again.”  “I don't think Jonas has represented the matter to you as it happened,”  said Phil. “Did he tell you that he flung a snow-ball at my head as hard as a lump of ice?”  “He said he threw a little snow at you playfully and you sprang upon him like a tiger.”  “There's a little mistake in that,” said Phil. “The snow-ball was hard enough to stun me if it had hit me a little higher. I wouldn't be hit like that again for ten dollars.”  “That ain't so! Don't believe him, mother!” said Jonas from the sofa.  “And what did you do?” demanded Mrs. Brent with a frown.  “I laid him down on the snow and washed his face with soft snow.”  “You might have given him his death of cold,” said Mrs. Brent, with evident hostility. “I am not sure but the poor boy will have pneumonia now, in consequence of your brutal treatment.”  “And you have nothing to say as to his attack upon me?” said Phil indignantly.  “I have no doubt you have very much exaggerated it.”  “Yes, he has,” chimed in Jonas from the sofa.  Phil regarded his step-brother with scorn.  “Can't you tell the truth now and then, Jonas?” he asked contemptuously.  “You shall not insult my boy in my presence!” said Mrs. Brent, with a little spot of color mantling her high cheek-bones. “Philip Brent, I have too long endured your insolence. You think because I am a woman you can be insolent with impunity, but you will find yourself mistaken. It is time that you understood something that may lead you to lower your tone. Learn, then, that you have not a cent of your own. You are wholly dependent upon my bounty.”  “What! Did my father leave you all his money?” asked Philip.  “He was NOT your father!” answered Mrs. Brent coldly.    CHAPTER II.  A STRANGE REVELATION.  Philip started in irrepressible astonishment as these words fell from the lips of his step-mother. It seemed to him as if the earth were crumbling beneath his feet, for he had felt no more certain of the existence of the universe than of his being the son of Gerald Brent.  He was not the only person amazed at this declaration. Jonas, forgetting for the moment the part he was playing, sat bolt upright on the sofa, with his large mouth wide open, staring by turns at Philip and his mother.  “Gosh!” he exclaimed in a tone indicating utter surprise and bewilderment.  “Will you repeat that, Mrs. Brent?” asked Philip, after a brief pause, not certain that he had heard aright.  “I spoke plain English, I believe,” said Mrs. Brent coldly, enjoying the effect of her communication.  “I said that Mr. Brent, my late husband, was not your father.”  “I don't believe you!” burst forth Philip impetuously.  “You don't wish to believe me, you mean,” answered his step-mother, unmoved.  “No, I don't wish to believe you,” said the boy, looking her in the eye.  “You are very polite to doubt a lady's word,” said Mrs. Brent with sarcasm.  “In such a matter as that I believe no one's word,” said Phil. “I ask for proof.”  “Well, I am prepared to satisfy you. Sit down and I will tell you the story.”  Philip sat down on the nearest chair and regarded his step-mother fixedly.  “Whose son am I,” he demanded, “if not Mr. Brent's?”  “You are getting on too fast. Jonas,” continued his mother, suddenly turning to her hulking son, on whose not very intelligent countenance there was an expression of greedy curiosity, “do you understand that what I am going to say is to be a secret, not to be spoken of to any one?”  “Yes'm,” answered Jonas readily.  “Very well. Now to proceed. Philip, you have heard probably that when you were very small your father--I mean Mr. Brent--lived in a small town in Ohio, called Fultonville?”  “Yes, I have heard him say so.”  “Do you remember in what business he was then engaged?”  “He kept a hotel.”  “Yes; a small hotel, but as large as the place required. He was not troubled by many guests. The few who stopped at his house were business men from towns near by, or drummers from the great cities, who had occasion to stay over a night. One evening, however, a gentleman arrived with an unusual companion--in other words, a boy of about three years of age. The boy had a bad cold, and seemed to need womanly care. Mr. Brent's wife----”  “My mother?”  “The woman you were taught to call mother,” corrected the second Mrs. Brent, “felt compassion for"]]]
