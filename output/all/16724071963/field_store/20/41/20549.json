They already had power to work mighty miracles, but had not the power to build up the kingdom of God. This power they were to tarry for in Jerusalem, and when they should receive it, they were then to commence the duties of their mission, first, in the city of Jerusalem, and afterwards extend their labours to all nations. The power to work miracles is entirely a different thing from the power to build up the kingdom of God; the latter power, however, always includes the former, but the former power does not always include the latter.  We now ask, Where is there a man among all the churches of modern times, who has been called to the office of an apostle by _new revelation?_ Where is there a man among all the millions of modern christians who has been ordained to the office of an apostle, under the hands of an apostle, as the Twelve were anciently? Where is there a man to be found among all the Catholics or Protestants who has been endowed with even the power of working miracles, to say nothing of the still greater power communicated in the gift of the Holy Ghost? If the apostles in ancient days could not build up the kingdom of God, without being endowed with these two degrees of power, surely no one since their day could be authorized to build the church of God with any less qualification.  One of the important duties required of an apostle is to ADMINISTER THE SPIRIT. In 2 Cor. iii 6, we read that both Paul and Timothy were made \"_able ministers_\" \"_of the Spirit_.\" The ordinance through which the Spirit is ministered is THE LAYING ON OF HANDS. (Acts viii. and xix. Heb. vi.) To the apostles were entrusted three very important administrations for the salvation of man:--  First.--_The ministration of the word_.  Second.--_The ministration of the baptism of water_.  And Third.--_The ministration of the baptism of the Spirit_.  While Jesus was with his apostles in person, they had power to minister the _word_ and _water,_ but not the _Spirit_, for they themselves had not yet been baptized with the Spirit; and they could not administer that which they were not in possession of. It was necessary that they should first receive the gift themselves, before they could confer it upon others. Hence we can perceive the propriety of Jesus commanding them to wait \"at Jerusalem until they should be endued with power from on high;\" for without this additional power they could neither save themselves nor others. Many persons have flattered themselves, that they can be saved without the assistance of a minister sent of God. But this is a vain delusive hope; for Jesus hath expressly said, \"Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit he _cannot_ enter the kingdom of God.\" Now as no man can be saved out of the kingdom, it is necessary that he should be \"born\" into the kingdom; and this would be impossible without an administrator sent of God; for the birth or baptism of water, and the birth or baptism of the Spirit, require some one legally authorized to officiate in behalf of the candidate.  Reader, have you ever received the Holy Ghost through the laying on of the hands of one sent of God? If not, you are not yet born of the spirit. You are not yet a child of the kingdom. Know assuredly, that unless you find some man who has been sent by the command of God as was Aaron, and get him to remit your sins through your faith, repentance, and baptism, and have him to minister to you the Holy Ghost, as did the ancient apostles--you need not flatter yourself that you can be saved. Do not deceive yourself upon this all-important subject. Do not suffer any man to baptize or administer unto you unless God has spoken unto him by the voice of his servants, and authorized him to minister in his name. Do you enquire how you are to know an authorized man of God from one who has no authority? I will tell you how to discern the difference. A true servant of God will never teach a false doctrine. He will never deny new revelation. He never will tell you that the canon of scripture is full, or that the New Testament is the last revelation ever intended to be given to man. He never will tell you, that miraculous gifts are no longer necessary in the church of God. He never will tell you, that inspired apostles, prophets, and other officers are not requisite in the church now. He never will tell you that the \"_ministration of the spirit_\" by \"the laying on of hands,\" is done away by God's appointment. But he will tell you, that if you will receive his message, and be baptized by one having authority, that your \"_sins shall be remitted_,\" and that you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; and that you shall know, by the teachings thereof, that his doctrine is true and of God. In this respect he will differ from all impostors; for an impostor never had power to \"_minister this spirit_.\" An imposter dare not promise you that you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost by the laying on of his hands; for he knows that such a promise would not be fulfilled--he knows that you would detect him to be a false teacher by complying with his conditions, and failing to receive his promise. An impostor, knowing that he has no power to give the Holy Ghost as the ancient apostles had, will endeavour to persuade you that such power is not necessary now. He knows very well, that if he cannot get the people to believe that such power is not necessary in these days, that his own unauthorized pretensions will be at once detected.  An impostor, like Simon Magus, may deceive ignorant people by witchcraft and sorcery, but he can never deceive them by pretending to give the Holy Ghost through prayer and laying on of hands. This is a power that none but a true minister of God possesses; it cannot be counterfeited by the devil. The devil can counterfeit the miracles of Christ, but he cannot counterfeit the gift of the Holy Ghost. None but the lawful ministers of Christ can minister the spirit. This then is an infallible sign by which to distinguish true apostles from false ones. But does this infallible sign exist either among the Papists or Protestants? Can any of their ministers give the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands? If not, they are not the church of God, and their ministers are unauthorized--all their administrations are illegal and an abomination in the sight of God--salvation is not among them. Not one person among all their societies has been legally baptized. Reader, are you a member of any of these societies? if so, haste to withdraw yourself from them, that you partake not of their plagues, _for the hour of their judgment is come_. If you would be saved, seek after the apostles and prophets of the kingdom of God, and receive their administrations, and you shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, and obtain eternal life.  15, _Wilton Street_, _October_ 31, 1848  * * * *  R.

[Illustration: KEY TO \"THE YPRES SALIENT.\" By W. L. WYLIE, R.A.]                         *PREFATORY NOTE ON THE SALIENT*   On October 16th, 1914, the Ypres Salient, the theatre of three of the most deadly and critical battles in this War, was born. Up to that date the area it comprises--a few thousand acres at most--was merely a tract of well-tilled Flemish meadowland, with patches of forest and here and there a village or hamlet.  Ten weeks before the Germans had invaded Belgium, and in the fateful and anxious time which followed, the Belgians had been pressed slowly back, those who had not been utterly crushed.  Antwerp fell, and a mighty German host, foiled in its advance southward to Paris, was moving relentlessly towards the sea-coast, destroying and desolating the land as it came.  A newly-landed British force advanced to check them and to take up a position in the long line of Allied troops.  This force, the 7th Division, under Major-General Capper, and the 3rd Cavalry Division, commanded by Major-General the Hon. Julian Byng, marching through the quaint old Flemish city of Ypres, penetrated to a point six miles beyond the British, French, and Belgian alignment as it ran north and south. There they halted, their ranks causing the Allied front to project forward a bold \"salient,\" or peninsula, on the map.  To crush that salient--to flatten out that line at any cost--instantly became the aim of the enemy.  Consequently, he flung himself on the point of the Salient (which was then Becelaere) and the fierce and bloody First Battle of Ypres was the result.  It lasted from October 20th to November 11th.  On October 30th the Kaiser told his troops that they must break through the line to Ypres, and to the Bavarian Crown Prince he said: \"Take Ypres, or die.\"  He considered the attack to be \"of vital importance to the successful issue of the war.\"  It was then that we became familiar with the names of these little villages and hamlets, first drenched with blood and then crumbled to dust, Zonnebeke, Zillebeke, Wytschaete, Hooge, Langemarcke, and the rest; with those fields, woods, and hillocks which have then and since seen some of the most terrible slaughter and the most gallant deeds in all military history, and where lie to-day more than one hundred thousand of our British dead.  The enemy recoiled, bruising his legions against the sharpness of the Salient, and his failure marked a notable stage in the progress of the War.  For six months the two hostile armies faced one another in the crescent line of trenches defending Ypres towards the east. Spring came, and on April 22nd the Second Battle of Ypres began, lasting until May 13th, only two days less than the first.  In that second action the Canadians won deathless renown.  They had then only a single division at the front, commanded by Lieutenant-General Alderson, and at the end of February were entrusted with the task of defending the north-eastern segment of the Salient.  Two days before the battle the bombardment of Ypres re-began--a bombardment which did not cease until the picturesque little city was a shapeless heap of ruins.  While the shells rained upon Ypres, the Germans let loose the hideous fumes of poison gas upon the French trenches, causing a four mile breach in the line, into which the foe came pouring.  But the Canadians, staggering under the crushing weight of the artillery assault, held firm.  Although the losses of the British were appalling, and the Salient was blunted a little, the path to Calais through Ypres was still barred.  In the thirteen months which followed there was constant bombardment and much intermittent fighting, sometimes, as at St. Eloi last March, fierce and bloody.  But the Salient was held fast; more and more was it consecrated by heroic deeds, as        A corner of a foreign field     That is for ever England.   \"When,\" wrote a gifted English chronicler,[#] many months ago, \"the War is over, this triangle of meadowland, with a ruined city for its base, will be an enclave of Belgian soil consecrated as the holy land of two great peoples.  It may be that it will be specially set apart as a memorial place; it may be that it will be unmarked, and that the countryfolk will till and reap as before over the vanishing trench lines.  But it will never be common ground.  It will be for us the most hallowed spot on earth, for it holds our bravest dust, and it is the proof and record of a new spirit. In the past, when we have thought of Ypres, we have thought of the British flag preserved there, which Clare’s Regiment, fighting for France, captured at the Battle of Ramillies; the name of the little Flemish town has recalled the divisions in our own race and the centuries-old conflict between France and Britain.  But from now and henceforth it will have other memories. It will stand as a symbol of unity and alliance, unity within our Empire, unity within our Western civilisation, that true alliance and that lasting unity which are won and sealed by a common sacrifice.\"   [#] Mr. John Buchan.   Once again, foiled in his designs on Verdun, the greatest battlefield of the War, the enemy, perhaps for the last time, sought to wrest this sacred ground, the Ypres Salient and Ypres itself from our hands.  This time the Canadians had three divisions in the fighting-line. The Corps commander, on the 2nd of June last, when the German fury burst forth anew, was that same General (now Sir) Julian Byng who had first, in October, 1914, at the head of his cavalry troops, marked out the frontiers of the Salient.  What happened in this Third Battle, which began on June 2nd, and may be said to have finished June 16th, when we regained the ground lost at the outset, is imperfectly related in the following pages.  It was written from day to day by one who was on the spot, and so may serve to convey to the reader something of the spirit with which our Canadians fought, and may also suggest a reason for their pride in having again successfully held the Salient against the foe.  _It is said that Ypres and the Salient are chiefly retained for sentimental reasons.  This is true, in the sense that this whole War was avowedly waged, in the first instance, for sentimental reasons._  _Not long ago a French general said to me that the Germans were attacking Verdun, and the French were defending it, not for strategical, but for political and dynastic reasons.  \"If they took Verdun to-morrow, they could not advance, but to lose Verdun would be for France a blow over the heart.\"_  _If we have pledged our honour to Belgium, we are pledged to the hilt to guard the soil of Ypres inviolate from the heel of the living enemy. It is only a heap of ruins, but it is an eternal memorial of British valour.  It is only a shell-swept graveyard, but the graves are those of our heroic dead._  _To abandon Ypres now would tarnish our banners.  It would be like offering our sister for violation because she had been bruised and buffeted with stones._  _Military strategy very properly takes into account political and moral prestige, and to \"straighten out the Salient\" by the voluntary abandonment of a single mile of ground would inflict upon us a moral and political loss equal to an army corps.  If Ypres goes, Belgium goes, and if Belgium goes, whatever the final issue, something of glory passes from the Allied arms._  _It is a terrible responsibility to stand steadfast, but every soldier who has died in the Ypres Salient has yielded his life to protect his country’s honour.
