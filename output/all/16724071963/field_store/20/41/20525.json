The proofs I refer to are the edicts themselves, considered in the light of the well-known cruelty of the Roman people, intensified by the malice of religious zeal aroused to suppress an obnoxious society whose doctrines were held to be destructive of the ancient religion of Rome, and a menace to the existence of the state itself.  Passing by the persecutions inflicted upon the Christians by the Jews, an account of which is to be found in the New Testament, I call attention to the first great pagan persecution under the cruel edict of the Emperor Nero. For our information in respect to this persecution we are indebted not to any Christian writer, but to the judicious Tacitus, whom even \"the most sceptical criticism is obliged to respect.\" [5] Nero having set on fire the city of Rome, in order that he might witness a great conflagration, and wishing to divert suspicion from himself, first accused and then tried to compel the Christians to confess the great crime--and now Tacitus:  \"With this view he inflicted the most exquisite tortures on those men who, under the vulgar appellation of Christians, were already branded with deserved infamy. They derived their name and origin from Christ, who, in the reign of Tiberius had suffered death by the sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate. For awhile this dire superstition was checked; but it again burst forth; and not only spread itself over Judea, the first seat of this mischievous sect, but was even introduced into Rome, the common asylum which receives and protects whatever is impure, whatever is atrocious. The confessions of those that were seized discovered a great multitude of their accomplices, and they were all convicted, not so much for the crime of setting fire to the city, as for their hatred of human kind. They died in torments, and their torments were embittered by insults and derision. Some were nailed on crosses; others sewn up in the skins of wild beasts, and exposed to the fury of dogs; others, again, smeared over with combustible materials, were used as torches to illuminate the darkness of the night. The gardens of Nero were destined for the melancholy spectacle, which was accompanied with a horse-race, and honored with the presence of the emperor, who mingled with the populace in the dress and attitude of a charioteer. The guilt of the Christians deserved indeed the most exemplary punishments, but the public abhorrence was changed into commiseration, from the opinion that those unhappy wretches were sacrificed, not so much to the public welfare as to the cruelty of a jealous tyrant.\" [6]  Eminent scholars are divided in opinion as to whether this persecution under Nero extended to the provinces or was confined to the city of Rome. Gibbon assumes that it was both brief and confined to the city. According to Milman \"M. Guizot, on the authority of Suplicious Severus and of Orosius inclines to the opinion of those who extend the persecution to the provinces. Mosheim rather leans to that side on this much disputed question. Neander takes the view of Gibbon, which is, in general, that of the most learned writers.\" [7]  This controversy need not detain us a moment. It matters not to my purpose whether the edicts of Nero extended to the provinces or were limited in their operations to the Christians within the capital. The testimony of Tacitus is sufficient to prove, first, that the persecution was general within the city; second its terrible cruelty; and third, the great abhorrence in which the Christians were held by the Romans.  I submit to the consideration of the reader that a people so greatly detested as the Christians, were not likely to meet with gentle treatment from the Romans; and when, as subsequently it came to pass, the people clamored for the sacrifice of the saints whom they abhorred as the enemies of mankind, instead of looking upon them with commiseration as the citizens of Rome did in their persecution under Nero--when the Roman people, I say, clamored for the sacrifice of the Christians and the emperors were cruel enough, and unjust enough to issue edicts for their destruction, the persecutions of those times were neither so limited nor so free from severity as Gibbon and others would have us believe. Even in this persecution under Nero, if no edicts were sent into the provinces commanding the execution of Christians, it is not unreasonable to believe that the despisers of the followers of Christ, finding warrant for their conduct by what was taking place at Rome, under the supervision of the emperor himself, would not hesitate to inflict hardships upon the saints without the formality of his proclamation.  It was this unofficial persecution which, without doubt, arose in the provinces as an indirect result of the persecution in the capital, that has led a number of prominent writers to believe that Nero's persecution extended throughout the empire. However that may be, a \"great multitude\" suffered in the city of Rome, and were subject to such tortures and cruel modes of death--described, mark you, by the unfriendly Tacitus--that little is left to be added even by the fervid imaginations of the Christian fathers. It is reasonable to believe that the subsequent persecutions were not freer from cruelty than this one under Nero; and therefore, though some allowance must be made for exaggeration in the writings of the Christian fathers, it may be safely concluded that those persecutions which preceded the reign of Constantine were both widespread and horribly cruel.  What is usually denominated the third persecution of the Christian Church occurred in the reign of Trajan, 98--117 A. D. Here, as in the persecution under Nero, we may determine something of the severity and manner of it from a Roman writer. Trajan intrusted the government of Bithynia and Pontius to his personal friend, the younger Pliny. The new governor, in his administration of the affairs of his provinces, found himself perplexed as to what course he should pursue in regard to the Christians brought before him for trial. He accordingly wrote to his master for instruction; and I deem his letter of such importance as showing the severity to which Christians were subject, the character of the Christians, and the number of unfaithful members who had evidently entered the church by that time, that I give it _in extenso_:  \"Health.--It is my usual custom, sir, to refer all things, of which I harbor any doubts, to you. For who can better direct my judgment in its hesitation, or instruct my understanding in its ignorance? I never had the fortune to be present at any examination of Christians, before I came into this province. I am, therefore, at a loss, to determine what is the usual object either of inquiry or of punishment, and to what length either of them is to be carried. It has also been with me a question very problematical, whether any distinction should be made between the young and the old, the tender and the robust; whether any room should be given for repentance, or the guilt of Christianity, once incurred is not to be expiated by the most unequivocal retraction; whether the name itself, abstracted from any flagitiousness of conduct, or the crimes connected with the name, be the object of punishment. In the meantime, this has been my method, with respect to those who were brought before me as Christians: If they pleaded guilty, I interrogated them twice afresh, with a menace of capital punishment. In case of obstinate perseverance, I ordered them to be executed. For of this I had no doubt, whatever was the nature of their religion, that a sullen and obstinate inflexibility called for the vengeance of the magistrate. Some who were infected with the same madness whom, on account of their privilege of citizenship, I reserve to be sent to Rome, to be referred to your tribunal. In the course of this business, information pouring in, as is usual when they are encouraged, more cases occurred. An anonymous libel was exhibited, with a catalogue of names of persons, who yet declared they were not Christians then or ever had been; and they repeated after me an invocation of the gods and of your image, which for this purpose I had ordered to be brought with the images of the deities. They performed sacred rites with wine and frankincense, and execrated Christ, none of which things I am told a real Christian can ever be compelled to do. On this account I dismissed them. Others named by an informer, first affirmed and then denied the charge of Christianity, declaring that they had been Christians, but had ceased to be so, some three years ago, others still longer, some even twenty years ago. All of them worshiped your image, and the statues of the gods, and also execrated Christ. And this was the account which they gave of the nature of their religion they once professed, whether it deserves the name of crime or error, namely, that they were accustomed on a stated day to meet before daylight, and repeat among themselves a hymn to Christ as to a god, and to bind"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46208"],["title","A Voice from Jerusalem (#0)"],["body","http://mormontextsproject.org/ for a complete list of Mormon texts available on Project Gutenberg, to help proofread similar books, or to report typos.

The circumstances which gave rise to this mission of Elder Hyde are quite peculiar and extraordinary; and in an American publication are thus described by himself: \"Something near eight years ago, Joseph Smith, a prophet and servant of the Most High God, did predict upon my head, that I should yet go to the city of Jerusalem, and be a watchman unto the house of Israel, and perform a work there which would greatly facilitate the gathering together of that people: the particulars of which it is not necessary to mention here.  \"Year after year has passed away since that period, and my labours in the ministry have been confined to the Gentiles on both sides of the Atlantic.  \"In the early part of March last (1840), I retired to my bed one evening as usual, and while contemplating and enquiring out, in my own mind, the field of my ministerial labours for the then coming season, the vision of the Lord, like clouds of light, burst upon my view. The cities of London, Amsterdam, Constantinople, and Jerusalem all appeared in succession before me, and the Spirit said unto me, 'Here are many of the children of Abraham whom I will gather to the land that I gave to their fathers, and here also is the field of your labours.'  \"A strict observance of the movements of the Jews, and a careful examination of their faith relative to their expected Messiah--the setting up of his kingdom among them, and the overthrow of the present kingdoms and governments of the Gentiles, will serve to open the eyes of many of the uncircumcised, when faithfully laid before them, that the great day of the Lord comes not upon them unawares as a thief.  \"Take, therefore, proper credentials from my people, your brethren, and also from the governor of your state, with the seal of authority thereon, and go ye forth to the cities which have been shown unto you, and declare these words unto Judah, and say: 'Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, gather together; and say, assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities. Let the standard be reared towards Zion. Retire! stay not; for I will bring evil from the north and a great destruction. The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way, he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate, and thy cities shall be laid waste without inhabitant. Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished--that her iniquity is pardoned, for she hath received at the Lord's hand double for all her sins. Let your warning voice be heard among the Gentiles as you pass, and call ye upon them in my name for aid and for assistance. With you it mattereth not whether it be little or much; but to me it belongeth to shew favour unto them who show favour unto you. Murmur not, therefore, neither be ye sorrowful that the people are slow to hear your petition; but do as has been told you. All things shall work together for your good if you are humble and keep my commandments; for it must needs be that all men be left without excuse, that a righteous retribution may be awarded to all.'  \"Many other things were shown and told me in the vision which will be made public at the proper time and places. The vision continued open for a number of hours, that I did not close my eyes in sleep.\"  In obedience to the foregoing, Elder Hyde proceeded to lay the circumstances before the authorities of the church, and before the governor of the state of Illinois, who gave their hearty sanction to the mission, and from whom he obtained the following documents:      _Letter of commendation from the Conference at Nauvoo, to Elders     Orson Hyde and John E. Page, appointing and confirming their     appointment to the work whereunto they have been called._      \"To all people unto whom these presents shall come, GREETING.      Be it known that we, the constituted authorities of the Church of     Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, assembled in Conference, at     Nauvoo, Hancock county, and State of Illinois, on this sixth day     of April, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and     forty, consider an important event at hand--an event involving the     interest and fate of the Gentile nations throughout the world.     From the signs of the times, and from declarations contained in     the oracles of God, we are forced to come to this conclusion. The     Jewish nation have been scattered abroad among the Gentiles for a     long period; and, in our estimation, the time of the commencement     of their return to the \"holy land\" has already arrived.      As this scattered and persecuted people are set among the Gentiles     as a sign unto them of the second coming of the Messiah, and also,     of the overthrow of the present kingdoms and governments of the     earth by the potency of his Almighty arm, in scattering famine and     pestilence like the frosts and snows of winter, and in sending     the sword, with nation against nation to bathe it in each others     blood; it his highly important, in our opinion, that the present     views and movements of the Jewish people be sought after, and laid     before the American people for their consideration, their profit     and their learning; feeling it to be our duty to employ the most     efficient means in our power to save the children of men from the     \"abomination that maketh desolate,\" we have, by the counsel of     the Holy Spirit, appointed Elders Orson Hyde and John E. Page,     the bearers of these presents, faithful and worthy ministers of     Jesus Christ, to be our agents and representatives in foreign     lands, to visit the cities of London, Amsterdam, Constantinople and     Jerusalem, and also other places which they may deem expedient;     to converse with the priests, rulers, and elders of the Jews, and     obtain from them all the information possible; and communicate the     same to some principal papers for publication, that it may have a     general circulation throughout the United States.      As Messrs. Hyde and Page have willingly and cheerfully accepted     the appointment to become our servants and the servants of the     public in distant and foreign countries for Christ's sake, we do     confidently recommend them to all religious and christian people,     and to ladies and gentlemen making no profession, as worthy     members of society, possessing much zeal to promote the happiness     of mankind; fully believing that they will be forward to render     them all the pecuniary aid they need, to accomplish this laborious     and hazardous mission, for the general good of the human family.     Ministers of every denomination upon whom these gentlemen shall     call, are requested to hold up their hands, and aid them by their     influence, with an assurance that such as do this shall have the     prayers and blessings of a \"poor and an afflicted people,\" who have     tested the depths of their sincerity, and love for their religion,     by the sacrifice of their blood upon a land, shadowed by the     stripes and stars of political and religious liberty.      Given under our hands at the time and place before mentioned.\"      (Signed) JOSEPH SMITH, JR., CHAIRMAN. ROBERT B. THOMPSON, Clerk.      * * * *      From the Governor of Illinois.
