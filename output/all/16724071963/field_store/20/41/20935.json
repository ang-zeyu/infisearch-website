She thanked the lady very warmly for her kindness, and promising to come at the time stated, she took her leave.  She was followed to the door by Grace, who detained her there.  \"Katy, I am sure you are a very good little girl, and here is a dollar for you. It will buy something good for your mother.\"  \"I thank you very much, Miss Gordon. I am poor, but proud, like my mother,\" replied she, as a flush of shame mantled her cheek.  \"What a foolish little girl!\" laughed Grace. \"Take it; you will oblige me very much by taking it.\"  \"No, ma'am, I can't; my mother wouldn't own me if I should take money as a gift.\"  \"But you must take it, Katy; I shall be angry if you don't.\"  The little girl looked up into her pretty eyes beaming with pity and love; and she could hardly resist the temptation to oblige her by accepting the gift; but since she had heard the story of her mother's life, she understood why she was so much prouder than other poor people; and as she thought of her grandfather in his fine house in the great city of Liverpool, she felt a little of the same spirit--she too was poor and proud. Besides, as Grace jingled the two half dollars together, there was a harmony in the sound that suggested a great heap of good things for her mother. And there was another powerful consideration that weighed with great force upon her mind. One of those half dollars would be a sufficient capital upon which to commence her candy speculation. It would buy ever so much molasses of the very best quality. As she thought of this, she was disposed, at least, to compromise with Miss Grace.  \"I cannot accept the money as a gift, but you may lend it to me, if you please,\" said Katy, after she had reflected a moment.  \"Just as you like,\" laughed Grace; \"but I shall not feel bad if you never pay me.\"  \"I shall certainly pay it again,\" persisted the embryo candy merchant. \"I would not take it if I thought I could not.\"  \"Very well; but you must know I think you are a very singular little girl.\"  \"I am poor and proud; that's all.\"  Katy took the loan, and with her fancy fired with brilliant expectations in regard to the candy operation, ran home to her mother as fast as her feet would carry her. Mrs. Redburn was much displeased with her at first for what she had done. Her pride revolted at the thought of begging a favor; but Katy explained the matter so well that she was satisfied, though nothing was said about the loan she had obtained.  Punctually at the appointed hour came Dr. Flynch for the rent.  \"Have you got the money?\" he demanded in his usual bland tones, though Katy thought she could see a wicked purpose in his little gray eye.  \"No, sir; but----\"  \"That's all I desire to know, Mrs. Redburn,\" interrupted the agent. \"You must leave the house.\"  \"But, sir, I have something that will do as well as the money,\" added the sick woman.  \"Have you, indeed?\" sneered Dr. Flynch \"I think not.\"  \"Will you read that, sir?\" said Katy, handing him Mrs. Gordon's receipt.  The agent took the paper, and as he read, the wonted serenity of his brow was displaced by a dark scowl. His threats had been disregarded, and he had been reported to his employer.  \"So you have been fawning and cringing upon Mrs. Gordon,\" growled he. \"Probably you have told her more lies than you dared tell me.\"  \"I told her nothing but the truth, and she sent her man down here to find out all about us, said Katy, smartly.  \"Very well; this paper will only delay the matter for a few days; when I have exposed you to her, she will acquiesce in my views;\" and Dr. Flynch threw down the receipt and left the house.  \"We are well rid of him, at any rate,\" said Katy.  \"Now I will get you some dinner, for I must be at Mrs. Gordon's at three o'clock; and I want to tell you about my plan too, mother.\"  The active little girl made a cup of tea for her mother, and the dinner was soon dispatched.    CHAPTER VI.  KATY PREPARES A STOCK OF MERCHANDISE.  Katy had not time then to tell her mother about the candy speculation she had in view, and she was obliged to wait till her return from Temple Street. Promptly at the hour, she presented herself at Mrs. Gordon's, and they went to the house of the mayor; but that distinguished gentleman was not at home, and the lady promised to go again with her the next day.  As she walked home, she thought of what she should say to her mother in favor of the candy project, for she felt sure her mother's pride would throw many obstacles in her path. The best argument she could think of was, that the business would be an honest calling and though she was too proud to beg, she was not too proud to work, or to take a very humble position among the people around her. She did not look upon the act of selling candy to the passers-by in the streets as degrading in itself, and therein she differed very widely from her mother, who had been brought up in ease and affluence. Before she got home she had made up her mind what she should say, and how she should defend her plan from the assaults of pride.  \"Now, mother, you shall hear my plan,\" she continued, after she had announced the ill success of her visit to the mayor's house. \"I am going into business, and I expect to make a great deal of money.\"  \"Are you, indeed?\" replied Mrs. Redburn, smiling at the enthusiasm of her daughter.  \"I am; and you must not be angry with me, or object very much to my plan.\"  \"Well, what is your plan?\"  \"I am going to sell candy,\" said Katy, pausing to notice the effect of this startling declaration. \"You know what nice molasses candy you used to make for me. Mrs. Sneed and Mrs. Colvin said a great many times that it was a good deal better than they could buy at the shops.\"  \"But, child, I am not able to make candy now. I cannot get off my bed.\"  \"I will make it; you shall lay there and tell me how. I am sure I can make it.\"  \"It is very hard work to pull it.\"  \"I won't mind that.\"  \"Suppose you can make it, how will you sell it?\" asked Mrs. Redburn, casting an anxious glance at the enthusiastic little girl.  \"O, I shall take a box, and offer it to the folks that pass along the streets.\"  \"Are you crazy, Katy?\" exclaimed the mother, raising her head on the bed. \"Do you think I could permit you to do such a thing?\"  \"Why not, mother?\"  \"What a life for a child to lead! Do you think I could let you wander about the streets exposed to the insults and rude jests of the vicious and thoughtless? You do not understand what you propose.\"  \"I think I do, mother. I don't see any harm in selling candy to those who are willing to buy.\"  \"Perhaps there is no harm in the mere act of selling candy; but what a life for you to lead! It makes me shudder to think of it.\"  \"It is your pride, mother.\"  \"I am thankful I have: some pride left, Katy.\"  \"But mother, we can't be poor and proud. We haven't got any money to proud with.\"  \"I am proud, I know; I wish I could banish it,\" replied Mrs. Redburn, with a deep sigh.  \"Let me try the plan, mother, and if I can't get along with it, I will give it up.\"  \"It will subject you to a great many trials and temptations.\"  \"I can manage them, mother.\"  \"Can you submit to the insults of evil-minded persons?\"  \"Yes, mother; no decent person would insult me and I don't care for others. I can pity them, and run away from them. I am not afraid of anything. Do let me try.\"  Mrs. Redburn saw that Katy was too earnest to be thwarted; that, impelled by a noble purpose, she had set her heart upon making the attempt, and she did not like to disappoint her. It is true, she keenly felt the degradation of such a life, and even feared that Katy might be led astray while pursuing such an occupation; but she gave a reluctant consent, trusting that one or two experiments would disgust her with the business.  Katy clapped her hands with joy as her mother's scruples gave way, and she found herself at liberty to carry her plan into execution. It seemed to her as though she had crossed the threshold of fortune and had actually entered the great temple. She had an opportunity to accomplish a great work, and her enthusiasm would not permit her to doubt in regard to her final success.  \"I must begin now, mother, and make all the candy this afternoon, so that I can commence selling it early to-morrow morning. I will go to the grocery now and get the molasses.\"  \"Poor child; you have nothing to get it with. We have no money; you did not think of that.\"  \"Yes, I did, and I have the money to buy the molasses. I borrowed it,\" replied Katy, evincing some confusion.  \"You borrowed it? Pray who would lend you money?\"  \"Miss Grace Gordon.\"  \"Did you borrow it, Katy?\" asked Mrs. Redburn, casting a reproachful glance at her.  \"Yes, mother, I did. I would not accept money now, after what you have said to me. Miss Grace wanted to give it to me; but I told her I could not take it. She laughed at me, and I said I was poor and proud. She would make me take it, and said so much, that, at last, I told her if she would lend it to me, I would take it.\"  \"It was the same as a gift,\" said Mrs. Redburn, blushing with shame at the thought of accepting alms.  \"No, it wasn't; she may think it was, but I mean to pay her, and I shall pay her; I know I shall.\"  \"If you can,\" sighed the proud mother.  \"I shall be able to pay her soon, for I mean to sell lots of candy.\"  \"You may be disappointed.\"  \"No: I am sure I shall sell a good deal; I mean to make people buy. I shall talk up smart to them just as the shopkeepers do; I am going to tell them what candy it is, and that their little sons and daughters will like it very much.\"  \"You are beside yourself, Katy. It pains me to hear you talk so. It is sad to think a child of mine should relish such an employment as that in which you are going to engage.\"  \"Do you remember the book my Sunday-school teacher gave me last New Year's day,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/484"],["title","Poor and Proud; Or, The Fortunes of Katy Redburn: A Story for Young Folks (#7)"],["body","her? It was all about false pride; I want you to read it, mother. We can't afford to be so proud.\"  \"Go and get your molasses. Katy,\" replied Mrs. Redburn, who could not but acknowledge the truth of her daughter's remarks.  She had read the book alluded to, and was not willing to confront the arguments it had put in the mouth of her child. She was conscious that her pride, which made a humble occupation repulsive to her, was a false pride. If it could have been carried on in private, it would not have seemed so galling. For years she had been a recluse from society, mingling only with her humble neighbors, and with them no more than her circumstances required. She had labored in solitude, and shunned observation as much as possible, by carrying her work back and forth in the evening. Years of hard toil had not familiarized her with the circumstances of her lot. She tried to be humble and submissive, but the memory of her early days could not be driven away.  Katy returned in a few minutes with the jug of molasses. She bustled round and made up a good fire, got the kettle on, and everything in readiness for the work. Her mother gave her directions how to proceed; but Katy could impart to her none of her own enthusiasm.  When the molasses had been cooked enough, she was ready to commence the pulling, which was the most difficult part in the manufacture of her merchandise. Then she found that her trials had indeed commenced. At first the sticky mass, in spite of the butter and the flour with which she had plentifully daubed her hands, was as obstinate as a mule. It would not work one way or another; now it melted down, and stuck to her fingers, and then it became as solid as a rock. She fretted some at these crosses, and as her spirits sank, her mother's rose, for she thought Katy's resolution would not hold out long enough for her to complete the experiment. But she underrated the energy of the devoted girl, who, in the face of every discouragement, stuck to the candy with as much zeal as the candy stuck to her.  As is almost always the case with those who persevere to the end, Katy soon won a partial triumph, which gladdened her heart, and gave her courage to continue her trying labors. She had worked a portion of the mass into candy--clear, light-colored, inviting candy. Columbus felt no prouder of his achievement when he had crossed the Atlantic, or, Napoleon when he had crossed the Alps. She danced for joy as she gazed upon the clear, straight sticks of candy, as they were arranged in the pan. It was a great conquest for her; but at what a sacrifice it had been won! Her little hands, unused to such hard work, were blistered in a dozen places, and smarted as though they had been scalded with boiling water. She showed them to her mother, who begged her not to do any more; but she had too much enthusiasm to be deterred by the smart of her wounds, and resolutely resumed her labor.  She had scarcely commenced upon the  second mass before she was interrupted by the entrance of Mrs. Howard, her friend Tommy's mother.  \"Why, what are you doing, child?\" asked the good woman. \"I thought you were all sick, and here you are making candy, as merry as on a feast day.\"  \"I am making it to sell, Mrs. Howard,\" replied Katy, proudly.  \"Bless me! but you're a queer child! Do you think folks will buy it of you?\"  \"I know they will;\" and Katy detailed her plan to the interested neighbor, declaring she was sure she could support her mother and herself by making and selling candy. \"But it is very hard work,\" she added; \"see how I've blistered my hands.\"  \"Poor child! it's enough to kill you!\" exclaimed Mrs. Howard, as she glanced at the great blisters on Katy's hands.  \"I have been trying to make her give up the idea, but she has more courage than I ever gave her credit for,\" remarked Mrs. Redburn.  \"It's a shame for you to hurt your hands in this manner; but I dare say that they will soon get hard, like mine, with the labor,\" replied Mrs. Howard, as she threw off her hood and rolled up her sleeves. \"Here, child, let me help you.\"  \"You are very kind, ma'am; and I hope I shall be able to do something for you some time.\"  \"Never you mind that; you are a nice girl, and it does my heart good to see you trying to help your mother,\" added the kind woman, as she detached a large mass of candy, and commenced pulling it with a vigor that astonished the weak-handed little girl. \"You're a jewel and a blessing, and you're worth a dozen of the fine ladies that are too proud to lift a finger to keep their bodies from starving. Ah, it's a dreadful misfortune to be proud.\"  \"To be poor and proud,\" said Mrs. Redburn.  \"You are right, ma'am; and I am glad to see you have none of it here; for some of your neighbors used to say you were too proud to speak to them.\"  Mrs. Redburn made no reply, and permitted her kind neighbor, whose tongue scarcely ceased to swing for a moment, to continue her remarks without opposition. She and Katy worked with all their might till the candy was ready for market, and when the poor invalid poured out her thanks, she ran off and left them.  The exultation with which Katy regarded her plentiful stock of merchandise almost caused her to forget her smarting hands; and when she could no longer keep her eyes open, she went to sleep to dream of great operations in molasses candy on change next day.    CHAPTER VII.  KATY MAKES A LARGE SALE.  Katy rose the next morning bright and early, and her heart was full of hope. She felt that she had a great work to perform, and she was going forth to do it, resolved that no obstacle should turn her back. Her mother had told her that she would be laughed at, and made fun of; that thoughtless people would look down upon her with contempt, and that wicked ones would insult her. She was, therefore, prepared for all these trials, but she had braced herself up to meet them with courage and fortitude.  Her mother was sick, and they were actually in a suffering condition. What right had she to be proud in her poverty? She felt able to support her mother, and she could find no excuse, if she wished to do so, for not supporting her. It was her duty, therefore, to sell candy if she could get money by it; and thus consideration strengthened her heart.  Katy had been to the public school and to the Sunday school until her mother was taken sick; and though she was only eleven years old, she had a very good idea of her moral and religious duties. \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" the commandment says; and she could think of no better way to obey the divine precept than to support her mother when there was no one else upon whom she could rely. Little by little their earthly possessions had passed away. Mrs. Redburn had never learned how to save money; and when the day of adversity came, her funds were soon exhausted. She had no friends to whom she dared reveal her poverty, and when want came to the door, she was too proud to beg. Hoping for better days, she had sold most of her best dresses, and those of Katy. The small sums raised by these sacrifices were soon used up; and when the daughter could no longer make a decent appearance, she was required to show herself much more than ever before. Katy did not repine at this, though her mother did, for their pride, as my young friends have discovered, was of very different kinds.  Katy did wish she had a little better dress, and a little better bonnet for her first attempt in the mercantile calling; but there was no help for it. She had mended her clothes as well as she could, and as they were clean, she was pretty well satisfied with her personal appearance. Besides, people would not be half so apt to buy her candy if she were well dressed, as if she were rather plainly clothed. In short, it was all for the best.  After breakfast she prepared herself for the duties of the day. Her heart beat violently with anxiety and expectation, and while she was placing the candy on the tray, which she had previously covered with white paper to render her wares the more inviting, her mother gave her a long lecture on the trials and difficulties in her path, and the proper way to encounter them.  \"Now, my dear child,\" said Mrs. Redburn, in conclusion \"if any evil person insults you, do not resent it, but run away as fast as you can.\"  \"Shan't I say anything, mother?\"  \"Not a word.\"  \"But if some naughty boy or girl, no bigger than I am myself, should be saucy to me, I think I can give them as good as they send.\"  \"Don't do it, Katy.\"  \"They have no business to insult me.\"  \"That is very true; but when you use bad or violent language to them, you go down to their level.\"  \"But if they begin it?\"  \"No matter, Katy; if they are unkind and wicked, it is no reason that you should be unkind and wicked. If you leave them without resenting their insults, the chances are that they will be ashamed of themselves before you get out of sight. You need not be low and vile because others are.\"  \"I guess you are right, mother.\"  \"You know what the Bible says: 'If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink, for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.'\"  \"I won't say a word, mother, whatever they say to me. I'll be as meek as Moses.\"  \"I hope you will not be gone long,\" added Mrs. Redburn.  \"I have thirty sticks of candy here. I don't think it will take me long to sell the whole of them. I shall be back by dinner time whether I sell them or not for you know I must go to Mrs. Gordon again to-day. Now, good-by, mother, and don't you worry about me, for I will do everything just as though you were looking at me.\"  Katy closed the door behind her, and did not see the great tears that slid down her mother's pale cheek as she departed. It was well she did not, for it would have made her heart very sad to know all the sorrow and anxiety that distressed her mother as she saw her going out into the crowded streets of a great city, to expose herself to a thousand"]]]
