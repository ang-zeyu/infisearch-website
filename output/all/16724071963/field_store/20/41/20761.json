I wondher if they wudden't sthep livelier if they were paid be th' piece.\"     Sherlock Holmes   \"Dorsey an' Dugan are havin' throuble,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"What about?\" asked Mr. Dooley.  \"Dorsey,\" said Mr. Hennessy, \"says Dugan stole his dog.  They had a party at Dorsey's an' Dorsey heerd a noise in th' back yard an' wint out an' see Dugan makin' off with his bull tarryer.\"  \"Ye say he see him do it?\"  \"Yis, he see him do it.\"  \"Well,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"'twud baffle th' injinooty iv a Sherlock Holmes.\"  \"Who's Sherlock Holmes?\"  \"He's th' gr-reatest detictive that iver was in a story book. I've been r-readin' about him an' if I was a criminal, which I wud be if I had to wurruk f'r a livin', an' Sherlock Holmes got afther me, I'd go sthraight to th' station an' give mesilf up.  I'd lay th' goods on th' desk an' say: 'Sargeant, put me down in th' hard cage.  Sherlock Holmes has jus' see a man go by in a cab with a Newfoundland dog an' he knows I took th' spoons.' Ye see, he ain't th' ordh'nry fly cop like Mulcahy that always runs in th' Schmidt boy f'r ivry crime rayported fr'm stealin' a ham to forgin' a check in th' full knowledge that some day he'll get him f'r th' right thing.  No, sir; he's an injanyous man that can put two an' two together an' make eight iv thim.  He applies his brain to crime, d'ye mind, an' divvle th' crime, no matther how cunnin' it is, will escape him.  We'll suppose, Hinnissy, that I'm Sherlock Holmes. I'm settin' here in me little parlor wearin' a dhressin' gown an' now an' thin pokin' mesilf full iv morpheen.  Here we are.  Ye come in.  'Good-mornin', Watson.'\"  \"I ain't Watson,\" said Mr. Hennessy.  \"I'm Hinnissy.\"  \"Ah,\" said Mr. Dooley; \"I thought I'd wring it fr'm ye.  Perhaps ye'd like to know how I guessed ye had come in.  'Tis very simple. On'y a matther iv observation.  I heerd ye'er step; I seen ye'er refliction in th' lookin' glass; ye spoke to me.  I put these things together with me thrained faculty f'r observation an' deduction, d'ye mind.  Says I to mesilf: 'This must be Hinnissy.' But mind ye, th' chain iv circumstances is not complete.  It might be some wan disguised as ye.  So says I to mesilf: 'I will throw this newcome, whoiver he is, off his guard, be callin' him be a sthrange name!' Ye wudden't feel complimented, Hinnissy, if ye knew who Watson is.  Watson knows even less than ye do.  He don't know annything, an' annything he knows is wrong.  He has to look up his name in th' parish raygisther befure he can speak to himsilf. He's a gr-reat frind iv Sherlock Holmes an' if Sherlock Holmes iver loses him, he'll find him in th' nearest asylum f'r th' feeble-minded.  But I surprised ye'er secret out iv ye.  Thrown off ye'er guard be me innocent question, ye popped out 'I'm Hinnissy,' an' in a flash I guessed who ye were.  Be th' same process iv raisonin' be deduction, I can tell ye that ye were home las' night in bed, that ye're on ye'er way to wurruk, an' that ye'er salary is two dollars a day.  I know ye were at home las' night because ye ar-re always at home between iliven an' sivin, bar Pathrick's night, an' ye'er wife hasn't been in lookin' f'r ye.  I know ye're on ye'er way to wurruk because I heerd ye'er dinner pail jingle as ye stepped softly in.  I know ye get two dollars a day because ye tol' me ye get three an' I deducted thirty-three an' wan third per cint f'r poetic license.  'Tis very simple.  Ar-re those shoes ye have on ye'er feet? Be hivins, I thought so.\"  \"Simple,\" said Mr. Hennessy, scornfully; \"'tis foolish.\"  \"Niver mind,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"Pass th' dope, Watson.  Now bein' full iv th' cillybrated Chow Sooey brand, I addhress me keen mind to th' discussion iv th' case iv Dorsey's dog.  Watson, look out iv th' window an' see if that's a cab goin' by ringin' a gong.  A throlley car? So much th' betther.  Me observation tol' me it was not a balloon or a comet or a reindeer.  Ye ar-re a gr-reat help to me, Watson.  Pass th' dope.  Was there a dog on th' car? No? That simplifies th' thing.  I had an idee th' dog might have gone to wurruk.  He was a bull-tarryer, ye say.  D'ye know annything about his parents? Be Mulligan's Sloppy Weather out iv O'Hannigan's Diana iv th' Slough? Iv coorse.  Was ayether iv thim seen in th' neighborhood th' night iv th' plant? No? Thin it is not, as manny might suppose, a case iv abduction.  What were th' habits iv Dorsey's coyote? Was he a dog that dhrank? Did he go out iv nights? Was he payin' anny particular attintions to anny iv th' neighbors? Was he baffled in love? Ar-re his accounts sthraight? Had Dorsey said annything to him that wud 've made him despondent? Ye say no. He led a dog's life but seemed to be happy.  Thin 'tis plainly not a case iv suicide.  \"I'm gettin' up close to th' criminals.  Another shot iv th' mad mixture.  Wait till I can find a place in th' ar-rm.  There ye ar-re.  Well, Watson, what d'ye make iv it?\"  \"If ye mane me, Dugan stole th' dog.\"  \"Not so fast,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"Like all men iv small minds ye make ye'ers up readily.  Th' smaller th' mind, th' aisier 'tis made up.  Ye'ers is like a blanket on th' flure befure th' fire. All ye have to do to make it up is to lave it.  Mine is like a large double bed, an' afther I've been tossin' in it, 'tis no aisy job to make it up.  I will puncture me tire with th' fav'rite flower iv Chinnytown an' go on.  We know now that th' dog did not elope, that he didn't commit suicide an' that he was not kidnaped be his rayturnin' parents.  So far so good.  Now I'll tell ye who stole th' dog.  Yisterdah afthernoon I see a suspicious lookin' man goin' down th' sthreet.  I say he was suspicious lookin' because he was not disguised an' looked ivry wan in th' face.  He had no dog with him.  A damning circumstance, Watson, because whin he'd stolen th' dog he niver wud 've taken it down near Dorsey's house. Ye wudden't notice these facts because ye'er mind while feeble is unthrained.  His coat collar was turned up an' he was whistlin' to himsilf, a habit iv dog fanciers.  As he wint be Hogan's house he did not look around or change his gait or otherwise do annything that wud indicate to an unthrained mind that there was annything wrong, facts in thimsilves that proved to me cultivated intilligence that he was guilty.  I followed him in me mind's eye to his home an' there chained to th' bed leg is Dorsey's dog.  Th' name iv th' criminal is P. X. O'Hannigan, an' he lives at twinty-wan hundhred an' ninety-nine South Halsted sthreet, top flat, rear, a plumber be pro-fission.  Officer, arrest that man!  \"That's all right,\" said Mr. Hennessy; \"but Dugan rayturned th' dog las' night.\"  \"Oh, thin,\" said Mr. Dooley, calmly, \"this is not a case f'r Sherlock Holmes but wan f'r th' polis.  That's th' throuble, Hinnissy, with th' detictive iv th' story.  Nawthin' happens in rale life that's complicated enough f'r him.  If th' Prisidint iv th' Epworth League was a safe-blower be night th' man that'd catch him'd be a la-ad with gr-reat powers iv observation an' thrained habits iv raisonin'.  But crime, Hinnissy, is a pursoot iv th' simple minded--that is, catchable crime is a pursoot iv th' simple-minded.  Th' other kind, th' uncatchable kind that is took up be men iv intellict is called high fi-nance.  I've known manny criminals in me time, an' some iv thim was fine men an' very happy in their home life, an' a more simple, pasth'ral people ye niver knew.  Wan iv th' ablest bank robbers in th' counthry used to live near me--he ownded a flat buildin'--an' befure he'd turn in to bed afther rayturnin' fr'm his night's wurruk, he'd go out in th' shed an' chop th' wood.  He always wint into th' house through a thransom f'r fear iv wakin' his wife who was a delicate woman an' a shop lifter.  As I tell ye he was a man without guile, an' he wint about his jooties as modestly as ye go about ye'ers.  I don't think in th' long run he made much more thin ye do.  Wanst in a while, he'd get hold iv a good bunch iv money, but manny other times afther dhrillin' all night through a steel dure, all he'd find 'd be a short crisp note fr'm th' prisidint iv th' bank.  He was often discouraged, an' he tol' me wanst if he had an income iv forty dollars th' month, he'd retire fr'm business an' settle down on a farm.  \"No, sir, criminals is th' simplest crathers in th' wide wide wurruld--innocent, sthraight-forward, dangerous people, that haven't sinse enough to be honest or prosperous.  Th' extint iv their schamin' is to break a lock on a dure or sweep a handful iv change fr'm a counter or dhrill a hole in a safe or administher th' strong short arm to a tired man takin' home his load.  There are no mysteryous crimes excipt thim that happens to be.  Th' ordh'nry crook, Hinnissy, goes around ringin' a bell an' disthributin' hand-bills announcin' his business.  He always breaks through a window instead iv goin' through an open dure, an' afther he's done annything that he thinks is commindable, he goes to a neighborin' liquor saloon, stands on th' pool table an' confides th' secret to ivrybody within sound iv his voice.  That's why Mulligan is a betther detictive thin Sherlock Holmes or me.  He can't put two an' two together an' he has no powers iv deduction, but he's a hard dhrinker an' a fine sleuth.  Sherlock Holmes niver wud've caught that frind iv mine.  Whin th' safe iv th' Ninth Rational Bank was blowed, he wud've put two an' two together an' arristed me.  But me frind wint away lavin' a hat an' a pair iv cuffs marked with his name in th' safe, an' th' polis combined these discoveries with th' well-known fact that Muggins was a notoryous safe blower an' they took him in.  They found him down th' sthreet thryin' to sell a bushel basket full iv Alley L stock.  I told ye he was a simple man.  He ralized his ambition f'r an agaracoolchral life. They give him th' care iv th' cows at Joliet.\"  \"Did he rayform?\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4729"],["title","Observations By Mr. Dooley (#3)"],["body","Mr. Hennessy.  \"No,\" said Mr. Dooley; \"he escaped.  An' th' way he got out wud baffle th' injinooty iv a Sherlock Holmes.\"  \"How did he do it?\" asked Mr. Hennessy.  \"He climbed over th' wall,\" said Mr. Dooley.     International Amenities   \"Be hivins,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"I wisht I'd been there.\"  \"Where?\" asked Mr. Hennessy.  \"At th' bankit iv th' Ancyent an' Hon'rable Chamber iv Commerce in New York,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"'Tis a hard fate that compels me to live out here on th' prairies among th' aborig'nal Americans fr'm Poland an' Bohaymya.  Me heart at times is burstin' f'r to jine in th' festivities iv me fellow Britons in New York.  F'r I'm a British subjick, Hinnissy.  I wasn't born wan.  I was born in Ireland.  But I have a little money put away, an' ivry American that has larned to make wan dollar sthick to another is ex-officio, as Hogan says, a British subjick.  We've adopted a foster father. Some iv us ain't anny too kind to th' ol' gintleman.  In th' matther iv th' Nicaragoon Canal we have recently pushed him over an' took about all he had.  But our hearts feels th' love iv th' parent counthry, though our hands is rebellyous, an' ivry year me fellow-merchants gets together in New York an' f'rgets th' cares iv th' wool an' tallow business in an outburst iv devotion to th' ol' land fr'm which our fathers sprung or was sprung be th' authorities.  \"Th' prisidint iv th' bankit was me frind Morse K. Cheeseshop a mimber iv an ol' Yorkshire fam'ly born in th' West Riding iv Long Island befure th' Crimeyan War.  At his right sat th' Sicrety iv state f'r th' colony, an' at his left me frind th' ambassadure to th' Coort iv Saint James.  Why we shud sind an ambassadure I don't know, though it may be an ol' custom kept up f'r to plaze th' people iv Omaha.  He's a good man, th' ambassadure, who is inthrajoocin' th' American joke in England.  Hogan says th' diff'rence between an American joke an' an English joke is th' place to laugh.  In an American joke ye laugh just afther th' point if at all, but in an English joke ye laugh ayether befure th' point or afther th' decease iv th' joker.  Th' ambassadure hopes to inthrajooce a cross iv th' two that ye don't laugh at at all that will be suited to th' English market.  His expeeriments so far has been encouragin'.  \"At th' conclusion iv th' eatin' th' chairman, Sir Morse Cheeseshop inthrajooced th' sicrety iv state in a few well chosen wurruds. 'Fellow Colonists,' says he, 'I desire to presint His Majesty's ripresentative in this counthry who is doin' more thin anny other man in th' plastherin' business,' he says.  'Owin',' he says, 'to mimbers iv th' Sinit lavin' a hod iv bricks fall on his head recently, he has not been able to do much on th' job,' he says. 'But he has brought his throwel and morthar here to-night an' if ye will kindly lave off singing' \"Brittanya rules th' prosperity wave\" f'r a minyit he'll give ye an exhibition iv how he wurruks. Me Lords an' gintlemen, th' sicrety iv state:'  \"'Fellow subjicks,' says th' sicrety iv state, 'diplomacy is far diff'rent business thin it used to be.  (A voice, 'Good f'r you.') In th' days iv Bismarck, Gladstun an' Charles Francis Adams 'twas a case iv inthrigue an' deceit.  Now it is as simple as a pair iv boots.  In fifteen years th' whole nature iv man is so changed that a diplomat has on'y to be honest, straight-forward an' manly an' concede ivrything an' he will find his opponents will meet him half way an' take what he gives.  Unforchunitly diplomacy on'y goes as far as the dure.  It is onable to give protection to th' customer, so whin he laves th' shop th' sthrong arm men iv th' Sinit knocks him down an' takes fr'm him ivrything he got inside an' more too.  Di-plomacy has become a philanthropic pursoot like shop-keepin', but politics, me lords, is still th' same ol' spoort iv highway robb'ry.  But I done what I cud to protict th' intherests iv th' mother, father an' brother-in-law counthry, an' between you an' me if I don't desarve th' Victorya cross f'r presintin' that threaty to th' Sinit nobody does.  I will on'y say that hinceforth th' policy iv this gover'mint will be as befure not to bully a sthrong power or wrong a weak, but will remain thrue to th' principle iv wrongin' th' sthrong an' bullyin' th' weak.'  \"Th' sicrety iv state was followed be th' ambassadure.  'I wish to tell ye,' said he, 'what a good time I had in England.  Befure I wint there I was sthrongly prejudiced again' England.  I thought it was th' noblest counthry on which, as Dan'l Webster says, th' sun niver set without hatchin' out a new colony.  But I did it a great injustice.  It is betther thin what I thought.  It does not care f'r chaff or gush such as goes down in this counthry.  All an English gintleman demands is that ye shall be ye'ersilf, frank, manly an' sincere.  A little cry on th' shouldher, a firm grasp iv th' hand, a brief acknowledgment that we owe our language an' are payin' it back, our lithrachoor an' our boots to him, an' his heart opens.  He cannot conceal his admiration f'r ye.  He goes away.  Ah, niver will I f'rget th' day I peeked out iv me bed-room window at Windsor Castle an' see manny iv th' sturdy lielists here befure me bein' received in th' back yard be th' king.  I mind well th' wurruds that fell fr'm his lips whin ye left to take lunch in th' rile woodshed.  \"Chote,\" he says, \"thim were a fine lot iv Americans,\" he says.  \"What thribe did ye say they belonged to? Soos?\" he says.'  \"So th' avenin' proceeded until it was time to go home, whin th' chairman proposed th' customary toast.  'Me lords an' gintlemen, charge ye'er glasses an' jine me in a toast,' he says.  'His majesty Edward th' Sivinth, iv Gr-reat Britain an' possibly Ireland, iv Inja, Egypt, iv Austhralya, iv South Africa in a sinse, an' iv th' Dominions beyant th' sea, includin' New York, King, Definder iv th' Faith.  I hope I got it all in.' 'Ye did,' said th' ambassadure. An' th' toast was dhrunk with enthusyasm.  Other toasts was dhrunk to th' rile fam'ly an' th' Protestant Succession, to th' Jook iv Argyle who used to own Andhrew Carnaygie, an' in manny cases th' rile merchants carrid th' glasses away in their pockets.  Jus' as th' comp'ny was breakin' up a man whose gaiters creaked rose an' said: 'Isn't there wan more toast?' 'Good hivins have I f'rgotten somewan?' said Lord Cheeseshop.  'That was all there was in th' book.  Who d'ye mane?' he says.  'I mane th' prisidint iv th' United States,' says th' man, who comes fr'm Baraboo.  'Oh him,' says th' chairman in a relieved tone.  'Well, annywan that wants to can dhrink his health at th' bar,' he says.  \"As th' comp'ny filed out a band was playin' in th' adjinin' room where they was a meetin' iv th' Amalgamated Stove-polish men fr'm th' neighborhood iv Terry Hut.  'What's that outlandish chune?' says Lord Cheeseshop.  ''Tis th' naytional air, west iv Hoboken,' says th' man fr'm Baraboo.  'What's it called?' says Lord Cheeseshop. 'Th' Star Spangled Banner,' says th' man.  'Well,' says Lord Cheeseshop, ''tis very intherestin',' he says.  ''Tis th' on'y Indyan music I iver heerd,' he says.\"  \"Ah well,\" said Mr. Hennessy, \"who cares?\"  \"Faith I think ye're right,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"A man will swallow annything with a dinner.  What is good f'r what Hogan calls th' iliminthry canal has nawthin' to do with th' Nicaragoon Canal an' I'd be more afraid iv Lord Cheeseshop if he thought th' toast an' didn't say it.  Our Anglo-Saxon relations is always a give-away--on some wan.\"     Art Patronage   \"I see in this pa-aper,\" said Mr. Dooley, \"they'se a fellow kickin' because an American painther ain't got anny chanst again' foreign compytition.\"  \"Sure,\" said Mr. Hennessy; \"he's aisy displazed.  I niver knew th' business to be betther.  Wages is high an' 'tis a comfortable thrade barrin' colic.\"  \"I don't mane that kind iv painthers,\" said Mr. Dooley.  \"I don't mane th' wans that paint ye'er barn, but th' wans that paints a pitcher iv ye'er barn an' wants to sell it to ye f'r more thin th' barn is worth.  This man says no matther how industhrees an American painther is, no matther if he puts on his overalls arly in th' mornin' an' goes out with a laddher an' whales away all day long, he can hardly arn a livin', while th' pauper artists iv Europe is fairly rowlin' in th' lap iv luxury.  Manny a la-ad that started in life with th' intintion iv makin' th' wurruld f'rget that what's his name--Hogan's frind--ye know who I mane--Michael Angelo--ever lived, is now glad to get a job decoratin' mountain scenery with th' latest news about th' little liver pills.  \"Ye see, Hinnissy, whin a man gets hold iv a large hatful iv money, wan iv th' first things he does is to buy some art.  Up to th' time whin th' top blew off th' stock market, he bought his art out iv th' front window iv a news an' station'ry shop or had it put in be th' paperhanger.  He took th' Sundah pa-apers that ar-re a gr-reat help if ye're collectin' art, an' he had some pitchers iv fruit that looks nachral enough to ate, d'ye mind, a paintin' iv a deer like th' wan he shot at in th' Manotowish counthry in Eighty-eight, an' a livin' likeness iv a Lake Supeeryor white fish on a silver plate.
