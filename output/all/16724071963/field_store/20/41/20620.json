It makes an old bachelor, like me, feel lonesome when he contrasts his own solitary room with such a scene of comfort as this. You've got a comfortable home, and dog-cheap, too. All my other tenants are grumbling to think you don't have to pay any more for such superior accommodations. I've about made up my mind that I must ask you twenty-five dollars a quarter, hereafter.”  All this was said very pleasantly, but the pill was none the less bitter.  “It seems to me, Mr. Colman,” remarked the cooper soberly, “you have chosen rather a singular time for raising the rent.”  “Why singular, my good sir?” inquired the landlord, urbanely.  “You know of course, that this is a time of general business depression; my own trade in particular has suffered greatly. For a month past, I have not been able to find any work.”  Colman's face lost something of its graciousness.  “And I fear I sha'n't be able to pay my quarter's rent to-morrow.”  “Indeed!” said the landlord coldly. “Perhaps you can make it up within two or three dollars?”  “I can't pay a dollar towards it,” said the cooper. “It's the first time, in five years that I've lived here, that this thing has happened to me. I've always been prompt before.”  “You should have economized as you found times growing harder,” said Colman, harshly. “It is hardly honest to live in a house when you know you can't pay the rent.”  “You sha'n't lose it Mr. Colman,” said the cooper, earnestly. “No one ever yet lost anything by me. Only give me time, and I will pay you all.”  The landlord shook his head.  “You ought to cut your coat according to your cloth,” he responded. “Much as it will go against my feelings, under the circumstances I am compelled by a prudent regard to my own interests to warn you that, in case your rent is not ready to-morrow, I shall be obliged to trouble you to find another tenement; and furthermore, the rent of this will be raised five dollars a quarter.”  “I can't pay it, Mr. Colman,” said the cooper; “I may as well say that now; and it's no use my agreeing to pay more rent. I pay all I can afford now.”  “Very well, you know the alternative. But it is a disagreeable subject. We won't talk of it now; I shall be round to-morrow morning. How's your excellent sister; as cheerful as ever?”  “Quite as much so as usual,” answered the cooper, dryly.  “But there's one favor I should like to ask, if you will allow us to remain here a few days till I can look about me a little.”  “I would with the greatest pleasure in the world,” was the reply, “but there's another family very anxious to take the house, and they wish to come in immediately. Therefore I shall be obliged to ask you to move out to-morrow. In fact that is the very thing I came here this evening to speak about, as I thought you might not wish to pay the increased rent.”  “We are much obliged to you,” said the cooper, with a tinge of bitterness unusual to him. “If we are to be turned out of doors, it is pleasant to have a few hours' notice of it.”  “Turned out of doors, my good friend! What disagreeable expressions you employ! It is merely a matter of business. I have an article to dispose of. There are two bidders; yourself and another person. The latter is willing to pay a larger sum. Of course I give him the preference. Don't you see how it is?”  “I believe I do,” replied the cooper. “Of course, it's a regular proceeding; but you must excuse me if I think of it in another light, when I reflect that to-morrow at this time my family and myself may be without a shelter.”  “My dear sir, positively you are looking on the dark side of things. It is actually sinful to distrust Providence as you seem to do. You're a little disappointed, that's all. Just take to-night to sleep on it, and I've no doubt you'll think better of it and of me. But positively I have stayed longer than I intended. Good night, my friends. I'll look in upon you in the morning. And by the by, as it is so near the time, allow me to wish you a Happy New Year.”  The door closed upon the landlord, leaving behind two anxious hearts.  “It looks well in him to wish that,” said the cooper, gloomily. “A great deal he is doing to make it so. I don't know how it seems to others, but for my part I never say them words to any one unless I really wish 'em well, and am willing to do something to make 'em so. I should feel as if I was a hypocrite if I acted anyways different.”  Mary did not respond to this. In her own gentle heart she could not help feeling a silent repugnance, mingled, it may be, with a shade of contempt, for the man who had just left them. It was an uncomfortable feeling, and she strove to get rid of it.  “Is there any tenement vacant in this neighborhood?” she asked.  “Yes, there's the one at the corner, belonging to Mr. Harrison.”  “It is a better one than this.”  “Yes, but Harrison only asks the same that we have been paying. He is not so exorbitant as Colman.”  “Couldn't we get that?”  “I am afraid, if he knew that we had failed to pay our rent here, he would object.”  “But he knows you are honest, and that nothing but the hard times would have brought you to such a pass.”  “It may be, Mary. At any rate you have lightened my heart a little. I feel as if there was some hope left.”  “We ought always to feel so, Timothy. There was one thing that Mr. Colman said that didn't sound so well, coming from his lips; but it's true, for all that.”  “What do you mean, Mary?”  “I mean that about not distrusting Providence. Many a time have I been comforted by reading the verse, 'Never have I seen the righteous forsaken, or his seed begging bread.' As long as we try to do what is right, Timothy, God will not suffer us to want.”  “You are right, Mary. He is our ever-present help in time of need. Let us put away all anxious cares, fully confiding in his gracious promises.”  They retired to rest thoughtfully, but not sadly.  The fire upon the hearth flickered, and died out at length. The last sands of the old year were running out, and the new morning ushered in its successor.    CHAPTER IV. THE NEW YEAR'S PRESENT.    “HAPPY New Year!” was Jack's salutation to Aunt Rachel, as, with an unhappy expression of countenance, she entered the sitting-room.  “Happy, indeed!” she repeated, dismally. “There's great chance of its being so, I should think. We don't any of us know what the year may bring forth. We may all be dead before the next New Year.”  “If that's the case,” said Jack, “we'll be jolly as long as it lasts.”  “I don't know what you mean by such a vulgar word,” said Aunt Rachel, disdainfully. “I've heard of drunkards and such kind of people being jolly; but, thank Providence, I haven't got to that yet.”  “If that was the only way to be jolly,” said Jack, stoutly, “then I'd be a drunkard; I wouldn't carry round such a long face as you do, Aunt Rachel, for any money.”  “It's enough to make all of us have long faces, when you are brazen enough to own that you mean to be a drunkard.”  “I didn't say any such thing,” said Jack, indignantly.  “Perhaps I have ears,” remarked Aunt Rachel, sententiously, “and perhaps I have not. It's a new thing for a nephew to tell his aunt that she lies. They didn't use to allow such things when I was young.--But the world's going to rack and ruin, and I shouldn't much wonder if the people are right that says it's comin' to an end.”  Here Mrs. Crump happily interposed, by asking Jack to go round to the grocery, in the next street, and buy a pint of milk.  Jack took his cap and started, with alacrity, glad to leave the dismal presence of Aunt Rachel.  He had scarcely opened the door when he started back in surprise, exclaiming, “By hokey, if there isn't a basket on the steps!”  “A basket!” repeated Mrs. Crump, in surprise. “Can it be a New Year's present? Bring it in, Jack.”  It was brought in immediately, and the cover being lifted there appeared a female child, of apparently a year old. All uttered exclamations of surprise, each in itself characteristic.  “What a dear, innocent little thing!” said Mrs. Crump, with true maternal instinct.  “Ain't it a pretty 'un?” said Jack, admiringly.  “Poor thing!” said the cooper, compassionately.  “It's a world of iniquity!” remarked Rachel, lifting up her eyes, dismally. “There isn't any one you can trust. I didn't think a brother of mine would have such a sin brought to his door.”  “Good heavens, Rachel!” said the honest cooper, in amazement, “what can you mean?”  “It isn't for me to explain,” said Rachel, shaking her head; “only it's strange that it should have been brought to _this_ house, that's all I say.”  “Perhaps it was meant for you, Aunt Rachel,” said Jack, with thoughtless fun.  “Me!” exclaimed Rachel, rising to her feet, while her face betrayed the utmost horror at the suggestion. She fell back in her seat, and made a violent effort to faint.  “What have I said?” asked Jack, a little frightened at the effect of his words. “Aunt Rachel takes one up so.”  “He didn't mean anything,” said Mrs. Crump. “How could you suspect such a thing? But here's a letter. It looks as if there was something in it. Here, Timothy, it is directed to you.”  Mr. Cooper opened the letter, and read as follows:--  “For reasons which it is unnecessary to state, the guardians of this child find it expedient to (sic) intrust it to others to be brought up. The good opinion which they have formed of you, has led them to select you for that charge. No further explanation is necessary, except that it is by no means their object to make this a service of charity. They therefore (sic) inclose a certificate of deposits on the Broadway Bank, of three hundred dollars, the same having been made in your name. Each year, while the child remains in your charge,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4660"],["title","Timothy Crump's Ward: A Story of American Life (#3)"],["body","same sum will in like manner be placed to your credit at the same bank It may be as well to state, farther, that all attempts to fathom whatever of mystery may attach to this affair, will prove useless.”  This letter was read in silent amazement.  The certificate of deposits, which had fallen to the floor, was handed to Timothy by his wife.  Amazement was followed by a feeling of gratitude and relief.  “What could be more fortunate?” exclaimed Mrs. Crump. “Surely, Timothy, our faith has been rewarded.”  “God has listened to our cry,” said the cooper, devoutly; “and, in the hour of our need, He has remembered us.”  “Isn't it prime?” said Jack, gleefully; “three hundred dollars! Ain't we rich, Aunt Rachel?”  “Like as not,” observed Rachel, “the certificate isn't genuine. It doesn't look natural it should be. I've heard of counterfeits before. I shouldn't be surprised at all if Timothy got taken up for presenting it.”  “I'll risk that,” said Mr. Crump, who did not look very much depressed by this suggestion.  “Now you'll be able to pay the rent, Timothy,” said Mrs. Crump, cheerfully.  “Yes; and it's the last quarter I shall pay to Mr. Colman, if I can help it.”  “Why, where are you going?” inquired Jack.  “To the corner house belonging to Mr. Harrison, that is, if it is not already engaged. I think I will go and see about it at once. If Mr. Colman should come in while I am gone, tell him I will be back directly; I don't wish you to tell him of the change in our circumstances.”  The cooper found Mr. Harrison at home.  “I called to inquire,” commenced the cooper, “whether you had let that house of yours on the corner of the street.”  “Not as yet,” was the reply.  “What rent do you ask?”  “Twenty dollars a quarter,” said Mr. Harrison; “that I consider reasonable.”  “It is satisfactory to me,” was the cooper's reply, “and, if you have no objections to me as a tenant, I will engage it at once.”  “Far from having any objections, Mr. Crump,” was the courteous reply, “I shall be glad to secure so good a tenant. Will you go over and look at the house?”  “Not now, sir; I am somewhat in haste. When can we move in?”  “To-day, if you like.”  His errand satisfactorily accomplished, the cooper returned home. Meanwhile the landlord had called.  He was a little surprised to find that Mrs. Crump, instead of looking depressed, looked cheerful, rather than otherwise.  “I was not aware you had a child so young,” he remarked, looking at the baby.  “It isn't mine,” said Mrs. Crump, briefly.  “The child of a neighbor, I suppose,” thought Colman.  Meanwhile he scrutinized closely, without appearing to do so, the furniture in the room.  At this point Mr. Crump opened the outer door.  “Good-morning,” said Colman, affably. “A fine morning.”  “Quite so,” answered his tenant, shortly.  “I have called, Mr. Crump, to know if you are ready with your quarter's rent.”  “I think I told you, last night, how I was situated. Of course I am sorry----”  “So am I,” said the landlord, “for I may be obliged to have recourse to unpleasant measures.”  “You mean that we must leave the house!”  “Of course, you cannot expect to remain in it if you are unable to pay the rent. Of course,” added Colman, making an inventory with his eyes, of the furniture, “you will leave behind a sufficient amount of furniture to cover your bill----”  “Surely, you would not deprive us of our furniture!”  “Is there any hardship in requiring payment of honest debts?”  “There are cases of that description. However, I will not put you to that trouble. I am ready to pay you your dues.”  “You have the money?” said Colman, hastily.  “I have, and something over; as you will see by this document. Can you give me the two hundred and eighty dollars over?”  It would be difficult to picture the amazement of Colman. “Surely, you told me a different story last night,” he said.  “Last night and this morning are different times. Then I could not pay you; now, luckily, I am able. If you cannot change this amount, and will accompany me to the bank, I will place the money in your hands.”  “My dear sir, I am not at all in haste,” said the landlord, with a return of his former affability. “Any time within a week will do. I hope, by the way, you will continue to occupy this house.”  “As I have already engaged Mr. Harrison's house, at the corner of the street, I shall be unable to remain. Besides, I do not want to interfere with the family who are so desirous of moving in.”  Mr. Colman was silenced. He regretted, too late, the hasty course which had lost him a good tenant. The family referred to had no existence; and, it may be remarked, the house remained vacant for several months, when he was glad to rent it at the old price.    CHAPTER V. A LUCKY RESCUE.    THE opportune arrival of the child inaugurated a season of comparative prosperity in the home of Timothy Crump. To persons accustomed to live in their frugal way, three hundred dollars seemed a fortune. Nor, as might have happened in some cases, did this unexpected windfall tempt the cooper or his wife to extravagances.  “Let us save something against a rainy day,” said Mrs. Crump.  “We can, if I get work soon,” answered her husband. “This little one will add but little to our expenses, and there is no reason why we should not save up at least half of it.”  “There's no knowing when you will get work, Timothy,” said Rachel, in her usual cheerful way; “it isn't well to crow before you're out of the woods.”  “Very true, Rachel. It isn't your failing to look too much at the sunny side of the picture.”  “I'm ready to look at it when I can see it anywhere,” said his sister, in the same enlivening way.  “Don't you see it in the unexpected good fortune which came with this child?” asked Timothy.  “I've no doubt it seems bright enough, now,” said Rachel, gloomily, “but a young child's a great deal of trouble.”  “Do you speak from experience, Aunt Rachel?” inquired Jack, demurely.  “Yes;” said his aunt, slowly; “if all babies were as cross as you were when you were an infant, three hundred dollars wouldn't begin to pay for the trouble of having one round.”  Mr. Crump and his wife laughed at this sally at Jack's expense, but the latter had his wits about him sufficiently to answer, “I've always heard, Aunt Rachel, that the crosser a child is the pleasanter he will grow up. What a very pleasant baby you must have been!”  “Jack!” said his mother, reprovingly; but his father, who looked upon it as a good joke, remarked, good-humoredly, “He's got you there, Rachel.”  The latter, however, took it as a serious matter, and observed that, when she was young, children were not allowed to speak so to their elders. “But, I don't know as I can blame 'em much,” she continued, wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron, “when their own parents encourage 'em in it.”  Timothy was warned, by experience, that silence was his best (sic) defence. Since anything he might say would only be likely to make matters worse.  Aunt Rachel sank into a fit of deep despondency, and did not say another word till dinner time. She sat down to the table with a profound sigh, as if there was little in life worth living for. Notwithstanding this, it was observed that she had a good appetite. Indeed, Rachel seemed to thrive on her gloomy views of life and human nature. She was, it must be acknowledged, perfectly consistent in all her conduct, as far as this peculiarity was concerned. Whenever she took up a newspaper, she always looked first to the space appropriated to deaths, and next in order to the column of accidents, casualties, etc., and her spirits were visibly exhilarated when she encountered a familiar name in either list.  Mr. Crump continued to look out for work, but it was with a more cheerful spirit. He did not now feel as if the comfort of his family depended absolutely upon his immediate success. Used economically, the money he had by him would last nine months, and during that time it was impossible that he should not find something to do. It was this sense of security--of possessing something upon which he could fall back--that enabled him to keep up good heart. It is too generally the case that people are content to live as if they were sure of constantly retaining their health and never losing their employment. When a reverse does come they are at once plunged into discouragement, and feel that something must be done immediately. There is only one way to fend off such an embarrassment, and that is to resolve, whatever may be the amount of the income, to lay aside some part to serve as a reliance in time of trouble. A little economy--though it involves privation--will be well repaid by the feeling of security thus engendered.  Mr. Crump was not compelled to remain inactive as long as he feared. Not that his line of business revived,--that still remained depressed,--but another path was opened to him for a time.  Returning home late one evening, the cooper saw a man steal out from a doorway, and assault a gentleman whose dress and general appearance indicated probable wealth. Seizing him by the throat, the villain effectually prevented him from calling the police, and was engaged in rifling his pockets when the cooper arrived at the scene. A sudden blow on the side of the head admonished the robber that he had more than one to deal with.  “Leave this man instantly,” said the cooper, sternly, “or I will deliver you into the hands of the police.”  The villain hesitated, but fear prevailed, and springing to his feet, he hastily made off under cover of the darkness.  “I hope you have received no injury,” said Timothy, respectfully, turning towards the stranger he had rescued.  “No, my worthy friend, thanks to your timely assistance. The rascal nearly succeeded, however.”  “I hope you have lost nothing, sir.”  “Nothing, fortunately. You can form an idea of the value of your interference, when I say that I have fifteen hundred dollars with me, all of which I should undoubtedly"]]]
