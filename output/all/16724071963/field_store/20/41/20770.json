Had I been at a hospital, or in camp, I would have reported my suspicions to the right authorities. Under the circumstances, sir, what would you have done?”  The major got suddenly into the car and slammed the door. “I would probably have done exactly as you did, young lady.”  Then Nancy did want to cry from sheer relief. Their car crawled off through the traffic congestion at the scene of the accident. The highway ran parallel with the track for some distance. They had an appalling view of the twisted mass of wreckage in the forward part of the train. At a group of official-looking cars, Major Reed had the driver stop. He got out to talk to two men. A few minutes later he brought them over to the car and had Nancy give a description of the two suspects she had noticed on the train.  “You are to be commended, Miss Dale,” said Mr. Nelson, the taller of the two strangers, “for at least giving the suspects a looking over.”  “I had to see what they were like after I heard them whispering in German!” exclaimed Nancy. “But when I saw one was a corporal in the army I thought perhaps I was being too suspicious.”  Mr. Nelson laughed bitterly. “We’ve picked up several spies lately, disguised in soldier’s uniforms. A man isn’t always to be trusted just because he wears our colors.”  “I suppose it would be impossible now to locate the pair,” said Nancy unhappily. “The blond could be anywhere among the thousands back there at the station, or hundreds of miles away by this time.”  The other plainclothes official said, “You underrate our Secret Service, miss. The description you’ve given is elaborate compared with some we get. We’ve sometimes caught ’em on little more than a shoestring.”  He saluted respectfully and their car rolled out to the open country, and across the red clay hills. They were all too tired for conversation, even if they had had the heart for it after such a depressing experience. Captain Lewis did not seem inclined to conversation, and Nancy was glad enough to ride in silence. She snuggled deep into her corner, and was actually asleep before they had left the wreck five miles behind.  Some time later she was startled by a gentle hand shaking her shoulder. “Here we are, my dear,” Miss Lewis was saying. Nancy opened her eyes.  She sat up with a start, wondering if there’d been another wreck. To her amazement she found they had stopped in front of a long, one-story building. Some white-uniformed nurses were coming down the steps. Across the lawn she saw another group in coveralls.  “You mean we are actually there—at camp?” she asked in amazement.  “You slept like a baby all the way,” said Captain Lewis. “That ability to relax at once will stand you in good stead when you get in the thick of things.”  Nancy was pleased. “Mother has always said if anyone would give me a pillow I could go to sleep any time, anywhere.”  “And this time you didn’t even have a pillow.” Then suddenly Captain Lewis assumed her official air. “Lieutenant Hauser will show you to your room and help you get settled. Would you like to join me at breakfast when you get cleaned up?”  “Oh yes, thanks. This brisk morning air has really whipped up my appetite.”  Not until long afterward did Nancy discover what an honor Captain Lewis had bestowed upon her. Too many new and exciting things were happening just then for her to appreciate the full significance of the invitation.  Captain Lewis introduced her to Lieutenant Hauser who was rather short and stocky and had a ready smile. She gave Nancy the comfortable feeling that there was really no difference in their positions, even though Miss Hauser was already a first lieutenant.  “Your roommate is Mabel Larsen,” explained Miss Hauser. “She got in yesterday and already knows enough to show you the ropes.”  They went down a long, narrow hall. A moment later Miss Hauser opened the door of a neat little room with two beds, attractive cretonne drapes and comfortable chairs and floor lamps.  An exclamation of delight escaped Nancy, “Oh, I thought we’d be sleeping on army cots in tents!”  “You’ll get plenty of that later. Better enjoy these comforts while you have them,” Lieutenant Hauser warned her. “Mabel’s out on the obstacle course right now. You’ll have a chance to do some unpacking and clean up before she comes in.”  Miss Hauser pointed out a list of rules tacked on the door, told Nancy where the dining room was and left her to her own devices. An hour later when Nancy came back from a hearty breakfast with Captain Lewis she found Mabel Larsen stretched on her bed.  Mabel merely lifted her head when Nancy came in, and greeted her casually. “Oh, hello! You’re the latest shavetail, I suppose?”  “I’m Nancy Dale, and they tell me you’re Mabel Larsen.”  “Glad you came. Sorry I can’t be very formal just now, but I’m all in—got only fifteen minutes to get my wind back.” She groaned softly. “Gosh, but my legs ache!”  “What’s wrong? Are you ill?”  “Oh, nothing that won’t be worse tomorrow! Just wait till you try those hurdles!” Mabel turned over cautiously and groaned again. “I might’ve been pounded by Japs from the way these shanks feel.”  Nancy laughed in spite of herself. “You must’ve been neglecting your daily dozen before you came here.”  “I’ve never been one of those exercise addicts,” stated Mabel. “I’ve always gotten enough floor work in the wards without this one, two, three business.” Mabel reached for a bottle of rubbing alcohol and began to massage her rather plump legs.  “Wait, let me do it,” said Nancy.  Mabel lay back on the bed and gave herself up to the enjoyment of the soothing touch of Nancy’s hands.  “You oughter been a masseuse,” she sighed. Then after a moment she asked, “Why were you so late? We thought you were coming on that early train.”  “There was a wreck,” said Nancy, reluctant to recall her trying experience.  Mabel sat up suddenly. “You mean the train you were on?”  Nancy nodded and gave her a hasty sketch of what had happened, and their work with the injured.  “Well, if I’m not the daughter of a sloth!” burst forth Mabel. “Here I am letting you give me an alcohol rub when you’ve already been working like a trooper for hours!”  “Oh, I got a bit of sleep coming over in the car, but Miss Lewis suggested that I go to bed again till lunch time. I had breakfast with her just now.”  “Not Captain Mary Lewis?” asked Mabel.  Nancy nodded as she began to take off her clothes.  “Well, aren’t you the lucky bloke!” exclaimed Mabel. “Hobnobbing with the majors and captains on the very day of your arrival.”  “It just happened that way.”  “Think of the chance you had to prove to ’em right off the bat what stuff you’re made of. Some people do have all the luck.”  Nancy didn’t know just what to make of this talkative roommate, but she was too tired to care just then. She found her rumpled pajamas in the zipper bag and got them out. In the meantime Mabel was painfully putting on her uniform to report to class.  “They’ll probably give you a bunch of this gear this afternoon,” Mabel said. “I never had so many new duds all at one time as they issued to me yesterday.”  “Miss Hauser said I’d get my uniforms this afternoon, and be given my schedule, too. After that experience this morning I’m rather glad I don’t have to get down to business till tomorrow.”  Nancy crawled into bed and was thankful to find it very comfortable. She watched her new friend straighten her tie and set her new visor cap at a rakish angle on her reddish curls.  “Boy, do I feel swell in this uniform,” boasted Mabel. “It sure boosts your morale to feel you’re really one of the bunch at last. I’ve been raring to get in for months.”  “So have I,” Nancy told her. “But I only graduated last month.”  “Shake, sister! You’re a gal after my own heart. I just finished, too.” The irrepressible Mabel seized Nancy’s hand that lay on the spread. “I believe we’re gonner hit it off fine.”  “We’ll make a team to whip the Japs,” Nancy said, entering into the spirit of her banter.  “Say, that’s swell! So you want to go down under, too?”  “You bet! My brother’s flying a bomber there.”  “I’ve got a sweety out there, too. Yeah, we’ll make a team—the long and short, the chestnut curls and the strawberry-blond mop, your common sense and my nonsense.”  Then they were both laughing and the ice was completely broken.  Mabel glanced at her watch and bounded toward the door. “Be seeing you later,” she called back.  Nancy felt as though a whirlwind had just passed, and she settled into her pillow with a sigh of relief. She felt certain she was going to like her new roommate. Though most of her remarks were flippant, she showed that there was the right sort of stuff underneath.  After a couple of hours’ sleep and a shower, Nancy felt ready to tackle her new life. She spent the rest of the afternoon being fitted for her clothes. She was surprised to know the old blue uniforms were no longer issued, and that she would wear olive drab for dress.  “They found the Japs wearing blue sometimes in the Pacific area. It proved confusing,” Lieutenant Hauser told her. “White uniforms are not customarily worn, either, by nurses at the front—too easily spotted from the air. All these changes are the result of practical experience.”  When Nancy went out to supper with her new friend, Mabel remarked, “Leisure’s a scarce commodity round here. We put in eight hours of hard work every day, counting all the classes, ward work, drills and stuff. Six days a week, too, sister!”  “I’m used to that,” Nancy told her.  Nancy’s real initiation came the next morning when they were routed out before daylight for half an hour of calisthenics. Mabel stuck close to give her a prod or hint"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47307"],["title","Nancy Dale, Army Nurse (#3)"],["body","doing things wrong. That morning Nancy also noticed Tini Hoffman for the first time. Unlike her nickname Tini was of a large build, and she seemed not to have the slightest sense of rhythm or coordination. She was constantly getting out of step and throwing the line off.  “All right then I’ll step out!” snapped Tini, when she had been reprimanded the third time. “I can’t do anything to please you.”  “You’ll stay in ranks and keep trying till you do it correctly,” Lieutenant Carson stated. “Or else!”  After that the girl stomped about like a spoiled child, making the dust fly over those around her. Nancy wondered why she was here at all if she had not come in the spirit of cooperation with the training program.  “Too much silly falderal,” she heard Tini say in a low tone when the formation broke up. “I came in to nurse the sick, not to do a lot of crazy drilling.”  That afternoon Tini was close to Mabel and Nancy when they were jumping some hurdles. Nancy’s long legs swung easily over the first two, but the last took all the ability she had. Tini, however, didn’t even try to go over the last, but quickly ducked under when the instructor wasn’t looking.  “Go back, you cheat!” snapped Mabel. “We’re not going to have any duckers-under in this unit.”  Mabel’s bluntness attracted the attention of Lieutenant John Warren, who was putting them through this phase of their training. He called out good-naturedly, “Now, now, young lady! You have to take it over the top, you know.”  Tini knocked down the bar twice before she finally made that last hurdle. She scraped her chin the first time she hit the gravel. When their instructor was out of hearing she gave him some back talk, and continued to grumble while she crawled parallel with Nancy and Mabel under some lengths of chicken wire.  Nancy was sure her palms had as much earth on them as skin when she finally came triumphantly through on the other side. “Boy, what an experience!” she burst forth, when she got up to brush herself off.  “Just imagine how much faster we could do it, if the Japs were using the soles of our G.I. shoes for target practice,” Mabel reminded her.  “There’s just no sense in all this,” complained Tini, wiping her gritty palms on her coveralls.  Nancy didn’t like this girl, nor her attitude, and found she couldn’t keep silent any longer.  “Looks as though you’d better get out of this right now,” she snapped. “If I understand the reason for all this, it’s for our own good—to prepare us for real trials to come if we’re sent into the fighting areas.”  “Mind your own business,” snapped Tini like a spoiled child. “I’ve got a right to blow off if I want to.”  She stalked on to the next test. Here they were required to swing by a rope down the side of a ravine. Nancy and Mabel followed slowly, and Mabel said, “If they keep her on she’ll get our unit into trouble, sure as life.”  “I doubt if they keep her with such an attitude.”  “She griped like that all the way through nurse’s training,” Mabel explained.  “Oh, was she in your class?”  “Yes. We came here together, too. You have to hand it to Tini, though. She has a keen mind and makes grand marks. They had no grounds for turning her down, I suppose.”  “She makes me feel as uncomfortable as those suspects on the train did.”  “Yeah!” agreed Mabel. “There’re more ways of working against Uncle Sam than outright sabotage.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  CHAPTER THREE                                  SUSPECTS   In the busy days that followed, Nancy, with the other girls of her unit, was plunged into the intensive work of preparing for service in the fighting zones. Fully alert to the importance of these instructions, Nancy worked even harder than she had during her nurse’s training. Here they must put the lectures and discussions into practice at once.  The day after her arrival there were lectures on military courtesy and customs of the service. They were told how to wear their uniforms, and how to recognize the various insignia of office.  In their room afterwards Nancy and Mabel had lots of fun practicing the military salute.  “You’ve got to learn to do it automatically,” said Mabel. “Your fingers should go to your forehead when you see a superior officer as instinctively as your foot goes to the car brake in an emergency.”  “And I suppose it will prove to be ‘a restriction’ emergency if you don’t,” Nancy came back with a laugh.  For the next day or two they saluted every time they passed each other in their room and had some good laughs over their actions.  “Tini Hoffman says she hates to salute,” Mabel confided. “She says it makes her feel inferior.”  “If Tini isn’t careful she’s going to get kicked out of this training camp,” Nancy said. “I don’t like her attitude one bit.”  “Neither do the instructors. But she’s got an uncle who’s a colonel or something—anyhow he’s one of the bigwigs in the training program.”  “I don’t imagine that will have any influence if she doesn’t make the grade,” Nancy replied. “I’d hate to think of the kind of army we’d have if it did.”  “You may be right,” Mabel conceded. “But what’s more, I don’t even like her name. It’s much too German.”  “I think we ought to be careful about things like that,” warned Nancy. “There’re plenty of good, loyal Americans, you know, with foreign-sounding names.”  “Yes, of course. But when a foreign name goes along with a rebellious attitude it makes you wonder.”  Something happened a week later to make the two girls think more seriously than ever of Tini Hoffman and her strange conduct. After their eight hours of work, the nurses were free to seek recreation, go into the village on shopping tours or to movies. And they were usually ready for a change when their day’s work was over.  One evening Nancy and Mabel had stopped in a drugstore for a soda after going to the movies, and they came unexpectedly upon Tini. The drugstore they had entered was very narrow in the rear, with little, private booths down each wall and an aisle in between for serving. The girls slipped into one of the booths to have their soda and chat about the picture. Couples filled all the other seats and crowded around the tables in front. Most of them were men and women in uniform.  “We’re lucky to get seats,” said Mabel.  While waiting for their order to be filled, Nancy said, “Oh, I meant to get some cleansing tissues.”  “I’ll get ’em for you,” offered Mabel. “I promised to pick up a package here for Miss Hauser. She phoned her order over.”  While Mabel was at the drug counter Nancy sat idly gazing around at the chatting groups. Then suddenly she noticed Tini Hoffman directly across the aisle. Tini was so busy talking to a man in civilian clothes that she hadn’t noticed her dormitory mates. She sat with her elbows on the table, her hands folded under her dimpled chin, while her blond countenance beamed on her companion. Nancy felt sure Tini’s hair was bleached, and wondered what it would look like after several months in the Pacific islands. It was too golden-blond to be natural. It proved amusing to find Tini so pleased with her situation for once.  So fascinated was Nancy in watching Tini that Mabel was returning before she gave the gentleman opposite Tini a fleeting glance. Then suddenly her eyes became fixed. Where had she seen that lean profile before? She tried to hold herself under control as her mind tied up the loose ends of memory. The longer she stared, the more positive she became that the horn-rimmed glasses and small mustache belonged to the same man who had sat beside the blond corporal the day she left her home town. Though she had had only a hasty glance as she went down the aisle of the train those faces had become indelibly impressed upon her mind.  As Mabel came nearer, Nancy saw Tini’s companion watching covertly. She couldn’t blame any man for being attracted by Mabel, for she was really worth looking at in her trimly fitting uniform with her cap sitting jauntily on her golden curls. But the man’s heavy-lidded glance had little admiration in it, only a sort of cynical calculation.  Nancy felt she must know if he was really the blond corporal’s train mate. Impulsively she said as Mabel handed her the package she had bought, “_Danke schoen_.”  She deliberately used the German word for “thank you,” and spoke loud enough to be heard across the aisle.  Her trick brought the expected result, for the man turned sharply toward her. Mabel glided into the seat opposite and glanced at her with a puzzled frown. When it was too late for regrets, Nancy felt the hot blood welling to her face. Others may have heard her, too, and what would they think?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _Nancy Discovered Tini Across the Aisle_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  There was even a chance that the man might recognize her as the same girl who had sat in front of them on the train, even though she had worn a green suit then and was now clad in olive drab.  “At least,” she thought ruefully, “I could swear he’s the same man. But what’s he doing here with Tini Hoffman?”  Mabel had to speak to her twice before she heeded.  “They make grand sodas here, don’t they?”  “Sure do!” Nancy stuck a couple of straws in hers so hard they bent double.  “What’s wrong?” asked Mabel under her breath.  Nancy glanced warily at the couple across the aisle, nudged Mabel with her foot, and laid her finger cautiously on her lips before she placed the fresh straws in her glass.  Mabel wisely changed the subject, and remarked, “Cleansing tissues are sure hard to get now. Guess we’ll have to get all ours hereafter at the P.X.”  “We’ll need plenty to take across—if we get to go over.”  “Yeah, my friend Lydia, in North Africa, wrote me we’d better take along plenty of stuff like that.”  Suddenly Nancy was impatient to be through with"]]]
