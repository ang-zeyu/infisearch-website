In proportion as one really believes this, he becomes a cumberer of the ground. It was said of Oscar McCulloch, an earnest student of human life, that \"in whatever part of God's universe he finds himself, he will be a hopeful man, looking forward and not backward, looking upward and not downward, always ready to lend a helping hand, and not afraid to die.\"  Of like spirit was Robert Louis Stevenson:    \"Glad did I live and gladly die,   And I laid me down with a will.\"  It is through men of this type that the work of civilization has been accomplished, \"men of present valor, stalwart, brave iconoclasts.\" They were men who were content with the order of the universe as it is, and seek only to place their own actions in harmony with this order. They have no complaints to urge against \"the goodness and severity of God,\" nor any futile wish \"to remould it nearer to the heart's desire.\" The \"Fanaticism for Veracity\" is satisfied with what is. Not the ultimate truth which is God's alone, but the highest attainable truth, is the aim of Science, and to translate Science into Virtue is the goal of civilization.  The third question which Science may ask is the direct one. In what part of the universe are you, and what are you doing? Thoreau says that \"there is no hope for you unless this bit of sod under your feet is the sweetest to you in this world--in any world.\" Why not? Nowhere is the sky so blue, the grass so green, the sunshine so bright, the shade so welcome, as right here, now, today. No other blue sky, nor bright sunshine, nor welcome shade exists for you. Other skies are bright to other men. They have been bright in the past and so will they be again, but yours are here and now. Today is your day and mine, the only day we have, the day in which we play our part. What our part may signify in the great whole we may not understand, but we are here to play it, and now is the time. This we know, it is a part of action, not of whining. It is a part of love, not cynicism. It is for us to express love in terms of human helpfulness. This we know, for we have learned from sad experience that any other course of life leads toward decay and waste.  What, then, are you doing under these blue skies? The thing you do should be for you the most important thing in the world. If you could do something better than you are doing now, everything considered, why are you not doing it?  If every one did the very best he knew, most of the problems of human life would be already settled. If each one did the best he knew, he would be on the highway to greater knowledge, and therefore still better action. The redemption of the world is waiting only for each man to \"lend a hand.\"  It does not matter if the greatest thing for you to do be not in itself great. The best preparation for greatness comes in doing faithfully the little things that lie nearest. The nearest is the greatest in most human lives.  Even washing one's own face may be the greatest present duty. The ascetics of the past, who scorned cleanliness in the search for godliness, became, sometimes, neither clean nor holy. For want of a clean face they lost their souls.  It was Agassiz's strength that he knew the value of today. Never were such bright skies as arched above him; nowhere else were such charming associates, such budding students, such secrets of nature fresh to his hand. His was the buoyant strength of the man who can look the stars in the face because he does his part in the Universe as well as they do theirs. It is the fresh, unspoiled confidence of the natural man, who finds the world a world of action and joy, and time all too short for the fulness of life which it demands. When Agassiz died, \"the best friend that ever student had,\" the students of Harvard \"laid a wreath of laurel on his bier, and their manly voices sang a requiem, for he had been a student all his life long, and when he died he was younger than any of them.\"  Optimism in life is a good working hypothesis, if by optimism we mean the open-eyed faith that force exerted is never lost. Much that calls itself faith is only the blindness of self-satisfaction.  What if there are so many of us in the ranks of humanity? What if the individual be lost in the mass as a pebble cast into the Seven Seas? Would you choose a world so small as to leave room for only you and your satellites? Would you ask for problems of life so tame that even you could grasp them? Would you choose a fibreless Universe to be \"remoulded nearer to the heart's desire,\" in place of the wild, tough, virile, man-making environment from which the Attraction of Gravitation lets none of us escape?  It is not that \"I come like water and like wind I go.\" I am here today, and the moment and the place are real, and my will is itself one of the fates that make and unmake all things. \"Every meanest day is the conflux of two eternities,\" and in this center of all time and space for the moment it is I that stand. Great is Eternity, but it is made up of time. Could we blot out one day in the midst of time, Eternity could be no more. The feebleness of man has its place within the infinite Omnipotence.  It is a question not of hope or despair, but of truth, not of optimism nor of Pessimism, but of wisdom. Wisdom is knowing what to do next; virtue is doing it. Religion is the heart impulse that turns toward the best and highest course of action. \"It was my duty to have loved the highest. What does that demand? What have I to do next? Not in infinity, where we can do nothing, but here, today, the greatest day that ever was, for it alone is mine!  What matter is it that time does not end with us? Neither with us does history begin. An Emperor of China once decreed that nothing should be before him, that all history should begin with him. But he could go no farther than his own decree. Who are you that would be Emperor of China?    \"The eternal Saki from that bowl hath poured   Millions of bubbles like us and shall pour.\"  Why not? Should life stop with you? What have you done that you should mark the end of time? If you have played your part in the procession of bubbles, all is well, though the best you can do is to leave the world a little better for the next that follows.  If you have not made life a little richer and its conditions a little more just by your living you have not touched the world. You are indeed a bubble. If some kind friend somewhere \"turn down an empty glass,\" it will be the best monument you deserve. But to have had a friend is to leave the glass not wholly empty, for life is justified in love as well as in action.  The words of Omar need to be read with the rising inflection, and they become the expression of exultant hopefulness.    \"The eternal Saki from that bowl hath poured   Millions of bubbles and shall pour!\"  Small though we are the story is not all told when we are dead. The huge procession goes on and shall go on, till the secret of the grand symphony of life is reached.    \"A single note in the Eternal Song   A perfect Singer hath had need for me.\"    * * *    \"I do rejoice that when of Thee and Me   Men speak no longer, yet not less but more   The Eternal Saki still that bowl shall fill   And ever fairer, clearer bubbles pour.\"  In the same way we must read with the rising inflection the lines of Tennyson:    \"I falter when I firmly trod,   And falling with my weight of cares,   Upon the World's great altar-stairs   That slope through darkness, up to god!\"  Read these words with courage, and with the upward turn of the voice at the end. It is no longer in the darkness that we falter. The great altar-stairs of which no man knows the beginning nor the end, do not spring from the mire nor end in the mists. They \"slope through darkness up to God,\" and no one could ask a stronger expression of that robust optimism which must be the mainspring of successful life."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4763"],["title","The Game of Logic (#0)"],["body","Fishburne           THE GAME OF LOGIC  By Lewis Carroll      ---------------------   |9        |         10|   |         |           |   |    -----x------     |   |   |11   |    12|    |   |   |     |      |    |   |---y-----m------y'---|   |   |     |      |    |   |   |13   |    14|    |   |    -----x'-----     |   |         |           |   |15       |         16|    ---------------------       COLOURS FOR              -------------        COUNTERS              |5     |     6|           ___                |      x      |                              |      |      |   See the Sun is overhead,   |--y-------y'-|   Shining on us, FULL and    |      |      |           RED!               |      x'     |                              |7     |     8|   Now the Sun is gone away,   -------------   And the EMPTY sky is           GREY!           ___    THE GAME OF LOGIC  By Lewis Carrol      To my Child-friend.    I charm in vain; for never again,   All keenly as my glance I bend,     Will Memory, goddess coy,     Embody for my joy   Departed days, nor let me gaze     On thee, my fairy friend!    Yet could thy face, in mystic grace,   A moment smile on me, 'twould send     Far-darting rays of light     From Heaven athwart the night,   By which to read in very deed     Thy spirit, sweetest friend!    So may the stream of Life's long dream   Flow gently onward to its end,     With many a floweret gay,     Adown its willowy way:   May no sigh vex, no care perplex,     My loving little friend!    NOTA BENE.  With each copy of this Book is given an Envelope, containing a Diagram (similar to the frontispiece) on card, and nine Counters, four red and five grey.  The Envelope, &c. can be had separately, at 3d. each.  The Author will be very grateful for suggestions, especially from beginners in Logic, of any alterations, or further explanations, that may seem desirable.  Letters should be addressed to him at \"29, Bedford Street, Covent Garden, London.\"    PREFACE    \"There foam'd rebellious Logic, gagg'd and bound.\"   This Game requires nine Counters--four of one colour and five of another:  say four red and five grey.  Besides the nine Counters, it also requires one Player, AT LEAST. I am not aware of any Game that can be played with LESS than this number:  while there are several that require MORE:  take Cricket, for instance, which requires twenty-two.  How much easier it is, when you want to play a Game, to find ONE Player than twenty-two. At the same time, though one Player is enough, a good deal more amusement may be got by two working at it together, and correcting each other's mistakes.  A second advantage, possessed by this Game, is that, besides being an endless source of amusement (the number of arguments, that may be worked by it, being infinite), it will give the Players a little instruction as well.  But is there any great harm in THAT, so long as you get plenty of amusement?    CONTENTS.   CHAPTER                                PAGE     I.  NEW LAMPS FOR OLD.          1.

Propositions.              \"Some new Cakes are nice.\"             \"No new Cakes are nice.\"             \"All new cakes are nice.\"  There are three 'PROPOSITIONS' for you--the only three kinds we are going to use in this Game:  and the first thing to be done is to learn how to express them on the Board.  Let us begin with  \"Some new Cakes are nice.\"  But before doing so, a remark has to be made--one that is rather important, and by no means easy to understand all in a moment:  so please to read this VERY carefully.  The world contains many THINGS (such as \"Buns\", \"Babies\", \"Beetles\". \"Battledores\". &c.);  and these Things possess many ATTRIBUTES (such as \"baked\", \"beautiful\", \"black\", \"broken\", &c.:  in fact, whatever can be \"attributed to\", that is \"said to belong to\", any Thing, is an Attribute).  Whenever we wish to mention a Thing, we use a SUBSTANTIVE:  when we wish to mention an Attribute, we use an ADJECTIVE.  People have asked the question \"Can a Thing exist without any Attributes belonging to it?\"  It is a very puzzling question, and I'm not going to try to answer it:  let us turn up our noses, and treat it with contemptuous silence, as if it really wasn't worth noticing.  But, if they put it the other way, and ask \"Can an Attribute exist without any Thing for it to belong to?\", we may say at once \"No:  no more than a Baby could go a railway-journey with no one to take care of it!\"  You never saw \"beautiful\" floating about in the air, or littered about on the floor, without any Thing to BE beautiful, now did you?  And now what am I driving at, in all this long rigmarole?  It is this.  You may put \"is\" or \"are\" between names of two THINGS (for example, \"some Pigs are fat Animals\"), or between the names of two ATTRIBUTES (for example, \"pink is light-red\"), and in each case it will make good sense.  But, if you put \"is\" or \"are\" between the name of a THING and the name of an ATTRIBUTE (for example, \"some Pigs are pink\"), you do NOT make good sense (for how can a Thing BE an Attribute?) unless you have an understanding with the person to whom you are speaking.  And the simplest understanding would, I think, be this--that the Substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence, so that the sentence, if written out in full, would be \"some Pigs are pink (Pigs)\".  And now the word \"are\" makes quite good sense.  Thus, in order to make good sense of the Proposition \"some new Cakes are nice\", we must suppose it to be written out in full, in the form \"some new Cakes are nice (Cakes)\".  Now this contains two 'TERMS'--\"new Cakes\" being one of them, and \"nice (Cakes)\" the other.  \"New Cakes,\" being the one we are talking about, is called the 'SUBJECT' of the Proposition, and \"nice (Cakes)\" the 'PREDICATE'. Also this Proposition is said to be a 'PARTICULAR' one, since it does not speak of the WHOLE of its Subject, but only of a PART of it.  The other two kinds are said to be 'UNIVERSAL', because they speak of the WHOLE of their Subjects--the one denying niceness, and the other asserting it, of the WHOLE class of \"new Cakes\".  Lastly, if you would like to have a definition of the word 'PROPOSITION' itself, you may take this:--\"a sentence stating that some, or none, or all, of the Things belonging to a certain class, called its 'Subject', are also Things belonging to a certain other class, called its 'Predicate'\".  You will find these seven words--PROPOSITION, ATTRIBUTE, TERM, SUBJECT, PREDICATE, PARTICULAR, UNIVERSAL--charmingly useful, if any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied Logic. Mind you bring all seven words into your answer, and you friend will go away deeply impressed--'a sadder and a wiser man'.  Now please to look at the smaller Diagram on the Board, and suppose it to be a cupboard, intended for all the Cakes in the world (it would have to be a good large one, of course).  And let us suppose all the new ones to be put into the upper half (marked 'x'), and all the rest (that is, the NOT-new ones) into the lower half (marked 'x'').  Thus the lower half would contain ELDERLY Cakes, AGED Cakes, ANTE-DILUVIAN Cakes--if there are any:  I haven't seen many, myself--and so on.  Let us also suppose all the nice Cakes to be put into the left-hand half (marked 'y'), and all the rest (that is, the not-nice ones) into the right-hand half (marked 'y'').  At present, then, we must understand x to mean \"new\", x' \"not-new\", y \"nice\", and y' \"not-nice.\"  And now what kind of Cakes would you expect to find in compartment No. 5?  It is part of the upper half, you see; so that, if it has any Cakes in it, they must be NEW: and it is part of the left-hand half; so that they must be NICE.  Hence if there are any Cakes in this compartment, they must have the double 'ATTRIBUTE' \"new and nice\": or, if we use letters, the must be \"x y.\"  Observe that the letters x, y are written on two of the edges of this compartment.  This you will find a very convenient rule for knowing what Attributes belong to the Things in any compartment. Take No. 7, for instance.  If there are any Cakes there, they must be \"x' y\", that is, they must be \"not-new and nice.\"  Now let us make another agreement--that a red counter in a compartment shall mean that it is 'OCCUPIED', that is, that there are SOME Cakes in it.  (The word 'some,' in Logic, means 'one or more' so that a single Cake in a compartment would be quite enough reason for saying \"there are SOME Cakes here\").  Also let us agree that a grey counter in a compartment shall mean that it is 'EMPTY', that is that there are NO Cakes in it.  In the following Diagrams, I shall put '1' (meaning 'one or more') where you are to put a RED"]]]
