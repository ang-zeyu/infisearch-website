The next morning Joseph sent out a flag of truce to learn the intentions of this vast mob.  They were met by another flag of truce, and the two messengers conferred together.  \"What is your purpose? What is the intention of those you represent? Why have you thus come to alarm and terrify the peaceful dwellers in Far West?\" inquired the \"Mormon.\"  \"We want three men from your city,\" insolently and boldly answered the other. \"We want Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith and Sidney Rigdon, then we will burn your town to ashes and as the flames leap up we'll massacre and murder all we find within the city limits. That's what we want and intend.\"  The \"Mormon\" messenger, Col. Hinkle by name, grew pale at these words.  \"Can we not devise some other way? Would you murder all? Let the innocent suffer as well as those whom you call guilty? Have mercy on us.\"  The other seeing the evident fear and treachery of the base colonel, proposed that if he could devise means to get the leaders of the Church into the mobbers' camp, to get all the \"Mormons'\" property that it might be divided among their enemies, and to give up all the arms and ammunition in the town, in return the rest of the Saints should be permitted to leave the state and be protected by the militia.  To this infamous proposal the traitor consented and returned to the town to comply with the conditions.  The night before this was spent by Lydia, in common with the rest of the women, in trying to place her household effects where they would not be destroyed in case the mob should fire the city.  \"My dear,\" said the husband, \"be careful of our little ones to-night, I must go out and join my brethren who are on guard. You will not be afraid will you?\"  \"Newel, God rules!\" replied the dauntless woman.  As night came on, two brethren who were among those that had gone up to Crooked river came to the door, and asked Lydia if she could not find a hiding-place for them, saying that the mob were doubly enraged at those who were up at that fearful engagement and determined to murder every such man they could find.  One of them, James Emmet by name, was an old friend of Lydia's. She quietly told them that she would do all in her power to secrete them. Accordingly, the night was partly spent in making a little store-room adjoining the living-room as comfortable as possible for the two men. When daylight came the mother dressed her little ones and commenced her usual daily duties. She knew she was liable to be killed herself if these men were found in her house, but as she told her husband, so she comforted her heart now by saying, \"God rules!\"    CHAPTER VII.  In the early morning of Wednesday, 31st of Oct., the flag of truce spoken of in the previous chapter was sent out, and the traitor soon returned to consummate his horrible plan.  The day was spent by the anxious mother in work and prayer. Often she bent her knees in humble petition for the safety of her children and the brethren concealed in her house that they might not be found.  Newel was away with the men who were trying to devise means to protect their homes and families.  In the afternoon a neighbor came in to say, \"Joseph has gone out to the enemies' camp.\"  \"God protect him!\" replied Lydia.  \"They, that is the Prophet, Brothers Rigdon and Pratt, Col. Wight and Brother Robinson, have gone along with Col. Hinkle to see if something can't be done to prevent the carrying out of the exterminating order sent by Governor Boggs.\"  \"What exterminating order?\"  \"Why didn't you hear that Governor Boggs, you remember the rascal, the one who headed the mob in Jackson Co., had sent an order to this host of robbers outside the town, telling them that they are to wipe out every one of us? Giving them authority as an organized millitia. Well you must have staid close at home last night not to have heard that!\"  \"Yes,\" said Lydia, \"I was very busy all night.\"  \"So were we all! I am told that Major-general Wallack and General Doniphan were ordered to raise a thousand men and join this General Clark who has command of the whole, and this precious trio are now trying to make arrangements to murder us all in cold blood! This is indeed a land of freedom! Why, Sister Knight, I feel just as though my blood was boiling oil when I think of this inhuman outrage.\"  \"Be calm, sister, let your heart rather be filled with humblest prayer, that God will turn aside their wicked purposes.\"  The indignant neighbor departed, with many wishes that \"God would exterminate them root and branch if they did not speedily repent.\"  Not long after the woman had gone, the air was filled by shouts and hideous sounds from the mobbers' camp. Looking anxiously from the window, Lydia saw her husband hurrying to the house. On entering he cried,  \"Lydia, Lydia, pray as you never prayed before. Our beloved Prophet is taken prisoner! The wretch who decoyed him out has betray his Prophet, his religion and his God! Listen to those awful sounds! May the God of Israel hold their lives as in His hand. My wife, these are bitter days.\"  \"Newel, I am full of weakness.\"  \"Do not go outside the house, for prowlers are around and will injure you if they find you in their power. I must go now, my girl. You know my very soul is bowed with prayer to God to preserve my wife and babes. Be brave as you always are, and I will come when I can and bring you word of what transpires.\"  \"Be careful, my husband, and I feel that we shall be protected.\"  Once more the woman was left alone with her little ones and the brethren under her care. God and her own heart alone know the anxieties of the next few hours. But into her soul crept and brooded the sweet spirit that whispered to the troubled waves, \"Be still.\" And she was calm. Oh, that awful night! Over every thing, into every house, down into the low places, high over the tree-tops sounded the piercing, shrieking yells of that blood-thirsty mob. The flesh would creep at the fiendish sounds, the heart would quiver with the fearful though that Joseph, the beloved one, was in their power. Ten thousand wolves could never make a sound so hideously inhuman, or so fiendishly triumphant as the yells and shouts that unceasingly arose from the throats of that murderous throng from evening shades till morning light. Were these men human? Oh yes. Were they civilized beings? Oh yes; there were seventeen ministers and nineteen commissioned officers, who led the mob.  The night was spent by Lydia in one long, anxious prayer. The next morning, the 1st of November, dawned cool and bright.  With the morning came Newel. He brought the sad news that the Patriarch and Brother Amasa Lyman were taken prisoners and removed to the enemy's camp.  \"Newel, how will this end? My heart is torn with anxious fears, and yet the Spirit tells me all will yet be well.\"  \"God grant it, Lydia,\" replied her husband. \"What is the meaning of all this? Look from the window! Here is an army marching upon us. Good by and God protect you, I must go, for there is the signal for us to gather at the public square.\"  So saying, he hastily snatched his rifle from the wall and rushed to the square, where the signal drum was beating long and loud. On arriving there he was commanded by Gen. Lucas to give up his arms.  He replied, \"Sir, my rifle is my own private property, no one has a right to demand it from me.\"  \"Lay down your arms, you rascal, or I will have you shot.\"  Full of righteous indignation, the helpless man complied, seeing that many of his brethren were also disarmed.  Their leaders were gone but they were true Saints. And were they not also free-born American citizens?  As the men rushed into the public square they were all forced to obey the summary command \"Give up your arms!\"  When all were assembled, they were compelled at the point of the bayonet to sign a deed of trust of all their (the \"Mormons'\") possessions to Gen. Lucas to defray the expenses of this unholy war.  This unrighteous deed being accomplished, and all the men of the town being placed under guard, the mob swarmed out into the town, pillaging, foraging, insulting women and abusing little children. Stock were shot down and left on the streets to rot. Fields were destroyed, houses were searched, everything of any value was taken and any one who dared to remonstrate was brutally threatened with murder.  Every house was searched for the men who were at the tragedy of Crooked river. At last three ruffians came to Lydia's door, and one who seemed to be the leader asked: \"Have you any men in the house?\"  \"You have our men under guard,\" answered the fearless woman.  \"Have you any man in the house?\"  \"I tell you, my husband is on the public square a prisoner.\"  \"Have you any arms in the house?\"  \"My husband took his rifle with him.\"  The little children seeing the ferocious men, were frightened and commenced to cry.  \"Sir, go away from here, do you not see how frightened my little ones are?\"  \"Well, have you no men or arms in the house?\"  \"I tell you again my husband is a prisoner on the square, and he took his rifle with him.\"  \"Upon my word, at least you've got plenty of Mormon blood and to spare.\"  So abruptly speaking he turned away and they all left the house, leaving the brave but trembling woman whispering to her children, \"God rules!\"  The next morning, the sun arose on a scene of desolation. Hundreds of houseless, homeless beings huddled together as best they could, weeping, sorrowing and sad, but peaceful and full of the testimony that all suffering was in Christ Jesus, and He would be their helper and comforter. Many were without food to eat, but those who had some, shared with those who had not.  The Prophets and leaders were gone, but ways must be devised to get out of the state. Only a few short months were given them in which to leave their desolate homes and corn-fields.  That day the leaders came into the town heavily guarded, and were marched to the square. There they were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46602"],["title","Lydia Knight's History (#6)"],["body","d, after much pleading, to see their distracted families. It was ascertained from the Prophet that a court-martial had been held, and the prisoners were tried without being allowed to be present or to have any one to defend them, and were sentenced to be shot the next day. Gen. Doniphan, who was a lawyer, told the mob he would have nothing do do with such unlawful high-handed proceedings, and in disgust left them, ordering all of his men to take up their march homeward.  This circumstance made the robbers hesitate, and accordingly it was determined to remove the prisoners to Independence.  Not long were they permitted to be with their friends, but were taken back to camp. The next morning the Prophet and Patriarch, Sidney Rigdon, P. P. Pratt, Lyman Wight, Amasa Lyman and George W. Robinson were started off for Independence.    CHAPTER VIII.  Newel set to work to try and assist the homeless ones and feed the poor. To this labor he devoted himself through the Winter.  In February he determined to go, with the rest of his brethren who were leaving the State, but did not know how it could be accomplished.  \"Lydia, how are we to manage?  \"The mob have killed all my stock but one cow, and we can't very well ride her, or drive her alone.\"  \"Can you not make some turn with the cow so that some one will move us?\"  \"Perhaps! At least I can try.\"  After a time a man was found who consented to take them to the Mississippi river for the cow. Accordingly hasty preparations were made, and in the cold Winter, the snow piled up, sometimes to the hubs of the wagon, the husband took his wife and children a journey of two hundred miles.  The snow was scraped away to make their beds, and the cold was ofttimes intense.  Detained through unavoidable circumstances at a small place called Huntsville, they did not reach the river until the first part of May, crossing it and reaching the other side poor, destitute, but oh, so grateful to be once more free! Free to rest from travel and hardships! Free to lie down, and to rise up with their hearts and mouths full of God's praises! Free to live as their conscience prompted them, without the fear of mobs or persecutions!  Once across the river, a low marshy plain covered with grass, stretched away for miles and miles. Here and there a few belts of timber served to relieve the monotony of the landscape, and down swept the waters of the king of American rivers. This was the sight that greeted the weary eyes of our travelers. A small settlement had been started at this place, on the river bank, but the settlers soon deserted it for its unhealthiness was too great to admit of any one living here in comfort for any length of time. One or two empty deserted houses stood here and there, and were soon taken possession of by the first comers.  Our friends, like many others, camped out. They made themselves as comfortable as possible by sewing some of their bed-clothing and the wagon-cover together, thus forming a rude tent.  What a picture this first settling of the place afterwards called Nauvoo must have been! A few houses scattered about, and everywhere tents, bush wickeups and rude shelters of every description dotting the grassy plain. The grass was green, but damp and moist. The water was plentiful and clear, but warm, and over all brooded the wings of the fatal miasma. One by one the families who had been driven from their peaceful homes, found their way across the river and settled here in peace.  Brigham Young had taken charge of this moving host, and the poor were all carefully provided for and moved, through the indomitable energies of Brother Brigham. Joseph was still a prisoner, and so all this responsibility devolved upon the president of the Twelve. History and the grateful hearts of the Saints will testify how well that charge was executed.  A few weeks served to show the people how deadly was the air arising from the swamps and marshes around about.  The sick, infirm and aged were the first victims of the foul miasma. Then little children were prostrated.  Fevers of all kinds contracted in malarious countries were very prevalent. Great numbers of the strong--men and women who had borne every hardship without flinching, lay down in their beds and succumbed to the terrible disease. Ague dragged his shivering, shaking length from door to door, and there were not sufficient strong ones left to bury the dead. Specters instead of men crept slowly about laying those who were sleeping the last sleep in their dreary graves. Pestilence and fever were seated at every fireside. Even Joseph who had escaped from his enemies and came to Nauvoo, soon lay prostrate in his house, and even his yard was filled with the sick, the dying and the dead.  At last the spirit of the invincible Prophet rallied from this blow, and rising up by the power of God he commenced going about healing the sick. Hundreds were so healed; and as the brethren were healed they would arise and follow the Prophet continuing the glorious work. There was a change from this very day. The general health of the people began to improve.  Lydia had managed to wait upon her own ailing child and those of her neighbors who were the most helpless, notwithstanding her health was far from being good. Pale and weak she ministered unto those around her until September, when, worn out with her heavy labors and her body weakened by over-exertion, disease fastened itself upon her and she was prostrated.  For several days and nights she lay in a raging, burning fever, until it almost seemed as though her very flesh would be consumed upon her bones.  One day she called her husband to her bed and said:  \"Newel, go and ask the Prophet to send me a handkerchief with his blessing.\"  \"My dear wife, I do not like to trouble Joseph. You have no idea how worn down he is. He has asked the brethren to spare him as much as possible, for these constant never-ceasing calls upon him are depriving him of all his strength. I hope, my dear, you will soon be better.\"  The night came and passed and morning brought no relief to the weary sufferer.  Again she called Newel to her and entreated him to go to the Prophet and get a handkerchief with his blessing.  Newel went out, and in about half an hour returned, tied a handkerchief over her head saying:  \"There, Lydia, is a handkerchief.\"  The sufferer experienced no relief from it, however, and rapidly grew worse.  A doctor was brought to her, and he tried his best to rally her, but all in vain. Thus one week passed.  One day Newel, seeing she was all but gone and was trying to speak to him, bent over her to catch the faint whisper,  \"Newel, I am all but done with my suffering; good-by, dear one. You must do the best you can with the children. I cannot last much longer.\"  This was very brokenly whispered to the distracted man above her, who, as soon as she ceased, hurried away. Coming back soon, he called her; she knew him but was unable to reply.  \"Here, Lydia, here is a handkerchief from the Prophet Joseph. Oh my wife, the one I brought before was not from him, I so hated to trouble him. But see this is from Joseph, and he says your Heavenly Father shall heal you, and you shall be restored to life and health.\"  The handkerchief was bound around her brow, and as it touched her head, the blessing sent with it, descended upon her; and over her and all through her was poured the spirit of healing. Sleep, so long a stranger to the poor afflicted one, closed her eye-lids in a quiet, restful, blessed slumber.  The hours came and fled, and in the quiet of midnight she awoke, and was like one who had been in a dark, loathsome dungeon, and was again free in the open air and sunshine. In the morning the physician came, and when he saw his patient, he exclaimed:  \"Why, I never saw such a change in my life! That last medicine has worked like a charm, I wish I'd stayed and seen it operate. Her pulse is all right, her tongue is all right, and in fact she is comparatively a well woman.\"  After the docter had praised up himself and his medicine to his heart's content, Newel quietly reached the bottle down from the shelf, and said:  \"Sir, there is the medicine you speak of. My wife has not tasted one drop of it.\"  \"But what's the meaning of all this change then?\"  \"She has been healed by faith through the Prophet Joseph Smith.\"  After studying some time over the matter the docter said:  \"Well it's a good thing to get well on any terms.\"  The good docter soon after departed, as he plainly saw his services were no longer needed. He was not a \"Mormon,\" although a kind, worthy man.  That day Lydia arose and dressed herself, and went forth to her daily cares.  She found her oldest boy, Samuel, well, and full of a desire to help all he could. The little fellow would take his tiny pail and go to the river, thus supplying the family with all the water needed.  This was in the fall of '39, and her little girl was three years old. She also was well and trotting about the house at her baby plays. The babe James, was very ill. Fever had reduced him to a skeleton, and the mother's heart ached as she looked at his wasted body; but not once did she think of his dying.  Newel was also stricken down after this, and a young girl, Newel's niece, Harriet, who lived with them.  From one to the other went Lydia giving simple remedies, praying for them and doing all in her power to relieve their sufferings.  Once in a while the neighbors would come in and try to help her all they could, although they had their own sick ones at home to attend. Whenever they did come, they would say to her:  \"Sister Knight, you can not keep that child; why do you cling so to him? You will displease our Father. Let him go, give him up, and his sufferings will be at an end.\"  \"Oh I cannot think of such a thing!\" replied the quiet woman. \"Father Smith said in my blessing that my heart should not be pained because of the loss of my children. And I cannot, let him go because I"]]]
