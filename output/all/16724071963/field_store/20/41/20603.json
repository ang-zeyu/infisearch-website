Everything else—her superb body, her absolute honesty, her lively sense of humour, her critical attitude towards certain existing things, and, above all, her warm, impulsive young heart—came from that one supreme gift of God which is entirely our own—set high out of reach of those twin busybodies, Heredity and Environment—Personality.                                      *II*   On the particular spring morning with which we are already concerned, Marjorie made a bad start.  She missed prayers altogether, and was late for breakfast into the bargain.  To crown her iniquity, she entered the dining-room whistling a secular air, with her arms full of daffodils.  Whistling is at all times an unladylike accomplishment, even though one whistle like a mavis. Moreover, it was Sunday.  Furthermore, Uncle Fred was present on a visit, and one has to keep up appearances before relations, however despicable.  \"I am not at all satisfied with Doctor Chirnside,\" Mr. Clegg was remarking.  \"But we must employ such instruments as lie to our hands.\"  \"That is very true,\" remarked Uncle Fred, making a mental note of this apt expression. Uncle Fred was an industrious gleaner of other people’s impromptus, with a view to parliamentary requirements.  \"As you know,\" continued Mr. Clegg, \"our own Body is not represented in this county. The nearest United Free Church—which conforms most closely to our own beliefs—is fifteen miles away.  In any case, I consider that a household should, as far as possible, worship in its own district.\"  \"Quite right,\" said Uncle Fred.  \"Like a constituency.\"  \"Besides, we would not get to know people any other way,\" interposed Mrs. Clegg timidly.  \"My dear,\" said Mr. Clegg severely, \"we cannot worship God and Mammon. And I will thank you for another cup of tea.  John, my boy, eat up that crust; I know of many a poor lad that would be glad of it.  The only other places of worship within easy reach,\" he continued, \"besides the parish church (Established, of course), are a Papist Chapel, Burling way, which I do not go to very often\"—Mr. Clegg paused and assumed a wintry smile, to indicate that he spoke sarcastically—\"and the English Episcopal Church at Fiddrie—where I would as soon see any belongings of mine trying to disport themselves as in the Church of Rome itself.\"  Mr. Clegg paused, and Uncle Fred laughed sardonically.  Mrs. Clegg, who all her life had hankered after the comfortable consolations of Anglican ritual and the social cachet of an Anglican connection, smothered a sigh, for she knew to what address her husband’s remark was directed.  At this moment, as related, Marjorie tramped in, whistling, with her daffodils.  \"Hallo! am I late?\" she inquired.  \"I am so sorry: I was out gathering these.  Good morning, everybody!\"  She sat down amid a deathly silence.  \"What were you all talking about?\" Marjorie rattled on.  \"Church, wasn’t it?  I wonder how many hours old Chirnside will preach to-day? Oh, that awful children’s sermon!  I don’t think it’s sportsmanlike to make you listen to two sermons in one morning.  My idea is that during the grown-ups’ sermon the children should be allowed to go out and play, and that during the children’s sermon the grown-ups should have their choice of going out too, or lying right down in the pews and having a nap!\" She gazed out of the window, over the sunny landscape.  \"I know which I should choose!\"  \"My girl,\" interposed Mr. Clegg, \"if you talk in that strain I shall regret more than ever that I allowed your mother to send you to that school in Paris.\"  Marjorie had been \"finished\"—which means \"begun\"—at Neuilly.  It is difficult to understand why her father had sent her there, except that it was expensive.  Mr. Clegg had long transferred the blame for this lapse of judgment to his wife.  During those two quickening years, Marjorie, though hedged about by every preventive device known to the scholastic hierarchy, had fairly wallowed in Life—Life as opposed to Existence. She had sucked in Life through her pores; she had scrutinised Life through her shrewd blue eyes; she had masticated Life with her vigorous young teeth.  Life in Paris, even as viewed from the ranks of a governess-guided \"crocodile\" in the Bois de Boulogne, or a processional excursion to the Tuileries, is a stimulating and disturbing compound, especially to unemancipated seventeen. At any rate, Marjorie had returned to her home possessing certain characteristics which had not been apparent when she left it. These were, roughly, three in number:  Firstly, a passionate interest in the world and its contents.  She was ablaze with enthusiasm for all mankind.  She wanted to do something—to be a hospital nurse, a journalist, a chorus girl, a barmaid—anything, in fact, that would bring her into contact with her fellow-creatures and, if possible, enable her to make herself uncomfortable on their behalf. She was a Giver, through and through.  Secondly, an entire lack of sentimentality. Young men made no appeal to her.  She had never flirted in her life: she did not know how. She made friendships at a rush—many of them with boys of her own age—but if any young man flattered himself that he had made a tender impression, he was soon woefully undeceived. Marjorie was purely maternal.  If she was kind to a young man it was because she felt sorry for him—sorry for his adorable clumsiness, his transparency, his helplessness, his lack of finesse. Young men, as a class, never gave her a thrill. She loved her own sex too, especially the self-conscious and foolish.  Marjorie’s main instinct at that time, and indeed through all her life, was to interpose her own beautiful and vigorous young personality between the weaker vessels of her acquaintance and the hard knocks of this world.  Thirdly, a strongly critical attitude towards the theory that children owe a debt of gratitude to their parents for the mere fact of having been brought by them into existence.  Loyal she was, because it was her nature.  Dutiful she was prepared to be.  She was impulsively affectionate always; but her inborn sense of equity was strong. Moreover, for two years she had associated with new companions—members of another world than her own—either young girls of the English upper class, who were accustomed to regard their parents as amiable but unsophisticated accomplices in misdemeanour, or maidens from New York and Philadelphia, who appeared to entertain no opinion of their parents, as such, at all.  This association had shaken to its foundation the law of her childhood—that children existed entirely for the convenience of their parents, and must expect no consideration, no indulgence, and, above all, no _camaraderie_ from those aloof and exalted beings.  In the spring of nineteen-fourteen Youth had not yet been called in to rescue Age from extinction.  Such was Marjorie at eighteen—a dangerous mixture, particularly liable to explode under compression.  She had risen early this Sunday morning in order to ramble through the woods and compose her turbulent spirit.  The previous evening had witnessed a sleep-destroying interview between her father and herself. After prayers, while Mr. Clegg, according to his custom, was setting the markers in the great family Bible for the following morning’s devotions, Marjorie had seated herself beside him at the head of the library table, with the air of one determined upon a plunge. She waited until the servants had filed out and the rest of the family were dispersed.  Then she came to the attack with characteristic promptness.  \"Father,\" she said, \"may I go and be trained as a hospital nurse?\"  \"No,\" replied Mr. Clegg, without hesitation or heat; \"you may not.\"  \"May I learn shorthand and typewriting, then?\"  \"No.\"  \"May I go and take training in some profession? Any kind,\" she added eagerly, \"as long as it is useful.\"  \"No,\" said Mr. Clegg for the third time.  Then with the air of a just person patient under importunity:  \"Why?\"  \"For two reasons,\" said the girl.  \"I want to be useful, and I want to be independent.\"  For answer, Mr. Clegg reopened the Bible, and with the accuracy of long practice came almost immediately upon what he wanted—certain illuminated manuscript pages occurring between the Old and New Testaments.  There were six of these pages.  Two were allotted to the Births, two to the Marriages, and two to the Deaths of the house of Clegg.  Albert Clegg turned to the Births, and ran his finger down the list.  There were quite a number of names, for the Bible was a family inheritance.  Presently he found what he wanted.  A line in red ink had been drawn right across the page under the name of his youngest brother, Uncle Fred, to indicate the end of a generation.  Below this line was written, in his own neat business hand:                    _Children of Albert and Mary Clegg._   This title-heading had erred on the side of plurality, for beneath it came but one entry—that of the birth of Albert’s eldest son, Amos, at Gateshead, upon the tenth of March, Eighteen Ninety-two.  A second heading followed immediately:                  _Children of Albert and Marjorie Clegg._   After this came quite a satisfying list.  First, Joe’s name—it proved to be Joshua, in full—recorded upon the twelfth of August, Eighteen Ninety-four.  Then came the entry he was seeking:  _Marjorie; born at \"The Laburnums,\" Jesmond, April twenty-fourth, Eighteen Ninety-Six_.  Albert Clegg surveyed his daughter over the top of his spectacles, which had been assumed for purposes of perusal, and performed a small exercise in mental arithmetic.  \"That makes you eighteen,\" he observed.  Marjorie nodded.  At this point, to her intense annoyance, the egregious Uncle Fred re-entered the room and joined the Board.  \"Girls of eighteen—\" began her father.  \"Young ladies of eighteen,\" amended the Member of Parliament.  \"—have no call"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46549"],["title","The Willing Horse: A Novel (#5)"],["body"," be independent,\" continued Albert Clegg; \"and if they want to be of some use they can stay at home and help their mothers, as God meant them to.\"  \"Mother,\" riposted Marjorie, \"has more servants than she knows what to do with, and she hates interference with her house management, anyway. I have been home now for three months, honestly trying to help, and there isn’t a single thing for me to do.  There are hundreds of things I can do away from here.  I do not ask to go out and do them now, but I do ask to be trained in something useful, so that when the time comes—\"  \"When what time comes?\" asked her father quickly.  \"The time when it will be a living impossibility for me to stick it out any longer,\" said Marjorie frankly.  \"Do you think I can sit here for ever\"—with one comprehensive gesture she summarised Netherby, with its stodgy gentility, its squirrel-cage routine, and its cast-iron piety—\"twiddling my thumbs?  Every girl has a _right_ to make herself efficient, nowadays.\"  \"What comes before our rights,\" said Albert Clegg, \"is our duty—our grateful duty to the parents that brought us up.\"  \"_Honour thy father and thy mother_,\" chaunted the apposite Uncle Fred, \"_that thy days—_\"  Marjorie sat up.  \"I hope I do honour my father and mother,\" she said.  \"I am fond of them both: they have been kind to me all my life.  But I do not see why I should be particularly grateful to them for bringing me up.  After all\"—turning to her father—\"you _had_ to, hadn’t you?  You were responsible for my being here, weren’t you?  It seems to me that parents owe a debt to their children—not children to their parents!\"  This amazingly audacious deliverance—and one had to be familiar with the Clegg tradition to realise how audacious it was—produced a stunning silence.  Uncle Fred, fumbling in his repertoire for something really commensurate, breathed alarmingly.  Presently Albert Clegg’s heavy voice broke in:  \"A debt?  You mean I owe _you_ a—a debt of gratitude?\"  \"Not gratitude,\" replied Marjorie.  \"Something bigger—honour.  I think that parents owe it to their children, having brought them into the world—and all that sort of thing,\" she added a little shyly, \"to give them a chance to live the sort of life that appeals to them.\"  Uncle Fred was ready now.  \"The French,\" he announced, \"are a giddy and godless race!\"  But neither Albert Clegg nor his daughter took any notice.  Wide apart as their natures lay, they had one point in common—inflexible determination. Clegg surveyed Marjorie’s curving lips and hot blue eyes for a moment, and asked:  \"So you want to live your own life, eh?\"  Marjorie nodded.  \"Yes,\" she said.  \"At least, I don’t want to rush off and live it right away; but I do think I ought to be given sufficient—\" she hesitated for a word.  \"Equipment?\" suggested her father.  \"Rope?\" amended Uncle Fred.  Marjorie nodded to her father again.  \"Yes,\" she said, \"sufficient equipment.  A girl ought to be capable of doing something.  I have told you some of the things a girl might learn to do, but there are lots of others.  Even if she could support herself on the Stage it would be something.\"  \"_The Stage?_\"  Marjorie had exploded a bombshell this time. Uncle Fred’s goat-beard dropped upon his shirt front, and waggled helplessly.  Albert Clegg gazed at his daughter long and fixedly.  Then he pulled the Bible towards him again, and turned back a page or two in the family record. He twisted the great volume round, and pushed it in his daughter’s direction and pointed.  \"Look at that,\" he said.  Marjorie looked.  Upon the page of births, near the bottom of the list of her father’s brothers and sisters, she saw a horizontal black strip—perhaps a quarter of an inch high—extending the full width of the page, where an entry in the record had been crossed out again, and again, and again, by a thick quill pen.  She had seen it before, and had asked what it meant—without success. Now apparently she was to know.  \"That,\" said Albert Clegg, \"was my youngest sister.\"  \"Your Aunt Eliza,\" added Uncle Fred.  \"When she was nineteen,\" continued Clegg, \"she ran away from home—to go on the Stage.\"  \"Hoo!  Where?\" asked Marjorie, intensely interested.  \"London, my father thought; but he never enquired.\"  \"He never—?  You mean—?\"  \"He blotted her name out of the Book, and it was never mentioned in our home again.\"  \"And not one of you ever tried to find what had become of her?\"  \"Certainly not.\"  Marjorie looked up at her father and drew a long and indignant breath.  \"Well—!\" she began.  \"And now,\" explained Uncle Fred, \"it’s coming out in you, my girl.\"  What was coming out Marjorie did not trouble him to explain.  It is doubtful if she heard him at all.  \"You mean to say,\" she said hotly to her father, \"that your father let his own daughter go right out of sight and mind, just like that?\"  \"He did.  And I want to say to you, my daughter, that I think he was right.  This life is a preparation for the next.  As we live now, so shall we be rewarded hereafter.  A few years’ empty pleasure and excitement are a poor exchange for an eternity of punishment.\"  \"That’s right!  Take no risks!\" recommended the sage at the other end of the table.  \"Safety first!\"  \"The wisest life,\" concluded Mr. Clegg, \"is the safe life.  The safe life is the Christian life, and the sure foundation of the Christian life is family life—united, wisely controlled, family life.  So you will stay at home and live that life; and some day you will be grateful.  Now go to bed. I appreciate your honesty in telling me what is in your mind, but my advice to you is forget all about it.  Good-night!\"  \"Don’t forget your prayers!\" added Uncle Fred.                                     *III*   Marjorie finished her breakfast without further flippancy, and in due course the family set out for church in the Rolls-Royce.  That is to say, Mr. and Mrs. Clegg, Uncle Fred, Marjorie, and the younger children—Miss Amy, already mentioned, and Masters James and John, aged ten and eight—were packed into that spacious vehicle and driven into Craigfoot, with meticulous observation of the speed limit and all the windows up. Amos and Joe followed in the two-seater.  The servants had the waggonette.  The parish kirk at Craigfoot has already been described in some detail, but it may be worth while to record a few observations made from a different angle.  From her seat against the wall in the high-curtained Netherby pew Marjorie could see nothing but the last few rows of the public gallery and the Baronrigg balcony.  The latter fascinated her, for it was always full—usually of interesting, and always of different, people.  Sir Thomas Birnie himself was a permanent figure.  He sat in the left-hand corner of the balcony, at the end nearest the pulpit.  Consequently, his severe gaze, concentrated upon the preacher, was averted from the other occupants of the pew—a circumstance particularly agreeable to some of the younger members of his numerous house parties.  What fun they seemed to have among themselves!  How they giggled and whispered!  Marjorie longed and longed to be with them and of them, especially the girls of her own age.  They were so pretty, so overflowing with life, and dressed so exactly right. For three months, ever since she came back from Paris to find her family at Netherby, and the comfortable hospitality of a Newcastle suburb exchanged for the frigid waiting-list of a county society where one knew either everybody or nobody, she had taken weekly notes of the ever-changing kaleidoscope in the Baronrigg pew—studying faces, studying frocks, studying characters, and weaving histories round each.  Some of the faces were quite familiar.  This morning, for instance, in the right-hand corner of the front row, sat Major Laing.  He was a frequent visitor at Baronrigg, and was a widower. Marjorie knew that his wife had been a twin-sister of the late Lady Birnie.  Then there were Captain and Mrs. Roper.  Captain Roper owned horses, and was here—in fact, the whole house-party was here—for the Castleton Races, the largest meeting on this side of the Border.  They were constant visitors.  Then there was a pretty little woman in a big hat—Mrs. Pomeroy, really—of which Marjorie took mental and quite unsabbatical note.  There was Arthur Langley, one of the best-known gentlemen riders in England.  There was a tall girl with fair hair—not unlike Marjorie herself.  Marjorie decided that this girl was dressed not quite right. She would have been better placed in a fashionable West-end church in London than in this grey, prim, Presbyterian conventicle.  Probably her first visit, Marjorie decided.  She would know better next time.  Her shrewd gaze passed on.  And then, for the first time in her life, she saw Roy Birnie, home after four months of toil and tribulation at an army crammer’s.  He had been plucked out of Eton at Christmas to that end, Eton having decided that it was a case for desperate measures.  Three months of intensive brain-culture had not affected his appearance, which was healthy, nor his snub nose, nor his cheerful grin, nor the slight curl in his hair, of which his mother had once been so proud and of which he was still so ashamed.  He sat on the left of Major Laing, his chin resting on the pew ledge, his grey eyes devoutly closed, and his ebullient spirits throttled down until it should please Doctor Chirnside to conclude the first prayer.  He was exactly like hundreds of other clean-run Public School boys of eighteen.  Marjorie had observed a dozen such in that very pew during the past three months.  But, as already noted, she had never seen Roy.  That usually dependable organ, her heart, missed a couple of beats, and she lowered her head quickly.  Presently, impelled by a power greater than herself (or, indeed, than any of us), she lifted her head and looked up—only to find that Roy was gazing straight down upon her.  For the moment her eyes were interlocked with his.  Then suddenly "]]]
