I am here poor and wretched, because I disobeyed my father; because I did what he desired me not to do. I will tell you all about it, Katy. I became acquainted with the new clerk, John Redburn, and the result of our acquaintance was, that we were married in about a year. We ran away from home; for my father, however much he liked John as a clerk, was not willing that he should be my husband. He forbade John's coming to our house, and forbade my seeing him. I disobeyed him. We were married, and John was discharged. My father refused to see me again.\"  \"That was cruel,\" interposed Katy  \"My father was right, and I have always regretted that I disobeyed him. We came to America, and your father procured a situation in New York, where you were born, about a year after we arrived. For three years we got along very well. I wish I could stop here, Katy, for the rest of the story is very sad.\"  \"Don't tell me any more, mother, it makes you feel so bad, I would rather not hear it. I know now why you value the watch so much, and I hope we shall be able to get it back again.\"  \"I fear not. But you must hear the rest of this sad story.\"  Mrs. Redburn continued the narrative, though tears blinded her eyes, and sobs chocked her utterance, as she told of the struggle she had had with poverty and want. Her husband had done very well in New York; and, gay and light-hearted in the midst of his prosperity, his habits had been gradually growing worse and worse, till he lost his situation, and became a common sot. The poor wife had then been compelled to toil for her own support and that of her child; and having been brought up in luxury and ease, it was a dreadful task to her.  John obtained another situation, but soon lost it. He was a good-hearted man when he had not been drinking, and keenly felt the disgrace and misery he was heaping upon himself and his unhappy wife. Once he had the resolution to abandon the cup, fully determined to redeem his lost character, and make his family happy again. The better to accomplish this, he removed to Boston, where he obtained a good situation, and for more than a year he adhered to his resolution. Mrs. Redburn was happy again and tremblingly hoped that the clouds of darkness had forever passed away.  The evil time came again, and John Redburn sank down lower than ever before. His wife lost all hope of him, and struggled, with the courage of a hero and the fortitude of a martyr, against the adverse tide that set against her. She was fortunate in obtaining plenty of sewing, and was able to support herself and child very well; but her husband, now lost to all sense of decency, contrived to obtain, from time to time, a portion of her hard earnings. She could never have believed that John Redburn would come to this; for, as a clerk in her father's counting room, he had been all that was good and noble; but there he was a miserable sot, lost to himself, to his family, and the world.  One morning in winter he was brought home to her dead. He had died in the watch-house of delirium tremens. He was buried, and peace, if not hope, settled on the brow of the broken-hearted wife.  Year after year Mrs. Redburn struggled on, often with feeble hands and fainting heart, to earn a subsistence for herself and Katy. She had been bred in opulence, and her wants were not so few and simple as the wants of those who have never enjoyed the luxury of a soft couch and a well-supplied table. She had never learned that calculating economy which provides a great deal with very small means.  Hence it was much harder for her to support herself and child, than it would have been for one who had been brought up in a hovel.  She had done very well, however, until, a few months before our story opens, she had been taken sick, and was no longer able to work. Her disease was an affection of the spine, which was at times very painful, and confined her to the bed.  \"But where is your father now?\" asked Katy, when her mother had finished the narrative.  \"I do not know; if he is alive, he probably lives in Liverpool.\"  \"Why don't you write a letter to him?\"  \"I have done so several times, but have never received any reply. I wrote shortly after your father died, giving an account of my situation. I am sure my father never could have got my letter, or he would have answered me. I know he would not let me suffer here in woe and want, if he were aware of my condition.\"  \"Why don't you write again?\"  \"It is useless.\"  \"Let me write, mother. I will call him dear grandfather, and I am sure he will send you some money then: perhaps he will send for us to go to Liverpool, and live in his great house, and have servants to wait upon us.\"  \"Alas, my child, I have given up all hope of ever seeing him again in this world. In my letters I confessed my fault, and begged his forgiveness. He cannot be alive, or I am sure my last letters would have melted his heart.\"  \"Haven't you any brothers and sisters, mother?\"  \"I had one sister; and I have written several letters to her, but with no better success. They may be all dead. I fear they are.\"  \"And your mother?\"  \"She died when I was young. I know Jane would have answered my letters if she had received them.\"  \"She was your sister?\"  \"Yes; she must be dead; and I suppose my father's property must be in the hands of strangers, covering their floors with soft carpets, and their tables with nice food, while I lie here in misery, and my poor child actually suffers from hunger;\" and the afflicted mother clasped her daughter in her arms, and wept as though her heart would burst.  \"Don't cry, mother. I was not very hungry. We have had enough to eat till to-day. I am going to take care of you now, you have taken care of me so long,\" replied Katy, as she wiped away the tears that flowed down her mother's wan cheek.  \"What can you do, poor child?\"  \"I can do a great many things; I am sure I can earn money enough to support us both.\"  \"It is hard to think how much I have suffered, and how much of woe there may be in the future for me,\" sobbed Mrs. Redburn.  \"Don't cry, mother. You know what it says on the watch--'All for the Best.' Who knows but that all your sorrows are for the best?\"  \"I hope they are; I will try to think they are. But it is time for you to go. Pawn the watch for as much as you can; and I trust that some fortunate event will enable us to redeem it.\"  Katy took the watch, smoothed down her hair again, put on her worn-out bonnet, and left the house.    CHAPTER III.  KATY AND MASTER SIMON SNEED VISIT THE PAWNBROKER'S SHOP.  The court in which Katy lived had once been the abode of many very respectable families, to use a popular word, for respectable does not always mean worthy of respect on account of one's virtues, but worthy of respect on account of one's lands, houses, and money. In the former sense it was still occupied by very respectable families, though none of them possessed much of the \"goods that perish in the using\" Mrs. Redburn, the seamstress, was very respectable; Mrs. Colvin, the washer-woman, was very respectable, so were Mrs. Howard, the tailoress, Mr. Brown, the lumper, and Mr. Sneed, the mason.  Katy's mother lived in a small house, with three other families. She occupied two rooms, for which she paid four dollars a month, the amount of rent now due and unpaid. Dr. Flynch took a great deal of pleasure in telling Mrs. Redburn how his humanity and his regard for the welfare of the poor had induced him to fix the rent at so cheap a rate; but he always finished by assuring her that this sum must be promptly paid, and that no excuses could ever have any weight.  The next house to Mrs. Redburn was tenanted by Mr. Sneed, the mason. I don't know whether I ought to say that Mr. Sneed had a son, or that Master Simon Sneed had a father, being at a loss to determine which was the more important personage of the two; but I am not going to say anything against either of them, for the father was a very honest mason and the son was a very nice young man.  Katy knocked at the door of this house, and inquired for Master Simon Sneed. She was informed that he had not yet finished his dinner; and she decided to wait in the court till he made his appearance. Seating herself on the door stone, she permitted her mind to wander back to the narrative her mother had related to her. She glanced at her coarse clothes, and could hardly believe that her grandfather was a rich merchant, and lived in a fine house. How nice it would be if she could only find the old gentleman! He could not be cross to her; he would give her all the money she could spend, and make a great lady of her.  \"Pooh! what a fool I am to think of such a thing!\" exclaimed she impatiently, as she rose from the door stone. \"I am a beggar, and what right have I to think of being a fine lady, while my poor sick mother has nothing to eat and drink? It is very hard to be so poor, but I suppose it is all for the best.\"  \"Do you want me, Katy?\" said a voice from the door, which Katy recognized as that of Master Simon Sneed.  \"I want to see you very much,\" replied Katy.  \"Wait a moment, and I will join you.\"  And in a moment Master Simon Sneed did join her; but he is so much of a curiosity, and so much of a character, that I must stop to tell my young readers all about him.  Master Simon Sneed was about fifteen years old, and tall enough to have been two years older. He was very slim, and held his head very straight. In 1843, the period of which I write, it was the fashion for gentlemen to wear straps upon their pantaloons; and accordingly Master Simon Sneed wore straps on his pantaloons, though, it is true, the boys in the street used to laugh and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/484"],["title","Poor and Proud; Or, The Fortunes of Katy Redburn: A Story for Young Folks (#3)"],["body","at him for doing so; but they were very ill-mannered boys, and could not appreciate the dignity of him they insulted.  Master Sneed's garments were not of the finest materials, but though he was a juvenile dandy, it was evident that it required a great deal of personal labor to make him such.  Clearly those straps were sewed on by himself, and clearly those cowhide shoes had been thus elaborately polished by no other hands than his own. In a word, the appearance of his clothes, coarse as was their texture, and unfashionable as was their cut, indicated the most scrupulous care. It was plain that he had a fondness for dress, which his circumstances did not permit him to indulge to any very great extent.  Master Simon Sneed was a great man in his own estimation; and, as he had read a great many exciting novels, and had a good command of language, he talked and acted like a great man. He could hold his own in conversation with older and wiser persons than himself. He could astonish almost any person of moderate pretensions by the largeness of his ideas; and, of late years, his father had not pretended to hold an argument with him, for Simon always overwhelmed him by the force and elegance of his rhetoric. He spoke familiarly of great men and great events.  His business relations--for Master Sneed was a business man--were not very complicated. According to his own reckoning, he was the chief person in the employ of Messrs. Sands & Co., wholesale and retail dry good Washington Street; one who had rendered immense service to the firm, and one without whom the firm could not possibly get along a single day; in short, a sort of Atlas, on whose broad shoulders the vast world of the Messrs. Sands & Co.'s affairs rested. But according to the reckoning of the firm, and the general understanding of people, Master Simon was a boy in the store, whose duty it was to make fires, sweep out, and carry bundles, and, in  consideration of the fact that he boarded himself to receive two dollars and a half a week for his services. There was a vast difference between Master Simon Sneed's estimate of Masters Simon Sneed, and the Messrs. Sands & Co.'s idea of Master Simon Sneed.  But I beg my young friends not to let anything I have written create a prejudice against him, for he was really a very kind-hearted young man, and under certain circumstances would have gone a great way to oblige a friend. He had always been exceedingly well disposed towards Katy; perhaps it was because the simple-hearted little girl used to be so much astonished when he told her about his mercantile relations with the firm of Sands & Co.; and how he managed all their business for them after the store was closed at night, and before the front door was unlocked in the morning; how he went to the bank after immense sums of money; and how the firm would have to give up business if he should die, or be obliged to leave them. Katy believed that Master Simon was a great man, and she wondered how his long, slim arms could accomplish so much labor, and how his small head could hold such a heap of magnificent ideas. But Master Simon, notwithstanding his elevated position in the firm, was condescending to her; he had more than once done her a favor and had always expressed a lively interest in her welfare. Therefore she did not scruple to apply to him in the present emergency.  \"Well, Katy, in what manner can I serve you?\" inquired Simon, as he elevated his head, and stood picking his teeth before her.  \"I want you to do something for me very much indeed.\"  \"State your business, Katy.\"  \"Dr. Flynch has been to our house to-day, and wants the rent; mother hasn't any money----\"  \"And you wish me to lend you the amount?\" continued Simon, when Katy hesitated to reveal the family trouble. \"It is really unfortunate, Katy; it is after bank hours now, and I don't see that I can accommodate you.\"  \"O, I don't want to borrow the money.\"  \"Ah, you don't.\"  \"I have got a watch here, which belonged to my father; and I want to pawn it for the money to pay the rent.\"  \"Well, it is rather out of our line of business to lend money on collateral.\"  \"I don't want you to lend it. I want you to take it to the pawnbroker's. Mother says I am so young and so small that they might cheat me; and I thought perhaps, may be, you'd be so kind as to go with me.\"  \"Go with you!\" exclaimed Master Simon, as he eyed her coarse, ill-made garments.  \"I thought you would,\" replied Katy, with a look of disappointment.  \"Well, Katy, I shall be very glad to assist you in this matter, but----\"  Master Simon paused, and glanced again at the unfashionable dress of the suppliant. He was, as he said, willing to aid her; but the idea of the principal personage of the house of Sands & Co. walking through the streets of the great city with such an ill-dressed young lady was absurd, and not to be tolerated. Master Sneed reflected. It is undoubtedly true that \"where there is a will there is a way.\"  \"Where do you wish to go?\" demanded he.  \"I don't know.\"  \"Do you know where Brattle Street is?\"  \"I don't, but I can find it.\"  \"Very well; important business in another street requires my personal attention for a moment, but I will join you in Brattle Street in a quarter of an hour, and attend you to a pawnbroker's.\"  \"Thank you.\"  Master Sneed gave her directions so that she could find the street, and at the end of the court, as she turned one way, he turned the other.  Katy was first at the appointed place of meeting, where Simon soon joined her; and directing her to follow him, he led the way into another street, and entered a shop.  \"This young person wishes to raise some money on a watch,\" said Simon, as he directed the attention of the astonished broker to Katy, who was scarcely tall enough to be seen over the high counter.  \"Let me see it.\"  Katy handed up the watch, which the money lender opened and carefully examined. His practised eye soon discovered that the works of the watch were of the best quality.  \"Where did you get this?\" asked the broker.  \"My mother gave it to me;\" and Katy told without reserve the pitiful story of want and destitution which compelled Mrs. Redburn to part with the cherished memento of the past.  \"I will give you three dollars for the watch,\" added the broker.  \"Come, come, sir,\" interposed Master Simon, with a smile; \"that is a little too bad. A gentleman of your judgment and discretion has already assured himself that the article is worth at least twenty.\"  The broker drew a long breath after this speech, and seemed very much impressed by the style of the remark. But Katy declared she did not want to sell the watch, only to pawn it.  \"Your story is not a very plausible one,\" said the broker, \"and there is some risk in taking it.\"  \"I give you my personal assurance, on honor that her story is all true,\" added Simon.  The broker burst out into a loud laugh. He could not stand Simon's fine speeches, and would not take the watch at any rate; so they departed to find another place, and entered a shop close by.  \"Where did you get this?\" asked the broker sourly, and Katy repeated her story, and Simon vouched for its truth.  \"It is all a lie,\" exclaimed the broker, \"I will put the watch into my safe and hand it over to the police.\"  \"This is a most extraordinary proceeding,\" protested Master Simon.  \"Get out of the shop, both of you, or I will hand you over to the police! You stole the watch, and have the audacity to bring it into the shop of an honest man. I don't buy stolen goods.\"  Katy began to cry, as the last hope of redemption from the fangs of Dr. Flynch fled. Even Master Simon Sneed was alarmed at the idea of being handed over to the police; but his sense of dignity compelled him to enter his earnest protest, against the proceeding of the broker, and even to threaten him with the terrors of the law. The money-lender repeated his menace, and even went to the door, for the apparent purpose of putting it into execution.  \"Come, Katy, let us go; but I assure you I will represent this outrage to my friend the mayor, in such a manner that entire justice shall be done you,\" whispered Simon. \"I cannot remain any longer away from my business, or I would recover the watch at once.\"  \"O, dear! my poor mother!\" sobbed Katy.  \"Don't cry, my child; leave it all to me, and run home as fast as you can. You shall have the watch again, for I will call in the whole police force of Boston to your aid;\" and Master Simon ran away to attend to the affairs of Sands & Co., which Katy innocently concluded must be suffering by this time from his absence.  Poor Katy! with a heavy heart she wandered home to tell her mother of this new misfortune.    CHAPTER IV.  KATY MATURES A MAGNIFICENT SCHEME.  \"I suppose it is all for the best, mother,\" said Katy, when she had told her sad story of disappointment. \"I can't get those words out of my head, since you have told me about my father. I feel just as though everything would come out right, it does go very bad just now.\"  \"I am glad you feel so, Katy,\" added Mrs. Redburn. \"It will make you much better contented with your lot. I have suffered so much that I cannot help repining a little, though I feel that my destiny and yours is in the hands of the wise Father, who bringeth good out of evil.\"  Katy had not yet reached that spirit of meek submission to the will of Heaven which looks upward in the hour of trial, not doubting that the all-wise God knows best what is for the good of his children. If she believed that misfortunes were all for the best, it was only an impulse derived from the story of her father; a kind of philosophy which was very convenient for the evil day, because it permitted the sufferer to lie down and take things easily. It was not a filial trust in the wisdom and mercy of the heavenly Father that sustained her as the clouds grew thicker and blacker around her; it was only a cold indifference, a feeling of the head rather than the heart.  But Mrs."]]]
