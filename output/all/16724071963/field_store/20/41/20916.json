The golden apples       Within her garden   Restored you your strength and your youth,   Ate ye thereof each day.       The garden's guardian       In pledge has been given.       On the branches dries       And droops the fruit,   To drop soon and decay.       My loss is lighter,   For still did Freia,       Stingy to me,   Stint the delectable fruit.       Not half as godlike   Am I, ye high ones, as you!          [_Freely, but quickly and harshly._        But ye trusted solely       To the fruit that makes young,   As well both the giants wist.       Your life they played for,       Plotted to take;   Contrive so that they fail.       Lacking the apples,       Old and worn,       Grey and weary,   Wasting, the scoff of the world,   The Gods must pine and pass.  FRICKA [_Anxiously_        Wotan, alas!       Unhappy man!       See what thy laughing       Lightness has brought us--   Scoff and scorn for all!  WOTAN [_Coming to a sudden resolve, starts up._        Up, Loge,       And follow me!   To Nibelheim hastening downward,   I go in search of the gold.  LOGE        The Rhine-daughters       Thy aid invoked:   Not vainly they hoped for thy help then?  WOTAN [_Angrily._        Fool, be silent!       Freia, the fair one--   Freia's ransom we go for.  LOGE        Where thou wouldst go       Gladly I lead.       Shall we dive   Sheer through the depths of the Rhine?  WOTAN        Not through the Rhine.  LOGE        Then swift let us swing       Through this smoky chasm.   Together, come, creep we in!          [_He goes in front and vanijhes at the side through         a cleft, from which, immediately afterwards,         sulphurous vapour streams forth._  WOTAN        Ye others wait       Till evening here;       The golden ransom   When got will again make us young.          [_He descends after Loge into the chasm. The         sulphurous vapour which rises from it spreads over         the whole stage and quickly fills it with thick         clouds. Those who remain behind are soon hidden._  DONNER        Fare thee well, Wotan!  FROH        Good luck! Good luck!  FRICKA        O come back soon       To thy sorrowing wife!          [_The sulphurous vapour darkens till it becomes a         black cloud, which rises upwards from below. This         then changes to a dark, rocky cavern which keeps         rising, so that the stage seems to sink deeper and         deeper into the earth._     THIRD SCENE   _From various points in the distance ruddy lights gleam out. An increasing clamour, as of smiths at work, is heard on all sides. The clang of the anvils dies away. A vast subterranean chasm becomes visible which seems to open into narrow gorges on all sides. Alberich drags the screaming Mime out of a side cleft._    ALBERICH        Héhé! Héhé!       Come here! Come here!       Mischievous dwarf!       Prettily pinched       Promptly thou'lt be       Hast thou not ready,       Wrought to my wish,   The dainty thing I desire!  MIME [_Howling._        Ohé! Ohé!       Oh! Oh!       Let me alone!       It is forged;       Heeding thy hest       I laboured hard       Till it was done!   Take but thy nails from my ear!  ALBERICH        Then why this delay       To show thy work?  MIME        I feared that something       Might still be wanting.  [Illustration: Plate 10     MIME, howling.         \"Ohé! Ohé!         Oh! Oh!\"]  ALBERICH        What is there to finish?  MIME [_Embarrassed._        Here--and there----  ALBERICH        How here and there?       Hand me the thing!          [_He tries to catch hold of his ear again. In his         terror Mime drops a piece of metal-work which he         has been clutching convulsively. Alberich picks it         up hastily and examines it with care._        Rogue, observe!       See how all wrought is       Well finished and feat,       Done as desired!       The simpleton wants       Slyly to trick me       And keep by cunning       The wonderful work,       Though all his skill       Came alone from my craft.   Thou art discovered, thief.          [_He puts the Tarnhelm on his head._    The helmet fits the head;   But will the spell prosper too?          [_Very softly._        \"Night and darkness,       Seen of none!\"          [_He vanishes, and a pillar of cloud takes his         place._        Brother, canst see me?  MIME [_Looks round in amaze._    Where art thou? I see no one.  ALBERICH [_Invisible._        Then feel me instead,       Thou lazy scamp!   Take that for thy thievish thoughts!  MIME          [_Writhes under the lathes he receives, the sound         of which is heard without the whip being seen._        Ohé! Ohé!       Oh! Oh! Oh!  ALBERICH [_Invisible and laughing._        Ha! ha! ha!       Ha! ha! ha!       I thank thee, blockhead;   Thy work has stood the test.       Hoho! Hoho!       Nibelungs all       Bow now to Alberich!       For he is everywhere,       Waiting and watching;       Peace and rest       Are past for ever;       Ye must all serve him,       Though see him can none;       Where he cannot be spied       Look out for his coming;   None shall escape from his thraldom!  [_Harshly._        Hoho! hoho!       Hearken, he nears:       The Nibelung's lord!          [_The pillar of cloud disappears in the background.         Alberich's scolding voice is heard more and more         faintly. Mime lies huddled up in pain. Wotan and         Loge come down through a cleft in the rock._  LOGE       Nibelheim here.       Through pale mists gleaming,   How bright yonder fiery sparks glimmer!  MIME       Oh! Oh! Oh!  WOTAN        I hear loud groans.       Who lies on the ground?  [Illustration: Plate 11, Mime writhes under the lashes he receives.]  LOGE [_Bends over Mime._        Why all this whimpering noise?  MIME        Ohé! Ohé!       Oh! Oh!  LOGE        Hei, Mime! Merry dwarf!       Who beats and bullies thee so?  MIME        Leave me in peace, pray.  LOGE        So much is certain,       And more still. Hark!   Help I promise thee, Mime!          [_He raises him with difficulty._  MIME        What help for me?       To do his bidding       My brother can force me,   For I am bound as his slave.  LOGE        But, Mime, how has he       Thus made thee his thrall?  MIME        By evil arts       Fashioned Alberich       A yellow ring,       From the Rhinegold forged,       At whose mighty magic       Trembling we marvel;   This spell puts in his power   The Nibelung hosts of night.       Happy we smiths       Moulded and hammered,       Making our women       Trinkets to wear--   Exquisite Nibelung toys--   And lightly laughed at our toil.       The rogue now compels us       To creep into caverns,       For him alone       To labour unthanked.       Through the golden ring       His greed can divine       Where untouched treasure       In hidden gorge gleams.       We still must keep spying,       Peering and delving:       Must melt the booty,       Which, molten, we forge       Without pause or peace,   To heap up higher his hoard.  LOGE        Just now, then, an idler       Roused him to wrath?  MIME        Poor Mime, ah!       My lot was the hardest.       I had to work,       Forging a helmet,       With strict instructions       How to contrive it;       And well I marked       The wondrous might       Bestowed by the helm       That from steel I wrought.       Hence I had gladly       Held it as mine,       And, by its virtue   Risen at last in revolt:       Perchance, yes, perchance   The master himself I had mastered,   And, he in my power, had wrested   The ring from him and used it   That he might serve me, the free man,          [_Harshly_      As now I must serve him, a slave!  LOGE        And wherefore, wise one,       Sped not the plan?  MIME    Ah! though the helm I fashioned,   The magic that lurks therein   I foolishly failed to divine.       He who set the task       And seized the fruits--       From him I have learnt,       Alas I but too late!   All the helmet's cunning craft.       From my sight he vanished,       But, viciously lashing,   Swung his arm through unseen.          [_Howling and sobbing._        This, fool that I am,       Was all my thanks!          [_He rubs his back. Wotan and Loge laugh._  LOGE [_To Wotan._        Confess, our task       Will call for skill.  WOTAN        Yet the foe will yield,       Use thou but fraud.  MIME [_Observes the Gods more attentively._        Who are you, ye strangers       That ask all these questions?  LOGE        Friends to thee,       Who from their straits   Will free all the Nibelung folk.  MIME [_Shrinking back in fear when he hears Alberich returning._        Hark! Have a care!       Alberich comes!          [He runs to and fro in terror.  WOTAN        We'll wait for him here.          [_He sits down calmly on a stone. Alberich, who         has taken the Tarnhelm from his head and hung it         on his girdle, is brandishing his scourge and         driving before him a band of Nibelungs from the         gorges below. These are laden with gold and silver         treasure, which, urged on by Alberich, they pile up         so as to form a large heap._  ALBERICH        Hither! Thither!       Héhé! Hoho!       Lazy herd!       Haste and heap       Higher the hoard.       Up with thee there!       On with thee here!       Indolent dolts,       Down with the treasure!       Need ye my urging?       Here with it all!          [_He suddenly perceives Wotan and Loge._        Hey! Who are they       That thus intrude?       Mime! Come here!       Rascally rogue!       Gossiping art       With the pilgriming pair?       Off, thou idler!   Back to thy bellows and beating!          [_Lashing Mime, he chases him into the crowd of         Nibelungs._        Hey! to your labour!       Get ye all hence now!       Swing ye down swift!   From the virgin gorges   Get me the gold!

That labour ye shirk not   Mime be surety,   Or surely the lash   Of my whip will find him;   That where no one would guess   I watch and I wander,   None knows it better than he.   Loitering still?   Lingering there?  [Illustration: Plate 12, Alberich drives in a band of Nibelungs laden with gold and silver treasure.]          [_He pulls the ring from his finger, kisses it and         stretches it out in menace._        Fear ye and tremble,       O fallen host,       And obey       The ring's dread lord!          [_Howling and shrieking, the Nibelungs, among them         Mime, scatter, and creep down into the clefts in         all directions._  ALBERICH        What seek ye here?          [_Looks long and distrustfully at Wotan and Loge._  WOTAN    From Nibelheim's gloomy realm   Strange tidings have travelled up,       Tales of wonders       Worked here by Alberich;       And, greedy of marvels,   Hither came we as guests.  ALBERICH        By envy urged,       Hither ye hie.       Such doughty guests   I do not mistake.  LOGE        Since I am known,       Ignorant elf,       Say then, with growling       Whom dost thou greet?       In caverns cold       Where once thou didst crouch,       Who gave thee light       And fire for thy comfort,   Had Loge not smiled on thee?       Or what hadst thou fashioned   Had not I heated thy forge?       I am thy kinsman       And once was kind:   Lukewarm, methinks, are thy thanks!  ALBERICH         On light-born elves        Laughs now Loge,        The crafty rogue:    Art thou, false one, their friend    As my friend thou wert once,        Haha! I laugh!    No harm from such need I fear.  LOGE        No cause then for thy distrust.  ALBERICH        I can trust thy falsehood,       Not thy good faith!          [_Taking up a defiant attitude._    Yet I dare you all unflinching.  LOGE        'Tis thy might       That makes thee so bold;       Grimly great       Groweth thy power.  ALBERICH        Seest thou the hoard       Yonder heaped       High by my host?  LOGE    A richer one never was seen.  ALBERICH        A wretched pile       Is this to-day, though.       Boldly mounting,   'Twill be bigger henceforward.  WOTAN    But what is gained by the hoard   In joyless Nibelheim,   Where wealth finds nothing to buy?  ALBERICH        Treasure to gather       And treasure to garner--   Thereto Nibelheim serves.       But with the hoard       In the caverns upheaped   Wonders all wonder surpassing       Will I perform   And win the whole world and its fairness.  WOTAN        But, my friend, how compass that goal?  ALBERICH    Ye who live above and breathe       The balmy, sweet airs,       Love and laugh:       A hand of gold   Ere long, O ye Gods, will have gripped you!   As I forswore love, even so       No one alive       But shall forswear it;       By golden songs wooed,   For gold alone will his greed be.       On hills of delight       Your home is, where gladness       Softly lulls;       The dark elves   Ye despise, O deathless carousers!       Beware!       Beware!       For first your men       Shall bow to my might;       Then your women fair       Who my wooing spurned   The dwarf will force to his will,   Though frowned on by love.          [_Laughing savagely._        Ha! ha! ha! ha!       Mark ye my word?       Beware!   Beware of the hosts of the night,   When rise shall the Nibelung hoard   From silent depths to the day!  WOTAN [_Furiously._        Avaunt, impious fool!  ALBERICH        What says he?  LOGE [_Stepping between them._        Cease from thy folly!          [_To Alberich._    Who would gaze not in wonder,   Beholding Alberich's work?   If only thy skill can achieve   Everything hope has promised,   Almighty I needs must acclaim thee!       For moon and stars       And the sun in his glory,   Forced to do thee obeisance,   Even they must bow down.   But what would seem of most moment       Is that they who serve thee,       The Nibelung hosts,   Bow and bear no hate.   When thy hand held forth a ring   Thy folk were stricken with fear.       But in thy sleep       A thief might slip up   And steal slyly the ring.   Say, how wouldst thou save thyself then?  ALBERICH    Most shrewd to himself seems Loge;       Others always       Figure as fools.       If I had to ask for       Advice or aid       On bitter terms,   How happy the thief would be!       This helmet that hides       I schemed for myself,       And chose for its smith   Mime, finest of forgers.       I am now able       Swift to assume       Any form that I fancy,       Through the helm.       No one sees me,       Search as he will;       Though everywhere hidden,       I always am there.       So, fearing nothing,   Even from thee I am safe,   Most kind, careful of friends!  LOGE        I have met       Full many a marvel,       But one so wondrous       Have never known.       Achievement so matchless       Scarce can I credit.   Were this possible, truly   Thy might indeed were eternal.  ALBERICH        Dost thou believe       I lie, as would Loge?  LOGE        Till it is proved   I must suspect thy word.  ALBERICH        Puffed up with wisdom,       The fool will explode soon:       Of envy then die!   Decide to what I shall change;   In that form I shall stand.  LOGE        Nay, choose for thyself,   But strike me dumb with amaze.  ALBERICH [_Puts the Tarnhelm on his head._        \"Dragon dread,       Wreathe thou and wriggle!\"          [_He immediately disappears. An enormous serpent         writhes on the floor in his place. It rears and         threatens Wotan and Loge with its open jaws._  LOGE [_Pretends to be terrified._        Ohé!  ALBERICH [_Laughing._    Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!  LOGE        Ohé! Ohé!       Horrible dragon,       O swallow me not!   Spare the life of poor Loge!  WOTAN        Good, Alberich!       Well done, rascal!       How swiftly grew   The dwarf to the dragon immense!          [_The dragon disappears and, in its stead, Alberich         is again seen in his own shape._  ALBERICH        He he! Ye scoffers,       Are ye convinced?  [Illustration: Plate 13        \"Ohé! Ohé!         Horrible dragon,         O swallow me not!     Spare the life of poor Loge!\"]  LOGE [_In a trembling voice._    My trembling tells thee how truly.       A giant snake       Thou wert in a trice.       Having beheld,   I just credit the wonder.       Couldest thou turn       To something quite tiny       As well as bigger?   Methinks that way were best   For slyly slipping from foes;   That, though, I fear were too hard!  ALBERICH        For thee, yes;       Thou art so dull!       How small shall I be?  LOGE    The most cramped of crannies must hold thee   That hides the timorous toad.  ALBERICH        Nothing simpler!       Look at me now!          [_He puts the Tarnhelm on his head again._        \"Crooked toad,       Creep and crawl there!\"          [_He vanishes. The Gods see a toad on the rocks         creeping towards them._  LOGE [_To Wotan._        Quick and catch it!       Capture the toad!          [_Wotan sets his foot on the toad. Loge makes a         dash at its head and holds the Tarnhelm in his         hand._  ALBERICH          [_Is suddenly seen in his own shape writhing under         Wotan's foot._        Ohé! I'm caught!       My curse upon them!  LOGE        Hold him fast       Till he is bound.          [_Loge binds his hands and feet with a rope._        Now swiftly up!       Then he is ours.          [_Both seize hold of the prisoner, who struggles         violently, and drag him towards the shaft by which         they descended. They disappear mounting upwards._     FOURTH SCENE           _The scene has changed as before, only in reverse         order. Open space on mountain heights. The prospect         is veiled by pale mist as at the end of the second         scene. Wotan and Loge climb up out of the cavern,         bringing with them Alberich bound._    LOGE        Here, kinsman,       Thou canst sit down!       Friend, look round thee;       There lies the world   That was thine for the winning, thou fool!       What corner, say,   Wilt give to me for my stall?          [_He dances round Alberich, snapping his fingers._  ALBERICH        Infamous robber!       Thou knave! Thou rogue!       Loosen the rope,       Set me at large,   Or dear for this outrage shalt answer!  WOTAN        My captive art thou,       Caught and in fetters.       As thou hadst fain       Subdued the world   And all that the world containeth,   Thou liest bound at my feet,   And, coward, canst not deny it.       A ransom alone       Shall loose thee from bondage.  ALBERICH        Ah, the dolt,       The dreamer I was,       To trust blindly       The treacherous thief!       Fearful revenge       Shall follow this wrong!  LOGE        Vain talk this of vengeance   Before thy freedom is won.       To a man in bonds   No free man expiates outrage.       If vengeance thou dreamest,       Dream of the ransom   First without further delay!          [_He shows him the kind of ransom by snapping his         fingers._  ALBERICH    Declare then your demands.  WOTAN    The hoard and thy gleaming gold.  ALBERICH    Pack of unscrupulous thieves!          [_Aside._    If I only can keep the ring,   The hoard I can lightly let go,       For anew I could win it       And add to its worth   By the powerful spell of the ring.       If as warning it serves       To make me more wise,   The warning will not have been lost,   Even though lost may be the gold.  WOTAN        Wilt yield up the hoard?  ALBERICH       Loosen my hand      To summon it here.          [_Loge frees his right hand._  ALBERICH          [_Touches the ring with his lips and secretly         murmurs the command._        Behold the Nibelungs       Hither are called;       I can hear them coming,       Bid by their lord,   With the hoard from the depths to the day.   Now loosen these burdensome bonds.  WOTAN        Nay,"]]]
