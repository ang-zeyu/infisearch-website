Each line spoke for itself.” Norma laughed. “We called it the musical switchboard.”  “And you say you’ve never worked?” The examiner laughed.  “That! Why, that was just fun!”  “Perhaps it was. The best work in the world is the kind we can think of as fun. All that time you were fitting yourself for two of our most important departments—Communication and Interceptor Control.”  “Can—can you really use me?” Norma was close to tears.  “Can we? Oh! My child!” The examiner all but embraced her. “We’ll make a major out of you! See if we don’t!”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   CHAPTER III                            INTERCEPTOR CONTROL   Norma was not long in discovering the reason for that last surprising outburst of her examiner. When at last the report was finished, they looked up to find the row of chairs empty.  “Well!” the examiner breathed. “That’s all for today. This,” she added, “is not my regular work. My training was finished many weeks ago. I have been away from the Fort for some time doing a—well” she hesitated—“a rather special sort of work. Now I’m back for a brief spell. They were shorthanded here.”  “So you’ve been helping out?”  “That’s it.” The examiner rose. Norma too stood. “We all have one great purpose. Each of us must do what she can wherever she is.”  “To bring this terrible war to an end,” Norma added.  “You’re right again,” the other smiled.  “Whew!” she exclaimed after looking Norma over from head to toe. “You certainly do look fit.”  “I should,” Norma grinned. “Our college has put us through _some_ training, I can tell you. We marched five miles bare-legged in shorts, with the snow blowing across the field!”  “Climbed fences. I’ll bet.” The examiner smiled.  “Yes, and walls too. We did gym work and took corrective exercises.”  “Grand! They were preparing you for—”  “Just anything.”  “That’s swell. My name is Warren.” The officer put out a hand. “Lieutenant Rita Warren, to be exact. I’m going up to Boom Town. Want to go along?”  “I’d love to!”  “Right! Then come. Let’s go.” Swinging into the regulation thirty-inch stride, Lieutenant Warren marched out of the hall with her recruit and along the snow-lined path.  “That Interceptor Control sounds intriguing,” Norma said as they marched over the crusted snow.  “Oh, it is! It really is!” Lieutenant Warren’s face glowed. “The most interesting work in the world. I’ll tell you a little about it. But don’t let me tell you too much.”  “I’ll flash the red light.” Norma laughed, as she asked, “How much is too much?”  Lieutenant Warren did not answer, instead, she said, “We are stationed along the seacoast.”  “Just any seacoast?”  “Any coast of America. There are a number of us in each group. We take over some small hotel. The hotel is run just for us.”  “Must be grand!”  “Oh, it is! But we don’t have much time to think of that. We have work to do. Plenty of it. You see, along every coast there are thousands and thousands of volunteer watchers. They are there day and night.”  “Watching for enemy planes?”  “Yes, that’s it, and for possible enemy landings.”  “But none have come?”  “Not yet. But let us relax our vigil—then see what happens! If an aircraft carrier stole in close in the fog and sent over fifty bombing planes, hundreds—perhaps thousands would die. That must never happen.”  “No! Never!” Norma’s hand clenched hard.  “That’s the why of the Interceptor Control.”  “Do the WACs help with the watching?”  “In a way, yes. But not out on the sandbanks and rocky shores.”  “That’s done by volunteers?”  “Yes. The WAC works inside. There’s plenty to be done if an enemy plane is sighted. Just plenty.  “This,” she said, changing the subject, “is Boom Town. Six months ago it was open country.”  Norma looked up, then stared. So interested had she become in their talk that she had failed to note that they were now passing before a long row of new red brick buildings.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _“This,” She Said, Changing the Subject, “Is Boom Town.”_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  “The two-story ones are barracks,” her companion explained. “Some of the one-story buildings are Company Headquarters, some are mess halls, and some day rooms.”  “Day rooms?” Norma was puzzled.  “Day rooms that you mostly visit at night,” Lieutenant Warren laughed. “Lights in the barracks are out at nine-thirty. Most of the girls prefer to retire then. When you’ve been here three days you’ll know why.  “Some hardy souls wish to stay up another hour, so they retire to the day room to lounge in easy chairs, write letters, read, or play cards. Bed check is at ten-forty-five. You’d better be in bed by then or you’ll get a black mark.”  “Every night?” Norma asked in surprise.  “From Saturday noon to Sunday night is all your own. You’ll learn about that later.”  For a moment they walked on in silence. It was Norma who broke that silence.  “Can you tell me a little of what the WACs of the Interceptor Control do?”  “A little is right,” was the quick reply. “Much of it is a deep, deep secret. You’d love it all, I know.  “But listen. This is how it works,” she went on. “Some high school girl is watching from a cliff. There are many girl watchers, and how faithful they are!”  “This girl hears a plane in the dark. It’s off shore. She rushes to a phone and calls a number. A WAC at the switchboard replies.”  “And then?” Norma whispered.  “Then the girl on the cliff says: ‘One single. High. Off five miles. Going south.’  “The WAC knows from the spot on the switchboard where the girl is. She reports the call. Another girl locates the spot on a chart. A third WAC reports to three men. One of these men represents the Army, one the Navy, and one the Civil Aeronautics Authority. These men consult their records. Perhaps they discover that no plane belonging to any of their organizations is supposed to be on that spot.”  “And then they send out a fighting plane,” Norma suggested.  “Not yet. Perhaps that girl watcher heard a vacuum sweeper instead of a plane, so they wait.”  “And?”  “Then, perhaps two minutes later, there comes a flash from another watcher—this time a fisherman’s wife.  “Flash! One single. High. Going south. Very fast.”  “‘Three hundred miles an hour,’ someone says. Then a fighter plane goes up. And soon, if it’s really an attack, the sky will be filled with fighter planes.”  “Lives saved—many lives saved by the WACs,” Norma enthused.  “We shall have done our part,” Lieutenant Warren replied modestly. “And that is all our country expects from any of us.”  “Lieutenant,” Norma asked suddenly in a low tone, “did you notice anything unusual about the two girls who went into your booth just ahead of me?”  “Why no—let me see,”—the lieutenant paused to consider. “One was rather short and chunky—of Italian stock. And the other—”  “Tall, strong—and, well—rather silent.”  “Yes. Now I recall her. No—nothing very unusual. Quite different in character, but capable, I’d say. They’ll fit in. Of course, they’re both of foreign extraction The tall girl’s parents were German-born. She’s an American, as we all are. She was raised by her uncle. Something unusual, did you say? Why did you ask that?” She fixed her dark eyes on Norma’s puzzled face.  “Nothing, I guess. No real reason at all. I—I’m sorry I asked. I wouldn’t hurt anyone—not for all the world.”  “Of course you wouldn’t, my dear.” The Lieutenant pressed her arm.  Lieutenant Warren seemed fairly bursting in her enthusiasm for the Interceptor Control. She told Norma more, much more, as they marched along. Then suddenly, as if waking from a trance, she stopped dead in her tracks to exclaim softly:  “Oh! What have I been telling you? I shouldn’t have breathed a word of that! It’s so hard not to talk about a thing that’s got a grip on your very soul. Promise me you won’t breathe a word of it!”  “I promise,” Norma said quietly. “I’m sure I know how important it is.”  “Do you know?” some sprite might have whispered. Soon enough the girl was to learn.  “Come on in here,” the Lieutenant said a moment later. “I must pick up a suit I’ve had pressed.”  The air in the large room they entered was heavy with steam. “On this side,” said the Lieutenant, pushing a door open a crack, “is the beauty parlor. Some young reporters have made fun of it. As if it were a crime for a soldier to look well!  “Those girls working in there,” she said as she closed the door, “are civilians. They come over from the city every day. Sometimes they worry me.”  “Worry you?” Norma was puzzled.  “Yes. You see, they’re not checked.”  “Checked?” Norma stared.  “Their records, you know. After all, this is an Army camp and, as such, is just packed with secrets. We send out a thousand freshly trained WACs a week. One of these days we’ll be sending a trainload all at once. Where are they going? Are they being sent overseas? Will they be secretaries to commanding officers? What other important tasks will they perform? Our enemy would like to know all this and much more. And these hairdressers just come and go. Who are they? No one knows.”  “But have _we_ been checked?”  “Have you been checked?” the Lieutenant whispered. “Oh, my dear! The F.B.I. knows all about you. Your fingerprints are in Washington. Your life from the time you were born has been checked and double-checked.”  “So none of us could possibly turn out to be spies?” Norma breathed a sigh of relief.  “I wouldn’t quite say that,” her companion replied thoughtfully. “But it would be very difficult.”  “Oh!” Norma exclaimed, fussing at her hair. “Do you suppose I could possibly get my hair set?”  “I can’t see why not. This is a slack hour.”  “I’m going to try it!” the girl exclaimed. “Tomorrow I’ll be getting my uniform, won’t I?”  “Yes, you will.”  “Then"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48599"],["title","Norma Kent of the WACS (#3)"],["body"," cap must be fitted properly.”  “Try it, and good luck.” The Lieutenant held out a hand. “It’s been a pleasure to talk to you.”  “Oh!” Norma exclaimed. “I want to see you many, many times!”  “My visit here at this time is short. But in the future. Here’s hoping.”  “In the future. Here’s hoping,” Norma whispered to herself as she passed through the door.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER IV                            A LIGHT IN THE NIGHT   On entering the small, crowded beauty parlor Norma found only one vacant chair. She looked at the girl standing behind the chair. “Spanish,” Norma thought. And yet her eyes were set at a slant like those of an Oriental. For all this she was decidedly not an Oriental.  “Oh, well.” Norma thought, “she looks capable. It will soon be time for rattling those trays again. And do I need to get my fingers wrapped round one of those mugs of strong coffee! Boy! Has this been a day!”  “Hair set,” she said, as she settled back in her chair.  Without a word the girl went to work. She was half finished before she spoke. Then in the most casual manner she said:  “Lieutenant Warren is a friend of yours?”  Norma was surprised. The door had been opened only a little way, and for a space of seconds, yet this girl had seen. “Yes,” was her noncommittal reply.  “It is always quite fine to have an officer for a friend. She can help you, tell you things, and guide you,” suggested the hairdresser.  “Yes—I—I suppose so,” Norma murmured.  “She told you about the Interceptor Control?” The girl’s whisper invited confidence.  At once Norma was on her guard. “We talked about Boom Town,” she replied evenly. “It’s interesting. Built so quickly, and all that. Yet it looks warm and cozy.”  “Boom Town. Oh! Yes, it’s quite grand.” These words were spoken without enthusiasm.  After that they talked about trivial things—clothes, shampoos, and the weather. Twice the strange girl led back to the Interceptor Control. Twice Norma led her away again.  “Now why would she, a hairdresser, want to talk about Interceptor Control?” she asked herself.  As she left the chair she was not a little surprised to see the tall recruit, Lena, waiting to take her place. More surprising was the fact that as Lena’s eyes met the hairdresser’s, there appeared to pass between them an instant flash of recognition.  “And Lena hasn’t been on the grounds a whole day!” she thought with a start.  “Spies!” her mind registered as she left the building. Then she threw back her head and laughed. “Spies in the heart of America!” she whispered. “In a woman’s camp! I’m getting a spy complex—seeing ghosts under the bed! What’s the matter with me?”  That evening, not wishing to retire at the “lights out” signal, she sought out the day room that is used at night, and found it.  It was a comfortable place, that day room. Half underground, it was not subject to draft. A large round stove gave off a genial glow and plenty of heat. A large cushioned lounging chair awaited her.  Only one other girl was in the room. “Lena, the one who whispers in the night,” Norma thought. “Guess she’s asleep.”  Lena was not asleep, for as Norma sank into her chair, she opened one eye and drawled:  “Had a good day, didn’t you?”  “Just fine!” was the smiling reply.  “Hobnobbing with the brass hats.” Was there a suggestion of a sneer on Lena’s face?  If it was there Norma chose to ignore it. “There don’t seem to be any brass hats around this place,” she replied, good-naturedly.  “Oh! Aren’t there?” the girl exclaimed. “You just wait and—” At that the girl caught herself. “Well,” she finished lamely, “I’ll admit I’ve been treated fine.”  “Tomorrow we get measured for our uniforms,” she added.  “Your uniform should need very little fitting.” Norma could not help admiring the girl’s look of perfect fitness and form as she stood up.  “I didn’t get it sitting ’round,” Lena laughed. “I’m going out for some air and a look at the moon. You’re rather a perfect thirty-six yourself,” she said over her shoulder as she marched toward the door.  Norma wondered in a vague sort of way how Lena had got her training. She knew about her own. It hadn’t been easy.  After a time she began wondering about the moon. Seeing it shine over the stables, the barracks and mess halls would be a pleasant experience. She wasn’t dressed for the outdoors, so she stepped to the window and looked up. She did not see the moon. Instead, her eyes fell upon two shadowy figures. One was Lena. The other, too, was a girl.  “Just another raw recruit,” she thought.  But then the girl turned so the light of a distant lamp was on her face. She was the girl who had done Norma’s hair that afternoon.  “Should have been back in the city hours ago,” she told herself.  It all seemed very strange to her. Where had Lena known this girl before? Or had she? Why were they together now? Only time could tell, and perhaps time wouldn’t.  She was just thinking of retiring when Lena again entered the room. Seating herself before the fire she held out her hands to warm them. For some time neither girl spoke. At last leaning far over and speaking in a hoarse whisper Lena said:  “You know that little Italian girl?”  “Rosa?”  “Yes.”  “What about Rosa?”  “I think she’s a spy. I saw her flashing a light in the night. Her cot is by the window, you know,” came in Lena’s insinuating whisper.  “Oh! Do you really think so?” There was little encouragement in Norma’s tone. “Who’s a spy?” These words were on her lips. She did not say them. Nor, having said them, could she have given the answer.                    *       *       *       *       *  Two days later found them all in uniform. And did they look grand!  “Oh! Millie!” Norma exclaimed. “You look like a million dollars!”  “Do I? Then I’m glad.” Millie beamed. “I was afraid I’d still look like a salesgirl.”  “How does a salesgirl look?” Betty asked.  “Oh, sort of dumb.” At that they both laughed.  “It’s the grandest outfit I ever had!” Millie exclaimed. “Such a soft, warm woolen suit. And such tailoring! And my coat! Oh gee! I feel like Christmas morning!”  “The shoes weren’t marked down to two dollars and thirty-nine cents either!” said Betty. “I’ve had a lot of fine shoes, but none better than these.”  That afternoon a corporal formed them into a squad—Norma, Betty, Lena, Millie, Rosa and five other girls. Then they began to drill.  “One! Two! Left! Right! Left! Right,” the corporal called. “Squad right! Squad left! March! March! Doublequick! March!”  Some of the girls found it difficult to keep in step and maintain that thirty-inch stride. But not Norma. The whole manual of drill was an old story to her.  Soon they were joined by other squads. Then, eager that her squad might look its best, when the Lieutenant who had taken them over was not near, Norma began calling in a hoarse whisper the counts and changes. “Left! Right! Left! Right! Squad right! March! Double quick!” They drilled until many a girl was ready to cry “quits.”  When they broke ranks Lieutenant Drury singled out Norma’s squad.  “Say!” she exclaimed. “You girls are wonderful! Been practicing behind the stable or somewhere?”  “It’s her,” Millie nodded toward Norma. “She keeps us going.”  “That’s swell. How come?” The Lieutenant turned to Norma.  “I knew it all before I was five years old,” Norma laughed. “My father was an officer in the last war, and I am his only boy. He started drilling me when I was a mere tot. I liked it, so we kept it up. That’s all there is to it.”  “Well,” the Lieutenant laughed, “I guess there are many of us who are our fathers’ only sons. And by the grace of God we’ll make them mighty proud of us before this old war is done!”  That night in a corner of the day room Norma had a little time all by herself. Her father was home all alone now. The chair she had occupied by the fire for so long was empty now, and would be for a long time.  “But I wouldn’t go back,” she told herself, biting her lip. “Not for worlds!”  And he would not want her back. She recalled his parting words at the train. “Norma,”—his voice had been husky. “For a long time I wanted a son. Now I’m proud to have a daughter to give for the defense of my country. Get in there, girl, and fight! Perhaps you’ll not be carrying a gun, but you’ll be taking a fighting man’s place. And I’m sure you’ll help show those fine boys how a girl can live like a soldier and die like one, if need be.”  “I’ll be back,” she had whispered, “when the war is won.”  That night Lena may have whispered in her sleep. She may even have gone out to talk with her hairdresser. If so, Norma knew nothing of it. She was too weary for that. She retired early. She did, however, remain awake long enough to twice catch the gleam of light from Rosa’s cot. She liked the little Italian girl, but—  Once again she recalled one question asked her back there in Chicago. She had been given a final examination before her induction into the service. One of the women in that examining group, she had been told, was a psychologist. In the back of her mind all during the examination she had asked herself, “Which one is she?”  When a little lady with keen dark eyes had leaned forward to ask: “If you suspected that one of your companions was a spy, what would you do?”—a flash came to her. “She’s the psychologist.”  She had thought the question over, then replied slowly, “If I saw her setting a fire or stealing papers I’d report her at once.”  “But if not?” the little lady had insisted.  “If I merely suspected that she was a spy, I’d wait and watch, that’s all,” had been her whole reply.  In the eyes of her examiners she had read approval. That’s what she was doing now—watching and waiting.  “All the same,” she told herself now, “I’m going to ask Rosa why she flashes that light at night.”  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER V            "]]]
