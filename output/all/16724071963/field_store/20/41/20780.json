And here I am but a compiler of a very few of the principal results of researches that have been made in Egypt, in the valley of the Euphrates and in Palestine. I make no pretentions to original investigations of these researches, but accept the statements of what I consider to be reliable authorities in relation to them.  In the year 1799 a French officer named Boussard discovered a large, black basalt stone at Fort St. Julian near Rosetta, in the delta of the Nile. From the circumstances of the discovery being near Rosetta it has always been known as the Rosetta Stone. It was inscribed in Greek, in Egyptian hieroglyphics, and a third class of writing which is called Demotic. The last is the common writing of the people of Egypt as opposed to the hieroglyphic which was written by the priests. The Greek upon the stone was readily made out, and it was found to consist of a decree drawn up by the priests of Memphis in honor of Ptolemy Epiphanes, who ruled about 198 B. C. It was at once evident that the Greek inscription on this stone was the translation of the hieroglyphics upon it, and hence afforded a key to the interpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics. By the fortunes of war the Rosetta Stone was surrendered by the French to General Hutchinson and subsequently presented to the British Museum where it is now preserved. Accurate copies of the three-fold text were made forthwith and distributed among the scholars of Europe with the result that through the combined, patient labors of Silvestre de Sacy, Akebald the Swede, Thomas Young, Champollion, Lepsius in Germany, Birch in England, and others, the hieroglyphics were deciphered and a system of translation constructed which enabled European scholars to read many of the inscriptions upon the monuments of Egypt, and bring to light much of the history of that country which hitherto had been a mystery. This gave an impetus to research. The political representatives of the great countries of Europe made collections of antiquities in Egypt, and travelers spent much time and money in opening tombs and digging out ruins. The tombs have given up not only their dead, but with them the books which the Egyptians read, the furniture which they used in their houses, the ornaments and articles of the toilet of the Egyptian lady, the weapons of the warrior, the tools of the handicraftsman and laborer, the dice of the gambler, the toys of the children, and the portraits, statutes and figures of the men and women for whom they were made. The many-lined inscriptions upon the tombs give us their ideas about the future world, the judgment of the dead, the paradise of the happy souls, the transmigration of souls, and they enable us to place a juster estimate upon the statements of those Greek writers who profess to understand and to describe with accuracy the difficult religion of the educated Egyptians. And the result of all this, as affecting the authenticity of the Bible? Simply this: the manners, customs, governments, arts, sciences, occupations and state of civilization of the Egyptians in general, are demonstrated by these monuments to be substantially what they are described to be in the book of Genesis. Also there is supposed to be the confirmation of special events in the scripture narrative. Professor A. H. Sayce, for instance, has the following upon the existence of such a line of kings ruling at Jerusalem as Melchizedek is described to be in Genesis:      \"Among the cuneiform tablets found at Tel el-Amarna in Upper Egypt,     are letters to the Pharaoh from Ebed-tob, king of Jerusalem,     written a century before the time of Moses. In them he describes     himself as appointed to the throne, not by inheritance from his     father or mother (compare Heb. 7:3), but by the arm of 'the Mighty     King,' i. e. of the god of whose temple stood on Mount Moriah. He     must therefore have been a priest-king like Melchizedek. The name     of Jerusalem is written Ura-Salim, 'the city of the god of peace,'     and it was the capital of a territory which extended southward to     Kellah. In the inscriptions of Rameses II and Rameses III, Salem is     mentioned among the conquests of the Egyptian kings.\"  The same writer sees confirmation of the history of Joseph, son of Jacob, in the following circumstance:      The \"Story of the Two Brothers,\" an Egyptian romance written for     the son of the Pharaoh of the oppression, contains an episode very     similar to the Biblical account of Joseph's treatment by Potiphar's     wife. Potiphar and Potipherah are the Egyptian Pa-tu-pa-Ra, \"the     gift of the Sun-god.\" The name given to Joseph, Zaphnath-paaneah,     (Gen. 41:45), is probably the Egyptian Zaf-nti-pa-ankh, \"nourisher     of the living one,\" i. e. of the Pharaoh. There are many instances     in the inscriptions of foreigners in Egypt receiving Egyptian     names, and rising to the highest offices of state.  The story of the Exodus as related in the Bible is supposed to find confirmation in the following:      \"The cuneiform tablets found at Tel el-Amarna, in Upper Egypt, have     shown that in the latter days of the eighteenth Egyptian dynasty,     when the Pharaoh had become a convert to an Asiatic form of faith,     the highest offices of state were absorbed by foreigners, most of     whom were Canaanites. In the national reaction which followed, the     foreigners were expelled, exterminated, or reduced to serfdom;     while a new dynasty, the nineteenth, was founded by Rameses I. He,     therefore, must be the new king, the builder of Pa-Tum or Pithom     (now Tel el-Maskhuteh, near Ismailia), as has been proved by Dr.     Naville's researches, and consequently, as Egyptian students had     long maintained he must have been the Pharaoh of the oppression.\"  The occupancy of the land of Goshen by the Israelites who, it will be remembered, were shepherds, is supposed to receive confirmation in the following:      Further excavations of Dr. Neville have shown that Goshen, the     Egyptian Goshen (now Saft el-Henneh), is the modern Wadi Tumilat,     between Zagazig and Ismailia. A dispatch dated in the eighth year     of the reign of Meneptah, the son and successor of Rameses II,     state that Bedouin from Edom has been allowed to pass the Khetam or     \"fortress\" in the district of Succoth (Thukot), in order to feed     themselves and their herds on the possessions of Pharaoh. Khetam     is the Etham of Exodus 13:20. The geography of the Exodus agrees     remarkably with that of the Egyptian papyri of the time of Rameses     II and his son. [14]  The search for evidence of the truth of the Bible has not been confined to Egypt. Equal interest has been awakened in those ancient empires that occupied the valley of the Euphrates; in Palestine, and the Sinaitic Peninsula. European scholars with keen interest followed the study of the cuneiform characters found on Babylonian tablets and monuments. Progress made in deciphering this ancient method of writing led M. Botta, in 1842, to begin excavations upon the ancient site of Nineveh, but he met with little success. Later, however,--1845--Mr. Henry Layard (subsequently Sir Henry Layard) undertook excavations at the same place for the Trustees of the British Museum, and succeeded in uncovering the palaces of Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Assur-banipal, and in bringing to light the terra cotta tablets which formed the great library founded by these kings at Nineveh, and of which some twenty-two thousand are now preserved in the British Museum. An examination of these tablets soon showed that they consisted of historical inscriptions, astronomical reports and calculations, grammatical lists, etc., and scholars began to apply Sir Henry Rawlinson's system of decipherment of the Babylonian version of the Behistun inscription to the texts inscribed upon these tablets. A large portion of the history of Babylonia and Assyria through the translation of these tablets is now revealed to us, and the knowledge of the language of these countries has thrown much light upon the language, literature, history, and learning of the Jews. The excavations which have been carried on in Mesopotamia for the last fifty years have yielded the most valuable results; and the inscribed slabs, monolithic stelae, boundary stones, gate-sockets, bricks, seal-cylinders and tablets, now preserved in the British Museum, afford an abundant supply of material from which Bible customs and language may be freely explained and illustrated. The cuneiform writing is, at least, as old as B. C. 3,800, and there is evidence to show that it was in use as late as B. C. 80. [15]  In 1865 the Palestine Exploration fund was opened, and excavations were begun in Jerusalem, and have continued, with some interruptions, until now. Since then researches have followed in the south, east and north of Palestine. Geological investigations have been made, natural history collections have been formed, enquiries into nationalities and customs carried on, towns, villages, hills, valleys, water courses, wells, cisterns, notable trees and other land marks have been located. In 1868 a party of engineering experts left England to make a scientific survey of the Sinaitic Peninsula. This they effected, making plans and models, taking three thousand copies of inscriptions with collections of specimens bearing on the zoology, botany and geology of the country. [16]  The results of these explorations and discoveries, in the valley of the Euphrates, in Palestine and the Sinaitic Peninsula, have been even more fruitful, in the production of materials which tend to confirm the truth of the Bible narrative and general credibility, than the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47316"],["title","New Witnesses for God (Volume 2 of 3) (#5)"],["body"," so far made in Egypt. The confirmation of the Bible narrative of ancient events is remarkable. So, too, the confirmation of its location of cities, mountains, rivers, plains and, indeed, the whole geography of the scriptures. The confirmation given of the Bible's incidental allusions to the manners and customs of neighboring and contemporary nations is no less remarkable; together with what is said of reigning kings and dynasties, and the incidental allusions that the Bible makes to their invasions of each other's territories, their alliances, their victories, and their defeats. The following are a few of the special Bible incidents which receive confirmation from the results of these researches condensed from the article of Professor Sayce:      CREATION: One of the accounts of creation in cuneiform characters     found on the tablets very nearly resembles the first chapter of     Genesis. It commences with the statement that \"in the beginning\"     all was a chaos of waters, called the deep (Tiamat, the Hebrew     tehom). Then the Upper and Lower Firmaments were created, and the     Gods came into existence. After that comes a long account of the     struggle between Bel-Merodach and the \"Dragon\" of chaos, \"Timaat,\"     \"the serpent of evil,\" with her allies, the forces of anarchy     and darkness. It ended in the victory of the god of light, who     thereupon created the present world by the power of his \"word.\" The     fifth tablet or book of the poem describes the appointment of the     heavenly bodies for signs and seasons, and the sixth (or perhaps     the seventh) the creation of animals and reptiles. The latter part     of the poem, in which the creation of man was doubtless described,     has not yet been recovered. But we learn from other texts that man     was regarded as having been formed out of the \"dust\" of the ground.      THE SABBATH: From the tablets it is also learned that the     Babylonians observed a day of rest, which is called Sabbattu and     described as \"a day of rest for the heart.\" On it, it was forbidden     to eat cooked meat, to put on fresh clothes, to offer sacrifices,     to ride in a chariot, etc. The Sabbattu fell on the 7th, 14th,     19th, 21st, and 28th days of the month.      THE GARDEN OF EDEN: The \"plain\" of Babylonia was called Edin in     the ancient Sumerian language of the country, and the word was     adopted by the Semitic Babylonians, in the form of Edinu. Eridu,     the early seaport of Babylonia, was the chief center of primitive     Babylonian religion and culture, and in its neighborhood was a     garden, wherein, \"in a holy place,\" according to an ancient poem,     was a mysterious tree whose roots were planted in the \"deep,\"     while its branches reached to heaven. The tree of life is often     represented in Assyria sculptures between two winged cherubim who     have sometimes the heads of eagles, sometimes of men, and sometimes     stand, sometimes kneel. Eri-Aku or Arioch (Gen. 14:1) calls     himself \"the executor of the oracle of the holy tree of Eridu.\" In     Sumerian, wine was called ges-din, \"the draught of life.\" A second     tree is mentioned in Babylonian hymns on whose heart the name of     the god of wisdom is said to be inscribed.      THE FLOOD: In 1872 George Smith discovered the Babylonian account     of the deluge, which strikingly resembles that of Genesis. It is     contained in a long poem which was composed in the age of Abraham,     but the Chaldean tradition of the deluge, of which the account     in the poem is but one out of many, must go back to a very much     earlier date. Xisuthros, the Chaldean Noah was rescued along with     his family, servants, and goods, on account of his righteousness.     The god Ea warned him in a dream of the coming flood, and ordered     him to build a ship, into which he should take every kind of animal     so that \"the seed of life\" might be preserved.      UR OF THE CHALDEES: \"Ur\" is now identified as Mugheir. This was     the early home of Abraham and his forefathers spoken of in Genesis     (12:27-32). It was situated on the west side of the Euphrates. The     name means \"the city\" in Babylonia. It is proven now that there was     such a city, and that it is identical with Mugheir, the ruins of     which have been thoroughly explored. It was the seat of a dynasty     of kings who reigned before the age of Abraham, and was famous for     its temple of the moon-god, whose other famous temple was at Haran     in Mesopotamia.      ABRAHAM: Contract-tablets show that in the age of Abraham,     Canaanites--or \"Amorites,\" as the Babylonians called them--were     settled in Babylonia, and that a district outside the walls of     Sippara had been assigned to them. Several of the names are     distinctly Hebrew, and, in a tablet dated in the reign of the     grandfather of Amraphel (Gen. 14:1), one of the witnesses is called     \"the Amorite, the son of Abi-ramu,\" or Abram.      CAMPAIGN OF CHEDORLAOMER: The records on the tablets that this     event (described in Genesis 14) is in accordance with the national     movements of that age.      SHISHAK'S INVASION OF JUDAH: On the southern wall of the temple     of Karnak, Shishak (Shashang in Egypt) the founder of the     twenty-second Egyptian dynasty, has given a list of the places he     captured in Palestine. Most of them were in Judea, but there are     few (e. g. Megiddo and Taanach) which belonged to the northern     kingdom.      THE MOABITE STONE: The Moabite stone was discovered by Rev.     F. Klein, at Dhiban in the land of Moab, on August 19, 1868.     It measures three feet ten inches, by two feet, by one foot     two inches; and is inscribed with thirty-four lines of text.     The language of the inscription hardly differs from Hebrew in     vocabulary, grammar, or expression. The stone gives the Moabite     account of the war of Mesha, king of Moab, about 860 B. C., against     Omri, Ahab, and other kings of Israel, and confirms to quite an     extent the history of the same war as given in II Kings, chapter 3.     [17]  Very naturally those believers in the Bible who regard it as the very word of God, those believers who regard the Bible's historical statements as substantially true, allowing only for such errors as may have crept in through the carelessness of copyists, or perchance here and there an error through additions or omissions on the part of copyists or designing custodians--such believers rejoice at the confirmation the scriptures receive from the inscriptions upon monuments and tablets brought to light by the researches and scholarship of the nineteenth century. It is a pious sentiment, this rejoicing over the confirmation of the word of God; and one can only regret that the evidences supplied by these modern discoveries are not sufficiently voluminous or explicit to silence altogether the unbelief of modern times in the Bible. But they are not sufficient; for in spite of them unbelievers not only exist in Christian lands, but increase daily.  Footnotes  1. _The Bible as Literature_. A course of lectures by Dr. Lyman Abbot, in Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, 1896-7. What is here called the \"Literary Method,\" is identical with what is called \"Higher Criticism;\" the terms are used interchangeably. Higher Criticism may be said to stand in contradistinction to what is called Lower Criticism in this, that it concerns itself with writings as a whole, whereas Lower Criticism concerns itself with the integrity or character of particular passages or parts; and is sometimes called \"Textual Criticism.\" \"The term 'Literary' or 'Higher Criticism' designates that type of Biblical criticism which proposes to investigate the separate books of the Bible in their internal peculiarities, and to estimate them historically. It discusses the questions concerning their origin, the time and place, the occasion and object of their composition, and concerning their position and value in the entire body of revelation. . . . . The 'Higher Criticism' has been so often employed for the overthrow of long-cherished beliefs that the epithet 'destructive' has frequently been applied to it; and hence it has become an offense to some orthodox ears.\" (_The Mosaic Authorship of the Pentateuch_, Charles Elliott, D.
