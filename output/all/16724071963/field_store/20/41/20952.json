Norma saw her favorite Lieutenant. She asked Rosa a question and received a surprising reply, and Millie, the shopgirl who was in the Army now, led them all in an amusing adventure that might not have turned out so well.  In the afternoon they drilled as a squad, as a platoon, and as a company. It was a hard workout, but to Norma it was a thrilling adventure.  “All this is the real thing!” she exclaimed once.  “I’ll say it is!” Betty laughed. “These new shoes are burning up my feet!”  “It’s the real McCoy, all the same,” Norma insisted. “It’s what I’ve been training for all my life! My father thought it was just for fun, for after all, I was a girl.”  “How little he knew!” Betty replied soberly.  Marching and drilling were not hard for Norma. She had time to think of other things. She began studying the ancient fort, and the atmosphere that hung about it like a cloud.  She had begun to love the place, and at times found herself wishing that she might remain here for a long time.  “Four weeks seem terribly short,” she told Betty.  “It may be much longer,” Betty suggested. “You might join the motor transport school and learn to drive a truck in a convoy.”  “Yes, and I might not,” was her reply.  “Or attend the bakers’ and cooks’ school,” Betty suggested.  “Not that either.”  “Well then,” Betty exclaimed, “since you’re so awfully good at this drilling stuff, perhaps they’d let you attend the officers’ training school.”  “Hmm.” she murmured. “Now you’re talking! Maybe. I don’t know.”  On that particular day, as a bright winter sun shone down on the long parade ground, Norma thought only of the old fort and what it stood for.  It was quite ancient, but just how old, she could not tell. Always a lover of horses, she tried to picture the parade ground in those old days when a thousand, perhaps two thousand men, all mounted on glorious cavalry horses, came riding down that stretch of green.  “Dignified officers in the lead—band playing and horses prancing! What a picture!” she murmured.  On each side of the parade ground were rows of red brick buildings. On the right side had been the homes of officers. Now these were occupied by the officers of the school.  On the opposite side were barracks occupied by officer candidates in training.  “That’s where I’d be training,” she thought with a little thrill, “if I applied for entrance and was accepted.”  On bright, warm days, she had been told, the whole school, six thousand strong, assembled on the parade ground and marched down the field. “That,” she thought, “would be glorious!” She hoped that they would have fine weather before she went away.  It was after drill was over that a rather strange thing happened. There was, she had discovered, an air of grim, serious determination about this place that was almost depressing. You seldom heard a laugh. There was always the tramp-tramp of feet.  Even now, when her squad of ten had been put on their own, and they were headed for the Service Club for a bottle of coke or a cup of hot chocolate, they were still going tramp-tramp, in regular file.  “It’s a little bit too much!” she thought.  Just at that moment a shrill voice cried out sharply:  “Left! Right! One! Two! One! Two.” She recognized that voice. It was Millie, the shopgirl!  For a space of seconds they kept up the steady tramp, tramp, tramp. Then, with a burst of laughter, they all took up the chant: “One! Two!”  They kept this up to the very door of the Club. Then, all of a sudden, the chant ended with a low escape of breath. There in front of the Club stood a captain of the WACs.  As they filed past, the girls saluted, and the captain gravely returned their salute.  “Wasn’t that terrible!” Millie whispered, gripping Norma’s arm. “And I started it! Do—do you suppose they’ll put me in the guardhouse?”  “I don’t know,” Norma hesitated. “No—not the guardhouse. No WAC is ever put in there. I guess it wasn’t so bad. We were just letting off steam, that was all.” Truth was, she didn’t know the answer. Of one thing she was sure—she for one felt better for this little bit of gaiety.  The Service Club had a cheerful atmosphere about it. Straight ahead, as they entered, they saw at the back of a fairly large lounging room, a fire in a large open fireplace. From the right, where chairs stood about small tables, came the pleasant odor of hot coffee and chocolate.  As Norma turned to the right she caught the eye of Lieutenant Warren. She was seated alone at a table, sipping coffee. At once she motioned to Norma to come sit across from her. With some hesitation, Norma joined her.  “What will you have? It’s on me,” the Lieutenant smiled.  “That coffee smells just right,” was the reply.  “Doughnuts—a sweet roll, or cookies?”  “A—a sweet roll. But please let me get them!”  “No! No! Permit me!” Lieutenant Warren was away.  “That training you received at college was fine,” the Lieutenant said when they were seated. “Grand stuff. I only wish all colleges went in for it. And they will. Our quota now is a hundred and fifty thousand. It will be a half million before you know it.”  “But Lieutenant Warren!” Norma’s brow puckered. “We’re not to carry guns, are we?”  “No. That’s not contemplated.”  “Then why all this drilling?”  “We’re going in for hard things—driving trucks, carrying messages on motorcycles, repairing radios, cars, airplanes. We’re to take the places of soldiers so they can carry guns and fight. We’ve got to be hard—hard as nails.”  “I—I see.”  “That’s not all.” The Lieutenant’s eyes shone. “Learning to drill properly is learning to obey orders. That’s necessary. If I say to you, ‘Take this message down that road where the bullets are flying,’ you’ve jolly well got to do it.”  “I—I see,” Norma repeated.  “You don’t mind this drilling, do you?”  “I love it!” This time Norma’s eyes shone.  “I thought so. And you know a great deal about it—perhaps more than most of us.”  “Per—perhaps,” the girl agreed, hesitatingly.  “With your permission, I am going to suggest that you be given a company to drill.”  “Oh! Oh, please! No!” Norma held up a hand.  “Wait.” The tone was low. “You saw me examining recruits?”  “Yes.”  “I was the only officer doing that work.”  “I—I didn’t notice.”  “All the same it was true. Why do you think I did it?”  “Because you wished to serve,” Norma replied in a low voice. “But with me it would be a step up too soon.”  “We are in a war. A step up or down does not matter. All that matters is that we should be prepared for that step. You are well prepared. You won’t refuse?”  “I won’t refuse,” the girl answered solemnly.  “Lieutenant,” Norma said in a low tone a moment later, “when I had my interview they asked me what I’d do if I suspected someone of being a spy. Why did they ask me that?”  “The psychologist was taking your measure. That was a problem question. The answer would give her a slant on your general character.”  “Then they don’t expect to find a spy among the WACs?”  “It’s not impossible for a spy to join our ranks, but certainly not easy. You filled out a questionnaire that told every place you had lived and when, every school you attended, and when.”  “And if I had been working, I would have had to tell how long and when, why I quit, and all the rest. All the same,” Norma spoke slowly, guardedly,—“spies have gotten into every sort of place, so—”  “So you think we have a spy?” The Lieutenant’s voice was low. “Anything you’d like to tell me?”  “No. Not—not yet.”  “Okay. Let’s skip it. But just one thing. We all need to be careful about members of our organization who are children of the foreign-born. It’s easy to do them an injustice. Too easy. They form a large group in our population. Take that little Italian girl over there. She’s an attractive young lady.”  “That’s true,” Norma agreed.  “And that big girl—Lena. Her parents are foreign-born. What a truck driver she’d make!”  “Yes—Oh yes. Sure she would.”  The Lieutenant gave Norma a short, sharp look.  Nothing more was said. A moment later Millie stood by their table. There was a worried look on the shopgirl’s face.  “Wasn’t that terrible?” She did not smile.  “What’s so terrible?” The Lieutenant smiled.  “What we did a little while ago,” said Millie.  “Want to tell me about it?” the Lieutenant asked.  Millie dropped into a chair to tell the story of their hilarious march.  “Now,” she exclaimed at the end, “It was I who started it. What will they do to me?”  “Nothing,” was the instant response, quite as quickly rewarded by a golden smile.  “You were on your own,” the Lieutenant explained. “We want you to be happy. When an army loses its sense of humor it begins losing battles.”  “I—I’m so glad,” Millie exclaimed.  “But let me tell you.” The Lieutenant held up a warning hand. “There are other times and places. Take Inspection as an example. When you line up by your cots for inspection be sure there are no wrinkles in your blanket; that your locker is in order and open; that your shoes, towel, washcloth and laundry bag are in place. And above all, look straight ahead. Don’t smile. Don’t frown. Just look—and don’t move a muscle—not even if a fly gets inside your glasses or a bee stings you.”  “Jeepers!” Millie exclaimed. “This is some woman’s army!”  That evening, by some strange chance, Norma found herself in the day room with Rosa, alone.  “It’s my chance.” she told herself with a sharp intake of breath. “Now I’ll ask her.”  “Rosa,” she said quietly, “why do you flash a light by the window at night?”  “Oh!” Rosa exclaimed sharply. “Does it show?” Her face was flushed.  “Yes. Just a little.” Norma was trying to make it easy. “But why should you do it at all?”  “I don’t like to tell you.” Rosa backed away. “You’ll laugh at me.”  “Rosa, I’ll never laugh at you about anything.”  “Honest?” Rosa’s dark eyes searched her face.  “Honest. Never! Never!”  “All right, then. I’ll tell you. My mother didn’t want me to join up. She believes much in "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48599"],["title","Norma Kent of the WACS (#5)"],["body","prayer. She gave me a book of prayers and said: ‘Read one prayer every night.’ I have read one prayer every night. But it was dark, so I hid a small flashlight in my bed. Now you can laugh.” Rosa turned away.  “Rosa,”—Norma put an arm about her—“I think that’s wonderful! But Rosa, your mother did not say ‘Read a prayer in bed.’”  “No, she did not say that.”  “Rosa, we are forbidden a light in the barracks after nine-thirty, so why don’t you come down here to read your prayer?”  “Thank you! Thank you so very much. I shall do that.” Instantly Rosa was away after her book.  Long after Rosa had read her prayer and left the room, Norma sat staring at the fire. In that fire she read many questions. Would she be asked to drill a company? Should she ask for the privilege of entering officers’ training? Had Rosa told the truth? And Lena? What of Lena and the strange girl in the beauty parlor?  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                    CHAPTER VI                           A STARTLING ADVENTURE   At Fort Des Moines the WACs are on their own from Saturday noon until Sunday night. Needless to say, over at the mess hall, in the barracks, and on the field there was much talk among the new recruits about how these hours were to be spent.  “What do you do?” Norma asked a tall, slender girl from Massachusetts who had been in training for three weeks.  “Well,” the girl drawled, “the first week I went dashing off to Des Moines, rented a room at a nice hotel, ate oysters on the half-shell, Boston baked beans, brown bread and all the things I wanted, and had a grand time all by myself. But now,” she added, “I just get some books from the library, settle down in a big chair at the Service Club and loaf.”  “But isn’t Des Moines interesting?” Norma asked in surprise.  “Sure it is,” a bright-eyed girl from Texas exclaimed. “Beth is just lazy, that’s all. Des Moines is a nice big overgrown town, all full of nice, friendly people. It has the grandest eating spots! Yes, and halls where you can dance—really nice places.”  “And boys to dance with! Umm!” exclaimed a girl from Indiana. “There are soldiers and sailors who come in from their camps and all sorts of college boys.”  “A nice big, overgrown town, all full of nice friendly people.” Norma recalled these words later. Truth was, she found herself a little homesick. At that moment she would have loved a good romp with her dog Spark, and after that a quiet talk with her dad.  “I know what I’ll do!” she thought. “And I won’t tell a soul! They’d laugh at me.”  Betty, who more than any girl at camp had begun to seem Norma’s chum, had decided to stay in camp. When the day came, Norma too remained until four o’clock. Part of the time she spent having her hair washed and set. It was no accident that she took the chair of the Spanish hairdresser who served her before.  “I’ll bring up the subject of the Interceptor Control. If she asks questions I’ll tell her things I read in that little book called ‘The Battle of Britain.’ Anything that’s been published. Then perhaps I’ll string her a little.”  The hairdresser fell for the bait. Norma loaded her up with commonly known facts, then drew pictures from her fertile imagination. In the end she was hearing planes at unbelievable distances.  “But why are you so interested in all this?” she asked at last.  The girl shot her a swift look. “Oh! Miss Kent!” she exclaimed—there was a shrill note in her voice—“It is all so very interesting! Everything you WACs do is thrilling! It is a great organization!”  “Yes,” Norma agreed. “It is one of the big things that has come out of the war.”  To herself she was recalling Lieutenant Warren’s words:  “These girls worry me a little. Their records have not been checked.”  Then again she remembered how her own record had been checked to the last detail. “The examiners do not take your word for a thing,” she had been told. “The F.B.I. questionnaire you filled out is checked and double-checked by men who know. Even your fingerprints are sent to Washington.”  All this she knew was true. And yet the girls in the beauty parlor were not checked. “That tall girl, Lena, could tell this hairdresser anything—just anything at all. If she became the secretary to a colonel she could report anything to this hairdresser.”  “But Lena—” it came to her with the force of a blow—“Lena’s record has been checked. Her fingerprints were sent to Washington.”  “What a silly young fool you are!” she chided herself as a short time later she took the car to Des Moines. But she was not even sure of that.  Arrived at the heart of the city she looked up a long street to see a tall, inviting brick hotel standing on a hill.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Illustration: _And Yet the Girls in the Beauty Parlor Were Not Checked_]  ------------------------------------------------------------------------  After walking and climbing for fifteen minutes she found herself entering a long room filled with lounge chairs and lined on two walls by tall glass cases. The contents of these cases surprised her, for in them were more kinds of mounted fish than she had ever seen.  “Oh!” she exclaimed. “Am I in the wrong place? Is this a museum?”  “No, Miss.” the smiling bellboy who took her bag replied. “This hotel was once owned by a very rich man who collected fish. He’s dead now.”  “But his collection lives on.” She wondered vaguely what would live on when she was gone.  The first thing she did when she had been shown to a neat and comfortable room was strange. Opening her bag, she took out a cardboard folder tied with a ribbon. From this folder she selected a dozen pictures. These she proceeded to thumbtack, one by one, to the wall directly under a mellow light.  After that, without further unpacking, she dropped into a chair and sat for a long time looking at those pictures through moist eyelashes.  The house with the broad lawn and tall shade trees about it was her home. The tall, distinguished looking man with one empty sleeve was her dad. The picture done in color was her college chum. And the grinning young man in the uniform of a private was Bill—just plain Bill.  There were other pictures but these were the ones that counted most. They had adorned the walls of her room at college for a long time. When you bunk in a stable—even a glorious, glorified stable—with a hundred other girls, you don’t thumbtack your pictures to the wall. It isn’t allowed. Besides, it would be silly.  Norma wanted to see her pictures in their proper setting. Now she was seeing them.  “Norma, you’re a silly goose,” she told herself aloud. Then she wondered whether she had spoken the truth. Sometimes one drops into a new world too hastily. It does one good to take a look back.  It was Bill who had started her thinking of the WACs. She and Bill were grand good friends, that’s all. No diamond ring—no talk of wedding bells—just friends.  All the same, when Bill came to the school all togged up in a new uniform, she had felt a big tug at her heart strings.  “Oh! Bill!” she had cried. “You look like a million!”  “And I feel like a millionaire,” was Bill’s reply. “Army life is the berries, and regarding the Japs, all I’ve got to say is they’d better look out!”  “Getting pretty good with a Tommy gun, Bill?” she laughed.  “And how!” was his prompt reply.  They found a log down among the willows at the edge of the campus, and there Bill, in his big, boisterous way, told her all about the Army.  “Oh, Bill!” she exclaimed when he had finished. “You make it sound so wonderful! I wish they’d let girls join.”  “They do!” Bill stopped grinning. “Ever heard of the WACs?”  “Yes, I—” she paused. Yes, she had heard of them. That was about all.  “Bill, I’ll really look into this.”  “You’d better. They’re a grand outfit. And boy! Are they going places!”  “I’ll be seein’ you,” she said to Bill as their hands clasped in farewell.  “In the Army?”  “I shouldn’t wonder.”  “Hot diggity! That’s the stuff!” He gave her hand a big squeeze, and was gone.  “And now I’m here, Bill,” she said to the picture on the wall. “I’m in the Army now. But, oh, Bill! I do hope our companies will some time march in the same parade!”  After an hour with her pictures, Norma felt herself ready for one more week of drilling, police duty, study, and all that went on from dawn till dark at old Fort Des Moines.  After a hearty meal eaten in a big bright cafeteria where all the people seemed carefree and gay, she stepped out to see the lights of Des Moines at night.  Thrills she had experienced more than once came to her from exploring a strange city at night. Certainly exploring a city of friendly people, many of whom smiled at her in a kindly way as she marched along in her spick-and-span uniform, could not be dangerous.  For an hour she prowled the streets alone. Past dark public buildings that loomed at her from the night, down narrow dark streets where taxi drivers and workers sat or stood before narrow lunch counters, she wandered. And then back to the broad street where lights were bright and the throngs were gay.  A feeling of utter loneliness drove her once again into the shadows. And there she met with a startling adventure.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   CHAPTER VII                             A HAND IN THE DARK   She had rounded a corner and was walking slowly north, admiring the sight of the moon shining over the jagged line of rooftops, when suddenly two figures emerged from a narrow alley to turn in ahead of her.  “Been taking a short cut,” she thought.  The steady swinging stride of the taller of the two girls, as they marched on before her, suggested that she might be a WAC.  “But she’s wearing civilian clothes,” she told herself in surprise.  The two shadowy figures seemed vaguely familiar. Because of this she followed them. They had gone "]]]
