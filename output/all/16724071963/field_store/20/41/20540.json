Not more than seven copies can now be traced, and only two of these have come to the hammer for more than a hundred years.  One, though imperfect, realized 4,101 francs at the La Vallière sale held at Paris in 1784, and the other £590 at the Hopetoun House sale at London in February, 1889. Then Homer is also a most desirable companion if he happen to have been printed at Florence, in two volumes, folio, 1488. About £100 is his price under those circumstances. Speaking generally, however, unless the printer comes to the rescue of a Greek or Latin classic, it may fairly be said to have fallen on an unappreciative generation.  Scores upon scores of volumes, the very flowers of classic days, edited by Cunningham, Heyne, Person, and other first-rate scholars of the last century, are to be met with in this bulky catalogue at sums varying from £2 to £3 each.  In an old book of this class, a copy of Epictetus, edited by Heyne, and published at Dresden in 1756, was a slip of paper with a memorandum of the price at which it had been purchased in 1760. It was a bookseller’s bill for £1 12s., made out to one ’Mr. Richard Cosgrove,’ doubtless a good customer in his day. I have the book now, and it cost me fourpence, as much as it was worth.  At the Duke of Roxburghe’s sale a copy of this same edition brought £1 4s.  This, no doubt, is rather an extreme case, but it will serve to illustrate the general principle sought to be enunciated, namely, that eighteenth-century classics are, for the most part, but wastepaper, for the simple reason that only a comparatively small number of people can read them. The learning of the schools may be deep and thorough—to assert the contrary would be to offend many excellent scholars of our own day; but it is nevertheless extremely probable, to say the least, that there are more books of the kind than there is any demand for, and so they litter the stalls, braving the wind and rain, till they are rescued by the merest chance and given house-room for a brief space.  In the opinion of many collectors the word ’poetry’ only embraces English verse of a certain period, or written by certain people.  The Duke’s library was particularly rich in ancient English verse, lyric and dramatic, and some of the prices realized were very high.  Webbe’s ’A Discourse of English Poetrie,’ 4to., 1586, brought £64, and ’The Paradyse of Daintie Devises,’ 4to., 1580, £55.  A curious collection of some thousands of ancient ballads, in three large folio volumes, sold for £477 15s.  This collection, which was stated to be the finest in England, was originally formed for the celebrated library of the Earl of Oxford in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and was even then supposed to excel the Pepys collection at Cambridge.  It came from the Harleian Library, and was purchased and afterwards largely added to by the Duke, who managed to secure a ballad printed by Leprevik at Edinburgh in 1570, a ballad quoted in ’Hamlet,’ of which no other copy was known to exist, and many other extraordinary rarities. Dibdin was present when the ’poetry’ was competed for, and bought several hundred pounds’ worth of books, either on his own or somebody else’s account, the whole of which he could easily have stowed away in his capacious pockets.  Naturally enough, the works of Shakespeare would first be turned to by anyone who held this catalogue in his hand for the first time.  There are nearly three pages of closely printed entries referring to the great dramatist, and the only conclusion that can be arrived at is that in 1812 the early quartos must have been, if not exactly common, at any rate of no great rarity.  It would be impossible to argue that Shakespeare was not then appreciated, for the contrary is well known to have been the fact.  The late Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps in after-years talked of picking up early quartos for a few shillings each, and lamented that, for some mysterious reason which he found himself unable to explain, they had suddenly become scarce.  Very likely he himself had excited a keen desire to possess them in the breasts of those who read his numerous books, or—publish it not in Gath!—the bulk of them may have fallen into unappreciative hands, and been used to light the fires withal.  However this may be, the early Shakespearian quartos, now of great price, were disposed of at the Roxburghe sale for only a little more, and occasionally for less, than the first editions of Marlowe, Massinger, and several other of the chief Elizabethan dramatists.  A copy of the first folio sold, it is true, for £100, but the second only brought £15, the third £35, and the fourth £6 6s. This record, in the face of £84 for Boydell’s edition in nine volumes, folio, 1802—a work which may now be expected to sell for £5 or £6, even with some of the illustrations after Smirke and others in proof state—is most extraordinary.  But let us get to the quartos and compare the prices of then and now. The first-named are those realized at the Roxburghe sale; those in brackets are modern, and authenticated with dates and items complete. There is more scope for reflection here, and a whole volume might be written on the mutability of fashion.  ’Much a-doe about Nothing,’ first edition, 4to., London, 1600, £2 17s. (the Gaisford sale, April 23, 1890, £130); ’A Midsommer Night’s Dreame,’ first edition, 4to., 1600, £3 3s. (_ibid._, £116); ’The Merchant of Venice,’ by Roberts, first edition, 4to., 1600, £2 14s. (the Cosens sale, November 11, 1890, £270); ’Pericles, Prince of Tyre,’ 4to., 1619, 5s. (the Lakelands Library, March 12, 1891, £37); ’Pericles, Prince of Tyre,’ 4to., 1635, 14s. (_ibid._, £15); ’Romeo and Juliet,’ second, or first complete edition, 4to., 1599, £12 12s. (the Perkins sale, July 10, 1889, £164); ’King Lear,’ 4to., 1608, £6 12s. (the Brayton-Ives sale, New York, March 5, 1891, $425); ’Sir John Oldcastle,’ first edition, 4to., 1600, 19s. (the Gaisford sale, April 23, 1890, £46).  These modern prices are small in comparison with what might have been, for none of the copies above mentioned were in the finest condition.  If we want first-rate records we must go further back—to the Daniell sale, for instance, held in 1864, when thousands of pounds were paid as a matter of course for a selection of these little quarto volumes, which had successfully eluded the greasy fingers of generations of playgoers, the fires of disgusted Puritans, and the ignorance of our own people. Never shall we see nearly three thousand distinct lots of English poetry as previously defined disposed of at one single sale again, never again will prices rule so low.  Many of these books are not to be met with at all in our generation, no matter what price may be offered for them, seeing that, as an old book-hunting friend used to say, they have become ’scandalously uniquitous.’  In addition to early English texts, the great Duke had amassed a splendid collection of romances of the Quixotic school, known in polite circles as the _Table Ronde_.  He was not content, it seems, with the printed editions, but also collected many manuscripts on vellum, illustrated with beautiful illuminations.  Among these curious manuscripts were several which had been used and translated by the celebrated Walter de Mapes for the entertainment of his Sovereign, Henry II.  The printed books of this character, some of which occasionally, though very rarely, gladden the hearts of romantic bibliophiles, included the twenty-four small volumes recounting the exploits of Amadis of Gaul, published at Lyons and Paris in 1577, etc., and also several duplicates, £16 16s.  A fairly good set, without the duplicates, brought £4. 4s. in April, 1887—a dreadful drop, considering the demand there is for books of the kind.  Still, this particular work has undoubtedly fallen, for another copy produced only £6 the June following. Nor, should I imagine, would ’L’Histoire du Noble Chavelier Berinus,’ a quarto book printed at Paris, without date, sell for as much as £7 7s. at the present time, or ’Le Livre de Beufves de Hautonne,’ folio, Paris, 1502, for £13 13s., or ’L’Histoire Merveilleuse du Grand Chan de Tartarie,’ folio, 1524, for £22.  The twelve pages devoted to the enumeration of works of chivalry and romance glow with the martial achievements of Palmerin of England, Godeffroy de Boulion, Perceforest, Roy de la Grande Bretaigne, Perceval le Galleys, and scores of other champions who went about rescuing damsels in distress, sleeping in enchanted castles, and challenging the whole civilized race of men, one at a time, to mortal combat. Perceforest, by the way, in six folio volumes, Paris, 1528, went for £30, a fact worthy of note, inasmuch as another copy sold, a few months ago, for £10 l0s. Of all the knights of ancient days, the regal Perceforest was the least worthy of credence, which is saying a great deal.  His folios bristle with dragons, necromancers of the worst type, heroic rescues, combats with giants, devils, and all kinds of monsters who strove, and in vain, to destroy this past-master of Quixotic enterprise.  That such books did at one time exercise considerable influence over adventurous spirits is undoubted. They were the only novels of the day, the only bit of light reading to be had in the interval between one tourney and another.  Passing by a large and almost complete collection of the separately published works of Robin Greene, that unfortunate who bought a groat’s worth of wit with a million of repentance, we come to the Voyages and Travels, and note, as before, the differences in prices.  Hakluyt’s ’Collection of Voyages,’ 2 vols., folio, 1589-99, brought £4. 14s. 6d. (the Holding sale, January 17, 1895, £16; the Langham sale, June 19, 1894, £375, second edition, 3 vols., folio, which contained the map by Molyneux, of which only twelve copies are known.  This copy belonged to the first issue, without the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46237"],["title","The Romance of Book-Collecting (#4)"],["body","about Sir Francis Drake, which was subsequently added); ’Hakluytus Posthumus; or, Purchas his Pilgrimes,’ 5 vols., folio, 1625-26, £42 (the Toovey sale, February 26, 1894, £51); ’Sir Francis Drake Revived,’ 1652, and ’The World Encompassed by Sir Francis Drake,’ 1652, the two pieces 7s. (the Hawley sale, July 2, 1894, £6 5s.); ’Cooke’s Voyages,’ 8 vols., 4to., 1773-84, with the large plates bound in two folio volumes, £63 (December 5, 1893, at Christie’s, £3 12s., and on many other occasions for about the same amount); Eden’s ’History of Travayle in the West and East Indies,’ London, 1577, £6 10s. (the Thornhill sale, April 15, 1889, £10 5s.; the Wimpole Sale, June 29, 1888, £18 10s., original binding); Vancouver’s ’Voyage of Discovery to the North Pacific Ocean,’ 3 vols., 4to., and folio atlas of plates, 1798, £8 18s. (the Holding sale, January 17; l895, £5 5s.).  It would be more than tedious to pursue this comparative analysis further. Suffice it to say that as a rule the prices realized in 1812 for books of travel were greater than would be realized now under similar circumstances, especially when the journeys undertaken were about the foot-worn Continent of Europe or in the various English counties.  Pennant’s ’Journey from Chester to London,’ for example, is now a book of small account, yet the Duke of Roxburghe’s copy sold for £7 15s.  Works relating to America are, curiously enough, almost absent from the Duke’s catalogue, and it may fairly be taken for granted that at the beginning of the present century no one cared much about them.  This will explain the extreme scarcity of many of these books now, for what people think lightly of they take no care to preserve.  Hundreds and thousands of Americana must have been torn to fragments or otherwise destroyed in past days.  Often of small size, they would escape the notice of lovers of folios, nor is their general appearance sufficiently imposing to appeal to those who value a book strictly in proportion to its external beauty.  The Duke had only a few works of travel in any way relating to America, and as the list may be interesting, I have thought it best to transcribe it _verbatim et literatim_:  Schmidel ’Navigatio in Americam,’ 4to., _Norib._, 1599.  £1 6s.  Las Casas’s ’Discoveries, etc., of the Spaniards in America,’ _Lond._, 1699, 3s. 6d.  ’History of the Bucaniers of America,’ 4to., _Lond._, 1684, £2 6s.  Hennepin’s ’Discoveries in America,’ 8vo., _Lond._, 1698, 3s.  ’Voyage dans l’Amerique,’ par La Hontan, 2 vols., 8vo.  _La Haye_, 1703, and ’Dialogues avec un Sauvage de l’Amerique,’ par La Hontan, 8vo., _Amst._, 1704, the two volumes 7s. 6d.  Hontan’s ’Voyages to North America,’ 2 vols., 8vo., _Lond._, 1735, 6s. 6d.  Joutel’s ’Voyage to the Missisippi,’ 8vo., _Lond._, 1714, 4s.  Jones’ ’Present State of Virginia,’ 8vo., _Lond._ 1724, 2s.  Carver’s ’Travels in N. America,’ with plates, 8vo., _Lond._, 1778, 10s.  Long’s ’Voyages and Travels in N. America,’ 4to., _Lond._, 1791, 11s. 6d.  ’Histoire des Antilles,’ par Père du Tertre, 3 vols., 4to., _Paris,_ 1667, £2 2s.  Blome’s ’Description of Jamaica,’ etc., 8vo., _Lond._, 1678, 8s.  Gage’s ’Travels in America and the W. Indies,’ 8vo., _Lond._, 1699, 2s. 6d.  Wafer’s ’Description of the Isthmus of America,’ 8vo., _Lond._, 1699, 9s.  ’Collectio Peregrinationum in Indiam Orientalem et in Indiam Occidentalem, 19 partibus comprehensa, cum multis figuris Fratrum De Bry, 4 vols., folio, _Francof._, £51 9s.  This ’Collectio Peregrinationum,’ or Grands Voyages of Theodore de Bry, nearly always makes its appearance in the auction-room in sections. Nine of the parts, including the Additamentum, all first editions, with the plates and maps, sold on July 1, 1895, for £18 10s.  And now we must take a final leave of the Duke of Roxburghe and the collection which he got together during the course of a long life of painstaking and critical research.  His catalogue is worth comparing with several important records of the present day, but to do this thoroughly would involve a tabulated analysis quite out of keeping with a work such as I am engaged upon. There is magic in comparisons, for they tell us what to avoid, and it may be that by their aid we could in a measure take fashion by the forelock and jump the years to come.  Such a consummation is possible, but life is rounded too narrowly by the present, and therefore too short to make it worth anyone’s while to endeavour to peep into futurity.                                  *CHAPTER III.*                            *SOME LUCKY FINDS.*   The book-hunter whose heart is in his quest never tires of tales of lucky discoveries, and of rare books bought for a song. This is natural enough, and, moreover, authentic details of some great find invariably stimulate his eagerness, and encourage him to persevere in the search for what he is repeatedly being told—as though he of all men did not know it already—is only to be met with casually, and by the merest of accidents.  Now that all of us have settled among ourselves what books are rare, and desirable to possess on that account, as well as for many other reasons, everyone is, of course, naturally anxious to obtain the credit and still more the solid advantages of a startling discovery.  It is each man for himself, and that perhaps is the reason why book-men of the old school invariably dressed in staid and sober black, like Sisters of Charity, to show the world at large that charity in matters that relate to their pursuit is dead.  What man among the whole fraternity would give away his suspicions that, in such and such a place, something may lie hidden?  Rather would he make his way to the spot, in fear lest some other explorer might not, after all, have forestalled him, and during his journey there look to the right and the left of him, and get lost in crowds, as part of a deep design to shake off any other bookworm who, knowing his hunting instincts and great experience, might perchance be shadowing his footsteps.  It has, indeed, been seriously questioned more than once by learned divines whether any collector, and more especially a collector of books, can by any possibility reach the kingdom of heaven, seeing that the inestimable gift of charity is by him regarded of such little account that he would do anything rather than practise it. It were best, however, to leave such polemical discussions to those who take an interest in them, and content ourselves with saying that the bookman’s ways are necessarily tortuous, and his route through life circuitous.  It is next to impossible to open any book about books without meeting with instances of lucky finds, and the most curious part of the matter is that the stories are invariably more or less the same.  Like the literary man’s collection of stock phrases, which he uses with or without variation as occasion may require, and at judicious intervals, so these records of the chase strike us as being peculiarly liable to recur.  From their opening sentences we know them—nay, the very mention of a place or a name is often sufficient to make an adept take up his parable and finish the narration.  Let a man but whisper Hungerford Market, and we know that he is going to tell us of the fishmonger’s shop where about half a century ago ’autograph signatures of Godolphin, Sunderland, Ashley, Lauderdale, Ministers of James II.; Accounts of the Exchequer Office, signed by Henry VII. and Henry VIII.; Wardrobe Accounts of Queen Anne; Secret Service Accounts, marked with the \"E.G.\" of Nell Gwynne; a treatise on the Eucharist, in the boyish hand of Edward VI.; and a disquisition on the Order of the Garter in the scholarly writing of Elizabeth,’ were rescued from the eaters of fried plaice, and the tender mercies of the barbaric tradesman who supplied them.  Mr. Rogers Rees, of ’Diversions of a Bookworm’ fame, got this story from somewhere, though he perhaps would not know it now, for it has been altered and added to in a score or more of competing publications.  Then there are stories of Resbecque, who had a nose for a book second to that of no hound for a fox, of Naude, Colbert, the great Pixerecourt, and many more.  It would be a shame to dish up these plats again, for to make them palatable they would have to be seasoned with imaginative details—an objectionable, not to say fraudulent, practice at its best.  There is one story, however, which must be raked up, and then decently buried again, for it is to be hoped that we shall hear no more of it. It is perhaps not so well known as many of the rest, but in any case would not be mentioned here except as an almost unique illustration of the vicissitudes to which any book, however scarce and valuable it may be, is occasionally liable.  It is, stripped of its glosses, to the following effect: When the library at Thorneck Hall was weeded of its superfluous books, the butler, who superintended the operation, came across a perfect copy of Dame Juliana Berners’ ’Boke of St. Albans,’ printed by an unknown typographer in 1486. One would have thought that the quaintness of the type, to say nothing of the extraordinary character of the coloured coats of arms and other illustrations, would at least have prompted inquiry; but no! it was thrown lightly aside, and in due course disposed of to a pedlar for ninepence.  He in his turn sold it to a chemist at Gainsborough for four times the amount, and the chemist got £2 for his bargain from a bookseller, who, notwithstanding the fact that a very imperfect copy had been disposed of at the Duke of Roxburghe’s sale many years before, positively sold it to another bookseller for £7.  He, at any rate, was somewhat better informed, though not much, for once more the volume changed hands, this time to Sir Thomas Grenville, for £80.  These transactions did not take place in the Middle Ages, but in the forties of the present century, and the wonder is that anyone with the slightest knowledge of books could"]]]
