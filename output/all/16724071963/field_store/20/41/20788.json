I have never heard that waltz since--whether ground on the most deplorable of barrel organs, or blown in uncertain blasts from the watery instruments of a temperance band--without seeing, as in a magic mirror, the whole scene conjured up before my eyes: the intense enjoyment of my partner, which beamed so eloquently from her soft grey eyes, and spoke volumes of the nature it expressed: the childlike simplicity with which, when at length wearied, she stopped and said, turning to me--\"You dance very well! How I have enjoyed that waltz!\"  Many a stray sixpence those reminiscences have cost me! \"But,\" she continued, \"it must be late, and I cannot keep my friends any longer, let us find them as soon as possible.\" This was soon done, and, to my infinite chagrin, my partner declared herself quite ready to depart, pronouncing a glowing eulogium on my dancing. \"You must have taken lessons since I had the pleasure of meeting you, for formerly--\" There she stopped, for the philanthropic little cavalier she had called _caro maestro_ interrupted her, wrapped a shawl round her, begging she would hold it to her mouth and keep that feature closed during her passage to the carriage, and led the way with his, I supposed, wife, leaving me still in possession of the little hand which had rested on my shoulder during the waltz. Now, or never, I thought.  \"I fear I have induced you to prolong that waltz beyond your strength,\" for I felt her arm still trembling with the exertion, \"you must allow me to assure myself to-morrow that you have felt no ill effects?\"  \"We are not staying here,\" she said with some hesitation; \"we only came in for the festival and leave to-morrow.\"  Here we reached the passage, and _il caro maestro_ proceeding to discover their carriage, I felt myself, of course, bound to divide my attentions with the lady of the cap, and, not choosing to prosecute my enquiries within range of her ears, I remained some time in a state of internal frying till he returned, and I was again _tête-à-tête_ for a moment with their charge.  \"But do you not reside in the neighbourhood?\" We were close at the door. Smiling with her eyes, she shook her head, pointed to the shawl which she held to her mouth in obedience to the injunction she had received, and remained silent; I was distracted. \"Forgive me,\" I exclaimed, \"and pray speak; I must see you again.\"  \"Come, my dear,\" cried my tormentor, \"you'll catch cold, make haste!\"  Her foot was on the step;--she was in, her guardian opposite her;--the glass drawn up. \"Move on,\" said the policeman. One glance, as she bowed full of arch drollery, and I was left on the door step repeating, over and over, \"No. 756--756,\" while my brain was in a whirl of excitement, my beautiful vision gone, and my only clue to discover her the number of a cab!     CHAPTER II.  THE SEARCH.   With a confused sensation of annoyance and ill temper, I opened my eyes at the _reveillé_ next morning, and for some moments experienced that most painful puzzle of which few in this troublesome world of ours are quite ignorant, and which is one of the accompaniments of a great grief, videlicet, a perfect certainty that you are in the middle of something disagreeable, but what you are not sufficiently wide awake to discover. The process of shaving, at all times a reflective one, soon cleared up to me the mystery, and placed in full array the pros. and cons. of my chance of ever meeting my beautiful \"incognita\" again. Even my decidedly sanguine disposition was compelled to acknowledge that the \"pros.\" were few indeed. Still, as I am not without a certain degree of resolution, especially when the matter to be decided on touches my fancy or my affections, I determined pretty firmly not to relinquish the effort to discover and renew my acquaintance with the belle of last night.  I had hardly commenced an attack upon my eggs and broiled ham, when Burton walked in, brimful of curiosity, as I had anticipated, and to avoid the bore of being questioned, I at once opened my budget, and told him the whole history down to my present resolution; the more readily as he was a sufficiently high-minded gentleman-like fellow to talk to about a woman you respected; no blab, and a great chum of mine into the bargain.  I regret to say he laughed most unsympathisingly at my dilemma, and acknowledged that he had spent the greater part of the evening watching my proceedings, and speculating as to alternate expressions of triumph and defeat which swept across my countenance.  \"I never heard of a more curious _rencontre_, the fair unknown must have had a very slight acquaintance with your prototype; and then your unequalled luck sending you to the right quarter for discovering the scene of the original acquaintance, and being sufficiently _au fait_ at its habits and inhabitants, she could never have dreamt of having mistaken you. But how do you think of setting about her recovery?\"  \"Ah! there's the rub. An advertisement in the _Carrington Chronicle_--'If the young lady with the antique fan, &c., who danced the Elfin Waltz with an officer of H.M.'s -- Light Dragoons, at the ball last night, will send her address to the Cavalry Barracks, she will hear of something to her advantage,' would hardly do, eh? Besides, the admiration, however respectful, of a younger son, a landless Captain would not, I fear, come under the denomination of an advantage.\"  \"And suppose you discover her, perhaps enshrined in some lordly old manor house, surrounded with all the prestige of position, what will you say for yourself as an excuse, for your bold attempt to see her again?\"  \"If I met her in one of her native mud cabins the difficulty, if it existed at all, would exist all the same for me; I feel that she is in herself equal to a ring fence of nobility. But,\" I continued, walking up and down the room with folded arms, the approved method of showing that stern determination, \"_that_ I can easily manage; I suffered too much, and felt my natural powers whatever they are, under too great a cloud from my false position last night, ever to submit myself to the same again. No, I shall boldly say that I had called to relieve my conscience by apologising for the audacity with which I had encouraged her mistake last night, but that I really had not sufficient strength of mind to deny myself the pleasure of dancing and conversing with her, and that in reward of my present endeavour to do right, I hoped she would not deny me the honour of her acquaintance; surely, the very effort to see her will be in my favour.\"  \"Granted; _et puis_,\" said Burton coolly.  \"For God's sake, my dear fellow, don't ask me to begin thinking of consequences _now_, for the first time in my life!\"  \"It strikes me, Egerton, that you are decidedly done for!\"  \"Not exactly. Yet I confess I would attempt and brave a good deal to hear the low tones of my nameless belle's rather remarkable voice once more. There was so much feeling in them. I am sure she sings. I fear the wish to see her is scarcely reciprocated, for I had at times a dread sensation from the bright laugh in her eye that somehow or other she was selling me. Probably she confounded me with some fool she had known formerly; flattering association! Yet, I am not without what are generally considered elements of success in the eyes of the fair sex! _Imprimis_, one dark brown curly _pow_, as our friends in the north say, two eyes ditto in tint, six feet high, and an air _distingué_. Eh! Burton, what do you say?\"  \"That you're an insufferable coxcomb, but the inventory is tolerably correct.\"  \"Don't imagine that I consider the items of much value. None but inexperienced boys think that mere good looks are a passport to the heart of any woman that's worth having. We love beauty exclusively; but there is not a woman with an ounce of truth in herself that will not be instinctively attracted to a manly straightforward fellow, be he ever so plain; and, if he show her devotion, give him her whole heart as readily as if he was Apollo and Adonis all in one!\"  \"Hum,\" said Burton, \"perhaps so; but to business. How do you intend to proceed?\"  \"First, to discover cab 756, and, from its interesting charioteer, learn at what hotel the objects of my search put up; there they will know their names.\"  \"Suppose they were at a private house with friends.\"  \"Pshaw! Suppose they had lodgings in the moon! Did I not tell you the young lady expressly said they were perfect strangers?\"  \"That might be _façon_.\"  \"Burton! Another objection and you may look out for squalls! It is my only plan, so be silent.\"  \"When do you set out upon the search?\"  \"This morning, while the memory of Jehu may be fresh; the moment parade is over.\"  \"Shall we hunt in couples?\"  \"No, my dear fellow; in such a pursuit you would founder at the first fence.\"  \"I confess my heart and soul are not in the business, so I might be an obstacle; besides--but there's the trumpet; adieu! May success attend you, and the spirit of a thousand detectives inspire you.\"  Parade over, I hastened to doff my uniform, and with a delightful sensation of excitement, which I never imagined I could experience in the depressed atmosphere of Carrington, I sallied forth on my quest, with a spirit of perseverance, which, if there be any truth in ancient proverbs, augured well for the accomplishment of my object. As usual in that horrid locality, the weather was \"dimmed dimp and disagreeable,\" as Mantilini says, and not more than three or four cabs on the first stands I passed; none of these sported the magic figures; while the innumerable ones which were in motion, seemed by some perverse and unaccustomed freak to drive with such unprecedented rapidity, that though keen of sight, I could not distinguish their numbers. After perambulating the town in all its intricacies, visiting every cab stand extant, within its compass, standing numerous charges from the vehicles themselves, and a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47338"],["title","Kate Vernon: A Tale. Vol. 1 (of 3) (#3)"],["body","amount of slang, with the steadiness of the 42nd at Waterloo, I found myself towards five o'clock much in the same position as at starting. What! if my beautiful unknown should really have vanished from my sight for ever; and No. 756, a modernised edition of Cinderella's magic coach, be disenchanted into its original form of a vegetable marrow, the nearest approach, I believe, we have to a pumpkin! And Burton too!--he must be put down! Here a very dissipated looking cab crawled slowly by, drawn by a groggy horse, his bones showing in sharp angles through the oil cloth thrown over his back with a mockery of care, and driven by a small man with a face like a crumpled crab apple, and a hat in a galloping consumption. 755, \"Come,\" I thought, \"that's within one of my number; 755 ought to know something about 756.\" I elevated my cane. \"Here you are, sir,\" the door was opened. \"Stop,\" said I, \"you look intelligent,\" for an immense amount of knowingness twinkled or rather floated in his watery red eyes, \"and will perhaps assist me in a search I am making. Can you tell me where I shall find cab number 756? I have been looking on the cab stands all day, and about the streets and cannot see it any where; every other number almost have I seen, but 756 is invisible.\"  \"756,\" said Jehu reflectively, and gazing sharply at me, \"knows no such number, no such cab; cos why, sir, 756 was done for four months ago, and has he was unfort'nate, no one liked to take the cab--so its hoff the stans!\"  Good Heavens! then was it a phantom conveyance? In deep disappointment I stepped in, saying \"to the cavalry barracks.\" Instead of clapping the door with the usual jerk, the crumpled driver stood there, his face going through a perfect series of expressive wrinklings; at last, with an effort and a knock of his forefinger against the brim of his decaying hat, \"P'raps you're a hofficer, a sojer officer, sir?\"  \"Yes,\" said I, rather surprised, \"my regiment is quartered here.\"  \"Ho! very good, sir! I thought as you were a detective hofficer, sir; no offence, sir?\"  \"Certainly not,\" said I, highly flattered at the mistake, \"but why?\"  \"Cos, sir, you wanted so hard to get 756? I thinks he 'as summat against him, only you asked questions too straight forrard like; I know nothink about 756, we don't know much of each other, 'less we're on the same stan'; only of course, if you was a detective, I wouldn't peach.\"  \"I assure you,\" said I, \"I only wanted some information from 756, for which I would have rewarded him, and if you will help me--\"  \"I know, sir! Why you see if you've been a looking for him all day and asked on all the stans--\"  \"I did,\" said I.  \"And could hear nothink, he'll not be on the drive, a good many numbers b'long to the 'otels, sir.\"  A glorious idea by Jove! of course they were at an Hotel! \"You shall drive me round to them all,\" said I, \"till we find him.\"  \"And if that won't do,\" said my inimitable mentor, \"You can summons him, the police will soon get him.\"  He slammed the door with a triumphant wink that beggars description, and off we went at a wonderful pace.  Many were the hostelries we visited, but in vain, Red, Blue, and White Lions, Hen and Chickens, Boars, Bears, Bulls, and even Nag's Heads; the entire animal creation, ignored the existence of \"756.\"  \"Least ways, sir,\" said my invaluable assistant, between whom and myself, a great degree of confidence had sprung up, as he prepared for the fiftieth time to mount the box. \"Least ways, sir, we've done our best; you've been to all the 'otels as is good enough to keep cabs 'cept two, the 'Cat and Garters,' that's a poor 'un, and the 'Hangel' that's nearly as good as the 'Adelphi.'\"  \"To the Angel first then.\"  Arrived there, I went into the bar, and in the politest manner, asked its presiding goddess, if \"756\" was enrolled amongst the cabs of the establishment. \"Can't say, sir; here, 'Enry,\"--the waiter came forward--\"756--sir! yes sir!\" said the man unmovedly, little imagining the delight with which I heard his reply. I looked at my watch, seven o'clock, \"let me have dinner in a private room,\" said I, and after fully satisfying my most admirable Jehu, I returned to the charge within.  \"This way, sir,\" said the waiter, with a waive of the hand--I followed.  \"Light a fire, it is very damp.\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  In a few moments, a rosy cheeked chambermaid came in with a coal box and et ceteras, for a fire. This was what I wanted,--I drew a chair near, and after some observations on the weather, passed on to the probable numbers putting up at the house for last night's ball. \"Lots of pretty girls from the country,\" I concluded.  \"Yes, sir, we are still very full, though a good many left this morning.\"  \"Indeed! I danced with a young lady last night, who was staying here, but I cannot remember her name, I want very much to find it out,--do you think if I were to describe her to you, you could tell me?\"  \"P'raps I might, sir; though often we don't know the names of the people who stop here occasionally.\"  \"Well, this young lady was tall, and very fair, with brown hair, and a very pleasant smile.\"  \"I scarcely think I know any particular young lady like that, sir; there's Miss Jones, and Miss Mary Peters, and Miss Majoribanks, Squire Majoribanks' daughter, all just like that, sir.\"  Confound it, my description would have suited three-fifths of the young ladies of great Britain.  \"Yes, yes, but the lady I mean was with an old fattish man, black eyes, and thick voice, and a little elderly woman, who--\"  \"Oh, I think I know, sir: she had a little brown mole on her cheek, near the chin. A beautiful young lady!\"  \"Exactly,\" I exclaimed in delight.  \"They were only here two nights, and I don't know the name at all; they were quite strangers.\"  How intensely annoying! \"But is there no one in the house has an idea?\"  \"Well, I can't say, sir; you see we have been so busy; if it is any one it will be Bill, one of the cabmen, sir, he took them somewhere this morning; and I think they come from A----, but I'm not sure.\"  Here she began to gather her sticks and coals, and the waiter entered to lay the cloth.  \"Is Bill in?\" said I--\"If so, send him up without fail immediately after dinner.\" \"He is out just now, sir.\" \"Well, the moment he comes in, whether I have finished dinner or not.\"  \"Yes, sir,\" said both in chorus, and excited.  I had dined, and was languidly examining the interior of a tart, when the waiter entered again, announcing that \"Bill was there, if I wanted him.\" \"Show him in, by all means:\" and Bill made his appearance, hat in hand, and stroking down his hair.  \"Oh, good evening: your name is Bill, I understand, and I fancy you can tell me something I want to find out:--You drove a party from this hotel somewhere this morning, and I want to know their names: there was a little old lady, and a tall young one, with a short fat man, twinkling black eyes, eh! do you remember them?\"  \"Yes, I think I does,\" said Bill, slowly, as if confused by my rapid description, \"fat short gen'lman, spoke thickish, I remember; called my horse a rough sketch--not filled up.\"  \"Precisely; that's him, I am sure: what was the name?\"  \"Can't say, sir; I tuck 'em to the railway station: they was a-goin' to A----.\"  \"How do you know?\" \"Why, as I was a-putting of the luggage into a truck at the station, a porter turns one of 'em up, and says--this is for A----, not Manchester: and puts it all into another truck; and then I just see a name beginning with a W, and that was all, as I'd to come back direct, for there's been a sight of work this week.\"  \"Then none of you can tell me the name of that gentleman?\"  \"No, sir, they was quite strangers.\"  \"Sorry to have troubled you; there--.\"  \"No trouble sir, thank you sir.\"  Well, thought I, this is small success; still, it is better than nothing, and is a beginning. I'll keep up my courage, and take an early train to A---- to-morrow; I have often heard it is worth seeing, so first for my bill, and then for Burton.  The first was soon settled, and a short drive placed me in the barracks, where, not a little wearied with the day's tramp, I speedily luxuriated in dressing-gown and slippers, and detailed to Burton the wonderful perseverance and sagacity with which I had hunted up the track. \"At all events, old fellow, I've got the _locale_; the opening is decidedly propitious, and to-morrow I start for A----; you shall hear the result on my return; for, as I am on duty, I must, I suppose, be back the same night. I can't ask you to take it again after to-day, but Sedley, or some one will.\" \"Well,\" said Burton, \"you deserve success, but what will you do when you get to A----? Go to every house and describe your incognita?--or ask for a list of the inhabitants, and hunt up every name that begins with W? Certainly the Commander-in-Chief has a great deal to answer for in exposing H.M.'s officers to the dangers of such a quarter, where the dearth of all natural occupations and amusements drives them to Fouché-ism. I would offer to go with you, but that I promised Sedley to go over to ----, just to have a look at M's mare, for after all he has entered Diana for the Cup, and I rather have a fancy to back her.  \"Oh never mind! you know, old boy, in a hunt of this kind, I think that safety or success does not consist in numbers; I'll take my sketch book, though I've almost forgotten how to hold a pencil since we came to this infer--, but I hear a row on the stairs; oblige me, my dear Burton, by not mentioning my search nor its object to any of our fellows, if you've not done so already; they are accustomed to my occasional artistic fits, when I cut you all, and\"--  \"I'm dumb,\" said Burton, \"only don't have one in reality, for you grow too philosophic to be companionable.\"  As he spoke the door opened, and half a dozen noisy subs burst in to carry us off to Sedley's room, where devilled kidneys and Roman punch finished the evening.
