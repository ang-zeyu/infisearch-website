Kimball's Journal (#8)"],["body"," I never witnessed in my life before, and the scenes which I daily beheld while in that country almost chilled the blood in my veins. The streets were crowded with men, women and children, who solicited alms from the passengers as they walked along. Numbers of those poor wretches were without shoes or stockings, and had scarcely any covering to screen them from the inclemency of the weather.  Oh! when will distress and poverty and pain cease, and peace and plenty abound? When the Lord Jesus shall descend in the clouds of heaven--when the rod of the oppressor shall be broken. \"Hasten the time, O Lord!\" was frequently the language of my heart, when I contemplated the scenes of wretchedness and woe, which I daily witnessed, and my prayer to my Heavenly Father was, that if I had to witness a succession of such scenes of wretchedness and woe, that He would harden my heart, for those things were too much for me to bear. This is no exaggerated account; I have used no coloring here. They are facts which will meet the Elders of Israel when they shall go forth into that land, and then I can assure them they will not be surprised at my feelings.  But to return. During this time not only were great numbers initiated into the kingdom of heaven, but those who were sick were healed, and those who were diseased flocked to us daily; and truly their faith was great, such as I hardly ever witnessed before, consequently many were healed of their infirmities and sickness. We were continually employed, and scarcely gave sleep to our eyes, and some nights we would hardly close them. The task was almost more than we could endure, but realizing the circumstances of this people, their love of the truth, their humility and unfeigned charity, we were constrained to use all diligence and make good use of every moment of time, for truly our bowels yearned over them.  Notwithstanding our unwearied and unceasing labors, we could not fill the calls we had from day to day, for the work kept spreading, the prospect for usefulness grew brighter and brighter, and the field opened larger and larger.  The reader will not, I think, accuse me of egotism, when I say that we were diligent; for I do not remember of retiring to my bed earlier than twelve o'clock p. m. during the last six months I spent in that country, which was also the case with Brothers Hyde and Fielding. Brother Hyde was laid up with sickness about six weeks, on account of his excessive labors, from which however he was happily restored.  On the eighth day of April, A. D. 1838, it being Sunday, and the time appointed for a general conference of the Saints in that kingdom, and the day previous to our departure from them, they began to assemble at an early hour in the morning, and by nine o'clock there were from six to seven hundred of the Saints assembled from various parts of the country.  Believing it necessary for the good of the kingdom to have some one to preside over the whole mission, we nominated Brother Joseph Fielding to be appointed to that office, and Brother Levi Richards and William Clayton to be his counselors. The nominations met with the approbation of the whole assembly, who agreed to harken to their instructions and uphold them in their offices. These brethren were then, with eight Elders, several Priests, Teachers and Deacons, set apart and ordained to the several offices to which they were called. One of the brethren who was ordained was going to Manchester, one of the largest manufacturing towns in England, and another to the city of London, and they undoubtedly would carry the glad tidings of salvation to those places.  We then laid hands upon forty individuals, who had previously been baptized, for the gift of the Holy Ghost, after which about one hundred children were presented to us to receive a blessing, and the same day we baptized about twenty individuals for the remission of sins, and then proceeded to administer the sacrament to this numerous assembly. We then gave some general instructions to the whole Church respecting their duty to God and to one another, which were listened to with great attention and were treasured up in the hearts of most who were present.  At five o'clock, p. m., we brought the conference to a close, it having continued without intermission from nine o'clock, a. m. We then appointed seven o'clock the same evening to deliver our farewell addresses.  At the time appointed we repaired to the meeting, which was crowded to excess. Brother Hyde and myself then spoke to them respecting our labors in that land, the success of our ministry and the kindness we had experienced at their hands; told them that we hoped before long to see them again, after we had visited the Church and our families in America; but when we spoke of our departure their hearts were broken within them. They gave vent to their feelings and wept like children, and broke out in cries like the following: \"How can we part with our beloved brethren!\" \"We may never see them again!\" \"O why can you leave us!\" etc. I could not refrain; my feelings only found vent in a flood of tears.  Some persons may be disposed to accuse me of weakness on this occasion, but if any should do so, I would say that I do not envy any man's feelings who could witness such a scene with all its associations, and the finer feelings of his heart not be touched on such an occasion; indeed it would have been almost an impossibility for us to have left this dear and affectionate people had we not had the most implicit confidence in the brethren who were appointed to preside over them in our absence; but knowing their faith and virtuous conversation, and that they had the confidence of the Church, we felt assured that the affairs of the Church would be conducted in righteousness; consequently we left them under different feelings than we otherwise could have done.  Immediately after dismissing we met the official members, the number of whom were eighty, at a private house and instructed them further in their duties, and dismissed them at one o'clock the next morning.  This was certainly one of the most interesting conferences I ever attended. The services were calculated to convince the honest and give joy to Saints, and will long be remembered by all those who attended, and I have no doubt was the means of great and lasting good.  At this conference we were favored with the company of Elders Isaac Russell and Willard Richards. The latter had returned from the County of Bedford, where he had been proclaiming the gospel. In consequence of sickness his labors had not been so extensive as they otherwise would have been, and were confined within a short distance from the city of Bedford, where he raised up two small branches, which he set in order and ordained one Elder and other officers. He labored under considerable difficulty in consequence of the conduct of Elder Goodson, who accompanied him on that mission, who taught many things which were not in wisdom, which proved a barrier to the spread of the truth in that region. Elder Russell had returned from a mission to the north, having been laboring in the County of Cumberland, near the borders of Scotland, where numbers of his friends resided. While he was there he met with considerable opposition, even from those of his own family, as well as the ministers of the different denominations, who sought every opportunity to block up his way and to destroy his influence.  However, notwithstanding the great opposition, he was instrumental in bringing upwards of sixty souls into the kingdom of God, and left them rejoicing in the truth and strong in the faith of the gospel.  Thus the great work which is to go through the length and breadth of that land which will cause the hearts of thousands to rejoice, and the poor and meek to increase their joy in the Lord; which shall lead the honest-hearted to the foundation of truth; which shall prepare a holy company from that nation to meet the Lord Jesus when He shall descend from the mansions of glory and from the regions that are not known; which shall cause thousands to rail against the doctrines of Christ and His servants, and persecute the honest-in-heart; which shall prepare the ungodly for the day of vengeance of our God, and shall bind them together in the cords of darkness, was commenced in three places, viz: Preston, Bedford and Alston, which forcibly reminds me of the parable of the leaven which the woman cast into the three measures of meal.    CHAPTER IX.  OUR LODGINGS--WANTS SUPPLIED BY LIBERALITY OF SAINTS--JOURNEY TO LIVERPOOL--CONTRAST BETWEEN ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE--RETURN VOYAGE--MEETING WITH ELDERS AND SAINTS AT NEW YORK--ARRIVAL AT KIRTLAND.  During our stay in Preston, we made our home at the house of Sister Dawson, in Pole Street. We purchased our provisions, and she cooked them for us, which is quite customary in that country. For our room, lodging and cooking and a good coal fire, we each paid the sum of two shillings sterling per week, which is but little more than half the usual charge. Sister Dawson was very kind to us. Indeed the hearts of all the Saints were open to liberality, and according to their circumstances they contributed liberally of their substance, and many blessings of a temporal nature we received from them, for which I pray that my Heavenly Father may reward them a hundred fold in this world, and in the world to come with life everlasting.  During the time we labored in England, we made no public contributions except for the poor. When we were about taking our departure, the Church, knowing that we had no means to carry us to our native land, with a liberality characteristic of them, contributed to our necessities and provided us with means to take us as far as Kirtland, Ohio. The next day, being the ninth of April, we engaged our passage to Liverpool in a coach, which was to start at twelve o'clock the same day. At the time appointed we were at the place of starting, and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4754"],["title","The Philosophy of Despair (#0)"],["body","Philosophy of Despair    by  David Starr Jordan       To   John Maxson Stillman   In Token of Good Cheer       A darkening sky and a whitening sea,   And the wind in the palm trees tall;   Soon or late comes a call for me,   Down from the mountain or up from the sea,   Then let me lie where I fall.    And a friend may write--for friends there be,   On a stone from the gray sea wall,   \"Jungle and town and reef and sea--   I loved God's Earth and His Earth loved me,   Taken for all in all.\"    Today is your day and mine, the only day we have, the day in which we play our part. What our part may signify in the great whole, we may not understand, but we are here to play it, and now is our time. This we know, it is a part of action, not of whining. It is a part of love, not cynicism. It is for us to express love in terms of human helpfulness. This we know, for we have learned from sad experience that any other course of life leads toward decay and waste.     The Philosophy of Despair    The Bubbles of S嫜i.   From Fitzgerald's exquisite version of the Rub壾y嫢 of Omar Khayy嫥, I take the following quatrains which may serve as a text for what I have to say:    So when the angel of the darker Drink   At last shall find you by the river-brink,   And offering you his cup, invite your Soul   Forth to your lips to quaff, you shall not shrink.    Why, if the soul can fling the Dust aside,   And naked on the air of Heaven ride,   Wert not a shame--wert not a shame for him   In this clay carcase crippled to abide?    'Tis but a tent where takes his one-day's rest   A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;   The Sultan rises, and the dark Ferr嫳h   Strikes, and prepares it for another guest.    And fear not lest Existence, closing your   Account, and mine, shall know the like no more;   The Eternal S嫜i from that bowl hath pour'd   Millions of bubbles like us, and will pour.    When you and I behind the veil are past,   Oh, but the long, long while the world shall last,   Which of our coming and departure heeds   As the Sev'n Seas shall heed a pebble-cast.    A moment's halt--a momentary taste   Of Being from the Well amid the waste,   And lo!--the phantom caravan has reach'd   The Nothing it set out from--O, make haste!    * * *    There was the door to which I found no key;   There was the veil through which I could not see:   Some little talk awhile of Me and Thee   There was--and then no more of Thee and Me.    * * *    Why, all the Saints and Sages who discuss'd   Of the two worlds so learnedly are thrust   Like foolish prophets forth; their words to scorn   Are scatter'd and their mouths are stopt with dust.    With them the seed of wisdom did I sow,   And with my own hand wrought to make it grow   And this was all the harvest that I reap'd--   \"I come like water, and like wind I go.\"    * * *    Ah Love, could thou and I with Him conspire   To grasp this sorry scheme of Things entire,   Would we not shatter it to bits--and then   Re-mould it nearer to the heart's desire!    Yon rising Moon that looks for us again--   How oft hereafter will she wax and wane;   How oft hereafter rising look for us   Through this same garden--and for one in vain!    And when like her, O S嫜i, you shall pass   Among the guests, star-scattered on the grass,   And in your blissful errand reach the spot   Where I made one--turn down an empty glass!    * * *  And, again, in another poem from Carmen Silva's Roumanian folk-songs:    Hopeless.    Into the mist I gazed, and fear came on me,   Then said the mist: \"I weep for the lost sun.\"    We sat beneath our tent;   Then he that hath no hope drew near us there,   And sat him down by us.   We asked him: \"Hast thou seen the plains, the mountains?\"   And he made answer: \"I have seen them all.\"   And then his cloak he showed us, and his shirt,   Torn was the shirt, there, close above the heart,   Pierced was the breast, there, close above the heart--   The heart was gone.   And yet he trembled not, the while we looked,   And sought the heart, the heart that was not there.   He let us look. And he that had no hope   Smiled, that we grew so pale, and sang us songs.   Then we did envy him, that he could sing   Without a heart to suffer what he sang.   And when he went, he cast his cloak about him,   And those that met him, they could never guess   How that his shirt was torn about the heart,   And that his breast was pierced above the heart,   And that the heart was gone.    I gazed into the mist, and fear came on me,   Then said the mist: \"I weep for the lost sun.\"  This poem of Omar and of Fitzgerald is perhaps our best expression of the sadness and the grandeur of insoluble problems. It is the sweetness of philosophical sorrow which has no kinship with misery or distress. In the strains of the saddest music the soul finds the keenest delight. The same sweet, sorrowful pleasure is felt in the play of the mind about the riddles which it cannot solve.  In the presence of the infinite problem of life, the voice of Science is dumb, for Science is the co顤dinate and corrected expression of human experience, and human experience must stop with the limitations of human life. Man was not present \"When the foundations of the Earth were laid,\" and beyond the certainty that they were laid in wisdom and power, man can say little about them. Man finds in the economy of nature \"no trace of a beginning; no prospect of an end!\" He may feel sure, with Hutton, that \"time is as long as space is wide.\" But he cannot conceive of space as actually without limit, nor can he imagine any limiting conditions. He cannot think of a period before time began, nor of a state in which time shall be no more. The mind fails before the idea of time's eternal continuity. So time becomes to man merely the sequence of the earthly events in which he and his ancestors have taken part. Even thus limited it is sadly immortal, while man's stay on the earth is but of \"few days and full of trouble.\" \"Oh, but the long, long while this world shall last!\" or as the grim humorist puts it, \"we shall be a long time dead.\"  Though the meaning of time, space, existence lies beyond our reach, yet some sort of solution of the infinite problem the human heart demands. We find in life a power for action, limited though this power may be. Life is action, and action is impossible if devoid of motive or hope.  It is my purpose here to indicate some part of the answer of Science to the Philosophy of Despair. Direct reply Science has none. We cannot argue against a singer or a poet. The poet sings of what he feels, but Science speaks only of what we know. We feel infinity, but we cannot know it, for to the highest human wisdom the ultimate truths of the universe are no nearer than to the child. Science knows no ultimate truths. These are beyond the reach of man, and all that man knows must be stated in terms of his experience. But as to human experience and conduct, Science has a word to say.  Therefore Science can speak of the causes and results of Pessimism. It can touch the practical side of the riddle of life by asking certain questions, the answers to which lie within the province of human experience. Among these are the following:  Why is there a \"Philosophy of Despair?\"  Can Despair be wrought into healthful life?  In what part of the Universe are you and what are you doing?  Personal despair or discouragement may rise from failure of strength or failure of plans. This is a matter of every-day occurrence. The \"best laid schemes o' mice and men\" generally go wrong, no doubt, but this fact has little to do with the Philosophy of Pessimism. It is natural for mice and men to try again and to gain wisdom from failures. \"By the embers of loss we count our gains.\"  The Pessimism of Youth we may first consider: In the transition from childhood to manhood great changes take place in the nervous system. There is for a time a period of confusion, in which the nerve cells are acquiring new powers and new relations. This is followed by a time of joy and exuberance, a sense of a new life in a new world, a feeling of new power and adequacy, the thought that life is richer and better worth living than the child could have supposed.  To this in turn comes a feeling of reaction. The joys of life have been a thousand times felt before they come to us. We are but following part of a cut-and-dried program, \"performing actions and reciting speeches made up for us centuries before we were born.\" The new power of manhood and womanhood which seemed so wonderful find their close limitations. As our own part in the Universe seems to shrink as we take our place in it, so does the Universe itself seem to grow small, hard and unsympathetic. Very few young men or young women of strength and feeling fail to pass through a period of Pessimism. With some it is merely an affectation caught from the cheap literature of decadence. It then may find expression in imitation, as a few years ago the sad-hearted youth turned down his collar in sympathy with the \"conspicuous loneliness\" that took the starch out of the collar of Byron. \"The youth,\" says Zangwill, \"says bitter things about Life which Life would have winced to hear had it been alive.\" With others Pessimism has deeper roots and finds its expression in the poetry or philosophy of real despair.  This adolescent Pessimism cannot be wrought into action. The mood disappears when real action is demanded. The Pessimism of youth vanishes with the coming of life. Through the rush of the new century, the fad of the drooping spirit has already given way to the fad of the strenuous life. Equally unreasoning it may be, but far more wholesome.  But if action is impossible, the mood remains. And here arises the despair of the highly educated. The purpose of knowledge is action. But to refuse action is to secure time for the acquisition of more knowledge. It is written in the very structure of the brain that each impression of the senses must bring"]]]
