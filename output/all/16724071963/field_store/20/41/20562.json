In his flight the sound of these following footsteps gave him his one meager relief.  He felt vaguely that death must make a first choice of the men who were nearest; the initial morsels for the dragons would be then those who were following him.  So he displayed the zeal of an insane sprinter in his purpose to keep them in the rear. There was a race.  As he, leading, went across a little field, he found himself in a region of shells.  They hurtled over his head with long wild screams. As he listened he imagined them to have rows of cruel teeth that grinned at him.  Once one lit before him and the livid lightning of the explosion effectually barred the way in his chosen direction.  He groveled on the ground and then springing up went careering off through some bushes.  He experienced a thrill of amazement when he came within view of a battery in action.  The men there seemed to be in conventional moods, altogether unaware of the impending annihilation.  The battery was disputing with a distant antagonist and the gunners were wrapped in admiration of their shooting.  They were continually bending in coaxing postures over the guns.  They seemed to be patting them on the back and encouraging them with words.  The guns, stolid and undaunted, spoke with dogged valor.  The precise gunners were coolly enthusiastic. They lifted their eyes every chance to the smoke-wreathed hillock from whence the hostile battery addressed them.  The youth pitied them as he ran.  Methodical idiots!  Machine-like fools!  The refined joy of planting shells in the midst of the other battery's formation would appear a little thing when the infantry came swooping out of the woods.  The face of a youthful rider, who was jerking his frantic horse with an abandon of temper he might display in a placid barnyard, was impressed deeply upon his mind.  He knew that he looked upon a man who would presently be dead.  Too, he felt a pity for the guns, standing, six good comrades, in a bold row.  He saw a brigade going to the relief of its pestered fellows.  He scrambled upon a wee hill and watched it sweeping finely, keeping formation in difficult places.  The blue of the line was crusted with steel color, and the brilliant flags projected. Officers were shouting.  This sight also filled him with wonder.  The brigade was hurrying briskly to be gulped into the infernal mouths of the war god.  What manner of men were they, anyhow?  Ah, it was some wondrous breed!  Or else they didn't comprehend--the fools.  A furious order caused commotion in the artillery.  An officer on a bounding horse made maniacal motions with his arms.  The teams went swinging up from the rear, the guns were whirled about, and the battery scampered away.  The cannon with their noses poked slantingly at the ground grunted and grumbled like stout men, brave but with objections to hurry.  The youth went on, moderating his pace since he had left the place of noises.  Later he came upon a general of division seated upon a horse that pricked its ears in an interested way at the battle.  There was a great gleaming of yellow and patent leather about the saddle and bridle.  The quiet man astride looked mouse-colored upon such a splendid charger.  A jingling staff was galloping hither and thither.  Sometimes the general was surrounded by horsemen and at other times he was quite alone.  He looked to be much harassed.  He had the appearance of a business man whose market is swinging up and down.  The youth went slinking around this spot. He went as near as he dared trying to overhear words.  Perhaps the general, unable to comprehend chaos, might call upon him for information. And he could tell him.  He knew all concerning it.  Of a surety the force was in a fix, and any fool could see that if they did not retreat while they had opportunity--why--  He felt that he would like to thrash the general, or at least approach and tell him in plain words exactly what he thought him to be.  It was criminal to stay calmly in one spot and make no effort to stay destruction.  He loitered in a fever of eagerness for the division commander to apply to him.  As he warily moved about, he heard the general call out irritably: \"Tompkins, go over an' see Taylor, an' tell him not t' be in such an all-fired hurry; tell him t' halt his brigade in th' edge of th' woods; tell him t' detach a reg'ment--say I think th' center 'll break if we don't help it out some; tell him t' hurry up.\"  A slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught these swift words from the mouth of his superior. He made his horse bound into a gallop almost from a walk in his haste to go upon his mission. There was a cloud of dust.  A moment later the youth saw the general bounce excitedly in his saddle.  \"Yes, by heavens, they have!\"  The officer leaned forward.  His face was aflame with excitement.  \"Yes, by heavens, they 've held 'im! They 've held 'im!\"  He began to blithely roar at his staff: \"We 'll wallop 'im now.  We 'll wallop 'im now.  We 've got 'em sure.\"  He turned suddenly upon an aid: \"Here--you--Jones--quick--ride after Tompkins--see Taylor--tell him t' go in--everlastingly--like blazes--anything.\"  As another officer sped his horse after the first messenger, the general beamed upon the earth like a sun.  In his eyes was a desire to chant a paean.  He kept repeating, \"They 've held 'em, by heavens!\"  His excitement made his horse plunge, and he merrily kicked and swore at it.  He held a little carnival of joy on horseback.    CHAPTER VII.  The youth cringed as if discovered in a crime. By heavens, they had won after all!  The imbecile line had remained and become victors. He could hear cheering.  He lifted himself upon his toes and looked in the direction of the fight.  A yellow fog lay wallowing on the treetops.  From beneath it came the clatter of musketry.  Hoarse cries told of an advance.  He turned away amazed and angry.  He felt that he had been wronged.  He had fled, he told himself, because annihilation approached.  He had done a good part in saving himself, who was a little piece of the army. He had considered the time, he said, to be one in which it was the duty of every little piece to rescue itself if possible.  Later the officers could fit the little pieces together again, and make a battle front. If none of the little pieces were wise enough to save themselves from the flurry of death at such a time, why, then, where would be the army? It was all plain that he had proceeded according to very correct and commendable rules.  His actions had been sagacious things.  They had been full of strategy.  They were the work of a master's legs.  Thoughts of his comrades came to him.  The brittle blue line had withstood the blows and won. He grew bitter over it.  It seemed that the blind ignorance and stupidity of those little pieces had betrayed him.  He had been overturned and crushed by their lack of sense in holding the position, when intelligent deliberation would have convinced them that it was impossible.  He, the enlightened man who looks afar in the dark, had fled because of his superior perceptions and knowledge.  He felt a great anger against his comrades.  He knew it could be proved that they had been fools.  He wondered what they would remark when later he appeared in camp.  His mind heard howls of derision.  Their density would not enable them to understand his sharper point of view.  He began to pity himself acutely.  He was ill used.  He was trodden beneath the feet of an iron injustice.  He had proceeded with wisdom and from the most righteous motives under heaven's blue only to be frustrated by hateful circumstances.  A dull, animal-like rebellion against his fellows, war in the abstract, and fate grew within him.  He shambled along with bowed head, his brain in a tumult of agony and despair.  When he looked loweringly up, quivering at each sound, his eyes had the expression of those of a criminal who thinks his guilt and his punishment great, and knows that he can find no words.  He went from the fields into a thick woods, as if resolved to bury himself.  He wished to get out of hearing of the crackling shots which were to him like voices.  The ground was cluttered with vines and bushes, and the trees grew close and spread out like bouquets.  He was obliged to force his way with much noise.  The creepers, catching against his legs, cried out harshly as their sprays were torn from the barks of trees.  The swishing saplings tried to make known his presence to the world.  He could not conciliate the forest.  As he made his way, it was always calling out protestations.  When he separated embraces of trees and vines the disturbed foliages waved their arms and turned their face leaves toward him.  He dreaded lest these noisy motions and cries should bring men to look at him.  So he went far, seeking dark and intricate places.  After a time the sound of musketry grew faint and the cannon boomed in the distance.  The sun, suddenly apparent, blazed among the trees.  The insects were making rhythmical noises.  They seemed to be grinding their teeth in unison.  A woodpecker stuck his impudent head around the side of a tree.  A bird flew on lighthearted wing.  Off was the rumble of death.  It seemed now that Nature had no ears.  This landscape gave him assurance.  A fair field holding life.  It was the religion of peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.  He conceived Nature to be a woman with a deep aversion to tragedy.  He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear.  High in a treetop he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepidation.  The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said.  Nature had given him a sign.  The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado.  He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46300"],["title","The First Canadians in France (#0)"],["body","[Illustration: \"HE IS A MAN AFTER MY OWN HEART!\" EXCLAIMED MADAME COUILLARD]                                       THE                             FIRST CANADIANS                                IN FRANCE                        THE CHRONICLE OF A MILITARY                         HOSPITAL IN THE WAR ZONE                                      BY                              F.

All honour to them that in spite of this handicap they give of their best, and give it whole-heartedly to their stricken comrades.  The pill of fact herein is but thinly coated with the sugar of fiction, but if the reader can get a picture, however indefinite, of military hospital life in France, these pages will not have been written altogether in vain.  F. McK B.                                 *ILLUSTRATIONS*   \"He Is a Man After My Own Heart!\" exclaimed Madame Couillard (See page 166) . . . . . . _Frontispiece_  The Song Was Sad—But We Laughed and Laughed Until We Wept Again  René Had Risen in the Excitement of His Description  \"How Can You?\" She Cried Involuntarily, \"How Can a Little Lad Like You Bear to Kill Men with a Bayonet?\"  German Wounded                         *THE FIRST CANADIANS IN FRANCE*                                  *CHAPTER I*   We were a heterogeneous lot—no one could deny that—all the way down from big Bill Barker, the heavyweight hostler, to little Huxford, the featherweight hustler.  No commanding officer, while sober, would have chosen us _en masse_. But we weren’t chosen—we just arrived, piece by piece; and the Hammer of Time, with many a nasty knock, has welded us.  One by one, from the farthest corners of the Dominion, the magic magnet of the war drew us to the plains of Valcartier, and one by one it dropped us side by side.  Why some came or why they are still here God knows!  Man may merely conjecture.  Divers forces helped to speed us from our homes: love of adventure, loss of a sweetheart, family quarrels, the wander-spirit, and, among many other sentiments—patriotism.  But only one force held us together: our Colonel! Without him, as an entity, we ceased to exist.  His broad-minded generosity and liberal forbearance closed many an angry breach.  His love of us finds its analogy only in the love of a father for his prodigal son.  Long after we reached France, when the dull monotony of daily routine had somewhat sobered us, one early morning the sweet but disturbing note of the bugle sounding the _reveille_ brought me back from dreams of home. I lay drowsily listening to its insistent voice. The door of my room opened softly, and the orderly stole in.  He was a red-cheeked, full-lipped country lad, scarce seventeen years of age.  He knelt down before the fireplace and meditatively raked the ashes from its recess.  He was a slow lad; slow in speech, slower in action, and his big dreamy blue eyes belied his military bearing.  I turned over in bed to get a better view of him.  \"What freak of fancy brought you so far from home, Wilson?\" I queried.  \"Dunno, zur,\" he drawled.  \"Not much fun hustlin’ coals in the mornin’ nur pullin’ teeth in the afternoon.\"  For Wilson, among his multitudinous duties, was dental orderly too.  \"There’s such an air of farm and field about you, Wilson, that sometimes, at short range, I imagine I get a whiff of new-mown hay.\"  He sat up on his haunches, balancing the shovel upon his outstretched hand.  The pool of memory was stirred.  A hazy thought was struggling to the surface.  He looked dreamily toward me for a moment before he replied.  \"I wuz born an’ raised in the country, zur,\" he said.  \"When the war broke out I wuz pickin’ apples on dad’s farm.  I didn’t like my job. Gee!  I wish’t I’d stayed an’ picked ’em now.\"  How we ever taught Wilson to say \"Sir,\" or even his corruption of the word, must remain forever shrouded in mystery; but it was accomplished at last, just like many other great works of art.  The Canadian spirit of democracy resents any semblance of a confession of inferiority, and the sergeant-major’s troubles were like unto those of Job.  Military discipline commenced in earnest when the ship left the harbour at Quebec, and has hung over us like a brooding robin ever since.  It was an eventful morning to us (and to England) when our fleet of thirty ocean liners, with its freight of thirty-three thousand soldiers, steamed slowly into the harbour at Plymouth and dropped anchor.  For two glorious October weeks we had bedecked the Atlantic.  His Majesty’s fleet night and day had guarded us with an ever-increasing care.  I can still look over the starboard rail and see the black smoke of the _Gloria_ prowling along in the south, and, afar off in the north, the _Queen Mary_ watching our hazardous course.  The jaunty little _Charybdis_ minced perkily ahead.  There were other battleships, too, which picked us up from time to time; and the _Monmouth_, on the last voyage she was destined to make, steamed through our lines one day.  The brave fellows, who were so soon to meet a watery grave, lined up upon her deck, giving us three resounding cheers as she passed by, and we echoed them with a will.  Captain Reggy, our dapper mess secretary, was pacing the hurricane deck one day.  From time to time his gaze turned wistfully across the waves to the other two lines of ships steaming peacefully along side by side. Something weighty was on his mind. Occasionally he glanced up to the military signalling officer on the bridge, and with inexplicable interest watched his movements with the flags.  \"I say,\" Reggy called up to him, \"can you get a message across to the _Franconia_?\"  \"She’s third ship in the third line—a little difficult, I should say,\" the signaller replied.  \"But it _can_ be done, can’t it?\" Reggy coaxed.  \"Yes, if it’s very important.\"  \"It’s most important, I want to send a message to one of the nurses.\"  The signalling lieutenant leaned both elbows upon the rail and looked down in grinning amazement upon his intrepid interlocutor.  \"What the d——l!  I say, you’re the sort of man we need at the front—one with plenty of nerve!\"  \"Be a sport and send it over!\" Reggy coaxed.  \"All right—I’ll take a chance.\"  \"Ask for Nursing Sister Marlow.  Give her Captain Reggy’s compliments and best wishes, and will she join him on board for dinner this evening, seven o’clock!\"  There was a flutter of flags for several seconds, while the ridiculous message passed across from ship to ship.  Reggy waited anxiously for a reply.  In less than ten minutes from across the deep came this very lucid answer: \"Nursing Sister Marlow’s compliments to Captain Reggy.  Regrets must decline kind invitation to dinner.  _Mal de mer_ has rendered her _hors de combat_.  Many thanks.\"  On the last day of our journey the speedy torpedo boat destroyers rushed out to meet us and whirled round and round us hour by hour as we entered the English Channel. Soon the welcome shores of England loomed through the haze, and the sight sent a thrill through all our hearts.  We had scarce dropped anchor when, from the training ship close by, a yawl pulled quickly toward us, \"manned\" by a dozen or more lads from a training ship.  They rowed with the quick neat stroke of trained athletes, and as the boat came alongside ours they shipped their oars and raised their boyish voices in a welcoming cheer.  We leaned over the side of our ship and returned their greeting with a stentorian heartiness that startled the sleeping town.  Showers of small coin and cigarettes were dropped into their boat, and the way in which they fought for position, scrambling over or under one another, upsetting this one or knocking down that, showed that these lads were quite capable of upholding all the old fighting traditions of the British Navy. A tug-boat soon steamed alongside, too, and down the accommodation-ladder scrambled those of us who were lucky enough to have permission to go ashore.  \"Come along, Reggy,\" I shouted.  But Reggy shook his head sorrowfully, and his handsome face was clouded.  \"Just my rotten luck to be orderly officer on a day like this!\" he replied.  \"To-day I guard the ship, but to-morrow—oh, to-morrow!\"  Reggy held out both hands in mock appeal to the shore: \"Me for the red paint and city lights!\"  Progress up the streets of Devonport was slow.  Thousands of troops already landed were marching to the time of \"The Maple Leaf Forever,\" and every foot of pavement or sidewalk was packed with struggling but enthusiastic humanity shouting itself hoarse in delirious welcome.  We were on the upper deck of a tram-car, leaning over the throng, and eagerly looking for the faces of friends "]]]
