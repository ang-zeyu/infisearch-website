That morning, being Monday, the 29th of July, we followed the Spaniards, and all that day had with them a long and great fight, wherein {xxvii} there was great valour shown generally of our company.\"  A few days later, Admiral Howard, also writing to Sir Francis Walsyngham, said, \"In our last fight with the enemy, before Gravelines, the 29th of July, we sunk three of their ships, and made some go near the shore, leaking so they were not able to live at sea.  After that fight, notwithstanding that our powder and shot was well near all spent, we set on a brag countenance and gave them chase, as though we had wanted nothing, until we had cleared our own coast, and some part of Scotland of them.\"  Such were the Fathers of admiralty as to-day we envisage it; and, dark as some of our naval pages have since been, their tradition has never died, or lacked among us sons to sustain and adorn it in larger issues. There have been times when the country in general and its statesmen in particular have lost or under-valued their sea-vision.  In 1667, less than eighty years after the defeat of the Armada, and scarcely ten after the death of Blake, one of the greatest figures in English naval history, to such a pass had our naval administration come that the Dutch were able to sail almost unchallenged up the Medway; to destroy the booms and half-equipped battleships; to capture the _Royal Charles_ as a trophy; for several weeks to blockade London; and, in the end, to compel the English Government to a disadvantageous peace.  Fortunately that was a lesson that England never forgot, and, though there were to follow lapses, not a few, in the struggles that followed against the lust for world-power, first of Louis XVI, and, a hundred {xxviii} later, of Napoleon, the navy of England played a not unworthy and probably a decisive part.  In Hawke and Rodney and Hood, and supremely in Nelson, in their unremembered captains and too-often ill-requited men, the spirit of the great Elizabethans lived again and ultimately prevailed, as it was bound to do.  Not less for peoples in the comity of nations than for individuals in smaller societies, the highest task is to put at the disposal of human progress their characteristic genius.  In military capacity, never the equal of France; behind many other nations in certain of the arts and sciences; lacking the spiritual insight of the East and the buoyant versatility of the West, this maritime adequacy, this gift of admiralty, seems, by virtue of her history, to have been allotted to Britain--and she has always been at her greatest, both for herself and for mankind, when she and her statesmen have realized this most fully.  That among her seamen this conception was as strong as ever, the history of the Great War has abundantly made clear, little as most of them dreamed, on that July morning, to be described in our first chapter, that they were on the verge of an ordeal, in which humanity's fate would lie in their hands as never in history.  And yet, had they been gifted with a vision of what was to come, certain doubts might well have been pardoned in them.  Colossal as the machinery was, it was largely untried.  New methods and engines, with unforeseeable possibilities, were already in embryo or in actual being.  The submarine, the airship, the mine--in less than half an hour, a fleet might be at the bottom.  Recent {xxix} naval campaigns had shown that, whereas a century before, it had been the exception for a stricken ship to sink, it was now the exception for it to float; and what of the men in a modern naval battle?  For it would have to be remembered that, while on the one hand the terrors of naval warfare had immeasurably increased, the men who had to endure them had become, on the other, the educated products of a more sensitive civilization.  Whereas, even in Nelson's time, the majority of British seamen were quite unable to read or write, and were too often, for all their courage, little better than human animals--many had been impressed by slum raids in seaport towns, and disciplined by a brutality now scarcely imaginable--the sailors of to-day, if of the same fibre, were men of a wholly different upbringing.  They were the brothers of the shop-attendants, the men in the counting-house, the skilled workmen with their trade unions.  They were even better educated than these, with a mellower, deeper, and more humorous philosophy of life.  For them the navy was a career, from boyhood to old age, with solid rewards--and not a last resort.  How would their new refinement weather the storm?  In the following pages we have tried to answer this, as often as possible, in their own words.     {3}  THE HEROIC RECORD OF THE BRITISH NAVY    CHAPTER I  THE FOURTH OF AUGUST, 1914    Roman, Phoenician, Saxon, Dane,   From these white shores turned not again.   Save to the sea that bore them hence,   For their delight or their defense,   Judgment, persuasion, daring, thrift,   Each to the others lent his gift,   To whom, when all had shared, the sea   Added her own of admiralty.   It was early on the morning of July 20, 1914, that a couple of guests, who had courteously been invited to be present in the gunboat _Niger_ for the King's inspection of the Fleet, made their way through the sleeping streets toward Portsmouth Dockyard.  There were to be no manoeuvres this year since, as had already been announced in March, a test mobilization of the Third Fleet was to take their place.  This Third Fleet consisted of the older ships of the navy, and depended for a large proportion of its _personnel_ upon the Royal Fleet Reserve--a body of ex-naval seamen and other ratings, brought into being under Lord Goschen, and afterward strengthened and reorganized by the Selborne administration {4} of 1902 onward.  To man this fleet had necessitated the calling of about 10,000 seamen and 1,500 marines--all of them volunteers from civil life; and its assemblage at Spithead with the First and Second Fleets had secured, between the Hampshire coast and the Isle of Wight, the greatest exhibition of naval power that the world had then seen.  Since Wednesday, July 10th, the various units and squadrons had been gathering to their appointed stations, in some places eleven lines deep; while, upon the same occasion, and for the first time, there had been a full mobilization of the naval air forces.  Less dramatic than the usual manoeuvres, and unaccompanied by any of the splendour that had attended most previous Royal reviews, this test mobilization--this bringing into being of the full fighting power of our naval reserves--was so valuable an exercise that, as Mr. Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, had said in his announcement of it, it was a matter for some surprise that it had never before been undertaken.  Nevertheless, as a national spectacle, it had attracted but little public attention, as the blinded windows and empty streets of Southsea and Portsmouth testified.  Grey as steel from vault to horizon but for a single wavering streak of blue, there seemed little prospect in the sky overhead of the fine day that the sailors had foretold; and nothing could have been more sombre than the early morning scene when, without ceremony and almost unnoticed, the Royal Yacht, with the King on board, left her berth in the Dockyard.  Picking her course slowly past the Sally Port, {5} so beloved by Marryat, she steamed through the choppy waters to her place at the head of the great fleet; and it was not until she reached Spithead, unsaluted by flag or gun, that the clouds up above began to break, and the sun to shine down on that floating city, now beginning briskly to awake to life.  Long before the little _Niger_, indeed, was herself out in the Solent, all the long lines were fully astir.  Trim picket-boats, scattering spray, were plying up and down with mails and provisions.  Cables were rattling till only a single anchor held each of the great ships in her proper position.  Flags and semaphores were busy with final instructions.  Veils of smoke began to wreathe in the air; and then, at the Admiral's signal, and with no other pageantry than that inherent in its own latent might, the vast assembly, with deliberate precision, began to get under way and out to sea.  Led by the Royal Yacht, the _Victoria and Albert_, her graceful black hull streaked with gold--preceded, according to custom, by the state vessel of the Elder Brethren of Trinity House--by the time the _Iron Duke_, at the head of the First Fleet's battleships, came abreast of the Nab Lightship, the Royal Yacht was already at anchor to receive the salutes of the departing navy.  For two whole hours the King stood on the bridge, while ship after ship filed before him, each of the larger battleships an embodiment of greater strength than was represented by the whole fleet that had destroyed the Armada, and each of the battle-cruisers capable of a speed and striking-power that, a century before, would have seemed but the {6} wildest of dreams.  These were led by the _Lion_, flying the flag of a then comparatively unknown officer, Sir David Beatty, who, only the evening before, had received the honour of knighthood on board the Royal Yacht.  Following the _Lion_ and her consorts came the light cruisers, and after these the destroyers and submarines, each of the latter submerging and rising to the surface again as she came abreast of the _Victoria and Albert_, while, to complete the picture, and to foreshadow the enormous development of aerial power in the years immediately to follow, each accompanying aeroplane and seaplane dipped in the air by way of salute.  So the Fleet passed out, great though it was, still only a portion of the total British sea forces, and producing scarcely a ripple upon the national attention, fixed on what seemed to it then a thousand more important matters.  Had it been"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/47248"],["title","The Heroic Record of the British Navy: A Short History of the Naval War, (#4)"],["body"," that, as it then was, no eye would ever behold it again; that, in less than three weeks, stripped at its war stations, the fate of the world would visibly depend upon it--with what other eyes would the whole Empire have watched Spithead on that July morning!  But, for the vast mass of Englishmen the world over, the incident passed without notice.  Politically, the affairs of Ireland, the readjustment of the House of Lords, and the aspirations of Labour apparently held the field.  For the anxious few, to whom the position in Europe seemed already ominously uneasy, it may have been otherwise.  But none of them had publicly spoken; and it is now clear, with so sinister a rapidity {7} did the events leading to war follow each other, that the test mobilization designed, not without criticism, to supercede the usual manoeuvres, was coincident with, rather than the outcome of, the hardening of the general diplomatic position.  That was on July 20, 1914, and, upon the political events that ensued, it would be quite impossible, in the present volume, to dwell for more than a moment or two.  Very briefly, they succeeded one another as follows.  On July 23d, the Austrian memorandum to Serbia, relative to the murder of the Archduke Ferdinand, the heir to the throne, by a Serbian anarchist at Sarajevo on June 28th, was formally submitted.  So drastic were the terms of this that its warlike significance was immediately apparent to the whole of Europe: and a reply from Serbia was demanded in forty-eight hours.  This was given within the specified time, all the Austrian demands being acceded to, with two exceptions. These were that Austrian representatives should collaborate with Serbia in the suppression of anti-Austrian agitation and also in the judicial proceedings that were demanded against all connected with the Serajevo murder.  The acceptance of these demands would, of course, have been tantamount to an admission by Serbia that she had ceased to be an independent nation.  Nevertheless she was ready to refer them to the Hague Tribunal.  The Austrian ambassador, however, acting on instructions from his Government, refused to accept anything but an unqualified assent, and left Belgrade on June 25th.  It was clear that, as regarded Serbia at any rate, {8} Austria had determined upon war; but Sir Edward, afterward Viscount, Grey, then in charge of the British Foreign Office, took instant and most strenuous steps to prevent this.  He first proposed a conference in London, in which Germany, France, and Italy should participate, to mediate in the issues between the two countries.  To this Germany disagreed, stating that discussions were taking place between Austria and Russia, from which she had hopes of a successful issue.  So fraught, however, was the whole European atmosphere with dark and immeasurable possibilities, that, in common with every other great Power, Great Britain had been obliged to take certain precautions; and, in the most immediately important of these, the navy was, of course, concerned.  Owing to the illness of his wife, Mr. Winston Churchill had left London for Cromer on the evening of July 24th--Prince Louis of Battenburg, afterward the Marquis of Milford Haven, being, as First Sea Lord, left in charge.  About lunch time on Sunday, July 26th, the day after the Austrian Ambassador had left Belgrade, Mr. Churchill telephoned Prince Louis, and, in view of this serious development, told him to take what steps seemed to him advisable, at the same time informing him that he was returning to town that evening instead of on Monday, as he had originally designed.  In ordinary circumstances, the demobilization, following upon the naval exercises, was to have begun on this Monday morning.  But Prince Louis, having made himself acquainted with all the telegrams received at the Foreign Office, had an order telegraphed {9} to Admiral Sir George Callaghan, then Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleets at Portland--the newest and most powerful units of which were afterward to form the nucleus of what was to become known as the Grand Fleet--to the effect that no ship was to leave anchorage until further orders, and that all vessels of the Second Fleet were to remain at their home ports near their balance crews.  Throughout Monday, July 27th, by telegrams all over Europe to our various representatives, by interviews at home with foreign ambassadors in London, the British Foreign Office, under Sir Edward Grey, ceaselessly worked to avoid the impending collision, or, if that might not be averted, at least to limit its extent.  On Tuesday, July 28th, Austria declared war on Serbia, and, by the next day, was bombarding the Serbian capital.  On this day, both Russia and Belgium were mobilizing their armies, Belgium as a precautionary measure of self-defense, and Russia, as regarded her southern armies only, on account of Austria's invasion of Serbia.  It was early on Wednesday morning, July 29th, that the German Chancellor, then Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, suggested to Sir Edward Goschen, our ambassador at Berlin, that if Britain remained neutral in the event of France joining Russia against an Austro-German combination, Germany would guarantee to make no territorial demands of France; would respect the neutrality of Holland; but might be forced to enter Belgium, whose integrity she would preserve, however, after the war.  In respect of the French colonies, she would make no promises.  {10}  This meant the tearing up, of course, of the treaty, in which we as well as Germany had guaranteed Belgium's inviolability, and was an unmistakable index of the line of action that Germany was prepared to take, should it suit her purpose; and it was on this morning, unreported by the papers, and entirely unknown to the nation, that the First Fleet, under Sir George Callaghan, sailed out of Portland to its war-stations.  Peace was still possible, however, or so Sir Edward Grey hoped; and, while immediately rejecting, as he was in honour bound to do, Germany's proposal with regard to Belgium, he made the new suggestion of a European Council--a Council to which these problems, even at the eleventh hour, might be submitted to avert disaster.  This plan was also destined to be fruitless.  On July 31st, Germany sent a note to Russia demanding the instant dispersal of her armies, and requesting a favourable answer by eleven o'clock on Saturday, August 1st; and it was on the same day that Sir Edward Grey asked both Germany and France if they would guarantee the integrity of Belgium, always provided that this was not infringed by any other Power.  To this France assented at once, but Germany made no reply.  Such was the position on Friday, and, on the Saturday afternoon, August 1st, Germany declared war on Russia, following this up, early on Sunday morning, with the invasion of Luxembourg by part of her advanced armies.  This was the day on which the remainder of our naval reservists, including all naval and marine pensioners up to the age of fifty-five, {11} were called to the colours--the plans for their mobilization, reception, and embarkment, in any such event as had now arisen, having been carefully prepared and coördinated with the preliminary steps required of all other Government Departments, and included in the War Book, compiled by the Committee of Imperial Defense, under the presidency of Mr. Asquith, then Prime Minister.  Simultaneously, or rather on the previous Saturday afternoon, an order to mobilize had been received at Dartmouth--the Royal Naval College in which, and in the _Britannia_ before it, so many generations of officers had received their first training.  Already, on the preceding Tuesday, the cadets had been summoned to the Quarter Deck, as the big recreation hall was called, and told by the Captain that, in the event of war, they would certainly be mobilized--the six \"terms\" into which the cadets were divided, being ordered to report in three groups at Chatham, Portsmouth, and Devonport, in this order of departure.  Of the thrill produced by this, anybody who has been a schoolboy of fifteen will have little difficulty in forming an idea; and it may be doubted if any of the boys who heard it--many of them, alas, never to see another birthday--will ever again live through such a moment as when the summons actually came on the following Saturday afternoon.  It came with added force, because, since Tuesday, the excitement had naturally died down, while most of the boys, in common with their fathers, and indeed the majority of English men and women, had found it difficult to believe that so huge a convulsion would not in some {12} manner be prevented.  By what now seems, too, in retrospect, to have been almost the acme of ironical circumstance, they were due to start their holidays on August 4th, and to these their minds had already begun to turn again.  But the summons came, and with it in each boy, as hardly less in the college itself, the death of an era so instantaneous that it was only a little later that it could be realized.  A moment before, and the normal Saturday afternoon life had been swinging along, as for so many years past--on the cricket field, in the swimming baths, in the Devonshire countryside surrounding the college; and the moment after, the cricket field was empty, with the stumps still standing there undrawn, and the lanes and river banks were being everywhere searched for such boys as were not in college.  Long before nightfall half the cadets--scarcely more than children--had left the place forever; and it was not until then that the sense of what lay before them fell upon the officers and masters left behind.  For a little while this was almost intolerable, and the more so because it would have seemed indecent to them to put it into words.  Characteristically enough, perhaps--most of them being products of the same kind of system that had produced the boys--it was finally decided, dusk though it was,"]]]
