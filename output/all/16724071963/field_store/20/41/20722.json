The Life in the Agora.—So much for the physical setting of the Agora:  of far greater interest surely are the people.  The whole square is abounding with noisy activity.  If an Athenian has no actual business to transact, he will at least go to the Agora to get the morning news.  Two turns under the “Painted Porch” will tell him the last rumor as to the foreign policy of Thebes;  whether it is true that old King Agesilaus has died at Sparta; whether corn is likely to be high, owning to a failure of crops in the Euxine (Black Sea) region; whether the “Great King” of Persia is prospering in his campaign against Egypt.  The crowd is mostly clad in white, though often the cloaks of the humbler visitors are dirty, but there is a sprinkling of gay colors,—blue, orange, and pink.  Everybody is talking at once in melodious Attic; everybody (since they are all true children of the south) is gesticulating at once.  To the babel of human voices is added the wheezing whistle of donkeys, the squealing of pigs, the cackle of poultry.  Besides, from many of the little factories and workshops on or near the Agora a great din is rising.  The clamor is prodigious.  Criers are stalking up and down the square, one bawling out that Andocides has lost a valuable ring and will pay well to recover it; another the Pheidon has a desirable horse that he will sell cheap.  One must stand still for some moments and let eye and ear accustom themselves to such utter confusion.   15.  The Booths and Shops in the Agora.—At length out of the chaos there seems to emerge a certain order.  The major part of the square is covered with little booths of boards and wicker work, very frail and able to be folded up, probably every night.  There are little lanes winding amid these booths; and each manner of huckster has its own especial “circle” or section of the market.  “Go to the wine,” “to the fish,” “to the myrtles” (_i.e._ the flowers), are common directions for finding difficult parts of the Agora.  Trade is mostly on a small scale,—the stock of each vendor is distinctly limited in its range, and Athens is without “department stores.”  Behind each low counter, laden with its wares, stands the proprietor, who keeps up a din from leathern lungs:  “Buy my oil!”  “Buy charcoal!” “Buy sausage!” etc., until he is temporarily silenced while dealing with a customer.   [Illustration: A Carpenter]   In one “circle” may be found onions and garlic (a favorite food of the poor); a little further on are the dealers in wine, fruit, and garden produce.  Lentils and peas can be had either raw, or cooked and ready to eat on the spot.  An important center is the bread market.  The huge cylindrical loaves are handed out by shrewd old women with proverbially long tongues.  Whosoever upsets one of their delicately balanced piles of loaves is certain of an artistic tongue lashing.  Elsewhere there is a pottery market, a clothes market, and, nearer the edge of the Agora, are “circles,” where objects of real value are sold, like jewelry, chariots, good furniture.  In certain sections, too, may be seen strong-voiced individuals, with little trays swung by straps before them, pacing to and fro, and calling out, not foods, but medicines, infallible cure-alls for every human distemper.  Many are the unwary fools who patronize them.   16.  The Flower and the Fish Vendors.—Two circles attract especial attention, the Myrtles and the Fish.  Flowers and foliage, especially when made up into garlands, are absolutely indispensable to the average Greek.  Has he a great family festival, _e.g._ the birth of a son, then every guest should wear a crown of olives; is it a wedding, then one of flowers.[*]  Oak-leaves do the honors for Zeus; laurel for Apollo; myrtle for Aphrodite (and is not the Love-Goddess the favorite?).  To have a social gathering without garlands, in short, is impossible.  The flower girls of Athens are beautiful, impudent, and not at all prudish.  Around their booths press bold-tongued youths, and not too discreet sires; and the girls can call everybody familiarly by name.  Very possibly along with the sale of the garlands they make arrangements (if the banquet is to be of the less respectable kind) to be present in the evening themselves, perhaps in the capacity of flute girls.  [*] The Greeks lacked many of our common flowers.  Their ordinary flowers were white violets, narcissus, lilies, crocuses, blue hyacinths, and roses (“the Flower of Zeus”).  The usual garland was made of myrtle or ivy and then entwined with various flowers.   More reputable, though not less noisy, is the fish market.  Athenians boast themselves of being no hearty “meat eaters” like their Bœotian neighbors, but of preferring the more delicate fish.  No dinner party is successful without a seasonable course of fish.  The arrival of a fresh cargo from the harbor is announced by the clanging of a bell, which is likely to leave all the other booths deserted, while a crowd elbows around the fishmonger.  He above all others commands the greatest flow of billingsgate, and is especially notorious for his arrogant treatment of his customers, and for exacting the uttermost farthing.  The “Fish” and the “Myrtles” can be sure of a brisk trade on days when all the other booth keepers around the Agora stand idle.  All this trade, of course, cannot find room in the booths of the open Agora.  Many hucksters sit on their haunches on the level ground with their few wares spread before them.  Many more have little stands between the pillars of the stoæ; and upon the various streets that converge on the market there is a fringe of shops, but these are usually of the more substantial sort.  Here are the barbers’ shops, the physicians’ offices (if the good leech is more than an itinerant quack), and all sorts of little factories, such as smithies, where the cutler’s apprentices in the rear of the shop forge the knives which the proprietor sells over the counter, the slave repositories, and finally wine establishments of no high repute, where wine may not merely be bought by the skin (as in the main Agora), but by the potful to be drunk on the premises.   17.  The Morning Visitors to the Agora.—The first tour of inspection completed, several facts become clear to the visitor.  One is the extraordinarily large proportion of _men_ among the moving multitudes. Except for the bread women and the flower girls, hardly one female is to be found among the sellers.  Among the purchasers there is not a single reputable lady.  No Athenian gentlewoman dreams of frequenting the Agora.  Even a poor man’s wife prefers to let her spouse do the family marketing.  As for the “men folk,” the average gentleman will go daily indeed to the Agora, but if he is really pretentious, it will be merely to gossip and to meet his friends; a trusted servant will attend to the regular purchasing.  Only when an important dinner party is on hand will the master take pains to order for himself.  If he does purchase in person, he will never _carry_ anything himself.  The slaves can attend to that; and only the slaveless (the poorest of all) must take away their modest rations of boiled lentils, peas, beans, onions, and garlic, usually in baskets, though yonder now is a soldier who is bearing off a measure of boiled peas inside his helmet.  Another thing is striking.  The average poor Athenian seems to have no purse.  Or rather he uses the purse provided by nature.  At every booth one can see unkempt buyers solemnly taking their small change from their mouths.[*]  Happy the people that has not learned the twentieth century wisdom concerning microbes!  For most Athenians seem marvelously healthy.  [*] A wealthier purchaser would, of course, have his own pouch, or more probably one carried for him by a slave.   Still one other fact is brought home constantly.  “Fixed prices” are absolutely unknown.  The slightest transaction involves a war of bargaining.  Wits are matched against wits, and only after a vast deal of wind do buyer and seller reach a fair compromise.  All this makes retail trade in the Agora an excellent school for public affairs or litigation.   18.  The Leisured Class in Athens.—Evidently Athens, more than many later-day cities, draws clear lines between the workers and the “gentlemen of leisure.”  There is no distinction of dress between the numerous slaves and the humbler free workers and traders; but there is obvious distinction between the artisan of bent shoulders who shambles out of yonder pungent tannery, with his scant garments girded around him, and the graceful gentleman of easy gestures and flowing drapery who moves towards the Tholos.  There is great _political_ democracy in Athens, but not so much _social_ democracy. “Leisure,” _i.e._ exemption from every kind of sordid, money-getting, hard work, is counted the true essential for a respectable existence, and to live on the effort of others and to devote oneself to public service or to letters and philosophy is the open satisfaction or the private longing of every Athenian.  A great proportion of these, therefore, who frequent the Agora are not here on practical business, unless they have official duties at the government offices.[*]  But in no city of any age has the gracious art of doing nothing been brought to such perfection. The Athenians are an intensely gregarious people.  Everybody knows everybody else.  Says an orator, “It is impossible for a man to be either a rascal or an honest man in this city without your all knowing it.”  Few men walk long alone; if they do keep their own company, they are frowned on as “misanthropes.”  The morning visit to the Agora “to tell or to hear some new thing”[+] will be followed by equally delightful idling and conversation later in the day at the Gymnasia, and later still, probably, at the dinner-party.  Easy "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4716"],["title","A Day in Old Athens; a Picture of Athenian Life (#5)"],["body","unconventional are the personal greetings.  A little shaking out of the mantle, an indescribable flourish with the hands.  A free Greek will despise himself for “bowing,” even to the Great King.  To clasp hands implies exchanging a pledge, something for more than mere salutation.  “_Chaire_, Aristomenes!”  “_Chaire_, Cleandros!”  Such is the usual greeting, using an expressive word which can mean equally well “hail!” and “farewell!”  [*] To serve the state in any official capacity (usually without any salary attached to the office) would give the highest satisfaction to any Greek.  The desire for participation in public affairs might be described as a mania.   [+] Acts of the Apostles, 17:21.   19.  Familiar Types around the Agora.—These animated, eager-faced men whose mantles fall in statuesque folds prefer obviously to walk under the Painted Porch, or the blue roof of heaven, while they evolve their philosophies, mature their political schemes, or organize the material for their orations and dramas, rather than to bend over desks within close offices.  Around the Athenian Agora, a true type of this preference, and busy with this delightful idleness, half a century earlier could have been seen a droll figure with “indescribable nose, bald head, round body, eyes rolling and twinkling with good humor,” scantily clad,—an incorrigible do-nothing, windbag, and hanger-on, a later century might assert,—yet history has given to him the name of Socrates.  Not all Athenians, of course, make such justifiable use of their idleness.  There are plenty of young men parading around in long trailing robes, their hair oiled and curled most effeminately, their fingers glittering with jewels,—“ring-loaded, curly-locked coxcombs,” Aristophanes, the comic poet, has called them,—and they are here only for silly display.  Also there are many of their elders who have no philosophy or wit to justify their continuous talking; nevertheless, all considered, it must be admitted that the Athenian makes a use of their dearly loved “leisure,” which men of a more pragmatic race will do well to consider as the fair equivalent of much frantic zeal for “business.”  Athenian “leisure” has already given the world Pericles, Thucydides, Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Socrates, and Plato, not to name such artists as Phidias, whose profession cannot exempt them from a certain manual occupation.   20.  The Barber Shops.—This habit of genteel idleness naturally develops various peculiar institutions.  For example, the barber shops are almost club rooms.  Few Hellenes at this time shave their beards[*], but to go with unkempt whiskers and with too long hair is most disgraceful.  The barber shops, booths, or little rooms let into the street walls of the houses, are therefore much frequented. The good tonsors have all the usual arts.  They can dye gray hair brown or black; they can wave or curl their patrons’ locks (and an artificially curled head is no disgrace to a man).  Especially, they keep a good supply of strong perfumes; for many people will want a little scent on their hair each morning, even if they wish no other attention.  But it is not an imposition to a barber to enter his shop, yet never move towards his low stool before the shining steel mirror.  Anybody is welcome to hang around indefinitely, listening to the proprietor’s endless flow of talk.  He will pride himself on knowing every possible bit of news or rumor:  Had the Council resolved on a new fleet-building program?  Had the Tyrant of Syracuse’s “four” the best chance in the chariot race in the next Olympic games?  The garrulity of barbers is already proverbial.  [*] Alexander the Great (336-323 B.C.) required his soldiers to be shaved (as giving less grasp for the enemy!), and the habit then spread generally through the whole Hellenic world.   “How shall I cut your hair, sir?” once asked the court tonsure of King Archeläus of Macedon.  “In silence,” came the grim answer.  But the proprietor will not do all the talking.  Everybody in the little room will join.  Wits will sharpen against wits; and if the company is of a grave and respectable sort, the conversation will grow brisk upon Plato’s theory of the “reality of ideas,” upon Euripides’s interpretation of the relations of God to man, or upon the spiritual symbolism of Scopas’s bas-reliefs at Halicarnassus.  The barber shops by the Agora then are essential portions of Athenian social life.  Later we shall see them supplemented by the Gymnasia;—but the Agora has detained us long enough.  The din and crowds are lessening.  People are beginning to stream homeward. It lacks a little of noon according to the “time-staff” (_gnomon_), a simple sun dial which stands near one of the porticoes, and we will now follow some Athenian gentleman towards his dwelling.     Chapter IV. The Athenian House and its Furnishings.   21.  Following an Athenian Gentleman Homeward.—Leaving the Agora and reëntering the streets the second impression of the residence districts becomes more favorable.  There are a few bay trees planted from block to block; and ever and anon the monotonous house walls recede, giving space to display some temple, like the Fane of Hephæstos[*] near the Market Place, its columns and pediment flashing not merely with white marble, but with the green, scarlet, and gold wherewith the Greeks did not hesitate to decorate their statuary.  [*] Wrongly called the “Theseum” in modern Athens.   At street corners and opposite important mansions a Hermes-bust like those in the plaza rises, and a very few houses have a couple of pillars at their entrances and some outward suggestion of hidden elegance.  We observe that almost the entire crowd leaving the Agora goes on foot.  To ride about in a chariot is a sign of undemocratic presumption; while only women or sick men will consent to be borne in a litter.  We will select a sprucely dressed gentleman who has just been anointed in a barber’s shop and accompany him to his home. He is neither one of the decidedly rich, otherwise his establishment would be exceptional, not typical, nor is he of course one of the hard-working poor.  Followed by perhaps two clean and capable serving lads, he wends his way down several of the narrow lanes that lie under the northern brow of the Acropolis[*].  Before a plain solid house door he halts and cries, “_Pai!  Pai!_” [“Boy!  Boy!”]. There is a rattle of bolts and bars.  A low-visaged foreign-born porter, whose business it is to show a surly front to all unwelcome visitors, opens and gives a kind of salaam to his master; while the porter’s huge dog jumps up barking and pawing joyously.  [*] This would be a properly respectable quarter of the city, but we do not know of any really “aristocratic residence district” in Athens.   As we enter behind him (carefully advancing with right foot foremost, for it is bad luck to tread a threshold with the _left_) we notice above the lintel some such inscription as “Let no evil enter here!” or “To the Good Genius,” then a few steps through a narrow passage bring us into the _Aula_, the central court, the indispensable feature of every typical Greek house.   22.  The Type and use of a Greek House.—All domestic architecture, later investigators will discover, falls into two great categories—of the northern house and the southern house.  The northern house begins with a single large room, “the great hall,” then lesser rooms are added to it.  It gets its light from windows in the outer walls, and it is covered by a single steep roof.  The southern (Greek and Oriental) house is a building inclosing a rectangular court.  The rooms, many or few, get their light from this court, while they are quite shut off from the world outside.  All in all, for warm climates this style of house is far more airy, cool, comfortable than the other.  The wide open court becomes the living room of the house save in very inclement weather.  Socrates is reported to have uttered what was probably the average sensible view about a good house.[*]  The good house, he thought, should be cool in summer, and warm in winter, convenient for the accommodation of the family and its possessions.  The central rooms should therefore be lofty and should open upon the south, yet for protection in summer there should be good projecting eaves (over the court) and again the rooms on the northern exposure should be made lower.  All this is mere sense, but really the average male Athenian does not care a great deal about his dwelling.  He spends surprisingly little money beautifying it.  Unless he is sick, he will probably be at home only for sleeping and eating.  The Agora, the Public Assembly, the Jury Courts, the Gymnasium, the great religious festivals consume his entire day.  “I never spend my time indoors,” says Xenophon’s model Athenian, “my wife is well able to run the household by herself.”[+]  Such being the case, even wealthy men have very simple establishments, although it is at length complained (_e.g._ by Demosthenes) that people are now building more luxurious houses, and are not content with the plain yet sufficient dwellings of the great age of Pericles.[@]  [*] In Xenophon’s _Memorabilia_, III. 8, §§ 9,10.   [+] Xenophon, “_Economics_,” VII. 3.   [@] Very probably in such outlying Greek cities as Syracuse, Taras (Tarentum), etc., more elegant houses could be found than any at this time in Athens.   23.  The Plan of a Greek House.—The plan of a Greek house naturally varies infinitely according to the size of the land plot, the size of the owner’s family, his own taste, and wealth.  It will usually be rectangular, with the narrower side toward the street; but this is not invariable.  In the larger houses there will be two courts (_aulæ_), one behind the other, and each with its own circuit of dependent chambers.  The court first entered will be the _Andronitis_ (the Court of the Men), and may be even large enough to afford a considerable promenade for"]]]
