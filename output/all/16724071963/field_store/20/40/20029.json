Then he held further conversation with his fellows, after which he turned to Rob and announced:  \"Me see white man many times.  Come in big boats.  White man all bad. Make kill with bang-sticks.  We kill white man with club.  Then we eat white man.  Dead white man good.  Live white man bad!\"  This did not please Rob at all.  The idea of being eaten by savages had never occurred to him as a sequel to his adventures.  So he said rather anxiously to the chief.  \"Look here, old fellow; do you want to die?\"  \"Me no die.  You die,\" was the reply.  \"You'll die, too, if you eat me,\" said Rob.  \"I'm full of poison.\"  \"Poison?  Don't know poison,\" returned the chief, much perplexed to understand him.  \"Well, poison will make you sick--awful sick.  Then you'll die.  I'm full of it; eat it every day for breakfast.  It don't hurt white men, you see, but it kills black men quicker than the bang-stick.\"  The chief listened to this statement carefully, but only understood it in part.  After a moment's reflection he declared:  \"White man lie.  Lie all time.  Me eat plenty white man.  Never get sick; never die.\"  Then he added, with renewed cheerfulness: \"Me eat you, too!\"  Before Rob could think of a further protest, his captors caught up the end of the rope and led him away through the forest.  He was tightly bound, and one strand of rope ran across the machine on his wrist and pressed it into his flesh until the pain was severe.  But he resolved to be brave, whatever happened, so he stumbled along after the savages without a word.  After a brief journey they came to a village, where Rob was thrust into a brushwood hut and thrown upon the ground, still tightly bound.  \"We light fire,\" said the chief.  \"Then kill little white man.  Then eat him.\"  With this comforting promise he went away and left Rob alone to think the matter over.  \"This is tough,\" reflected the boy, with a groan.  \"I never expected to feed cannibals.  Wish I was at home with mother and dad and the girls. Wish I'd never seen the Demon of Electricity and his wonderful inventions.  I was happy enough before I struck that awful Master Key. And now I'll be eaten--with salt and pepper, probably.  Wonder if there'll be any gravy.  Perhaps they'll boil me, with biscuits, as mother does chickens.  Oh-h-h-h-h!  It's just awful!\"  In the midst of these depressing thoughts he became aware that something was hurting his back.  After rolling over he found that he had been lying upon a sharp stone that stuck out of the earth.  This gave him an idea.  He rolled upon the stone again and began rubbing the rope that bound him against the sharp edge.  Outside he could hear the crackling of fagots and the roar of a newly-kindled fire, so he knew he had no time to spare.  He wriggled and pushed his body right and left, right and left, sawing away at the rope, until the strain and exertion started the perspiration from every pore.  At length the rope parted, and hastily uncoiling it from his body Rob stood up and rubbed his benumbed muscles and tried to regain his lost breath.  He had not freed himself a moment too soon, he found, for hearing a grunt of surprise behind him he turned around and saw a native standing in the door of the hut.  Rob laughed, for he was not a bit afraid of the blacks now.  As the native made a rush toward him the boy drew the electric tube from his pocket, pointed it at the foe, and pressed the button.  The fellow sank to the earth without even a groan, and lay still.  Then another black entered, followed by the fat chief.  When they saw Rob at liberty, and their comrade lying apparently dead, the chief cried out in surprise, using some expressive words in his own language.  \"If it's just the same to you, old chap,\" said Rob, coolly, \"I won't be eaten to-day.  You can make a pie of that fellow on the ground.\"  \"No!  We eat you,\" cried the chief, angrily.  \"You cut rope, but no get away; no boat!\"  \"I don't need a boat, thank you,\" said the boy; and then, as the other native sprang forward, he pointed the tube and laid him out beside his first victim.  At this act the chief stood an instant in amazed uncertainty.  Then he turned and rushed from the hut.  Laughing with amusement at the waddling, fat figure, Rob followed the chief and found himself standing almost in the center of the native village.  A big fire was blazing merrily and the blacks were busy making preparations for a grand feast.  Rob was quickly surrounded by a crowd of the villagers, who chattered fiercely and made threatening motions in his direction; but as the chief cried out to them a warning in the native tongue they kept a respectful distance and contented themselves with brandishing their spears and clubs.  \"If any of your fellows come nearer,\" Rob said to the fat chief, \"I'll knock 'em over.\"  \"What you make do?\" asked the chief, nervously.  \"Watch sharp, and you'll see,\" answered Rob.  Then he made a mocking bow to the circle and continued: \"I'm pleased to have met you fellows, and proud to think you like me well enough to want to eat me; but I'm in a bit of a hurry to-day, so I can't stop to be digested.\"  After which, as the crowd broke into a hum of surprise, he added: \"Good-day, black folks!\" and quickly turned the indicator of his traveling machine to the word \"up.\"  Slowly he rose into the air, until his heels were just above the gaping blacks; but there he stopped short.  With a thrill of fear he glanced at the indicator.  It was pointed properly, and he knew at once that something was wrong with the delicate mechanism that controlled it. Probably the pressure of the rope across its face, when he was bound, had put it out of order.  There he was, seven feet in the air, but without the power to rise an inch farther.  This short flight, however, had greatly astonished the blacks, who, seeing his body suspended in mid-air, immediately hailed him as a god, and prostrated themselves upon the ground before him.  The fat chief had seen something of white men in his youth, and had learned to mistrust them.  So, while he remained as prostrate as the rest, he peeped at Rob with one of his little black eyes and saw that the boy was ill at ease, and seemed both annoyed and frightened.  So he muttered some orders to the man next him, who wriggled along the ground until he had reached a position behind Rob, when he rose and pricked the suspended \"god\" with the point of his spear.  \"Ouch!\" yelled the boy; \"stop that!\"  He twisted his head around, and seeing the black again make a movement with the spear, Rob turned his electric tube upon him and keeled him over like a ten-pin.  The natives, who had looked up at his cry of pain, again prostrated themselves, kicking their toes against the ground in a terrified tattoo at this new evidence of the god's powers.  The situation was growing somewhat strained by this time, and Rob did not know what the savages would decide to do next; so he thought it best to move away from them, since he was unable to rise to a greater height.  He turned the indicator towards the south, where a level space appeared between the trees; but instead of taking that direction he moved towards the northeast, a proof that his machine had now become absolutely unreliable.  Moreover, he was slowly approaching the fire, which, although it had ceased blazing, was a mass of glowing red embers.  In his excitement he turned the indicator this way and that, trying to change the direction of his flight, but the only result of his endeavor was to carry him directly over the fire, where he came to a full stop.  \"Murder!  Help!  Fire and blazes!\" he cried, as he felt the glow of the coals beneath him.  \"I'll be roasted, after all!  Here; help, Fatty, help!\"  The fat chief sprang to his feet and came to the rescue.  He reached up, caught Rob by the heels, and pulled him down to the ground, away from the fire.  But the next moment, as he clung to the boy's feet, they both soared into the air again, and, although now far enough from the fire to escape its heat, the savage, finding himself lifted from the earth, uttered a scream of horror and let go of Rob, to fall head over heels upon the ground.  The other blacks had by this time regained their feet, and now they crowded around their chief and set him upright again.  Rob continued to float in the air, just above their heads, and now abandoned all thoughts of escaping by means of his wrecked traveling machine.  But he resolved to regain a foothold upon the earth and take his chances of escape by running rather than flying.  So he turned the indicator to the word \"down,\" and very slowly it obeyed, allowing him, to his great relief, to sink gently to the ground.     6.  The Buccaneers   Once more the blacks formed a circle around our adventurer, who coolly drew his tube and said to the chief:  \"Tell your people I'm going to walk away through those trees, and if any one dares to interfere with me I'll paralyze him.\"  The chief understood enough English to catch his meaning, and repeated the message to his men.  Having seen the terrible effect of the electric tube they wisely fell back and allowed the boy to pass.  He marched through their lines with a fine air of dignity, although he was fearful lest some of the blacks should stick a spear into him or bump his head with a war-club.  But they were awed by the wonders they had seen and were still inclined to believe him a god, so he was not molested.  When he found himself outside the village he made for the high plateau in the center of the island, where he could be safe from the cannibals while he collected his thoughts.  But when he reached the place he found the sides so steep he could not climb them, so he adjusted the indicator to the word \"up\" and found it had still had enough power to support his body while he clambered up the rocks to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/436"],["title","The Master Key (#5)"],["body",", grass-covered space at the top.  Then, reclining upon his back, he gave himself up to thoughts of how he might escape from his unpleasant predicament.  \"Here I am, on a cannibal island, hundreds of miles from civilization, with no way to get back,\" he reflected.  \"The family will look for me every day, and finally decide I've broken my neck.  The Demon will call upon me when the week is up and won't find me at home; so I'll miss the next three gifts.  I don't mind that so much, for they might bring me into worst scrapes than this.  But how am I to get away from this beastly island?  I'll be eaten, after all, if I don't look out!\"  These and similar thoughts occupied him for some time, yet in spite of much planning and thinking he could find no practical means of escape.  At the end of an hour he looked over the edge of the plateau and found it surrounded by a ring of the black cannibals, who had calmly seated themselves to watch his movements.  \"Perhaps they intend to starve me into surrender,\" he thought; \"but they won't succeed so long as my tablets hold out.  And if, in time, they should starve me, I'll be too thin and tough to make good eating; so I'll get the best of them, anyhow.\"  Then he again lay down and began to examine his electrical traveling machine.  He did not dare take it apart, fearing he might not be able to get it together again, for he knew nothing at all about its construction.  But he discovered two little dents on the edge, one on each side, which had evidently been caused by the pressure of the rope.  \"If I could get those dents out,\" he thought, \"the machine might work.\"  He first tried to pry out the edges with his pocket knife, but the attempt resulted in failure,  Then, as the sides seemed a little bulged outward by the dents, he placed the machine between two flat stones and pressed them together until the little instrument was nearly round again.  The dents remained, to be sure, but he hoped he had removed the pressure upon the works.  There was just one way to discover how well he had succeeded, so he fastened the machine to his wrist and turned the indicator to the word \"up.\"  Slowly he ascended, this time to a height of nearly twenty feet.  Then his progress became slower and finally ceased altogether.  \"That's a little better,\" he thought.  \"Now let's see if it will go sidewise.\"  He put the indicator to \"north-west,\"--the direction of home--and very slowly the machine obeyed and carried him away from the plateau and across the island.  The natives saw him go, and springing to their feet began uttering excited shouts and throwing their spears at him.  But he was already so high and so far away that they failed to reach him, and the boy continued his journey unharmed.  Once the branches of a tall tree caught him and nearly tipped him over; but he managed to escape others by drawing up his feet.  At last he was free of the island and traveling over the ocean again.  He was not at all sorry to bid good-by to the cannibal island, but he was worried about the machine, which clearly was not in good working order.  The vast ocean was beneath him, and he moved no faster than an ordinary walk.  \"At this rate I'll get home some time next year,\"  he grumbled. \"However, I suppose I ought to be glad the machine works at all.\"  And he really was glad.  All the afternoon and all the long summer night he moved slowly over the water.  It was annoying to go at \"a reg'lar jog-trot,\" as Rob called it, after his former swift flight; but there was no help for it.  Just as dawn was breaking he saw in the distance a small vessel, sailing in the direction he was following, yet scarcely moving for lack of wind.  He soon caught up with it, but saw no one on deck, and the craft had a dingy and uncared-for appearance that was not reassuring. But after hovering over it for some time Rob decided to board the ship and rest for a while.  He alighted near the bow, where the deck was highest, and was about to explore the place when a man came out of the low cabin and espied him.  This person had a most villainous countenance, and was dark-skinned, black-bearded and dressed in an outlandish, piratical costume.  On seeing the boy he gave a loud shout and was immediately joined by four companions, each as disagreeable in appearance as the first.  Rob knew there would be trouble the moment he looked at this evil crew, and when they drew their daggers and pistols and began fiercely shouting in an unknown tongue, the boy sighed and took the electric tube from his coat pocket.  The buccaneers did not notice the movement, but rushed upon him so quickly that he had to press the button at a lively rate.  The tube made no noise at all, so it was a strange and remarkable sight to see the pirates suddenly drop to the deck and lie motionless.  Indeed, one was so nearly upon him when the electric current struck him that his head, in falling, bumped into Rob's stomach and sent him reeling against the side of the vessel.  He quickly recovered himself, and seeing his enemies were rendered harmless, the boy entered the cabin and examined it curiously.  It was dirty and ill-smelling enough, but the corners and spare berths were heaped with merchandise of all kinds which had been taken from those so unlucky as to have met these cruel and desperate men.  After a short inspection of the place he returned to the deck and again seated himself in the bow.  The crippled condition of his traveling machine was now his chief trouble, and although a good breeze had sprung up to fill the sails and the little bark was making fair headway, Rob knew he could never expect to reach home unless he could discover a better mode of conveyance than this.  He unstrapped the machine from his wrist to examine it better, and while holding it carelessly in his hand it slipped and fell with a bang to the deck, striking upon its round edge and rolling quickly past the cabin and out of sight.  With a cry of alarm he ran after it, and after much search found it lying against the bulwark near the edge of a scupper hole, where the least jar of the ship would have sent it to the bottom of the ocean.  Rob hastily seized his treasure and upon examining it found the fall had bulged the rim so that the old dents scarcely showed at all.  But its original shape was more distorted than ever, and Rob feared he had utterly ruined its delicate mechanism. Should this prove to be true, he might now consider himself a prisoner of this piratical band, the members of which, although temporarily disabled, would soon regain consciousness.  He sat in the bow, sadly thinking of his misfortunes, until he noticed that one of the men began to stir.  The effect of the electric shock conveyed by the tube was beginning to wear away, and now the buccaneer sat up, rubbed his head in a bewildered fashion and looked around him. When he saw Rob he gave a shout of rage and drew his knife, but one motion of the electric tube made him cringe and slip away to the cabin, where he remained out of danger.  And now the other four sat up, groaning and muttering in their outlandish speech;  But they had no notion of facing Rob's tube a second time, so one by one they joined their leader in the cabin, leaving the boy undisturbed.  By this time the ship had begun to pitch and toss in an uncomfortable fashion, and Rob noticed that the breeze had increased to a gale. There being no one to look after the sails, the vessel was in grave danger of capsizing or breaking her masts.  The waves were now running high, too, and Rob began to be worried.  Presently the captain of the pirates stuck his head out of the cabin door, jabbered some unintelligible words and pointed to the sails.  The boy nodded, for he understood they wanted to attend to the rigging.  So the crew trooped forth, rather fearfully, and began to reef the sails and put the ship into condition to weather the storm.  Rob paid no further attention to them.  He looked at his traveling machine rather doubtfully and wondered if he dared risk its power to carry him through the air.  Whether he remained in the ship or trusted to the machine, he stood a good chance of dropping into the sea at any moment.  So, while he hesitated, he attached the machine to his wrist and leaned over the bulwarks to watch the progress of the storm.  He might stay in the ship until it foundered, he thought, and then take his chances with the machine.  He decided to wait until a climax arrived.  The climax came the next moment, for while he leaned over the bulwarks the buccaneers stole up behind him and suddenly seized him in their grasp.  While two of them held his arms the others searched his pockets, taking from him the electric tube and the silver box containing his tablets.  These they carried to the cabin and threw upon the heap of other valuables they had stolen.  They did not notice his traveling machine, however, but seeing him now unarmed they began jeering and laughing at him, while the brutal captain relieved his anger by giving the prisoner several malicious kicks.  Rob bore his misfortune meekly, although he was almost ready to cry with grief and disappointment.  But when one of the pirates, to inflict further punishment on the boy, came towards him with a heavy strap, he resolved not to await the blow.  Turning the indicator to the word \"up\" he found, to his joy and relief, that it would yet obey the influence of the power of repulsion.  Seeing him rise into the air the fellow made a grab for his foot and held it firmly, while his companions ran to help him.  Weight seemed to make no difference in the machine; it lifted the pirate as well as Rob; it lifted another who clung to the first man's leg, and another who clung to him.  The other two also caught hold, hoping their united strength would pull him down, and the next minute Rob was soaring through the air with the entire string of five buccaneers dangling from his left leg.  At first the villains were"]]]
