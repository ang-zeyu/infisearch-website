Well—” She took a long breath. “Here we go up Fortune’s ladder. Wish you luck.”  “Same to you.” Then up they went.                    *       *       *       *       *  In the meantime the big girl, Barbara, opened her bag, shook out her clothes, packed some away in a drawer, hung others up, then dropped into a chair for a few long, long thoughts. The truth was at that moment she wished she hadn’t come.  She thought of the steam laundry where she had worked for three years. All the girls laughing and talking, the fine clean smell of sheets as they ran through the mangle, the rattle and clank of machines and the slap of flat-irons—it all came to her with a rush.  “It’s all so strange here—” she whispered. “Go down the ladder, that’s what she said. What ladder, I wonder?”  Then she jumped up. She would have to get out of here, begin to face things. What things? Just any things. If you faced them, they lost their terror. They stepped to one side and let you by.  After putting on her hat and coat, she opened the door to stand there for a moment. Truth was, she was looking for the ladder.  “Hi, there!” came in a cheery voice as a girl in a natty blue suit and jaunty hat rounded a corner in the hall. “You’re one of the new ones, aren’t you? Close the hatch and let’s get down the ladder for a coke at the USO.”  “The ha-hatch?” Barbara faltered. “What’s a hatch and where’s the ladder?”  “Right down—oh!” the girl in blue broke off. “I forgot. Of course you wouldn’t know. You see, we are WAVES, you and I—”  “Yes, I—”  “So this place we live in is a ship, at least we say it is. This is not the second floor but the second deck. The door is a hatch, the walls bulkheads and, of course, the stairway is a ladder.”  “Oh!” Barbara beamed. “That’s the way it is!”                    *       *       *       *       *  Of course Sally and Nancy had not boarded a ship for their interview. The “U.S.S. Mary Sacks” was a two story building turned over by the college to the WAVES. And it was up a stairs, not a real ladder, that the two girls climbed. It was all a part of the program that was to turn girls from all walks of life into sailors.  “Your name is Sally Scott?” said a girl in a WAVES uniform.  “That’s right,” said Sally.  “Come into my parlor,” the girl said, smiling, broadly and indicating a small booth furnished with two chairs and a narrow table.  “‘Said the spider to the fly.’” Sally returned the smile as she finished the quotation..  “Oh! It’s not nearly as bad as that,” said the blonde examiner. “The fly did not escape. You will, I am sure.”  “Six months after the war is over.” Sally did not smile.  “Yes, that sounds a bit serious, doesn’t it?”  “It certainly does,” Sally agreed.  “It’s nice to have a sense of humor and also a serious side,” said the examiner. “We like them that way. You should get on well.”  “Thanks. I’m glad you think so.”  “My name is Marjory Mills. I won’t keep you long, at least not longer than you wish to stay.” Ensign Mills motioned Sally to a chair.  “By the way,” she said as she dropped into the opposite chair, “why did you want to join the WAVES?”  “It’s our war. We’re all in it. I hate the way the people of France, Belgium, and all the rest are treated. They’re slaves. They’ve got to be freed.”  “Yes, of course.”  “I’ve three cousins in the war. We were great pals. All the boys of our crowd are gone, and some of the girls.”  “Lonesome? Is that it?”  “No, not entirely. I want them to come back, never wanted anything quite so much. They can’t come back until we’ve done all we can to help them.”  “That’s true,” Ensign Mills spoke quietly. “You’re sure that it wasn’t romance, love of excitement, the desire to go places and see things that brought you here?”  Sally looked into the other girl’s eyes, then said:  “Yes, of course it was, in part. No one motive ever draws us into making a great decision, at least not often. Of course I dream of romance, adventure, and travel. Who doesn’t?”  “We all do,” Marjory Mills agreed frankly. “The only thing is, those can’t be our main motives. If they were we should meet disappointment and perhaps miserably fail. ‘Blood, sweat, and tears.’ That is what we have ahead of us.”  “Yes,” Sally replied soberly. “I know. My father has told me. He was in France for more than a year.”  “In the last war? Yes, then you would know. We like to have daughters of veterans. Some of them are among our best. And now,” Marjory Mills’s voice was brisk again. “What do you think you’d like to do? Or, first, would you like to tell me your story?”  “I’d love to. How much time have I?” Sally looked at her watch.  “As much as you like.” Ensign Mills settled back in her chair. “Shoot!”                                   CHAPTER TWO                           THE RADIO FROM THE SKY   “I grew up, as every child must,” Sally began. “Until I was fifteen we weren’t rich, not terribly poor either so—”  “Middle class,” the examiner murmured. “Best people in the world.”  “And then something happened,” Sally announced.  “What was that?”  “I was in a meadow looking for a meadowlark’s nest when a radio fell from the sky.”  “You wouldn’t by any chance be kidding me—” Marjory Mills’s eyes opened wide.  “No—” Sally sat up straight. “No, I wouldn’t. It wasn’t a big radio, only a tiny one.”  “How far did it fall?”  “About seventy thousand feet.”  “Only about fourteen miles. Not much of a tumble after all.” Once again Marjory Mills’s eyes were wide.  “It didn’t hit the ground very hard. It wasn’t broken.”  [Illustration: Ensign Mills Interviewed Sally]  “No, I suppose not.”  “Well, it wasn’t.” Sally talked rapidly. “It was attached to what was left of a large, paper balloon. As it went up, taking the radio with it, the balloon expanded. It got larger and larger. At seventy thousand feet the balloon burst and the radio came down.”  “I see,” said Marjory Mills.  “No—you don’t see. At least, I’m quite sure you don’t.” Sally half apologized. “The radio had been sent up by a very nice old man who wanted to know about the weather. As it went up, the radio, a sending set, broadcast certain information about the weather. Don’t ask me how because I don’t know all about that. All I knew at the time was that attached to the radio was a card and on the card was written: ‘If the finder of this radio will return it to C. K. Kennedy at Ferndale he will receive a five dollar reward!’”  “And you needed a new spring dress, so you returned the radio.”  “Exactly! How did you ever guess that?” They joined in a merry laugh.  “But I’m not joking.” Sally’s face sobered. “It’s every bit true.”  “Of course,” was the quick response. “Tell me the rest.”  “Well, you know, that nice old man, C. K. Kennedy, had lived in my own town for three years and I’d never heard of him. He owned a tiny house down by the river. Back of the house was his shop, where he invented things.”  “Oh! Then he was an inventor!”  “Sure he is! When I brought him the radio I asked him why he sent it up into the sky. He told me all about it, how he could learn all sorts of things about how cold it would be, when it would rain, and all that just by sending up radios to listen in for him.  “That’s the way it started.” Sally heaved a sigh. “Old C. K.—everyone called him that and I never knew his first name—he was so kind and told me so much that I went back again, lots of times.  “By and by I started helping him. Just doing little things. I told people how good he was with radios and they started bringing them to be fixed. We came to have quite a business. As soon as high school was over I worked there all the time.”  “You must have made quite a lot of money.”  “Oh, no, not so much. You see,” Sally leaned forward, “we were like some very fine surgeons. We charged what people could afford to pay.”  “I see.”  “And there are lots more poor people than rich ones.”  “Always.”  “When a little lame boy came in with a very cheap radio that got the stations all jumbled up, we put in more transformers and tubes, practically made a new radio out of it. Then it worked fine.”  “And then you charged him—”  “Just a dollar.”  “But when a rich man brought you his big fussy radio that would get Berlin, Tokio, London, and maybe Mars, you charged him—”  “Plenty!” Sally laughed.  “Yes, your old C. K. must have been a fine man, but what about the inventions?”  “Oh, that—” Sally frowned. “He’s such a sensitive old man, C. K. is. We invented something quite wonderful—that is, _he_ did. That was quite a while ago. I didn’t know much about it but we could ride about at night in his rattly old car, and every now and then he’d stop and say: ‘See! Some young fellow off there is operating a sending radio.’ We could have driven right up to his door if we wanted to, but we never did.”  “It was a radio-spotter!”  “Yes, and C. K. said it was the best one ever made.”  “What came of it?”  “Nothing. You see, C. K. was very fond of his country. He thought Uncle Sam should have his invention. So Mother and I fixed him up the best we could—he just wasn’t interested in clothes—and we sent him off to Washington. And,” Sally sighed deeply, “he just couldn’t stand waiting. They kept him waiting three days. Then, because he was old and a little bit shabby they thought he didn’t know much, so—”  “So nothing came of it?”  “Just nothing. C. K. came back discouraged and downhearted, but pretty soon we were working as hard as ever. And now,” Sally’s eyes shone, “you just ought to see—”  The light in Sally’s eyes faded. Just in time she caught herself. She had been about to betray the secret of the black box up there in her room.  “I—I can’t tell you,” she apologized. “I just must not. It’s his secret.”  “Of course. That’s all right,”"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44813"],["title","Sally Scott of the WAVES (#2)"],["body","Mills agreed. “That really doesn’t matter. The only thing that matters just now is, how do you fit in with the WAVES?”  “Yes—yes—that’s it.” Sally leaned forward, eager and alert.  “I’ll just go down our little list,” Marjory Mills smiled. “You can tell me which category you’d like to try for the sixty-four dollar question. Now, listen carefully and tell me when to stop. Here they are: Secretarial Work, Typing, Bookkeeping, Aviation Ground Work, Parachute Rigging, Operating a Link Trainer—” To all this Sally shook her head. But when the examiner read, “Communication, including radio,” she sat up with a start to exclaim:  “That’s it!”  “Yes,” Marjory Mills agreed. “That, beyond a doubt, is it. Ultimately you’ll go to a special school for perfecting your training. You’ll need to know about sending and receiving in code, blinker signaling, flag signaling, and a lot more.  “But first,” she settled back in her chair, “you’ll have to stay right here in Mt. Morris College, learning; for the most part, things that have nothing to do with communication.”  “Oh, must I?” Sally cried in sudden dismay.  “You’ll love it.” Marjory Mills’s words carried conviction. “When it’s all over you’ll agree, I’m sure, that we’ve made a real sailor out of you and that you would not have missed it for anything.”  “And after that, special school?” Sally asked eagerly.  “After that perhaps you’ll find yourself in an airplane directing tower, saying to the pilots of great Flying Fortresses: ‘Come in, forty-three. All right, sixty-four, you’re off’, and things like that. Thrilling, what?”  “Wonderful, and after that perhaps I’ll be on some small airplane carrier in a convoy crossing the Atlantic.”  “Yes, just perhaps. There is a law before Congress now which, if passed, will permit us to send WAVES on sea voyages and to service overseas. The WACS are already there.”  “Oh! Congress must pass that law.” Sally half rose in her chair. Again she was thinking of her secret in the black box. “They just must pass that law.”  “Don’t hope too much,” the examiner warned. “‘Ours not to reason why—’”  “‘Ours but to do or die’,” Sally finished in a whisper.  And so her interview came to an end.                    *       *       *       *       *  In the meantime Nancy McBride was going through her examination with much the same result. She too was a radio bug. She and her lame brother had been radio hams since she was a dozen years old. Though she had lived in another small city, she and Sally had been good friends for some time. That was why Sally had dared trust her with C. K.’s secret and one of her much treasured black boxes.  “Oh!” she had exclaimed on seeing Nancy on the train that carried her to Mt. Morris and her new home. “You’re really going to be a WAVE!”  “Surest thing!” Nancy had thrown her arms about her. “And you, too!”  “That’s right,” Sally agreed. “Oh, boy!” she had whispered when they had found a seat together. “Do you take the load off my mind!”  “Why? How come?” Nancy demanded in great surprise.  “Shush, it’s a secret.” Sally’s voice dropped to a whisper. “It’s a deep secret. You know old C. K.?”  “Yes, of course. He’s given Bob—that’s my brother, you know—and me a lot of fine suggestions.”  “Well, he and I have been working on something for weeks and weeks. It’s a lot too deep for me, but it’s a radio that works with wave-lengths shorter than any that have been used yet. You know what that might mean?”  “Yes, I—I guess so. You could send messages to someone having the same sort of radio and no one else could hear them.”  “Not a soul.”  “Wonderful! Did you get it worked out?”  “Yes, only a few days before I was to leave, I took one portable radio to a place twenty miles away and talked to C. K. back there in his shop. We could hear each other plainly. That was a great day for C. K.”  “And for you.”  “Yes, but a greater one came when he took me into his shop that day before I left and said: ‘Sally, I want you to take these two black boxes with you.’”  “‘But, C. K.,’ I said, ‘those are your two secret, secret radios, your choicest possessions!’  “‘I can make more of them.’ That’s what he said. Then he went on, ‘Once I tried to give one of my inventions to our country. I failed and later someone stole it from me. Now, Sally, it’s your turn—’”  “How strange!” Nancy whispered. “What did he mean?”  “That’s what I asked him,” Sally whispered excitedly. “He said I was to take these radios with me, that I was to get someone who could be trusted to help me and, as I found time, to test the radios, listen in for any other radios that might be using those wave-lengths, do all I could to see what could be accomplished with them to aid our country.”  “That,” Nancy said, “is the strangest thing I ever heard.”  “Not so strange after all,” Sally said soberly. “He knew I was going first to a school close to the sea where I might listen for messages. Then, too, I am to be a WAVE. Perhaps I shall travel in a convoy across the sea. What a chance that will be to try out the radios!”  “Yes, what a chance!”  “Nancy,” Sally whispered tensely, “will you be the one who can be trusted? Will you join me in testing C. K.’s radios?”  “Why, I—” Nancy hesitated. “Yes! Yes, I will. You are my friend. C. K. is my friend. I also love America, and want to help, so why not?”  And that is how it came about that, as they walked slowly back to their staterooms on a ship that was a ship in name only, Sally and Nancy talked of radio and of the day when they would be full-fledged WAVES serving their country.  “And here’s hoping they put us on an honest-to-goodness ship!” Sally exclaimed.  “Here’s hoping,” Nancy echoed.                                  CHAPTER THREE                             A MESSAGE IN CODE   In the meantime, with a worried look still on her face, Barbara sat at a small table drinking hot chocolate while her companion, in the chic blue WAVES suit, enjoyed a coke.  “Hot chocolate will make you fat,” said Belle Mason, Barbara’s new friend.  “I’m fat already,” Barbara smiled. “An even hundred and fifty.”  “You’re big, not fat,” her companion corrected. “That’s not a bad weight at all for your height. What are you to do for the WAVES?”  “That’s just it.” Barbara’s frown deepened. “I don’t know much about anything but cooking, housework, and laundry.”  “Home laundry?”  “No, steam laundry. I know you’ll think I was silly, but just out of high-school I went into a laundry to work. I’ve never done anything else.”  “You liked it, of course, or you wouldn’t have stayed.”  “Yes, I like the nice, clean smell of the shiny white sheets and pillow cases, and the cozy, warm feeling of everything. I like to run the sheets through the mangle, fold them just right, then run them through again. I like to stack them up, just right, in clean white piles.  “Oh, I guess I’m hopeless,” Barbara sighed. “Just an old hag of a laundry worker. What can the WAVES do with a creature like that?”  “You’ll be just wonderful!” her companion beamed.  “Won-wonderful!” Barbara stared.  “Sure! They’ll make a parachute rigger out of you.”  “Parachute rigger? What’s that?”  “You know that all fighting airmen wear parachutes, don’t you?”  “Yes, of course!”  “And that those parachutes often save their lives, in fact, have already saved thousands of lives?”  “Yes, but—”  “Parachutes don’t just grow on trees like walnuts. They have to be made with great care and arranged with greater care. The rigger is the one who packs them into their bags.”  “Oh! I’d love that!”  “Sure you would. And it’s a tremendously important job. One slip is all it takes. If a parachute is folded wrong, some fine fellow comes shooting down, down, thousands of feet to his death. But you—you love to do things just right, even bed sheets.”  “Yes, I do.”  “Then you’ll be the best there is. Good parachute riggers are hard to get. Of course,” Belle went on, “you don’t just fold parachutes and pack them. You select large ones for large people.”  “And small ones for small people!”  “Sure! In some of them you pack iron rations, food for a day or so. In others you’ll put light pneumatic rubber rafts and fishing line—that’s in case the flier might land in the sea.  “Then, of course, there are paper balloons to be rigged for dropping food and medicine, and small silk ones for dogs.”  “Dogs?”  “Yes, of course, the dogs of war.”  “Real dogs?”  “Certainly! Dogs have played an important part in all wars. They carry messages, keep the night watches, and warn their masters of approaching enemies. Yes, they have their parachutes, and many of them beg to have their chutes strapped on.”  “Do they really like dropping from the sky?”  “Oh, don’t they, though? And that reminds me. I don’t want to frighten you but, because of the great importance of their work, and so they will realize to the full just how important it is, there is talk of having each parachute rigger make at least one parachute landing.”  “What! You mean—” Barbara appeared to shrink up in her chair. “You mean I’ll have to drop from way up in the sky?”  “You might be asked to.”  “I’d die.” Barbara’s face paled.  “Oh, no you wouldn’t. Thousands are doing it every day.”  “I’m so big, I’d go right on down into the earth.” Barbara laughed, nervously.  “Oh, no! Parachutes are made to fit their owners. Some are made for dropping five hundred pound antiaircraft guns. But don’t let that worry you,” Belle hastened to add. “You may never be asked to jump. ‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.’ I didn’t think that up, but it’s good all the same.”  “One thing still worries me—” Barbara said a moment later.  “What’s that?”  “My interview. My roommate just went to take hers.”  “You may forget that.” Belle smiled an odd smile. “You’ve practically had yours already.”  “I? Had mine?”  [Illustration: You Mean I’ll Have To Drop From the Sky?]  “Sure. I’m one of the examiners. This is my hour off. When your time comes, just ask to be examined by Ensign Belle Mason.
