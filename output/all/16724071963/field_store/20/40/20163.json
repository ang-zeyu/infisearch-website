But that, I confess, is an illustration altogether out of place, and I'll simply jot it down in my notebook.\"  Agostino had talked on to let her gain confidence.  When he was silent she sang from memory.  It was a song of flourishes: one of those be- flowered arias in which the notes flicker and leap like young flames. Others might have sung it; and though it spoke favourably of her aptitude and musical education, and was of a quality to enrapture easy, merely critical audiences, it won no applause from these men.  The effect produced by it was exhibited in the placid tolerance shown by the uplifting of Ugo Corte's eyebrows, which said, \"Well, here's a voice, certainly.\" His subsequent look added, \"Is this what we have come hither to hear?\"  Vittoria saw the look.  \"Am I on my trial before you?\" she thought; and the thought nerved her throat.  She sang in strong and grave contralto tones, at first with shut eyes.  The sense of hostility left her, and left her soul free, and she raised them.  The song was of Camilla dying. She pardons the treacherous hand, commending her memory and the strength of her faith to her husband:--           \"Beloved, I am quickly out of sight:           I pray that you will love more than my dust.            Were death defeat, much weeping would be right;           'Tis victory when it leaves surviving trust.           You will not find me save when you forget           Earth's feebleness, and come to faith, my friend,           For all Humanity doth owe a debt           To all Humanity, until the end.\"  Agostino glanced at the Chief to see whether his ear had caught note of his own language.  The melancholy severity of that song of death changed to a song of prophetic triumph.  The signorina stood up.  Camilla has thrown off the mask, and has sung the name \"Italia!\"  At the recurrence of it the men rose likewise.            \"Italia, Italia, shall be free!\"  Vittoria gave the inspiration of a dying voice: the conquest of death by an eternal truth seemed to radiate from her.  Voice and features were as one expression of a rapture of belief built upon pathetic trustfulness.            \"Italia, Italia shall be free!\"  She seized the hearts of those hard and serious men as a wind takes the strong oak-trees, and rocks them on their knotted roots, and leaves them with the song of soaring among their branches.  Italy shone about her; the lake, the plains, the peaks, and the shouldering flushed snowridges. Carlo Ammiani breathed as one who draws in fire.  Grizzled Agostino glittered with suppressed emotion, like a frosted thorn-bush in the sunlight.  Ugo Corte had his thick brows down, as a man who is reading iron matter.  The Chief alone showed no sign beyond a half lifting of the hand, and a most luminous fixed observation of the fair young woman, from whom power was an emanation, free of effort.  The gaze was sad in its thoughtfulness, such as our feelings translate of the light of evening.  She ceased, and he said, \"You sing on the night of the fifteenth?\"  \"I do, signore.\"  \"It is your first appearance?\"  She bent her head.  \"And you will be prepared on that night to sing this song?\"  \"Yes, signore.\"  \"Save in the event of your being forbidden?\"  \"Unless you shall forbid me, I will sing it, signore.\"  \"Should they imprison you?--\"  \"If they shoot me I shall be satisfied to know that I have sung a song that cannot be forgotten.\"  The Chief took her hand in a gentle grasp.  \"Such as you will help to give our Italy freedom.  You hold the sacred flame, and know you hold it in trust.\"  \"Friends,\"--he turned to his companions,--\"you have heard what will be the signal for Milan.\"     CHAPTER IV  It was a surprise to all of them, save to Agostino Balderini, who passed his inspecting glance from face to face, marking the effect of the announcement.  Corte gazed at her heavily, but not altogether disapprovingly.  Giulio Bandinelli and Marco Sana, though evidently astonished, and to some extent incredulous, listened like the perfectly trusty lieutenants in an enterprise which they were.  But Carlo Ammiani stood horror-stricken.  The blood had left his handsome young olive-hued face, and his eyes were on the signorina, large with amazement, from which they deepened to piteousness of entreaty.  \"Signorina!--you!  Can it be true?  Do you know?--do you mean it?\"  \"What, signor Carlo?\"  \"This; will you venture to do such a thing?\"  \"Oh, will I venture?  What can you think of me?  It is my own request.\"  \"But, signorina, in mercy, listen and consider.\"  Carlo turned impetuously to the Chief.  \"The signorina can't know the danger she is running.  She will be seized on the boards, and shut up between four walls before a man of us will be ready,--or more than one,\" he added softly.  \"The house is sure to be packed for a first night; and the Polizia have a suspicion of her.  She has been off her guard in the Conservatorio; she has talked of a country called Italy; she has been indiscreet;--pardon, pardon, signorina! but it is true that she has spoken out from her noble heart.  And this opera!  Are they fools?--they must see through it.  It will never,--it can't possibly be reckoned on to appear.  I knew that the signorina was heart and soul with us; but who could guess that her object was to sacrifice herself in the front rank,-- to lead a forlorn hope!  I tell you it's like a Pagan rite.  You are positively slaying a victim.  I beg you all to look at the case calmly!\"  A burst of laughter checked him; for his seniors by many years could not hear such veteran's counsel from a hurried boy without being shrewdly touched by the humour of it, while one or two threw a particular irony into their tones.  \"When we do slay a victim, we will come to you as our augur, my Carlo,\" said Agostino.  Corte was less gentle.  As a Milanese and a mere youth Ammiani was antipathetic to Corte, who closed his laughter with a windy rattle of his lips, and a \"pish!\" of some emphasis.  Carlo was quick to give him a challenging frown.  \"What is it?\"  Corte bent his head back, as if inquiringly.  \"It's I who claim that question by right,\" said Carlo.  \"You are a boy.\"  \"I have studied war.\"  \"In books.\"  \"With brains, Colonel Corte.\"  \"War is a matter of blows, my little lad.\"  \"Let me inform you, signor Colonel, that war is not a game between bulls, to be played with the horns of the head.\"  \"You are prepared to instruct me?\"  The fiery Bergamasc lifted his eyebrows.  \"Nay, nay!\" said Agostino.  \"Between us two first;\" and he grasped Carlo's arm, saying in an underbreath, \"Your last retort was too long- winded.  In these conflicts you must be quick, sharp as a rifle-crack that hits echo on the breast-bone and makes her cry out.  I correct a student in the art of war.\"  Then aloud: \"My opera, young man!--well, it's my libretto, and you know we writers always say 'my opera' when we have put the pegs for the voice; you are certainly aware that we do.  How dare you to make calumnious observations upon my opera?  Is it not the ripe and admirable fruit of five years of confinement?  Are not the lines sharp, the stanzas solid? and the stuff, is it not good?  Is not the subject simple, pure from offence to sensitive authority, constitutionally harmless?  Reply!\"  \"It's transparent to any but asses,\" said Carlo.  \"But if it has passed the censorship?  You are guilty, my boy, of bestowing upon those highly disciplined gentlemen who govern your famous city--what title?  I trust a prophetic one, since that it comes from an animal whose custom is to turn its back before it delivers a blow, and is, they remark, fonder of encountering dead lions than live ones. Still, it is you who are indiscreet,--eminently so, I must add, if you will look lofty.  If my opera has passed the censorship! eh, what have you to say?\"  Carlo endured this banter till the end of it came.  \"And you--you encourage her!\" he cried wrathfully.  \"You know what the danger is for her, if they once lay hands on her.  They will have her in Verona in four-and-twenty hours; through the gates of the Adige in a couple of days, and at Spielberg, or some other of their infernal dens of groans, within a week.  Where is the chance of a rescue then?  They torture, too, they torture!  It's a woman; and insult will be one mode of torturing her.  They can use rods--\"  The excited Southern youth was about to cover his face, but caught back his hands, clenching them.  \"All this,\" said Agostino, \"is an evasion, manifestly, of the question concerning my opera, on which you have thought proper to cast a slur. The phrase, 'transparent to any but asses,' may not be absolutely objectionable, for transparency is, as the critics rightly insist, meritorious in a composition.  And, according to the other view, if we desire our clever opponents to see nothing in something, it is notably skilful to let them see through it.  You perceive, my Carlo. Transparency, then, deserves favourable comment.  So, I do not complain of your phrase, but I had the unfortunate privilege of hearing it uttered.  The method of delivery scarcely conveyed a compliment.  Will you apologize?\"  Carlo burst from him with a vehement question to the Chief: \"Is it decided?\"  \"It is, my friend,\" was the reply.  \"Decided! She is doomed!  Signorina! what can you know of this frightful risk?  You are going to the slaughter.  You will be seized before the first verse is out of your lips, and once in their clutches, you will never breathe free air again.  It's madness!--ah, forgive me!--yes, madness! For you shut your eyes; you rush into the trap blindfolded.  And that is how you serve our Italy!  She sees you an instant, and you are caught away;--and you who might serve her, if you would, do you think you can move dungeon walls?\"  \"Perhap"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4435"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 1 (#6)"],["body","s, if I have been once seen, I shall not be forgotten,\" said the signorina smoothly, and then cast her eyes down, as if she felt the burden of a little possible accusation of vanity in this remark.  She raised them with fire.  \"No; never!\" exclaimed Carlo.  \"But, now you are ours.  And--surely it is not quite decided?\"  He had spoken imploringly to the Chief.  \"Not irrevocably?\" he added.  \"Irrevocably!\"  \"Then she is lost!\"  \"For shame, Carlo Ammiani;\" said old Agostino, casting his sententious humours aside.  \"Do you not hear?  It is decided!  Do you wish to rob her of her courage, and see her tremble?  It's her scheme and mine: a case where an old head approves a young one.  The Chief says Yes! and you bellow still!  Is it a Milanese trick?  Be silent.\"  \"Be silent!\" echoed Carlo.  \"Do you remember the beast Marschatska's bet?\"  The allusion was to a black incident concerning a young Italian ballet girl who had been carried off by an Austrian officer, under the pretext of her complicity in one of the antecedent conspiracies.  \"He rendered payment for it,\" said Agostino.  \"He perished; yes! as we shake dust to the winds; but she!--it's terrible!  You place women in the front ranks--girls!  What can defenceless creatures do?  Would you let the van-regiment in battle be the one without weapons?  It's slaughter.  She's like a lamb to them. You hold up your jewel to the enemy, and cry, 'Come and take it.'  Think of the insults! think of the rough hands, and foul mouths!  She will be seized on the boards--\"  \"Not if you keep your tongue from wagging,\" interposed Ugo Corte, fevered by this unseasonable exhibition of what was to him manifestly a lover's frenzied selfishness.  He moved off, indifferent to Carlo's retort. Marco Sana and Giulio Bandinelli were already talking aside with the Chief.  \"Signor Carlo, not a hand shall touch me,\" said the signorina.  \"And I am not a lamb, though it is good of you to think me one.  I passed through the streets of Milan in the last rising.  I was unharmed.  You must have some confidence in me.\"  \"Signorina, there's the danger,\" rejoined Carlo.  \"You trust to your good angels once, twice--the third time they fail you!  What are you among a host of armed savages?  You would be tossed like weed on the sea.  In pity, do not look so scornfully!  No, there is no unjust meaning in it; but you despise me for seeing danger.  Can nothing persuade you?  And, besides,\" he addressed the Chief, who alone betrayed no signs of weariness; \"listen, I beg of you.  Milan wants no more than a signal. She does not require to be excited.  I came charged with several proposals for giving the alarm.  Attend, you others!  The night of the Fifteenth comes; it is passing like an ordinary night.  At twelve a fire- balloon is seen in the sky.  Listen, in the name of saints and devils!\"  But even the Chief was observed to show signs of amusement, and the gravity of the rest forsook them altogether at the display of this profound and original conspiratorial notion.  \"Excellent! excellent! my Carlo,\" said old Agostino, cheerfully.  \"You have thought.  You must have thought, or whence such a conception?  But, you really mistake.  It is not the garrison whom we desire to put on their guard.  By no means.  We are not in the Imperial pay.  Probably your balloon is to burst in due time, and, wind permitting, disperse printed papers all over the city?\"  \"What if it is?\" cried Carlo fiercely.  \"Exactly.  I have divined your idea.  You have thought, or, to correct the tense, are thinking, which is more hopeful, though it may chance not to seem so meritorious.  But, if yours are the ideas of full-blown jackets, bear in mind that our enemies are coated and breeched.  It may be creditable to you that your cunning is not the cunning of the serpent; to us it would be more valuable if it were.  Continue.\"  \"Oh! there are a thousand ways.\" Carlo controlled himself with a sharp screw of all his muscles.  \"I simply wish to save the signorina from an annoyance.\"  \"Very mildly put,\" Agostino murmured assentingly.  \"In our Journal,\" said Carlo, holding out the palm of one hand to dot the forefinger of the other across it, by way of personal illustration--\"in our Journal we might arrange for certain letters to recur at distinct intervals in Roman capitals, which might spell out, 'This Night AT Twelve,' or 'At Once.'\"  \"Quite as ingenious, but on the present occasion erring on the side of intricacy.  Aha! you want to increase the sale of your Journal, do you, my boy?  The rogue!\"  With which, and a light slap over Carlo's shoulder, Agostino left him.  The aspect of his own futile proposals stared the young man in the face too forcibly for him to nurse the spark of resentment which was struck out in the turmoil of his bosom.  He veered, as if to follow Agostino, and remained midway, his chest heaving, and his eyelids shut.  \"Signor Carlo, I have not thanked you.\"  He heard Vittoria speak.  \"I know that a woman should never attempt to do men's work.  The Chief will tell you that we must all serve now, and all do our best.  If we fail, and they put me to great indignity, I promise you that I will not live. I would give this up to be done by anyone else who could do it better. It is in my hands, and my friends must encourage me.\"  \"Ah, signorina!\" the young man sighed bitterly.  The knowledge that he had already betrayed himself in the presence of others too far, and the sob in his throat labouring to escape, kept him still.  A warning call from Ugo Corte drew their attention.  Close by the chalet where the first climbers of the mountain had refreshed themselves, Beppo was seen struggling to secure the arms of a man in a high-crowned green Swiss hat, who was apparently disposed to give the signorina's faithful servant some trouble.  After gazing a minute at this singular contention, she cried--  \"It's the same who follows me everywhere!\"  \"And you will not believe you are suspected,\" murmured Carlo in her ear.  \"A spy?\" Sana queried, showing keen joy at the prospect of scotching such a reptile on the lonely height.  Corte went up to the Chief.  They spoke briefly together, making use of notes and tracings on paper.  The Chief then said \"Adieu\" to the signorina.  It was explained to the rest by Corte that he had a meeting to attend near Pella about noon, and must be in Fobello before midnight.  Thence his way would be to Genoa.  \"So, you are resolved to give another trial to our crowned ex-Carbonaro,\" said Agostino.  \"Without leaving him an initiative this time!\" and the Chief embraced the old man.  \"You know me upon that point.  I cannot trust him.  I do not. But, if we make such a tide in Lombardy that his army must be drawn into it, is such an army to be refused?  First, the tide, my friend!  See to that.\"  \"The king is our instrument!\" cried Carlo Ammiani, brightening.  \"Yes, if we were particularly well skilled in the use of that kind of instrument,\" Agostino muttered.  He stood apart while the Chief said a few words to Carlo, which made the blood play vividly across the visage of the youth.  Carlo tried humbly to expostulate once or twice.  In the end his head was bowed, and he signified a dumb acquiescence.  \"Once more, good-bye.\"  The Chief addressed the signorina in English.  She replied in the same tongue, \"Good-bye,\" tremulously; and passion mounting on it, added--\"Oh! when shall I see you again?\"  \"When Rome is purified to be a fit place for such as you.\"  In another minute he was hidden on the slope of the mountain lying toward Orta.     CHAPTER V  Beppo had effected a firm capture of his man some way down the slope. But it was a case of check that entirely precluded his own free movements.  They hung together intertwisted in the characters of specious pacificator and appealing citizen, both breathless.  \"There! you want to hand me up neatly; I know your vanity, my Beppo; and you don't even know my name,\" said the prisoner.  \"I know your ferret of a face well enough,\" said Beppo.  \"You dog the signorina.  Come up, and don't give trouble.\"  \"Am I not a sheep?  You worry me.  Let me go.\"  \"You're a wriggling eel.\"  \"Catch me fast by the tail then, and don't hold me by the middle.\"  \"You want frightening, my pretty fellow!\"  \"If that's true, my Beppo, somebody made a mistake in sending you to do it.  Stop a moment.  You're blown.  I think you gulp down your minestra too hot; you drink beer.\"  \"You dog the signorina!  I swore to scotch you at last.\"  \"I left Milan for the purpose--don't you see?  Act fairly, my Beppo, and let us go up to the signorina together decently.\"  \"Ay, ay, my little reptile!  You'll find no Austrians here.  Cry out to them to come to you from Baveno.  If the Motterone grew just one tree! Saints! one would serve.\"  \"Why don't you--fool that you are, my Beppo!--pray to the saints earlier? Trees don't grow from heaven.\"  \"You'll be going there soon, and you'll know better about it.\"  \"Thanks to the Virgin, then, we shall part at some time or other!\"  The struggles between them continued sharply during this exchange of intellectual shots; but hearing Ugo Corte's voice, the prisoner's confident audacity forsook him, and he drew a long tight face like the mask of an admonitory exclamation addressed to himself from within.  \"Stand up straight!\" the soldier's command was uttered.  Even Beppo was amazed to see that the man had lost the power to obey or to speak.  Corte grasped him under the arm-pit.  With the force of his huge fist he swung him round and stretched him out at arm's length, all collar and shanks.  The man hung like a mole from the twig.  Yet, while Beppo poured out the tale of his iniquities, his eyes gave the turn of a twinkle, showing that he could have answered one whom he did not fear.  The charge brought against him was, that for the last six months he had been untiringly spying on the signorina.  Corte stamped his loose feet to earth, shook him and told him to walk aloft.
