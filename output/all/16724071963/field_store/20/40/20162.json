You recognize that dancing speck below there?--he has joined himself--the poor lad wishes he could, I dare swear!--to another bigger speck, which is verily a lady: who has joined herself to a donkey--a common habit of the sex, I am told; but I know them not.  That lady, signor Ugo, is the signorina Vittoria.  You stare?  But, I tell you, the game cannot go on without her; and that is why I have permitted you to knock the ball about at your own pleasure for these forty minutes.\"  Corte drew his under-lip on his reddish stubble moustache.  \"Are we to have women in a conference?\" he asked from eye to eye.  \"Keep to the number, Ugo; and moreover, she is not a woman, but a noble virgin.  I discern a distinction, though you may not.  The Vestal's fire burns straight.\"  \"Who is she?\"  \"It rejoices me that she should be so little known.  All the greater the illumination when her light shines out!  The signorina Vittoria is a cantatrice who is about to appear upon the boards.\"  \"Ah! that completes it.\"  Corte rose to his feet with an air of desperation.  \"We require to be refreshed with quavers and crescendos and trillets!  Who ever knew a singer that cared an inch of flesh for her country?  Money, flowers, flattery, vivas!  but, money! money! and Austrian as good as Italian.  I've seen the accursed wenches bow gratefully for Austrian bouquets:--bow? ay, and more; and when the Austrian came to them red with our blood.  I spit upon their polluted cheeks!  They get us an ill name wherever they go.  These singers have no country.  One--I knew her--betrayed Filippo Mastalone, and sang the night of the day he was shot.  I heard the white demon myself.  I could have taken her long neck till she twisted like a serpent and hissed.  May heaven forgive me for not levelling a pistol at her head! If God, my friends, had put the thought into my brain that night!\"  A flush had deadened Corte's face to the hue of nightshade.  \"You thunder in a clear atmosphere, my Ugo,\" returned the old man, as he fell back calmly at full length.  \"And who is this signorina Vittoria?\" cried Corte.  \"A cantatrice who is about to appear upon the boards, as I have already remarked: of La Scala, let me add, if you hold it necessary.\"  \"And what does she do here?\"  \"Her object in coming, my friend?  Her object in coming is, first, to make her reverence to one who happens to be among us this day; and secondly, but principally, to submit a proposition to him and to us.\"  \"What's her age?\" Corte sneered.  \"According to what calendar would you have it reckoned?  Wisdom would say sixty: Father Chronos might divide that by three, and would get scarce a month in addition, hungry as he is for her, and all of us!  But Minerva's handmaiden has no age.  And now, dear Ugo, you have your opportunity to denounce her as a convicted screecher by night.  Do so.\"  Corte turned his face to the Chief, and they spoke together for some minutes: after which, having had names of noble devoted women, dead and living, cited to him, in answer to brutal bellowings against that sex, and hearing of the damsel under debate as one who was expected and was welcome, he flung himself upon the ground again, inviting calamity by premature resignation.  Giulio Bandinelli stretched his hand for Carlo's glass, and spied the approach of the signorina.  \"Dark,\" he said.  \"A jewel of that complexion,\" added Agostino, by way of comment.  \"She has scorching eyes.\"  \"She may do mischief; she may do mischief; let it be only on the right Side!\"  \"She looks fat.\"  \"She sits doubled up and forward, don't you see, to relieve the poor donkey.  You, my Giulio, would call a swan fat if the neck were not always on the stretch.\"  \"By Bacchus! what a throat she has!\"  \"And well interjected, Giulio!  It runs down like wine, like wine, to the little ebbing and flowing wave!  Away with the glass, my boy!  You must trust to all that's best about you to spy what's within.  She makes me young--young!\"  Agostino waved his hand in the form of a salute to her on the last short ascent.  She acknowledged it gracefully; and talking at intervals to Carlo Ammiani, who footed briskly by her side, she drew by degrees among the eyes fixed on her, some of which were not gentle; but hers were for the Chief, at whose feet, when dismounted by Ammiani's solicitous aid, she would have knelt, had he not seized her by her elbows, and put his lips to her cheek.  \"The signorina Vittoria, gentlemen,\" said Agostino.     CHAPTER III  The old man had introduced her with much of the pride of a father displaying some noble child of his for the first time to admiring friends.  \"She is one of us,\" he pursued; \"a daughter of Italy!  My daughter also; is it not so?\"  He turned to her as for a confirmation.  The signorina pressed his fingers.  She was a little intimidated, and for the moment seemed shy and girlish.  The shade of her broad straw hat partly concealed her vivid features.  \"Now, gentlemen, if you please, the number is complete, and we may proceed to business,\" said Agostino, formally but as he conducted the signorina to place her at the feet of the Chief, she beckoned to her servant, who was holding the animal she had ridden.  He came up to her, and presented himself in something of a military posture of attention to her commands.  These were that he should take the poor brute to water, and then lead him back to Baveno, and do duty in waiting upon her mother. The first injunction was received in a decidedly acquiescent manner.  On hearing the second, which directed his abandonment of his post of immediate watchfulness over her safety, the man flatly objected with a \"Signorina, no.\"  He was a handsome bright-eyed fellow, with a soldier's frame and a smile as broad and beaming as laughter, indicating much of that mixture of acuteness, and simplicity which is a characteristic of the South, and means no more than that the extreme vivacity of the blood exceeds at times that of the brain.  A curious frown of half-amused astonishment hung on the signorina's face.  \"When I tell you to go, Beppo!\"  At once the man threw out his fingers, accompanied by an amazingly voluble delivery of his reasons for this revolt against her authority. Among other things, he spoke of an oath sworn by him to a foreign gentleman, his patron,--for whom, and for whomsoever he loved, he was ready to pour forth his heart's blood,--to the effect that he would never quit her side when she left the roof of her house.  \"You see, Beppo,\" she remonstrated, \"I am among friends.\"  Beppo gave a sweeping bow, but remained firm where he stood.  Ammiani cast a sharp hard look at the man.  \"Do you hear the signorina's orders?\"  \"I hear them, signore.\"  \"Will you obey them?\"  She interposed.  \"He must not hear quick words.  Beppo is only showing his love for his master and for me.  But you are wrong in this case, my Beppo.  You shall give me your protection when I require it; and now, you are sensible, and must understand that it is not wanted.  I tell you to go.\"  Beppo read the eyes of his young mistress.  \"Signorina,\"--he stooped forward mysteriously,--\"signorina, that fellow is in Baveno.  I saw him this morning.\"  \"Good, good.  And now go, my friend.\"  \"The signor Agostino,\" he remarked loudly, to attract the old man; \"the signor Agostino may think proper to advise you.\"  \"The signor Agostino will laugh at nothing that you say to-day, Beppo. You will obey me.  Go at once,\" she repeated, seeing him on tiptoe to gain Agostino's attention.  Beppo knew by her eyes that her ears were locked against him; and, though she spoke softly, there was an imperiousness in her voice not to be disregarded.  He showed plainly by the lost rigidity of his attitude that he was beaten and perplexed.  Further expostulations being disregarded, he turned his head to look at the poor panting beast under his charge, and went slowly up to him: they walked off together, a crest-fallen pair.  \"You have gained the victory, signorina,\" said Ugo Corte.  She replied, smiling, \"My poor Beppo! it's not difficult to get the best of those who love us.\"  \"Ha!\" cried Agostino; \"here is one of their secrets, Carlo.  Take heed of it, my boy.  We shall have queens when kings are fossils, mark me!\"  Ammiani muttered a courtly phrase, whereat Corte yawned in very grim fashion.  The signorina had dropped to the grass, at a short step from the Chief, to whom her face was now seriously given.  In Ammiani's sight she looked a dark Madonna, with the sun shining bright gold through the edges of the summer hat, thrown back from her head.  The full and steady contemplative eyes had taken their fixed expression, after a vanishing affectionate gaze of an instant cast upon Agostino.  Attentive as they were, light played in them like water.  The countenance was vivid in repose.  She leaned slightly forward, clasping the wrist of one hand about her knee, and the sole of one little foot showed from under her dress.  Deliberately, but with no attempt at dramatic impressiveness, the Chief began to speak.  He touched upon the condition of Italy, and the new lilt animating her young men and women.  \"I have heard many good men jeer,\" he said, \"at our taking women to our counsel, accepting their help, and putting a great stake upon their devotion.  You have read history, and you know what women can accomplish.  They may be trained, equally as we are, to venerate the abstract idea of country, and be a sacrifice to it. Without their aid, and the fire of a fresh life being kindled in their bosoms, no country that has lain like ours in the death-trance can revive.  In the death-trance, I say, for Italy does not die!\"  \"True,\" said other voices.  \"We have this belief in the eternal life of our country, and the belief is the life itself.  But let no strong man among us despise the help of women.  I have seen our cause lie desperate, and those who despaired of it were not women.  Women kept the flame alive.  They worship in the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4435"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 1 (#4)"],["body","of the cause.\"  Ammiani's eyes dwelt fervidly upon the signorina.  Her look, which was fastened upon the Chief, expressed a mind that listened to strange matter concerning her very little.  But when the plans for the rising of the Bergamascs and Brescians, the Venetians, the Bolognese, the Milanese, all the principal Northern cities, were recited, with a practical emphasis thrown upon numbers, upon the readiness of the organized bands, the dispositions of the leaders, and the amount of resistance to be expected at the various points indicated for the outbreak, her hands disjoined, and she stretched her fingers to the grass, supporting herself so, while her extended chin and animated features told how eagerly her spirit drank at positive springs, and thirsted for assurance of the coming storm.  \"It is decided that Milan gives the signal,\" said the Chief; and a light, like the reflection of a beacon-fire upon the night, flashed over her.  He was pursuing, when Ugo Corte smote the air with his nervous fingers, crying out passionately, \"Bunglers! are we again to wait for them, and hear that fifteen patriots have stabbed a Croat corporal, and wrestled hotly with a lieutenant of the guard?  I say they are bunglers.  They never mean the thing.  Fifteen!  There were just three Milanese among the last lot--the pick of the city; and the rest were made up of Trentini, and our lads from Bergamo and Brescia; and the order from the Council was, 'Go and do the business!' which means, 'Go and earn your ounce of Austrian lead.'  They went, and we gave fifteen true men for one poor devil of a curst tight blue-leg.  They can play the game on if we give them odds like that.  Milan burns bad powder, and goes off like a drugged pistol.  It's a nest of bunglers, and may it be razed!  We could do without it, and well!  If it were a family failing, should not I too be trusting them?  My brother was one of the fifteen who marched out as targets to try the skill of those hell-plumed Tyrolese: and they did it thoroughly--shot him straight here.\" Corte struck his chest.  \"He gave a jump and a cry.  Was it a viva for Milan?  They swear that it was, and they can't translate from a living mouth, much more from a dead one; but I know my Niccolo better.  I have kissed his lips a thousand times, and I know the poor boy meant, 'Scorn and eternal distrust of such peddling conspirators as these!'  I can deal with traitors, but these flash-in- the-pan plotters--these shaking, jelly-bodied patriots!--trust to them again?  Rather draw lots for another fifteen to bare their breasts and bandage their eyes, and march out in the grey morning, while the stupid Croat corporal goes on smoking his lumpy pipe!  We shall hear that Milan is moving; we shall rise; we shall be hot at it; and the news will come that Milan has merely yawned and turned over to sleep on the other side. Twice she has done this trick, and the garrison there has sent five regiments to finish us--teach us to sleep soundly likewise!  I say, let it be Bergamo; or be it Brescia, if you like; or Venice: she is ready. You trust to Milan, and you are fore-doomed.  I would swear it with this hand in the flames.  She give the signal?  Shut your eyes, cross your hands flat on your breasts: you are dead men if you move.  She lead the way?  Spin on your heels, and you have followed her!\"  Corte had spoken in a thick difficult voice, that seemed to require the aid of his vehement gestures to pour out as it did like a water-pipe in a hurricane of rain.  He ceased, red almost to blackness, and knotted his arms, that were big as the cable of a vessel.  Not a murmur followed his speech.  The word was, given to the Chief, and he resumed:--  \"You have a personal feeling in this case, Ugo.  You have not heard me. I came through Paris.  A rocket will soon shoot up from Paris that will be a signal for Christendom.  The keen French wit is sick of its compromise-king.  All Europe is in convulsions in a few months: to-morrow it may be.  The elements are in the hearts of the people, and nothing will contain them.  We have sown them to reap them.  The sowing asks for persistency; but the reaping demands skill and absolute truthfulness.  We have now one of those occasions coming which are the flowers to be plucked by resolute and worthy hands: they are the tests of our sincerity.  This time now rapidly approaching will try us all, and we must be ready for it.  If we have believed in it, we stand prepared.  If we have conceived our plan of action in purity of heart, we shall be guided to discern the means which may serve us.  You will know speedily what it is that has prompted you to move.  If passion blindfolds you, if you are foiled by a prejudice, I also shall know.  My friend, the nursing of a single antipathy is a presumption that your motive force is personal--whether the thirst for vengeance or some internal union of a hundred indistinct little fits of egoism.  I have seen brave and even noble men fail at the ordeal of such an hour: not fail in courage, not fail in the strength of their desire; that was the misery for them!  They failed because midway they lost the vision to select the right instruments put in our way by heaven.  That vision belongs solely to such as have clean and disciplined hearts.  The hope in the bosom of a man whose fixed star is Humanity becomes a part of his blood, and is extinguished when his blood flows no more.  To conquer him, the principle of life must be conquered.  And he, my friend, will use all, because he serves all.  I need not touch on Milan.\"  The signorina drew in her breath quickly, as if in this abrupt close she had a revelation of the Chief's whole meaning, and was startled by the sudden unveiling of his mastery.  Her hands hung loose; her figure was tremulous.  A murmur from Corte jarred within her like a furious discord, but he had not offended by refusing to disclaim his error, and had simply said in a gruff acquiescent way, \"Proceed.\" Her sensations of surprise at the singular triumph of the Chief made her look curiously into the faces of the other men; but the pronouncing of her name engaged her attention.  \"Your first night is the night of the fifteenth of next month?\"  \"It is, signore,\" she replied, abashed to find herself speaking with him who had so moved her.  \"There is no likelihood of a postponement?\"  \"I am certain, signore, that I shall be ready.\"  \"There are no squabbles of any serious kind among the singers?\"  A soft dimple played for a moment on her lips.  \"I have heard something.\"  \"Among the women?\"  \"Yes, and the men.\"  \"But the men do not concern you?\"  \"No, signore.  Except that the women twist them.\"  Agostino chuckled audibly.  The Chief resumed:  \"You believe, notwithstanding, that all will go well?  The opera will be acted; and you will appear in it?\"  \"Yes, signore.  I know one who has determined on it, and can do it.\"  \"Good.  The opera is Camilla?\"  She was answering with an affirmative, when Agostino broke in,--  \"Camilla!  And honour to whom honour is due!  Let Caesar claim the writing of the libretto, if it be Caesar's!  It has passed the censorship, signed Agostino Balderini--a disaffected person out of Piedmont, rendered tame and fangless by a rigorous imprisonment.  The sources of the tale, O ye grave Signori Tedeschi?  The sources are partly to be traced to a neat little French vaudeville, very sparkling--Camille, or the Husband Asserted; and again to a certain Chronicle that may be mediaeval, may be modern, and is just, as the great Shakespeare would say, 'as you like it.'\"  Agostino recited some mock verses, burlesquing the ordinary libretti, and provoked loud laughter from Carlo Ammiani, who was familiar enough with the run of their nonsense.  \"Camilla is the bride of Camillo.  I give to her all the brains, which is a modern idea, quite!  He does all the mischief, which is possibly mediaeval.  They have both an enemy, which is mediaeval and modern.  None of them know exactly what they are about; so there you have the modern, the mediaeval, and the antique, all in one.  Finally, my friends, Camilla is something for you to digest at leisure.  The censorship swallowed it at a gulp.  Never was bait so handsomely taken!  At present I have the joy of playing my fish.  On the night of the fifteenth I land him. Camilla has a mother.  Do you see?  That mother is reported, is generally conceived, as dead.  Do you see further?  Camilla's first song treats of a dream she has had of that mother.  Our signorina shall not be troubled to favour you with a taste of it, or, by Bacchus and his Indian nymphs, I should speedily behold you jumping like peas in a pan, like trout on a bank!  The earth would be hot under you, verily!  As I was remarking, or meant to be, Camilla and her husband disagree, having agreed to.  'Tis a plot to deceive Count Orso--aha?  You are acquainted with Count Orso!  He is Camilla's antenuptial guardian.  Now you warm to it!  In that condition I leave you.  Perhaps my child here will give you a taste of her voice.  The poetry does much upon reflection, but it has to ripen within you--a matter of time.  Wed this voice to the poetry, and it finds passage 'twixt your ribs, as on the point of a driven blade.  Do I cry the sweetness and the coolness of my melons?  Not I!  Try them.\"  The signorina put her hand out for the scroll he was unfolding, and cast her eyes along bars of music, while Agostino called a \"Silenzio tutti!\" She sang one verse, and stopped for breath.  Between her dismayed breathings she said to the Chief:--  \"Believe me, signore, I can be trusted to sing when the time comes.\"  \"Sing on, my blackbird--my viola!\" said Agostino.  \"We all trust you. Look at Colonel Corte, and take him for Count Orso.  Take me for pretty Camillo.  Take Marco for Michiela; Giulio for Leonardo; Carlo for Cupid. Take the Chief for the audience.  Take him for a frivolous public.  Ah, my Pippo!\" (Agostino laughed aside to him)"]]]
