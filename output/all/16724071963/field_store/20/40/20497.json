And as one advances, there seem to be Canadians everywhere. Here are batteries, skilfully masked.  Here are supplies on their way to the trenches.  And all the time can be seen reliefs and reserves until it is strange to meet anyone not in khaki and without the badge of \"CANADA.\"  The passion for football, which the Canadian has begun to share with his English comrade, abates none of its keenness as he marches nearer to the front.  A spirited match was in progress near our lines not long ago when a distracting succession of \"Weary Willies\" began to distribute themselves not very far from the football ground. The only people who took no notice were the players, and nothing short of a peremptory order from the Provost Marshal brought to an end a game which was somewhat unnecessarily dangerous.  And our men have, of course, made the acquaintance of \"Jack Johnson,\" and without liking him--for he is not likeable--they endure him with as much constancy as brave men need.  Nor, indeed, have our own artillery failed to do more than hold their own.  The gunners inherited from the division which preceded them in the trenches a disagreeable inheritance in the shape of an observation post which had long harassed and menaced our lines by the information which it placed at the disposal of the enemy.  We were so fortunate as to put it out of action in the third round which we fired--a success very welcome as an encouragement, and giving a substantial relief from an unwholesome scrutiny.  Our infantry were not specially engaged in the fighting at Neuve Chapelle, but our artillery played its part in that triumph of artillery science which preceded the British attack, and our men were ready during the whole fight for the order which, had the tactical situation so developed, would have sent them, too, to make their first assault upon the German trenches.  And there were not a few who were longing for that order.  They thought that the Germans had presumed upon a slight acquaintance.  For, the very first night on which our men were put into the trenches, the Germans began to call out, \"Come out, you Canadians!  Come out and fight!\"  Now, the trenches at normal times have their own code of manners and of amenity, and this challenge was, and is, regarded as impertinent.  The Canadian brings his own phrases into his daily life.  When the German flares in the trenches nervously lighted up the space between the two lines, \"There are the Northern Lights\" was the comment of Canada; and \"Northern Lights\" they have remained to this day.  It would be evidently impertinent to say more of the General Officer Commanding the force, General Alderson, than that he enjoys the most absolute confidence of the fine force he commands.  He trusts them, and they trust him; and it will be strange if their co-operation does not prove fruitful.  And an observer is at once struck by the extraordinarily accurate knowledge which the General has gained of the whole body of regimental officers under his command.  He seems to know them as well by name and sight, as if he had commanded the force for six years instead of six months.  And this is a circumstance which, in critical moments, counts for much.  General Alderson's methods--his practical and soldierly style--could not be better illustrated than by some extracts from the speech which he addressed to the troops before they went into the trenches for the first time:--  \"All ranks of the Canadian Division: We are about to occupy and maintain a line of trenches.  I have some things to say to you at this moment which it is well that you should consider.  You are taking over good and, on the whole, dry trenches.  I have visited some myself. They are intact, and the parapets are good.  Let me warn you first that we have already had several casualties while you have been attached to other divisions.  Some of those casualties were unavoidable, and that is war.  But I suspect that some--at least a few--could have been avoided.  I have heard of cases in which men have exposed themselves with no military object, and perhaps only to gratify curiosity.  We cannot lose good men like this.  We shall want them all if we advance, and we shall want them all if the Germans advance.  Do not expose your heads, and do not look round corners, unless for a purpose which is necessary at the moment you do it.  It will not often be necessary. You are provided with means of observing the enemy without exposing your heads.  To lose your lives without military necessity is to deprive the State of good soldiers.  Young and brave men enjoy taking risks.  But a soldier who takes unnecessary risks through levity, is not playing the game.  And the man who does so is stupid, for whatever be the average practice of the German Army, the individual shots they employ as snipers shoot straight, and, screened from observation behind the lines, they are always watching.  And if you put your head over the parapet without orders they will hit that head.  \"There is another thing.  Troops new to the trenches always shoot at nothing the first night.  You will not do it.  It wastes ammunition and it hurts no one.  And the enemy says: 'These are new and nervous troops.'  You will be shelled in the trenches.  When you are shelled, sit low and sit tight.  This is easy advice, for there is nothing else to do.  If you get out you will only get it worse.  And if you go out the Germans will go in.  And if the Germans go in, we shall counter-attack and put them out; and that will cost us hundreds of men, instead of the few whom shells may injure.  The Germans do not like the bayonet, nor do they support bayonet attacks.  If they get up to you, or if you get up to them, go right in with the bayonet.  You have the physique to drive it home.  That you will do it I am sure, and I do not envy the Germans if you get among them with the bayonet.  \"There is one thing more.  My old regiment, the Royal West Kents, has been here since the beginning of the war, and it has never lost a trench.  The Army says, 'The West Kents never budge.'  I am proud of the great record of my old regiment.  And I think it is a good omen.  I now belong to you and you belong to me; and before long the Army will say: 'The Canadians never budge.'  Lads, it can be left there, and there I leave it.  The Germans will never turn you out.\"  I may, before concluding the present chapter, point out that the most severe military critics, both in England and in France, are loud in their admiration of the organising power which, in a non-military country, has produced so fine a force in so short a time.  In equipment, in all the countless details which in co-ordination mean efficiency, the Division holds its own with any division at the war. This result was only made possible by labour, zeal, and immense driving power, and these qualities were exhibited in Canada at the outbreak of war by all those whose duties lay in the work of improvisation.

It was night when I left the Canadian Divisional Headquarters and motored in a southerly direction towards Neuve Chapelle.  It was the eve of the great attack, and in the bright space of light cast by the motor lamps along the road, there came a kaleidoscopic picture of tramping men.  Here at the front there is no need of police restrictions on motor headlights at night as there is in London and on English country roads. The law under which you place yourself is the range of the enemy's guns.  Beyond that limit you are free to turn your headlights on, and there is no danger.  But, once within the range of rifle fire or shell, you turn your lights on at the peril of your own life.  So you go in darkness.  As we rode along with lamps lit, thousands of khaki-clad men were marching along that road--marching steadily in the direction of Neuve Chapelle.  The endless stream of their faces flashed along the edge of the _pav√©_ in the light of our lamps.  Their ranked figures, dim one moment in the darkness, sprang for an instant into clear outline as the light silhouetted them against the background of the night.  Then they passed out of the light again and became once more a legion of shadows, marching towards dawn and Neuve Chapelle.  The tramp of battalion after battalion was not, however, the tramp of a shadow army, but the firm, relentless, indomitable step of armed and trained men.  Every now and then there came a cry of \"Halt,\" and the columns came on the instant to a stand.  Minutes passed, and the command for the advance rang out.  "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/46114"],["title","Canada in Flanders, Volume I (#7)"],["body","columns moved again.  So it went on--halt--march--halt--march--hour by hour through the night along that congested road--a river of men and guns.  For while in one direction men were marching, in the other direction came batteries of guns, bound by another route for their position in front of Neuve Chapelle.  The two streams passed one another--legions of men and rumbling, clattering lines of artillery, all moving under screen of the dark, towards the line of trenches where the enemy lay.  This was no time to risk a block in traffic, and my motor, swerving off the paved centre of the road, sank to her axles in the quagmire of thick, sticky mud at the side.  The guns passed, and we sought to regain the paved way again, but our wheels spun round, merely churning dirt.  We could not move out of that pasty Flemish mud, until a Canadian ambulance wagon came to our aid.  The unhitched horses were made fast to the motor, and they heaved the car out of her clinging bed.  In the early morning I came to the cross roads.  The signpost planted at the crossing and pointing down the road to the south-east bore the inscription \"Six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle.\"  This was the road that the legions had taken.  It led almost in a straight line to the trenches that were to be stormed, to the village behind them that was to be captured, and to the town of La Bass√©e, a few kilometres further on, strongly held by the Germans.  \"Six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle \"--barely four miles; one hour's easy walking, let us say, on such a clear, fresh morning; or five minutes in a touring car if the time had been peace.  But who knew how many hours of bloody struggle would now be needed to cover that short level stretch of \"Six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle\"!  Between this signpost and the village towards which it pointed the way, many thousands of armed men--sons of the Empire--had come from Britain, from India, from all parts of the Dominions Overseas, to take their share in driving the wedge down to the end of this six kilometres of country road, and through the heart of the German lines.  Here for a moment they paused. What hopes, what fears, what joys, what sorrows, triumphs and tragedies were suggested by that austere signpost, pointing \"like Death's lean-lifted forefinger\" down that little stretch of road marked \"Six kilometres to Neuve Chapelle\"!  I went on foot part of the way here, for so many battalions of men were massed that motor traffic was impossible.  These were troops held in reserve.  Those selected for the initial infantry attack were already in the trenches ahead right and left of the further end of the road, waiting on the moment of the advance.  I had just passed the signpost when the comparative peace of morning was awfully shattered by the united roar and crash of hundreds of guns.  This broke out precisely at half-past seven.  The exact moment had been fixed beforehand for the beginning of a cannonade more concentrated and more terrific than any previous cannonade in the history of the world. It continued with extraordinary violence for half-an-hour, all calibres of guns taking part in it.  Some of the grandmotherly British howitzers hurled their enormously destructive shells into the German lines, on which a hurricane of shrapnel was descending from a host of smaller guns.  The German guns and trenches offered little or no reply, for the enemy were cowering for shelter from that storm.  I turned towards the left and watched for awhile the good part which the Canadian Artillery played in that attack.  The Canadian Division, which was a little further north than Neuve Chapelle, waited in its trenches, hoping always for the order to advance.  Then I passed down the road until I came to a minor crossways where a famous general stood in the midst of his Staff.  Motor despatch riders dashed up the road, bringing him news of the progress of the bombardment.  The news was good.  The General awaited the moment when the cannonade should cease, as suddenly as it had begun, and he should unleash his troops.  Indian infantry marched down the road and saluted the General as they passed.  He returned the salute and cried to the officer at the head of the column, \"Good luck.\"  The officer was an Indian, who, with a smile, replied in true Oriental fashion: \"Our Division has doubled in strength, General-Sahib, since it has seen you.\"  While the bombardment continued, British aeroplanes sailed overhead and crossed over to the German lines.  The Germans promptly turned some guns on them.  We saw white ball-puffs of smoke as the shrapnel shells burst in front, behind, above, below, and everywhere around the machines, but never near enough to hit.  They hovered like eagles above the din of the battle, surveying and reckoning the damage which our guns inflicted, and reporting progress.  [Illustration: Map--Line occupied by British in March 1915]  Once a German Taube rose in the air and lunged towards the British lines.  Then began a struggle for the mastery, which goes to the machine which can mount highest and fire down upon its enemy.  The Taube ringed upwards.  A couple of British aeroplanes circled after it. To and fro and round and round they went, until the end came.  The British machines secured the upper air, and soon we saw that the Taube was done.  Probably the pilot had been wounded.  The machine drooped and swooped uneasily till, like a wounded bird, it streaked down headlong far in the distance.  I walked over to where a British aeroplane was about to start on a flight.  The young officer of the Royal Flying Corps in charge was as cool as though he were taking a run in a motor-car at home.  \"As a matter of fact,\" he said, \"I wanted change and rest.  I had spent five months in the trenches, and was worn out and tired by the everlasting monotony and drudgery of it all.  So I applied for a job in the Flying Corps.  It soothes one's nerves to be up in the air for a bit after living down in the mud for so long.\"  I watched him soar up into the morning sky and saw numerous shrapnel bursts chasing him as he sailed about over the German lines.  What a quiet, easy-going holiday was this, dodging about in the air, a clear mark for the enemy's guns!  But, to tell the truth, the British flying men and machines are very rarely hit.  Flying in war-time is not so perilous as it looks, though it needs much skill and a calm, collected spirit.  At length the din of the gunfire ceased, and we knew that the British troops were rushing from their trenches to deal with the Germans, whose nerve the guns had shaken.  Astounded as they had been by our artillery fire, the Germans were still more amazed by the rapidity of the infantry attack.  The British soldiers and the Indians swept in upon them instantly till large numbers threw down their weapons, scrambled out of their trenches, and knelt, hands up, in token of surrender.  The fight swept on far beyond the German trenches, through the village, and beyond that again.  The big guns occasionally joined in, and the chatter of the machine-guns rose and broke off.  Now the motor ambulances began to come back--up that road down which the finger pointed to Neuve Chapelle.  They lurched past us as we stood by the signpost in an intermittent stream, bearing the wounded men from the fight.  Presently the cheerful sight of German prisoners alternated with the saddening procession of ambulances.  Large squads of prisoners went by, many hatless and with dirt-smeared faces, their uniforms looking as though dipped in mustard, the effect of the bursting of the British lyddite shells among them in their trenches.  The dejection of defeat was on their faces.  Some of them were halted and were questioned by the General.  One man turned out to be a Frankfort banker, whose chief concern later was what would become of his money, which he said had been taken charge of by some of his captors.  He was also anxious to know where he would be imprisoned, and seemed relieved, if not delighted, when he heard that it would be in England.  Another prisoner had been a hairdresser in Dresden.  The General questioned him, and he gave an entertaining account of his experiences as a soldier.  \"I am a Landwehr man,\" he said.  \"I was in Germany when I was ordered to entrain.  Presently the train drew up and I was ordered to get out, and was told I had to go and attack a place called Neuve Chapelle.  So I went on with others, and soon we came into a hell of fire, and we ran onwards and got into a trench, and there the hell was worse than ever. We began to fire our rifles.  Suddenly I heard shouting behind me, and looked round and saw a large number of Indians between me and the rest of the German Army.  I then looked at the other German soldiers in the trench and saw that they were throwing their rifles out of the trench. Well, I am a good German, but I did not want to be peculiar, so I threw my rifle out also, and then I was taken prisoner and brought here. Although I have not been long at the war, I have had enough of it.  I never saw daylight in the battlefield until I was a prisoner.\"  Some of the prisoners were brought along by the Indian troops who had captured them.  They complained bitterly that they, Germans, should be marched about in the custody of Indians!  They did not understand the grimly humorous reply: \"If the Indians are good enough to take you, they are good enough to keep you.\"  The Indians smiled with delight, for they are particularly fond of making prisoners of Germans.  Most of them brought back their little trophies of the fight, which they held out for inspection with a smile, crying, \"Souvenir!\"  The stream of prisoners and of wounded passed on.  The fury of battle relaxed.  Now and then some of the guns still crashed, but the machine guns rattled further and further away, and the crackle of the rifle fire came from a distance.  The British Army had traversed in triumph those \"six kilometres to Neuve"]]]
