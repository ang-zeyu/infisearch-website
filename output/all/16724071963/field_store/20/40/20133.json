Lullaby, darling; your mother is watching you; she’ll be your guardian    and shield.    Lullaby, slumber, my darling, till morning be bright upon mountain and    field.    Long, long the shadows fall.    All white and smooth at home your little bed is laid.    All round your head be angels.     EARLY IN THE MORNING I HEAR ON YOUR PIANO      EARLY in the morning I hear on your piano    You (at least, I guess it’s you) proceed to learn to play.    Mostly little minds should take and tackle their piano    While the birds are singing in the morning of the day.     FAIR ISLE AT SEA      FAIR Isle at Sea—thy lovely name    Soft in my ear like music came.    That sea I loved, and once or twice    I touched at isles of Paradise.     LOUD AND LOW IN THE CHIMNEY      LOUD and low in the chimney       The squalls suspire;    Then like an answer dwindles       And glows the fire,    And the chamber reddens and darkens       In time like taken breath.    Near by the sounding chimney       The youth apart    Hearkens with changing colour       And leaping heart,    And hears in the coil of the tempest       The voice of love and death.    Love on high in the flute-like       And tender notes    Sounds as from April meadows       And hillside cotes;    But the deep wood wind in the chimney       Utters the slogan of death.     I LOVE TO BE WARM BY THE RED FIRESIDE      I LOVE to be warm by the red fireside,       I love to be wet with rain:    I love to be welcome at lamplit doors,       And leave the doors again.     AT LAST SHE COMES      AT last she comes, O never more    In this dear patience of my pain    To leave me lonely as before,    Or leave my soul alone again.     MINE EYES WERE SWIFT TO KNOW THEE      MINE eyes were swift to know thee, and my heart    As swift to love.  I did become at once    Thine wholly, thine unalterably, thine    In honourable service, pure intent,    Steadfast excess of love and laughing care:    And as she was, so am, and so shall be.    I knew thee helpful, knew thee true, knew thee    And Pity bedfellows: I heard thy talk    With answerable throbbings.  On the stream,    Deep, swift, and clear, the lilies floated; fish    Through the shadows ran.  There, thou and I    Read Kindness in our eyes and closed the match.     FIXED IS THE DOOM      FIXED is the doom; and to the last of years    Teacher and taught, friend, lover, parent, child,    Each walks, though near, yet separate; each beholds    His dear ones shine beyond him like the stars.    We also, love, forever dwell apart;    With cries approach, with cries behold the gulph,    The Unvaulted; as two great eagles that do wheel in air    Above a mountain, and with screams confer,    Far heard athwart the cedars.                      Yet the years    Shall bring us ever nearer; day by day    Endearing, week by week, till death at last    Dissolve that long divorce.  By faith we love,    Not knowledge; and by faith, though far removed,    Dwell as in perfect nearness, heart to heart.                         We but excuse    Those things we merely are; and to our souls    A brave deception cherish.    So from unhappy war a man returns    Unfearing, or the seaman from the deep;    So from cool night and woodlands to a feast    May someone enter, and still breathe of dews,    And in her eyes still wear the dusky night.     MEN ARE HEAVEN’S PIERS      MEN are Heaven’s piers; they evermore    Unwearying bear the skyey floor;    Man’s theatre they bear with ease,    Unfrowning cariatides!    I, for my wife, the sun uphold,    Or, dozing, strike the seasons cold.    She, on her side, in fairy-wise    Deals in diviner mysteries,    By spells to make the fuel burn    And keep the parlour warm, to turn    Water to wine, and stones to bread,    By her unconquered hero-head.    A naked Adam, naked Eve,    Alone the primal bower we weave;    Sequestered in the seas of life,    A Crusoe couple, man and wife,    With all our good, with all our will,    Our unfrequented isle we fill;    And victor in day’s petty wars,    Each for the other lights the stars.    Come then, my Eve, and to and fro    Let us about our garden go;    And, grateful-hearted, hand in hand    Revisit all our tillage land,    And marvel at our strange estate,    For hooded ruin at the gate    Sits watchful, and the angels fear    To see us tread so boldly here.    Meanwhile, my Eve, with flower and grass    Our perishable days we pass;    Far more the thorn observe—and see    How our enormous sins go free—    Nor less admire, beside the rose,    How far a little virtue goes.     THE ANGLER ROSE, HE TOOK HIS ROD      THE angler rose, he took his rod,    He kneeled and made his prayers to God.    The living God sat overhead:    The angler tripped, the eels were fed     SPRING CAROL      WHEN loud by landside streamlets gush,    And clear in the greenwood quires the thrush,       With sun on the meadows       And songs in the shadows          Comes again to me          The gift of the tongues of the lea,    The gift of the tongues of meadows.     Straightway my olden heart returns    And dances with the dancing burns;       It sings with the sparrows;       To the rain and the (grimy) barrows          Sings my heart aloud—          To the silver-bellied cloud,    To the silver rainy arrows.     It bears the song of the skylark down,    And it hears the singing of the town;       And youth on the highways       And lovers in byways          Follows and sees:          And hearkens the song of the leas    And sings the songs of the highways.     So when the earth is alive with gods,    And the lusty ploughman breaks the sod,       And the grass sings in the meadows,       And the flowers smile in the shadows,          Sits my heart at ease,          Hearing the song of the leas,    Singing the songs of the meadows.     TO WHAT SHALL I COMPARE HER?      TO what shall I compare her,       That is as fair as she?    For she is fairer—fairer       Than the sea.    What shall be likened to her,       The sainted of my youth?    For she is truer—truer       Than the truth.     As the stars are from the sleeper,       Her heart is hid from me;    For she is deeper—deeper       Than the sea.    Yet in my dreams I view her       Flush rosy with new ruth—    Dreams!  Ah, may these prove truer       Than the truth.     WHEN THE SUN COMES AFTER RAIN      WHEN the sun comes after rain       And the bird is in the blue,    The girls go down the lane       Two by two.     When the sun comes after shadow       And the singing of the showers,    The girls go up the meadow,       Fair as flowers.     When the eve comes dusky red       And the moon succeeds the sun,    The girls go home to bed       One by one.     And when life draws to its even       And the day of man is past,    They shall all go home to heaven,       Home at last.     LATE, O MILLER      LATE, O miller,    The birds are silent,    The darkness falls.    In the house the lights are lighted.    See, in the valley they twinkle,    The lights of home.    Late, O lovers,    The night is at hand;    Silence and darkness    Clothe the land.     TO FRIENDS AT HOME      TO friends at home, the lone, the admired, the lost    The gracious old, the lovely young, to May       The fair, December the beloved,    These from my blue horizon and green isles,    These from this pinnacle of distances I,       The unforgetful, dedicate.     I, WHOM APOLLO SOMETIME VISITED      I, WHOM Apollo sometime visited,    Or feigned to visit, now, my day being done,    Do slumber wholly; nor shall know at all    The weariness of changes; nor perceive    Immeasurable sands of centuries    Drink of the blanching ink, or the loud sound    Of generations beat the music down.

Here one hour you toil and combat, sin and suffer, bleed and die;    In my father’s quiet mansion soon to lay your burden by.    Bear a moment, heavy laden, weary hand and weeping eye.    Lo, the feet of your deliverer; lo, the hour of freedom here.

Come to me, ye heavy laden, sin defiled and care opprest,    In your father’s quiet mansions, soon to prove a welcome guest.    But an hour you bear your trial, sin and suffer, bleed and die;    But an hour you toil and combat here in day’s inspiring eye.    See the feet of your deliverer; lo, the hour of freedom nigh.

October 1905                                 *A JAY OF ITALY*                                  *CHAPTER I*   On a hot morning, in the year 1476 of poignant memory, there drew up before an osteria on the Milan road a fair cavalcade of travellers. These were Messer Carlo Lanti and his inamorata, together with a suite of tentmen, pages, falconers, bed-carriers, and other personnel of a migratory lord on his way from the cooling hills to the Indian summer of the plains.  The chief of the little party, halting in advance of his fellows, lifted his plumed scarlet biretta with one strong young hand, and with the other, his reins hanging loose, ran a cluster of swarthy fingers through his black hair.  ’O little host!’ he boomed, blaspheming—for all good Catholics, conscious of their exclusive caste, swore by God prescriptively—’O little host, by the thirst of Christ’s passion, wine!’  ’He will bring you hyssop—by the token, he will,’ murmured the lady, who sat her white palfrey languidly beside him.  She was a slumberous, ivory-faced creature warm and insolent and lazy; and the little bells of her bridle tinkled sleepily, as her horse pawed, gently rocking her.  The cavalier grunted ferociously.  ’Let me see him!’ and, bonneting himself again, sat with right arm akimbo, glaring for a response to his cry.  He looked on first acquaintance a bully and profligate—which he was; but, for his times, with some redeeming features.  His thigh, in its close violet hose, and the long blade which hung at it seemed somehow in a common accord of steel and muscle.  His jaw was underhung, his brows were very thick and black, but the eyes beneath were good-humored, and he had a great dimple in his cheek.  A murmur of voices came from the inn, but no answer whatever to the demand.  The building, glaring white as a rock rolled into the plains from the great mountains to the north, had a little bush of juniper thrust out on a staff above its door.  It looked like a dry tongue protruded in derision, and awoke the demon in Messer Lanti.  He turned to a Page:—’Ercole!’ he roared, pointing; ’set a light there, and give these hinds a lesson!’  The lady laughed, and, stirring a little, watched the page curiously. But the boy had scarcely reached the ground when the landlord appeared bowing at the door. The cavalier fumed.  ’Ciacco—hog!’ he thundered: ’did you not hear us call?’  ’Illustrious, no.’  ’Where were your ears?  Nailed to the pillory?’  ’Nay, Magnificent, but to the utterances of the little Parablist of San Zeno.’  ’O hog! now by the Mass, I say, they had been better pricked to thy business.  O ciacco, I tell thee thy Parablist was like, in another moment, to have addressed thee out of a burning bush.  What!  I would drink, swine!  And, harkee, somewhere from those deep vats of thine the perfume of an old wine of Cana rises to my nostrils.  I say no more. Despatch!’  The landlord, abasing himself outwardly, took solace of a private curse as he turned into the shadow of his porch—  ’These skipjacks of the Sforzas! limbs of a country churl!’  Something lithe and gripping sprang upon his back as he muttered, making him roar out; and the chirrup of a great cricket shrilled in his ear—  ’Biting limbs! clawing, hooking, scoring limbs! ha-ha, hee-hee, ho-bir-r-r-r!’  Boniface, sweating with panic, wriggled to shake off his incubus.  It clung to him toe and claw.  Slewing his gross head, he saw, squatted upon his shoulders, a manikin in green livery, a monstrous grasshopper in seeming.  ’Messer Fool,’ he gurgled—’dear my lord’s most honoured jester!’ (he was essaying all the time to stagger with his burden out of earshot)—’prithee spare to damn a poor fellow for a hasty word under provocation! Prithee, sweet Messer Fool!’  The little creature, sitting him as a frog a pike, hooked its small talons into the corners of his eyes.  ’Provocation!’ it laughed, rocking—’provocation by his grandness to a guts!  If I fail to baste thee on a spit for it, call me not Cicada!’  ’Mercy!’ implored the landlord, staggering and groping.  ’Nothing for nothing.  At what price, tunbelly?’  The landlord clutched in his blindness at the post of a descending stair.  ’The best in my house.’  ’What best, paunch?’  ’Milan cheese—boiled bacon.  Ah, dear Messer Cicada, there is a fat cold capon, for which I will go fasting to thee.’  ’And what wine, beast?’  ’What thou wilt, indeed.’  The jester spurred him with a vicious heel.  ’Away, then!  Sink, submerge, titubate, and evanish into thy crystal vaults!’  ’Alas, I cannot see!’  The rider shifted his clutch to the fat jowls of his victim, who thereupon, with a groan, descended a rude flight of steps at a run, and brought up with his burden in a cool grotto.  Here were casks and stoppered jars innumerable; shelves of deep blue flasks; lolling amphoræ, and festoons of cobwebs drunk with must. Cicada leapt with one spring to a barrel, on which he squatted, rather now like a green frog than a grasshopper. His face, lean and leathery, looked as if dipped in a tan-pit; his eyes were as aspish as his tongue; he was a stunted, grotesque little creature, all vice and whipcord.  ’Despatch!’ he shrilled.  ’Thy wit is less a desert than my throat.’  ’Anon!’ mumbled the landlord, and hurried for a flask.  ’Let thy tongue roll on that,’ he said, ’and call me grateful.  As to the capon, prithee, for my bones’ sake, let me serve thy masters first.’  The jester had already the flask at his mouth.  The wine sank into him as into hot sand.  ’Go,’ he said, stopping a moment, and bubbling—’go, and damn thy capon; I ask no grosser aliment than this.’  The landlord, bustling in a restored confidence, filled a great bottle from a remote jar, and armed with it and some vessels of twisted glass, mounted to daylight once more.  Messer Lanti, scowling in the sun, cursed him for a laggard.  ’Magnificent!’ pleaded the man, ’the sweetest wine, like the sweetest meat, is near the bone.’  ’Deep in the ribs of the cellars, meanest, O, ciacco?’  He took a long draught, and turned to his lady.  ’Trust the rogue, Beatrice; it is, indeed, near the marrow of deliciousness.’  She sipped of her glass delicately, and nodded.  The cavalier held out his for more.  ’Malvasia, hog?’  ’Malvasia, most honoured; trod out by the white feet of prettiest contadina, and much favoured, by the token, of the Abbot of San Zeno yonder.’  Messer Lanti looked up with a new good-humour. The party was halted in a great flat basin among hills, on one of the lowest of which, remote and austere, sparkled the high, white towers of a monastery.  ’There,’ he said, signifying the spot to his companion with a grin; ’hast heard of Giuseppe della Grande, Beatrice, the _father_ of his people?’  ’And not least of our own little Parablist, Madonna,’ put in the landlord, with a salutation.  ’Plague, man!’ cried Lanti; ’who the devil is this Parablist you keep throwing at us?’  ’They call him Bernardo Bembo, my lord.  He was dropped and bred among the monks—some by-blow of a star, they say, in the year of the great fall.  He was found at the feet of Mary’s statue; and, certes, he is gifted like an angel.  He mouths parables as it were prick-songs, and is esteemed among all for a saint.’  ’A fair saint, i’faith, to be carousing in a tavern.’  ’O my lord! he but lies here an hour from the sun, on his way, this very morning, to Milan, whither he vouches he has had a call.  And for his carousing, spring water is it all, and the saints to pay, as I know to my cost.’  ’He should have stopped at the rill, methinks.’  ’He will stop at nothing,’ protested the landlord humbly; ’nay, not even the rebuking by his parables of our most illustrious lord, the Duke Galeazzo himself.’  Lanti guffawed.  ’Thou talkest treason, dog.  What is to rebuke there?’  ’What indeed, Magnificent?  Set a saint, _I_ say, to catch a saint.’  The other laughed louder.  ’The right sort of saint for that, I trow, from Giuseppe’s loins.’  ’Nay, good my lord, the Lord Abbot himself is no less a saint.’  ’What!’ roared Lanti, ’saints all around!  This is the right hagiolatry, where I need never despair of a niche for myself.  I too am the son of my father, dear Messer Ciacco, as this Parablist is, I’ll protest, of your Abbot, whose piety is an old story.  What! you don’t recognise a family likeness?’  The landlord abased himself between deference and roguery.  ’It is not for me to say, Magnificent.  I am no expert to prove the common authorship of this picture and the other.’  He lowered his eyes with a demure leer.  Honest Lanti, bending to rally him, chuckled loudly, and then, rising, brought his whip with a boisterous smack across his shoulders.  The landlord jumped and winced.  ’Spoken like a discreet son of the Church!’ cried the cavalier.  He breathed out his chest, drained his glass, still laughing into it, and, handing it down, settled himself in his saddle.  ’And so,’ he said, ’this saintly whelp of a saint is on his way to rebuke the lord of Sforza?’  ’With deference, my lord, like a younger Nathan.  So he hath been miscalled—I speak nothing from myself. The young man hath lived all his days among visions and voices; and at the last, it seems, they’ve spelled him out Galeazzo—though what the devil the need is there? as your Magnificence says.  But perhaps they made a mistake in the spelling.  The blessed Fathers themselves teach us that the best holiness lacks"]]]
