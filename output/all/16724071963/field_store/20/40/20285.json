And they do.  And to a woman he says: \"You were born to suffer.  Give me your husband; I want him for the fighting.\"  And she forthwith tells her man to make one more for the shambles.  And to the golden-haired girl he says: \"A truce to your vanity, off with your locks, that I may buy more rifles; and your lover I want, too. His manly breast will make an excellent scabbard for a French or Russian lance.\"  And the golden-haired one raves that she is thrice happy to be allowed to sacrifice her beauty and the idol of her dreams for the War Lord.  \"I want your fathers,\" he says to a playground full of children, \"and your uncles and big brothers and cousins.\"  And the little ones cry: \"Hurrah! Long live the Emperor!\"  \"Would ye live for ever?\" he queries of men between fifty and sixty-five.  \"To the barracks with you, even if you are but good for cannon fodder.\"  Someone tells him of a bunch of boys playing marbles in an alley; not one of them has finished his education.  The War Lord examines them critically and sniffs.  \"You are big enough to stop a bullet somehow,\" he allows, and they are led to slaughter.  The All Highest looks upon the earth and boasts of his winged legions of man-killers.  He declaims that Englishmen and Frenchmen and Italians and Belgians have turned out to fight God’s Anointed; but adds with a sly smile they left their women at home and their brood, that he may out-Herod Herod.  In his mind he feels the earth trembling under the heavy tread of his armed millions and the weight of his artillery.  This Dancing Dervish of universal slaughter, this man given over to murder-lust is the object of veneration not only of those whom he addresses in person, because of their mistaken sense of duty and patriotism; a whole nation, seventy millions strong, acclaim him Saviour—Messiah of the Fatherland’s destinies.  One can understand individual sacrifice, but seventy millions of people, every mother’s son and daughter, turning beasts of prey!  It baffles psychological speculation.  Everywhere the \"Evangelium of German superdom,\" as the War Lord sees it, is loud.  Small wonder Bertha, born of man-killer stock and suckled on the breasts of militarism, which nourished her kith and kin and their hundreds of thousands of dependents, believes unconditionally in the doctrines pronounced by her godfather, to her the God-head of power infinite, omniscience incarnate!  Hence the implied rebuke to Franz: \"German interests first.\"  After that she returned to the nursery—her Belgian doll.  Frau Krupp looked significantly at Franz. \"You were going to say——  \"My orders are to experiment with the War Lord’s new formula for steel on those guns for Liége.\"  Franz buried his head in his hands, elbows planted on knees, leaning forward heavily, while the Baroness sat looking at him, her nimble mind weighing the pros and cons.  At last she reached out a hand and touched the young man’s shoulder.  \"Franz,\" she said solemnly.  The young man’s head shot up and he stared at Frau Krupp as if she was a ghost.  Answering the question in her eyes, he almost shouted, \"Never!\" holding up his right hand as if under oath.  The Baroness placed his hand on Bertha’s head. \"Swear that you will stand by this child.\"  \"I swear, with all my heart, so help me, God,\" pronounced Franz, with severe emphasis.  A peculiar look came into the Baroness’s eyes, half satisfied, half cunning, as with a sort of imperious finality she said: \"It is well.\" Then, turning to the child: \"Bertha, run along now and tell them to serve in the small dining-room in five minutes.\"  \"Make it ten, Mamma, so I can put on my new _negligée_.\"  \"All right, ten; but hurry,\" agreed Frau Krupp, looking at the pendule.  When the curtain had fallen behind Bertha the Baroness turned a white, severe face upon Franz. Then, abandoning all pretence of loyalty to the Grand War Lord, she told the terrible secrets long locked in her bosom, secrets imparted by her late husband or gathered from his lips during long, sleepless nights while he tossed on his pillow.  \"It’s the Frankenstein we have to fight,\" she said, \"the pitiless, heartless, soul-less Evil One, intent upon setting the world afire through my child’s inheritance.  The plotting has been going on ever since the crowned monster was enthroned. Almost the first communication he made to Frederick, as head of the Empire, was: ’Now we must bend all energies to get ready.  And when we are, I will set my foot upon the neck of the universe, Charlemagne redivivus!’  \"Previous to that, Frederick and myself had agreed gradually to drop cannon- and ammunition-making. The Krupps were to create, instead of facilitating destruction.  No longer was Essen to be a place upon which a merciful God looked with abhorrence.  Engines of death had made us rich and powerful; henceforth the coined results of war were to be employed to make waste land arable, to drain morasses, to dig canals, to prosecute every peaceful endeavour promising to enhance the German people’s chances of happiness and prosperity. The old saw of turning swords into ploughshares was to be enacted by the firm that had made war thrice deadly.  Then the tempter came.  ’I rely upon you, Frederick! You are the Fatherland’s only hope, for Germany can achieve its destinies only through blood and iron.’  \"’One more supreme effort, Frederick, then the War Lord will turn husbandman, making you manager-general of his great farm stretching from the Arctic Circle to the Mediterranean, from the Atlantic to Siberia.’  \"As you know, the War Lord is an insinuating talker,\" continued Frau Krupp, \"and his autocratic manner, enhanced by occasional flurries of condescension and persuading Frederick to join in his social relaxations.  Ah!\" she cried, striking the table with her hand, \"it was these that forged the bullet which killed my husband!\"  There was a shrill tone of rage and defiance in the last words.  Then emotion mastered Frau Krupp’s strength.  She tottered, swayed, and would have fallen had not Franz caught her.  He knew what she had suffered through her husband’s intimacy with the War Lord and his cronies, and shuddered.  \"Mother,\" he said unconsciously, as her head touched his breast.  The Baroness let it rest there a moment; here was a tower of strength, of reserve force.  \"Alas!\" she continued, after a tense silence, \"in the long run they ensnared Frederick.  He succumbed to their ensnaring wiles as a foolish man might to the flatteries of a flirt.  My counsel was no longer sought; the promises he had made—which I had exacted in happier days—were forgotten or denied.  The very ploughs and ploughshares we were manufacturing then were thrown into the melting-pot for guns.\"  She picked up a book lying on the mantel. \"’Vital Statistics of the German Empire,’\" she read aloud; \"’Steady Increase of Population.’\"  She flung the volume on the hearth.  \"Multiply like the Biblical sands; it only means that Essen works the harder to put you under the sod.\"  Frau Krupp dropped her voice and went on in a whisper: \"Do you understand now what your threatened retirement would mean?  It would mean that, excepting France and Great Britain, the whole of the world, all the smaller nations, would be practically at the War Lord’s mercy, because their guns wouldn’t shoot, their swords and lances wouldn’t pierce.  \"Such is the goal he has been striving for, the goal he wants to attain through my little girl. ’Have them all inadequately armed, and it will be a walk-over for German arms,’ he calculates.\"  \"And how can I prevent the world’s debacle?\"  \"By fighting fire with fire.  You cannot fight the War Lord openly—pretend obedience, fall in with his plans apparently, be an enthusiastic faker, as far as he can see; but don’t smirch my little girl’s business honour and submerge the world under a tidal wave of blood by making other nations defenceless.  I have your promise, Franz?\"  \"It’s a vast prospect,\" answered the young engineer, \"but I have sworn to stand by Bertha——\"  \"I thank you,\" said the Baroness, as the portières were noisily pushed aside and a child’s voice cried: \"Supper’s ready.\"                                   *CHAPTER IV*                 *BERTHA KRUPP, WAR LADY, ASSERTS HERSELF*       Science Steps In—Franz Incurs the Kaiser’s Wrath   Six months of feverish activity in the Essen works, of tests and measuring velocities, of experimenting with ingots, hardening processes, chilled iron castings and compound steel—who knows or cares for the technique of murder machinery save generals of the staff?  As Mark Twain at one time labelled a book, \"There is no weather in this,\" so the present author will not burden his pages with figures and statistics of any sort.  It would be a tantalising undertaking at best, for the War Lord himself was directing, and insisted that his every misunderstood, mis-stated and often wholly untenable whim be immediately gratified by the ready servility of Krupp employés—\"his people.\"  Up to the time under discussion the Emperor Wilhelm had devoted nearly all his energies to drill, political intrigue and uttering platitudes. To dabble in formulary details, with nobody to dispute his opinion or correct his errors, flattered him in the proportion as his judgment about ordnance construction became more and more fantastic.  He was always going about with a half-dozen professors at his heels, losing no opportunity of propounding nebulous and remarkable theories to their startled but complaisant ears.  At the beginning of the present century the German professor was a hundred years behind the times in his dress, manners and social habits. The German Punch had rudely caricatured him into a new habitat, where soap and water, clean collars, unfrayed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44979"],["title","The Secret Memoirs of Bertha Krupp (#6)"],["body","and non-Cromwellian headgear held sway.  Up to that period, he had bathed occasionally, had curled his hair now and then, and thereafter relapsed into that state of slovenliness which is labelled scientific preoccupation by the German mob, and stands in awe of learning, be it ever so badly digested and wrongfully applied.  The War Lord had an English mother; he is a Barbarian fond of the tub. He perceived that professors might be made useful to him.  But how make them presentable?  A visit to England gave him the clue.  And forthwith the new order of Court dress was launched: short clothes and pumps, silk stockings and jabot-shirts; and the official Press rudely informed those \"entitled to the uniform\" that bathing was imperative before getting into it.  The brotherhood of science furthermore received hints to patronise the War Lord’s own barber in regard to their flowing beards.  \"But Admiral von Tirpitz wears a forked beard too,\" pleaded some.  \"No precedent, Herr Professor, his Excellency has Majesty’s special permit!\"  With the superfluous hair, the professors likewise had to shed their accustomed hyperbole.  \"Don’t speak until spoken to.\"  \"Answer in as few informatory words as can be managed.\"  \"Invariably make your answer meet the Imperial wishes.\"  \"Never contradict,\" were the Grand Master’s instructions, and the scientific men abiding by them soon found themselves in clover, because they were \"useful,\" while the rest were discarded.  In particular, experts in chemistry were exploited by the War Lord. \"They must help to feed my army and people\"—in case war lasts longer than expected.  \"They must invent new weapons of destruction\"—for while powder and lead are well enough in their way, they do not spell the end of things.  German scientific men are very fond of power and have an enormous idea of their own importance, but their notions are subject to fits of extravagant humility if policy, or personal advantage, can be served by Uriah Heepisms.  The keener ones in the Imperial entourage found that it would pay to cater to the mobility in the War Lord’s ideas while there was a certain degree of logic.  And if, perchance, he happened to drop into incoherency or extravagance, was it the professor’s business to set him right?  Court usage registered an emphatic negative.  Such were the beginnings of the partnership between War Lordism and the perversion of German science into an instrument of destruction. \"Science to the rescue of the lame and halt\"—an out-of-date notion.  Science makes them by the hundreds of thousands.  The professors were powerful assistants to the War Lord in maintaining his grip on the Krupp throat and acquiring further business concessions from the firm; but, of course, as to realising the technical chimeras of the War Lord’s mind with respect to new-fangled war machinery, there was more pretence than activity, for dividends had to be considered, and the War Lord would have been the first to make an outcry if his earnings were reduced by the fraction of a per cent.  Franz maintained his position as chief experimenter, and, his expert judgment in gunmaking as well as in electricity being unquestioned, he was able openly to frustrate some of the War Lord’s most bloodthirsty plans by proving them impracticable to the satisfaction of the board of directors, which put a stop to their execution for the time at least.  \"Uncle Majesty is very wroth with you,\" said Bertha to her relative one evening, when the War Lord had returned to Berlin after one of his unofficial visits to the Ruhr metropolis.  He was in the habit of coming to Essen every little while now, unheralded and incog.  Likewise in mufti; and what discarding of regimentals and associated fripperies meant to him few people can imagine.  His uniforms are built to make him appear taller and more imposing, while affording a ready background for all sorts of decorative material—ribbons, scarfs, stars, crosses and medals galore.  \"Wroth with me?\" queried Franz.  \"Yes, with you,\" replied the child; \"and I heard him dictate a long letter, giving you a terrible talking to.  I just signed it,\" added Bertha with a satisfied grin.  \"And why am I hauled over the coals?\" asked Franz.  \"I’m sure I don’t know,\" replied the child. \"’One of the things little girls cannot understand,’ said Uncle Majesty.  But I do know that you must—I said _must_—not do it again.  I won’t let you, do you hear?  I mean Uncle Majesty won’t.\"  Franz raised his hat and knocked his heels together, military fashion. He was about to withdraw when Bertha caught him by the arm.  \"You are not angry with me, Franz?\" she pleaded.  \"No, my chief.\"  \"Say ’no, _liebe_ Bertha.’\"  \"No, _liebe_ Bertha.\"  At this moment a messenger caught up with the two young people on the road to Villa Huegel and handed Franz an official-looking envelope. The engineer looked inquiringly at Bertha.  \"May I?\"  Instead of answer the Krupp heiress picked up her skirts with both hands and ran towards the house.  Her letter informed Franz that the task of completing the Belgian guns had been entrusted to other hands.  Secondly, that, in future, communications about experiments ordered by the War Lord must be addressed to the heiress direct, not to the board of directors.                                   *CHAPTER V*                       *HOW THE WAR LADY WAS CAJOLED*       An Intoxication of Vanity—Barbara’s Plain Words—A Shameful     Memory       The Imperial Chief-Court-and-House Marshal, Count Eulenburg, has     the honour to command Fraulein Bertha Krupp to attend upon their     Imperial and Royal Majesties, His Majesty the Emperor and King,     and Her Majesty the Empress and Queen, during the Christmas and     New Year’s festivities at the Schloss, Berlin.      A royal equipage will await Fraulein Krupp’s pleasure at the     station, meeting the early morning train of December 22nd.      _Dress_: Silks, Velvets and Laces.      _Attendance_: Wardrobe mistress and maid; A footman.   The invitation, copperplated on an immense sheet of rather cheap paper and sent through the mail free, created much excitement in Villa Huegel, the more so as it was wholly unexpected, the War Lord never having intimated that an honour of that kind was in store for his godchild.  In the meantime Bertha had risen to the dignity of opening her own letters and using her discretion as to divulging their contents, or not, as she saw fit, or rather as the War Lord saw fit.  This was strictly opposed to native custom; but isn’t the King above the law?  And certain reports, such as those ordered to be addressed to Bertha direct—Franz’s for instance—All-Highest wouldn’t have communicated to any save himself, not even to Frau Krupp.  Hence his command that the Krupp heiress keep her own counsel in regard to her correspondence.  Bertha broke the great seal of the Court Marshal’s office and her eyes became luminous as she read the printed words and angular script.  She sat staring at the latter for a minute or two, while the Baroness, chafing under her impotency, pretended to be busy with an orange. Finally Barbara tiptoed behind her sister’s chair and looked over her shoulder.  The fourteen-year-old girl being well up in Court lore—having seen dozens of such letters addressed to her late father—applied herself to the essentials, skipping the merely decorative lines.  \"Christmas and New Year’s festivities at the _Schloss_, Berlin,\" she read aloud.  Then higher up: \"Fraulein Bertha Krupp.\"  \"Oh, Mamma!\" she cried, \"we are not invited, you and I.  Isn’t that mean of Uncle Majesty?\"  She stamped her foot.  \"But he shan’t kiss me when he comes again—see if I let him kiss me.\"  \"Hold your tongue, naughty child.\"  Bertha spoke with an air of unwonted authority.  She folded up her letter.  \"Just see how high and mighty we are!\" mimicked Barbara.  \"’Naughty child,’ and what are you?  I shouldn’t wonder if Uncle Majesty spanked you sometimes, when you are alone with him; you always come away full of humility to him and of arro—arro—\" (she couldn’t find the word) \"the other thing to us—to Mamma and me, I mean.\"  The Baroness put out her arm as if she expected the children to resort to fisticuffs.  \"Barbara,\" she called half pleadingly.  \"She will go to her room,\" insisted Bertha, ringing.  The butler responded so promptly that there was no doubt he had been listening behind the portières.  \"Fraulein Barbara’s governess,\" Bertha ordered.  And as the man was going out: \"My secretary shall report at once in my council room.\"  \"Are you mad?\" cried Frau Krupp, when the curtains had dropped behind the servant.  Bertha seemed so unlike herself—unlike what her child ought to be.  The Krupp heiress disdained to answer.  \"Since I am to be their Imperial and Royal Majesties’ guest, I must prepare for the honour,\" she deigned after a little while; \"in half an hour I’ll leave for Cologne.  You may accompany me, if you like, Mother.\"  The Baroness grew white under the lash of Bertha’s patronising tone. \"You shall not go,\" she said hotly.  \"If you will come to the council room you can see in black and white my authority to go where and when I please,\" replied Bertha, going out.  Barbara and her mother looked at each other in blank amazement, the child not understanding, the mother understanding but too well.  Bertha was lost to her; the supreme egotist had gained a strangle-hold on her flesh and blood.  With the strange intuition that often moves children to do the right thing at the right time when grown-ups are at their wits’ end, Barbara seemed to divine what passed in her mother’s mind and, burying her face in the Baroness’s lap, she sobbed out convulsively words of consolation, of endearment and unbounded affection.  Frau Krupp bent over the child’s head and kissed her again and again.  \"My little girl, my Barbara, won’t discard Mother, will she?\" she said in broken tones.  \"Not for ten thousand Uncle Majesties,\" cried Barbara fiercely; and, as if"]]]
