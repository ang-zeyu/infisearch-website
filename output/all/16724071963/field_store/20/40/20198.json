They arrived at Roveredo late in the evening.  The wounded man again entreated Vittoria to remain by him till a messenger should bring one of his sisters from Trent.  \"See,\" she said to Leone, \"how I give grounds for suspicion of me; I nurse an enemy.\"  \"Here is a case where Barto is distinctly to blame,\" the lad replied. \"The poor fellow must want nursing, for he can't smoke.\"  Anna von Lenkenstein came from Trent to her brother's summons.  Vittoria was by his bedside, and the sufferer had fallen asleep with his head upon her arm.  Anna looked upon this scene with more hateful amazement than her dull eyelids could express.  She beckoned imperiously for her to come away, but Vittoria would not allow him to be disturbed, and Anna sat and faced her.  The sleep was long.  The eyes of the two women met from time to time, and Vittoria thought that Barto Rizzo's wife, though more terrible, was pleasanter to behold, and less brutal, than Anna.  The moment her brother stirred, Anna repeated her imperious gesture, murmuring, \"Away! out of my sight!\"  With great delicacy of touch she drew the arm from the pillow and thrust it back, and then motioning in an undisguised horror, said, \"Go.\"  Vittoria rose to go.  \"Is it my Lena?\" came from Karl's faint lips.  \"It is your Anna.\"  \"I should have known,\" he moaned.  Vittoria left them.  Some hours later, Countess Lena appeared, bringing a Trentino doctor. She said when she beheld Vittoria, \"Are you our evil genius, then?\" Vittoria felt that she must necessarily wear that aspect to them.  Still greater was Lena's amazement when she looked on Wilfrid.  She passed him without a sign.  Vittoria had to submit to an interview with both sisters before her departure.  Apart from her distress on their behalf, they had always seemed as very weak, flippant young women to her, and she could have smiled in her heart when Anna pointed to a day of retribution in the future.  \"I shall not seek to have you assassinated,\" Anna said; \"do not suppose that I mean the knife or the pistol.  But your day will come, and I can wait for it.  You murdered my brother Paul: you have tried to murder my brother Karl.  I wish you to leave this place convinced of one thing:-- you shall be repaid for it.\"  There was no direct allusion either to Weisspriess or to Wilfrid.  Lena spoke of the army.  \"You think our cause is ruined because we have insurrection on all sides of us: you do not know our army.  We can fight the Hungarians with one hand, and you Italians with the other--with a little finger.  On what spot have we given way?  We have to weep, it is true; but tears do not testify to defeat; and already I am inclined to pity those fools who have taken part against us.  Some have experienced the fruits of their folly.\"  This was the nearest approach to a hint at Wilfrid's misconduct.  Lena handed Leone's pass to Vittoria, and drawing out a little pocket almanac, said, \"You proceed to Milan, I presume.  I do not love your society; mademoiselle Belloni or Campa: yet I do not mind making an appointment--the doctor says a month will set my brother on his feet again,--I will make an appointment to meet you in Milan or Como, or anywhere in your present territories, during the month of August.  That affords time for a short siege and two pitched battles.\"  She appeared to be expecting a retort.  Vittoria replied, \"I could beg one thing on my knees of you, Countess Lena.\"  \"And that is--?\"  Lena threw her head up superbly.  \"Pardon my old friend the service he did me through friendship.\"  The sisters interchanged looks.  Lena flushed angrily.  Anna said, \"The person to whom yon allude is here.\"  \"He is attending on your brother.\"  \"Did he help this last assassin to escape, perchance?\"  Vittoria sickened at the cruel irony, and felt that she had perhaps done ill in beginning to plead for Wilfrid.  \"He is here; let him speak for himself: but listen to him, Countess Lena.\"  \"A dishonourable man had better be dumb,\" interposed Anna.  \"Ah! it is I who have offended you.\"  \"Is that his excuse?\"  Vittoria kept her eyes on the fiercer sister, who now declined to speak.  \"I will not excuse my own deeds; perhaps I cannot.  We Italians are in a hurricane; I cannot reflect.  It may be that I do not act more thinkingly than a wild beast.\"  \"You have spoken it,\" Anna exclaimed.  \"Countess Lena, he fights in your ranks as a common soldier.  He encounters more than a common soldier's risks.\"  \"The man is brave,--we knew that,\" said Anna.  \"He is more than brave, he is devoted.  He fights against us, without hope of reward from you.  Have I utterly ruined him?\"  \"I imagine that you may regard it as a fact that you have utterly ruined him,\" said Anna, moving to break up the parting interview.  Lena turned to follow her.  \"Ladies, if it is I who have hardened your hearts, I am more guilty than I thought.\"  Vittoria said no more.  She knew that she had been speaking badly, or ineffectually, by a haunting flatness of sound, as of an unstrung instrument, in her ears: she was herself unstrung and dispirited, while the recollection of Anna's voice was like a sombre conquering monotony on a low chord, with which she felt insufficient to compete.  Leone was waiting in the carriage to drive to the ferry across the Adige. There was news in Roveredo of the king's advance upon Rivoli; and Leone sat trying to lift and straighten out his wounded arm, with grimaces of laughter at the pain of the effort, which resolutely refused to acknowledge him to be an able combatant.  At the carriage-door Wilfrid bowed once over Vittoria's hand.  \"You see that,\" Anna remarked to her sister.  \"I should have despised him if he had acted indifference,\" replied Lena.  She would have suspected him--that was what her heart meant; the artful show of indifference had deceived her once.  The anger within her drew its springs much more fully from his refusal to respond to her affection, when she had in a fit of feminine weakness abased herself before him on the night of the Milanese revolt, than from the recollection of their days together in Meran.  She had nothing of her sister's unforgivingness. And she was besides keenly curious to discover the nature of the charm Vittoria threw on him, and not on him solely.  Vittoria left Wilfrid to better chances than she supposed.  \"Continue fighting with your army,\" she said, when they parted.  The deeper shade which traversed his features told her that, if she pleased, her sway might still be active; but she had no emotion to spare for sentimental regrets.  She asked herself whether a woman who has cast her lot in scenes of strife does not lose much of her womanhood and something of her truth; and while her imagination remained depressed, her answer was sad.  In that mood she pitied Wilfrid with a reckless sense of her inability to repay him for the harm she had done him.  The tragedies written in fresh blood all about her, together with that ever-present image of the fate of Italy hanging in the balance, drew her away from personal reflections.  She felt as one in a war-chariot, who has not time to cast more than a glance on the fallen.  At the place where the ferry is, she was rejoiced by hearing positive news of the proximity of the Royal army.  There were none to tell her that Charles Albert had here made his worst move by leaving Vicenza to the operations of the enemy, that he might become master of a point worthless when Vicenza fell into the enemy's hands. The old Austrian Field-Marshal had eluded him at Mantua on that very night when Vittoria had seen his troops in motion.  The daring Austrian flank-march on Vicenza, behind the fortresses of the Quadrilateral, was the capital stroke of the campaign.  But the presence of a Piedmontese vanguard at Rivoli flushed the Adige with confidence, and Vittoria went on her way sharing the people's delight.  She reached Brescia to hear that Vicenza had fallen.  The city was like a landscape smitten black by the thunder-cloud.  Vittoria found Countess Ammiani at her husband's tomb, stiff, colourless, lifeless as a monument attached to the tomb.     CHAPTER XXXV  CLOSE OF THE LOMBARD CAMPAIGN--VITTORIA'S PERPLEXITY  The fall of Vicenza turned a tide that had overflowed its barriers with force enough to roll it to the Adriatic.  From that day it was as if a violent wind blew East over Lombardy; flood and wind breaking here and there a tree, bowing everything before them.  City, fortress, and battle- field resisted as the eddy whirls.  Venice kept her brave colours streaming aloft in a mighty grasp despite the storm, but between Venice and Milan there was this unutterable devastation,--so sudden a change, so complete a reversal of the shield, that the Lombards were at first incredulous even in their agony, and set their faces against it as at a monstrous eclipse, as though the heavens were taking false oath of its being night when it was day.  From Vicenza and Rivoli, to Sommacampagna, and across Monte Godio to Custozza, to Volta on the right of the Mincio, up to the gates of Milan, the line of fire travelled, with a fantastic overbearing swiftness that, upon the map, looks like the zig-zag elbowing of a field-rocket.  Vicenza fell on the 11th of June; the Austrians entered Milan on the 6th of August.  Within that short time the Lombards were struck to the dust.  Countess Ammiani quitted Brescia for Bergamo before the worst had happened; when nothing but the king's retreat upon the Lombard capital, after the good fight at Volta, was known.  According to the king's proclamation the Piedmontese army was to defend Milan, and hope was not dead.  Vittoria succeeded in repressing all useless signs of grief in the presence of the venerable lady, who herself showed none, but simply recommended her accepted daughter to pray daily.  \"I can neither confess nor pray,\" Vittoria said to the priest, a comfortable, irritable ecclesiastic,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4441"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 7 (#4)"],["body","attached to the family, and little able to deal with this rebel before Providence, that would not let her swollen spirit be bled.  Yet she admitted to him that the countess possessed resources which she could find nowhere; and she saw the full beauty of such inimitable grave endurance.  Vittoria's foolish trick of thinking for herself made her believe, nevertheless, that the countess suffered more than she betrayed, was less consoled than her spiritual comforter imagined.  She continued obstinate and unrepentant, saying, \"If my punishment is to come, it will at least bring experience with it, and I shall know why I am punished.  The misery now is that I do not know, and do not see, the justice of the sentence.\"  Countess Ammiani thought better of her case than the priest did; or she was more indulgent, or half indifferent.  This girl was Carlo's choice; --a strange choice, but the times were strange, and the girl was robust. The channels of her own and her husband's house were drying on all sides; the house wanted resuscitating.  There was promise that the girl would bear children of strong blood.  Countess Ammiani would not for one moment have allowed the spiritual welfare of the children to hang in dubitation, awaiting their experience of life; but a certain satisfaction was shown in her faint smile when her confessor lamented over Vittoria's proud stony state of moral revolt.  She said to her accepted daughter, \"I shall expect you to be prepared to espouse my son as soon as I have him by my side;\" nor did Vittoria's silent bowing of her face assure her that strict obedience was implied.  Precise words--\"I will,\" and \"I will not fail\"--were exacted.  The countess showed some emotion after Vittoria had spoken.  \"Now, may God end this war quickly, if it is to go against us,\" she exclaimed, trembling in her chair visibly a half-minute, with dropped eyelids and lips moving.  Carlo had sent word that he would join his mother as early as he was disengaged from active service, and meantime requested her to proceed to a villa on Lago Maggiore.  Vittoria obtained permission from the countess to order the route of the carriage through Milan, where she wished to take up her mother and her maid Giacinta.  For other reasons she would have avoided the city.  The thought of entering it was painful with the shrewdest pain.  Dante's profoundly human line seemed branded on the forehead of Milan.  The morning was dark when they drove through the streets of Bergamo. Passing one of the open places, Vittoria beheld a great concourse of volunteer youth and citizens, all of them listening to the voice of one who stood a few steps above them holding a banner.  She gave an outcry of bitter joy.  It was the Chief.  On one side of him was Agostino, in the midst of memorable heads that were unknown to her.  The countess refused to stay, though Vittoria strained her hands together in extreme entreaty that she might for a few moments hear what the others were hearing. \"I speak for my son, and I forbid it,\" Countess Ammiani said.  Vittoria fell back and closed her eyes to cherish the vision.  All those faces raised to the one speaker under the dark sky were beautiful.  He had breathed some new glory of hope in them, making them shine beneath the overcast heavens, as when the sun breaks from an evening cloud and flushes the stems of a company of pine-trees.  Along the road to Milan she kept imagining his utterance until her heart rose with music.  A delicious stream of music, thin as poor tears, passed through her frame, like a life reviving.  She reached Milan in a mood to bear the idea of temporary defeat.  Music had forsaken her so long that celestial reassurance seemed to return with it.  Her mother was at Zotti's, very querulous, but determined not to leave the house and the few people she knew.  She had, as she told her daughter, fretted so much on her account that she hardly knew whether she was glad to see her.  Tea, of course, she had given up all thoughts of; but now coffee was rising, and the boasted sweet bread of Lombardy was something to look at!  She trusted that Emilia would soon think of singing no more, and letting people rest: she might sing when she wanted money.  A letter recently received from Mr. Pericles said that Italy was her child's ruin, and she hoped Emilia was ready to do as he advised, and hurry to England, where singing did not upset people, and people lived like real Christians, not----Vittoria flapped her hand, and would not hear of the unchristian crimes of the South.  As regarded the expected defence of Milan, the little woman said, that if it brought on a bombardment, she would call it unpardonable wickedness, and only hoped that her daughter would repent.  Zotti stood by, interpreting the English to himself by tones.  \"The amiable donnina is not of our persuasion,\" he observed.  \"She remains dissatisfied with patriotic Milan.  I have exhibited to her my dabs of bread through all the processes of making and baking.  It is in vain. She rejects analogy.  She is wilful as a principessina: 'Tis so! 'tis not so! 'tis my will!  be silent, thou!  Signora, I have been treated in that way by your excellent mother.\"  \"Zotti has not been paid for three weeks, and he certainly has not mentioned it or looked it, I will say, Emilia.\"  \"Zotti has had something to think of during the last three weeks,\" said Vittoria, touching him kindly on the arm.  The confectioner lifted his fingers and his big brown eyes after them, expressive of the unutterable thoughts.  He informed her that he had laid in a stock of flour, in the expectation that Carlo Alberto would defend the city: The Milanese were ready to aid him, though some, as Zotti confessed, had ceased to effervesce; and a great number who were perfectly ready to fight regarded his tardy appeal to Italian patriotism very coldly.  Zotti set out in person to discover Giacinta.  The girl could hardly fetch her breath when she saw her mistress.  She was in Laura's service, and said that Laura had brought a wounded Englishman from the field of Custozza.  Vittoria hurried to Laura, with whom she found Merthyr, blue-white as a corpse, having been shot through the body. His sister was in one of the Lombard hamlets, unaware of his fall; Beppo had been sent to her.  They noticed one another's embrowned complexions, but embraced silently. \"Twice widowed!\"  Laura said when they sat together.  Laura hushed all speaking of the war or allusion to a single incident of the miserable campaign, beyond the bare recital of Vittoria's adventures; yet when Vicenza by chance was mentioned, she burst out: \"They are not cities, they are living shrieks.  They have been made impious for ever.  Burn them to ashes, that they may not breathe foul upon heaven!  \"She had clung to the skirts of the army as far as the field of Custozza.  \"He,\" she said, pointing to the room where Merthyr lay,--\"he groans less than the others I have nursed.  Generally, when they looked at me, they appeared obliged to recollect that it was not I who had hurt them.  Poor souls! some ended in great torment.  'I think of them as the happiest; for pain is a cloak that wraps you about, and I remember one middle-aged man who died softly at Custozza, and said, 'Beaten!'  To take that thought as your travelling companion into the gulf, must be worse than dying of agony; at least, I think so.\"  Vittoria was too well used to Laura's way of meeting disaster to expect from her other than this ironical fortitude, in which the fortitude leaned so much upon the irony.  What really astonished her was the conception Laura had taken of the might of Austria.  Laura did not directly speak of it, but shadowed it in allusive hints, much as if she had in her mind the image of an iron roller going over a field of flowers --hateful, imminent, irresistible.  She felt as a leaf that has been flying before the gale.  Merthyr's wound was severe: Vittoria could not leave him.  Her resolution to stay in Milan brought her into collision with Countess Ammiani, when the countess reminded her of her promise, sedately informing her that she was no longer her own mistress, and had a primary duty to fulfil.  She offered to wait three days, or until the safety of the wounded man was medically certified to.  It was incomprehensible to her that Vittoria should reject her terms; and though it was true that she would not have listened to a reason, she was indignant at not hearing one given in mitigation of the offence.  She set out alone on her journey, deeply hurt.  The reason was a feminine sentiment, and Vittoria was naturally unable to speak it.  She shrank with pathetic horror from the thought of Merthyr's rising from his couch to find her a married woman, and desired most earnestly that her marriage should be witnessed by him.  Young women will know how to reconcile the opposition of the sentiment.  Had Merthyr been only slightly wounded, and sound enough to seem to be able to bear a bitter shock, she would not have allowed her personal feelings to cause chagrin to the noble lady.  The sight of her dear steadfast friend prostrate in the cause of Italy, and who, if he lived to rise again, might not have his natural strength to bear the thought of her loss with his old brave firmness, made it impossible for her to act decisively in one direct line of conduct.  Countess Ammiani wrote brief letters from Luino and Pallanza on Lago Maggiore.  She said that Carlo was in the Como mountains; he would expect to find his bride, and would accuse his mother; \"but his mother will be spared those reproaches,\" she added, \"if the last shot fired kills, as it generally does, the bravest and the dearest.\"  \"If it should!\"--the thought rose on a quick breath in Vittoria's bosom, and the sentiment which held her away dispersed like a feeble smoke, and showed her another view of her features.  She wept with longing for love and dependence.  She was sick of personal freedom,"]]]
