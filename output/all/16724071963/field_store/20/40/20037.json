I staid over in Philadelphia one day at the old Mansion House, to visit the family of my brother-in-law, Mr. Reese.  I found his father a fine sample of the old merchant gentleman, in a good house in Arch Street, with his accomplished daughters, who had been to Ohio, and whom I had seen there.  From Philadelphia we took boat to Bordentown, rail to Amboy, and boat again to New York City, stopping at the American Hotel.  I staid a week in New York City, visiting my uncle, Charles Hoyt, at his beautiful place on Brooklyn Heights, and my uncle James, then living in White Street.  My friend William Scott was there, the young husband of my cousin, Louise Hoyt; a neatly-dressed young fellow, who looked on me as an untamed animal just caught in the far West--\"fit food for gunpowder,\" and good for nothing else.  About June 12th I embarked in the steamer Cornelius Vanderbilt for West Point; registered in the office of Lieutenant C. F. Smith, Adjutant of the Military Academy, as a new cadet of the class of 1836, and at once became installed as the \"plebe\" of my fellow-townsman, William Irvin, then entering his Third Class.  Colonel R. E. De Russy was Superintendent; Major John Fowle, Sixth United States Infantry, Commandant.  The principal Professors were: Mahan, Engineering; Bartlett, Natural Philosophy; Bailey, Chemistry; Church, Mathematics; Weir, Drawing; and Berard, French.  The routine of military training and of instruction was then fully established, and has remained almost the same ever since.  To give a mere outline would swell this to an inconvenient size, and I therefore merely state that I went through the regular course of four years, graduating in June, 1840, number six in a class of forty-three.  These forty-three were all that remained of more than one hundred which originally constituted the class.  At the Academy I was not considered a good soldier, for at no time was I selected for any office, but remained a private throughout the whole four years.  Then, as now, neatness in dress and form, with a strict conformity to the rules, were the qualifications required for office, and I suppose I was found not to excel in any of these.  In studies I always held a respectable reputation with the professors, and generally ranked among the best, especially in drawing, chemistry, mathematics, and natural philosophy.  My average demerits, per annum, were about one hundred and fifty, which. reduced my final class standing from number four to six.  In June, 1840, after the final examination, the class graduated and we received our diplomas.  Meantime, Major Delafield, United States Engineers, had become Superintendent; Major C. F. Smith, Commandant of Cadets; but the corps of professors and assistants remained almost unchanged during our whole term.  We were all granted the usual furlough of three months, and parted for our homes, there to await assignment to our respective corps and regiments.  In due season I was appointed and commissioned second-lieutenant, Third Artillery, and ordered to report at Governor's Island, New York Harbor, at the end of September.  I spent my furlough mostly at Lancaster and Mansfield, Ohio; toward the close of September returned to New York, reported to Major Justin Dimock, commanding the recruiting rendezvous at Governor's Island, and was assigned to command a company of recruits preparing for service in Florida. Early in October this company was detailed, as one of four, to embark in a sailing-vessel for Savannah, Georgia, under command of Captain and Brevet Major Penrose.  We embarked and sailed, reaching Savannah about the middle of October, where we transferred to a small steamer and proceeded by the inland route to St. Augustine, Florida.  We reached St. Augustine at the same time with the Eighth Infantry, commanded by Colonel and Brevet Brigadier-General William J. Worth.  At that time General Zachary Taylor was in chief command in Florida, and had his headquarters at Tampa Bay.  My regiment, the Third Artillery, occupied the posts along the Atlantic coast of Florida, from St. Augustine south to Key Biscayne, and my own company, A, was at Fort Pierce, Indian River.  At St. Augustine I was detached from the company of recruits, which was designed for the Second Infantry, and was ordered to join my proper company at Fort Pierce.  Colonel William Gates commanded the regiment, with Lieutenant William Austine Brown as adjutant of the regiment. Lieutenant Bragg commanded the post of St. Augustine with his own company, E, and G (Garner's), then commanded by Lieutenant Judd. In, a few days I embarked in the little steamer William Gaston down the coast, stopping one day at New Smyrna, held by John R. Vinton's company (B), with which was serving Lieutenant William H. Shover.  In due season we arrived off the bar of Indian River and anchored. A whale-boat came off with a crew of four men, steered by a character of some note, known as the Pilot Ashlock.  I transferred self and baggage to this boat, and, with the mails, was carried through the surf over the bar, into the mouth of Indian River Inlet.  It was then dark; we transferred to a smaller boat, and the same crew pulled us up through a channel in the middle of Mangrove Islands, the roosting-place of thousands of pelicans and birds that rose in clouds and circled above our heads.  The water below was alive with fish, whose course through it could be seen by the phosphoric wake; and Ashlock told me many a tale of the Indian war then in progress, and of his adventures in hunting and fishing, which he described as the best in the world.  About two miles from the bar, we emerged into the lagoon, a broad expanse of shallow water that lies parallel with the coast, separated from it by a narrow strip of sand, backed by a continuous series of islands and promontories, covered with a dense growth of mangrove and saw-palmetto.  Pulling across this lagoon, in about three more miles we approached the lights of Fort Pierce.  Reaching a small wharf, we landed, and were met by the officers of the post, Lieutenants George Taylor and Edward J. Steptoe, and Assistant-Surgeon James Simons.  Taking the mail-bag, we walked up a steep sand-bluff on which the fort was situated, and across the parade-ground to the officers' quarters.  These were six or seven log-houses, thatched with palmetto-leaves, built on high posts, with a porch in front, facing the water.  The men's quarters were also of logs forming the two sides of a rectangle, open toward the water; the intervals and flanks were closed with log stockades.  I was assigned to one of these rooms, and at once began service with my company, A, then commanded by Lieutenant Taylor.  The season was hardly yet come for active operations against the Indians, so that the officers were naturally attracted to Ashlock, who was the best fisherman I ever saw.  He soon initiated us into the mysteries of shark-spearing, trolling for red-fish, and taking the sheep's-head and mullet.  These abounded so that we could at any time catch an unlimited quantity at pleasure.  The companies also owned nets for catching green turtles.  These nets had meshes about a foot square, were set across channels in the lagoon, the ends secured to stakes driven into the mad, the lower line sunk with lead or stone weights and the upper line floated with cork. We usually visited these nets twice a day, and found from one to six green turtles entangled in the meshes.  Disengaging them, they were carried to pens, made with stakes stuck in the mud, where they were fed with mangrove-leaves, and our cooks had at all times an ample supply of the best of green turtles.  They were so cheap and common that the soldiers regarded it as an imposition when compelled to eat green turtle steaks, instead of poor Florida beef, or the usual barrelled mess-pork.  I do not recall in my whole experience a spot on earth where fish, oysters, and green turtles so abound as at Fort Pierce, Florida.  In November, Major Childs arrived with Lieutenant Van Vliet and a detachment of recruits to fill our two companies, and preparations were at once begun for active operations in the field.  At that time the Indians in the Peninsula of Florida were scattered, and the war consisted in hunting up and securing the small fragments, to be sent to join the others of their tribe of Seminoles already established in the Indian Territory west of Arkansas.  Our expeditions were mostly made in boats in the lagoons extending from the \"Haul-over,\" near two hundred miles above the fort, down to Jupiter Inlet, about fifty miles below, and in the many streams which emptied therein.  Many such expeditions were made during that winter, with more or less success, in which we succeeded in picking up small parties of men, women, and children.  On one occasion, near the \"Haul-over,\" when I was not present, the expedition was more successful.  It struck a party of nearly fifty Indians, killed several warriors, and captured others.  In this expedition my classmate, lieutenant Van Vliet, who was an excellent shot, killed a warrior who was running at full speed among trees, and one of the sergeants of our company (Broderick) was said to have dispatched three warriors, and it was reported that he took the scalp of one and brought it in to the fort as a trophy.  Broderick was so elated that, on reaching the post, he had to celebrate his victory by a big drunk.  There was at the time a poor, weakly soldier of our company whose wife cooked for our mess.  She was somewhat of a flirt, and rather fond of admiration.  Sergeant Broderick was attracted to her, and hung around the mess-house more than the husband fancied; so he reported the matter to Lieutenant Taylor, who reproved Broderick for his behavior.  A few days afterward the husband again appealed to his commanding officer (Taylor), who exclaimed: \"Haven't you got a musket?  Can't you defend your own family?\"  Very soon after a shot was heard"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4361"],["title","Memoirs of General William T. Sherman — Complete (#3)"],["body","by the mess-house, and it transpired that the husband had actually shot Broderick, inflicting a wound which proved mortal.  The law and army regulations required that the man should be sent to the nearest civil court, which was at St. Augustine; accordingly, the prisoner and necessary witnesses were sent up by the next monthly steamer.  Among the latter were lieutenant Taylor and the pilot Ashlock.  After they had been gone about a month, the sentinel on the roof-top of our quarters reported the smoke of a steamer approaching the bar, and, as I was acting quartermaster, I took a boat and pulled down to get the mail.  I reached the log-but in which the pilots lived, and saw them start with their boat across the bar, board the steamer, and then return.  Ashlock was at his old post at the steering-oar, with two ladies, who soon came to the landing, having passed through a very heavy surf, and I was presented to one as Mrs. Ashlock, and the other as her sister, a very pretty little Minorcan girl of about fourteen years of age.  Mrs. Ashlock herself was probably eighteen or twenty years old, and a very handsome woman.  I was hurriedly informed that the murder trial was in progress at St. Augustine; that Ashlock had given his testimony, and had availed himself of the chance to take a wife to share with him the solitude of his desolate hut on the beach at Indian River. He had brought ashore his wife, her sister, and their chests, with the mail, and had orders to return immediately to the steamer (Gaston or Harney) to bring ashore some soldiers belonging to another company, E (Braggs), which had been ordered from St. Augustine to Fort Pierce.  Ashlock left his wife and her sister standing on the beach near the pilot-hut, and started back with his whale-boat across the bar.  I also took the mail and started up to the fort, and had hardly reached the wharf when I observed another boat following me.  As soon as this reached the wharf the men reported that Ashlock and all his crew, with the exception of one man, had been drowned a few minutes after I had left the beach. They said his surf-boat had reached the steamer, had taken on board a load of soldiers, some eight or ten, and had started back through the surf, when on the bar a heavy breaker upset the boat, and all were lost except the boy who pulled the bow-oar, who clung to the rope or painter, hauled himself to the upset boat, held on, drifted with it outside the breakers, and was finally beached near a mile down the coast. They reported also that the steamer had got up anchor, run in as close to the bar as she could, paused awhile, and then had started down the coast.  I instantly took a fresh crew of soldiers and returned to the bar; there sat poor Mrs. Ashlock on her chest of clothes, a weeping widow, who had seen her husband perish amid sharks and waves; she clung to the hope that the steamer had picked him up, but, strange to say, he could not swim, although he had been employed on the water all his life.  Her sister was more demonstrative, and wailed as one lost to all hope and life.  She appealed to us all to do miracles to save the struggling men in the waves, though two hours had already passed, and to have gone out then among those heavy breakers, with an inexperienced crew, would have been worse than suicide.  All I could do was to reorganize the guard at the beach, take the two desolate females up to the fort, and give them the use of my own quarters.  Very soon their anguish was quieted, and they began to look, for the return of their steamer with Ashlock and his rescued crew.  The next day I went again to the beach with Lieutenant Ord, and we found that one or two bodies had been washed ashore, torn all to pieces by the sharks, which literally swarmed the inlet at every new tide.  In a few days the weather moderated, and the steamer returned from the south, but the surf was so high that she anchored a mile off.  I went out myself, in the whale or surf boat, over that terrible bar with a crew of soldiers, boarded the steamer, and learned that none other of Ashlock's crew except the one before mentioned had been saved; but, on the contrary, the captain of the steamer had sent one of his own boats to their rescue, which was likewise upset in the surf, and, out of the three men in her, one had drifted back outside the breakers, clinging to the upturned boat, and was picked up.  This sad and fatal catastrophe made us all afraid of that bar, and in returning to the shore I adopted the more prudent course of beaching the boat below the inlet, which insured us a good ducking, but was attended with less risk to life.  I had to return to the fort and bear to Mrs. Ashlock the absolute truth, that her husband was lost forever.  Meantime her sister had entirely recovered her equilibrium, and being the guest of the officers, who were extremely courteous to her, she did not lament so loudly the calamity that saved them a long life of banishment on the beach of Indian River.  By the first opportunity they were sent back to St. Augustine, the possessors of all of Ashlock's worldly goods and effects, consisting of a good rifle, several cast-nets, hand-lines, etc., etc., besides some three hundred dollars in money, which was due him by the quartermaster for his services as pilot.  I afterward saw these ladies at St. Augustine, and years afterward the younger one came to Charleston, South Carolina, the wife of the somewhat famous Captain Thistle, agent for the United States for live-oak in Florida, who was noted as the first of the troublesome class of inventors of modern artillery.  He was the inventor of a gun that \"did not recoil at all,\" or \"if anything it recoiled a little forward.\"  One day, in the summer of 1841, the sentinel on the housetop at Fort Pierce called out, \"Indians!  Indians!\" Everybody sprang to his gun, the companies formed promptly on the parade-ground, and soon were reported as approaching the post, from the pine-woods in rear, four Indians on horseback.  They rode straight up to the gateway, dismounted, and came in.  They were conducted by the officer of the day to the commanding officer, Major Childs, who sat on the porch in front of his own room.  After the usual pause, one of them, a black man named Joe, who spoke English, said they had been sent in by Coacoochee (Wild Cat), one of the most noted of the Seminole chiefs, to see the big chief of the post.  He gradually unwrapped a piece of paper, which was passed over to Major Childs, who read it, and it was in the nature of a \"Safe Guard\" for \"Wild Cat\" to come into Fort Pierce to receive provisions and assistance while collecting his tribe, with the purpose of emigrating to their reservation west of Arkansas.  The paper was signed by General Worth, who had succeeded General Taylor, at Tampa Bay, in command of all the troops in Florida.  Major Childs inquired, \"Where is Coacoochee?\" and was answered, \"Close by,\" when Joe explained that he had been sent in by his chief to see if the paper was all right. Major Childs said it was \"all right,\" and that Coacoochee ought to come in himself.  Joe offered to go out and bring him in, when Major Childs ordered me to take eight or ten mounted men and go out to escort him in.  Detailing ten men to saddle up, and taking Joe and one Indian boy along on their own ponies, I started out under their guidance.  We continued to ride five or six miles, when I began to suspect treachery, of which I had heard so much in former years, and had been specially cautioned against by the older officers; but Joe always answered, \"Only a little way.\"   At last we approached one of those close hammocks, so well known in Florida, standing like an island in the interminable pine-forest, with a pond of water near it.  On its edge I noticed a few Indians loitering, which Joe pointed out as the place.  Apprehensive of treachery, I halted the guard, gave orders to the sergeant to watch me closely, and rode forward alone with the two Indian guides.  As we neared the hammock, about a dozen Indian warriors rose up and waited for us. When in their midst I inquired for the chief, Coacoochee.  He approached my horse and, slapping his breast, said, \"Me Coacoochee.\"  He was a very handsome young Indian warrior, not more than twenty-five years old, but in his then dress could hardly be distinguished from the rest.  I then explained to him, through Joe, that I had been sent by my \"chief\" to escort him into the fort.  He wanted me to get down and \"talk\" I told him that I had no \"talk\" in me, but that, on his reaching the post, he could talk as much as he pleased with the \"big chief,\" Major Childs.  They all seemed to be indifferent, and in no hurry; and I noticed that all their guns were leaning against a tree.  I beckoned to the sergeant, who advanced rapidly with his escort, and told him to secure the rifles, which he proceeded to do.  Coacoochee pretended to be very angry, but I explained to him that his warriors were tired and mine were not, and that the soldiers would carry the guns on their horses.  I told him I would provide him a horse to ride, and the sooner he was ready the better for all.  He then stripped, washed himself in the pond, and began to dress in all his Indian finery, which consisted of buckskin leggins, moccasins, and several shirts. He then began to put on vests, one after another, and one of them had the marks of a bullet, just above the pocket, with the stain of blood.  In the pocket was a one-dollar Tallahassee Bank note, and the rascal had the impudence to ask me to give him silver coin for that dollar.  He had evidently killed the wearer, and was disappointed because the pocket contained a paper dollar instead of one in silver.  In due time he was dressed with turban and ostrich-feathers, and mounted the horse reserved for him, and thus we rode back together to Fort Pierce.  Major Childs and all the officers received him on the porch, and there we had a regular \""]]]
