I heard that a very devout man was to preach the next Sabbath in the Presbyterian church; I therefore went to meeting, in the full expectation of hearing that which my soul desired--the Word of Life.  When the minister commenced speaking, I fixed my mind with deep attention upon the spirit and matter of his discourse; but after hearing him through, I returned home, convinced that he neither understood nor appreciated the subject upon which he spoke, and I said in my heart that there was not then upon earth the religion which I sought. I therefore determined to examine my Bible, and, taking Jesus and his disciples for my guide, to endeavor to obtain from God that which man could neither give nor take away. Notwithstanding this, I would hear all that could be said, as well as read much that was written, on the subject of religion; but the Bible I intended should be my guide to life and salvation. This course I pursued a number of years.  At length, I considered it my duty to be baptized, and, finding a minister who was willing to baptize me, and leave me free in regard to joining any religious denomination, I stepped forward and yielded obedience to this ordinance; after which I continued to read the Bible as formerly, until my eldest son had attained his twenty-second year.    CHAPTER XII.  JOSEPH SMITH, SENIOR, LOSES HIS PROPERTY AND BECOMES POOR--RECEIVES A VISIT PROM JASON MACK--THE HISTORY OP THE LATTER CONCLUDED.  My husband, as before stated, followed merchandising for a short period in the town of Randolph. Soon after he commenced business in this place, he ascertained that crystalized ginseng root sold very high in China, being used as a remedy for the plague, which was then raging there.  He therefore concluded to embark in a traffic of this article, and consequently made an investment of all the means which he commanded, in that way and manner which was necessary to carry on a business of this kind, viz., crystalizing and exporting the root. When he had obtained a quantity of the same, a merchant by the name of Stevens, of Royalton, offered him three thousand dollars for what he had; but my husband refused his offer, as it was only about two-thirds of its real value, and told the gentleman that he would rather venture shipping it himself.  My husband, in a short time, went to the city of New York, with the view of shipping his ginseng, and finding a vessel in port which was soon to set sail, he made arrangements with the captain to this effect--that he was to sell the ginseng in China, and return the avails thereof to my husband; and this the captain bound himself to do, in a written obligation.  Mr. Stevens, hearing that Mr. Smith was making arrangements to ship his ginseng, repaired immediately to New York, and by taking some pains, he ascertained the vessel on board of which Mr. Smith had shipped his ginseng; and having some of the same article on hand himself, he made arrangements with the captain to take his also, and he was to send his son on board the vessel to take charge of it.  It appears, from circumstances that afterwards transpired, that the ginseng was taken to China, and sold there to good advantage, or at a high price, but not to much advantage to us, for we never received any thing, except a small chest of tea, of the avails arising from this adventure.  When the vessel returned, Stevens, the younger, also returned with it, and when my husband became apprized of his arrival, he went immediately to him and made inquiry respecting the success of the captain in selling his ginseng. Mr. Stevens told him quite a plausible tale, the particulars of which I have forgotten; but the amount of it was, that the sale had been a perfect failure, and the only thing which had been brought for Mr. Smith from China was a small chest of tea, which chest had been delivered into his care, for my husband.  In a short time after this, young Stevens hired a house of Major Mack, and employed eight or ten hands and commenced the business of crystalizing ginseng. Soon after engaging in this business, when he had got fairly at work, my brother, Major Mack, went to see him, and, as it happened, he found him considerably intoxicated. When my brother came into his presence, he spoke to him thus, \"Well, Mr. Stevens, you are doing a fine business; you will soon be ready for another trip to China.\" Then observed again, in a quite indifferent manner, \"Oh, Mr. Stevens, how much did Brother Smith's adventure bring?\" Being under the influence of liquor, he was not on his guard, and took my brother by the hand and led him to a trunk; then opening it, he observed, \"There, sir, are the proceeds of Mr. Smith's ginseng!\" exhibiting a large amount of silver and gold.  My brother was much astounded at this; however, he disguised his feelings, and conversed with him a short time upon different subjects, then returned home, and about ten o'clock the same night he started for Randolph, to see my husband.  When Mr. Stevens had overcome his intoxication, he began to reflect upon what he had done, and making some inquiry concerning my brother, he ascertained that he had gone to Randolph. Mr. Stevens, conjecturing his business--that he had gone to see my husband respecting the ginseng adventure, went immediately to his establishment, dismissed his hands, called his carriage, and fled with his cash for Canada, and I have never heard anything concerning him since.  My husband pursued him a while, but finding pursuit vain, returned home much dispirited at the state of his affairs. He then went to work to overhaul his accounts, in order to see how he stood with the world; upon which he discovered that, in addition to the loss sustained by the China adventure, he had lost about two thousand dollars in bad debts. At the time he sent his venture to China he was owing eighteen hundred dollars in the city of Boston, for store goods, and he expected to discharge the debt at the return of the China expedition; but, having invested almost all his means in ginseng, the loss which he suffered in this article rendered it impossible for him to pay his debt with the property which remained in his hands. The principal dependence left him, in the shape of property, was the farm at Tunbridge, upon which we were then living, having moved back to this place immediately after his venture was sent to China. This farm, which was worth about fifteen hundred dollars, my husband sold for eight hundred dollars, in order to make a speedy payment on the Boston debt; and, as I had not used the check of one thousand dollars, which my brother and Mr. Mudget gave me, I added it to the eight hundred dollars obtained for the farm, and by this means the whole debt was liquidated.  While we were living on the Tunbridge farm, my brother Jason made us a visit. He brought with him a young man by the name of William Smith, a friendless orphan, whom he had adopted as his own son, and, previous to this time, had kept constantly with him; but he now thought best to leave him with us, for the purpose of having him go to school. He remained with us, however, only six months before my brother came again and took him to New Brunswick, which they afterwards made their home, and where my brother had gathered together some thirty families, on a tract of land which he had purchased for the purpose of assisting poor persons to the means of sustaining themselves. He planned their work for them, and when they raised anything which they wished to sell, he took it to market for them. Owning a schooner himself, he took their produce to Liverpool, as it was then the best market.  When Jason set out on the above-mentioned visit to Tunbridge, he purchased a quantity of goods, which he intended as presents for his friends, especially his mother and sisters; but, on his way thither, he found so many objects of charity, that he gave away not only the goods, but most of his money. On one occasion, he saw a woman who had just lost her husband, and who was very destitute; he gave her fifteen dollars in money, and a full suit of clothes for herself and each of her children, which were six in number.  This was the last interview I ever had with my brother Jason, but, twenty years later, he wrote the following letter to my brother Solomon, and that is about all the intelligence I have ever received from him since I saw him:      South Branch of Ormucto, Province of New Brunswick,      June 30, 1835.      My Dear Brother Solomon:      You will, no doubt, be surprised to hear that I am still alive,     although in an absence of twenty years I have never written to you     before. But I trust you will forgive me when I tell you that, for     most of the twenty years, I have been so situated that I have had     little or no communication with the lines, and have been holding     meetings, day and night, from place to place; besides, my mind     has been so taken up with the deplorable situation of the earth,     the darkness in which it lies, that, when my labors did call me     near the lines, I did not realize the opportunity which presented     itself of letting you know where I was. And, again, I have designed     visiting you long since, and annually have promised myself that     the succeeding year I would certainly seek out my relatives, and     enjoy the privilege of one pleasing interview with them before     I passed into the valley and shadow of death. But last, though     not least, let me not startle you when I say, that, according to     my early adopted principles of the power of faith, the Lord has,     in his exceeding kindness, bestowed upon me the gift of healing     by the prayer of faith, and the use of such simple means as seem     congenial to the human system; but my chief reliance is upon him     who organized us at the first, and can restore at pleasure that     which is disorganized.      The first of my "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45619"],["title","History of the Prophet Joseph, (#8)"],["body","successes in this way was twelve years     since, and from nearly that date I have had little rest. In     addition to the incessant calls which I, in a short time had, there     was the most overwhelming torrent of opposition poured down upon     me that I ever witnessed. But it pleased God to take the weak to     confound the wisdom of the wise. I have in the last twelve years     seen the greatest manifestations of the power of God in healing     the sick, that, with all my sanguinity, I ever hoped or imagined.     And when the learned infidel has declared with sober face, time     and again, that disease had obtained such an ascendency that death     could be resisted no longer, that the victim must wither beneath     his potent arm, I have seen the almost lifeless clay slowly but     surely resuscitated, and revive, till the pallid monster fled so     far that the patient was left in the full bloom of vigorous health.     But it is God that hath done it, and to him let all the praise be     given.      I am now compelled to close this epistle, for I must start     immediately on a journey of more than one hundred miles, to attend     a heavy case of sickness; so God be with you all. Farewell!      Jason Mack.  The next intelligence we received concerning Jason, after his letter to Brother Solomon, was, that he, his wife, and oldest son, were dead, and this concludes my account of my brother Jason.    CHAPTER XIII.  THE AUTHOR'S DREAM.  While we were living in the town of Tunbridge, my mind became deeply impressed with the subject of religion; which, probably, was occasioned by my singular experience during my sickness at Randolph. I commenced attending Methodist meetings, and in order to oblige me, my husband accompanied me; but when this came to the ears of his oldest brother, he was so displeased, and said so much in regard to the matter, that my husband thought it best to desist. He said that he considered it hardly worth our while to attend the meetings any longer, as it would prove of but little advantage to us; besides this, it gave our friends such disagreeable feelings. I was considerably hurt by this, yet I made no reply. I retired to a grove not far distant, where I prayed to the Lord in behalf of my husband--that the true gospel might be presented to him, and that his heart might be softened so as to receive it, or, that he might become more religiously inclined. After praying some time in this manner, I returned to the house, much depressed in spirit, which state of feeling continued until I retired to my bed. I soon fell asleep, and had the following dream:--      I thought that I stood in a large and beautiful meadow, which     lay a short distance from the house in which we lived, and that     everything around me wore an aspect of peculiar pleasantness. The     first thing that attracted my special attention in this magnificent     meadow, was a very pure and clear stream of water, which ran     through the midst of it; and as I traced this stream, I discovered     two trees standing upon its margin, both of which were on the same     side of the stream. These trees were very beautiful, they were well     proportioned, and towered with majestic beauty to a great height.     Their branches, which added to their symmetry and glory, commenced     near the top, and spread themselves in luxurious grandeur around.     I gazed upon them with wonder and admiration; and after beholding     them a short time, I saw one of them was surrounded with a bright     belt, that shone like burnished gold, but far more brilliantly.     Presently, a gentle breeze passed by, and the tree encircled with     this golden zone, bent gracefully before the wind, and waved its     beautiful branches in the light air. As the wind increased, this     tree assumed the most lively and animated appearance, and seemed to     express in its motions the utmost joy and happiness. If it had been     an intelligent creature, it could not have conveyed, by the power     of language, the idea of joy and gratitude so perfectly as it did;     and even the stream that rolled beneath it, shared, apparently,     every sensation felt by the tree, for, as the branches danced over     the stream, it would swell gently, then recede again with a motion     as soft as the breathing of an infant, but as lively as the dancing     of a sunbeam. The belt also partook of the same influence, and, as     it moved in unison with the motion of the stream and of the tree,     it increased continually in refulgence and magnitude, until it     became exceedingly glorious.      I turned my eyes upon its fellow, which stood opposite; but it was     not surrounded with the belt of light as the former, and it stood     erect and fixed as a pillar of marble. No matter how strong the     wind blew over it, not a leaf was stirred, not a bough was bent;     but obstinately stiff it stood, scorning alike the zephyr's breath,     or the power of the mighty storm.      I wondered at what I saw, and said in my heart, What can be the     meaning of all this? And the interpretation given me was, that     these personated my husband and his oldest brother, Jesse Smith;     that the stubborn and unyielding tree was like Jesse; that the     other, more pliant and flexible, was like Joseph, my husband;     that the breath of heaven? which passed over them, was the pure     and undefiled gospel of the Son of God, which gospel Jesse would     always resist, but which Joseph, when he was more advanced in life,     would hear and receive with his whole heart, and rejoice therein;     and unto him would be added intelligence, happiness, glory, and     everlasting life.    CHAPTER XIV.  FIRST VISION OP JOSEPH SMITH, SENIOR--THE BOX--SECOND VISION--THE TREE AND THE SPACIOUS BUILDING.  After selling the farm at Tunbridge, we moved only a short distance, to the town of Royalton. Here we resided a few months, then moved again to Sharon, Windsor county, Vermont. In the latter place, my husband rented a farm of my father, which he cultivated in the summer, teaching school in the winter. In this way my husband continued laboring for a few years, during which time our circumstances gradually improved, until we found ourselves quite comfortable again.  In the meantime, we had a son whom we called Joseph, after the name of his father; he was born December 23, 1805. I shall speak of him more particularly by and by.  We moved thence to Tunbridge. Here we had another son, whom we named Samuel Harrison, born March 13, 1808. We lived in this place a short time, then moved to Royalton, where Ephraim was born, March 13, 1810. We continued here until we had another son, born March 13, 1811, whom we called William.  About this time my husband's mind became much excited upon the subject of religion; yet he would not subscribe to any particular system of faith, but contended for the ancient order, as established by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and his Apostles.  One night my husband retired to his bed, in a very thoughtful state of mind, contemplating the situation of the Christian religion, or the confusion and discord that were extant. He soon fell into a sleep, and before waking had the following vision, which I shall relate in his own words, just as he told it to me the next morning:--      \"I seemed to be traveling in an open, barren field, and as I was     traveling, I turned my eyes towards the east, the west, the north     and the south, but could see nothing save dead, fallen timber.     Not a vestige of life, either animal or vegetable, could be seen;     besides, to render the scene still more dreary, the most death-like     silence prevailed, no sound of anything animate could be heard     in all the field. I was alone in this gloomy desert, with the     exception of an attendant spirit, who kept constantly by my side.     Of him I inquired the meaning of what I saw, and why I was thus     traveling in such a dismal place. He answered thus: 'This field     is the world, which now lieth inanimate and dumb, in regard to     the true religion, or plan of salvation; but travel on, and by     the wayside you will find on a certain log a box, the contents of     which, if you eat thereof, will make you wise, and give unto you     wisdom and understanding.' I carefully observed what was told me     by my guide, and proceeding a short distance, I came to the box. I     immediately took it up, and placed it under my left arm; then with     eagerness I raised the lid, and began to taste of its contents;     upon which all manner of beasts, horned cattle, and roaring     animals, rose up on every side in the most threatening manner     possible, tearing the earth, tossing their horns, and bellowing     most terrifically all around me, and they finally came so close     upon me, that I was compelled to drop the box, and fly for my life.     Yet, in the midst, of all this I was perfectly happy though I awoke     trembling.\"  From this forward, my husband seemed more confirmed than ever, in the opinion that there was no order or class of religionists that knew any more concerning the Kingdom of God, than those of the world, or such as made no profession of religion whatever.  In 1811, we moved from Royalton, Vermont, to the town of Lebanon, New Hampshire. Soon after arriving here, my husband received another very singular vision, which I will relate:--      \"I thought,\" said he, \"I was traveling in an open, desolate field,     which appeared to be very barren. As I was thus traveling, the     thought suddenly came into my mind that I had better stop and     reflect upon what I was doing, before I went any further. So I     asked myself, 'What motive can I have in traveling here, and what     place can this be?' My guide, who was by my side, as before, said,     'This is the desolate world; but travel on.' The road was so broad     and barren, that I wondered why I should travel in it;"]]]
