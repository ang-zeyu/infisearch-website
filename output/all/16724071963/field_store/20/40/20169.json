'It may seem to me that when a daughter gets married--addio! she is nothing but her husband.'  'Ay! ay! if it might be so!' the signora wailed out.  The count hated tears, considering them a clog to all useful machinery. He was departing, when through the open window a noise of scuffling in the street below arrested him.  'Has it commenced?' he said, starting.  'What?' asked the signora, coolly; and made him pause.  'But-but-but!' he answered, and had the grace to spare her ears.  The thought in him was: 'But that I had some faith in my wife, and don't admire the devil sufficiently, I would accuse him point-blank, for, by Bacchus! you are as clever as he.'  It is a point in the education of parents that they should learn to apprehend humbly the compliment of being outwitted by their own offspring.  Count Serabiglione leaned out of the window and saw that his horses were safe and the coachman handy.  There were two separate engagements going on between angry twisting couples.  'Is there a habitable town in Italy?' the count exclaimed frenziedly. First he called to his coachman to drive away, next to wait as if nailed to the spot.  He cursed the revolutionary spirit as the mother of vices. While he was gazing at the fray, the door behind him opened, as he knew by the rush of cool air which struck his temples.  He fancied that his daughter was hurrying off in obedience to a signal, and turned upon her just as Laura was motioning to a female figure in the doorway to retire.  'Who is this?' said the count.  A veil was over the strange lady's head.  She was excited, and breathed quickly.  The count brought forward a chair to her, and put on his best court manner.  Laura caressed her, whispering, ere she replied: 'The Signorina Vittoria Romana!--Biancolla!--Benarriva!' and numerous other names of inventive endearment.  But the count was too sharp to be thrown off the scent.  'Aha!' he said, 'do I see her one evening before the term appointed?' and bowed profoundly.  'The Signorina Vittoria!'  She threw up her veil.  'Success is certain,' he remarked and applauded, holding one hand as a snuff-box for the fingers of the other to tap on.  'Signor Conte, you--must not praise me before you have heard me.'  'To have seen you!'  'The voice has a wider dominion, Signor Conte.'  'The fame of the signorina's beauty will soon be far wider.  Was Venus a cantatrice?'  She blushed, being unable to continue this sort of Mayfly-shooting dialogue, but her first charming readiness had affected the proficient social gentleman very pleasantly, and with fascinated eyes he hummed and buzzed about her like a moth at a lamp.  Suddenly his head dived: 'Nothing, nothing, signorina,' he said, brushing delicately at her dress; 'I thought it might be paint.' He smiled to reassure her, and then he dived again, murmuring: 'It must be something sticking to the dress. Pardon me.'  With that he went to the bell.  'I will ring up my daughter's maid.  Or Laura--where is Laura?'  The Signora Piaveni had walked to the window.  This antiquated fussiness of the dilettante little nobleman was sickening to her.  'Probably you expect to discover a revolutionary symbol in the lines of the signorina's dress,' she said.  'A revolutionary symbol!--my dear! my dear!'  The count reproved his daughter.  'Is not our signorina a pure artist, accomplishing easily three octaves? aha!  Three!' and he rubbed his hands.  'But, three good octaves!' he addressed Vittoria seriously and admonishingly.  'It is a fortune-millions!  It is precisely the very grandest heritage!  It is an army!'  'I trust that it may be!' said Vittoria, with so deep and earnest a ring of her voice that the count himself, malicious as his ejaculations had been, was astonished.  At that instant Laura cried from the window: 'These horses will go mad.'  The exclamation had the desired effect.  'Eh?--pardon me, signorina,' said the count, moving half-way to the window, and then askant for his hat.  The clatter of the horses' hoofs sent him dashing through the doorway, at which place his daughter stood with his hat extended.  He thanked and blessed her for the kindly attention, and in terror lest the signorina should think evil of him as 'one of the generation of the hasty,' he said, 'Were it anything but horses! anything but horses! one's horses!--ha!'  The audible hoofs called him off.  He kissed the tips of his fingers, and tripped out.  The signora stepped rapidly to the window, and leaning there, cried a word to the coachman, who signalled perfect comprehension, and immediately the count's horses were on their hind-legs, chafing and pulling to right and left, and the street was tumultuous with them. She flung down the window, seized Vittoria's cheeks in her two hands, and pressed the head upon her bosom.  'He will not disturb us again,' she said, in quite a new tone, sliding her hands from the cheeks to the shoulders and along the arms to the fingers'-ends, which they clutched lovingly.  'He is of the old school, friend of my heart! and besides, he has but two pairs of horses, and one he keeps in Vienna.  We live in the hope that our masters will pay us better!  Tell me! you are in good health?  All is well with you?  Will they have to put paint on her soft cheeks to-morrow?  Little, if they hold the colour as full as now?  My Sandra! amica! should I have been jealous if Giacomo had known you?  On my soul, I cannot guess!  But, you love what he loved.  He seems to live for me when they are talking of Italy, and you send your eyes forward as if you saw the country free.  God help me! how I have been containing myself for the last hour and a half!'  The signora dropped in a seat and laughed a languid laugh.  'The little ones?  I will ring for them.  Assunta shall bring them down in their night-gowns if they are undressed; and we will muffle the windows, for my little man will be wanting his song; and did you not promise him the great one which is to raise Italy-his mother, from the dead?  Do you remember our little fellow's eyes as he tried to see the picture?  I fear I force him too much, and there's no need-not a bit.'  The time was exciting, and the signora spoke excitedly.  Messing and Reggio were in arms.  South Italy had given the open signal.  It was near upon the hour of the unmasking of the great Lombard conspiracy, and Vittoria, standing there, was the beacon-light of it.  Her presence filled Laura with transports of exultation; and shy of displaying it, and of the theme itself, she let her tongue run on, and satisfied herself by smoothing the hand of the brave girl on her chin, and plucking with little loving tugs at her skirts.  In doing this she suddenly gave a cry, as if stung.  'You carry pins,' she said.  And inspecting the skirts more closely, 'You have a careless maid in that creature Giacinta; she lets paper stick to your dress.  What is this?'  Vittoria turned her head, and gathered up her dress to see.  'Pinned with the butterfly!' Laura spoke under her breath.  Vittoria asked what it meant.  'Nothing--nothing,' said her friend, and rose, pulling her eagerly toward the lamp.  A small bronze butterfly secured a square piece of paper with clipped corners to her dress.  Two words were written on it:--                           'SEI SOSPETTA.'     CHAPTER XII  THE BRONZE BUTTERFLY  The two women were facing one another in a painful silence when Carlo Ammiani was announced to them.  He entered with a rapid stride, and struck his hands together gladly at sight of Vittoria.  Laura met his salutation by lifting the accusing butterfly attached to Vittoria's dress.  'Yes; I expected it,' he said, breathing quick from recent exertion. 'They are kind--they give her a personal warning.  Sometimes the dagger heads the butterfly.  I have seen the mark on the Play-bills affixed to the signorina's name.'  'What does it mean?' said Laura, speaking huskily, with her head bent over the bronze insect.  'What can it mean?' she asked again, and looked up to meet a covert answer.  'Unpin it.' Vittoria raised her arms as if she felt the thing to be enveloping her.  The signora loosened the pin from its hold; but dreading lest she thereby sacrificed some possible clue to the mystery, she hesitated in her action, and sent an intolerable shiver of spite through Vittoria's frame, at whom she gazed in a cold and cruel way, saying, 'Don't tremble.'  And again, 'Is it the doing of that 'garritrice magrezza,' whom you call 'la Lazzeruola?'  Speak.  Can you trace it to her hand?  Who put the plague- mark upon you?'  Vittoria looked steadily away from her.  'It means just this,' Carlo interposed; 'there! now it 's off; and, signorina, I entreat you to think nothing of it,--it means that any one who takes a chief part in the game we play, shall and must provoke all fools, knaves, and idiots to think and do their worst.  They can't imagine a pure devotion.  Yes, I see--\"Sei sospetta.\"  They would write their 'Sei sospetta' upon St. Catherine in the Wheel.  Put it out of your mind.  Pass it.'  'But they suspect her; and why do they suspect her?'  Laura questioned vehemently.  'I ask, is it a Conservatorio rival, or the brand of one of the Clubs?  She has no answer.'  'Observe.' Carlo laid the paper under her eyes.  Three angles were clipped, the fourth was doubled under.  He turned it back and disclosed the initials B. R.  'This also is the work of our man- devil, as I thought.  I begin to think that we shall be eternally thwarted, until we first clear our Italy of its vermin.  Here is a weazel, a snake, a tiger, in one.  They call him the Great Cat.  He fancies himself a patriot,--he is only a conspirator.  I denounce him, but he gets the faith of people, our Agostino among them, I believe. The energy of this wretch is terrific.  He has the vigour of a fasting saint.  Myself--I declare it to you, signora, with shame, I know what it is to fear this man.  He has Satanic blood, and the worst is,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4437"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 3 (#0)"],["body","By George Meredith    BOOK 3.  XIV.      AT THE MAESTRO'S DOOR XV.       AMMIANI THROUGH THE MIDNIGHT XVI.      COUNTESS AMMIANI XVII.     IN THE PIAZZA D'ARMI XVIII.    THE NIGHT OF THE FIFTEENTH XIX.      THE PRIMA DONNA   CHAPTER XIV  AT THE MAESTRO'S DOOR  The house of the Maestro Rocco Ricci turned off the Borgo della Stella. Carlo Ammiani conducted Vittoria to the maestro's door.  They conversed very little on the way.  'You are a good swordsman?' she asked him abruptly.  'I have as much skill as belongs to a perfect intimacy with the weapon,' he answered.  'Your father was a soldier, Signor Carlo.'  'He was a General officer in what he believed to be the army of Italy. We used to fence together every day for two hours.'  'I love the fathers who do that,' said Vittoria.  After such speaking Ammiani was not capable of the attempt to preach peace and safety to her.  He postponed it to the next minute and the next.  Vittoria's spirit was in one of those angry knots which are half of the intellect, half of the will, and are much under the domination of one or other of the passions in the ascendant.  She was resolved to go forward; she felt justified in going forward; but the divine afflatus of enthusiasm buoyed her no longer, and she required the support of all that accuracy of insight and that senseless stubbornness which there might be in her nature.  The feeling that it was she to whom it was given to lift the torch and plant the standard of Italy, had swept her as through the strings of a harp.  Laura, and the horrible little bronze butterfly, and the 'Sei sospetta,' now made her duty seem dry and miserably fleshless, imaging itself to her as if a skeleton had been told to arise and walk: --say, the thing obeys, and fills a ghastly distension of men's eyelids for a space, and again lies down, and men get their breath: but who is the rosier for it? where is the glory of it? what is the good?  This Milan, and Verona, Padua, Vicenza, Brescia, Venice, Florence, the whole Venetian, Tuscan, and Lombardic lands, down to far Sicily, and that Rome which always lay under the crown of a dead sunset in her idea--they too might rise; but she thought of them as skeletons likewise.  Even the shadowy vision of Italy Free had no bloom on it, and stood fronting the blown trumpets of resurrection Lazarus-like.  At these moments young hearts, though full of sap and fire, cannot do common nursing labour for the little suckling sentiments and hopes, the dreams, the languors and the energies hanging about them for nourishment. Vittoria's horizon was within five feet of her.  She saw neither splendid earth nor ancient heaven; nothing save a breach to be stepped over in defiance of foes and (what was harder to brave) of friends.  Some wayward activity of old associations set her humming a quaint English tune, by which she was brought to her consciousness.  'Dear friend,' she said, becoming aware that there might be a more troubled depth in Ammiani's absence of speech than in her own.  'Yes?' said he, quickly, as for a sentence to follow.  None came, and he continued, 'The Signora Laura is also your friend.'  She rejoined coldly, 'I am not thinking of her.'  Vittoria had tried to utter what might be a word of comfort for him, and she found she had not a thought or an emotion.  Here she differed from Laura, who, if the mood to heal a favourite's little sore at any season came upon her, would shower out lively tendernesses and all cajoleries possible to the tongue of woman.  Yet the irritation of action narrowed Laura more than it did Vittoria; fevered her and distracted her sympathies.  Being herself a plaything at the time, she could easily play a part for others.  Vittoria had not grown, probably never would grow, to be so plastic off the stage. She was stringing her hand to strike a blow as men strike, and women when they do that cannot be quite feminine.  'How dull the streets are,' she remarked.  'They are, just now,' said Ammiani, thinking of them on the night to come convulsed with strife, and of her, tossed perhaps like a weed along the torrent of bloody deluge waters. Her step was so firm, her face so assured, that he could not fancy she realized any prospect of the sort, and it filled him with pity and a wretched quailing.  If I speak now I shall be talking like a coward, he said to himself: and he was happily too prudent to talk to her in that strain.  So he said nothing of peace and safety.  She was almost at liberty to believe that he approved the wisdom of her resolution.  At the maestro's door she thanked him for his escort, and begged for it further within an hour. 'And do bring me some chocolate.'  She struck her teeth together champing in a pretty hunger for it.  'I have no chocolate in my pocket, and I hardly know myself.'  'What will your Signor Antonio say?'  Vittoria filliped her fingers.  'His rule is over, and he is my slave: I am not his. I will not eat much; but some some I must have.'  Ammiani laughed and promised to obtain it.  'That is, if there's any to be had.'  'Break open doors to get it for me,' she said, stamping with fun to inspirit him.  No sooner was she standing alone, than her elbow was gently plucked at on the other side: a voice was sibilating: 'S-s-signorina.'  She allowed herself to be drawn out of the light of the open doorway, having no suspicion and no fear.  'Signorina, here is chocolate.'  She beheld two hands in cup-shape, surcharged with packets of Turin chocolate.  'Lugi, it is you?'  The Motterone spy screwed his eyelids to an expression of the shrewdest secresy.  'Hist! signorina.  Take some. You shall have all, but wait:--by-and-by. Aha! you look at my eyes as you did on the Monterone, because one of them takes the shoulder-view; but, the truth is, my father was a contrabandist, and had his eye in his ear when the frontier guard sent a bullet through his back, cotton-bags and cutleries, and all!  I inherit from him, and have been wry-eyed ever since.  How does that touch a man's honesty, signorina?  Not at all. Don't even suspect that you won't appreciate Luigi by-and-by.  So, you won't ask me a word, signorina, but up you go to the maestro:--signorina, I swear I am your faithful servant --up to the maestro, and down first.  Come down first not last:--first. Let the other one come down after you; and you come down first.  Leave her behind, la Lazzeruola; and here, 'Luigi displayed a black veil, the common head-dress of the Milanese women, and twisted his fingers round and round on his forehead to personate the horns of the veil; 'take it, signorina; you know how to wear it. Luigi and the saints watch over you.' Vittoria found herself left in possession of the veil and a packet of chocolate.  'If I am watched over by the saints and Luigi,' she thought, and bit at the chocolate.  When the door had closed upon her, Luigi resumed his station near it, warily casting his glances along the house-fronts, and moving his springy little legs like a heath-cock alert.  They carried him sharp to an opposite corner of the street at a noise of some one running exposed to all eyes right down the middle of the road, straight to the house: in which foolish person he discerned Beppo, all of whose proceedings Luigi observed and commented on from the safe obscurity under eaves and starlight, while Beppo was in the light of the lamps.  'You thunder at the door, my Beppo.  You are a fire-balloon: you are going to burn yourself up with what you carry.  You think you can do something, because you read books and frequent the talking theatres--fourteen syllables to a word.  Mother of heaven! will you never learn anything from natural intelligence?  There you are, in at the door.  And now you will disturb the signorina, and you will do nothing but make la Lazzeruola's ears lively.  Bounce! you are up the stairs.  Bounce! you are on the landing. Thrum! you drum at the door, and they are singing; they don't hear you. And now you're meek as a mouse.  That's it--if you don't hit the mark when you go like a bullet, you 're stupid as lead.  And they call you a clever fellow!  Luigi's day is to come.  When all have paid him all round, they will acknowledge Luigi's worth.  You are honest enough, my Beppo; but you might as well be a countryman.  You are the signorina's servant, but I know the turnings, said the rat to the cavaliere weazel.'  In a few minutes Beppo stepped from the house, and flung himself with his back against the lintel of the doorway.  'That looks like determination to stop on guard,' said Luigi.  He knew the exact feeling expressed by it, when one has come violently on an errand and has done no good.  'A flea, my feathery lad, will set you flying again.'  As it was imperative in Luigi's schemes that Beppo should be set flying again, he slipped away stealthily, and sped fast into the neighbouring Corso, where a light English closed carriage, drawn by a pair of the island horses, moved at a slow pace.  Two men were on the driver's seat, one of whom Luigi hailed to come down then he laid a strip of paper on his knee, and after thumping on the side of his nose to get a notion of English-Italian, he wrote with a pencil, dancing upon one leg all the while for a balance:--       'Come, Beppo, daughter sake, now, at once, immediate,      Beppo, signor.'  'That's to the very extremity how the little signora Inglese would write,' said Luigi; yet cogitating profoundly in a dubitative twinkle of a second as to whether it might not be the English habit to wind up a hasty missive with an expediting oath.  He had heard the oath of emphasis in that island: but he decided to let it go as it stood.  The man he had summoned was directed to take it straightway and deliver it to one who would be found at the house-door of the Maestro Rocco Ricci.  'Thus, like a drunken sentinel,' said Luigi, folding his arms, crossing his legs, and leaning back.  'Forward, Matteo, my cherub.'  'All goes right?' the"]]]
