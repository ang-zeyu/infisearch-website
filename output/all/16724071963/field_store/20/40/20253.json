There isn't a doctor in Bingville who isn't working eighteen hours a day. I met a minister this afternoon who hasn't had ten hours of sleep in a week--he's been so busy with the sick, and the dying and the dead. He is a nurse, a friend, a comforter to any one who needs him. No charge for overtime. My God! Are we all going money mad? Are you any better than he is, or I am, or than these doctors are who have been killing themselves with overwork? Do you dare to tell me that prosperity is any excuse for idleness in this land of ours, if one's help is needed?\"  Judge Crooker's voice had been calm, his manner dignified. But the last sentences had been spoken with a quiet sternness and with his long, bony forefinger pointing straight at Mr. Sneed. The other members of the committee clapped their hands in hearty approval. Mr. Sneed smiled and brushed his trousers.  \"I guess you're right,\" he said. \"We're all off our balance a little, but what is to be done now?\"  \"We must quit our plumbing and carpentering and lawyering and banking and some of us must quit merchandising and sitting in the chimney corner and grab our saws and axes and go out into the woods and make some fuel and get it hauled into town,\" said Judge Crooker. \"I'll be one of a party to go to-morrow with my axe. I haven't forgotten how to chop.\"  The committee thought this a good suggestion. They all rose and started on a search for volunteers, except Mr. Sneed. He tarried saying to the Judge that he wished to consult him on a private matter. It was, indeed, just then, a matter which could not have been more public although, so far, the news of it had traveled in whispers. The Judge had learned the facts since his return.  \"I hope your plumbing hasn't gone wrong,\" he remarked with a smile.  \"No, it's worse than that,\" said Mr. Sneed ruefully.  They bade the little Shepherd good night and went down-stairs where the widow was still at work with her washing, although it was nine o'clock.  \"Faithful woman!\" the Judge exclaimed as they went out on the street. \"What would the world do without people like that? No extra charge for overtime either.\"  Then, as they walked along, he cunningly paved the way for what he knew was coming.  \"Did you notice the face of that boy?\" he asked.  \"Yes, it's a wonderful face,\" said Israel Sneed.  \"It's a God's blessing to see a face like that,\" the Judge went on. \"Only the pure in heart can have it. The old spirit of youth looks out of his eyes--the spirit of my own youth. When I was fourteen, I think that my heart was as pure as his. So were the hearts of most of the boys I knew.\"  \"It isn't so now,\" said Mr. Sneed.  \"I fear it isn't,\" the Judge answered. \"There's a new look in the faces of the young. Every variety of evil is spread before them on the stage of our little theater. They see it while their characters are in the making, while their minds are like white wax. Everything that touches them leaves a mark or a smirch. It addresses them in the one language they all understand, and for which no dictionary is needed--pictures. The flower of youth fades fast enough, God knows, without the withering knowledge of evil. They say it's good for the boys and girls to know all about life. We shall see!\"   Mr. Sneed sat down with Judge Crooker in the handsome library of the latter and opened his heart. His son Richard, a boy of fifteen, and three other lads of the village, had been committing small burglaries and storing their booty in a cave in a piece of woods on the river bank near the village. A constable had secured a confession and recovered a part of the booty. Enough had been found to warrant a charge of grand larceny and Elisha Potts, whose store had been entered, was clamoring for the arrest of the boys.  \"It reminds me of that picture of the Robbers' Cave that was on the billboard of our school of crime a few weeks ago,\" said the Judge. \"I'm tired enough to lie down, but I'll go and see Elisha Potts. If he's abed, he'll have to get up, that's all. There's no telling what Potts has done or may do. Your plumbing is in bad shape, Mr. Sneed. The public sewer is backing into your cellar and in a case of that kind the less delay the better.\"  He went into the hall and put on his coat and gloves and took his cane out of the rack. He was sixty-five years of age that winter. It was a bitter night when even younger men found it a trial to leave the comfort of the fireside. Sneed followed in silence. Indeed, his tongue was shame-bound. For a moment, he knew not what to say.  \"I--I'm much o-obliged to you,\" he stammered as they went out into the cold wind. \"I-I don't care what it costs, either.\"  The Judge stopped and turned toward him.  \"Look here,\" he said. \"Money does not enter into this proceeding or any motive but the will to help a neighbor. In such a matter overtime doesn't count.\"  They walked in silence to the corner. There Sneed pressed the Judge's hand and tried to say something, but his voice failed him.  \"Have the boys at my office at ten o'clock to-morrow morning. I want to talk to them,\" said the kindly old Judge as he strode away in the darkness.     CHAPTER FIVE  IN WHICH J. PATTERSON BING BUYS A NECKLACE OF PEARLS   Meanwhile, the Bings had been having a busy winter in New York. J. Patterson Bing had been elected to the board of a large bank in Wall Street. His fortune had more than doubled in the last two years and he was now a considerable factor in finance.  Mrs. Bing had been studying current events and French and the English accent and other social graces every morning, with the best tutors, as she reclined comfortably in her bedchamber while Phyllis went to sundry shops. Mrs. Crooker had once said, \"Mamie Bing has a passion for self-improvement.\" It was mainly if not quite true.  Phyllis had been \"beating the bush\" with her mother at teas and dinners and dances and theaters and country house parties in and about the city. The speedometer on the limousine had doubled its mileage since they came to town. They were, it would seem, a tireless pair of hunters. Phyllis's portrait had appeared in the Sunday papers. It showed a face and form of unusual beauty. The supple grace and classic outlines of the latter were touchingly displayed at the dances in many a handsome ballroom. At last, they had found a promising and most eligible candidate in Roger Delane--a handsome stalwart youth, a year out of college. His father was a well-known and highly successful merchant of an old family which, for generations, had \"belonged\"--that is to say, it had been a part of the aristocracy of Fifth Avenue.  There could be no doubt of this great good luck of theirs--better, indeed, than Mrs. Bing had dared to hope for--the young man having seriously confided his intentions to J. Patterson. But there was one shadow on the glowing prospect; Phyllis had suddenly taken a bad turn. She moped, as her mother put it. She was listless and unhappy. She had lost her interest in the chase, so to speak. She had little heart for teas and dances and dinner parties. One day, her mother returned from a luncheon and found her weeping. Mrs. Bing went at once to the telephone and called for the stomach specialist. He came and made a brief examination and said that it was all due to rich food and late hours. He left some medicine, advised a day or two of rest in bed, charged a hundred dollars and went away. They tried the remedies, but Phyllis showed no improvement. The young man sent American Beauty roses and a graceful note of regret to her room.  \"You ought to be very happy,\" said her mother. \"He is a dear.\"  \"I know it,\" Phyllis answered. \"He's just the most adorable creature I ever saw in my life.\"  \"For goodness' sake! What is the matter of you? Why don't you brace up?\" Mrs. Bing asked with a note of impatience in her tone. \"You act like a dead fish.\"  Phyllis, who had been lying on the couch, rose to a sitting posture and flung one of the cushions at her mother, and rather swiftly.  \"How can I brace up?\" she asked with indignation in her eyes. \"Don't _you_ dare to scold me.\"  There was a breath of silence in which the two looked into each other's eyes. Many thoughts came flashing into the mind of Mrs. Bing. Why had the girl spoken the word \"you\" so bitterly? Little echoes of old history began to fill the silence. She arose and picked up the cushion and threw it on the sofa.  \"What a temper!\" she exclaimed. \"Young lady, you don't seem to know that these days are very precious for you. They will not come again.\"  Then, in the old fashion of women who have suddenly come out of a moment of affectionate anger, they fell to weeping in each other's arms. The storm was over when they heard the feet of J. Patterson Bing in the hall. Phyllis fled into the bathroom.  \"Hello!\" said Mr. Bing as he entered the door. \"I've found out what's the matter with Phyllis. It's nerves. I met the great specialist, John Hamilton Gibbs, at luncheon to-day. I described the symptoms. He says it's undoubtedly nerves. He has any number of cases just like this one--rest, fresh air and a careful diet are all that's needed. He says that if he can have her for two weeks, he'll guarantee a cure. I've agreed to have you take her to his sanitarium in the Catskills to-morrow. He has saddle horses, sleeping balconies, toboggan slides, snow-shoe and skating parties and all that.\"  \"I think it will be great,\" said Phyllis, who suddenly emerged from her hiding-place and embraced her father. \"I'd love it! I'm sick of this old town. I'm sure it's just what I need.\"  \"I couldn't go to-morrow,\" said Mrs. Bing. \"I simply must go to Mrs. Delane's luncheon.\"  \"Then I'll ask Harriet to go up with her,\" said J. Patterson.  Harriet, who lived in a flat on the upper west side, was Mr. Bing's sister.  Phyllis went to bed dinnerless with a headache. Mr. and Mrs. Bing sat for a long time"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/448"],["title","The Psychology of Revolution (#0)"],["body","by Charles Keller with OmniPage Professional OCR software donated by Caere Corporation, 1-800-535-7226.

Having recognised that there are no phenomena of which the first cause is still accessible, science has resumed the examination of her ancient certitudes, and has proved their fragility.  To-day she sees her ancient principles vanishing one by one.  Mechanics is losing its axioms, and matter, formerly the eternal substratum of the worlds, becomes a simple aggregate of ephemeral forces in transitory condensation.  Despite its conjectural side, by virtue of which it to some extent escapes the severest form of criticism, history has not been free from this universal revision.  There is no longer a single one of its phases of which we can say that it is certainly known.  What appeared to be definitely acquired is now once more put in question.  Among the events whose study seemed completed was the French Revolution.  Analysed by several generations of writers, one might suppose it to be perfectly elucidated.  What new thing can be said of it, except in modification of some of its details?  And yet its most positive defenders are beginning to hesitate in their judgments.  Ancient evidence proves to be far from impeccable.  The faith in dogmas once held sacred is shaken.  The latest literature of the Revolution betrays these uncertainties. Having related, men are more and more chary of drawing conclusions.  Not only are the heroes of this great drama discussed without indulgence, but thinkers are asking whether the new dispensation which followed the ancien regime would not have established itself naturally, without violence, in the course of progressive civilisation.  The results obtained no longer seem in correspondence either with their immediate cost or with the remoter consequences which the Revolution evoked from the possibilities of history.  Several causes have led to the revision of this tragic period. Time has calmed passions, numerous documents have gradually emerged from the archives, and the historian is learning to interpret them independently.  But it is perhaps modern psychology that has most effectually influenced"]]]
