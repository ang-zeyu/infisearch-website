She thought besides that this disguised officer, with the ill- looking eyes running into one, might easily, since he had heard her, be a devotee of her voice; and it flattered her yet more to imagine him as a capture from the enemy--a vanquished subservient Austrian.  She had seen him come on horseback; he had evidently followed her; and he knew what she now understood must be her destination.  Moreover, Laura had underlined 'it is an Austrian who rescues you.' This man perchance was the Austrian.  His precise manner of speech demanded an extreme repugnance, if it was to be resisted; Vittoria's reliance upon her own natural fortitude was much too secure for her to encourage the physical revulsions which certain hard faces of men create in the hearts of young women.  'Was all quiet in Milan?' she asked.  'Quiet as a pillow,' he said.  'And will continue to be?'  'Not a doubt of it.'  'Why is there not a doubt of it, signore?'  'You beat us Germans on one field.  On the other you have no chance.  But you must lose no time.  The Croats are on your track.  I have ordered out the carriage.'  The mention of the Croats struck her fugitive senses with a panic.  'I must wait for my maid,' she said, attempting to deliberate.  'Ha! you have a maid: of course you have!  Where is your maid?'  'She ought to have returned by this time.  If not, she is on the road.'  'On the road?  Good; we will pick up the maid on the road.  We have not a minute to spare.  Lady, I am your obsequious servant.  Hasten out, I beg of you.  I was taught at my school that minutes are not to be wasted. Those Croats have been drinking and what not on the way, or they would have been here before this.  You can't rely on Italian innkeepers to conceal you.'  'Signore, are you a man of honour?'  'Illustrious lady, I am.'  She listened simply to the response without giving heed to the prodigality of gesture.  The necessity for flight now that Milan was announced as lying quiet, had become her sole thought.  Angelo was standing by the carriage.  'What man is this?' said Herr Johannes, frowning.  'He is my servant,' said Vittoria.  'My dear good lady, you told me your servant was a maid.  This will never do.  We can't have him.'  'Excuse me, signore, I never travel without him.'  'Travel!  This is not a case of travelling, but running; and when you run, if you are in earnest about it, you must fling away your baggage and arms.'  Herr Johannes tossed out his moustache to right and left, and stamped his foot.  He insisted that the man should be left behind.  'Off, sir! back to Milan, or elsewhere,' he cried.  'Beppo, mount on the box,' said Vittoria.  Her command was instantly obeyed.  Herr Johannes looked her in the face. 'You are very decided, my dear lady.' He seemed to have lost his own decision, but handing Vittoria in, he drew a long cigar from his breastpocket, lit it, and mounted beside the coachman.  The chasseur had disappeared.  Vittoria entreated that a general look-out should be kept for Giacinta. The road was straight up an ascent, and she had no fear that her maid would not be seen.  Presently there was a view of the violet domes of a city.  'Is it Bergamo?--is it Brescia?' she longed to ask, thinking of her Bergamasc and Brescian friends, and of those two places famous for the bravery of their sons: one being especially dear to her, as the birthplace of a genius of melody, whose blood was in her veins.  'Did he look on these mulberry trees?--did he look on these green-grassed valleys?--did he hear these falling waters?' she asked herself, and closed her spirit with reverential thoughts of him and with his music. She saw sadly that they were turning from the city.  A little ball of paper was shot into her lap.  She opened it and read: 'An officer of the cavalry.--Beppo.'  She put her hand out of the window to signify that she was awake to the situation.  Her anxiety, however, began to fret.  No sight of Giacinta was to be had in any direction.  Her mistress commenced chiding the absent garrulous creature, and did so until she pitied her, when she accused herself of cowardice, for she was incapable of calling out to the coachman to stop.  The rapid motion subdued such energy as remained to her, and she willingly allowed her hurried feelings to rest on the faces of rocks impending over long ravines, and of perched old castles and white villas and sub-Alpine herds.  She burst from the fascination as from a dream, but only to fall into it again, reproaching her weakness, and saying, 'What a thing am I!'  When she did make her voice heard by Herr Johannes and the coachman, she was nervous and ashamed, and met the equivocating pacification of the reply with an assent half-way, though she was far from comprehending the consolation she supposed that it was meant to convey.  She put out her hand to communicate with Beppo.  Another ball of pencilled writing answered to it.  She read: 'Keep watch on this Austrian.  Your maid is two hours in the rear.  Refuse to be separated from me.  My life is at your service. --Beppo.'  Vittoria made her final effort to get a resolve of some sort; ending it with a compassionate exclamation over poor Giacinta.  The girl could soon find her way back to Milan.  On the other hand, the farther from Milan, the less the danger to Carlo's relative, in whom she now perceived a stronger likeness to her lover.  She sank back in the carriage and closed her eyes.  Though she smiled at the vanity of forcing sleep in this way, sleep came.  Her healthy frame seized its natural medicine to rebuild her after the fever of recent days.  She slept till the rocks were purple, and rose-purple mists were in the valleys.  The stopping of the carriage aroused her.  They were at the threshold of a large wayside hostelry, fronting a slope of forest and a plunging brook.  Whitecoats in all attitudes leaned about the door; she beheld the inner court full of them.  Herr Johannes was ready to hand her to the ground.  He said: 'You have nothing to fear.  These fellows are on the march to Cremona.  Perhaps it will be better if you are served up in your chamber.  You will be called early in the morning.'  She thanked him, and felt grateful.  'Beppo, look to yourself,' she said, and ran to her retirement.  'I fancy that 's about all that you are fit for,' Herr Johannes remarked, with his eyes on the impersonator of Beppo, who bore the scrutiny carelessly, and after seeing that Vittoria had left nothing on the carriage-seats, directed his steps to the kitchen, as became his functions.  Herr Johannes beckoned to a Tyrolese maid-servant, of whom Beppo had asked his way.  She gave her name as Katchen.  'Katchen, Katchen, my sweet chuck,' said Herr Johannes, 'here are ten florins for you, in silver, if you will get me the handkerchief of that man: you have just stretched your finger out for him.'  According to the common Austrian reckoning of them, Herr Johannes had adopted the right method for ensuring the devotion of the maidens of Tyrol.  She responded with an amazed gulp of her mouth and a grimace of acquiescence.  Ten florins in silver shortened the migratory term of the mountain girl by full three months.  Herr Johannes asked her the hour when the officers in command had supper, and deferred his own meal till that time.  Katchen set about earning her money.  With any common Beppo it would have been easy enough--simple barter for a harmless kiss.  But this Beppo appeared inaccessible; he was so courtly and so reserved; nor is a maiden of Tyrol a particularly skilled seductress.  The supper of the officers was smoking on the table when Herr Johannes presented himself among them, and very soon the inn was shaken with an uproar of greeting.  Katchen found Beppo listening at the door of the salle.  She clapped her hands upon him to drag him away.  'What right have you to be leaning your head there?' she said, and threatened to make his proceedings known.  Beppo had no jewel to give, little money to spare.  He had just heard Herr Johannes welcomed among the officers by a name that half paralyzed him.  'You shall have anything you ask of me if you will find me out in a couple of hours,' he said. Katchen nodded truce for that period, and saw her home in the Oberinnthal still nearer--twelve mountain goats and a cow her undisputed property. She found him out, though he had strayed through the court of the inn, and down a hanging garden to the borders of a torrent that drenched the air and sounded awfully in the dark ravine below.  He embraced her very mildly.  'One scream and you go,' he said; she felt the saving hold of her feet plucked from her, with all the sinking horror, and bit her under lip, as if keeping in the scream with bare stitches.  When he released her she was perfectly mastered.  'You do play tricks,' she said, and quaked.  'I play no tricks.  Tell me at what hour these soldiers march.'  'At two in the morning.'  'Don't be afraid, silly child: you're safe if you obey me.  At what time has our carriage been ordered?'  'At four.'  'Now swear to do this:--rouse my mistress at a quarter past two: bring her down to me.'  'Yes, yes,' said Kitchen, eagerly: 'give me your handkerchief, and she will follow me.  I do swear; that I do; by big St. Christopher! who's painted on the walls of our house at home.'  Beppo handed her sweet silver, which played a lively tune for her temporarily--vanished cow and goats.  Peering at her features in the starlight, he let her take the handkerchief from his pocket.  'Oh! what have you got in there?' she said.  He laid his finger across her mouth, bidding her return to the house.  'Dear heaven!'  Katchen went in murmuring; 'would I have gone out to that soft-looking young man if I had known he was a devil.'  Angelo Guidascarpi was aware that an officer without responsibility never sleeps faster than when his brothers-in"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4439"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 5 (#0)"],["body","By George Meredith    CONTENTS:  BOOK 5. XXVI.     THE DUEL IN THE PASS XXVII.    A NEW ORDEAL XXVIII.   THE ESCAPE OF ANGELO    CHAPTER XXVI  THE DUEL IN THE PASS  Meanwhile Captain Weisspriess had not been idle.  Standing at a blunt angle of the ways converging upon Vittoria's presumed destination, he had roused up the gendarmerie along the routes to Meran by Trent on one side, and Bormio on the other; and he soon came to the conclusion that she had rejected the valley of the Adige for the Valtelline, whence he supposed that she would be tempted either to cross the Stelvio or one of the passes into Southernmost Tyrol.  He was led to think that she would certainly bear upon Switzerland, by a course of reasoning connected with Angelo Guidascarpi, who, fleeing under the cross of blood, might be calculated on to push for the mountains of the Republic; and he might judging by the hazards--conduct the lady thither, to enjoy the fruits of crime and love in security.  The captain, when he had discovered Angelo's crest and name on the betraying handkerchief, had no doubts concerning the nature of their intimacy, and he was spurred by a new and thrice eager desire to capture the couple--the criminal for the purposes of justice, and the other because he had pledged his notable reputation in the chase of her.  The conscience of this man's vanity was extremely active.  He had engaged to conquer the stubborn girl, and he thought it possible that he might take a mistress from the patriot ranks, with a loud ha! ha! at revolutionists, and some triumph over his comrades.  And besides, he was the favourite of Countess Anna of Lenkenstein, who yet refused to bring her estates to him; she dared to trifle; she also was a woman who required rude lessons.  Weisspriess, a poor soldier bearing the heritage of lusty appetites, had an eye on his fortune, and served neither Mars alone nor Venus.  Countess Anna was to be among that company assembled at the Castle of Sonnenberg in Meran; and if, while introducing Vittoria there with a discreet and exciting reserve, he at the same time handed over the assassin of Count Paul, a fine harvest of praise and various pleasant forms of female passion were to be looked for--a rich vista of a month's intrigue; at the end of it possibly his wealthy lady, thoroughly tamed, for a wife, and redoubled triumph over his comrades. Without these successes, what availed the fame of the keenest swordsman in the Austrian army?--The feast as well as the plumes of vanity offered rewards for the able exercise of his wits.  He remained at the sub-Alpine inn until his servant Wilhelm (for whom he had despatched the duchess's chasseur, then in attendance on Vittoria) arrived from Milan, bringing his uniform.  The chasseur was directed on the Bormio line, with orders that he should cause the arrest of Vittoria only in the case of her being on the extreme limit of the Swiss frontier. Keeping his communications alert, Weisspriess bore that way to meet him. Fortune smiled on his strategy.  Jacob Baumwalder Feckelwitz--full of wine, and discharging hurrahs along the road--met him on the bridge over the roaring Oglio, just out of Edolo, and gave him news of the fugitives. 'Both of them were at the big hotel in Bormio,' said Jacob; 'and I set up a report that the Stelvio was watched; and so it is.'  He added that he thought they were going to separate; he had heard something to that effect; he believed that the young lady was bent upon crossing one of the passes to Meran.  Last night it had devolved on him to kiss away the tears of the young lady's maid, a Valtelline peasant-girl, who deplored the idea of an expedition over the mountains, and had, with the usual cat-like tendencies of these Italian minxes, torn his cheek in return for his assiduities.  Jacob displayed the pretty scratch obtained in the Herr Captain's service, and got his money for having sighted Vittoria and seen double.  Weisspriess decided in his mind that Angelo had now separated from her (or rather, she from him) for safety.  He thought it very probable that she would likewise fly to Switzerland.  Yet, knowing that there was the attraction of many friends for her at Meran, he conceived that he should act more prudently by throwing himself on that line, and he sped Jacob Baumwalder along the Valtelline by Val Viola, up to Ponte in the Engadine, with orders to seize her if he could see her, and have her conveyed to Cles, in Tyrol.  Vittoria being only by the gentlest interpretation of her conduct not under interdict, an unscrupulous Imperial officer might in those military times venture to employ the gendarmerie for his own purposes, if he could but give a plausible colour of devotion to the Imperial interests.  The chasseur sped lamentingly back, and Weisspriess, taking a guide from the skirting hamlet above Edolo, quitted the Val Camonica, climbed the Tonale, and reached Vermiglio in the branch valley of that name, scientifically observing the features of the country as he went.  At Vermiglio he encountered a brother officer of one of his former regiments, a fat major on a tour of inspection, who happened to be a week behind news of the army, and detained him on the pretext of helping him on his car--a mockery that drove Weisspriess to the perpetual reply, 'You are my superior officer,' which reduced the major to ask him whether he had been degraded a step.  As usual, Weisspriess was pushed to assert his haughtiness, backed by the shadow of his sword.  'I am a man with a family,' said the major, modestly.  'Then I shall call you my superior officer while they allow you to remain so,' returned Weisspriess, who scorned a married soldier.  'I aspired to the Staff once myself,' said the major.  'Unfortunately, I grew in girth--the wrong way for ambition.  I digest, I assimilate with a fatal ease.  Stout men are doomed to the obscurer paths.  You may quote Napoleon as a contrary instance.  I maintain positively that his day was over, his sun was eclipsed, when his valet had to loosen the buckles of his waistcoat and breech.  Now, what do you say?'  'I say,' Weisspriess replied, 'that if there's a further depreciation of the paper currency, we shall none of us have much chance of digesting or assimilating either--if I know at all what those processes mean.'  'Our good Lombard cow is not half squeezed enough,' observed the major, confidentially in tone.  'When she makes a noise--quick! the pail at her udders and work away; that's my advice.  What's the verse?--our Zwitterwitz's, I mean; the Viennese poet:--                \"Her milk is good-the Lombard cow;                Let her be noisy when she pleases                But if she kicks the pail, I vow,                We'll make her used to sharper squeezes:                We'll write her mighty deeds in CHEESES:                (That is, if she yields milk enow).\"  'Capital!  capital!' the major applauded his quotation, and went on to speak of 'that Zwitterwitz' as having served in a border regiment, after creating certain Court scandal, and of his carrying off a Wallach lady from her lord and selling her to a Turk, and turning Turk himself and keeping a harem.  Five years later he reappeared in Vienna with a volume of what he called 'Black Eagle Poems,' and regained possession of his barony.  'So far, so good,' said the major; 'but when he applied for his old commission in the army--that was rather too cool.'  Weisspriess muttered intelligibly, 'I've heard the remark, that you can't listen to a man five minutes without getting something out of him.'  'I don't know; it may be,' said the major, imagining that Weisspriess demanded some stronger flavours of gossip in his talk.  'There's no stir in these valleys.  They arrested, somewhere close on Trent yesterday afternoon, a fellow calling himself Beppo, the servant of an Italian woman--a dancer, I fancy.  They're on the lookout for her too, I'm told; though what sort of capers she can be cutting in Tyrol, I can't even guess.'  The major's car was journeying leisurely toward Cles.  'Whip that brute!' Weisspriess sang out to the driver, and begging the major's pardon, requested to know whither he was bound.  The major informed him that he hoped to sup in Trent.  'Good heaven! not at this pace,' Weisspriess shouted.  But the pace was barely accelerated, and he concealed his reasons for invoking speed.  They were late in arriving at Trent, where Weisspriess cast eye on the imprisoned wretch, who declared piteously that he was the trusted and innocent servant of the Signorina Vittoria, and had been visiting all the castles of Meran in search of her.  The captain's man Wilhelm had been the one to pounce on poor Beppo while the latter was wandering disconsolately.  Leaving him to howl, Weisspriess procured the loan of a horse from a colonel of cavalry at the Buon Consiglio barracks, and mounted an hour before dawn, followed by Wilhelm. He reached Cles in time to learn that Vittoria and her party had passed through it a little in advance of him.  Breakfasting there, he enjoyed the first truly calm cigar of many days.  Gendarmes whom he had met near the place came in at his heels.  They said that the party would positively be arrested, or not allowed to cross the Monte Pallade.  The passes to Meran and Botzen, and the road to Trent, were strictly guarded. Weisspriess hurried them forward with particular orders that they should take into custody the whole of the party, excepting the lady; her, if arrested with the others, they were to release: her maid and the three men were to be marched back to Cles, and there kept fast.  The game was now his own: he surveyed its pretty intricate moves as on a map.  The character of Herr Johannes he entirely discarded: an Imperial officer in his uniform, sword in belt, could scarcely continue that meek performance.  'But I may admire music, and entreat her to give me a particular note, if she has it,' said the captain,"]]]
