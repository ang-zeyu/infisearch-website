He was met three miles outside of the gate by the chiefs, and immediately requested their attendance in the house of one Bernardino di Parma, to receive his congratulations and thanks on their success. At the same time he desired quarters to be provided for their respective followings outside of the city, in order to admit his own army, amounting to two thousand cavalry and ten thousand infantry. Startled at the appearance of a force so disproportioned to the service in hand, they would gladly have demurred to this distribution of the troops, but Cesare had contrived that there should be no opportunity for remonstrance, and resistance would have obviously been too late. Affecting a confidence they were far from feeling, the leaders accepted the invitation, and were received with cordiality and distinction. After an interchange of compliments, Borgia withdrew upon some pretext, when there immediately entered his chosen agent of iniquity, Don Michelotto, with several armed followers, who, after some resistance, arrested the Duke of Gravina, Paolo Orsini, Vitellozzo, and Liverotto, with some ten others. Before morning the two last were strangled with a Pisan cord, or violin-string, and a wrench-pin, by the hands of that monster, in his master's presence. Their death, according to Machiavelli, was cowardly, especially that of the blood-stained Liverotto; and their bodies, after being dragged round the piazza, were exposed for three days before burial.  That night Valentino, at the head of his Gascons, attacked six thousand of these captains' troops, which had not dispersed on hearing the capture of their leaders, slaughtering and plundering them with the same barbarity they had themselves used towards the citizens. The greater portion were cut to pieces, and those who escaped reached their homes naked, having only straw tied round their legs. Fabio Orsini was saved by his accidental absence from Borgia's levee; Petrucci and Baglioni, suspicious of treachery, had avoided their fate by previously retiring home. Against the last of these, Borgia marched in a few days, carrying with him the remaining chiefs, of whom he reserved the Orsini until he should hear his father's intentions; but each night after supper he is said to have had one of the others brought out, and put to a cruel death before him. Thus did he, by a dexterous stroke of the most refined duplicity, turn the tools of his ambition into victims of his vengeance, and at the same time ridded himself of faithless adherents, whom any change in his fortune would have again converted into overt and implacable foes.[1]  [Footnote 1: Our chief authorities for this tragic scene are Machiavelli's despatches and separate narrative, with the Diaries of Burchard, Buonaccorsi, and Sanuto. Some details are taken from the Ricordi of Padre Gratio, guardian of the Monastery delle Grazie at Sinigaglia, a contemporary, and probably an eye-witness to many of them. Vat. Urb. MSS. 1023, art. 17.[*A]]  [Footnote *A: Cf. MADIAI, _Diario delle Cose di Urbino_, in _Arch. St. per le Marche e per l'Umbria_, tom. III., p. 437. Machiavelli, who was with Cesare at the time, describes the massacre of Sinigaglia as \"il bellissimo inganno di Sinigaglia.\" Cesare wrote an account of it to Isabella d'Este. Cf. her letter to her husband (D'ARCO, _Notizie di Isabella Estense_, in _Arch. St. Ital._, ser. i., App., vol. I., No. II. (1845), p. 262).]  Vermiglioli, in his life of Malatesta Baglioni, has printed, from the archives of Perugia, a letter from Borgia to the magistrates of that city, which, in consideration of the comparative obscurity of that interesting volume, we shall here translate. It is, perhaps, the only known document fully stating the case of the writer, and so may be regarded as his defence from the charges we have brought against him: the style and orthography are remarkably rude; and the matter abounds in that common expedient, whereby bold and bad men seek to evade merited accusations, by throwing them upon those they have outraged.[2]  [Footnote 2: Our version is from the original letter. Nearly similar in purport, but much shorter, is a despatch written by him to the Doge of Venice on the very night of the raid, so anxious was he to conciliate the Signory.]       \"Magnificent and potent Lords, my special Friends and      Brothers;       \"Superfluous were it to narrate from their outset the      perfidious rebellion and atrocious treason, so known to      yourselves and to all the world, and so detestable, which      your [lords, the Baglioni,] and their accomplices have      committed against his Holiness the Pope and ourselves.      And although all were our vassals, and most of them in      our pay, received and caressed by us as sons or brothers,      and favoured with high promotion, they nevertheless,      regardless of the kindness of his Holiness and our own,      as of their individual honour, banded in schemes of      overweening ambition, and blinded by greed of tyranny,      have failed us at the moment of our utmost need, turning      his Holiness' arms and ours against him and ourselves,      for the overthrow of our sovereignty and person. They      commenced their aggressions upon us by raising our      states of Urbino, Camerino, and Montefeltro, throwing      all Romagna into confusion by force and by seditious      plots, and proceeding under the mask of reconciliation to      fresh offences, until our new levies were brought up in      irresistible force. And so atrocious was their baseness,      that neither the beneficent clemency of his [Holiness]      aforesaid, nor our renewed indulgence to them, weaned them      from the slough of their first vile designs, in which      they still persisted. And as soon as they learned the      departure of the French troops on their return towards      Lombardy, whereby they deemed us weakened and left with no      effective force, they, feigning an urgent desire to aid      in our attack upon Sinigaglia, mustered a third only of      their infantry, and concealed the remainder in the houses      about, with instructions to draw together at nightfall,      and unite with the men-at-arms, whom they had posted in      the neighbourhood, meaning, at a given moment, to throw      the infantry, through the garrison (with whom they had an      understanding), upon the new town, in the narrow space      whereof they calculated upon our being lodged with few      attendants, and so to complete their long-nourished plans      by crushing us at unawares. But we, distinctly forewarned      of all, so effectively and quickly anticipated them, that      we at once made prisoners of the Duke of Gravina, Paolo      Orsini, Vitellozzo of Castello, and Liverotto of Fermo,      and discovered, sacked, and overthrew their foot and      horse, whether concealed or not; whereupon the castellan,      seeing the plot defeated, quickly surrendered the fortress      at discretion. And this we have done, under pressure      of necessity imposed by the measures of these persons      aforesaid, and in order to make an end of the unmeasured      perfidy and villanies of them and their coadjutors,      thereby restraining their boundless ambition and insensate      cupidity, which were truly a public nuisance to the nations      of Italy. Thus your highnesses have good cause for great      rejoicing at your deliverance from these dangers. And on      your highnesses' account, I am now, by his Holiness's      commands, to march with my army, for the purpose of      rescuing you from the rapacious and sanguinary oppression      whereby you have been vexed, and to restore you to free      and salutary obedience to his Holiness and the Apostolic      See, with the maintenance of your wonted privileges. For      the which causes, We, as Gonfaloniere and Captain of his      Holiness and the aforesaid See, exhort, recommend, and      command you, on receipt hereof, to free yourselves from      all other yoke, and to send ambassadors to lay before his      Holiness your dutiful and unreserved obedience: which      failing, we are commanded to reduce you by force to that      duty,--an event that would distress us on account of the      serious injuries which must thereby result to your people,      for whom we have, from our boyhood, borne and still bear      singular favour. From Corinaldo, the 2d of January, 1503.       \"CESARE BORGIA OF FRANCE, DUKE OF ROMAGNA AND      VALENTINO, PRINCE OF ADRIA AND VENAFRA, LORD OF      PIOMBINO, Gonfaloniere and Captain-General of the Holy      Roman Church.\"  News of the Sinigaglia tragedy reached the Pope late in the evening, and he instantly communicated to Cardinal Orsini that Cesare had taken that city, assured that an early visit of congratulation from his Eminence would follow. The Cardinal was perhaps the richest and most influential of his house. He chiefly had organised the league of La Magione, but having always contrived to keep on good terms with Alexander, he believed in the professions of regard with which his Holiness subsequently seduced him from that policy, and thence reposed in him a fatal confidence. Next morning he rode in state to pay his respects at the Vatican, where his own person and those of his principal relations were instantly seized, whilst his magnificent palace at Monte Giordano was pillaged by orders and for the benefit of the Pontiff. After an imprisonment of some weeks, he was cut off by slow poison, prescribed from the same quarter, and died on the 22d of February. Thus did the Pope set his seal of approval on his son's atrocities, which he justified by a poor and pointless jest, avowing that as the confederates of La Magione, after stipulating"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44235"],["title","Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino, Volume 2 (of 3) (#7)"],["body"," they should not be required to re-enter the service of Valentino unless singly, had thought fit to place themselves within his power _en masse_, they merited their fate as forsworn.

This charge possesses a twofold interest, as inculpating the character of the historian, and as affecting the morality of the age.[*3] In the latter view alone does it fall under our consideration: yet however horrible these wholesale murders, they are more remarkable in Italian history as the crowning crime of an ambitious career, and as widely influencing the political aspect of Romagna and La Marca, than from their relative enormity. The fates of the young Astorre Manfredi of Faenza, of Fogliano of Fermo, of the Lord of Camerino and his three sons, have all been mentioned in these pages as occurring within a year or two of this event. It would be easy to swell the catalogue of slaughter; and we find Baglioni and Vitellozzo both classed with Cesare himself in the category of murder, by a chronicler of Alexander VI., who also quotes from the mouth of Giovanni Bentivoglio, at the diet of La Magione, this bravado, \"I shall assassinate Duke Valentino should I be so lucky as to have opportunity.\"[4] The spirit of the age is further illustrated by its unnumbered poisonings: and the fact that Machiavelli should neither have used his influence with Valentino to avert the massacre of the confederates, nor his pen to brand the treachery of that foul deed, is but another link in the evidence from which we may deduce the total extinction of moral feeling, which, anticipating the worst doctrines of Loyola, carried them out with a selfishness, falsehood, and cruelty unparalleled in the annals of human civilisation.[*5]  [Footnote *3: It is unlikely that Machiavelli abetted the massacre, though he certainly approved it dispassionately enough. By it the Papacy was rid at last of the houses of Colonna and Orsini. Cesare met Machiavelli after the affair \"with the best cheer in the world,\" reminding him that he had given him a hint of his intentions, but adding, \"I did not tell you all.\" He urged on Machiavelli his desire for a firm alliance with Florence. Cf. MACHIAVELLI, _Legazione al Valentino_, Lett. 86, and the _Modo tenuto dal Duca Valentino nel ammazzare Vitellozzo_. See also CREIGHTON, _op. cit._, vol V., p. 40.]  [Footnote 4: VERMIGLIOLI: _Vita di Malatesta Baglioni_.]  [Footnote *5: The schemes of Cesare were in his age no more unscrupulously carried out than Bismarck's in his. \"It is well,\" said Cesare, \"to beguile those who have shown themselves to be masters of treachery.\"]  [Illustration: _Alinari_  IL CASTELLO DI SINIGAGLIA]  Gianpaolo Baglioni having fled to Siena, Valentino followed him in that direction, after taking possession of Perugia, and learning that Città di Castello, abandoned by the adherents of the Vitelli, had been plundered by his own partizans. On the 18th of January, hearing at Città della Pieve of the blow struck by his father against the Orsini, and that Fabio, who escaped the snare at Sinigaglia, was ravaging the Campagna, he handed over Paolo and the Duke of Gravina to the tender mercies of Michelotto, whose noose quickly encircled their necks. Invading the Sienese, he carried fire and sword by Chiusi as far as Pienza and San Quirico, massacring even the aged and infirm with horrible tortures. His real object, besides revenging himself upon Petrucci and Baglioni, was to add Siena to his territory, but his position being then a delicate one with France, he accepted the proposal of that republic to purchase safety, by exiling Petrucci their seigneur, and dismissing Baglioni their guest.[*6]  [Footnote *6: Cf. LISINI, _Cesare Borgia e la repubblica di Siena_, in the _Boll. Senese di Stor. Pat._, ann. VII. (fasc. I.), pp. 114, 115, and 144 _et seq._ for all the documents. And for a short but excellent account in English of the whole Sienese affair, LANGTON DOUGLAS, _A History of Siena_ (Murray, 1902), p. 206 _et seq._]  This series of rapid successes is ascribed by Machiavelli to the policy of Valentino in ridding himself of his French auxiliaries and his mercenary confederates, and so being enabled, during the brief remainder of his career, to give his talents and energy full scope in the conduct of an army entirely devoted to his views. His conquests had now extended along the eastern fall of the Apennines, from Imola to Camerino, and included the upper vale of the Tiber and the principality of Piombino. He had but to add to them Siena, and the best part of Central Italy from sea to sea would be his own. The eyes of Louis, at length opened to a danger which he had so long fostered, were not blinded by Cesare's affected moderation in claiming his recent acquisitions rather for the Church than for himself, and that monarch hastened to caution him from further hostilities against Tuscany. The successes of Fabio Orsini around Rome at the same time called for his presence, so he changed his route to make a foray upon the holdings of that family about the Lake of Bracciano, with whom the Colonna and Savelli had united against their common enemies the Borgia. This opportunity was greedily seized by the Pontiff to carry out his long cherished policy of breaking the power of the great barons, and the castles of the Orsini having one after another been reduced, their influence ceased for the future to be formidable either to their sovereign or their neighbours.         *       *       *       *       *  But it is time we should return to Urbino, where we left the citizens bewailing the departure of their Duke. As soon as he was gone, Antonio di S. Savino took possession of the place in name of Valentino, and issued a proclamation enjoining the townsfolk to disarm, the peasantry to return home, and all to surrender whatever they had stolen the day before from the palace. In the afternoon, after a conciliatory harangue to the people, he took his lodging in the palace. Next morning, after mass, the Bishop published a general amnesty, and oaths of allegiance to the new sovereign were administered. Towards evening the bells were rung, and a bonfire was lit in the piazza; but these were heartless and forced rejoicings, and no bribes could induce even the children to raise the cry of \"Valenza.\" Nor was this sadness without cause, for the soldiery of Orsini and Vitellozzo, who still quartered in the town, treated all with such outrage, that many of the inhabitants prayed for death to close their sufferings, envying those who were summoned from such scenes of misery. But when the troops were withdrawn, the mild character and popular manners of Antonio the governor, skilfully seconding the conciliatory policy which Borgia had resolved upon, gave matters another aspect, and occasioned surprise to those who knew the cruel perfidy of their new master. Various notorious abuses were put down under severe penalties, especially the acceptance of presents by judges, and the following up of private vengeance. The deputy governor, Giovanni da Forlì, was however a man of quite opposite temperament, whose harshness soon counteracted these gentler influences, and occasioned general disgust. But the people heard with satisfaction the tragedy of Sinigaglia; for to the perfidy of the chiefs and the brutality of their army, the loss of their independence and the whole of their late misfortunes were unanimously ascribed; and a permission to ravage the territory of the Vitelli, now publicly proclaimed throughout the duchy, was by many greedily seized.  Borgia, having secured fourteen distinguished inhabitants of Urbino as hostages, ordered that the fortresses left by agreement in the hands of Guidobaldo should be attempted: that of Maiuolo was accordingly surprised about the beginning of May, and easily reduced. S. Leo being better provided, as well as considered impregnable, its siege was more methodically undertaken, and levies were ordered to reinforce the assailants. The amount of public sympathy with the cause may be estimated from Baldi's assertion that, in the city of Urbino, the utmost difficulty was experienced in raising eight foot soldiers with one month's pay. Eight hundred Gascons in the French service were obtained from De la Tremouille; but these, having turned the siege into a sort of blockade, were dispersed among the neighbouring villages, where, on the 5th of June, their revels were suddenly interrupted by unknown assailants, who disappeared as mysteriously as they had issued from the mountain defiles, leaving many of the besiegers slain or wounded. The surrounding peasantry, catching the enthusiasm, rushed to arms, and, but for extraordinary exertions, the whole duchy would have once more been out for their legitimate lord. News of this movement having reached the Duke early in July, he obtained from Florence free passage through her territory, and from the Venetians a promise of passive support, and thereupon put himself into communication with his principal adherents, by means of letters carried by persons of low condition, many of which were unfortunately intercepted by the lieutenant-governor of Urbino. His people were thus kept in a fever of expectation; but, finally, this plan of an invasion was abandoned, whereupon he repaired to Mantua, to his brother-in-law the Marquis, who had been taken into the French service under De la Tremouille, and engaged him to represent to Louis the hardships of his case, and the danger of Borgia's excessive ambition.  Disgusted with their ignominious overthrow at S. Leo, the Gascons assumed the habitual licence of such mercenaries, by soon taking their departure from       \"The tentless rest beneath the"]]]
