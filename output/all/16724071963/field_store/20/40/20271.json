Agriculture and machinery were carried on to a great extent. Commercial and manufacturing business flourished on every hand; yet in consequence of wickedness, they were often visited with terrible judgments. Many prophets were raised up among them from generation to generation, who testified against the wickedness of the people, and prophesied of judgments and calamities which awaited them, if they did not repent, &c. Sometimes they were visited by pestilence and plagues, and sometimes by famine and war, until at length (having occupied the land some fifteen or sixteen hundred years,) their wickedness became so great that the Lord threatened, by the mouth of his prophets, to utterly destroy them from the face of the land. But they gave no heed to these warnings; therefore the word of the Lord was fulfilled; and they were entirely destroyed; leaving their houses, their cities, and their land desolate; and their sacred records also, which were kept on gold plates, were left by one of their last prophets, whose name was Ether, in such a situation, that they were discovered by the remnant of Joseph, who soon afterwards were brought from Jerusalem to inherit the land.  This remnant of Joseph were also led in a miraculous manner from Jerusalem, in the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah. They were first led to the eastern borders of the Red Sea; then they journeyed for some time along the borders thereof, nearly in a south-east direction; after which they altered their course nearly eastward, until they came to the great waters, where, by the commandment of God, they built a vessel, in which they were safely brought across the great Pacific Ocean, and landed upon the western coast of South America.  In the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, at the time the Jews were carried away captive into Babylon, another remnant were brought out of Jerusalem, some of whom were descendants of Judah. They landed in North America, soon after which they emigrated, into the northern parts of South America, at which place they were discovered by the remnant of Joseph, something like four hundred years after.  From these ancient records, we learn that this remnant of Joseph, soon after they landed, separated themselves into two distinct nations. This division was caused by a certain portion of them being greatly persecuted, because of their righteousness, by the remainder. The persecuted nation emigrated towards the northern parts of South America, leaving the wicked nation in possession of the middle and southern parts of the same. The former were called Nephites, being led by a prophet whose name was Nephi. The latter were called Lamanites, being led by a very wicked man, whose name was Laman. The Nephites had in their possession a copy of the Holy Scriptures, viz. the five books of Moses, and the prophecies of the holy prophets, down to Jeremiah, in whose days they left Jerusalem. These scriptures were engraved on plates of brass, in the Egyptian language. They themselves also made plates, soon after their landing, on which they began to engrave their own history, prophecies, visions, and revelations. All these sacred records were kept by holy and righteous men, who were inspired by the Holy Ghost; and were carefully preserved and handed down from generation to generation.  And the Lord gave unto them the whole continent, for a land of promise, and promised, that they, and their children after them, should inherit it, on condition of their obedience to his commandments; but if they were disobedient, they should be cut off from his presence. And the Nephites began to prosper in the land, according to their righteousness, and multiplied and spread forth to the east, west, and north; building large villages, cities, synagogues, and temples, together with forts, towers, and fortifications, to defend themselves against their enemies. And they cultivated the earth, and raised various kinds of grain in abundance. They also raised numerous flocks of domestic animals, and became a very wealthy people; having in abundance gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, &c. Arts and sciences flourished to a great extent. Various kinds of machinery were in use. Cloths of various kinds were manufactured. Swords, scimitars, axes, and various implements of war were made, together with head-shields, arm-shields, and breastplates, to defend themselves in battle with their enemies. And in the days of their righteousness, they were a civilized, enlightened, and happy people.  But, on the other hand, the Lamanites, because of the hardness of their hearts, brought down many judgments upon their own heads; nevertheless, they were not destroyed as a nation; but the Lord God sent forth a curse upon them, and they became a dark, loathsome, and filthy people. Before their rebellion, they were white and exceedingly fair, like the Nephites; but the Lord God cursed them in their complexions, and they were changed to a dark color, and they became a wild, savage, and ferocious people; being great enemies to the Nephites, whom they sought by every means to destroy, and many times came against them, with their numerous hosts to battle, but were repulsed and driven back to their own possession, not, however, generally speaking, without great loss on both sides; for tens of thousands were very frequently slain, after which they were piled together in great heaps upon the face of the ground, and covered with a shallow covering of earth, which will satisfactorily account for those ancient mounds filled with human bones, so numerous at the present day, both in North and South America.  The second colony, which left Jerusalem eleven years after the remnant of Joseph left that city, landed in North America, and emigrated from thence, to the northern parts of South America; and about four hundred years after, they were discovered by the Nephites, as we stated in the foregoing.  They were called the people of Zarahemla. They had been perplexed with many wars among themselves; and having brought no records with them, their language had become corrupted, and they denied the being of God; and at the time they were discovered by the Nephites they were very numerous, and only in a partial state of civilization; but the Nephites united with them, and taught them the Holy Scriptures, and they were restored to civilization, and became one nation with them. And in process of time, the Nephites began to build ships near the Isthmus of Darien, and launch them forth into the western ocean, in which great numbers sailed a great distance to the northward, and began to colonize North America. Other colonies emigrated by land, and in a few centuries the whole continent became peopled. North America at that time, was almost entirely destitute of timber, it having been cut off by the more ancient race, who came from the great tower, at the confusion of languages; but the Nephites became very skilful in building houses of cement; also much timber was carried by the way of shipping from South to North America. They also planted groves and began to raise timber, that in time their wants might be supplied. Large cities were built in various parts of the continent, both among the Lamanites and Nephites. The law of Moses was observed by the latter. Numerous prophets were raised up from time to time throughout their generations. Many records, both historical and prophetical, which were of great size, were kept among them; some on plates of gold and other metals, and some on other materials. The sacred records, also of the more ancient race who had been destroyed, were found by them. These were engraved on plates of gold. They translated them into their own language, by the gift and power of God, through the means of the Urim and Thummim. They contained an historical account from the creation down to the Tower of Babel, and from that time down until they were destroyed, comprising a period of about thirty-four hundred, or thirty-five hundred years. They also contained many prophecies, great and marvellous, reaching forward to the final end and consummation of all things, and the creation of the new heaven and new earth.  The prophets also among the Nephites prophesied of great things. They opened the secrets of futurity--saw the coming of Messiah in the flesh--prophesied of the blessings to come upon their descendants in the latter times--made known the history of unborn generations-- unfolded the great events of ages to come--viewed the power, glory, and majesty of Messiah's second advent--beheld the establishment of the kingdom of peace--gazed upon the glories of the day of righteousness--saw creation redeemed from the curse, and all the righteous filled with songs of everlasting joy.  The Nephites knew of the birth and crucifixion of Christ, by certain celestial and terrestrial phenomena, which, at those times, were shown forth in fulfilment of the predictions of many of their prophets. Notwithstanding the many blessings with which they had been blessed, they had fallen into great wickedness, and had cast out the saints and the prophets, and stoned and killed them. Therefore, at the time of the crucifixion of Christ, they were visited in great judgment. Thick darkness covered the whole continent. The earth was terribly convulsed. The rocks were rent into broken fragments, and afterwards found in seams and cracks upon all the face of the land. Mountains were sunk into valleys, and valleys raised into mountains. The highways and level roads were broken up and spoiled. Many cities were laid in ruins. Others were buried up in the depths of the earth, and mountains occupied their place. While others were sunk, and waters came up in their stead, and others still were burned by fire from heaven.  Thus, the predictions of their prophets were fulfilled upon their heads. Thus, the more wicked part, both of the Nephites and Lamanites were destroyed.

Those who survived these terrible judgments, were favoured with the personal ministry of Christ. For after He arose from the dead--finished his ministry at Jerusalem, and ascended to heaven, he descended in the presence of the Nephites, who were assembled round about their temples in the northern parts of South America He exhibited to them his wounded hands, side, and feet--commanded the law of Moses to be abolished--introduced and established the Gospel in its stead--chose twelve disciples from among them to administer the same--instituted the sacrament--prayed for and blessed their little children--healed their sick, blind, lame, deaf, and those who were afflicted in any way--raised a man from the dead--showed forth his power in their midst--expounded the scriptures which had been given from the beginning down to that time, and made known unto them all things which should take place down until He should come in his glory, and from that time down to the end, when all people, nations, and languages shall stand before God to be judged, and the heaven, and the earth should pass away, and there should be a new heaven and new earth. These teachings of Jesus were engraved upon plates, some of which are contained in the book of Mormon; but the greater part are not revealed in that book, but are hereafter to be made manifest to the saints.  After Jesus had finished ministering unto them, he ascended into heaven; and the twelve disciples whom he had chosen, went forth upon all the face of the land, preaching the gospel; baptizing those who repented, for the remission of sins, after which they laid their hands upon them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. Mighty miracles were wrought by them, and also by many of the church. The Nephites and Lamanites were all converted unto the Lord, both in South and North America; and they dwelt in righteousness above three hundred years; but towards the close of the fourth century of the Christian era, they had so far apostatized from God, that he suffered great judgments to fall upon them. The Lamanites, at that time, dwelt in South America, and the Nephites in North America.  A great and terrible war commenced between them, which lasted for many years, and resulted in the complete overthrow and destruction of the Nephites. This war commenced at the Isthmus of Darien, and was very destructive to both nations for many years. At length, the Nephites were driven before their enemies, a great distance to the North, and North-east; and having gathered their whole nation together, both men women, and children, they encamped on and round about the hill Cumorah, where the records were found, which is in the State of New-York, about two hundred miles west of the city of Albany. Here they were met by the numerous hosts of the Lamanites, and were slain, and hewn down, and slaughtered, both male and female--the aged, middle-aged, and children. Hundreds of thousands were slain on both sides; and the nation of the Nephites were destroyed, excepting a few who had deserted over to the Lamanites, and a few who escaped into the south country, and a few who fell wounded, and were left by the Lamanites on the field of battle for dead, among whom were Mormon and his son Moroni, who were righteous men.  Mormon had made an abridgment, from the records, of his forefathers, upon plates, which abridgment he entitled the \"Book of Mormon,\" and, (being commanded of God,) he hid up in the hill Cumorah, all the sacred records of his forefathers which were in his possession, except the abridgment called the \"Book of Mormon,\" which he gave to his son Moroni to finish. Moroni survived his nation a few years, and continued the writings, in which he informs us, that the Lamanites hunted those few Nephites who escaped the great and tremendous battle of Cumorah, until they were all destroyed, excepting those who were mingled with the Lamanites, and that he was left alone, and kept himself hid, for they sought to destroy every Nephite who would not deny Christ. He furthermore states, that the Lamanites were at war one with another, and that the whole face of the land was one continual scene of murdering, robbing, and plundering. He continued the history until the four hundred and twentieth year of the Christian era; when, (by the commandment of God,) he hid up the records in the hill Cumorah, where they remained concealed, until by the ministry of an angel they were discovered to Mr. Smith, who, by the gift and power of God, translated them into the English language, by the means of the Urim and Thummim, as stated in the foregoing.  After the book was translated, the Lord raised up witnesses to bear testimony to the nations of its truth, who, at the close of the volume, send forth their testimony, which reads as follows:     TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES.     Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto    whom this work shall come, that we, through the grace of God the    Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, have seen the plates which contain    this record, which is a record of the people of Nephi, and also of    the Lamanites, their brethren, and also of the people of Jared, who    came from the tower of which hath been spoken; and we also know that    they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice    hath declared it unto us, wherefore, we know of a surety, that the    work is true. And we also testify that we have seen the engravings    which are upon the plates; and they have been shown unto us by the    power of God, and not of man. And we declare, with words of    soberness, that an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought    and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates, and the    engravings thereon; and we know that it is by the grace of God the    Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that we behold and bear record    that these things are true; and it is marvellous in our eyes,    nevertheless, the voice of the Lord commanded us that we should bear    record of it; wherefore, to be obedient to the commandments of God,    we bear testimony of these things. And we know that if we are    faithful in Christ, we shall rid our garments of the blood of all men    and be found spotless before the judgment seat of Christ, and shall    dwell with him eternally in the heavens. And the honour be to the    Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, which is one God. Amen.     OLIVER COWDERY,    DAVID WHITMER,    MARTIN HARRIS.     AND ALSO THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES.     Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto    whom this work shall come, that Joseph Smith, Jr., the translator of    this work, has shown unto us the plates of which hath been spoken,    which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the    said Smith has translated, we did handle with our hands; and we also    saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of    ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record    with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shown unto us, for    we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety, that the said Smith    has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names    unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen;    and we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

Also, in the year 1829, Mr. Smith and Mr. Cowdery, having learned the correct mode of baptism, from the teachings of the Saviour to the ancient Nephites, as recorded in the \"Book of Mormon,\" had a desire to be baptized; but knowing that no one had authority to administer that sacred ordinance in any denomination, they were at a loss to know how the authority was to be restored, and while calling upon the Lord with a desire to be informed upon the subject, a holy angel appeared--stood before them--laid his hands upon their heads--ordained them--and commanded them to baptize each other, which they accordingly did.  In the year 1830, a large edition of the \"Book of Mormon\" first appeared in print. And as some began to peruse its sacred pages, the spirit of the Lord bore record to them that it was true, and they were obedient to its requirements, by coming forth, humbly repenting before the Lord, and being immersed in water, for the remission of sins, after which, by the commandment of God, hands were laid upon them in the name of the Lord, for the gift of the Holy Spirit.  And on the sixth of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and thirty, the \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints,\" was organized, in the town of Manchester, Ontario County, State of New-York. Some few were called and ordained by the spirit of revelation and prophecy, and began to preach and bear testimony, as the spirit gave them utterance; and although they were the weak things of the earth, yet they were strengthened by the Holy Ghost, and gave forth their testimony in great power, by which means many were brought to repentance, and came forward with broken hearts and contrite spirits, and were immersed in water confessing their sins, and were filled with the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands; and saw visions and prophesied. Devils were cast out, and the sick were healed by the prayer of faith, and laying on of hands. Thus was the word confirmed unto the faithful by signs following. Thus the Lord raised up witnesses, to bear testimony of his name, and lay the foundation of his kingdom in the last days. And thus the hearts of the saints were comforted, and filled with great joy.  In the foregoing, we have related the most important facts concerning the visions and the ministry of the angel to Mr. Smith; the "]]]
