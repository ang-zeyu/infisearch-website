Otherwise they would have remained scattered and hidden indefinitely in the hands of various collectors.  They will be found extraordinarily interesting in their self-revelation, and some, indeed, are so intimate and personal that one understands why Stevenson withheld them from all eyes save his own.  The love-poems in particular, though they are of very unequal merit, possess in common a really affecting sincerity.  That Stevenson should have preserved these poems through all the vicissitudes of his wandering life shows how dearly he must have valued them; and shows, too, I think, beyond any contradiction, that he meant they should be ultimately published.

I say ill things I would not"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/441"],["title","New Poems, and Variant Readings (#1)"],["body","ay—       Things unaware:    Regard my breast, Lord, in Thy day,       And not my prayer.     My heart is evil in Thy sight:       My good thoughts flee:    O Lord, I cannot wish aright—       Wish Thou for me.     O bend my words and acts to Thee,       However ill,    That I, whate’er I say or be,       May serve Thee still.     O let my thoughts abide in Thee       Lest I should fall:    Show me Thyself in all I see,       Thou Lord of all.     LO! IN THINE HONEST EYES I READ      LO! in thine honest eyes I read    The auspicious beacon that shall lead,    After long sailing in deep seas,    To quiet havens in June ease.     Thy voice sings like an inland bird    First by the seaworn sailor heard;    And like road sheltered from life’s sea    Thine honest heart is unto me.     THOUGH DEEP INDIFFERENCE SHOULD DROWSE      THOUGH deep indifference should drowse    The sluggish life beneath my brows,    And all the external things I see    Grow snow-showers in the street to me,    Yet inmost in my stormy sense    Thy looks shall be an influence.     Though other loves may come and go    And long years sever us below,    Shall the thin ice that grows above    Freeze the deep centre-well of love?    No, still below light amours, thou    Shalt rule me as thou rul’st me now.     Year following year shall only set    Fresh gems upon thy coronet;    And Time, grown lover, shall delight    To beautify thee in my sight;    And thou shalt ever rule in me    Crowned with the light of memory.     MY HEART, WHEN FIRST THE BLACK-BIRD SINGS      MY heart, when first the blackbird sings,       My heart drinks in the song:    Cool pleasure fills my bosom through       And spreads each nerve along.     My bosom eddies quietly,       My heart is stirred and cool    As when a wind-moved briar sweeps       A stone into a pool     But unto thee, when thee I meet,       My pulses thicken fast,    As when the maddened lake grows black       And ruffles in the blast.     I DREAMED OF FOREST ALLEYS FAIR   I.      I DREAMED of forest alleys fair       And fields of gray-flowered grass,    Where by the yellow summer moon       My Jenny seemed to pass.     I dreamed the yellow summer moon,       Behind a cedar wood,    Lay white on fields of rippling grass       Where I and Jenny stood.     I dreamed—but fallen through my dream,       In a rainy land I lie    Where wan wet morning crowns the hills       Of grim reality.    II.      I am as one that keeps awake       All night in the month of June,    That lies awake in bed to watch       The trees and great white moon.     For memories of love are more       Than the white moon there above,    And dearer than quiet moonshine       Are the thoughts of her I love.    III.      Last night I lingered long without       My last of loves to see.    Alas! the moon-white window-panes       Stared blindly back on me.     To-day I hold her very hand,       Her very waist embrace—    Like clouds across a pool, I read       Her thoughts upon her face.     And yet, as now, through her clear eyes       I seek the inner shrine—    I stoop to read her virgin heart       In doubt if it be mine—     O looking long and fondly thus,       What vision should I see?    No vision, but my own white face       That grins and mimics me.    IV.      Once more upon the same old seat       In the same sunshiny weather,    The elm-trees’ shadows at their feet       And foliage move together.     The shadows shift upon the grass,       The dial point creeps on;    The clear sun shines, the loiterers pass,       As then they passed and shone.     But now deep sleep is on my heart,       Deep sleep and perfect rest.    Hope’s flutterings now disturb no more       The quiet of my breast.     ST. MARTIN’S SUMMER      AS swallows turning backward       When half-way o’er the sea,    At one word’s trumpet summons       They came again to me—    The hopes I had forgotten       Came back again to me.     I know not which to credit,       O lady of my heart!    Your eyes that bade me linger,       Your words that bade us part—    I know not which to credit,       My reason or my heart.     But be my hopes rewarded,       Or be they but in vain,    I have dreamed a golden vision,       I have gathered in the grain—    I have dreamed a golden vision,       I have not lived in vain.     DEDICATION      MY first gift and my last, to you    I dedicate this fascicle of songs—    The only wealth I have:    Just as they are, to you.     I speak the truth in soberness, and say    I had rather bring a light to your clear eyes,    Had rather hear you praise    This bosomful of songs     Than that the whole, hard world with one consent,    In one continuous chorus of applause    Poured forth for me and mine    The homage of ripe praise.     I write the finis here against my love,    This is my love’s last epitaph and tomb.    Here the road forks, and I    Go my way, far from yours.     THE OLD CHIMÆRAS, OLD RECEIPTS      THE old Chimæras, old receipts       For making “happy land,”    The old political beliefs       Swam close before my hand.     The grand old communistic myths       In a middle state of grace,    Quite dead, but not yet gone to Hell,       And walking for a space,     Quite dead, and looking it, and yet       All eagerness to show    The Social-Contract forgeries       By Chatterton—Rousseau—     A hundred such as these I tried,       And hundreds after that,    I fitted Social Theories       As one would fit a hat!     Full many a marsh-fire lured me on,       I reached at many a star,    I reached and grasped them and behold—       The stump of a cigar!     All through the sultry sweltering day       The sweat ran down my brow,    The still plains heard my distant strokes       That have been silenced now.     This way and that, now up, now down,       I hailed full many a blow.    Alas! beneath my weary arm       The thicket seemed to grow.     I take the lesson, wipe my brow       And throw my axe aside,    And, sorely wearied, I go home       In the tranquil eventide.     And soon the rising moon, that lights       The eve of my defeat,    Shall see me sitting as of yore       By my old master’s feet.     PRELUDE      BY sunny market-place and street    Wherever I go my drum I beat,    And wherever I go in my coat of red    The ribbons flutter about my head.     I seek recruits for wars to come—    For slaughterless wars I beat the drum,    And the shilling I give to each new ally    Is hope to live and courage to die.     I know that new recruits shall come    Wherever I beat the sounding drum,    Till the roar of the march by country and town    Shall shake the tottering Dagons down.     For I was objectless as they    And loitering idly day by day;    But whenever I heard the recruiters come,    I left my all to follow the drum.     THE VANQUISHED KNIGHT      I HAVE left all upon the shameful field,       Honour and Hope, my God, and all but life;    Spurless, with sword reversed and dinted shield,       Degraded and disgraced, I leave the strife.     From him that hath not, shall there not be taken       E’en that he hath, when he deserts the strife?    Life left by all life’s benefits forsaken,       O keep the promise, Lord, and take the life.     TO THE COMMISSIONERS OF NORTHERN LIGHTS      I SEND to you, commissioners,    A paper that may please ye, sirs    (For troth they say it might be worse          An’ I believe’t)    And on your business lay my curse          Before I leav’t.     I thocht I’d serve wi’ you, sirs, yince,    But I’ve thocht better of it since;    The maitter I will nowise mince,          But tell ye true:    I’ll service wi’ some ither prince,          An’ no wi’ you.     I’ve no been very deep, ye’ll think,    Cam’ delicately to the brink    An’ when the water gart me shrink          Straucht took the rue,    An’ didna stoop my fill to drink—          I own it true.     I kent on cape and isle, a light    Burnt fair an’ clearly ilka night;    But at the service I took fright,          As sune’s I saw,    An’ being still a neophite          Gaed straucht awa’.     Anither course I now begin,    The weeg I’ll cairry for my sin,    The court my voice shall echo in,          An’—wha can tell?—    Some ither day I may be yin          O’ you mysel’.     THE RELIC TAKEN, WHAT AVAILS THE SHRINE?      THE relic taken, what avails the shrine?    The locket, pictureless?  O heart of mine,    Art thou not worse than that,    Still warm, a vacant nest where love once sat?     Her image nestled closer at my heart    Than cherished memories, healed every smart    And warmed it more than wine    Or the full summer sun in noon-day shine.     This was the little weather gleam that lit    The cloudy promontories—the real charm was    That gilded hills and woods    And walked beside me thro’ the solitudes.     The sun is set.  My heart is widowed now    Of that companion-thought.  Alone I plough    The seas of life, and trace    A separate furrow far from her and grace.     ABOUT THE SHELTERED GARDEN GROUND      ABOUT the sheltered garden ground       The trees stand strangely still.    The vale ne’er seemed so deep before,       Nor yet so high the hill.     An awful sense of quietness,       A fulness of repose,    Breathes from the dewy garden-lawns,       The silent garden rows.     As the hoof-beats of a troop of horse       Heard far across a plain,    A nearer knowledge of great thoughts       Thrills vaguely through my brain.     I lean my head upon my arm,       My heart’s too full to think;    Like the roar of seas, upon my heart       Doth the morning stillness sink.     AFTER READING “ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA”      AS when the hunt by holt and field       Drives on with horn and strife,    Hunger of hopeless things pursues       Our spirits throughout life.     The sea’s roar fills us aching full       Of objectless desire—    The sea’s roar, and the white moon-shine,       And the reddening of"]]]
