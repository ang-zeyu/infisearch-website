A Scotch Presbyterian is particularly zealous for a strict observance of the Sabbath. One who was a little liberal in his views of the law pertaining to the Sabbath was once arguing with an orthodox brother on the subject, and urged that even Jesus so far bent the law pertaining to the Sabbath that he justified his disciples in walking through the fields of corn on the Sabbath, and rubbing the ears of corn in their hands, blowing away the chaff, and eating the corn. \"O weel,\" says Donald, \"mebbe the Lord did that; but it doesna heighten him in my opeenion.\" And so this resurrected, second personage of the Godhead ate material food after his resurrection; but I take it that the fact does not \"heighten\" him in the opinion of our ultra spiritually-minded folk. It comes in conflict, undoubtedly, with their notions of what life ought to be after the resurrection.  [Footnote A: Luke 24:36-39.]  [Footnote B: Luke 24:41-43.]  But not only did he do this, but with his resurrected hands he prepared a meal on the sea shore for his own disciples, and invited them to partake of the food which he with his resurrected hands had provided.[A] Moreover, for forty days he continued ministering to his disciples after his resurrection, eating and drinking with them;[B] and then, as they gathered together on one occasion, lo! he ascended from their midst, and a cloud received him out of their sight. Presently two personages in white apparel stood beside them and said: \"Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.\"[C] What! With his body of flesh and bones, with the marks in his hands and in his feet? Shall he come again in that form? The old Jewish prophet, Zechariah, foresaw that he would. He describes the time of his glorious coming, when his blessed, nail-pierced feet shall touch the Mount of Olives again, and it shall cleave in twain, and open a great valley for the escape of the distressed house of Judah, sore oppressed in the siege of their great city Jerusalem. We are told that \"They shall look upon him whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son,\" and one shall look upon him in that day and shall say, \"What are these wounds in thy hands and in thy feet?\" and he shall answer, \"These are the wounds that I received in the house of my friends.\"[D]  [Footnote A: John 21:9-13 and Acts 10:41.]  [Footnote B: Acts 10:31, and Acts 1:2,3.]  [Footnote C: Acts 1:11.]  [Footnote D: Zech. the 12th, 13th, and 14th chapters.]  What think ye of Christ? Is he God? Yes. Is he man? Yes, Will that resurrected, immortal, glorified man ever be distilled into some bodiless, formless essence, to be diffused as the perfume of a rose is diffused throughout the circumambient air? Will he become an impersonal, incorporeal, immaterial God, without body, without parts, without passions? Will it be? Can it be? What think ye of Christ? Is he God? Yes. Is he an exalted man? Yes; in the name of all the Gods, he is. Then why do sectarian ministers arraign the faith of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints because they believe and affirm that God is an exalted man, and that he has a body, tangible, immortal, indestructible, and will so remain embodied throughout the countless ages of eternity? And since the Son is in the form and likeness of the Father, being, as Paul tells, \"in the express image of his [the Father's] person\"--so, too, the Father God is a man of immortal tabernacle, glorified and exalted: for as the Son is, so also is the Father, a personage of tabernacle, of flesh and of bone as tangible as man's, as tangible as Christ's most glorious, resurrected body.  II.  THE ONENESS OF GOD.  There are some expressions of scripture to consider which speak of the \"oneness\" of God. Speaking of the question which agitated the early Christian Church about eating meats which had been offered to idols, Paul says: \"We know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.\"[A] Moreover, Jesus himself made this strange remark--that is, strange until one understands it: \"I and my Father are one;\" and so much one are they that he said: \"He that hath seen me hath seen the Father. * * * Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself; but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.\"[B] Consequently our philosophers, especially those who lived when the present Christian creeds concerning God were forming, thought that by some legerdemain or other they must make the three Gods--the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost--just one person--one being; and therefore they set their wits at work to perform the operation.  [Footnote A: I Cor. 8:4.]  [Footnote B: John 14.]  Let us seek out some reasonable explanation of the language used. I refer again to the passage I just quoted from the writings of Paul with reference to there being \"none other God but one.\" Immediately following what I read on that point comes this language:       For though there be that are called Gods, whether in heaven or in     earth (as there be Gods many, and Lords many). But to us there is     but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and     one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.[A]  [Footnote A: I Cor. 8:4-6.]  Now I begin to understand. \"To us,\" that is, _pertaining_ to us, \"there is but one God.\" Just as to the English subject there is but one sovereign, so \"to us\" there is but one God. But that no more denies the existence of other Gods than the fact that to the Englishman there is but one sovereign denies the existence of other rulers over other lands. While declaring that \"to us there is but one God,\" the passage also plainly says that there \"be Gods many and Lords many,\" and it is a mere assumption of the sectarian ministers that reference is made only to heathen gods.  Again, we shall find help in the following passage in the 14th chapter of John:       At that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in me,     and I in you.  Observe this last scripture, I pray you. \"I in you,\" and \"ye in me,\" as well as Jesus being in the Father. This oneness existing between God the Father and God the Son can amount to nothing more than this: that Jesus was conscious of the indwelling presence of the Spirit of the Father within him, hence he spoke of himself and his Father as being one, and the Father within him doing the works. But mark you, not only are the disciples to know that the Father is in him, that is, in Christ, and that Jesus is in the Father, but the disciples also are to be in Jesus. In what way? Jesus himself has furnished the explanation. When the solemn hour of his trial drew near, and the bitter cup was to be drained to the very dregs, Jesus sought God in secret prayer, and in the course of that prayer he asked for strength of the Father, not only for himself, but for his disciples also. He said:       And now I am no more in the world, but these [referring to his     disciples] are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep     through thy name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be     one, _as we are_.[A]  [Footnote A: John 17.]  Now I begin to see this mystery of \"oneness.\" What does he mean when he prays that the disciples that God had given him should be one, as he and the Father are one? Think of it a moment, and while you are doing so I will read you this:       Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall     believe on me through their word; that they all may be one: as     thou, _Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one     in us._[A]  [Footnote A: John 17.]  Does that mean that the persons of all these disciples, whose resurrection and individual immortality he must have foreknown, shall all be merged into one person, and then that one fused into him, or he into that one, and then the Father consolidated into the oneness of the mass? No; a thousand times, no, to such a proposition as that. But as Jesus found the indwelling Spirit of God within himself, so he would have that same Spirit indwelling in his disciples, as well as in those who should believe on him through their testimony, in all time to come; and in this way become of one mind, actuated by one will. It must have been thoughts such as these that prompted Paul to say to the Ephesians:       For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus     Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,     that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to     be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man: that     Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and     grounded in him, may be able to comprehend with all saints what is     the breadth, and length, and depth, and height; and to know the     love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled     with all the fullness of God.[A]  [Footnote A: Eph. 8:14-19.]  So then, this oneness is not a oneness of persons, not a oneness of individuals, but a oneness of mind, of knowledge, of wisdom, of purpose, of will, that all might be uplifted and partake of the divine nature, until God shall be all in all. This is the explanation of the mystery of the oneness both of the Godhead and of the disciples for which Jesus prayed.  III.  THE PLURALITY OP GODS.  There are several other items in this branch of the subject that would be of interest to discuss; but I must pay a little attention to the indictment brought against us by sectarian ministers on the question of a plurality of Gods.  We have already shown that the Father, the Son,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45464"],["title","The Mormon Doctrine of Deity: The Roberts-Van Der Donckt Discussion (#5)"],["body","the Holy Ghost are three separate and distinct persons, and, so far as personality is concerned, are three Gods. Their \"oneness\" consists in being possessed of the same mind; they are one, too, in wisdom, in knowledge, in will and purpose; but as individuals they are three, each separate and distinct from the other, and three is plural. Now, that is a long way on the road towards proving the plurality of Gods. But, in addition to this, I would like to know from our friends--the critical sectarian ministers who complain of this part of our faith--the meaning of the following expressions, carefully selected from the scriptures:  \"The Lord your God is God of Gods, and Lord of Lords.\" That is from Moses.[A]  [Footnote A: Deut. 10:17.]  \"The Lord God of Gods, the Lord God of Gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know.\" That is from Joshua.[A]  [Footnote A: Josh. 22:22.]  \"O give thanks unto the God of Gods! * * O give thanks to the Lord of Lords!\" That is David.[A]  [Footnote A: Psalm 137:2,3.]  \"And shall speak marvelous things against the God of Gods.\" That is Daniel.[A]  [Footnote A: Daniel 11:36.]  \"The Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings.\" That is the beloved disciple of Jesus--John the Revelator.[A]  [Footnote A: Rev. 17:14.]  Had I taken such expressions from the lips of the pagan kings or false prophets who are sometimes represented as speaking in the scriptures, you might question the propriety of making such quotations in support of the doctrine I teach; but since these expressions come from prophets and recognized servants of God, I ask those who criticize our faith in the matter of a plurality of Gods to explain away those expressions of the scriptures. Furthermore, there is Paul's language, in his letter to the Corinthians, already quoted, where he says, \"that there be Gods many and Lords many, whether in heaven or in earth.\" Had his expression been confined to those that are called gods in earth it is possible that there might be some good ground for claiming that he had reference to the heathen gods, and not true Gods; but he speaks of those that \"are Gods in heaven\" as well as gods in earth. Right in line with this idea is the following passage from the Psalms of the Prophet David: \"God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the Gods.\"[A] These, undoubtedly, are the Gods in heaven to whom Paul alludes, among whom the God referred to stands; among whom he judges. This is no reference to the heathen gods, but to the Gods in heaven, the true Gods.  [Footnote A: Psalm 82:1.]  In this same Psalm, too, is the passage which seems to introduce some telling evidence from the Lord Jesus Christ himself, _viz_: \"I have said ye are Gods, and all of you are the children of the Most High.\" You remember how on one occasion the Jews took up stones to stone Jesus, and he called a halt for just a moment, for he wanted to reason with them about it. He said:       Many good works have I shown you from the Father; for which of     these works do ye stone me?  Their answer was:       For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because     that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.  What an opportunity here for Jesus to teach them that there was but one God! How easily too, had he been so disposed, he could have explained about his \"human nature\" and his \"divine nature,\" and shown to them the distinction; for these words have become part of the phraseology of Christian polemics. But he did not do that. On the contrary, he affirmed the doctrine of a plurality of Gods. He said to them:       _Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are Gods?_ If he called     them Gods, unto whom the word of God came, _and the scripture     cannot be broken;_ say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified     and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the     Son of God? If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. But     if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works.  Higher authority on this question cannot be quoted than the Son of God himself. While there is much more that could and doubtless ought to be said on that branch of the subject, I must leave it here, because I have still another matter to present to you, on another branch of the subject; and that is, our belief that there is a possibility, through development, through growth, through doing what Jesus admonished his disciples to do--\"Be ye perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect\"--that the sons of God, somewhere and some time, may rise to a dignity that the Father and our Elder Brother have already attained unto.  IV.  The Future Possibilities for Man.  Is there any doubt about men being the sons of God? If I thought there was any in your minds, I would like to read to you the words of an authority upon this question. Paul, in speaking of the unknown God to whom the Athenians had erected an altar, said to them:       God that made the world and all things therein * * * hath made     of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of     the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed and the     bounds of their habitation; that they should seek the Lord, if     haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far     from every one of us: for in him we live, and move, and have our     being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also     his offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we     ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver,     or stone, graven by art and man's device.[A]  [Footnote A: Acts 17:24-29.]  Why ought they not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver, graven by art and man's device? Because the very divinity within them, their own kinship with God, ought to have taught them better than to bow down to images of wood and stone, the creation of man's hands. \"Ye are the offspring of God,\" said the apostle. And David, as quoted a moment ago, said: \"I have said: Ye are Gods, and all of you are children of the Most High.\" Upon which passage, it must be remembered, Jesus fixed the seal of his approval, as shown a moment ago, where he quotes it in controversy with the Jews.  Is it a strange and blasphemous doctrine, then, to hold that men at the last shall rise to the dignity that the Father has attained? Is it \"heathenish\" to believe that the offspring shall ultimately be what the parent is? My soul, I wonder why men at all conscious of the marvelous powers within themselves should question this part of our faith. Think for a moment what progress a man makes within the narrow limits of this life. Regard him as he lies in the lap of his mother, a mere piece of organized, red pulp--a new-born babe! There are eyes, indeed, that may see, but cannot distinguish objects; ears that may hear, but cannot distinguish sounds; hands as perfectly fashioned as yours or mine, but helpless, withal; feet and limbs, but they are unable to bear the weight of his body, much less walk. There lies a man in embryo, but helpless. And yet, within the span of three score years and ten, by the marvelous working of that wondrous power within that little mass of pulp, what a change may be wrought! From that helpless babe may arise one like Demosthenes or Cicero, or Pitt, or Burke, or Fox, or Webster, who shall compel listening senates to hear him, and by his master mind dominate their intelligence and their will, and compel them to think in channels that he shall mark out for them. Or from such a babe may come a Nebuchadnezzar, or an Alexander, or a Napoleon, who shall found empires or give direction to the course of history. From such a beginning may come a Lycurgus, a Solon, a Moses, or a Justinian, who shall give constitutions and laws to kingdoms, empires and republics, blessing happy millions unborn in their day, and direct the course of nations along paths of orderly peace and virtuous liberty. From the helpless babe may come a Michael Angelo, who from some crude mass of stone from the mountain side shall work out a heaven-born vision that shall hold the attention of men for generations, and make them wonder at the God-like powers of man that has created an all but living and breathing statue. Or a Mozart, a Beethoven, or a Handel, may come from the babe, and call out from the silence those melodies and the richer harmonies that lift the soul out of its present narrow prison house and give it fellowship for a season with the Gods. Out from that pulp-babe may arise a master mind who shall seize the helm of the ship of state, and give to a nation course and direction through troublesome times, and anchor it at last in a haven of peace, prosperity and liberty; crown it with honor, too, and give it a proud standing among the nations of the earth; while he, the savior of his country, is followed by the benedictions of his countrymen.  And all this may be done by a man in this life! Nay, it has been done, between the cradle and the grave--within the span of one short life. Then what may not be done in eternity by one of these God-men? Remove from his path the incident of death; or, better yet, contemplate him as raised from the dead; and give to him in the full splendor of manhood's estate, immortality, endless existence, what may we not hope that he will accomplish? What limits can you venture to fix as marking the boundary of his development, of his progress? Are there any limits that can be conceived? Why should there be any limits thought of? Grant immortality to man and God for his guide, what is there in the way of intellectual, moral, and spiritual development that he may not aspire to? If within the short space of mortal life there are men who rise up out of infancy and become masters of the elements of fire and water and earth and air, so that they well-nigh rule them as Gods, what may it not be possible for them to do in a few hundreds or thousands of"]]]
