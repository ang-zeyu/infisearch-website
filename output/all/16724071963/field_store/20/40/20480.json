When I awoke the bed vanished, and found myself on the bare floor and well rested, not having been troubled with evil spirits or anything else.  We thanked the Lord for His goodness to us, ate the remainder of our provisions and continued our journey down the river to Little Rock, the capital of Arkansas, which then consisted of only a few cabins.  After visiting the place, we crossed the river and tied up our canoe, which had carried us safely one hundred and fifty miles.  We then took the old military road, leading from Little Rock to Memphis, Tennessee. This road lay through swamps, and was covered with mud and water most of the way, for one hundred and seventy miles. We walked forty miles in a day through mud and water knee-deep.  On the 24th of March, after traveling some ten miles through mud, I was taken lame with a sharp pain in my knee. I sat down on a log.  My companion, who was anxious to get to his home in Kirtland, left me sitting in an alligator swamp. I did not see him again for two years. I knelt down in the mud and prayed, and the Lord healed me, and I went on my way rejoicing.  On the 27th of March, I arrived at Memphis, weary and hungry. I went to the best tavern in the place, kept by Mr. Josiah Jackson. I told him I was a stranger, and had no money. I asked him if he would keep me over night.  He inquired of me what my business was.  I told him I was a preacher of the gospel.  He laughed, and said that I did not look much like a preacher.  I did not blame him, as all the preachers he had ever been acquainted with rode on fine horses or in fine carriages, clothed in broadcloth, and had large salaries, and would see this whole world sink to perdition before they would wade through one hundred and seventy miles of mud to save the people.  The landlord wanted a little fun, so he said he would keep me if I would preach. He wanted to see if I could preach.  I must confess that by this time I became a little mischievous, and pleaded with him not to set me preaching.  The more I plead to be excused, the more determined Mr. Jackson was that I should preach. He took my valise, and the landlady got me a good supper.  I sat down in a large hall to eat supper. Before I got through, the room began to be filled with some of the rich and fashionable of Memphis, dressed in their broadcloth and silk, while my appearance was such as you can imagine, after traveling through the mud as I had been.  When I had finished eating, the table was carried out of the room over the heads of the people. I was placed in the corner of the room, with a stand having a Bible, hymn book and candle on it, hemmed in by a dozen men, with the landlord in the center.  There were present some five hundred persons who had come together, not to hear a gospel sermon, but to have some fun.  Now, boys, how would you like this position? On your first mission, without a companion or friend, and to be called upon to preach to such a congregation? With me it was one of the most pleasing hours of my life, although I felt as though I should like company.  I read a hymn, and asked them to sing. Not a soul would sing a word.  I told them had not the gift of singing; but with the help of the Lord, I would both pray and preach. I knelt down to pray, and the men around me dropped on their knees. I prayed to the Lord to give me His Spirit and to show me the hearts of the people. I promised the Lord in my prayer I would deliver to that congregation whatever He would give to me. I arose and spoke one hour and a half and it was one of the best sermons of my life.  The lives of the congregation were opened to the vision of my mind, and I told them of their wicked deeds and the reward they would obtain. The men who surrounded me dropped their heads. Three minutes after I closed I was the only person in the room.  Soon I was shown to a bed, in a room adjoining a large one in which were assembled many of the men whom I had been preaching to. I could hear their conversation.  One man said he would like to know how that \"Mormon\" boy knew of their past lives.  In a little while they got to disputing about some doctrinal point. One suggested calling me to decide the point. The landlord said, \"no; we have had enough for once.\"  In the morning, I had a good breakfast. The landlord said if I came that way again to stop at his house, and stay as long as I might choose.    CHAPTER VII.  CURIOUS WORSHIP--MEET ELDER PARRISH--LABOR TOGETHER IN TENNESSE--ADVENTURE IN BLOODY RIVER--A NIGHT OF PERIL--PROVIDENTIAL LIGHT--MENACED BY A MOB--GOOD ADVICE OF A BAPTIST PREACHER--SUMMARY OF MY LABORS DURING THE YEAR.  After leaving Memphis, I traveled through the country to Benton County, and preached on the way as I had opportunity.  I stopped one night with a Squire Hardman, an Episcopalian.  Most of the night was spent by the family in music and dancing.  In the morning, at the breakfast table, Mr. Hardman asked me if we believed in music and dancing.  I told him we did not really consider them essential to salvation.  He said he did, and therefore should not join our Church.  On the 4th of April, 1835, I had the happy privilege of meeting Elder Warren Parrish at the house of Brother Frys. He had been preaching in that part of Tennessee, in company with David W. Patten, and had baptized a number and organized several small branches.  Brother Patten had returned home, and Brother Parish was laboring alone. I joined him in the ministry, and we labored together three months and nineteen days, when he was called to Kirtland.  During the time we were together we traveled through several counties in Tennessee for the distance of seven hundred and sixty miles, and preached the gospel daily, as we had opportunity. We baptized some twenty persons.  By the counsel of the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, Elder Parrish ordained me an Elder, and left me to take charge of the branches that had been raised up in that neighborhood.  As soon as I was left alone I extended my circuit and labors. For a season I had large congregations; many seemed to believe, and I baptized a number.  On the 15th of August I had an appointment at the house of Brother Taylor, the step-father of Abraham O. Smoot.  I had to cross Bloody River, which I had to swim in consequence of heavy rains. While crossing, my horse became entangled in a tree top, and almost drowned; but I succeeded in getting him loose.  We swam to the shore separately. He reached the shore first, and waited till I came out. I got into the saddle, and went on my way in good spirits, and had a good meeting.  On the 20th of October I baptized three Campbellites, one of whom was a deacon. I then rode twelve miles to Mr. Greenwood's, who was eighty years old, and had been a soldier under General Washington. His wife, who was ninety-three years old, I found quite smart, and busy carding wool. I preached at their house and baptized both of them.  On the following day I preached at the house of Benjamin L. Clapp and baptized seven Campbellites and one Baptist.  On the 16th of November I preached at Brother Camp's and baptized three. On the day following, it being Sunday, I preached again at Brother Clapp's and baptized five. At the close of the meeting I mounted my horse to ride to Clark's River, in company with Seth Utley, four other brethren and two sisters. The distance was twenty miles.  We came to a stream, which was so swollen by rains, that we could not cross without swimming our horses. To swim would not be safe for the females, so we went up the stream to find a ford. In the attempt we were overtaken by a severe storm of wind and rain, and lost our way in the darkness, and wandered through creeks and mud. But the Lord does not forsake His Saints in any of their troubles. While we were in the woods suffering under the blast of the storm, groping like the blind for the wall, a bright light suddenly shone around us and revealed to us our dangerous situation on the edge of a gulf. The light continued with us until we found the road; we then went on our way rejoicing, though the darkness returned and the rain continued.  We reached Brother Henry Thomas' in safety about nine o'clock at night, having been five hours in the storm and forded streams many times. None of us felt to complain, but were thankful to God for His preserving care.  On the following day I preached in Damon Creek and organized a branch called the Damon Creek Branch, and ordained Daniel Thomas a Teacher.  On the 19th of December I again preached at the house of Brother Clapp, and baptized five persons; one was a Campbellite preacher.  On the following day I preached at the house of Brother Henry Thomas, when a mob of about fifty persons collected, headed by a Baptist preacher, who, after asking one question, advised the mob to not lay hands on any man on account of his principles.  The advice was good and well taken.  At the close of the meeting I baptized three persons, one seventy-eight years old.  This brings the year 1835 to a close--the first year of my mission--during which time I had traveled three thousand two hundred and forty-eight miles, held one hundred and seventy meetings, baptized forty-three persons--three of whom were Campbellite preachers--assisted Elder Parish to baptize twenty more, confirmed thirty-five, organized three branches, ordained two Teachers and one Deacon, procured thirty subscribers for the _Messenger and Advocate_, one hundred and seventy-three signers to the petition to the governor of Missouri for redress of wrongs done the Saints in Jackson County, had three mobs rise against me--but was not harmed, wrote eighteen letters, received ten, and, finally, closed the labors of the year 1835, by eating johnny-cake, butter and honey, at Brother A. O. Smoot's.    CHAPTER VIII.  STUDYING GRAMMAR--MEET ELDER PATTEN--GLORIOUS NEWS--LABOR WITH A. O.

I spent the fore part of January, 1836, (the weather being very cold) at the house of A. O. Smoot, in Kentucky, studying Kirkham's English Grammar. I continued to travel and preach in Kentucky and Tennessee and baptized all that would believe my testimony.  On the 26th of February we held a conference at the house of Brother Lewis Clapp (father of B. L. Clapp). There were represented one hundred and three members in that mission. I ordained A. O. Smoot and Benjamin Boyston Elders, and Daniel Thomas and Benjamin L. Clapp Priests. I also ordained one Teacher and two Deacons.  After conference I took Brothers Smoot and Clapp with me to preach. The former traveled with me constantly till the 21st of April, when we had the privilege of meeting with Elder David W. Patten, who had come direct from Kirtland, and who had been ordained one of the Twelve Apostles.  It was a happy meeting. He gave us an account of the endowments at Kirtland, the glorious blessings received, the ministration of angels, the organization of the Twelve Apostles and Seventies, and informed me that I was appointed a member of the second quorum of Seventies. All of this was glorious news to me, and caused my heart to rejoice.  On the 27th of May we were joined by Elder Warren Parrish, direct from Kirtland. We had a happy time together.  On the 28th, we held a conference at Brother Seth Utley's, where were represented all the branches of the Church in the South.  I was ordained on the 31st of May a member of the second quorum of Seventies under the hands of David W. Patten and Warren Parrish.  At the close of the conference we separated for a short time. Elders Patten and Parrish labored in Tennessee, Brother Smoot and myself in Kentucky. On the 9th of June we all met at Damon Creek branch, where Brother Patten baptized two. One was Father Henry Thomas, who had been a revolutionary soldier under General Washington, and father of Daniel and Henry Thomas.  A warrant was issued, on the oath of a priest, against D. W. Patten, W. Parrish and myself. We were accused in the warrant of the great \"crime\" of testifying that Christ would come in this generation, and that we promised the Holy Ghost to those whom we baptized. Brothers Patten and Parrish were taken on the 19th of June. I being in another county, escaped being arrested. The brethren were put under two thousand dollars bond to appear at court. Albert Petty and Seth Utley were their bondsmen.  They were tried on the 22nd of June. They pleaded their own cause. Although men came forward and testified they did receive the Holy Ghost after they were baptized, the brethren were condemned; but were finally released by paying the expense of the mob court.  There was one peculiar circumstance connected with this trial by a mob court, which was armed to the teeth. When the trial was through with, the people were not willing to permit more than one to speak. Warren Parrish had said but few words, and they were not willing to let David Patten speak. But he, feeling the injustice of the court, and being filled with the power of God, arose to his feet and delivered a speech of about twenty minutes, holding them spell-bound while he told them of their wickedness and the abominations that they were guilty of, also of the curse of God that awaited them, if they did not repent, for taking up two harmless, inoffensive men for preaching the gospel of Christ.  When he got through his speech the judge said, \"You must be armed with secret weapons, or you would not talk in this fearless manner to an armed court.\"  Brother Patten replied: \"I have weapons that you know not of, and they are given me of God, for He gives me all the power I have.\"  The judge seemed willing to get rid of them almost upon any terms, and offered to dismiss them if their friends would pay the costs, which the brethren present freely offered to do.  When the two were released, they mounted their horses and rode a mile to Seth Utley's; but, as soon as they had left, the court became ashamed that they had been let go so easily and the whole mob mounted their horses to follow them to Utley's.  One of the Saints, seeing the state of affairs, went on before the mob to notify the brethren, so that they had time to ride into the woods near by.  They traveled along about three miles to Brother Albert Petty's, and went to bed. The night was dark, and they went to sleep.  But Brother Patten was warned in a dream to get up and flee, as the mob would soon be there. They both arose, saddled their animals, and rode into the adjoining county.  The house they had just left was soon surrounded by the mob, but the brethren had escaped through the mercy of God.  I was invited to hold a meeting at a Baptist meeting-house on the 27th of June. On my arrival I met a large congregation; but, on commencing meeting, Parson Browning ordered the meeting to be closed. I told the people I had come ten miles to preach the gospel to them, and was willing to stand in a cart, on a pile of wood, on a fence, or any other place they would appoint, to have that privilege.  One man said he owned the fence and land in front of the meeting-house, and we might use both, for he did not believe \"Mormonism\" would hurt either.  So the congregation crossed the road, took down the fence and made seats of it, and I preached to them one hour and a half. At the close Mr. Randolph Alexander bore testimony to the truth of what had been said. He invited me home with him, bought a Book of Mormon, and was baptized, and I organized a branch in that place.  On the 18th of July, Brother A. O. Smoot and I arrived at a ferry on the Tennessee river, and, as the ferryman was not at home, the woman kindly gave us permission to use the ferryboat. We led our horses on board, and took the oars to cross the river. Brother Smoot had never used an oar, and I had not for some years, so we made awkward work of it. Soon he broke one oar, and I let another fall overboard, which left us only one broken oar to get to shore with. We narrowly escaped running into a steamboat. We struck shore half a mile below the landing place, tied up the boat, jumped on the bank with our horses, and went on our way with blistered hands, thankful to get off so well.  On Sunday, the 31st of July, A. O. Smoot and I preached at Mr. David Crider's, Weakly County, Tennessee. After the meeting Mr. Crider was baptized. A mob gathered and threatened us, and poisoned our horses so that the one I rode, belonging to Samuel West, died a few days after. This horse had carried me thousands of miles while preaching the gospel.  I continued to travel with Brothers Smoot, Patten and Parrish in Tennessee and Kentucky, and we baptized all who would receive our testimony.  On the 2nd day of September we held a general conference at the Damon Creek Branch. Elder Thomas B. Marsh President of the Twelve Apostles, presided. All the branches in Tennessee and Kentucky were represented.  Brothers Randolph Alexander, Benjamin L. Clapp and Johnson F. Lane were ordained Elders and Lindsay Bradey was ordained to the lesser Priesthood.  I assisted President Marsh to obtain fifteen hundred dollars from the Southern brethren, to enter land in Missouri for the Church. The brethren made me a present of fifty dollars, which I sent by President Marsh to enter forty acres of land for me. Elder Smoot and I were released from the Southern mission with permission to go to Kirtland.    CHAPTER IX.  ATTENDING SCHOOL--MARRIAGE--IMPRESSED TO TAKE A MISSION TO FOX ISLANDS--ADVISED TO GO--JOURNEY TO CANADA--CASES OF HEALING--JOURNEY TO CONNECTICUT--MY BIRTHPLACE--MY MOTHER'S GRAVE--BAPTIZE SOME RELATIVES--JOINED BY MY WIFE--JOURNEY ON FOOT TO MAINE--ARRIVAL AT FOX ISLAND.  Having returned from my Southern mission in the autumn of 1836, in company with Elders A. O. Smoot and Jesse Turpin, I spent the following winter in Kirtland. During this time I received my endowments and attended the school of Professor Haws, who taught Greek, Latin and English grammar. I confined my studies mostly to Latin and English grammar.  This winter and the following spring, in some respects, may be regarded as one of the most interesting periods of the history of the Church, when we consider the endowments and teachings given in the temple, and the great apostasy which followed.  I was married to Miss Phoebe Whitmore Carter, on the 13th of April, 1837, and received my patriarchal blessing under the hands of Father Joseph Smith, the Patriarch, two days after.  I felt impressed by the Spirit of God to take a mission to the Fox Islands, situated east of the Maine shore, a country I knew nothing about. I made my feelings known to the Apostles, and they advised me to go.  Feeling that it was my duty to go upon this mission, I did not tarry at home one year after having married a wife, as the law of Moses would have allowed. On the contrary, I started just one month and one day after that important event, leaving my wife with Sister Hale, with whom she expected to stay for a season.  I left Kirtland in good spirits, in company with Elder Jonathan H. Hale, and walked twelve miles to Fairport, where we were joined by Elder Milton Holmes. There we went aboard the steamer _Sandusky_, and made our way to Buffalo, and proceeded thence to Syracuse, by way of the Erie Canal. We then walked to Richland, Oswego Co., N. Y., where I met my two brothers, whom I had not seen for several years.  After spending one night there, we continued our journey to Sackett's Harbor, and crossed Lake Ontario on the steamer _Oneida_, to Kingston, Upper Canada, and from there also by steamer along the canal to Jones' Falls, whence we walked to a place called Bastard, Leeds County.  Here we found a branch of the Church, presided over by John E. Page and"]]]
