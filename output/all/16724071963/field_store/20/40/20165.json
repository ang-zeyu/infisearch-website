LAURA PIAVENI XII.      THE BRONZE BUTTERFLY XIII.     THE PLOT OF THE SIGNOR ANTONIO    CHAPTER IX  IN VERONA  The lieutenant read these lines, as he clattered through the quiet streets toward the Porta Tosa:  'DEAR FRIEND,--I am glad that you remind me of our old affection, for it assures me that yours is not dead.  I cannot consent to see you yet.  I would rather that we should not meet.  'I thought I would sign my name here, and say, \"God bless you, Wilfrid; go!\"  'Oh!  why have you done this thing!  I must write on.  It seems like my past life laughing at me, that my old friend should have come here in Italy, to wear the detestable uniform.  How can we be friends when we must act as enemies?  We shall soon be in arms, one against the other. I pity you, for you have chosen a falling side; and when you are beaten back, you can have no pride in your country, as we Italians have; no delight, no love.  They will call you a mercenary soldier.  I remember that I used to have the fear of your joining our enemies, when we were in England, but it seemed too much for my reason.  'You are with a band of butchers.  If I could see you and tell you the story of Giacomo Piaveni, and some other things, I believe you would break your sword instantly.  'There is time.  Come to Milan on the fifteenth.  You will see me then. I appear at La Scala.  Promise me, if you hear me, that you will do exactly what I make you feel it right to do.  Ah, you will not, though thousands will!  But step aside to me, when the curtain falls, and remain--oh, dear friend!  I write in honour to you; we have sworn to free the city and the country--remain among us: break your sword, tear off your uniform; we are so strong that we are irresistible.  I know what a hero you can be on the field: then, why not in the true cause?  I do not understand that you should waste your bravery under that ugly flag, bloody and past forgiveness.  'I shall be glad to have news of you all, and of England.  The bearer of this is a trusty messenger, and will continue to call at the hotel.  A. is offended that I do not allow my messenger to give my address; but I must not only be hidden, I must have peace, and forget you all until I have done my task.  Addio.  We have both changed names.  I am the same. Can I think that you are?  Addio, dear friend.  'VITTORIA.'   Lieutenant Pierson read again and again the letter of her whom he had loved in England, to get new lights from it, as lovers do when they have lost the power to take single impressions.  He was the bearer of a verbal despatch from the commandant in Milan to the Marshal in Verona.  At that period great favour was shown to Englishmen in the Austrian service, and the lieutenant's uncle being a General of distinction, he had a sort of semi-attachment to the Marshal's staff, and was hurried to and fro, for the purpose of keeping him out of duelling scrapes, as many of his friendlier comrades surmised.  The right to the distinction of exercising staff-duties is, of course, only to be gained by stout competitorship in the Austrian service; but favour may do something for a young man even in that rigorous school of Arms.  He had to turn to Brescia on his way, and calculated that if luck should put good horses under him, he would enter Verona gates about sunset.  Meantime; there was Vittoria's letter to occupy him as he went.  We will leave him to his bronzing ride through the mulberries and the grapes, and the white and yellow and arid hues of the September plain, and make acquaintance with some of his comrades of that proud army which Vittoria thought would stand feebly against the pouring tide of Italian patriotism.  The fairest of the cities of the plain had long been a nest of foreign soldiery.  The life of its beauty was not more visible then than now. Within the walls there are glimpses of it, that belong rather to the haunting spirit than to the life.  Military science has made a mailed giant of Verona, and a silent one, save upon occasion.  Its face grins of war, like a skeleton of death; the salient image of the skull and congregating worms was one that Italian lyrists applied naturally to Verona.  The old Field-Marshal and chief commander of the Austrian forces in Lombardy, prompted by the counsels of his sagacious adlatus, the chief of the staff, was engaged at that period in adding some of those ugly round walls and flanking bastions to Verona, upon which, when Austria was thrown back by the first outburst of the insurrection and the advance of the Piedmontese, she was enabled to plant a sturdy hind-foot, daring her foes as from a rock of defence.  A group of officers, of the cavalry, with a few infantry uniforms skirting them, were sitting in the pleasant cooling evening air, fanned by the fresh springing breeze, outside one of the Piazza Bra caffes, close upon the shadow of the great Verona amphitheatre.  They were smoking their attenuated long straw cigars, sipping iced lemonade or coffee, and talking the common talk of the garrison officers, with perhaps that additional savour of a robust immorality which a Viennese social education may give.  The rounded ball of the brilliant September moon hung still aloft, lighting a fathomless sky as well as the fair earth.  It threw solid blackness from the old savage walls almost to a junction with their indolent outstretched feet.  Itinerant street music twittered along the Piazza; officers walked arm-in-arm; now in moonlight bright as day, now in a shadow black as night: distant figures twinkled with the alternation.  The light lay like a blade's sharp edge around the massive circle.  Of Italians of a superior rank, Verona sent none to this resort.  Even the melon-seller stopped beneath the arch ending the Stradone Porta Nuova, as if he had reached a marked limit of his popular customers.  This isolation of the rulers of Lombardy had commenced in Milan, but, owing to particular causes, was not positively defined there as it was in Verona.  War was already rageing between the Veronese ladies and the officers of Austria.  According to the Gallic Terpsichorean code, a lady who permits herself to make election of her partners and to reject applicants to the honour of her hand in the dance, when that hand is disengaged, has no just ground of complaint if a glove should smite her cheek.  The Austrians had to endure this sort of rejection in Ballrooms. On the promenade their features were forgotten.  They bowed to statues. Now, the officers of Austria who do not belong to a Croat regiment, or to one drawn from any point of the extreme East of the empire, are commonly gentlemanly men; and though they can be vindictive after much irritation, they may claim at least as good a reputation for forbearance in a conquered country as our officers in India.  They are not ill-humoured, and they are not peevishly arrogant, except upon provocation.  The conduct of the tender Italian dames was vexatious.  It was exasperating to these knights of the slumbering sword to hear their native waltzes sounding of exquisite Vienna, while their legs stretched in melancholy inactivity on the Piazza pavement, and their arms encircled no ductile waists.  They tried to despise it more than they disliked it, called their female foes Amazons, and their male by a less complimentary title, and so waited for the patriotic epidemic to pass.  A certain Captain Weisspriess, of the regiment named after a sagacious monarch whose crown was the sole flourishing blossom of diplomacy, particularly distinguished himself by insisting that a lady should remember him in public places.  He was famous for skill with his weapons. He waltzed admirably; erect as under his Field-Marshal's eye.  In the language of his brother officers, he was successful; that is, even as God Mars when Bellona does not rage.  Captain Weisspriess (Johann Nepomuk, Freiherr von Scheppenhausen) resembled in appearance one in the Imperial Royal service, a gambling General of Division, for whom Fame had not yet blown her blast.  Rumour declared that they might be relatives; a little- scrupulous society did not hesitate to mention how.  The captain's moustache was straw-coloured; he wore it beyond the regulation length and caressed it infinitely.  Surmounted by a pair of hot eyes, wavering in their direction, this grand moustache was a feature to be forgotten with difficulty, and Weisspriess was doubtless correct in asserting that his face had endured a slight equal to a buffet.  He stood high and square- shouldered; the flame of the moustache streamed on either side his face in a splendid curve; his vigilant head was loftily posted to detect what he chose to construe as insult, or gather the smiles of approbation, to which, owing to the unerring judgement of the sex, he was more accustomed.  Handsome or not, he enjoyed the privileges of masculine beauty.  This captain of a renown to come pretended that a superb Venetian lady of the Branciani family was bound to make response in public to his private signals, and publicly to reply to his salutations.  He refused to be as a particle in space floating airily before her invincible aspect.  Meeting her one evening, ere sweet Italy had exiled herself from the Piazza, he bowed, and stepping to the front of her, bowed pointedly.  She crossed her arms and gazed over him.  He called up a thing to her recollection in resonant speech.  Shameful lie, or shameful truth, it was uttered in the hearing of many of his brother officers, of three Italian ladies, and of an Italian gentleman, Count Broncini, attending them.  The lady listened calmly.  Count Broncini smote him on the face.  That evening the lady's brother arrived from Venice, and claimed his right to defend her. Captain Weisspriess ran him through the body, and attached a sinister label to his corpse.  This he did not so much from brutality; the man"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4436"],["title","Vittoria â€” Volume 2 (#1)"],["body","that henceforth while he held his life he was at war with every Italian gentleman of mettle.  Count Broncini was his next victim.  There, for a time, the slaughtering business of the captain stopped.  His brother officers of the better kind would not have excused him at another season, but the avenger of their irritation and fine vindicator of the merits of Austrian steel, had a welcome truly warm, when at the termination of his second duel he strode into mess, or what serves for an Austrian regimental mess.  It ensued naturally that there was everywhere in Verona a sharp division between the Italians of all classes and their conquerors.  The great green-rinded melons were never wheeled into the neighbourhood of the whitecoats.  Damsels were no longer coquettish under the military glance, but hurried by in couples; and there was much scowling mixed with derisive servility, throughout the city, hard to be endured without that hostile state of the spirit which is the military mind's refuge in such cases.  Itinerant musicians, and none but this fry, continued to be attentive to the dispensers of soldi.  The Austrian army prides itself upon being a brotherhood.  Discipline is very strict, but all commissioned officers, when off duty, are as free in their intercourse as big boys.  The General accepts a cigar from the lieutenant, and in return lifts his glass to him.  The General takes an interest in his lieutenant's love-affairs: nor is the latter shy when he feels it his duty modestly to compliment his superior officer upon a recent conquest.  There is really good fellowship both among the officers and in the ranks, and it is systematically encouraged.  The army of Austria was in those days the Austrian Empire.  Outside the army the empire was a jealous congery of intriguing disaffected nationalities.  The same policy which played the various States against one another in order to reduce all to subserviency to the central Head, erected a privileged force wherein the sentiment of union was fostered till it became a nationality of the sword.  Nothing more fatal can be done for a country; but for an army it is a simple measure of wisdom. Where the password is MARCH, and not DEVELOP, a body of men, to be a serviceable instrument, must consent to act as one.  Hannibal is the historic example of what a General can accomplish with tribes who are thus, enrolled in a new citizenship; and (as far as we know of him and his fortunes) he appears to be an example of the necessity of the fusing fire of action to congregated aliens in arms.  When Austria was fighting year after year, and being worsted in campaign after campaign, she lost foot by foot, but she held together soundly; and more than the baptism, the atmosphere of strife has always been required to give her a healthy vitality as a centralized empire.  She knew it; this (apart from the famous promptitude of the Hapsburgs) was one secret of her dauntless readiness to fight.  War did the work of a smithy for the iron and steel holding her together; and but that war costs money, she would have been an empire distinguished by aggressiveness.  The next best medicinal thing to war is the military occupation of insurgent provinces.  The soldiery soon feel where their home is, and feel the pride of atomies in unitive power, when they are sneered at, hooted, pelted, stabbed upon a gross misinterpretation of the slightest of moral offences, shamefully abused for doing their duty with a considerate sense of it, and too accurately divided from the inhabitants of the land they hold.  In Italy, the German, the Czech, the Magyar, the Croft, even in general instances the Italian, clung to the standard for safety, for pay, for glory, and all became pre-eminently Austrian soldiers; little besides.  It was against a power thus bound in iron hoops, that Italy, dismembered, and jealous, and corrupt, with an organization promoted by passion chiefly, was preparing to rise.  In the end, a country true to itself and determined to claim God's gift to brave men will overmatch a mere army, however solid its force.  But an inspired energy of faith is demanded of it.  The intervening chapters will show pitiable weakness, and such a schooling of disaster as makes men, looking on the surface of things, deem the struggle folly.  As well, they might say, let yonder scuffling vagabonds up any of the Veronese side-streets fall upon the patrol marching like one man, and hope to overcome them!  In Vienna there was often despair: but it never existed in the Austrian camp.  Vienna was frequently double-dealing and time-serving her force in arms was like a trained man feeling his muscle.  Thus, when the Government thought of temporizing, they issued orders to Generals whose one idea was to strike the blow of a mallet.  At this period there was no suspicion of any grand revolt being in process of development.  The abounding dissatisfaction was treated as nothing more than the Italian disease showing symptoms here and there, and Vienna counselled measures mildly repressive,--'conciliating,' it was her pleasure to call them.  Her recent commands with respect to turbulent Venice were the subject of criticism among the circle outside the Piazza Gaffe.  An enforced inactivity of the military legs will quicken the military wits, it would appear, for some of the younger officers spoke hotly as to their notion of the method of ruling Venezia.  One had bidden his Herr General to 'look here,' while he stretched forth his hand and declared that Italians were like women, and wanted--yes, wanted--(their instinct called for it) a beating, a real beating; as the emphatic would say in our vernacular, a thundering thrashing, once a month:-'Or so,' the General added acquiescingly.  A thundering thrashing, once a month or so, to these unruly Italians, because they are like women!  It was a youth who spoke, but none doubted his acquaintance with women, or cared to suggest that his education in that department of knowledge was an insufficient guarantee for his fitness to govern Venezia.  Two young dragoon officers had approached during the fervid allocution, and after the salute to their superior, caught up chairs and stamped them down, thereupon calling for the loan of anybody's cigar-case.  Where it is that an Austrian officer ordinarily keeps this instrument so necessary to his comfort, and obnoxious, one would suppose, to the rigid correctness of his shapely costume, we cannot easily guess.  None can tell even where he stows away his pocket-handkerchief, or haply his purse.  However, these things appear on demand.  Several elongated cigar-cases were thrust forward, and then it was seen that the attire of the gallant youngsters was in disorder.  'Did you hunt her to earth?' they were asked.  The reply trenched on philosophy; and consisted in an inquiry as to who cared for the whole basketful--of the like description of damsels, being implied.  Immoderate and uproarious laughter burst around them.  Both seemed to have been clawed impartially.  Their tightfitting coats bulged at the breast or opened at the waist, as though buttons were lacking, and the whiteness of that garment cried aloud for the purification of pipeclay.  Questions flew.  The damsel who had been pursued was known as a pretty girl, the daughter of a blacksmith, and no prolonged resistance was expected from one of her class.  But, as it came out, she had said, a week past, 'I shall be stabbed if I am seen talking to you'; and therefore the odd matter was, not that she had, in tripping down the Piazza with her rogue-eyed cousin from Milan, looked away and declined all invitation to moderate her pace and to converse, but that, after doubling down and about lonely streets, the length of which she ran as swiftly as her feet would carry her, at a corner of the Via Colomba she allowed herself to be caught--wilfully, beyond a doubt, seeing that she was not a bit breathed--allowed one quick taste of her lips, and then shrieked as naturally as a netted bird, and brought a hustling crowd just at that particular point to her rescue: not less than fifty, and all men. 'Not a woman among them!' the excited young officer repeated.  A veteran in similar affairs could see that he had the wish to remain undisturbed in his bewilderment at the damsel's conduct.  Profound belief in her partiality for him perplexed his recent experience rather agreeably.  Indeed, it was at this epoch an article of faith with the Austrian military that nothing save terror of their males kept sweet Italian women from the expression of their preference for the broad- shouldered, thick-limbed, yellow-haired warriors--the contrast to themselves which is supposed greatly to inspirit genial Cupid in the selection from his quiver.  'What became of her?  Did you let her go?' came pestering remarks, too absurd for replies if they had not been so persistent.  'Let her go?  In the devil's name, how was I to keep my hold of her in a crowd of fifty of the fellows, all mowing, and hustling, and elbowing-- every rascal stinking right under my nose like the pit?'  ''Hem!' went the General present.  'As long as you did not draw! Unsheathe, a minute.'  He motioned for a sight of their naked swords.  The couple of young officers flushed.  'Herr General!  Pardon!' they remonstrated.  'No, no.  I know how boys talk; I've been one myself.  Tutt!  You tell the truth, of course; but the business is for me to know in what! how far!  Your swords, gentlemen.'  'But, General!'  'Well?  I merely wish to examine the blades.'  'Do you doubt our words?'  'Hark at them!  Words?  Are you lawyers?  A soldier deals in acts.  I don't want to know your words, but your deeds, my gallant lads.  I want to look at the blades of your swords, my children.  What was the last order?  That on no account were we to provoke, or, if possibly to be avoided, accept a collision, etc., etc.  The soldier in peace is a citizen, etc.  No sword on any"]]]
