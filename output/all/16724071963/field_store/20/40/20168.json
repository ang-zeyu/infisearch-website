She may have been indiscreet in some way I am compelled to admit the existence of possibilities.'  'Of all men, you, Agostino!  You call her daughter, and profess to love her.'  'You forget,' said Agostino sharply.  'The question concerns the country, not the girl.'  He added in an underbreath, 'I think you are professing that you love her a little too strongly, and scarce give her much help as an advocate.  The matter must be looked into.  If Barto shall be found to have acted without just grounds, I am certain that Count Medole'--he turned suavely to the nobleman--'will withdraw confidence from him; and that will be equivalent to a rope's-end for Barto.  We shall see him to- night at your house?'  'He will be there,' Medole said.  'But the harm's done; the mischief's done!  And what's to follow if you shall choose to consider this vile idiot justified?' asked Ammiani.  'She sings, and there is no rising,' said Medole.  'She is detached from the patriotic battery, for the moment: it will be better for her not to sing at all,' said Agostino.  'In fact, Barto has merely given us warning that--and things look like it--the Fifteenth is likely to be an Austrian feast-day.  Your arm, my son.  We will join you to-night, my dear Count.  Now, Carlo, I was observing, it appears to me that the Austrians are not going to be surprised by us, and it affords me exquisite comfort.  Fellows prepared are never more than prepared for one day and another day; and they are sure to be in a state of lax preparation after a first and second disappointment.  On the contrary, fellows surprised'--Agostino had recovered his old smile again--'fellows surprised may be expected to make use of the inspirations pertaining to genius.  Don't you see?'  'Oh, cruel!  I am sick of you all!' Carlo exclaimed.  'Look at her; think of her, with her pure dream of Italy and her noble devotion.  And you permit a doubt to be cast on her!'  'Now, is it not true that you have an idea of the country not being worthy of her?' said Agostino, slyly.  'The Chief, I fancy, did not take certain facts into his calculation when he pleaded that the conspiratrix was the sum and completion of the conspirator.  You will come to Medole's to-night, Carlo.  You need not be too sweet to him, but beware of explosiveness.  I, a Republican, am nevertheless a practical exponent of the sacrifices necessary to unity.  I accept the local leadership of Medole--on whom I can never look without thinking of an unfeathered pie; and I submit to be assisted by the man Barto Rizzo.  Do thou likewise, my son.  Let your enamoured sensations follow that duty, and with a breezy space between.  A conspiracy is an epitome of humanity, with a boiling power beneath it.  You're no more than a bit of mechanism--happy if it goes at all!'  Agostino said that he would pay a visit to Vittoria in the evening. Ammiani had determined to hunt out Barto Rizzo and the heads of the Clubs before he saw her.  It was a relief to him to behold in the Piazza the Englishman who had exchanged cards with him on the Motterone.  Captain Gambier advanced upon a ceremonious bow, saying frankly, in a more colloquial French than he had employed at their first interview, that he had to apologize for his conduct, and to request monsieur's excuse. 'If,' he pursued, 'that lady is the person whom I knew formerly in England as Mademoiselle Belloni, and is now known as Mademoiselle Vittoria Campa, may I beg you to inform her that, according to what I have heard, she is likely to be in some danger to-morrow?'  What the exact nature of the danger was, Captain Gambier could not say.  Ammiani replied: 'She is in need of all her friends,' and took the pressure of the Englishman's hand, who would fair have asked more but for the stately courtesy of the Italian's withdrawing salute.  Ammiani could no longer doubt that Vittoria's implication in the conspiracy was known.     CHAPTER XI  LAURA PIAVENI  After dark on the same day antecedent to the outbreak, Vittoria, with her faithful Beppo at her heels, left her mother to run and pass one comforting hour in the society of the Signora Laura Piaveni and her children.  There were two daughters of a parasitical Italian nobleman, of whom one had married the patriot Giacomo Piaveni, and one an Austrian diplomatist, the Commendatore Graf von Lenkenstein.  Count Serabiglione was traditionally parasitical.  His ancestors all had moved in Courts. The children of the House had illustrious sponsors.  The House itself was a symbolical sunflower constantly turning toward Royalty.  Great excuses are to be made for this, the last male descendant, whose father in his youth had been an Imperial page, and who had been nursed in the conception that Italy (or at least Lombardy) was a natural fief of Austria, allied by instinct and by interest to the holders of the Alps. Count Serabiglione mixed little with his countrymen,--the statement might be inversed,--but when, perchance, he was among them, he talked willingly of the Tedeschi, and voluntarily declared them to be gross, obstinate, offensive-bears, in short.  At such times he would intimate in any cordial ear that the serpent was probably a match for the bear in a game of skill, and that the wisdom of the serpent was shown in his selection of the bear as his master, since, by the ordination of circumstances, master he must have.  The count would speak pityingly of the poor depraved intellects which admitted the possibility of a coming Kingdom of Italy united: the lunatics who preached of it he considered a sort of self-elected targets for appointed files of Tyrolese jagers.  But he was vindictive against him whom he called the professional doctrinaire, and he had vile names for the man.  Acknowledging that Italy mourned her present woes, he charged this man with the crime of originating them:-- and why? what was his object?  He was, the count declared in answer, a born intriguer, a lover of blood, mad for the smell of it!--an Old Man of the Mountain; a sheaf of assassins; and more--the curse of Italy!  There should be extradition treaties all over the world to bring this arch- conspirator to justice.  The door of his conscience had been knocked at by a thousand bleeding ghosts, and nothing had opened to them.  What was Italy in his eyes?  A chess-board; and Italians were the chessmen to this cold player with live flesh.  England nourished the wretch, that she might undermine the peace of the Continent.  Count Serabiglione would work himself up in the climax of denunciation, and then look abroad frankly as one whose spirit had been relieved.  He hated bad men; and it was besides necessary for him to denounce somebody, and get relief of some kind.  Italians edged away from him.  He was beginning to feel that he had no country.  The detested title 'Young Italy' hurried him into fits of wrath.  'I am,' he said, 'one of the Old Italians, if a distinction is to be made.'  He assured his listeners that he was for his commune, his district, and aired his old-Italian prejudices delightedly; clapping his hands to the quarrels of Milan and Brescia; Florence and Siena--haply the feuds of villages--and the common North-Italian jealousy of the chief city.  He had numerous capital tales to tell of village feuds, their date and origin, the stupid effort to heal them, and the wider consequent split; saying, 'We have, all Italians, the tenacity, the unforgiveness, the fervent blood of pure Hebrews; and a little more gaiety, perhaps; together with a love of fair things.  We can outlive ten races of conquerors.'  In this fashion he philosophized, or forced a kind of philosophy.  But he had married his daughter to an Austrian, which was what his countrymen could not overlook, and they made him feel it.  Little by little, half acquiescing, half protesting, and gradually denationalized, the count was edged out of Italian society, save of the parasitical class, which he very much despised.  He was not a happy man.  Success at the Imperial Court might have comforted him; but a remorseless sensitiveness of his nature tripped his steps.  Bitter laughter rang throughout Lombardy when, in spite of his efforts to save his daughter's husband, Giacomo Piaveni suffered death.  No harder blow had ever befallen the count: it was as good as a public proclamation that he possessed small influence.  To have bent the knee was not afflicting to this nobleman's conscience: but it was an anguish to think of having bent the knee for nothing.  Giacomo Piaveni was a noble Italian of the young blood, son of a General loved by Eugene.  In him the loss of Italy was deplorable.  He perished by treachery at the age of twenty-three years.  So splendid was this youth in appearance, of so sweet a manner with women, and altogether so- gentle and gallant, that it was a widowhood for women to have known him: and at his death the hearts of two women who had loved him in rivalry became bound by a sacred tie of friendship.  He, though not of distinguished birth, had the choice of an almost royal alliance in the first blush of his manhood.  He refused his chance, pleading in excuse to Count Serabiglione, that he was in love with that nobleman's daughter, Laura; which it flattered the count to hear, but he had ever after a contempt for the young man's discretion, and was observed to shrug, with the smooth sorrowfulness of one who has been a prophet, on the day when Giacomo was shot.  The larger estates of the Piaveni family, then in Giacomo's hands, were in a famous cheese-making district, producing a delicious cheese:--'white as lambkins!' the count would ejaculate most dolefully; and in a rapture of admiration, 'You would say, a marble quarry when you cut into it.'  The theme was afflicting, for all the estates of Giacomo were for the time forfeit, and the pleasant agitation produced among his senses by the mention of the cheese reminded him at the same instant that he had to support a widow with"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4436"],["title","Vittoria — Volume 2 (#7)"],["body","children.  The Signora Piaveni lived in Milan, and the count her father visited her twice during the summer months, and wrote to her from his fitful Winter residences in various capital cities, to report progress in the settled scheme for the recovery of Giacomo's property, as well for his widow as for the heirs of his body.  'It is a duty,' Count Serabiglione said emphatically.  'My daughter can entertain no proposal until her children are duly established; or would she, who is young and lovely and archly capricious, continue to decline the very best offers of the Milanese nobility, and live on one flat in an old quarter of the city, instead of in a bright and handsome street, musical with equipages, and full of the shows of life?'  In conjunction with certain friends of the signora, the count worked diligently for the immediate restitution of the estates.  He was ably seconded by the young princess of Schyll-Weilingen,--by marriage countess of Fohrendorf, duchess of Graatli, in central Germany, by which title she passed,--an Austrian princess; she who had loved Giacomo, and would have given all for him, and who now loved his widow.  The extreme and painful difficulty was that the Signora Piaveni made no concealment of her abhorrence of the House of Austria, and hatred of Austrian rule in Italy. The spirit of her dead husband had come to her from the grave, and warmed a frame previously indifferent to anything save his personal merits.  It had been covertly communicated to her that if she performed due submission to the authorities, and lived for six months in good legal, that is to say, nonpatriotic odour, she might hope to have the estates. The duchess had obtained this mercy for her, and it was much; for Giacomo's scheme of revolt had been conceived with a subtlety of genius, and contrived on a scale sufficient to incense any despotic lord of such a glorious milch-cow as Lombardy.  Unhappily the signora was more inspired by the remembrance of her husband than by consideration for her children.  She received disaffected persons: she subscribed her money ostentatiously for notoriously patriotic purposes; and she who, in her father's Como villa, had been a shy speechless girl, nothing more than beautiful, had become celebrated for her public letters, and the ardour of declamation against the foreigner which characterized her style.  In the face of such facts, the estates continued to be withheld from her governance.  Austria could do that: she could wreak her spite against the woman, but she respected her own law even in a conquered land: the estates were not confiscated, and not absolutely sequestrated; and, indeed, money coming from them had been sent to her for the education of her children.  It lay in unopened official envelopes, piled one upon another, quarterly remittances, horrible as blood of slaughter in her sight.  Count Serabiglione made a point of counting the packets always within the first five minutes of a visit to his daughter.  He said nothing, but was careful to see to the proper working of the lock of the cupboard where the precious deposits were kept, and sometimes in forgetfulness he carried off the key.  When his daughter reclaimed it, she observed, 'Pray believe me quite as anxious as yourself to preserve these documents.'  And the count answered, 'They represent the estates, and are of legal value, though the amount is small.  They represent your protest, and the admission of your claim.  They are priceless.'  In some degree, also, they compensated him for the expense he was put to in providing for his daughter's subsistence and that of her children. For there, at all events, visible before his eyes, was the value of the money, if not the money expended.  He remonstrated with Laura for leaving it more than necessarily exposed.  She replied,  'My people know what that money means!' implying, of course, that no one in her house would consequently touch it.  Yet it was reserved for the count to find it gone.  The discovery was made by the astounded nobleman on the day preceding Vittoria's appearance at La Scala.  His daughter being absent, he had visited the cupboard merely to satisfy an habitual curiosity.  The cupboard was open, and had evidently been ransacked.  He rang up the domestics, and would have charged them all with having done violence to the key, but that on reflection he considered this to be a way of binding faggots together, and he resolved to take them one by one, like the threading Jesuit that he was, and so get a Judas.  Laura's return saved him from much exercise of his peculiar skill.  She, with a cool 'Ebbene!' asked him how long he had expected the money to remain there.  Upon which, enraged, he accused her of devoting the money to the accursed patriotic cause.  And here they came to a curious open division.  'Be content, my father,' she said; 'the money is my husband's, and is expended on his behalf.'  'You waste it among the people who were the cause of his ruin!' her father retorted.  'You presume me to have returned it to the Government, possibly?'  'I charge you with tossing it to your so-called patriots.'  'Sir, if I have done that, I have done well.'  'Hear her!' cried the count to the attentive ceiling; and addressing her with an ironical 'madame,' he begged permission to inquire of her whether haply she might be the person in the pay of Revolutionists who was about to appear at La Scala, under the name of the Signorina Vittoria.  'For you are getting dramatic in your pose, my Laura,' he added, familiarizing the colder tone of his irony.  'You are beginning to stand easily in attitudes of defiance to your own father.'  'That I may practise how to provoke a paternal Government, you mean,' she rejoined, and was quite a match for him in dialectics.  The count chanced to allude further to the Signorina Vittoria.  'Do you know much of that lady?' she asked.  'As much as is known,' said he.  They looked at one another; the count thinking, 'I gave to this girl an excess of brains, in my folly!'  Compelled to drop his eyes, and vexed by the tacit defeat, he pursued, 'You expect great things from her?'  'Great,' said his daughter.  'Well, well,' he murmured acquiescingly, while sounding within himself for the part to play.  'Well-yes!  she may do what you expect.'  'There is not the slightest doubt of her capacity,' said his daughter, in a tone of such perfect conviction that the count was immediately and irresistibly tempted to play the part of sagacious, kindly, tolerant but foreseeing father; and in this becoming character he exposed the risks her party ran in trusting anything of weight to a woman.  Not that he decried women.  Out of their sphere he did not trust them, and he simply objected to them when out of their sphere: the last four words being uttered staccato.  'But we trust her to do what she has undertaken to do,' said Laura.  The count brightened prodigiously from his suspicion to a certainty; and as he was still smiling at the egregious trap his clever but unskilled daughter had fallen into, he found himself listening incredulously to her plain additional sentence:--  'She has easy command of three octaves.'  By which the allusion was transformed from politics to Art.  Had Laura reserved this cunning turn a little further, yielding to the natural temptation to increase the shock of the antithetical battery, she would have betrayed herself: but it came at the right moment: the count gave up his arms.  He told her that this Signorina Vittoria was suspected.  'Whom will they not suspect!' interjected Laura.  He assured her that if a conspiracy had ripened it must fail.  She was to believe that he abhorred the part of a spy or informer, but he was bound, since she was reckless, to watch over his daughter; and also bound, that he might be of service to her, to earn by service to others as much power as he could reasonably hope to obtain.  Laura signified that he argued excellently well.  In a fit of unjustified doubt of her sincerity, he complained, with a querulous snap:  'You have your own ideas; you have your own ideas.  You think me this and that.  A man must be employed.'  'And this is to account for your occupation?' she remarked.  'Employed, I say!' the count reiterated fretfully.  He was unmasking to no purpose, and felt himself as on a slope, having given his adversary vantage.  'So that there is no choice for you, do you mean?'  The count set up a staggering affirmative, but knocked it over with its natural enemy as soon as his daughter had said, 'Not being for Italy, you must necessarily be against her:--I admit that to be the position!'  'No!' he cried; 'no: there is no question of \"for\" or \"against,\" as you are aware.  \"Italy, and not Revolution\": that is my motto.'  'Or, in other words, \"The impossible,\"' said Laura.  'A perfect motto!'  Again the count looked at her, with the remorseful thought: 'I certainly gave you too much brains.'  He smiled: 'If you could only believe it not impossible!'  'Do you really imagine that \"Italy without Revolution\" does not mean \"Austria\"?' she inquired.  She had discovered how much he, and therefore his party, suspected, and now she had reasons for wishing him away.  Not daring to show symptoms of restlessness, she offered him the chance of recovering himself on the crutches of an explanation.  He accepted the assistance, praising his wits for their sprightly divination, and went through a long-winded statement of his views for the welfare of Italy, quoting his favourite Berni frequently, and forcing the occasion for that jolly poet.  Laura gave quiet attention to all, and when he was exhausted at the close, said meditatively, 'Yes.  Well; you are older.  It may seem to you that I shall think as you do when I have had a similar, or the same, length of experience.'  This provoking reply caused her father to jump up from his chair and spin round for his hat.  She rose to speed him forth.  'It may seem to"]]]
