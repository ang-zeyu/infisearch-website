Her innocent china-blue eyes and flaxen braids were in strange contrast to the mad love of glittering wealth which was supposed to fill her heart:     Give to me the flowing bowl,       And Pleasure's glittering crown;    The path of Pride shall be my goal,       And conscience's voice I'll drown!  Then Blanche sweetly admonished her:     Oh! lay aside your idle boasts,       No Pleasure thus you'll find;    The flowing bowl a serpent is       To poison Soul and Mind.     Oh, sign our pledge, while yet you can,       Nor look upon the Wine    When it is red within the Cup,       Let not its curse be thine!  Thereupon the frivolous creature repents of her waywardness, and the two little girls join hands and recite in unison:     We will destroy this giant King,    And drive him from our land;    And on the side of Temp-er-ance    We'll surely take our stand!  and the piece was over.  Robert Roblin Watson (otherwise known as Bugsey), who had that very day been installed as a member of the Band of Hope, after he had avowed his determination \"never to touch, taste nor handle alcoholic stimulants in any form as a beverage and to discourage all traffic in the same,\" was the next gentleman on the programme. Pearlie was sure Bugsey's selection was suitable. She whispered to him the very last minute not to forget his bow, but he did forget it, and was off like a shot into his piece.     I belong to the Band of Hope,    Never to drink and never to smoke;    To love my parents and Uncle Sam,    Keep Alcohol out of my diaphragm;    To say my prayers when I go to bed,    And not put the bedclothes over my head;    Fill up my lungs with oxygen,    And be kind to every living thing.  There! I guess there can't be no kick about that, Pearl thought to herself as Bugsey finished, and the applause rang out loud and louder.  Pearlie had forgotten to tell Bugsey to come down when he was done, and so he stood irresolute, as the applause grew more and more deafening. Pearl beckoned and waved and at last got him safely landed, and when Mrs. White announced that to-day was Taffy Day, owing to Miss Barner's kindness, Bugsey's cup of happiness was full. Miss Barner said she had an extra big piece for the youngest member, Master Danny Watson. Pearlie had not allowed any person to mention taffy to him because Danny could not bear to be disappointed.  But there were no disappointments that day. Taffy enough for every one, amber-coloured taffy slabs with nuts in it, cream taffy in luscious nuggets, curly twists of brown and yellow taffy. Oh look, there's another plateful! and it's coming this way. \"Have some more, Danny. Oh, take a bigger piece, there's lots of it.\" Was it a dream?  When the last little Band of Hoper had left the vestry, Mary Barner sat alone with her thoughts, looking with unseeing eyes at the red and silver mottoes on the wall. Pledge cards which the children had signed were gaily strung together with ribbons across the wall behind her. She was thinking of the little people who had just gone--how would it be with them in the years to come?--they were so sweet and pure and lovely now. Unconsciously she bowed her head on her hands, and a cry quivered from her heart. The yellow sunlight made a ripple of golden water on the wall behind her and threw a wavering radiance on her soft brown hair.  It was at that moment that the Rev. Hugh Grantley, the new Presbyterian minister, opened the vestry door.    CHAPTER V  THE RELICT OF THE LATE MCGUIRE  Close beside the Watson estate with its strangely shaped dwelling stood another small house, which was the earthly abode of one Mrs. McGuire, also of Irish extraction, who had been a widow for forty years. Mrs. McGuire was a tall, raw-boned, angular woman with piercing black eyes, and a firm forbidding jaw. One look at Mrs. McGuire usually made a book agent forget the name of his book. When she shut her mouth, no lips were visible; her upturned nose seemed seriously to contemplate running up under her sun bonnet to escape from this wicked world with all its troubling, and especially from John Watson, his wife and his family of nine.  One fruitful cause of dispute between Mrs. McGuire and the Watsons was the boundary line between the two estates. In the spring Mrs. Watson and the boys put up a fence of green poplar poles where they thought the fence should be, hoping that it might serve the double purpose of dividing the lots and be a social barrier between them and the relict of the late McGuire. The relict watched and waited and said not a word, but it was the ominous silence that comes before the hail.  Mrs. McGuire hated the Watson family collectively, but it was upon John Watson, the man of few words, that she lavished the whole wealth of her South of Ireland hatred, for John Watson had on more than one occasion got the better of her in a wordy encounter.  One time when the boundary dispute was at its height, she had burst upon John as he went to his work in the morning, with a storm of far-reaching and comprehensive epithets. She gave him the history of the Watson family, past, present, and future--especially the future; every Watson that ever left Ireland came in for a brief but pungent notice.  John stood thoughtfully rubbing his chin, and when she stopped, not from lack of words, but from lack of breath, he slowly remarked:  \"Mistress McGuire, yer a lady.\"  \"Yer a liar!\" she snapped back, with a still more eloquent burst of invectives.  John lighted his pipe with great deliberation, and when it was drawing nicely he took it from his mouth and said, more to himself than to her:  \"Stay where ye are, Pat McGuire. It may be hot where ye are, but it would be hotter for ye if ye were here, and ye'd jist have the throuble o' movin'. Stay where ye are, Pat, wherever ye are.\" He walked away leaving Mrs. McGuire with the uncomfortable feeling that he had some way got the best of her.  The Watsons had planted their potatoes beside the fence, and did not dream of evil. But one morning in the early autumn, the earliest little Watson who went out to get a basin of water out of the rain barrel, to wash the \"sleeps\" out of his eyes, dropped the basin in his astonishment, for the fence was gone--it was removed to Mrs. McGuire's woodpile, and the lady herself was industriously digging the potatoes.  Bugsey, for he was the early little bird, ran back into the house screaming:  \"She's robbed us! She's robbed us! and tuk our fence.\"  The Watson family gathered as quickly as a fire brigade at the sound of the gong, but in the scramble for garments some were less fortunate than others. Wee Tommy, who was a little heavier sleeper than the others, could find nothing to put on but one overshoe and an old chest protector of his mother's, but he arrived at the front, nevertheless. Tommy was not the boy to desert his family for any minor consideration such as clothes.  Mrs. McGuire leaned on her hoe and nonchalantly regarded the gathering forces. She had often thought out the scene, and her air of indifference was somewhat overdone.  The fence was on her ground, so it was, and so were two rows of the potatoes. She could do what she liked with her own, so she could. She didn't ask them to plant potatoes on her ground. If they wanted to stand there gawkin' at her, they wur welcome. She always did like comp'ny; but she was afraid the childer would catch cowld, they were dressed so loight for so late in the season. She picked up the last pailful as she spoke, and retired into her own house, leaving the Watson family to do the same.  Mrs. Watson counselled peace. John ate his breakfast in silence; but the young Watsons, and even Pearlie, thirsted for revenge. Bugsey Watson forgot his Band of Hope teaching of returning good for evil, and standing on the disputed territory, he planted his little bare legs far apart and shouted, dancing up and down to the rhythm:     Chew tobacco, chew tobacco,       Spit, spit, spit!    Old McGuire, old McGuire,       Nit, nit, nit!  Mrs. McGuire did occasionally draw comfort from an old clay pipe--but Bugsey's punishment was near.  A long shadow fell upon him, and turning around he found himself face to face with Mary Barner who stood spellbound, listening to her lately installed Band of Hoper!  Bugsey's downfall was complete! He turned and ran down the road and round behind an elevator, where half an hour later Pearl found him shedding penitential tears, not alas! because he had sinned, but because he had been found out.  The maternal instinct was strong in Pearlie. Bugsey in tears was in need of consolation; Bugsey was always in need of admonition. So she combined them:  \"Don't cry, alannah. Maybe Miss Barner didn't hear yez at all at all. Ladies like her do be thinkin' great thoughts and never knowin' what's forninst them. Mrs. Francis never knows what ye'r sayin' to her at the toime; ye could say 'chew tobacco, chew tobacco' all ye liked before her; but what for did ye sass owld lady McGuire? Haven't I towld ye time out of mind that a soft answer turns away wrath, and forbye makes them madder than anything ye could say to them?\"  Bugsey tearfully declared he would never go to Band of Hope again. Taffy or no taffy, he could not bear to face her.  \"Go tell her, Bugsey man,\" Pearlie urged. \"Tell her ye'r sorry. I w'uldn't mind tellin' Miss Barner anything. Even if I'd kilt a man and hid his corp, she's the very one I'd git to help me to give me a h'ist with him into the river, she's that good and swate.\"  The subject of this doubtful compliment had come down so early that morning believing that Mrs. McGuire was confined to her bed with rheumatism. Seeing the object of her solicitude up and about, she would have returned without knowing what had happened; but Bugsey's remarkable musical turn decided her that Mrs. McGuire was suffering from worse than a rheumatic knee. She went into the little house, and heard all about it.  When she went home a little later"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4376"],["title","Sowing Seeds in Danny (#6)"],["body","found Robert Roblin Watson, with resolute heart but hanging head, waiting for her on the back step. What passed between them neither of them ever told, but in a very few minutes Robert Roblin ran gaily homeward, happy in heart, shriven of his sin, and with one little spot on his cheek which tingled with rapture. Better still, he went, like a man, and made his peace with Mrs. McGuire!    CHAPTER VI  THE MUSICAL SENSE  Mrs. Francis, in the sweetest of tea gowns, was intent upon Dr. Ernestus Parker's book on \"Purposeful Motherhood.\" It was the chapter dealing with the \"Musical Sense in Children\" which engrossed Mrs. Francis's attention. She had just begun subdivision C in the chapter, \"When and How the Musical Sense Is Developed,\" when she thought of Danny. She fished into the waste-paper basket for her little red note-book, and with her silver mounted pencil she made the following entry:     DANIEL WATSON,    AGED 4.    MUS. SENSE. DEVELOPED. IF SO, WHEN. IF NOT,    HOW, AND AT ONCE.  She read on feverishly. She felt herself to be in the throes of a great idea.  Then she called Camilla. Camilla is always so practical, she thought.  To Camilla she elaborated the vital points of Dr. Parker's theory of the awakening of the musical sense, reading here and there from the book, rapidly and unintelligibly. She was so excited she was incoherent. Camilla listened patiently, although her thoughts were with her biscuits in the oven below.  \"And now, Camilla,\" she said when she had gone all over the subject, \"how can we awaken the musical sense in Daniel? You know I value your opinion so much.\"  Camilla was ready.  \"Take him to hear Professor Welsman play,\" she said. \"The professor will give his recital here on the 15th.\"  Mrs. Francis wrote rapidly. \"I believe,\" she said looking up, \"your suggestion is a good one. You shall have the credit of it in my notes.\"     Plan of awakening mus. sense suggested by C--.  Camilla smiled. \"Thank you, Mrs. Francis. You are very kind.\"  When Camilla went back to the kitchen and took the biscuits from the oven, she laughed softly to herself.  \"This is going to be a good time for some further suggestions. Pearl must go with Danny. What a treat it will be for poor little Pearl! Then we must have a new suit for Danny, new dress for Pearl, new cap for D., new hat for P., all suggested by C. There are a few suggestions which C. will certainly make.\"  On the evening of the professor's recital there were no two happier people in the audience than Pearlie Watson and her brother Daniel Mulcahey Watson; not because the great professor was about to interpret for them the music of the masters--that was not the cause of their happiness--but because of the good supper they had had and the good clothes they wore, their hearts were glad. They had spent the afternoon at Mrs. Francis's (suggested by C.). Danny's new coat had a velvet collar lovely to feel (suggested by C.). Pearl had a wonderful new dress--the kind she had often dreamed of--made out of one of Mrs. Francis's tea gowns. (Not only suggested but made by C.). It had real buttons on it, and there was not one pin needed. Pearl felt she was just as well dressed as the little girl on the starch box. Her only grief was that when she had on her coat--which was also new, and represented one-half month of Camilla's wages--the velvet on her dress did not show. But Camilla, anticipating this difficulty, laid back the fronts in stunning lapels, and to complete the arrangement, put one of her own lace collars around the neck of the coat, the ends coming down over the turned-back fronts. When Pearl looked in the glass she could not believe her eyes!  Mr. Francis did not attend piano recitals, nor the meetings of the Browning Club. Mrs. Francis was often deeply grieved with James for his indifference in regard to these matters. But the musical sense in James continued to slumber and sleep.  The piano recital by Professor Welsman was given under the auspices of the Ladies' Aid of the Methodist Church, the proceeds to be given toward defraying the cost of the repairs on the parsonage.  The professor was to be assisted by local talent, it said on the programmes. Pearl was a little bit disappointed about the programmes. She had told Danny that there would be a chairman who would say: \"I see the first item on this here programme is remarks by the chair, but as yez all know I ain't no hand at makin' a speech we'll pass on to the next item.\" But there was not a sign of a chairman, not even a chair. The people just came up themselves, without anybody telling them, and did their piece and went back. It looked sort of bold to Pearl.  First the choir came in and sang: \"Praise Waiteth for Thee, O Lord, in Zion.\" Pearl did not like the way they treated her friend Dr. Clay. Twice when he began to sing a little piece by himself, doing all right, too, two or three of them broke in on him and took the words right out of his mouth. Pearl had seen people get slapped faces for things like that. Pearl thought it just served them right when the doctor stopped singing and let them have it their own way.  When the professor came up the aisle everybody leaned forward to have a good look at him. \"He is just like folks only for his hair,\" Pearl thought. Pearl lifted Danny on her knee and told him to look alive now. She knew what they were there for.  Then the professor began to play. Indifferently at first after the manner of his kind, clever gymnastics to limber up his fingers perhaps, and perhaps to show how limber they are; runs and trills, brilliant execution, one hand after the other in mad pursuit, crossing over, back again, up and down in the vain endeavour to come up with the other hand; crescendo, diminuendo, trills again!  Danny yawned widely.  \"When's he goin' to begin?\" he asked, sleepily.  Mrs. Francis watched Danny eagerly. The musical sense was liable to wake up any minute. But it would have to hurry, for Daniel Mulcahey was liable to go to sleep any minute.  Pearl was disgusted with the professor and her thoughts fell into vulgar baseball slang:  \"Playin' to the grand stand, ain't ye? instead o' gettin' down to work. That'll do for ketch and toss. Play the game! Deliver the goods!\"  Then the professor began the full arm chords with sudden fury, writhing upon the stool as he struck the angry notes from the piano. Pearl's indignation ran high.  \"He's lost his head--he's up in the air!\" she shouted, but the words were lost in the clang of musical discords.  But wait! Pearl sat still and listened. There was something doing. It was a Welsh rhapsodie that he was playing. It was all there--the mountains and the rivers, and the towering cliffs with glimpses of the sea where waves foam on the rocks, and sea-fowl wheel and scream in the wind, and then a bit of homely melody as the country folk drive home in the moonlight, singing as only the Welsh can sing, the songs of the heart; songs of love and home, songs of death and sorrowing, that stab with sudden sweetness. A child cries somewhere in the dark, cries for his mother who will come no more. Then a burst of patriotic fire, as the people fling defiance at the conquering foe, and hold the mountain passes till the last man falls. But the glory of the fight and the march of many feet trail off into a wailing chant--the death song of the brave men who have died. The widow mourns, and the little children weep comfortless in their mountain home, and the wind rushes through the forest, and the river foams furiously down the mountain, falling in billows of lace over the rocks, and the sun shines over all, cold and pitiless.  \"Why, Pearlie Watson, what are you crying for?\" Mrs. Francis whispered severely. Pearl's sobs had disturbed her. Danny lay asleep on Pearl's knees, and her tears fell fast on his tangled curls.  \"I ain't cryin', I ain't cryin' a bit. You leave me alone,\" Pearl blubbered rudely, shaking off Mrs Francis's shapely hand.  Mrs. Francis was shocked. What in the world was making Pearl cry?  The next morning Mrs. Francis took out her little red book to enter the result of her experiment, and sat looking long and earnestly at its pages. Then she drew a writing pad toward her and wrote an illuminative article on \"Late Hours a Frequent and Fruitful Cause of Irritability in Children.\"    CHAPTER VII  \"ONE OF MANITOBA'S PROSPEROUS FARMERS\"  Mr. Samuel Motherwell was a wealthy farmer who lived a few miles from Millford. Photographs of Mr. Motherwell's premises may be seen in the agricultural journals, machinery catalogues, advertisements for woven wire, etc.--\"the home of one of Manitoba's prosperous farmers.\"  The farm buildings were in good repair; a large red barn with white trimmings surmounted by a creaking windmill; a long, low machine shed filled with binders, seeders, disc-harrows--everything that is needed for the seed-time and harvest and all that lies between; a large stone house, square and gray, lonely and bare, without a tree or a shrub around it. Mr. Motherwell did not like vines or trees around a house. They were apt to attract lightning and bring vermin.  Potatoes grew from the road to the house; and around the front door, as high as the veranda, weeds flourished in abundance, undisturbed and unnoticed.  Behind the cookhouse a bed of poppies flamed scarlet against the general sombreness, and gave a strange touch of colour to the common grayness. They seemed out of place in the busy farmyard. Everything else was there for use. Everybody hurried but the poppies; idlers of precious time, suggestive of slothful sleep, they held up their brazen faces in careless indifference.  Sam had not planted them--you may be sure of that. Mrs. Motherwell would tell you of an English girl she had had to work for her that summer who had brought the seed with her from England, and of how one day when she sent the girl to weed the onions, she had found her blubbering and crying over what looked to Mrs. Motherwell nothing more"]]]
