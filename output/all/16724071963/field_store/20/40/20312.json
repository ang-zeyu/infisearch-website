This lack of time and care will show itself more in the text than in any other particular. Much of the proof reading was done by the undersigned on board train between Salt Lake and California. To say the least, such surroundings are not conducive to the most finished work. It is hoped that this circumstance will also make the reader more tolerant when encountering mistakes in the text, obviously the result of hasty proof reading.

Whitney also came in. We conversed together some. They state the brethren have made a perfect waste of food and property in the camp.  Thursday, February 19  This morning the ground is covered with snow. It is so windy they cannot cross the river. Continued to snow all day. Evening went to Elder Babbit's to supper with Elder Kimball. President Young was there, Backenstos, J. M. Grant and some others.  Friday, February 20  The weather is very cold and windy. Impossible to cross the river. Spent the day running after things to get ready, fixing wagons and chopping fire wood.  Friday, February 27  We have spent the past week waiting for crossing over the [Mississippi] river. It has been hard frost and much snow. This morning I concluded to start over the river and began early to send my teams. About noon I crossed with my family and then rested the teams and soon after went on to the camp where we arrived a little before four o'clock. Bishop Whitney concluded to stay at the river until morning because some of his teams could not get over. When we got to the camp we were received with joy and formed in the company of the band. The weather is still very cold especially during the night. The distance from Nauvoo to this place is called seven and a half miles.  Saturday, February 28  A.M. arranging my tents, etc. At twelve was sent for to council and about two the band was requested to go and meet bishop Whitney and his teams. We went and met him five miles from the camp. We played some time and then returned to the camp. President Young, Heber C. Kimball, P. P. Pratt, Orson Pratt and others accompanied us. At night played with the band.    March 1846  Sunday, March 1  A.M. preparing to march to the next encampment. At ten a lecture was given by Elder Kimball and about one the company proceeded to the next camp about four and a half miles, where we arrived in good season.  Monday, March 2  Started this morning for another camp about eight miles where we arrived about five p.m., the roads being somewhat hilly and muddy. The band played at night. During the day the artillery company broke into our ranks several times and broke a number of our wagon boxes. At night they complained of us at headquarters, but after hearing our story the matter stood about right.  Tuesday, March 3  Proceeded on our journey through Farmington about eight miles to a place where bishop Miller was encamped and arrived in good season. The band played at night.  Wednesday, March 4  This morning we concluded to stay a day and fix up some wagons which were broken. A number of the citizens from Farmington came to the camp and gave a very pressing invitation for the band to go to Farmington and play some. Accordingly about three o'clock, the band started and arrived at Farmington about 4:30 p.m. We played at the principal hotel and then went to the school house and played till nearly dark. The house was filled with men and women, the leading people of the place. We then returned to the hotel where they had provided us with a good supper. They also gave us $5 in money. John Kay sang a number of songs. At eight o'clock we returned and when we left they gave us three cheers. When we arrived at the camp we met thirty of the guard just starting out to meet us. The President felt uneasy at our staying so long and was sending the men to protect us.  Thursday, March 5  Proceeded on our journey. Crossed the Des Moines river at Bonaparte and afterwards had a very bad road up the bluff for several miles which detained us until late in the afternoon. We stopped awhile to feed the band teams inasmuch as they had none this morning. We then started and went to the next camping ground, making the day's journey about sixteen miles.  Saturday, March 7  Proceeded about eight miles to a camp ground near to a Dr. Elberts where the band camped. President Young was behind and when he arrived he went on about eight miles farther. The band went to work splitting rails for corn and made before dark, about 1:30. In the evening Dr. Elbert and some others came to hear the band play. Kay sang some songs which pleased them.  Sunday, March 8  Waited for orders from headquarters. Many of the citizens came to hear the band play and gave us a very pressing invitation to go to Keosaugua and give a concert. About noon word came that we should follow on to the camp. We immediately struck tents and started and we arrived at the main camp about five o'clock. Some of the citizens from Keosaugua followed us waiting for an answer whether we would give a concert as soon as we arrived at the camp. I asked the President whether the band should go to Keosaugua to give a concert. He advised us to go and I immediately sent out the appointment and then we pitched our tents forming a line on the road opposite to the President's company.  Monday, March 9  Spent the day chiefly preparing for the concert and attending on my family.  Tuesday, March 10  The weather still continues fine. Spent the morning preparing for the concert and about one o'clock p.m. started in company with the brass band for Keosaugua. I rode in Elder Kimball's wagon with William Kimball, J. Smithies and Wm. Pitt. The distance from the camp to Keosaugua is about ten miles, the camp being at a place called Richardson's point. We arrived at Keosaugua about three o'clock and being requested we went through the town and played some. One of the grocery keepers invited us to play him a tune which we did. He then invited us in and offered to treat us to anything he had. We each took a little and then the next grocery keeper sent an invitation for us to play him a tune. We did so and he also gave us anything he had. A beer keeper next sent word that he did not want us to slight him and we went and played him a tune and then took some of his cake and beer. We then marched up to the Des Moines hotel near the court-house where we had ordered supper and after eating we went to the courthouse to prepare for the concert. At seven o'clock the house was crowded and we commenced, playing and singing till about 9:30. The audience seemed highly pleased and gave loud applause. About the close one of the citizens got up and said it was the wish of many that we should repeat the concert the following evening and he took a vote of all who wished us to go again. The vote was unanimous. We made nearly $25.00 clear of all expenses. We started back for the camp soon after ten and arrived about one o'clock all well and pleased.  Wednesday, March 11  In the morning I reported to President Young our success and the request of the citizens of Keosaugua and he advised us to go again. We accordingly started about eleven o'clock. I again rode with William Kimball, Horace Whitney and James Smithies. When we arrived we were welcomed again with the same kind feelings as yesterday. Pitt had a severe chill all the way and when we got there it commenced raining and made it very unpleasant. The house was again filled but we only made $20.00 besides all expenses. We learned that there is a party of socialists there and they and the priests are much opposed to each other. We also learned that a man named McCully was in jail close by under sentence to be hung on the 4th of April for murdering a man and a child. I did not feel so well at the concert as on the night previous on several accounts. We started back between eleven and twelve and got to the camp about three o'clock.  Thursday, March 12  The band moved to better ground about one quarter of a mile farther. The heavy rains had made it very muddy and unpleasant, all our bedding and things being wet.  Friday, March 13  Went hunting.  Saturday, March 14  Wrote a letter to Diantha.  Sunday, March 15  In camp all day.  Monday, March 16  Some of the citizens of Keosaugua came again to request us to give another concert. We agreed to go tomorrow evening.  Tuesday, March 17  Started for Keosaugua with Pitt, Hutchinson, Kay, Smithies and Egan. I took my music box and china to try and sell them. We arrived in good season and soon learned that the priests had been hard at work preventing the sectarians from coming to the concert, saying that it was an"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45051"],["title","William Clayton's Journal (#2)"],["body"," move consequently there were not many present. We had far the best concert which lasted till nine o'clock. We then went over to the hotel, took supper and played for a private party till about three o'clock. We only cleared from both, about $7.00 over expenses but were well treated.  Wednesday, March 18  It rained last night and this morning again and we almost concluded to go to Fairfield, but finally determined to return to camp. We visited with a Mr. Bridgman who treated us very kindly. Bought about eight bushels of beans and some articles for President Young and then returned to camp. It rained some again today. We got back about five o'clock. After dark Dr. Elbert came to see my china and said if I would take it over tomorrow he would buy it.  Thursday, March 19  Went to ask council whether I should go to sell my china. Saw Heber who advised me to go. A few of us started and soon met President Young who said we had better go back and go with the camp who were then starting on their way. We accordingly turned back our horses and struck tents in a hurry. At twelve o'clock we started on our journey. After traveling about six or seven miles we had to go up a very bad bluff which took us till five o'clock. President Young's company went ahead of us and camped three miles from the bluff. Some of our teams gave out and we only went about a mile from the bluff and camped in a little point of timber a little from the road. Our teams were very tired.  Saturday, March 21  We started early in the morning and soon came up with the main body of the camp. I rode ahead about three miles to hunt my cow. We did not have her last night being with the main camp. We traveled nine or ten miles and then rested our teams. We started again and traveled three miles farther where we found the President and Heber camped on the brink of a long bluff. We concluded to go to the other bank which we did and camped in a good place. In the evening the band went and played for the President and Heber and then went to a farmer's house at the owner's request about three quarters of a mile from camp to play for his family. He promised to give us some honey if we would play for him. We played about an hour and then left but neither saw nor heard anything of the honey. We learned afterwards, however, that Hutchinson had a pail under his cloak and got it full of honey after the rest had left the house and kept it to himself, very slyly.  Sunday, March 22  Started again and soon came to the Shariton bottoms which is a very low land for about four miles. The road was bad and it took us sometime to cross. While on the bottom Root and Davis came again. Root had asked permission of President Young to go back to his family some days ago but it seems things did not go to suit him and he followed his team again. It took sometime to go up the bluff. We had to let the teams down into the Shariton river by ropes and also helped them up again by the same means. Our company got over in good season but we concluded to camp after getting up the bluff as it would take till night for the whole to get up. I spent the day helping the teams till I was so sore and tired I could scarcely walk.  Monday, March 23  In council with Brigham, Heber, and others. We found that Miller's company had gone still farther about eight miles instead of waiting till we overtook them so that we could organize. I wrote a letter to them saying if they did not wait or return to organize, the camp would organize without and they be disfellowshiped. We concluded to stay at this place a few days to buy corn to last to Grand river but we found corn scarce and 26c a bushel, the farmers having advanced on account of a disposition to speculate.  Tuesday, March 24 and Wednesday, March 25  At the camp writing, etc. It rained considerably.  Thursday, March 26  Evening in council. Wrote a long letter to be sent to Emmet's company by John Butler and James W. Cummings. This morning wrote another letter to P. P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, George Miller telling them they must wait for us or come back to organize. The letters were sent by Smithies. He met them on the way and about noon P. P. Pratt, Orson Pratt, John Kay and G. Miller came into camp and at 1:00 p.m. the council met. The brethren plead that the charges in the letters were unjust. They had not striven to keep out of the way but had done all for the best. The whole camp accordingly was organized, A. P. Rockwood over 1st 50; Stephen Markham, 2nd 50; Young, 3rd 50; Howard E. Kimball, 4th 50; Charles C. Rich, 5th 50; Charles Crisman, 6th 50. Each fifty had also appointed a contracting commissary for the purpose of contracting for work and grain as follows: Henry Sherwood 1st 50; David H. Kimball 2nd; Wm. H. Edwards 3rd; Peter Haws 4th; Joseph Worthen 5th; Samuel Gully 6th. It was understood that I continue to preside over the band and in the absence of Brother Haws over the whole fifty. After this there was appointed for each fifty a distributing commissary to distribute feed in camp as follows: Charles Kennedy for 1st 50; J. M. Grant 2nd 50; Nathan Tanner 3rd 50; Orson B. Adams 4th 50; James Allred 5th 50; Isaac Allred 6th 50. The brethren then gave the following instructions for the whole camp with orders that same be observed hereafter, viz. No man to set fire to prairies. No man to shoot off a gun in camp without orders. No man to go hunting unless he is sent and all to keep guns, swords and pistols out of sight. There was then appointed a clerk for each fifty as follows: John D. Lee Young, 1st 50; John Pack 2nd 50; Lorenzo Snow 3rd 50; Geo. H. Hales 4th 50; John Oakley 5th 50; A. Lathrop 6th 50. The council then adjourned to meet at Shariton Ford camp on Monday at 10 a.m. We then returned to our camp where we arrived just at dark.  Saturday, March 28  In camp making out forms for clerks of 50's and also copied letter to James Emmet.  Sunday, March 29  Making forms for clerks of 50's and felt quite unwell all day with bad cold.  Monday, March 30  Met with the council. The guard and pioneers were divided and distributed amongst the several companies of 50's. It was also agreed that company No. 4 should go on to the next camp tomorrow and the remainder of the day following. Jackson Redding sold one of Keller's horses for one yoke of oxen, leaving me as bad off for teams as before.  Tuesday, March 31  It was concluded we could not get ready to move until tomorrow. O. P. Rockwell arrived with the mail. I received a letter from Diantha and father. President Young received one from the trustees, one from Matlock and one from E. Pratt which I read in council. I was ordered to write an answer to the trustees' and Matlock's letter, but being late I left it till morning when I was quite unwell. I got two new teamsters, Levi Kendall and Swap.    April 1846  Wednesday, April 1  President Young also sent me two yoke of oxen, wagon, and Brother Jones, the owner, to assist me. We divided the load out of the spare wagons putting a yoke of oxen to each and about 11:00 started on our journey. Mother was very sick, and could not bear to ride. She walked all the way. I felt very unwell myself, having much pain in my limbs. The roads were bad, but we arrived in camp about 2:00 and got on good ground. After getting our tents fixed, fires made, etc., I went to wrestling, jumping etc., to try to get well. I over-exerted myself without any symptoms of perspiration and was so sick after I had to go to bed.  Thursday, April 2  I was very sick all day and unable to write the letters or meet with the council. O. P. Rockwell started back to Nauvoo with letters. One of the Brother Hales arrived to say to his brother who drives team for Pitt that his family is very sick and wants him to go back but we cannot spare the team and he says it is no use for him to go back without it. At night I wrote again to Diantha and sent it by Brother Hale who returns tomorrow.  Friday, April 3  This morning it was decided to start early so as to get over the bad roads and also travel about fifteen miles. We had to send a wagon and team to fetch the eight bushels of corn which some of the band earned by playing last night. We started, however, about eight o'clock. The roads were very bad and when we had traveled about three miles it began to thunder and rain. The clouds gathered fast and it soon showed signs for heavy rain the whole day. We reached Bishop Whitney's camp about noon and rested our teams while the rest came up. We then started again in the heavy rain and bad roads and traveled about three miles to Bishop Miller's camp. We had a very bad bluff to rise and had to double teams to get up. On the top I met Heber camped. He selected a camping ground for us and advised us to go no farther. President Young has gone on six or seven miles. It was about 5:00 before all our teams got up and it rained heavily all the time. Mother walked all day again in the rain. I was very sick myself and unable to do anything. Yesterday the portion of the guard detailed to our company joined in with us, being Orvil M. Allen and eight men. They reported themselves destitute of everything and said they had lived a week on corn meal gruel, Stout and Hunter having made them serve as their body guard and used them very hard. I dealt out some of my own flour and bacon to them, determined to comfort them some if I could and not being willing to see anyone in our company suffer while I have anything left. It continued to rain all night very hard.  Saturday, April 4  This morning all our clothing, beds and bed clothing were drenched and it has continued to rain all day. I have been sick again all day especially towards night. I was so distressed with pain it seemed as though I could not live. I went to bed and put a bag of hot salt on my chest which seemed to give me some ease but I suffered much through the night, and it continued to rain until after midnight. We put an extra cover on our sleeping wagon, which kept "]]]
