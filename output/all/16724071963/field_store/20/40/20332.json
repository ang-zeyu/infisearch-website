At length through sheer exhaustion he ceased his cries, yet he sobbed like a child in his rage and terror. It seemed an eternity, but in reality only three minutes elapsed between the time of the explosion and the unlocking of his prison door.  \"Blow me, ain't the Boche got the wind up?\" remarked one of the bluejackets to his raggie, as the pair lifted the now speechless Hun from the cabin floor, over which the water was rising swiftly, and carried him up the narrow companion-way to the deck.  Very carefully and tenderly the men lifted their enemy into the first boat to be cleared away. In the company of half a dozen badly wounded and scalded men the men pushed off, deeply laden for the high sea that was running.  Placed in the stern sheets and supported by a rolled canvas awning von Brockdorff-Giespert could watch with every roll of the boat the last throes of the British destroyer. Had he not been in peril of being thrown into the sea by the swamping of the boat he might have gloated over the scene. As it was he watched and waited, fervently hoping that before long he would be transferred to a larger and more seaworthy craft.  For several seconds following the final plunge of the torpedoed vessel silence reigned. The wind lulled, the waves were quelled under the influence of the widely-spreading oil. It seemed as if Nature were paying homage to the departed destroyer. Then the silence was broken by shouts of encouragement and exchange of rough, almost incomprehensible banter by men struggling for their lives.  In spite of their efforts--for there were only two oars available--the whaler drifted considerably to leeward of the rest of the boats. Even the Carley rafts were lost to sight in the darkness.  Presently a voice hailed.  \"Boat ahoy! Can you take an officer on board?\"  The stroke boated his oar and peered into the faces of the men lying in the stern-sheets before replying.  \"Right-o,\" he replied.  \"No, don't,\" expostulated von Brockdorff-Giespert. \"Already the boat is overcrowded. It is madness.\"  \"Shut up!\" growled the man, a first-class petty officer. \"Are you running this show, or am I? If it weren't for the likes o' you the likes of us wouldn't be in this bloomin' fix.\"  \"But----\" persisted the Count.  \"Dry up,\" growled the petty officer, \"or into the blinkin' ditch you go pretty sharp! Toss them two overboard, mate,\" he continued, addressing another seaman. \"They won't want any more suppers.\"  It was no time for respect to the dead when the fate of the living was at stake. Without ceremony the corpses of two men who had died of injuries were given to the waves, while willing hands hauled the senseless form of Sub-lieutenant Alec Seton into the boat.  \"Look alive!\" shouted the bowman to Alec's rescuer, who, on noticing the Sub relax his grasp of the beaker, had promptly dived and brought the young officer to the surface. \"Stroke ahead; I'll give you a hand.\"  \"Too many in the boat already, mate,\" was the reply. \"I've a mother living in Lowestoft, and I'll have a shot at swimming there. How far--eighty miles?\"  Without further ado the chivalrous bluejacket turned and began swimming away from the boat.  \"'Ere, no you don't!\" shouted the bowman, and with a quick movement he engaged his boat-hook in the neck of the bluejacket's jumper. \"Plenty of room in the stalls, mate. Two blokes wot booked seats ain't taking 'em up.\"  \"Is that jonnick?\" asked the swimmer suspiciously.  \"Proper jonnick,\" asserted the other.  \"Good enough,\" rejoined Alec's rescuer, and suffered himself to be hauled over the gunwale into a place of at least temporary safety.  For nearly two hours the boat continued to drift in spite of the dogged efforts of the two oarsmen. The breaking of an oar made matters worse, and all that could be done was to keep the whaler stern-on to the waves. Where were the rest of the _Bolero's_ crew, and how they fared, were merely matters for speculation.  Meanwhile the whaler's crew were unremitting in their attention to their disabled messmates, two of the men chafing Alec's numbed limbs in the hope of restoring him to consciousness. In this they succeeded, and presently the Sub opened his eyes.  \"Quite all right, sir,\" said one of the men reassuringly in answer to Alec's unspoken question. \"Just you lie quiet, sir. It'll be dawn very soon, and then we'll be picked up.\"  \"How did I come to be picked up?\" asked Alec.  \"Just hiked on board like any old bundle done up ugly, sir,\" replied the man. \"In a manner of speaking you didn't care whether it was Christmas or Easter.\"  \"I remember,\" continued the Sub. \"A bluejacket--Saunders is his name was--standing by when I was hanging on to the beaker. Where is he?\"  \"Having a caulk on the bottom-boards, sir. He's as right as ninepence; but we've had to heave four of the hands overboard. They were pretty far gone when we put them into the boat.\"  Tediously the night passed. Signs of other movements were absent, with one exception. That was about three in the morning when a sea-plane of unknown nationality passed high overhead. Even her presence would have passed unnoticed, for the whine of the wind completely muffled the noise of the motors, had not the pilot started to use his flashing lamp. Apparently he was calling up a sister sea-plane in code, for the message was unintelligible to the whaler's crew. Nor was there, as far as they could see, any response.  Gradually the dawn began to gain mastery in the south-eastern sky. A rosy hue crept upwards from the misty horizon, betokening a spell of wet and stormy weather. Already the whaler's crew had all their work cut out to prevent the boat being swamped. They were baling incessantly with the solitary baler and their caps. With the increase of wind, and consequently heavier sea, it was doubtful whether the boat could survive, since there was nothing of which to make anything in the nature of a sea-anchor.   [Illustration: \"ENGLISCH OFFIZIER-PIG!\" HE SHOUTED. \"WE YOU TAKE PRISONER\"]   Yet not for one moment did a single British member of the party show signs of being dismayed. Even the badly wounded men cracked jokes with their comrades, while others, whose injuries were of a slighter nature, insisted on being allowed to take their turn at baling.  Von Brockdorff-Giespert, on the other hand, looked the picture of misery and despair. He grumbled incessantly, asserting, with true Hunnish arrogance, that he was being neglected by his captors. It was not until he was sternly threatened, if he did not hold his tongue, that the Count began to realize that there was a limit beyond which even he must not go when in the company of British tars.  \"There's a craft of sorts,\" announced the bowman, who, maintaining a precarious perch on the thwart, was scanning the horizon.  \"Away on the starboard bow. Think she is coming this way.\"  \"Wave your scarf, Lofty,\" suggested another member of the crew.  The man began to unwrap his \"comforter\". Then very abruptly he sat down.  \"We'll hang on a little longer, mates,\" he said in a low voice. \"I don't quite like the look of her. Strikes me she's a Fritz.\"  \"By smoke, you're right!\" exclaimed another, taking a cautious view of the oncoming craft. \"A dirty U-boat. Lie down all hands. 'Ere, you blinkin' Fritz, none of your capers. Stow it!\"  Count Otto von Brockdorff-Giespert, on hearing of the approach of what was apparently a German submarine, was making an effort to stand up and attract his compatriots' attention.  \"It is time for me to do as I like,\" he replied, sneeringly.  \"Is it? Then you're jolly well mistaken,\" retorted the stroke of the whaler, as he ostentatiously spat upon his hands and gripped a boat-stretcher.  The German's beady eyes contracted, and, thinking that discretion is ever the better art of valour, he shrugged his shoulders, and then winced with pain.  There was soon no doubt as to the type and nationality of the approaching craft. She was a U-boat. She was running on the surface. On the platform in the wake of the elongated conning-tower stood two men in black oilskins. At times completely enveloped in clouds of spray, they were intently searching the horizon either on the watch for likely prey or else keeping a sharp look-out for the dreaded British submarine-hunters.  \"Looks like giving us the go-by after all,\" whispered one of the whaler's men, as the U-boat bore broadside on at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile.  \"Let her,\" added his mate fervently. \"Us don't want to see the likes of she just now. I'd give a month's pay to have her at yon range for twenty seconds.\"  \"O, Lud!\" exclaimed another with a grunt \"she's starboarding helm. She's spotted us, lads!\"  Clearly the whaler's crew were \"in the soup\", for the U-boat had altered course and was bearing down upon the luckless British seamen. Four or five hands made their way for'ard of the German craft's conning-tower, and in a few seconds a 4.7-inch gun rose from its place of concealment. Quickly the sinister weapon was manned and trained full at the helpless boat's crew.  \"Murderous swine!\" exclaimed the bowman, shaking his fist in futile defiance of the pirates.  Moments of intense suspense followed, yet the Huns refrained from opening fire. It might have been a matter for precaution that the quick-firer was trained upon the whaler; but, on the other hand, there was abundant evidence in the past to prove that the modern pirates had no scruples about murdering in cold blood the survivors of torpedoed merchantmen.  The while the officers outside the conning-tower were still busy with their binoculars. One of them kept the whaler under observation, while the other, evidently fearing a trap, swept the waste of water in case the periscope of a British submarine were watching Fritz with a view to blowing him to atoms.  Raising himself with his uninjured arm, Count Otto von Brockdorff-Giespert shouted something in German. The distance was still "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/45135"],["title","The Thick of the Fray at Zeebrugge, April 1918 (#6)"],["body","great to enable the U-boat's officers to understand. This time the Count was not called to order, for the whaler's crew knew only too well that the tables had been turned.  Slowing down, and then reversing her engines, the U-boat came to a standstill within twenty yards of the survivors of the _Bolero_.  \"Vot boat is dat?\" hailed the U-boat's unter-leutnant. \"Vere you from? Vot is der name of der schip you vos come from?\"  \"Better tell him civil-like,\" suggested the bow-man. \"So here goes.\"  But von Brockdorff-Giespert again took up his parable. Speaking volubly, he quickly explained matters to his satisfaction. Although none of the British seamen understood German, the purport of the Count's words were sufficiently plain to them.  Interpolated with numerous \"Ja, Herr Kapitan\" from the obsequious unter-leutnant of the U-boat, von Brockdorff-Giespert gave a string of orders. The whaler was then commanded to come alongside, and the Count was assisted on board the submarine.  \"Now,\" thought Alec, \"he's out of it. Wonder if the dirty dogs are going, to turn a machine-gun on us, or ram the boat.\"  His natural curiosity was quickly satisfied, for the unter-leutnant, stepping to the rail, leered down into the boat.  \"Englisch offizier-pig!\" he shouted. \"You der hospitality of Zherman U-boat must make. We you take prisoner.\"     CHAPTER VI  A Prisoner of War   The Sub-lieutenant made the best of a bad job. Although weak with exhaustion and exposure to the elements, he held his head high as he was taken on board the submarine.  The coxswain and stroke of the whaler, who had assisted their young officer, were curtly ordered back. The U-boat was not engaged upon an errand of mercy. It was the British officer who was wanted for a definite purpose. The men did not count. In the eyes of the Germans the hapless British seamen were almost beneath notice, although in other circumstances the Huns would have feared to have met them in fair fight.  As he gained the bulging deck of the pirate craft, Seton, steadying himself by the guard-rail, turned to bid good-bye and good luck to his men. Guessing his intention the unter-leutnant gave a curt order. Instantly two German sailors laid hold of the British officer; and without ceremony took him below.  In the act of descending the vertical ladder, Alec caught sight of Count Otto von Brockdorff-Giespert and the kapitan of the U-boat. Both were vastly enjoying the British officer's discomfiture. Count Otto, in spite of his injuries and dishevelled appearance, was smoking a cigar and holding a steaming cup of \"coffee substitute\".  \"I owe this young Englishman a debt,\" he remarked grimly to the commander of the U-boat. \"I will take good care that I repay it with interest.\"  It was the Prussian touch all over. Von Brockdorff-Giespert totally ignored the fact that his foes had saved his life. He attributed his misfortunes mainly to Sub-lieutenant Seton, as if the latter had been actuated by feelings of personal animosity rather than sheer devotion to duty. Already the Hun had made up his mind to inflict every possible indignity upon the prisoner.  Confined in a cramped, ill-ventilated and ill-lighted compartment in close proximity to the wireless-generator-room, Seton strained his ears in the hope of finding out what had happened to his whaler's crew. The purr of the electric motors and the noise of men's voices echoing and re-echoing in the interior of the huge metal cylinder deadened all sounds from without.  The U-boat was submerging. Apparently she had not used her guns upon the boat, for the recoil of the weapons would have been noticeable. There was, however, the horrible possibility that, before diving, the submarine had deliberately rammed the boat. Or, perhaps the Huns had shot down every man in the whaler by rifle and pistol. That was one of Fritz's little stunts--cold-blooded butchery.  After a while Alec thought it was time to look after himself, since his captors evidently had no intention of attending to his personal comfort. The warmth of the cell caused the moisture to steam from his saturated clothes. Divesting himself of his garments he wrung them out, and began to exercise his limbs to ward off the numbness that assailed them.  Presently the door of his cell was thrown open and a seaman appeared carrying a bowl of hot soup.  \"Can I have my clothes dried?\" asked Alec.  \"It's not my work to dry the clothes of a schweinhund,\" replied the fellow in English. Then he pointed to the Sub's wristlet watch.  \"For that I will dry your things,\" he added.  \"Right,\" replied Alec. \"It isn't going, though. The water's spoilt it.\"  \"That is to be expected,\" rejoined the German, picking up the saturated garments. Then waiting until Alec had handed over his watch, he went out, to return presently with a canvas suit, rust-marked and greasy.  \"In case Herr Kapitan sends for you,\" explained the man, and without another word he again backed out of the compartment and locked the door.  While waiting for the soup to cool, the Sub, with feelings of repugnance, put on the loaned suit. It felt damp and clammy and smelt vilely. As for the soup it was little better than dish-water, greasy and unpalatable, while with deliberate intent an excessive quantity of salt had been put into the liquid. Nevertheless Alec took a considerable quantity, for he was desperately famished, and the hot concoction warmed his chilled body, for even in the warm atmosphere cold chills were persistently passing over him.  For several hours--how long Alec had no accurate idea--the U-boat ran submerged. As far as he could estimate it was about noon when she came to the surface, only to dive again very quickly, to the accompaniment of a couple of bombs from a British sea-plane. Although wide of the mark the explosion of the missiles gave the submarine a nasty shaking up, so much so, that the startled Huns allowed their craft to rest on the bed of the North Sea until nightfall before resuming their course.  It was during this period of enforced detention that Alec was summoned to be examined by Kapitan-leutnant von Kloster.  Clad solely in his borrowed canvas suit, unshaven and unkempt, Alec felt his position keenly. He realized that it was a hard matter to preserve his dignity, when his appearance was like that of a greaser of a third-rate tramp.  Attended by two stolid German seamen the prisoner was taken to the kapitan's cabin. Seated on a settee by a narrow folding table were Count Otto von Brockdorff-Giespert and Kapitan-leutnant von Kloster. The former was rigged out in a uniform that evidently was von Kloster's, judging by the fact that the Count was lightly-built and his borrowed garments fitted him like a sack. His injured arm was in a sling, while, as the result of his immersion and subsequent prolonged stay in the whaler, he had contracted a very bad cold.  Von Kloster, on the other hand, was stout, florid-featured, and well-groomed. He had the typical Prussian \"square head\", the contour of the back of his head and neck forming practically a straight line. His moustache he wore with the points upturned after the fashion set by his Imperial master.  On a camp-stool at the other end of the table sat the unter-leutnant, Kaspar Diehardt, a very young and very bumptious Prussian. His bulging forehead contrasted vividly with his insignificant, receding chin, while his watery blue eyes belied the suggestion that he could ever become an efficient leader of men.  With paper and ink in front of him he sat gnawing the end of his quill pen, as if his thoughts were constantly of the ever-present danger that threatened those who go down into the sea in German submarines.  In his broken English von Kloster demanded Alec's name, rank, the vessel to which he belonged and her approximate position when torpedoed.  \"You may yourself think fortunate that no lies you haf told,\" remarked his interrogator. \"All this information I haf. Now, tell me: for what reason was der _Bolero_ an' oder schips off der Nord Hinder?\"  \"That I cannot tell you,\" replied the Sub.  \"Do you know?\"  \"I refuse to answer this question.\"  The Kapitan-leutnant addressed several words to his subordinate, the latter writing diligently for some moments.  It was an acute period of suspense for Seton. The silence was only broken by the scratching of the temporary secretary's pen, while the Count and von Kloster kept their eyes fixed on the prisoner. Alec was beginning to feel the effects of the salt soup. A burning thirst gripped his throat.  \"Now, you have time had,\" continued his inquisitor. \"Will you answer?\"  Seton shook his head. Even if he wanted to speak his parched tongue seemed unequal to the task. But that was not the reason. At all costs, he determined to refuse to give any information likely to be of service to the enemy.  \"Answer!\" shouted Count Otto von Brockdorff-Giespert, bringing his fist down upon the table and wincing at the effort.  \"Water!\" gasped Alec.  The Kapitan-leutnant gave an order to one of the men. The fellow saluted and went out, presently to return with a carafe full of water, and a glass. Very deliberately von Kloster filled the glass almost to the brim and offered it to the prisoner. Then, as Seton stepped eagerly forward to take the liquid, the Kapitan-leutnant withdrew the glass.  \"After you spoken haf, not before,\" he reminded with tantalizing cunning.  \"I see you to blazes first!\" Alec said hoarsely, with an effort.  \"Ach, goot!\" rejoined von Kloster sneeringly. \"We shall see. I leave der matter in der hands of mine chief.\"  \"Quite so,\" assented Count Otto von Brockdorff-Giespert. \"I may tell you, prisoner, that the information you refuse to give is already at our disposal. How remains our affair? I can tell you this with absolute certainty: either you will remain a prisoner of war until the end of hostilities, or you will not leave this U-boat alive. Rescue is entirely out of the question. Hence it does not matter whether I"]]]
