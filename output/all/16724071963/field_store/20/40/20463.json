There, too, was Mrs. Babington of Dethick, the recent widow of a kinsman of Lord Shrewsbury, to whom had been granted the wardship of her son, and the little party waiting in the hall also numbered Elizabeth and William Cavendish, the Countess's youngest children, and many dependants mustered in the background, ready for the reception. Indeed, the castle and manor-house, with their offices, lodges, and outbuildings, were an absolute little city in themselves.  The castle was still kept in perfect repair, for the battle of Bosworth was not quite beyond the memory of living men's fathers; and besides, who could tell whether any day England might not have to be contested inch by inch with the Spaniard?  So the gray walls stood on the tongue of land in the valley, formed by the junction of the rivers Sheaf and Dun, with towers at all the gateways, enclosing a space of no less than eight acres, and with the actual fortress, crisp, strong, hard, and unmouldered in the midst, its tallest square tower serving as a look-out place for those who watched to give the first intimation of the arrival.  The castle had its population, but chiefly of grooms, warders, and their families.  The state-rooms high up in that square tower were so exceedingly confined, so stern and grim, that the grandfather of the present earl had built a manor-house for his family residence on the sloping ground on the farther side of the Dun.  This house, built of stone, timber, and brick, with two large courts, two gardens, and three yards, covered nearly as much space as the castle itself.  A pleasant, smooth, grass lawn lay in front, and on it converged the avenues of oaks and walnuts, stretching towards the gates of the park, narrowing to the eye into single lines, then going absolutely out of sight, and the sea of foliage presenting the utmost variety of beautiful tints of orange, yellow, brown, and red.  There was a great gateway between two new octagon towers of red brick, with battlements and dressings of stone, and from this porch a staircase led upwards to the great stone-paved hall, with a huge fire burning on the open hearth.  Around it had gathered the ladies of the Talbot family waiting for the reception.  The warder on the tower had blown his horn as a signal that the master and his royal guest were within the park, and the banner of the Talbots had been raised to announce their coming, but nearly half an hour must pass while the party came along the avenue from the drawbridge over the Sheaf ere they could arrive at the lodge.  So the ladies, in full state dresses, hovered over the fire, while the children played in the window seat near at hand.  Gilbert Talbot's wife, a thin, yellow-haired, young creature, promising to be like her mother, the Countess, had a tongue which loved to run, and with the precocity and importance of wifehood at sixteen, she dilated to her companions on her mother's constant attendance on the Queen, and the perpetual plots for that lady's escape.  \"She is as shifty and active as any cat-a-mount; and at Chatsworth she had a scheme for being off out of her bedchamber window to meet a traitor fellow named Boll; but my husband smelt it out in good time, and had the guard beneath my lady's window, and the fellows are in gyves, and to see the lady the day it was found out! Not a wry face did she make. Oh no!  'Twas all my good lord, and my sweet sir with her.  I promise you butter would not melt in her mouth, for my Lord Treasurer Cecil hath been to see her, and he has promised to bring her to speech of her Majesty.  May I be there to see.  I promise you 'twill be diamond cut diamond between them.\"  \"How did she and my Lord Treasurer fare together?\" asked Mrs. Babington.  \"Well, you know there's not a man of them all that is proof against her blandishments.  Her Majesty should have women warders for her. 'Twas good sport to see the furrows in his old brow smoothing out against his will as it were, while she plied him with her tongue. I never saw the Queen herself win such a smile as came on his lips, but then he is always a sort of master, or tutor, as it were, to the Queen.  Ay,\" on some exclamation from Lady Talbot, \"she heeds him like no one else. She may fling out, and run counter to him for the very pleasure of feeling that she has the power, but she will come round at last, and 'tis his will that is done in the long run.  If this lady could beguile him indeed, she might be a free woman in the end.\"  \"And think you that she did?\"  \"Not she!  The Lord Treasurer is too long-headed, and has too strong a hate to all Papistry, to be beguiled more than for the very moment he was before her.  He cannot help the being a man, you see, and they are all alike when once in her presence--your lord and father, like the rest of them, sister Grace.  Mark me if there be not tempests brewing, an we be not the sooner rid of this guest of ours.  My mother is not the woman to bear it long.\"  Dame Mary's tongue was apt to run on too fast, and Lady Talbot interrupted its career with an amused gesture towards the children.  For the little Cis, babe as she was, had all the three boys at her service.  Humfrey, with a paternal air, was holding her on the window-seat; Antony Babington was standing to receive the ball that was being tossed to and fro between them, but as she never caught it, Will Cavendish was content to pick it up every time and return it to her, appearing amply rewarded by her laugh of delight.  The two mothers could not but laugh, and Mrs. Babington said the brave lads were learning their knightly courtesy early, while Mary Talbot began observing on the want of likeness between Cis and either the Talbot or Hardwicke race.  The little girl was much darker in colouring than any of the boys, and had a pair of black, dark, heavy brows, that prevented her from being a pretty child.  Her adopted mother shrank from such observations, and was rejoiced that a winding of horns, and a shout from the boys, announced that the expected arrival was about to take place.  The ladies darted to the window, and beholding the avenue full of horsemen and horsewomen, their accoutrements and those of their escort gleaming in the sun, each mother gathered her own chicks to herself, smoothed the plumage somewhat ruffled by sport, and advanced to the head of the stone steps, William Cavendish, the eldest of the boys, being sent down to take his stepfather's rein and hold his stirrup, page fashion.  Clattering and jingling the troop arrived.  The Earl, a stout, square man, with a long narrow face, lengthened out farther by a light-coloured, silky beard, which fell below his ruff, descended from his steed, gave his hat to Richard Talbot, and handed from her horse a hooded and veiled lady of slender proportions, who leant on his arm as she ascended the steps.  The ladies knelt, whether in respect to the heads of the family, or to the royal guest, may be doubtful.  The Queen came up the stairs with rheumatic steps, declaring, however, as she did so, that she felt the better for her ride, and was less fatigued than when she set forth.  She had the soft, low, sweet Scottish voice, and a thorough Scottish accent and language, tempered, however, by French tones, and as, coming into the warmer air of the hall, she withdrew her veil, her countenance was seen. Mary Stuart was only thirty-one at this time, and her face was still youthful, though worn and wearied, and bearing tokens of illness. The features were far from being regularly beautiful; there was a decided cast in one of the eyes, and in spite of all that Mary Talbot's detracting tongue had said, Susan's first impression was disappointment.  But, as the Queen greeted the lady whom she already knew, and the Earl presented his daughter, Lady Grace, his stepdaughter, Elizabeth Cavendish, and his kinswoman, Mistress Susan Talbot, the extraordinary magic of her eye and lip beamed on them, the queenly grace and dignity joined with a wonderful sweetness impressed them all, and each in measure felt the fascination.  The Earl led the Queen to the fire to obtain a little warmth before mounting the stairs to her own apartments, and likewise while Lady Shrewsbury was dismounting, and being handed up the stairs by her second stepson, Gilbert.  The ladies likewise knelt on one knee to greet this mighty dame, and the children should have done so too, but little Cis, catching sight of Captain Richard, who had come up bearing the Earl's hat, in immediate attendance on him, broke out with an exulting cry of \"Father! father! father!\" trotted with outspread arms right in front of the royal lady, embraced the booted leg in ecstasy, and then stretching out, exclaimed \"Up! up!\"  \"How now, malapert poppet!\" exclaimed the Countess, and though at some distance, uplifted her riding-rod.  Susan was ready to sink into the earth with confusion at the great lady's displeasure, but Richard had stooped and lifted the little maid in his arms, while Queen Mary turned, her face lit up as by a sunbeam, and said, \"Ah, bonnibell, art thou fain to see thy father?  Wilt thou give me one of thy kisses, sweet bairnie?\" and as Richard held her up to the kind face, \"A goodly child, brave sir.  Thou must let me have her at times for a playfellow. Wilt come and comfort a poor prisoner, little sweeting?\"  The child responded with \"Poor poor,\" stroking the soft delicate cheek, but the Countess interfered, still wrathful.  \"Master Richard, I marvel that you should let her Grace be beset by a child, who, if she cannot demean herself decorously, should have been left at home. Susan Hardwicke, I thought I had schooled you better.\"  \"Nay, madam, may not a babe's gentle deed of pity be pardoned?\" said Mary.  \"Oh! if it pleasures you, madam, so be it,\" said Lady Shrewsbury, deferentially; \"but there be children here more worthy of your notice than yonder little black-browed wench, who"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4596"],["title","Unknown to History: A Story of the Captivity of Mary of Scotland (#7)"],["body"," been allowed to thrust herself forward, while others have been kept back from importuning your Grace.\"  \"No child can importune a mother who is cut off from her own,\" said Mary, eager to make up for the jealousy she had excited.  \"Is this bonnie laddie yours, madam?  Ah! I should have known it by the resemblance.\"  She held her white hand to receive the kisses of the boys: William Cavendish, under his mother's eye, knelt obediently; Antony Babington, a fair, pretty lad, of eight or nine, of a beautiful pink and white complexion, pressed forward with an eager devotion which made the Queen smile and press her delicate hand on his curled locks; as for Humfrey, he retreated behind the shelter of his mother's farthingale, where his presence was forgotten by every one else, and, after the rebuff just administered to Cicely, there was no inclination to bring him to light, or combat with his bashfulness.  The introductions over, Mary gave her hand to the Earl to be conducted from the hall up the broad staircase, and along the great western gallery to the south front, where for many days her properties had been in course of being arranged.  Lady Shrewsbury followed as mistress of the house, and behind, in order of precedence, came the Scottish Queen's household, in which the dark, keen features of the French, and the rufous hues of the Scots, were nearly equally divided.  Lady Livingstone and Mistress Seaton, two of the Queen's Maries of the same age with herself, came next, the one led by Lord Talbot, the other by Lord Livingstone. There was also the faithful French Marie de Courcelles, paired with Master Beatoun, comptroller of the household, and Jean Kennedy, a stiff Scotswoman, whose hard outlines did not do justice to her tenderness and fidelity, and with her was a tall, active, keen-faced stripling, looked on with special suspicion by the English, as Willie Douglas, the contriver of the Queen's flight from Lochleven.  Two secretaries, French and Scottish, were shrewdly suspected of being priests, and there were besides, a physician, surgeon, apothecary, with perfumers, cooks, pantlers, scullions, lacqueys, to the number of thirty, besides their wives and attendants, these last being \"permitted of my lord's benevolence.\"  They were all eyed askance by the sturdy, north country English, who naturally hated all strangers, above all French and Scotch, and viewed the band of captives much like a caged herd of wild beasts.  When on the way home Mistress Susan asked her little boy why he would not make his obeisance to the pretty lady, he sturdily answered, \"She is no pretty lady of mine.  She is an evil woman who slew her husband.\"  \"Poor lady! tongues have been busy with her,\" said his father.  \"How, sir?\" asked Susan, amazed, \"do you think her guiltless in the matter?\"  \"I cannot tell,\" returned Richard.  \"All I know is that many who have no mercy on her would change their minds if they beheld her patient and kindly demeanour to all.\"  This was a sort of shock to Susan, as it seemed to her to prove the truth of little Lady Talbot's words, that no one was proof against Queen Mary's wiles; but she was happy in having her husband at home once more, though, as he told her, he would be occupied most of each alternate day at Sheffield, he and another relation having been appointed \"gentlemen porters,\" which meant that they were to wait in a chamber at the foot of the stairs, and keep watch over whatever went in or out of the apartments of the captive and her suite.  \"And,\" said Richard, \"who think you came to see me at Wingfield? None other than Cuthbert Langston.\"  \"Hath he left his merchandise at Hull?\"  \"Ay, so he saith.  He would fain have had my good word to my lord for a post in the household, as comptroller of accounts, clerk, or the like. It seemed as though there were no office he would not take so that he might hang about the neighbourhood of this queen.\"  \"Then you would not grant him your recommendation?\"  \"Nay, truly.  I could not answer for him, and his very anxiety made me the more bent on not bringing him hither.  I'd fain serve in no ship where I know not the honesty of all the crew, and Cuthbert hath ever had a hankering after the old profession.\"  \"Verily then it were not well to bring him hither.\"  \"Moreover, he is a lover of mysteries and schemes,\" said Richard. \"He would never be content to let alone the question of our little wench's birth, and would be fretting us for ever about the matter.\"  \"Did he speak of it?\"  \"Yes.  He would have me to wit that a nurse and babe had been put on board at Dumbarton.  Well, said I, and so they must have been, since on board they were.  Is that all thou hast to tell me?  And mighty as was the work he would have made of it, this was all he seemed to know.  I asked, in my turn, how he came to know thus much about a vessel sailing from a port in arms against the Lords of the Congregation, the allies of her Majesty?\"  \"What said he?\"  \"That his house had dealings with the owners of the Bride of Dunbar. I like not such dealings, and so long as this lady and her train are near us, I would by no means have him whispering here and there that she is a Scottish orphan.\"  \"It would chafe my Lady Countess!\" said Susan, to whom this was a serious matter.  \"Yet doth it not behove us to endeavour to find out her parentage?\"  \"I tell you I proved to myself that he knew nothing, and all that we have to do is to hinder him from making mischief out of that little,\" returned Richard impatiently.  The honest captain could scarcely have told the cause of his distrust or of his secrecy, but he had a general feeling that to let an intriguer like Cuthbert Langston rake up any tale that could be connected with the party of the captive queen, could only lead to danger and trouble.     CHAPTER IV.  THE OAK AND THE OAKEN HALL.   The oaks of Sheffield Park were one of the greatest glories of the place.  Giants of the forest stretched their huge arms over the turf, kept smooth and velvety by the creatures, wild and tame, that browsed on it, and made their covert in the deep glades of fern and copse wood that formed the background.  There were not a few whose huge trunks, of such girth that two men together could not encompass them with outstretched arms, rose to a height of more than sixty feet before throwing out a horizontal branch, and these branches, almost trees in themselves, spread forty-eight feet on each side of the bole, lifting a mountain of rich verdure above them, and casting a delicious shade upon the ground beneath them. Beneath one of these noble trees, some years after the arrival of the hapless Mary Stuart, a party of children were playing, much to the amusement of an audience of which they were utterly unaware, namely, of sundry members of a deer-hunting party; a lady and gentleman who, having become separated from the rest, were standing in the deep bracken, which rose nearly as high as their heads, and were further sheltered by a rock, looking and listening.  \"Now then, Cis, bravely done!  Show how she treats her ladies--\"  \"Who will be her lady?  Thou must, Humfrey!\"  \"No, no, I'll never be a lady,\" said Humfrey gruffly.  \"Thou then, Diccon.\"  \"No, no,\" and the little fellow shrank back, \"thou wilt hurt me, Cis.\"  \"Come then, do thou, Tony!  I'll not strike too hard!\"  \"As if a wench could strike too hard.\"  \"He might have turned that more chivalrously,\" whispered the lady to her companion.  \"What are they about to represent?  Mort de ma vie, the profane little imps!  I, believe it is my sacred cousin, the Majesty of England herself!  Truly the little maid hath a bearing that might serve a queen, though she be all too black and beetle-browed for Queen Elizabeth.  Who is she, Master Gilbert?\"  \"She is Cicely Talbot, daughter to the gentleman porter of your Majesty's lodge.\"  \"See to her--mark her little dignity with her heather and bluebell crown as she sits on the rock, as stately as jewels could make her! See her gesture with her hands, to mark where the standing ruff ought to be.  She hath the true spirit of the Comedy--ah! and here cometh young Antony with mincing pace, with a dock-leaf for a fan, and a mantle for a farthingale!  She speaks! now hark!\"  \"Good morrow to you, my young mistress,\" began a voice pitched two notes higher than its actual childlike key.  \"Thou hast a new farthingale, I see!  O Antony, that's not the way to curtsey--do it like this.  No no! thou clumsy fellow--back and knees together.\"  \"Never mind, Cis,\" interposed one of the boys--\"we shall lose all our play time if you try to make him do it with a grace.  Curtsies are women's work--go on.\"  \"Where was I?  O--\" (resuming her dignity after these asides) \"Thou hast a new farthingale, I see.\"  \"To do my poor honour to your Grace's birthday.\"  \"Oh ho!  Is it so?  Methought it had been to do honour to my fair mistress's own taper waist.  And pray how much an ell was yonder broidered stuff?\"  \"Two crowns, an't please your Grace,\" returned the supposed lady, making a wild conjecture.  \"Two crowns! thou foolish Antony!\"  Then recollecting herself, \"two crowns! what, when mine costs but half!  Thou presumptuous, lavish varlet--no, no, wench! what right hast thou to wear gowns finer than thy liege?--I'll teach you.\"  Wherewith, erecting all her talons, and clawing frightfully with them in the air, the supposed Queen Bess leapt at the unfortunate maid of honour, appeared to tear the imaginary robe, and drove her victim on the stage with a great air of violence, amid peals of laughter from the other children, loud enough to drown those of the elders, who could hardly restrain their merriment.  Gilbert Talbot, however, had been looking about him anxiously all the time, and would fain have moved away; but a sign from Queen Mary withheld him, as one of the children cried,  \"Now! show us how she serves her lords.\"  The play seemed well understood between them, for the mimic queen again settled herself on"]]]
