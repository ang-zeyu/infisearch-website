Little did they suspect that the cruel ambition of their God-man would lead them to a land as barren as the Desert of Sahara, and as devoid of vegetation as the Rock of Gibraltar.  They established themselves in winter-quarters at Kanesville, now Council Bluffs, Iowa. Here new difficulties arose. The church was poor, and means were needed to supply the current necessities, as well as to defray the expense of the journey to their new Zion. Various schemes were resorted to for the purpose of \"raising the wind.\" A band of Danites was sent out to steal cattle and horses, and convey them beyond the jurisdiction of the State authorities. Others were detailed to make and circulate counterfeit money. While these little speculations were progressing, Brigham was trying his hand at diplomacy. He is reported to have sent James C. Little to Washington, to request the privilege of raising a battalion of Mormons for the Mexican war.  This movement was prompted by several considerations. First, it was thought necessary for the safety of the church that they should make a show of patriotism; secondly, these soldiers would draw pay from the government, which Brigham could appropriate; and thirdly, they were to be discharged in Mexico, where, at that time, he designed to found his theocratic monarchy. It has been asserted by some persons that Brigham received $20,000 from the government, as a bonus, for raising the battalion; but I find no evidence to substantiate this assertion. The following affidavit will show in what manner he was benefited by this transaction:--       \"TERRITORY OF UTAH,    }        GREAT SALT LAKE CITY.}       \"Alexander McCord says that he was mustered into the U. S.      service in the Mormon Battalion, August 16th, 1846. That an      advance of $42.50 was issued by the government per man,      ostensibly for the purpose of clothing the command, making a      total to the battalion of $22,500. That this amount was      received by Parley P. Pratt, and forwarded by him to Brigham      Young, who proffered to apply the same for the benefit of the      families of the battalion, who were in a state of destitution.      That he, Brigham, informed them he would send to St Louis,      purchase goods, and deal them out for the benefit of said      families at wholesale prices. Also made a covenant with them,      calling upon God and angels to witness the same. That he would      transport their families to them in Mexico, now California,      even if he had to leave his own family behind; also would      provide houses for them. That in his public address to the      battalion, in relation to this subject, he strongly urged the      advantages that would accrue to his church by their compliance      with this requisition, making it entirely a matter of      self-interest, with the sole view of accomplishing certain      private ends; and not in anywise appealing to their loyalty,      or setting forth the necessity of rendering assistance to the      parent government.       \"That he did not fulfil the promises he had made. Some few      articles were served out to their families at enormous      rates,--his (McCord's) wife having to take sole-leather, for      which she had no use. That when their wives appealed to him,      expecting in good faith to receive according to promise, he      laughed, mimicked, and made fun of them on the public stand;      showing how they cried and whined. On the arrival of the money      at Council Bluffs, some of the women, being entirely      destitute, desired their husbands' share, and some cried for      the want of it. Young ridiculed them, and told them if they      insisted upon having the money, they must not look to him for      support or protection; thus compelling them to accept of his      terms.       \"Two agents, John D. Lee and Major Egan, followed the      battalion to Santa Fe, and there received a draft on      Leavenworth, for the first month and a half's pay, with the      understanding from the soldiers it was to be paid to their      families. The authorities of the church drew the amount, and      then took out the tithing for themselves, one tenth.       \"One of the inducements held out by the government, was to      discharge them, with their arms in Mexico, which was done.      When he (McCord) arrived in Utah, October, 1847, he found his      family not here, and was prevented by the church authorities      from going after them; and was not permitted to leave until      January following. When he reached his family at Winter      Quarters, Missouri, he found no preparations made for their      being forwarded to Utah, and there were none made afterwards.

(Signed,) ALEXANDER MCCORD.\"       \"Subscribed and sworn to before me, this 4th day of May, 1864.       \"THOMAS J. DRAKE,       \"_Associate Justice U. S. Sup. Court, Utah_.\"  By this operation, Brigham must have realized the neat little sum of $10,000. This enabled him to fit out an expedition to explore the country west of the Rocky Mountains. Accordingly, in the spring of 1847, with one hundred and forty-three of his tried adherents, he made the journey to Salt Lake, where they arrived July 24, 1847. A colony was at once established, and a part of the number left to commence farming operations. Brigham, with the remainder, returned to \"Winter Quarters.\" Here he found the people on the point of starvation, while fevers and the cholera were rapidly thinning their ranks. Brigham at once commenced alleviating their suffering, and in the excess of their gratitude, these poor deluded creatures did not see that he was the cause of all their misery.  Young was now ready to enact another scene in this Mormon drama. He was ruling the church in the capacity of President of the Twelve Apostles. He desired greater power; he wished to occupy the place of the Prophet of the Lord. This was the more difficult, as the people venerated the memory of Joseph Smith, sanctified as it was by the remembrance of his cruel and untimely death. Brigham knew well the extent of this feeling, and that it would be impossible to supplant Joseph in their affections, and extremely difficult to occupy his position. But his plans demanded that he should be in form what he was in fact,--the absolute head of the church. He resolved to execute a brilliant _coup d'état_, and risk the consequences.  On the morning of the 24th of December, 1847, he ascended the pulpit to preach; and with that power of mimicry and imitation for which he is so remarkable, aided, doubtless, by works of art to enable him to represent the features and _personnel_ of Smith, he so completely assumed the tone and manner, and presented the appearance of Joseph, that the congregation believed that their dead prophet stood before them. The effect was electrical. Women screamed and fainted; strong men wept; the delusion was complete. \"_The mantle of Joseph had fallen upon Brigham_;\" he was henceforth their Prophet, Seer, and Revelator, the rightful successor to the Presidency. One old brother told me that he really believed that Joseph was present in the flesh, so strong was the personal resemblance at the time. As soon as the tumult subsided, the people elected Brigham \"President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in all the world.\" He appointed Heber C. Kimball and Willard Richards as his counsellors. These three constituted the \"First Presidency.\" This action was subsequently confirmed, at a conference held April 6, 1848, at the same place. Brigham was now the nominal as well as the real leader of this strange community.  A greater trial demanded his forethought. The whole church was to be removed over a thousand miles, through an almost unknown country, full of dangers and difficulties.  The following account of the manner in which this difficult undertaking was executed, is from the pen of John Hyde, Jr.:--       \"Some ability is required to efficiently remove bodies of      armed troops over such new and pioneering obstacles: well      supplied, equipped, and mounted, it takes a commander's skill;      but here were poor, unprovided, feeble men, women, and      children, shaking with ague, pale with suffering, hollow and      gaunt with recent hunger. Without strife, without discord,      almost without a murmur, this heterogeneous mass moved off.      Many groaned with anguish, but none with complaint. Brigham's      energy inspired them all; his genius controlled them all.      Marking their road with their gravestones, they arrived at      Salt Lake Valley, destitute and feeble, in 1848. The desert to      which they had come was as cheerless as their past history.      From cruel foes they had fled to as unfeeling a wilderness.      Renewed difficulties demanded a renewed effort from Brigham.      Everything depended on him. Starvation and nakedness stared in      the gloomy faces of the desponding people. Murmurs and      complaints were uttered. He quelled everything; scolded,      plead, threatened, prophesied, and subdued them. With a      restless but resistless energy he set them to work, and worked      himself as their example. He directed their labors,      controlled their domestic affairs, preached at them, to them,      for them. He told foolish anecdotes to make them laugh,      encouraged their dancing to make them merry, got up theatrical      performances to distract their minds, and made them work hard,      certain of rendering them contented by-and-by. Feared with a      stronger fear, venerated with "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/44414"],["title","The Mormon Prophet and His Harem (#3)"],["body","more rational veneration, but      not loved with the same clinging tenderness that the people      still felt for Joseph Smith, Brigham swayed them at his will.      They learned to dread his iron hand, and were daunted by his      iron heart.\"[10:A]  While he was thus consolidating his power, laying plans for the foundation of a monarchy more despotic than that of Austria, important changes were going on in the political condition of the country. Mexico was conquered, and much of its territory, including Utah, was annexed to the United States, and the Mormons thus again brought within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government.  From this era in Mormon affairs Brigham appears in so many different characters that his history can only be fully written by considering him in his various _rôles_,--as \"Governor of Utah and Superintendent of Indian Affairs;\" \"President of the Church, Prophet, Seer, and Revelator;\" \"Trustee in Trust for the Church;\" \"President of the Emigration Company;\" \"Lord of the Harem;\" \"Eloheim, or Head God;\" and \"Grand Archee of the Order of the Gods.\"   FOOTNOTES:  [10:A] _Mormonism; its Leaders and Designs_, by John Hyde, Jr. New York: W. P. Fetridge & Co. 1857. Page 144.     CHAPTER II.  POLITICAL.       Brigham as Governor of Utah and Superintendent of Indian      Affairs.--Formation of the State of Deseret.--Proceedings of      the Utah Legislature.--Brigham's Proclamations.--Difficulties      with the Federal Officers.--Proceedings of the first Judges.   By the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, concluded between the United States and Mexico in 1848, the country now embraced in the Territory of Utah was transferred from the jurisdiction of the latter to that of the former, and on the 9th of September, 1850, Congress passed an Act to organize the Territory of Utah.  The Mormons arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on the 24th of July, 1847, while the Territory yet belonged to Mexico. When the peace between the United States and Mexico was concluded, the Mormons were left without a government. They took advantage of this opportunity to set up an independent government.  Early in 1849 they met in convention to frame a constitution for \"the State of Deseret.\" The following is an abstract of the minutes of that convention:--  On the 15th of March, 1849, the convention appointed the following persons a committee to draft a constitution for the State of Deseret, to wit: Albert Carrington, Joseph L. Heywood, William W. Phelps, David Fullmer, John S. Fullmer, Charles C. Rich, John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt, John M. Bernheisel, and Erastus Snow.  March 18, 1849, Albert Carrington, chairman of the committee, reported the following constitution, which was read, and unanimously adopted by the convention: [The preamble only is here given.]        \"CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF DESERET.       \"Whereas a large number of the citizens of the United States,      before and since the treaty of peace with the Republic of      Mexico, emigrated to and settled in that portion of the      territory of the United States lying west of the Rocky      Mountains, and in the great interior basin of Upper      California; and whereas, by reason of said treaty, all civil      organization originating from the Republic of Mexico became      abrogated; and whereas the Congress of the United States has      failed to provide a form of civil government for the territory      so acquired, or any portion thereof; and whereas civil      government and law are necessary for the security, peace, and      prosperity of society; and whereas it is a fundamental      principle in all republican governments that all political      power is inherent in the people, and governments instituted      for their protection, security, and benefit, should emanate      from the same:       \"Therefore your committee beg leave to recommend the adoption      of the following _Constitution_, until the Congress of the      United States shall otherwise provide for the government of      the Territory hereinafter named and described, by admitting us      into the Union.       \"We, the people, grateful to the Supreme Being for the      blessings hitherto enjoyed, and feeling our dependence on Him      for a continuance of those blessings, _do ordain and establish      a free and Independent Government_, by the name of _the State      of Deseret_; including all the territory of the United States      within the following boundaries, to wit:\" [Here follow the      boundaries of the proposed new State.]  It will be noticed by the phraseology of the foregoing preamble that this government was to be \"free and independent,\" and was intended to remain such until the new State, thus constituted, _should be admitted into the Union_. In other words, they intended, through the machinery of this independent State, to harass and annoy the government, and the gentiles, until the \"saints\" could force themselves into the Union upon their own terms. This theory is fully sustained by the subsequent history of this inchoate State. The very first steps taken were independent of, and in hostility to, the officers appointed by the Government of the United States, as will more fully appear in the following pages.  The formation of this government for the State of Deseret was the first effort to throw off the yoke of the Federal Government,--an effort which has been persistently persevered in to the present time.  There never has been a time since Brigham Young crossed the Rocky Mountains, when he has honestly entertained the idea of being a good and loyal citizen of the United States.  The following were the first officers of this infant monarchy:--       Governor, BRIGHAM YOUNG.      Lieutenant-Governor, HEBER C. KIMBALL.      Chief Justice, DANIEL H. WELLS.  The Assembly met, and after listening to the Governor's Message, proceeded to frame a code of laws. This _pseudo_ State government remained in force until the 22d of September, 1851, when the Territorial Legislature convened.  In the mean time Brigham, having been appointed Governor of the newly organized Territory, and Superintendent of Indian Affairs, and seeing a fair prospect of lining his pockets from the treasury of the United States, concluded to forego for a time his ambitious projects, and consented that the new \"State\" should be merged into a United States Territory.  The federal officers were appointed during the session of 1850-51, but owing to the difficulty of transportation, did not arrive until July, 1851. Young, who had been appointed Governor, had, on the 3d of February, 1851, taken the oath of office before Wells, _Chief Justice of Deseret_.  The first session of the Territorial Legislature was convened, in pursuance of the proclamation of the Governor, on the 22d day of September, 1851, and continued by adjournment from time to time, until the 18th day of February, 1852. This was succeeded by a special session, called by proclamation of the Governor, commencing the following day, and continuing until the 6th day of March, 1852. What there was in the political condition of this community, subjected as they were, in almost all the relations of life, to a complete and comprehensive system of religious government, to require a continuous session of the Territorial Legislature for nearly six months, has never yet been explained.  The following is extracted from the published proceedings of the first Legislative Assembly:--       \"REPRESENTATIVES' HALL, Tuesday, Sept 23, 1852.       \"10 o'clock, A. M. Both houses of the Legislative Assembly met      in joint session, according to previous arrangement. The      President of the Council in the chair.       \"The committee appointed to that duty appeared, escorting his      Excellency Brigham Young, Governor of Utah Territory, who was      seated immediately in front of the Speaker's chair.       \"The joint committee appointed to wait upon the Judges of the      Supreme Court, and the Secretary of the Territory, appeared,      escorting the Hon. Z. Snow [Mormon], one of said Judges. They      reported that they had visited the Hon. Perry E. Brochus, and      Mr. Secretary Harris. But the answer returned by them was so      vague and indefinite that they did not know whether they would      respond to the invitation or not. The committee also reported      that they did not see the Hon. Judge Brandenburg. The United      States District Attorney, Seth M. Blair, Esq., [Mormon,] was      also seated within the bar.\"  The hostility to the federal officers had already been so openly and offensively manifested, that the respect which these gentlemen owed to themselves and the government and people whom they represented, would not permit them to be present at the first meeting of the Legislative Assembly. It will be noticed that one of them was not seen at all, and the reply of the other two was not even reported!       \"The House was called to order by the President of the      Council, who then informed his Excellency the Governor, that      the two Houses were now ready to receive any communication he      might be pleased to make.\"  The Governor then presented his Message, as follows:--       \"_Fellow-citizens of the Council and House of Representatives      of Utah Territory_:--       \"Having called you from your various avocations to convene in      general assembly at an earlier day, and upon shorter notice      than may appear desirable, I will proceed without delay to lay      before you the chief reason for so doing, as well as such      other suggestions as to me shall appear necessary and proper,      and as shall occur to my mind.\" . . .       \"Through the munificence of the General Government, we have      extended unto us increased facilities for spending our time      for the public weal; for, however much the honest pride of      gratuitous public service may flatter its humble recipient,      yet whilst it impoverishes all but his honorable name and his   "]]]
