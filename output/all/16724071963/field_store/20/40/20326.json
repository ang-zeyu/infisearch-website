[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4513"],["title","The Rainbow and the Rose (#2)"],["body","earth Paradise,   These magic songs of day and night--    I know them for the things they are:   A passing pain, a longing fleet,   A shape that soon I shall not meet,   A fading dream of veil and star.    Yet, even as my lips proclaim   The wisdom that the years have lent,   Your absence is joy's banishment,   And life's one music is your name.    I love you to my heart's hid core:   Those other loves? how should one learn   From marshlights how the great fires burn?   Ah, no! I never loved before!     SONG.    THE sunshine of your presence lies   On the glad garden of my heart   And bids the leaves of silence part   To show the flowers to your dear eyes,   And flower on flower blooms there and dies   And still new buds awakened spring,   For sunshine makes the garden wise,   To know the time for blossoming.    Night is no time for blossoming,   Your garden then dreams otherwise,   Of vanished Summer, vanished Spring,   And how the dearest flower first dies.   Yet from your ministering eyes   Though night hath drawn me far apart   On the still garden of my heart   The moonlight of your memory lies.     TO VERA, WHO ASKED A SONG.    IF I only had time!   I could make you a rhyme.   But my time is kept flying   By smiling and sighing   And living and dying for you.   The song-seed, I sow it,   I water and hoe it,   But never can grow it.   Ah, traitress, you know it!   What is a poor poet to do?    Ah, let me take breath!   I am harried to death   By the loves and the graces   That crowd where your face is   That lurk in your laces and throng.   Call them off for a minute,   Once let me begin it   The devil is in it   If I can not spin it   As sweet as a linnet, your song!     THE POET TO HIS LOVE.    ALL the flight of thoughts here, shy, bold, scared, intrusive,   Fluttering in the sun, between the green and blue,   Wheeling, whirling, poising, lovely and elusive,   How to cage the flying thoughts, my winged delight, for you?    Set a springe of rhyme, and hope to catch them in it?   Strew my love as grain to lure them to the snare?   Watch the hours built up, slow minute piled on minute?   Still the wide sky guards their flight, and still the cage is bare.    Gleam of hovering feathers, brushing me to flout me!   Wings, be weary! Rest! Who loves you more than I?   Caught? Oh fluttering pinions whitening air about me!   Rustling wings, and distant flight, and empty cage and sky!     THE MAIDEN'S PRAYER.    SPRING, pretty Spring, what treasure do you bring to me?   Green grass and buttercups, cherry-bloom and may?   Sunshine to be glad with me, and little birds to sing to me?   Warm nests to call me along the woodland way?    Spring, happy Spring, what wonder will you do for me?   Light the tulip lanterns, and set the furze a-fire?   Fill your sky with sails of cloud on waves of living blue for me?   Show me green cornfields and budding of the briar?    Spring, darling Spring, my days will not return to me,   You who see them fleeting, you, all time above,   You who move the whole world's heart, ah move one heart to turn to me,   --Bring me a lover, and teach me how to love!     SONG.    \"LOVE me little, love me long,\"   Is the burden of my song,   And if nothing more may be   Little shall suffice for me.    But if you could crown with flowers   All my radiant, festal hours,   And console for hours of sorrow   Love me more with each to-morrow.    And if you would turn my days   To one splendid hymn of praise,   And set hopes like stars above me   Love me much, and always love me!     THE MAGIC FLOWER.    THROUGH many days and many days   The seed of love lay hidden close;   We walked the dusty tiresome ways   Where never a leaf or blossom grows.   And in the darkness, all the while,   The little seed its heart uncurled,   And we by many a weary mile   Travelled towards it, round the world.    To the hid centre of the maze   At last we came, and there we found--   O happy day, O day of days!   --Twin seed-leaves breaking holy ground.   We dropped life's joys, a garnered sheaf,   And spell-bound watched, still hour by hour,   Magic on magic, leaf by leaf,   The unfolding of our love's white flower.     LA DERNIERE ROBE DE SOI.    OH, silken gown, all pink and pretty,   Bought, quite a bargain, in the City,   Your ill-trained soul full false has played me--   No Paris gown would have betrayed me.    You knew, my pretty silken treasure,   I must not wed for love or pleasure,   But for a settlement and title;   Yet you encouraged his recital!    He said--oh, faithless gown, you listened   While on your sheen two tear drops glistened--   He said . . . let love to music set it,   I'll never speak it--nor forget it!    \"No, no!\" I cried, I tried to save you--   False gown, you showed the tears I gave you!   You looked discreet when first I found you.   How could you let his arm go round you?    You darling dress--I'll smooth your creases,   I'll wear you till you drop to pieces;   But poor men's wives wear cotton only--   Dear gown--I hope you won't feel lonely!     THE LEAST POSSIBLE.    DEAR goddess of the shining shrine   Where all my votive tapers burn,   Where every gold-embroidered thought   And all my flowers of life are brought   --With many, alas! that are not mine--   What will you give me in return?    The bow in Bond Street--in the Park   The smile all worship on your lips,   The courteous word at dinner--dance--   But never a blush--a conscious glance;   At most, at Henley, in the dark,   Your fleet mistaken finger-tips?    Ah, just for once, once only, be   An altar-server--stoop and set me   Upon the altar richly wrought   Of your most secret flower-sweet thought:   One nightlight's flicker burn for me   Before you sleep and quite forget me.     EN TOUT CAS.    WHEN I am glad I need your eyes   To be the stars of Paradise;   Your lips to be the seal of all   The joy life grants, and dreams recall;   Your hand, to lie my hands between   What time we walk the garden green.    But most in grief I need your face   To lean to mine in the desert place;   Your lips to mock the evil years,   To sweeten me my cup of tears,   Your eyes to shine, in cloud's despite,   Your hands to hold mine through the night.     APPEAL.    Daphnis dearest, wherefore weave me   Webs of lies lest truth should grieve me?   I could pardon much, believe me:   Dower me, Daphnis, or bereave me,   Kill me, kill me, love me, leave me--   Damn me, dear, but don't deceive me!     ST. VALENTINE'S DAY.    THE South is a dream of flowers   With a jewel for sky and sea,   Rose-crowns for the dancing hours,   Gold fruits upon every tree;   But cold from the North   The wind blows forth   That blows my love to me.    The stars in the South are gold   Like lamps between sky and sea;   The flowers that the forests hold   Like stars between tree and tree;   But little and white   Is the pale moon's light   That lights my love to me.    In the South the orange grove   Makes dusk by the dusky sea,   White palaces wrought for love   Gleam white between tree and tree,   But under bare boughs   Is the little house   Warm-lit for my love and me.     CHAGRIN D'AMOUR.    IF Love and I were all alone   I might forget to grieve,   And for his pleasure and my own   Might happier garlands weave;   But you sit there, and watch us wear   The mourning wreaths you wove:   And while such mocking eyes you bear   I am not friends with Love.    Withdraw those cruel eyes, and let   Me search the garden through   That I may weave, ere Love be set,   The wreath of Love for you;   Till you, whom Love so well adorns,   Its hidden thorns discover,   And know at last what crown of thorns   It was you gave your lover.     BRIDAL EVE.    GOOD-NIGHT, my Heart, my Heart, good-night--   Oh, good and dear and fair,   With lips of life and eyes of light   And roses in your hair.    To-morrow brings the other crown,   The orange blossoms, Sweet,   And then the rose will be cast down   With lilies at your feet.    But in your soul a garden stands   Where fair the white rose blows--   God, teach my foolish clumsy hands   The way to tend my rose.    That in the white-rose garden still   The lily may bloom fair   God help my heart and soul and will   To keep the lily there.     LOVE AND LIFE.    LOVE only sings when Love is young,   When Love is young and still at play,   How shall we count the sweet songs sung   When Love and Joy kept holiday?   But now Love has to earn his bread   By lifelong stress and toil of tears,   He finds his nest of song-birds dead   That sang so sweet in other years.    For Love's a man now, strong and brave,   To fight for you, for you to live,   And Love, that once such bright songs gave,   Has better things than songs to give;   He gives you now a lifelong faith,   A hand to help in joy or pain,   And he will sing no more, till Death   Shall come to make him young again!     FROM THE ITALIAN.    AS a little child whom his mother has chidden,   Wrecked in the dark in a storm of weeping,   Sleeps with his tear-stained eyes closed hidden   And, with fists clenched, sobs still in his sleeping,    So in my breast sleeps Love, O white lady,   What does he care though the rest are playing,   With rattles and drums in the woodlands shady,   Happy children, whom Joy takes maying!    Ah, do not wake him, lest you should hear him   Scolding the others, breaking their rattles,   Smashing their drums, when their play comes near him--   Love who, for me, is a god of battles!       IV.     \"OUT OF THE FULNESS OF THE HEART THE MOUTH SPEAKETH.\"    In answer to those who have said that English Poets   give no personal love to their country.    ENGLAND, my country, austere in the clamorous council of nations,   Set in the seat of the mighty, wielding the sword of the strong,   Have we but sung of your glory, firm in eternal foundations?   Are not your woods and your meadows the core of our heart and our song?   O dear fields of my country, grass growing green, glowing"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4513"],["title","The Rainbow and the Rose (#3)"],["body","olden,   Green in the patience of winter, gold in the pageant of spring,   Oaks and young larches awaking, wind-flowers and violets blowing,   What, if God sets us to singing, what save you shall we sing?   Who but our England is fair through the veil of her poets' praises,   What but the pastoral face, the fruitful, beautiful breast?   Are not your poets' meadows starred with the English daisies?   Were not the wings of their song-birds fledged in an English nest?   Songs of the leaves in the sunlight, songs of the fern-brake in shadow,   Songs of the world of the woods and songs of the marsh and the mere,   Are they not English woods, dear English marshland and meadow?   Have not your poets loved you? England, are you not dear?    Shoulders of upland brown laid dark to the sunset's bosom,   Living amber of wheat, and copper of new-ploughed loam,   Downs where the white sheep wander, little gardens in blossom,   Roads that wind through the twilight up to the lights of home.   Lanes that are white with hawthorn, dykes where the sedges shiver,   Hollows where caged winds slumber, moorlands where winds wake free,   Sowing and reaping and gleaning, spring and torrent and river,   Are they not more, by worlds, than the whole of the world can be?    Is there a corner of land, a furze-fringed rag of a by-way,   Coign of your foam-white cliffs or swirl of your grass-green waves,   Leaf of your peaceful copse, or dust of your strenuous highway,   But in our hearts is sacred, dear as our cradles, our graves?   Is not each bough in your orchards, each cloud in the skies above you,   Is not each byre or homestead, furrow or farm or fold,   Dear as the last dear drops of the blood in the hearts that love you,   Filling those hearts till the love is more than the heart can hold?   Therefore the song breaks forth from the depths of the hidden fountain   Singing your least frail flower, your raiment of seas and skies,   Singing your pasture and cornfield, fen and valley and mountain,   England, desire of my heart, England, delight of mine eyes!   Take my song too, my country: many a son and debtor   Pays you in praise and homage out of your gifts' full store;   Life of my life, my England, many will praise you better,   None, by the God that made you, ever can love you more!     SUMMER SONG.    THERE are white moon daisies in the mist of the meadow   Where the flowered grass scatters its seeds like spray,   There are purple orchis by the wood-ways' shadow,   There are pale dog-roses by the white highway;   And the grass, the grass is tall, the grass is up for hay,   With daisies white like silver and buttercups like gold,   And it's oh! for once to play thro' the long, the lovely day,   To laugh before the year grows old!    There is silver moonlight on the breast of the river   Where the willows tremble to the kiss of night,   Where the nine tall aspens in the meadow shiver,   Shiver in the night wind that turns them white.   And the lamps, the lamps are lit, the lamps are glow-worms light,   Between the silver aspens and the west's last gold.   And it's oh! to drink delight in the lovely lonely night,   To be young before the heart grows old!     THE LOWER ROOM.    How soft the lamplight falls   On pictures, books,   And pleasant coloured walls   And curtains drawn!   How happily one looks   On glowing flame and ember;   Ah, why should one remember   Dew and dawn!    Here age and wisdom sit   Calm and discreet,   Life and the fruit of it   Are here in truth,   Whose gathering once was sweet--   Wisdom and age! Well met!   Yet neither can forget   Folly and youth!     SONG.    THE summer down the garden walks   Swept in her garments bright;   She touched the pale still lily stalks   And crowned them with delight;   She breathed upon the rose's head   And filled its heart with fire,   And with a golden carpet spread   The path of my desire.    The larkspurs stood like sentinels   To greet her as she came,   Soft rang the Canterbury bells   The music of her name.   She passed across the happy land   Where all dear dreams flower free;   She took my true love by the hand   And led her out to me.     MAY SONG.    BIRDS in the green of my garden   Blackbirds and throstle and wren,   Wet your dear wings in the tears that are Spring's   And so to your singing again!   Birds in my blossoming orchard,   Chaffinch and goldfinch and lark,   Preen your bright wings, little happy live things;   The May trees grow white in the park!    Birds in the leafy wet woodlands,   Cuckoo and nightingale brown,   Sing to the sound of the rain on green ground--   The rain on green leaves dripping down!   Fresh with the rain of the May-time,   Rich with the promise of June,   Deep in her heart, where the little leaves part,   Love, like a bird, sings in tune!       V.     TO IRIS.    IF I might build a palace, fair   With every joy of soul and sense,   And set my heart as sentry there   To guard your happy innocence--   If I might plant a hedge so strong   No creeping sorrow could writhe through,   And find my whole life not too long   To give, to make your hedge for you--    If I could teach the wandering air   To bring no sounds that were not sweet,   Could teach the earth that only fair   Untrodden flower deserved your feet:   Would I not tear the secret scroll   Where all your griefs lie closely curled,   And give your little hand control   Of all the joys of all the world?    But ah! I have no skill to raise   The palace, teach the hedge to grow;   The common airs blow through your days,   By common ways your dear feet go.   And you must twine of common flowers   The wreath that happy women wear,   And bear in desolate darkened hours   The common griefs that all men bear.    The pinions of my love I fold   Your little shoulders close about:   Ah--could my love keep out the cold   And shut the creeping sorrows out!   Rough paths will tire your darling feet,   Gray skies will weep your tears above,   While round you still, in torment, beat   The impotent wings of mother-love.     TO A CHILD.   (Rosamund.)    The fairies have been busy while you slept;   They have been laughing where the sad rain wept,   They have taught Beauty to the ignorant flowers,   Set tasks of hope to weary wind-torn bowers,   And heard the lessons learned in school-rooms cold   By seedling snapdragon and marigold.   At dawn, while still you slept, I grew aware   How good the fairies are, how many and fair.    The fairy whose delightful gown is red   Across a corner of our garden sped,   And, where her flying raiment fluttered past,   Its roseate reflection still is cast:   Red poppies by the rhododendron's side,   Paeonies gorgeous in their summer pride,   And red may-bushes by the old red wall   Shower down their crimson petals over all.    Then she whose gown is gold, and gold her hair,   Swept down the golden steep straight sunbeam-stair,   She lit the tulip-lamps, she lit the torch   Of hollyhock beside the cottage porch.   She dressed the honeysuckle in fringe of gold,   She gave the king-cups fairy wealth to hold,   She kissed St. John's wort till it opened wide,   She set the yarrow by the river side.    Then came the lady all whose robes are white:   She made the pale buds blossom in delight,   Set silver stars upon the jasmine's hair,   And gave the stream white lily-buds to wear.   She painted lilies white, and pearl-white phlox,   White poppies, passion-flowers and gray-leaved stocks.   Her pure kind touch redeemed the most forlorn,   And even the vile petunia smiled, new-born.    The dearest fairy of all--green is her gown--   She kissed the plane-trees in the tiresome town,   She smoothed the pastures and the lawn's pale sheen,   She decked the boughs with hangings fresh and green,   She showed each flower the one and only way   Its beauty of shape and colour to display;   She taught the world to be a Paradise   Of changing leaf and blade, for tired eyes.    Then, one and all, they came where you were laid   In your strait bed, my little lovely maid;   The red-robed fairy kissed your lips, your face,   The white-robed made your heart her dwelling-place.   Into your eyes the green robed fairy smiled;   The golden fairy touched your dreams, my child,   And one, not named, but mightiest, made my Dear   The innermost rose of the re-flowered year.   May, 1898.     BIRTHDAY TALK FOR A CHILD.   (IRIS.)    DADDY dear, I'm only four   And I'd rather not be more:   Four's the nicest age to be--   Two and two, or one and three.    All I love is two and two,   Mother, Fabian, Paul and you;   All you love is one and three,   Mother, Fabian, Paul and me.    Give your little girl a kiss   Because she learned and told you this.     TO ROSAMUND.    AND it is fair and very fair   This maze of blossom and sweet air,   This drift of orchard snows,   This royal promise of the rose   Wherein your young eyes see   Such buds of scented joys to be.   A gay green garden, softly fanned   By the blythe breeze that blows   To speed your ship of dreams to the enchanted land.    But I--beyond the budding screen   Of green and red and white and green,   Behind the radiant show   Of things that cling and grow and glow   I see the plains where lie   The hopes of days gone by:   Gray breadths of melancholy, crossed   By winds that coldly blow   From that cold sea wherein my argosy is lost.     FROM THE TUSCAN.    WHEN in the west the red sun sank in glory,   The cypress trees stood up like gold, fine gold;   The mother told her little child the story   Of the gold trees the heavenly gardens hold.    In golden dreams the child sees golden rivers,   Gold trees, gold blossoms, golden boughs and leaves,   Without, the cypress in the night wind shivers,   Weeps with the rain and with the darkness grieves.     MOTHER SONG.    _From the Portuguese._    HEAVY my heart is, heavy to carry,   Full of soft foldings, of downy enwrapments--   And the outer fold of all is love,   And the next soft fold is"]]]
