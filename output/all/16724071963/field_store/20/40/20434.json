(The soldiers and students, laughing, separate the women.        All the groups depart.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE II.    WAGNER, SIEBEL, VALENTINE, Students, and afterwards MEPHISTOPHELES.  _Val._    (advancing from the back of the stage and holding in his hand   a small silver medal).          O sacred medallion,            Gift of my sister dear            To ward off danger and fear,          As I charge with my brave battalion,            Rest thou upon my heart.  _Wag._   Here comes Valentine, in search of us, doubtless.  _Val._   Let us drain the parting cup, comrades,          It is time we were on the road.  _Wag._   What sayst thou?          Why this sorrowful farewell?  _Val._   Like you, I soon must quit these scenes,          Leaving behind me Marguerite.          Alas! my mother no longer lives,          To care for and protect her.  _Sie._   More than one friend hast thou          Who faithfully will thy place supply.  _Val._   My thanks!  _Sie._   On me you may rely.  _Stud._  In us thou surely mayst confide.  _Val._   Even bravest heart may swell          In the moment of farewell.          Loving smile of sister kind,          Quiet home I leave behind.          Oft shall I think of you          Whene'er the wine-cup passes round,          When alone my watch I keep.          But when danger to glory shall call me,          I still will be first in the fray,          As blithe as a knight in his bridal array.          Careless what fate shall befall me          When glory shall call me.  _Wag._   Come on, friends! No tears nor vain alarms;          Quaff we good wine, to the success of our arms!          Drink, boys, drink!          In a joyous refrain          Bid farewell, till we meet again.  _Cho._   We'll drink! Fill high!          Once more in song our voices          Let us raise.  _Wag._              (mounting on a table).          A rat, more coward than brave,            And with an exceedingly ugly head,          Lodged in a sort of hole or cave,            Under an ancient hogshead.            A cat--              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE III.  MEPHISTOPHELES and the preceding.  _Mep._  (appearing suddenly among the students and interrupting WAGNER).          Good sir!  _Wag._   What!  _Mep._   If it so please ye I should wish          To mingle with ye a short time.          If your good friend will kindly end his song,          I'll tell ye a few things well worth the hearing.  _Wag._   One will suffice, but let that one be good.  _Mep._   My utmost I will do          Your worships not to bore.                          I.          Calf of Gold! aye in all the world          To your mightiness they proffer,          Incense at your fane they offer          From end to end of all the world.          And in honor of the idol          Kings and peoples everywhere          To the sound of jingling coins          Dance with zeal in festive circle,          Round about the pedestal.          Satan, he conducts the ball.                          II.          Calf of Gold, strongest god below!          To his temple overflowing          Crowds before his vile shape bowing,          The monster dares insult the skies.          With contempt he views around him          All the vaunted human race,          As they strive in abject toil,          As with souls debased they circle          Round about the pedestal.          Satan, he conducts the ball.  _All._   Satan, he conducts the ball.  _Cho._   A strange story this of thine.  _Val._                  (aside).          And stranger still is he who sings it.  _Wag._           (offering a cup to MEPHISTOPHELES).          Will you honor us by partaking of wine?  _Mep._   With pleasure. Ah!       (Taking WAGNER by the hand, and scrutinizing his palm.)          Behold what saddens me to view.          See you this line?  _Wag._   Well!  _Mep._   A sudden death it presages,--          You will be killed in mounting to th' assault!  _Sie._   You are then a sorcerer!  _Mep._   Even so. And your own hand shows plainly          To what fate condemns. What flower you would gather          Shall wither in the grasp.  _Sie._   I?  _Mep._   No more bouquets for Marguerite.  _Val._   My sister! How knew you her name?  _Mep._   Take care, my brave fellow!          Some one I know is destined to kill you.                  (Taking the cup.)          Your health, gentlemen!          Pah! What miserable wine!          Allow me to offer you some from my cellar?         (Jumps on the table, and strikes on a little cask,          surmounted by the effigy of the god Bacchus,          which serves as a sign to the Inn.)           What ho! thou god of wine, now give us drink!           (Wine gushes forth from cask, and            MEPHISTOPHELES fills his goblet.)          Approach, my friends!          Each one shall be served to his liking.          To your health, now and hereafter!          To Marguerite!  _Val._   Enough! If I do not silence him,          And that instantly, I will die.              (The wine bursts into flame.)  _Wag._   Hola!  _Cho._   Hola!              (They draw their swords.) _Mep._   Ah, ha! Why do you tremble so, you who menace me?         (He draws a circle around him with his sword.            VALENTINE attacks; his sword is broken.)  _Val._   My sword, O amazement!          Is broken asunder.  _All_     (forcing MEPHISTOPHELES to retire by holding toward him the        cross-shaped handles of their swords).           Gainst the powers of evil our arms assailing,          Strongest earthly might is unavailing.          But thou canst not charm us,          Look hither!          While this blest sign we wear          Thou canst not harm us.                     (Exeunt.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE IV.  MEPHISTOPHELES, then FAUST.  _Mep._                 (replacing his sword).          We'll meet anon, good sirs,--adieu!  _Faust_                    (enters).          Why, what has happened?  _Mep._   Oh, nothing! let us change the subject!          Say, Doctor, what would you of me?          With what shall we begin?  _Faust._ Where bides the beauteous maid          Thine art did show to me?          Or was't mere witchcraft?  _Mep._   No, but her virtue doth protect her from thee,          And heaven itself would keep her pure.  _Faust._ It matters not!          Come, lead me to her,          Or I straightway abandon thee.  _Mep._   Then I'll comply! 'twere pity you should think          So meanly of the magic power which I possess.          Have patience! and to this joyous tune.          Right sure am I, the maiden will appear.              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE V.      (Students, with Maidens on their arms, preceded by Musicians,   take possession of the stage. Burghers in the rear,   as at the commencement of the act.)    Students, Maidens, Burghers, etc., afterwards SIEBEL and MARGUERITE.  _Cho._              (marking waltz time with their feet).          As the wind that sportively plays,          At first will light dust only raise,          Yet, at last, becomes a gale,          So our dancing and our singing,          Soft at first, then loudly ringing,          Will resound o'er hill and dale.     (The Musicians mount upon the table, and dancing begins.)  _Mep._                 (to FAUST).          See those lovely young maidens.          Will you not ask of them          To accept you?  _Faust._ No! desist from thy idle sport,          And leave my heart free to reflection.  _Sie._                     (entering).          Marguerite this way alone can arrive.  _Some of the Maidens_                (approaching SIEBEL).          Pray seek you a partner to join in the dance?  _Sie._   No: it has no charm for me.  _Cho._   As the wind that sportively plays,          At first will light dust only raise,          Yet, at last, becomes a gale,          So our dancing and our singing,          Soft at first, then loudly ringing,          Will resound o'er hill and dale.                    (MARGUERITE enters.) _Faust._ It is she! behold her!  _Mep._   'Tis well! now, then, approach!  _Sie._            (perceiving MARGUERITE and approaching her).          Marguerite!  _Mep._       (turning round and finding himself face to face with SIEBEL).          What say you?  _Sie._                     (aside).          Malediction! here again!  _Mep._                     (coaxingly).          What, here again, dear boy?                     (laughing).          Ha, ha! a right good jest!     (SIEBEL retreats before MEPHISTOPHELES, who then compels him   to make a circuit of the stage, passing behind the dancers.)  _Faust_        (approaching MARGUERITE, who crosses the stage).          Will you not permit me, my fairest demoiselle,          To offer you my arm, and clear for you the way?  _Mar._   No, sir. I am no demoiselle, neither am I fair;          And I have no need to accept your offered arm.                     (Passes FAUST and retires.)  _Faust_                 (gazing after her).          What beauty! What grace! What modesty!          O lovely child, I love thee! I love thee!  _Sie._       (coming forward, without having seen what has occurred).          She has gone!     (He is about to hurry after MARGUERITE, when he suddenly finds   himself face to face with MEPHISTOPHELES--he hastily turns away   and leaves the stage.)  _Mep._   Well, Doctor!  _Faust._ Well. She has repulsed me.  _Mep._                     (laughing).          Ay, truly, I see, in love,          You know not how to make the first move.  (He retires with FAUST, in the direction taken by MARGUERITE.)  _Some of the Maidens_   (who have noticed the meeting between FAUST and MARGUERITE).           What is it?  _Others._ Marguerite.

Waltz again!  _Maidens._          Waltz always!     ACT III.   SCENE I.  MARGUERITE's Garden.      (At the back a wall, with a little door. To the left a bower.   On the right a pavilion, with a window facing the audience.   Trees, shrubs, etc.)      SIEBEL, alone. (He enters through the little door at the back,   and stops on the threshold of the pavilion, near a group of   roses and lilies.)  _Sie._                         I.          Gently whisper to her of love, dear flow'r;          Tell her that I adore her,          And for me, oh, implore her,          For my heart feels alone for her love's pow'r.           Say in sighing I languish,          That for her, in my anguish,          Beats alone, dearest flow'r,          My aching heart.                 (Plucks flowers.)          Alas! they are wither'd!                 (Throws them away.)          Can the accursed wizard's words be true?      (Plucks another flower, which, on touching his hand,   immediately withers.)           \"Thou shalt ne'er touch flower again          But it shall wither!\"          I'll bathe my hand in holy water!      (Approaches the pavilion, and dips his fingers in a little   font suspended to the wall.)           When day declines, Marguerite hither          Comes to pray, so we'll try again.                  (Plucks more flowers.)          Are they wither'd? No!          Satan, thou art conquer'd!                          II.          In these flowers alone I've faith,          For they will plead for me;          To her they will reveal          My hapless state.          The sole cause of my woe is she,          And yet she knows it not.          But in these flowers I've faith,          For they will plead for me.

MEPHISTOPHELES, FAUST, and SIEBEL.  _Faust._         (cautiously entering through the garden door).          We are here!  _Mep_.   Follow me.  _Faust._ Whom dost thou see?  _Mep._   Siebel, your rival.  _Faust._ Siebel?  _Mep._   Hush! He comes.               (They enter the bower.)  _Sie._           (entering with a bouquet in his hand).          My bouquet is charming indeed?  _Mep._              (aside).          It is indeed!  _Sie._                            Victory!          Tomorrow I'll reveal all to her.          I will disclose to her the secret          That lies concealed in my heart:          A kiss will tell the rest.  _Mep._               (aside, mockingly).                                   Seducer!

FAUST and MEPHISTOPHELES.  _Mep._   Now attend, my dear doctor!          To keep company with the flowers of our friend,          I go to bring you a treasure,          Which outshines them beyond measure,          And of beauty past believing.  _Faust._ Leave me!  _Mep._   I obey. Deign to await me here.                    (Disappears.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE IV.  FAUST.  _Faust._                    (alone).          What new emotion penetrates my soul!          Love, a pure and holy love, pervades my being.          O Marguerite, behold me at thy feet!          All hail, thou dwelling pure and lowly,          Home of an angel fair and holy,          All mortal beauty excelling!          What wealth is here, a wealth outbidding gold,          Of peace, and love, and innocence untold!          Bounteous Nature! 'twas here by day thy love was taught her,          Thou here with kindly care didst o'er-shadow thy daughter          Through hours of night!          Here waving tree and flower          Made her an Eden bower          Of beauty and delight,          For one whose very birth          Brought down heaven to our earth.          All hail, thou dwelling pure and lowly,          Home of an angel fair and holy.              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE V.

If flowers are more potent than bright jewels,          Then I consent to lose my power.           (Opens the casket and displays the jewels.)  _Faust._ Let us fly; I ne'er will see her more.  _Mep._   What scruple now assails thee?           (Lays the casket on the threshold of the pavilion.)          See on yonder step,          The jewels snugly lie;          We've reason now to hope.      (Draws FAUST after him, and disappears in the garden.   MARGUERITE enters through the doorway at the back,   and advances silently to the front.)              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE VI.  MARGUERITE.  _Mar._                     (alone).          Fain would I know the name          Of the fair youth I met?          Fain would I his birth          And station also know?      (Seats herself at her wheel in the arbor, and arranges   the flax upon the spindle.)                          I.          \"Once there was a king in Thulé,          Who was until death always faithful,          And in memory of his loved one          Caused a cup of gold to be made.\"                   (Breaking off.)          His manner was so gentle! 'Twas true politeness.                   (Resuming the song.)          \"Never treasure prized he so dearly,          Naught else would use on festive days,          And always when he drank from it,          His eyes with tears would be o'erflowing.\"                          II.          (She rises, and takes a few paces.)          \"When he knew that death was near,          As he lay on his cold couch smiling,          Once more he raised with greatest effort          To his lips the golden vase.\"                   (Breaking off.)          I knew not what to say, my face red with blushes!                   (Resuming the song.)          \"And when he, to honor his lady,          Drank from the cup the last, last time,          Soon falling from his trembling grasp,          Then gently passed his soul away.\"          Nobles alone can bear them with so bold a mien,          So tender, too, withal!               (She goes toward the pavilion.)          I'll think of him no more! Good Valentine!          If heav'n heeds my prayer, we shall meet again.          Meanwhile I am alone!      (Suddenly perceiving the bouquet attached to the door   of the pavilion.)           Flowers!                  (Unfastens the bouquet.)          They are Siebel's, surely!          Poor faithful boy!                  (Perceiving the casket.)          But what is this?          From whom did this splendid casket come?          I dare not touch it--          Yet see, here is the key!--I'll take one look!          How I tremble--yet why?--can it be          Much harm just to look in a casket!                  (Opens the casket and lets the bouquet fall.)          Oh, heaven! what jewels!          Can I be dreaming?          Or am I really awake?          Ne'er have I seen such costly things before!         (Puts down the casket on a rustic seat, and kneels down         in order to adorn herself with the jewels.)           I should just like to see          How they'd look upon me          Those brightly sparkling ear-drops!                (Takes out the ear-rings.)          Ah! at the bottom of the casket is a glass:          I there can see myself!--          But am I not becoming vain?    (Puts on the ear-rings, rises, and looks at herself in the glass.)           Ah! I laugh, as I pass, to look into a glass;          Is it truly Marguerite, then?          Is it you?          Tell me true!          No, no, no, 'tis not you!          No, no, that bright face there reflected          Must belong to a queen!          It reflects some fair queen, whom I greet as I pass her.          Ah! could he see me now,          Here, deck'd like this, I vow,          He surely would mistake me,          And for noble lady take me!          I'll try on the rest.          The necklace and the bracelets          I fain would try!             (She adorns herself with the bracelets and necklace,                  then rises.)          Heavens! 'Tis like a hand          That on mine arm doth rest!          Ah! I laugh, as I pass, to look into a glass;          Is it truly Marguerite, then?          Is it you?          Tell me true!

Oh! could he see me now,          Here, deck'd like this, I vow,          He surely would mistake me,          And for noble lady take me!              *       *       *       *       *   SCENE VII.  MARGUERITE and MARTHA.  _Mart._  Just heaven! what is't I see?          How fair you now do seem!          Why, what has happened?
