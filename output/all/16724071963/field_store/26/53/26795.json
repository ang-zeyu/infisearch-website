That's both their cases in a philippine! The leeches told the Jew he must do his Carlsbad this year before the case came on; and the tremendous amount it's going to cost may account for his dunning old clients the moment he gets back.\"  \"Then why should he lend to you?\"  \"I'm a new client, Bunny; that makes all the difference. Then we were very good pals out there.\"  \"But you and Mrs. Shylock were better still?\"  \"Unbeknowns, Bunny! She used to tell me her troubles when I lent her an arm and took due care to look a martyr; my hunting friend had coarse metaphors about heavy-weights and the knacker's yard.\"  \"And yet you came away with the poor soul's necklace?\"  Raffles was tapping the chronic cigarette on the table at his elbow; he stood up to light it, as one does stand up to make the dramatic announcements of one's life, and he spoke through the flame of the match as it rose and fell between his puffs.  \"No--Bunny--I did not!\"  \"But you told me you won the Emerald Stakes!\" I cried, jumping up in my turn.  \"So I did, Bunny, but I gave them back again.\"  \"You gave yourself away to her, as she'd given him away to you?\"  \"Don't be a fool, Bunny,\" said Raffles, subsiding into his chair. \"I can't tell you the whole thing now, but here are the main heads. They're at the Savoy Hotel, in Carlsbad I mean. I go to Pupp's. We meet. They stare. I come out of my British shell as the humble hero of the affair at the other Savoy. I crab my hotel. They swear by theirs. I go to see their rooms. I wait till I can get the very same thing immediately overhead on the second floor--where I can even hear the old swine cursing her from under his mud-poultice! Both suites have balconies that might have been made for me. Need I go on?\"  \"I wonder you weren't suspected.\"  \"There's no end to your capacity for wonder, Bunny. I took some sweet old rags with me on purpose, carefully packed inside a decent suit, and I had the luck to pick up a foul old German cap that some peasant had cast off in the woods. I only meant to leave it on them like a card; as it was--well, I was waiting for the best barber in the place to open his shop next morning.\"  \"What had happened?\"  \"A whole actful of unrehearsed effects; that's why I think twice before taking on old Shylock again. I admire him, Bunny, as a steely foeman. I look forward to another game with him on his own ground. But I must find out the pace of the wicket before I put myself on.\"  \"I suppose you had tea with them, and all that sort of thing?\"  \"Giesh√ºbler!\" said Raffles with a shudder. \"But I made it last as long as tea, and thought I had located the little green lamps before I took my leave. There was a japanned despatch box in one corner. 'That's the Emerald Isle,' I thought, 'I'll soon have it out of the sea. The old man won't trust 'em to the old lady after what happened in town,' I needn't tell you I knew they were there somewhere; he made her wear them even at the tragic travesty of a Carlsbad hotel dinner.\"  Raffles was forgetting to be laconic now. I believe he had forgotten the lad in the next room, and everything else but the breathless battle that he was fighting over again for my benefit. He told me how he waited for a dark night, and then slid down from his sitting-room balcony to the one below. And my emeralds were not in the japanned box after all; and just as he had assured himself of the fact, the folding-doors opened \"as it might be these,\" and there stood Dan Levy \"in a suit of swagger silk pyjamas.\"  \"They gave me a sudden respect for him,\" continued Raffles; \"it struck me, for the first time, that mud baths mightn't be the only ones he ever took. His face was as evil as ever, but he was utterly unarmed, and I was not; and yet there he stood and abused me like a pickpocket, as if there was no chance of my firing, and he didn't care whether I did or not. So I stuck my revolver nearly in his face, and pulled the hammer up and up. Good God, Bunny, if I had pulled too hard! But that made him blink a bit, and I was jolly glad to let it down again. 'Out with those emeralds,' says I in low German mugged up in case of need. Of course you realise that I was absolutely unrecognisable, a low blackguard with a blackened face. 'I don't know what you mean,' says he, 'and I'm damned if I care.' '_Das halsband_, says I, which means the necklace. 'Go to hell,' says he. But I struck myself and shook my head and then my fist at him and nodded. He laughed in my face; and upon my soul we were at a deadlock. So I pointed to the clock and held up one finger. 'I've one minute to live, old girl,' says he through the doors, 'if this rotter has the guts to shoot, and I don't think he has. Why the hell don't you get out the other way and alarm the 'ouse?' And that raised the siege, Bunny. In comes the old woman, as plucky as he was, and shoves the necklace into my left hand. I longed to refuse it. I didn't dare. And the old beast took her and shook her like a rat, until I covered him again, and swore in German that if he showed himself on the balcony for the next two minutes he'd be _ein toter Englander_! That was the other bit I'd got off pat; it was meant to mean 'a dead Englishman.' And I left the fine old girl clinging on to him, instead of him to her!\"  I emptied my lungs and my glass too. Raffles took a sip himself.  \"But the rope was fixed to _your_ balcony, A.J.?\"  \"But I began by fixing the other end to theirs, and the moment I was safely up I undid my end and dropped it clear to the ground. They found it dangling all right when out they rushed together. Of course I'd picked the right ball in the way of nights; it was bone-dry as well as pitch-dark, and in five minutes I was helping the rest of the hotel to search for impossible footprints on the gravel, and to stamp out any there might conceivably have been.\"  \"So nobody ever suspected you?\"  \"Not a soul, I can safely say; I was the first my victims bored with the whole yarn.\"  \"Then why return the swag? It's an old trick of yours, Raffles, but in a case like this, with a pig like that, I confess I don't see the point.\"  \"You forget the poor old lady, Bunny. She had a dog's life before; after that the beans he gave her weren't even fit for a dog. I loved her for her pluck in standing up to him; it beat his hollow in standing up to me; there was only one reward for her, and it was in my gift.\"  \"But how on earth did you manage that?\"  \"Not by public presentation, Bunny, nor yet by taking the old dame into my confidence _more cuniculi!\"_  \"I suppose you returned the necklace anonymously?\"  \"As a low-down German burglar would be sure to do! No, Bunny, I planted it in the woods where I knew it would be found. And then I had to watch lest it was found by the wrong sort. But luckily Mr. Shylock had sprung a substantial reward, and all came right in the end. He sent his doctor to blazes, and had a buck feed and lashings on the night it was recovered. The hunting man and I were invited to the thanksgiving spread; but I wouldn't budge from the diet, and he was ashamed to unless I did. It made a coolness between us, and now I doubt if we shall ever have that enormous dinner we used to talk about to celebrate our return from a living tomb.\"  But I was not interested in that shadowy fox-hunter. \"Dan Levy's a formidable brute to tackle,\" said I at length, and none too buoyantly.  \"That's a very true observation, Bunny; it's also exactly why I so looked forward to tackling him. It ought to be the kind of conflict that the halfpenny press have learnt to call Homeric.\"  \"Are you thinking of to-morrow, or of when it comes to robbing Peter to pay Peter?\"  \"Excellent, Bunny!\" cried Raffles, as though I had made a shot worthy of his willow. \"How the small hours brighten us up!\" He drew the curtains and displayed a window like a child's slate with the sashes ruled across it. \"You perceive how we have tired the stars with talking, and cleaned them from the sky! The mellifluous Heraclitus can have been no sitter up o' nights, or his pal wouldn't have boasted about tiring the sun by our methods. What a lot the two old pets must have missed!\"  \"You haven't answered my question,\" said I resignedly. \"Nor have you told me how you propose to go to work to raise this money in the first instance.\"  \"If you like to light another Sullivan,\" said Raffles, \"and mix yourself another very small and final one, I can tell you now, Bunny.\"  And tell me he did.     CHAPTER IV  \"Our Mr. Shylock\"   I have often wondered in what pause or phase of our conversation Raffles hit upon the plan which we duly carried out; for we had been talking incessantly, since his arrival about eight o'clock at night, until two in the morning. Yet that which we discussed between two and three was what we actually did between nine and ten, with the single exception necessitated by an altogether unforeseen development, of which the less said the better until the proper time. The foresight and imagination of a Raffles are obviously apt to outstrip his spoken words; but even in the course of speech his ideas would crystallise, quite palpably to the listener, and the sentence that began by throwing out a shadowy idea would culminate in a definite project, as the image comes into focus under the lens, and with as much detail into the bargain.  Suffice it that after a long night of it at the Albany, and but a bath and a cup of tea at my own flat, I found Raffles waiting for me in Piccadilly, and down we went together to the jaws of Jermyn Street. There we nodded, and I was proceeding down the hill when I turned on my heel as though I had forgotten something, and entered Jermyn Street not fifty yards behind Raffles. I had no thought of catching him up. But it so happened that I was in his wake in time to witness a first _contretemps_ which did not amount to much at the time; this was merely the violent exit of another of Dan Levy's"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9806"],["title","Mr. Justice Raffles (#5)"],["body","callers into the very arms of Raffles. There was a heated apology, accepted with courteous composure, and followed by an excited outpouring which I did not come near enough to overhear. It was delivered by a little man in an aureole of indigo hair, who brushed his great sombrero violently as he spoke and Raffles listened. I could see from their manner that the collision which had just occurred was not the subject under discussion; but I failed to distinguish a word, though I listened outside a hatter's until Raffles had gone in and his new acquaintance had passed me with blazing eyes and a volley of husky vows in broken English.  \"Another of Mr. Shylock's victims,\" thought I; and indeed he might have been bleeding internally from the loss of his pound of flesh; at any rate there was bloodshed in his eyes.  I stood a long time outside that hatter's window, and finally went in to choose a cap. But the light is wicked in those narrow shops, and this necessitated my carrying several caps to the broad daylight of the threshold to gauge their shades, and incidentally to achieve a swift survey of the street. Then they crowned me with an ingenious apparatus like a typewriter, to get the exact shape and measure of my skull, for I had intimated that I had no desire to dress it anywhere else for the future. All this must have taken up the most of twenty minutes, yet after getting as far as Mr. Shylock's I remembered that I required what one's hatter (and no one else) calls a \"boater,\" and back I went to order one in addition to the cap. And as the next tack fetches the buoy, so my next perambulation (in which, however, I was thinking seriously of a new bowler) brought me face to face with Raffles once more.  We shouted and shook hands; our encounter had taken place almost under the money-lender's windows, and it was so un-English in its cordiality that between our slaps and grasps Raffles managed deftly to insert a stout packet in my breast pocket. I cannot think the most critical pedestrian could have seen it done. But streets have as many eyes as Argus, and some of them are always on one.  \"They had to send to the bank for it,\" whispered Raffles. \"It barely passed through their hands. But don't you let Shylock spot his own envelope!\"  In another second he was saying something very different that anybody might have heard, and in yet another he was hustling me across Shylock's threshold. \"I'll take you up and introduce you,\" he cried aloud. \"You couldn't come to a better man, my dear fellow--he's the only honest one in Europe. Is Mr. Levy disengaged?\"  A stunted young gentleman, who spoke as though he had a hare-lip or was in liquor, neither calamity having really befallen him, said that he thought so, but would see, which he proceeded to do through a telephone, after shifting the indicator from \"Through\" to \"Private.\" He slid off his stool at once, and another youth, of similar appearance and still more similar peculiarity of speech, who entered in a hurry at that moment, was told to hold on while he showed the gentlemen up-stairs. There were other clerks behind the mahogany bulwark, and we heard the newcomer greeting them hoarsely as we climbed up into the presence.  Dan Levy, as I must try to call him when Raffles is not varnishing my tale, looked a very big man at his enormous desk, but by no means so elephantine as at the tiny table in the Savoy Restaurant a month earlier. His privations had not only reduced his bulk to the naked eye, but made him look ten years younger. He wore the habiliments of a gentleman; even as he sat at his desk his well-cut coat and well-tied tie filled me with that inconsequent respect which the silk pyjamas had engendered in Raffles. But the great face that greeted us with a shrewd and rather scornful geniality impressed me yet more powerfully. In its massive features and its craggy contour it displayed the frank pugnacity of the pugilist rather than the low cunning of the traditional usurer; and the nose in particular, while of far healthier appearance than when I had seen it first and last, was both dominant and menacing in its immensity. It was a comfort to turn from this formidable countenance to that of Raffles, who had entered with his own serene unconscious confidence, and now introduced us with that inimitable air of light-hearted authority which stamped him in all shades of society.  \"'Appy to meet you, sir. I hope you're well?\" said Mr. Levy, dropping one aspirate but putting in the next with care. \"Take a seat, sir, please.\"  But I kept my legs, though I felt them near to trembling, and, diving a hand into a breast pocket, I began working the contents out of the envelope that Raffles had given me, while I spoke out in a tone sufficiently rehearsed at the Albany overnight.  \"I'm not so sure about the happiness,\" said I. \"I mean about its lasting, Mr. Levy. I come from my friend, Mr. Edward Garland.\"  \"I thought you came to borrow money!\" interposed Raffles with much indignation. The moneylender was watching me with bright eyes and lips I could no longer see.  \"I never said so,\" I rapped out at Raffles; and I thought I saw approval and encouragement behind his stare like truth at the bottom of the well.  \"Who _is_ the little biter?\" the money-lender inquired of him with delightful insolence.  \"An old friend of mine,\" replied Raffles, in an injured tone that made a convincing end of the old friendship. \"I thought he was hard up, or I never should have brought him in to introduce to you.\"  \"I didn't ask you for your introduction, Raffles,\" said I offensively. \"I simply met you coming out as I was coming in. I thought you damned officious, if you ask me!\"  Whereupon, with an Anglo-Saxon threat of subsequent violence to my person, Raffles flung open the door to leave us to our interview. This was exactly as it had been rehearsed. But Dan Levy called Raffles back. And that was exactly as we had hoped.  \"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" said the Jew. \"Please don't make a cockpit of my office, gentlemen; and pray, Mr. Raffles, don't leave me to the mercies of your very dangerous friend.\"  \"You can be two to one if you like,\" I gasped valiantly. \"_I_ don't care.\"  And my chest heaved in accordance with my stage instructions, as also with a realism to which it was a relief to give full play.  \"Come now,\" said Levy. \"What did Mr. Garland send you about?\"  \"You know well enough,\" said I: \"his debt to you.\"  \"Don't be rude about it,\" said Levy. \"What about the debt?\"  \"It's a damned disgrace!\" said I.  \"I quite agree,\" he chuckled. \"It ought to 'ave been settled months ago.\"  \"Months ago?\" I echoed. \"It's only twelve months since he borrowed three hundred pounds from you, and now you're sticking him for seven!\"  \"I am,\" said Levy, opening uncompromising lips that entirely disappeared again next instant.  \"He borrows three hundred for a year at the outside, and you blackmail him for eight hundred when the year's up.\"  \"You said 'seven' just now,\" interrupted Raffles, but in the voice of a man who was getting a fright.  \"You also said 'blackmailing,'\" added Dan Levy portentously. \"Do you want to be thrown downstairs?\"  \"Do _you_ deny the figures?\" I retorted.  \"No, I don't; have you got his repayment cards?\"  \"Yes, here in my hands, and they shan't leave them. You see, you're not aware,\" I added severely, as I turned to Raffles, \"that this young fellow has already paid up one hundred in instalments; that's what makes the eight; and all this is what'll happen to you if you've been fool enough to get into the same boat.\"  The money-lender had borne with me longer than either of us had expected that he would; but now he wheeled back his chair and stood up, a pillar of peril and a mouthful of oaths.  \"Is that all you've come to say?\" he thundered. \"If so, you young devil, out you go!\"  \"No, it isn't,\" said I, spreading out a document attached to the cards of receipt which Raffles had obtained from Teddy Garland; these I had managed to extract without anything else from the inner pocket in which I had been trying to empty out Raffles's envelope. \"Here,\" I continued, \"is a letter, written only yesterday, by you to Mr. Garland, in which you say, among other very insolent things: 'This is final, and absolutely no excuses of any kind will be tolerated or accepted. You have given ten times more trouble than your custom is worth, and I shall be glad to get rid of you. So you had better pay up before twelve o'clock to-morrow, as you may depend that the above threats will be carried out to the very letter, and steps will be taken to carry them into effect at that hour. This is your dead and last chance, and the last time I will write you on the subject.'\"  \"So it is,\" said Levy with an oath. \"This is a very bad case, Mr. Raffles.\"  \"I agree,\" said I. \"And may I ask if you propose to 'get rid' of Mr. Garland by making him 'pay up' in full?\"  \"Before twelve o'clock to-day,\" said Dan Levy, with a snap of his prize-fighting jaws.  \"Eight hundred, first and last, for the three hundred he borrowed a year ago?\"  \"That's it.\"  \"Surely that's very hard on the boy,\" I said, reaching the conciliatory stage by degrees on which Raffles paid me many compliments later; but at the time he remarked, \"I should say it was his own fault.\"  \"Of course it is, Mr. Raffles,\" cried the moneylender, taking a more conciliatory tone himself. \"It was my money; it was my three 'undred golden sovereigns; and you can sell what's yours for what it'll fetch, can't you?\"  \"Obviously,\" said Raffles.  \"Very well, then, money's like anything else; if you haven't got it, and can't beg or earn it, you've got to buy it at a price. I sell my money, that's all. And I've a right to sell it at a fancy price if I can get a fancy price for it. A man may be a fool to pay my figure; that depends 'ow much he wants the money at the time, and it's his affair, not mine. Your gay young friend was all right if he hadn't defaulted, but a defaulter deserves to pay"]]]
