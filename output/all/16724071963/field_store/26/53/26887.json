As its tinkle sounded somewhere up the yard behind, he thrust his whistle into Viner's hand.  \"Mr. Viner,\" he said, \"go up to the end of the passage and blow on that as loud as you can, three times. I'll stand by here till you come back. If you don't hear or see any of our people coming from either direction, blow again.\"  Viner heard steps coming down the yard behind the door as he walked away. And he heard more steps, hurrying steps, as he reached the end of the passage. He turned it to find an inspector and a sergeant approaching from one part of the terrace, a constable from another.  \"You're wanted down here,\" said Viner as they all converged on him. \"There's been murder! One of your men's there--he gave me this whistle to summon further help. This way!\"  The police followed him in silence down the passage. Another figure had come on the scene. Bending over the body and closely scrutinizing it in the light of the policeman's lantern was a man whom Viner knew well enough by sight--a tall, handsome man, whose olive-tinted complexion, large lustrous eyes and Vandyke beard gave him the appearance of a foreigner. Yet though he had often seen him, Viner did not know his name; the police-inspector, however, evidently knew it well enough.  \"What is it, Dr. Cortelyon?\" he asked as he pushed himself to the front. \"Is the man dead?\"  Dr. Cortelyon drew himself up from his stooping position to his full height--a striking figure in his dress jacket and immaculate linen. He glanced round at the expectant faces.  \"The man's been murdered!\" he said in calm, professional accents. \"He's been stabbed clean through the heart. Dead? Yes, for several minutes.\"  \"Who found him here?\" demanded the inspector.  \"I found him,\" answered Viner. He gave a hurried account of the whole circumstances as he knew them, the police watching him keenly. \"I should know the man again if I saw him,\" he concluded. \"I saw his face clearly enough as he passed me.\"  The inspector bent down and hastily felt the dead man's pockets.  \"Nothing at all here,\" he said as he straightened himself. \"No watch or chain or purse or anything. Looks like robbery as well as murder. Does anybody know him?\"  \"I know who this gentlemen is, sir,\" answered the policeman to whom Viner had first gone. \"He's a Mr. Ashton, who came to live not so long since at number seven in Markendale Square, close by Mr. Viner there. I've heard that he came from the Colonies.\"  \"Do you know him,\" asked the inspector, turning to Viner.  \"Only by sight,\" answered Viner. \"I've seen him often, but I didn't know his name. I believe he has a wife and daughter--\"  \"No sir,\" interrupted the policeman. \"He was a single gentleman. The young lady at number seven is his ward, and the older lady looked after her--sort of a companion.\"  The Inspector looked round. Other policemen, attracted by the whistle, were coming into the passage at each end, and he turned to his sergeant.  \"Put a man at the top and another at the bottom of this passage,\" he said. \"Keep everybody out. Send for the divisional surgeon. Dr. Cortelyon, will you see him when he comes along? I want him to see the body before its removal. Now, then, about these ladies--they'll have to be told.\" He turned to Viner. \"I understand you live close by them?\" he asked. \"Perhaps you'll go there with me?\"  Viner nodded; and the inspector, after giving a few more words of instruction to the sergeant, motioned him to follow; together they went down the passage into Markendale Square.  \"Been resident here long, Mr. Viner?\" asked the Inspector as they emerged. \"I noticed that some of my men knew you. I've only recently come into this part myself.\"  \"Fifteen years,\" answered Viner.  \"Do you know anything of this dead man?\"  \"Nothing--not so much as your constable knows.\"  \"Policemen pick things up. These ladies, now? It's a most unpleasant thing to have to go and break news like this. You know nothing about them, sir?\"  \"Not even as much as your man knew. I've seen them often--with him, the dead man. There's an elderly lady and a younger one, a mere girl. I took them for his wife and daughter. But you heard what your man said.\"  \"Well, whatever they are, they've got to be told. I'd be obliged if you'd come with me. And then--that fellow you saw running away! You'll have to give us as near a description of him as you can. What number did my man say it was--seven?\"  Viner suddenly laid a hand on his companion's sleeve. A smart car, of the sort let out on hire from the more pretentious automobile establishments, had just come round the corner and was being pulled up at the door of a house in whose porticoed front hung a brilliant lamp.  \"That's number seven,\" said Viner. \"And--those are the two ladies.\"  The Inspector stopped and watched. The door of the house opened, letting a further flood of light on the broad step beneath the portico and on the pavement beyond; the door of the car opened too, and a girl stepped out, and for a second or two stood in the full glare of the lamps. She was a slender, lissome young creature, gowned in white, and muffled to the throat in an opera cloak out of which a fresh, girlish face, bright in colour, sparkling of eye, crowned by a mass of hair of the tint of dead gold, showed clearly ere she rapidly crossed to the open door. After her came an elderly, well-preserved woman in an elaborate evening toilette, the personification of the precise and conventional chaperon. The door closed; the car drove away; the Inspector turned to Viner with a shake of his head.  \"Just home from the theatre!\" he said. \"And--to hear this! Well, it's got to be done, Mr. Viner, anyhow.\"  Viner, who had often observed the girl whom they had just seen with an interest for which he had never troubled to account, found himself wishing that Miss Penkridge was there in his place. He did not know what part he was to play, what he was to do or say; worse than that, he did not know if the girl in whose presence he would certainly find himself within a minute or two was very fond of the man whom he had just found done to death. In that case--but here his musings were cut short by the fact that the Inspector had touched the bell in the portico of number seven, and that the door had opened, to reveal a smart and wondering parlour-maid, who glanced with surprise at the inspector's uniform.  \"Hush! This is Mr. Ashton's?\" said the Inspector. \"Yes--well, now, what is the name of the lady--the elderly lady--I saw come in just now? Keep quiet, there's a good girl,--the fact is, Mr. Ashton's had an accident, and I want to see that lady.\"  \"Mrs. Killenhall,\" answered the parlour-maid.  \"And the young lady--her name?\" asked the Inspector.  \"Miss Wickham.\"  The Inspector walked inside the house.  \"Just ask Mrs. Killenhall and Miss Wickham if they'll be good enough to see Inspector Drillford for a few minutes,\" he said. Then, as the girl closed the door and turned away up the inner hall, he whispered to Viner. \"Better see both and be done with it. It's no use keeping bad news too long; they may as well know--both.\"  The parlour-maid reappeared at the door of a room along the hall; and the two men, advancing in answer to her summons, entered what was evidently the dining-room of the house. The two ladies had thrown off their wraps; the younger one sat near a big, cheery fire, holding her slender fingers to the blaze; the elder stood facing the door in evident expectancy. The room itself was luxuriously furnished in a somewhat old-fashioned, heavy style; everything about it betokened wealth and comfort. And that its owner was expected home every minute was made evident to the two men by the fact that a spirit-case was set on the centre table, with glasses and mineral waters and cigars; Viner remembered, as his eyes encountered these things, that a half-burned cigar lay close to the dead man's hand in that dark passage so close by.  \"Mrs. Killenhall? Miss Wickham?\" began Drillford, looking sharply from one to the other. \"Sorry to break in on you like this, ladies, but the fact is, there has been an accident to Mr. Ashton, and I'm obliged to come and tell you about it.\"  Viner, who had remained a little in the background, was watching the faces of the two to whom this initial breaking of news was made. And he saw at once that there was going to be no scene. The girl by the fire looked for an instant at the inspector with an expression of surprise, but it was not the surprise of great personal concern. As for the elder woman, after one quick glance from Drillford to Viner, whom she evidently recognized, she showed absolute self-possession.  \"A bad accident?\" she asked.  Drillford again looked from the elder to the younger lady.  \"You'll excuse me if I ask what relation you ladies are to Mr. Ashton?\" he said with a significant glance at Mrs. Killenhall.  \"None!\" replied Mrs. Killenhall. \"Miss Wickham is Mr. Ashton's ward. I am Miss Wickham's chaperon--and companion.\"  \"Well, ma'am,\" said Drillford, \"then I may tell you that my news is--just about as serious as it possibly could be, you understand.\"  In the silence that followed, the girl turned toward the visitors, and Viner saw her colour change a little. And it was she who first spoke.  \"Don't be afraid to tell us,\" she said. \"Is Mr. Ashton dead?\"  Drillford inclined his head, and spoke as he was bidden.  \"I'm sorry to say he is,\" he replied. \"And still more to be obliged to tell you that he came to his death by violence. The truth is--\"  He paused, looking from one to the other, as if to gauge the effect of his words. And again it was the girl who spoke.  \"What is the truth?\" she asked.  \"Murder!\" said Drillford. \"Just that!\"  Mrs. Killenhall, who had remained standing until then, suddenly sat down, with a murmur of horror. But the girl was watching the inspector steadily.  \"When was this? and how, and where?\" she "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9902"],["title","The Middle of Things (#3)"],["body","inquired.  \"A little time ago, near here,\" answered Drillford. \"This gentleman, Mr. Viner, a neighbour of yours, found him--dead. There's no doubt, from what we can see, that he was murdered for the sake of robbery. And I want some information about him, about his habits and--\"  Miss Wickham got up from her chair and looked meaningly at Mrs. Killenhall.  \"The fact is,\" she said, turning to Drillford; \"strange as it may seem, neither Mrs. Killenhall nor myself know very much about Mr. Ashton.\"     CHAPTER III  WHO WAS MR. ASHTON?   For the first time since they had entered the room, Drillford turned and glanced at Viner; his look indicated the idea which Miss Wickham's last words had set up in his mind. Here was a mystery! The police instinct was aroused by it.  \"You don't know very much about Mr. Ashton?\" he said, turning back to the two ladies. \"Yet--you're under his roof? This is his house, isn't it?\"  \"Just so,\" assented Miss Wickham. \"But when I say we don't know much, I mean what I say. Mrs. Killenhall has only known Mr. Ashton a few weeks, and until two months ago I had not seen Mr. Ashton for twelve years. Therefore, neither of us can know much about him.\"  \"Would you mind telling me what you do know?\" asked Drillford. \"We've got to know something--who he is, and so on.\"  \"All that I know is this,\" replied Miss Wickham. \"My father died in Australia, when I was about six years old. My mother was already dead, and my father left me in charge of Mr. Ashton. He sent me, very soon after my father's death, to school in England, and there I remained for twelve years. About two months ago Mr. Ashton came to England, took this house, fetched me from school and got Mrs. Killenhall to look after me. Here we've all been ever since--and beyond that I know scarcely anything.\"  Drillford looked at the elder lady.  \"I know, practically, no more than Miss Wickham has told you,\" said Mrs. Killenhall. \"Mr. Ashton and I got in touch with each other through his advertisement in the _Morning Post_. We exchanged references, and I came here.\"  \"Ah!\" said Drillford. \"And--what might his references be, now?\"  \"To his bankers, the London and Orient, in Threadneedle Street,\" answered Mrs. Killenhall promptly. \"And to his solicitors, Crawle, Pawle and Rattenbury, of Bedford Bow.\"  \"Very satisfactory they were, no doubt, ma'am?\" suggested Drillford.  Mrs. Killenhall let her eye run round the appointments of the room.  \"Eminently so,\" she said dryly. \"Mr. Ashton was a very wealthy man.\"  Drillford pulled out a pocketbook and entered the names which Mrs. Killenhall had just mentioned.  \"The solicitors will be able to tell something,\" he murmured as he put the book back. \"We'll communicate with them first thing in the morning. But just two questions before I go. Can you tell me anything about Mr. Ashton's usual habits? Had he any business? What did he do with his time?\"  \"He was out a great deal,\" said Mrs. Killenhall. \"He used to go down to the City. He was often out of an evening. Once, since I came here, he was away for a week in the country--he didn't say where. He was an active man--always in and out. But he never said much as to where he went.\"  \"The other question,\" said Drillford, \"is this: Did he carry much on him in the way of valuables or money? I mean--as a rule?\"  \"He wore a very fine gold watch and chain,\" answered Mrs. Killenhall; \"and as for money--well, he always seemed to have a lot in his purse. And he wore two diamond rings--very fine stones.\"  \"Just so!\" murmured Drillford. \"Set upon for the sake of those things, no doubt. Well, ladies, I shall telephone to Crawle's first thing in the morning, and they'll send somebody along at once, of course. I'm sorry to have brought you such bad news, but--\"  He turned toward the door; Miss Wickham stopped him.  \"Will Mr. Ashton's body be brought here--tonight?\" she asked.  \"No,\" replied Drillford. \"It will be taken to the mortuary. If you'll leave everything to me, I'll see that you are spared as much as possible. Of course, there'll have to be an inquest--but you'll hear all about that tomorrow. Leave things to us and to Mr. Ashton's solicitors.\"  He moved towards the door, and Viner, until then a silent spectator, looked at Miss Wickham, something impelling him to address her instead of Mrs. Killenhall.  \"I live close by you,\" he said. \"If there is anything that I can do, or that my aunt Miss Penkridge, who lives with me, can do? Perhaps you will let me call in the morning.\"  The girl looked at him steadily and frankly.  \"Thank you, Mr. Viner,\" she said. \"It would be very kind if you would. We've no men folk--yes, please do.\"  \"After breakfast, then,\" answered Viner, and went away to join the Inspector, who had walked into the hall.  \"What do you think of this matter?\" he asked, when they had got outside the house.  \"Oh, a very clear and ordinary case enough, Mr. Viner,\" replied Drillford. \"No mystery about it at all. Here's this Mr. Ashton been living here some weeks--some fellow, the man, of course, whom you saw running away, has noticed that he was a very rich man and wore expensive jewellery, has watched him, probably knew that he used that passage as a short cut, and has laid in wait for him and murdered him for what he'd got on him. It wouldn't take two minutes to do the whole thing. Rings, now! They spoke of diamond rings, in there. Well, I didn't see any diamond rings on his hands when I looked at his body, and I particularly noticed his hands, to see if there were signs of any struggle. No sir--it's just a plain case of what used to be called highway robbery and murder. But come round with me to the police-station, Mr. Viner--they'll have taken him to the mortuary by now, and I should like to hear what our divisional surgeon has to say, and what our people actually found on the body.\"  As Viner and the Inspector walked into the police-station, Dr. Cortelyon came out. Drillford stopped him.  \"Found out anything more, Doctor?\" he asked.  \"Nothing beyond what I said at first,\" replied Cortelyon. \"The man has been stabbed through the heart, from behind, in one particularly well-delivered blow. I should say the murderer had waited for him in that passage, probably knowing his habits. That passage, now--you know it really will have to be seen to! That wretched old lamp in the middle gives no light at all. The wonder is that something of this sort hasn't occurred before.\"  Drillford muttered something about local authorities and property-owners and went forward into an office, motioning Viner to follow. The divisional surgeon was there in conversation with the sergeant whom Drillford had left in charge of the body. \"That is something on which I'd stake my professional reputation,\" he said. \"I'm sure of it.\"  \"What's that, Doctor?\" asked Drillford. \"Something to do with this affair?\"  \"I was saying that whoever stabbed this unfortunate man had some knowledge of anatomy,\" remarked the doctor. \"He was killed by one swift blow from a particularly keen-edged, thin-bladed weapon which was driven through his back at the exact spot. You ought to make a minute search behind the walls on either side of that passage--the probability is that the murderer threw his weapon away.\"  \"We'll do all that, Doctor,\" said Drillford. \"As to your suggestion--don't you forget that there are a good many criminals here in London who are regular experts in the use of the knife--I've seen plenty of instances of that myself. Now,\" he went on, turning to the sergeant, \"about that search? What did you find on him?\"  The sergeant lifted the lid of a desk and pointed to a sheet of foolscap paper whereon lay certain small articles at which Viner gazed with a sense of strange fascination. A penknife, a small gold matchbox, a gold-mounted pencil-case, some silver coins, a handkerchief, and conspicuous among the rest, a farthing.  \"That's the lot,\" said the sergeant, \"except another handkerchief, and a pair of gloves in the overcoat, where I've left them. Nothing else--no watch, chain, purse or pocketbook. And no rings--but it's very plain from his fingers that he wore two rings one on each hand, third finger in each case.\"  \"There you are!\" said Drillford with a glance at Viner. \"Murdered and robbed--clear case! Now, Mr. Viner, give us as accurate a description as possible of the fellow who ran out of that passage.\"  Viner did his best. His recollections were of a young man of about his own age, about his own height and build, somewhat above the medium; it was his impression, he said, that the man was dressed, if not shabbily, at least poorly; he had an impression, too, that the clean-shaven face which he had seen for a brief moment was thin and worn.  \"Got any recollection of his exact look?\" inquired the Inspector. \"That's a lot to go by.\"  \"I'm trying to think,\" said Viner. \"Yes--I should say he looked to be pretty hard-up. There was a sort of desperate gleam in his eye. And--\"  \"Take your time,\" remarked Drillford. \"Anything you can suggest, you know--\"  \"Well,\" replied Viner. \"I'd an idea at the moment, and I've had it since, that I'd seen this man before. Something in his face was familiar. The only thing I can think of is this: I potter round old bookshops and curiosity-shops a good deal--I may have seen this young fellow on some occasion of that sort.\"  \"Anyway,\" suggested Drillford, glancing over the particulars which he had written down, \"you'd know him again if you saw him?\"  \"Oh, certainly!\" asserted Viner. \"I should know him anywhere.\"  \"Then that's all we need trouble you with now, sir,\" said Drillford. \"The next business will be--tomorrow.\"  Viner walked slowly out of the police-station and still more slowly homeward. When he reached the first lamp, he drew out his watch. Half-past twelve! Just two hours ago he had been in his own comfortable library, smiling at Miss Penkridge's ideas about the very matters into one of which he was now plunged. He would not have been surprised if he had"]]]
