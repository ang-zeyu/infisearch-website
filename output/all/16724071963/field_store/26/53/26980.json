Halbert looked after him, enviously, as he rowed the boat out into the stream. He had asked his father to buy him a boat, but the superintendent's speculations had not turned out very well of late, and he had been deaf to his son's persuasions, backed, though they were, by his mother's influence. When Halbert heard that William Paine was going to boarding school, he decided to ask him for the loan of his boat during his absence, as the next best thing. Now, it seemed that he had been forestalled, and by the boy he hated. He resolved to see young Paine himself, and offer him two dollars for the use of his boat during the coming term. Then he would have the double satisfaction of using the boat and disappointing Robert.  He made his way to the house of Squire Paine, and, after a brief pause, was admitted. He was shown into the parlor, and Will Paine came down to see him.  \"How are you, Davis?\" he said, nodding, coolly, but not offering his hand.  \"I hear you are going to boarding school?\"  \"Yes; I go to-morrow.\"  \"I suppose you won't take your boat with you?\"  \"No.\"  \"I'll give you two dollars for the use of it; the next three months?\"  \"I can't accept your offer. Robert Rushton is to have it.\"  \"But he doesn't pay you anything for it. I'll give you three dollars, if you say so?\"  \"You can't have it for three dollars, or ten. I have promised it to my friend, Robert Rushton, and I shall not take it back.\"  \"You may not know,\" said Halbert, maliciously, \"that your friend was discharged from the factory this morning for misconduct.\"  \"I know very well that he was discharged, and through whose influence, Halbert Davis,\" said Will, pointedly. \"I like him all the better for his misfortune, and so I am sure will my sister.\"  Halbert's face betrayed the anger and jealousy he felt, but he didn't dare to speak to the lawyer's son as he had to the factory boy.  \"Good-morning!\" he said, rising to go.  \"Good-morning!\" said young Paine, formally.  Halbert felt, as he walked homeward, that his triumph over Robert was by no means complete.     CHAPTER VII.   THE STRANGE PASSENGER.  Robert, though not a professional fisherman, was not wholly inexperienced. This morning he was quite lucky, catching quite a fine lot of fish--as much, indeed, as his mother and himself would require a week to dispose of. However, he did not intend to carry them all home. It occurred to him that he could sell them at a market store in the village. Otherwise, he would not have cared to go on destroying life for no useful end.  Accordingly, on reaching the shore, he strung the fish and walked homeward, by way of the market. It was rather a heavy tug, for the fish he had caught weighed at least fifty pounds.  Stepping into the store, he attracted the attention of the proprietor.  \"That's a fine lot of fish you have there, Robert. What are you going to do with them?\"  \"I'm going to sell most of them to you, if I can.\"  \"Are they just out of the water?\"  \"Yes; I have just brought them in.\"  \"What do you want for them?\"  \"I don't know what is a fair price?\"  \"I'll give you two cents a pound for as many as you want to sell.\"  \"All right,\" said our hero, with satisfaction. \"I'll carry this one home, and you can weigh the rest.\"  The rest proved to weigh forty-five pounds. The marketman handed Robert ninety cents, which he pocketed with satisfaction.  \"Shall you want some more to-morrow?\" he asked.  \"Yes, if you can let me have them earlier. But how is it you are not at the factory?\"  \"I've lost my place.\"  \"That's a pity.\"  \"So I have plenty of time to work for you.\"  \"I may be able to take considerable from you. I'm thinking of running a cart to Brampton every morning, but I must have the fish by eight o'clock, or it'll be too late.\"  \"I'll go out early in the morning, then.\"  \"Very well; bring me what you have at that hour, and we'll strike a trade.\"  \"I've got something to do pretty quick,\" thought Robert, with satisfaction. \"It was a lucky thought asking Will Paine for his boat. I'm sorry he's going away, but it happens just right for me.\"  Mrs. Rushton was sitting at her work, in rather a disconsolate frame of mind. The more she thought of Robert's losing his place, the more unfortunate it seemed. She could not be expected to be as sanguine and hopeful as our hero, who was blessed with strong hands and a fund of energy and self-reliance which he inherited from his father. His mother, on the other hand, was delicate and nervous, and apt to look on the dark side of things. But, notwithstanding this, she was a good mother, and Robert loved her.  Nothing had been heard for some time but the drowsy ticking of the clock, when a noise was heard at the door, and Robert entered the room, bringing the fish he had reserved.  \"You see, mother, we are not likely to starve,\" he said.  \"That's a fine, large fish,\" said his mother.  \"Yes; it'll be enough for two meals. Didn't I tell you, mother, I would find something to do?\"  \"True, Robert,\" said his mother, dubiously; \"but we shall get tired of fish if we have it every day.\"  Robert laughed.  \"Six days in the week will do for fish, mother,\" he said. \"I think we shall be able to afford something else Sunday.\"  \"Of course, fish is better than nothing,\" said his mother, who understood him literally; \"and I suppose we ought to be thankful to get that.\"  \"You don't look very much pleased at the prospect of fish six times a week,\" said Robert, laughing again. \"On the whole, I think it will be better to say twice.\"  \"But what will we do other days, Robert?\"  \"What we have always done, mother--eat something else. But I won't keep you longer in suspense. Did you think this was the only fish I caught?\"  \"Yes, I thought so.\"  \"I sold forty-five pounds on the way to Minturn, at his market store--forty-five pounds, at two cents a pound. What do you think of that?\"  \"Do you mean that you have earned ninety cents to-day, Robert?\"  \"Yes; and here's the money.\"  \"That's much better than I expected,\" said Mrs. Rushton, looking several degrees more I cheerful.  \"I don't expect to do as well as that every day, mother, but I don't believe we'll starve. Minturn has engaged me to supply him with fish every day, only some days the fishes won't feel like coming out of the water. Then, I forgot to tell you, I'm to have Will Paine's boat for nothing. He's going to boarding school, and has asked me to take care of it for him.\"  \"You are fortunate, Robert.\"  \"I am hungry, too, mother. Those two sandwiches didn't go a great ways. So, if you can just as well as not have supper earlier, it would suit me.\"  \"I'll put on the teakettle at once, Robert,\" said his mother, rising. \"Would you like some of the fish for supper?\"  \"If it wouldn't be too much trouble.\"  \"Surely not, Robert.\"  The usual supper hour was at five in this country household, but a little after four the table was set, and mother and son sat down to a meal which both enjoyed. The fish proved to be excellent, and Robert enjoyed it the more, first, because he had caught it himself, and next because he felt that his independent stand at the factory, though it had lost him his place, was not likely to subject his mother to the privations he had feared.  \"I'll take another piece of fish, mother,\" said Robert, passing his plate. \"I think, on the whole, I shan't be obliged to learn to braid straw.\"  \"No; you can do better at fishing.\"  \"Only,\" added Robert, with mock seriousness, \"we might change work sometimes, mother; I will stay at home and braid straw, and you can go out fishing.\"  \"I am afraid I should make a poor hand at it,\" said Mrs. Rushton, smiling.  \"If Halbert Davis could look in upon us just now, he would be disappointed to find us so cheerful after my losing my place at factory. However, I've disappointed him in another way.\"  \"How is that?\"  \"He expected Will Paine would lend him his boat while he was gone, but, instead of that, he finds it promised to me.\"  \"I am afraid he is not a very kind-hearted boy.\"  \"That's drawing it altogether too mild, mother. He's the meanest fellow I ever met. However, I won't talk about him any more, or it'll spoil my appetite.\"  On the next two mornings Robert went out at five o'clock, in order to get home in time for the market-wagon. He met with fair luck, but not as good as on the first day. Taking the two mornings together, he captured and sold seventy pounds of fish, which, as the price remained the same, brought him in a dollar and forty cents. This was not equal to his wages at the factory; still, he had the greater part of the day to himself, only, unfortunately, he had no way of turning his time profitably to account, or, at least, none had thus far occurred to him.  On the morning succeeding he was out of luck. He caught but two fish, and they were so small that he decided not to offer them for sale.  \"If I don't do better than this,\" he reflected, \"I shan't make very good wages. The fish seem to be getting afraid of me.\"  He paddled about, idly, a few rods from the shore, having drawn up his line and hook.  All at once, he heard a voice hailing him from the river bank:  \"Boat ahoy!\"  \"Hallo!\" answered Robert, lifting his eyes, and seeing who called him.  \"Can you set me across the river?\"  \"Yes, sir.\"  \"Bring in your boat, then, and I'll jump aboard. I'll pay you for your trouble.\"  Robert did as requested, with alacrity. He was very glad to earn money in this way, since it seemed he was to have no fish to dispose of. He quickly turned the boat to the shore, and the stranger jumped on board. He was a man of rather more than the average height, with a slight limp in his gait, in a rough suit of clothes, his head being surmounted by a felt hat considerably the worse for wear. There was a scar on one cheek, and, altogether, he was not very prepossessing in his appearance. Robert noted all this in a rapid glance, but it made no particular impression upon him at the moment. He cared very little how the stranger looked, as long as he "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9990"],["title","Brave and Bold; Or, The Fortunes of Robert Rushton (#6)"],["body","money enough to pay his fare.  \"It's about a mile across the river, isn't it?\" asked the stranger.  \"About that here. Where do you want to go?\"  \"Straight across. There's an old man named Nichols lives on the other side, isn't there?\"  \"Yes; he lives by himself.\"  \"Somebody told me so. He's rich, isn't he?\" asked the stranger, carelessly.  \"So people say; but he doesn't show it in his dress or way of living.\"  \"A miser, I suppose?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What does he do with his money?\"  \"I only know what people say.\"  \"And what do they say?\"  \"That he is afraid to trust banks, and hides his money in the earth.\"  \"That kind of bank don't pay very good interest,\" said the stranger, laughing.  \"No; but it isn't likely to break.\"  \"Here? boy, give me one of the oars. I'm used to rowing, and I'll help you a little.\"  Robert yielded one of the oars to his companion, who evidently understood rowing quite as well as he professed to. Our hero, though strong-armed, had hard work to keep up with him.  \"Look out, boy, or I'll turn you round,\" he said.  \"You are stronger than I am.\"  \"And more used to rowing; but I'll suit myself to you.\"  A few minutes brought them to the other shore. The passenger jumped ashore, first handing a silver half-dollar to our hero, who was well satisfied with his fee.  Robert sat idly in his boat, and watched his late fare as with rapid steps he left the river bank behind him.  \"He's going to the old man's house,\" decided Robert. \"I wonder whether he has any business with him?\"     CHAPTER VIII.   THE OLD FARMHOUSE.  The stranger walked, with hasty strides, in the direction of an old farmhouse, which could be seen a quarter of a mile away. Whether it had ever been painted, was a question not easily solved. At present it was dark and weather-beaten, and in a general state of neglect.  The owner, Paul Nichols, was a man advanced in years, living quite alone, and himself providing for his simple wants. Robert was right in calling him a miser, but he had not always deserved the name. The time was when he had been happily married to a good wife, and was blessed with two young children. But they were all taken from him in one week by an epidemic, and his life was made solitary and cheerless. This bereavement completely revolutionized his life. Up to this time he had been a good and respected citizen, with an interest in public affairs. Now he became morose and misanthropic, and his heart, bereaved of its legitimate objects of affection, henceforth was fixed upon gold, which he began to love with a passionate energy. He repulsed the advances of neighbors, and became what Robert called him--a miser.  How much he was worth, no one knew. The town assessors sought in vain for stocks and bonds. He did not appear to possess any. Probably popular opinion was correct in asserting that he secreted his money in one or many out-of-the-way places, which, from time to time, he was wont to visit and gloat over his treasures. There was reason also to believe that it was mostly in gold, for he had a habit of asking specie payments from those indebted to him, or, if he could not obtain specie, he used to go to a neighboring town with his bank notes and get the change effected.  Such was the man about whom Robert's unknown passenger exhibited so much curiosity, and whom it seemed that he was intending to visit.  \"I wonder whether the old man is at home!\" he said to himself, as he entered the front yard through a gateway, from which the gate had long since disappeared. \"He don't keep things looking very neat and trim, that's a fact,\" he continued, noticing the rank weeds and indiscriminate litter which filled the yard. \"Just give me this place, and his money to keep it, and I'd make a change in the looks of things pretty quick.\"  He stepped up to the front door, and, lifting the old-fashioned knocker, sounded a loud summons.  \"He'll hear that, if he isn't very deaf,\" he thought.  But the summons appeared to be without effect. At all events, he was left standing on the doorstone, and no one came to bid him enter.  \"He can't be at home, or else he won't come,\" thought the visitor. \"I'll try him again,\" and another knock, still louder than before, sounded through the farmhouse.  But still no one came to the door. The fact was, that the old farmer had gone away early, with a load of hay, which he had sold; to a stable-keeper living some five miles distant.  \"I'll reconnoiter a little,\" said the stranger.  He stepped to the front window, and looked in. All that met his gaze was a bare, dismantled room.  \"Not very cheerful, that's a fact,\" commented the outsider. \"Well, he don't appear to be here; I'll go round to the back part of the house.\"  He went round to the back door, where he thought it best, in the first place, to knock. No answer coming, he peered through the window, but saw no one.  \"The coast is clear,\" he concluded. \"So much the better, if I can get in.\"  The door proved to be locked, but the windows were easily raised. Through one of these he clambered into the kitchen, which was the only room occupied by the old farmer, with the exception of a room above, which he used as a bedchamber. Here he cooked and ate his meals, and here he spent his solitary evenings.  Jumping over the window sill, the visitor found himself in this room. He looked around him, with some curiosity.  \"It is eighteen years since I was last in this room,\" he said. \"Time hasn't improved it, nor me, either, very likely,\" he added, with a short laugh. \"I've roamed pretty much all over the world in that time, and I've come back as poor as I went away. What's that copy I used to write?--'A rolling stone gathers no moss.' Well, I'm the rolling stone. In all that time my Uncle Paul has been moored fast to his hearthstone, and been piling up gold, which he don't seem to have much use for. As far as I know, I'm his nearest relation, there's no reason why he shouldn't launch out a little for the benefit of the family.\"  It will be gathered from the foregoing soliloquy that the newcomer was a nephew of Paul Nichols. After a not very creditable youth, he had gone to sea, and for eighteen years this was his first reappearance in his native town.  He sat down in a chair, and stretched out his legs, with an air of being at home.  \"I wonder what the old man will say when he sees me,\" he soliloquized. \"Ten to one he won't know me. When we saw each other last I was a smooth-faced youth. Now I've got hair enough on my face, and the years have made, their mark upon me, I suspect. Where is he, I wonder, and how long have I got to wait for him? While I'm waiting, I'll take the liberty of looking in the closet, and seeing if he hasn't something to refresh the inner man. I didn't make much of a breakfast, and something hearty wouldn't come amiss.\"  He rose from his chair, and opened the closet door. A small collection of crockery was visible, most of it cracked, but there was nothing eatable to be seen, except half a loaf of bread. This was from the baker, for the old man, after ineffectual efforts to make his own bread, had been compelled to abandon the attempt, and patronize the baker.  \"Nothing but a half loaf, and that's dry enough,\" muttered the stranger. \"That isn't very tempting. I can't say much for my uncle's fare, unless he has got something more attractive somewhere.\"  But, search as carefully as he might, nothing better could be found, and his appetite was not sufficiently great to encourage an attack upon the stale loaf. He sat down, rather discontented, and resumed the current of his reflections.  \"My uncle must be more of a miser than I thought, if he stints himself to such fare as this. It's rather a bad lookout for me. He won't be very apt to look with favor on my application for a small loan from his treasure. What's that the boy said? He don't trust any banks, but keeps his money concealed in the earth. By Jove! It would be a stroke of luck if I could stumble on one of his hiding places! If I could do that while he was away, I would forego the pleasure of seeing him, and make off with what I could find. I'll look about me, and see if I can't find some of his hidden hoards.\"  No sooner did the thought occur to him than he acted upon it.  \"Let me see,\" he reflected, \"where is he most likely to hide his treasure? Old stockings are the favorites with old maids and widows, but I don't believe Uncle Paul has got any without holes in them. He's more likely to hide his gold under the hearth. That's a good idea, I'll try the hearth first.\"  He kneeled down, and began to examine the bricks, critically, with a view of ascertaining whether any bore the marks of having been removed recently, for he judged correctly that a miser would wish, from time to time, to unearth his treasure for the pleasure of looking at it. But there was no indication of disturbance. The hearth bore a uniform appearance, and did not seem to have been tampered with.  \"That isn't the right spot,\" reflected the visitor. \"Perhaps there's a plank in the floor that raises, or, still more likely, the gold is buried in the cellar. I've a great mind to go down there.\"  He lit a candle, and went cautiously down the rickety staircase. But he had hardly reached the bottom of the stairs, when he caught the sound of a wagon entering the yard.  \"That must be my uncle,\" he said. \"I'd better go up, and not let him catch me down here.\"  He ascended the stairs, and re-entered the room just as the farmer opened the door and entered.  On seeing a tall, bearded stranger, whom he did not recognize, standing before him in his own kitchen, with a lighted candle in his hand, Paul Nichols uttered a shrill cry of alarm, and ejaculated:  \"Thieves! Murder! Robbers!\" in a quavering voice.     CHAPTER IX.   THE UNWELCOME GUEST.  The stranger was in rather an awkward predicament. However, he betrayed neither embarrassment nor alarm. Blowing out the candle, he advanced to the table and set it down. This movement brought"]]]
