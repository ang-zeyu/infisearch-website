How do I know what the old man really wanted?\"  Pratt drew his chair still nearer to the desk. His voice dropped to a whisper and his eyes were full of meaning.  \"I'll tell you what he wanted!\" he said speaking very slowly. \"It's what I've come for. Listen! Antony Bartle came to our office soon after five yesterday afternoon. I was alone--everybody else had gone. I took him into Eldrick's room. He told me that in turning over one of the books which he had bought from Mallathorpe Mill, some short time ago, he had found--what do you think?\"  Mrs. Mallathorpe's cheek had flushed at the mention of the books from the Mill. Now, at Pratt's question, and under his searching eye, she turned very pale, and the clerk saw her fingers tighten on the arms of her chair.  \"What?\" she asked. \"What?\"  \"John Mallathorpe's will!\" he answered. \"Do you understand? His--will!\"  The woman glanced quickly about her--at the doors, the uncurtained window.  \"Safe enough here,\" whispered Pratt. \"I made sure of that. Don't be afraid--no one knows--but me.\"  But Mrs. Mallathorpe seemed to find some difficulty in speaking, and when she at last got out a word her voice sounded hoarse.  \"Impossible!\"  \"It's a fact!\" said Pratt. \"Nothing was ever more a fact as you'll see. But let me finish my story. The old man told me how he'd found the will--only half an hour before--and he asked me to ring up Eldrick, so that we might all read it together. I went to the telephone--when I came back, Bartle was dead--just dead. And--I took the will out of his pocket.\"  Mrs. Mallathorpe made an involuntary gesture with her right hand. And Pratt smiled, craftily, and shook his head.  \"Much too valuable to carry about, Mrs. Mallathorpe,\" he said. \"I've got it--all safe--under lock and key. But as I've said--nobody knows of it but myself. Not a living soul. No one has any idea! No one can have any idea. I was a bit alarmed when I heard that young Collingwood had been to you, for I thought that the old man, though he didn't tell me of any such thing, might have dropped you a line saying what he'd found. But as he didn't--well, not one living soul knows that the will's in existence, except me--and you!\"  Mrs. Mallathorpe was regaining her self-possession. She had had a great shock, but the worst of it was over. Already she knew, from Pratt's manner, insidious and suggesting, that the will was of a nature that would dispossess her and hers of this recently acquired wealth--the clerk had made that evident by look and tone. So--there was nothing but to face things.  \"What--what does it--say?\" she asked, with an effort.  Pratt unbuttoned his overcoat, plunged a hand into the inner pocket, drew out a sheet of paper, unfolded it and laid it on the desk.  \"An exact copy,\" he said tersely. \"Read it for yourself.\"  In spite of the determined effort which she made to be calm, Mrs. Mallathorpe's fingers still trembled as she took up the sheet on which Pratt had made a fair copy of the will. The clerk watched her narrowly as she read. He knew that presently there would be a tussle between them: he knew, too, that she was a woman who would fight hard in defence of her own interest, and for the interests of her children.  Always keeping his ears open to local gossip, especially where money was concerned, Pratt had long since heard that Mrs. Mallathorpe was a keen and sharp business woman. And now he was not surprised when, having slowly and carefully read the copy of the will from beginning to end, she laid it down, and turned to him with a business-like question.  \"The effect of that?\" she asked. \"What would it be--curtly?\"  \"Precisely what it says,\" answered Pratt. \"Couldn't be clearer!\"  \"We--should lose all?\" she demanded, almost angrily. \"All?\"  \"All--except what he says--there,\" agreed Pratt.  \"And that,\" she went on, drumming her fingers on the paper, \"that--would stand?\"  \"What it's a copy of would stand,\" said Pratt. \"Oh, yes, don't you make any mistake about it, Mrs. Mallathorpe! Nothing can upset that will. It is plain as a pikestaff how it came to be made. Your late brother-in-law evidently wrote his will out--it's all in his own handwriting--and took it down to the Mill with him the very day of the chimney accident. Just as evidently he signed it in the presence of his manager, Gaukrodger, and his cashier, Marshall--they signed at the same time, as it says, there. Now I take it that very soon after that, Mr. Mallathorpe went out into his mill yard to have a look at the chimney--Gaukrodger and Marshall went with him. Before he went, he popped the will into the book, where old Bartle found it yesterday--such things are easily done. Perhaps he was reading the book--perhaps it lay handy--he slipped the will inside, anyway. And then--he was killed--and, what's more the two witnesses were killed with him. So there wasn't a man left who could tell of that will! But--there's half Barford could testify to these three signatures! Mrs. Mallathorpe, there's not a chance for you if I put that will into the hands of the two trustees!\"  He leaned back in his chair after that--nodding confidently, watching keenly. And now he saw that the trembling fingers were interlacing each other, twisting the rings on each other, and that Mrs. Mallathorpe was thinking as she had most likely never thought in her life. After a moment's pause Pratt went on. \"Perhaps you didn't understand,\" he said. \"I mean, you don't know the effect. Those two trustees--Charlesworth & Wyatt--could turn you all clean out of this--tomorrow, in a way of speaking. Everything's theirs! They can demand an account of every penny that you've all had out of the estate and the business--from the time you all took hold. If anything's been saved, put aside, they can demand that. You're entitled to nothing but the three amounts of ten thousand each. Of course, thirty thousand is thirty thousand--it means, at five per cent., fifteen hundred a year--if you could get five per cent. safely. But--I should say your son and daughter are getting a few thousand a year each, aren't they, Mrs. Mallathorpe? It would be a nice come-down! Five hundred a year apiece--at the outside. A small house instead of Normandale Grange. Genteel poverty--comparatively speaking--instead of riches. That is--if I hand over the will to Charlesworth & Wyatt.\"  Mrs. Mallathorpe slowly turned her eyes on Pratt. And Pratt suddenly felt a little afraid--there was anger in those eyes; anger of a curious sort. It might be against fate--against circumstance: it might not--why should it?--be against him personally, but it was there, and it was malign and almost evil, and it made him uncomfortable.  \"Where is the will!\" she asked.  \"Safe! In my keeping,\" answered Pratt.  She looked him all over--surmisingly.  \"You'll sell it to me?\" she suggested. \"You'll hand it over--and let me burn it--destroy it?\"  \"No!\" answered Pratt. \"I shall not!\"  He saw that his answer produced personal anger at last. Mrs. Mallathorpe gave him a look which would have warned a much less observant man than Pratt. But he gave her back a look that was just as resolute.  \"I say no--and I mean no!\" he continued. \"I won't sell--but I'll bargain. Let's be plain with each other. You don't want that will to be handed over to the trustees named in it, Charlesworth & Wyatt?\"  \"Do you think I'm a fool--man!\" she flashed out.  \"I should be a fool myself if I did,\" replied Pratt calmly. \"And I'm not a fool. Very well--then you'll square me. You'll buy me. Come to terms with me, and nobody shall ever know. I repeat to you what I've said before--not a soul knows now, no nor suspects! It's utterly impossible for anybody to find out. The testator's dead. The attesting witnesses are dead. The man who found this will is dead. No one but you and myself ever need know a word about all this. If--you make terms with me, Mrs. Mallathorpe.\"  \"What do you want?\" she asked sullenly. \"You forget--I've nothing of my own. I didn't come into anything.\"  \"I've a pretty good notion who's real master here--and at Mallathorpe Mill, too,\" retorted Pratt. \"I should say you're still in full control of your children, Mrs. Mallathorpe, and that you can do pretty well what you like with them.\"  \"With one of them perhaps,\" she said, still angry and sullen. \"But--I tell you, for you may as well know--if my daughter knew of what you've told me, she'd go straight to these trustees and tell! That's a fact that you'd better realize. I can't control her.\"  \"Oh!\" remarked Pratt. \"Um!--then we must take care that she doesn't know. But we don't intend that anybody should know but you and me, Mrs. Mallathorpe. You needn't tell a soul--not even your son. You mustn't tell! Listen, now--I've thought out a good scheme which'll profit me, and make you safe. Do you know what you want on this estate?\"  She stared at him as if wondering what this question had to do with the matter which was of such infinite importance. And Pratt smiled, and hastened to enlighten her.  \"You want--a steward,\" he said. \"A steward and estate agent. John Mallathorpe managed everything for himself, but your son can't, and pardon me if I say that you can't--properly. You need a man--you need me. You can persuade your son to that effect. Give me the job of steward here. I'll suggest to you how to do it in such a fashion that it'll arouse no suspicion, and look just like an ordinary--very ordinary--business job--at a salary and on conditions to be arranged, and--you're safe! Safe, Mrs. Mallathorpe--you know what that means!\"  Mrs. Mallathorpe suddenly rose from her chair.  \"I know this!\" she said. \"I'll discuss nothing, and do nothing, till I've seen that will!\"  Pratt rose, too, nodding his head as if quite satisfied. He took up the copy, tore "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9834"],["title","The Talleyrand Maxim (#8)"],["body","in two pieces, and carefully dropped them into the glowing fire.  \"I shall be at my lodgings at any time after five-thirty tomorrow evening,\" he answered quietly. \"Call there. You have the address. And you can then read the will with your own eyes. I shan't bring it here. The game's in my hands, Mrs. Mallathorpe.\"  Within a few minutes he was out in the park again, and making his way to the little railway station in the valley below. He felt triumphant--he knew that the woman he had just left was at his mercy and would accede to his terms. And all the way back to town, and through the town to his lodgings, he considered and perfected the scheme he was going to suggest to Mrs. Mallathorpe on the morrow.  Pratt lived in a little hamlet of old houses on the very outskirts of Barford--on the edge of a stretch of Country honeycombed by stone-quarries, some in use, some already worked out. It was a lonely neighbourhood, approached from the nearest tramway route by a narrow, high-walled lane. He was half-way along that lane when a stealthy foot stole to his side, and a hand was laid on his arm--just as stealthily came the voice of one of his fellow-clerks at Eldrick & Pascoe's.  \"A moment, Pratt! I've been waiting for you. I want--a word or two--in private!\"     CHAPTER VI   THE UNEXPECTED   Pratt started when he heard that voice and felt the arresting hand. He knew well enough to whom they belonged--they were those of one James Parrawhite, a little, weedy, dissolute chap who had been in Eldrick & Pascoe's employ for about a year. It had always been a mystery to him and the other clerks that Parrawhite had been there at all, and that being there he was allowed to stop. He was not a Barford man. Nobody knew anything whatever about him, though his occasional references to it seemed to indicate that he knew London pretty thoroughly. Pratt shrewdly suspected that he was a man whom Eldrick had known in other days, possibly a solicitor who had been struck off the rolls, and to whom Eldrick, for old times' sake, was disposed to extend a helping hand.  All that any of them knew was that one morning some fifteen months previously, Parrawhite, a complete stranger, had walked into the office, asked to see Eldrick, had remained closeted with him half an hour, and had been given a job at two pounds a week, there and then. That he was a clever and useful clerk no one denied, but no one liked him.  He was always borrowing half-crowns. He smelt of rum. He was altogether undesirable. It was plain to the clerks that Pascoe disliked him. But he was evidently under Eldrick's protection, and he did his work and did it well, and there was no doubt that he knew more law than either of the partners, and was better up in practice than Pratt himself. But--he was not desirable  ... and Pratt never desired him less than on this occasion.  \"What are you after--coming on a man like that!\" growled Pratt.  \"You,\" replied Parrawhite. \"I knew you'd got to come up this lane, so I waited for you. I've something to say.\"  \"Get it said, then!\" retorted Pratt.  \"Not here,\" answered Parrawhite. \"Come down by the quarry--nobody about there.\"  \"And suppose I don't?\" asked Pratt.  \"Then you'll be very sorry for yourself--tomorrow,\" replied Parrawhite. \"That's all!\"  Pratt had already realized that this fellow knew something. Parrawhite's manner was not only threatening but confident. He spoke as a man speaks who has got the whip hand. And so, still growling, and inwardly raging and anxious, he turned off with his companion into a track which lay amongst the stone quarries. It was a desolate, lonely place; no house was near; they were as much alone as if they had been in the middle of one of the great moors outside the town, the lights of which they could see in the valley below them. In the grey sky above, a waning moon gave them just sufficient light to see their immediate surroundings--a grass-covered track, no longer used, and the yawning mouths of the old quarries, no longer worked, the edges of which were thick with gorse and bramble. It was the very place for secret work, and Pratt was certain that secret work was at hand.  \"Now then!\" he said, when they had walked well into the wilderness. \"What is it? And no nonsense!\"  \"You'll get no nonsense from me,\" sneered Parrawhite. \"I'm not that sort. This is what I want to say. I was in Eldrick's office last night all the time you were there with old Bartle.\"  This swift answer went straight through Pratt's defences. He was prepared to hear something unpleasant and disconcerting, but not that. And he voiced the first thought that occurred to him.  \"That's a lie!\" he exclaimed. \"There was nobody there!\"  \"No lie,\" replied Parrawhite. \"I was there. I was behind the curtain of that recess--you know. And since I know what you did, I don't mind telling you--we're in the same boat, my lad!--what I was going to do. You thought I'd gone--with the others. But I hadn't. I'd merely done what I've done several times without being found out--slipped in there--to wait until you'd gone. Why? Because friend Eldrick, as you know, is culpably careless about leaving loose cash in the unlocked drawer of his desk, culpably careless, too, about never counting it. And--a stray sovereign or half-sovereign is useful to a man who only gets two quid a week. Understand?\"  \"So you're a thief?\" said Pratt bitterly.  \"I'm precisely what you are--a thief!\" retorted Parrawhite. \"You stole John Mallathorpe's will last night. I heard everything, I tell you!--and saw everything. I heard the whole business--what the old man said--what you, later, said to Eldrick. I saw old Bartle die--I saw you take the will from his pocket, read it, and put it in your pocket. I know all!--except the terms of the will. But--I've a pretty good idea of what those terms are. Do you know why? Because I watched you set off to Normandale by the eight-twenty train tonight!\"  \"Hang you for a dirty sneak!\" growled Pratt.  Parrawhite laughed, and flourished a heavy stick which he carried.  \"Not a bit of it!\" he said, almost pleasantly. \"I thought you were more of a philosopher--I fancied I'd seen gleams--mere gleams--of philosophy in you at times. Fortunes of war, my boy! Come now--you've seen enough of me to know I'm an adventurer. This is an adventure of the sort I love. Go into it heart and soul, man! Own up!--you've found out that the will leaves the property away from the present holders, and you've been to Normandale to--bargain? Come, now!\"  \"What then!\" demanded Pratt.  \"Then, of course, I come in at the bargaining,\" answered Parrawhite. \"I'm going to have my share. That's a certainty. You'd better take my advice. Because you're absolutely in my power. I've nothing to do but to tell Eldrick tomorrow morning.\"  \"Suppose I tell Eldrick tomorrow morning of what you've told me?\" interjected Pratt.  \"Eldrick will believe me before you,\" retorted Parrawhite, imperturbably. \"I'm a much cleverer, more plausible man than you are, my friend--I've had an experience of the world which you haven't, I can easily invent a fine excuse for being in that room. For two pins I'll incriminate you! See? Be reasonable--for if it comes to a contest of brains, you haven't a rabbit's chance against a fox. Tell me all about the will--and what you've done. You've got to--for, by the Lord Harry!--I'm going to have my share. Come, now!\"  Pratt stood, in a little hollow wherein they had paused, and thought, rapidly and angrily. There was no doubt about it--he was trapped. This fearful scoundrel at his side, who boasted of his cleverness, would stick to him like a leach--he would have to share. All his own smart schemes for exploiting Mrs. Mallathorpe, for ensuring himself a competence for life, were knocked on the head. There was no helping it--he would have to tell--and to share. And so, sullenly, resentfully, he told.  Parrawhite listened in silence, taking in every point. Pratt, knowing that concealment was useless, told the truth about everything, concisely, but omitting nothing.  \"All right!\" remarked Parrawhite at the end, \"Now, then, what terms do you mean to insist on?\"  \"What's the good of going into that?\" growled Pratt. \"Now that you've stuck your foot in it, what do my terms matter?\"  \"Quite right,\" agreed Parrawhite, \"They don't. What matter is--our terms. Now let me suggest--no, insist on--what they must be. Cash! Do you know why I insist on that? No? Then I'll tell you. Because this young barrister chap, Collingwood, has evidently got some suspicion of--something.\"  \"I can't see it,\" said Pratt uneasily. \"He was only curious to know what that letter was about.\"  \"Never mind,\" continued Parrawhite. \"He had some suspicion--or he wouldn't have gone out there almost as soon as he reached Barford after his grandfather's death. And even if suspicion is put to sleep for awhile, it can easily be reawakened, so--cash! We must profit at once--before any future risk arises. But--what terms were you thinking of?\"  \"Stewardship of this estate for life,\" muttered Pratt gloomily.  \"With the risk of some discovery being made, some time, any time!\" sneered Parrawhite. \"Where are your brains, man? The old fellow, John Mallathorpe, probably made a draft or two of that will before he did his fair copy--he may have left those drafts among his papers.\"  \"If he did, Mrs. Mallathorpe 'ud find 'em,\" said Pratt slowly. \"I don't believe there's the slightest risk. I've figured everything out. I don't believe there's any danger from Collingwood or from anybody--it's impossible! And if we take cash now--we're selling for a penny what we ought to get pounds for.\"  \"The present is much more important than the future, my friend,\" answered Parrawhite. \"To me, at any rate. Now, then, this is my proposal. I'll be with you when this lady calls at your place tomorrow evening. We'll offer her the will, to do what she likes with, for ten thousand pounds. She can find that--quickly. When she pays--as she will!--we "]]]
