Le' me go!\"  The Little Colonel proudly marched up with Mom Beck's contribution, and then watched the others pass down the aisle. One young girl in a gorgeously trimmed dress paraded up to the table several times, singing at the top of her voice.  \"Look at that good-fo'-nothin' Lize Richa'ds,\" whispered Mom Beck's nearest neighbour, with a sniff. \"She done got a nickel changed into pennies so she could ma'ch up an' show herself five times.\"  It was nearly sundown when they started home. A tall coloured man, wearing a high silk hat and carrying a gold-headed cane, joined them on the way out.  \"Howdy, Sistah Po'tah,\" he said, gravely shaking hands. \"That was a fine disco'se we had the pleasuah of listenin' to this evenin'.\"  \"'Deed it was, Brothah Fostah,\" she answered. \"How's all up yo' way?\"  The Little Colonel, running on after a couple of white butterflies, paid no attention to the conversation until she heard her own name mentioned.  \"Mistah Sherman came home last night, I heah.\"  \"Yes, but not to stay long, I'm afraid. He's a mighty sick man, if I'm any judge. He's down with fevah,--regulah typhoid. He doesn't look to me like he's long for this world. What's to become of poah Miss 'Lizabeth if that's the case, is moah'n I know.\" \"We mustn't cross the bridge till we come to it, Sistah Po'tah,\" he suggested.  \"I know that; but a lookin'-glass broke yeste'day mawnin' when nobody had put fingah on it. An' his picture fell down off the wall while I was sweepin' the pa'lah. Pete said his dawg done howl all night last night, an' I've dremp three times hand runnin' 'bout muddy watah.\"  Mom Beck felt a little hand clutch her skirts, and turned to see a frightened little face looking anxiously up at her.  \"Now, what's the mattah with you, honey?\" she asked. \"I'm only a-tellin' Mistah Fostah about some silly old signs my mammy used to believe in. But they don't mean nothin' at all.\"  Lloyd couldn't have told why she was unhappy. She had not understood all that Mom Beck had said, but her sensitive little mind was shadowed by a foreboding of trouble.  The shadow deepened as the days passed. Papa Jack got worse instead of better. There were times when he did not recognize any one, and talked wildly of things that had happened out at the mines.  All the long, beautiful October went by, and still he lay in the darkened room. Lloyd wandered listlessly from place to place, trying to keep out of the way, and to make as little trouble as possible.  \"I'm a real little woman now,\" she repeated, proudly, whenever she was allowed to pound ice or carry fresh water. \"I'm papa's little comfort.\"  One cold, frosty evening she was standing in the hall, when the doctor came out of the room and began to put on his overcoat.  Her mother followed him to take his directions for the night.  He was an old friend of the family's. Elizabeth had climbed on his knees many a time when she was a child. She loved this faithful, white-haired old doctor almost as dearly as she had her father.  \"My daughter,\" he said, kindly, laying his hand on her shoulder, \"you are wearing yourself out, and will be down yourself if you are not careful. You must have a professional nurse. No telling how long this is going to last. As soon as Jack is able to travel you must have a change of climate.\"  Her lips trembled. \"We can't afford it, doctor,\" she said. \"Jack has been too sick from the very first to talk about business. He always said a woman should not be worried with such matters, anyway. I don't know what arrangements he has made out West. For all I know, the little I have in my purse now may be all that stands between us and the poorhouse.\"  The doctor drew on his gloves.  \"Why don't you tell your father how matters are?\" he asked.  Then he saw he had ventured a step too far.  \"I believe Jack would rather die than take help from his hands,\" she answered, drawing herself up proudly. Her eyes flashed. \"I would, too, as far as I am concerned myself.\"  Then a tender look came over her pale, tired face, as she added, gently, \"But I'd do anything on earth to help Jack get well.\"  The doctor cleared his throat vigorously, and bolted out with a gruff good night. As he rode past Locust, he took solid satisfaction in shaking his fist at the light in an upper window.     CHAPTER VI.   The Little Colonel followed her mother to the dining-room, but paused on the threshold as she saw her throw herself into Mom Beck's arms and burst out crying.  \"Oh, Becky!\" she sobbed, \"what is going to become of us? The doctor says we must have a professional nurse, and we must go away from here soon. There are only a few dollars left in my purse, and I don't know what we'll do when they are gone. I just know Jack is going to die, and then I'll die, too, and then what will become of the baby?\" Mom Beck sat down, and took the trembling form in her arms.  \"There, there!\" she said, soothingly, \"have yo' cry out. It will do you good. Poah chile! all wo'n out with watchin' an' worry. Ne'm min', ole Becky is as good as a dozen nuhses yet. I'll get Judy to come up an' look aftah the kitchen. An' nobody ain' gwine to die, honey. Don't you go to slayin' all you's got befo' you's called on to do it. The good Lawd is goin' to pahvide fo' us same as Abraham.\"  The last Sabbath's sermon was still fresh in her mind.  \"If we only hold out faithful, there's boun' to be a ram caught by the hawns some place, even if we haven't got eyes to see through the thickets. The Lawd will pahvide whethah it's a burnt offerin' or a meal's vittles. He sho'ly will.\" Lloyd crept away frightened. It seemed such an awful thing to see her mother cry.  All at once her bright, happy world had changed to such a strange, uncertain place. She felt as if all sorts of terrible things were about to happen.  She went into the parlour, and crawled into a dark corner under the piano, feeling that there was no place to go for comfort, since the one who had always kissed away her little troubles was so heart-broken herself.  There was a patter of soft feet across the carpet, and Fritz poked his sympathetic nose into her face. She put her arms around him, and laid her head against his curly back with a desolate sob.  It is pitiful to think how much imaginative children suffer through their wrong conception of things. She had seen the little roll of bills in her mother's pocketbook. She had seen how much smaller it grew every time it was taken out to pay for the expensive wines and medicines that had to be bought so often. She had heard her mother tell the doctor that was all that stood between them and the poorhouse.  There was no word known to the Little Colonel that brought such, thoughts of horror as the word poorhouse.  Her most vivid recollection of her life in New York was something that happened a few weeks before they left there. One day in the park she ran away from the maid, who, instead of Mom Beck, had taken charge of her that afternoon.  When the angry woman found her, she frightened her almost into a spasm by telling her what always happened to naughty children who ran away.  \"They take all their pretty clothes off,\" she said, \"and dress them up in old things made of bed-ticking. Then they take 'm to the poorhouse, where nobody but beggars live. They don't have anything to eat but cabbage and corndodger, and they have to eat that out of tin pans. And they just have a pile of straw to sleep in.\"  On their way home she had pointed out to the frightened child a poor woman who was grubbing in an ash-barrel.  \"That's the way people get to look who live in poorhouses,\" she said.  It was this memory that was troubling the Little Colonel now.  \"Oh, Fritz!\" she whispered, with the tears running down her cheeks, \"I can't beah to think of my pretty mothah goin' there. That woman's eyes were all red, an' her hair was jus' awful. She was so bony an' stahved-lookin'. It would jus' kill poah Papa Jack to lie on straw an' eat out of a tin pan. I know it would!\"  When Mom Beck opened the door, hunting her, the room was so dark that she would have gone away if the dog had not come running out from under the piano.  \"You heah, too, chile?\" she asked, in surprise. \"I have to go down now an' see if I can get Judy to come help to-morrow. Do you think you can undress yo'self to-night?\"  \"Of co'se,\" answered the Little Colonel. Mom Beck was in such a hurry to be off that she did not notice the tremble in the voice that answered her.  \"Well, the can'le is lit in yo' room. So run along now like a nice little lady, an' don't bothah yo' mamma. She got her hands full already.\"  \"All right,\" answered the child.  A quarter of an hour later she stood in her little white nightgown with her hand on the door-knob.  She opened the door just a crack and peeped in. Her mother laid her finger on her lips, and beckoned silently. In another instant Lloyd was in her lap. She had cried herself quiet in the dark corner under the piano; but there was something more pathetic in her eyes than tears. It was the expression of one who understood and sympathized.  \"Oh, mothah,\" she whispered, \"we does have such lots of troubles.\"  \"Yes, chickabiddy, but I hope they will soon be over now,\" was the answer, as the anxious face tried to smile bravely for the child's sake, \"Papa is sleeping so nicely now he is sure to be better in the morning.\"  That comforted the Little Colonel some, but for days she was haunted by the fear of the poorhouse.  Every time her mother paid out any money she looked anxiously to see how much was still left. She wandered about the place, touching the trees and vines with caressing hands, feeling that she might soon have to leave them.  She loved them all so dearly,--every stick and stone, and even the stubby old snowball bushes that never bloomed.  Her dresses were outgrown and faded, but no one had any time or thought to spend on getting her new ones. A little hole began to come in the toe of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9407"],["title","The Little Colonel (#6)"],["body","shoe.  She was still wearing her summer sunbonnet, although the days were getting frosty.  She was a proud little thing. It mortified her for any one to see her looking so shabby. Still she uttered no word of complaint, for fear of lessening the little amount in the pocketbook that her mother had said stood between them and the poorhouse.  She sat with her feet tucked under her when any one called.  \"I wouldn't mind bein' a little beggah so much myself,\" she thought, \"but I jus' can't have my bu'ful sweet mothah lookin' like that awful red-eyed woman.\"  One day the doctor called Mrs. Sherman out into the hall. \"I have just come from your father's,\" he said. \"He is suffering from a severe attack of rheumatism. He is confined to his room, and is positively starving for company. He told me he would give anything in the world to have his little grandchild with him. There were tears in his eyes when he said it, and that means a good deal from him. He fairly idolizes her. The servants have told him she mopes around and is getting thin and pale. He is afraid she will come down with the fever, too. He told me to use any stratagem I liked to get her there. But I think it's better to tell you frankly how matters stand. It will do the child good to have a change, Elizabeth, and I solemnly think you ought to let her go, for a week at least.\"  \"But, doctor, she has never been away from me a single night in her life. She'd die of homesickness, and I know she'll never consent to leave me. Then suppose Jack should get worse--\"  \"We'll suppose nothing of the kind,\" he interrupted, brusquely. \"Tell Becky to pack up her things. Leave Lloyd to me. I'll get her consent without any trouble.\"  \"Come, Colonel,\" he called, as he left the house. \"I'm going to take you a little ride.\"  No one ever knew what the kind old fellow said to her to induce her to go to her grandfather's.  She came back from her ride looking brighter than she had in a long time. She felt that in some way, although in what way she could not understand, her going would help them to escape the dreaded poorhouse.  \"Don't send Mom Beck with me,\" she pleaded, when the time came to start. \"You come with me, mothah.\"  Mrs. Sherman had not been past the gate for weeks, but she could not refuse the coaxing hands that clung to hers.  It was a dull, dreary day. There was a chilling hint of snow in the damp air. The leaves whirled past them with a mournful rustling.  Mrs. Sherman turned up the collar of Lloyd's cloak.  \"You must have a new one soon,\" she said, with a sigh. \"Maybe one of mine could be made over for you. And those poor little shoes! I must think to send to town for a new pair.\"  The walk was over so soon. The Little Colonel's heart beat fast as they came in sight of the gate. She winked bravely to keep back the tears; for she had promised the doctor not to let her mother see her cry.  A week seemed such a long time to look forward to.  She clung to her mother's neck, feeling that she could never give her up so long.  \"Tell me good-bye, baby dear,\" said Mrs. Sherman, feeling that she could not trust herself to stay much longer. \"It is too cold for you to stand here. Run on, and I'll watch you till you get inside the door.\"  The Little Colonel started bravely down the avenue, with Fritz at her heels. Every few steps she turned to look back and kiss her hand.  Mrs. Sherman watched her through a blur of tears. It had been nearly seven years since she had last stood at that old gate. Such a crowd of memories came rushing up!  She looked again. There was a flutter of a white handkerchief as the Little Colonel and Fritz went up the steps. Then the great front door closed behind them.     CHAPTER VII.   That early twilight hour just before the lamps were lit was the lonesomest one the Little Colonel had ever spent.  Her grandfather was asleep up-stairs. There was a cheery wood fire crackling on the hearth of the big fireplace in the hall, but the great house was so still. The corners were full of shadows.  She opened the front door with a wild longing to run away.  \"Come, Fritz,\" she said, closing the door softly behind her, \"let's go down to the gate.\"  The air was cold. She shivered as they raced along under the bare branches of the locusts. She leaned against the gate, peering out through the bars. The road stretched white through the gathering darkness in the direction of the little cottage.  \"Oh, I want to go home so bad!\" she sobbed. \"I want to see my mothah.\"  She laid her hand irresolutely on the latch, pushed the gate ajar, and then hesitated.  \"No, I promised the doctah I'd stay,\" she thought. \"He said I could help mothah and Papa Jack, both of 'em, by stayin' heah, an' I'll do it.\"  Fritz, who had pushed himself through the partly opened gate to rustle around among the dead leaves outside, came bounding back with something in his mouth.  \"Heah, suh!\" she called. \"Give it to me!\" He dropped a small gray kid glove in her outstretched hand. \"Oh, it's mothah's!\" she cried. \"I reckon she dropped it when she was tellin' me good-bye. Oh, you deah old dog fo' findin' it.\"  She laid the glove against her cheek as fondly as if it had been her mother's soft hand. There was something wonderfully comforting in the touch.  As they walked slowly back toward the house she rolled it up and put it lovingly away in her tiny apron pocket.  All that week it was a talisman whose touch helped the homesick little soul to be brave and womanly.  When Maria, the coloured housekeeper, went into the hall to light the lamps, the Little Colonel was sitting on the big fur rug in front of the fire, talking contentedly to Fritz, who lay with his curly head in her lap.  \"You all's goin' to have tea in the Cun'ls room to-night,\" said Maria. \"He tole me to tote it up soon as he rung the bell.\"  \"There it goes now,\" cried the child, jumping up from the rug.  She followed Maria up the wide stairs. The Colonel was sitting in a large easy chair, wrapped in a gaily flowered dressing-gown, that made his hair look unusually white by contrast.  His dark eyes were intently watching the door. As it opened to let the Little Colonel pass through, a very tender smile lighted up his stern face.  \"So you did come to see grandpa after all,\" he cried, triumphantly. \"Come here and give me a kiss. Seems to me you've been staying away a mighty long time.\"  As she stood beside him with his arm around her, Walker came in with a tray full of dishes. \"We're going to have a regular little tea-party,\" said the Colonel.  Lloyd watched with sparkling eyes as Walker set out the rare old-fashioned dishes. There was a fat little silver sugar-bowl with a butterfly perched on each side to form the handles, and there was a slim, graceful cream-pitcher shaped like a lily.  \"They belonged to your great-great-grandmother,\" said the Colonel, \"and they're going to be yours some day if you grow up and have a house of your own.\"  The expression on her beaming face was worth a fortune to the Colonel.  When Walker pushed her chair up to the table, she turned to her grandfather with shining eyes.  \"Oh, it's just like a pink story,\" she cried, clapping her hands. \"The shades on the can'les, the icin' on the cake, an' the posies in the bowl,--why, even the jelly is that colah, too. Oh, my darlin' little teacup! It's jus' like a pink rosebud. I'm so glad I came!\"  The Colonel smiled at the success of his plan. In the depths of his satisfaction he even had a plate of quail and toast set down on the hearth for Fritz.  \"This is the nicest pahty I evah was at,\" remarked the Little Colonel, as Walker helped her to jam the third time.  Her grandfather chuckled.  \"Blackberry jam always makes me think of Tom,\" he said. \"Did you ever hear what your Uncle Tom did when he was a little fellow in dresses?\"  She shook her head gravely.  \"Well, the children were all playing hide-and-seek one day. They hunted high and they hunted low after everybody else had been caught, but they couldn't find Tom. At last they began to call, 'Home free! You can come home free!' but he did not come. When he had been hidden so long they were frightened about him, they went to their mother and told her he wasn't to be found anywhere. She looked down the well and behind the fire-boards in the fireplaces. They called and called till they were out of breath. Finally she thought of looking in the big dark pantry where she kept her fruit. There stood Mister Tom. He had opened a jar of blackberry jam, and was just going for it with both hands. The jam was all over his face and hair and little gingham apron, and even up his wrists. He was the funniest sight I ever saw.\"  The Little Colonel laughed heartily at his description, and begged for more stories. Before he knew it he was back in the past with his little Tom and Elizabeth.  Nothing could have entertained the child more than these scenes he recalled of her mother's childhood.  \"All her old playthings are up in the garret,\" he said, as they rose from the table. \"I'll have them brought down to-morrow. There's a doll I brought her from New Orleans once when she was about your size. No telling what it looks like now, but it was a beauty when it was new.\"  Lloyd clapped her hands and spun around the room like a top.  \"Oh, I'm so glad I came!\" she exclaimed for the third time. \"What did she call the doll, gran'fathah, do you remembah?\"  \"I never paid much attention to such things,\" he answered, \"but I do remember the name of this one, because she named it for her mother,--Amanthis.\"  \"Amanthis,\" repeated the child, dreamily, as she leaned against his knee. \"I think that is a lovely name, gran'fathah. I wish they had called me that.\" She repeated it softly several times. \"It sounds like the wind a-blowin' through white clovah, doesn't it?\"  \"It is a beautiful name to me, my child,\" answered the old man, laying his hand tenderly on her soft hair, \"but not so beautiful as the woman who bore it. She was the fairest flower of all"]]]
