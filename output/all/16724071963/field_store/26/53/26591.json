And that's one too many.\"  \"Ha! ha!\" laughed Jasper Jay. \"Yes! There's _one too many for you_. Sandy Chipmunk is _one too many for you_!\" And he flew away to tell the joke to every one.  You see, Rowdy had been so frightened when Sandy turned and bit his nose that he actually thought there must be at least seven chipmunks chasing him.  Though he boasted just as much afterwards, Rowdy Red-Squirrel never wanted to fight Sandy Chipmunk again.     XVII  CORN-PLANTING TIME   It was late in the spring. And Sandy Chipmunk couldn't help wishing it was late in the fall instead. The reason for that was this: He could find very little to eat anywhere in Pleasant Valley. It was too early for fruit or nuts. It was even too early for many insects. And it seemed to Sandy that all the insects flew much higher than they did when there were plenty of other things to eat.  At last Sandy chanced to see Mr. Crow in the woods one day. Mr. Crow was just about to fly somewhere. He seemed to be in a great hurry. In fact, he did not want to stop to talk--which was most unusual with him.  \"I can't chat with you to-day,\" Mr. Crow told Sandy. \"I have business to attend to. It's something I've been expecting for a long time. And I don't want to be late.\"  \"Where are you going?\" Sandy asked.  \"That--\" said Mr. Crow--\"that is something that doesn't concern you, young man.\" And then he flapped his way through the woods and out of sight.  Now, it happened that Sandy Chipmunk remembered at once what Uncle Jerry Chuck had said a few days before. Uncle Jerry had said that Mr. Crow had told him Farmer Green was about to plant corn. So Sandy guessed that Mr. Crow was going to the field where Farmer Green and his hired man were working.  \"I'll run over there and see what's going on!\" Sandy exclaimed. \"If they're planting corn I have just as much right to eat some as Mr. Crow has.\"  Of course, Mr. Crow reached the ploughed field long before Sandy Chipmunk. It took Mr. Crow no time at all to sail through the air and drop down at a good, safe distance from where Farmer Green and his hired man were planting corn. They had already planted several long rows. And Mr. Crow at once set to work to scratch up the yellow kernels and swallow them greedily.  He was enjoying his meal greatly when he caught sight of a small, striped person busily engaged in doing the very same thing. It was Sandy Chipmunk! And Mr. Crow hurried over to the row where Sandy was looking for corn.  \"What are you doing here?\" Mr. Crow asked angrily.  \"I might ask you the same question,\" Sandy answered.  \"You followed me--that's what you did!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. \"Of all the prying busybodies I know, you are certainly the worst. This is not your field; and I shall have to ask you to leave it at once.\"  \"Oh! I'll leave the field,\" said Sandy Chipmunk. \"I don't want the field. You can have _that_. All I want is some of the corn. There ought to be enough for both of us.\"  Mr. Crow muttered something about _impertinence_, which Sandy Chipmunk didn't understand. Then Mr. Crow said:  \"This corn belongs to Farmer Green. Just because I've come to help him, and because I've scratched up a few of the kernels to see if he's planting them properly, you seem to think I'm _eating corn_.\"  \"I certainly do,\" said Sandy Chipmunk.  \"Well, what an idea!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed.  Strange as it may seem, Farmer Green had the same idea that Sandy Chipmunk had. He happened to catch sight of old Mr. Crow. And pretty soon Johnnie Green came hurrying up the field, along the fence. He hoped Mr. Crow wouldn't see him.  But old Mr. Crow generally saw any one coming his way--especially if the person happened to have a gun on his shoulder.  \"I've important business over in the woods,\" he told Sandy Chipmunk suddenly. And he flew off in great haste.  So Sandy stayed and ate all the corn he wanted. He was so small and so nearly the same color as the ploughed field that Johnnie Green never saw him at all.  After that Mr. Crow would scarcely speak to Sandy for several days. He said that Sandy was a nuisance.  \"A person can't go anywhere without that Chipmunk boy following him,\" Mr. Crow complained. \"You know, I'm helping Farmer Green plant his corn. And Sandy Chipmunk followed me to the corn-patch. And what do you think? He actually began to _eat_ the corn! Now, who ever heard of such a thing?\"  But Mr. Crow fooled nobody but himself. Every one knew that he ate more of Farmer Green's corn than anybody else unless it was Farmer Green. And _he_ always waited until it was ripe.  The trouble with Mr. Crow was this: He didn't want any one but himself to visit the cornfield. He wanted all the corn for an old gentleman known as _Mr. Crow_.     XVIII  SANDY LIKES MILK   Sandy Chipmunk liked milk. He never knew it, though, until he chanced to come upon a saucerful which some one had set out on the big flat stone that served as the back doorstep of the farmhouse.  Sandy crept up and sniffed at the white liquid in the saucer. It smelled very good. So he tasted it. And it tasted so much better, even, than it smelled that he drank every drop of it.  Sandy was sitting on the big stone step, washing his face, when Farmer Green's cat leaped out of the doorway.  The cat was very angry. And it was no wonder, because Sandy Chipmunk had drunk her breakfast. She seemed to think that since Sandy had made away with her breakfast it would be only fair if she should make away with _him_.  [Illustration: Farmer Green's Cat Leaped Out of the Doorway]  But Sandy did not agree with her at all. Though he had washed only one side of his face, he jumped sideways off the step and ran and hid in the woodpile close by.  You might think he would have had to stay there a long time. For the old cat crouched down and watched the hole into which Sandy had crawled. She seemed to have made up her mind to wait there until Sandy came out of that hole again.  If she had waited for that to happen she would have been there yet. For Sandy crept through the woodpile, stole out the other side of it, and ran home.  He was glad to get away from the cat. But he was sorry there wasn't more of that delicious drink which he had found in the saucer.  Later that day Sandy told Fatty Coon what had happened.  \"I know what that was,\" Fatty Coon exclaimed. \"It was milk.\"  \"I wonder where Farmer Green gets it,\" Sandy said.  \"From the cows, of course!\" Fatty replied.  \"You don't say so!\" Sandy Chipmunk cried. \"I'm glad to know it.\" And he scampered off across the pasture, toward three of Farmer Green's cows which were chewing their cuds under the shade of a big maple tree.  When Sandy asked them if they would please give him some milk to drink two of the cows (they were the good-natured ones) only smiled at each other. But the third cow (a surly old creature with long, sharp horns) told him not to be silly.  Well, Sandy Chipmunk saw that he could get no milk there. And he was feeling quite downcast when he chanced to meet Henry Skunk, to whom he told his troubles.  \"Of course the cows couldn't give you any milk!\" Henry Skunk said. \"It's not milking time yet. So what could they do? You go down to the barnyard late this afternoon and you'll find all the milk you could drink in a thousand years.\"  Sandy Chipmunk thanked him. And somehow he managed to wait until the afternoon was almost gone. Then he skipped down the hill to Farmer Green's barn. He thought it must be milking time, because Johnnie Green and old dog Spot had driven all the cows home.     XIX  WHAT THE OLD COW DID   When Sandy Chipmunk reached Farmer Green's barn he crept inside and looked all around. He had expected to find the barn crowded with saucers full of milk. But not a single saucer did he see. There were two long rows of cows stabled in the barn. And Sandy noticed Farmer Green and his boy and his hired man, each sitting on a low stool beside a cow. They were milking the cows. But Sandy did not know it.  He began to think that Henry Skunk had played a trick on him. And he was about to leave the barn when he turned to look at several bright tin pails standing on the floor.  Sandy crept up to one of them and sniffed at it. He was glad that he had done that, for he smelled _milk_. There was no mistake about it.  Sandy Chipmunk couldn't crawl up the side of the pail, it was so smooth and slippery. So he jumped right up and stood on its edge. And looking inside, he saw that the pail was almost full of milk. He knew then that Henry Skunk had told the truth.  By bending down Sandy was just able to reach the milk. And he began drinking it as fast as he could. It was so delicious that he forgot all about Johnnie Green and his father and the hired man.  With his head inside the pail, of course Sandy couldn't see what happened in the barn. The more he drank, the further down he had to stretch his neck. And when at last he heard a shout, and a milking-stool came sailing through the air not far above the pail, Sandy was so startled that he lost his balance and went _plump_! into the milk.  Luckily, Sandy Chipmunk knew how to swim. So he managed to keep his nose in the air or he would certainly have drowned.  \"Where on earth did that chipmunk go?\" he heard Johnnie Green say as he picked up his stool. You see, Johnnie never once thought of looking inside the pail.  Still, Sandy Chipmunk was in a fix. For the inside of the pail was as smooth and slippery as the outside. And of course he couldn't _jump_ out, for there was nothing from which he could spring.  Now it happened that the pail of milk stood not far behind the surly old cow that had told Sandy not to be silly, when he asked her for some milk to drink, in the pasture that day. Johnnie Green's shouting and the stool hurtling through the air displeased her. And since she was not the sort to hide her ill nature, she promptly kicked the milkpail over.  For a moment Sandy Chipmunk thought that this"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9462"],["title","The Tale of Sandy Chipmunk (#7)"],["body","the end of the world had certainly come. The old cow's foot crashed against the pail and sent it flying against the stone wall on which the barn was built. And Sandy tumbled out upon the floor in a sea of milk.  He didn't wait to learn exactly what had happened. For as soon as he could scramble to his feet he dashed out of the barn and tore across the fields towards the pasture.  Later, when he reached his house and sat down to rest, he soon forgot his fright. For he had a very pleasant time licking himself clean. That was the way Sandy Chipmunk always made himself spick and span. And though there may be some people who would not consider such an act to be in the best of taste, Sandy Chipmunk thought what was left of the milk _tasted very good_. And since his mother did not object to what he was doing, perhaps no one else ought to."]]]
