Si quaeritis hujus     Fortunam pugnae, non est superatus ab illo.      Ask you the End of this Contest ?     They neither had the better, both the best.\"  Mr. Wood expresses it thus:      \"At fourteen Years of Age\", says he (k), \"he disputed     ex tempore with the matchless Philip Sidney, (while he     was a young (l) Man, I suppose) in the presence of the     Earls of Leicester, Warwick, and other Nobility, at what     time they were lodged in Christ-Church, to receive     entertainment from the Muses.\"  Mr. Wood says afterwards, that      \"After Mr. Carew had spent three Years in Oxon, he retired     to the Middle Temple, where he spent 3 Years more\" (m) ;  which may be true, tho' he brings in no Authority for it. But what he adds, that      \"then he was sent with his Uncle (Sir George Carew     as it seems) in his Embassage unto the King of Poland;     whom when he came to Dantzick, he found that he had     been newly gone from thence into Sweden, whither also     he went after him :\"  And that      \"After his return, and a short stay made in England,     he was sent by his Father into France with Sir Hen.     Nevill, who was then Ambassador Leiger unto K. Hen. 4.     that he might learn the French Tongue, which by reading     and talking, he overcame in three quarters of a Year :\"  All this, I say, cannot hold, if it be true that, tho' he understood Italian, French, High-Dutch, and Spanish, he had never been out of England ; as his Countryman Charles Fitzgeffry seems to assert in the following Compliment to him:       Quis Deus tibi tam bene invocatus (n),     Disertissime millium trecentum     Idemq; optime omnium CARAEE,     (Seu quis multiplicem eruditionem,     Seu quis, quo magis emicas elenchum     Morum ponderet elegantiorum,     Virtutumq; tot auream coronam)     Quis (inquam) Deus (o Deus profecto!)     Tantis te spoliis, tot & trophaeis     Terrarum locupletat exterarum,     Domi perpetuo interim morantem     Et libris patriaeque servientem?     Quo Graij tibi, quo tibi Latini     Auri pondera tanta? quove Hetrusci,     Galli, Teutones, invidiq; Iberi     Tam assatim te opibus suis bearunt?     O si tot Deus ora, totq; linguas     Mihi idulserit, ut tuas referrem     Laudes, quot dedit ora quotq; linguas     Tibi uno Deus ore, lingua in una?  I may add, that Mr. Carew, in his Survey of Cornwall, giving an account of the eminent Men born in that Dutchy, reckons among the Civilians Doctor Carew (o) :      \"In the Civil Law\", says he (p), \"there lived of     late Doctor Kennals, and now (q) doth Doctor Carew,     one of the antientest Masters of the Chancery; in     which Calling, after his younger Years spent abroad     to his benefit, he hath reposed himself.\"  He mentions him again among the Persons employed in State Affairs, and therethrough stept to Preferment (r).      \"Master George Carew\", says he, \"in his younger Years     gathered such Fruit as the University, the Inns of     Court, and Foreign Travel could yield him.  Upon his     Return, he was first call'd to the Bar, then supply'd     the Place of Secretary to the Lord Chancellor Hatton;     and after his Decease, performed the like Office to his     two Successors, by special Recommendation from her     Majesty, who also gave him the Prothonotaryship of the     Chancery; and in anno 1598 sent him Ambassador to the     King of Poland, and other Northern Potentates, where     through unexpected Accidents, he underwent extraordinary     Perils; but God freed him from them, and he performed his     Duty in acceptable manner : And at this present the     Commonwealth  useth his Service, as a Master of the Chancery.\"  Had our Author attended this worthy Person in his Embassies, it is hardly possible he should not have taken some notice of it here; being elsewhere so ready to honour himself with the Friendship or Acquaintance of the Great Men of his Time.  As to what Mr. Wood adds, viz. that Mr. Carew was sent by his Father into France with Sir Henry Nevill.... that he might learn the French Tongue, &c. I am afraid he hath mistaken our Author for his Son, who, in effect, went into France with a Nevill, in order to learn the French Tongue ; as it appears by the following Verses of the aforesaid Fitzgeffry, upon his Return.

Learning is not only useful, but necessary in all Conditions and States of Life; but I will presume to say, that it is more particularly so to all Gentlemen, who are allotted to live in the Country.  And if they cannot pass their leisure Hours in reading, or cultivating Arts and Sciences, they will spend that time in such things as must be detrimental to their Families, and, at the end, fatal to their own Persons.  Our Author could never fall into those Inconveniences : He loved Letters, and not only made them subservient to his own Entertainment, but sometimes useful to the Publick.  As he was a great Master of Languages, he delivered his Opinion upon the true and ready way to learn the Latin Tongue, in answer to a Quaere, Whether the ordinary way by teaching Latin by the Rules of Grammar, be the best way for Youths to learn it (y)?  He wrote likewise a Dissertation, shewing the Excellency of the English Tongue (z) : and published a Translation of the Examen de Ingenios para las Sciencias, written by Juan Huerte, that ingenious and learned Spanish Physician.  It was printed at London in 1594, with this Title:  The Examination of Mens Wits.  In which, by discovering the Variety of Natures, is shewed for what Profession each one is apt, and how far he shall profit therein (A).  His Proficiency in natural Philosophy, enabled him to improve Agriculture and Husbandry to such a degree, that he was accounted among his Neighbours the greatest Husband, and most excellent Manager of Bees in Cornwall (B).  The Enquiries he had made into the History and Antiquities of Nations, and chiefly of Great Britain, engaged him to attempt a Description of Cornwall; as it is natural to every Man to have a particular Fondness for his native Country:      Nescio qua natale solum dulcedine cunctos       Ducit & immemores non finit esse sui.  This he only undertook for his private Satisfaction and Entertainment; but was afterwards prevail'd upon by his Friends to publish it, as we shall see anon. Mr. Camden, who had seen it, and was an excellent Judge in those Matters, thought himself obliged to do justice both to the Author and his Performance, in the first Edition of his Britannia, printed in the Year 1586:      \"But these Matters\" (says he, at the end of his Account     of Cornwall) \"will be laid open more distinctly and     fully, by Richard Carew of Antonie, a Person no less     eminent for his honourable Ancestors, than his own     Virtue and Learning, who is writing a Description of     this Country, not in little, but at large.\"      Sed haec planius & plenius docebit Richardus Carew     de Antonie, non minus generis splendore, quam virtute &     doctrina nobilis; qui hujus regionis descriptionem     latiore specie, & non ad tenue elimat (D).  Our Author's Knowledge in the Laws, his Love for Justice and Equity, and his Affection to the Government, rais'd him to all the Posts of Honour, that are consistent with a Country Life. Mr. Wood assures us (E), that he was made Justice of the Peace in 1581, High-Sheriff of Cornwall in 1586, and about that time was the Queens Deputy for the Militia. And indeed we find in his Survey of Cornwall, that he was Justice of the Peace, and one of the Quorum (F) : and that in the Year 1599, (Sir Walter Raleigh being then Lieutenant General of Cornwall) Mr. Carew was one of the Deputy Lieutenants, Treasurer of the Lieutenancy, and Colonel of a Regiment, consisting of five Companies, or 500 Men, armed with 170 Pikes, 300 Musquets, and 30 Calivers, appointed for Causam Bay (G).  There was at that time a Society of several Gentlemen, eminent for their Learning and Merit, such as Sir Robert Cotton, Mr. Dodderidge, (afterwards Sir John Dodderidge, who died one of the Judges of the King's-Bench) Mr. Camden, Mr. Stow, &c. who had regular Meetings, or Conferences, for the Improvement and Illustration of the History and Antiquities of England.  That Society had a particular Claim to our Author; and in 1589 he was elected a Member of the College of the Antiquaries (H).  The Oration he made at his Introduction, contained, (as I am informed by a Gentleman who saw it)      \"an elegant Display of the Devastations Time so     swiftly makes "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9878"],["title","The Survey of Cornwall (#2)"],["body","all things; thence it subsides to     the Advantages and Commendations of that kind of Study,     they had chosen to be the Subject of their Conferences :     and concludes with a pathetical Exhortation to his     Auditory, That they would persevere in establishing what     they had so nobly begun, and continue to employ their     Labours upon those things, which were worthy of them;     that so they might not be drawn into Oblivion themselves,     by that which they would rescue from it, and that Time     might not rob them of aught more considerable than that     which they should restore.\"  Thus flourished that Illustrious College of Antiquaries, whose Meetings were chiefly held at Sir Robert Cotton's House (I). For they had no publick Place for it.  And therefore these Gentlemen considering that they were but a private Society, which several Accidents might either interrupt, or even dissolve, and did besides want some Accommodations, in order to fix and perpetuate an Institution so beneficial to the Publick, they resolved to apply to the Queen for a Royal Charter, and for some publick Building, where they would perform their Exercises; and intended to erect a Library suitable to it.  And they had the more reason to believe they could obtain such a Grant, that the Queen, not contented with a superficial Smattering of Learning, back'd with Conceit and Talkativeness, (which is the highest pitch Persons of the first Rank do commonly arrive to) was truly and solidly learned, and a real Encourager of Letters : wherein she had the ready Concurrence of her Ministers, who were no less conspicuous for their Learning, than for their Integrity and consummate Wisdom.  But as fair as the Hopes of this famous College appeared in its Bloom, they were soon blighted by the Death of that ever-memorable Princess, like those Fruits, which for want of the Sun's genial Rays, cannot arrive at due Maturity.  For all the Applications they made for the same purpose to her Successor, proved vain and unsuccessful.  But what else could be expected from a Man who never had a relish for polite Literature, or any kind of useful Learning, and only delighted in pedantick scholastical Divinity; and fancy'd himself the Wisest and most glorious Prince in the World, (a second Solomon forsooth) if he could but scrible a Pamphlet against Witches, or against tobacco: a Man, in short, whose Genius and Taste were as low and mean, as his Soul and Inclinations!  As for our learned Antiquaries, they were obliged to dissolve themselves, and break their Society, lest (such was the Wisdom of those Times) they should be prosecuted as a Cabal against the Government : Ne quicquam mali contra Rempublicam illos moliri Rex, Conciliariive suspicarentur (K).  Mr. Carew published his Survey of Cornwall, in the Year 1602 (L) and did dedicate it to his Friend Sir Walter Raleigh, Lord Warden of the Stannaries, Lieutenant-General of Cornwall, &c.      \"This mine ill-husbanded Survey\", says he to that great     Man, \" long since begun, a great while discontinued,     lately reviewed, and  now hastily finished, appealeth     to your Lordship's Direction, whether it should pass;     to your Corection if it do pass; and  to your Protection     when it is passed.  Neither unduly : for the same     intreateth of the Province and Persons, over whose Bodies     and Estates, you carry a large, both Martial and Civil     Command, by your Authority ; but in whose Hearts and     Loves you possess a far greater Interest, by your Kindness.     Your Ears and Mouth have ever been open to hear and     deliver our Grievances, and your Feet and Hands ready to go,     and work their Redress; and that, not only always as a     Magistrate of yourself, but also  very often, as a Suiter     and Solicitor to others, of the highest Place.  Wherefore,     I, as one of the common beholden, present this Token of     my private Gratitude.  It is Duty and not Presumption,     that hath drawn me to the Offering; and it must be     Favour, and not Desert, that shall move your Lordship to     the acceptance.  And so I take humble leave, resting no     less willing to serve you, than under you.\"  The Reader will, I hope, excuse my transcribing here the whole Epistle.  These Addresses are a true Test of an Author's Wit and Genius.  And who can be displeased with so just a Character of one of the greatest Men of our Nation?  Mr. Carew subscribes himself, His Lordships poor Kinsman, Richard Carew of Antonie; but how he was related to him, I could not yet find. Sir Walter Raleigh had a Son, whose Christen-name was Carew; and probably our Author was his Godfather.  In his Preface, Mr. Carew observes, that when he first composed this Treatise, not minding that it should be published in Print, he caused only certain written Copies to be given to some of his Friends ...... But since that time, Master Camden's often mentioning this Work, and his Friends Persuasions, had caused his Determination to alter, and to embrace a pleasing Hope, that Charity and good Construction would rest now generally in all Readers.      \"Besides\", says he, \" the State of our Country hath     undergone so many Alterations, since I first began these     Scriblings, that, in the reviewing, I was driven either     likewise to vary my Report, or else to speak against my     Knowledge....      Reckon therefore (I pray you) that this Treatise plotteth     down Cornwall, as it now standeth, for the particulars,     and will continue, for the general.\"  Mr. Carew's Survey of Cornwall was receiv'd, when it came out, (as it hath been ever since) with a general Applause; as it appears by the Encomiums pass'd upon it, which it would  be  too long to enumerate.  Mr. Camden, in the sixth Edition of his Britannia, printed in 1607, acknowledges, at the end  of his Account of Cornwall, that our Author had been his chief Guide through it (M).  But as 'tis usual to Authors of an inferior rank to be the best pleased with their Works, so the best Authors are the least satisfy'd with their Performances, and the most severe Censors to themselves.  The Approbation of the Publick only excites them to mend their Writings, and give them all the Perfection they are capable. Mr. Carew was uneasy at the Errors of the Printers, and  some Oversights of his, that had crept into his Book; and desired to improve it by the Observations  of others, who had writ on the same Subject.  Being told in the Year 1606, that Mr. Dodderidge, who was then Sollicitor-General, had published some Account of the Dutchy of Cornwall, (which was not true, for that Tract did not come out till 1630) he desired Mr. Camden to send him a Copy of it.       \"I make bold\", says he (N), \" to use my thanks for your      kind remembring me by Sir Anthony Rouse, as a Shoeing-      horn to draw on a Request; and this it is : I learn that      Master Sollicitor hath compiled a Treatise of our Cornish      Dutchy, and dedicated it to the Prince : this I much long      to see, and heartily pray by your means to obtain a Copy      thereof.  The first publishing of my Survey was voluntary;      the second, which I now purpose, is of necessity, not so      much for the enlarging it, as the correcting mine and the      Printers Oversights: and amongst these, the Arms not the      least, touching which mine Order, suitable to your Direction,      was not observed, and so myself made an Instrument, but      not the Author of Wrong and Error.  I imagine that I may      cull out of Master Sollicitor's Garden many Flowers to      adorn this other Edition; and if I wist where to find      Mr. Norden, I would also fain have his Map of our Shire;      for perfecting of which, he took a Journey into these Parts.\"  Mr. Carew never published a second Edition of his Book, tho' he lived fourteen Years after the writing of that Letter.  And whether he left behind him a Copy of it revised and corrected for a new Impression, does not appear.  It hath indeed been reported, that there was a Copy extant with large Additions (O); but they don't tell us whose Additions they are.  They can hardly be the Author's own Additions, since they are said to be large ones; and we have seen that Mr. Carew's Design in the intended second Edition of his Survey, was not so much for the enlarging it, as the correcting his and the Printers Oversights.  However it be, we may reasonably wonder that a Work so valuable, and the only compleat one we have on that Subject, should not have been reprinted since the Year 1602; whereby it is become so scarce, and bears such an excessive Price.  Perhaps this is owing to the false Rumours which have been spread from time to time, that it was going to be reprinted with large Additions.  For these idle common Reports have often prevented new Editions of useful and necessary Books.  But it is to be hoped, that some publick-spirited Persons will reprint it, as it was first published.  If any body hath any Additions or Supplements to it, they may print them separately.  Mr. Carew (P)       \"was intimate with the most noted Scholars of his Time,      particularly with Sir Henry Spelman, who in an Epistle (*)      to him concerning Tythes, doth not a little extol him for      his Ingenuity, Vertue, and Learning.  'Palmam igitur cedo'      (saith he) '& quod Graeci olim in Caria fua gente, admirati      sunt, nos in Caria nostra gente agnoscimus, ingenium      splendidum, bellarumque intentionum saecundissimum, &c.'\"  And a famous Scotch Poet (+)       \"stiles him another Livy, another Maro, another Papinian,      and highly extols him for his great Skill in History, and      Knowledge in the Laws (Q).\"  Mr. Carew       \"died on the sixth day of November, in fifteen hundred and      twenty, and was buried in the Church of East-Antonie among      his Ancestors. Shortly after, he had a splendid Monument      set over his Grave, with an Inscription thereon, written      in the Latin Tongue (R)\"  As I have not"]]]
