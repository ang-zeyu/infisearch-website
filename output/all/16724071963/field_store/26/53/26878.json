[[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],["title","Introductory American History (#7)"],["body","a   winter's day and the river was swollen by rains. The two camps lay on   opposite banks. In the early morning Hannibal sent across the river a   body of horsemen to attack the Roman camp and draw the Romans into a   battle. At the same time he ordered his other soldiers to eat   breakfast, to build fires before their tents to warm themselves, and   to rub their bodies with oil, so that they might be strong for the   coming fight.    The Romans were suddenly roused by the attack of the Carthaginian   horsemen, and, without waiting for food, moved out of camp, chasing   the horsemen toward the river. Into its icy waters the Romans waded   breast-high, and when they came up on the opposite bank they were   benumbed with cold. As soon as Hannibal knew that the Romans had   crossed the river he attacked them fiercely with all his troops. Two   thousand men whom he had placed in ambush fell upon the rear of their   line. Their allies were frightened by a charge of elephants. Seeing   that destruction was certain, ten thousand of the best soldiers broke   through the Carthaginian line and marched away. All the rest of the   army was destroyed.  ROMAN ENDURANCE. This was not the last of the Roman defeats. Two other   armies were destroyed by Hannibal during the next two years. In the   battle of Cannae nearly seventy thousand Romans, including eighty   senators, were slain. The news filled the city with weeping women, but   the senate did not think of yielding. When their allies deserted them,   they besieged the faithless cities, took them, beheaded the rulers,   and sold the inhabitants into slavery.    They did not dare to fight Hannibal in the open field, but tried to   wear him out by cutting off all small bodies of his troops and by   making it difficult for him to get food for his army. They carried the   war into Spain and finally into Africa, and when, with a weakened   army, Hannibal faced them there, they defeated him. His defeat was the   ruin of Carthage, for the unhappy city was compelled to see her fleet   destroyed, to pay the Romans a huge sum of money, and to give up Spain   to them.    [Illustration: A ROMAN SOLDIER]  OTHER ROMAN TRIUMPHS. The war with Carthage ended two hundred and two   years before the birth of Christ. In the wars that followed, Roman   armies fought not only in Spain and Africa, but also in Greece and   Asia. Carthage was destroyed; as was also Corinth, a Greek city. Roman   generals enriched themselves and sent great treasures back to Rome.   Roman merchants grew rich because their rivals in Carthage and Corinth   were ruined or because the conquered cities were forbidden to trade   with any city but Rome. All this took a long time and many wars, but   in the end the Romans became masters of every land along the shores of   the Mediterranean. This was not wholly a misfortune, for the Romans   had learned that the Greeks were superior to them in some things and   they took the Greeks as their teachers in most of the arts of living.   The ancient world became a sort of partnership, and we call its   civilization Graeco-Roman, that is, both Greek and Roman.  THE ROMANS AS RULERS. The Romans at first treated the lands in Sicily,   Spain, Africa, Greece, and Asia as conquered territories, or   provinces, sending to rule over them officers who were to act both as   governors and judges. With these men went many tax-collectors or   \"publicans.\" The Romans were obliged to leave in most provinces a   large body of soldiers to put down any attempt at rebellion. Often the   officers and the publicans robbed the country instead of ruling it   justly.  EVIL RESULTS OF CONQUEST. During the wars the Romans had lost many of   their simple ways of living. Some had grown rich in the business of   providing for the armies and navies, and they were eager for new wars   in order to make still bigger fortunes. Hannibal's marches up and down   Italy had driven thousands of farmers from their homes, and they had   wandered to Rome for safety and food. When the war was over many of   them did not go back to their homes. Those who did found that they   could no longer get fair prices for their crops because great   quantities of wheat were shipped to Rome from the conquered lands.   Wealthy men bought the little farms and joined them, making great   estates where slaves raised sheep and cattle or tended vineyards and   olive groves. There was not much work for free men in Rome, for slaves   were very cheap. One army of prisoners was sold at about eight cents   apiece. In this way the poor were made idle, while the rich sent   everywhere for new luxuries.    [Illustration: GLADIATORS After carvings on the tomb of   Scaurus]  CRUEL SPORTS. To amuse the idle crowds, office-seekers and victorious   generals provided cruel sports. Savage animals were turned loose to   tear one another to pieces. What was worse, human prisoners were   compelled to fight, armed with swords or spears. These men were called   gladiators, and often were specially trained to fight with one another   or with wild beasts.  SOME THINGS THE ROMANS LEARNED. But the successes of the Romans   brought them other things which were good. They took the buildings of   the Greeks as models and built similar temples and porticoes in Rome,   especially about the old market place or Forum. Their own houses,   which in earlier times were nothing but cabins, they enlarged, and if   they were rich enough, built palaces, adorned with paintings and with   statues. Unfortunately many of these came from the plunder of Greek   cities, for the Romans were great robbers of other peoples. The poorer   Romans continued to live in wretched hovels.  THE THEATER. The Romans learned more about the theaters of the Greeks.   Their plays were either translated into Latin from Greek or retold in   a different manner from the original Greek. The Romans did not succeed   in writing any plays of their own which were as good as the plays of   the Greeks.    [Illustration: RUINS OF THE ROMAN THEATER AT ORANGE, FRANCE]  THE NEW EDUCATION OF THE ROMANS. The Greeks also taught the Romans how   to write poems and histories. The first histories were written in   Greek, but later the Romans learned how to write in Latin prose and   poetry as good as much that had been written by the Greeks. Greek   became the second language of every educated Roman, and thus he could   enjoy the books of the Greeks as well as those written by Romans. The   education of the Roman boy now began with the poems of Homer, and the   young man's education was not thought to be finished until he had   traveled in Greece and the lands along the eastern Mediterranean.

CHAPTER VII   THE ANCIENT WORLD EXTENDED TO THE SHORES OF THE ATLANTIC  NEW CONQUESTS OF THE ROMANS. The Romans had as yet conquered only   civilized peoples like themselves, with the exception of the tribes in   Spain and southern Gaul. Now the Roman armies were to push northward   over the plains and through the forests of Gaul, across the Rhine into   unknown Germany, and over the Channel into Britain, equally unknown.   They were to be explorers as well as conquerors. In this way they were   to carry their civilization to the Rhine and the Atlantic, and so   increase greatly the part of the earth where men lived and thought as   the Romans did and as the Greeks had before them. The ancient civilized   world was beginning to move from its older center, the Mediterranean,   toward the shore of the Atlantic.  ANCESTORS OF THE FRENCH AND THE GERMANS. The tribes living in Gaul   were not at that time called French, but Gallic. The Gauls were like the   Britons who lived across the Channel in Britain. The German ancestors of   the English had not yet crossed the North Sea to that land. Beyond the   Rhine lived the Germans, who had but little to do with the Romans and   the Greeks and were still barbarians. The Gauls living farthest away   from the Roman settlements were not much more civilized.    The principal difference between the Germans and the Gauls was that the   Gauls lived in villages and towns and cultivated the land or dug in   mines or traded along the rivers, while the Germans had no towns and   dwelt in clearings of the forest. Their wealth, like that of the early   Romans, was their cattle. The land they cultivated was divided between   them year after year, so that a German owned only his hut and the plot   of ground or garden about it. Some of the towns of the Gauls were placed   on high hills and were protected by strong walls.  THE TERRIBLE GERMANS. The Romans had at first been afraid of the   Gauls, because they had never forgotten how terribly these"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9897"],["title","Introductory American History (#8)"],["body","had   once defeated them. But since that time they had fought the Gauls so   often that they were losing this fear. They now dreaded more to meet the   Germans, who seemed like giants because they were taller even than   the Gauls.    [Illustration: GALLIC WARRIORS]  GALLIC AND GERMAN WARRIORS. The leaders of the Germans were sometimes   kings and sometimes nobles whom the Romans called _duces_, from which   comes our word duke. The Gallic chieftains were adorned with gold   necklaces, bracelets, and rings. When they went out to battle, they wore   helmets shaped like the head of some ravenous beast, and their bodies   were protected by coats of chain armor made of iron rings. Their   principal weapon was a long, heavy sword. Both German and Gallic nobles   were accompanied by bands of young men, their devoted followers, who   shared the joys of victory or died with them in case of defeat. It was a   disgrace to lose one's sword or to survive if the leader was killed.  HOW THE GERMANS LIVED. When the Germans were not fighting they were   idle, for all work was done by women and slaves. They were great   drinkers and gamblers, and often in their games a man would stake his   freedom upon the result. If he lost, he became the slave of the winner.   The Germans respected their wives, even if they compelled them to do the   hard work. The women sometimes went with the men to battle, and their   cries encouraged the warriors, or if the warriors wavered, the fierce   reproaches of the women drove them back to the fight.  RELIGION OF THE GERMANS. We remember the religion of the Germans   because four days of the week are named for their gods or the gods of   their neighbors across the Baltic. Their principal god was Wodan, or   Odin, god of the sun and the tempest. Wodan's day is Wednesday. Thursday   is named for Thor, the Northmen's god of thunder. The god of war, Tiw,   gave a name to Tuesday, and Frigu, the goddess of love, to Friday. The   German, like his northern neighbors, thought of heaven as the place   where brave warriors who had died in battle spent their days   in feasting.  JULIUS CAESAR. Julius Caesar was the great Roman general who   conquered the Gauls and led the first expeditions across the Rhine into   Germany and over the Channel into Britain. He was a wealthy noble who,   like other nobles, held one office after another until he became consul.   He was also a great political leader, and with two other men controlled   Rome. We should call them \"bosses,\" but the Romans called them   \"triumvirs.\"    [Illustration: JULIUS CAESAR After the bust in the Museum at   Naples]  CAESAR IN GAUL. As soon as Caesar became governor of the province   of southern Gaul, he showed that he was a skilful general as well as a   successful politician. He interfered in the wars between the Gauls,   taking sides with the friends of the Romans. When a large army of   Germans entered Gaul, he defeated it and drove it back across the Rhine.   One war led to another until all the tribes from the country now called   Belgium to the Mediterranean coast professed to be friends of the Roman   people. His campaigns lasted from 58 B.C. for nine years. Two or three   times Caesar was very close to ruin, but by his courage and energy he   always succeeded in gaining the victory.  VERCINGETORIX, GALLIC HERO. The great hero of the Gauls in their   struggle with the Romans was Vercingetorix. He was a young noble who   lived in a mountain town of central Gaul. His father had been killed in   an attempt to make himself king of his native city. Vercingetorix   believed that if the Gauls did not unite against the Romans they would   soon see their lands become Roman provinces. As he knew his army was no   match for the Romans in open fight, he persuaded the Gauls to try to   starve the Romans out of the country. He planned to destroy all village   stores of grain, and to cut off the smaller bands of soldiers which   wandered from the main army in search of food.  CAESAR AND VERCINGETORIX. Vercingetorix found the work of   conquering Caesar in this way too difficult. He was finally driven to   take refuge in Alesia, on a hilltop in eastern Gaul. Here the Romans   prepared to starve him into surrender. They dug miles of deep trenches   about the fortress so that the imprisoned Gauls could not break through.   They dug other trenches to protect themselves from the attacks of a   great army of Gauls which came to rescue Vercingetorix. These trenches   were fifteen or twenty feet wide; they were strengthened by palisades   and ramparts, and filled with water where this was possible. Several   times the Gauls nearly succeeded in breaking through, but the quickness   and stubborn courage of Caesar always saved the day.  DEATH OF VERCINGETORIX. Vercingetorix now proved that he was a real   hero. He offered to give himself up to Caesar, if this would save the   town. But Caesar demanded the submission of all the chiefs. When they   had laid down their arms before the conqueror, Vercingetorix appeared on   a gaily decorated horse. He rode around the throne where Caesar sat,   dismounted in front, took off his armor, and bowed to the ground. His   fate was hard. He was sent to Rome a prisoner, was shown in the   triumphal procession of the victorious Caesar, and was then put to death   in a dungeon. On the site of Alesia stands a monument erected by the   French to the memory of the brave Gallic hero. The defeat of   Vercingetorix ended the resistance of the Gauls, and not many years   afterward their country was added to the long list of Roman provinces.    [Illustration: THE BRIDGE ON WHICH CAESAR'S ARMY CROSSED THE   RHINE]  CAESAR IN GERMANY. Caesar crossed the Rhine into Germany on a bridge   which his engineers built in ten days. He laid waste the fields of the   tribes near the river in order to make the name of Rome feared, and then   returned to Gaul and destroyed the bridge. Twice he sailed over to   Britain, the last time marching a few miles north of where London now   stands. His purpose was to keep the Britons from stirring up the Gauls   to attack him. Other generals many years later conquered Britain as far   as the hills of Scotland.  THE GERMAN HERO HERMANN. The Romans were not fortunate in their   later attempts to conquer a part of Germany. When Caesar's grandnephew   Augustus was master of Rome, he sent an army under Varus into the   forests far from the Rhine. Hermann, a leader of the Germans, gathered   the tribes together and utterly destroyed the army of Varus. Whenever   Augustus thought of this dreadful disaster, he would cry out, \"O Varus,   give me back my legions!\" The Rhine and the Danube became the northern   boundaries of the Roman conquests.  GAULS AND BRITONS BECOME ROMAN. Although the Gauls had fought   stubbornly against Caesar they soon became as Roman as the Italians   themselves. They ceased to speak their own language and began to use   Latin. They mastered Latin so thoroughly that their schools were   sometimes regarded as better than the schools in Italy, and Roman youths   were sent to Gaul to learn how best to speak their own language. The   Britons also became very good Romans. Even the Germans frequently   crossed the Rhine and enlisted in the Roman armies. When they returned   to their own country they carried Roman ideas and customs with them.  THE INTEREST OF AMERICANS IN ROMAN SUCCESSES. For Americans the   influence the Romans exerted in Spain, Gaul, Germany, and Britain is   more important than their work in the eastern Mediterranean, because   from those countries came the early settlers of America. The   civilization which the Romans taught the peoples of western Europe was   to become a valuable part of the civilization of our forefathers.    [Illustration: THE ROMAN EMPIRE AT ITS GREATEST EXTENT IN 395   A.D.]  SIZE OF THE ROMAN WORLD. We may realize how large the world of the   Romans was by observing on a modern map that within its limits lay   modern England, France, Spain, Portugal, the southern part of   Austria-Hungary, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, the Turkish Empire both in   Europe and Asia, Egypt, Tripoli, Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco. For a time   they also ruled north of the Danube, and the Rumanians boast that they   are descended from Roman colonists. The peoples in southern Russia were   influenced by the Greeks and by the Romans, although the Romans did not   try to bring them under their rule.    No modern empire has included so many important countries. If we compare   this vast territory with, the scattered colonies of the Greeks, we shall   understand how useful it was that the Romans adopted much of the Greek   civilization, for they could carry it to places that the Greeks   never reached.
