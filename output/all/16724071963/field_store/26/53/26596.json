For instance, I shall call a man \"intrepid,\" if he despises an evil which I am accustomed to fear; if I further take into consideration, that, in his desire to injure his enemies and to benefit those whom he loves, he is not restrained by the fear of an evil which is sufficient to restrain me, I shall call him \"daring.\"  Again, a man will appear \"timid\" to me, if he fears an evil which I am accustomed to despise; and if I further take into consideration that his desire is restrained by the fear of an evil, which is not sufficient to restrain me, I shall say that he is \"cowardly;\" and in like manner will everyone pass judgment. [*This is possible, though the human mind is part of the divine intellect, as I have shown in II. xiii. note.]  Lastly, from this inconstancy in the nature of human judgment, inasmuch as a man often judges things solely by his emotions, and inasmuch as the things which he believes cause pleasure or pain, and therefore endeavours to promote or prevent, are often purely imaginary, not to speak of the uncertainty of things alluded to in III. xxviii.; we may readily conceive that a man may be at one time affected with pleasure, and at another with pain, accompanied by the idea of himself as cause.  Thus we can easily understand what are \"Repentance\" and \"Self-complacency.\" \"Repentance\" is \"pain, accompanied by the idea of one's self as cause;\" \"Self-complacency\" is \"pleasure, accompanied by the idea of one's self as cause,\" and these emotions are most intense because men believe themselves to be free (III. xlix.).  LII. An object which we have formerly seen in conjunction with others, and which we do not conceive to have any property that is not common to many, will not be regarded by us for so long, as an object which we conceive to have some property peculiar to itself.  >>>>>Proof--As soon as we conceive an object which we have seen in conjunction with others, we at once remember those others (II. xviii. and note), and thus we pass forthwith from the contemplation of one object to the contemplation of another object.  And this is the case with the object, which we conceive to have no property that is not common to many.  For we thereupon assume that we are regarding therein nothing, which we have not before seen in conjunction with other objects. But when we suppose that we conceive an object something special, which we have never seen before, we must needs say that the mind, while regarding that object, has in itself nothing which it can fall to regarding instead thereof; therefore it is determined to the contemplation of that object only.  Therefore an object, &c.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--This mental modification, or imagination of a particular thing, in so far as it is alone in the mind, is called \"Wonder;\" but if it be excited by an object of fear, it is called \"Consternation,\" because wonder at an evil keeps a man so engrossed in the simple contemplation thereof, that he has no power to think of anything else whereby he might avoid the evil.  If, however, the object of wonder be a man's prudence, industry, or anything of that sort, inasmuch as the said man, is thereby regarded as far surpassing ourselves, wonder is called \"Veneration;\" otherwise, if a man's anger, envy, &c., be what we wonder at, the emotion is called \"Horror.\"  Again, if it be the prudence, industry, or what not, of a man we love, that we wonder at, our love will on this account be the greater (III. xii.), and when joined to wonder or veneration is called \"Devotion.\"  We may in like manner conceive hatred, hope, confidence, and the other emotions, as associated with wonder; and we should thus be able to deduce more emotions than those which have obtained names in ordinary speech.  Whence it is evident, that the names of the emotions have been applied in accordance rather with their ordinary manifestations than with an accurate knowledge of their nature.  To wonder is opposed \"Contempt,\" which generally arises  from the fact that, because we see someone wondering at, loving, or fearing something, or because something, at first sight, appears to be like things, which we ourselves wonder at, love, fear, &c., we are, in consequence (III. xv. Cor. and III. xxvii.), determined to wonder at, love, or fear that thing.  But if from the presence, or more accurate contemplation of the said thing, we are compelled to deny concerning it all that can be the cause of wonder, love, fear, &c., the mind then, by the presence of the thing, remains determined to think rather of those qualities which are not in it, than of those which are in it; whereas, on the other hand, the presence of the object would cause it more particularly to regard that which is therein.  As devotion springs from wonder at a thing which we love, so does \"Derision\" spring from contempt of a thing which we hate or fear, and \"Scorn\" from contempt of folly, as veneration from wonder at prudence.  Lastly, we can conceive the emotions of love, hope, honour, &c., in association with contempt, and can thence deduce other emotions, which are not distinguished one from another by any recognized name.  LIII. When the mind regards itself and its own power of activity, it feels pleasure:  and that pleasure is greater in proportion to the distinctness wherewith it conceives itself and its own power of activity.  >>>>>Proof--A man does not know himself except through the modifications of his body, and the ideas thereof (II. xix. and xxiii.). When, therefore, the mind is able to contemplate itself, it is thereby assumed to pass to a greater perfection, or (III. xi. note) to feel pleasure; and the pleasure will be greater in proportion to the distinctness, wherewith it is able to conceive itself and its own power of activity.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--This pleasure is fostered more and more, in proportion as a man conceives himself to be praised by others. For the more he conceives himself as praised by others, the more he will imagine them to be affected with pleasure, accompanied by the idea of himself (III. xxix. note); thus he is (III. xxvii.) himself affected with greater pleasure, accompanied by the idea of himself.  Q.E.D.  LIV. The mind endeavours to conceive only such things as assert its power of activity.  >>>>>Proof--The endeavour or power of the mind is the actual essence thereof (III. vii.); but the essence of the mind obviously only affirms that which the mind is and can do; not that which it neither is nor can do; therefore the mind endeavours to conceive only such things as assert or affirm its power of activity.  Q.E.D.  LV. When the mind contemplates its own weakness, it feels pain thereat.  >>>>>Proof--The essence of the mind only affirms that which the mind is, or can do; in other words, it is the mind's nature to conceive only such things as assert its power of activity (last Prop.).  Thus, when we say that the mind contemplates its own weakness, we are merely saying that while the mind is attempting to conceive something which asserts its power of activity, it is checked in its endeavour -- in other words (III. xi. note), it feels pain.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--This pain is more and more fostered, if a man conceives that he is blamed by others; this may be proved in the same way as the corollary to III. liii.  *****Note--This pain, accompanied by the idea of our own weakness, is called \"humility;\" the pleasure, which springs from the contemplation of ourselves, is called \"self-love\" or \"self- complacency.\"  And inasmuch as this feeling is renewed as often as a man contemplates his own virtues, or his own power of activity, it follows that everyone is fond of narrating his own exploits, and displaying the force both of his body and mind, and also that, for this reason, men are troublesome to one another.  Again, it follows that men are naturally envious (III. xxiv. note, and III. xxxii. note), rejoicing in the shortcomings of their equals, and feeling pain at their virtues.  For whenever a man conceives his own actions, he is affected with pleasure (III. liii.), in proportion as his actions display more perfection, and he conceives them more distinctly -- that is (II. xl. note), in proportion as he can distinguish them from others, and regard them as something special.  Therefore, a man will take most pleasure in contemplating himself, when he contemplates some quality which he denies to others.  But, if that which he affirms of himself be attributable to the idea of man or animals in general, he will not be so greatly pleased:  he will, on the contrary, feel pain, if he conceives that his own actions fall short when compared with those of others.  This pain (III. xxviii.) he will endeavour to remove, by putting a wrong construction on the actions of his equals, or by, as far as he can, embellishing his own.  It is thus apparent that men are naturally prone to hatred and envy, which latter is fostered by their education.  For parents are accustomed to incite their children to virtue solely by the spur of honour and envy.  But, perhaps, some will scruple to assent to what I have said, because we not seldom admire men's virtues, and venerate their possessors.  In order to remove such doubts, I append the following corollary.  <<<<<Corollary--No one envies the virtue of anyone who is not his equal.  >>>>>Proof--Envy is a species of hatred (III. xxiv. note) or (III. xiii. note) pain, that is (III. xi. note), a modification whereby a man's power of activity, or endeavour towards activity, is checked.  But a man does not endeavour or desire to do anything, which cannot follow from his nature as it is given; therefore a man will not desire any power of activity or virtue (which is the same thing) to be attributed to him, that is appropriate to another's nature and foreign to his own; hence his desire"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9482"],["title","What Sami Sings with the Birds (#0)"],["body","SAMI SINGS WITH THE BIRDS  BY  JOHANNA SPYRI     TRANSLATED BY HELEN B.

WHERE HAVE YOU COME FROM WITH ALL YOUR HOUSEHOLD GOODS?  SUCH STRAY WAIFS AS YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO DO ANYTHING.     WHAT SAMI SINGS WITH THE BIRDS     CHAPTER FIRST  OLD MARY ANN   For three days the Spring sun had been shining out of a clear sky and casting a gleaming, golden coverlet over the blue waters of Lake Geneva. Storm and rain had ceased. The breeze murmured softly and pleasantly up in the ash-trees, and all around in the green fields the yellow buttercups and snow-white daisies glistened in the bright sunshine. Under the ash-trees, the clear brook was running with the cool mountain water and feeding the gaily nodding primroses and pink anemones on the hillside, as they grew and bloomed down close to the water.  On the low wall by the brook, in the shadow of the ash-trees, an old woman was sitting. She was called “Old Mary Ann” throughout the whole neighborhood. Her big basket, the weight of which had become a little heavy, she had put down beside her. She was on her way back from La Tour, the little old town, with the vine-covered church tower and the ruined castle, the high turrets of which rose far across the blue lake. Old Mary Ann had taken her work there. This consisted in all kinds of mending which did not need to be done particularly well, for the woman was no longer able to do fine work, and never could do it.  Old Mary Ann had had a very changeable life. The place where she now found herself was not her home. The language of the country was not her own. From the shady seat on the low wall, she now looked contentedly at the sunny fields, then across the murmuring brook to the hillside where the big yellow primroses nodded, while the birds piped and sang in the green ash-trees above her, as if they had the greatest festival to celebrate.  “Every Spring, people think it never was so beautiful before, when they have already seen so many,” she now said half aloud to herself, and as she gazed at the fields so rich in flowers, many of the past years rose up and passed before her, with all that she had experienced in them.  As a child she had lived far beyond the mountains. She knew so well how it must look over there now at her father’s house, which stood in a field among white-blooming pear-trees. Over yonder the large village with its many houses could be seen. It was called Zweisimmen. Everybody called their house the sergeant’s house, although her father quite peacefully tilled his fields. But that came from her grandfather. When quite a young fellow, he had gone over the mountains to Lake Geneva and then still farther to Savoy. Under a Duke of Savoy he had taken part in all sorts of military expeditions and had not returned home until he was an old man. He always wore an old uniform and allowed himself to be called sergeant. Then he married and Mary Ann’s father was his only child. The old man lived to be a hundred years old, and every child in all the region round knew the old sergeant.  Mary Ann had three brothers, but as soon as one of them grew up he disappeared, she knew not where. Only this much she understood, that her mother mourned over them, but her father said quite resignedly every time: “We can’t help it, they will go over the mountains; they take it from their grandfather.” She had never heard anything more about her brothers.  When Mary Ann grew up and married, her young husband also came into the house among the pear-trees, for her father was old and could no longer do his work alone. But after a few years Mary Ann buried her young husband; a burning fever had taken him off. Then came hard times for the widow. She had her child, little Sami, to care for, besides her old, infirm parents to look after, and moreover there was all the work to be done in the house and in the fields which until now her husband had attended to. She did what she could, but it was of no use, the land had to be given up to a cousin. The house was mortgaged, and Mary Ann hardly knew how to keep her old parents from want. Gradually young Sami grew up and was able to help the cousin in the fields. Then the old parents died about the same time, and Mary Ann hoped now by hard work and her son’s help little by little to pay up her debts and once more take possession of her fields and house. But as soon as her father and mother were buried, her son Sami, who was now eighteen years old, came to her and said he could no longer bear to stay at home, he must go over the mountains and so begin a new life. This was a great shock to the mother, but when she saw that persuasion, remonstrance and entreaty were all in vain her father’s words came to her mind and she said resignedly, “It can’t be helped; he takes it from his great-grandfather.”  But she would not let the young man go away alone, and he was glad to have his mother go with him. So she wandered with him over the mountains. In the little village of Chailly, which lies high up on the mountain slope and looks down on the meadows rich in flowers and the blue Lake Geneva, they found work with the jolly wine-grower Malon. This man, with curly hair already turning grey and a kindly round face, lived alone with his son in the only house left standing, near a crooked maple-tree.  Mary Ann received a room for herself and was to keep house for Herr Malon, and keep everything in order for him and his son. Sami was to work for good pay in Malon’s beautiful vineyard. The widow Mary Ann passed several years here in a more peaceful way than she had ever known before.  When the fourth Summer came to an end, Sami said to her one day:  “Mother, I must really marry young Marietta of St. Legier, for I am so lonely away from her.”  His mother knew Marietta well and besides she liked the pretty, clever girl, for she was not only always happy but there were few girls so good and industrious. So she rejoiced with her son, although he would have to go away from her to live with Marietta and her aged father in St. Legier, for she was indispensable to him. Herr Malon’s son also brought a young wife home, and so Mary Ann had no more duties there, and had to look out for herself. She kept her room for a small rent, and was able to earn enough to support herself. She now knew many people in the neighborhood, and obtained enough work.  Mary Ann pondered over all these things, and when her thoughts returned from the distant past to the present moment, and she still heard the birds above her singing and rejoicing untiringly, she said to herself:  “They always sing the same song and we should be able to sing with them. Only trust in the dear Lord! He always helps us, although we may often think there is no possible way.”  Then Mary Ann left the low wall, took her basket up again on her arm and went through the fragrant meadows of Burier up towards Chailly. From time to time she cast an anxious look in the direction of St. Legier. She knew that young Marietta was lying sick up there and that her son Sami would now have hard work and care, for a much smaller Sami had just come into the world. Tomorrow Mary Ann would go over and see how things were going with her son and if she ought to stay with him and help.  Mary Ann had scarcely stepped into her little room and put on her house dress, to prepare her supper, when she heard some one coming along with hurried footsteps. The door was quickly thrown open and in stepped her son Sami with a very distressed face. Under his arm he carried a bundle wrapped up in one of Marietta’s aprons. This he laid on the table, threw himself down and sobbed aloud, with his head in his arms:  “It is all over, mother, all over; Marietta is dead!”  “Oh, for Heaven’s sake, what are you saying?” cried his mother in the greatest horror. “Oh, Sami, is it possible?”  Then she lifted Sami gently and continued in a trembling voice:  “Come, sit down beside me and tell me all about it. Is she really dead? Oh, when did it happen? How did it come so quickly?”  Sami willingly dropped down on a chair beside his mother. But then he buried his face in his hands and went on sobbing again.  “Oh, I can’t bear it, I must go away, mother, I can’t bear it here any longer, it is all over!”  “Oh, Sami, where would you go?” said his mother, weeping. “We have already come over the mountains, where would you go from here?”  “I must go across the water, as far as I possibly can, I can’t stay here any longer. I cannot, mother,” declared Sami. “I must go across the great water as far as possible!”  “Oh, not that!” cried Mary Ann. “Don’t be so rash! Wait a little, until you can think more calmly; it will seem different to you.”  “No, mother, no, I must go away. I am forced to it; I can’t do any different,” cried Sami, almost wild.  His mother looked at him in terror, but she said nothing more. She seemed to hear her father saying: “It can’t be helped. He takes it from his grandfather.” And with a sigh she said:  “It will have to be so.”  Then there sounded from the bundle a strange peeping, exactly as if a chicken were smothering inside. “What have you put in the bundle, Sami?”  asked the mother, going towards it, to loosen the firmly tied apron.  “That’s so, I had almost forgotten it, mother,” replied Sami, wiping his eyes, “I have brought the little boy to you, I don’t know what to do with it.”  “Oh, how could you pack him up so! Yes, yes, you poor little thing,” said the grandmother soothingly, taking the diminutive Sami out of one wrapping and then a second and a third.  The father Sami had wrapped the little baby first in its clothes, then in a shawl,"]]]
