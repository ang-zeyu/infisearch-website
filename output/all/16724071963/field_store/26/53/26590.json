He was disappointed, too. For he was afraid he would have to go south to spend the winter, after all.     XI  THE MAIL-BOX   Climbing an oak at the cross-roads one day, not far from Farmer Green's house, Sandy Chipmunk discovered a queer box nailed to the trunk of the tree. Much as he wanted to, he couldn't look inside the box, because its lid was closed. And since Sandy was afraid the box might be some sort of trap, he didn't dare go near it and poke at the lid.  Later that day Sandy told Frisky Squirrel about the strange box. And Frisky told Fatty Coon. And Fatty Coon told somebody else.  So the news traveled, until at last it reached the sharp ears of old Mr. Crow.  By the time Mr. Crow heard the story it had grown amazingly. And it went something like this: Farmer Green had bought a new trap in the village. And he had nailed it on a tree to catch all sorts of animals and birds. And after he had caught all the forest-folk in Pleasant Valley he intended to take the trap to Swift River and set it for fish and eels and turtles.  When Mr. Crow heard the news he _haw-hawed_ loudly.  \"What are you laughing about?\" Jasper Jay asked him. (It was Jasper who repeated the story to Mr. Crow.) \"You wouldn't think it was such a joke if you were caught in the trap.\"  \"Trap!\" Mr. Crow sneered. \"That's no trap. That's what's called a _mail-box_. Every day a man with letters and newspapers drives over here from the village. And he stops at the cross-roads and leaves something in the box for Farmer Green.\"  As soon as he heard that, Jasper Jay flew away to tell everybody about the mail-box. And at last Sandy Chipmunk heard the story. But by the time it reached his ears--after it had been told by one person to another almost forty times--the story was somewhat different from what it had been when Mr. Crow first told it to Jasper Jay. This is what Sandy heard: The thing on the tree was a mailbox. Every day a man drove from the village in a wagon drawn by twelve horses. He had a load of letters as big as six haystacks. And he left a handful of letters in that box, because he wanted to get rid of them so he could go back to the village for more. And any one could take a letter--if it happened to be for him.  It was Frisky Squirrel who told the story to Sandy. Of course, after so much telling it had changed a good deal. But Sandy Chipmunk didn't know that. And he hurried to the cross-roads at once, to watch for the man driving the twelve horses.  When he reached the oak, where the box was, Sandy climbed the tree and perched himself on a limb and waited. He had not sat there long before he saw a man drive up the road. Sandy Chipmunk was surprised when the man stopped beneath the tree and dropped some letters and newspapers into the box. He was surprised because the man drove only one horse, instead of twelve. And the man had only a single bag of mail in his wagon, instead of a great heap--as big as six haystacks.  Sandy Chipmunk was somewhat disappointed. But he was glad of one thing: The man left the lid of the box open. And as soon as he had driven on again, Sandy crept down the tree and crawled right inside the mail-box.  Though he was not expecting a letter from anybody, he thought it would be just as well to look and see if the man had left one for him.  Now, Sandy had never learned to read. And you might think it would do him no good at all to look at the envelopes. But he soon came upon one which he was sure was his. And the reason for that was that he had found an envelope with the picture of a chipmunk in one corner of it!  That was enough for Sandy.  \"I'm glad I came!\" he said to himself. \"Here's a letter for me! And how surprised everybody will be!\"  So he took the letter in his mouth and started down the tree.  The very first person he surprised was Farmer Green himself. He had walked to the cross-roads from his house. And he had almost reached the oak when he saw Sandy Chipmunk spring from the tree to the stone wall, with a letter in his mouth, and scamper away.  Farmer Green ran after Sandy. And he threw stones at him. But Sandy Chipmunk ran so fast that Farmer Green soon lost sight of him.  \"I'd like to know what was in that letter,\" Farmer Green said, when he told his family what had happened. \"I'll have to warn the letter-carrier to be sure to close the mail-box after this, for I can't have any more of my letters stolen.\"  Johnnie Green couldn't help laughing, when he heard his father tell about the chipmunk running away with a letter in his mouth.  [Illustration: \"Here's a Letter for Me!\" Said Sandy Chipmunk]  But Farmer Green didn't seem to see anything to laugh at.  \"I only hope,\" he said, \"the letter was nothing of importance.\"     XII  SANDY GETS A LETTER   After Sandy Chipmunk, with the letter in his mouth, escaped from Farmer Green, he ran home and showed his letter to everybody he met. He felt very proud.  \"See!\" he said. \"There was a letter for me in the mail-box. It's lucky I found it when I did, for I believe Farmer Green would have taken it if I hadn't reached the box before him.\"  Old Mr. Crow laughed mockingly when Sandy called to him that he had a letter.  \"I see you _have_ one,\" Mr. Crow said. \"But the question is, to whom does it really belong? If the truth were known, I guess that letter rightfully belongs to a farmer named Green.\"  That remark made Sandy angry.  \"The letter belongs to me!\" he told Mr. Crow. \"Here's my picture on it. You can see for yourself.\"  Now, Mr. Crow could not read either--for all he was so old. And when he saw the picture of a chipmunk on the envelope, exactly like Sandy, he was very much surprised.  \"Why don't you open your letter?\" he asked.  \"I hadn't thought of that,\" Sandy replied. So he tore open the envelope and pulled out a paper.  \"It's certainly for me,\" he said, \"for here's my picture again. But I'd like to know why these other people have their pictures in _my_ letter. They've no business in _my_ letter!\"  Mr. Crow looked over Sandy's shoulder--which was not at all a polite thing to do.  \"That's queer!\" Mr. Crow exclaimed. \"There's one of the Red-Squirrel boys and Mrs. Mouse's son. And this young chap here looks a lot like Rinaldo Rat. ... I'd be pretty angry if anybody sent me a letter like that,\" Mr. Crow then said.  Now, the real trouble with Mr. Crow was that he was jealous because Sandy Chipmunk had a letter, while _he_ had none.  \"I'd throw that letter away, if it was mine,\" remarked Mr. Crow. And he said so much that at last Sandy Chipmunk tossed the letter away and went off to hunt for birds' eggs.  As soon as Sandy was out of sight, Mr. Crow picked up the letter and flew home with it.  He felt better--because at last he had a letter, while Sandy Chipmunk no longer had one.  That very afternoon Farmer Green drove to the village. And on his way he stopped at the houses of several of his neighbors, to talk about the weather and the crops. And each one of them showed him a letter that had come that day, telling all about a new kind of poison, to rid a farmer of chipmunks and red squirrels and rats and mice.  \"Sprinkle our powder around your corn-crib,\" the letter said, \"and these little rodents will trouble you no longer.\"  \"I declare!\" cried Farmer Green at last. \"I seem to be the only person in the neighborhood that didn't get one of those letters.\" Then he happened to remember the letter Sandy Chipmunk had carried away in his mouth. \"It must have been that letter that the chipmunk stole out of my mail-box!\" Farmer Green said. And that night, when he reached home and told his family about the letter, his son Johnnie laughed harder than ever.  \"That must be a wise chipmunk!\" Johnnie Green exclaimed. \"I wish I could catch him and put him in my squirrel cage.\"  \"I wish he'd leave my mail alone,\" said Farmer Green. \"The next thing we know, he'll be taking my newspaper to read. And maybe he'll come right into the house and borrow my spectacles.\"  Johnnie Green seemed to think his father was joking. And perhaps he was.  What do you think about it?     XIII  A RIDE TO THE MILLER'S   Do you know about the time Johnnie Green and his grandmother and Sandy Chipmunk started for the miller's with a sack of wheat to be ground? If you never heard the story, this is the way it happened--and if you _have_ heard it, it happened this way, just the same:  Farmer Green's wife had noticed that the flour in her flour-barrel was getting low. So one morning Farmer Green pulled a wagon from under a shed and set a big bag of wheat in it, behind the seat. Then he went into the house to get a piece of string with which to tie the bag. Farmer Green hadn't seen a pair of bright eyes that were watching him from the fence near-by. And he didn't know that as soon as he started to cross the barnyard, Sandy Chipmunk stole up to the wagon, climbed into it, and crept inside the open bag of wheat.  Now, Sandy had not had his breakfast. So he began at once to eat heartily of the wheat kernels, believing that after he had had a good meal it would be time enough to think of carrying some of the wheat away to his house. He only hoped that no one would take the bag away until he had removed _all_ the wheat. There was enough of it--he was sure--to last him for any number of winters.  Now, you must not think that Sandy was greedy, because he wanted all that wheat. He intended all the time to leave the _bag_ for Farmer Green.  The wheat tasted so good that Sandy Chipmunk could think of nothing else. So he never heard Johnnie Green's father when he came back from the house. And before Sandy knew what was happening, Farmer Green had reached into the wagon, drawn the mouth of the bag together, and tied it hard and fast.  There was Sandy Chipmunk, inside the bag. And he was so frightened that he couldn't eat "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9462"],["title","The Tale of Sandy Chipmunk (#5)"],["body","mouthful. He just shivered and shook, while Farmer Green went into the barn, led out an old, slow horse called Ebenezer, and harnessed him to the wagon.  Then Johnnie Green and his grandmother came out and seated themselves in the wagon. Farmer Green gave Johnnie the reins; and Ebenezer started jogging down the road toward the miller's, with Johnnie's old straw hat and his grandmother's sunbonnet bobbing from side to side, and up and down, and backwards and forwards, as the wagon jolted over ruts and stones and thank-you-ma'ams--which were small ridges built across the road, to turn the water into the ditch when it rained.  Cowering inside the bag, Sandy Chipmunk thought the earth was rocking, for he had never ridden in a wagon before.  Although the sack was a stout one, Sandy could easily have gnawed his way through it if he had not been too frightened to try. And there he stayed, while all the time old Ebenezer kept plodding along toward the grist-mill.  Johnnie Green and his grandmother, talking so near him, only alarmed Sandy all the more. And he thought he could not be more scared than he was. But all at once the wagon lurched forward and Grandmother Green screamed. And Johnnie began to cry \"Whoa! whoa!\" in a loud voice.  Then Sandy Chipmunk began to shake harder than ever. He had no idea what was happening.     XIV  A LUCKY ACCIDENT   It was really no wonder that Johnnie Green's grandmother screamed, when she and Johnnie and Sandy Chipmunk were on their way to the miller's to get the wheat ground into flour.  This was what made the good old lady scream: The ancient horse, Ebenezer, was picking his way slowly down a steep hill, placing one foot carefully in front of another, and taking pains not to step on the stones in the road, so he wouldn't fall.  What happened was not Ebenezer's fault at all. You see, he was wearing an old harness. And just as he was on the steepest part of the hill a strap broke and the wagon rolled right upon his heels.  Now, many horses would have kicked and run, if such a thing had happened to them. But even when Johnnie's grandmother screamed, old Ebenezer was not at all frightened. And even when Johnnie cried \"Whoa! whoa!\" Ebenezer did not stop. He thought he knew a good deal more about what he ought to do than Johnnie Green did, for he had been pulling a wagon for almost twenty years before Johnnie Green was born.  Johnnie tugged hard upon the reins. But still old Ebenezer went on picking his way even more slowly. And he never stopped until he reached the bottom of the hill. Then he stood stock still; and he looked around at Johnnie Green, as if to say, \"There, young man! I've brought you and your grandma safe down that hill. And _now_ I'll let you get out of the wagon, if you want to.\"  Well, Johnnie Green jumped down from his seat and looked at the harness.  \"Dear me!\" his grandmother said. \"If we only had a piece of string you could mend the harness so we could get to the miller's, at least.\"  Johnnie felt in all his pockets. And probably that was the first time he had ever found himself without plenty of string. There were enough other things in his pockets--a jackknife and nails, an apple and a lump of maple sugar, an old broken watch and a willow whistle. But not a single piece of string could Johnnie Green find.  Then he happened to think of the string his father had used to tie up the sack of wheat. Johnnie stood the sack on end, tipped it against the back of the seat, so the wheat wouldn't fall out, and unwound the string from the mouth of the bag.  He had hardly begun to tie the harness together when Grandmother Green screamed again.  The horse Ebenezer looked around once more, as if to say, \"I wonder what's come over the old lady.\"  And Johnnie Green turned his head, too.  \"My goodness!\" his grandmother said. \"Did you see that? Something ran right up my back and jumped off my shoulder. There it goes now!\" She pointed at a small object which was scurrying through the roadside fence. \"Why, it was a chipmunk, I do believe!\" she cried. \"Now, where do you suppose he came from?\"  Johnnie Green didn't know. And to tell the truth, he didn't much care. You see, he felt very proud, mending the harness with nobody to help him. And he was not interested in chipmunks just then.  So Sandy escaped. To be sure, he was so far from home that he didn't know where he was. But he was so glad to get out of the sack of wheat that he didn't worry about being lost. He thought he could find some one who would know where Farmer Green's pasture was.     XV  THE ROWDY OF THE WOODS   One of the most quarrelsome of all Sandy Chipmunk's neighbors was Rowdy Red-Squirrel. He was happiest when he was fighting. But perhaps that was because he had never lost a fight. If Rowdy had had a sound beating, maybe fighting would not have seemed so pleasant to him.  Ever since Rowdy whipped Frisky Squirrel, who (being a gray squirrel) was bigger than he was, Rowdy bullied every squirrel in the neighborhood--no matter what color he might be. As for chipmunks, Rowdy Red-Squirrel boasted that he could whip six chipmunks at a time.  \"That is, I could if they would stand still,\" he said. \"Of course, if they ran off in six different directions it might be a hard thing to do.\"  Rowdy was talking to Jasper Jay, who sat in a tree not far away. His boasting amused Jasper. First Jasper smiled. Then he laughed aloud. And after that he gave a hoarse shriek, which rang through the woods most unpleasantly. At least, that was what Rowdy Red-Squirrel thought.  \"What's the joke?\" he asked.  \"The joke?\" Jasper answered. \"Why--ha! ha!--_you_ are the joke! I don't believe you can whip _one_ chipmunk. And when you talk of whipping _six_, I can't help laughing.\"  \"You wouldn't laugh if I could catch you,\" Rowdy Red-Squirrel growled. And if he hadn't known that Jasper Jay would fly away, he would have jumped into Jasper's tree and chased him.  \"You mustn't expect me to believe you can whip _six_ until I've seen you whip _one_,\" Jasper went on. \"There's Sandy Chipmunk in that beech tree. Why don't you steal over there and show me whether you can whip him?\"  \"I'll do it!\" Rowdy cried. \"Not that I find much pleasure in fighting a single chipmunk--for I can whip _one_ with my hands tied behind me.\"  \"Can you?\" Jasper Jay asked. \"Then let me see you tie your hands.\"  \"I can't!\" Rowdy Red-Squirrel replied. \"Who ever heard of anybody who could tie his own hands behind him?... _You_ will have to do that for me,\" he said.  Jasper Jay gave another loud shriek and rocked back and forth on the limb where he sat.  \"Another joke!\" he gasped--for he was too clever to be caught like that. He had no idea of going near enough to Rowdy Red-Squirrel to tie his hands behind his back.  \"Well, I see I'll have to whip Sandy Chipmunk just as I am,\" Rowdy grumbled. \"It won't be much fun for me.\"  \"I don't believe it will,\" Jasper Jay agreed.  \"After I whip him, you'll have to find six more chipmunks for me, if you want to see me fight them all at once,\" Rowdy Red-Squirrel told Jasper Jay.  \"I'll do it--if you whip Sandy,\" Jasper promised. And he laughed so hard that he almost tumbled off the limb.     XVI  ROWDY RUNS AWAY   Rowdy Red-Squirrel jumped from one tree into another until he reached the beech tree in which Jasper Jay had caught sight of Sandy Chipmunk.  Now, Sandy had not seen Rowdy stealing upon him. And the first he knew about the fight was when he happened to turn around. Then he saw Rowdy Red-Squirrel right in front of him. And before Sandy could move, Rowdy had jumped straight at him.  Now, as you know, Sandy Chipmunk was not the most nimble of climbers. He was a ground-squirrel; and though he often climbed into the lower branches of trees, he always felt more comfortable on the top of a rail-fence or a stone wall.  But Rowdy Red-Squirrel could cling to the smallest branch. The more it swayed beneath his weight the better he liked it. His hardest battles had been fought in the tree-tops. You see, he was never the least bit afraid of falling.  Sandy Chipmunk was plucky--as you know. And at first he had no thought of running away, when Rowdy Red-Squirrel jumped at him. Even when Rowdy sank his sharp teeth into one of his ears, Sandy fought his hardest. But when Rowdy pulled on his ear, Sandy's feet almost slipped off the limb.  Then Sandy tried to get away. And at last he tore his ear out of Rowdy Red-Squirrel's mouth and scurried quickly to the ground.  Rowdy Red-Squirrel, dashing after him, shouted with glee.  \"He's running away from me! I've whipped him!\" he called to Jasper Jay, who had come nearer, to see the fight.  Sandy Chipmunk had reached the stone wall between the woods and the pasture. And he was still running. But the moment Rowdy Red-Squirrel sprang upon the wall, to his great surprise Sandy whisked around and jumped straight at _him_.  It was Rowdy's turn to be startled. And when Sandy gave his nose a cruel bite Rowdy turned tail and darted off as fast as he could go.  After him dashed Sandy Chipmunk. No longer was he afraid of falling. He was quite at home on the stone wall. He knew every stone in it, and every nook and cranny. He knew exactly the best way to run along that old wall. So all he had to think about now was catching Rowdy Red-Squirrel.  But Rowdy escaped. After he had run a long way he jumped into a tree and climbed to the very top of it, where Sandy Chipmunk did not care to follow him.  \"Come down here, if you want to fight,\" Sandy called to him.  \"You can't fool me,\" Rowdy answered. \"The _other six of you_ are hiding behind the wall. And the moment I came down you'd all jump at me again. I said I could whip _six_ chipmunks. But _seven_ are one too many.\"  Sandy Chipmunk didn't know what Rowdy was talking about. And he could not understand what made Jasper Jay laugh so loudly.  \"You played a trick on me!\" Rowdy told Jasper Jay. \"You had six chipmunks hidden behind that wall. And as soon as I came down where"]]]
