This he thought just right. He yodeled with satisfaction from the first ledge so lustily down into the valley that many of the sleepers in the Bath House below opened their eyes in amazement, then closed them again at once, for they recognized the sound and knew that they could have an hour longer to sleep, since the goat-boy always came so early. Meanwhile Moni climbed with his goats for an hour longer, farther and farther up to the high cliffs above.  The higher up he mounted, the broader and more beautiful became the view. From time to time he looked around him, then gazed up into the bright sky, which was becoming bluer and bluer, then began to sing with all his might, louder and louder and more merrily the higher he came:    \"Up yonder in the fir trees,   Sing the birds in a choir,   And after the rain comes,   Comes the sun like a fire.    \"And the sun and the stars   And the moon in the night,   The dear Lord has made them   To give us delight.    \"In the spring there are flowers--   They are yellow and gold,   And so blue is the sky then   My joy can't be told.    \"And in summer there are berries,   There are plenty if it's fine,   And the red ones and black ones,   I eat all from the vine.    \"If there are nuts in the bushes   I know what to do.   Where the goats like to nibble,   There I can hunt too.    \"And in winter I'm happy,   For weeping's in vain,   And, besides, the glad springtime   Will soon come again.\"   Now the height was reached where he usually stayed, and where he was going to remain for a while to-day. It was a little green table-land, with so broad a projection that one could see from the top all round about and far, far down into the valley. This projection was called the Pulpit-rock, and here Moni could often stay for hours at a time, gazing about him and whistling away, while his little goats quite contentedly sought their feed around him.  As soon as Moni arrived, he took his provision bag from his back, laid it in a little hole in the ground, which he had dug out for this purpose, then went to the Pulpit-rock and threw himself on the grass in order to enjoy himself fully.  The sky had now become a deep blue; above were the high mountains with peaks towering to the sky and great ice-fields appearing, and far away down below the green valley shone in the morning light. Moni lay there, looking about, singing and whistling. The mountain wind cooled his warm face, and as soon as he stopped whistling, the birds piped all the more lustily and flew up into the blue sky. Moni was indescribably happy. From time to time Mäggerli came to Moni and rubbed her head around on his shoulder, as she always did out of sheer affection. Then she bleated quite fondly, went to Moni's other side and rubbed her head on the other shoulder. The other goats also, first one and then another, came to look at their keeper and each had her own way of paying the visit.  The brown one, his own goat, came very cautiously and looked at him to see if he was all right, then she would stand and gaze at him until he said: \"Yes, yes, Braunli, it's all right, go and look for your fodder.\"  The young white one and Swallow, so called because she was so small and nimble and darted everywhere, like swallows into their holes, always rushed together upon Moni, so that they would have thrown him down, if he had not already been stretched out on the ground, and then they immediately, darted off again.  The shiny Blackie, the goat belonging to the landlord of the Bath House, Mäggerli's mother, was a little proud; she came only to within a few steps of Moni, looked at him with her head lifted, as if she wouldn't appear too familiar, and then went her way again. The big Sultan, the billy-goat, never showed himself but once, then he pushed away all he found near Moni, and bleated several times as significantly as if he had information to give about the condition of the flock, whose leader he felt himself to be.  Little Mäggerli alone never allowed herself to be crowded away from her protector; if the billy-goat came and tried to push her aside, she crept so far under Moni's arm or head that the big Sultan no longer came near her, and so under Moni's protection the little kid was not the least bit afraid of him. Otherwise she would have trembled if he came near her.  Thus the sunny morning had passed; Moni had already taken his midday meal and now stood thinking as he leaned on his stick, which he often needed there, for it was very useful in climbing up and down. He was thinking whether he would go up to a new side of the rocks, for he wanted to go higher this afternoon with the goats, but the question was, to which side? He decided to take the left, for in that direction were the three Dragon-stones, around which grew such tender shrubs that it was a real feast for the goats.  The way was steep, and there were dangerous places in the rugged wall of rock; but he knew a good path, and the goats were so sensible and did not easily go astray. He began to climb and all his goats gayly clambered after him, some in front, some behind him, little Mäggerli always quite close to him; occasionally he held her fast and pulled her along with him, when he came to a very steep place.  All went quite well and now they were at the top, and with high bounds the goats ran immediately to the green bushes, for they knew well the fine feed which they had often nibbled up here before.  \"Be quiet! Be quiet!\" commanded Moni, \"don't push each other to the steep places, for in a moment one of you might go down and have your legs broken. Swallow! Swallow! what are you thinking of?\" he called full of excitement, up to the goat, for the nimble Swallow had climbed up to the high Dragon-stones and was now standing on the outermost edge of one of them and looking quite impertinently down on him. He climbed up quickly, for only a single step more and Swallow would be lying below at the foot of the precipice. Moni was very agile; in a few minutes he had climbed up on the crag, quickly seized Swallow by the leg, and pulled her down.  \"Now come with me, you foolish little beast, you,\" scolded Moni, as he dragged Swallow along with him to the others, and held her fast for a while, until she had taken a good bite of a shrub and thought no more of running away.  \"Where is Mäggerli?\" screamed Moni suddenly, as he noticed Blackie standing alone in a steep place, and not eating, but quietly looking around her. The little young kid was always near Moni, or running after its mother.  \"What have you done with your little kid, Blackie?\" he called in alarm and sprang towards the goat. She seemed quite strange, was not eating, but stood still in the same spot and pricked up her ears inquiringly. Moni placed himself beside her and looked up and down. Now he heard a faint, pitiful bleating; it was Mäggerli's voice, and it came from below so plaintive and beseeching. Moni lay down on the ground and leaned over. There below something was moving; now he saw quite plainly, far down Mäggerli was hanging to the bough of a tree which grew out of the rock, and was moaning pitifully; she must have fallen over.  Fortunately the bough had caught her, otherwise she would have fallen into the ravine and met a sorry death. Even now if she could no longer hold to the bough, she would fall into the depths and be dashed to pieces.  In the greatest anguish he called down: \"Hold fast, Mäggerli, hold fast to the bough! See, I am coming to get you!\" But how could he reach there? The wall of rock was so steep here, Moni saw very well that it would be impossible to go down that way. But the little goat must be down there somewhere near the Rain-rock, the overhanging stone under which good protection was to be found in rainy weather; the goat-boys had always spent rainy days there, therefore the stone had been called from old times the Rain-rock. From there, Moni thought he could climb across over the rocks and so bring back the little kid.  He quickly whistled the flock together and went with them down to the place from which he could reach the Rain-rock. There he left them to graze and went to the rock. Here he immediately saw, just a little bit above him, the bough of the tree, and the kid hanging to it. He saw very well that it would not be an easy task to climb up there and then down again with Mäggerli on his back, but there was no other way to rescue her. He also thought the dear Lord would surely stand by him, and then he could not possibly fail. He folded his hands, looked up to heaven and prayed: \"Oh, dear Lord, help me, so that I can save Mäggerli!\"  Then he was full of trust that all would go well, and he bravely clambered up the rock until he reached the bough above. Here he clung fast with both feet, lifted the trembling, moaning little creature to his shoulders, and then climbed with great caution back down again. When he had the firm earth under his feet once more and had saved the terror-stricken kid, he was so glad he had to offer thanks aloud and cried up to heaven:  \"Oh, dear Lord, I thank Thee a thousand times for having helped us so well! Oh, we are both so glad for it!\" Then he sat down on the ground a little while, and stroked the kid, for she was still trembling in all her delicate limbs, and comforted her for enduring so much suffering.  As it was soon time for departure, Moni placed the little goat on his shoulders again, and said anxiously:  \"Come, you poor Mäggerli, you are still trembling; you cannot walk home to-day, I must carry you--\" and so he carried the little creature, clinging close to him, all the way down.  Paula was standing on the last rise in front of the Bath House, waiting for the goat-boy. Her aunt had accompanied her. When Moni came down with his burden on his back, Paula wanted to know if "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9383"],["title","Moni the Goat-Boy (#2)"],["body","kid was sick, and showed great interest. When Moni saw this, he at once sat down on the ground in front of Paula and told her his day's experience with Mäggerli.  The young lady showed very keen interest in the affair and stroked the little rescued creature, which now lay quietly in Moni's lap and looked very pretty, with its white feet, and the beautiful black pelt on its back. It was very willing to be stroked by her.  \"Now sing your song again for me, while you are sitting here,\" said Paula. Moni was in such a gay frame of mind that he willingly and heartily began and sang his whole song to the end.  This pleased Paula exceptionally well and she said he must sing it to her often again. Then the whole company went together down to the Bath House. Here the kid was laid in its bed, Moni said farewell, and Paula went back to her room to talk with her aunt longer about the goat-boy, whose merry morning song she had enjoyed again.     CHAPTER III  A VISIT   Thus many days passed by, one as sunny and clear as the other, for it was an unusually beautiful summer, and the sky remained blue and cloudless from morning till evening.  Every morning, early, without exception the goat-boy, singing lustily, went by the Bath House. Every evening he came back again singing lustily. All the guests were so accustomed to the merry sound that not one would have willingly missed it.  More than all the others, Paula delighted in Moni's joyfulness and went out almost every evening to meet him, and talk with him.  One sunny morning Moni had once more reached the Pulpit-rock, and was about to throw himself down, when he changed his mind. \"No, go on! The last time you had to leave all the nice little plants because we had to go after Mäggerli; now we will go up there again, so that you can finish nibbling them!\"  The goats all leaped with delight after him, for they knew they were going up to the lovely bushes on the Dragon-stones. To-day Moni held his little Mäggerli the whole time fast in his arms, pulled the sweet plants himself from the rocks and let her eat out of his hand. This pleased the little goat best of all. She rubbed her head quite contentedly from time to time against Moni's shoulder and bleated happily. So the whole morning passed, before Moni noticed, from his own hunger, that it had grown late before he was aware of it. But he had left his luncheon below near the Pulpit-rock, in the little hole, for he had intended to return again at noon.  \"Well, you have had your fill of good things, and I have had nothing,\" he said to his goats. \"Now I must have something too, and you will find enough more down below. Come along!\" Whereupon he gave a loud whistle, and the whole flock started away, the liveliest always ahead, and first of all light-footed Swallow, who was to meet something unexpected to-day. She sprang down from stone to stone and across many a cleft in the rocks, but all at once she could go no farther--directly in front of her suddenly stood a chamois and gazed with curiosity into her face. This had never happened to Swallow before! She stood still, looked questioningly at the stranger and waited for the chamois to get out of her way and let her leap to the boulder, as she intended. But the chamois did not stir and gazed boldly into Swallow's eyes. So they stood facing each other, more and more obstinate, and might have stood there until now, if the big Sultan had not come along in the meantime. As soon as he saw the state of things, he stepped quite considerately past Swallow and suddenly pushed the chamois aside so far and with such violence, that she had to make a daring leap, not to fall down over the rocks. Swallow went triumphantly on her way, and the Sultan marched proudly and contentedly behind her, for he felt himself to be the sure protector of the goats in his flock.  Meanwhile Moni coming down from above, and another goat-boy coming up from below, met at the same spot and looked at each other in astonishment. But they were well acquainted, and after the first surprise greeted each other cordially. It was Jörgli from Küblis. Half the morning he had been looking in vain for Moni and now he met him up here, where he had not expected to find him.  \"I didn't suppose you came up so high with the goats,\" said Jörgli.  \"To be sure I do,\" replied Moni, \"but not always; usually I stay by the Pulpit-rock and around there. Why have you come up here?\"  \"To make you a visit,\" was the reply. \"I have something to tell you. Besides, I have two goats here, that I am bringing to the landlord at the Baths. He is going to buy one, and so I thought I would come up to see you.\"  \"Are they your own goats?\" asked Moni.  \"Surely, they are ours. I don't tend strange ones any longer. I am not a goat-boy now.\"  Moni was very much surprised at this, for Jörgli had become the goat-boy of Küblis at the same time he had been made goat-boy of Fideris, and Moni did not understand how Jörgli could give it up without a single murmur.  Meanwhile the goat-boys and their flocks had reached the Pulpit-rock. Moni brought out bread and a small piece of dried meat and invited Jörgli to share his midday meal. They both sat down on the Pulpit-rock and ate heartily, for it had grown very late and they had excellent appetites. When everything was eaten and they had drunk a little goat's milk, Jörgli comfortably stretched himself at full length on the ground, and rested his head on both arms, but Moni remained sitting, for he always liked to look down into the deep valley below.  \"But what are you now, Jörgli, if you are no longer goat-boy?\" began Moni. \"You must be something.\"  \"Surely I am something, and something very good,\" replied Jörgli, \"I am egg-boy. Every day I carry eggs to all the hotels, as far as I can go; I come up here to the Bath House, too. Yesterday I was there.\"  Moni shook his head. \"That's nothing. I wouldn't be an egg-boy; I would a thousand times rather be goat-boy, it is much finer.\"  \"But why?\"  \"Eggs are not alive, you can't speak a word to them, and they don't run after you like the goats which are glad to see you when you come, and are fond of you, and understand every word you say to them; you can't have any pleasure with eggs as you can with the goats up here.\"  \"Yes, and you,\" interrupted Jörgli, \"what great pleasure do you have up here? Just now you have had to get up six times while we were eating, just on account of that silly kid, to prevent it from falling down below--is that a pleasure?\"  \"Yes, I like to do that! Isn't it so, Mäggerli? Come! Come here!\" Moni jumped up and ran after the kid, for it was making dangerous leaps for sheer joy. When he sat down again, Jörgli said:  \"There is another way to keep the young goats from falling over the rocks, without having to be always jumping after them, as you do.\"  \"What is it?\" asked Moni.  \"Drive a stick firmly into the ground and fasten the goat by the leg to it; she will kick furiously, but she can't get away.\"  \"You needn't think I would do any such thing to the little kid!\" said Moni quite angrily and drew Mäggerli to him and held her fast, as if to protect her from any such treatment.  \"You really won't have to take care of that one much longer,\" began Jörgli again. \"It won't come up here many times more.\"  \"What? What? What did you say, Jörgli?\" demanded Moni.  \"Bah, don't you know about it? The landlord will not raise her, she is too weak; there never was a more feeble goat. He wanted to sell her to my father, but he wouldn't have her either; now the landlord is going to have her killed next week, and then he will buy our spotted one.\"  Moni had become quite pale from terror. At first he couldn't speak a word; but now he broke out and complained aloud over the little kid:  \"No, no, that shall not be done, Mäggerli, it shall not be done. They shall not slay you, I can't bear that. Oh, I would rather die with you; no, that cannot be!\"  \"Don't do so,\" said Jörgli, angrily, and pulled Moni up, for in his grief he had thrown himself face down on the ground. \"Stand up, you know the kid really belongs to the landlord and he can do what he likes with her. Think no more about it! Come, I know something. See! See!\" Whereupon Jörgli held out one hand to Moni, and with the other almost covered the object, which Moni was to admire; it sparkled wonderfully in his hand, for the sun shone straight into it.  \"What is it?\" asked Moni, when it sparkled again, lighted up by a sunbeam.  \"Guess!\"  \"A ring?\"  \"No, but something like that.\"  \"Who gave it to you?\"  \"Gave it to me? Nobody. I found it myself.\"  \"Then it does not belong to you, Jörgli.\"  \"Why not? I didn't take it from anybody. I almost stepped on it with my foot, then it would have been broken; so I can just as well keep it.\"  \"Where did you find it?\"  \"Down by the Bath House, yesterday evening.\"  \"Then some one from the house below lost it. You must tell the landlord, and if you don't, I will do it this evening.\"  \"No, no, Moni, don't do that,\" said Jörgli, beseechingly. \"See, I will show you what it is, and I will sell it to a maid in one of the hotels, but she will surely have to give me four francs; then I will give you one or two, and nobody will know anything about it.\"  \"I will not take it! I will not take it!\" interrupted Moni, hotly, \"and the dear Lord has heard everything you have said.\"  [Illustration: \"_Jörgli had opened his band. In it lay a cross set with a large number of stones_.\"]  Jörgli looked up to the sky: \"Oh, so far away,\" he said skeptically; but he immediately began to speak more softly.  \"He hears you still,\" said Moni, confidently.  It was no longer Jörgli's secret. If he didn't know how to bring Moni to his side, all would be lost. He thought and thought.  \"Moni,\" he said suddenly, \"I will promise you something that will delight you, if you will not say anything to a human being about what I have found; you really don't need to take anything for it, then you will have nothing to do with"]]]
