[_Delighted Savery_. l. 254. The invention of the steam-engine for raising water by the pressure of the air in consequence of the condensation of steam, is properly ascribed to Capt. Savery; a plate and description of this machine is given in Harris's Lexicon Technicum, art. Engine. Though the Marquis of Worcester in his Century of Inventions printed in the year 1663 had described an engine for raising water by the explosive power of steam long before Savery's. Mr. Desegulier affirms, that Savery bought up all he could procure of the books of the Marquis of Worcester, and destroyed them, professing himself then to have discovered the power of steam by accident, which seems to have been an unfounded slander. Savery applied it to the raising of water to supply houses and gardens, but could not accomplish the draining of mines by it. Which was afterwards done by Mr. Newcomen and Mr. John Cowley at Dartmouth, in the year 1712, who added the piston.  A few years ago Mr. Watt of Glasgow much improved this machine, and with Mr. Boulton of Birmingham has applied it to variety of purposes, such as raising water from mines, blowing bellows to fuse the ore, supplying towns with water, grinding corn and many other purposes. There is reason to believe it may in time be applied to the rowing of barges, and the moving of carriages along the road. As the specific levity of air is too great for the support of great burthens by balloons, there seems no probable method of flying conveniently but by the power of steam, or some other explosive material; which another half century may probable discover. See additional notes, No. XI.]          \"The Giant-Power from earth's remotest caves      Lifts with strong arm her dark reluctant waves; 265  Each cavern'd rock, and hidden den explores,      Drags her dark coals, and digs her shining ores.--      Next, in close cells of ribbed oak confined,      Gale after gale, He crowds the struggling wind;      The imprison'd storms through brazen nostrils roar, 270  Fan the white flame, and fuse the sparkling ore.

Whose flinty teeth the golden harvests grind,      Feast without blood! and nourish human-kind.   [_Feast without blood!_ l. 278. The benevolence of the great Author of all things is greatly manifest in the sum of his works, as Dr. Balguy has well evinced in his pamphlet on Divine Benevolence asserted, printed for Davis, 1781. Yet if we may compare the parts of nature with each other, there are some circumstances of her economy which seem to contribute more to the general scale of happiness than others. Thus the nourishment of animal bodies is derived from three sources: 1. the milk given from the mother to the offspring; in this excellent contrivance the mother has pleasure in affording the sustenance to the child, and the child has pleasure in receiving it. 2. Another source of the food of animals includes seeds or eggs; in these the embryon is in a torpid or insensible state, and there is along with it laid up for its early nourishment a store of provision, as the fruit belonging to some seeds, and the oil and starch belonging to others; when these are consumed by animals the unfeeling seed or egg receives no pain, but the animal receives pleasure which consumes it. Under this article may be included the bodies of animals which die naturally. 3. But the last method of supporting animal bodies by the destruction of other living animals, as lions preying upon lambs, these upon living vegetables, and mankind upon them all, would appear to be a less perfect part of the economy of nature than those before mentioned, as contributing less to the sum of general happiness.]          \"Now his hard hands on Mona's rifted crest, 280  Bosom'd in rock, her azure ores arrest;      With iron lips his rapid rollers seize      The lengthening bars, in thin expansion squeeze;      Descending screws with ponderous fly-wheels wound      The tawny plates, the new medallions round; 285  Hard dyes of steel the cupreous circles cramp,      And with quick fall his massy hammers stamp.

Mr. Boulton has lately constructed at Soho near Birmingham, a most magnificent apparatus for Coining, which has cost him some thousand pounds; the whole machinery is moved by an improved steam-engine, which rolls the copper for half-pence finer than copper has before been rolled for the purpose of making money; it works the coupoirs or screw-presses for cutting out the circular pieces of copper; and coins both the faces and edges of the money at the same time, with such superior excellence and cheapness of workmanship, as well as with marks of such powerful machinery as must totally prevent clandestine imitation, and in consequence save many lives from the hand of the executioner; a circumstance worthy the attention of a great minister. If a civic crown was given in Rome for preserving the life of one citizen, Mr. Boulton should be covered with garlands of oak! By this machinery four boys of ten or twelve years old are capable of striking thirty thousand guineas in an hour, and the machine itself keeps an unerring account of the pieces struck.]          \"Soon shall thy arm, UNCONQUER'D STEAM! afar 290  Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car;      Or on wide-waving wings expanded bear      The flying-chariot through the fields of air.      --Fair crews triumphant, leaning from above,      Shall wave their fluttering kerchiefs as they move; 295  Or warrior-bands alarm the gaping crowd,      And armies shrink beneath the shadowy cloud.         \"So mighty HERCULES o'er many a clime      Waved his vast mace in Virtue's cause sublime,      Unmeasured strength with early art combined, 300  Awed, served, protected, and amazed mankind.--      First two dread Snakes at JUNO'S vengeful nod      Climb'd round the cradle of the sleeping God;      Waked by the shrilling hiss, and rustling sound,      And shrieks of fair attendants trembling round, 305  Their gasping throats with clenching hands he holds;      And Death untwists their convoluted folds.

[_So mighty Hercules_. l. 297. The story of Hercules seems of great antiquity, as appears from the simplicity of his dress and armour, a lion's skin and a club; and from the nature of many of his exploits, the destruction of wild beasts and robbers. This part of the history of Hercules seems to have related to times before the invention of the bow and arrow, or of spinning flax. Other stories of Hercules are perhaps of later date, and appear to be allegorical, as his conquering the river- god Achilous, and bringing Cerberus up to day light; the former might refer to his turning the course of a river, and draining a morass, and the latter to his exposing a part of the superstition of the times. The strangling the lion and tearing his jaws asunder, are described from a statue in the Museum Florentinum, and from an antique gem; and the grasping Anteus to death in his arms as he lifts him from the earth, is described from another antient cameo. The famous pillars of Hercules have been variously explained. Pliny asserts that the natives of Spain and of Africa believed that the mountains of Abyla and Calp√® on each side of the straits of Gibraltar were the pillars of Hercules; and that they were reared by the hands of that god, and the sea admitted between them. Plin. Hist. Nat. p. 46. Edit. Manut. Venet. 1609.  If the passage between the two continents was opened by an earthquake in antient times, as this allegorical story would seem to countenance, there must have been an immense current of water at first run into the Mediterranean from the Atlantic; since there is at present a strong stream sets always from thence into the Mediterranean. Whatever may be the cause, which now constantly operates, so as to make the surface of the Mediterranean lower than that of the Atlantic, it must have kept it very much lower before a passage for the water through the streights was opened. It is probable before such an event took place, the coasts and islands of the Mediterranean extended much further into that sea, and were then for a great extent of country, destroyed by the floods occasioned by the new rise of water, and have since remained beneath the sea. Might not this give rise to the flood of Deucalion? See note Cassia, V. II. of this work.]          \"Then, where Nemea's howling forests wave,      He drives the Lion to his dusky cave; 315  Seized by the throat the growling fiend disarms,      And tears his gaping jaws with sinewy arms;      Lifts proud ANTEUS from his mother-plains,      And with strong grasp the struggling Giant strains;      Back falls his fainting head, and clammy hair, 320  Writhe his weak limbs, and flits his life in air;--      By steps reverted o'er the blood-dropp'd fen      He tracks huge CACUS to his murderous den;      Where breathing flames through brazen lips he"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9612"],["title","The Botanic Garden (#6)"],["body","d,      And shakes the rock-roof'd cavern o'er his head.  325    \"Last with wide arms the solid earth He tears,      Piles rock on rock, on mountain mountain rears;      Heaves up huge ABYLA on Afric's sand,      Crowns with high CALP√à Europe's saliant strand,      Crests with opposing towers the splendid scene, 330  And pours from urns immense the sea between.--      --Loud o'er her whirling flood Charybdis roars,      Affrighted Scylla bellows round his shores,      Vesuvio groans through all his echoing caves,      And Etna thunders o'er the insurgent waves.  335    VII. 1.

[_Ethereal floods amass_. l. 335. The theory of the accumulation of the electric fluid by means of the glass-globe and cushion is difficult to comprehend. Dr. Franklin's idea of the pores of the glass being opened by the friction, and thence rendered capable of attracting more electric fluid, which it again parts with, as the pores contract again, seems analogous in some measure to the heat produced by the vibration, or condensation of bodies, as when a nail is hammered or filed till it becomes hot, as mentioned in additional Notes, No. VII. Some philosophers have endeavoured to account for this phenomenon by supposing the existence of two electric fluids which may be called the vitreous and resinous ones, instead of the plus and minus of the same ether. But its accumulation on the rubbed glass bears great analogy to its accumulation on the surface of the Leyden bottle, and can not perhaps be explained from any known mechanical or chemical principle. See note on Gymnotus. l. 202, of this Canto.]  [_Cold from each point_. l. 339. See additional note, No. XIII.]   345    \"YOU bid gold-leaves, in crystal lantherns held,      Approach attracted, and recede repel'd;      While paper-nymphs instinct with motion rife,      And dancing fauns the admiring Sage surprize.

Alluding to the very sensible electrometer improved by Mr. Bennett, it consists of two slips of gold- leaf suspended from a tin cap in a glass cylinder, which has a partial coating without, communicating with the wooden pedestal. If a stick of sealing wax be rubbed for a moment on a dry cloth, and then held in the air _at the distance of two or three feet_ from the cap of this instrument, the gold leaves seperate, such is its astonishing sensibility to electric influence! (See Bennet on electricity, Johnson, Lond.) The nerves of sense of animal bodies do not seem to be affected by less quantities of light or heat!]  [_The holy Halo_. l. 358. I believe it is not known with certainty at what time the painters first introduced the luminous circle round the head to import a Saint or holy person. It is now become a part of the symbolic language of painting, and it is much to be wished that this kind of hieroglyphic character was more frequent in that art; as it is much wanted to render historic pictures both more intelligible, and more sublime; and why should not painting as well as poetry express itself in metaphor, or in indistinct allegory? A truly great modern painter lately endeavoured to enlarge the sphere of pictorial language, by putting a demon behind the pillow of a wicked man on his death bed. Which unfortunately for the scientific part of painting, the cold criticism of the present day has depreciated; and thus barred perhaps the only road to the further improvement in this science.]          \"YOU crowd in coated jars the denser fire, 360  Pierce the thin glass, and fuse the blazing wire;      Or dart the red flash through the circling band      Of youths and timorous damsels, hand in hand.      --Starts the quick Ether through the fibre-trains      Of dancing arteries, and of tingling veins, 365  Goads each fine nerve, with new sensation thrill'd,      Bends the reluctant limbs with power unwill'd;      Palsy's cold hands the fierce concussion own,      And Life clings trembling on her tottering throne.--      So from dark clouds the playful lightning springs, 370  Rives the firm oak, or prints the Fairy-rings.   [_With new sensation thrill'd_. l. 365. There is probably a system of nerves in animal bodies for the purpose of perceiving heat; since the degree of this fluid is so necessary to health that we become presently injured either by its access or defect; and because almost every part of our bodies is supplied with branches from different pairs of nerves, which would not seem necessary for their motion alone: It is therefore probable, that our sensation of electricity is only of its violence in passing through our system by its suddenly distending the muscles, like any other mechanical violence; and that it is general pain alone that we feel, and not any sensation analogous to the specific quality of the object. Nature may seem to have been niggardly to mankind in bestowing upon them so few senses; since a sense to have perceived electricity, and another to have perceived magnetism might have been of great service to them, many ages before these fluids were discovered by accidental experiment, but it is possible an increased number of senses might have incommoded us by adding to the size of our bodies.]  [_Palsy's cold hands_. l. 367. Paralytic limbs are in general only incapable of being stimulated into action by the power of the will; since the pulse continues to beat and the fluids to be absorbed in them; and it commonly happens, when paralytic people yawn and stretch themselves, (which is not a voluntary motion,) that the affected limb moves at the same time. The temporary motion of a paralytic limb is likewise caused by passing the electric shock through it; which would seem to indicate some analogy between the electric fluid, and the nervous fluid, which is seperated from the blood by the brain, and thence diffused along the nerves for the purposes of motion and sensation. It probably destroys life by its sudden expansion of the nerves or fibres of the brain; in the same manner as it fuses metals and splinters wood or stone, and removes the atmosphere, when it passes from one object to another in a dense state.]  [_Prints the Fairy rings_. l. 370.

Dr. Richman Professor of natural philosophy at Petersburgh about the year 1763, elevated an insulated metallic rod to collect the aerial electricity, as Dr. Franklin had previously done at Philadelphia; and as he was observing the repulsion of the balls of his electrometer approached too near the conductor, and receiving the lightening in his head with a loud explosion, was struck dead amidst his family.]          3. \"YOU led your FRANKLIN to your glazed retreats,      Your air-built castles, and your silken seats; 385  Bade his bold arm invade the lowering sky,      And seize the tiptoe lightnings, ere they fly;      O'er the young Sage your mystic mantle spread,      And wreath'd the crown electric round his head.--      Thus when on wanton wing intrepid LOVE 390  Snatch'd the raised lightning from the arm of JOVE;      Quick o'er his knee the triple bolt He bent,      The cluster'd darts and forky arrows rent,      Snapp'd with illumin'd hands each flaming shaft,      His tingling fingers shook, and stamp'd, and laugh'd; 395  Bright o'er the floor the scatter'd fragments blaz'd,      And Gods retreating trembled as they gaz'd;      The immortal Sire, indulgent to his child,      Bow'd his ambrosial locks, and Heaven relenting smiled.

Dr. Franklin was the first that discovered that lightening consisted of electric matter, he elevated a tall rod with a wire wrapped round it, and fixing the bottom of a rod into a glass bottle, and preserving it from falling by means of silk- strings, he found it electrified whenever a cloud parted over it, receiving sparks by his finger from it, and charging coated phials. This great discovery taught us to defend houses and ships and temples from lightning, and also to understand, _that people are always perfectly safe in a room during a thunder storm if they keep themselves at three or four feet distance from the walls_; for the matter of lightning in passing from the clouds to the earth, or from the earth to the clouds, runs through the walls of a house, the trunk of a tree, or other elevated object; except there be some moister body, as an animal in"]]]
