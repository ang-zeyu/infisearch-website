The hush of the immense armament-- the glare of the torches, lighting the ebon faces and giant forms of their bearers--the majestic appearance of the king himself--the heroic aspect of Muza--the bare head and glittering banner of Almamen--all combined with the circumstances of the time to invest the spectacle with something singularly awful, and, perhaps, sublime.  Quexada turned his eyes, mutely, round the ghastly faces of his warriors, and still made not the signal.  His lips muttered--his eyes glared: when, suddenly, he heard below the wail of women; and the thought of Inez, the bride of his youth, the partner of his age, came upon him; and, with a trembling hand, he lowered the yet unquailing standard of Spain.  Then, the silence below broke into a mighty shout, which shook the grim tower to its unsteady and temporary base.  \"Arise, my friends,\" he said, with a bitter sigh; \"we have fought like men--and our country will not blush for us.\"  He descended the winding stairs--his soldiers followed him with faltering steps: the gates of the keep unfolded, and these gallant Christians surrendered themselves to the Moor.  \"Do with it as you will,\" said Quexada, as he laid the keys at the hoofs of Boabdil's barb; \"but there are women in the garrison, who--\"  \"Are sacred,\" interrupted the king.  \"At once we accord their liberty, and free transport whithersoever ye would desire.  Speak, then!  To what place of safety shall they be conducted?\"  \"Generous king!\" replied the veteran Quexada, brushing away his tears with the back of his hand; \"you take the sting from our shame.  We accept your offer in the same spirit in which it is made.  Across the mountains, on the verge of the plain of Olfadez, I possess a small castle, ungarrisoned and unfortified.  Thence, should the war take that direction, the women can readily obtain safe conduct to the queen at Cordova.\"  \"Be it so,\" returned Boabdil.  Then, with Oriental delicacy, selecting the eldest of the officers round him, he gave him instructions to enter the castle, and, with a strong guard, provide for the safety of the women, according to the directions of Quexada.  To another of his officers he confided the Spanish prisoners, and gave the signal to his army to withdraw from the spot, leaving only a small body to complete the ruin of the fortress.  Accompanied by Almamen and his principal officers, Boabdil now hastened towards Granada; and while, with slower progress, Quexada and his companions, under a strong escort, took their way across the Vega, a sudden turn in their course brought abruptly before them the tower they had so valiantly defended.  There it still stood, proud and stern, amidst the blackened and broken wrecks around it, shooting aloft, dark and grim, against the sky.  Another moment, and a mighty crash sounded on their ears, while the tower fell to the earth, amidst volumes of wreathing smoke and showers of dust, which were borne, by the concussion to the spot on which they took their last gaze of the proudest fortress on which the Moors of Granada had beheld, from their own walls, the standard of Arragon and Castile.  At the same time, Leila--thus brought so strangely within the very reach of her father and her lover, and yet, by a mysterious fate, still divided from both,--with Donna Inez, and the rest of the females of the garrison, pursued her melancholy path along the ridges of the mountains.     CHAPTER II.  ALMAMEN'S PROPOSED ENTERPRISE.--THE THREE ISRAELITES--CIRCUMSTANCE IMPRESSES EACH CHARACTER WITH A VARYING DIE.  Boadbil followed up his late success with a series of brilliant assaults on-the neighbouring fortresses.  Granada, like a strong man bowed to the ground, wrenched one after one the bands that had crippled her liberty and strength; and, at length, after regaining a considerable portion of the surrounding territory, the king resolved to lay siege to the seaport of Salobrena.  Could he obtain this town, Boabdil, by establishing communication between the sea and Granada, would both be enabled to avail himself of the assistance of his African allies, and also prevent the Spaniards from cutting off supplies to the city, should they again besiege it.  Thither, then, accompanied by Muza, the Moorish king bore his victorious standard.  On the eve of his departure, Almamen sought the king's presence.  A great change had come over the canton since the departure of Ferdinand; his wonted stateliness of mien was gone; his eyes were sunk and hollow; his manner disturbed and absent.  In fact, his love for his daughter made the sole softness of his character; and that daughter was in the hands of the king who had sentenced the father to the tortures of the Inquisition! To what dangers might she not be subjected, by the intolerant zeal of conversion! and could that frame, and gentle heart, brave the terrific engines that might be brought against her fears?  \"Better,\" thought he, \"that she should perish, even by the torture, than adopt that hated faith.\"  He gnashed his teeth in agony at either alternative.  His dreams, his objects, his revenge, his ambition--all forsook him: one single hope, one thought, completely mastered his stormy passions and fitful intellect.  In this mood the pretended santon met Boabdil.  He represented to the king, over whom his influence had prodigiously increased since the late victories of the Moors, the necessity of employing the armies of Ferdinand at a distance.  He proposed, in furtherance of this policy, to venture himself in Cordova; to endeavour secretly to stir up those Moors, in that, their ancient kingdom, who had succumbed to the Spanish yoke, and whose hopes might naturally be inflamed by the recent successes of Boabdil; and, at least, to foment such disturbances as might afford the king sufficient time to complete his designs, and recruit his force by aid of the powers with which he was in league.  The representations of Almamen at length conquered Boabdil's reluctance to part with his sacred guide; and it was finally arranged that the Israelite should at once depart from the city.  As Almamen pursued homeward his solitary way, he found himself suddenly accosted in the Hebrew tongue.  He turned hastily, and saw before him an old man in the Jewish gown: he recognised Elias, one of the wealthiest and most eminent of the race of Israel.  \"Pardon me, wise countryman!\" said the Jew, bowing to the earth, \"but I cannot resist the temptation of claiming kindred with one through whom the horn of Israel may be so triumphantly exalted.\"  \"Hush, man!\" said Almamen, quickly, and looking sharply round; \"I thy countryman!  Art thou not, as thy speech betokens, an Israelite?\"  \"Yea,\" returned the Jew, \"and of the same tribe as thy honoured father-- peace be with his ashes!  I remembered thee at once, boy though thou wert when thy steps shook off the dust against Granada.  I remembered thee, I say, at once, on thy return; but I have kept thy secret, trusting that, through thy soul and genius, thy fallen brethren might put off sackcloth and feast upon the house-tops.\"  Almamen looked hard at the keen, sharp, Arab features of the Jew; and at length he answered, \"And how can Israel be restored? wilt thou fight for her?\"  \"I am too old, son of Issachar, to bear arms; but our tribes are many, and our youth strong.  Amid these disturbances between dog and dog--\"  \"The lion may get his own,\" interrupted Almamen, impetuously,--\"let us hope it.  Hast thou heard of the new persecutions against us that the false Nazarene king has already commenced in Cordova--persecutions that make the heart sick and the blood cold?\"  \"Alas!\" replied Elias, \"such woes indeed have not failed to reach mine ear; and I have kindred, near and beloved kindred, wealthy and honoured men, scattered throughout that land.\"  \"Were it not better that they should die on the field than by the rack?\" exclaimed Almamen, fiercely.  \"God of my fathers! if there be yet a spark of manhood left amongst thy people, let thy servant fan it to a flame, that shall burn as the fire burns the stubble, so that the earth may bare before the blaze!\"  \"Nay,\" said Elias, dismayed rather than excited by the vehemence of his comrade,--\"be not rash, son of Issachar, be not rash: peradventure thou wilt but exasperate the wrath of the rulers, and our substance thereby will be utterly consumed.\"  Almamen drew back, placed his hand quietly on the Jew's shoulder, looked him hard in the face, and, gently laughing, turned away.  Elias did not attempt to arrest his steps.  \"Impracticable,\" he muttered; \"impracticable and dangerous!  I always thought so.  He may do us harm: were he not so strong and fierce, I would put my knife under his left rib.  Verily, gold is a great thing; and--out on me! the knaves at home will be wasting the oil, now they know old Elias is abroad.\"  Thereat the Jew drew his cloak around him, and quickened his pace.  Almamen, in the meanwhile, sought, through dark and subterranean passages, known only to himself, his accustomed home.  He passed much of the night alone; but, ere the morning star announced to the mountain tops the presence of the sun, he stood, prepared for his journey, in his secret vault, by the door of the subterranean passages, with old Ximen beside him.  \"I go, Ximen,\" said Almamen, \"upon a doubtful quest: whether I discover my daughter, and succeed in bearing her in safety from their contaminating grasp, or whether I fall into their snares and perish, there is an equal chance that I may return no more to Granada.  Should this be so, you will be heir to such wealth as I leave in these places I know that your age will be consoled for the lack of children when your eyes look upon the laugh of gold.\"  Ximen bowed low, and mumbled out some inaudible protestations and thanks. Almamen sighed heavily as he looked round the room.  \"I have evil omens in my soul, and evil prophecies in my books,\" said he, "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9759"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book IV. (#2)"],["body","mournfully.  \"But the worst is here,\" he added, putting his finger significantly to his temples; \"the string is stretched--one more blow would snap it.\"  As he thus said, he opened the door and vanished through that labyrinth of galleries by which he was enabled at all times to reach unobserved either the palace of the Alhambra or the gardens without the gates of the city.  Ximen remained behind a few moments in deep thought.  \"All mine if he dies!\" said he: \"all mine if he does not return!  All mine, all mine! and I have not a child nor a kinsman in the world to clutch it away from me!\"  With that he locked the vault, and returned to the upper air.     CHAPTER III.  THE FUGITIVE AND THE MEETING  In their different directions the rival kings were equally successful. Salobrena, but lately conquered by the Christians, was thrown into a commotion by the first glimpse of Boabdil's banners; the populace rose, beat back their Christian guards, and opened the gates to the last of their race of kings.  The garrison alone, to which the Spaniards retreated, resisted Boabdil's arms; and, defended by, impregnable walls, promised an obstinate and bloody siege.  Meanwhile, Ferdinand had no sooner entered Cordova than his extensive scheme of confiscation and holy persecution commenced.  Not only did more than five hundred Jews perish in the dark and secret gripe of the Grand Inquisitor, but several hundred of the wealthiest Christian families, in whose blood was detected the hereditary Jewish taint, were thrown into prison; and such as were most fortunate purchased life by the sacrifice of half their treasures.  At this time, however, there suddenly broke forth a formidable insurrection amongst these miserable subjects--the Messenians of the Iberian Sparta.  The Jews were so far aroused from their long debasement by omnipotent despair, that a single spark, falling on the ashes of their ancient spirit, rekindled the flame of the descendants of the fierce warriors of Palestine.  They were encouraged and assisted by the suspected Christians, who had been involved in the same persecution; and the whole were headed by a man who appeared suddenly amongst them, and whose fiery eloquence and martial spirit produced, at such a season, the most fervent enthusiasm.  Unhappily, the whole details of this singular outbreak are withheld from us; only by wary hints and guarded allusions do the Spanish chroniclers apprise us of its existence and its perils.  It is clear that all narrative of an event that might afford the most dangerous precedent, and was alarming to the pride and avarice of the Spanish king, as well as the pious zeal of the Church, was strictly forbidden; and the conspiracy was hushed in the dread silence of the Inquisition, into whose hands the principal conspirators ultimately fell.  We learn, only, that a determined and sanguinary struggle was followed by the triumph of Ferdinand, and the complete extinction of the treason.  It was one evening, that a solitary fugitive, hard chased by an armed troop of the brothers of St. Hermandad, was seen emerging from a wild and rocky defile, which opened abruptly on the gardens of a small, and, by the absence of fortification and sentries, seemingly deserted, castle. Behind him; in the exceeding stillness which characterises the air of a Spanish twilight, he heard, at a considerable distance the blast of the horn and the tramp of hoofs.  His pursuers, divided into several detachments, were scouring the country after him, as the fishermen draw their nets, from bank to bank, conscious that the prey they drive before the meshes cannot escape them at the last.  The fugitive halted in doubt, and gazed round him: he was well-nigh exhausted; his eyes were bloodshot; the large drops rolled fast down his brow; his whole frame quivered and palpitated, like that of a stag when he stands at bay.  Beyond the castle spread a broad plain, far as the eye could reach, without shrub or hollow to conceal his form: flight across a space so favourable to his pursuers was evidently in vain.  No alternative was left unless he turned back on the very path taken by the horsemen, or trusted to such scanty and perilous shelter as the copses in the castle garden might afford him.  He decided on the latter refuge, cleared the low and lonely wall that girded the demesne, and plunged into a thicket of overhanging oaks and chestnuts.  At that hour, and in that garden, by the side of a little fountain, were seated two females: the one of mature and somewhat advanced years; the other, in the flower of virgin youth.  But the flower was prematurely faded; and neither the bloom, nor sparkle, nor undulating play of feature, that should have suited her age, was visible in the marble paleness and contemplative sadness of her beautiful countenance.  \"Alas! my young friend,\" said the elder of these ladies, \"it is in these hours of solitude and calm that we are most deeply impressed with the nothingness of life.  Thou, my sweet convert, art now the object, no longer of my compassion, but my envy; and earnestly do I feel convinced of the blessed repose thy spirit will enjoy in the lap of the Mother Church.  Happy are they who die young! but thrice happy they who die in the spirit rather than the flesh: dead to sin, but not to virtue; to terror, not to hope; to man, but not to God!\"  \"Dear senora,\" replied the young maiden, mournfully, \"were I alone on earth, Heaven is my witness with what deep and thankful resignation I should take the holy vows, and forswear the past; but the heart remains human, however divine the hope that it may cherish.  And sometimes I start, and think of home, of childhood, of my strange but beloved father, deserted and childless in his old age.\"  \"Thine, Leila,\" returned the elder Senora, \"are but the sorrows our nature is doomed to.  What matter, whether absence or death sever the affections?  Thou lamentest a father; I, a son, dead in the pride of his youth and beauty--a husband, languishing in the fetters of the Moor. Take comfort for thy sorrows, in the reflection that sorrow is the heritage of all.\"  Ere Leila could reply, the orange-boughs that sheltered the spot where they sat were put aside, and between the women and the fountain stood the dark form of Almamen the Israelite.  Leila rose, shrieked, and flung herself, unconscious, on his breast.  \"O Lord of Israel!\" cried Almamen, in atone of deep anguish.  \"I, then, at last regain my child?  Do I press her to my heart? and is it only for that brief moment, when I stand upon the brink of death?  Leila, my child, look up! smile upon thy father; let him feel, on his maddening and burning brow, the sweet breath of the last of his race, and bear with him, at least, one holy and gentle thought to the dark grave.\"  \"My father! is it indeed my father?\" said Leila, recovering herself, and drawing back, that she might assure herself of that familiar face; \"it is thou!  it is--it is!  Oh! what blessed chance brings us together?\"  \"That chance is the destiny that hurries me to my tomb,\" answered Almamen, solemnly.  \"Hark! hear you not the sound of their rushing steeds--their impatient voices?  They are on me now!\"  \"Who?  Of whom speakest thou?\"  \"My pursuers--the horsemen of the Spaniard.\"  \"Oh, senora, save him!\" cried Leila, turning to Donna Inez, whom both father and child had hitherto forgotten, and who now stood gazing upon Almamen with wondering and anxious eyes.  \"Whither can he fly?  The vaults of the castle may conceal him.  This way-hasten!\"  \"Stay,\" said Inez, trembling, and approaching close to Almamen: \"do I see aright? and, amidst the dark change of years and trial, do I recognise that stately form, which once contrasted to the sad eye of a mother the drooping and faded form of her only son?  Art thou not he who saved my boy from the pestilence, who accompanied him to the shores of Naples, and consigned him to these arms?  Look on me! dost thou not recall the mother of thy friend?\"  \"I recall thy features dimly and as in a dream,\" answered the Hebrew; \"and while thou speakest, there rush upon me the memories of an earlier time, in lands where Leila first looked upon the day, and her mother sang to me at sunset by the stream of the Euphrates, and on the sites of departed empires.  Thy son--I remember now: I had friendship then with a Christian--for I was still young.\"  \"Waste not the time--father--senora!\" cried Leila, impatiently clinging still to her father's breast.  \"You are right; nor shall your sire, in whom I thus wonderfully recognise my son's friend, perish if I can save him.\"  Inez then conducted her strange guest to a small door in the rear of the castle; and after leading him through some of the principal apartments, left him in one of the tiring-rooms adjoining her own chamber, and the entrance to which the arras concealed.  She rightly judged this a safer retreat than the vaults of the castle might afford, since her great name and known intimacy with Isabel would preclude all suspicion of her abetting in the escape of the fugitive, and keep those places the most secure in which, without such aid, he could not have secreted himself.  In a few minutes, several of the troop arrived at the castle, and on learning the name of its owner contented themselves with searching the gardens, and the lower and more exposed apartments; and then recommending to the servants a vigilant look-out remounted, and proceeded to scour the plain, over which now slowly fell the starlight and shade of night.  When Leila stole, at last, to the room in which Almamen was hid, she found him, stretched on his mantle, in a deep sleep.  Exhausted by all he had undergone, and his rigid nerves, as it were, relaxed by the sudden softness of that interview with his child, the slumber of that fiery wanderer was as calm as an infant's.  And their relation almost seemed reversed; and the daughter to be as a mother watching over her offspring, when Leila seated"]]]
