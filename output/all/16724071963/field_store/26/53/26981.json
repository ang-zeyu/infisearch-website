Spare my life!\" he exclaimed, hastily stepping back.  \"I see you don't know me, Uncle Paul?\" said the intruder, familiarly.  \"Who are you that call me Uncle Paul?\" asked the old man, somewhat reassured.  \"Benjamin Haley, your sister's son. Do you know me now?\"  \"You Ben Haley!\" exclaimed the old man, betraying surprise. \"Why, you are old enough to be his father.\"  \"Remember, Uncle Paul, I am eighteen years older than when you saw me last. Time brings changes, you know. When I saw you last, you were a man in the prime of life, now you are a feeble old man.\"  \"Are you really Ben Haley?\" asked the old man, doubtfully.  \"To be sure I am. I suppose I look to you more like a bearded savage. Well, I'm not responsible for my looks. Not finding you at home, I took the liberty of coming in on the score of relationship.\"  \"What, were you doing with that candle?\" asked Paul, suspiciously.  \"I went down cellar with it.\"  \"Down cellar!\" repeated his uncle, with a look of alarm which didn't escape his nephew. \"What for?\"  \"In search of something to eat. All I could find in the closet was a dry loaf, which doesn't look very appetizing.\"  \"There's nothing down cellar. Don't go there again,\" said the old man, still uneasy.  His nephew looked at him shrewdly.  \"Ha, Uncle Paul! I've guessed your secret so quick,\" he said to himself. \"Some of your money is hidden away in the cellar, I'm thinking.\"  \"Where do you keep your provisions, then?\" he said aloud.  \"The loaf is all I have.\"  \"Come, Uncle Paul, you don't mean that. That's a scurvy welcome to give a nephew you haven't seen for eighteen years. I'm going to stay to dinner with you, and you must give me something better than that. Haven't you got any meat in the house?\"  \"No.\"  Just then Ben Haley, looking from the window, saw some chickens in the yard. His eye lighted up at the discovery.  \"Ah, there is a nice fat chicken,\" he said. \"We'll have a chicken dinner. Shall it be roast or boiled?\"  \"No, no,\" said the old farmer, hastily. \"I can't spare them. They'll bring a good price in the market by and by.\"  \"Can't help it, Uncle Paul. Charity begins at home. Excuse me a minute, I'll be back directly.\"  He strode to the door and out into the yard. Then, after a little maneuvering, he caught a chicken, and going to the block, seized the ax, and soon decapitated it.  \"What have you done?\" said Paul, ruefully, for the old man had followed his nephew, and was looking on in a very uncomfortable frame of mind.  \"Taken the first step toward a good dinner,\" said the other, coolly. \"I am not sure but we shall want two.\"  \"No, no!\" said Paul, hastily. \"I haven't got much appetite.\"  \"Then perhaps we can make it do. I'll just get it ready, and cook it myself. I've knocked about in all sorts of places, and it won't be the first time I've served as cook. I've traveled some since I saw you last.\"  \"Have you?\" said the old man, who seemed more interested in the untimely death of the pullet than in his nephew's adventures.  \"Yes, I've been everywhere. I spent a year in Australia at the gold diggings.\"  \"Did you find any?\" asked his uncle, for the first time betraying interest.  \"Some, but I didn't bring away any.\"  Ben Haley meanwhile was rapidly stripping the chicken of its feathers. When he finished, he said, \"Now tell me where you keep your vegetables, Uncle Paul?\"  \"They're in the corn barn. You can't get in. It's locked.\"  \"Where's the key?\"  \"Lost.\"  \"I'll get in, never fear,\" said the intruder, and he led the way to the corn barn, his uncle unwillingly following and protesting that it would be quite impossible to enter.  Reaching the building, he stepped back and was about to kick open the door, when old Paul hurriedly interposed, saying, \"No, no, I've found the key.\"  His nephew took it from his hand, and unlocking the door, brought out a liberal supply of potatoes, beets and squashes.  \"We'll have a good dinner, after all,\" he said. \"You don't half know how to live, Uncle Paul. You need me here. You've got plenty around you, but you don't know how to use it.\"  The free and easy manner in which his nephew conducted himself was peculiarly annoying and exasperating to the old man, but as often as he was impelled to speak, the sight of his nephew's resolute face and vigorous frame, which he found it difficult to connect with his recollections of young Ben, terrified him into silence, and he contented himself with following his nephew around uneasily with looks of suspicion.  When the dinner was prepared both sat down to partake of it, but Ben quietly, and, as a matter of course, assumed the place of host and carved the fowl. Notwithstanding the shock which his economical notions had received, the farmer ate with appetite the best meal of which he had partaken for a long time. Ben had not vaunted too highly his skill as a cook. Wherever he had acquired it, he evidently understood the preparation of such a dinner as now lay before them.  \"Now, Uncle Paul, if we only had a mug of cider to wash down the dinner. Haven't you got some somewhere?\"  \"Not a drop.\"  \"Don't you think I might find some stored away in the cellar, for instance?\" asked Ben, fixing his glance upon his uncle's face.  \"No, no; didn't I tell you I hadn't got any?\" returned Paul Nichols, with petulance and alarm.  \"I mean to see what else you have in the cellar,\" said Ben, to himself, \"before I leave this place. There's a reason for that pale face of yours.\" But he only said aloud, \"Well, if you haven't got any we must do without it. There's a little more of the chicken left. As you don't want it I'll appropriate it. Nothing like clearing up things. Come, this is rather better than dry bread, isn't it?\"  \"It's very expensive,\" said the miser, ruefully.  \"Well, you can afford it, Uncle Paul--there's a comfort in that. I suppose you are pretty rich, eh?\"  \"Rich!\" repeated Paul, in dismay. \"What put such a thing into your head?\"  \"Not your style of living, you may be sure of that.\"  \"I am poor, Benjamin. You mustn't think otherwise. I live as well as I can afford.\"  \"Then what have you been doing with your savings all these years?\"  \"My savings! It has taken all I had to live. There isn't any money to be made in farming. It's hard work and poor pay.\"  \"You used to support your family comfortably when you had one.\"  \"Don't--don't speak of them. I can't bear it,\" said Paul, his countenance changing. \"When I had them I was happy.\"  \"And now you're not. Well, I don't wonder at it. It must be dismal enough living alone. You need somebody with you. I am your nephew and nearest relation. I feel that it is my duty to stay with you.\"  The expression of dismay which overspread the old man's face at this declaration was ludicrous.  \"You stay with me?\" he repeated, in a tone of alarm.  \"Yes, for a time at least. We'll be company for each other, won't we, Uncle Paul?\"  \"No, no; there's no room.\"  \"No room? You don't mean to say that you need the whole house?\"  \"I mean I cannot afford to have you here. Besides I'm used to being alone. I prefer it.\"  \"That's complimentary, at any rate. You prefer to be alone rather than to have me with you?\"  \"Don't be offended, Benjamin. I've been alone so many years. Besides you'd feel dull here. You wouldn't like it.\"  \"I'll try it and see. What room are you going to give me?\"  \"You'd better go away.\"  \"Well, uncle, we'll talk about that to-morrow. You're very considerate in fearing it will be dull for me, but I've roamed about the world so much that I shall be glad of a little dullness. So it's all settled. And now, Uncle Paul, if you don't object I'll take out my pipe and have a smoke. I always smoke after dinner.\"  He lit his pipe, and throwing himself back in a chair, began to puff away leisurely, his uncle surveying him with fear and embarrassment. Why should his graceless nephew turn up, after so many years, in the form of this big, broad-shouldered, heavy-bearded stranger, only to annoy him, and thrust his unwelcome company upon him?     CHAPTER X.   UNCLE AND NEPHEW.  Paul Nichols looked forward with dismay to the prospect of having his nephew remain with him as a guest. Like all misers, he had a distrust of every one, and the present appearance of his nephew only confirmed the impressions he still retained of his earlier bad conduct. He had all the will to turn him out of his house, but Ben was vastly his superior in size and strength, and he did not dare to attempt it.  \"He wants to rob, perhaps to murder me,\" thought Paul, surveying his big nephew with a troubled gaze.  His apprehensions were such that he even meditated offering to pay the intruder's board for a week at the tavern, if he would leave him in peace by himself. But the reluctance to part with his money finally prevented such a proposal being made.  In the afternoon the old man stayed around home. He did not dare to leave it lest Ben should take a fancy to search the house, and come upon some of his secret hoards, for people were right in reporting that he hid his money.  At last evening came. With visible discomposure the old man showed Ben to a room.  \"You can sleep there,\" he said, pointing to a cot bed in the corner of the room.  \"All right, uncle. Good-night!\"  \"Good-night!\" said Paul Nichols.  He went out and closed the door behind him. He not only closed it, but locked it, having secretly hidden the key in his pocket. He chuckled softly to himself as he went downstairs. His nephew was securely disposed of for the night, being fastened in his chamber. But if he expected Ben Haley quietly to submit to this incarceration he was entirely mistaken in that individual. The latter heard the key turn in the lock, and comprehended at once his uncle's stratagem. Instead of being angry, he was amused.  \"So my simple-minded uncle thinks he has drawn my teeth, does he? I'll give him a scare.\"  He began to jump up and down on "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9990"],["title","Brave and Bold; Or, The Fortunes of Robert Rushton (#8)"],["body","chamber floor in his heavy boots, which, as the floor was uncarpeted, made a terrible noise. The old man in the room below, just congratulating himself on his cunning move, grew pale as he listened. He supposed his nephew to be in a furious passion, and apprehensions of personal violence disturbed him. Still he reflected that he would be unable to get out, and in the morning he could go for the constable. But he was interrupted by a different noise. Ben had drawn off his boots, and was firing them one after the other at the door.  The noise became so intolerable, that Paul was compelled to ascend the stairs, trembling with fear.  \"What's the matter?\" he inquired at the door, in a quavering voice.  \"Open the door,\" returned Ben.  His uncle reluctantly inserted the key in the lock and opening it presented a pale, scared face in the doorway. His nephew, with his coat stripped off, was sitting on the side of the bed.  \"What's the matter?\" asked Paul.  \"Nothing, only you locked the door by mistake,\" said Ben, coolly.  \"What made you make such a noise?\" demanded Paul.  \"To call you up. There was no bell in the room, so that was the only way I had of doing it. What made you lock me in?\"  \"I didn't think,\" stammered the old man.  \"Just what I supposed. To guard against your making that mistake again, let me have the key.\"  \"I'd rather keep it, if it's the same to you,\" said Paul, in alarm.  \"But it isn't the same to me. You see, Uncle Paul, you are growing old and forgetful, and might lock me in again. That would not be pleasant, you know, especially if the house should catch fire in the night.\"  \"What!\" exclaimed Paul, terror-stricken, half suspecting his nephew contemplated turning incendiary.  \"I don't think it will, mind, but it's best to be prepared, so give me the key.\"  The old man feebly protested, but ended in giving up the key to his nephew.  \"There, that's all right. Now I'll turn in. Good-night.\"  \"Good-night,\" responded Paul Nichols, and left the chamber, feeling more alarmed than ever. He was beginning to be more afraid and more distrustful of his nephew than ever. What if the latter should light on some of his various hiding places for money? Why, in that very chamber he had a hundred dollars in gold hidden behind the plastering. He groaned in spirit as he thought of it, and determined to tell his nephew the next morning that he must find another home, as he couldn't and wouldn't consent to his remaining longer.  But when the morning came he found the task a difficult one to enter upon. Finally, after breakfast, which consisted of eggs and toast, Ben Haley having ransacked the premises for eggs, which the old man intended for the market, Paul said, \"Benjamin, you must not be offended, but I have lived alone for years, and I cannot invite you to stay longer.\"  \"Where shall I go, uncle?\" demanded Ben, taking out his pipe coolly, and lighting it.  \"There's a tavern in the village.\"  \"Is there? That won't do me any good.\"  \"You'll be better off there than here. They set a very good table, and----\"  \"You don't,\" said Ben, finishing the sentence. \"I know that, but then, uncle, I have two reasons for preferring to stay here. The first is, that I may enjoy the society of my only living relation; the second is, that I have not money enough to pay my board at the hotel.\"  He leaned back, and began to puff leisurely at his pipe, as if this settled the matter.  \"If you have no money, why do you come to me?\" demanded Paul, angrily. \"Do you expect me to support you?\"  \"You wouldn't turn out your sister's son, would you, Uncle Paul?\"  \"You must earn your own living. I can't support you in idleness.\"  \"You needn't; I'll work for you. Let me see, I'll do the cooking.\"  \"I don't want you here,\" said the old man, desperately. \"Why do you come to disturb me, after so many years?\"  \"I'll go away on one condition,\" said Ben Haley.  \"What's that?\"  \"Give me, or lend me--I don't care which--a hundred dollars.\"  \"Do you think I'm made of money?\" asked Paul, fear and anger struggling for the mastery.  \"I think you can spare me a hundred dollars.\"  \"Go away! You are a bad man. You were a wild, bad boy, and you are no better now.\"  \"Now, Uncle Paul, I think you're rather too hard upon me. Just consider that I am your nephew. What will people say if you turn me out of doors?\"  \"I don't care what they say. I can't have you here.\"  \"I'm sorry I can't oblige you by going, Uncle Paul, but I've got a headache this morning, and don't feel like stirring. Let me stay with you a day or two, and then I may go.\"  Vain were all the old man's expostulations. His nephew sat obstinately smoking, and refused to move.  \"Come out to the barn with me while I milk,\" said Paul, at length, not daring to leave his nephew by himself.  \"Thank you, but I'm well off as I am. I've got a headache, and I'd rather stay here.\"  Milking couldn't longer be deferred. But for the stranger's presence it would have been attended to two hours earlier. Groaning in spirit, and with many forebodings, Paul went out to the barn, and in due time returned with his foaming pails. There sat his nephew in the old place, apparently not having stirred. Possibly he didn't mean mischief after all, Paul reflected. At any rate, he must leave him again, while he released the cows from their stalls, and drove them to pasture. He tried to obtain his nephew's companionship, but in vain.  \"I'm not interested in cows, uncle,\" he said. \"I'll be here when you come back.\"  With a sigh his uncle left the house, only half reassured. That he had reason for his distrust was proved by Ben Haley's movements. He lighted a candle, and going down to the cellar, first securing a pickax, struck into the earthen flooring, and began to work energetically.  \"I am sure some of the old man's money is here,\" he said to himself. \"I must work fast, or he'll catch me at it.\"  Half an hour later Paul Nichols re-entered the house. He looked for his nephew, but his seat was vacant. He thought he heard a dull thud in the cellar beneath. He hurried to the staircase, and tottered down. Ben had come upon a tin quart-measure partly filled with gold coins, and was stooping over, transferring them to his pocket.  With a hoarse cry like that of an animal deprived of its young, his uncle sprang upon him, and fastened his claw-like nails in the face of his burly nephew.     CHAPTER XI.   ROBERT COMES TO THE RESCUE.  The attack was so sudden, and the old man's desperation so reinforced his feeble strength, that Ben Haley was thrown forward, and the measure of gold coins fell from his hand. But he quickly recovered himself.  \"Let me alone,\" he said, sternly, forcibly removing his uncle's hands from his face, but not before the claw-like nails had drawn blood. \"Let me alone, if you know what is best for yourself.\"  \"You're a thief!\" screamed Paul. \"You shall go to jail for this.\"  \"Shall I?\" asked Ben, his face darkening and his tone full of menace. \"Who is going to send me there?\"  \"I am,\" answered Paul. \"I'll have you arrested.\"  \"Look here, Uncle Paul,\" said Ben, confining the old man's arms to his side, \"it's time we had a little talk together. You'd better not do as you say.\"  \"You're a thief! The jail is the place for thieves.\"  \"It isn't the place for me, and I'm not going there. Now let us come to an understanding. You are rich and I am poor.\"  \"Rich!\" repeated Paul.  \"Yes; at any rate, you have got this farm, and more money hidden away than you will ever use. I am poor. You can spare me this money here as well as not.\"  \"It is all I have.\"  \"I know better than that. You have plenty more, but I will be satisfied with this. Remember, I am your sister's son.\"  \"I don't care if you are,\" said the old man, doggedly.  \"And you owe me some help. You'll never miss it. Now make up your mind to give me this money, and I'll go away and leave you in peace.\"  \"Never!\" exclaimed Paul, struggling hard to free himself.  \"You won't!\"  His uncle repeated the emphatic refusal.  \"Then I shall have to put it out of your power to carry out your threat.\"  He took his uncle up in his strong arms, and moved toward the stairs.  \"Are you going to murder me?\" asked Paul, in mortal fear.  \"You will find out what I am going to do,\" said Ben, grimly.  He carried his uncle upstairs, and, possessing himself of a clothesline in one corner of the kitchen, proceeded to tie him hand and foot, despite his feeble opposition.  \"There,\" said he, when his uncle lay before him utterly helpless, \"I think that disposes of you for a while. Now for the gold.\"  Leaving him on the floor, he again descended the cellar stairs, and began to gather up the gold coins, which had been scattered about the floor at the time of Paul's unexpected attack.  The old man groaned in spirit as he found himself about to be robbed, and utterly helpless to resist the outrage. But help was near at hand, though he knew it not. Robert Rushton had thought more than once of his unknown passenger of the day before, and the particular inquiries he made concerning Paul Nichols and his money. Ben Haley had impressed him far from favorably, and the more he called to mind his appearance, the more he feared that he meditated some dishonest designs upon Paul. So the next morning, in order to satisfy his mind that all was right, he rowed across to the same place where he had landed Ben, and fastening his boat, went up to the farmhouse. He reached it just as Ben, having secured the old man, had gone back into the cellar to gather up the gold.  Robert looked into the window, and, to his surprise, saw the old farmer lying bound hand and foot. He quickly leaped in, and asked:  \"What is the matter? Who has done this?\"  \"Hush!\" said the old man, \"he'll hear you.\"  \"Who do you mean?\"  \"My nephew.\"  \"Where is he?\"  \"Down cellar. He's tied me here, and is stealing all my gold.\"  \"What shall I do? Can I help you?\"  \"Cut the ropes first.\"  Robert drew a jackknife from his pocket, and did as he was bidden.  \""]]]
