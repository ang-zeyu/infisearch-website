What a wild country it must be!\"  \"Dear, darling, jolly old place!\" said Kitty, dancing up and down.  \"And you really give me to understand that people make remarks on one another in that sort of fashion?\" said Alice, darting away from her companion and pouring some water into a basin to wash her hands.  \"Well, yes, love, they do when they like, and they don't when they don't like. We are free and easy folk, I can tell you, and we have a gay time. I'll tell you all about father and the old castle, and the dogs, and the cows, and the cats, and the rabbits, and the mice when we have a spare moment. That brother of yours, Fred, is not half a bad old chap; and I saw a nice, curly-headed little gossoon coming in just now with his books under his arm. What's his name?\"  \"Oh, you mean Philip. Yes, he's the youngest; he's well enough if you don't spoil him, Kitty.\"  \"I won't spoil him, bless his heart,\" said Kitty; \"but of course I'll make friends with him. I couldn't live without boys. There are two at home, Pat and Laurence; and, oh! I shall miss Laurie, dear old chap! I must not think of him.\" Kitty's face underwent a swift change, the brightness went out of it just as if a heavy cloud had swept away the sun; the big, very handsome dark-blue eyes, so dark as to be almost black, grew full of sudden tears; the exquisitely curved lips trembled; she turned her head aside and looked out of the window.  At that moment it seemed to Alice that she saw beneath Kitty's wild, eccentric manners a heart of gold. She only caught a glimpse of it, for the next moment the girl was chatting away in the most light, frivolous, extraordinary style. The dinner-bell sounded through the house, and the pair went down to dinner.  \"I'd like to sit near you, please, Mr. Denvers,\" said Kitty.  Philip's place was always near his father; this had been a custom ever since he had been a baby. Kitty now ensconced herself in the little boy's chair.  \"Am I taking anybody's seat?\" she asked, looking up.  \"Only mine,\" said Phil.  \"Never mind, little gossoon; you shall have it to-morrow. I want to sit near Mr. Denvers because I expect he can tell me a good many things I don't understand.\"  \"You must allow me to eat my dinner, Miss Malone. You see I have a good deal of carving to do, and besides I am a busy man,\" said Mr. Denvers in a good-humored voice, for it was difficult to resist the roguish glances of Kitty's eyes, and the sort of affectionate way in which she cuddled up to her host's side.  \"Oh, I won't talk _over_ much,\" she said, glancing with her flashing eyes round at the entire party. \"But you see I am quite a stranger; and, oh my! the place does seem lonely. You are all so stiff, I cannot quite understand it. Is it the English fashion, please, Mr. Denvers?\"  \"Well, you see,\" answered Mrs. Denvers from the other end of the table, \"we don't know you yet.\"  \"But I am sure all the same we shall be very good friends,\" said Mr. Denvers. \"May I give you a glass of wine?\"  \"Wine! Bless you, I'm a teetotaller,\" said Kitty. \"Why, it isn't habits of intoxication you'll be putting into me. I never take anything but water, or milk when I can get it; and it isn't Miss Malone you're going to call me is it, for if it is I tell you frankly that I'll die entirely. I must be Kitty from this moment, or Kitty Malone, or anything of that sort, but Kitty something it must be. Now, is it settled fair and square, Kitty shall I be? Here's my hand on my heart; I'll die if I'm called Miss Malone!\"  Fred burst into roars of laughter.  \"I say,\" he cried, \"what an extraordinary girl you are!\"  \"Well, and so are you an extraordinary boy,\" said Kitty. \"Oh, dear me, I am hungry! Do you mind handing me over the potatoes? Why, you don't mean to say you peel 'em. I never heard of such a thing! Why don't you have them in their jackets?\"  \"Potatoes are generally mashed or peeled or something of that sort in England,\" said Mr. Denvers. \"I see, Kitty--\" he added.  \"Ah! bless you now for calling me that! What is it you want to say, dear Mr. Denvers?\"  \"I see we shall have a good deal to teach you,\" he said, and then he too burst into a fit of laughter, and so the merry, somewhat rollicking meal proceeded.  Alice alone would not succumb to the fascinations of the Irish maiden. She sat holding herself somewhat stiff, feeling a good deal disgusted, wondering what Bessie Challoner would say, what Gwin Harley would think, anticipating in advance Elma's sneers.  Kitty, however, subjugated Mr. and Mrs. Denvers and the two boys completely. As to Pointer, he would not leave her side; as her long, white, taper fingers touched the top of his grizzled head, he looked at her with eyes of unutterable love.  \"What have you done to the dog?\" said Fred at last. He felt almost afraid, in his great admiration of the bewitching stranger.  \"Only given him a taste of blarney,\" was the reply. \"Tell me now, Fred, were you ever in Ireland?\"  \"No,\" answered Fred.  \"Ah! I thought as much. If you had been, and if you had kissed the Blarney Stone, why then, it's nothing could withstand you.\"  \"What is the Blarney Stone?\" asked Fred.  \"Don't you know that much? Why you are an ignoramus out and out. Well, I'll tell you. It's a stone on Blarney Castle, set low down in the wall, five or six feet from the top; and to kiss it, why that is no easy matter, for you have to be held by your heels and let hang over the wall; and if you can get some one to hold you tight--very tight, mind--you slide down and you reach the stone and you kiss it, and from that moment--oh glory! but you carry everything before you. There's not a man, a woman, nor a child, no, nor a beastie either, that can resist you. You bewitch 'em.\"  \"I have no doubt, Kitty, you kissed the stone,\" said Mr. Denvers.  \"Why then, it's yes, sir,\" she answered raising her big eyes and then dropping them again with an inimitable expression.  \"What a queer little girl you are!\" he said. \"You are very amusing; but I think we must tame you a bit.\"  \"You won't do that, sir. They call me the wild Irish girl at home, and the wild Irish girl I'll be to the end of the chapter. If it's schooling I want, why, I'll have it, but taming, no thank you.\"  Kitty jumped from her seat and began to dance a sort of improvised Irish jig about the room.  \"Do you know the jig?\" she said, dancing up to Fred as she spoke.  \"No,\" he answered; \"are you trying it on now?\"  \"Yes; jump up, my hearty, and I'll teach you in a twinkling. Here, watch me; point your toes so, turn round--pirouette as we call it. Now, then, put your hand on your hip, courtesy to me, and come back again. That's how it's done. Oh, Fred, I'll soon have you as beautiful a broth of a boy as if you were born in Old Ireland.\"  \"Fred, my son, it is time for you to go back to college,\" said his father. \"Kitty, we are very pleased to have you here, and you are a very amusing girl; but you know life is not all play.\"  Kitty pulled a long face. Fred darted a laughing glance at her, and ran off. Kitty and Alice at last found themselves alone.  \"You're disapproving of me a good bit, aren't you, Alice?\" said Kitty, going up to the other girl and taking both her hands in hers.  \"Well, I think you are very odd,\" said Alice.  \"And do you want me to be quite sober and tame, and to have all the spirit knocked out me, alanna?\"  \"No; but we don't do exactly as you do in this country.\"  \"And you think you'll tame me into your cut-and-dry pattern?\"  \"I don't know about that. I don't understand you, Kitty.\"  \"You will after a bit, Alice. It's here I am for sure, and a gray sort of land it is! Why, the sun doesn't even shine!\"  \"Oh, doesn't it,\" said Alice angrily. \"It's ridiculous to talk in that strain about this country. We have much finer weather than you have in Ireland.\"  \"Don't be cross, darling; I mean it metaphorically. You see we live a gay life over there, we have a joke about everything, and the wit that runs out of our mouths--why, it's like flashes of lightning. Oh, we have a good time in the old country, and when you come and stay with me at Castle Malone you'll say so for yourself. Now, then, what do you want to do this afternoon?\"  \"I must look over my lessons first.\"  \"Lessons--how many?\"  \"A good few. You see of course I want to get on.\"  \"By the way, Alice,\" said Mrs. Denvers, who came into the room at that moment, \"I am afraid you had a bad mark for unpunctuality this morning.\"  \"Yes, mother, that is so.\"  \"And what is your place in form?\"  \"I went down two or three places, mother.\"  \"I am sorry to hear it; your father will be very much annoyed.\"  \"I'll try and make up for it to-morrow, mother. And, mother, Gwin Harley has asked me to go to tea with her this afternoon--may I?\"  \"I don't see how you can. There is Kitty Malone.\"  \"But she has asked Kitty too.\"  \"What's that?\" asked Kitty, bounding forward. \"A tea party, bless you?\"  \"You have been asked to tea at Harley Grove. Mother, may we go? I think Kitty would enjoy it.\"  \"If you are sure you are not too tired, Kitty; you have had a long journey,\" said Mrs. Denvers.  \"I'm not a scrap tired,\" said Kitty. \"I'm as gay as a lark and as fresh as a daisy. I hope it's rather a big swell party, for I have got some awfully pretty dresses. I want to make myself look smart. You can tell me how they manage these sort of things in England. I'm all agog to go.\"  \"Yes, Alice, you may go,\" said Mrs. Denvers. \"But Kitty, my dear, if I were you I would let them down lightly.\"  \"What do you mean, dear Mrs. Denvers?\"  \"Don't startle them too much. They are not accustomed to such--such frankness as you are disposed to give.\"  \"I'll bewitch 'em,\" said Kitty, beginning again to dance with light fantastic measure up and down the room. \"I'll bewitch 'em one and all. I have made up my mind. I didn't kiss the Blarney"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9986"],["title","Wild Kitty (#3)"],["body"," for nothing!\"     CHAPTER III.  IS THAT THE GIRL?   Kitty and Alice went up to their bedroom, where Kitty began to unpack her trunks and toss her dresses about--they were all new and most of them were gay. She had scarcely a quiet-looking dress in the entire collection.  \"What will you do with those?\" said Alice, who saw nothing to admire in the fantastic clothes, and much to condemn. Alice had not the smallest love for dress, and at this period of her life she considered any pains taken over clothes a sheer waste of time.  \"But don't you like them?\" said Kitty. \"I thought girls loved pretty dress. Aunt Honora says so, and so did Aunt Bridget when she came to see us at Castle Malone a month ago. When she heard I was going to England she said: 'Why, then, my dear Kitty, you must titivate up. It will never do for them to see you not looking as bright as a sunbeam and as gay as a cricket. It's colors you'll want, Kitty, and rich materials, and spangles, and jewels, and beads, and all the other fal-lals.' And father said to Aunt Bridget:  \"'Why then, now, Biddy,' said he, 'you just get what's right for the child, for she hasn't a notion, and no more have I, what's worn in that foreign place England.'  \"So Aunt Bridget said: 'A wink's as good as a word,' and I'll dress her up in dashing style!' So she took the measure of my chest, and the round of my waist, and the length of my skirt, and she saw how many inches I wanted in the sleeve, and she said: 'You leave the rest to me, Kitty.' And of course I did, and in three weeks' time down came a trunk that would make your eyes shine even to look within it. Oh! wasn't it just the darling entirely! Here's one of the dresses. Now, what do you think of that?\"  As Kitty spoke she pulled out a pink nun's-veiling, made up with innumerable ruffles and frills and laces and embroidery, a really very pretty dress for quite a gay party, but totally unsuitable for a schoolgirl of Kitty Malone's age.  \"Why, it's a long dress?\" said Alice. \"How old are you, Kitty?\"  \"It's fifteen I'll be my next birthday, darling. Well, and is there anything wrong about fifteen? I always thought it was a jewel of an age.\"  \"Yes, but this dress is long; why, there's a train to it!\"  \"Oh, mercy me! so there is,\" said Kitty. \"To tell you the truth, I never even tried on the skirt, I was so bamboozled and overexcited with the others. A train to be sure! Oh, won't I bewitch 'em entirely. Let me try it on, darling. Have you got a long looking-glass anywhere?\"  \"Not in this room,\" answered Alice; \"it is not necessary.\"  \"Not necessary? Well, now, I should say it's the one thing you ought to have in every room, a long looking-glass that you can see yourself in from top to toe. Why, half your elegance is lost if you cannot see how you look your own self. Is there one in any other room?\"  \"In mother's dressing-room, I think.\"  \"And where's that room situated, my jewel?\" asked Kitty.  \"Oh, at the other end of the passage; but really, Kitty--\"  Kitty, however, was off. Alice stayed in her room, too disgusted to follow her.  \"Something must be done to put a stop to this,\" she thought. \"Of course, mother won't keep a girl of that sort. Why, she's a regular wild Indian; I shall be ashamed to take her out this afternoon.\"  But at that moment a high voice, accompanied by peals of laughter, was heard shouting for Alice.  \"Alice, mavourneen, come along this minute! Alice, come quick! quick! Why, it's enthralling I am! You never saw anything like me before, did you? Oh, the Blarney Stone, what it has done for me. Come, Alice, come, come quick!\"  \"What can be the matter?\" called Mrs. Denvers from downstairs. \"Has anything happened?\"  \"Oh, it's only me, dear Mrs. Denvers. Do come up this minute, my dear ducky woman, and see me. I found a dress with a train to it in my trunk, a new dress from Dublin, and I'm in it, and beautiful I look. Come up and see me. I'm gazing at myself in your glass. I never saw anything so lovely in the whole course of my life.\"  Mrs. Denvers and Alice now both appeared upon the scene. Kitty in her new dress, with a train nearly a foot on the ground, was stepping backward and forward before the long glass in Mrs. Denvers' wardrobe. Her eyes were flashing with merriment and delight. Her small arched feet were dancing a _pas de seul_ in and out of the many flounces which befrilled the end of the pink dress.  \"Well, do you like it?\" called Kitty. \"How do you think I look? Did you ever see anybody more elegant in all your born days? Oh, if only the dear old dad could see me! I feel as if I must kiss myself.\" Here she commenced blowing kisses vigorously at the gay figure reflected in the glass.  \"Come, Kitty,\" said Mrs. Denvers, \"you are not going out in that dress.\"  \"And why not, my dear Mrs. Denvers? Why shouldn't I go out and captivate the natives? That's what a pretty girl is made for.\"  \"Not in this country,\" said Mrs. Denvers in a somewhat severe voice. \"It cannot be done; Kitty, you are much too young to wear a dress of that sort. While you are with me you must expect to be guided by my taste and wishes.\"  \"But, dear Mrs. Denvers, Aunt Bridget ordered it.\"  \"Well, of course, dear, you can wear it at Castle Malone, but not here--at least, not out of doors. Yes, my child, it is a very pretty dress; but I do understand what is right for girls to appear in. You must have something quieter, Kitty.\"  \"Then come along and choose for me,\" said Kitty, who was as good-natured as she was high-spirited and volatile. \"Come straight and choose, for Alice, poor child, is troubled with the sulks.\"  \"What do you mean?\" said Alice indignantly.  \"But isn't it true, darling; you have such a frown between your brows, and it doesn't improve you. There, cheer up, Alice, honey! Why, it's the best of friends I want to be with you; but you don't like me, not a bit. I'll win you yet, Alice, aroon! But at the present moment you're saying in your heart: 'What a nasty, forward, ill-bred girl that is, and I am ashamed, that I am, that my schoolfellows should see me with the likes of her.'\"  \"Come, come, Kitty, no more of this,\" said Mrs. Denvers. \"If you are going out you have no time to lose. Yes, let me see your wardrobe. I think this dark-blue dress is the best.\"  \"But you are not expecting me to go out in the open air without a body!\" said Kitty, \"and there's nothing but a skirt to this. I suppose I may wear one of my pretty blouses?\"  \"Yes; that skirt and a nice blouse will do. Now then, get ready, both of you, as quickly as you can. Kitty, remember I expect your things to be put away tidily.\"  \"To be sure, ma'am. Why, then, it would be a shame to spoil all these pretty garments. I'll put them away in a jiffy, and come down looking as neat as a new pin.\"  Alice, who had brushed out her hair, put on a clean collar and a pair of cuffs, was now standing waiting for her friend.  \"Look here,\" she said suddenly, \"will you be long putting away your things and dressing?\"  \"Not very long, darling; but I must curl my fringe over again.\"  \"I wish you wouldn't wear a fringe, Kitty; none of the nice girls do at the school.\"  \"Is it give up my fringe I would?\" answered Kitty.  \"What a show I'd be! Why, look at my forehead, it's too high for the lines of pure beauty. Now, when the fringe comes down just to here, why, it's perfect. Aunt Bridget said it was, and she's a rare judge, I can tell you. She was a beauty in her youth, one of the Dublin beauties; and you can't go to any city for fairer women than are to be found in Dublin. I tell you what it is, Alice, I see you are in a flurry to be off. Can I overtake you?\"  \"You can,\" said Alice suddenly. \"You can come to me at Bessie Challoner's house.\"  \"Bessie Challoner!--what a pretty name!--Challoner! I like that!\" answered Kitty, looking thoughtful. \"And where's her house, aroon? What part of the neighborhood is it situated in?\"  \"Come here to the window and I'll show you. When you leave this house you turn to the right and walk straight on until you come to Cherry Lodge--that's the name of the house. Bessie and I will be waiting for you.\"  \"Well, then, off you go, and I won't keep you many minutes.\"  Alice ran out of the room. She found her mother waiting for her downstairs.  \"Oh, mother,\" said Alice, \"she's too dreadful.\"  \"Come now, no whispering about me behind my back,\" called a gay voice over the stairs. \"I thought it would be something of that sort. That's not fair--out with your remarks in front of me, and nothing behind.\"  \"Kitty, Kitty, go back and dress, you incorrigible child!\" called Mrs. Denvers.  \"Mother!\" said Alice.  \"My dear Alice,\" said her mother, \"you will soon learn to like that poor child. She has a great deal that is good in her, and then she is so pretty.\"  \"Pretty?\" muttered Alice. \"Oh, I see you're bewitched like the rest of them.\"  She left the house, feeling more uncomfortable, depressed, and angry than she had done for several years.  Mr. Denvers was a lawyer, and made a fairly good income; but his large family and the education of his boys had strained his resources to such an extent that he was very glad to accept the liberal sum which Kitty's father was paying for her. Alice knew all about this, and at first was more than willing to help her family in every way in her power. She did not murmur at all when she was asked to give up half of her room to the Irish girl. She was quite willing to take her under her patronage, to show her round, to try to get friends for her among her own schoolfellows--in short, to make her happy. But then Alice had never pictured any one in the least like Kitty Malone. She had imagined a somewhat plain, shy, awkward girl, who would lean upon her, who would give her unbounded affection, and follow her lead in everything. Now, this sparkling, racy, daring Kitty was by no means to her mind. There was not the least doubt that Kitty would not be guided by anybody, that she would never play second fiddle, and there was also a"]]]
