Now, between you and me, mister, what did she lend you on that bit o' stuff?\"  \"Three pounds fifteen,\" replied Lauriston.  \"That's about it,\" assented Melky, with a nod. He leaned a little nearer. \"You don't want to sell the ticket?\" he suggested. \"Give you a couple o' quid for it, if you do.\"  \"You seem very anxious to buy that watch,\" said Lauriston, laughing. \"No--I don't want to sell the ticket--not I! I wouldn't part with that watch for worlds.\"  \"Well, if you don't, you don't,\" remarked Melky. \"And as to wanting to buy--that's my trade. I ain't no reg'lar business--I buy and sell, anything that comes handy, in the gold and silver line. And as you ain't going to part with that ticket on no consideration, I'll tell you what it's worth, old as it is. Fifteen quid!\"  \"That's worth knowing, any way,\" said Lauriston. \"I shall always have something by me then, while I have that. You'd have made a profit of a nice bit, then, if I'd sold it to you?\"  \"It 'ud be a poor world, mister, if you didn't get no profit, wouldn't it?\" assented Melky calmly. \"We're all of us out to make profit. Look here!--between you and me--you're a lit'ry gent, ain't you? Write a bit, what? Do you want to earn a fiver--comfortable?\"  \"I should be very glad,\" replied Lauriston.  \"There's a friend o' mine,\" continued Melky, \"wholesale jeweller, down Shoreditch way, wants to get out a catalogue. He ain't no lit'ry powers, d'you see? Now, he'd run to a fiver--cash down--if some writing feller 'ud touch things up a bit for him, like. Lor' bless you!--it wouldn't take you more'n a day's work! What d'ye say to it?\"  \"I wouldn't mind earning five pounds at that,\" answered Lauriston.  \"Right-oh!\" said Melky. \"Then some day next week, I'll take you down to see him--he's away till then. And--you'll pay me ten per cent. on the bit o' business, won't you, mister? Business is business, ain't it?\"  \"All right!\" agreed Lauriston. \"That's a bargain, of course.\"  Melky nodded and turned to his steak, and Lauriston presently left him and went away. The plump lady at the desk gave him a smile as she handed him his change.  \"Hope to see you again, sir,\" she said.  Lauriston went back to his room, feeling that the world had changed. He had paid his landlady, he had silver and copper in his pocket, he had the chance of earning five pounds during the coming week--and he expected a cheque for his two stories by every post. And if John Purdie made him the loan he had asked for, he would be able to devote a whole month to finishing his novel--and then, perhaps, there would be fame and riches. The dismal November evening disappeared in a dream of hope.  But by the end of the week hope was dropping to zero again with Lauriston. No letters had arrived--either from John Purdie or the editor. On the Sunday morning he was again face to face with the last half-crown. He laid out his money very cautiously that day, but when he had paid for a frugal dinner at a cheap coffee-shop, he had only a shilling left. He wandered into Kensington Gardens that Sunday afternoon, wondering what he had best do next. And as he stood by the railings of the ornamental water, watching the water-fowls' doings, somebody bade him good-day, and he turned to find the pretty girl of the pawnshop standing at his side and smiling shyly at him.    CHAPTER THREE   THE DEAD MAN  Lauriston was thinking about Zillah at the very moment in which she spoke to him: the memory of her dark eyes and the friendly smile that she had given him as he left the pawnshop had come as a relief in the midst of his speculations as to his immediate future. And now, as he saw her real self, close to him, evidently disposed to be friendly, he blushed like any girl, being yet at that age when shyness was still a part of his character. Zillah blushed too--but she was more self-possessed than Lauriston.  \"I've been talking to my Cousin Melky about you,\" she said quickly. \"Or, rather, he's been talking to me. He says he's going to introduce you to a man who wants his catalogue put in shape--for five pounds. Don't you do it for five pounds! I know that man--charge him ten!\"  Lauriston moved away with her down the walk.  \"Oh, but I couldn't do that, now!\" he said eagerly. \"You see I promised I'd do it for five.\"  Zillah gave him a quick glance.  \"Don't you be silly!\" she said. \"When anybody like Melky offers you five pounds for anything, ask them double. They'll give it. You don't know much about money matters, do you?\"  Lauriston laughed, and gaining confidence, gave the girl a knowing look.  \"Not much,\" he admitted, \"else I wouldn't have had to do that bit of business with you the other day.\"  \"Oh--that!\" she said indifferently. \"That's nothing. You'd be astonished if you knew what sort of people just have to run round to us, now and then--I could tell you some secrets! But--I guessed you weren't very well up in money matters, all the same. Writing people seldom are.\"  \"I suppose you are?\" suggested Lauriston.  \"I've been mixed up in them all my life, more or less,\" she answered. \"Couldn't help being, with my surroundings. You won't think me inquisitive if I ask you something? Were you--hard up--when you came round the other night?\"  \"Hard up's a mild term,\" replied Lauriston, frankly. \"I hadn't a penny!\"  \"Excepting a gold watch worth twelve or fifteen pounds,\" remarked Zillah, drily. \"And how long had you been like that?\"  \"Two or three days--more or less,\" answered Lauriston. \"You see, I've been expecting money for more than a week--that was it.\"  \"Has it come?\" she asked.  \"No--it hasn't,\" he replied, with a candid blush. \"That's a fact!\"  \"Will it come--soon?\" she demanded.  \"By George!--I hope so!\" he exclaimed. \"I'll be hard up again, if it doesn't.\"  \"And then you offer to do for five what you might easily get ten for!\" she said, almost reproachfully. \"Let me give you a bit of advice--never accept a first offer. Stand out for a bit more--especially from anybody like my cousin Melky.\"  \"Is Melky a keen one, then?\" enquired Lauriston.  \"Melky's a young Jew,\" said Zillah, calmly. \"I'm not--I'm half-and-half--a mixture. My mother was Jew--my father wasn't. Well--if you want money to be going on with, and you've got any more gold watches, you know where to come. Don't you ever go with empty pockets in London while you've got a bit of property to pledge! You're not a Londoner, of course?\"  \"I'm a Scotsman!\" said Lauriston.  \"To be sure--I knew it by your tongue,\" asserted Zillah. \"And trying to make a living by writing! Well, you'll want courage--and money. Have you had any luck?\"  \"I've sold two stories,\" answered Lauriston, who by that time was feeling as if the girl was an old friend. \"They come to twenty pounds for the two, at the rate that magazine pays, and I've asked for a cheque--it's that I'm waiting for. It ought to come--any time.\"  \"Oh, but I know that game!\" said Zillah. \"I've two friends--girls--who write. I know how they have to wait--till publication, or till next pay-day. What a pity that some of you writers don't follow some other profession that would bring in a good income--then you could do your writing to please yourselves, and not be dependent on it. Haven't you thought of that?\"  \"Often!\" answered Lauriston. \"And it wouldn't do--for me, anyway. I've made my choice. I'll stick to my pen--and swim or sink with it. And I'm not going to sink!\"  \"That's the way to talk--to be sure!\" said the girl. \"But--keep yourself in money, if you can. Don't go without money for three days when you've anything you can raise money on. You see how practical I am! But you've got to be in this world. Will you tell me something?\"  \"It strikes me,\" answered Lauriston, looking at her narrowly and bringing the colour to her cheeks, \"that I'm just about getting to this--that I'd tell you anything! And so--what is it?\"  \"How much money have you left?\" she asked softly.  \"Precisely a shilling--and a copper or two,\" he answered.  \"And--if that cheque doesn't arrive?\" she suggested.  \"Maybe I'll be walking round to Praed Street again,\" he said, laughing. \"I've a bit of what you call property, yet.\"  The girl nodded, and turned towards a side-walk that led across the Gardens.  \"All right,\" she said. \"Don't think me inquisitive--I don't like to think of--of people like you being hard up: I'm not wrapped up in business as much as all that. Let's talk of something else--tell me what you write about.\"  Lauriston spent the rest of that afternoon with Zillah, strolling about Kensington Gardens. He had lived a very lonely life since coming to London, and it was a new and pleasant experience to him to have an intelligent companion to talk to. There was a decided sense of exhilaration within him when he finally left her; as for Zillah, she went homewards in a very thoughtful mood, already conscious that she was more than half in love with this good-looking lad who had come so strangely into her life. And at the corner of Praed Street she ran up against Mr. Melky Rubinstein, and button-holed him, and for ten minutes talked seriously to him. Melky, who had good reasons of his own for keeping in his cousin's favour, listened like a lamb to all she had to say, and went off promising implicit obedience to her commandments.  \"Zillah ain't half gone on that chap!\" mused Melky, as he pursued his way. \"Now, ain't it extraordinary that a girl who'll come into a perfect fortune should go and fall head over ears in love with a red-headed young feller what ain't got a penny to bless hisself with! Not but what he ain't got good looks--and brains. And brains is brains, when all's said!\"  That night, as Lauriston sat writing in his shabby little room, a knock came at his door--the door opened, and Melky slid in, laying his finger to the side of his large nose in token of confidence.  \"Hope I"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9297"],["title","The Orange-Yellow Diamond (#3)"],["body","in't interrupting,\" said Melky. \"I say, mister, I been thinking about that catalogue business. Now I come to sort of reflect on it, I think my friend'll go to ten pound. So we'll say ten pound--what? And I'll take you to see him next Friday. And I say, mister--if a pound or two on account 'ud be of any service--say the word, d'ye see?\"  With this friendly assurance, Melky plunged his hand into a hip-pocket, and drew out some gold, which he held towards Lauriston on his open palm.  \"Two or three pound on account, now, mister?\" he said, ingratiatingly. \"You're welcome as the flowers in May!\"  But Lauriston shook his head; he had already decided on a plan of his own, if the expected remittance did not arrive next morning.  \"No, thank you,\" he answered. \"It's uncommonly good of you--but I can manage very well indeed--I can, really! Next Friday, then--I'll go with you. I'm very much obliged to you.\"  Melky slipped his money into his pocket--conscious of having done his part. \"Just as you like, mister,\" he said. \"But you was welcome, you know. Next Friday, then--and you can reckon on cash down for this job.\"  The Monday morning brought neither of the expected letters to Lauriston. But he had not spoken without reason when he said to Zillah that he had a bit of property to fall back upon--now that he knew how ready money could easily be raised. He had some pledgeable property in his trunk--and when the remittances failed to arrive, he determined to avail himself of it. Deep down in a corner of the trunk he had two valuable rings--all that his mother had left him, with the exception of two hundred pounds, with which he had ventured to London, and on which he had lived up to then. He got the rings out towards the end of Monday afternoon, determining to take them round to Daniel Multenius and raise sufficient funds on them to last him for, at any rate, another month or two. He had little idea of the real value of such articles, and he had reasons of his own for not showing the rings to Melky Rubinstein; his notion was to wait until evening, when he would go to the pawnshop at about the same time as on his previous visit, in the hope of finding Zillah in charge again. After their meeting and talk of the afternoon before, he felt that she would do business with him in a sympathetic spirit--and if he could raise twenty pounds on the rings he would be free of all monetary anxiety for many a long week to come.  It was half-past five o'clock of that Monday evening when Lauriston, for the second time, turned into the narrow passage which led to the pawnshop door. He had already looked carefully through the street window, in the hope of seeing Zillah inside the front shop. But there was no Zillah to be seen; the front shop was empty. Nor did Zillah confront him when he stepped into the little boxed-in compartment in the pawnshop. There was a curious silence in the place--broken only by the quiet, regular ticking of a clock. That ticking grew oppressive during the minute or two that he waited expecting somebody to step forward. He rapped on the counter at last--gently at first, then more insistently. But nobody came. The clock--hidden from his sight--went on ticking.  Lauriston bent over the counter at last and craned his neck to look into the open door of a little parlour which lay behind the shop. The next instant, with no thought but of the exigencies of the moment, he had leapt over the partition and darted into the room. There, stretched out across the floor, his head lying on the hearthrug, his hands lying inert and nerveless at his sides, lay an old man, grey-bearded, venerable--Daniel Multenius, no doubt. He lay very still, very statuesque--and Lauriston, bending over and placing a trembling hand on the high, white forehead, knew that he was dead.  He started up--his only idea that of seeking help. The whole place was so still that he knew he was alone with the dead in it. Instinctively, he ran through the front shop to the street door--and into the arms of a man who was just entering.    CHAPTER FOUR   THE PLATINUM SOLITAIRE  The newcomer, an elderly, thick-set man, who, in spite of his plain clothes, looked as if he were an official of some sort and carried some documents in his hand, at which he was glancing as he entered, started and exclaimed as Lauriston, in his haste, ran up against him. \"Hullo!\" he said. \"What's the matter? You seem in a hurry, young fellow!\"  Lauriston, almost out of breath with excitement, turned and pointed to the open door of the little parlour.  \"There's an old man--lying in there--dead!\" he whispered. \"A grey-bearded old man--is it the pawn-broker--Mr. Multenius?\"  The man stared, craned his neck to glance in the direction which Lauriston's shaking finger indicated, and then started forward. But he suddenly paused, and motioned Lauriston to go first--and before following him he closed the street door.  \"Now then, where?\" he said. \"Dead, do you say?\" He followed Lauriston into the parlour, uttered a sharp exclamation as he caught sight of the recumbent figure, and, bending down, laid a hand on the forehead. \"Dead, right enough, my lad!\" he muttered. \"Been dead some minutes, too. But--where's the girl--the grand-daughter? Have you seen anybody?\"  \"Not a soul!\" answered Lauriston. \"Since I came in, the whole place has been as still as--as it is now!\"  The man stared at him for a second or two, silently; then, as if he knew the ins and outs of the establishment, he strode to an inner door, threw it open and revealed a staircase.  \"Hullo there!\" he called loudly. \"Hullo! Miss Wildrose! Are you there?\"  This was the first time Lauriston had heard Zillah's surname: even in the midst of that startling discovery, it struck him as a very poetical one. But he had no time to reflect on it--the man turned back into the parlour.  \"She must be out,\" he said. \"Do you say you found him?\"  \"Yes--I found him,\" answered Lauriston. \"Just now.\"  \"And what were you doing here?\" asked the man. \"Who are you?\"  Lauriston fancied he detected a faint note of suspicion in these questions, and he drew himself up, with a flush on his face.  \"My name's Andrew Lauriston,\" he answered. \"I live close by. I came in on--business. Who are you?\"  \"Well, if it comes to that, my lad,\" said the man, \"I'm Detective-Sergeant Ayscough--known well enough around these parts! I came to see the old gentleman about these papers. Now--what was your business, then?\"  He was watching Lauriston very keenly, and Lauriston, suddenly realizing that he was in an awkward position, determined on candour.  \"Well, if you really want to know,\" he said, \"I came to borrow some money--on these rings.\"  And he opened his left hand and showed the detective the two rings which he had taken from his trunk--not half-an-hour before.  \"Your property?\" asked Ayscough.  \"Of course they're my property!\" exclaimed Lauriston. \"Whose else should they be?\"  Ayscough's glance wandered from the rings to a table which stood, a little to one side, in the middle of the parlour. Lauriston turned in that direction, also. Two objects immediately met his eye. On the table stood a small tray, full of rings--not dissimilar in style and appearance to those which he held in his hand: old-fashioned rings. The light from the gas-brackets above the mantel-piece caught the facets of the diamonds in those rings and made little points of fire; here and there he saw the shimmer of pearls. But there was another object. Close by the tray of old rings lay a book--a beautifully bound book, a small quarto in size, with much elaborate gold ornament on the back and side, and gilt clasps holding the heavy leather binding together. It looked as if some hand had recently thrown this book carelessly on the table.  But Ayscough gave little, if any, attention to the book: his eyes were fixed on the rings in the tray--and he glanced from them to Lauriston's rings.  \"Um!\" he said presently. \"Odd that you have a couple of rings, young man, just like--those! Isn't it?\"  \"What do you mean?\" demanded Lauriston, flushing scarlet. \"You don't suggest--\"  \"Don't suggest anything--just now,\" answered the detective, quietly. \"But you must stop here with me, until I find out more. Come to the door--we must have help here.\"  Lauriston saw there was nothing to do but to obey, and he followed Ayscough to the street door. The detective opened it, looked out, and waiting a few minutes, beckoned to a policeman who presently strolled along. After a whispered word or two, the policeman went away, and Ayscough beckoned Lauriston back into the shop.  \"Now,\" he said, \"there'll be some of our people and a surgeon along in a few minutes--before they come, just tell me your story. You're an honest-looking young chap--but you must admit that it looks a bit queer that I should find you running out of this shop, old Multenius dead inside his parlour, and you with a couple of rings in your possession which look uncommonly like his property! Just tell me how it came about.\"  Lauriston told him the plain truth--from the pawning of the watch to the present visit. Ayscough watched him narrowly--and at the end nodded his head.  \"That sounds like a straight tale, Mr. Lauriston,\" he said. \"I'm inclined to believe every word you say. But I shall have to report it, and all the circumstances, and you'll have to prove that these two rings were your mother's, and all that--and you must stay here till the doctor comes with our people. Queer that the old man should be alone! I wonder where his grand-daughter is?\"  But just then the street door opened and Zillah came in, a big bunch of flowers under one arm, some small parcels in the other. At the sight of the two men she started; crimsoned as she saw Lauriston; paled again as she noticed that Ayscough was evidently keeping an eye on him.  \"Mr. Ayscough!\" she exclaimed. \"What's this?--is something the matter? What are you doing here?\" she went on hurriedly, turning to Lauriston. \"Inside the"]]]
