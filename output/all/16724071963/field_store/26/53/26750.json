But thou, at least, Muza, are henceforth free, alike from the suspicion of the living and the warnings of the dead.  No, my friend,\" continued Boabdil, with generous warmth, \"it is better to lose a crown, to lose life itself, than confidence in a heart like thine.  Come, let us inspect this magic tablet; perchance--and how my heart bounds as I utter the hope!--the hour may have arrived.\"     CHAPTER IV.  A FULLER VIEW OF THE CHARACTER OF BOABDIL.--MUZA IN THE GARDENS OF HIS BELOVED.  Muza Ben Abil Gazan returned from his visit to Boabdil with a thoughtful and depressed spirit.  His arguments had failed to induce the king to disdain the command of the magic dial, which still forbade him to arm against the invaders; and although the royal favour was no longer withdrawn from himself, the Moor felt that such favour hung upon a capricious and uncertain tenure so long as his sovereign was the slave of superstition or imposture.  But that noble warrior, whose character the adversity of his country had singularly exalted and refined, even while increasing its natural fierceness, thought little of himself in comparison with the evils and misfortunes which the king's continued irresolution must bring upon Granada.  \"So brave, and yet so weak,\" thought he; \"so weak, and yet so obstinate; so wise a reasoner, yet so credulous a dupe!  Unhappy Boabdil! the stars, indeed, seem to fight against thee, and their influences at thy birth marred all thy gifts and virtues with counteracting infirmity and error.\"  Muza,--more perhaps than any subject in Granada,--did justice to the real character of the king; but even he was unable to penetrate all its complicated and latent mysteries.  Boabdil el Chico was no ordinary man; his affections were warm and generous, his nature calm and gentle; and, though early power, and the painful experience of a mutinous people and ungrateful court, had imparted to that nature an irascibility of temper and a quickness of suspicion foreign to its earlier soil, he was easily led back to generosity and justice; and, if warm in resentment, was magnanimous in forgiveness.  Deeply accomplished in all the learning of his race and time, he was--in books, at least--a philosopher; and, indeed, his attachment to the abstruser studies was one of the main causes which unfitted him for his present station.  But it was the circumstances attendant on his birth and childhood that had perverted his keen and graceful intellect to morbid indulgence in mystic reveries, and all the doubt, fear, and irresolution of a man who pushes metaphysics into the supernatural world.  Dark prophecies accumulated omens over his head; men united in considering him born to disastrous destinies. Whenever he had sought to wrestle against hostile circumstances, some seemingly accidental cause, sudden and unforeseen, had blasted the labours of his most vigorous energy,--the fruit of his most deliberate wisdom.  Thus, by degrees a gloomy and despairing cloud settled over his mind; but, secretly sceptical of the Mohammedan creed, and too proud and sanguine to resign himself wholly and passively to the doctrine of inevitable predestination, he sought to contend against the machinations of hostile demons and boding stars, not by human but spiritual agencies. Collecting around him the seers and magicians of orient-fanaticism, he lived in the visions of another world; and, flattered by the promises of impostors or dreamers, and deceived by his own subtle and brooding tendencies of mind, it was amongst spells and cabala that he thought to draw forth the mighty secret which was to free him from the meshes of the preternatural enemies of his fortune, and leave him the freedom of other men to wrestle, with equal chances, against peril and adversities.  It was thus, that Almamen had won the mastery over his mind; and, though upon matters of common and earthly import, or solid learning, Boabdil could contend with sages, upon those of superstition he could be fooled by a child.  He was, in this, a kind of Hamlet: formed, under prosperous and serene fortunes, to render blessings and reap renown; but over whom the chilling shadow of another world had fallen--whose soul curdled back into itself--whose life had been separated from that of the herd--whom doubts and awe drew back, while circumstances impelled onward--whom a supernatural doom invested with a peculiar philosophy, not of human effect and cause--and who, with every gift that could ennoble and adorn, was suddenly palsied into that mortal imbecility, which is almost ever the result of mortal visitings into the haunted regions of the Ghostly and Unknown.  The gloomier colourings of his mind had been deepened, too, by secret remorse.  For the preservation of his own life, constantly threatened by his unnatural predecessor, he had been early driven into rebellion against his father.  In age, infirmity, and blindness, that fierce king had been made a prisoner at Salobrena by his brother, El Zagal, Boabdil's partner in rebellion; and dying suddenly, El Zagal was suspected of his murder.  Though Boabdil was innocent of such a crime, he felt himself guilty of the causes which led to it; and a dark memory, resting upon his conscience, served to augment his superstition and enervate the vigour of his resolves; for, of all things that make men dreamers, none is so effectual as remorse operating upon a thoughtful temperament.  Revolving the character of his sovereign, and sadly foreboding the ruin of his country, the young hero of Granada pursued his way, until his steps, almost unconsciously, led him towards the abode of Leila.  He scaled the walls of the garden as before--he neared the house.  All was silent and deserted; his signal was unanswered--his murmured song brought no grateful light to the lattice, no fairy footstep to the balcony. Dejected, and sad of heart, he retired from the spot; and, returning home, sought a couch, to which even all the fatigue and excitement he had undergone, could not win the forgetfulness of slumber.  The mystery that wrapt the maiden of his homage, the rareness of their interviews, and the wild and poetical romance that made a very principle of the chivalry of the Spanish Moors, had imparted to Muza's love for Leila a passionate depth, which, at this day, and in more enervated climes, is unknown to the Mohammedan lover.  His keenest inquiries had been unable to pierce the secret of her birth and station.  Little of the inmates of that guarded and lonely house was known in the neighbourhood; the only one ever seen without its walls was an old man of the Jewish faith, supposed to be a superintendent of the foreign slaves (for no Mohammedan slave would have been subjected to the insult of submission to a Jew); and though there were rumours of the vast wealth and gorgeous luxury within the mansion, it was supposed the abode of some Moorish emir absent from the city--and the interest of the gossips was at this time absorbed in more weighty matters than the affairs of a neighbour.  But when, the next eve, and the next, Muza returned to the spot equally in vain, his impatience and alarm could no longer be restrained; he resolved to lie in watch by the portals of the house night and day, until, at least, he could discover some one of the inmates, whom he could question of his love, and perhaps bribe to his service.  As with this resolution he was hovering round the mansion, he beheld, stealing from a small door in one of the low wings of the house, a bended and decrepit form: it supported its steps upon a staff; and, as now entering the garden, it stooped by the side of a fountain to cull flowers and herbs by the light of the moon, the Moor almost started to behold a countenance which resembled that of some ghoul or vampire haunting the places of the dead.  He smiled at his own fear; and, with a quick and stealthy pace, hastened through the trees, and, gaining the spot where the old man bent, placed his hand on his shoulder ere his presence was perceived.  Ximen--for it was he--looked round eagerly, and a faint cry of terror broke from his lips.  \"Hush!\" said the Moor; \"fear me not, I am a friend.  Thou art old, man-- gold is ever welcome to the aged.\"  As he spoke, he dropped several broad pieces into the breast of the Jew, whose ghastly features gave forth a yet more ghastly smile, as he received the gift, and mumbled forth,  \"Charitable young man!  generous, benevolent, excellent young man!\"  \"Now then,\" said Muza, \"tell me--you belong to this house--Leila, the maiden within--tell me of her--is she well?\"  \"I trust so,\" returned the Jew; \"I trust so, noble master.\"  \"Trust so! know you not of her state?\"  \"Not I; for many nights I have not seen her, excellent sir,\" answered Ximen; \"she hath left Granada, she hath gone.  You waste your time and mar your precious health amidst these nightly dews: they are unwholesome, very unwholesome at the time of the new moon.\"  \"Gone!\" echoed the Moor; \"left Granada!--woe is me!--and whither?--there, there, more gold for you,--old man, tell me whither?\"  \"Alas! I know not, most magnanimous young man; I am but a servant--I know nothing.\"  \"When will she return?\"  \"I cannot tell thee.\"  \"Who is thy master? who owns yon mansion?\"  Ximen's countenance fell; he looked round in doubt and fear, and then, after a short pause, answered,--\"A wealthy man, good sir--a Moor of Africa; but he hath also gone; he but seldom visits us; Granada is not so peaceful a residence as it was,--I would go too, if I could.\"  Muza released his hold of Ximen, who gazed at the Moor's working countenance with a malignant smile--for Ximen hated all men.  \"Thou hast done with me, young warrior?  Pleasant dreams to thee under the new moon--thou hadst best retire to thy bed.  Farewell! bless thy charity to the poor old man!\"  Muza heard him not; he remained motionless for some moments; and then with a heavy sigh as that of one who has gained the mastery of himself after "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9757"],["title","Leila or, the Siege of Granada, Book II. (#7)"],["body","bitter struggle, the said half aloud, \"Allah be with thee, Leila! Granada now is my only mistress.\"     CHAPTER V.  BOABDIL'S RECONCILIATION WITH HIS PEOPLE.  Several days had elapsed without any encounter between Moor and Christian; for Ferdinand's cold and sober policy, warned by the loss he had sustained in the ambush of Muza, was now bent on preserving rigorous restraint upon the fiery spirits he commanded.  He forbade all parties of skirmish, in which the Moors, indeed, had usually gained the advantage, and contented himself with occupying all the passes through which provisions could arrive at the besieged city.  He commenced strong fortifications around his camp; and, forbidding assault on the Moors, defied it against himself.  Meanwhile, Almamen had not returned to Granada.  No tidings of his fate reached the king; and his prolonged disappearance began to produce visible and salutary effect upon the long-dormant energies of Boabdil. The counsels of Muza, the exhortations of the queen-mother, the enthusiasm of his mistress, Amine, uncounteracted by the arts of the magician, aroused the torpid lion of his nature.  But still his army and his subjects murmured against him; and his appearance in the Vivarrambla might possibly be the signal of revolt.  It was at this time that a most fortunate circumstance at once restored to him the confidence and affections of his people.  His stern uncle, El Zagal--once a rival for his crown, and whose daring valour, mature age, and military sagacity had won him a powerful party within the city--had been, some months since, conquered by Ferdinand; and, in yielding the possessions he held, had been rewarded with a barren and dependent principality.  His defeat, far from benefiting Boabdil, had exasperated the Moors against their king. \"For,\" said they, almost with one voice, \"the brave El Zagal never would have succumbed had Boabdil properly supported his arms.\"  And it was the popular discontent and rage at El Zagal's defeat which had indeed served Boabdil with a reasonable excuse for shutting himself in the strong fortress of the Alhambra.  It now happened that El Zagal, whose dominant passion was hatred of his nephew, and whose fierce nature chafed at its present cage, resolved in his old age to blast all his former fame by a signal treason to his country.  Forgetting everything but revenge against his nephew, who he was resolved should share his own ruin, he armed his subjects, crossed the country, and appeared at the head of a gallant troop in the Spanish camp, an ally with Ferdinand against Granada.  When this was heard by the Moors, it is impossible to conceive their indignant wrath: the crime of El Zagal produced an instantaneous reaction in favour of Boabdil; the crowd surrounded the Alhambra and with prayers and tears entreated the forgiveness of the king.  This event completed the conquest of Boabdil over his own irresolution.  He ordained an assembly of the whole army in the broad space of the Vivarrambla: and when at break of day he appeared in full armour in the square, with Muza at his right hand, himself in the flower of youthful beauty, and proud to feel once more a hero and a king, the joy of the people knew no limit; the air was rent with cries of \"Long live Boabdil el Chico!\" and the young monarch, turning to Muza, with his soul upon his brow exclaimed, \"The hour has come--I am no longer El Zogoybi!\"     CHAPTER V.  LEILA.--HER NEW LOVER.--PORTRAIT OF THE FIRST INQUISITOR OF SPAIN.--THE CHALICE RETURNED TO THE LIPS OF ALMAMEN.  While thus the state of events within Granada, the course of our story transports us back to the Christian camp.  It was in one of a long line of tents that skirted the pavilion of Isabel, and was appropriated to the ladies attendant on the royal presence, that a young female sat alone. The dusk of evening already gathered around, and only the outline of her form and features was visible.  But even that, imperfectly seen,--the dejected attitude of the form, the drooping head, the hands clasped upon the knees,--might have sufficed to denote the melancholy nature of the reverie which the maid indulged.  \"Ah,\" thought she, \"to what danger am I exposed!  If my father, if my lover dreamed of the persecution to which their poor Leila is abandoned!\"  A few tears, large and bitter, broke from her eyes, and stole unheeded down her cheek.  At that moment, the deep and musical chime of a bell was heard summoning the chiefs of the army to prayer; for Ferdinand invested all his worldly schemes with a religious covering, and to his politic war he sought to give the imposing character of a sacred crusade.  \"That sound,\" thought she, sinking on her knees, \"summons the Nazarenes to the presence of their God.  It reminds me, a captive by the waters of Babylon, that God is ever with the friendless.  Oh! succour and defend me, Thou who didst look of old upon Ruth standing amidst the corn, and didst watch over Thy chosen people in the hungry wilderness, and in the stranger's land.\"  Wrapt in her mute and passionate devotions, Leila remained long in her touching posture.  The bell had ceased; all without was hushed and still --when the drapery, stretched across the opening of the tent, was lifted, and a young Spaniard, cloaked, from head to foot, in a long mantle, stood within the space.  He gazed in silence, upon the kneeling maiden; nor was it until she rose that he made his presence audible.  \"Ah, fairest!\" said he, then, as he attempted to take her hand, \"thou wilt not answer my letters--see me, then, at thy feet.  It is thou who teachest me to kneel.\"  \"You, prince.\"  said Leila, agitated, and in great and evident fear. \"Why harass and insult me thus?  Am I not sacred as a hostage and a charge? and are name, honour, peace, and all that woman is taught to hold most dear, to be thus robbed from me under the pretext of a love dishonouring to thee and an insult to myself?\"  \"Sweet one,\" answered Don Juan, with a slight laugh, \"thou hast learned, within yonder walls, a creed of morals little known to Moorish maidens, if fame belies them not.  Suffer me to teach thee easier morality and sounder logic.  It is no dishonour to a Christian prince to adore beauty like thine; it is no insult to a maiden hostage if the Infant of Spain proffer her the homage of his heart.  But we waste time.  Spies, and envious tongues, and vigilant eyes, are around us; and it is not often that I can baffle them as I have done now.  Fairest, hear me!\" and this time he succeeded in seizing the hand which vainly struggled against his clasp.  \"Nay, why so coy? what can female heart desire that my love cannot shower upon thine?  Speak but the word, enchanting maiden, and I will bear thee from these scenes unseemly to thy gentle eyes.  Amidst the pavilions of princes shalt thou repose; and, amidst gardens of the orange and the rose, shalt thou listen to the vows of thine adorer.  Surely, in these arms thou wilt not pine for a barbarous home and a fated city.  And if thy pride, sweet maiden, deafen thee to the voice of nature, learn that the haughtiest dames of Spain would bend, in envious court, to the beloved of their future king.  This night--listen to me--I say, listen-- this night I will bear thee hence!  Be but mine, and no matter, whether heretic or infidel, or whatever the priests style thee, neither Church nor king shall tear thee from the bosom of thy lover.\"  \"It is well spoken, son of the most Christian monarch!\" said a deep voice; and the Dominican, Tomas de Torquemada, stood before the prince.  Juan, as if struck by a thunderbolt, released his hold, and, staggering back a few paces, seemed to cower, abashed and humbled, before the eye of the priest, as it glared upon him through the gathering darkness.  \"Prince,\" said the friar, after a pause, \"not to thee will our holy Church attribute this crime; thy pious heart hath been betrayed by sorcery.  Retire!\"  \"Father,\" said the prince,--in a tone into which, despite his awe of that terrible man, THE FIRST GRAND INQUISITOR OF SPAIN, his libertine spirit involuntarily forced itself, in a half latent raillery,--\"sorcery of eyes like those bewitched the wise son of a more pious sire than even Ferdinand of Arragon.\"  \"He blasphemes!\" muttered the monk.  \"Prince, beware! you know not what you do.\"  The prince lingered, and then, as if aware that he must yield, gathered his cloak round him, and left the tent without reply.  Pale and trembling,--with fears no less felt, perhaps, though more vague and perplexed, than those from which she had just been delivered,--Leila stood before the monk.  \"Be seated, daughter of the faithless,\" said Torquemada, \"we would converse with thee: and, as thou valuest--I say not thy soul, for, alas! of that precious treasure thou art not conscious--but mark me, woman! as thou prizest the safety of those delicate limbs, and that wanton beauty, answer truly what I shall ask thee.  The man who brought thee hither--is he, in truth, thy father?\"  \"Alas!\" answered Leila, almost fainting with terror at this rude and menacing address, \"he is, in truth, mine only parent.\"  \"And his faith--his religion?\"  \"I have never beheld him pray.\"  \"Hem! he never prays--a noticeable fact.  But of what sect, what creed, does he profess himself?\"  \"I cannot answer thee.\"  \"Nay, there be means that may wring from thee an answer.  Maiden, be not so stubborn; speak! thinkest thou he serves the temple of the Mohammedan?\"  \"No! oh, no!\" answered poor Leila, eagerly, deeming that her reply, in this, at least, would be acceptable.  \"He disowns, he scorns, he abhors, the Moorish faith,--even,\" she added, \"with too fierce a zeal.\"  \"Thou dost not share that zeal, then?  Well, worships he in secret after the Christian rites?\"  Leila hung her head and answered not.  \"I understand thy silence.  And in what belief, maiden, wert thou reared beneath his roof?\"  \"I know not what it is called among men,\" answered Leila, with firmness, \"b"]]]
