And there we sat for a while and talked in an aimless fashion. We did not know quite how one ought to \"sit out\" a dance, you conceive....    4  Then, moved by some queer impulse, I stared over the railing for a little at this great, wonderful, ambiguous world, and said solemnly:  \"It is good.\"  \"Yes,\" Stella agreed, in a curious, quiet and tiny voice, \"it--it's very large, isn't it?\" She looked out for a moment over the tree-tops. \"It makes me feel like a little old nothing,\" she said, at last. \"The stars are so big, and--so uninterested.\" Stella paused for an interval, and then spoke again, with an uncertain laugh. \"I think I am rather afraid.\"  \"Afraid?\" I echoed.  \"Yes,\" she said, vaguely; \"of--of everything.\"  I understood. Even then I knew something of the occasional insufficiency of words.  \"It is a big world,\" I assented, \"and lots of people are having a right hard time in it right now. I reckon there is somebody dying this very minute not far off.\"  \"It's all--waiting for us!\" Stella had forgotten my existence. \"It's bringing us so many things--and we don't know what any of them are. But we've got to take them, whether we want to or not. It isn't fair. We've got to--well, got to grow up, and--marry, and--die, whether we want to or not. We've no choice. And it may not matter, after all. Everything will keep right on like it did before; and the stars won't care; and what we've done and had done to us won't really matter!\"  \"Well, but, Stella, you can have a right good time first, anyway, if you keep away from ugly things and fussy people. And I reckon you really go to Heaven afterwards if you haven't been really bad,--don't you?\"  \"Rob,--are you ever afraid of dying?\" Stella asked, \"very much afraid--Oh, you know what I mean.\"  I did. I was about ten once more. It was dark, and I was passing a drug-store, with huge red and green and purple bottles glistening in the gas-lit windows; and it had just occurred to me that I, too, must die, and be locked up in a box, and let down with trunk-straps into a hole, like Father was.... So I said, \"Yes.\"  \"And yet we've got to! Oh, I don't see how people can go on living like everything was all right when that's always getting nearer,--when they know they've got to die before very long. Because they dance and go on picnics and buy hats as if they were going to live forever. I--oh, I can't understand.\"  \"They get used to the idea, I reckon. We're sort of like the rats in the trap at home, in our stable,\" I suggested, poetically. \"We can bite the wires and go crazy, like lots of them do, if we want to, or we can eat the cheese and kind of try not to think about it. Either way, there's no getting out till they come to kill us in the morning.\"  \"Yes,\" sighed Stella; \"I suppose we must make the best of it.\"  \"It's the only sensible thing to do, far as I can see.\"  \"But it is all so big--and so careless about us!\" she said, after a little. \"And we don't know--we can't know!--what is going to happen to you and me. And we can't stop its happening!\"  \"We'll just have to make the best of that, too,\" I protested, dolefully.  Stella sighed again, \"I hope so,\" she assented; \"still, I'm scared of it.\"  \"I think I am, too--sort of,\" I conceded, after reflection. \"Anyhow, I am going to have as good a time as I can.\"  There was now an even longer pause. Pitiable, ridiculous infants were pondering, somewhat vaguely but very solemnly, over certain mysteries of existence, which most of us have learned to accept with stolidity. We were young, and to us the miraculous insecurity and inconsequence of human life was still a little impressive, and we had not yet come to regard the universe as a more or less comfortable place, well-meaningly constructed anyhow--by Somebody--for us to reside in.  Therefore we moved a trifle closer together, Stella and I, and were commonly miserable over the _Weltschmerz_. After a little a distant whippoorwill woke me from a chaos of reverie, and I turned to Stella, with a vague sense that we two were the only people left in the whole world, and that I was very, very fond of her.  Stella's head was leaned backward. Her lips were parted, and the moonlight glinted in her eyes. Her eyes were blue.  \"Don't!\" said Stella, faintly.  I did....  It was a matter out of my volition, out of my planning. And, oh, the wonder, and sweetness, and sacredness of it! I thought, even in the instant; and, oh, the pity that, after all, it is slightly disappointing....  Stella was not angry, as I had half expected. \"That was dear of you,\" she said, impulsively, \"but don't try to do it again.\" There was the wisdom of centuries in this mandate of Stella's as she rose from the bench. The spell was broken, utterly. \"I think,\" said Stella, in the voice of a girl of fifteen, \"I think we'd better go and dance some more.\"    5  In the crude morning I approached Stella, with a fatuous smile. She apparently both perceived and resented my bearing, although she never once looked at me. There was something of great interest to her in the distance, apparently down by the springhouse; she was flushed and indignant; and her eyes wouldn't, couldn't, and didn't turn for an instant in my direction.  I fidgeted.  \"If,\" said she, impersonally, \"if you believe it was because of _you_, you are very much mistaken. It would have been the same with anybody. You don't understand, and I don't either. Anyhow, I think you are a mess, and I hate you. Go away from me!\"  And she stamped her foot in a fine rage.  For the moment I entertained an un-Christian desire that Stella had been born a boy. In that case, I felt, I would, just then, have really enjoyed sitting upon the back of her head, and grinding her nose into the lawn, and otherwise persuading her to cry \"'Nough.\" These virile pleasures being denied me, I sought for comfort in discourteous speech.  \"Umph-huh!\" said I, \"and you think you're mighty smart, don't you? Well, I don't want you pawing around me any more, either. I won't have it, do you understand! That was what I was going to tell you anyhow, you kissing-bug, even if you hadn't acted so smart. And you can just stick that right in your pipe and smoke it, you old Miss Smart Alec.\"  Thereupon I--wisely--departed without delay. A rock struck me rather forcibly between the shoulder blades, but I did not deign to notice this phenomenon.  \"You can't fight girls with fists,\" I reflected. \"You've just got to talk to them in the right way.\"     2.  _He Loves Extensively_   I saw no more of Stella for a lengthy while, since within two days of the events recorded it pleased my mother to seek out another summer resort.  \"For in September,\" she said, \"I really must have perfect quiet and unimpeachable butter, and falling leaves, and only a very few congenial people to be melancholy with,--and that sort of thing, you know. I find it freshens one up so against the winter.\"  It was a signal feature of my mother's conversation that you never understood, precisely, what she was talking about.  Thus in her train the silly, pretty woman drew otherwhither her hobbledehoy son, as indeed Claire Bulmer Townsend had aforetime drawn an armament of more mature and stolid members of my sex. I was always proud of my handsome mother, but without any aspirations, however theoretical, toward intimacy; and her periods of conscientious if vague affection, when she recollected its propriety, I endured with consolatory foreknowledge of an impendent, more agreeable era of neglect.  I fancy that at bottom I was without suspecting it lonely. I was an only child; my father had died, as has been hinted, when I was in kilts.... No, I must have graduated from kilts into \"knee-pants\" when the Democracy of Lichfield celebrated Grover Cleveland's first election as President, for I was seven years old then, and was allowed to stay up ever so late after supper to watch the torchlight parade. I recollect being rather pleasantly scared by the yells of all those marching people and by the glistening of their faces as the irregular flaring torches heaved by; and I recollect how delightfully the cold night air was flavored with kerosene. In any event, it was on this generally festive November night that my father again took too much to drink, and, coming home toward morning, lay down and went to sleep in the vestibule between our front-door and the storm-doors; and five days later died of pneumonia...In that era I was accounted an odd boy; given to reading and secretive ways, and, they record, to long silences throughout which my lips would move noiselessly. \"Just talking to one of my friends,\" they tell me I was used to explain; though it was not until my career at King's College that I may be said to have pretended to intimacy with anybody.    2  For in old Fairhaven I spent, of course, a period of ostensible study, as four generations of my fathers had done aforetime. But in that leisured, slatternly and ancient city I garnered a far larger harvest of (comparatively) innocuous cakes and ale than of authentic learning, and at my graduation carried little of moment from the place save many memories of Bettie Hamlyn.... Her father taught me Latin at King's College, while Bettie taught me human intimacy--almost. Looking back, I have not ever been intimate with anybody....  Not but that I had my friends. In particular I remember those four of us who always called ourselves--in flat defiance, just as Dumas did, of mere arithmetic--\"The Three Musketeers.\" I think that we loved one another very greatly during the four years we spent together in our youth. I like to believe we did, and to remember the boys who were once unreasonably happy, even now. It does not seem to count, somehow, that Aramis has taken to drink and every other inexpedient course, I hear, and that I would not recognize him today, were we two to encounter casually--or Athos, either, I suppose, now that he has been so long in the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9608"],["title","The Cords of Vanity: A Comedy of Shirking (#4)"],["body","ines.  And as for D'Artagnan--or Billy Woods, if you prefer the appellation which his sponsors gave him,--why we are still good friends and always will be, I suppose. But we are not particularly intimate; and very certainly we will never again read _Chastelard_ together and declaim the more impassioned parts of it,--and in fine, I cannot help seeing, nowadays, that, especially since his marriage, Billy has developed into a rather obvious and stupid person, and that he considers me to be a bit of a bad egg. And in a phrase, when we are together, just we two, we smoke a great deal and do not talk any more than is necessary.  And once I would have quite sincerely enjoyed any death, however excruciating, which promoted the well-being of Billy Woods; and he viewed me not dissimilarly, I believe.... However, after all, this was a long, long while ago, and in a period almost antediluvian.  And during this period they of Fairhaven assumed I was in love with Bettie Hamlyn; and for a very little while, at the beginning, had I assumed as much. More lately was my error flagrantly apparent when I fell in love with someone else, and sincerely in love, and found to my amazement that, upon the whole, I preferred Bettie's companionship to that of the woman I adored. By and by, though, I learned to accept this odd, continuing phenomenon much as I had learned to accept the sunrise.    3  Once Bettie demanded of me, \"I often wonder what you really think of me? Honest injun, I mean.\"  I meditated, and presently began, with leisure:  \"Miss Hamlyn is a young woman of considerable personal attractions, and with one exception is unhandicapped by accomplishments. She plays the piano, it is true, but she does it divinely and she neither crochets nor embroiders presents for people, nor sketches, nor recites, nor sings, or in fine annoys the public in any way whatsoever. Her enemies deny that she is good-looking, but even her friends concede her curious picturesqueness and her knowledge of it. Her penetration, indeed, is not to be despised; she has even grasped the fact that all men are not necessarily fools in spite of the fashion in which they talk to women. It must be admitted, however, that her emotions are prone to take precedence of her reasoning powers: thus she is not easily misled from getting what she desires, save by those whom she loves, because in argument, while always illogical, she is invariably convincing--\"  Miss Hamlyn sniffed. \"This is, perhaps, the inevitable effect of twenty cigarettes a day,\" was her cryptic comment. \"Nevertheless, it does affect me with ennui.\"  \"--For, the mere facts of the case she plainly demonstrates, with the abettance of her dimples, to be an affair of unimportance; the real point is what she wishes done about it. Yet the proffering of any particular piece of advice does not necessarily signify that she either expects or wishes it to be followed, since had she been present at the Creation she would have cheerfully pointed out to the Deity His various mistakes, and have offered her co-operation toward bettering matters, and have thought a deal less of Him had He accepted it; but this is merely a habit--\" \"Yes?\" said Bettie, yawning; and she added: \"Do you know, Robin, the saddest and most desolate thing in the world is to practise an _etude_ of Schumann's in nine flats, and the next is to realize that a man who has been in love with you has recovered for keeps?\"  \"--It must not be imagined, however, that Miss Hamlyn is untruthful, for when driven by impertinences into a corner she conceals her real opinion by voicing it quite honestly as if she were joking. Thereupon you credit her with the employment of irony and the possession of every imaginable and super-angelical characteristic--\"  \"Unless we come to a better understanding,\" Miss Hamlyn crisply began, \"we had better stop right here before we come to a worse--\"  \"--Miss Hamlyn, in a word, is possessed of no insufferable virtues and of many endearing faults; and in common with the rest of humanity, she regards her disapproval of any proceeding as clear proof of its impropriety.\" This was largely apropos of a fire-new debate concerning the deleterious effects of cigarette-smoking; and when I had made an end, and doggedly lighted another one of them, Bettie said nothing.... She minded chiefly that one of us should have thought of the other without bias. She said it was not fair. And I know now that she was right.  But of Bettie Hamlyn, for reasons you may learn hereafter if you so elect, I honestly prefer to write not at all. Four years, in fine, we spent to every purpose together, and they were very happy years. To record them would be desecration.    4  Meantime, during these years, I had fallen in and out of love assiduously. Since the Anabasis of lad's love traverses a monotonous country, where one hill is largely like another, and one meadow a duplicate of the next to the last daffodil, I may with profit dwell upon the green-sickness lightly. It suffices that in the course of these four years I challenged superstition by adoring thirteen girls, and, worse than that, wrote verses of them.  I give you their names herewith--though not their workaday names, lest the wives of divers people be offended (and in many cases, surprised), but the appellatives which figured in my rhymes. They were Heart's Desire, Florimel, Dolores, Yolande, Adelais, Sylvia, Heart o' My Heart, Chloris, Felise, Ettarre, Phyllis, Phyllida, and Dorothy. Here was a rosary of exquisite names, I even now concede; and the owner of each _nom de plume_ I, for however brief a period, adored for this or that peculiar excellence; and by ordinary without presuming to mention the fact to any of these divinities save Heart o' My Heart, who was, after all, only a Penate.  Outside the elevated orbits of rhyme she was called Elizabeth Hamlyn; and it afterward became apparent to me that I, in reality, wrote all the verses of this period solely for the pleasure of reading them aloud to Bettie, for certainly I disclosed their existence to no one else--except just one or two to Phyllida, who was \"literary.\"  And the upshot of all this heart-burning is most succinctly given in my own far from impeccable verse, as Bettie Hamlyn heard the summing-up one evening in May. It was the year I graduated from King's College, and the exact relation of the date to the Annos Domini is trivial. But the battle of Manila had just been fought, and off Santiago Captain Sampson and Commander Schley were still hunting for Cervera's \"phantom fleet.\" And in Fairhaven, as I remember it, although there was a highly-colored picture of Commodore Dewey in the barber-shop window, nobody was bothering in the least about the war except when Colonel Snawley and Dr. Jeal foregathered at Clarriker's Emporium to denounce the colossal errors of \"imperialism\"....    \"Thus, then, I end my calendar   Of ancient loves more light than air;--   And now Lad's Love, that led afar   In April fields that were so fair,   Is fled, and I no longer share   Sedate unutterable days   With Heart's Desire, nor ever praise   Felise, or mirror forth the lures   Of Stella's eyes nor Sylvia's,   Yet love for each loved lass endures.    \"Chloris is wedded, and Ettarre   Forgets; Yolande loves otherwhere,   And worms long since made bold to mar   The lips of Dorothy and fare   Mid Florimel's bright ruined hair;   And Time obscures that roseate haze   Which glorified hushed woodland ways   When Phyllis came, as Time obscures   That faith which once was Phyllida's,--   Yet love for each loved lass endures.    \"That boy is dead as Schariar,   Tiglath-pileser, or Clotaire,   Who once of love got many a scar.   And his loved lasses past compare?--   None is alive now anywhere.   Each is transmuted nowadays   Into a stranger, and displays   No whit of love's investitures.   I let these women go their ways,   Yet love for each loved lass endures.    \"Heart o' My Heart, thine be the praise   If aught of good in me betrays   Thy tutelage--whose love matures   Unmarred in these more wistful days,--   Yet love for each loved lass endures.\"  For this was the year that I graduated, and Chloris--I violate no confidence in stating that her actual name was Aurelia Minns, and that she had been, for a greater number of years than it would be courteous to remember, the undisputed belle of Fairhaven,--had that very afternoon married a promising young doctor; and I was draining the cup of my misery to the last delicious drop, and was of course inspired thereby to the perpetration of such melancholy bathos as only a care-free youth of twenty is capable of evolving.    5  \"Dear boy,\" said Bettie, when I had made an end of reading, \"and are you very miserable?\"  Her fingers were interlocked behind her small black head; and the sympathy with which she regarded me was tenderly flavored with amusement.  This much I noticed as I glanced upward from my manuscript, and mustered a Spartan smile. \"If misery loves company, then am I the least unhappy soul alive. For I don't want anybody but just you, and I believe I never will.\"  \"Oh--? But I don't count.\" The girl continued, with composure: \"Or rather, I have always counted your affairs, so that I know precisely what it all amounts to.\"  \"Sum total?\"  \"A lot of imitation emotions.\" She added hastily: \"Oh, quite a good imitation, dear; you are smooth enough to see to that. Why, I remember once--when you read me that first sonnet, sitting all hunched up on the little stool, and pretending you didn't know I knew who you meant me to know it was for, and ending with a really very effective, breathless sob--and caught my hand and pressed it to your forehead for a moment--Why, that time I was thoroughly rattled and almost believed--even I--that--\" She shrugged. \"And if I had been younger--!\" she said, half regretfully, for at this time Bettie was very nearly twenty-two.  \"Yes.\" The effective breathless sob responded to what had"]]]
