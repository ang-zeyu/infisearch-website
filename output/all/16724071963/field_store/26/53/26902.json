Marionetta left him immediately, and returning to the harp, said, just loud enough for Scythrop to hear--'Did you ever read Dante, Mr Listless? Scythrop is reading Dante, and is just now in Purgatory.'--'And I' said the Honourable Mr Listless, 'am not reading Dante, and am just now in Paradise,' bowing to Marionetta.   MARIONETTA  You are very gallant, Mr Listless; and I dare say you are very fond of reading Dante.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  I don't know how it is, but Dante never came in my way till lately. I never had him in my collection, and if I had had him I should not have read him. But I find he is growing fashionable, and I am afraid I must read him some wet morning.   MARIONETTA  No, read him some evening, by all means. Were you ever in love, Mr Listless?   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  I assure you, Miss O'Carroll, never--till I came to Nightmare Abbey. I dare say it is very pleasant; but it seems to give so much trouble that I fear the exertion would be too much for me.   MARIONETTA  Shall I teach you a compendious method of courtship, that will give you no trouble whatever?   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  You will confer on me an inexpressible obligation. I am all impatience to learn it.   MARIONETTA  Sit with your back to the lady and read Dante; only be sure to begin in the middle, and turn over three or four pages at once--backwards as well as forwards, and she will immediately perceive that you are desperately in love with her--desperately.   _(The Honourable Mr Listless sitting between Scythrop and Marionetta, and fixing all his attention on the beautiful speaker, did not observe Scythrop, who was doing as she described.)_   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  You are pleased to be facetious, Miss O'Carroll. The lady would infallibly conclude that I was the greatest brute in town.   MARIONETTA  Far from it. She would say, perhaps, some people have odd methods of showing their affection.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  But I should think, with submission--   MR FLOSKY (_joining them from another part of the room_)  Did I not hear Mr Listless observe that Dante is becoming fashionable?   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  I did hazard a remark to that effect, Mr Flosky, though I speak on such subjects with a consciousness of my own nothingness, in the presence of so great a man as Mr Flosky. I know not what is the colour of Dante's devils, but as he is certainly becoming fashionable I conclude they are blue; for the blue devils, as it seems to me, Mr Flosky, constitute the fundamental feature of fashionable literature.   MR FLOSKY  The blue are, indeed, the staple commodity; but as they will not always be commanded, the black, red, and grey may be admitted as substitutes. Tea, late dinners, and the French Revolution, have played the devil, Mr Listless, and brought the devil into play.   MR TOOBAD (_starting up_)  Having great wrath.   MR FLOSKY  This is no play upon words, but the sober sadness of veritable fact.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  Tea, late dinners, and the French Revolution. I cannot exactly see the connection of ideas.   MR FLOSKY  I should be sorry if you could; I pity the man who can see the connection of his own ideas. Still more do I pity him, the connection of whose ideas any other person can see. Sir, the great evil is, that there is too much common-place light in our moral and political literature; and light is a great enemy to mystery, and mystery is a great friend to enthusiasm. Now the enthusiasm for abstract truth is an exceedingly fine thing, as long as the truth, which is the object of the enthusiasm, is so completely abstract as to be altogether out of the reach of the human faculties; and, in that sense, I have myself an enthusiasm for truth, but in no other, for the pleasure of metaphysical investigation lies in the means, not in the end; and if the end could be found, the pleasure of the means would cease. The mind, to be kept in health, must be kept in exercise. The proper exercise of the mind is elaborate reasoning. Analytical reasoning is a base and mechanical process, which takes to pieces and examines, bit by bit, the rude material of knowledge, and extracts therefrom a few hard and obstinate things called facts, every thing in the shape of which I cordially hate. But synthetical reasoning, setting up as its goal some unattainable abstraction, like an imaginary quantity in algebra, and commencing its course with taking for granted some two assertions which cannot be proved, from the union of these two assumed truths produces a third assumption, and so on in infinite series, to the unspeakable benefit of the human intellect. The beauty of this process is, that at every step it strikes out into two branches, in a compound ratio of ramification; so that you are perfectly sure of losing your way, and keeping your mind in perfect health, by the perpetual exercise of an interminable quest; and for these reasons I have christened my eldest son Emanuel Kant Flosky.   THE REVEREND MR LARYNX  Nothing can be more luminous.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  And what has all that to do with Dante, and the blue devils?   MR HILARY  Not much, I should think, with Dante, but a great deal with the blue devils.   MR FLOSKY  It is very certain, and much to be rejoiced at, that our literature is hag-ridden. Tea has shattered our nerves; late dinners make us slaves of indigestion; the French Revolution has made us shrink from the name of philosophy, and has destroyed, in the more refined part of the community (of which number I am one), all enthusiasm for political liberty. That part of the _reading public_ which shuns the solid food of reason for the light diet of fiction, requires a perpetual adhibition of _sauce piquante_ to the palate of its depraved imagination. It lived upon ghosts, goblins, and skeletons (I and my friend Mr Sackbut served up a few of the best), till even the devil himself, though magnified to the size of Mount Athos, became too base, common, and popular, for its surfeited appetite. The ghosts have therefore been laid, and the devil has been cast into outer darkness, and now the delight of our spirits is to dwell on all the vices and blackest passions of our nature, tricked out in a masquerade dress of heroism and disappointed benevolence; the whole secret of which lies in forming combinations that contradict all our experience, and affixing the purple shred of some particular virtue to that precise character, in which we should be most certain not to find it in the living world; and making this single virtue not only redeem all the real and manifest vices of the character, but make them actually pass for necessary adjuncts, and indispensable accompaniments and characteristics of the said virtue.   MR TOOBAD  That is, because the devil is come among us, and finds it for his interest to destroy all our perceptions of the distinctions of right and wrong.   MARIONETTA  I do not precisely enter into your meaning, Mr Flosky, and should be glad if you would make it a little more plain to me.   MR FLOSKY  One or two examples will do it, Miss O'Carroll. If I were to take all the mean and sordid qualities of a money-dealing Jew, and tack on to them, as with a nail, the quality of extreme benevolence, I should have a very decent hero for a modern novel; and should contribute my quota to the fashionable method of administering a mass of vice, under a thin and unnatural covering of virtue, like a spider wrapt in a bit of gold leaf, and administered as a wholesome pill. On the same principle, if a man knocks me down, and takes my purse and watch by main force, I turn him to account, and set him forth in a tragedy as a dashing young fellow, disinherited for his romantic generosity, and full of a most amiable hatred of the world in general, and his own country in particular, and of a most enlightened and chivalrous affection for himself: then, with the addition of a wild girl to fall in love with him, and a series of adventures in which they break all the Ten Commandments in succession (always, you will observe, for some sublime motive, which must be carefully analysed in its progress), I have as amiable a pair of tragic characters as ever issued from that new region of the belles lettres, which I have called the Morbid Anatomy of Black Bile, and which is greatly to be admired and rejoiced at, as affording a fine scope for the exhibition of mental power.   MR HILARY  Which is about as well employed as the power of a hothouse would be in forcing up a nettle to the size of an elm. If we go on in this way, we shall have a new art of poetry, of which one of the first rules will be: To remember to forget that there are any such things as sunshine and music in the world.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  It seems to be the case with us at present, or we should not have interrupted Miss O'Carroll's music with this exceedingly dry conversation.   MR FLOSKY  I should be most happy if Miss O'Carroll would remind us that there are yet both music and sunshine--   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  In the voice and the smile of beauty. May I entreat the favour of--(_turning over the pages of music._)   All were silent, and Marionetta sung:    Why are thy looks so blank, grey friar?   Why are thy looks so blue?   Thou seem'st more pale and lank, grey friar,   Than thou wast used to do:--   Say, what has made thee rue?    Thy form was plump, and a light did shine   In thy round and ruby face,   Which showed an outward visible sign   Of an inward spiritual grace:--   Say, what has changed thy case?    Yet will I tell thee true, grey friar,   I very well can see,   That, if thy looks are blue, grey friar,   'Tis all for love of me,--   'Tis all for love of me.    But breathe not thy vows to me, grey friar,   Oh, breathe them not, I pray;   For ill beseems in a reverend friar,   The love of a mortal may;   And I needs must say thee nay.    But,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9909"],["title","Nightmare Abbey (#6)"],["body","d'st thou think my heart to move   With that pale and silent scowl?   Know, he who would win a maiden's love,   Whether clad in cap or cowl,   Must be more of a lark than an owl.   Scythrop immediately replaced Dante on the shelf, and joined the circle round the beautiful singer. Marionetta gave him a smile of approbation that fully restored his complacency, and they continued on the best possible terms during the remainder of the evening. The Honourable Mr Listless turned over the leaves with double alacrity, saying, 'You are severe upon invalids, Miss O'Carroll: to escape your satire, I must try to be sprightly, though the exertion is too much for me.'         *       *       *       *       *     CHAPTER VII   A new visitor arrived at the Abbey, in the person of Mr Asterias, the ichthyologist. This gentleman had passed his life in seeking the living wonders of the deep through the four quarters of the world; he had a cabinet of stuffed and dried fishes, of shells, sea-weeds, corals, and madrepores, that was the admiration and envy of the Royal Society. He had penetrated into the watery den of the Sepia Octopus, disturbed the conjugal happiness of that turtle-dove of the ocean, and come off victorious in a sanguinary conflict. He had been becalmed in the tropical seas, and had watched, in eager expectation, though unhappily always in vain, to see the colossal polypus rise from the water, and entwine its enormous arms round the masts and the rigging. He maintained the origin of all things from water, and insisted that the polypodes were the first of animated things, and that, from their round bodies and many-shooting arms, the Hindoos had taken their gods, the most ancient of deities. But the chief object of his ambition, the end and aim of his researches, was to discover a triton and a mermaid, the existence of which he most potently and implicitly believed, and was prepared to demonstrate, _à priori, à posteriori, à fortiori_, synthetically and analytically, syllogistically and inductively, by arguments deduced both from acknowledged facts and plausible hypotheses. A report that a mermaid had been seen 'sleeking her soft alluring locks' on the sea-coast of Lincolnshire, had brought him in great haste from London, to pay a long-promised and often-postponed visit to his old acquaintance, Mr Glowry.  Mr Asterias was accompanied by his son, to whom he had given the name of Aquarius--flattering himself that he would, in the process of time, become a constellation among the stars of ichthyological science. What charitable female had lent him the mould in which this son was cast, no one pretended to know; and, as he never dropped the most distant allusion to Aquarius's mother, some of the wags of London maintained that he had received the favours of a mermaid, and that the scientific perquisitions which kept him always prowling about the sea-shore, were directed by the less philosophical motive of regaining his lost love.  Mr Asterias perlustrated the sea-coast for several days, and reaped disappointment, but not despair. One night, shortly after his arrival, he was sitting in one of the windows of the library, looking towards the sea, when his attention was attracted by a figure which was moving near the edge of the surf, and which was dimly visible through the moonless summer night. Its motions were irregular, like those of a person in a state of indecision. It had extremely long hair, which floated in the wind. Whatever else it might be, it certainly was not a fisherman. It might be a lady; but it was neither Mrs Hilary nor Miss O'Carroll, for they were both in the library. It might be one of the female servants; but it had too much grace, and too striking an air of habitual liberty, to render it probable. Besides, what should one of the female servants be doing there at this hour, moving to and fro, as it seemed, without any visible purpose? It could scarcely be a stranger; for Claydyke, the nearest village, was ten miles distant; and what female would come ten miles across the fens, for no purpose but to hover over the surf under the walls of Nightmare Abbey? Might it not be a mermaid? It was possibly a mermaid. It was probably a mermaid. It was very probably a mermaid. Nay, what else could it be but a mermaid? It certainly was a mermaid. Mr Asterias stole out of the library on tiptoe, with his finger on his lips, having beckoned Aquarius to follow him.  The rest of the party was in great surprise at Mr Asterias's movement, and some of them approached the window to see if the locality would tend to elucidate the mystery. Presently they saw him and Aquarius cautiously stealing along on the other side of the moat, but they saw nothing more; and Mr Asterias returning, told them, with accents of great disappointment, that he had had a glimpse of a mermaid, but she had eluded him in the darkness, and was gone, he presumed, to sup with some enamoured triton, in a submarine grotto.  'But, seriously, Mr Asterias,' said the Honourable Mr Listless, 'do you positively believe there are such things as mermaids?'   MR ASTERIAS  Most assuredly; and tritons too.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  What! things that are half human and half fish?   MR ASTERIAS  Precisely. They are the oran-outangs of the sea. But I am persuaded that there are also complete sea men, differing in no respect from us, but that they are stupid, and covered with scales; for, though our organisation seems to exclude us essentially from the class of amphibious animals, yet anatomists well know that the _foramen ovale_ may remain open in an adult, and that respiration is, in that case, not necessary to life: and how can it be otherwise explained that the Indian divers, employed in the pearl fishery, pass whole hours under the water; and that the famous Swedish gardener of Troningholm lived a day and a half under the ice without being drowned? A nereid, or mermaid, was taken in the year 1403 in a Dutch lake, and was in every respect like a French woman, except that she did not speak. Towards the end of the seventeenth century, an English ship, a hundred and fifty leagues from land, in the Greenland seas, discovered a flotilla of sixty or seventy little skiffs, in each of which was a triton, or sea man: at the approach of the English vessel the whole of them, seized with simultaneous fear, disappeared, skiffs and all, under the water, as if they had been a human variety of the nautilus. The illustrious Don Feijoo has preserved an authentic and well-attested story of a young Spaniard, named Francis de la Vega, who, bathing with some of his friends in June, 1674, suddenly dived under the sea and rose no more. His friends thought him drowned; they were plebeians and pious Catholics; but a philosopher might very legitimately have drawn the same conclusion.   THE REVEREND MR LARYNX  Nothing could be more logical.   MR ASTERIAS  Five years afterwards, some fishermen near Cadiz found in their nets a triton, or sea man; they spoke to him in several languages--   THE REVEREND MR LARYNX  They were very learned fishermen.   MR HILARY  They had the gift of tongues by especial favour of their brother fisherman, Saint Peter.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  Is Saint Peter the tutelar saint of Cadiz?   (_None of the company could answer this question, and_ MR ASTERIAS _proceeded_.)  They spoke to him in several languages, but he was as mute as a fish. They handed him over to some holy friars, who exorcised him; but the devil was mute too. After some days he pronounced the name Lierganes. A monk took him to that village. His mother and brothers recognised and embraced him; but he was as insensible to their caresses as any other fish would have been. He had some scales on his body, which dropped off by degrees; but his skin was as hard and rough as shagreen. He stayed at home nine years, without recovering his speech or his reason: he then disappeared again; and one of his old acquaintance, some years after, saw him pop his head out of the water near the coast of the Asturias. These facts were certified by his brothers, and by Don Gaspardo de la Riba Aguero, Knight of Saint James, who lived near Lierganes, and often had the pleasure of our triton's company to dinner.--Pliny mentions an embassy of the Olyssiponians to Tiberius, to give him intelligence of a triton which had been heard playing on its shell in a certain cave; with several other authenticated facts on the subject of tritons and nereids.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  You astonish me. I have been much on the sea-shore, in the season, but I do not think I ever saw a mermaid. (_He rang, and summoned Fatout, who made his appearance half-seas-over_.) Fatout! did I ever see a mermaid?   FATOUT  Mermaid! mer-r-m-m-aid! Ah! merry maid! Oui, monsieur! Yes, sir, very many. I vish dere vas von or two here in de kitchen--ma foi! Dey be all as melancholic as so many tombstone.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  I mean, Fatout, an odd kind of human fish.   FATOUT  De odd fish! Ah, oui! I understand de phrase: ve have seen nothing else since ve left town--ma foi!   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  You seem to have a cup too much, sir.   FATOUT  Non, monsieur: de cup too little. De fen be very unwholesome, and I drink-a-de ponch vid Raven de butler, to keep out de bad air.   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  Fatout! I insist on your being sober.   FATOUT  Oui, monsieur; I vil be as sober as de révérendissime père Jean. I should be ver glad of de merry maid; but de butler be de odd fish, and he swim in de bowl de ponch. Ah! ah! I do recollect de leetle-a song:--'About fair maids, and about fair maids, and about my merry maids all.' (_Fatout reeled out, singing_.)   THE HONOURABLE MR LISTLESS  I am overwhelmed: I never saw the rascal in such a condition before. But will you allow me, Mr Asterias, to inquire into the _cui bono_ of all the pains and expense you have incurred to discover a mermaid? The _cui bono_, sir, is the question I always take"]]]
