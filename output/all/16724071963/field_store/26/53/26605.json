Was I a Bedlamite?\"  \"As mine own bruises can testify,\" Bardolph assented. \"Had each one of them a tongue, they would raise a clamor beside which Babel were as an heir weeping for his rich uncle's death; their testimony would qualify you for any mad-house in England. And if their evidence go against the doctor's stomach, the watchman at the corner hath three teeth--or, rather, hath them no longer, since you knocked them out last night--that will, right willingly, aid him to digest it.\"  \"Three, say you?\" asked the knight, rather stiffly lowering his great body into his great chair set ready for him beside the fire. \"I would have my valor in all men's mouths, but not in this fashion, for it is too biting a jest. Three, say you? Well, I am glad it was no worse; I have a tender conscience, and that mad fellow of the north, Hotspur, sits heavily upon it, so that thus this Percy, being slain by my valor, is _per se_ avenged, a plague on him! Three, say you? I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is; I would I had 'bated my natural inclination somewhat, and had slain less tall fellows by some threescore. I doubt Agamemnon slept not well o' nights. Three, say you? Give the fellow a crown apiece for his mouldy teeth, if thou hast them; if thou hast them not, bid him eschew this vice of drunkenness, whereby his misfortune hath befallen him, and thus win him heavenly crowns.\"  \"Indeed, sir,\" began Bardolph, \"I doubt--\"  \"Doubt not, sirrah!\" cried Sir John, testily; and continued, in a virtuous manner: \"Was not the apostle reproved for that same sin? Thou art a Didymus, Bardolph;--an incredulous paynim, a most unspeculative rogue! Have I carracks trading in the Indies? Have I robbed the exchequer of late? Have I the Golden Fleece for a cloak? Nay, it is paltry gimlet, and that augurs badly. Why, does this knavish watchman take me for a raven to feed him in the wilderness? Tell him there are no such ravens hereabout; else had I ravenously limed the house-tops and set springes in the gutters. Inform him that my purse is no better lined than his own broken skull: it is void as a beggar's protestations, or a butcher's stall in Lent; light as a famished gnat, or the sighing of a new-made widower; more empty than a last year's bird-nest, than a madman's eye, or, in fine, than the friendship of a king.\"  \"But you have wealthy friends, Sir John,\" suggested the hostess of the Boar's Head Tavern, whose impatience had but very hardly waited for this opportunity to join in the talk. \"Yes, I warrant you, Sir John. Sir John, you have a many wealthy friends; you cannot deny that, Sir John.\"  \"Friends, dame?\" asked the knight, and cowered closer to the fire, as though he were a little cold. \"I have no friends since Hal is King. I had, I grant you, a few score of acquaintances whom I taught to play at dice; paltry young blades of the City, very unfledged juvenals! Setting my knighthood and my valor aside, if I did swear friendship with these, I did swear to a lie. But this is a censorious and muddy-minded world, so that, look you, even these sprouting aldermen, these foul bacon-fed rogues, have fled my friendship of late, and my reputation hath grown somewhat more murky than Erebus. No matter! I walk alone, as one that hath the pestilence. No matter! But I grow old; I am not in the vaward of my youth, mistress.\"  He nodded his head with extreme gravity; then reached for a cup of sack that Bardolph held at the knight's elbow.  \"Indeed, I know not what your worship will do,\" said Mistress Quickly, rather sadly.  \"Faith!\" answered Sir John, finishing the sack and grinning in a somewhat ghastly fashion; \"unless the Providence that watches over the fall of a sparrow hath an eye to the career of Sir John Falstaff, Knight, and so comes to my aid shortly, I must needs convert my last doublet into a mask, and turn highwayman in my shirt. I can take purses yet, ye Uzzite comforters, as gaily as I did at Gadshill, where that scurvy Poins, and he that is now King, and some twoscore other knaves did afterward assault me in the dark; yet I peppered some of them, I warrant you!\"  \"You must be rid of me, then, master,\" Bardolph interpolated. \"I for one have no need of a hempen collar.\"  \"Ah, well!\" said the knight, stretching himself in his chair as the warmth of the liquor coursed through his inert blood; \"I, too, would be loth to break the gallows' back! For fear of halters, we must alter our way of living; we must live close, Bardolph, till the wars make us Croesuses or food for crows. And if Hal but hold to his bias, there will be wars: I will eat a piece of my sword, if he have not need of it shortly. Ah, go thy ways, tall Jack; there live not three good men unhanged in England, and one of them is fat and grows old. We must live close, Bardolph; we must forswear drinking and wenching! But there is lime in this sack, you rogue; give me another cup.\"  The old knight drained this second cup, and unctuously sucked at and licked his lips. Thereafter,  \"I pray you, hostess,\" he continued, \"remember that Doll Tearsheet sups with me to-night; have a capon of the best, and be not sparing of the wine. I will repay you, upon honor, when we young fellows return from France, all laden with rings and brooches and such trumperies like your Norfolkshire pedlars at Christmas-tide. We will sack a town for you, and bring you back the Lord Mayor's beard to stuff you a cushion; the Dauphin shall be your tapster yet; we will walk on lilies, I warrant you, to the tune of _Hey, then up go we!\"_  \"Indeed, sir,\" said Mistress Quickly, in perfect earnest, \"your worship is as welcome to my pantry as the mice--a pox on 'em!--think themselves; you are heartily welcome. Ah, well, old Puss is dead; I had her of Goodman Quickly these ten years since;--but I had thought you looked for the lady who was here but now;--she was a roaring lion among the mice.\"  \"What lady?\" cried Sir John, with great animation. \"Was it Flint the mercer's wife, think you? Ah, she hath a liberal disposition, and will, without the aid of Prince Houssain's carpet or the horse of Cambuscan, transfer the golden shining pieces from her husband's coffers to mine.\"  \"No mercer's wife, I think,\" Mistress Quickly answered, after consideration. \"She came with two patched footmen, and smacked of gentility;--Master Dumbleton's father was a mercer; but he had red hair;--she is old;--and I could never abide red hair.\"  \"No matter!\" cried the knight. \"I can love this lady, be she a very Witch of Endor. Observe, what a thing it is to be a proper man, Bardolph! She hath marked me;--in public, perhaps; on the street, it may be;--and then, I warrant you, made such eyes! and sighed such sighs! and lain awake o' nights, thinking of a pleasing portly gentleman, whom, were I not modesty's self, I might name;--and I, all this while, not knowing! Fetch me my Book of Riddles and my Sonnets, that I may speak smoothly. Why was my beard not combed this morning? No matter, it will serve. Have I no better cloak than this?\" Sir John was in a tremendous bustle, all a-beam with pleasurable anticipation.  But Mistress Quickly, who had been looking out of the window, said, \"Come, but your worship must begin with unwashed hands, for old Madam Wish-for't and her two country louts are even now at the door.\"  \"Avaunt, minions!\" cried the knight. \"Avaunt! Conduct the lady hither, hostess; Bardolph, another cup of sack. We will ruffle it, lad, and go to France all gold, like Midas! Are mine eyes too red? I must look sad, you know, and sigh very pitifully. Ah, we will ruffle it! Another cup of sack, Bardolph;--I am a rogue if I have drunk to-day. And avaunt! vanish! for the lady comes.\"  He threw himself into a gallant attitude, suggestive of one suddenly palsied, and with the mien of a turkey-cock strutted toward the door to greet his unknown visitor.   2. _\"Then was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a Boy\"_  The woman who entered was not the jolly City dame one looked for: and, at first sight, you estimated her age as a trifle upon the staider side of sixty. But to this woman the years had shown unwonted kindliness, as though time touched her less with intent to mar than to caress; her form was still unbent, and her countenance, bloodless and deep-furrowed, bore the traces of great beauty; and, whatever the nature of her errand, the woman who stood in the doorway was unquestionably a person of breeding.  Sir John advanced toward her with as much elegance as he might muster; for gout when coupled with such excessive bulk does not beget an overpowering amount of grace.  \"_See, from the glowing East, Aurora comes_,\" he chirped. \"Madam, permit me to welcome you to my poor apartments; they are not worthy--\"  \"I would see Sir John Falstaff, sir,\" declared the lady, courteously, but with some reserve of manner, and looking him full in the face as she said this.  \"Indeed, madam,\" suggested Sir John, \"if those bright eyes--whose glances have already cut my poor heart into as many pieces as the man in the front of the almanac--will but desist for a moment from such butcher's work and do their proper duty, you will have little trouble in finding the bluff soldier you seek.\"  \"Are you Sir John?\" asked the lady, as though suspecting a jest. \"The son of old Sir Edward Falstaff, of Norfolk?\"  \"His wife hath frequently assured me so,\" Sir John protested, very gravely; \"and to confirm her evidence I have about me a certain villainous thirst that did plague Sir Edward sorely in his lifetime, and came to me with his other chattels. The property I have expended long since; but no Jew will advance me a maravedi on the Falstaff thirst. It is a priceless commodity, not to be bought or sold; you might as soon quench it.\"  \"I would not have known you,\" said the lady, wonderingly; \"but,\""]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/95"],["title","The Prisoner of Zenda (#0)"],["body","PRISONER OF ZENDA  by Anthony Hope   CONTENTS       1  The Rassendylls--With a Word on the Elphbergs      2  Concerning the Colour of Men’s Hair      3  A Merry Evening with a Distant Relative      4  The King Keeps his Appointment      5  The Adventures of an Understudy      6  The Secret of a Cellar      7  His Majesty Sleeps in Strelsau      8  A Fair Cousin and a Dark Brother      9  A New Use for a Tea-Table      10  A Great Chance for a Villain      11  Hunting a Very Big Boar      12  I Receive a Visitor and Bait a Hook      13  An Improvement on Jacob’s Ladder      14  A Night Outside the Castle      15  I Talk with a Tempter      16  A Desperate Plan      17  Young Rupert’s Midnight Diversions      18  The Forcing of the Trap      19  Face to Face in the Forest      20  The Prisoner and the King      21  If Love Were All!      22  Present, Past--and Future?     CHAPTER 1  The Rassendylls--With a Word on the Elphbergs   “I wonder when in the world you’re going to do anything, Rudolf?” said my brother’s wife.  “My dear Rose,” I answered, laying down my egg-spoon, “why in the world should I do anything? My position is a comfortable one. I have an income nearly sufficient for my wants (no one’s income is ever quite sufficient, you know), I enjoy an enviable social position: I am brother to Lord Burlesdon, and brother-in-law to that charming lady, his countess. Behold, it is enough!”  “You are nine-and-twenty,” she observed, “and you’ve done nothing but--”  “Knock about? It is true. Our family doesn’t need to do things.”  This remark of mine rather annoyed Rose, for everybody knows (and therefore there can be no harm in referring to the fact) that, pretty and accomplished as she herself is, her family is hardly of the same standing as the Rassendylls. Besides her attractions, she possessed a large fortune, and my brother Robert was wise enough not to mind about her ancestry. Ancestry is, in fact, a matter concerning which the next observation of Rose’s has some truth.  “Good families are generally worse than any others,” she said.  Upon this I stroked my hair: I knew quite well what she meant.  “I’m so glad Robert’s is black!” she cried.  At this moment Robert (who rises at seven and works before breakfast) came in. He glanced at his wife: her cheek was slightly flushed; he patted it caressingly.  “What’s the matter, my dear?” he asked.  “She objects to my doing nothing and having red hair,” said I, in an injured tone.  “Oh! of course he can’t help his hair,” admitted Rose.  “It generally crops out once in a generation,” said my brother. “So does the nose. Rudolf has got them both.”  “I wish they didn’t crop out,” said Rose, still flushed.  “I rather like them myself,” said I, and, rising, I bowed to the portrait of Countess Amelia.  My brother’s wife uttered an exclamation of impatience.  “I wish you’d take that picture away, Robert,” said she.  “My dear!” he cried.  “Good heavens!” I added.  “Then it might be forgotten,” she continued.  “Hardly--with Rudolf about,” said Robert, shaking his head.  “Why should it be forgotten?” I asked.  “Rudolf!” exclaimed my brother’s wife, blushing very prettily.  I laughed, and went on with my egg. At least I had shelved the question of what (if anything) I ought to do. And, by way of closing the discussion--and also, I must admit, of exasperating my strict little sister-in-law a trifle more--I observed:  “I rather like being an Elphberg myself.”  When I read a story, I skip the explanations; yet the moment I begin to write one, I find that I must have an explanation. For it is manifest that I must explain why my sister-in-law was vexed with my nose and hair, and why I ventured to call myself an Elphberg. For eminent as, I must protest, the Rassendylls have been for many generations, yet participation in their blood of course does not, at first sight, justify the boast of a connection with the grander stock of the Elphbergs or a claim to be one of that Royal House. For what relationship is there between Ruritania and Burlesdon, between the Palace at Strelsau or the Castle of Zenda and Number 305 Park Lane, W.?  Well then--and I must premise that I am going, perforce, to rake up the very scandal which my dear Lady Burlesdon wishes forgotten--in the year 1733, George II. sitting then on the throne, peace reigning for the moment, and the King and the Prince of Wales being not yet at loggerheads, there came on a visit to the English Court a certain prince, who was afterwards known to history as Rudolf the Third of Ruritania. The prince was a tall, handsome young fellow, marked (maybe marred, it is not for me to say) by a somewhat unusually long, sharp and straight nose, and a mass of dark-red hair--in fact, the nose and the hair which have stamped the Elphbergs time out of mind. He stayed some months in England, where he was most courteously received; yet, in the end, he left rather under a cloud. For he fought a duel (it was considered highly well bred of him to waive all question of his rank) with a nobleman, well known in the society of the day, not only for his own merits, but as the husband of a very beautiful wife. In that duel Prince Rudolf received a severe wound, and, recovering therefrom, was adroitly smuggled off by the Ruritanian ambassador, who had found him a pretty handful. The nobleman was not wounded in the duel; but the morning being raw and damp on the occasion of the meeting, he contracted a severe chill, and, failing to throw it off, he died some six months after the departure of Prince Rudolf, without having found leisure to adjust his relations with his wife--who, after another two months, bore an heir to the title and estates of the family of Burlesdon. This lady was the Countess Amelia, whose picture my sister-in-law wished to remove from the drawing-room in Park Lane; and her husband was James, fifth Earl of Burlesdon and twenty-second Baron Rassendyll, both in the peerage of England, and a Knight of the Garter. As for Rudolf, he went back to Ruritania, married a wife, and ascended the throne, whereon his progeny in the direct line have sat from then till this very hour--with one short interval. And, finally, if you walk through the picture galleries at Burlesdon, among the fifty portraits or so of the last century and a half, you will find five or six, including that of the sixth earl, distinguished by long, sharp, straight noses and a quantity of dark-red hair; these five or six have also blue eyes, whereas among the Rassendylls dark eyes are the commoner.  That is the explanation, and I am glad to have finished it: the blemishes on honourable lineage are a delicate subject, and certainly this heredity we hear so much about is the finest scandalmonger in the world; it laughs at discretion, and writes strange entries between the lines of the “Peerages”.  It will be observed that my sister-in-law, with a want of logic that must have been peculiar to herself (since we are no longer allowed to lay it to the charge of her sex), treated my complexion almost as an offence for which I was responsible, hastening to assume from that external sign inward qualities of which I protest my entire innocence; and this unjust inference she sought to buttress by pointing to the uselessness of the life I had led. Well, be that as it may, I had picked up a good deal of pleasure and a good deal of knowledge. I had been to a German school and a German university, and spoke German as readily and perfectly as English; I was thoroughly at home in French; I had a smattering of Italian and enough Spanish to swear by. I was, I believe, a strong, though hardly fine swordsman and a good shot. I could ride anything that had a back to sit on; and my head was as cool a one as you could find, for all its flaming cover. If you say that I ought to have spent my time in useful labour, I am out of Court and have nothing to say, save that my parents had no business to leave me two thousand pounds a year and a roving disposition.  “The difference between you and Robert,” said my sister-in-law, who often (bless her!) speaks on a platform, and oftener still as if she were on one, “is that he recognizes the duties of his position, and you see the opportunities of yours.”  “To a man of spirit, my dear Rose,” I answered, “opportunities are duties.”  “Nonsense!” said she, tossing her head; and after a moment she went on: “Now, here’s Sir Jacob Borrodaile offering you exactly what you might be equal to.”  “A thousand thanks!” I murmured.  “He’s to have an Embassy in six months, and Robert says he is sure that he’ll take you as an attache. Do take it, Rudolf--to please me.”  Now, when my sister-in-law puts the matter in that way, wrinkling her pretty brows, twisting her little hands, and growing wistful in the eyes, all on account of an idle scamp like myself, for whom she has no natural responsibility, I am visited with compunction. Moreover, I thought it possible that I could pass the time in the position suggested with some tolerable amusement. Therefore I said:  “My dear sister, if in six months’ time no unforeseen obstacle has arisen, and Sir Jacob invites me, hang me if I don’t go with Sir Jacob!”  “Oh, Rudolf, how good of you! I am glad!”  “Where’s he going to?”  “He doesn’t know yet; but it’s sure to be a good Embassy.”  “Madame,” said I, “for your sake I’ll go, if it’s no more than a beggarly Legation. When I do a thing, I don’t do it by halves.”  My promise, then, was given; but six months are six months, and seem an eternity, and, inasmuch as they stretched between me and my prospective industry (I suppose attaches are industrious; but I know not, for I never became attache to Sir Jacob or anybody else), I cast about for some desirable mode of spending them. And it occurred to me suddenly that I would visit Ruritania. It may seem strange that I had never visited that country yet; but my father (in spite of a sneaking fondness for the Elphbergs, which led him to give me, his"]]]
