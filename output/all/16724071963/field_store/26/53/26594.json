What term we can use for pleasure arising from another's gain, I know not.  We will call the 'love towards him who confers a benefit on another,' 'Approval;' and the 'hatred towards him who injures another,' we will call 'Indignation.'  We must further remark, that we not only feel pity for a thing which we have loved (as shown in III. xxi.), but also for a thing which we have hitherto regarded without emotion, provided that we deem that it resembles ourselves (as I will show presently).  Thus, we bestow approval on one who has benefited anything resembling ourselves, and, contrariwise, are indignant with him who has done it an injury.  XXIII. He who conceives, that an object of his hatred is painfully affected, will feel pleasure.  Contrariwise, if he thinks that the said object is pleasurably affected, he will feel pain.  Each of these emotions will be greater or less, according as its contrary is greater or less in the object of hatred.  >>>>>Proof--In so far as an object of hatred is painfully affected, it is destroyed, to an extent proportioned to the strength of the pain (III. xi. note).  Therefore, he (III. xx.) who conceives, that some object of his hatred is painfully affected, will feel pleasure, to an extent proportioned to the amount of pain he conceives in the object of his hatred.  This was our first point.  Again, pleasure postulates the existence of the pleasurably affected thing (III. xi. note), in proportion as the pleasure is greater or less.  If anyone imagines that an object of his hatred is pleasurably affected, this conception (III. xiii.) will hinder his own endeavour to persist; in other words (III. xi. note), he who hates will be painfully affected.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--This pleasure can scarcely be felt unalloyed, and without any mental conflict.  For (as I am about to show in Prop. xxvii.), in so far as a man conceives that something similar to himself is affected by pain, he will himself be affected in like manner; and he will have the contrary emotion in contrary circumstances.  But here we are regarding hatred only.  XXIV. If we conceive that anyone pleasurably affects an object of our hate, we shall feel hatred towards him also.  If we conceive that he painfully affects that said object, we shall feel love towards him.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is proved in the same way as III. xxii., which see.  *****Note--These and similar emotions of hatred are attributable to 'envy,' which, accordingly, is nothing else but 'hatred, in so far as it is regarded as disposing a man to rejoice in another's hurt, and to grieve at another's advantage.'  XXV. We endeavour to affirm, concerning ourselves, and concerning what we love, everything that we can conceive to affect pleasurably ourselves, or the loved object. Contrariwise, we endeavour to negative everything, which we conceive to affect painfully ourselves or the loved object.  >>>>>Proof--That, which we conceive to affect an object of our love pleasurably or painfully, affects us also pleasurably or painfully (III. xxi.).  But the mind (III. xii.) endeavours, as far as possible, to conceive those things which affect us pleasurably; in other words (II. xvii. and Cor.), it endeavours to regard them as present.  And, contrariwise (III. xiii.), it endeavours to exclude the existence of such things as affect us painfully; therefore, we endeavour to affirm concerning ourselves, and concerning the loved object, whatever we conceive to affect ourselves, or the love object pleasurably. Q.E.D.  XXVI. We endeavour to affirm, concerning that which we hate, everything which we conceive to affect it painfully; and, contrariwise, we endeavour to deny, concerning it, everything which we conceive to affect it pleasurably.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition follows from III. xxiii., as the foregoing proposition followed from III. xxi.  *****Note--Thus we see that it may readily happen, that a man may easily think too highly of himself, or a loved object, and, contrariwise, too meanly of a hated object.  This feeling is called 'pride,' in reference to the man who thinks too highly of himself, and is a species of madness, wherein a man dreams with his eyes open, thinking that he can accomplish all things that fall within the scope of his conception, and thereupon accounting them real, and exulting in them, so long as he is unable to conceive anything which excludes their existence, and determines his own power of action.  'Pride,' therefore, is 'pleasure springing from a man thinking too highly of himself.' Again, the 'pleasure which arises from a man thinking too highly of another' is called 'over-esteem.'  Whereas the 'pleasure which arises from thinking too little of a man' is called 'disdain.'  XXVII. By the very fact that we conceive a thing, which is like ourselves, and which we have not regarded with any emotion, to be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion (affectus).  >>>>>Proof--The images of things are modifications of the human body, whereof the ideas represent external bodies as present to us (II. xvii.); in other words (II. x.), whereof the ideas involve the nature of our body, and, at the same time, the nature of the external bodies as present.  If, therefore, the nature of the external body be similar to the nature of our body, then the idea which we form of the external body will involve a modification of our own body similar to the modification of the external body.  Consequently, if we conceive anyone similar to ourselves as affected by any emotion, this conception will express a modification of our body similar to that emotion.  Thus, from the fact of conceiving a thing like ourselves to be affected with any emotion, we are ourselves affected with a like emotion. If, however, we hate the said thing like ourselves, we shall, to that extent, be affected by a contrary, and not similar, emotion.  Q.E.D.  *****Note I--This imitation of emotions, when it is referred to pain, is called \"compassion\" (cf. III. xxii. note); when it is referred to desire, it is called \"emulation,\" which is nothing else but \"the desire of anything, engendered in us by the fact that we conceive that others have the like desire.\"  <<<<<Corollary I--If we conceive that anyone, whom we have hitherto regarded with no emotion, pleasurably affects something similar to ourselves, we shall be affected with love towards him.  If, on the other hand, we conceive that he painfully affects the same, we shall be affected with hatred towards him.  >>>>>Proof--This is proved from the last proposition in the same manner as III. xxii. is proved from III. xxi.  <<<<<Corollary II--We cannot hate a thing which we pity, because its misery affects us painfully.  >>>>>Proof--If we could hate it for this reason, we should rejoice in its pain, which is contrary to the hypothesis.  <<<<<Corollary III--We seek to free from misery, as far as we can, a thing which we pity.  >>>>>Proof--That, which painfully affects the object of our pity, affects us also with similar pain (by the foregoing proposition); therefore, we shall endeavour to recall everything which removes its existence, or which destroys it (cf. III. xiii.); in other words (III. ix. note), we shall desire to destroy it, or we shall be determined for its destruction; thus, we shall endeavour to free from misery a thing which we pity.  Q.E.D.  *****Note II--This will or appetite for doing good, which arises from pity of the thing whereon we would confer a benefit, is called \"benevolence,\" and is nothing else but \"desire arising from compassion.\"  Concerning love or hate towards him who has done good or harm to something, which we conceive to be like ourselves, see III. xxii. note.  XXVIII. We endeavour to bring about whatsoever we conceive to conduce to pleasure; but we endeavour to remove or destroy whatsoever we conceive to be truly repugnant thereto, or to conduce to pain.  >>>>>Proof--We endeavour, as far as possible, to conceive that which we imagine to conduce to pleasure (III. xii.); in other words (II. xvii.) we shall endeavour to conceive it as far as possible as present or actually existing.  But the endeavour of the mind, or the mind's power of thought, is equal to, and simultaneous with, the endeavour of the body, or the body's power of action.  (This is clear from II. vii. Cor. and II. xi. Cor.).  Therefore we make an absolute endeavour for its existence, in other words (which by III. ix., note, come to the same thing) we desire and strive for it; this was our first point. Again, if we conceive that something, which we believed to be the cause of pain, that is (III. xiii. note), which we hate, is destroyed, we shall rejoice (III. xx.).  We shall, therefore (by the first part of this proof), endeavour to destroy the same, or (III. xiii.) to remove it from us, so that we may not regard it as present; this was our second point.  Wherefore whatsoever conduces to pleasure, &c.  Q.E.D.  XXIX. We shall also endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men* to regard with pleasure, and contrariwise we shall shrink from doing that which we conceive men to shrink from.  [*N.B. By \"men\" in this and the following propositions, I mean men whom we regard without any particular emotion.]  >>>>>Proof--From the fact of imagining, that men love or hate anything, we shall love or hate the same thing (III. xxvii.). That is (III. xiii. note), from this mere fact we shall feel pleasure or pain at the thing's presence.  And so we shall endeavour to do whatsoever we conceive men to love or regard with pleasure, etc.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--This endeavour to do a thing or leave it undone, solely in order to please men, we call \"ambition,\" especially when we so eagerly endeavour to please the vulgar, that we do or omit certain things to our own or another's hurt:  in other cases it is generally called \"kindliness.\"  Furthermore I give the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/948"],["title","Ethics — Part 3 (#5)"],["body"," of \"praise\" to the \"pleasure, with which we conceive the action of another, whereby he has endeavoured to please us\"; but of \"blame\" to the \"pain wherewith we feel aversion to his action.\"  XXX. If anyone has done something which he conceives as affecting other men pleasurably, he will be affected by pleasure, accompanied by the idea of himself as cause; in other words, he will regard himself with pleasure.  On the other hand, if he has done anything which he conceives as affecting others painfully, he will regard himself with pain.  >>>>>Proof--He who conceives, that he affects others with pleasure or pain, will, by that very fact, himself be affected with pleasure or pain (III. xxvii.), but, as a man (II. xix. and xxiii.) is conscious of himself through the modifications whereby he is determined to action, it follows that he who conceives, that he affects others pleasurably, will be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of himself as cause; in other words, he will regard himself with pleasure.  And so \"mutatis mutandis\" in the case of pain.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--As love (III. xiii.) is pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause, and hatred is pain accompanied by the idea of an external cause; the pleasure and pain in question will be a species of love and hatred.  But, as the terms love and hatred are used in reference to external objects, we will employ other names for the emotions now under discussion: pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause we will style \"Honour,\" and the emotion contrary thereto we will style \"Shame\":  I mean in such cases as where pleasure or pain arises from a man's belief, that he is being praised or blamed: otherwise pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause is called \"self-complacency,\" and its contrary pain is called \"repentance.\"  Again, as it may happen (II. xvii. Cor.) that the pleasure, wherewith a man conceives that he affects others, may exist solely in his own imagination, and as (III. xxv.) everyone endeavours to conceive concerning himself that which he conceives will affect him with pleasure, it may easily come to pass that a vain man may be proud and may imagine that he is pleasing to all, when in reality he may be an annoyance to all.  XXXI. If we conceive that anyone loves, desires, or hates anything which we ourselves love, desire, or hate, we shall thereupon regard the thing in question with more steadfast love, &c.  On the contrary, if we think that anyone shrinks from something that we love, we shall undergo vacillations of soul.  >>>>>Proof--From the mere fact of conceiving that anyone loves anything we shall ourselves love that thing (III. xxvii.): but we are assumed to love it already; there is, therefore, a new cause of love, whereby our former emotion is fostered; hence we shall thereupon love it more steadfastly.  Again, from the mere fact of conceiving that anyone shrinks from anything, we shall ourselves shrink from that thing (III. xxvii.). If we assume that we at the same time love it, we shall then simultaneously love it and shrink from it; in other words, we shall be subject to vacillation (III. xvii. note).  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--From the foregoing, and also from III. xxviii. it follows that everyone endeavours, as far as possible, to cause others to love what he himself loves, and to hate what he himself hates:  as the poet* says:  \"As lover let us share every hope and every fear:  ironhearted were he who should love what the other leaves.\"** [* Ovid, \"Amores,\" II. xix. 4,5] [** Spinoza transposes the verses:  \"Speremus pariter, pariter metuamus amantes; Ferreus est, si quis, quod sinit alter, amat.\"]  *****Note--This endeavour to bring it about, that our own likes and dislikes should meet with universal approval, is really ambition (see III. xxix. note); wherefore we see that everyone by nature desires (appetere), that the rest of mankind should live according to his own individual disposition:  when such a desire is equally present in all, everyone stands in everyone else's way, and in wishing to be loved or praised by all, all become mutually hateful.  XXXII. If we conceive that anyone takes delight in something, which only one person can possess, we shall endeavour to bring it about that the man in question shall not gain possession thereof.  >>>>>Proof--From the mere fact of our conceiving that another person takes delight in a thing (III. xxvii. and Cor.) we shall ourselves love that thing and desire to take delight therein.  But we assumed that the pleasure in question would be prevented by another's delight in its object; we shall, therefore, endeavour to prevent his possession thereof (III. xxviii.).  Q.E.D.  *****Note--We thus see that man's nature is generally so constituted, that he takes pity on those who fare ill, and envies those who fare well with an amount of hatred proportioned to his own love for the goods in their possession.  Further, we see that from the same property of human nature, whence it follows that men are merciful, it follows also that they are envious and ambitious.  Lastly, if we make appeal to Experience, we shall find that she entirely confirms what we have said; more especially if we turn our attention to the first years of our life.  We find that children, whose body is continually, as it were, in equilibrium, laugh or cry simply because they see others laughing or crying; moreover, they desire forthwith to imitate whatever they see others doing, and to possess themselves of whatever they conceive as delighting others:  inasmuch as the images of things are, as we have said, modifications of the human body, or modes wherein the human body is affected and disposed by external causes to act in this or that manner.  XXXIII. When we love a thing similar to ourselves we endeavour, as far as we can, to bring about that it should love us in return.  >>>>>Proof--That which we love we endeavour, as far as we can, to conceive in preference to anything else (III. xii.).  If the thing be similar to ourselves, we shall endeavour to affect it pleasurably in preference to anything else (III. xxix.).  In other words, we shall endeavour, as far as we can, to bring it about, that the thing should be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of ourselves, that is (III. xiii. note), that it should love us in return.  Q.E.D.  XXXIV. The greater the emotion with which we conceive a loved object to be affected towards us, the greater will be our complacency.  >>>>>Proof--We endeavour (III. xxxiii.), as far as we can, to bring about, that what we love should love us in return:  in other words, that what we love should be affected with pleasure accompanied by the idea of ourself as cause.  Therefore, in proportion as the loved object is more pleasurably affected because of us, our endeavour will be assisted. --that is (III. xi. and note) the greater will be our pleasure.  But when we take pleasure in the fact, that we pleasurably affect something similar to ourselves, we regard ourselves with pleasure (III. xxx); therefore the greater the emotion with which we conceive a loved object to be affected, &c.  Q.E.D.  XXXV. If anyone conceives, that an object of his love joins itself to another with closer bonds of friendship than he himself has attained to, he will be affected with hatred towards the loved object and with envy towards his rival.  >>>>>Proof--In proportion as a man thinks, that a loved object is well affected towards him, will be the strength of his self-approval (by the last Prop.), that is (III. xxx. note), of his pleasure; he will, therefore (III. xxviii.), endeavour, as far as he can, to imagine the loved object as most closely bound to him:  this endeavour or desire will be increased, if he thinks that someone else has a similar desire (III. xxxi.). But this endeavour or desire is assumed to be checked by the image of the loved object in conjunction with the image of him whom the loved object has joined to itself; therefore (III. xi. note) he will for that reason be affected with pain, accompanied by the idea of the loved object as a cause in conjunction with the image of his rival; that is, he will be (III. xiii.) affected with hatred towards the loved object and also towards his rival (III. xv. Cor.), which latter he will envy as enjoying the beloved object.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--This hatred towards an object of love joined with envy is called \"Jealousy,\" which accordingly is nothing else but a wavering of the disposition arising from combined love and hatred, accompanied by the idea of some rival who is envied.  Further, this hatred towards the object of love will be greater, in proportion to the pleasure which the jealous man had been wont to derive from the reciprocated love of the said object; and also in proportion to the feelings he had previously entertained towards his rival.  If he had hated him, he will forthwith hate the object of his love, because he conceives it is pleasurably affected by one whom he himself hates:  and also because he is compelled to associate the image of his loved one with the image of him whom he hates.  This condition generally comes into play in the case of love for a woman:  for he who thinks, that a woman whom he loves prostitutes herself to another, will feel pain, not only because his own desire is restrained, but also because, being compelled to associate the image of her he loves with the parts of shame and the excreta of another, he therefore shrinks from her.  We must add, that a jealous man is not greeted by his beloved with the same joyful countenance as before, and this also gives him pain as a lover, as I will now show.  XXXVI. He who remembers a thing, in which he has once taken delight, desires to possess it under the same circumstances as when he first took delight therein.  >>>>>Proof--Everything, which a man has seen in conjunction with the object of his love, will be to him accidentally a cause of pleasure (III. xv.); "]]]
