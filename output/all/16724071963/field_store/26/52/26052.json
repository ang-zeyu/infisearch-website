Then he looked sharply at his ward.  \"Dick,\" said he, \"Y' have seen this penny rhyme?\"  The lad replied in the affirmative.  \"It bears your father's name,\" continued the knight; \"and our poor shrew of a parson is, by some mad soul, accused of slaying him.\"  \"He did most eagerly deny it,\" answered Dick.  \"He did?\" cried the knight, very sharply.  \"Heed him not.  He has a loose tongue; he babbles like a jack-sparrow.  Some day, when I may find the leisure, Dick, I will myself more fully inform you of these matters. There was one Duckworth shrewdly blamed for it; but the times were troubled, and there was no justice to be got.\"  \"It befell at the Moat House?\" Dick ventured, with a beating at his heart.  \"It befell between the Moat House and Holywood,\" replied Sir Daniel, calmly; but he shot a covert glance, black with suspicion, at Dick's face.  \"And now,\" added the knight, \"speed you with your meal; ye shall return to Tunstall with a line from me.\"  Dick's face fell sorely.  \"Prithee, Sir Daniel,\" he cried, \"send one of the villains!  I beseech you let me to the battle.  I can strike a stroke, I promise you.\"  \"I misdoubt it not,\" replied Sir Daniel, sitting down to write.  \"But here, Dick, is no honour to be won.  I lie in Kettley till I have sure tidings of the war, and then ride to join me with the conqueror.  Cry not on cowardice; it is but wisdom, Dick; for this poor realm so tosseth with rebellion, and the king's name and custody so changeth hands, that no man may be certain of the morrow.  Toss-pot and Shuttle-wit run in, but my Lord Good-Counsel sits o' one side, waiting.\"  With that, Sir Daniel, turning his back to Dick, and quite at the farther end of the long table, began to write his letter, with his mouth on one side, for this business of the Black Arrow stuck sorely in his throat.  Meanwhile, young Shelton was going on heartily enough with his breakfast, when he felt a touch upon his arm, and a very soft voice whispering in his ear.  \"Make not a sign, I do beseech you,\" said the voice, \"but of your charity tell me the straight way to Holywood.  Beseech you, now, good boy, comfort a poor soul in peril and extreme distress, and set me so far forth upon the way to my repose.\"  \"Take the path by the windmill,\" answered Dick, in the same tone; \"it will bring you to Till Ferry; there inquire again.\"  And without turning his head, he fell again to eating.  But with the tail of his eye he caught a glimpse of the young lad called Master John stealthily creeping from the room.  \"Why,\" thought Dick, \"he is a young as I.  'Good boy' doth he call me? An I had known, I should have seen the varlet hanged ere I had told him. Well, if he goes through the fen, I may come up with him and pull his ears.\"  Half an hour later, Sir Daniel gave Dick the letter, and bade him speed to the Moat House.  And, again, some half an hour after Dick's departure, a messenger came, in hot haste, from my Lord of Risingham.  \"Sir Daniel,\" the messenger said, \"ye lose great honour, by my sooth! The fight began again this morning ere the dawn, and we have beaten their van and scattered their right wing.  Only the main battle standeth fast. An we had your fresh men, we should tilt you them all into the river. What, sir knight!  Will ye be the last?  It stands not with your good credit.\"  \"Nay,\" cried the knight, \"I was but now upon the march.  Selden, sound me the tucket.  Sir, I am with you on the instant.  It is not two hours since the more part of my command came in, sir messenger.  What would ye have?  Spurring is good meat, but yet it killed the charger.  Bustle, boys!\"  By this time the tucket was sounding cheerily in the morning, and from all sides Sir Daniel's men poured into the main street and formed before the inn.  They had slept upon their arms, with chargers saddled, and in ten minutes five-score men-at-arms and archers, cleanly equipped and briskly disciplined, stood ranked and ready.  The chief part were in Sir Daniel's livery, murrey and blue, which gave the greater show to their array.  The best armed rode first; and away out of sight, at the tail of the column, came the sorry reinforcement of the night before.  Sir Daniel looked with pride along the line.  \"Here be the lads to serve you in a pinch,\" he said.  \"They are pretty men, indeed,\" replied the messenger.  \"It but augments my sorrow that ye had not marched the earlier.\"  \"Well,\" said the knight, \"what would ye?  The beginning of a feast and the end of a fray, sir messenger;\" and he mounted into his saddle.  \"Why! how now!\" he cried.  \"John!  Joanna!  Nay, by the sacred rood! where is she?  Host, where is that girl?\"  \"Girl, Sir Daniel?\" cried the landlord.  \"Nay, sir, I saw no girl.\"  \"Boy, then, dotard!\" cried the knight.  \"Could ye not see it was a wench? She in the murrey-coloured mantle--she that broke her fast with water, rogue--where is she?\"  \"Nay, the saints bless us!  Master John, ye called him,\" said the host. \"Well, I thought none evil.  He is gone.  I saw him--her--I saw her in the stable a good hour agone; 'a was saddling a grey horse.\"  \"Now, by the rood!\" cried Sir Daniel, \"the wench was worth five hundred pound to me and more.\"  \"Sir knight,\" observed the messenger, with bitterness, \"while that ye are here, roaring for five hundred pounds, the realm of England is elsewhere being lost and won.\"  \"It is well said,\" replied Sir Daniel.  \"Selden, fall me out with six cross-bowmen; hunt me her down.  I care not what it cost; but, at my returning, let me find her at the Moat House.  Be it upon your head.  And now, sir messenger, we march.\"  And the troop broke into a good trot, and Selden and his six men were left behind upon the street of Kettley, with the staring villagers.    CHAPTER II--IN THE FEN   It was near six in the May morning when Dick began to ride down into the fen upon his homeward way.  The sky was all blue; the jolly wind blew loud and steady; the windmill-sails were spinning; and the willows over all the fen rippling and whitening like a field of corn.  He had been all night in the saddle, but his heart was good and his body sound, and he rode right merrily.  The path went down and down into the marsh, till he lost sight of all the neighbouring landmarks but Kettley windmill on the knoll behind him, and the extreme top of Tunstall Forest far before.  On either hand there were great fields of blowing reeds and willows, pools of water shaking in the wind, and treacherous bogs, as green as emerald, to tempt and to betray the traveller.  The path lay almost straight through the morass.  It was already very ancient; its foundation had been laid by Roman soldiery; in the lapse of ages much of it had sunk, and every here and there, for a few hundred yards, it lay submerged below the stagnant waters of the fen.  About a mile from Kettley, Dick came to one such break in the plain line of causeway, where the reeds and willows grew dispersedly like little islands and confused the eye.  The gap, besides, was more than usually long; it was a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief; and Dick bethought him, with something like a pang, of the lad whom he had so imperfectly directed.  As for himself, one look backward to where the windmill sails were turning black against the blue of heaven--one look forward to the high ground of Tunstall Forest, and he was sufficiently directed and held straight on, the water washing to his horse's knees, as safe as on a highway.  Half-way across, and when he had already sighted the path rising high and dry upon the farther side, he was aware of a great splashing on his right, and saw a grey horse, sunk to its belly in the mud, and still spasmodically struggling.  Instantly, as though it had divined the neighbourhood of help, the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly.  It rolled, meanwhile, a blood-shot eye, insane with terror; and as it sprawled wallowing in the quag, clouds of stinging insects rose and buzzed about it in the air.  \"Alack!\" thought Dick, \"can the poor lad have perished?  There is his horse, for certain--a brave grey!  Nay, comrade, if thou criest to me so piteously, I will do all man can to help thee.  Shalt not lie there to drown by inches!\"  And he made ready his crossbow, and put a quarrel through the creature's head.  Dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy, somewhat sobered in spirit, and looking closely about him for any sign of his less happy predecessor in the way.  \"I would I had dared to tell him further,\" he thought; \"for I fear he has miscarried in the slough.\"  And just as he was so thinking, a voice cried upon his name from the causeway side, and, looking over his shoulder, he saw the lad's face peering from a clump of reeds.  \"Are ye there?\" he said, reining in.  \"Ye lay so close among the reeds that I had passed you by.  I saw your horse bemired, and put him from his agony; which, by my sooth! an ye had been a more merciful rider, ye had done yourself.  But come forth out of your hiding.  Here be none to trouble you.\"  \"Nay, good boy, I have no arms, nor skill to use them if I had,\" replied the other, stepping forth upon the pathway.  \"Why call me 'boy'?\" cried Dick.  \"Y' are not, I trow, the elder of us twain.\"  \"Good Master Shelton,\" said the other, \"prithee forgive me.  I have none the least intention to offend.  Rather I would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour, for I am now worse bested than ever, having lost my way, my cloak, and my poor horse.  To have a riding-rod and spurs, and never a horse to sit upon!  And before all,\" he added, looking ruefully upon his clothes--\"before all, to be so sorrily besmirched!\"  \"Tut!\" cried Dick.  \"Would ye mind a ducking?  Blood of wound or dust of travel--that's a man's adornment.\"  \"Nay, then, I like him better plain,\" observed the lad.  \"But, prithee, how shall I do?  Prithee, good Master Richard, help me with your"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/848"],["title","The Black Arrow: A Tale of Two Roses (#5)"],["body","counsel.  If I come not safe to Holywood, I am undone.\"  \"Nay,\" said Dick, dismounting, \"I will give more than counsel.  Take my horse, and I will run awhile, and when I am weary we shall change again, that so, riding and running, both may go the speedier.\"  So the change was made, and they went forward as briskly as they durst on the uneven causeway, Dick with his hand upon the other's knee.  \"How call ye your name?\" asked Dick.  \"Call me John Matcham,\" replied the lad.  \"And what make ye to Holywood?\" Dick continued.  \"I seek sanctuary from a man that would oppress me,\" was the answer. \"The good Abbot of Holywood is a strong pillar to the weak.\"  \"And how came ye with Sir Daniel, Master Matcham?\" pursued Dick.  \"Nay,\" cried the other, \"by the abuse of force!  He hath taken me by violence from my own place; dressed me in these weeds; ridden with me till my heart was sick; gibed me till I could 'a' wept; and when certain of my friends pursued, thinking to have me back, claps me in the rear to stand their shot!  I was even grazed in the right foot, and walk but lamely.  Nay, there shall come a day between us; he shall smart for all!\"  \"Would ye shoot at the moon with a hand-gun?\" said Dick.  \"'Tis a valiant knight, and hath a hand of iron.  An he guessed I had made or meddled with your flight, it would go sore with me.\"  \"Ay, poor boy,\" returned the other, \"y' are his ward, I know it.  By the same token, so am I, or so he saith; or else he hath bought my marriage--I wot not rightly which; but it is some handle to oppress me by.\"  \"Boy again!\" said Dick.  \"Nay, then, shall I call you girl, good Richard?\" asked Matcham.  \"Never a girl for me,\" returned Dick.  \"I do abjure the crew of them!\"  \"Ye speak boyishly,\" said the other.  \"Ye think more of them than ye pretend.\"  \"Not I,\" said Dick, stoutly.  \"They come not in my mind.  A plague of them, say I!  Give me to hunt and to fight and to feast, and to live with jolly foresters.  I never heard of a maid yet that was for any service, save one only; and she, poor shrew, was burned for a witch and the wearing of men's clothes in spite of nature.\"  Master Matcham crossed himself with fervour, and appeared to pray.  \"What make ye?\" Dick inquired.  \"I pray for her spirit,\" answered the other, with a somewhat troubled voice.  \"For a witch's spirit?\" Dick cried.  \"But pray for her, an ye list; she was the best wench in Europe, was this Joan of Arc.  Old Appleyard the archer ran from her, he said, as if she had been Mahoun.  Nay, she was a brave wench.\"  \"Well, but, good Master Richard,\" resumed Matcham, \"an ye like maids so little, y' are no true natural man; for God made them twain by intention, and brought true love into the world, to be man's hope and woman's comfort.\"  \"Faugh!\" said Dick.  \"Y' are a milk-sopping baby, so to harp on women. An ye think I be no true man, get down upon the path, and whether at fists, back-sword, or bow and arrow, I will prove my manhood on your body.\"  \"Nay, I am no fighter,\" said Matcham, eagerly.  \"I mean no tittle of offence.  I meant but pleasantry.  And if I talk of women, it is because I heard ye were to marry.\"  \"I to marry!\" Dick exclaimed.  \"Well, it is the first I hear of it.  And with whom was I to marry?\"  \"One Joan Sedley,\" replied Matcham, colouring.  \"It was Sir Daniel's doing; he hath money to gain upon both sides; and, indeed, I have heard the poor wench bemoaning herself pitifully of the match.  It seems she is of your mind, or else distasted to the bridegroom.\"  \"Well! marriage is like death, it comes to all,\" said Dick, with resignation.  \"And she bemoaned herself?  I pray ye now, see there how shuttle-witted are these girls: to bemoan herself before that she had seen me!  Do I bemoan myself?  Not I.  An I be to marry, I will marry dry-eyed!  But if ye know her, prithee, of what favour is she? fair or foul?  And is she shrewish or pleasant?\"  \"Nay, what matters it?\" said Matcham.  \"An y' are to marry, ye can but marry.  What matters foul or fair?  These be but toys.  Y' are no milksop, Master Richard; ye will wed with dry eyes, anyhow.\"  \"It is well said,\" replied Shelton.  \"Little I reck.\"  \"Your lady wife is like to have a pleasant lord,\" said Matcham.  \"She shall have the lord Heaven made her for,\" returned Dick.  \"It trow there be worse as well as better.\"  \"Ah, the poor wench!\" cried the other.  \"And why so poor?\" asked Dick.  \"To wed a man of wood,\" replied his companion.  \"O me, for a wooden husband!\"  \"I think I be a man of wood, indeed,\" said Dick, \"to trudge afoot the while you ride my horse; but it is good wood, I trow.\"  \"Good Dick, forgive me,\" cried the other.  \"Nay, y' are the best heart in England; I but laughed.  Forgive me now, sweet Dick.\"  \"Nay, no fool words,\" returned Dick, a little embarrassed by his companion's warmth.  \"No harm is done.  I am not touchy, praise the saints.\"  And at that moment the wind, which was blowing straight behind them as they went, brought them the rough flourish of Sir Daniel's trumpeter.  \"Hark!\" said Dick, \"the tucket soundeth.\"  \"Ay,\" said Matcham, \"they have found my flight, and now I am unhorsed!\" and he became pale as death.  \"Nay, what cheer!\" returned Dick.  \"Y' have a long start, and we are near the ferry.  And it is I, methinks, that am unhorsed.\"  \"Alack, I shall be taken!\" cried the fugitive.  \"Dick, kind Dick, beseech ye help me but a little!\"  \"Why, now, what aileth thee?\" said Dick.  \"Methinks I help you very patently.  But my heart is sorry for so spiritless a fellow!  And see ye here, John Matcham--sith John Matcham is your name--I, Richard Shelton, tide what betideth, come what may, will see you safe in Holywood.  The saints so do to me again if I default you.  Come, pick me up a good heart, Sir White-face.  The way betters here; spur me the horse.  Go faster! faster!  Nay, mind not for me; I can run like a deer.\"  So, with the horse trotting hard, and Dick running easily alongside, they crossed the remainder of the fen, and came out upon the banks of the river by the ferryman's hut.    CHAPTER III--THE FEN FERRY   The river Till was a wide, sluggish, clayey water, oozing out of fens, and in this part of its course it strained among some score of willow-covered, marshy islets.  It was a dingy stream; but upon this bright, spirited morning everything was become beautiful.  The wind and the martens broke it up into innumerable dimples; and the reflection of the sky was scattered over all the surface in crumbs of smiling blue.  A creek ran up to meet the path, and close under the bank the ferryman's hut lay snugly.  It was of wattle and clay, and the grass grew green upon the roof.  Dick went to the door and opened it.  Within, upon a foul old russet cloak, the ferryman lay stretched and shivering; a great hulk of a man, but lean and shaken by the country fever.  \"Hey, Master Shelton,\" he said, \"be ye for the ferry?  Ill times, ill times!  Look to yourself.  There is a fellowship abroad.  Ye were better turn round on your two heels and try the bridge.\"  \"Nay; time's in the saddle,\" answered Dick.  \"Time will ride, Hugh Ferryman.  I am hot in haste.\"  \"A wilful man!\" returned the ferryman, rising.  \"An ye win safe to the Moat House, y' have done lucky; but I say no more.\"  And then catching sight of Matcham, \"Who be this?\" he asked, as he paused, blinking, on the threshold of his cabin.  \"It is my kinsman, Master Matcham,\" answered Dick.  \"Give ye good day, good ferryman,\" said Matcham, who had dismounted, and now came forward, leading the horse.  \"Launch me your boat, I prithee; we are sore in haste.\"  The gaunt ferryman continued staring.  \"By the mass!\" he cried at length, and laughed with open throat.  Matcham coloured to his neck and winced; and Dick, with an angry countenance, put his hand on the lout's shoulder.  \"How now, churl!\" he cried.  \"Fall to thy business, and leave mocking thy betters.\"  Hugh Ferryman grumblingly undid his boat, and shoved it a little forth into the deep water.  Then Dick led in the horse, and Matcham followed.  \"Ye be mortal small made, master,\" said Hugh, with a wide grin; \"something o' the wrong model, belike.  Nay, Master Shelton, I am for you,\" he added, getting to his oars.  \"A cat may look at a king.  I did but take a shot of the eye at Master Matcham.\"  \"Sirrah, no more words,\" said Dick.  \"Bend me your back.\"  They were by that time at the mouth of the creek, and the view opened up and down the river.  Everywhere it was enclosed with islands.  Clay banks were falling in, willows nodding, reeds waving, martens dipping and piping.  There was no sign of man in the labyrinth of waters.  \"My master,\" said the ferryman, keeping the boat steady with one oar, \"I have a shrew guess that John-a-Fenne is on the island.  He bears me a black grudge to all Sir Daniel's.  How if I turned me up stream and landed you an arrow-flight above the path?  Ye were best not meddle with John Fenne.\"  \"How, then? is he of this company?\" asked Dick.  \"Nay, mum is the word,\" said Hugh.  \"But I would go up water, Dick.  How if Master Matcham came by an arrow?\" and he laughed again.  \"Be it so, Hugh,\" answered Dick.  \"Look ye, then,\" pursued Hugh.  \"Sith it shall so be, unsling me your cross-bow--so: now make it ready--good; place me a quarrel.  Ay, keep it so, and look upon me grimly.\"  \"What meaneth this?\" asked Dick.  \"Why, my master, if I steal you across, it must be under force or fear,\" replied the ferryman; \"for else, if John Fenne got wind of it, he were like to prove my most distressful neighbour.\"  \"Do these churls ride so roughly?\" Dick inquired.  \"Do they command Sir Daniel's own ferry?\"  \"Nay,\" whispered the ferryman, winking.  \"Mark me!  Sir Daniel shall down.  His time is out.  He shall down.  Mum!\"  And he bent over his oars.  They pulled a long way up the river, turned the tail of an island, and came softly down a narrow channel next the opposite bank.  Then Hugh held water in midstream.  \"I must land you here among the"]]]
