Put the mixture into a freezing can, stir slowly until frozen. Remove the dasher and stir in carefully the cream whipped to a stiff froth.  This will serve ten or twelve persons.   FROZEN CHOCOLATE       1 quart of milk      3 ounces of chocolate    2/3 cupful of sugar      1 pint of water    1/2 pint of cream, whipped      1 teaspoonful of vanilla  Grate the chocolate and put it in a double boiler with the water and sugar; let the water in the surrounding boiler boil fifteen minutes, beat well, and add the milk. Stir until thoroughly mixed, and the milk is very hot. Take from the fire, add the vanilla, and when the mixture is cold, freeze, turning slowly all the while. Serve in chocolate cups with the whipped cream on top.  This will fill nine chocolate cups.   FROZEN PINEAPPLE       2 large pineapples      1 quart of water      1 pound of sugar        Juice of one lemon  Peel the pineapples and grate them. Add the sugar to the water, stir until the sugar is dissolved, boil five minutes and cool; add the pineapple and lemon juice, and freeze, turning the freezer slowly.  This will serve eight or ten persons.   FROZEN COFFEE       1 quart of cold water    1/2 pound of sugar      6 heaping tablespoonfuls of finely ground coffee    1/2 pint of cream  Put the coffee and the water in a double boiler over the fire, and let the water in the surrounding boiler boil for at least twenty minutes after it begins to boil. Strain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth, add the sugar, stir until the sugar is dissolved, and stand aside until very cold. Add the cream and the unbeaten white of one egg. Freeze, turning the freezer slowly. This should be the consistency of a soft mush and very light.  Serve in coffee cups, either plain or with whipped cream on top.  This will serve six persons,   FROZEN PEACHES, No. 1       2 pounds of very ripe peaches      6 peach kernels      1 pint of water    1/2 pound of sugar        Juice of one lemon  Crack the kernels, chop them fine, add them to the sugar, add the water, and boil five minutes; strain and stand aside to cool. Pare the peaches, press them through a colander, add them to the cold syrup, turn into the freezer, and stir slowly until the mixture is frozen. If the peaches are colorless, add a few drops of cochineal before freezing.  This will serve eight persons.   FROZEN PEACHES, No. 2       1 quart of peach pulp      1 pint of cream    3/4 pound of sugar        Juice of one lemon  Add the lemon juice to the peach pulp, add the sugar, and stand aside, stirring every now and then until the sugar is dissolved. Freeze the mixture, stirring slowly; when frozen, remove the dasher, and fold in the cream whipped to a stiff froth.  This is one of the nicest ices for afternoon or evening collations.  This will serve eight persons; in stem glasses, ten persons.   FROZEN RASPBERRIES       1 quart of raspberries    3/4 pound of sugar      1 pint of water        Juice of one lemon  Add the sugar and the lemon juice to the berries, mash them with a potato masher. Let them stand one hour, add the water, and freeze.  This will serve eight persons.   FROZEN WATERMELON  Scrape the centre from a very ripe watermelon, chop quickly and press through a colander. To each pint of this juice, add a half cupful of sugar and four tablespoonfuls of sherry. Freeze until it is like wet snow. Serve in glasses. One pint will fill three stem glasses.   FROZEN STRAWBERRIES       1 quart of very ripe strawberries      1 pound of sugar      1 pint of water        Juice of one lemon  Add the sugar and lemon juice to the berries, let them stand one hour. Mash the berries through a colander, add the water, and freeze, turning the dasher constantly but very slowly.  This will serve eight persons.   FRAPPÉ  A frappé is nothing more nor less than a water ice partly frozen. For instance, Café Frappé is a partly frozen coffee. The mixture looks like wet snow. A Champagne Frappé is champagne packed in salt and ice and the bottles agitated until the champagne is partly frozen.   PARFAIT  A parfait is a dessert made from frozen whipped cream, sweetened and flavored. An old fashioned parfait was not frozen in an ice cream freezer; the mixture was packed at once into a mold, the mold packed in salt and ice to freeze for two or three hours. To be perfect, the mixture must be frozen on the outside to the depth of one and a half to two inches, with a soft centre. The quick parfait given under frozen desserts is now in general use.     MOUSSE   A mousse is a parfait frozen to the centre. These mixtures are not smooth like ice cream, but are frozen in crystals and to be exactly correct, should look like moss when cut.   BURNT ALMOND MOUSSE     1/4 pound of Jordan almonds      2 ounces of almond paste    2/3 cupful of powdered sugar      1 pint of thick cream      1 teaspoonful of almond extract  Whip the cream to a very stiff froth. Blanch, toast and grind the almonds, putting them through an ordinary meat grinder; rub them with the almond paste, adding the extract and about two tablespoonfuls of water or sherry. Sprinkle the sugar over the whipped cream, and then fold in the nut mixture. Pack at once into a mold, put on the lid, fasten the seam with a strip of muslin dipped in paraffin or melted suet, and pack in coarse salt and ice to freeze for two or three hours.  Serve plain or dusted with chopped almonds.  This will serve six persons.   COFFEE MOUSSE       1 pint of cream    1/2 cupful of powdered sugar      2 tablespoonfuls of coffee extract  Whip the cream to a stiff froth, sprinkle over the sugar, add the coffee extract, and, when well mixed, pack and freeze.  This will serve six persons.   EGYPTIAN MOUSSE     1/2 cupful of rice      1 tablespoonful of gelatin    2/3 cupful of sugar    1/4 pound of dates    1/2 pint of milk      1 pint of cream      1 teaspoonful of vanilla  Wash the rice, throw it into boiling water, boil rapidly twenty minutes; drain, add the milk, and cook in a double boiler fifteen minutes. Add the sugar, the gelatin that has been moistened in cold water, and the dates chopped. Take from the fire, add the vanilla, and when the mixture is cold, fold in carefully the whipped cream. Freeze as directed in a mold, and serve with cold quince jelly sauce.  This will serve ten persons.   DUCHESS MOUSSE       4 eggs    1/2 cupful of sugar      1 pint of cream      1 teaspoonful of vanilla      5 drops of cochineal  Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar until very, very light; fold in the whites of the eggs and the flavoring. Stand the bowl in a pan of boiling water and beat continuously until the ingredients are hot; take from the fire and beat constantly for ten minutes. When this is cool, fold in the cream whipped to a stiff froth, pack and freeze.  Serve with quince jelly sauce poured over the mousse.  This will serve eight persons.   PISTACHIO MOUSSE       4 ounces of pistachio nuts      1 tablespoonful of gelatin      1 pint of water      1 pint of cream    1/2 pound of sugar      1 teaspoonful of almond extract      3 drops of green coloring  Blanch the pistachio nuts and put them through a meat grinder. Boil the sugar and water for five minutes; when cool, add the coloring, the pistachio nuts, and the gelatin moistened in a little cold water. When this is cold, fold in the cream beaten to a stiff froth, and freeze in a mold as directed.  If this is not too well mixed the cream will separate, which makes the handsomer dessert. When the mousse is turned from the mold it will then have a solid white base with a rather green, beautiful transparent mixture at the top.  This will serve ten persons.   RICE MOUSSE WITH A COMPOTE OF MANDARINS     1/2 cupful of rice      1 tablespoonful of gelatin    2/3 cupful of sugar      1 pint of milk      1 pint of cream    1/4 pound of candied cherries      1 teaspoonful of vanilla  Wash and boil the rice in water for twenty minutes, drain, put it in a double boiler with the milk and sugar; stir until the sugar is dissolved, cover the kettle and cook slowly for twenty minutes. Press through a sieve, add the vanilla, and the gelatin covered with cold water. When this is cold, fold in the cream whipped to a stiff froth; pack and freeze.  I usually freeze this in the ordinary ice cream can; simply remove the dasher, put in the mixture and pack it to freeze for two or three hours.  While this is ripening, separate the mandarins into carpels. Boil together for five minutes one pound of sugar, a half pint of water and the juice of one lemon; take from the fire, add at once the carpels, stir lightly until they are thoroughly covered with the syrup and stand aside until _very cold_.  At serving time, wipe the outside of the freezing can with a warm towel, turn the mousse into the centre of a round dish, heap the carpels around the base and over the top in the form of a pyramid, pour over the syrup, and send at once to the table.  This will serve twelve persons.     SAUCES FOR ICE CREAMS   HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE     1/2 cupful of cream or condensed milk      2 ounces of chocolate      1 cupful of sugar      1 teaspoonful of vanilla  Put all the ingredients into a saucepan and stir over the fire until they reach boiling point, boil until the mixture slightly hardens when dropped into cold water. Add the vanilla, turn at once into the sauceboat and send to the table. This must be sufficiently thin to dip nicely over the ice cream.   MAPLE SAUCE       1 cupful of sugar      1 teaspoonful of lemon juice      1 cupful of water      1 teaspoonful of maple flavoring  Put half the sugar in an iron saucepan and stand it over the fire until it melts and browns, add hastily the water, the remaining sugar and the lemon juice, and boil for about two minutes; take from the fire and add the flavoring. This may be served plain, or with chopped fruit or nuts added.   CLARET SAUCE  Boil one cupful of sugar and a half"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8501"],["title","Ice Creams, Water Ices, Frozen Puddings Together with Refreshments for all (#8)"],["body","of water with a saltspoonful of cream of tartar for five minutes. Take from the fire and add one cupful of claret, and stand aside until icy cold.   NUT SAUCE       1 cupful of sugar    1/2 cupful of chopped nuts      1 cupful of water      1 teaspoonful of caramel      2 teaspoonfuls of sherry  Boil the sugar and water with a saltspoonful of cream of tartar or a teaspoonful of lemon juice for five minutes, take from the fire and add all the other ingredients, and stand aside to cool.   MONTROSE SAUCE     1/2 tablespoonful of granulated gelatin    1/4 cupful of sugar    1/2 cupful of milk      1 pint of cream      2 tablespoonfuls of brandy      1 teaspoonful of vanilla        Yolks of 3 eggs  Cover the gelatin with milk, let it soak a half hour, and put it, with the milk, in a double boiler over the fire. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the sugar together, add them to the hot milk, stir about one minute until the mixture begins to thicken, take from the fire, and, when cold, add the vanilla and the brandy, and, if you like it, four tablespoonfuls of sherry. Stand this aside until very, very cold.   ORANGE SAUCE     1/2 pint of orange juice    1/2 pint of water    1/2 cupful of sugar      1 tablespoonful of arrowroot        Whites of three eggs  Add the sugar to the water, and, when boiling hot, add the arrowroot moistened. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, add gradually the hot mixture, beating all the while. Add the orange juice, beat again. Turn it into a sauceboat and stand aside until very cold.   WALNUT SAUCE  Melt maple sugar with a little water, and add to each cupful of syrup a half cupful of chopped black walnuts. Maple syrup may also be used by adding half the quantity of boiling water and the nuts.     REFRESHMENTS FOR AFFAIRS   In arranging this matter, I have made an earnest effort to be of service to the housewife without or with one maid, as well as to those who are fortunate enough to have trained help.  It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that elaborate refreshments are entirely out of place at small afternoon or evening cards. An ice, with a wafer, or cake and coffee, served on card tables, are sufficient. A salad, with bread and butter sandwiches and coffee, or a salad sandwich with coffee, make a nice combination. Hot dishes, even light entrées, seem to call for a dessert, or another course and coffee. For wedding and other large receptions serve a greater variety of dishes--jellied meats, boned chicken, salads, sandwiches, ices, cakes and coffee. In winter creamed dishes may be served in paper cases on the same plate with salads and other cold dishes. Serve coffee in small cups after refreshments.  Many so called elaborate dishes are quite easily made, and entrées are frequently quite as good when rewarmed.  Chicken croquettes may be made and fried early in the day, ready to rewarm on brown paper in a baking pan in a hot oven ten minutes before serving time. Sandwiches will keep perfectly well for several hours if wrapped in a damp towel and closed in a tin bread box. Salad sandwiches are better, however, if made as near serving time as possible.  If a large reception is to be given, even with good help, prepare as many dishes as possible the day before, to avoid confusion on the fixed day.  Refreshments for small affairs need not necessarily cost much time or money. A half cupful of chopped left-over steak, a couple of chops or a bit of chicken or a box of sardines, make a good foundation for molds of tomato jelly. Served with bread and butter sandwiches and coffee they are quite sufficient for afternoon or evening cards.  Many of the ices in this book are new and attractive. The new sorbets are liked by those who are always striving for a change. Many are old and reliable.  At large affairs, serve from the dining table.  At card parties, large and small, serve on the card tables, using a small tea cloth on each table.  At afternoon teas, serve from the tea table in the drawing room.  At lawn parties, serve from a large table on the lawn. Small tables may be placed here and there for the convenience of guests.  Every day afternoon tea may be served, in the summer on the porch, in the winter, in the living room or library.  If two dishes only are served, be sure that they harmonize with each other and with the manner of service.  Suitable and hygienic combinations are always to be considered, but the æsthetic side seems to me of equal importance.   COFFEE FOR LARGE HOME AFFAIRS  Allow eleven ounces of finely ground coffee to each gallon of water. This will serve twenty five persons with one coffee cup each, and forty persons with after-dinner cups. The better way to make a large quantity of coffee without an urn is to purchase a new wash boiler. Wash it and put in the required quantity of water (cold). Weigh the coffee and divide it into half pound lots. Put each lot in a small cheese cloth bag; tie the top of the bag, allowing room for the coffee to swell. Put the bags in the water an hour before serving time, bring slowly to a boil, and then boil rapidly for five minutes. Remove the bags at once, pressing them well. Keep the coffee very hot until it is all served.  Coffee is not spoiled by being kept at boiling point for some time, if the grounds are removed.     SOUPS   BOUILLON       2 pounds of chopped lean beef      2 quarts of cold water      1 small onion     12 cloves      2 tablespoonfuls of sugar      2 teaspoonfuls of salt     12 whole peppercorns        A dash of cayenne        Juice of half a lemon  Put the sugar in the soup kettle, add the onion, sliced, and shake until the onion is thoroughly browned and the sugar almost burned; add the meat, shake it for a moment, and add the water. Cover, bring to boiling point, and put over a slow fire to simmer for two hours. Add all the seasonings and simmer one hour longer. Strain through a colander, pressing the meat. Beat the whites of two eggs slightly, then whisk them into the warm bouillon, and add the juice of the lemon. Bring to boiling point, boil rapidly five minutes, let it stand a moment, and strain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth. This should stand until it is perfectly cold, so that every particle of fat may be removed from the surface. Reheat to serve.  This will serve ten persons, using ordinary bouillon cups.   CLAM BOUILLON      50 large clams      2 quarts of water     12 whole peppercorns    1/2 teaspoonful of celery seed  Wash and scrub the clams thoroughly. Put them, a few at a time, in the soup kettle, the bottom of which has been covered with a pint of boiling water. Boil rapidly, take the clams out with a skimmer, and put in another lot, and so continue until all the clams have been cooked. Remove them from the shells, saving all the liquor. Chop and return them, with the liquor and remaining water, to the soup kettle. Simmer gently a half hour, then add the peppercorns, crushed, and the celery seed. Cover the kettle, take it from the fire and allow it to stand until perfectly cold. Strain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth. Reheat to serve.  This will serve fifteen persons.   BELLEVUE BOUILLON       1 quart of plain or chicken bouillon      1 quart of clam bouillon    1/2 pint of cream        Paprika  This is one of the most elegant of all bouillons. Heat the bouillons separately, mix them at the last minute, pour at once into heated cups, put a tablespoonful of whipped cream on the top of each cup, garnish with a dusting of paprika, and send to the table.  This will serve ten persons; in a pinch, twelve.   CHICKEN BOUILLON       1 four pound fowl      3 quarts of water      1 onion      2 tablespoonfuls of sugar      1 teaspoonful of salt      1 bay leaf      1 saltspoonful of celery seed, or one half cupful of chopped celery      1 saltspoonful of black pepper  Draw the chicken and cut it up as for a fricassee. Scald and skin the feet, and crack them thoroughly with your cleaver knife. Put the sugar in a soup kettle, add the onion, sliced, shake over a quick fire until brown, add the chicken and the water, bring to boiling point, and skim. Simmer gently for two hours. Add all the seasonings, simmer one hour longer, and strain. Add the juice of half a lemon and the whites of two eggs, slightly beaten. Boil rapidly five minutes, and strain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth. Reheat to serve. This may be used in place of beef bouillon, with the clam broth, for Bellevue bouillon.  This will serve twelve persons.   OYSTER BOUILLON      50 fat oysters      2 quarts of water     12 whole peppercorns     12 whole allspice  1-1/2 teaspoonfuls of salt  Drain and wash the oysters. Throw them at once in a hot kettle, shake until the gills have curled, cover the kettle, and simmer gently for fifteen minutes. Drain again, this time saving the liquor. Return it to the kettle with the peppercorns and allspice, crushed, and water. Chop the oysters with a silver knife, put them back in the kettle, simmer gently a half hour, and add the salt. Strain through two thicknesses of cheese cloth, reheat and serve with whipped cream on top of each cup.  This serves fifteen persons.   TOMATO PUREE à la RORER       1 quart can of tomatoes    1/2 pint of cream      1 quart of chicken bouillon      2 tablespoonfuls of butter      2 tablespoonfuls of arrowroot      1 bay leaf      1 blade of mace      1 onion      1 teaspoonful of salt      1 teaspoonful of paprika  Add the onion, paprika, mace and bay leaf to the tomatoes, boil rapidly five minutes. Moisten the arrowroot with three or four tablespoonfuls of cold water, add it to the hot tomato, boil ten minutes, and press through a sieve. Add the chicken bouillon, boil ten minutes, add the butter, and, when the butter is thoroughly dissolved, turn at once into cups. Put a tablespoonful of whipped cream on top of each, and serve.  This will serve ten persons.   GLAZE  Glaze is absolutely necessary for fine cooking, either for the browning of sweetbreads,"]]]
