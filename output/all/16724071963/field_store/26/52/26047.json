Then in a voice rich and vibrant with care-free joy he burst into song:  \"Yassah!\"    \"When I goes out ter promenade   I dress so fine and gay   I'm bleeged to take my dog along   Ter keep de gals away.\"  Again his laughter rang in peals of sonorous fun. They joined in his laugh.  A stable boy climbed the fence and called:  \"Don't ye want yer hosses, Marse Custis?\" He was jealous of Sam's popularity.  Custis glanced at Phil.  \"Sure. Let's ride.\"  \"All right, Ned--saddle them.\"  The boy leaped to the ground and in five minutes led two horses to the gate. As they galloped past the house for the long stretch of white roadway that led across the river to the city, Phil smiled as he saw Jeb Stuart emerge from the rose garden with Mary Lee. Custis ignored the unimportant incident.    CHAPTER III   Stuart led Mary to a seat beneath an oak, brushed the dust away with his cap and asked her to honor him. He bowed low over her hand and dared to kiss it.  She passed the gallant act as a matter of course and sat down beside him with quiet humor. She knew the symptoms. A born flirt, as every true Southern girl has always been, she eyed his embarrassment with surprise. She knew that he was going to speak under the resistless impulse of youth and romance, and that no hearts would be broken on either side no matter what the outcome.  She watched him indulgently. She had to like him. He was the kind of boy a girl couldn't help liking. He was vital, magnetic and exceptionally good looking. He sang and danced and flirted, but beneath the fun and foolishness slumbered a fine spirit, tender, reverent, deeply religious. It was this undercurrent of strength that drew the girl. He was always humming a song, his heart bubbling over with joy. He had never uttered an oath or touched a drop of liquor amid all the gaiety of the times in which he lived.  \"Miss Mary,\" he began slowly.  \"Now Jeb,\" she interrupted. \"You don't _have_ to, you know--\"  Stuart threw his head back, laughed, and sang a stanza from \"Annie Laurie\" in a low, tender voice. He paused and faced his fair tormentor.  \"Miss Mary, I've got to!\"  \"You don't have to make love to me just because you're my brother's classmate--\"  \"You know I'm not!\" he protested.  \"You're about to begin.\"  \"But not for that reason, Miss Mary--\"  He held her gaze so seriously that she blushed before she could recover her poise. He saw his advantage and pressed it.  \"I'm telling you that I love you because you're the most adorable girl I've ever known.\"  His boyish, conventional words broke the spell.  \"I appreciate the tribute which you so gallantly pay me, Sir Knight. But I happen to know that the moonlight, the music of a dance, the song of birds this morning and the beauty of the landscape move you, as they should. You're young. You're too good looking. You're fine and unspoiled and I like you, Jeb. But you don't know yet what love means.\"  \"I do, Miss Mary, I do.\"  \"You don't and neither do I. You're in love with love. And so am I. It's the morning of life and why shouldn't we be like this?\"  \"There's no hope?\" he asked dolefully.  \"Of course, there's hope. There's something fine in you, and you'll find yourself in the world when you ride forth to play your part. And I'll follow you with tender pride.\"  \"But not with love,\" he sighed.  \"Maybe--who knows?\" she smiled.  \"Is that all the hope you can give me?\"  \"Isn't it enough?\"  He gazed into her serious eyes a moment and laughed with boyish enthusiasm.  \"Yes, it is, Miss Mary! You're glorious. You're wonderful. You make me ashamed of my foolishness. You inspire me to do things. And I'm going to do them for your sake.\"  \"For your own sake, because God has put the spark in your soul. Your declaration of love has made me very happy. We're too young yet to take it seriously. We must both live our life in its morning before we settle down to the final things. They'll come too soon.\"  \"I'm going to love you always, Miss Mary,\" he protested.  \"I want you to. But you'll probably marry another girl.\"  \"Never!\"  \"And I know you'll be her loyal knight, her devoted slave. It's a way our Southern boys have. And it's beautiful.\"  Stuart studied the finely chiseled face with a new reverence.  \"Miss Mary, you've let me down so gently. I don't feel hurt at all.\"  A sweet silence fell between them. A breeze blew the ringlets of the girl's hair across the pink of her cheek. A breeze from the garden laden with the mingled perfume of roses. A flock of wild ducks swung across the lawn high in the clear sky and dipped toward the river. Across the fields came a song of slaves at work in the cornfield, harvesting the first crop of peas planted between the rows.  Stuart caught her hand, pressed it tenderly and kissed it.  \"You're an angel, Miss Mary. And I'm going to worship you, if you won't let me love you.\"  The girl returned his earnest look with a smile and slowly answered:  \"All right, Beauty Stuart, we'll see--\"    CHAPTER IV   The dinner at night was informal. Colonel Lee had invited three personal friends from Washington. He hoped in the touch of the minds of these leaders to find some relief from the uneasiness with which the reading of Mrs. Stowe's book had shadowed his imagination.  The man about whom he was curious was Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, the most brilliant figure in the Senate. In the best sense he represented the national ideal. A Northern man, he had always viewed the opinions and principles of the South with broad sympathy.  The new Senator from Georgia, on the other hand, had made a sensation in the house as the radical leader of the South. Lee wondered if he were as dangerous a man as the conservative members of the Whig party thought. Toombs had voted the Whig ticket, but his speeches on the rights of the South on the Slavery issues had set him in a class by himself.  Mr. and Mrs. Pryor had spent the night of the dance at Arlington and had consented to stay for dinner.  Douglas had captured the young Virginia congressman. And Mrs. Douglas had become an intimate friend of Mrs. Pryor.  When Douglas entered the library and pressed Lee's hand, the master of Arlington studied him with keen interest. He was easily the most impressive figure in American politics. The death of Calhoun and Clay and the sudden passing of Webster had left but one giant on the floor of the Senate. They called him the \"Little Giant.\" He was still a giant. He had sensed the approaching storm of crowd madness and had sought the age-old method of compromise as the safety valve of the nation.  He had not read history in vain. He knew that all statesmanship is the record of compromise--that compromise is another name for reason. The Declaration of Independence was a compromise between the radicalism of Thomas Jefferson and the conservatism of the colonies. In the original draft of the Declaration, Jefferson had written a paragraph arraigning slavery which had been omitted:  \"He (the King of Great Britain) has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life and liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him; capturing and carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. This piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the _Christian_ King of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where men should be bought and sold, he prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished dye, he is now exciting these very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, by murdering the people on whom he also obtruded them; thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.\"  This indictment of Slavery and the Slave trade was stricken from the Declaration of Independence in deference to the opposition of both Northern and Southern slave owners who held that the struggling young colonies must have labor at all hazards.  Lee knew that the Constitution also was a compromise of conflicting interests. But for the spirit of compromise--of reason--this instrument of human progress could never have been created. The word \"Slave\" or \"Slavery\" does not occur within it, and yet three of its most important provisions established the institution of chattel slavery as the basis of industrial life. The statesmen who wrote the Constitution did not wish these clauses embodied in it. Yet the Union could not have been established without them. Our leaders reasoned, and reasoned wisely, that Slavery must perish in the progress of human society, and, therefore, they accepted the compromise.  There has never been a statesman in the history of the world who has not used this method of constructive progress. There will never be a statesman who succeeds who can use any other method in dealing with masses of his fellow men.  Douglas was the coming constructive statesman of the republic and all eyes were being focused on him. His life at the moment was the fevered center of the nation's thought. That his ambitions were boundless no one who knew the man doubted. That his patriotism was as genuine and as great all knew at last.  Lee studied every feature of his fine face. No eye could miss him in an assemblage of people, no matter how great the numbers. His compact figure was erect, aggressive, dominant. A personage, whose sense of power came from within, not without. He was master of himself and of"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8462"],["title","The Man in Gray: A Romance of North and South (#4)"],["body","ers. He looked the lion and he was one. The lines of his face were handsome in the big sense, strong, regular, masculine. He drew young men as a magnet. His vitality inspired them. His stature was small in height, measured by inches, but of such dignity, power and magnetism that he suggested Napoleon.  He smiled into Colonel Lee's face and his smile lighted the room. Every man and woman present was warmed by it.  Douglas had scarcely greeted Mrs. Lee and passed into an earnest conversation with the young Congressman when Robert Toombs of Georgia entered.  Toombs had become within two years the successor of John C. Calhoun. He had the genius of Calhoun, eloquence as passionate, as resistless; and he had all of Calhoun's weaknesses. He called a spade a spade. He loathed compromise. Three years before he had swept the floor and galleries of the House with a burst of impassioned eloquence that had made him a national figure.  Lifting his magnificent head he had cried:  \"I do not hesitate to avow before this House and the Country, and in the presence of the living God, that if by your legislation you seek to drive us from the Territory of California and New Mexico, purchased by the blood of Southern white people, and to abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia, thereby attempting to fix a national degradation upon half the States of this Confederacy, _I am for disunion_. The Territories are the common property of the United States. You are their common agents; it is your duty while they are in the Territorial state to remove all impediments to their free enjoyment by both sections--the slave holder and the non-slave holder!\"  He was the man of iron will, of passionate convictions. He might lead a revolution. He could not compromise.  His rapidly growing power was an ominous thing in the history of the South. Lee studied his face with increasing fascination.  In this gathering no man or woman thought of wealth as the source of power or end of life. No one spoke of it. Office, rank, position, talent, beauty, charm, personality--these things alone could count. These men and women _lived_. They did not merely exist. They were making the history of the world and yet they refused to rush through life. Their souls demanded hours of repose, of thought, of joy and they took them.  Toombs' pocket was stuffed with a paper-backed edition of a French play. It was his habit to read them in the original with keen enjoyment in moments of leisure. The hum of social life filled the room and strife was forgotten. Douglas and Toombs were boys again and Lee was their companion.  Mary Lee managed to avoid Stuart and took her seat beside Phil Sheridan--not to tease her admirer but to give to her Western guest the warmest welcome of the old South. She knew the dinner would be a revelation to Phil and she would enjoy his appreciation.  The long table groaned under the luxuries of the season. Course succeeded course, cooked with a delicate skill unknown to the world of to-day. The oysters, fresh, fat, luscious, were followed by diamond-back terrapin stew as a soup.  Phil tasted it and whispered to his fair young hostess.  \"Miss Mary, what is this I'm eating?\"  \"Don't you like it?\"  \"I never expected to taste it on earth. I've only dreamed about it on high.\"  \"It's only terrapin stew. We serve it as a soup.\"  \"The angels made it.\"  \"No, Aunt Hannah.\"  \"I won't take it back. Angels only could brew this soup.\"  The terrapin was followed by old Virginia ham and turnip greens. And then came the turkey with chestnut stuffing and jellies. The long table, flashing with old china and silver, held the staples of ham and turkey as ornaments as well as dainties for the palate. The real delicacies were served later, the ducks which Doyle had sent the Colonel, and plate after plate of little, brown, juicy birds called sora, so tender and toothsome they could be eaten bones and all.  When Phil wound up with cakes and custards, apples, pears and nuts from the orchard and fields, his mind was swimming in a dream of luxury. And over it all the spirit of true hospitality brooded. A sense of home and reality as intimate, as genuine as if he sat beside his mother's chair in the little cottage in Ohio.  \"Lord save me,\" he breathed. \"If I stay here long I'll have but one hope, to own a plantation and a home like this--\"  Toombs sat on Lee's right and Douglas on his left. Mr. and Mrs. Pryor occupied the places of honor beside Mrs. Lee.  The Colonel's keen eye studied Douglas with untiring patience. To his rising star, the man who loved the Union, was drawn as by a magnet. Toombs, the Whig, belonged to his own Party, the aristocracy of brains and the inheritors of the right to leadership. He was studying Toombs with growing misgivings. He dreaded the radicalism within the heart of the Southern Whig.  His eye rested on Sam, serving the food as assistant butler in Ben's absence. In the kink of his hair, the bulge of his smiling lips, the spread of his nostrils, the whites of his rolling eyes, he saw the Slave. He saw the mystery, the brooding horror, the baffling uncertainty, the insoluble problem of such a man within a democracy of self-governing freemen. He stood bowing and smiling over his guests, in shape a man. And yet in racial development a million years behind the wit and intelligence of the two leaders at his side.  Over this dusky figure, from the dawn of American history our fathers had wrangled and compromised. More than once he had threatened to divide or destroy the Union. Reason and the compromises of great minds had saved us. In Sam he saw this grinning skeleton at his feast.  He could depend on the genius of Douglas when the supreme crisis came. He felt the quality of his mind tonight. But could Douglas control the mob impulse of the North where such appeals as _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ had gripped the souls of millions and reason no longer ruled life?  There was the rub.  There was no question of the genius of Douglas. The question was could any leadership count if the mob, not the man, became our real ruler? The task of Douglas was to hold the fanatic of the North while he soothed the passions of the radical of the South. Henry Clay had succeeded. But _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ had not been written in his day.  Toombs was becoming a firebrand. His eloquence was doing in the South what Mrs. Stowe's novel was doing in the North--preparing the soil for revolution--planting gunpowder under the foundations of society.  Could these forces yet be controlled or were they already beyond control?    CHAPTER V   After dinner, Jeb Stuart succeeded in separating Mary from Phil and began again his adoration. The men adjourned to the library to discuss the Presidential Campaign and weigh the chances of General Scott against Franklin Pierce. The comment of Toombs was grim in its sarcasm and early let him out of the discussion.  \"It doesn't matter in the least, gentlemen, who is elected in November,\" he observed. \"There's nothing before the country as yet. Not even an honest-to-God man.\"  Lee shook his head gravely.  Toombs parried his protest.  \"I know, Colonel Lee, you're fond of the old General. You fought with him in Mexico. But--\" he dropped his voice to a friendly whisper--\"all the same, you know that what I say is true.\"  He took a cigar from the mantel, lighted it and waved to the group.  \"I'll take a little stroll and smoke.\"  Custis took Phil to the cottage of the foreman to see a night school in session.  \"You mean the overseer's place?\" Phil asked eagerly, as visions of Simon Legree flashed through his mind.  \"No--I mean Uncle Ike's cottage. He's the foreman of the farm. We have no white overseer.\"  Phil was shocked. He had supposed every Southern plantation had a white overseer as slave driver with a blacksnake whip in his hand. A negro foreman was incredible. As a matter of fact there were more negro foremen than white overseers in the South.  In Uncle Ike's cottage by the light of many candles the school for boys was in session. Custis' brother \"Rooney,\" was the teacher. He had six pupils besides Sam. Not one of them knew his lesson to-night and Rooney was furious.  As Phil and Custis entered, he was just finishing a wrathful lecture. His pupils were standing in a row grinning their apologies.  \"I've told you boys for the last three weeks that I won't stand this. You don't have to go to school to me if you don't want to. But if you join my school you've got to study. Do you hear me?\"  \"Yassah!\" came the answer in solid chorus.  \"Well, you'll do more than hear me to-night. You're going to heed what I say. I'm going to thrash the whole school.\"  Sam broke into a loud laugh. And a wail of woe came from every dusky figure.  \"Dar now!\"  \"Hear dat, folks--?\"  \"I been a tellin' ye chillun--\"  \"I lubs my spellin' book--but, oh, dat hickory switch!\"  \"Oh, Lordy--\"  \"Gib us anudder chance, Marse Rooney!\"  \"Not another chance,\" was the stern answer. \"Lay off your coats.\"  They began to peel their coats. Big, strapping, husky fellows nudging one another and grinning at their fourteen-year-old schoolmaster. It was no use to protest.  They knew they deserved it. A whipping was one of the minor misfortunes of life. Its application was universal. No other method of discipline had yet been dreamed by the advanced thinkers and rulers of the world. \"Spare the rod and spoil the child\" was accepted as the Word of God and only a fool could doubt it. The rod was the emblem of authority for child, pupil, apprentice and soldier. The negro slave as a workman got less of it than any other class. It was the rule of a Southern master never to use the rod on a slave except for crime if it could be avoided. To flog one for laziness was the exception, not the rule.  The old Virginia gentleman prided himself particularly on the tenderness and care with which he guarded the life of his servants. If the weather was cold and his men exposed, he waited to see that they had dry clothes and a"]]]
