The truths in which we agree are part of the Catholic faith.  In the words of Dr. Dollinger, \"we can say each to the other as baptized, we are on either side, brothers and sisters in Christ.  In the great garden of the Lord, let us shake hands over these confessional hedges, and let us break them down, so as to be able to embrace one another altogether. These hedges are doctrinal divisions about which either we or you are in error.  If you are in the wrong, we do not hold you morally culpable; for your education, surroundings, knowledge, and training made the adherence to these doctrines excusable and even right.  Let us examine, compare, and investigate the matter together, and we shall discover the precious pearl of peace and unity; and then let us join hands together in cultivating and cleansing the garden of the Lord, which is overgrown with weeds.\"  There are blessed signs that the Holy Spirit is deepening the spiritual life of widely separated brothers.  Historical Churches are feeling the pulsation of a new life from the Incarnate God.  All Christian folk see that the Holy Spirit has passed over these human barriers and set His seal to the labors of separated brethren in Christ. The ever-blessed Comforter is quickening in Christian hearts the divine spirit of charity.  Christians are learning more and more the theology which centres in the person of Jesus Christ.  It is this which worldwide is creating a holy enthusiasm to stay the flood of intemperance, impurity, and sin at home, and gather lost heathen folk into the fold of Christ.  In our age every branch of the Church can call over the roll of its confessors and martyr, and so link its history to the purest ages of the Church.  We would not rob them of one sheaf they have gathered into the garner of the Lord.  We share in every victory and we rejoice in every triumph.  There is not one of that great company who have washed their robes white in the blood of the Lamb, who is not our kinsman in Christ.  Brothers in Christ of every name, shall we not pray for the healing of the wounds of the body of Christ, that the world may believe in him?  We are perplexed by the unbelief and sin of our time.  The Christian faith is assailed not only with scoffs of old as Celsus and Julian, but also with the keenest intellectual criticism of Divine revelation, the opposition of alleged scientific facts, and a Corinthian worldliness whose motto is \"Eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.\"  In many places Christian homes are dying out.  Crime and impurity are coming in as a flood, and anarchy raises its hated form in a land where all men are equal before the law.  The lines between the Church and the world are dim.  Never did greater problems confront a council of the Church.  An Apostolic Church has a graver work than discussion about its name or the amending of its canons and rubrics.  I fear that some of this unbelief is a revolt from a caricature of God.  These mechanical ideas about the universe are the outcome of a mechanical theology which has lost sight of the Fatherhood of God.  There is much honest unbelief.  In these yearnings of humanity, in its clubs, brotherhoods, and orders, in their readiness to share all things with their brothers, I see unconscious prophecies of the brotherhood of all men as the children of one God and Father.  Denunciation will not silence unbelief.  The name infidel has lost its terrors.  There in only one remedy.  It is in the spirit, the power, and the love of Jesus Christ.  Philosophy cannot touch the want. It offers no hand to grasp, no Saviour to trust, no God to save.  When men see in us the hand, the heart, and the love of Christ, they will believe in the brotherhood of men and the Fatherhood of God.  There was nothing which impressed your bishops in the late visit to England more than the service in the cathedral at Durham.  The church, with its thousand years of history was thronged.  The chants were sung by two thousand choristers in surplices.  The sermon was preached by the Bishop of Western New York.  This grand service was to set apart some Bible readers and lay-preachers to go into the collieries to tell these toilers of the love of Jesus Christ.  The same awful problems stare us in the face,--the centralization of swarms of souls in the cities; the wealth of the nation in fewer hands; competition making a life-and-death struggle for bread; the poorest sinking into hopeless despair; and the richest often forgetting that Lazarus at his gate is a child of the same God and Father.  We, too, must send our best men and women wherever there is sin, sorrow, and death, to work and suffer, and, if need be, die for Christ.  We are living in the eventide of the world, when all things point toward the second coming of our King.  God has placed the English-speaking people in the fore-part of the nations.  They number one-tenth of the human family, and I believe God calls them to do the work of the last time.  The wealth of the world is largely in Christian hands.  There never have been such opportunities for Christian work.  Never such a harvest awaited the husbandman.   You may tell me of difficulties and dangers.  We have only one answer. Sin, sorrow, and death are not the inventions of a Christian priest. \"There is only one Name under heaven whereby any man can be saved.\"  We have nothing to do with results.  It is ours to work and pray, and pray and work and die.  So falls the seed into the earth, and so God gives the harvest.  When the Church sends out embassies commensurate with the dignity of our King, it will be time to talk of failure.  Is the kingdom of Christ the only kingdom which has not the right to lay tribute on its citizens?  The only failure is the failure to do God's work.  Was it failure when Dr. Hill of blessed memory laid the foundation for that Christian school which the wisest statesmen say is the chief factor in the regeneration of Greece?  Was it failure when James Lloyd Breck, our apostle of the wilderness, carried the Gospel to the Indians?  Did Williams, Selwyn, and Patteson fail in Polynesia?  Was it failure when Hoffman and Auer died for Christ in Africa?  Have your great-hearted sons failed who have followed in the footsteps of the saintly Kemper, and laid with tears and prayers foundations for Christian schools which are the glory of the West?  Has the Gospel failed in Japan, where a nation is awakening into the life of Christian civilization? Never has God given His Church more blessed rewards.  The century which has passed is only our school of preparation.  The voice of God's Providence says: \"Speak to the children of Israel that they go forward.\"  We have some problems peculiar to ourselves.  Twenty-five years ago four millions of slaves received American citizenship.  The nation owes them a debt of gratitude.  During all the horrors of our civil war they were the protectors of Southern women and children.  Knowing the failure of their masters would be the guarantee of the freedom, there was not one act that master or slave might wish to blot.  We ought not to forget it, and God will not.  To-day there are eight millions.  They are here to stay. They will not be disfranchised.  Through them Africa can be redeemed. They ought to be our fellow-citizens in the kingdom of God.  In a great crisis of missions the Holy Ghost sent Philip on a long journey to preach Christ to one man of Ethiopia.  The same blessed Spirit of God calls us in the love of Christ to carry the Gospel in the Church to the millions of colored citizens of the United States.  Brethren, the time is short.  Since our last council nine of our noblest bishops have died.  Since I was consecrated, fifty-four bishops have entered into the rest if the people of God.  It is eventide.  A little more work, a few more toils and prayers, and we who have lived and loved and worked together shall have a harvest in heaven.      II. SERMON AT THE FARIBAULT CELEBRATION OF THE CENTENNIAL OF THE INAUGURATION OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, 1789-1889.   \"Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebeneser, saying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.\"-- 1 SAMUEL vii. 12.   No words are more fitting on this Centennial day.  One hundred years ago George Washington was inaugurated the first President of the United States.  Words are powerless to express the grateful thoughts which swell patriot hearts.  Save that people whom God led out of Egypt with His pillar of fire and His pillar of cloud, I know of no nation whose history is so full of the bounty of God.  This country was settled by Englishmen.  They were bound by ties of affection to the mother country. They were not rebels, they were loyal, God-fearing men.  The English crown had violated rights which were guaranteed to them by the Magna Charta, which brave barons, headed by Bishop Stephen Langton, had wrung from King John and which under God has made English-speaking people the representatives of constitutional government throughout the world.  It was not until every plea for justice had been spurned, their sacred rights trampled upon, and the warnings of the wisest English statesmen unheeded, that the American colonies resolved to be independent and free.  On the 5th of September, 1774, fifty-five delegates, from eleven colonies, met in Smith's tavern, Philadelphia, and at the invitation of the carpenters of that city adjourned to their hall.  Questions arose as to the numerical influence of the colonies.  Patrick Henry voiced the sentiment of Congress, \"I am not a Virginian, I am an American.\"  John Jay, who represented the conservative element said, \"We have not come to make a constitution; the measure of arbitrary power is not full, it must run over before we undertake to frame a government.\"  It was proposed to open Congress with prayer.  Objections were made on account"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8731"],["title","Five Sermons (#3)"],["body"," the religious differences of the delegates.  Old Samuel Adams rose, with his long white hair streaming on his shoulders (the same earnest Puritan who in 1768 had written to England, \"We hope in God that no such establishment as the Protestant Episcopate shall ever take place in America,\") and said, \"Gentlemen, shall it be said that it is possible that there can be any religious difference which will prevent men from crying to that God who alone can save them?  Puritan as I am, I move that the Rev. Dr. Duché, minister of Christ Church in the city, be asked to open this Congress with prayer.\"  John Adams, writhing to his wife, said, \"Never can I forget that scene.  There were twenty Quakers standing by my side and we were all bathed in tears.  When Psalms for the day were read, it seemed as if Heaven itself was pleading for the oppressed: 'O Lord, fight thou against them that fight against me. Lord, who is like unto Thee to defend the poor and needy.  Avenge Thou my cause, my Lord and my God.'\"  Although filled with indignation at the blood which had been shed in Boston, Congress nevertheless issued an appeal to the people of England: \"You have been told that we are impatient of government and desire independency.  These are calumnies. Permit us to be free as you are, and our union with you will be our greatest glory.  But if your ministers sport with human rights, if neither the voice of justice, the principles of the constitution, nor humanity will restrain them from shedding human blood in an impious cause, 'we will never submit.'  We ask peace, liberty and safety, and for this we have laid our prayer at the feet of the king as a loving father.\"  The battles at Lexington, Concord and Ticonderoga preceded the second meeting of Congress in May, 1775.  Their plea for justice had been spurned.  The outlook was dark as midnight.  These brave men represented no government, they had no power to make laws, they had no officers to execute them, they could not impose customs, they had no army, they did not own a foot of land, they owed the use of their hall to the courtesy of the artisans of Philadelphia.  On the 12th of June Congress made its first appeal to the people of twelve colonies, ( Georgia was not represented).  It was a solemn call for the whole people to observe one and the same day as a day of fasting and prayer \"for the restoration of the invaded rights of America and reconciliation with the parent state.\"  They who sought the protection of God knew that under God they must protect themselves.  All hearts turned to George Washington, a delegate from Virginia, and he was unanimously chosen to be commander-in-chief.  When Congress met in July, 1776, the people had been branded as traitors; the slaves of Virginia had been incited to insurrection, the torch and tomahawk of the savage had been let loose on frontier settlements, an army of foreign mercenaries had landed on their shores, their ports were blockaded, an the army under Washington for their defence only numbered 6,749 men.  On the second day of July, 1776, without one dissenting colony, the representatives of the thirteen colonies resolved that \"these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved.\"  Two days later Benjamin Harrison, the great-grandfather of our present president, the chairman of the committee of the whole, reported to Congress the form in which that resolution was to be published to the world, and the reasons by which it was to be justified. It was the work of Thomas Jefferson, then aged thirty-three, and never did graver responsibility rest on a young man than the preparation of that immortal paper, and never was the duty more nobly fulfilled.  In the original draft of the declaration there was the allegation that the king \"had prostituted his negative by suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or restrain this execrable commerce in human beings.\"  This was struck out, as Mr. Jefferson tells us, in \"complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, not without tenderness to Northern Brethren who held slaves.\"  Time forbids my calling over the roll of these noble patriots who signed their names to our Magna Charta. There is John Adams, of whom Jefferson said, \"He was our Colossus on that floor, and spoke with such power as to move us from our seats.\" Benjamin Franklin, printer philosopher and statesman.  Roger Sherman, of whom John Adams said, \"He is honest as an angel and firm as Mount Atlas.\"  Charles Carroll, who, when a member said, \"Oh, Carroll, you will get off, there are so many Carrolls,\" stepped back to the desk and wrote after his name, \"of Carrollton.\"  John Hancock, who, when elected speaker, Benjamin Harrison had playfully seated in the speaker's chair and said, \"We will show Mother Britain how little we care for her, by making a Massachusetts man our president, whom she has by proclamation excluded from pardon.\"  A friend said to John Hancock, \"You have signed your name large.\"   \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I wish John Bull to read it without spectacles.\"  Robert Morris, the financier and treasurer of the Revolution.  Elbridge Gerry, the youngest member, the friend of Gen. Warren, to whom Warren had said the night before the battle of Bunker Hill, \"It is sweet to die for our country.\"  What a roll of names! the silver-tongued Rutledge, brave Stockton, wise Rush, Lee--fifty-five noble names, not one of whom who did not know that, as one member said, \"If we do not hang together, we shall hang separately.\"  It was not timidity which made any of the delegates hesitate to take the irrevocable step. All the associations of their lives, all the traditions and memories of the past bound them by ties of kindred and affection to the mother country.  They were venturing on an unknown sea; there were no charts to guide them, no precedents to follow.  The truth was, as Jefferson so tersely said, \"The people wait for us to lead the way.  The question is not whether by a declaration of independence we shall make ourselves what we are not, but whether we shall declare a fact which exists.\"  So also John Adams said, \"The Revolution was effected before the war commenced.\"   I cannot tell the story of the seven year's war.  The articles of confederation were sent to the States in 1778, but the last of the thirteen States, Maryland, did not adopt them until March, 1781. Congress under he confederacy dealt with the States and did not have the confidence or the love of the people.  It required nine States to pass any measure of importance.  During the war the confederacy was a pitiable failure.  It issued bills which no one would take, its certificates of indebtedness and promises to pay were so worthless that it gave rise to the proverb, \"Not worth a continental.\"  Robert Morris, the financier, pleaded hopelessly for help.  Alexander Hamilton denounced the confederation as \"neither fit for war nor peace.\"  Even Washington, always hopeful, wrote in 1781: \"Our troops are fast approaching nakedness; our hospitals are without medicine; our sick are without meat; our public works are at a standstill; in a word, we are at the end of our tether, and now or never deliverance must come.\"  At last victory came--thanks to the generous assistance of France, to the heroism of leaders like Lafayette, Baron Steuben, and hosts of others, who gave us their fortunes and hazarded their lives for America, the war was ended by the surrender of Lord Cornwallis.  Victor Hugo said, \"Napoleon was not defeated at Waterloo by the allied forces.  It was God who conquered him.\"  Who that remembers Trenton, Valley Forge, Saratoga and Yorktown, will not say God fought for our Washington?  In 1777 a Quaker had occasion to pass through the woods near the headquarters of the army; hearing a voice, he approached the spot, and saw Washington in prayer.  Returning home, he said to his wife: \"All's well! All's well! Washington will prevail.  I have thought that no man can be a soldier and a Christian.  George Washington has convinced me of my mistake.\" Peace was declared in 1783.  I have a water-color of the building used as the Department of State, in which the treaty of peace was signed--it was a building 12 feet by 30.   In May,1787, delegates from all the States, except Rhode Island, met in the state house in Philadelphia, with George Washington as president, to draft a constitution for these United States.  All the delegates were convinced of the utter failure of the articles of confederation, all were convinced of the need of a stronger government.  Two parties honestly differed and were determined to fight it out to the bitter end. At one time it looked as if the convention must disband without effecting its object.  Franklin arose and said: \"Mr. President, the small progress we have made after five weeks is a melancholy proof of the imperfection of human understanding--we have gone back to ancient history for models of government--we have viewed modern states--we find none of their constitutions suitable to our circumstances--we are groping in the dark to find political truth, and are scarcely able to distinguish it when presented to us.  How has it happened, sir, that we have not once thought of humbly applying to the Father of Lights to illumine our understandings?  In the beginning of the contest with Britain, when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayers in this room for Divine protection.  Our prayers, sir, were heard and they were graciously answered.  All of us have observed frequent instances of a superintending Providence in our favor.  To that kind Providence we owe this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means to establish our nation.  Have we forgotten our powerful Friend?  Do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance?  I"]]]
