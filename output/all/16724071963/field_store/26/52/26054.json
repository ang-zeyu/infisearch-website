Y' are but a child, Tom Cuckow; ye have lost the fish.\"  But, for all that, Ellis pocketed the purse with nonchalance.  He stood leaning on his boar-spear, and looked round upon the rest.  They, in various attitudes, took greedily of the venison pottage, and liberally washed it down with ale.  This was a good day; they were in luck; but business pressed, and they were speedy in their eating.  The first-comers had by this time even despatched their dinner.  Some lay down upon the grass and fell instantly asleep, like boa-constrictors; others talked together, or overhauled their weapons: and one, whose humour was particularly gay, holding forth an ale-horn, began to sing:      \"Here is no law in good green shaw,        Here is no lack of meat;     'Tis merry and quiet, with deer for our diet,        In summer, when all is sweet.      Come winter again, with wind and rain--        Come winter, with snow and sleet,     Get home to your places, with hoods on your faces,        And sit by the fire and eat.\"  All this while the two lads had listened and lain close; only Richard had unslung his cross-bow, and held ready in one hand the windac, or grappling-iron that he used to bend it.  Otherwise they had not dared to stir; and this scene of forest life had gone on before their eyes like a scene upon a theatre.  But now there came a strange interruption.  The tall chimney which over-topped the remainder of the ruins rose right above their hiding-place.  There came a whistle in the air, and then a sounding smack, and the fragments of a broken arrow fell about their ears.  Some one from the upper quarters of the wood, perhaps the very sentinel they saw posted in the fir, had shot an arrow at the chimney-top.  Matcham could not restrain a little cry, which he instantly stifled, and even Dick started with surprise, and dropped the windac from his fingers. But to the fellows on the lawn, this shaft was an expected signal.  They were all afoot together, tightening their belts, testing their bow-strings, loosening sword and dagger in the sheath.  Ellis held up his hand; his face had suddenly assumed a look of savage energy; the white of his eyes shone in his sun-brown face.  \"Lads,\" he said, \"ye know your places.  Let not one man's soul escape you.  Appleyard was a whet before a meal; but now we go to table.  I have three men whom I will bitterly avenge--Harry Shelton, Simon Malmesbury, and\"--striking his broad bosom--\"and Ellis Duckworth, by the mass!\"  Another man came, red with hurry, through the thorns.  \"'Tis not Sir Daniel!\" he panted.  \"They are but seven.  Is the arrow gone?\"  \"It struck but now,\" replied Ellis.  \"A murrain!\" cried the messenger.  \"Methought I heard it whistle.  And I go dinnerless!\"  In the space of a minute, some running, some walking sharply, according as their stations were nearer or farther away, the men of the Black Arrow had all disappeared from the neighbourhood of the ruined house; and the caldron, and the fire, which was now burning low, and the dead deer's carcase on the hawthorn, remained alone to testify they had been there.    CHAPTER V--\"BLOODY AS THE HUNTER\"   The lads lay quiet till the last footstep had melted on the wind.  Then they arose, and with many an ache, for they were weary with constraint, clambered through the ruins, and recrossed the ditch upon the rafter. Matcham had picked up the windac and went first, Dick following stiffly, with his cross-bow on his arm.  \"And now,\" said Matcham, \"forth to Holywood.\"  \"To Holywood!\" cried Dick, \"when good fellows stand shot?  Not I!  I would see you hanged first, Jack!\"  \"Ye would leave me, would ye?\" Matcham asked.  \"Ay, by my sooth!\" returned Dick.  \"An I be not in time to warn these lads, I will go die with them.  What! would ye have me leave my own men that I have lived among.  I trow not!  Give me my windac.\"  But there was nothing further from Matcham's mind.  \"Dick,\" he said, \"ye sware before the saints that ye would see me safe to Holywood.  Would ye be forsworn?  Would you desert me--a perjurer?\"  \"Nay, I sware for the best,\" returned Dick.  \"I meant it too; but now! But look ye, Jack, turn again with me.  Let me but warn these men, and, if needs must, stand shot with them; then shall all be clear, and I will on again to Holywood and purge mine oath.\"  \"Ye but deride me,\" answered Matcham.  \"These men ye go to succour are the I same that hunt me to my ruin.\"  Dick scratched his head.  \"I cannot help it, Jack,\" he said.  \"Here is no remedy.  What would ye? Ye run no great peril, man; and these are in the way of death.  Death!\" he added.  \"Think of it!  What a murrain do ye keep me here for?  Give me the windac.  Saint George! shall they all die?\"  \"Richard Shelton,\" said Matcham, looking him squarely in the face, \"would ye, then, join party with Sir Daniel?  Have ye not ears?  Heard ye not this Ellis, what he said? or have ye no heart for your own kindly blood and the father that men slew?  'Harry Shelton,' he said; and Sir Harry Shelton was your father, as the sun shines in heaven.\"  \"What would ye?\" Dick cried again.  \"Would ye have me credit thieves?\"  \"Nay, I have heard it before now,\" returned Matcham.  \"The fame goeth currently, it was Sir Daniel slew him.  He slew him under oath; in his own house he shed the innocent blood.  Heaven wearies for the avenging on't; and you--the man's son--ye go about to comfort and defend the murderer!\"  \"Jack,\" cried the lad \"I know not.  It may be; what know I?  But, see here: This man hath bred me up and fostered me, and his men I have hunted with and played among; and to leave them in the hour of peril--O, man, if I did that, I were stark dead to honour!  Nay, Jack, ye would not ask it; ye would not wish me to be base.\"  \"But your father, Dick?\" said Matcham, somewhat wavering.  \"Your father? and your oath to me?  Ye took the saints to witness.\"  \"My father?\" cried Shelton.  \"Nay, he would have me go!  If Sir Daniel slew him, when the hour comes this hand shall slay Sir Daniel; but neither him nor his will I desert in peril.  And for mine oath, good Jack, ye shall absolve me of it here.  For the lives' sake of many men that hurt you not, and for mine honour, ye shall set me free.\"  \"I, Dick?  Never!\" returned Matcham.  \"An ye leave me, y' are forsworn, and so I shall declare it.\"  \"My blood heats,\" said Dick.  \"Give me the windac!  Give it me!\"  \"I'll not,\" said Matcham.  \"I'll save you in your teeth.\"  \"Not?\" cried Dick.  \"I'll make you!\"  \"Try it,\" said the other.  They stood, looking in each other's eyes, each ready for a spring.  Then Dick leaped; and though Matcham turned instantly and fled, in two bounds he was over-taken, the windac was twisted from his grasp, he was thrown roughly to the ground, and Dick stood across him, flushed and menacing, with doubled fist.  Matcham lay where he had fallen, with his face in the grass, not thinking of resistance.  Dick bent his bow.  \"I'll teach you!\" he cried, fiercely.  \"Oath or no oath, ye may go hang for me!\"  And he turned and began to run.  Matcham was on his feet at once, and began running after him.  \"What d'ye want?\" cried Dick, stopping.  \"What make ye after me?  Stand off!\"  \"Will follow an I please,\" said Matcham.  \"This wood is free to me.\"  \"Stand back, by 'r Lady!\" returned Dick, raising his bow.  \"Ah, y' are a brave boy!\" retorted Matcham.  \"Shoot!\"  Dick lowered his weapon in some confusion.  \"See here,\" he said.  \"Y' have done me ill enough.  Go, then.  Go your way in fair wise; or, whether I will or not, I must even drive you to it.\"  \"Well,\" said Matcham, doggedly, \"y' are the stronger.  Do your worst.  I shall not leave to follow thee, Dick, unless thou makest me,\" he added.  Dick was almost beside himself.  It went against his heart to beat a creature so defenceless; and, for the life of him, he knew no other way to rid himself of this unwelcome and, as he began to think, perhaps untrue companion.  \"Y' are mad, I think,\" he cried.  \"Fool-fellow, I am hasting to your foes; as fast as foot can carry me, go I thither.\"  \"I care not, Dick,\" replied the lad.  \"If y' are bound to die, Dick, I'll die too.  I would liever go with you to prison than to go free without you.\"  \"Well,\" returned the other, \"I may stand no longer prating.  Follow me, if ye must; but if ye play me false, it shall but little advance you, mark ye that.  Shalt have a quarrel in thine inwards, boy.\"  So saying, Dick took once more to his heels, keeping in the margin of the thicket and looking briskly about him as he went.  At a good pace he rattled out of the dell, and came again into the more open quarters of the wood.  To the left a little eminence appeared, spotted with golden gorse, and crowned with a black tuft of firs.  \"I shall see from there,\" he thought, and struck for it across a heathy clearing.  He had gone but a few yards, when Matcham touched him on the arm, and pointed.  To the eastward of the summit there was a dip, and, as it were, a valley passing to the other side; the heath was not yet out; all the ground was rusty, like an unscoured buckler, and dotted sparingly with yews; and there, one following another, Dick saw half a score green jerkins mounting the ascent, and marching at their head, conspicuous by his boar-spear, Ellis Duckworth in person.  One after another gained the top, showed for a moment against the sky, and then dipped upon the further side, until the last was gone.  Dick looked at Matcham with a kindlier eye.  \"So y' are to be true to me, Jack?\" he asked.  \"I thought ye were of the other party.\"  Matcham began to sob.  \"What cheer!\" cried Dick.  \"Now the saints behold us! would ye snivel for a word?\"  \"Ye hurt me,\" sobbed Matcham.  \"Ye hurt me when ye threw me down.  Y' are a coward to abuse your strength.\"  \"Nay, that is fool's talk,\" said Dick, roughly.  \"Y' had no title to my windac, Master John.

As for the fragments of ostensible erudition which are scattered about my pages, hardly anything in them is not pure invention; there never was, naturally, any such book as that which I quote in “The Treasure of Abbot Thomas”. “Canon Alberic’s Scrap-book” was written in 1894 and printed soon after in the _National Review_, “Lost Hearts” appeared in the _Pall Mall Magazine_; of the next five stories, most of which were read to friends at Christmas-time at King’s College, Cambridge, I only recollect that I wrote “Number 13” in 1899, while “The Treasure of Abbot Thomas” was composed in the summer of 1904.  M. R. JAMES     CANON ALBERIC’S SCRAP-BOOK   St Bertrand de Comminges is a decayed town on the spurs of the Pyrenees, not very far from Toulouse, and still nearer to Bagnères-de-Luchon. It was the site of a bishopric until the Revolution, and has a cathedral which is visited by a certain number of tourists. In the spring of 1883 an Englishman arrived at this old-world place—I can hardly dignify it with the name of city, for there are not a thousand inhabitants. He was a Cambridge man, who had come specially from Toulouse to see St Bertrand’s Church, and had left two friends, who were less keen archaeologists than himself, in their hotel at Toulouse, under promise to join him on the following morning. Half an hour at the church would satisfy _them_, and all three could then pursue their journey in the direction of Auch. But our Englishman had come early on the day in question, and proposed to himself to fill a note-book and to use several dozens of plates in the process of describing and photographing every corner of the wonderful church that dominates the little hill of Comminges. In order to carry out this design satisfactorily, it was necessary to monopolize the verger of the church for the day. The verger or sacristan (I prefer the latter appellation, inaccurate as it may be) was accordingly sent for by the somewhat brusque lady who keeps the inn of the Chapeau Rouge; and when he came, the Englishman found him an unexpectedly interesting object of study. It was not in the personal appearance of the little, dry, wizened old man that the interest lay, for he was precisely like dozens of other church-guardians in France, but in a curious furtive, or rather hunted and oppressed, air which he had. He was perpetually half glancing behind him; the muscles of his back and shoulders seemed to be hunched in a continual nervous contraction, as if he were expecting every moment to find himself in the clutch of an enemy. The Englishman hardly knew whether to put him down as a man haunted by a fixed delusion, or as one oppressed by a guilty conscience, or as an unbearably henpecked husband. The probabilities, when reckoned up, certainly pointed to the last idea; but, still, the impression conveyed was that of a more formidable persecutor even than a termagant wife.  However, the Englishman (let us call him Dennistoun) was soon too deep in his note-book and too busy with his camera to give more than an occasional glance to the sacristan. Whenever he did look at him, he found him at no great distance, either huddling himself back against the wall or crouching in one of the gorgeous stalls. Dennistoun became rather fidgety after a time. Mingled suspicions that he was keeping the old man from his _déjeuner_, that he was regarded as likely to make away with St Bertrand’s ivory crozier, or with the dusty stuffed crocodile that hangs over the font, began to torment him.  “Won’t you go home?” he said at last; “I’m quite well able to finish my notes alone; you can lock me in if you like. I shall want at least two hours more here, and it must be cold for you, isn’t it?”  “Good heavens!” said the little man, whom the suggestion seemed to throw into a state of unaccountable terror, “such a thing cannot be thought of for a moment. Leave monsieur alone in the church? No, no; two hours, three hours, all will be the same to me. I have breakfasted, I am not at all cold, with many thanks to monsieur.”  “Very well, my little man,” quoth Dennistoun to himself: “you have been warned, and you must take the consequences.”  Before the expiration of the two hours, the stalls, the enormous dilapidated organ, the choir-screen of Bishop John de Mauléon, the remnants of glass and tapestry, and the objects in the treasure-chamber, had been well and truly examined; the sacristan still keeping at Dennistoun’s heels, and every now and then whipping round as if he had been stung, when one or other of the strange noises that trouble a large empty building fell on his ear. Curious noises they were sometimes.  “Once,” Dennistoun said to me, “I could have sworn I heard a thin metallic voice laughing high up in the tower. I darted an inquiring glance at my sacristan. He was white to the lips. ‘It is he—that is—it is no one; the door is locked,’ was all he said, and we looked at each other for a full minute.”  Another little incident puzzled Dennistoun a good deal. He was examining a large dark picture that hangs behind the altar, one of a series illustrating the miracles of St Bertrand. The composition of the picture is well-nigh indecipherable, but there is a Latin legend below, which runs thus:  _Qualiter S. Bertrandus liberavit hominem quem diabolus diu volebat strangulare_. (How St Bertrand delivered a man whom the Devil long sought to strangle.)  Dennistoun was turning to the sacristan with a smile and a jocular remark of some sort on his lips, but he was confounded to see the old man on his knees, gazing at the picture with the eye of a suppliant in agony, his hands tightly clasped, and a rain of tears on his cheeks. Dennistoun naturally pretended to have noticed nothing, but the question would not go away from him, “Why should a daub of this kind affect anyone so strongly?” He seemed to himself to be getting some sort of clue to the reason of the strange look that had been puzzling him all the day: the man must be a monomaniac; but what was his monomania?  It was nearly five o’clock; the short day was drawing in, and the church began to fill with shadows, while the curious noises—the muffled footfalls and distant talking voices that had been perceptible all day—seemed, no doubt because of the fading light and the consequently quickened sense of hearing, to become more frequent and insistent.  The sacristan began for the first time to show signs of hurry and impatience. He heaved a sigh of relief when camera and note-book were finally packed up and stowed away, and hurriedly beckoned Dennistoun to the western door of the church, under the tower. It was time to ring the Angelus. A few pulls at the reluctant rope, and the great bell Bertrande, high in the tower, began to speak, and swung her voice up among the pines and down to the valleys, loud with mountain-streams, calling the dwellers on those lonely hills to remember and repeat the salutation of the angel to her whom he called Blessed among women. With that a profound quiet seemed to fall for the first time that day upon the little town, and Dennistoun and the sacristan went out of the church.  On the doorstep they fell into conversation.  “Monsieur seemed to interest himself in the old choir-books in the sacristy.”  “Undoubtedly. I was going to ask you if there were a library in the town.”  “No, monsieur; perhaps there used to be one belonging to the Chapter, but it is now such a small place—” Here came a strange pause of irresolution, as it seemed; then, with a sort of plunge, he went on: “But if monsieur is _amateur des vieux livres_, I have at home something that might interest him. It is not a hundred yards.”  At once all Dennistoun’s cherished dreams of finding priceless manuscripts in untrodden corners of France flashed up, to die down again the next moment. It was probably a stupid missal of Plantin’s printing, about 1580. Where was the likelihood that a place so near Toulouse would not have been ransacked long ago by collectors? However, it would be foolish not to go; he would reproach himself for ever after if he refused. So they set off. On the way the curious irresolution and sudden determination of the sacristan recurred to Dennistoun, and he wondered in a shamefaced way whether he was being decoyed into some purlieu to be made away with as a supposed rich Englishman. He contrived, therefore, to begin talking with his guide, and to drag in, in a rather clumsy fashion, the fact that he expected two friends to join him early the next morning. To his surprise, the announcement seemed to relieve the sacristan at once of some of the anxiety that oppressed him.  “That is well,” he said quite brightly—“that is very well. Monsieur will travel in company with his friends; they will be always near him. It is a good thing to travel thus in company—sometimes.”  The last word appeared to be added as an afterthought and to bring with it a relapse into gloom for the poor little man.  They were soon at the house, which was one rather larger than its neighbours, stone-built, with a shield carved over the door, the shield of Alberic de Mauléon, a collateral descendant, Dennistoun tells me, of Bishop John de Mauléon. This Alberic was a Canon of Comminges from 1680 to 1701. The upper windows of the mansion were boarded up, and the whole place bore, as does the rest of Comminges, the aspect of decaying age.  Arrived on his doorstep, the sacristan paused a moment.  “Perhaps,” he said, “pe"]]]
