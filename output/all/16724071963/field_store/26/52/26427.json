The reactions given by these subjects have been classified according to frequency of occurrence into seven groups: (a) individual reactions (value 0); (b) doubtful reactions (value ±); (c) reactions given by one other person (value 0.1 per cent); (d) those given by from two to five others (value 0.2--0.5 per cent); (e) those given by from six to fifteen others (value 0.6-1.5 per cent); (f) those given by from sixteen to one hundred others (value 1.6--10.0 per cent); and (g) those given by more than one hundred others (value over 10.0 per cent). The averages obtained from these groups of subjects are shown in Table 1, and the figures for men and women are given separately.

In view, however, of the wide limits of variation, among the thousand subjects, these deviations from the general average are no larger than might quite possibly occur by chance, and the number of cases in each group is so small that the conclusion that education tends to increase the number of individual reactions would hardly be justified.  It will be observed also that this comparative study does not show any considerable differences corresponding to age or sex.  With regard to the type of reaction, it is possible to select groups of records which present more or less consistently one of the following special tendencies: (1) the tendency to react by contrasts; (2) the tendency to react by synonyms or other defining terms; and (3) the tendency to react by qualifying or specifying terms. How clearly the selected groups show these tendencies is indicated by Table II. The majority of records, however, present no such tendency in a consistent way; nor is there any evidence to show that these tendencies, when they occur, are to be regarded as manifestations of permanent mental characteristics, since they might quite possibly be due to a more or less accidental and transient associational direction. No further study has as yet been made of these tendencies, for the reason that they do not appear to possess any pathological significance.   TABLE II.

PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS.   This method is so simple that it requires but little training on the part of the experimenter, and but little co-operation on the part of the subject. It is not to be assumed that every reaction obtained by it is a true and immediate association to the corresponding stimulus word; but we have found it sufficient for the purpose of the test if the subject can be induced to give, in response to each stimulus word, any one word other than the stimulus word itself. No attempt is made to determine the exact degree of co-operation in any case.  In the early stages of this investigation the reaction time was regularly recorded. The results showed remarkable variations, among both normal and insane subjects. In a series of twenty-five tests, made more recently upon normal subjects, ninety reactions occupied more than ten seconds, and fifty-four of the stimulus words elicited a ten-second response from at least one subject.[1]  [Footnote 1: These tests were made by Dr. F. Lyman Wells, of the McLean Hospital, Waverley, Mass., and he has kindly furnished these data.]  It is noteworthy that these extremely long intervals occur in connection with reactions of widely differing values. That they are by no means limited to individual reactions is shown in Table III. by a group of selected reactions, all given by normal subjects.   TABLE III.

It has been the purpose of this study to establish as far as possible strictly objective criteria for distinguishing normal from abnormal associations, and for this reason we have made no attempt to determine by means of introspection the causes of variations of reaction time.  It would seem that the importance and magnitude of the problem of association time are such as to demand not merely a crude measurement of the gross reaction time in a large number of cases, but rather a special investigation by such exact methods as have been used by Cattell [1] and others in the analysis of the complex reaction. It would be impracticable for us to employ such methods in a study so extensive as this.  [Footnote 1: Mind, Vol. XI, 1886.]  In view of these considerations we discontinued the recording of the reaction time.  If the association test is to be useful in the study of pathological conditions, it is of great importance to have a reliable measure of the associational value of a pair of ideas. Many attempts have been made to modify and amplify the classical grouping of associations according to similarity, contrast, contiguity, and sequence, so as to make it serviceable in differentiating between normal and abnormal associations.  In this study we attempted to apply Aschaffenburg's [1] classification of reactions, but without success. Our failure to utilize this system of classification is assigned to the following considerations: (1) Distinctions between associations according to logical relations are extremely difficult to define; in many cases there is room for difference of opinion as to the proper place for an association, and thus the application of a logical scheme depends largely upon the personal equation of the observer; that even experienced observers cannot, in all cases, agree in placing an association is shown by Aschaffenburg's criticisms of the opinions of other observers on this point.[2] (2) Logical distinctions do not bring out clearly the differences between the reactions of normal subjects and those of insane subjects; logically, the reaction _bath--ink_, which was given by a patient, might be placed in the class with the reaction _bath--water_, although there is an obvious difference between the two reactions. (3) Many of the reactions given by insane subjects possess no obvious logical value whatever; but since any combination of ideas may represent a relationship, either real or imagined, it would be arbitrary to characterize such a reaction as incoherent.  [Footnote 1: Experimentelle Studien uber Association. Psychologische Arbeiten, Vol. I, p. 209; Vol. II, p. 1; Vol. IV, p. 235.]  [Footnote 2: Loc. cit, Vol. 1, pp. 226-227.]  The criterion of values which is used in this study is an empirical one. As has already been explained (p. 8), every word contained in the frequency tables possesses a value of at least 0.1 per cent, and other words have a zero value. With the aid of our method the difficulty of classifying the reactions quoted above is obviated, as it is necessary only to refer to the table to find their proper values: the value of the reaction _bath--water_ is 33.9 per cent, while that of the reaction _bath--ink_ is 0.  Logically the combination _health--wealth_ may be placed in any one of four classes, as follows:                     / intrinsic / causal dependence   health--wealth /            \\ coordination                  \\                   \\ extrinsic / speech reminiscence                               \\ sound similarity   But since our table shows this association to have an empirical value of 7.6 per cent, it becomes immaterial which of its logical relations is to be considered the strongest. It is mainly important, from our point of view, to separate reactions possessing an empirical value from those whose value is zero.    § 6. AN EMPIRICAL PRINCIPLE OF NORMAL ASSOCIATION.   On a general survey of the whole mass of material which forms the basis of the first part of this study, we are led to observe that _the one tendency which appears to be almost universal among normal persons is the tendency to give in response to any stimulus word one or another of a small group of common reactions_.  It appears from the pathological material now on hand that this tendency is greatly weakened in some cases of mental disease. Many patients have given more than 50 per cent of individual reactions.  It should be mentioned that occasionally a presumably normal subject has given a record very similar to those obtained from patients, in respect to both the number and the nature of the individual reactions. A few subjects who gave peculiar reactions were known to possess significant eccentricities, and for this reason we excluded their records from the thousand records which furnished the basis for the frequency tables; we excluded also a few peculiar records obtained from subjects of whom nothing was known, on the ground that such records would serve only to make the tables more cumbersome, without adding anything to their practical value. The total number of records thus excluded was seventeen.  It will be apparent to anyone who examines the frequency tables that the reactions obtained from one thousand persons fall short of exhausting the normal associational possibilities of these stimulus words. The tables, however, have been found to be sufficiently inclusive for the practical purpose which they were intended to serve. Common reactions, whether given by a sane or an insane subject, may, in the vast majority of instances, safely be regarded as normal. As to individual reactions, they cannot all be regarded as abnormal, but they include nearly all those reactions which are worthy of special analysis in view of their possible pathological significance. What can be said further of individual reactions, whether normal or abnormal, will appear in the second part of this contribution.     PART II.  ASSOCIATION IN INSANE SUBJECTS.    § 1. GENERAL SURVEY OF PATHOLOGICAL MATERIAL.   The pathological material which forms the basis of the present part of our study consists mainly of two hundred and forty-seven test records obtained for the most part from patients at the Kings Park State Hospital.  The different groups from which the cases were selected, together with the number from each group, are shown in Table I.   TABLE I.  Dementia præcox                     108 cases. Paranoic conditions                  33   \" Epilepsy                             24   \" General Paresis                      32   \" Manic-depressive insanity            32   \" Involuntary melancholia               8   \" Alcoholic psychoses                   6   \" Senile dementia                       4   \"   A comparison of our pathological with our normal material _en masse_ reveals in the former evidence of a weakening of the normal tendency to respond by common reactions. This is shown in Table II.   TABLE II.                          Common     Doubtful     Individual                        reactions.  reactions.   reactions. 1,000 normal subject     91.7%        1.5%         6.8%  247 insane subjects      70.7%        2.5%        26.8%   It seems evident from this that pathological significance attaches mainly to individual reactions, so that our study resolves itself largely into (1) an analysis and classification of individual reactions and (2) an attempt to determine what relationship, if any, exists between the different types of reactions and the different clinical forms of mental disease.    § 2. CLASSIFICATION OF REACTIONS.   Those who have attempted to use the association test in the study of insanity have felt the need of a practical classification of reactions, and have at the same time encountered the difficulty of establishing definite criteria for distinguishing the different groups from one another. It is a comparatively simple matter to make these distinctions in a general way and even to formulate a more or less comprehensive theoretical classification, but there still remains much difficulty in practice. We have made repeated attempts to utilize various systems of classification which involve free play of personal equation in their application. Although for us the matter is greatly simplified by the elimination of all the common reactions with the aid of the frequency tables, we have nevertheless met with no success. The distinctions made by either of us have on no occasion fully satisfied, at the second reading, either the one who made them or the other, while a comparison of the distinctions made by each of us independently has shown a disagreement to the extent of 20-35 per cent.  We sought, therefore, to formulate a classification in which the various groups should be so defined as to obviate the interference of personal equation in the work of applying it, hoping thus to achieve greater accuracy. In this we can lay claim to only partial success; for, in the first place, having satisfactorily defined a number of groups, we found it necessary in the end to provide a special group for unclassified reactions, into which falls more than one-third of the total number of individual reactions; and, in the second place, in at least two of our groups the play of personal equation has not been entirely eliminated, so that there is still a possibility of error to the extent of five per cent of individual reactions, which means approximately one per cent of the total number of reactions. We have found, however, that in spite of these shortcomings the classification here proposed is more serviceable than others which, though more comprehensive, are at the same time lacking in definiteness.  Our classification consists of the"]]]
