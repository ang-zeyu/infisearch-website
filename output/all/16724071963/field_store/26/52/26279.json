It sickens me yet, that slaughter!   I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.   I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.    Meanwhile the British manoeuvr'd to draw us out for a pitch'd battle,   But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch'd battle.    We fought the fight in detachments.   Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was             against us,   Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push'd us back to             the works on this hill,   Till we turn'd menacing here, and then he left us.    That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two             thousand strong,   Few return'd, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.   That and here my General's first battle,   No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude with             applause,   Nobody clapp'd hands here then.    But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,   Wearied that night we lay foil'd and sullen,   While scornfully laugh'd many an arrogant lord oft' against us             encamp'd,   Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over             their victory.    So dull and damp and another day,   But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,   Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my             General retreated.    I saw him at the river-side,   Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;   My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass'd over,   And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the             last time.    Every one else seem'd fill'd with gloom,   Many no doubt thought of capitulation.    But when my General pass'd me,   As he stood in his boat and look'd toward the coming sun,   I saw something different from capitulation.    _Terminus._    Enough, the Centenarian's story ends,   The two, the past and present, have interchanged,   I myself as connecter, as chansonnier of a great future, am now             speaking.    And is this the ground Washington trod?   And these waters I listlessly daily cross, are these the waters he             cross'd,   As resolute in defeat as other generals in their proudest triumphs?    I must copy the story, and send it eastward and westward,   I must preserve that look as it beam'd on you rivers of Brooklyn.    See--as the annual round returns the phantoms return,   It is the 27th of August and the British have landed,   The battle begins and goes against us, behold through the smoke             Washington's face,   The brigade of Virginia and Maryland have march'd forth to intercept             the enemy,   They are cut off, murderous artillery from the hills plays upon them,   Rank after rank falls, while over them silently droops the flag,   Baptized that day in many a young man's bloody wounds,   In death, defeat, and sisters', mothers' tears.    Ah, hills and slopes of Brooklyn! I perceive you are more valuable             than your owners supposed;   In the midst of you stands an encampment very old,   Stands forever the camp of that dead brigade.     CAVALRY CROSSING A FORD.     A line in long array where they wind betwixt green islands,   They take a serpentine course, their arms flash in the sun--hark to             the musical clank,   Behold the silvery river, in it the splashing horses loitering stop             to drink,   Behold the brown-faced men, each group, each person a picture, the             negligent rest on the saddles,   Some emerge on the opposite bank, others are just entering the             ford--while   Scarlet and blue and snowy white,   The guidon flags flutter gayly in the wind.     BIVOUAC ON A MOUNTAIN SIDE.     I see before me now a traveling army halting,   Below a fertile valley spread, with barns and the orchards of summer,   Behind, the terraced sides of a mountain, abrupt, in places rising             high,   Broken, with rocks, with clinging cedars, with tall shapes dingily             seen,   The numerous camp-fires scatter'd near and far, some away up on the             mountain,   The shadowy forms of men and horses, looming, large-sized,             flickering,   And over all the sky--the sky! far, far out of reach, studded,             breaking out, the eternal stars.     AN ARMY CORPS ON THE MARCH.     With its cloud of skirmishers in advance,   With now the sound of a single shot snapping like a whip, and now an             irregular volley,   The swarming ranks press on and on, the dense brigades press on,   Glittering dimly, toiling under the sun--the dust-cover'd men,   In columns rise and fall to the undulations of the ground,   With artillery interspers'd--the wheels rumble, the horses sweat,   As the army corps advances.     BY THE BIVOUAC'S FITFUL FLAME.     By the bivouac's fitful flame,   A procession winding around me, solemn and sweet and slow--but first             I note,   The tents of the sleeping army, the fields' and woods' dim out-line,   The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence,   Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving,   The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes they seem to be stealthily             watching me,)   While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts,   Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that             are far away;   A solemn and slow procession there as I sit on the ground,   By the bivouac's fitful flame.     COME UP FROM THE FIELDS FATHER.     Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,   And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son.    Lo, 'tis autumn,   Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,   Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the             moderate wind,   Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd             vines,   (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?   Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)   Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and             with wondrous clouds,   Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers             well.    Down in the fields all prospers well,   But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call,   And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.    Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,   She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.    Open the envelope quickly,   O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,   O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!   All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main             words only,   Sentences broken, _gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,             taken to hospital,   At present low, but will soon be better._    Ah now the single figure to me,   Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,   Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,   By the jamb of a door leans.    _Grieve not so, dear mother_, (the just-grown daughter speaks through             her sobs,   The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)   _See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better._    Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be             better, that brave and simple soul,)   While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,   The only son is dead.    But the mother needs to be better,   She with thin form presently drest in black,   By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often             waking,   In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,   O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and             withdraw,   To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.     VIGIL STRANGE I KEPT ON THE FIELD ONE NIGHT.     Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;   When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,   One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I shall             never forget,   One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the             ground,   Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,   Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my             way,   Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of             responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)   Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the             moderate night-wind,   Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the             battle-field spreading,   Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,   But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,   Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my             chin in my hands,   Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest             comrade--not a tear, not a word,   Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my             soldier,   As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,   Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your             death,   I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall             surely meet again,)   Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn             appear'd,   My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,   Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully             under feet,   And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave,             in his rude-dug grave I deposited,   Ending my vigil"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8801"],["title","Drum-Taps (#6)"],["body","with that, vigil of night and battle-field             dim,   Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth             responding,)   Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day             brighten'd,   I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his             blanket,   And buried him where he fell.     A MARCH IN THE RANKS HARD-PREST, AND THE ROAD UNKNOWN.     A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,   A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,   Our army foil'd with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,   Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted             building,   We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted             building,   'Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu             hospital,   Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and             poems ever made,   Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and             lamps,   And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and             clouds of smoke,   By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in             the pews laid down,   At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of             bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)   I staunch the blood temporarily, (the youngster's face is white as a             lily,)   Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o'er the scene fain to absorb it             all,   Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity,             some of them dead,   Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether,             the odor of blood,   The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also             fill'd,   Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the             death-spasm sweating,   An occasional scream or cry, the doctor's shouted orders or calls,   The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the             torches,   These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,   Then hear outside the orders given, _Fall in, my men, fall in_;   But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives             he me,   Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,   Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,   The unknown road still marching.     A SIGHT IN CAMP IN THE DAYBREAK GRAY AND DIM.     A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,   As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,   As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital             tent,   Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended             lying,   Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woollen blanket,   Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.    Curious I halt and silent stand,   Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first just             lift the blanket;   Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair, and             flesh all sunken about the eyes?   Who are you my dear comrade?    Then to the second I step-and who are you my child and darling?   Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?    Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of             beautiful yellow-white ivory;   Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the             Christ himself,   Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.     AS TOILSOME I WANDER'D VIRGINIA'S WOODS.     As toilsome I wander'd Virginia's woods,   To the music of rustling leaves kick'd by my feet, (for 'twas autumn,)   I mark'd at the foot of a tree the grave of a soldier;   Mortally wounded he and buried on the retreat, (easily all could I             understand,)   The halt of a mid-day hour, when up! no time to lose-yet this sign             left,   On a tablet scrawl'd and nail'd on the tree by the grave,   _Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade._    Long, long I muse, then on my way go wandering,   Many a changeful season to follow, and many a scene of life,   Yet at times through changeful season and scene, abrupt, alone, or in             the crowded street,   Comes before me the unknown soldier's grave, comes the inscription             rude in Virginia's woods,   _Bold, cautious, true, and my loving comrade._     NOT THE PILOT.     Not the pilot has charged himself to bring his ship into port,   though beaten back and many times baffled;   Not the pathfinder penetrating inland weary and long,   By deserts parch'd, snows chill'd, rivers wet, perseveres till he             reaches his destination,   More than I have charged myself, heeded or unheeded, to compose a             march for these States,   For a battle-call, rousing to arms if need be, years, centuries             hence.     YEAR THAT TREMBLED AND REEL'D BENEATH ME.     Year that trembled and reel'd beneath me!   Your summer wind was warm enough, yet the air I breathed froze me,   A thick gloom fell through the sunshine and darken'd me,   Must I change my triumphant songs? said I to myself,   Must I indeed learn to chant the cold dirges of the baffled?   And sullen hymns of defeat?     THE WOUND-DRESSER.   1    An old man bending I come among new faces,   Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,   Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,   (Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge             relentless war,   But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,   To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)   Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these             chances,   Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally             brave;)   Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,   Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?   What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,   Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?  2    O maidens and young men I love and that love me,   What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking             recalls,   Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and             dust,   In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the             rush of successful charge,   Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they             fade,   Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or             soldiers' joys,   (Both I remember well-many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was             content.)    But in silence, in dreams' projections,   While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,   So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the             sand,   With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up             there,   Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)    Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,   Straight and swift to my wounded I go,   Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,   Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,   Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,   To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,   To each and all one after another I drawn near, not one do I miss,   An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,   Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd             again.    I onward go, I stop,   With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,   I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,   One turns to me his appealing eyes-poor boy! I never knew you,   Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that             would save you.  3    On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)   The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage             away,)   The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through I             examine,   Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life             struggles hard,   (Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!   In mercy come quickly.)    From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,   I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and             blood,   Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and             side-falling head,   His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the             bloody stump,   And has not yet look'd on it.    I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,   But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,   And the yellow-blue countenance see.    I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,   Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening, so             offensive,   While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.    I am faithful, I do not give out,   The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,   These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast a             fire, a burning flame.)  4    Thus in silence in dreams' projections,   Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,   The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,   I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,   Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,   (Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and             rested,   Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)     LONG, TOO LONG AMERICA.     Long, too long America,   Traveling roads all even and peaceful you learn'd from joys and             prosperity only,   But now, ah now, to learn from crises"]]]
