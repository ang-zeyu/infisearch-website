She made a slight pause, fixing her eye upon him with an expression of no earthly sweetness, so that the child shivered and stood awe-struck, rather than affrighted, while the Old Maid passed on.  Perhaps her garment might have been polluted even by an infant’s touch; perhaps her kiss would have been death to the sweet boy, within a year.  “She is but a shadow,” whispered the superstitious.   “The child put forth his arms and could not grasp her robe!”  The wonder was increased, when the Old Maid passed beneath the porch of the deserted mansion, ascended the moss-covered steps, lifted the iron knocker, and gave three raps.  The people could only conjecture, that some old remembrance, troubling her bewildered brain, had impelled the poor woman hither to visit the friends of her youth; all gone from their home, long since and forever, unless their ghosts still haunted it,--fit company for the  “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  An elderly man approached the steps, and reverently uncovering his gray locks, essayed to explain the matter.  “None, Madam,” said he, “have dwelt in this house these fifteen years agone,--no, not since the death of old Colonel Fenwicke, whose funeral you may remember to have followed.  His heirs being ill-agreed among themselves, have let the mansion-house go to ruin.”  The Old Maid looked slowly round, with a slight gesture of one hand, and a finger of the other upon her lip, appearing more shadow-like than ever, in the obscurity of the porch.  But again she lifted the hammer, and gave, this time, a single rap.  Could it be that a footstep was now heard, coming down the staircase of the old mansion, which all conceived to have been so long untenanted?  Slowly, feebly, yet heavily, like the pace of an aged and infirm person, the step approached, more distinct on every downward stair, till it reached the portal.  The bar fell on the inside; the door was opened.  One upward glance, towards the church-spire, whence the sunshine had just faded, was the last that the people saw of the “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  “Who undid the door?” asked many.  This question, owing to the depth of shadow beneath the porch, no one could satisfactorily answer.  Two or three aged men, while protesting against an inference, which might be drawn, affirmed that the person within was a negro, and bore a singular resemblance to old Caesar, formerly a slave in the house, but freed by death some thirty years before.  “Her summons has waked up a servant of the old family,” said one, half seriously.  “Let us wait here,” replied another.   “More guests will knock at the door, anon.  But the gate of the graveyard should be thrown open!”  Twilight had overspread the town, before the crowd began to separate, or the comments on this incident were exhausted.  One after another was wending his way homeward, when a coach--no common spectacle in those days--drove slowly into the street.  It was an old-fashioned equipage, hanging close to the ground, with arms on the panels, a footman behind, and a grave, corpulent coachman seated high in front,--the whole giving an idea of solemn state and dignity.  There was something awful, in the heavy rumbling of the wheels.  The coach rolled down the street, till, coming to the gateway of the deserted mansion, it drew up, and the footman sprang to the ground.  “Whose grand coach is this?” asked a very inquisitive body.  The footman made no reply, but ascended the steps of the old house, gave three raps with the iron hammer, and returned to open the coach-door.  An old man possessed of the heraldic lore so common in that day examined the shield of arms on the panel.  “Azure, a lion’s head erased, between three flower-deluces,” said he; then whispered the name of the family to whom these bearings belonged. The last inheritor of its honors was recently dead, after a long residence amid the splendor of the British court, where his birth and wealth had given him no mean station.  “He left no child,” continued the herald, “and these arms, being in a lozenge, betoken that the coach appertains to his widow.”  Further disclosures, perhaps, might have been made, had not the speaker suddenly been struck dumb, by the stern eye of an ancient lady, who thrust forth her head from the coach, preparing to descend. As she emerged, the people saw that her dress was magnificent, and her figure dignified, in spite of age and infirmity,--a stately ruin, but with a look, at once, of pride and wretchedness.  Her strong and rigid features had an awe about them, unlike that of the white Old Maid, but as of something evil.  She passed up the steps, leaning on a gold-headed cane; the door swung open, as she ascended,--and the light of a torch glittered on the embroidery of her dress, and gleamed on the pillars of the porch.  After a momentary pause--a glance backwards--and then a desperate effort--she went in.  The decipherer of the coat of arms had ventured up the lowest step, and shrinking back immediately, pale and tremulous, affirmed that the torch was held by the very image of old Caesar.  “But, such a hideous grin,” added he, “was never seen on the face of mortal man, black or white!  It will haunt me till my dying day.”  Meantime, the coach had wheeled round, with a prodigious clatter on the pavement, and rumbled up the street, disappearing in the twilight, while the ear still tracked its course.  Scarcely was it gone, when the people began to question whether the coach and attendants, the ancient lady, the spectre of old Caesar, and the Old Maid herself, were not all a strangely combined delusion, with some dark purport in its mystery.  The whole town was astir, so that, instead of dispersing, the crowd continually increased, and stood gazing up at the windows of the mansion, now silvered by the brightening moon.  The elders, glad to indulge the narrative propensity of age, told of the long-faded splendor of the family, the entertainments they had given, and the guests, the greatest of the land, and even titled and noble ones from abroad, who had passed beneath that portal.  These graphic reminiscences seemed to call up the ghosts of those to whom they referred.  So strong was the impression, on some of the more imaginative hearers, that two or three were seized with trembling fits, at one and the same moment, protesting that they had distinctly heard three other raps of the iron knocker.  “Impossible!” exclaimed others.   “See!  The moon shines beneath the porch, and shows every part of it, except in the narrow shade of that pillar.  There is no one there!”  “Did not the door open?”  whispered one of these fanciful persons.  “Didst thou see it, too?” said his companion, in a startled tone.  But the general sentiment was opposed to the idea, that a third visitant had made application at the door of the deserted house. A few, however, adhered to this new marvel, and even declared that a red gleam, like that of a torch, had shone through the great front window, as if the negro were lighting a guest up the staircase.  This, too, was pronounced a mere fantasy.  But, at once, the whole multitude started, and each man beheld his own terror painted in the faces of all the rest.  “What an awful thing is this!” cried they.  A shriek, too fearfully distinct for doubt, had been heard within the mansion, breaking forth suddenly, and succeeded by a deep stillness, as if a heart had burst in giving it utterance.  The people knew not whether to fly from the very sight of the house, or to rush trembling in, and search out the strange mystery. Amid their confusion and affright, they were somewhat reassured by the appearance of their clergyman, a venerable patriarch, and equally a saint, who had taught them and their fathers the way to heaven, for more than the space of an ordinary lifetime.  He was a reverend figure, with long, white hair upon his shoulders, a white beard upon his breast, and a back so bent over his staff, that he seemed to be looking downward, continually, as if to choose a proper grave for his weary frame.  It was some time before the good old man, being deaf, and of impaired intellect, could be made to comprehend such portions of the affair as were comprehensible at all.  But, when possessed of the facts, his energies assumed unexpected vigor.  “Verily,” said the old gentleman, “it will be fitting that I enter the mansion-house of the worthy Colonel Fenwicke, lest any harm should have befallen that true Christian woman, whom ye call the ‘Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.’”  Behold, then, the venerable clergyman ascending the steps of the mansion, with a torch-bearer behind him.  It was the elderly man, who had spoken to the Old Maid, and the same who had afterwards explained the shield of arms, and recognized the features of the negro.  Like their predecessors, they gave three raps, with the iron hammer.  “Old Caesar cometh not,” observed the priest.  “Well, I wot, he no longer doth service in this mansion.”  “Assuredly, then, it was something worse, in old Caesar’s likeness!”  said the other adventurer.  “Be it as God wills,” answered the clergyman.  “See! my strength, though it be much decayed, hath sufficed to open this heavy door. Let us enter, and pass up the staircase.”  Here occurred a singular exemplification of the dreamy state of a very old man’s mind.  As they ascended the wide flight of stairs, the aged clergyman appeared to move with caution, occasionally standing aside, and oftener bending his head, as it were in salutation, thus practising all the gestures of one who makes his way through a throng. Reaching the head of the staircase, he looked around, with sad and solemn benignity, laid aside his staff, bared his hoary locks, and was evidently on the point of commencing a prayer.  “Reverend Sir,” said his attendant, who conceived this a very suitable"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9214"],["title","The White Old Maid (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#2)"],["body","to their further search, “would it not be well, that the people join with us in prayer?”  “Well-a-day!” cried the old clergyman, staring strangely around him. “Art thou here with me, and none other?  Verily, past times were present to me, and I deemed that I was to make a funeral prayer, as many a time heretofore, from the head of this staircase.  “Of a truth, I saw the shades of many that are gone.  Yea, I have prayed at their burials, one after another, and the ‘Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet’ hath seen them to their graves!”  Being now more thoroughly awake to their present purpose, he took his staff, and struck forcibly on the floor, till there came an echo from each deserted chamber, but no menial, to answer their summons.  They therefore walked along the passage, and again paused, opposite to the great front window, through which was seen the crowd, in the shadow and partial moonlight of the street beneath.  On their right hand was the open door of a chamber, and a closed one on their left.  The clergyman pointed his cane to the carved oak panel of the latter.  “Within that chamber,” observed he, “a whole lifetime since, did I sit by the death-bed of a goodly young man, who, being now at the last gasp--”  Apparently, there was some powerful excitement in the ideas which had now flashed across his mind.  He snatched the torch from his companion’s hand, and threw open the door with such sudden violence, that the flame was extinguished, leaving them no other light than the moonbeams, which fell through two windows into the spacious chamber. It was sufficient to discover all that could be known.  In a high-backed oaken arm-chair, upright, with her hands clasped across her breast, and her head thrown back, sat the  “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  The stately dame had fallen on her knees, with her forehead on the holy knees of the Old Maid, one hand upon the floor, and the other pressed convulsively against her heart.  It clutched a lock of hair, once sable, now discolored with a greenish mould.  As the priest and layman advanced into the chamber, the Old Maid’s features assumed such a resemblance of shifting expression, that they trusted to hear the whole mystery explained, by a single word.  But it was only the shadow of a tattered curtain, waving betwixt the dead face and the moonlight.  “Both dead!” said the venerable man.  “Then who shall divulge the secret?  Methinks it glimmers to and fro in my mind, like the light and shadow across the Old Maid’s face.  And now’t is gone!”"]]]
