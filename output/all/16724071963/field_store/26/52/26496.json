James G. Whitmore was not a man who took things calmly; had he been a woman he would have been called fussy.  “What in--what was you making a race track out of the grade for,” he demanded, after he had bestowed a hasty kiss beside the nose of his sister.  Chip dropped a heavy trunk upon the porch and reached for the guitar before he answered.  “I was just trying those new springs on the buggy.”  “It was very exciting,” commented Miss Whitmore, airily. “I shot a coyote, J. G., but we lost it coming down the hill. Your men were playing a funny game--hare and hounds, it looked like. Or were they breaking a new horse?”  The Old Man looked at Chip, intelligence dawning in his face. There was something back of it all, he knew. He had been asleep when the uproar began, and had reached the door only in time to see the creams come down the grade like a daylight shooting star.  “I guess they was breaking a bronk,” he said, carelessly; “you've got enough baggage for a trip round the world, Dell. I hope it ain't all dope for us poor devils. Tell Shorty I want t' see him, Chip.”  Chip took the reins from the Old Man's hands, sprang in and drove back down the hill to the stables.   The “reception committee,” as Chip sarcastically christened them, rounded up the runaway and sneaked back to the ranch by the coulee trail. With much unseemly language, they stripped the saddle and a flapping pair of overalls off poor, disgraced Banjo, and kicked him out of the corral.  “That's the way Jack's schemes always pan out,” grumbled Slim. “By golly, yuh don't get me into another jackpot like that!”  “You might explain why you let that” (several kinds of) “cayuse get away from you!” retorted Jack, fretfully. “If you'd been onto your job, things would have been smooth as silk.”  “Wonder what the old maid thought,” broke in Weary, bent on preserving peace in the Happy Family.  “I'll bet she never saw us at all!” laughed Cal. “Old Splinter gave her all she wanted to do, hanging to the rig. The way he came down that grade wasn't slow. He just missed running into Banjo on the Hog's Back by the skin of the teeth. If he had, it'd be good-by, doctor--and Chip, too. Gee, that was a close shave!”  “Well,” said Happy Jack, mournfully, “if we don't all get the bounce for this, I miss my guess. It's a little the worst we've done yet.”  “Except that time we tin-canned that stray steer, last winter,” amended Weary, chuckling over the remembrance as he fastened the big gate behind them.  “Yes, that was another of Jack's fool schemes,” put in Slim. “Go and tin-can a four-year-old steer and let him take after the Old Man and put him on the calf shed, first pass he made. Old Man was sure hot about that--by golly, it didn't help his rheumatism none.”  “He'll sure go straight in the air over this,” reiterated Happy Jack, with mournful conviction.  “There's old Splinter at the bunk house--drawing our pictures, I'll bet a dollar. Hey, Chip! How you vas, already yet?” sung out Weary, whose sunny temper no calamity could sour.  Chip glanced at them and went on cutting the leaves of a late magazine which he had purloined from the Dry Lake barber. Cal Emmett strode up and grabbed the limp, gray hat from his head and began using it for a football.  “Here! Give that back!” commanded Chip, laughing. “DON'T make a dish rag of my new John B. Stetson, Cal. It won't be fit for the dance.”  “Gee! It don't lack much of being a dish rag, now, if I'm any judge. Now! Great Scott!” He held it at arm's length and regarded it derisively.  “Well, it was new two years ago,” explained Chip, making an ineffectual grab at it.  Cal threw it to him and came and sat down upon his heels to peer over Chip's arm at the magazine.  “How's the old maid doctor?” asked Jack Bates, leaning against the door while he rolled a cigarette.  “Scared plum to death. I left the remains in the Old Man's arms.”  “Was she scared, honest?” Cal left off studying the “Types of Fair Women.”  “What did she say when we broke loose?” Jack drew a match sharply along a log.  “Nothing. Well, yes, she said 'Are they going to H-A-N-G that man?'”  Chip's voice quavered the words in a shrill falsetto.  “The deuce she did!” Jack indulged in a gratified laugh.  “What did she say when you put the creams under the whip, up there? I don't suppose the old girl is wise to the fact that you saved her neck right then--but you sure did. You done yourself proud, Splinter.” Cal patted Chip's knee approvingly.  Chip blushed under the praise and hastily answered the question.  “She hollered out: 'Stop! There goes my COYOTE!'”  “Her COYOTE?”  “HER coyote?”  “What the devil was she doing with a COYOTE?”  The Happy Family stood transfixed, and Chip's eyes were seen to laugh.  “HER COYOTE. Did any of you fellows happen to see a dead coyote up on the grade? Because if you did, it's the doctor's.”  Weary Willie walked deliberately over and seized Chip by the shoulders, bringing him to his feet with one powerful yank.  “Don't you try throwing any loads into THIS crowd, young man. Answer me truly-s'help yuh. How did that old maid come by a coyote--a dead one?”  Chip squirmed loose and reached for his cigarette book. “She shot it,”  he said, calmly, but with twitching lips.  “Shot it!” Five voices made up the incredulous echo.  “What with?” demanded Weary when he got his breath.  “With my rifle. I brought it out from town today. Bert Rogers had left it at the barber shop for me.”  “Gee whiz! And them creams hating a gun like poison! She didn't shoot from the rig, did she?”  “Yes,” said Chip, “she did. The first time she didn't know any better--and the second time she was hot at me for hinting she was scared. She's a spunky little devil, all right. She's busy hating me right now for running the grade--thinks I did it to scare her, I guess. That's all some fool women know.”  “She's a howling sport, then!” groaned Cal, who much preferred the Sweet Young Things.  “No--I sized her up as a maverick.”  “What does she look like?”  “How old is she?”  “I never asked her age,” replied Chip, his face lighting briefly in a smile. “As to her looks, she isn't cross-eyed, and she isn't four-eyed. That's as much as I noticed.” After this bald lie he became busy with his cigarette. “Give me that magazine, Cal. I didn't finish cutting the leaves.”       CHAPTER III. -- Silver.    Miss Della Whitmore gazed meditatively down the hill at the bunk house. The boys were all at work, she knew. She had heard J. G. tell two of them to “ride the sheep coulee fence,” and had been consumed with amazed curiosity at the order. Wherefore should two sturdy young men be commanded to ride a fence, when there were horses that assuredly needed exercise--judging by their antics--and needed it badly? She resolved to ask J. G. at the first opportunity.  The others were down at the corrals, branding a few calves which belonged on the home ranch. She had announced her intention of going to look on, and her brother, knowing how the boys would regard her presence, had told her plainly that they did not want her. He said it was no place for girls, anyway. Then he had put on a very dirty pair of overalls and hurried down to help for he was not above lending a hand when there was extra work to be done.  Miss Della Whitmore tidied the kitchen and dusted the sitting room, and then, having a pair of mischievously idle hands and a very feminine curiosity, conceived an irrepressible desire to inspect the bunk house.  J. G. would tell her that, also, was no place for girls, she supposed, but J. G. was not present, so his opinion did not concern her. She had been at the Flying U ranch a whole week, and was beginning to feel that its resources for entertainment--aside from the masculine contingent, which held some promising material--were about exhausted. She had climbed the bluffs which hemmed the coulee on either side, had selected her own private saddle horse, a little sorrel named Concho, and had made friends with Patsy, the cook. She had dazzled Cal Emmett with her wiles and had found occasion to show Chip how little she thought of him; a highly unsatisfactory achievement, since Chip calmly over-looked her whenever common politeness permitted him.  There yet remained the unexplored mystery of that little cabin down the slope, from which sounded so much boylike laughter of an evening. She watched and waited till she was positive the coast was clear, then clapped an old hat of J. G.'s upon her head and ran lightly down the hill.  With her hand upon the knob, she ran her eye critically along the outer wall and decided that it had, at some remote date, been treated to a coat of whitewash; gave the knob a sudden twist, with a backward glance like a child stealing cookies, stepped in and came near falling headlong. She had not expected that remoteness of floor common to cabins built on a side hill.  “Well!” She pulled herself together and looked curiously about her. What struck her at first was the total absence of bunks. There were a couple of plain, iron bedsteads and two wooden ones made of rough planks. There was a funny-looking table made of an inverted coffee box with legs of two-by-four, and littered with a characteristic collection of bachelor trinkets. There was a glass lamp with a badly smoked chimney, a pack of cards, a sack of smoking tobacco and a box of matches. There was a tin box with spools of very coarse thread, some equally coarse needles and a pair of scissors. There was also--and Miss Whitmore gasped when she saw it--a pile of much-read magazines with the latest number of her favorite upon the top. She went closer and examined them, and glanced around the room with doubting eyes. There were spurs, quirts, chaps and queer-looking bits upon the walls; there were cigarette stubs"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9267"],["title","Chip, of the Flying U (#4)"],["body","burned matches innumerable upon the rough, board floor, and here in her hand--she turned the pages of her favorite abstractedly and a paper fluttered out and fell, face upward, on the floor. She stooped and recovered it, glanced and gasped.  “Well!”  It was only a pencil sketch done on cheap, unruled tablet paper, but her mind dissolved into a chaos of interrogation marks and exclamation points--with the latter predominating more and more the longer she looked.  It showed blunt-topped hills and a shallow coulee which she remembered perfectly. In the foreground a young woman in a smart tailored costume, the accuracy of which was something amazing, stood proudly surveying a dead coyote at her feet. In a corner of the picture stood a weather-beaten stump with a long, thin splinter beside it on the ground. Underneath was written in characters beautifully symmetrical: “The old maid's credential card.”  There was no gainsaying the likeness; even the rakish tilt of the jaunty felt hat, caused by the wind and that wild dash across country, was painstakingly reproduced. And the fanciful tucks on the sleeve of the gown--“and I didn't suppose he had deigned so much as a glance!” was her first coherent thought.  Miss Whitmore's soul burned with resentment. No woman, even at twenty-three, loves to be called “the old maid”--especially by a keen-witted young man with square chin and lips with a pronounced curve to them. And whoever supposed the fellow could draw like that--and notice every tiny little detail without really looking once? Of course, she knew her hat was crooked, with the wind blowing one's head off, almost, but he had no business: “The old maid's credential card!”--“Old maid,” indeed!  “The audacity of him!”  “Beg pardon?”  Miss Whitmore wheeled quickly, her heart in the upper part of her throat, judging by the feel of it. Chip himself stood just inside the door, eying her coldly.  “I was not speaking,” said Miss Whitmore, haughtily, in futile denial.  To this surprising statement Chip had nothing to say. He went to one of the iron beds, stooped and drew out a bundle which, had Miss Whitmore asked him what it was, he would probably have called his “war sack.” She did not ask; she stood and watched him, though her conscience assured her it was a dreadfully rude thing to do, and that her place was up at the house. Miss Whitmore was frequently at odds with her conscience; at this time she stood her ground, backed by her pride, which was her chiefest ally in such emergencies.  When he drew a huge, murderous-looking revolver from its scabbard and proceeded calmly to insert cartridge after cartridge, Miss Whitmore was constrained to speech.  “Are you--going to--SHOOT something?”  The question struck them both as particularly inane, in view of his actions.  “I am,” replied he, without looking up. He whirled the cylinder into place, pushed the bundle back under the bed and rose, polishing the barrel of the gun with a silk handkerchief.  Miss Whitmore hoped he wasn't going to murder anyone; he looked keyed up to almost any desperate deed.  “Who--what are you going to shoot?” Really, the question asked itself.  Chip raised his eyes for a fleeting glance which took in the pencil sketch in her hand. Miss Whitmore observed that his eyes were much darker than hazel; they were almost black. And there was, strangely enough, not a particle of curve to his lips; they were thin, and straight, and stern.  “Silver. He broke his leg.”  “Oh!” There was real horror in her tone. Miss Whitmore knew all about Silver from garrulous Patsy. Chip had rescued a pretty, brown colt from starving on the range, had bought him of the owner, petted and cared for him until he was now one of the best saddle horses on the ranch. He was a dark chestnut, with beautiful white, crinkly mane and tail and white feet. Miss Whitmore had seen Chip riding him down the coulee trail only yesterday, and now--Her heart ached with the pity of it.  “How did it happen?”  “I don't know. He was in the little pasture. Got kicked, maybe.” Chip jerked open the door with a force greatly in excess of the need of it.  Miss Whitmore started impulsively toward him. Her eyes were not quite clear.  “Don't--not yet! Let me go. If it's a straight break I can set the bone and save him.”  Chip, savage in his misery, regarded her over one square shoulder.  “Are you a veterinary surgeon, may I ask?”  Miss Whitmore felt her cheeks grow hot, but she stood her ground.  “I am not. But a broken bone is a broken bone, whether it belongs to a man--or some OTHER beast!”  “Y--e-s?”  Chip's way of saying yes was one of his chief weapons of annihilation. He had a peculiar, taunting inflection which he could give to it, upon occasion, which caused prickles of flesh upon the victim. To say that Miss Whitmore was not utterly quenched argues well for her courage. She only gasped, as though treated to an unexpected dash of cold water, and went on.  “I'm sure I might save him if you'd let me try. Or are you really eager to shoot him?”  Chip's muscles shrank. Eager to shoot him--Silver, the only thing that loved and understood him?  “You may come and look at him, if you like,” he said, after a breath or two.  Miss Whitmore overlooked the tolerance of the tone and stepped to his side, mechanically clutching the sketch in her fingers. It was Chip, looking down at her from his extra foot of height, who called her attention to it.  “Are you thinking of using that for a plaster?”  Miss Whitmore started and blushed, then, with an uptilt of chin:  “If I need a strong irritant, yes!” She calmly rolled the paper into a tiny tube and thrust it into the front of her pink shirt-waist for want of a pocket--and Chip, watching her surreptitiously, felt a queer grip in his chest, which he thought it best to set down as anger.  Silently they hurried down where Silver lay, his beautiful, gleaming mane brushing the tender green of the young grass blades. He lifted his head when he heard Chip's step, and neighed wistfully. Chip bent over him, black agony in his eyes. Miss Whitmore, looking on, realized for the first time that the suffering of the horse was a mere trifle compared to that of his master. Her eyes wandered to the loaded revolver which bulged his pocket behind, and she shuddered--but not for Silver. She went closer and laid her hand upon the shimmery mane. The horse snorted nervously and struggled to rise.  “He's not used to a woman,” said Chip, with a certain accent of pride. “I guess this is the closest he's ever been to one. You see, he's never had any one handle him but me.”  “Then he certainly is no lady's horse,” said Miss Whitmore, good-naturedly. Somehow, in the last moment, her attitude toward Chip had changed considerably. “Try and make him let me feel the break.”  With much coaxing and soothing words it was accomplished, and it did not take long, for it was a front leg, broken straight across, just above the fetlock. Miss Whitmore stood up and smiled into the young man's eyes, conscious of a desire to bring the curve back into his lips.  “It's very simple,” she declared, cheerfully. “I know I can cure him. We had a colt at home with his leg broken the same way, and he was entirely cured--and doesn't even limp. Of course,” she added, honestly, “Uncle John doctored him--but I helped.”  Chip drew the back of his gloved hand quickly across his eyes and swallowed.  “Miss Whitmore--if you could save old Silver--”  Miss Whitmore, the self-contained young medical graduate, blinked rapidly and found urgent need of tucking in wind-blown, brown locks, with her back to the tall cow-puncher who had unwittingly dropped his mask for an instant. She took off J. G.'s old hat, turned it clean around twice and put it back exactly as it was before; unless the tilt over her left ear was a trifle more pronounced. Show me the woman who can set a hat straight upon her head without aid of a mirror!  “We must get him up from there and into a box stall. There is one, isn't there?”  “Y--e-s--” Chip hesitated. “I wouldn't ask the Old--your brother, for the use of it, though; not even for Silver.”  “I will,” returned she, promptly. “I never feel any compunction about asking for what I want--if I can't get it any other way. I can't understand why you wanted to shoot--you must have known this bone could be set.”  “I didn't WANT to--” Chip bent over and drove a fly from Silver's shoulder. “When a horse belonging to the outfit gets crippled like that, he makes coyote bait. A forty-dollar cow-puncher can't expect any better for his own horse.”  “He'll GET better, whatever he may expect. I'm just spoiling for something to practice on, anyway--and he's such a beauty. If you can get him up, lead him to the stable while I go and tell J. G. and get some one to help.” She started away.  “Whom shall I get?” she called back.  “Weary, if you can--and Slim's a good hand with horses, too.”  “Slim--is that the tall, lanky man?”  “No--he's the short, fat one. That bean-pole is Shorty.”  Miss Whitmore fixed these facts firmly in her memory and ran swiftly to where rose all the dust and noise from the further corral. She climbed up until she could look conveniently over the top rail. The fence seemed to her dreadfully high--a clear waste of straight, sturdy poles.  “J. G--e-e-e!”  “Baw--h-h-h!” came answer from a wholly unexpected source as a big, red cow charged and struck the fence under her feet a blow which nearly dislodged her from her perch. The cow recoiled a few steps and lowered her head truculently.  “Scat! Shoo, there! Go on away, you horrid old thing you! Oh, J. G--e-e-e!”  Weary, who was roping, had just dragged a calf up to the fire and was making a loop to catch another when the cow made a second charge at the fence. He dashed in ahead of her, his horse narrowly escaping an ugly gash from her long, wicked horns. As he dodged he threw his rope with the peculiar, back-hand twist of the practiced roper, catching her by the head and"]]]
