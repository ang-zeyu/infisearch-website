There are other details I might mention--that cane, for instance--but let it pass. I shall keep this, I think, as a companion to 'The old maid's credential card.'”  “Are you in the habit of keeping other folk's property?” inquired Chip, with some acerbity.  “Nothing but personal caricatures--and hearts, perhaps,” returned the Little Doctor, sweetly.  “I hardly think your collection of the last named article is very large,” retorted Chip.  “Still, I added to the collection to-day,” pursued Miss Whitmore, calmly. “I shared my seat in the train with J. G.'s silent partner (I did not find him silent, however), Mr. Duncan Whitaker. He hired a team in Dry Lake and we came out together, and I believe--please don't mention Dr. Cecil Granthum to him, will you?”  Chip wished, quite savagely, that she wouldn't let those dimples dodge into her cheeks, and the laugh dodge into her eyes, like that. It made a fellow uncomfortable. He was thoroughly disgusted with her--or he would be, if she would only stop looking like that. He was in that state of mind where his only salvation, seemingly, lay in quarreling with some one immediately.  “So old Dunk's come back? If you've got his heart, you must have gone hunting it with a microscope, for it's a mighty small one--almost as small as his soul. No one else even knew he had one. You ought to have it set in a ring, so you won't lose it.”  “I don't wear phony jewelry, thank you,” said Miss Whitmore, and Chip thought dimples weren't so bad after all.  The Little Doctor was weaving Silver's mane about her white fingers and meditating deeply. Chip wondered if she were thinking of Dr. Cecil.  “Where did you learn to draw like that?” she asked, suddenly, turning toward him. “You do much better than I, and I've always been learning from good teachers. Did you ever try painting?”  Chip blushed and looked away from her. This was treading close to his deep-hidden, inner self.  “I don't know where I learned. I never took a lesson in my life, except from watching people and horses and the country, and remembering the lines they made, you know. I always made pictures, ever since I can remember--but I never tried colors very much. I never had a chance, working around cow-camps and on ranches.”  “I'd like to have you look over some of my sketches and things--and I've paints and canvas, if you ever care to try that. Come up to the house some evening and I'll show you my daubs. They're none of them as good as 'The Old Maid.'”  “I wish you'd tear that thing up!” said Chip, vehemently.  “Why? The likeness is perfect. One would think you were designer for a fashion paper, the way you got the tucks in my sleeve and the braid on my collar--and you might have had the kindness to TELL me my hat was on crooked, I think!”  There was a rustle in the loose straw, a distant slam of the stable door, and Chip sat alone with his horse, whittling abstractedly at his pencil till his knife blade grated upon the metal which held the eraser.       CHAPTER VI. -- The Hum of Preparation.    Miss Whitmore ran down to the blacksmith shop, waving an official-looking paper in her hand.  “I've got it, J. G.!”  “Got what--smallpox?” J. G. did not even look up from the iron he was welding.  “No, my license. I'm a really, truly doctor now, and you needn't laugh, either. You said you'd give a dance if I passed, and I did. Happy Jack brought it just now.”  “Brought the dance?” The Old Man gave the bellows a pull which sent a shower of sparks toward the really, truly doctor.  “Brought the license,” she explained, patiently. “You can see for yourself. They were awfully nice to me--they seemed to think a girl doctor is some kind of joke out here. They didn't make it any easier, though; they acted as if they didn't expect me to pass--but I did!”  The Old Man rubbed one smutty hand down his trousers leg and extended it for the precious document. “Let me have a look at it,” he said, trying to hide his pride in her.  “Well, but I'll hold it. Your hands are dirty.” Dr. Whitmore eyed the hands disapprovingly.  The Old Man read it slowly through, growing prouder every line.  “You're all right, Dell--I'll be doggoned if you ain't. Don't you worry about the dance--I'll see't yuh get it. You go tell the Countess to bake up a lot of cake and truck, and I'll send some uh the boys around t' tell the neighbors. Better have it Friday night, I guess--I'm goin t' start the round-up out early next week. Doggone it! I've gone and burned that weldin'. Go on and stop your botherin' me!”  In two minutes the Little Doctor was back, breathless.  “What about the music, J. G.? We want GOOD music.”  “Well, I'll tend t' that part. Say! You can rig up that room off the dining room for your office--I s'pose you'll have to have one. You make out a list of what dope you want--and be sure yuh get a-plenty. I look for an unhealthy summer among the cow-punchers. If I ain't mistook in the symptoms, Dunk's got palpitation uh the heart right now--an' got it serious.”  The Old Man chuckled to himself and went back to his welding.  “Oh, Louise!” The Little Doctor hurried to where the Countess was scrubbing the kitchen steps with soft soap and sand and considerable energy. “J. G. says I may have a dance next Friday night, so we must hurry and fix the house--only I don't see much fixing to be done; everything is SO clean.”  “Oh, there ain't a room in the house fit fer comp'ny t' walk into,”  expostulated the Countess while she scrubbed. “I do like t' see a house clean when folks is expected that only come t' be critical an' make remarks behind yer back the minit they git away. If folks got anything t' say I'd a good deal ruther they said it t' my face an' be done with it. 'Yuh can know a man's face but yuh can't know his heart,' as the sayin' is, an' it's the same way with women--anyway, it's the same way with Mis' Beckman. You can know her face a mile off, but yuh never know who she's goin' t' rake over the coals next. As the sayin' is: 'The tongue of a woman, at last it biteth like a serpent an' it stingeth like an addle,' an' I guess it's so. Anyway, Mis' Beckman's does. I do b'lieve on my soul--what's the matter, Dell? What yuh laughin' at?”  The Little Doctor was past speech for the moment, and the Countess stood up and looked curiously around her. It never occurred to her that she might be the cause of that convulsive outburst.  “Oh--he--never mind--he's gone, now.”  “Who's gone?” persisted the Countess.  “What kinds of cake do you think we ought to have?” asked the Little Doctor, diplomatically.  The Countess sank to her knees and dipped a handful of amber, jelly-like soap from a tin butter can.  “Well, I don't know. I s'pose folks will look for something fancy, seein' you're givin' the dance. Mis' Beckman sets herself up as a shinin' example on cake, and she'll come just t' be critical an' find fault, if she can. If I can't bake all around her the best day she ever seen, I'll give up cookin' anything but spuds. She had the soggiest kind uh jelly roll t' the su'prise on Mary last winter. I know it was hern, fer I seen her bring it in, an' I went straight an' ondone it. I guess it was kinda mean uh me, but I don't care--as the sayin' is: 'What's sass fer the goose is good enough sass fer anybody'--an' she done the same trick by me, at the su'prise at Adamses last fall. But she couldn't find no kick about MY cake, an' hers--yuh c'd of knocked a cow down with it left-handed! If that's the best she c'n do on cake I'd advise 'er to keep the next batch t' home where they're used to it. They say't 'What's one man's meat 's pizen t' the other feller,' and I guess it's so enough. Maybe Mame an' the rest uh them Beckman kids can eat sech truck without comin' down in a bunch with gastakutus, but I'd hate t' tackle it myself.”  The Little Doctor gurgled. This was a malady which had not been mentioned at the medical college.  “Where shall we set the tables, if we dance in the dining room?” she asked, having heard enough of the Beckmans for the present.  “Why, we won't set any tables. Folks always have a lap supper at ranch dances. At the su'prise on Mary--”  “What is a lap supper?”  “Well, my stars alive! Where under the shinin' sun was you brought up if yuh never heard of a lap supper? A lap supper is where folks set around the walls--or any place they can find--and take the plates on their laps and yuh pass 'em stuff. The san'wiches--”  “You do make such beautiful bread!” interrupted the Little Doctor, very sincerely.  “Well, I ain't had the best uh luck, lately, but I guess it does taste good after that bread yuh had when I come. Soggy was no name for--”  “Patsy made that bread,” interposed Miss Whitmore, hastily. “He had bad luck, and--”  “I guess he did!” sniffed the Countess, contemptuously. “As I told Mary when I come--”  “I wonder how many cakes we'll need?” Miss Whitmore, you will observe, had learned to interrupt when she had anything to say. It was the only course to pursue with anyone from Denson coulee.  The Countess, having finished her scrubbing, rose jerkily and upset the soap can, which rolled over and over down the steps, leaving a yellow trail as it went.  “Well, there, if that wasn't a bright trick uh mine? They say the more yuh hurry the less yuh'll git along, an' that's a sample. We'd ought t' have five kinds, an' about four uh each kind. It wouldn't do t' run out, er Mis' Beckman never would let anybody hear the last of it. Down t' Mary's--”  “Twenty cakes! Good gracious! I'll have to order my stock of medicine, for I'll surely have a houseful of patients if the guests eat twenty cakes.”  “Well, as the sayin' is: 'Patience an' perseverance can git away with most anything,'” observed the Countess, naively.  The Little Doctor retired behind her handkerchief.  “My stars alive, I do b'lieve my bread's beginnin' t' scorch!” cried the Countess, and ran to see. The Little Doctor followed"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9267"],["title","Chip, of the Flying U (#8)"],["body","inside and sat down.  “We must make a list of the things we'll need, Louise. You--”  “Dell! Oh-h. Dell!” The voice of the Old Man resounded from the parlor.  “I'm in the kitchen!” called she, remaining where she was. He tramped heavily through the house to her.  “I'll send the rig in, t'morrow, if there's anything yuh want,” he remarked. “And if you'll make out a list uh dope, I'll send the order in t' the Falls. We've got plenty uh saws an' cold chisels down in the blacksmith shop--you can pick out what yuh want.” He dodged and grinned. “Got any cake, Countess?”  “Well, there ain't a thing cooked, hardly. I'm going t' bake up something right after dinner. Here's some sponge cake--but it ain't fit t' eat, hardly. I let Dell look in the oven, 'cause my han's was all over flour, an' she slammed the door an' it fell. But yuh can't expect one person t' know everything--an' too many han's can't make decent soup, as the sayin' is, an' it's the same way with cake.”  The Old Man winked at the Little Doctor over a great wedge of feathery delight. “I don't see nothing the matter with this--only it goes down too easy,” he assured the Countess between mouthfuls. “Fix up your list, Dell, and don't be afraid t' order everything yuh need. I'll foot the--”  The Old Man, thinking to go back to his work, stepped into the puddle of soft soap and sat emphatically down upon the top step, coasting rapidly to the bottom. A carpet slipper shot through the open door and landed in the dishpan; the other slipper disappeared mysteriously. The wedge of cake was immediately pounced upon by an investigative hen and carried in triumph to her brood.  “Good Lord!” J. G. struggled painfully to his feet. “Dell, who in thunder put that stuff there? You're a little too doggoned anxious for somebody t' practice on, seems t' me.” A tiny trickle of blood showed in the thin spot on his head.  “Are you hurt, J. G.? We--I spilled the soap.” The Little Doctor gazed solicitous, from the doorway.  “Huh! I see yuh spilled the soap, all right enough. I'm willin' to believe yuh did without no affidavit. Doggone it, a bachelor never has any such a man-trap around in a fellow's road. I've lived in Montana fourteen years, an' I never slipped up on my own doorstep till you got here. It takes a woman t' leave things around--where's my cake?”  “Old Specie took it down by the bunk house. Shall I go after it?”  “No, you needn't. Doggone it, this wading through ponds uh soft soap has got t' stop right here. I never had t' do it when I was baching, I notice.” He essayed, with the aid of a large splinter, to scrape the offending soap from his trousers.  “Certainly, you didn't. Bachelors never use soap,” retorted Della.  “Oh, they don't, hey? That's all you know about it. They don't use this doggoned, slimy truck, let me tell yuh. What d'yuh want, Chip? Oh, you've got t' grin, too! Dell, why don't yuh do something fer my head? What's your license good f er, I'd like t' know? You didn't see Dell's license, did yuh, Chip? Go and get it an' show it to him, Dell. It's good fer everything but gitting married--there ain't any cure for that complaint.”       CHAPTER VII. -- Love and a Stomach Pump.    An electrical undercurrent of expectation pervaded the very atmosphere of Flying U ranch. The musicians, two supercilious but undeniably efficient young men from Great Falls, had arrived two hours before and were being graciously entertained by the Little Doctor up at the house. The sandwiches stood waiting, the coffee was ready for the boiling water, and the dining-room floor was smooth as wax could make it.  For some reason unknown to himself, Chip was “in the deeps.” He even threatened to stop in the bunk house and said he didn't feel like dancing, but was brought into line by weight of numbers. He hated Dick Brown, anyway, for his cute, little yellow mustache that curled up at the ends like the tail of a drake. He had snubbed him all the way out from town and handled Dick's guitar with a recklessness that invited disaster. And the way Dick smirked when the Old Man introduced him to the Little Doctor--a girl with a fellow in the East oughtn't to let her eyes smile that way at a pin-headed little dude like Dick Brown, anyway. And he--Chip--had given, her a letter postmarked blatantly: “Gilroy, Ohio, 10:30 P. M.”--and she had been so taken up with those cussed musicians that she couldn't even thank him, and only just glanced at the letter before she stuck it inside her belt. Probably she wouldn't even read it till after the dance. He wondered if Dr. Cecil Granthum cared--oh, hell! Of COURSE he cared--that is, if he had any sense at all. But the Little Doctor--she wasn't above flirting, he noticed. If HE ever fell in love with a girl--which the Lord forbid--he'd take mighty good care she didn't get time to make dimples and smiles for some other fellow to go to heaven looking at.  There, that was her, laughing like she always laughed--it reminded him of pines nodding in a canyon and looking wise and whispering things they'd seen and heard before you were born, and of water falling over rocks, somehow. Queer, maybe--but it did. He wondered if Dick Brown had been trying to say something funny. He didn't see, for the life of him, how the Little Doctor could laugh at that little imitation man. Girls are--well, they're easy pleased, most of them.  Down in the bunk house the boys were hurrying into their “war togs”--which is, being interpreted, their best clothes. There was a nervous scramble over the cracked piece of a bar mirror--which had a history--and cries of “Get out!” “Let me there a minute, can't yuh?” and “Get up off my coat!” were painfully frequent.  Happy Jack struggled blindly with a refractory red tie, which his face rivaled in hue and sheen--for he had been generous of soap.  Weary had possessed himself of the glass and was shaving as leisurely as though four restive cow-punchers were not waiting anxiously their turn.  “For the Lord's sake, Weary!” spluttered Jack Bates. “Your whiskers grow faster'n you can shave 'em off, at that gait. Get a move on, can't yuh?”  Weary turned his belathered face sweetly upon Jack. “Getting in a hurry, Jacky? YOUR girl won't be there, and nobody else's girl is going to have time to see whether you shaved to-day or last Christmas. You don't want to worry so much about your looks, none of you. I hate to say it, but you act vain, all of you kids. Honest, I'm ashamed. Look at that gaudy countenance Happy's got on--and his necktie's most as bad.” He stropped his razor with exasperating nicety, stopping now and then to test its edge upon a hair from his own brown head.  Happy Jack, grown desperate over his tie and purple over Weary's remarks, craned his neck over the shoulder of that gentleman and leered into the mirror. When Happy liked, he could contort his naturally plain features into a diabolical grin which sent prickly waves creeping along the spine of the beholder.  Weary looked, stared, half rose from his chair.  “Holy smithereens! Quit it, Happy! You look like the devil by lightning.”  Happy, watching, seized the hand that held the razor; Cal, like a cat, pounced upon the mirror, and Jack Bates deftly wrenched the razor from Weary's fingers.  “Whoopee, boys! Some of you tie Weary down and set on him while I shave,” cried Cal, jubilant over the mutiny. “We'll make short work of this toilet business.”  Whereupon Weary was borne to the floor, bound hand and foot with silk handkerchiefs, carried bodily and laid upon his bed.  “Oh, the things I won't do to you for this!” he asserted, darkly. “There won't nary a son-of-a-gun uh yuh get a dance from my little schoolma'am--you'll see!” He grinned prophetically, closed his eyes and murmured: “Call me early, mother dear,” and straightway fell away into slumber and peaceful snoring, while the lather dried upon his face.  “Better turn Weary loose and wake him up, Chip,” suggested Jack Bates, half an hour later, shoving the stopper into his cologne bottle and making for the door. “At the rate the rigs are rolling in, it'll take us all to put up the teams.” The door slammed behind him as it had done behind the others as they hurried away.  “Here!” Chip untied Weary's hands and feet and took him by the shoulder. “Wake up, Willie, if you want to be Queen o' the May.”  Weary sat up and rubbed his eyes. “Confound them two Jacks! What time is it?”  “A little after eight. YOUR crowd hasn't, come yet, so you needn't worry. I'm not going up yet for a while, myself.”  “You're off your feed. Brace up and take all there is going, my son.”  Weary prepared to finish his interrupted beautification.  “I'm going to--all the bottles, that is. If that Dry Lake gang comes loaded down with whisky, like they generally do, we ought to get hold of it and cache every drop, Weary.”  Weary turned clear around to stare his astonishment.  “When did the W. C. T. U. get you by the collar?” he demanded.  “Aw, don't be a fool, Weary,” retorted Chip. “You can see it wouldn't look right for us to let any of the boys get full, or even half shot, seeing this is the Little Doctor's dance.”  Weary meditatively scraped his left jaw and wiped the lather from the razor upon a fragment of newspaper.  “Splinter, we've throwed in together ever since we drifted onto the same range, and I'm with you, uh course. But--don't overlook Dr. Cecil Granthum. I'd hate like the devil to see you git throwed down, because it'd hurt you worse than anybody I know.”  Chip calmly sifted some tobacco into a cigarette paper. His mouth was very straight and his brows very close together.  “It's a devilish good thing it was YOU said that, Weary. If it had been anyone else I'd punch his face for him.”  “Why, yes--an' I'd help you, too.” Weary, his mouth very much on one side of his face that he might the easier shave the other, spoke in fragments. “You don't take it amiss from--me, though. I can see--”  The door slammed with extreme violence, and Weary slashed"]]]
