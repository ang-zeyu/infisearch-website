What sculptor could reproduce it?\"  The marble was white as snow, but in its depths the veins of the lily were tinged with palest azure, and a faint flush lingered deep in its heart.  \"Don't ask me the reason of that,\" he smiled, noticing my wonder. \"I have no idea why the veins and heart are tinted, but they always are. Yesterday I tried one of Geneviève's gold-fish,--there it is.\"  The fish looked as if sculptured in marble. But if you held it to the light the stone was beautifully veined with a faint blue, and from somewhere within came a rosy light like the tint which slumbers in an opal. I looked into the basin. Once more it seemed filled with clearest crystal.  \"If I should touch it now?\" I demanded.  \"I don't know,\" he replied, \"but you had better not try.\"  \"There is one thing I'm curious about,\" I said, \"and that is where the ray of sunlight came from.\"  \"It looked like a sunbeam true enough,\" he said. \"I don't know, it always comes when I immerse any living thing. Perhaps,\" he continued, smiling, \"perhaps it is the vital spark of the creature escaping to the source from whence it came.\"  I saw he was mocking, and threatened him with a mahl-stick, but he only laughed and changed the subject.  \"Stay to lunch. Geneviève will be here directly.\"  \"I saw her going to early mass,\" I said, \"and she looked as fresh and sweet as that lily--before you destroyed it.\"  \"Do you think I destroyed it?\" said Boris gravely.  \"Destroyed, preserved, how can we tell?\"  We sat in the corner of a studio near his unfinished group of the \"Fates.\" He leaned back on the sofa, twirling a sculptor's chisel and squinting at his work.  \"By the way,\" he said, \"I have finished pointing up that old academic Ariadne, and I suppose it will have to go to the Salon. It's all I have ready this year, but after the success the 'Madonna' brought me I feel ashamed to send a thing like that.\"  The \"Madonna,\" an exquisite marble for which Geneviève had sat, had been the sensation of last year's Salon. I looked at the Ariadne. It was a magnificent piece of technical work, but I agreed with Boris that the world would expect something better of him than that. Still, it was impossible now to think of finishing in time for the Salon that splendid terrible group half shrouded in the marble behind me. The \"Fates\" would have to wait.  We were proud of Boris Yvain. We claimed him and he claimed us on the strength of his having been born in America, although his father was French and his mother was a Russian. Every one in the Beaux Arts called him Boris. And yet there were only two of us whom he addressed in the same familiar way--Jack Scott and myself.  Perhaps my being in love with Geneviève had something to do with his affection for me. Not that it had ever been acknowledged between us. But after all was settled, and she had told me with tears in her eyes that it was Boris whom she loved, I went over to his house and congratulated him. The perfect cordiality of that interview did not deceive either of us, I always believed, although to one at least it was a great comfort. I do not think he and Geneviève ever spoke of the matter together, but Boris knew.  Geneviève was lovely. The Madonna-like purity of her face might have been inspired by the Sanctus in Gounod's Mass. But I was always glad when she changed that mood for what we called her \"April Manoeuvres.\" She was often as variable as an April day. In the morning grave, dignified and sweet, at noon laughing, capricious, at evening whatever one least expected. I preferred her so rather than in that Madonna-like tranquillity which stirred the depths of my heart. I was dreaming of Geneviève when he spoke again.  \"What do you think of my discovery, Alec?\"  \"I think it wonderful.\"  \"I shall make no use of it, you know, beyond satisfying my own curiosity so far as may be, and the secret will die with me.\"  \"It would be rather a blow to sculpture, would it not? We painters lose more than we ever gain by photography.\"  Boris nodded, playing with the edge of the chisel.  \"This new vicious discovery would corrupt the world of art. No, I shall never confide the secret to any one,\" he said slowly.  It would be hard to find any one less informed about such phenomena than myself; but of course I had heard of mineral springs so saturated with silica that the leaves and twigs which fell into them were turned to stone after a time. I dimly comprehended the process, how the silica replaced the vegetable matter, atom by atom, and the result was a duplicate of the object in stone. This, I confess, had never interested me greatly, and as for the ancient fossils thus produced, they disgusted me. Boris, it appeared, feeling curiosity instead of repugnance, had investigated the subject, and had accidentally stumbled on a solution which, attacking the immersed object with a ferocity unheard of, in a second did the work of years. This was all I could make out of the strange story he had just been telling me. He spoke again after a long silence.  \"I am almost frightened when I think what I have found. Scientists would go mad over the discovery. It was so simple too; it discovered itself. When I think of that formula, and that new element precipitated in metallic scales--\"  \"What new element?\"  \"Oh, I haven't thought of naming it, and I don't believe I ever shall. There are enough precious metals now in the world to cut throats over.\"  I pricked up my ears. \"Have you struck gold, Boris?\"  \"No, better;--but see here, Alec!\" he laughed, starting up. \"You and I have all we need in this world. Ah! how sinister and covetous you look already!\" I laughed too, and told him I was devoured by the desire for gold, and we had better talk of something else; so when Geneviève came in shortly after, we had turned our backs on alchemy.  Geneviève was dressed in silvery grey from head to foot. The light glinted along the soft curves of her fair hair as she turned her cheek to Boris; then she saw me and returned my greeting. She had never before failed to blow me a kiss from the tips of her white fingers, and I promptly complained of the omission. She smiled and held out her hand, which dropped almost before it had touched mine; then she said, looking at Boris--  \"You must ask Alec to stay for luncheon.\" This also was something new. She had always asked me herself until to-day.  \"I did,\" said Boris shortly.  \"And you said yes, I hope?\" She turned to me with a charming conventional smile. I might have been an acquaintance of the day before yesterday. I made her a low bow. \"J'avais bien l'honneur, madame,\" but refusing to take up our usual bantering tone, she murmured a hospitable commonplace and disappeared. Boris and I looked at one another.  \"I had better go home, don't you think?\" I asked.  \"Hanged if I know,\" he replied frankly.  While we were discussing the advisability of my departure Geneviève reappeared in the doorway without her bonnet. She was wonderfully beautiful, but her colour was too deep and her lovely eyes were too bright. She came straight up to me and took my arm.  \"Luncheon is ready. Was I cross, Alec? I thought I had a headache, but I haven't. Come here, Boris;\" and she slipped her other arm through his. \"Alec knows that after you there is no one in the world whom I like as well as I like him, so if he sometimes feels snubbed it won't hurt him.\"  \"À la bonheur!\" I cried, \"who says there are no thunderstorms in April?\"  \"Are you ready?\" chanted Boris. \"Aye ready;\" and arm-in-arm we raced into the dining-room, scandalizing the servants. After all we were not so much to blame; Geneviève was eighteen, Boris was twenty-three, and I not quite twenty-one.     II  Some work that I was doing about this time on the decorations for Geneviève's boudoir kept me constantly at the quaint little hotel in the Rue Sainte-Cécile. Boris and I in those days laboured hard but as we pleased, which was fitfully, and we all three, with Jack Scott, idled a great deal together.  One quiet afternoon I had been wandering alone over the house examining curios, prying into odd corners, bringing out sweetmeats and cigars from strange hiding-places, and at last I stopped in the bathing-room. Boris, all over clay, stood there washing his hands.  The room was built of rose-coloured marble excepting the floor, which was tessellated in rose and grey. In the centre was a square pool sunken below the surface of the floor; steps led down into it, sculptured pillars supported a frescoed ceiling. A delicious marble Cupid appeared to have just alighted on his pedestal at the upper end of the room. The whole interior was Boris' work and mine. Boris, in his working-clothes of white canvas, scraped the traces of clay and red modelling wax from his handsome hands, and coquetted over his shoulder with the Cupid.  \"I see you,\" he insisted, \"don't try to look the other way and pretend not to see me. You know who made you, little humbug!\"  It was always my rôle to interpret Cupid's sentiments in these conversations, and when my turn came I responded in such a manner, that Boris seized my arm and dragged me toward the pool, declaring he would duck me. Next instant he dropped my arm and turned pale. \"Good God!\" he said, \"I forgot the pool is full of the solution!\"  I shivered a little, and dryly advised him to remember better where he had stored the precious liquid.  \"In Heaven's name, why do you keep a small lake of that gruesome stuff here of all places?\" I asked.  \"I want to experiment on something large,\" he replied.  \"On me, for instance?\"  \"Ah! that came too close for jesting; but I do want to watch the action of that solution on a more highly organized living body; there is that big white rabbit,\" he said, following me into the studio.  Jack Scott, wearing a paint-stained jacket, came wandering in, appropriated all the Oriental sweetmeats he could lay his hands on, looted the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8492"],["title","The King in Yellow (#8)"],["body","case, and finally he and Boris disappeared together to visit the Luxembourg Gallery, where a new silver bronze by Rodin and a landscape of Monet's were claiming the exclusive attention of artistic France. I went back to the studio, and resumed my work. It was a Renaissance screen, which Boris wanted me to paint for Geneviève's boudoir. But the small boy who was unwillingly dawdling through a series of poses for it, to-day refused all bribes to be good. He never rested an instant in the same position, and inside of five minutes I had as many different outlines of the little beggar.  \"Are you posing, or are you executing a song and dance, my friend?\" I inquired.  \"Whichever monsieur pleases,\" he replied, with an angelic smile.  Of course I dismissed him for the day, and of course I paid him for the full time, that being the way we spoil our models.  After the young imp had gone, I made a few perfunctory daubs at my work, but was so thoroughly out of humour, that it took me the rest of the afternoon to undo the damage I had done, so at last I scraped my palette, stuck my brushes in a bowl of black soap, and strolled into the smoking-room. I really believe that, excepting Geneviève's apartments, no room in the house was so free from the perfume of tobacco as this one. It was a queer chaos of odds and ends, hung with threadbare tapestry. A sweet-toned old spinet in good repair stood by the window. There were stands of weapons, some old and dull, others bright and modern, festoons of Indian and Turkish armour over the mantel, two or three good pictures, and a pipe-rack. It was here that we used to come for new sensations in smoking. I doubt if any type of pipe ever existed which was not represented in that rack. When we had selected one, we immediately carried it somewhere else and smoked it; for the place was, on the whole, more gloomy and less inviting than any in the house. But this afternoon, the twilight was very soothing, the rugs and skins on the floor looked brown and soft and drowsy; the big couch was piled with cushions--I found my pipe and curled up there for an unaccustomed smoke in the smoking-room. I had chosen one with a long flexible stem, and lighting it fell to dreaming. After a while it went out, but I did not stir. I dreamed on and presently fell asleep.  I awoke to the saddest music I had ever heard. The room was quite dark, I had no idea what time it was. A ray of moonlight silvered one edge of the old spinet, and the polished wood seemed to exhale the sounds as perfume floats above a box of sandalwood. Some one rose in the darkness, and came away weeping quietly, and I was fool enough to cry out \"Geneviève!\"  She dropped at my voice, and, I had time to curse myself while I made a light and tried to raise her from the floor. She shrank away with a murmur of pain. She was very quiet, and asked for Boris. I carried her to the divan, and went to look for him, but he was not in the house, and the servants were gone to bed. Perplexed and anxious, I hurried back to Geneviève. She lay where I had left her, looking very white.  \"I can't find Boris nor any of the servants,\" I said.  \"I know,\" she answered faintly, \"Boris has gone to Ept with Mr. Scott. I did not remember when I sent you for him just now.\"  \"But he can't get back in that case before to-morrow afternoon, and--are you hurt? Did I frighten you into falling? What an awful fool I am, but I was only half awake.\"  \"Boris thought you had gone home before dinner. Do please excuse us for letting you stay here all this time.\"  \"I have had a long nap,\" I laughed, \"so sound that I did not know whether I was still asleep or not when I found myself staring at a figure that was moving toward me, and called out your name. Have you been trying the old spinet? You must have played very softly.\"  I would tell a thousand more lies worse than that one to see the look of relief that came into her face. She smiled adorably, and said in her natural voice: \"Alec, I tripped on that wolf's head, and I think my ankle is sprained. Please call Marie, and then go home.\"  I did as she bade me, and left her there when the maid came in.     III  At noon next day when I called, I found Boris walking restlessly about his studio.  \"Geneviève is asleep just now,\" he told me, \"the sprain is nothing, but why should she have such a high fever? The doctor can't account for it; or else he will not,\" he muttered.  \"Geneviève has a fever?\" I asked.  \"I should say so, and has actually been a little light-headed at intervals all night. The idea! gay little Geneviève, without a care in the world,--and she keeps saying her heart's broken, and she wants to die!\"  My own heart stood still.  Boris leaned against the door of his studio, looking down, his hands in his pockets, his kind, keen eyes clouded, a new line of trouble drawn \"over the mouth's good mark, that made the smile.\" The maid had orders to summon him the instant Geneviève opened her eyes. We waited and waited, and Boris, growing restless, wandered about, fussing with modelling wax and red clay. Suddenly he started for the next room. \"Come and see my rose-coloured bath full of death!\" he cried.  \"Is it death?\" I asked, to humour his mood.  \"You are not prepared to call it life, I suppose,\" he answered. As he spoke he plucked a solitary goldfish squirming and twisting out of its globe. \"We'll send this one after the other--wherever that is,\" he said. There was feverish excitement in his voice. A dull weight of fever lay on my limbs and on my brain as I followed him to the fair crystal pool with its pink-tinted sides; and he dropped the creature in. Falling, its scales flashed with a hot orange gleam in its angry twistings and contortions; the moment it struck the liquid it became rigid and sank heavily to the bottom. Then came the milky foam, the splendid hues radiating on the surface and then the shaft of pure serene light broke through from seemingly infinite depths. Boris plunged in his hand and drew out an exquisite marble thing, blue-veined, rose-tinted, and glistening with opalescent drops.  \"Child's play,\" he muttered, and looked wearily, longingly at me,--as if I could answer such questions! But Jack Scott came in and entered into the \"game,\" as he called it, with ardour. Nothing would do but to try the experiment on the white rabbit then and there. I was willing that Boris should find distraction from his cares, but I hated to see the life go out of a warm, living creature and I declined to be present. Picking up a book at random, I sat down in the studio to read. Alas! I had found _The King in Yellow_. After a few moments, which seemed ages, I was putting it away with a nervous shudder, when Boris and Jack came in bringing their marble rabbit. At the same time the bell rang above, and a cry came from the sick-room. Boris was gone like a flash, and the next moment he called, \"Jack, run for the doctor; bring him back with you. Alec, come here.\"  I went and stood at her door. A frightened maid came out in haste and ran away to fetch some remedy. Geneviève, sitting bolt upright, with crimson cheeks and glittering eyes, babbled incessantly and resisted Boris' gentle restraint. He called me to help. At my first touch she sighed and sank back, closing her eyes, and then--then--as we still bent above her, she opened them again, looked straight into Boris' face--poor fever-crazed girl!--and told her secret. At the same instant our three lives turned into new channels; the bond that held us so long together snapped for ever and a new bond was forged in its place, for she had spoken my name, and as the fever tortured her, her heart poured out its load of hidden sorrow. Amazed and dumb I bowed my head, while my face burned like a live coal, and the blood surged in my ears, stupefying me with its clamour. Incapable of movement, incapable of speech, I listened to her feverish words in an agony of shame and sorrow. I could not silence her, I could not look at Boris. Then I felt an arm upon my shoulder, and Boris turned a bloodless face to mine.  \"It is not your fault, Alec; don't grieve so if she loves you--\" but he could not finish; and as the doctor stepped swiftly into the room, saying--\"Ah, the fever!\" I seized Jack Scott and hurried him to the street, saying, \"Boris would rather be alone.\" We crossed the street to our own apartments, and that night, seeing I was going to be ill too, he went for the doctor again. The last thing I recollect with any distinctness was hearing Jack say, \"For Heaven's sake, doctor, what ails him, to wear a face like that?\" and I thought of _The King in Yellow_ and the Pallid Mask.  I was very ill, for the strain of two years which I had endured since that fatal May morning when Geneviève murmured, \"I love you, but I think I love Boris best,\" told on me at last. I had never imagined that it could become more than I could endure. Outwardly tranquil, I had deceived myself. Although the inward battle raged night after night, and I, lying alone in my room, cursed myself for rebellious thoughts unloyal to Boris and unworthy of Geneviève, the morning always brought relief, and I returned to Geneviève and to my dear Boris with a heart washed clean by the tempests of the night.  Never in word or deed or thought while with them had I betrayed my sorrow even to myself.  The mask of self-deception was no longer a mask for me, it was a part of me. Night lifted it, laying bare the stifled truth below; but there was no one to see except myself, and when the day broke the mask fell back again of its own accord. These thoughts passed through my troubled mind as I lay sick, but they were hopelessly entangled with visions of white creatures, heavy as stone, crawling about in Boris' basin,--of the wolf's head on the rug, foaming and snapping at Geneviève, who lay smiling beside it. I thought, too, of the King in Yellow wrapped in the fantastic colours of his tattered mantle, and that bitter cry of Cassilda, \"Not"]]]
