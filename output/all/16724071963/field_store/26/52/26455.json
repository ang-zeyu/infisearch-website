Lemma IV.  If from a body or individual, compounded of several bodies, certain bodies be  separated, and if, at the same time, an equal number of other bodies of the same nature  take their place, the individual will preserve its nature as before, without any change in its  actuality (forma).  >>>>>Proof--Bodies (Lemma i.) are not distinguished in respect of substance:  that which  constitutes the actuality (formam) of an individual consists (by the last Def.) in a union of  bodies; but this union, although there is a continual change of bodies, will (by our  hypothesis) be maintained; the individual, therefore, will retain its nature as before, both in  respect of substance and in respect of mode.  Q.E.D.  Lemma V.  If the parts composing an individual become greater or less, but in such  proportion, that they all preserve the same mutual relations of motion and rest, the  individual will still preserve its original nature, and its actuality will not be changed.  >>>>>Proof--The same as for the last Lemma.  Lemma VI.  If certain bodies composing an individual be compelled to change the motion,  which they have in one direction, for motion in another direction, but in such a manner,  that they be able to continue their motions and their mutual communication in the same  relations as before, the individual will retain its own nature without any change of its  actuality.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is self-evident, for the individual is supposed to retain all  that, which, in its definition, we spoke of as its actual being.  Lemma VII.  Furthermore, the individual thus composed preserves its nature, whether it  be, as a whole, in motion or at rest, whether it be moved in this or that direction; so long  as each part retains its motion, and preserves its communication with other parts as  before.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is evident from the definition of an individual prefixed to  Lemma iv.  *****Note--We thus see, how a composite individual may be affected in many different  ways, and preserve its nature notwithstanding.  Thus far we have conceived an individual  as composed of bodies only distinguished one from the other in respect of motion and  rest, speed and slowness; that is, of bodies of the most simple character.  If, however, we  now conceive another individual composed of several individuals of diverse natures, we  shall find that the number of ways in which it can be affected, without losing its nature, will  be greatly multiplied.  Each of its parts would consist of several bodies, and therefore (by  Lemma vi.) each part would admit, without change to its nature, of quicker or slower  motion, and would consequently be able to transmit its motions more quickly or more  slowly to the remaining parts.  If we further conceive a third kind of individuals composed  of individuals of this second kind, we shall find that they may be affected in a still greater number of ways without changing their actuality.  We may easily proceed thus to infinity,  and conceive the whole of nature as one individual, whose parts, that is, all bodies, vary in infinite ways, without any change in the individual as a whole. I should feel bound to  explain and demonstrate this point at more length, if I were writing a special treatise on  body.  But I have already said that such is not my object; I have only touched on the  question, because it enables me to prove easily that which I have in view.  POSTULATES I.  The human body is composed of a number of individual parts, of diverse nature, each  one of which is in itself extremely complex.  II.  Of the individual parts composing the human body some are fluid, some soft, some  hard.  III.  The individual parts composing the human body, and consequently the human body  itself, are affected in a variety of ways by external bodies.  IV.  The human body stands in need for its preservation of a number of other bodies, by  which it is continually, so to speak, regenerated.  V.  When the fluid part of the human body is determined by an external body to impinge  often on another soft part, it changes the surface of the latter, and, as it were, leaves the impression thereupon of the external body which impels it.  VI.  The human body can move external bodies, and arrange them in a variety of ways.  PROPOSITIONS XIV.  The human mind is capable of perceiving a great number of things, and is so in   proportion as its body is capable of receiving a great number of impressions.  >>>>>Proof--The human body (by Post. iii. and vi.) is affected in very many ways by  external bodies, and is capable in very many ways of affecting external bodies.  But (II.xii.)  the human mind must perceive all that takes place in the human body; the human mind is,  therefore, capable of perceiving a great number of things, and is so in proportion, &c.   Q.E.D.  XV.  The idea, which constitutes the actual being of the human mind, is not simple, but  compounded of a great number of ideas.  >>>>>Proof--The idea constituting the actual being of the human mind is the idea of the  body (II. xiii.), which (Post. i.) is composed of a great number of complex individual  parts.  But there is necessarily in God the idea of each individual part whereof the body is  composed (II. viii. Cor.); therefore (II. vii.), the idea of the human body is composed of  each of these numerous ideas of its component parts.  Q.E.D.  XVI.  The idea of every mode, in which the human body is affected by external bodies,  must involve the nature of the human body, and also the nature of the external body.  >>>>>Proof--All the modes, in which any given body is affected, follow from the nature  of the body affected, and also from the nature of the affecting body (by Ax. i., after the  Cor. of Lemma iii.), wherefore their idea is also necessarily (by I, Ax. iv.) involves the  nature of both bodies; therefore, the idea of every mode, in which the human body is  affected by external bodies, involves the nature of the human body and of the external  body. Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary I.--Hence it follows, first, that the human mind perceives the nature of a  variety of bodies, together with the nature of its own.  <<<<<Corollary II.--It follows, secondly, that the ideas, which we have of external bodies,  indicate rather the constitution of our own body than the nature of external bodies.  I have  amply illustrated this in the Appendix to Part I.  XVII.  If the human body is affected in a manner which involves the nature of any external  body, the human mind will regard the said external body as actually existing, or as present  to itself, until the human body be affected in such a way, as to exclude the existence or the  presence of the said external body.  >>>>>Proof--This proposition is self-evident, for so long as the human body continues to  be thus affected, so long will the human mind (II. xii.) regard this modification of the body  --that is (by the last Prop.), it will have the idea of the mode as actually existing, and this  idea involves the nature of the external body; therefore the mind (by II. xvi., Cor. i.) will regard the external body as actually existing, until it is affected, &c.  Q.E.D.  <<<<<Corollary--The mind is able to regard as present external bodies, by which the  human body has once been affected, even though they be no longer in existence or present.  >>>>>Proof--When external bodies determine the fluid parts of the human body, so that  they often impinge on the softer parts, they change the surface of the last named (Post. v);  hence (Ax. ii., after the Cor. of Lemma iii.) they are refracted therefrom in a different  manner from that which they followed before such change; and, further, when afterwards  they impinge on the new surfaces by their own spontaneous movement, they will be refracted in the same manner, as though they had been impelled towards those surfaces by  external bodies; consequently, they will, while they continue to be thus refracted, affect the  human body in the same manner, whereof the mind (II. xii.) will again take cognizance  --that is (II. xvii.), the mind will again regard the external body as present, and will do so,  as often as the fluid parts of the human body impinge on the aforesaid surfaces by their  own spontaneous motion.  Wherefore, although the external bodies, by which the human  body has once been affected, be no longer in existence, the mind will nevertheless regard  them as present, as often as this action of the body is repeated.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--We thus see how it comes about, as is often the case, that we regard as  present many things which are not.  It is possible that the same result may be brought about  by other causes; but I think it suffices for me here to have indicated one possible  explanation, just as well as if I had pointed out the true cause.  Indeed, I do not think I  am very far from the truth, for all my assumptions are based on postulates, which rest,  almost without exception, on experience, that cannot be controverted by those who have  shown, as we have, that the human body, as we feel it, exists (Cor. after II. xiii.).   Furthermore (II. vii. Cor., II. xvi. Cor. ii.), we clearly understand what is the difference  between the idea, say, of Peter, which constitutes the essence of Peter's mind, and the  idea of the said Peter, which is in another man, say, Paul.  The former directly answers to  the essence of Peter's own body, and only implies existence so long as Peter exists; the  latter indicates rather the disposition of Paul's body than the nature of Peter, and,  therefore, while this disposition of Paul's body lasts, Paul's mind will regard Peter as  present to itself, even though he no longer exists.  Further, to retain the usual"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/920"],["title","Ethics — Part 2 (#4)"],["body","ology, the modifications of the human body, of which the ideas represent external bodies as  present to us, we will call the images of things, though they do not recall the figure of  things.  When the mind regards bodies in this fashion, we say that it imagines. I will here  draw attention to the fact, in order to indicate where error lies, that the imaginations of the  mind, looked at in themselves, do not contain error.  The mind does not err in the mere act  of imagining, but only in so far as it is regarded as being without the idea, which excludes  the existence of such things as it imagines to be present to it.  If the mind, while imagining  non-existent things as present to it, is at the same time conscious that they do not really  exist, this power of imagination must be set down to the efficacy of its nature, and not to a  fault, especially if this faculty of imagination depend solely on its own nature--that is (I.  Def. vii.), if this faculty of imagination be free.  XVIII.  If the human body has once been affected by two or more bodies at the same  time, when the mind afterwards imagines any of them, it will straightway remember the  others also.  >>>>>Proof--The mind (II. xvii. Cor.) imagines any given body, because the human body  is affected and disposed by the impressions from an external body, in the same manner as  it is affected when certain of its parts are acted on by the said external body; but (by our  hypothesis) the body was then so disposed, that the mind imagined two bodies at once;  therefore, it will also in the second case imagine two bodies at once, and the mind, when  it imagines one, will straightway remember the other.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--We now clearly see what 'Memory' is.  It is simply a certain association of  ideas involving the nature of things outside the human body, which association arises in the  mind according to the order and association of the modifications (affectiones) of the  human body.  I say, first, it is an association of those ideas only, which involve the nature  of things outside the human body:  not of ideas which answer to the nature of the said  things:  ideas of the modifications of the human body are, strictly speaking (II. xvi.), those  which involve the nature both of the human body and of external bodies. I say, secondly,  that this association arises according to the order and association of the modifications of  the human body, in order to distinguish it from that association of ideas, which arises from  the order of the intellect, whereby the mind perceives things through their primary causes,  and which is in all men the same.  And hence we can further clearly understand, why the  mind from the thought of one thing, should straightway arrive at the thought of another  thing, which has no similarity with the first; for instance, from the thought of the word 'pomum' (an apple), a Roman would straightway arrive at the thought of the fruit apple,  which has no similitude with the articulate sound in question, nor anything in common  with it, except that the body of the man has often been affected by these two things; that  is, that the man has often heard the word 'pomum,' while he was looking at the fruit;  similarly every man will go on from one thought to another, according as his habit has  ordered the images of things in his body.  For a soldier, for instance, when he sees the  tracks of a horse in sand, will at once pass from the thought of a horse to the thought of a horseman, and thence to the thought of war, &c.; while a countryman will proceed from  the thought of a horse to the thought of a plough, a field, &c.  Thus every man will follow this or that train of thought, according as he has been in the habit of conjoining and  associating the mental images of things in this or that manner.  XIX.  The human mind has no knowledge of the body, and does not know it to exist, save  through the ideas of the modifications whereby the body is affected.  >>>>>Proof--The human mind is the very idea or knowledge of the human body (II. xiii.),  which (II. ix.) is in God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by another idea of a  particular thing actually existing:  or, inasmuch as (Post. iv.) the human body stands in  need of very many bodies whereby it is, as it were, continually regenerated; and the order  and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of causes (II. vii.); this  idea will therefore be in God, in so far as he is regarded as affected by the ideas of very  many particular things.  Thus God has the idea of the human body, or knows the human  body, in so far as he is affected by very many other ideas, and not in so far as he  constitutes the nature of the human mind; that is (by II. xi. Cor.), the human mind does not  know the human body.  But the ideas of the modifications of body are in God, in so far as he constitutes the nature of the human mind, or the human mind perceives those  modifications (II. xii.), and consequently (II. xvi.) the human body itself, and as actually  existing; therefore the mind perceives thus far only the human body.  Q.E.D.  XX. The idea or knowledge of the human mind is also in God, following in God in the  same manner, and being referred to God in the same manner, as the idea or knowledge of  the human body.  >>>>>Proof--Thought is an attribute of God (II. i.); therefore (II. iii.) there must  necessarily be in God the idea both of thought itself and of all its modifications,  consequently also of the human mind (II. xi.).  Further, this idea or knowledge of the mind  does not follow from God, in so far as he is infinite, but in so far as he is affected by  another idea of an individual thing (II. ix.).  But (II. vii.) the order and connection of ideas  is the same as the order and connection of causes; therefore this idea or knowledge of the  mind is in God and is referred to God, in the same manner as the idea or knowledge of the  body.  Q.E.D.  XXI. This idea of the mind is united to the mind in the same way as the mind is united to  the body.  >>>>>Proof--That the mind is united to the body we have shown from the fact, that the  body is the object of the mind (II. xii. and xiii.); and so for the same reason the idea of the  mind must be united with its object, that is, with the mind in the same manner as the mind  is united to the body.  Q.E.D.  *****Note--This proposition is comprehended much more clearly from what we have said  in the note to II. vii.  We there showed that the idea of body and body, that is, mind and  body (II. xiii.), are one and the same individual conceived now under the attribute of  thought, now under the attribute of extension; wherefore the idea of the mind and the mind  itself are one and the same thing, which is conceived under one and the same attribute,  namely, thought.  The idea of the mind, I repeat, and the mind itself are in God by the  same necessity and follow from him from the same power of thinking.  Strictly speaking,  the idea of the mind, that is, the idea of an idea, is nothing but the distinctive quality  (forma) of the idea in so far as it is conceived as a mode of thought without reference to  the object; if a man knows anything, he, by that very fact, knows that he knows it, and at  the same time knows that he knows that he knows it, and so on to infinity.  But I will treat  of this hereafter.  XXII. The human mind perceives not only the modifications of the body, but also the ideas  of such modifications.  >>>>>Proof--The ideas of the ideas of modifications follow in God in the same manner,  and are referred to God in the same manner, as the ideas of the said modifications.  This is  proved in the same way as II. xx.  But the ideas of the modifications of the body are in the  human mind (II. xii.), that is, in God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human  mind; therefore the ideas of these ideas will be in God, in so far as he has the knowledge  or idea of the human mind, that is (II. xxi.), they will be in the human mind itself, which  therefore perceives not only the modifications of the body, but also the ideas of such modifications.  Q.E.D.  XXIII. The mind does not know itself, except in so far as it perceives the ideas of the  modifications of the body.  >>>>>Proof--The idea or knowledge of the mind (II. xx.) follows in God in the same  manner, and is referred to God in the same manner, as the idea or knowledge of the  body.  But since (II. xix.) the human mind does not know the human body itself, that is  (II. xi. Cor.), since the knowledge of the human body is not referred to God, in so far as  he constitutes the nature of the human mind; therefore, neither is the knowledge of the  mind referred to God, in so far as he constitutes the essence of the human mind; therefore  (by the same Cor. II. xi.), the human mind thus far has no knowledge of itself.  Further the  ideas of the modifications, whereby the body is affected, involve the nature of the human  body itself (II. xvi.), that is (II. xiii.), they agree with the nature of the mind; wherefore the  knowledge of these ideas necessarily involves knowledge of the mind; but (by the last  Prop.) the knowledge of these ideas is in the human mind itself; wherefore the human mind  thus far only has knowledge of itself.  Q.E.D.  XXIV. The human mind does not involve an adequate knowledge of the parts composing  the human body.  >>>>>Proof--The parts composing the human body do not belong to the essence of that  body, except in so far as they communicate their motions to one another in a certain fixed  relation (Def. after Lemma iii.), not in so far as they can be regarded as individuals without  relation to the human body.  The parts of the human body are highly complex individuals  (Post. i.), whose parts (Lemma iv.) can be separated from the human body without in any  way destroying the nature and distinctive quality of the latter, and they can communicate  their"]]]
