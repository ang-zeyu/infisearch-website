You, sir, as I take it, are a mere strolling gentleman.”  I proceeded to inform the company, that, when Nature gave me a propensity to their way of life, she had not left me altogether destitute of qualifications for it; though I could not deny that my talent was less respectable, and might be less profitable, than the meanest of theirs.  My design, in short, was to imitate the storytellers of whom Oriental travellers have told us, and become an itinerant novelist, reciting my own extemporaneous fictions to such audiences as I could collect.  “Either this,” said I, “is my vocation, or I have been born in vain.”  The fortune-teller, with a sly wink to the company, proposed to take me as an apprentice to one or other of his professions, either of which, undoubtedly, would have given full scope to whatever inventive talent I might possess.  The bibliopolist spoke a few words in opposition to my plan, influenced partly, I suspect, by the jealousy of authorship, and partly by an apprehension that the _viva voce_ practice would become general among novelists, to the infinite detriment of the book-trade. Dreading a rejection, I solicited the interest of the merry damsel.  “Mirth,” cried I, most aptly appropriating the words of L’Allegro, “to thee I sue!  Mirth, admit me of thy crew!”  “Let us indulge the poor youth,” said Mirth, with a kindness which made me love her dearly, though I was no such coxcomb as to misinterpret her motives.  “I have espied much promise in him. True, a shadow sometimes flits across his brow, but the sunshine is sure to follow in a moment.  He is never guilty of a sad thought, but a merry one is twin born with it.  We will take him with us; and you shall see that he will set us all a-laughing before we reach the camp-meeting at Stamford.”  Her voice silenced the scruples of the rest, and gained me admittance into the league; according to the terms of which, without a community of goods or profits, we were to lend each other all the aid, and avert all the harm, that might be in our power.  This affair settled, a marvellous jollity entered into the whole tribe of us, manifesting itself characteristically in each individual.  The old showman, sitting down to his barrel-organ, stirred up the souls of the pygmy people with one of the quickest tunes in the music-book; tailors, blacksmiths, gentlemen, and ladies, all seemed to share in the spirit of the occasion; and the Merry-Andrew played his part more facetiously than ever, nodding and winking particularly at me.  The young foreigner flourished his fiddle-bow with a master’s hand, and gave an inspiring echo to the showman’s melody.  The bookish man and the merry damsel started up simultaneously to dance; the former enacting the double shuffle in a style which everybody must have witnessed, ere Election week was blotted out of time; while the girl, setting her arms akimbo with both hands at her slim waist, displayed such light rapidity of foot, and harmony of varying attitude and motion, that I could not conceive how she ever was to stop; imagining, at the moment, that Nature had made her, as the old showman had made his puppets, for no earthly purpose but to dance jigs.  The Indian bellowed forth a succession of most hideous outcries, somewhat afrighting us, till we interpreted them as the war-song, with which, in imitation of his ancestors, he was prefacing the assault on Stamford.  The conjurer, meanwhile, sat demurely in a corner, extracting a sly enjoyment from the whole scene, and, like the facetious Merry Andrew, directing his queer glance particularly at me.  As for myself, with great exhilaration of fancy, I began to arrange and color the incidents of a tale, wherewith I proposed to amuse an audience that very evening; for I saw that my associates were a little ashamed of me, and that no time was to be lost in obtaining a public acknowledgment of my abilities.  “Come, fellow-laborers,” at last said the old showman, whom we had elected President; “the shower is over, and we must be doing our duty by these poor souls at Stamford.”  “We’ll come among them in procession, with music and dancing,” cried the merry damsel.  Accordingly--for it must be understood that our pilgrimage was to be performed on foot--we sallied joyously out of the wagon, each of us, even the old gentleman in his white-top boots, giving a great skip as we came down the ladder.  Above our heads there was such a glory of sunshine and splendor of clouds, and such brightness of verdure below, that, as I modestly remarked at the time, Nature seemed to have washed her face, and put on the best of her jewelry and a fresh green gown, in honor of our confederation.  Casting our eyes northward, we beheld a horseman approaching leisurely, and splashing through the little puddles on the Stamford road.  Onward he came, sticking up in his saddle with rigid perpendicularity, a tall, thin figure in rusty black, whom the showman and the conjurer shortly recognized to be, what his aspect sufficiently indicated, a travelling preacher of great fame among the Methodists.  What puzzled us was the fact, that his face appeared turned from, instead of to, the camp-meeting at Stamford.  However, as this new votary of the wandering life drew near the little green space, where the guidepost and our wagon were situated, my six fellow-vagabonds and myself rushed forward and surrounded him, crying out with united voices,--  “What news, what news from the camp-meeting at Stamford?”  The missionary looked down, in surprise, at as singular a knot of people as could have been selected from all his heterogeneous auditors.  Indeed, considering that we might all be classified under the general head of Vagabond, there was great diversity of character among the grave old showman, the sly, prophetic beggar, the fiddling foreigner and his merry damsel, the smart bibliopolist, the sombre Indian, and myself, the itinerant novelist, a slender youth of eighteen.  I even fancied that a smile was endeavoring to disturb the iron gravity of the preacher’s mouth.  “Good people,” answered he, “the camp-meeting is broke up.”  So saying, the Methodist minister switched his steed, and rode westward.  Our union being thus nullified, by the removal of its object, we were sundered at once to the four winds of heaven. The fortune-teller, giving a nod to all, and a peculiar wink to me, departed on his northern tour, chuckling within himself as he took the Stamford road.  The old showman and his literary coadjutor were already tackling their horses to the wagon, with a design to peregrinate southwest along the seacoast.  The foreigner and the merry damsel took their laughing leave, and pursued the eastern road, which I had that day trodden; as they passed away, the young man played a lively strain, and the girl’s happy spirit broke into a dance; and thus, dissolving, as it were, into sunbeams and gay music, that pleasant pair departed from my view.  Finally, with a pensive shadow thrown across my mind, yet emulous of the light philosophy of my late companions, I joined myself to the Penobscot Indian, and set forth towards the distant city."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/9214"],["title","The White Old Maid (From \"Twice Told Tales\") (#0)"],["body","TOLD TALES                         THE WHITE OLD MAID                       By Nathaniel Hawthorne    The moonbeams came through two deep and narrow windows, and showed a spacious chamber, richly furnished in an antique fashion.  From one lattice, the shadow of the diamond panes was thrown upon the floor; the ghostly light, through the other, slept upon a bed, falling between the heavy silken curtains, and illuminating the face of a young man.  But, how quietly the slumberer lay! how pale his features! and how like a shroud the sheet was wound about his frame!  Yes; it was a corpse, in its burial-clothes.  Suddenly, the fixed features seemed to move, with dark emotion. Strange fantasy!  It was but the shadow of the fringed curtain, waving betwixt the dead face and the moonlight, as the door of the chamber opened, and a girl stole softly to the bedside.  Was there delusion in the moonbeams, or did her gesture and her eye betray a gleam of triumph, as she bent over the pale corpse-pale as itself--and pressed her living lips to the cold ones of the dead?  As she drew back from that long kiss, her features writhed, as if a proud heart were fighting with its anguish. Again it seemed that the features of the corpse had moved responsive to her own.  Still an illusion!  The silken curtain had waved, a second time, betwixt the dead face and the moonlight, as another fair young girl unclosed the door, and glided, ghost-like, to the bedside.  There the two maidens stood, both beautiful, with the pale beauty of the dead between them. But she, who had first entered, was proud and stately; and the other, a soft and fragile thing.  “Away!” cried the lofty one.   “Thou hadst him living!  The dead is mine!”  “Thine!” returned the other, shuddering.   “Well hast thou spoken! The dead is thine!”  The proud girl started, and stared into her face, with a ghastly look. But a wild and mournful expression passed across the features of the gentle one; and, weak and helpless, she sank down on the bed, her head pillowed beside that of the corpse, and her hair mingling with his dark locks.  A creature of hope and joy, the first draught of sorrow had bewildered her.  “Edith!” cried her rival.  Edith groaned, as with a sudden compression of the heart; and removing her cheek from the dead youth’s pillow, she stood upright, fearfully encountering the eyes of the lofty girl.  “Wilt thou betray me?” said the latter, calmly.  “Till the dead bid me speak, I will be silent,” answered Edith. “Leave us alone together!  Go, and live many years, and then return, and tell me of thy life.  He, too, will be here!  Then, if thou tellest of sufferings more than death, we will both forgive thee.”  “And what shall be the token?” asked the proud girl, as if her heart acknowledged a meaning in these wild words.  “This lock of hair,” said Edith, lifting one of the dark, clustering curls, that lay heavily on the dead man’s brow.  The two maidens joined their hands over the bosom of the corpse, and appointed a day and hour, far, far in time to come, for their next meeting in that chamber.  The statelier girl gave one deep look at the motionless countenance, and departed,--yet turned again and trembled, ere she closed the door, almost believing that her dead lover frowned upon her.  And Edith, too!  Was not her white form fading into the moonlight?  Scorning her own weakness, she went forth, and perceived that a negro slave was waiting in the passage, with a wax light, which he held between her face and his own, and regarded her, as she thought, with an ugly expression of merriment.  Lifting his torch on high, the slave lighted her down the staircase, and undid the portal of the mansion.  The young clergyman of the town had just ascended the steps, and bowing to the lady, passed in without a word.   Years, many years rolled on; the world seemed new again, so much older was it grown, since the night when those pale girls had clasped their hands across the bosom of the corpse.  In the interval, a lonely woman had passed from youth to extreme age, and was known by all the town, as the  “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  A taint of insanity had affected her whole life, but so quiet, sad, and gentle, so utterly free from violence, that she was suffered to pursue her harmless fantasies, unmolested by the world, with whose business or pleasures she had naught to do.  She dwelt alone, and never came into the daylight, except to follow funerals.  Whenever a corpse was borne along the street, in sunshine, rain, or snow, whether a pompous train, of the rich and proud, thronged after it, or few and humble were the mourners, behind them came the lonely woman, in a long, white garment, which the people called her shroud.  She took no place among the kindred or the friends, but stood at the door to hear the funeral prayer, and walked in the rear of the procession, as one whose earthly charge it was to haunt the house of mourning, and be the shadow of affliction, and see that the dead were duly buried.  So long had this been her custom, that the inhabitants of the town deemed her a part of every funeral, as much as the coffin pall, or the very corpse itself, and augured ill of the sinner’s destiny, unless the  “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet” came gliding, like a ghost, behind.  Once, it is said, she affrighted a bridal party, with her pale presence, appearing suddenly in the illuminated hall, just as the priest was uniting a false maid to a wealthy man, before her lover had been dead a year. Evil was the omen to that marriage!  Sometimes she stole forth by moonlight, and visited the graves of venerable Integrity, and wedded Love, and virgin Innocence, and every spot where the ashes of a kind and faithful heart were mouldering. Over the hillocks of those favored dead would she stretch out her arms, with a gesture, as if she were scattering seeds; and many believed that she brought them from the garden of Paradise; for the graves, which she had visited, were green beneath the snow, and covered with sweet flowers from April to November.  Her blessing was better than a holy verse upon the tombstone.  Thus wore away her long, sad, peaceful, and fantastic life, till few were so old as she, and the people of later generations wondered how the dead had ever been buried, or mourners had endured their grief, without the  “Old Maid in the Winding Sheet.”  Still, years went on, and still she followed funerals, and was not yet summoned to her own festival of death.  One afternoon, the great street of the town was all alive with business and bustle, though the sun now gilded only the upper half of the church-spire, having left the housetops and loftiest trees in shadow.  The scene was cheerful and animated, in spite of the sombre shade between the high brick buildings.  Here were pompous merchants, in white wigs and laced velvet; the bronzed faces of sea-captains; the foreign garb and air of Spanish creoles; and the disdainful port of natives of Old England; all contrasted with the rough aspect of one or two hack settlers, negotiating sales of timber, from forests where axe had never sounded. Sometimes a lady passed, swelling roundly forth in an embroidered petticoat, balancing her steps in high-heeled shoes, and courtesying, with lofty grace, to the punctilious obeisances of the gentlemen.  The life of the town seemed to have its very centre not far from an old mansion, that stood somewhat back from the pavement, surrounded by neglected grass, with a strange air of loneliness, rather deepened than dispelled by the throng so near it.  Its site would have been suitably occupied by a magnificent Exchange, or a brick block, lettered all over with various signs; or the large house itself might have made a noble tavern, with the  “King’s Arms” swinging before it, and guests in every chamber, instead of the present solitude.  But, owing to some dispute about the right of inheritance, the mansion had been long without a tenant, decaying from year to year, and throwing the stately gloom of its shadow over the busiest part of the town. Such was the scene, and such the time, when a figure, unlike any that have been described, was observed at a distance down the street.  “I espy a strange sail, yonder,” remarked a Liverpool captain; “that woman in the long, white garment!”  The sailor seemed much struck by the object, as were several others, who, at the same moment, caught a glimpse of the figure that had attracted his notice.  Almost immediately, the various topics of conversation gave place to speculations, in an undertone, on this unwonted occurrence.  “Can there be a funeral, so late this afternoon?”  inquired some.  They looked for the signs of death at every door,--the sexton, the hearse, the assemblage of black-clad relatives,--all that makes up the woeful pomp of funerals.  They raised their eyes, also, to the sun-gilt spire of the church, and wondered that no clang proceeded from its bell, which had always tolled till now, when this figure appeared in the light of day.  But none had heard that a corpse was to be borne to its home that afternoon, nor was there any token of a funeral, except the apparition of the “Old Maid in the Winding-Sheet.”  “What may this portend?” asked each man of his neighbor.  All smiled as they put the question, yet with a certain trouble in their eyes, as if pestilence, or some other wide calamity, were prognosticated by the untimely intrusion among the living, of one whose presence had always been associated with death and woe.  What a comet is to the earth, was that sad woman to the town.  Still she moved on, while the hum of surprise was hushed at her approach, and the proud and the humble stood aside, that her white garment might not wave against them.  It was a long, loose robe, of spotless purity. Its wearer appeared very old, pale, emaciated, and feeble, yet glided onward, without the unsteady pace of extreme age.
