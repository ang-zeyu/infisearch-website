He slipped through, and found himself in a splendid hall, far more splendid, he feared, than the forest, there was so much more gilding everywhere, and even the floor was made of great coloured stones, fitted together into a sort of geometrical pattern.  But the little Infanta was not there, only some wonderful white statues that looked down on him from their jasper pedestals, with sad blank eyes and strangely smiling lips.  At the end of the hall hung a richly embroidered curtain of black velvet, powdered with suns and stars, the King’s favourite devices, and broidered on the colour he loved best.  Perhaps she was hiding behind that?  He would try at any rate.  So he stole quietly across, and drew it aside.  No; there was only another room, though a prettier room, he thought, than the one he had just left.  The walls were hung with a many-figured green arras of needle-wrought tapestry representing a hunt, the work of some Flemish artists who had spent more than seven years in its composition.  It had once been the chamber of _Jean le Fou_, as he was called, that mad King who was so enamoured of the chase, that he had often tried in his delirium to mount the huge rearing horses, and to drag down the stag on which the great hounds were leaping, sounding his hunting horn, and stabbing with his dagger at the pale flying deer.  It was now used as the council-room, and on the centre table were lying the red portfolios of the ministers, stamped with the gold tulips of Spain, and with the arms and emblems of the house of Hapsburg.  The little Dwarf looked in wonder all round him, and was half-afraid to go on.  The strange silent horsemen that galloped so swiftly through the long glades without making any noise, seemed to him like those terrible phantoms of whom he had heard the charcoal-burners speaking—the Comprachos, who hunt only at night, and if they meet a man, turn him into a hind, and chase him.  But he thought of the pretty Infanta, and took courage.  He wanted to find her alone, and to tell her that he too loved her.  Perhaps she was in the room beyond.  He ran across the soft Moorish carpets, and opened the door.  No!  She was not here either.  The room was quite empty.  It was a throne-room, used for the reception of foreign ambassadors, when the King, which of late had not been often, consented to give them a personal audience; the same room in which, many years before, envoys had appeared from England to make arrangements for the marriage of their Queen, then one of the Catholic sovereigns of Europe, with the Emperor’s eldest son.  The hangings were of gilt Cordovan leather, and a heavy gilt chandelier with branches for three hundred wax lights hung down from the black and white ceiling.  Underneath a great canopy of gold cloth, on which the lions and towers of Castile were broidered in seed pearls, stood the throne itself, covered with a rich pall of black velvet studded with silver tulips and elaborately fringed with silver and pearls.  On the second step of the throne was placed the kneeling-stool of the Infanta, with its cushion of cloth of silver tissue, and below that again, and beyond the limit of the canopy, stood the chair for the Papal Nuncio, who alone had the right to be seated in the King’s presence on the occasion of any public ceremonial, and whose Cardinal’s hat, with its tangled scarlet tassels, lay on a purple _tabouret_ in front.  On the wall, facing the throne, hung a life-sized portrait of Charles V. in hunting dress, with a great mastiff by his side, and a picture of Philip II. receiving the homage of the Netherlands occupied the centre of the other wall.  Between the windows stood a black ebony cabinet, inlaid with plates of ivory, on which the figures from Holbein’s Dance of Death had been graved—by the hand, some said, of that famous master himself.  But the little Dwarf cared nothing for all this magnificence.  He would not have given his rose for all the pearls on the canopy, nor one white petal of his rose for the throne itself.  What he wanted was to see the Infanta before she went down to the pavilion, and to ask her to come away with him when he had finished his dance.  Here, in the Palace, the air was close and heavy, but in the forest the wind blew free, and the sunlight with wandering hands of gold moved the tremulous leaves aside. There were flowers, too, in the forest, not so splendid, perhaps, as the flowers in the garden, but more sweetly scented for all that; hyacinths in early spring that flooded with waving purple the cool glens, and grassy knolls; yellow primroses that nestled in little clumps round the gnarled roots of the oak-trees; bright celandine, and blue speedwell, and irises lilac and gold.  There were grey catkins on the hazels, and the foxgloves drooped with the weight of their dappled bee-haunted cells. The chestnut had its spires of white stars, and the hawthorn its pallid moons of beauty.  Yes: surely she would come if he could only find her! She would come with him to the fair forest, and all day long he would dance for her delight.  A smile lit up his eyes at the thought, and he passed into the next room.  Of all the rooms this was the brightest and the most beautiful.  The walls were covered with a pink-flowered Lucca damask, patterned with birds and dotted with dainty blossoms of silver; the furniture was of massive silver, festooned with florid wreaths, and swinging Cupids; in front of the two large fire-places stood great screens broidered with parrots and peacocks, and the floor, which was of sea-green onyx, seemed to stretch far away into the distance.  Nor was he alone.  Standing under the shadow of the doorway, at the extreme end of the room, he saw a little figure watching him.  His heart trembled, a cry of joy broke from his lips, and he moved out into the sunlight.  As he did so, the figure moved out also, and he saw it plainly.  The Infanta!  It was a monster, the most grotesque monster he had ever beheld.  Not properly shaped, as all other people were, but hunchbacked, and crooked-limbed, with huge lolling head and mane of black hair.  The little Dwarf frowned, and the monster frowned also.  He laughed, and it laughed with him, and held its hands to its sides, just as he himself was doing.  He made it a mocking bow, and it returned him a low reverence. He went towards it, and it came to meet him, copying each step that he made, and stopping when he stopped himself.  He shouted with amusement, and ran forward, and reached out his hand, and the hand of the monster touched his, and it was as cold as ice.  He grew afraid, and moved his hand across, and the monster’s hand followed it quickly.  He tried to press on, but something smooth and hard stopped him.  The face of the monster was now close to his own, and seemed full of terror.  He brushed his hair off his eyes.  It imitated him.  He struck at it, and it returned blow for blow.  He loathed it, and it made hideous faces at him. He drew back, and it retreated.  What is it?  He thought for a moment, and looked round at the rest of the room.  It was strange, but everything seemed to have its double in this invisible wall of clear water.  Yes, picture for picture was repeated, and couch for couch.  The sleeping Faun that lay in the alcove by the doorway had its twin brother that slumbered, and the silver Venus that stood in the sunlight held out her arms to a Venus as lovely as herself.  Was it Echo?  He had called to her once in the valley, and she had answered him word for word.  Could she mock the eye, as she mocked the voice?  Could she make a mimic world just like the real world?  Could the shadows of things have colour and life and movement?  Could it be that—?  He started, and taking from his breast the beautiful white rose, he turned round, and kissed it.  The monster had a rose of its own, petal for petal the same!  It kissed it with like kisses, and pressed it to its heart with horrible gestures.  When the truth dawned upon him, he gave a wild cry of despair, and fell sobbing to the ground.  So it was he who was misshapen and hunchbacked, foul to look at and grotesque.  He himself was the monster, and it was at him that all the children had been laughing, and the little Princess who he had thought loved him—she too had been merely mocking at his ugliness, and making merry over his twisted limbs.  Why had they not left him in the forest, where there was no mirror to tell him how loathsome he was? Why had his father not killed him, rather than sell him to his shame? The hot tears poured down his cheeks, and he tore the white rose to pieces.  The sprawling monster did the same, and scattered the faint petals in the air.  It grovelled on the ground, and, when he looked at it, it watched him with a face drawn with pain.  He crept away, lest he should see it, and covered his eyes with his hands.  He crawled, like some wounded thing, into the shadow, and lay there moaning.  And at that moment the Infanta herself came in with her companions through the open window, and when they saw the ugly little dwarf lying on the ground and beating the floor with his clenched hands, in the most fantastic and exaggerated manner, they went off into shouts of happy laughter, and stood all round him and watched him.  ‘His dancing was funny,’ said the Infanta; ‘but his acting is funnier still.  Indeed he is almost as good as the puppets, only of course not quite so natural.’  And she fluttered her big fan, and applauded.  But the little Dwarf never looked up, and his sobs grew fainter and fainter, and suddenly he gave a curious gasp, and clutched his side.  And then he fell back again, and lay quite still.  ‘That is capital,’ said the Infanta, after a pause; ‘but now you must dance for me.’  ‘Yes,’ cried all the children, ‘you must get up and dance, for you are as clever as the Barbary apes, and much"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/873"],["title","A House of Pomegranates (#7)"],["body","ridiculous.’  But the little Dwarf made no answer.  And the Infanta stamped her foot, and called out to her uncle, who was walking on the terrace with the Chamberlain, reading some despatches that had just arrived from Mexico, where the Holy Office had recently been established.  ‘My funny little dwarf is sulking,’ she cried, ‘you must wake him up, and tell him to dance for me.’  They smiled at each other, and sauntered in, and Don Pedro stooped down, and slapped the Dwarf on the cheek with his embroidered glove.  ‘You must dance,’ he said, ‘_petit monsire_.  You must dance.  The Infanta of Spain and the Indies wishes to be amused.’  But the little Dwarf never moved.  ‘A whipping master should be sent for,’ said Don Pedro wearily, and he went back to the terrace.  But the Chamberlain looked grave, and he knelt beside the little dwarf, and put his hand upon his heart.  And after a few moments he shrugged his shoulders, and rose up, and having made a low bow to the Infanta, he said—  ‘_Mi bella Princesa_, your funny little dwarf will never dance again.  It is a pity, for he is so ugly that he might have made the King smile.’  ‘But why will he not dance again?’ asked the Infanta, laughing.  ‘Because his heart is broken,’ answered the Chamberlain.  And the Infanta frowned, and her dainty rose-leaf lips curled in pretty disdain.  ‘For the future let those who come to play with me have no hearts,’ she cried, and she ran out into the garden.     THE FISHERMAN AND HIS SOUL                                   TO H.S.H.                              ALICE, PRINCESS                                 OF MONACO  EVERY evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and threw his nets into the water.  When the wind blew from the land he caught nothing, or but little at best, for it was a bitter and black-winged wind, and rough waves rose up to meet it.  But when the wind blew to the shore, the fish came in from the deep, and swam into the meshes of his nets, and he took them to the market-place and sold them.  Every evening he went out upon the sea, and one evening the net was so heavy that hardly could he draw it into the boat.  And he laughed, and said to himself, ‘Surely I have caught all the fish that swim, or snared some dull monster that will be a marvel to men, or some thing of horror that the great Queen will desire,’ and putting forth all his strength, he tugged at the coarse ropes till, like lines of blue enamel round a vase of bronze, the long veins rose up on his arms.  He tugged at the thin ropes, and nearer and nearer came the circle of flat corks, and the net rose at last to the top of the water.  But no fish at all was in it, nor any monster or thing of horror, but only a little Mermaid lying fast asleep.  Her hair was as a wet fleece of gold, and each separate hair as a thread of fine gold in a cup of glass.  Her body was as white ivory, and her tail was of silver and pearl.  Silver and pearl was her tail, and the green weeds of the sea coiled round it; and like sea-shells were her ears, and her lips were like sea-coral.  The cold waves dashed over her cold breasts, and the salt glistened upon her eyelids.  So beautiful was she that when the young Fisherman saw her he was filled with wonder, and he put out his hand and drew the net close to him, and leaning over the side he clasped her in his arms.  And when he touched her, she gave a cry like a startled sea-gull, and woke, and looked at him in terror with her mauve-amethyst eyes, and struggled that she might escape.  But he held her tightly to him, and would not suffer her to depart.  And when she saw that she could in no way escape from him, she began to weep, and said, ‘I pray thee let me go, for I am the only daughter of a King, and my father is aged and alone.’  But the young Fisherman answered, ‘I will not let thee go save thou makest me a promise that whenever I call thee, thou wilt come and sing to me, for the fish delight to listen to the song of the Sea-folk, and so shall my nets be full.’  ‘Wilt thou in very truth let me go, if I promise thee this?’ cried the Mermaid.  ‘In very truth I will let thee go,’ said the young Fisherman.  So she made him the promise he desired, and sware it by the oath of the Sea-folk.  And he loosened his arms from about her, and she sank down into the water, trembling with a strange fear.                                  * * * * *  Every evening the young Fisherman went out upon the sea, and called to the Mermaid, and she rose out of the water and sang to him.  Round and round her swam the dolphins, and the wild gulls wheeled above her head.  And she sang a marvellous song.  For she sang of the Sea-folk who drive their flocks from cave to cave, and carry the little calves on their shoulders; of the Tritons who have long green beards, and hairy breasts, and blow through twisted conchs when the King passes by; of the palace of the King which is all of amber, with a roof of clear emerald, and a pavement of bright pearl; and of the gardens of the sea where the great filigrane fans of coral wave all day long, and the fish dart about like silver birds, and the anemones cling to the rocks, and the pinks bourgeon in the ribbed yellow sand.  She sang of the big whales that come down from the north seas and have sharp icicles hanging to their fins; of the Sirens who tell of such wonderful things that the merchants have to stop their ears with wax lest they should hear them, and leap into the water and be drowned; of the sunken galleys with their tall masts, and the frozen sailors clinging to the rigging, and the mackerel swimming in and out of the open portholes; of the little barnacles who are great travellers, and cling to the keels of the ships and go round and round the world; and of the cuttlefish who live in the sides of the cliffs and stretch out their long black arms, and can make night come when they will it.  She sang of the nautilus who has a boat of her own that is carved out of an opal and steered with a silken sail; of the happy Mermen who play upon harps and can charm the great Kraken to sleep; of the little children who catch hold of the slippery porpoises and ride laughing upon their backs; of the Mermaids who lie in the white foam and hold out their arms to the mariners; and of the sea-lions with their curved tusks, and the sea-horses with their floating manes.  And as she sang, all the tunny-fish came in from the deep to listen to her, and the young Fisherman threw his nets round them and caught them, and others he took with a spear.  And when his boat was well-laden, the Mermaid would sink down into the sea, smiling at him.  Yet would she never come near him that he might touch her.  Oftentimes he called to her and prayed of her, but she would not; and when he sought to seize her she dived into the water as a seal might dive, nor did he see her again that day.  And each day the sound of her voice became sweeter to his ears.  So sweet was her voice that he forgot his nets and his cunning, and had no care of his craft.  Vermilion-finned and with eyes of bossy gold, the tunnies went by in shoals, but he heeded them not.  His spear lay by his side unused, and his baskets of plaited osier were empty.  With lips parted, and eyes dim with wonder, he sat idle in his boat and listened, listening till the sea-mists crept round him, and the wandering moon stained his brown limbs with silver.  And one evening he called to her, and said: ‘Little Mermaid, little Mermaid, I love thee.  Take me for thy bridegroom, for I love thee.’  But the Mermaid shook her head.  ‘Thou hast a human soul,’ she answered. ‘If only thou wouldst send away thy soul, then could I love thee.’  And the young Fisherman said to himself, ‘Of what use is my soul to me? I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.  Surely I will send it away from me, and much gladness shall be mine.’  And a cry of joy broke from his lips, and standing up in the painted boat, he held out his arms to the Mermaid.  ‘I will send my soul away,’ he cried, ‘and you shall be my bride, and I will be thy bridegroom, and in the depth of the sea we will dwell together, and all that thou hast sung of thou shalt show me, and all that thou desirest I will do, nor shall our lives be divided.’  And the little Mermaid laughed for pleasure and hid her face in her hands.  ‘But how shall I send my soul from me?’ cried the young Fisherman.  ‘Tell me how I may do it, and lo! it shall be done.’  ‘Alas!  I know not,’ said the little Mermaid: ‘the Sea-folk have no souls.’  And she sank down into the deep, looking wistfully at him.                                  * * * * *  Now early on the next morning, before the sun was the span of a man’s hand above the hill, the young Fisherman went to the house of the Priest and knocked three times at the door.  The novice looked out through the wicket, and when he saw who it was, he drew back the latch and said to him, ‘Enter.’  And the young Fisherman passed in, and knelt down on the sweet-smelling rushes of the floor, and cried to the Priest who was reading out of the Holy Book and said to him, ‘Father, I am in love with one of the Sea-folk, and my soul hindereth me from having my desire.  Tell me how I can send my soul away from me, for in truth I have no need of it.  Of what value is my soul to me?  I cannot see it.  I may not touch it.  I do not know it.’  And the Priest beat his breast, and answered, ‘Alack, alack, thou art mad, or hast eaten of some poisonous herb, for the soul is the noblest part of man, and was given to us by God that we should nobly use it. There is no thing more precious than a human soul, nor any earthly thing that can be weighed with it.  It is worth all the gold that is in the world, and is more precious than the rubies of the kings.  Therefore, my son, think not any more of this matter, for it is a sin that may not be forgiven.  And as for the Sea-folk, they are lost, and they who would traffic with them are"]]]
