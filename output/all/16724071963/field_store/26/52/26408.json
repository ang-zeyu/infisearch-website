S. Senate all bills, joint resolutions and treaties, upon their second reading are considered “as if the Senate were in committee of the whole,” which is equivalent to considering them informally. [U. S. Senate Rules 28 and 38.] In large assemblies it is better to follow the practice of the House of Representatives, and go into committee of the whole.] While acting informally upon any resolutions, the assembly can only amend and adopt them, and without further motion the Chairman announces that “the assembly acting informally [or as in committee of the whole] has had such a subject under consideration, and has made certain amendments, which he will report.” The subject comes before the assembly then as if reported by a committee. While acting informally, the Chairman retains his seat, as it is not necessary to move that the committee rise, but at any time the adoption of such motions as to adjourn, the previous question, to commit, or any motion except to amend or adopt, puts an end to the informal consideration; as for example, the motion to commit is equivalent to the following motions when in committee of the whole: (1) That the committee rise; (2) that the committee of the whole be discharged from the further consideration of the subject, and (3) that it be referred to a committee.  While acting informally, every member can speak as many times as he pleases, and as long each time as permitted in the assembly [§ 34], and the informal action may be rejected or altered by the assembly. While the clerk should keep a memorandum of the informal proceedings, it should not be entered on the minutes, being only for temporary use. The Chairman’s report to the assembly of the informal action, should be entered on the minutes, as it belongs to the assembly’s proceedings.  Art. V. Debate and Decorum. [§§ 34-37.]  34. Debate.* [In connection with this section read §§ 1-5.] When a motion is made and seconded, it shall be stated by the Chairman before being debated [see § 3]. When any member is about to speak in debate, he shall rise and respectfully address himself to “Mr. Chairman.” [“Mr. President” is used where that is the designated title of the presiding officer; “Brother Moderator” is more common in religious meetings.] The Chairman shall then announce his name [see § 2]. By parliamentary courtesy, the member upon whose motion a subject is brought before the assembly is first entitled to the floor, even though another member has risen first and addressed the Chair; [in case of a report of a committee, it is the member who presents the report] ; and this member is also entitled to close the debate, but not until every member choosing to speak, has spoken. This right to make the last speech upon the question, is not taken away by the Previous Question [§ 20] being ordered, or in any other way. With this exception, no member shall speak more than twice to the same question (only once to a question of order, § 14), nor longer than ten minutes at one time, without leave of the assembly, and the question upon granting the leave shall be decided by a majority vote without debate.* [The limit in time should vary to suit circumstances, but the limit of two speeches of ten minutes each will usually answer in ordinary assemblies, and it can be increased, when desirable, by a majority vote as shown above, or diminished as shown in § 37. In the U. S. House of Representatives no member can speak more than once to the same question, nor longer than one hour. The fourth rule of the Senate is as follows: “No Senator shall speak more than twice in any one debate on the same day, without leave of the Senate, which question shall be decided without debate.” If no rule is adopted, each member can speak but once to the same question.]  If greater freedom is desired, the proper course is to refer the subject to the committee of the whole [§ 32], or to consider it informally [§ 33]. [For limiting or closing the debate, see § 37.] No member can speak the second time to a question, until every member choosing to speak has spoken. But an amendment, or any other motion being offered, makes the real question before the assembly a different one, and, in regard to the right to debate, is treated as a new question. Merely asking a question, or making a suggestion, is not considered as speaking.  35. Undebatable Questions. The following questions shall be decided without debate, all others being debatable [see note at end of this section]:  —To Fix the Time to which the Assembly shall Adjourn (when a privileged question, § 10). —To Adjourn [§ 11], (or in committee, to rise, which is used instead of to adjourn). —For the Orders of the Day [§ 13], and questions relating to the priority of business. —An Appeal [§ 14] when made while the Previous Question is pending, or when simply relating to indecorum or transgressions of the rules of speaking, or to the priority of business. —Objection to the Consideration of a Question [§ 15]. —Questions relating to Reading of Papers [§ 16], or Withdrawing a Motion [§ 17], or Suspending the Rules [§ 18], or extending the limits of debate [§ 34], or limiting or closing debate, or granting leave to continue his speech to one who has been guilty of indecorum in debate [§ 36]. —To Lie on the Table or to Take from the Table [§ 19]. —The Previous Question [§ 20]. —To Reconsider [§ 26] a question which is itself undebatable.  The motion to Postpone to a certain time [§ 21] allows of but very limited debate, which must be confined to the propriety of the postponement; but to Reconsider a debatable question [§ 26], or to Commit [§ 22], or Indefinitely Postpone [§ 24], opens the main question [§ 6] to debate. To Amend [§ 23] opens the main question to debate only so far as it is necessarily involved in the amendment.  The distinction between debate and making suggestions or asking a question, should always be kept in view, and when the latter will assist the assembly in determining the question, is allowed to a limited extent, even though the question before the assembly is undebatable.  Note On Undebatable Questions.—The English common parliamentary law makes all motions debatable, without there is a rule adopted limiting debate [Cushing’s Manual, § 330]; but every assembly is obliged to restrict debate upon certain motions. The restrictions to debate prescribed in this section conform to the practice of Congress, where, however, it is very common to allow of brief remarks upon the most undebatable questions, sometimes five or six members speaking; this of course is allowed only when no one objects.  By examining the above list, it will be found, that, while free debate is allowed upon every principal question [§ 6], it is permitted or prohibited upon other questions in accordance with the following principles:  (a) Highly privileged questions, as a rule, should not be debated, as in that case they could be used to prevent the assembly from coming to a vote on the main question; (for instance, if the motion to adjourn were debatable, it could be used [see § 11] in a way to greatly hinder business). High privilege is, as a rule, incompatible with the right of debate on the privileged question.  (b) A motion that has the effect to suppress a question before the assembly, so that it cannot again be taken up that session [§ 42], allows of free debate. And a subsidiary motion [§ 7, except commit, which see below,] is debatable to just the extent that it interferes with the right of the assembly to take up the original question at its pleasure.  Illustrations: To “Indefinitely Postpone” [§ 24] a question, places it out of the power of the assembly to again take it up during that session, and consequently this motion allows of free debate, even involving the whole merits of the original question.  To “Postpone to a certain time” prevents the assembly taking up the question till the specified time, and therefore allows of limited debate upon the propriety of the postponement.  To “Lie on the Table” leaves the question so that the assembly can at any time consider it, and therefore should not be, and is not debatable.  To “Commit” would not be very debatable, according to this rule, but it is an exception, because it is often important that the committee should know the views of the assembly on the question, and it therefore is not only debatable, but opens to debate the whole question which it is proposed to refer to the committee.  36. Decorum in Debate [see § 2]. In debate a member must confine himself to the question before the assembly, and avoid personalities. He cannot reflect upon any act of the assembly, unless he intends to conclude his remarks with a motion to rescind such action, or else while debating such motion. In referring to another member, he should, as much as possible, avoid using his name, rather referring to him as “the member who spoke last,” or in some other way describing him. The officers of the assembly should always be referred to by their official titles. It is not allowable to arraign the motives of a member, but the nature or consequences of a measure may be condemned in strong terms. It is not the man, but the measure, that is the subject of debate. If at any time the Chairman rises to state a point of order, or give information, or otherwise speak, within his privilege [see § 40], the member speaking must take his seat till the Chairman has been first heard. When called to order, the member must sit down until the question of order is decided. If his remarks are decided to be improper, he cannot proceed, if any one objects, without the leave of the assembly expressed by a vote, upon which question there shall be no debate.  Disorderly words should be taken down by the member who objects to them,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/910"],["title","White Fang (#0)"],["body","[Illustration]     WHITE FANG  by Jack London   Contents   PART I  CHAPTER I THE TRAIL OF THE MEAT  CHAPTER II THE SHE-WOLF  CHAPTER III THE HUNGER CRY   PART II  CHAPTER I THE BATTLE OF THE FANGS  CHAPTER II THE LAIR  CHAPTER III THE GREY CUB  CHAPTER IV THE WALL OF THE WORLD  CHAPTER V THE LAW OF MEAT   PART III  CHAPTER I THE MAKERS OF FIRE  CHAPTER II THE BONDAGE  CHAPTER III THE OUTCAST  CHAPTER IV THE TRAIL OF THE GODS  CHAPTER V THE COVENANT  CHAPTER VI THE FAMINE   PART IV  CHAPTER I THE ENEMY OF HIS KIND  CHAPTER II THE MAD GOD  CHAPTER III THE REIGN OF HATE  CHAPTER IV THE CLINGING DEATH  CHAPTER V THE INDOMITABLE  CHAPTER VI THE LOVE-MASTER   PART V  CHAPTER I THE LONG TRAIL  CHAPTER II THE SOUTHLAND  CHAPTER III THE GOD’S DOMAIN  CHAPTER IV THE CALL OF KIND  CHAPTER V THE SLEEPING WOLF     PART I     CHAPTER I THE TRAIL OF THE MEAT   Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness—a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild.  But there _was_ life, abroad in the land and defiant. Down the frozen waterway toiled a string of wolfish dogs. Their bristly fur was rimed with frost. Their breath froze in the air as it left their mouths, spouting forth in spumes of vapour that settled upon the hair of their bodies and formed into crystals of frost. Leather harness was on the dogs, and leather traces attached them to a sled which dragged along behind. The sled was without runners. It was made of stout birch-bark, and its full surface rested on the snow. The front end of the sled was turned up, like a scroll, in order to force down and under the bore of soft snow that surged like a wave before it. On the sled, securely lashed, was a long and narrow oblong box. There were other things on the sled—blankets, an axe, and a coffee-pot and frying-pan; but prominent, occupying most of the space, was the long and narrow oblong box.  In advance of the dogs, on wide snowshoes, toiled a man. At the rear of the sled toiled a second man. On the sled, in the box, lay a third man whose toil was over,—a man whom the Wild had conquered and beaten down until he would never move nor struggle again. It is not the way of the Wild to like movement. Life is an offence to it, for life is movement; and the Wild aims always to destroy movement. It freezes the water to prevent it running to the sea; it drives the sap out of the trees till they are frozen to their mighty hearts; and most ferociously and terribly of all does the Wild harry and crush into submission man—man who is the most restless of life, ever in revolt against the dictum that all movement must in the end come to the cessation of movement.  But at front and rear, unawed and indomitable, toiled the two men who were not yet dead. Their bodies were covered with fur and soft-tanned leather. Eyelashes and cheeks and lips were so coated with the crystals from their frozen breath that their faces were not discernible. This gave them the seeming of ghostly masques, undertakers in a spectral world at the funeral of some ghost. But under it all they were men, penetrating the land of desolation and mockery and silence, puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space.  They travelled on without speech, saving their breath for the work of their bodies. On every side was the silence, pressing upon them with a tangible presence. It affected their minds as the many atmospheres of deep water affect the body of the diver. It crushed them with the weight of unending vastness and unalterable decree. It crushed them into the remotest recesses of their own minds, pressing out of them, like juices from the grape, all the false ardours and exaltations and undue self-values of the human soul, until they perceived themselves finite and small, specks and motes, moving with weak cunning and little wisdom amidst the play and inter-play of the great blind elements and forces.  An hour went by, and a second hour. The pale light of the short sunless day was beginning to fade, when a faint far cry arose on the still air. It soared upward with a swift rush, till it reached its topmost note, where it persisted, palpitant and tense, and then slowly died away. It might have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness. The front man turned his head until his eyes met the eyes of the man behind. And then, across the narrow oblong box, each nodded to the other.  A second cry arose, piercing the silence with needle-like shrillness. Both men located the sound. It was to the rear, somewhere in the snow expanse they had just traversed. A third and answering cry arose, also to the rear and to the left of the second cry.  “They’re after us, Bill,” said the man at the front.  His voice sounded hoarse and unreal, and he had spoken with apparent effort.  “Meat is scarce,” answered his comrade. “I ain’t seen a rabbit sign for days.”  Thereafter they spoke no more, though their ears were keen for the hunting-cries that continued to rise behind them.  At the fall of darkness they swung the dogs into a cluster of spruce trees on the edge of the waterway and made a camp. The coffin, at the side of the fire, served for seat and table. The wolf-dogs, clustered on the far side of the fire, snarled and bickered among themselves, but evinced no inclination to stray off into the darkness.  “Seems to me, Henry, they’re stayin’ remarkable close to camp,” Bill commented.  Henry, squatting over the fire and settling the pot of coffee with a piece of ice, nodded. Nor did he speak till he had taken his seat on the coffin and begun to eat.  “They know where their hides is safe,” he said. “They’d sooner eat grub than be grub. They’re pretty wise, them dogs.”  Bill shook his head. “Oh, I don’t know.”  His comrade looked at him curiously. “First time I ever heard you say anything about their not bein’ wise.”  “Henry,” said the other, munching with deliberation the beans he was eating, “did you happen to notice the way them dogs kicked up when I was a-feedin’ ’em?”  “They did cut up more’n usual,” Henry acknowledged.  “How many dogs ’ve we got, Henry?”  “Six.”  “Well, Henry . . . ” Bill stopped for a moment, in order that his words might gain greater significance. “As I was sayin’, Henry, we’ve got six dogs. I took six fish out of the bag. I gave one fish to each dog, an’, Henry, I was one fish short.”  “You counted wrong.”  “We’ve got six dogs,” the other reiterated dispassionately. “I took out six fish. One Ear didn’t get no fish. I came back to the bag afterward an’ got ’m his fish.”  “We’ve only got six dogs,” Henry said.  “Henry,” Bill went on. “I won’t say they was all dogs, but there was seven of ’m that got fish.”  Henry stopped eating to glance across the fire and count the dogs.  “There’s only six now,” he said.  “I saw the other one run off across the snow,” Bill announced with cool positiveness. “I saw seven.”  Henry looked at him commiseratingly, and said, “I’ll be almighty glad when this trip’s over.”  “What d’ye mean by that?” Bill demanded.  “I mean that this load of ourn is gettin’ on your nerves, an’ that you’re beginnin’ to see things.”  “I thought of that,” Bill answered gravely. “An’ so, when I saw it run off across the snow, I looked in the snow an’ saw its tracks. Then I counted the dogs an’ there was still six of ’em. The tracks is there in the snow now. D’ye want to look at ’em? I’ll show ’em to you.”  Henry did not reply, but munched on in silence, until, the meal finished, he topped it with a final cup of coffee. He wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and said:  “Then you’re thinkin’ as it was—”  A long wailing cry, fiercely sad, from somewhere in the darkness, had interrupted him. He stopped to listen to it, then he finished his sentence with a wave of his hand toward the sound of the cry, “—one of them?”  Bill nodded. “I’d a blame sight sooner think that than anything else. You noticed yourself the row the dogs made.”  Cry after cry, and answering cries, were turning the silence into a bedlam. From every side the cries arose, and the dogs betrayed their fear by huddling together and so close to the fire that their hair was scorched by the heat. Bill threw on more wood, before lighting his pipe.  “I’m thinking you’re down in the mouth some,” Henry said.  “Henry . . . ” He sucked meditatively at his pipe for some time before he went on. “Henry, I was a-thinkin’ what a blame sight luckier he is than you an’ me’ll ever be.”  He indicated the third person by a downward thrust of the thumb to the box on which they sat.  “You an’ me, Henry, when we die, we’ll be lucky if we get enough stones over our carcases to keep the dogs off of us.”  “But we ain’t got people an’ money an’ all the rest, like him,” Henry rejoined. “Long-distance funerals is somethin’ you an’ me can’t exactly afford.”  “What gets me, Henry, is what a chap like this, that’s a lord or something in his own country, and that’s never had to bother about grub nor blankets; why he comes a-buttin’ round the Godforsaken ends of the earth—that’s what I can’t exactly see.”  “He might have lived to a ripe old age if he’d stayed at home,” Henry agreed.  Bill opened his mouth to speak, but changed his mind."]]]
