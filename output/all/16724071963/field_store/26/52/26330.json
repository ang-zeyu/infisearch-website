She was a plump, quick, alive little creature. So she was quite excited and happy.  John Thomas made her stay on for the next round. And therefore she could hardly for shame repulse him when he put his arm round her and drew her a little nearer to him, in a very warm and cuddly manner. Besides, he was fairly discreet, he kept his movement as hidden as possible. She looked down, and saw that his red, clean hand was out of sight of the crowd. And they knew each other so well. So they warmed up to the fair.  After the dragons they went on the horses. John Thomas paid each time, so she could but be complaisant. He, of course, sat astride on the outer horse—named “Black Bess”—and she sat sideways, towards him, on the inner horse—named “Wildfire”. But of course John Thomas was not going to sit discreetly on “Black Bess”, holding the brass bar. Round they spun and heaved, in the light. And round he swung on his wooden steed, flinging one leg across her mount, and perilously tipping up and down, across the space, half lying back, laughing at her. He was perfectly happy; she was afraid her hat was on one side, but she was excited.  He threw quoits on a table, and won for her two large, pale-blue hat-pins. And then, hearing the noise of the cinemas, announcing another performance, they climbed the boards and went in.  Of course, during these performances pitch darkness falls from time to time, when the machine goes wrong. Then there is a wild whooping, and a loud smacking of simulated kisses. In these moments John Thomas drew Annie towards him. After all, he had a wonderfully warm, cosy way of holding a girl with his arm, he seemed to make such a nice fit. And, after all, it was pleasant to be so held: so very comforting and cosy and nice. He leaned over her and she felt his breath on her hair; she knew he wanted to kiss her on the lips. And, after all, he was so warm and she fitted in to him so softly. After all, she wanted him to touch her lips.  But the light sprang up; she also started electrically, and put her hat straight. He left his arm lying nonchalantly behind her. Well, it was fun, it was exciting to be at the Statutes with John Thomas.  When the cinema was over they went for a walk across the dark, damp fields. He had all the arts of love-making. He was especially good at holding a girl, when he sat with her on a stile in the black, drizzling darkness. He seemed to be holding her in space, against his own warmth and gratification. And his kisses were soft and slow and searching.  So Annie walked out with John Thomas, though she kept her own boy dangling in the distance. Some of the tram-girls chose to be huffy. But there, you must take things as you find them, in this life.  There was no mistake about it, Annie liked John Thomas a good deal. She felt so rich and warm in herself whenever he was near. And John Thomas really liked Annie, more than usual. The soft, melting way in which she could flow into a fellow, as if she melted into his very bones, was something rare and good. He fully appreciated this.  But with a developing acquaintance there began a developing intimacy. Annie wanted to consider him a person, a man; she wanted to take an intelligent interest in him, and to have an intelligent response. She did not want a mere nocturnal presence, which was what he was so far. And she prided herself that he could not leave her.  Here she made a mistake. John Thomas intended to remain a nocturnal presence; he had no idea of becoming an all-round individual to her. When she started to take an intelligent interest in him and his life and his character, he sheered off. He hated intelligent interest. And he knew that the only way to stop it was to avoid it. The possessive female was aroused in Annie. So he left her.  It is no use saying she was not surprised. She was at first startled, thrown out of her count. For she had been so _very_ sure of holding him. For a while she was staggered, and everything became uncertain to her. Then she wept with fury, indignation, desolation, and misery. Then she had a spasm of despair. And then, when he came, still impudently, on to her car, still familiar, but letting her see by the movement of his head that he had gone away to somebody else for the time being, and was enjoying pastures new, then she determined to have her own back.  She had a very shrewd idea what girls John Thomas had taken out. She went to Nora Purdy. Nora was a tall, rather pale, but well-built girl, with beautiful yellow hair. She was rather secretive.  “Hey!” said Annie, accosting her; then softly, “Who’s John Thomas on with now?”  “I don’t know,” said Nora.  “Why tha does,” said Annie, ironically lapsing into dialect. “Tha knows as well as I do.”  “Well, I do, then,” said Nora. “It isn’t me, so don’t bother.”  “It’s Cissy Meakin, isn’t it?”  “It is, for all I know.”  “Hasn’t he got a face on him!” said Annie. “I don’t half like his cheek. I could knock him off the foot-board when he comes round at me.”  “He’ll get dropped-on one of these days,” said Nora.  “Ay, he will, when somebody makes up their mind to drop it on him. I should like to see him taken down a peg or two, shouldn’t you?”  “I shouldn’t mind,” said Nora.  “You’ve got quite as much cause to as I have,” said Annie. “But we’ll drop on him one of these days, my girl. What? Don’t you want to?”  “I don’t mind,” said Nora.  But as a matter of fact, Nora was much more vindictive than Annie.  One by one Annie went the round of the old flames. It so happened that Cissy Meakin left the tramway service in quite a short time. Her mother made her leave. Then John Thomas was on the _qui-vive_. He cast his eyes over his old flock. And his eyes lighted on Annie. He thought she would be safe now. Besides, he liked her.  She arranged to walk home with him on Sunday night. It so happened that her car would be in the depôt at half past nine: the last car would come in at 10.15. So John Thomas was to wait for her there.  At the depôt the girls had a little waiting-room of their own. It was quite rough, but cosy, with a fire and an oven and a mirror, and table and wooden chairs. The half dozen girls who knew John Thomas only too well had arranged to take service this Sunday afternoon. So, as the cars began to come in, early, the girls dropped into the waiting-room. And instead of hurrying off home, they sat around the fire and had a cup of tea. Outside was the darkness and lawlessness of war-time.  John Thomas came on the car after Annie, at about a quarter to ten. He poked his head easily into the girls’ waiting-room.  “Prayer-meeting?” he asked.  “Ay,” said Laura Sharp. “Ladies only.”  “That’s me!” said John Thomas. It was one of his favourite exclamations.  “Shut the door, boy,” said Muriel Baggaley.  “On which side of me?” said John Thomas.  “Which tha likes,” said Polly Birkin.  He had come in and closed the door behind him. The girls moved in their circle, to make a place for him near the fire. He took off his great-coat and pushed back his hat.  “Who handles the teapot?” he said.  Nora Purdy silently poured him out a cup of tea.  “Want a bit o’ my bread and drippin’?” said Muriel Baggaley to him.  “Ay, give us a bit.”  And he began to eat his piece of bread.  “There’s no place like home, girls,” he said.  They all looked at him as he uttered this piece of impudence. He seemed to be sunning himself in the presence of so many damsels.  “Especially if you’re not afraid to go home in the dark,” said Laura Sharp.  “Me! By myself I am.”  They sat till they heard the last tram come in. In a few minutes Emma Houselay entered.  “Come on, my old duck!” cried Polly Birkin.  “It _is_ perishing,” said Emma, holding her fingers to the fire.  “But—I’m afraid to, go home in, the dark,” sang Laura Sharp, the tune having got into her mind.  “Who’re you going with tonight, John Thomas?” asked Muriel Baggaley, coolly.  “Tonight?” said John Thomas. “Oh, I’m going home by myself tonight—all on my lonely-O.”  “That’s me!” said Nora Purdy, using his own ejaculation.  The girls laughed shrilly.  “Me as well, Nora,” said John Thomas.  “Don’t know what you mean,” said Laura.  “Yes, I’m toddling,” said he, rising and reaching for his overcoat.  “Nay,” said Polly. “We’re all here waiting for you.”  “We’ve got to be up in good time in the morning,” he said, in the benevolent official manner.  They all laughed.  “Nay,” said Muriel. “Don’t leave us all lonely, John Thomas. Take one!”  “I’ll take the lot, if you like,” he responded gallantly.  “That you won’t either,” said Muriel, “Two’s company; seven’s too much of a good thing.”  “Nay—take one,” said Laura. “Fair and square, all above board, and say which.”  “Ay,” cried Annie, speaking for the first time. “Pick, John Thomas; let’s hear thee.”  “Nay,” he said. “I’m going home quiet tonight. Feeling good, for once.”  “Whereabouts?” said Annie. “Take a good un, then. But tha’s got to take one of us!”  “Nay, how can I take one,” he said, laughing uneasily. “I don’t want to make enemies.”  “You’d only make _one_,” said Annie.  “The chosen _one_,” added Laura.  “Oh, my! Who said girls!” exclaimed John Thomas, again turning, as if to escape. “Well—good-night.”  “Nay, you’ve got to make your pick,” said Muriel. “Turn your face to the wall, and say which one touches you. Go on—we shall only just touch your back—one of us. Go on—turn your face to the wall, and don’t look, and say which one touches you.”  He was uneasy, mistrusting them. Yet he had not the courage to break away. They pushed him to a wall and stood him there with his face to it. Behind his back they all grimaced, tittering. He looked so comical. He looked around uneasily.  “Go on!” he cried.  “You’re looking—you’re looking!” they shouted.  He turned his head away. And suddenly, with a movement like a swift cat, Annie went forward and fetched him a box on the side of the head that sent his cap flying and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8931"],["title","The Gem Collector (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's note: _The Gem Collector_ was revised and republished in 1910 as _The Intrusion of Jimmy_, also known as _A Gentleman of Leisure_.

G. WODEHOUSE  Published in _Ainslee's Magazine_, December 1909.     CHAPTER I.   The supper room of the Savoy Hotel was all brightness and glitter and gayety. But Sir James Willoughby Pitt, baronet, of the United Kingdom, looked round about him through the smoke of his cigarette, and felt moodily that this was a flat world, despite the geographers, and that he was very much alone in it.  He felt old.  If it is ever allowable for a young man of twenty-six to give himself up to melancholy reflections, Jimmy Pitt might have been excused for doing so, at that moment. Nine years ago he had dropped out, or, to put it more exactly, had been kicked out, and had ceased to belong to London. And now he had returned to find himself in a strange city.  Jimmy Pitt's complete history would take long to write, for he had contrived to crowd much into those nine years. Abridged, it may be told as follows: There were two brothers, a good brother and a bad brother. Sir Eustace Pitt, the latter, married money. John, his younger brother, remained a bachelor. It may be mentioned, to check needless sympathy, that there was no rivalry between the two. John Pitt had not the slightest desire to marry the lady of his brother's choice, or any other lady. He was a self-sufficing man who from an early age showed signs of becoming some day a financial magnate.  Matters went on much the same after the marriage. John continued to go to the city, Eustace to the dogs. Neither brother had any money of his own, the fortune of the Pitts having been squandered to the ultimate farthing by the sportive gentleman who had held the title in the days of the regency, when White's and the Cocoa Tree were in their prime, and fortunes had a habit of disappearing in a single evening. Four years after the marriage, Lady Pitt died, and the widower, having spent three years and a half at Monte Carlo, working out an infallible system for breaking the bank, to the great contentment of Mons. Blanc and the management in general, proceeded to the gardens, where he shot himself in the orthodox manner, leaving many liabilities, few assets, and one son.  The good brother, by this time a man of substance in Lombard Street, adopted the youthful successor to the title, and sent him to a series of schools, beginning with a kindergarten and ending with Eton.  Unfortunately Eton demanded from Jimmy a higher standard of conduct than he was prepared to supply, and a week after his seventeenth birthday, his career as an Etonian closed prematurely. John Pitt thereupon delivered an ultimatum. Jimmy could choose between the smallest of small posts in his uncle's business, and one hundred pounds in banknotes, coupled with the usual handwashing and disowning. Jimmy would not have been his father's son if he had not dropped at the money. The world seemed full to him of possibilities for a young man of parts with a hundred pounds in his pocket.  He left for Liverpool that day, and for New York on the morrow.  For the next nine years he is off the stage, which is occupied by his Uncle John, proceeding from strength to strength, now head partner, next chairman of the company into which the business had been converted, and finally a member of Parliament, silent as a wax figure, but a great comfort to the party by virtue of liberal contributions to its funds.  It may be thought curious that he should make Jimmy his heir after what had happened; but it is possible that time had softened his resentment. Or he may have had a dislike for public charities, the only other claimant for his wealth. At any rate, it came about that Jimmy, reading in a Chicago paper that if Sir James Willoughby Pitt, baronet, would call upon Messrs. Snell, Hazlewood, and Delane, solicitors, of Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, he would hear of something to his advantage, had called and heard something very much to his advantage.  Wherefore we find him, on this night of July, supping in lonely magnificence at the Savoy, and feeling at the moment far less conscious of the magnificence than of the loneliness.  Watching the crowd with a jaundiced eye, Jimmy had found his attention attracted chiefly by a party of three a few tables away. The party consisted of a pretty girl, a lady of middle age and stately demeanor, plainly her mother, and a light-haired, weedy young man of about twenty. It had been the almost incessant prattle of this youth and the peculiarly high-pitched, gurgling laugh which shot from him at short intervals which had drawn Jimmy's notice upon them. And it was the curious cessation of both prattle and laugh which now made him look again in their direction.  The young man faced Jimmy; and Jimmy, looking at him, could see that all was not well with him. He was pale. He talked at random. A slight perspiration was noticeable on his forehead.  Jimmy caught his eye. There was a hunted look in it.  Given the time and the place, there were only two things which could have caused that look. Either the light-haired young man had seen a ghost, or he had suddenly realized that he had not enough money to pay the check.  Jimmy's heart went out to the sufferer. He took a card from his case, scribbled the words, \"Can I help?\" on it, and gave it to a waiter to take to the young man, who was now in a state bordering on collapse.  The next moment the light-haired one was at his table, talking in a feverish whisper.  \"I say,\" he said, \"it's frightfully good of you, old chap. It's frightfully awkward. I've come out with too little money. I hardly like to--What I mean to say is, you've never seen me before, and----\"  \"That's all right,\" said Jimmy. \"Only too glad to help. It might have happened to any one. Will this be enough?\"  He placed a five-pound note on the table. The young man grabbed at it with a rush of thanks.  \"I say, thanks fearfully,\" he said. \"I don't know what I'd have done. I'll let you have it back to-morrow. Here's my card. Blunt's my name. Spennie Blunt. Is your address on your card? I can't remember. Oh, by Jove, I've got it in my hand all the time.\" The gurgling laugh came into action again, freshened and strengthened by its rest. \"Savoy Mansions, eh? I'll come round to-morrow. Thanks, frightfully, again old chap. I don't know what I should have done.\"  He flitted back to his table, bearing the spoil, and Jimmy, having finished his cigarette, paid his check, and got up to go.  It was a perfect summer night. He looked at his watch. There was time for a stroll on the Embankment before bed.  He was leaning on the balustrade, looking across the river at the vague, mysterious mass of buildings on the Surrey side, when a voice broke in on his thoughts.  \"Say, boss. Excuse me.\"  Jimmy spun round. A ragged man with a crop of fiery red hair was standing at his side. The light was dim, but Jimmy recognized that hair.  \"Spike!\" he cried.  The other gaped, then grinned a vast grin of recognition.  \"Mr. Chames! Gee, dis cops de limit!\"  Three years had passed since Jimmy had parted from Spike Mullins, Red Spike to the New York police, but time had not touched him. To Jimmy he looked precisely the same as in the old New York days.  A policeman sauntered past, and glanced curiously at them. He made as if to stop, then walked on. A few yards away he halted. Jimmy could see him watching covertly. He realized that this was not the place for a prolonged conversation.  \"Spike,\" he said, \"do you know Savoy Mansions?\"  \"Sure. Foist to de left across de way.\"  \"Come on there. I'll meet you at the door. We can't talk here. That cop's got his eye on us.\"  He walked away. As he went, he smiled. The policeman's inspection had made him suddenly alert and on his guard. Yet why? What did it matter to Sir James Pitt, baronet, if the whole police force of London stopped and looked at him?  \"Queer thing, habit,\" he said, as he made his way across the road.     CHAPTER II.   A black figure detached itself from the blacker shadows, and shuffled stealthily to where Jimmy stood on the doorstep.  \"That you, Spike?\" asked Jimmy, in a low voice.  \"Dat's right, Mr. Chames.\"  \"Come on in.\"  He led the way up to his rooms, switched on the electric light, and shut the door. Spike stood blinking at the sudden glare. He twirled his battered hat in his hands. His red hair shone fiercely.  Jimmy inspected him out of the corner of his eye, and came to the conclusion that the Mullins finances must be at a low ebb. Spike's costume differed in several important details from that of the ordinary well-groomed man about town. There was nothing of the _flaneur_ about the Bowery boy. His hat was of the soft black felt, fashionable on the East Side of New York. It was in poor condition, and looked as if it had been up too late the night before. A black tail coat, burst at the elbows, stained with mud, was tightly buttoned across his chest. This evidently with the idea of concealing the fact that he wore no shirt--an attempt which was not wholly successful. A pair of gray flannel trousers and boots out of which two toes peeped coyly, completed the picture.  Even Spike himself seemed to be aware that there were points in his appearance which would have distressed the editor of a men's fashion paper.  \"'Scuse dese duds,\" he said. \"Me man's bin an' mislaid de trunk wit' me best suit in. Dis is me number two.\"  \"Don't mention it, Spike,\" said Jimmy. \"You look like a matinee idol. Have a drink?\"  Spike's eye gleamed as he reached for the decanter. He took a seat.  \"Cigar, Spike?\"  \"Sure. T'anks, Mr. Chames.\"  Jimmy lit his pipe. Spike, after a"]]]
