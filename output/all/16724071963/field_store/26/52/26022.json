The voice was low, soft, and accorded with the mild expression of the countenance.  “Well, what news, Nighthawk?” asked Stuart; “experience tells me that you have something of importance to communicate?”  “Ah, general!”  “Yes. You pass in the cavalry by the name of the ‘man before the battle,’ for you always turn up then.”  Mr. Nighthawk smiled.  “I try to give you information, general; and perhaps I have some news. But first of my visits to Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, where I saw many of our friends.”  And in his low, quiet voice Mr. Nighthawk, who had taken a seat and smoothed down his white cravat, proceeded to speak of his travels and what he had seen.  The narrative astounded me. He spoke without reserve, for General Stuart had informed him that he might do so before me; and I was startled to find the number of private friends the South had in the North. Mr. Nighthawk was evidently _au fait_ at his trade. He had a perfect understanding plainly with persons of the highest political position; and Stuart listened with the greatest interest to the speaker, whose low voice never rose above the half-whisper by which I had been impressed on his first opening his lips.  “So the summing up of all this,” said Stuart, “that our friends are not too hopeful?”  “They are not, general.”  “They say Lee must win a great victory on the soil of Pennsylvania?”  “Yes, general. Without it there is no hope of peace, they declare.”  “Well, I think they are right; and that we shall gain the victory.”  Mr. Nighthawk made no reply; and Stuart reflected for some moments without speaking. Then rousing himself:--  “I forgot,” he said. “You have not given me your special information, Nighthawk.”  The worthy smiled.  “You know I am the ‘man before the battle,’ general?”  “Yes, go on, Nighthawk.”  “I have just left General Hooker’s head-quarters.”  “Where are they?”  “Beyond Centreville.”  “You saw him?”  “I conversed with him.”  “Ah!”  “An hour, general, as the Rev. Mr. Ward, from Massachusett, of the ‘Grand Union Sanitary Commission’.”  And Mr. Nighthawk smiled.  “Of course I urged active movements, and General Hooker became quite animated.”  “He agreed with your views then?” said Stuart, laughing.  “Perfectly, general.”  “And he intends--”  “There is the important thing. While we were conversing, General Hooker was called for a moment out of his tent, and by accident, my eyes fell upon an order which lay upon his desk.”  “An order?”  “For two divisions of cavalry, one of infantry, and a full complement of artillery, to advance and drive you back to the mountain.”  “Ah! you saw that order?”  “I did, general; it was just ready to be sent.”  “What day did it fix?”  “To-morrow, general.”  “Ah, indeed! Two divisions of infantry and one of cavalry?”  Mr. Nighthawk inclined in assent.  “When did you leave Hooker’s head-quarters?”  “This afternoon.”  “And you came through the lines to-night?”  “Yes, general, in the usual way, by passing through the pickets. I was on foot and nothing was easier.”  Stuart knit his brows and reflected. Then he called to the orderly.  “Wake the adjutant-general, and have three couriers ready at once!”  Mr. Nighthawk arose.  “By-the-by, general,” he said, “I saw Swartz, whom I have mentioned to you.”  “Yes; the best spy, you say, in the Federal army.”  “I think he is, general. He is a wonderful man. He recently played a trick upon you.”  “Upon _me_?”  “At least he bore off a prisoner from you. It was a lady, captured by Colonel Mohun, one night on the Rappahannock.”  “Ah! Is it possible! So Swartz was the old countryman, driving the wagon that morning.”  “So he informed me, general.”  “You are friends, then?”  “Close friends.”  And Mr. Nighthawk smiled.  “We have an agreement--but that would not interest you, general. That was really Swartz, and the old woman was the prisoner.”  “Well,” said Stuart, “that was a bold stroke, but the lady was handsome enough to make friends. There is something between herself and Colonel Mohun, is there not?”  Mr. Nighthawk glanced quickly at the face of the general. His eyes resembled steel points, but the piercing glance at once sank.  “Something between them, general? What could have made you think that? But here is Major McClellan. I will not detain you, general; I will come back at daylight to receive your orders.”  With these words, Mr. Nighthawk distributed a benignant smile, bowed in a friendly manner, and disappeared, it was difficult to say how, from the apartment. I had turned my eyes from him but an instant; when I again looked he was gone.  “And now to work!” exclaimed Stuart. “We are going to fight tomorrow, Surry, since the ‘man before the battle’ has made his appearance!”     XII.   HOW STUART FELL BACK.   At daybreak, Stuart was going at full gallop to the front.  A rapid fire of skirmishers, mingled with the dull roar of cannon, indicated that Nighthawk had not been deceived.  All at once the sharp-shooters were seen falling back from the woods.  “Bring me a piece of artillery!” exclaimed Stuart, darting to the front.  But the attack of the enemy swept all before it. Stuart was driven back, and was returning doggedly, when the gun for which he had sent, galloped up, and unlimbered in the road.  It was too late. Suddenly a solid shot screamed above us; the gun was hurled from its carriage, and rolled shattered and useless in the wood; the horses were seen rearing wild with terror, and trying to kick out of the harness.  Suddenly one of them leaped into the air and fell, torn in two by a second round shot.  “Quick work!” said Stuart, grimly.  And turning round to me, he said, pointing to a hill in rear--  “Post three pieces on that hill to rake all the roads.”  The order, like the former, came too late, however. The enemy advanced in overpowering force--drove Stuart back beyond his head-quarters, where they captured the military satchel of the present writer--and still rushing forward, like a hurricane, compelled the Confederate cavalry to retire behind Goose Creek. On the high ground there, Stuart posted his artillery; opened a rapid fire; and before this storm of shell the Federal forces paused.  The spectacle at that moment was picturesque and imposing. The enemy’s force was evidently large. Long columns of cavalry, heavy masses of infantry and artillery at every opening, right, left, and centre, showed that the task of driving back Stuart was not regarded as very easy. The sunshine darted from bayonet and sabre all along the great line of battle--and from the heavy smoke, tinged with flame, came the Federal shell. With their infantry, cavalry, and artillery, they seemed determined to put an end to us. Stuart galloped to his guns, pouring a steady fire from the lofty hill. Captain Davenant directed it in person, and he was evidently in his right element. All his sadness had disappeared. A cool and resolute smile lit up his features.  “All right, Davenant! Hold your ground!” exclaimed Stuart.  “I will do so, general.”  “Can you keep them from crossing?”  “I can try, general.”  A whirlwind of shell screamed around the two speakers. For the hundredth time I witnessed that entire indifference to danger which was a trait of Stuart. The fire at this moment was so terrible that I heard an officer say:--  “General Stuart seems trying to get himself and everybody killed.”  Nothing more inspiring, however, can be imagined than his appearance at that moment. His horse, wild with terror, reared, darted, and attempted to unseat his rider. Stuart paid no attention to him. He had no eyes or thought for any thing but the enemy. His cheeks were flushed, his eyes flamed--he resembled a veritable king of battle.  From Stuart my glances passed to Davenant. His coolness impressed me deeply. While giving an order, a shell burst right in his face, enveloping horse and rider in a cloud of smoke--but when the smoke drifted away, he was sitting his horse unmoved, and giving the order as quietly as before.  I have not invented this picture, reader, or fancied this character. I had the honor to enjoy the friendship of the brave boy I describe. He was remarkable, in an epoch crowded with remarkable characters.  Stuart held his ground for an hour on the high hills of Goose Creek, but it then became plain that he was going to be driven back. The enemy had felt him, and discovered that the game was in their own hands. Now they rushed on his right, left and centre, at the same moment--cavalry, infantry, and artillery rolling on like a torrent--crossed the stream, charged the hill--in a moment a bitter and savage combat commenced for the possession of the crest.  Stuart rushed toward the guns. As he reached them a cannon ball carried off the head of a cannoneer, and his horse reared with fright, nearly trampling on the headless trunk which spouted blood. Davenant had coolly drawn his sabre, but had given no order to retire.  “Move back the guns!” exclaimed Stuart.  “Is it necessary, general?” asked Davenant.  “Yes, they will be captured in five minutes!”  “It is a pity we can not remain, general. This is an excellent position.”  And he gave the order to limber up. The operation was performed amid a hurricane of bullets, striking down the cannoneers.  Suddenly a column of Federal cavalry charged straight at the guns. Davenant met them with his mounted men, armed with sabres, and a stubborn combat followed. It was a hilt to hilt affair, and Davenant was in the midst of it shouting:--  “You are fighting for your guns, boys! You promised to die by your guns!”  The men answered with fierce shouts, and met the enemy with savage resolution. Meanwhile, the guns had rushed at a gallop down the western slope; a regiment came to Davenant’s assistance; the fight grew desperate, but was of no avail.  In fifteen minutes we were driven.  Driven! Do you"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8424"],["title","Mohun; Or, the Last Days of Lee and His Paladins. (#8)"],["body","what that means, reader? Ask old soldiers if it is pleasant. They will growl in reply!  We were forced back, step by step, with the enemy at our very heels. At our backs came on the huge column, yelling and firing, mad with triumph. Stuart the valiant, the obstinate, the unshrinking was driven!  We were forced back to Upperville, and there things looked stormy. On the other roads, Stuart’s right and left were rapidly retiring. His centre at Upperville seemed devoted to destruction.  The enemy came on like a whirlwind, with a roaring shout. As far as the eye could see, the great fields were dark with them. Their horse artillery advanced at a gallop, unlimbered, and tore the retreating columns with shot and shell.  I was ten yards from Stuart, just at the edge of the town, when a picked body of Federal horsemen darted straight upon him.  They had evidently recognized him by his major-general’s uniform and splendid feather. Bullets hissed around him; blows were struck at him; and for an instant I saw him in the midst of a wild huddle of enemies, defending himself with his revolver only.  In an instant he would have been killed or captured, with his staff and body-guard, when a resounding shout was heard.  I glanced over my shoulder, and saw the cavaliers of Hampton coming on with drawn sabre.  Then a splendid spectacle was presented--that of Wade Hampton in one of his great moments. This stalwart cavalier was leading his men, and in an instant they had struck the enemy with a noise like thunder.  Suddenly a cavalier on a black horse rushed by like the wild huntsman, and I recognized Mohun; who, spurring his animal to headlong speed, drove straight at the leader of the Federal cavalry, almost in contact with us.  Through a rift in the smoke I caught a glimpse of Mohun’s opponent. He was a man of low stature, but broad, heavy, and powerful. He came to meet his adversary with the bridle of his horse resting on the animal’s neck, while both hands clutched a heavy broad-sword, raised over his right shoulder.  I could only see that the two opponents hurled together like knights tilting; their swords gleamed; they closed in, body to body; then the smoke wrapped them. It was impossible to see more.     XIV.   MOSBY COMES TO STUART’S ASSISTANCE.   Sore and restive at the reverse which had come to balance his victory of Fleetwood, Stuart bivouacked near Paris, that night, and made every preparation to attack at dawn.  At daylight he was in the saddle, and spurred to the high ground commanding Upperville.  All at once he checked his horse. The enemy had disappeared.  Stuart’s blue eye flashed, and half an hour afterward he was advancing at the head of his cavalry. Not a foe was visible. Pressing on through Upperville, and over the trampled fields beyond, he continued to advance upon Middleburg, and near that place came up with the rear of the enemy. They showed little fight, however, and were driven beyond the place. The gray troopers pursued them with shouts and cheers--with which were mingled cries of rejoicing from the people of Middleburg.  An hour afterward the lines were re-established in triumph.  Stuart returned to his former head-quarters amid a drenching rain; and this recalls an incident very honorable to the brave soldier. As night descended, dark and stormy, Stuart gazed gloomily at the torrents of rain falling.  “My poor fellows!” he said, with a sigh, “they will have a hard time to-night.”  Then suddenly turning to his servant, he added:--  “Spread my oil-cloth and blankets under that apple tree yonder. I will keep them dry enough when I once get into them.”[1]  [Footnote 1: His words.]  “You are not going to sleep out on such a night, general!” exclaimed a staff officer.  “Certainly I am,” was his reply, “I don’t intend to fare better than my men!”[1]  [Footnote 1: His words.]  And an hour afterward Stuart was asleep under the apple tree, with a torrent pouring on him.  That was the act of a good officer and soldier, was it not, reader?  Before sunrise Stuart was up, and walking uneasily to and fro. As the day wore on, he exhibited more and more impatience. All at once, at the appearance of an officer, approaching rapidly from the front, he uttered an exclamation of pleasure.  “Here is Mosby at last!” he said.  And he went to meet the new-comer. It was the famous chief of partisans whose name by this time had become a terror to the enemy. He wore a plain gray uniform, a brace of revolvers in a swaying belt, rode a spirited gray mare, and I recognized at once the roving glance, and satirical smile which had struck me on that night when he rescued Farley and myself in Fauquier.  Stuart rapidly drew him into a private apartment; remained in consultation with him for half an hour; and then came forth, with a smile of evident satisfaction.  Mosby’s intelligence must have pleased him. It at least dispelled his gloom.  An hour afterward his head-quarters had disappeared--every thing was sent toward the mountains. Stuart set out apparently to follow them--but that was only a ruse to blind busybodies.  A quarter of a mile from head-quarters he leaped a fence, and doubled back, going in the direction now of Manassas.  At daylight on the next morning he had forced his way through the Bull Run mountain.  Two hours afterward he had made a sudden attack on the enemy’s infantry. It was the rear of Hancock’s corps, which was the rear of Hooker’s army, then retiring toward the Potomac.     XV.   THE SUPPER NEAR BUCKLANDS.   Stuart’s fight near Haymarket, here alluded to, was a gay affair; but I pass over it, to a scene still gayer and decidedly more pleasant.  The fighting continued throughout the day, and at dusk a heavy rain came on. We were all tired and hungry--the general no less so than his staff--and when an invitation was sent to us by a gentleman near Bucklands, to come and sup with him, we accepted it with fervor, and hastened toward the friendly mansion.  A delightful reception awaited us. The house was full of young ladies, passionately devoted to “rebels,” and we were greeted with an enthusiasm which passed all bounds. Delicate hands pressed our own; bright eyes beamed upon us; rosy lips smiled; musical voices said “welcome!”--and soon a savory odor, pervading the mansion, indicated that the wants of the inner man were not forgotten.  An excellent supper was plainly in preparation for the bold Stuart and his military family; and that gay and gallant cavalier, General Fitz Lee having also been invited, the joy of the occasion was complete! The house rang with clashing heels, rattling sabres, and clanking spurs. A more charming sound still, however, was that made by jingling keys and rattling china, and knives and forks. All was joy and uproar: jests, compliments and laughter. Young ladies went and came; the odors grew more inviting. In ten minutes the door of a large apartment opposite the drawing-room was thrown open, and a magnificent, an enthralling spectacle was revealed to every eye. Not to be carried away, however, by enthusiasm, I will simply say that we saw before us a long mahogany table covered with the most appetizing viands--broils, roasts, stews, bread of every variety, and real coffee and tea in real silver! That magical spectacle still dwells in my memory, reader, though the fact may lower me in your good opinion. But alas! we are all “weak creatures.”  The most poetical grow hungry. We remember our heroic performances in the great civil war--but ask old soldiers if these recollections are not the most vivid!  An incident connected with the repast made it especially memorable. The servants of the house had deserted to their friends in blue; and as there was thus a deficiency of attendants, the young ladies took their places. Behind every chair stood a maiden--their faces wreathed with smiles. We were shown to our seats, amid joyous laughter. The comedy evidently afforded all engaged in it immense enjoyment--and the cavaliers humoring the angelic maid-servants, gravely advanced toward the table.  Stuart threw his plumed hat upon a chair, and drew near the foot of the table. The light fell full on the ruddy face, the heavy beard and mustache, and brilliant fighting jacket. He looked round with a gay smile. “Was any one absent,” asked the kind lady of the house, as she saw the glance. Stuart made a low bow, and said:--  “All are here, madam!”  All at once, however, a voice at the door responded:--  “I think you are mistaken, general!”  And he who had uttered these words advanced into the apartment.  He was a young man, about twenty-three, of medium height, graceful, and with a smile of charming good humor upon the lips. His hair was light and curling; his eyes blue; his lips shaded by a slender mustache. His uniform was brand new, and decorated with the braid of a lieutenant. Yellow gauntlets reached his elbow, he wore a shiny new satchel, and in his hand carried a brown felt hat, caught up with a golden star.  Stuart grasped his hand warmly.  “Here you are, old fellow!” he exclaimed.  And turning to the company, he added:--  “My new aid-de-camp, Lieutenant Herbert, ladies. A fop--but an old soldier. Take that seat by Colonel Surry, Tom.”  And every one sat down, and attacked the supper.  I had shaken hands with Tom Herbert, who was far from being a stranger to me, as I had met him frequently in the drawing-rooms of Richmond before the war. He was a fop, but the most charming of fops, when I first knew him. He wore brilliant waistcoats, variegated scarfs, diamond studs, and straw-colored kid gloves. In his hand he used to flourish an ivory-headed whalebone cane, and his boots were of feminine delicacy and dimensions. Such was Tom at that time, but the war had “brought him out.” He had rushed into the ranks, shouldered a musket, and fought bravely. So much I knew--and I was soon to hear how he had come to be Stuart’s aid.  The supper was charming. The young girls waited on us with mock submission"]]]
