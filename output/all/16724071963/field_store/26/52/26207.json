Lord Rokesle stood apart, and with a sly and meditative smile observed them.  \"Your plea is a remarkable one,\" said Simon Orts. \"As I understand it, you appeal to me to meddle in your affairs on the ground that you once made a fool of me. I think the obligation is largely optional. I remember quite clearly the incidents to which you refer; and it shames even an old sot like me to think that I was ever so utterly at the mercy of a good-for-nothing jilt. I remember every vow you ever made to me, Anastasia, and I know they were all lies. I remember every kiss, every glance, every caress--all lies, Anastasia! And gad! the only emotion it rouses in me is wonder as to why my worthy patron here should want to marry you. Of course you are wealthy, but, personally, I would not have you for double the money. I must ask you to rise, Lady Rokesle.--Pardon me if I somewhat anticipate your title.\"  Lady Allonby stumbled to her feet. \"Is there no manhood in the world?\" she asked, with a puzzled voice. \"Has neither of you ever heard of manhood, though but as distantly as men hear summer thunder? Had neither of you a woman for a mother--a woman, as I am--or a father who was not--O God!--not as you are?\"  \"These rhetorical passages,\" said Lord Rokesle, \"while very elegantly expressed, are scarcely to the point. So you and Simon went a-philandering once? Egad, that lends quite a touch of romance to the affair. But despatch, Parson Simon,--your lady's for your betters now.\"  \"Dearly beloved,--\" said Simon Orts.  \"Simon, you are not all base. I am helpless, Simon, utterly helpless. There was a Simon once would not have seen me weep. There was a Simon--\"  \"--we are gathered together here in the sight of God--\"  \"You cannot do it, Simon,--do I not know you to the marrow? Remember--not me--not the vain folly of my girlhood!--but do you remember the man you have been, Simon Orts!\" Fiercely Lady Allonby caught him by the shoulder. \"For you do remember! You do remember, don't you, Simon?\"  The Vicar stared at her. \"The man I have been,\" said Simon Orts, \"yes!--the man I have been!\" Something clicked in his throat with sharp distinctness.  \"Upon my word,\" said Lord Rokesle, yawning, \"this getting married appears to be an uncommonly tedious business.\"  Then Simon Orts laid aside his prayer-book and said: \"I cannot do it, my Lord. The woman's right.\"  She clapped her hands to her breast, and stood thus, reeling upon her feet. You would have thought her in the crisis of some physical agony; immediately she breathed again, deeply but with a flinching inhalation, as though the contact of the air scorched her lungs, and, swaying, fell. It was the Vicar who caught her as she fell.  \"I entreat your pardon?\" said Lord Rokesle, and without study of Lady Allonby's condition. This was men's business now, and over it Rokesle's brow began to pucker.  Simon Orts bore Lady Allonby to the settie. He passed behind it to arrange a cushion under her head, with an awkward, grudging tenderness; and then rose to face Lord Rokesle across the disordered pink fripperies.  \"The woman's right, my Lord. There is such a thing as manhood. Manhood!\" Simon Orts repeated, with a sort of wonder; \"why, I might have boasted it once. Then came this cuddling bitch to trick me into a fool's paradise--to trick me into utter happiness, till Stephen Allonby, a marquis' son, clapped eyes on her and whistled,--and within the moment she had flung me aside. May God forgive me, I forgot I was His servant then! I set out to go to the devil, but I went farther; for I went to you, Vincent Floyer. You gave me bread when I was starving,--but 'twas at a price. Ay, the price was that I dance attendance on you, to aid and applaud your knaveries, to be your pander, your lackey, your confederate,--that I puff out, in effect, the last spark of manhood in my sot's body. Oh, I am indeed beholden to you two! to her for making me a sot, and to you for making me a lackey. But I will save her from you, Vincent Floyer. Not for her sake\"--Orts looked down upon the prostrate woman and snarled. \"Christ, no! But I'll do it for the sake of the boy I have been, since I owe that boy some reparation. I have ruined his nimble body, I have dulled the wits he gloried in, I have made his name a foul thing that honesty spits out of her mouth; but, if God yet reigns in heaven, I cleanse that name to-night!\"  \"Oh, bless me,\" Lord Rokesle observed; \"I begin to fear these heroics are contagious. Possibly I, too, shall begin to rant in a moment. Meanwhile, as I understand it, you decline to perform the ceremony. I have had to warn you before this, Simon, that you mustn't take too much gin when I am apt to need you. You are very pitifully drunk, man. So you defy me and my evil courses! You defy me!\" Rokesle laughed, genially, for the notion amused him. \"Wine is a mocker, Simon. But come, despatch, Parson Tosspot, and let's have no more of these lofty sentiments.\"  \"I cannot do it. I--O my Lord, my Lord! You wouldn't kill an unarmed man!\" Simon Orts whined, with a sudden alteration of tone; for Lord Rokesle had composedly drawn his sword, and its point was now not far from the Vicar's breast.  \"I trust that I shall not be compelled to. Egad, it is a very ludicrous business when the bridegroom is forced to hold a sword to the parson's bosom all during the ceremony; but a ceremony we must have, Simon, for Lady Allonby's jointure is considerable. Otherwise--Harkee, my man, don't play the fool! there are my fellows yonder, any one of whom would twist your neck at a word from me. And do you think I would boggle at a word? Gad, Simon, I believed you knew me better!\"  The Vicar of Heriz Magna kept silence for an instant; his eyes were twitching about the hall, in that stealthy way of his. Finally, \"It is no use,\" said he. \"A poor knave cannot afford the luxury of honesty. My life is not a valuable one, perhaps, but even vermin have an aversion to death. I resume my lackeyship, Lord Rokesle. Perhaps 'twas only the gin. Perhaps--In any event, I am once more at your service. And as guaranty of this I warn you that you are exhibiting in the affair scant forethought. Mr. Heleigh is but three miles distant. If he, by any chance, get wind of this business, Denstroude will find a boat for him readily enough--ay, and men, too, now that the Colonel is at feud with you. Many of your people visit the mainland every night, and in their cups the inhabitants of Usk are not taciturn. An idle word spoken over an inn-table may bring an armed company thundering about your gates. You should have set sentinels, my Lord.\"  \"I have already done so,\" Rokesle said; \"there are ten of 'em yonder. Still there is something in what you say. We will make this affair certain.\"  Lord Rokesle crossed the hall to the foot of the stairway and struck thrice upon the gong hanging there. Presently the door leading to the corridor was opened, and a man came into the hall.  \"Punshon,\" said Lord Rokesle, \"have any boats left the island to-night?\"  \"No, my Lord.\"  \"You will see that none do. Also, no man is to leave Stornoway to-night, either for Heriz Magna or the mainland; and nobody is to enter Stornoway. Do you understand, Punshon?\"  \"Yes, my Lord.\"  \"If you will pardon me,\" said Simon Orts, with a grin, \"I have an appointment to-night. You'd not have me break faith with a lady?\"  \"You are a lecherous rascal, Simon. But do as you are bid and I indulge you. I am not afraid of your going to Harry Heleigh--after performing the ceremony. Nay, my lad, for you are thereby _particeps criminis_. You will pass Mr. Orts, Punshon, to the embraces of his whore. Nobody else.\"  Simon Orts waved his hand toward Lady Allonby. \"'Twere only kindness to warn Mr. Punshon there may be some disturbance shortly. A lamentation or so.\"  At this Lord Rokesle clapped him upon the shoulder and heartily laughed. \"That's the old Simon--always on the alert. Punshon, no one is to enter this wing of the castle, on any pretext--no one, you understand. Whatever noises you may hear, you will pay no attention. Now go.\"  He went toward Lady Allonby and took her hand. \"Come, Anastasia!\" said he. \"Hold, she has really swooned! Why, what the devil, Simon--!\"  Simon Orts had flung the gong into the fire. \"She will be sounding that when she comes to,\" said Simon Orts. \"You don't want a rumpus fit to vex the dead yonder in the Chapel.\" Simon Orts stood before the fire, turning the leaves of his prayer-book. He seemed to have difficulty in finding again the marriage service. You heard the outer door of the corridor closing, heard chains dragged ponderously, the heavy falling of a bolt. Orts dropped the book and, springing into the arm-chair, wrested Aluric Floyer's sword from its fastening. \"Tricked, tricked!\" said Simon Orts. \"You were always a fool, Vincent Floyer.\"  Lord Rokesle blinked at him, as if dazzled by unexpected light. \"What d'ye mean?\"  \"I have the honor to repeat--you are a fool, I did not know the place was guarded--you told me. I needed privacy; by your orders no one is to enter here to-night. I needed a sword--you had it hanging here, ready for the first comer. Oh, beyond doubt, you are a fool, Vincent Floyer!\" Standing in the arm-chair, Simon Orts bowed fantastically, and then leaped to the ground with the agility of an imp.  \"You have tricked me neatly,\" Lord Rokesle conceded, and his tone did not lack honest admiration. \"By gad, I have even given them orders to pass you--after you have murdered me! Exceedingly clever, Simon,--but one thing you overlooked. You are very far from my match at fencing. So I shall presently kill you. And afterward, ceremony or no ceremony, the woman's mine.\"  \"I am not convinced of that,\" the Vicar observed. \"'Tis true I am no swordsman; but there are behind my sword forces superior to any which skill might"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8715"],["title","Gallantry: Dizain des Fetes Galantes (#6)"],["body","ster. The sword of your fathers fights against you, my Lord--against you that are their disgrace. They loved honor and truth; you betrayed honor, you knew not truth. They revered womanhood; you reverence nothing, and your life smirches your mother's memory. Ah, believe me, they all fight against you! Can you not see them, my Lord?--yonder at my back?--old Aluric Floyer and all those honest gentlemen, whose blood now blushes in your body--ay, blushes to be confined in a vessel so ignoble! Their armament fights against you, a host of gallant phantoms. And my hatred, too, fights against you--the cur's bitter hatred for the mastering hand it dares not bite. I dare now. You made me your pander, you slew my manhood; in return, body and soul, I demolish you. Even my hatred for that woman fights against you; she robbed me of my honor--is it not a tragical revenge to save her honor, to hold it in my hand, mine, to dispose of as I elect,--and then fling it to her as a thing contemptible? Between you, you have ruined me; but it is Simon's hour to-night. I shame you both, and past the reach of thought, for presently I shall take your life--in the high-tide of your iniquity, praise God!--and presently I shall give my life for hers. Ah, I a fey, my Lord! You are a dead man, Vincent Floyer, for the powers of good and the powers of evil alike contend against you.\"  He spoke rather sadly than otherwise; and there was a vague trouble in Lord Rokesle's face, though he shook his head impatiently. \"These are fine words to come from the dirtiest knave unhanged in England.\"  \"Great ends may be attained by petty instruments, my Lord; a filthy turtle quenched the genius of Æschylus, and they were only common soldiers who shed the blood that redeemed the world.\"  Lord Rokesle pished at this. Yet he was strangely unruffled. He saluted with quietude, as equal to equal, and the two crossed blades.  Simon Orts fought clumsily, but his encroachment was unwavering. From the first he pressed his opponent with a contained resolution. The Vicar was as a man fighting in a dream--with a drugged obstinacy, unswerving. Lord Rokesle had wounded him in the arm, but Orts did not seem aware of this. He crowded upon his master. Now there were little beads of sweat on Lord Rokesle's brow, and his tongue protruded from his mouth, licking at it ravenously. Step by step Lord Rokesle drew back; there was no withstanding this dumb fanatic, who did not know when he was wounded, who scarcely parried attack.  \"Even on earth you shall have a taste of hell,\" said Simon Orts. \"There is terror in your eyes, my worthy patron.\"  Lord Rokesle flung up his arms as the sword dug into his breast. \"I am afraid! I am afraid!\" he wailed. Then he coughed, and seemed with his straining hands to push a great weight from him as the blood frothed about his lips and nostrils. \"O Simon, I am afraid! Help me, Simon!\"  Old custom spoke there. Followed silence, and presently the empty body sprawled upon the floor. Vincent Floyer had done with it.   IV  Simon Orts knelt, abstractedly wiping Aluric Floyer's sword upon the corner of a rug. It may be that he derived comfort from this manual employment which necessitated attention without demanding that it concentrate his mind; it may have enabled him to forget how solitary the place was, how viciously his garments rustled when he moved: the fact is certain that he cleaned the sword, over and over again.  Then a scraping of silks made him wince. Turning, he found Lady Allonby half-erect upon the settle. She stared about her with a kind of Infantile wonder; her glance swept, over Lord Rokesle's body, without to all appearance finding it an object of remarkable interest. \"Is he dead?\"  \"Yes,\" said Simon Orts; \"get up!\" His voice had a rasp; she might from his tone have been a refractory dog. But Lady Allonby obeyed him.  \"We are in a devil of a mess,\" said Simon Orts; \"yet I see a way out of it--if you can keep your head. Can you?\"  \"I am past fear,\" she said, dully. \"I drown, Simon, in a sea of feathers. I can get no foothold, I clutch nothing that is steadfast, and I smother. I have been like this in dreams. I am very tired, Simon.\"  He took her hand, collectedly appraising her pulse. He put his own hand upon her bared bosom, and felt the beat of her heart. \"No,\" said Simon Orts, \"you are not afraid. Now, listen: You lack time to drown in a sea of feathers. You are upon Usk, among men who differ from beasts by being a thought more devilish, and from devils by being a little more bestial; it is my opinion that the earlier you get away the better. Punshon has orders to pass Simon Orts. Very well; put on this.\"  He caught up his long cloak and wrapped it about her. Lady Allonby stood rigid. But immediately he frowned and removed the garment from her shoulders.  \"That won't do. Your skirts are too big. Take 'em off.\"  Submissively she did so, and presently stood before him in her under-petticoat.  \"You cut just now a very ludicrous figure, Anastasia. I dare assert that the nobleman who formerly inhabited yonder carcass would still be its tenant if he had known how greatly the beauty he went mad for was beholden to the haberdasher and the mantua-maker, and quite possibly the chemist. _Persicos odi_, Anastasia; 'tis a humiliating reflection that the hair of a dead woman artfully disposed about a living head should have the power to set men squabbling, and murder be at times engendered in a paint-pot. However, wrap yourself in the cloak. Now turn up the collar,--so. Now pull down the hatbrim. Um--a--pretty well. Chance favors us unblushingly. You may thank your stars it is a rainy night and that I am a little man. You detest little men, don't you? Yes, I remember.\" Simon Orts now gave his orders, emphasizing each with a not over-clean forefinger. \"When I open this door you will go out into the corridor. Punshon or one of the others will be on guard at the farther end. Pay no attention to him. There is only one light--on the left. Keep to the right, in the shadow. Stagger as you go; if you can manage a hiccough, the imitation will be all the more lifelike. Punshon will expect something of the sort, and he will not trouble you, for he knows that when I am fuddled I am quarrelsome. 'Tis a diverting world, Anastasia, wherein, you now perceive, habitual drunkenness and an unbridled temper may sometimes prove commendable,--as they do to-night, when they aid persecuted innocence!\" Here Simon Orts gave an unpleasant laugh.  \"But I do not understand--\"  \"You understand very little except coquetry and the proper disposition of a ruffle. Yet this is simple. My horse is tied at the postern. Mount--astride, mind. You know the way to the Vicarage, so does the horse; you will find that posturing half-brother of mine at the Vicarage. Tell Frank what has happened. Tell him to row you to the mainland; tell him to conduct you to Colonel Denstroude's. Then you must shift for yourself; but Denstroude is a gentleman, and Denstroude would protect Beelzebub if he came to him a fugitive from Vincent Floyer. Now do you understand?\"  \"Yes,\" said Lady Allonby, and seated herself before the fire,--\"yes, I understand. I am to slip away in the darkness and leave you here to answer for Lord Rokesle's death--to those devils. La, do you really think me as base as that?\"  Now Simon Orts was kneeling at her side. The black cloak enveloped her from head to foot, and the turned-up collar screened her sunny hair; in the shadow of the broad hatbrim you could see only her eyes, resplendent and defiant, and in them the reflection of the vaulting flames. \"You would stay, Anastasia?\"  \"I will not purchase my life at the cost of yours. I will be indebted to you for nothing, Simon Orts.\"  The Vicar chuckled. \"Nor appeared Less than archangel ruined,\" he said. \"No, faith, not a whit less! We are much of a piece, Anastasia. Do you know--if affairs had fallen out differently--I think I might have been a man and you a woman? As it is--\" Kneeling still, his glance devoured her. \"Yes, you would stay. And you comprehend what staying signifies. 'Tis pride, your damnable pride, that moves you,--but I rejoice, for it proves you a brave woman. Courage, at least, you possess, and this is the first virtue I have discovered in you for a long while. However, there is no necessity for your staying. The men of Usk will not hurt Simon Orts.\"  She was very eager to believe this. Lady Allonby had found the world a pleasant place since her widowhood. \"They will not kill you? You swear it, Simon?\"  \"Why, the man was their tyrant. They obeyed him--yes, through fear. I am their deliverer, Anastasia. But if they found a woman here--a woman not ill-looking--\" Simon Orts snapped his fingers. \"Faith, I leave you to conjecture,\" said he.  They had both risen, he smiling, the woman in a turbulence of hope and terror. \"Swear to it, Simon!\"  \"Anastasia, were affairs as you suppose them, I would have a curt while to live. Were affairs as you suppose them, I would stand now at the threshold of eternity. And I swear to you, upon my soul's salvation, that I have nothing to fear. Nothing will ever hurt me any more.\"  \"No, you would not dare to lie in the moment of death,\" she said, after a considerable pause. \"I believe you. I will go. Good-bye, Simon.\" Lady Allonby went toward the door opening into the corridor, but turned there and came back to him. \"I shall never see you again. And, la, I think that I rather hate you than otherwise, for you remind me of things I would willingly forget. But, Simon, I wish we had gone to live in that little cottage we planned, and quarrelled over, and never built! I think we would have been happy.\"  Simon Orts raised her hand to his lips. \"Yes,\" said he, \"we would have been happy. I would have been by this a man doing a man's work in the world, and you a matron, grizzling, perhaps, but rich in content, and in love opulent. As it is, you have your flatterers, your gossip, and your cards; I"]]]
