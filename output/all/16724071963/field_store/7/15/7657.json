Elder-trees and other wild      shrubbery wind around this wall. Old Jewish houses are crowded all      along near this wall, threatened with destruction at any moment.      The strange circle formed by this wall has an unwelcome, puzzling      appearance.       “This is the city of the dead—the renowned Prague cemetery.       “In this abode of rest may be seen the spirit of the nation, whose      bones found shelter here after long wandering,—here is stamped all      its history, full of sufferings, struggles and resistance.       “It seems as though at any moment these tombs, overgrown with      shrubbery, are ready to open, these stones growing for thousands of      years are ready to raise themselves, and to let out into the world      the restless wanderer with a pack upon his shoulder, with a staff      in his hand, in order to go again to strange peoples,—to cheat and      combat them and to seek a new Canaan—his dominion! The Jewish      cemetery in Prague is the very oldest cemetery known. It was closed      by order of the government a hundred years ago. For foreigners it      is a historical landmark; for the Jews it is a sacred place. The      impression of this deserted spot is intensified by its      surroundings. Amidst the closely crowded tombs and monuments,      overgrown with moss, only a narrow passage remains which is almost      entirely covered with shrubbery of thorn-bushes and mat-weed.       “During the inspection, the watchman will tell the visitor the      history of the death of Rabbi Ben Manasseh, the great conqueror of      death, and Rabbi Loewe, the most learned Rabbi of the 17th century;      he will speak of Simon the Just and of the Polish princess Anna      Shmiless. He will then lead the visitor to the monument of Anna      Kohn on which can be read the mysterious figure 606, which shows      that the Jews, more than twelve hundred years ago, had buried      their dead here, in the legendary times of Lyubush and her      daughters.       “If we are not to believe this figure, we must nevertheless agree      with the opinion of the Jews that this is the oldest settlement and      the first Jewish community in Europe.       “Silently the Jewish guide and the curious foreigner go by one      place where under an old lilac bush a heap of stone stands out, and      when the foreigner asks, ‘What is this?’ the guide gives an evasive      answer——       “‘Beth Chaim—the house of life.’ Thus is the cemetery called. Yes,      indeed, this place of rest is a house of life, for from here is      given the mysterious impulse which makes the exiles masters of the      earth and tyrants of nations,—the impulse which directs the golden      calf to the chosen tribe.       “The Jewish town has assumed a holiday aspect. The stands of the      petty retailers have disappeared; Jewish boys and girls were      strolling about in their holiday attire. The houses and windows      were adorned with green branches. On the old benches sat men,      talking seriously; in the alleys youths were chatting. From time to      time men and women in their best Sabbath clothes were going to the      synagogue, carrying prayer books in their hands; while poor      Christian women whom need had forced to work in this quarter were      running with keys and dishes in order to prepare for the feast.       “It was the last day of the Feast of Booths, the day of Assembly,      and dusk was gathering over the narrow streets, while the Christian      part of the city was still brightly illumined by the last rays of      the setting sun. Two men (the older wore a black silk mantle, with      long earlocks, which showed that he was a Polish Jew; the other was      middle aged, in modern clothes, with diamond studs in his shirt and      a heavy golden chain on his vest) walked along the narrow streets,      without paying any attention to the crowd.       “The younger seemed to be the guide. Having come with his companion      to the little house where the watchman of the cemetery lived, he      knocked at the closed door, through a crevice of which the bright      light of wax candles was seen, showing the watchman’s holiday mood.      It was a good summer—a large number of foreigners had visited the      cemetery and were generous in their gifts.       “In the doorway appeared the thin face of the watchman, whose      short-sighted eyes began to look fixedly into the darkness.       “‘Come out into the street, Joel, somebody wants to talk to you!’       “‘O, God of Justice,’ said the watchman with amazement, as he came      out of the door,—‘One of the trustees! What is your pleasure to      command me?’       “‘This Rabbi desires to make a brief prayer in the cemetery; he is      leaving to-morrow morning by train.’       “‘In the cemetery? This evening? But you know yourself, Mr. Banker,      that I am forbidden to open the gates after sunset, and to-night is      also the holy Sabbath.’       “‘First of all, there is no need for you to shout here about my      calling,’ replied the banker, displeased. ‘Every Jewish rag-picker      will know that banker Rosenberg was here to see you. As for the      permit to open the gates, I myself, as a trustee, authorize you to      do it. I will wait here until he has completed his prayer. The      company in your house must not know what we are doing here. Arrange      it so that the curious crowd will not rush in there.’       “The watchman disappeared in the house, but soon returned with a      bunch of keys and opened the gates of the cemetery. He took a      lantern along and was about to light it.       “‘Don’t!’ said the Rabbi in a low voice. ‘I don’t need any light.      Lock the gates from the inside!’       “‘But, Mr. von Rosenberg——’       “‘Lock it, I say!’       “The watchman obeyed.       “‘Now lead me to the grave of the holy Rabbi Simeon-ben-Yehudah!’       “‘Hold on to my coat, esteemed sir,’ said the watchman. ‘It is dark      and you may stumble over the old graves.’       “‘I can see better at night than in the daytime, my son!’ answered      the learned Polish Jew.       “‘Here is the grave!’       “The old Rabbi reverently leaned over the tombstone. The watchman      heard him pronounce a prayer in Jewish. He used so many words of      ancient Hebrew, or some other words of a language he did not      understand, that he knew only a few separate expressions, although      he himself had been in the past a teacher at the Bohemian      community.       “Having completed his prayer, the stranger turned to the watchman      of the cemetery:       “‘When you accepted the position from your predecessor, did he not      give you certain instructions?’       “‘Me?’       “‘Yes, you! It was so from the day the first person was buried in      this place.’       “‘Well, and what if he did give such instructions,—how does that      concern you? This the first time I am asked about this matter since      I am employed here.’       “‘Because this happens once in a hundred years, and human life      rarely lasts as long as that.’       “‘I see that you know about it, Rabbi,’ said the frightened      watchman. ‘But I can obey you only if you mention the word which      was given to me by my predecessor, because I took a sacred oath on      the Bible.’       “The Polish Jew bent down and slowly pronounced a word of seven      syllables.       “The watchman bowed respectfully.       “‘You are the Rabbi!’ he said. ‘All will be done as you command!’       “‘You will send away the friends who are feasting in your house      before the clock strikes eleven. At the first stroke you will open      the gates of the cemetery, and at the last stroke you will get into      your house, lock the doors and windows, lie down in your bed and      turn into a corpse together with the members of your      household,—into a corpse that sees and hears nothing.’       “‘I will neither look nor listen.’       “‘The angel of death will leave your soul in your body and will      force you to wander about among the graves to the end of time if      you do not carry out my orders correctly. Now go, and remember that      by virtue of your position you are the servant of the great      Jerusalem synagogue. I need not tell you that you should not say      anything to that vain, worldly man who brought me here.’       “Both returned to the gates, near which the banker was still on      guard.       “‘Well,’ he said, ‘your desire is fulfilled, Rabbi, and you may      inform my friend in Warsaw that Rosenberg and Son are always ready      to do a favor to a guest recommended by such a personage. Now let      us go home; my wife is waiting for us.’       “‘Let us go, my son,’ replied the Rabbi. ‘But relieve me of      worldly pleasures. I shall spend the night in prayer!’       “The banker shrugged his shoulders and gave the watchman a gold      coin.       “‘Joel,’ he said in a low voice, ‘the other trustees of the      community must not know about this violation of the rule.’       “The watchman nodded, and the companion again disappeared in the      dark streets, which had already become deserted, while in the      houses people talked merrily and the sounds of holiday festivities      were heard.       “How poor, dirty and dark these little houses looked from outside!      But it was quite different within! In the rear rooms of many of      these houses the bright light of numerous wax candles was reflected      in the splendid high mirrors, in expensive dishes and precious      rugs. Girls and women, who in the morning perhaps walked with trays      in their hands, now were seated at the tables in heavy silk gowns      with golden chains and bracelets; their jewels and"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],["title","The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#4)"],["body","were      glittering.         *       *       *       *       *       “The clock in the town-hall tower struck ten. In the chapel, near      the statue of St. Nepomucenus, upon a stone bench, sat a      large-sized man, with the pale serious face of Germanic type. Every      physiognomist, looking at him, would have said that this man had      devoted his youth to serious scientific work and that he had spent      many sleepless nights over books.       “The clock had just struck ten when upon the bridge appeared a man      in a light summer coat, of about the same age as the young      scientist. His face was pale, of waxen color, without the slightest      natural red in his cheeks; his particularly prominent nose      indicated his Jewish extraction; his forehead was high and large,      his head was strongly developed. He walked straight over to the man      who was waiting and who quickly arose.       “‘Good evening. I see you have received my letter. Have you it with      you?’       “‘Yes, I know it by heart, I have read it so many times. “My      friend,” it is written there, “I have promised to give you the key      to the Caballah, if I ever find the opportunity to do so. Although      I am not always in the habit of fulfilling my vows, I am ready to      fulfil this one, if you will wait for me in the evening of October      8, in Prague, on the old Moldau bridge, under the statue of      Nepomucenus.” Then follows your name.’       “‘Yes, that is correct. Have you not yet given up your desire?’       “‘Less than ever before! You would render science an invaluable      service.’       “‘Listen, doctor, bend down a little over the rail; that of which      we speak must not be heard even by the waves of the Moldau, if we      wish to remain alive.’       “The young scientist looked in astonishment at his comrade, but did      as he desired.       “‘Three years ago, in Rome, when I promised to acquaint you with      the mysteries of the Caballah, I did it more for the sake of      boasting of a power and authority which, in reality, I did not      possess. Although I had studied for some time the traditions of my      nation, rather out of curiosity than because of the love of      knowledge, I knew very well that I could hardly penetrate the      corridor of those mysteries which I am still regarding as the      sophistry and roguishness of exalted minds, invented for the      purpose of holding fools in fear and subordination. But several      accidental discoveries, made by me since then, have changed my      views and have aroused in me a sense of curiosity.       “‘You know, notwithstanding our brief acquaintance, that I am not      the type of man who would abandon a clue or a conceived plan. What      has caused me to make you my companion in satisfying my      curiosity—that does not concern you. It is enough that now we have      an opportunity to satisfy our mutual desire, and all depends on      whether you will agree to accept the conditions upon which I can      make you a partner in my investigation.’       “‘If these are not against honor and conscience.’       “‘In this respect you have nothing to risk, you are rather risking      something else—your life. Do you feel that you are capable of      facing a serious danger?’       “‘For the sake of science, yes!’       “‘Very well, in that case I must tell you that I will lead you to a      place which we will not leave alive, if our presence is discovered.      The slightest suspicion that we were uninvited witnesses of the      secret will bring upon us persecution which will kill us sooner or      later.’       “‘You are whetting my curiosity, signor!’       “‘That is all I wanted to tell you. The other thing—you know that      I am a Jew by birth. Although the Jews have driven me from their      midst and cursed me according to their custom and traditions      because I adopted Christianity,—still I have my own reasons for      stipulating a condition—your word of honor that you will be silent      about all you will see and hear, until I authorize you to speak.’       “‘I swear by my honor.’       “‘Very well. You will recall in your investigations of the Caballah      that in the mysterious books mention is made of a meeting of the      heads or chosen ones of the nation,—a meeting which takes place      from time to time?’       “‘Yes, in the Yezire it is said very definitely, and if I      understood correctly, such meetings take place every hundred      years.’       “‘Yes. The last meeting took place in 1760 and you recall that      shortly afterward the movement of Judaism started. It is now 1787      years since the destruction of Jerusalem and this year is      designated for a meeting of the Cabalistic Sanhedrin. This is the      day of the meeting; the place is this city. I want to be present at      this meeting in spite of the danger and am ready to take you along      with me.’       “‘But will it not be dishonest to listen, will it not be an      unlawful interference with other people’s secrets?’       “‘Per Bacco! as we Italians say; with such hesitations you must      abandon once for all the idea of fulfilling your desire. Or do you      think that the people who guard the secret of the Caballah will      bring it to you on a tray? As far as I am concerned, I shall      discover the secret, at any cost!’       “After reflecting a few minutes, the scientist came to a decision.       “‘I shall go with you, come what may!’       “‘Very well. Now we have agreed. Let us go,—there is no time to      lose.’”         *       *       *       *       *       “The tower clock of the town-hall struck eleven. At the first      stroke a key clicked in the lock of the cemetery gates. Then      followed profound silence which indicated that the cemetery was      open. The lights in the Jewish houses were gradually dying out, and      at the same time the sounds of the merry feasting also subsided.       “Mysterious silence reigned in that terrible place.       “The gates creaked softly; the rustling of long coats was heard,      touching the stones and shrubbery; finally a vague white figure      appeared and slipped by like a shadow along the pathways.       “This figure knelt before one of the tombstones; three times it      touched the stone with its forehead and softly whispered a prayer.       “Along the path leading from the gates came an old man, bent,      limping, sighing and coughing. He came over to the ancient      tombstone, and lowered himself on his knees near the white figure      that had entered before him, and he, too, whispered a prayer.       “Then heavy footsteps were heard, and a tall, impressive figure      appeared on the road, clad in a white mantle, and he, too, fell      down on his knees, as though unwillingly, in front of the      tombstone.       “Thirteen times this was repeated. Thirteen old men came over to      the tombstone. The doctor counted them, but he could not understand      whether they were alive or dead. A shiver crept down his back, his      heart began to beat faster from fright. He involuntarily recalled      the terrible legend of the Day of Atonement in the tenth month,      Tishri, in the synagogue of Posen when, during the prayer of Kol      Nidrei, the congregation kept growing larger and larger; unknown      people, pushing one another, wrapped in prayer shawls, came in, one      hundred after another, until the terrified Rabbi lifted his hand as      if to curse and exclaimed: ‘He who has flesh in his cheeks, let him      throw off the prayer shawl!’ Hundreds remained covered, and when      the prayer shawls were torn away from them, all saw the skulls of      the dead who had come out of the graves to celebrate the Day of      Atonement with the rest of the congregation.       “As there, it seemed to him that the prayer shawls had fallen off      the heads of the praying old men, and a row of dead skulls      appeared. At that moment the clock struck twelve. A sharp metallic      sound rang out on the grave, after which a blue flame appeared and      illumined the thirteen kneeling figures.       “‘I greet you, Roshe beth Aboth (heads) of the twelve tribes of      Israel,’ announced a dull voice.       “‘We greet you, son of the accursed.’       “‘A hundred years have already passed. Where have the Nesiyim      (princes of the tribes) come from?’       “‘From the lands where the nation of Adonai has been scattered by      the orders of our forefathers.’       “‘Are you ready to fulfil the promise during the coming century?’       “‘We are ready!’       “‘Then say, whose representatives are you, and where do you come      from? Tribe of Judah?’       “‘From Amsterdam,’ replied a strong, loud voice.       “‘Tribe of Benjamin?’       “‘Toledo!’ came the dull answer.       “‘Tribe of Levi?’       “‘Worms!’       “‘Tribe of Manasseh?’       “‘Budapest!’       “‘Tribe of Gad?’       “‘Cracow!’       “‘Tribe of Simeon?’       “‘Rome!’       “‘Tribe of Zebulun?’       “‘Paris!’       “‘Tribe of Dan?’       “‘Constantinople!’       “‘Tribe of Asher?’       “‘London!’       “‘Tribe of Issachar?’       “The answer came in a faint voice and could not be heard      distinctly.       “‘Tribe of Naphtali?’       “‘Prague!’       “‘And I am the representative of the unfortunate and exiles,’ said      the man who asked the questions in a dull voice. ‘I am myself      wandering about all over the world in order that I may unite you      for the sake of the cause of redemption which has been promised to      the seed of Abraham and which was taken from them by the sons of      him who was crucified! Who is here of the house of Aaron, let him      rise, scrutinize the heads of the tribes and gather the council.’       “The man who was the first to arrive rose and then seated himself      upon the tombstone. One by one the others came over to him and      whispered in his ear a seven-syll"]]]
