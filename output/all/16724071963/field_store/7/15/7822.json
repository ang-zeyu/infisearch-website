Transcriber's Comments on the preparation of this E-Text:  SQUARE BRACKETS:  The square brackets, i.e. [ ] are copied from the printed book, without change, except that a closing bracket \"]\" has been added to the stage directions.   FOOTNOTES:  For this E-Text version of the book, the footnotes have been consolidated at the end of the play.  Numbering of the footnotes has been changed, and each footnote is given a unique identity in the form <X>.   CHANGES TO THE TEXT:  Character names have been expanded. For Example, SIR BENJAMIN was SIR BEN.     THE TEXT OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL  The text of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL in this edition is taken, by Mr. Fraser Rae's generous permission, from his SHERIDAN'S PLAYS NOW PRINTED AS HE WROTE THEM. In his Prefatory Notes (xxxvii), Mr. Rae writes: \"The manuscript of it [THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL] in Sheridan's own handwriting is preserved at Frampton Court and is now printed in this volume. This version differs in many respects from that which is generally known, and I think it is even better than that which has hitherto been read and acted. As I have endeavoured to reproduce the works of Sheridan as he wrote them, I may be told that he was a bad hand at punctuating and very bad at spelling. . . . But Sheridan's shortcomings as a speller have been exaggerated.\" Lest \"Sheridan's shortcomings\" either in spelling or in punctuation should obscure the text, I have, in this edition, inserted in brackets some explanatory suggestions. It has seemed best, also, to adopt a uniform method for indicating stage-directions and abbreviations of the names of characters. There can be no gain to the reader in reproducing, for example, Sheridan's different indications for the part of Lady Sneerwell--LADY SNEERWELL, LADY SNEER., LADY SN., and LADY S.--or his varying use of EXIT and EX., or his inconsistencies in the use of italics in the stage-directions. Since, however, Sheridan's biographers, from Moore to Fraser Rae, have shown that no authorised or correct edition of THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL was published in Sheridan's lifetime, there seems unusual justification for reproducing the text of the play itself with absolute fidelity to the original manuscript. Mr. Ridgway, who repeatedly sought to obtain a copy corrected by the author, according to Moore's account (LIFE OF SHERIDAN, I. p. 260), \"was told by Mr. Sheridan, as an excuse for keeping it back, that he had been nineteen years endeavouring to satisfy himself with the style of The School for Scandal, but had not yet succeeded.\" Mr. Rae (SHERIDAN, I. p. 332) recorded his discovery of the manuscript of \"two acts of The School for Scandal prepared by Sheridan for publication,\" and hoped, before his death, to publish this partial revision. Numberless unauthorized changes in the play have been made for histrionic purposes, from the first undated Dublin edition to that of Mr. Augustin Daly. Current texts may usually be traced, directly or indirectly, to the two-volume Murray edition of Sheridan's plays, in 1821. Some of the changes from the original manuscript, such as the blending of the parts of Miss Verjuice and Snake, are doubtless effective for reasons of dramatic economy, but many of the \"cuts\" are to be regretted from the reader's standpoint. The student of English drama will prefer Sheridan's own text to editorial emendations, however clever or effective for dramatic ends.      THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL   ADDRESSED TO MRS. CREWE,  WITH THE COMEDY OF THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL       Tell me, ye prim adepts in Scandal's school,      Who rail by precept, and detract by rule,      Lives there no character, so tried, so known,      So deck'd with grace, and so unlike your own,      That even you assist her fame to raise,      Approve by envy, and by silence praise!--      Attend!--a model shall attract your view--      Daughters of calumny, I summon you!      You shall decide if this a portrait prove,      Or fond creation of the Muse and Love.--      Attend, ye virgin critics, shrewd and sage,      Ye matron censors of this childish age,      Whose peering eye and wrinkled front declare      A fixt antipathy to young and fair;      By cunning, cautious; or by nature, cold,      In maiden madness, virulently bold!--      Attend! ye skilled to coin the precious tale,      Creating proof, where innuendos fail!      Whose practised memories, cruelly exact,      Omit no circumstance, except the fact!--      Attend, all ye who boast,--or old or young,--      The living libel of a slanderous tongue!      So shall my theme as far contrasted be,      As saints by fiends, or hymns by calumny.      Come, gentle Amoret (for 'neath that name,      In worthier verse is sung thy beauty's fame);      Come--for but thee who seeks the Muse? and while      Celestial blushes check thy conscious smile,      With timid grace, and hesitating eye,      The perfect model, which I boast, supply:--      Vain Muse! couldst thou the humblest sketch create      Of her, or slightest charm couldst imitate--      Could thy blest strain in kindred colours trace      The faintest wonder of her form and face--      Poets would study the immortal line,      And REYNOLDS own HIS art subdued by thine;      That art, which well might added lustre give      To Nature's best and Heaven's superlative:      On GRANBY'S cheek might bid new glories rise,      Or point a purer beam from DEVON'S eyes!      Hard is the task to shape that beauty's praise,      Whose judgment scorns the homage flattery pays!      But praising Amoret we cannot err,      No tongue o'ervalues Heaven, or flatters her!      Yet she, by Fate's perverseness--she alone      Would doubt our truth, nor deem such praise her own!      Adorning Fashion, unadorn'd by dress,      Simple from taste, and not from carelessness;      Discreet in gesture, in deportment mild,      Not stiff with prudence, nor uncouthly wild:      No state has AMORET! no studied mien;      She frowns no GODDESS, and she moves no QUEEN.      The softer charm that in her manner lies      Is framed to captivate, yet not surprise;      It justly suits th' expression of her face,--      'Tis less than dignity, and more than grace!      On her pure cheek the native hue is such,      That, form'd by Heav'n to be admired so much,      The hand divine, with a less partial care,      Might well have fix'd a fainter crimson there,      And bade the gentle inmate of her breast,--      Inshrined Modesty!--supply the rest.      But who the peril of her lips shall paint?      Strip them of smiles--still, still all words are faint!      But moving Love himself appears to teach      Their action, though denied to rule her speech;      And thou who seest her speak and dost not hear,      Mourn not her distant accents 'scape thine ear;      Viewing those lips, thou still may'st make pretence      To judge of what she says, and swear 'tis sense:      Cloth'd with such grace, with such expression fraught,      They move in meaning, and they pause in thought!      But dost thou farther watch, with charm'd surprise,      The mild irresolution of her eyes,      Curious to mark how frequent they repose,      In brief eclipse and momentary close--      Ah! seest thou not an ambush'd Cupid there,      Too tim'rous of his charge, with jealous care      Veils and unveils those beams of heav'nly light,      Too full, too fatal else, for mortal sight?      Nor yet, such pleasing vengeance fond to meet,      In pard'ning dimples hope a safe retreat.      What though her peaceful breast should ne'er allow      Subduing frowns to arm her altered brow,      By Love, I swear, and by his gentle wiles,      More fatal still the mercy of her smiles!      Thus lovely, thus adorn'd, possessing all      Of bright or fair that can to woman fall,      The height of vanity might well be thought      Prerogative in her, and Nature's fault.      Yet gentle AMORET, in mind supreme      As well as charms, rejects the vainer theme;      And, half mistrustful of her beauty's store,      She barbs with wit those darts too keen before:--      Read in all knowledge that her sex should reach,      Though GREVILLE, or the MUSE, should deign to teach,      Fond to improve, nor tim'rous to discern      How far it is a woman's grace to learn;      In MILLAR'S dialect she would not prove      Apollo's priestess, but Apollo's love,      Graced by those signs which truth delights to own,      The timid blush, and mild submitted tone:      Whate'er she says, though sense appear throughout,      Displays the tender hue of female doubt;      Deck'd with that charm, how lovely wit appears,      How graceful SCIENCE, when that robe she wears!      Such too her talents, and her bent of mind,      As speak a sprightly heart by thought refined:      A taste for mirth, by contemplation school'd,      A turn for ridicule, by candour ruled,      A scorn of folly, which she tries to hide;      An awe of talent, which she owns with pride!        Peace, idle Muse! no more thy strain prolong,      But yield a theme thy warmest praises wrong;      Just to her merit, though thou canst not raise      Thy feeble verse, behold th' acknowledged praise      Has spread conviction through the envious train,      And cast a fatal gloom o'er Scandal's reign!      And lo! each pallid hag, with blister'd tongue,      Mutters assent to all thy zeal has sung--      Owns all the colours just--the outline true;      Thee my inspirer, and my MODEL--CREWE!

CANDOUR      MISS VERJUICE     PROLOGUE WRITTEN BY MR. GARRICK       A school for Scandal! tell me, I beseech you,      Needs there a school this modish art to teach you?      No need of lessons now, the knowing think;      We might as well be taught to eat and drink.      Caused by a dearth of scandal, should the vapours      Distress our fair ones--let them read the papers;      Their powerful mixtures such disorders hit;      Crave what you will--there's quantum sufficit.      \"Lord!\" cries my Lady Wormwood (who loves tattle,      And puts much salt and pepper in her prattle),      Just risen at noon, all night at cards when threshing      Strong tea and scandal--\"Bless me, how refreshing!      Give me the papers, Lisp--how bold and free!  [Sips.]      LAST NIGHT LORD L. [Sips] WAS CAUGHT WITH LADY D.      For aching heads what charming sal volatile!  [Sips.]      IF MRS. B. WILL STILL CONTINUE FLIRTING,      WE HOPE SHE'LL draw, OR WE'LL undraw THE CURTAIN.      Fine satire, poz--in public all abuse it,      But, by ourselves [Sips], our praise we can't refuse it.      Now, Lisp, read you--there, at that dash and star:\"      \"Yes, ma'am--A CERTAIN LORD HAD BEST BEWARE,      WHO LIVES NOT TWENTY MILES FROM GROSVENOR SQUARE;      FOR, SHOULD HE LADY W. FIND WILLING,      WORMWOOD IS BITTER\"----\"Oh! that's me! the villain!      Throw it behind the fire, and never more      Let that vile paper come within my door.\"      Thus at our friends we laugh, who feel the dart;      To reach our feelings, we ourselves must smart.      Is our young bard so young, to think that he      Can stop the full spring-tide of calumny?      Knows he the world so little, and its trade?      Alas! the devil's sooner raised than laid.      So strong, so swift, the monster there's no gagging:      Cut Scandal's head off, still the tongue is wagging.      Proud of your smiles once lavishly bestow'd,      Again our young Don Quixote takes the road;      To show his gratitude he draws his pen,      And seeks his hydra, Scandal, in his den.      For your applause all perils he would through--      He'll fight--that's write--a cavalliero true,      Till every drop of blood--that's ink--is spilt for you.     ACT I   SCENE I.--LADY SNEERWELL'S House  LADY SNEERWELL at her dressing table with LAPPET; MISS VERJUICE drinking chocolate  LADY SNEERWELL. The Paragraphs you say were all inserted:  VERJUICE. They were Madam--and as I copied them myself in a feigned Hand there can be no suspicion whence they came.  LADY SNEERWELL. Did you circulate the Report of Lady Brittle's Intrigue with Captain Boastall?  VERJUICE. Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of half the Town--and I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep.  LADY SNEERWELL. What have you done as to the insinuation as to a certain Baronet's Lady and a certain Cook.  VERJUICE. That is in as fine a Train as your Ladyship could wish. I told the story yesterday to my own maid with directions to communicate it directly to my Hairdresser. He I am informed has a Brother who courts a Milliners' Prentice in Pallmall whose mistress has a first cousin whose sister is Feme [Femme] de Chambre to Mrs. Clackit--so that in the common course of Things it must reach Mrs. Clackit's Ears within four-and-twenty hours and then you know the Business is as good as done.  LADY SNEERWELL. Why truly Mrs. Clackit has a very pretty Talent--a great deal of industry--yet--yes--been tolerably successful in her way--To my knowledge she has been the cause of breaking off six matches[,] of three sons being disinherited and four Daughters being turned out of Doors. Of three several Elopements, as many close confinements--nine separate maintenances and two Divorces.--nay I have more than once traced her causing a Tete-a-Tete in the Town and Country Magazine--when the Parties perhaps had never seen each other's Faces before in the course of their Lives.  VERJUICE. She certainly has Talents.  LADY SNEERWELL. But her manner is gross.  VERJUICE. 'Tis very true. She generally designs well[,] has a free tongue and a bold invention--but her colouring is too dark and her outline often extravagant--She wants that delicacy of Tint--and mellowness of sneer--which distinguish your Ladyship's Scandal.  LADY SNEERWELL. Ah you are Partial Verjuice.  VERJUICE. Not in the least--everybody allows that Lady Sneerwell can do more with a word or a Look than many can with the most laboured Detail even when they happen to have a little truth on their side to support it.  LADY SNEERWELL. Yes my dear Verjuice. I am no Hypocrite to deny the satisfaction I reap from the Success of my Efforts. Wounded myself, in the early part of my Life by the envenomed Tongue of Slander I confess I have since known no Pleasure equal to the reducing others to the Level of my own injured Reputation.  VERJUICE. Nothing can be more natural--But my dear Lady Sneerwell There is one affair in which you have lately employed me, wherein, I confess I am at a Loss to guess your motives.  LADY SNEERWELL. I conceive you mean with respect to my neighbour, Sir Peter Teazle, and his Family--Lappet.--And has my conduct in this matter really appeared to you so mysterious?       [Exit MAID.]  VERJUICE. Entirely so.  LADY SNEERWELL. [VERJUICE.?] An old Batchelor as Sir Peter was[,] having taken a young wife from out of the Country--as Lady Teazle is--are certainly fair subjects for a little mischievous raillery--but here are two young men--to whom Sir Peter has acted as a kind of Guardian since their Father's death, the eldest possessing the most amiable Character and universally well spoken of[,] the youngest the most dissipated and extravagant young Fellow in the Kingdom, without Friends or caracter--the former one an avowed admirer of yours and apparently your Favourite[,] the latter attached to Maria Sir Peter's ward--and confessedly beloved by her. Now on the face of these circumstances it is utterly unaccountable to me why you a young Widow with no great jointure--should not close with the passion of a man of such character and expectations as Mr. Surface--and more so why you should be so uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual Attachment subsisting between his Brother Charles and Maria.  LADY SNEERWELL. Then at once to unravel this mistery--I must inform you that Love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr. Surface and me.  VERJUICE. No!  LADY SNEERWELL. His real attachment is to Maria or her Fortune--but finding in his Brother a favoured Rival, He has been obliged to mask his Pretensions--and profit by my Assistance.  VERJUICE. Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself in his success.  LADY SNEERWELL. Heavens! how dull you are! cannot you surmise the weakness which I hitherto, thro' shame have concealed even from you--must I confess that Charles--that Libertine, that extravagant, that Bankrupt in Fortune and Reputation--that He it is for whom I am thus anxious and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrifice--everything----  VERJUICE. Now indeed--your conduct appears consistent and I no longer wonder at your enmity to Maria, but how came you and Surface so confidential?  LADY SNEERWELL. For our mutual interest--but I have found out him a long time since[,] altho' He has contrived to deceive everybody beside--I know him to be artful selfish and malicious--while with Sir Peter, and indeed with all his acquaintance, He passes for a youthful Miracle of Prudence--good sense and Benevolence.  VERJUICE. Yes yes--I know Sir Peter vows He has not his equal in England; and, above all, He praises him as a MAN OF SENTIMENT.  LADY SNEERWELL. True and with the assistance of his sentiments and hypocrisy he has brought Sir Peter entirely in his interests with respect to Maria and is now I believe attempting to flatter Lady Teazle into the same good opinion towards him--while poor Charles has no Friend in the House--though I fear he has a powerful one in Maria's Heart, against whom we must direct our schemes.  SERVANT. Mr. Surface.  LADY SNEERWELL. Shew him up. He generally calls about this Time. I don't wonder at People's giving him to me for a Lover.       Enter SURFACE  SURFACE. My dear Lady Sneerwell, how do you do to-day--your most obedient.  LADY SNEERWELL. Miss Verjuice has just been arraigning me on our mutual attachment now; but I have informed her of our real views and the Purposes for which our Geniuses at present co-operate. You know how useful she has been to us--and believe me the confidence is not ill-placed.  SURFACE. Madam, it is impossible for me to suspect that a Lady of Miss Verjuice's sensibility and discernment----  LADY SNEERWELL. Well--well--no compliments now--but tell me when you saw your mistress or what is more material to me your Brother.  SURFACE. I have not seen either since I saw you--but I can inform you that they are at present at Variance--some of your stories have taken good effect on Maria.  LADY SNEERWELL. Ah! my dear Verjuice the merit of this belongs to you. But do your Brother's Distresses encrease?  SURFACE. Every hour. I am told He had another execution in his house yesterday--in short his Dissipation and extravagance exceed anything I have ever heard of.  LADY SNEERWELL. Poor Charles!  SURFACE. True Madam--notwithstanding his Vices one can't help feeling for him--ah poor Charles! I'm sure I wish it was in my Power to be of any essential Service to him--for the man who does not share in the Distresses of a Brother--even though merited by his own misconduct--deserves----  LADY SNEERWELL. O Lud you are going to be moral, and forget that you are among Friends.  SURFACE. Egad, that's true--I'll keep that sentiment till I see Sir Peter. However it is certainly a charity to rescue Maria from such a Libertine who--if He is to be reclaim'd, can be so only by a Person of your Ladyship's superior accomplishments and understanding.  VERJUICE. 'Twould be a Hazardous experiment.  SURFACE. But--Madam--let"]]]
