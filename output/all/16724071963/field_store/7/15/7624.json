Ten steps from the horse Lone stopped short, staring. For down in the bushes on the farther side half lay, half hung the limp form of a man.     CHAPTER FIVE  A DEATH \"BY ACCIDENT\"   Lone Morgan was a Virginian by birth, though few of his acquaintances knew it. Lone never talked of himself except as his personal history touched a common interest with his fellows. But until he was seventeen he had lived very close to the center of one of the deadliest feuds of the Blue Ridge. That he had been neutral was merely an accident of birth, perhaps. And that he had not become involved in the quarrel that raged among his neighbors was the direct result of a genius for holding his tongue. He had attended the funerals of men shot down in their own dooryards, he had witnessed the trials of the killers. He had grown up with the settled conviction that other men's quarrels did not concern him so long as he was not directly involved, and that what did not concern him he had no right to discuss. If he stood aside and let violence stalk by unhindered, he was merely doing what he had been taught to do from the time he could walk. \"Mind your own business and let other folks do the same,\" had been the family slogan in Lone's home. There had been nothing in Lone's later life to convince him that minding his own business was not a very good habit. It had grown to be second nature,--and it had made him a good man for the Sawtooth Cattle Company to have on its pay roll.  Just now Lone was stirred beyond his usual depth of emotion, and it was not altogether the sight of Fred Thurman's battered body that unnerved him. He wanted to believe that Thurman's death was purely an accident,--the accident it appeared. But Lorraine and the telltale hoofprints by the rock compelled him to believe that it was not an accident. He knew that if he examined carefully enough Fred Thurman's body he would find the mark of a bullet. He was tempted to look, and yet he did not want to know. It was no business of his; it would be foolish to let it become his business.  \"He's too dead to care now how it happened--and it would only stir up trouble,\" he finally decided and turned his eyes away.  He pulled the twisted foot from the stirrup, left the body where it lay, and led the blaze-faced horse to a tree and tied it securely. He took off his coat and spread it over the head and shoulders of the dead man, weighted the edges with rocks and rode away.  Halfway up the hill he left the road and took a narrow trail through the sage, a short-cut that would save him a couple of miles.  The trail crossed the ridge half a mile beyond Rock City, dipping into the lower end of the small gulch where he had overtaken the girl. The place recalled with fresh vividness, her first words to him: \"Are _you_ the man I saw shoot that other man and fasten his foot in the stirrup?\" Lone shivered and threw away the cigarette he had just lighted.  \"My God, that girl mustn't tell that to any one else!\" he exclaimed apprehensively. \"No matter who she is or what she is, she mustn't tell that!\"  \"Hello! Who you talking to? I heard somebody talking----\" The bushes parted above a low, rocky ledge and a face peered out, smiling good-humoredly. Lone started a little and pulled up.  \"Oh, hello, Swan. I was just telling this horse of mine all I was going to do to him. Say, you're a chancey bird, Swan, yelling from the brush, like that. Some folks woulda taken a shot at you.\"  \"Then they'd hit me, sure,\" Swan observed, letting himself down into the trail. He, too, was wet from his hat crown to his shoes, that squelched when he landed lightly on his toes. \"Anybody would be ashamed to shoot at a mark so large as I am. I'd say they're poor shooters.\" And he added irrelevantly, as he held up a grayish pelt, \"I got that coyote I been chasing for two weeks. He was sure smart. He had me guessing. But I made him guess some, maybe. He guessed wrong this time.\"  Lone's eyes narrowed while he looked Swan over. \"You must have been out all night,\" he said. \"You're crazier about hunting than I am.\"  \"Wet bushes,\" Swan corrected carelessly. \"I been tramping since daylight. It's my work to hunt, like it's your work to ride.\" He had swung into the trail ahead of John Doe and was walking with long strides,--the tallest, straightest, limberest young Swede in all the country. He had the bluest eyes, the readiest smile, the healthiest color, the sunniest hair and disposition the Sawtooth country had seen for many a day. He had homesteaded an eighty-acre claim on the south side of Bear Top and had by that means gained possession of two living springs and the only accessible portion of Wilder Creek where it crossed the meadow called Skyline before it plunged into a gulch too narrow for cattle to water with any safety.  The Sawtooth Cattle Company had for years \"covered\" that eighty-acre patch of government land, never dreaming that any one would ever file on it. Swan Vjolmar was there and had his log cabin roofed and ready for the door and windows before the Sawtooth discovered his presence. Now, nearly a year afterwards, he was accepted in a tolerant, half-friendly spirit. He had not objected to the Sawtooth cattle which still watered at Skyline Meadow. He was a \"Government hunter\" and he had killed many coyotes and lynx and even a mountain lion or two. Lone wondered sometimes what the Sawtooth meant to do about the Swede, but so far the Sawtooth seemed inclined to do nothing at all, evidently thinking his war on animal pests more than atoned for his effrontery in taking Skyline as a homestead. When he had proven up on his claim they would probably buy him out and have the water still.  \"Well, what do you know?\" Swan turned his head to inquire abruptly. \"You're pretty quiet.\"  Lone roused himself. \"Fred Thurman's been dragged to death by that damned flighty horse of his,\" he said. \"I found him in the brush this side of Granite Creek. Had his foot caught in the stirrup. I thought I'd best leave him there till the coroner can view him.\"  Swan stopped short in the trail and turned facing Lone. \"Last night my dog Yack whines to go out. He went and sat in a place where he looks down on the walley, and he howled for half an hour. I said then that somebody in the walley has died. That dog is something queer about it. He knows things.\"  \"I'm going to the Sawtooth,\" Lone told him. \"I can telephone to the coroner from there. Anybody at Thurman's place, do you know?\"  Swan shook his head and started again down the winding, steep trail. \"I don't hunt over that way for maybe a week. That's too bad he's killed. I like Fred Thurman. He's a fine man, you bet.\"  \"He was,\" said Lone soberly. \"It's a damn shame he had to go--like that.\"  Swan glanced back at him, studied Lone's face for an instant and turned into a tributary gully where a stream trickled down over water-worn rocks. \"Here I leave you,\" he volunteered, as Lone came abreast of him. \"A coyote's crossed up there, and I maybe find his tracks. I could go do chores for Fred Thurman if nobody's there. Should I do that? What you say, Lone?\"  \"You might drift around by there if it ain't too much out of your way, and see if he's got a man on the ranch,\" Lone suggested. \"But you better not touch anything in the house, Swan. The coroner'll likely appoint somebody to look around and see if he's got any folks to send his stuff to. Just feed any stock that's kept up, if nobody's there.\"  \"All right,\" Swan agreed readily. \"I'll do that, Lone. Good-by.\"  Lone nodded and watched him climb the steep slope of the gulch on the side toward Thurman's ranch. Swan climbed swiftly, seeming to take no thought of where he put his feet, yet never once slipping or slowing. In two minutes he was out of sight, and Lone rode on moodily, trying not to think of Fred Thurman, trying to shut from his mind the things that wild-eyed, hoarse-voiced girl had told him.  \"Lone, you mind your own business,\" he advised himself once. \"You don't know anything that's going to do any one any good, and what you don't know there's no good guessing. But that girl--she mustn't talk like that!\"  Of Swan he scarcely gave a thought after the Swede had disappeared, yet Swan was worth a thought or two, even from a man who was bent on minding his own business. Swan had no sooner climbed the gulch toward Thurman's claim than he proceeded to descend rather carefully to the bottom again, walk along on the rocks for some distance and climb to the ridge whose farther slope led down to Granite Creek. He did not follow the trail, but struck straight across an outcropping ledge, descended to Granite Creek and strode along next the hill where the soil was gravelly and barren. When he had gone some distance, he sat down and took from under his coat two huge, crudely made moccasins of coyote skin. These he pulled on over his shoes, tied them around his ankles and went on, still keeping close under the hill.  He reached the place where Fred Thurman lay, stood well away from the body and studied every detail closely. Then, stepping carefully on trampled brush and rocks, he approached and cautiously lifted Lone's coat. It was not a pretty sight, but Swan's interest held him there for perhaps ten minutes, his eyes leaving the body only when the blaze-faced horse moved. Then Swan would look up quickly at the horse, seem reassured when he saw that the animal was not watching anything at a distance, and return to his curious task. Finally he drew the coat back over the head and shoulders, placed each stone exactly as he had found it and went up to the horse, examining the saddle rather closely. After that he retreated as carefully as he had approached. When he had gone half a mile or so upstream he found a place where he could wash his hands"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19166"],["title","The Quirt (#7)"],["body","wetting his moccasins, returned to the rocky hillside and took off the clumsy footgear and stowed them away under his coat. Then with long strides that covered the ground as fast as a horse could do without loping, Swan headed as straight as might be for the Thurman ranch.  About noon Swan approached the crowd of men and a few women who stood at a little distance and whispered together, with their faces averted from the body around which the men stood grouped. The news had spread as such news will, even in a country so sparsely settled as the Sawtooth. Swan counted forty men,--he did not bother with the women. Fred Thurman had been known to every one of them. Some one had spread a piece of canvas over the corpse, and Swan did not go very near. The blaze-faced horse had been led farther away and tied to a cottonwood, where some one had thrown down a bundle of hay. The Sawtooth country was rather punctilious in its duty toward the law, and it was generally believed that the coroner would want to see the horse that had caused the tragedy.  Half an hour after Swan arrived, the coroner came in a machine, and with him came the sheriff. The coroner, an important little man, examined the body, the horse and the saddle, and there was the usual formula of swearing in a jury. The inquest was rather short, since there was only one witness to testify, and Lone merely told how he had discovered the horse there by the creek, and that the body had not been moved from where he found it.  Swan went over to where Lone, anxious to get away from the place, was untying his horse after the jury had officially named the death an accident.  \"I guess those horses could be turned loose,\" he began without prelude. \"What you think, Lone? I been to Thurman's ranch, and I don't find anybody. Some horses in a corral, and pigs in a pen, and chickens. I guess Thurman was living alone. Should I tell the coroner that?\"  \"I dunno,\" Lone replied shortly. \"You might speak to the sheriff. I reckon he's the man to take charge of things.\"  \"It's bad business, getting killed,\" Swan said vaguely. \"It makes me feel damn sorry when I go to that ranch. There's the horses waiting for breakfast--and Thurman, he's dead over here and can't feed his pigs and his chickens. It's a white cat over there that comes to meet me and rubs my leg and purrs like it's lonesome. That's a nice ranch he's got, too. Now what becomes of that ranch? What you think, Lone?\"  \"Hell, how should I know?\" Lone scowled at him from the saddle and rode away, leaving Swan standing there staring after him. He turned away to find the sheriff and almost collided with Brit Hunter, who was glancing speculatively from him to Lone Morgan. Swan stopped and put out his hand to shake.  \"Lone says I should tell the sheriff I could look after Fred Thurman's ranch. What you think, Mr. Hunter?\"  \"Good idea, I guess. Somebody'll have to. They can't----\" He checked himself. \"You got a horse? I'll ride over with yuh, maybe.\"  \"I got legs,\" Swan returned laconically. \"They don't get scared, Mr. Hunter, and maybe kill me sometime. You could tell the sheriff I'm government hunter and honest man, and I take good care of things. You could do that, please?\"  \"Sure,\" said Brit and rode over to where the sheriff was standing.  The sheriff listened, nodded, beckoned to Swan. \"The court'll have to settle up the estate and find his heirs, if he's got any. But you look after things--what's your name? Vjolmar--how yuh spell it? I'll swear you in as a deputy. Good Lord, you're a husky son-of-a-gun!\" The sheriff's eyes went up to Swan's hat crown, descended to his shoulders and lingered there admiringly for a moment, traveled down his flat, hard-muscled body and his straight legs. \"I'll bet you could put up some fight, if you had to,\" he commented.  Swan grinned good-humoredly, glanced conscience-stricken at the covered figure on the ground and straightened his face decorously.  \"I could lick you good,\" he admitted in a stage whisper. \"I'm a son-off-a-gun all right--only I don't never get mad at somebody.\"  Brit Hunter smiled at that, it was so like Swan Vjolmar. But when they were halfway to Thurman's ranch--Brit on horseback and Swan striding easily along beside him, leading the blaze-faced horse, he glanced down at Swan's face and wondered if Swan had not lied a little.  \"What's on your mind, Swan?\" he asked abruptly.  Swan started and looked up at him, glanced at the empty hills on either side, and stopped still in the trail.  \"Mr. Hunter, you been longer in the country than I have been. You seen some good riding, I bet. Maybe you see some men ride backwards on a horse?\"  Brit looked at him uncomprehendingly. \"Backwards?\"  Swan led up the blaze-faced horse and pointed to the right stirrup. \"Spurs would scratch like that if you jerk your foot, maybe. You're a good rider, Mr. Hunter, you can tell. That's a right stirrup, ain't it? Fred Thurman, he's got his left foot twist around, all broke from jerking in his stirrup. Left foot in right stirrup----\" He pushed back his hat and rumpled his yellow hair, looking up into Brit's face inquiringly. \"Left foot in right stirrup is riding backwards. That's a damn good rider to ride like that--what you think, Mr. Hunter?\"     CHAPTER SIX  LONE ADVISES SILENCE   Twice in the next week Lone found an excuse for riding over to the Sawtooth. During his first visit, the foreman's wife told him that the young lady was still too sick to talk much. The second time he went, Pop Bridgers spied him first and cackled over his coming to see the girl. Lone grinned and dissembled as best he could, knowing that Pop Bridgers fed his imagination upon denials and argument and remonstrance and was likely to build gossip that might spread beyond the Sawtooth. Wherefore he did not go near the foreman's house that day, but contented himself with gathering from Pop's talk that the girl was still there.  After that he rode here and there, wherever he would be likely to meet a Sawtooth rider, and so at last he came upon Al Woodruff loping along the crest of Juniper Ridge. Al at first displayed no intention of stopping, but pulled up when he saw John Doe slowing down significantly. Lone would have preferred a chat with some one else, for this was a sharp-eyed, sharp-tongued man; but Al Woodruff stayed at the ranch and would know all the news, and even though he might give it an ill-natured twist, Lone would at least know what was going on. Al hailed him with a laughing epithet.  \"Say, you sure enough played hell all around, bringin' Brit Hunter's girl to the Sawtooth!\" he began, chuckling as if he had some secret joke. \"Where'd you pick her up, Lone? She claims you found her at Rock City. That right?\"  \"No, it ain't right,\" Lone denied promptly, his dark eyes meeting Al's glance steadily. \"I found her in that gulch away this side. She was in amongst the rocks where she was trying to keep outa the rain. Brit Hunter's girl, is she? She told me she was going to the Sawtooth. She'd have made it, too, if it hadn't been for the storm. She got as far as the gulch, and the lightning scared her from going any farther.\" He offered Al his tobacco sack and fumbled for a match. \"I never knew Brit Hunter had a girl.\"  \"Nor me,\" Al said and sifted tobacco into a cigarette paper. \"Bob, he drove her over there yesterday. Took him close to all day to make the trip--and Bob, he claims to hate women!\"  \"So would I, if I'd got stung for fifty thousand. She ain't that kind. She's a nice girl, far as I could tell. She got well, all right, did she?\"  \"Yeah--only she was still coughing some when she left the ranch. She like to of had pneumonia, I guess. Queer how she claimed she spent the night in Rock City, ain't it?\"  \"No,\" Lone answered judicially, \"I don't know as it's so queer. She never realized how far she'd walked, I reckon. She was plumb crazy when I found her. You couldn't take any stock in what she said. Say, you didn't see that bay I was halter-breaking, did yuh, Al? He jumped the fence and got away on me, day before yesterday. I'd like to catch him up again. He'll make a good horse.\"  Al had not seen the bay, and the talk tapered off desultorily to a final \"So-long, see yuh later.\" Lone rode on, careful not to look back. So she was Brit Hunter's girl! Lone whistled softly to himself while he studied this new angle of the problem,--for a problem he was beginning to consider it. She was Brit Hunter's girl, and she had told them at the Sawtooth that she had spent the night at Rock City. He wondered how much else she had told; how much she remembered of what she had told him.  He reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a round leather purse with a chain handle. It was soiled and shrunken with its wetting, and the clasp had flecks of rust upon it. What it contained Lone did not know. Virginia had taught him that a man must not be curious about the personal belongings of a woman. Now he turned the purse over, tried to rub out the stiffness of the leather, and smiled a little as he dropped it back into his pocket.  \"I've got my calling card,\" he said softly to John Doe. \"I reckon I had the right hunch when I didn't turn it over to Mrs. Hawkins. I'll ask her again about that grip she said she hid under a bush. I never heard about any of the boys finding it.\"  His thoughts returned to Al Woodruff and stopped there. Determined still to attend strictly to his own affairs, his thoughts persisted in playing truant and in straying to a subject he much preferred not to think of at all. Why should Al Woodruff be interested in the exact spot where Brit Hunter's daughter had spent the night of the storm? Why should Lone instinctively discount her statement and lie whole-heartedly about it?  \"Now if Al catches me up in that, he'll think I know a lot I don't know, or else----\" He halted his thoughts there, for that, too, was a forbidden subject.  Forbidden subjects are like other forbidden things: they have a way of making"]]]
