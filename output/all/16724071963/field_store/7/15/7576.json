After that she let him spend long hours at the spring playing with boys and girls of his age. He didn't go into the meetings again. But he enjoyed the season. The watermelons, muskmelons, and ginger cakes were the best he had ever eaten.   IX  During the Christmas holidays the father got ready for a coon hunt in which the Boy should see his first battle royal in the world of sport.  Dennis came over and brought four extra dogs, two of his own and two which he had borrowed for the holidays.  A sudden change came over the spirit of old Boney--short for Napoleon Bonaparte. He understood the talk about coons as clearly as if he could speak the English language. He was in a quiver of eager excitement. He knew from the Boy's talk that he was going, too. He wagged his tail, pushed his warm nose under his little friend's arm, whining and trembling while he tried to explain what it meant to strike a coon's trail in the deep night, chase him over miles of woods and swamps and field, tree him and fight it out, a battle to the death between dog and beast!  At two o'clock, before day, his father's voice called and in a jiffy he was down the ladder, his eyes shining. He had gone to sleep with his clothes on and lost no time in dressing.  Without delay the start was made. Down the dim pathway to the creek and then along its banks for two miles, its laughing waters rippling soft music amid the shadows, or gleaming white and mirror-like in the starlit open spaces.  In half an hour the stars were obscured by a thin veil of fleecy clouds, and, striking no trail in the bottoms, they turned to the big tract of woods on the hills and plunged straight into their depths for two miles.  \"Hush!\"  Tom suddenly stopped:  Far off to the right came the bark of a dog on the run.  \"Ain't that old Boney's voice?\" the father asked.  \"I don't think so,\" the Boy answered.  The note of wild savage music was one he had never heard before.  \"Yes it was, too,\" was the emphatic decision. He squared his broad shoulders and gave the hunter's shout of answer-joy to the dog's call.  Never had the Boy heard such a shout from human lips. It sent shivers down his spine.  The dog heard and louder came the answering note, a deep tremulous boom through the woods that meant to the older man's trained ear that he was on the run.  \"That's old Boney shore's yer born!\" the father cried, \"an' he ain't got no doubts 'bout hit nother. He's got his head in the air. The trail's so hot he don't have ter nose the ground. You'll hear somethin' in a minute when the younger pups git to him.\"  Two hounds suddenly opened with long quivering wails.  \"Thar's my dogs--they've hit it now!\" Dennis cried excitedly.  Another hound joined the procession, then another and another, and in two minutes the whole pack of eight were in full cry.  Again the hunter's deep voice rang his wild cheer through the woods and every dog raised his answering cry a note higher.  \"Ain't that music!\" Tom cried in ecstacy.  They stood and listened. The dogs were still in the woods and with each yelp were coming nearer. Evidently the trail led toward them, but in the rear and almost toward the exact spot at which they had entered the forest.  \"Just listen at old Boney!\" the Boy cried. \"I can tell him now. He can beat 'em all!\"  Loud and clear above the chorus of the others rang the long savage boom of Boney's voice, quivering with passion, defiant, daring, sure of victory! It came at regular intervals as if to measure the miles that separated him from the battle he smelled afar. He was far in the lead. He was past-master of this sport. The others were not in his class.  The Boy's heart swelled with pride.  \"Old Boney's showin' 'em all the way!\" he exclaimed triumphantly.  \"Yer can bet he always does that, Sonny!\" the father answered. \"That's a hot trail. Nigh ez I can figger we're goin' ter have some fun. There's more'n one coon travelin' over that ground.\"  \"How can you tell?\" Dennis asked incredulously.  \"Hit's too easy fer the other pups--they'd lose the scent now an' then ef they weren't but one. They ain't lost it a minute since they struck it--Lord, jest listen!\"  He paused and held his breath.  \"Did ye ever hear anything like hit on this yearth!\" Dennis cried.  Every dog was opening now at the top of his voice at regular intervals, the swing and leap of their bodies over the brush and around the trees registering in each stirring note.  Again Tom gave a shout of approval.  The sound of the leader's voice suddenly flattened and faded.  \"By Gum!\" the old hunter cried, \"they've left the woods, struck that field an' makin' for the creek! Ye won't need that axe ter-night, Dennis.\"  \"Why?\"  \"Wait an' see!\" was the short answer.  They hurried from the woods and had scarcely reached the edge of the field when suddenly old Boney's cry stopped short and in a moment the others were silent.  \"Good Lord, they've lost it!\" Dennis groaned.  And then came the quick, sharp, fierce bark of the leader announcing that the quarry had been located.  Tom gave a yell of triumph and started on a run for the spot.  \"Up one o' them big sycamores in the edge o' that water I'll bet!\" Dennis wailed.  \"You'll need no axe,\" was the older man's short comment.  They pushed their way rapidly through the cane to the banks of the creek and found the dogs scratching with might and main straight down into the sand about ten feet from the water's edge.  \"Well, I'll be doggoned,\" Dennis cried, \"if I ever seed anything like that afore! They've gone plum crazy. They ain't no hole here. A coon can't jist drap inter the ground without a hole.\"  The old hunter laughed:  \"No, but a coon mought learn somethin' from a beaver now an' then an' locate the door to his house under the water line an' climb up here ter find a safe place, couldn't he?\"  \"I don't believe it!\" Dennis sneered.  \"You'll have ter go to the house an' git a spade,\" Tom said finally. \"It'll take one ter dig a hole big enough ter ever persuade one er these dogs ter put his nose in that den. Hit ain't more'n a mile ter the house--hurry back.\"  Dennis started on a run.  \"Don't yer let 'em out an' start that fight afore I git here!\" he called.  \"You'll see it all,\" Tom reassured him.  He made the dogs stop scratching and lie down to rest.  \"Jest save yer strenk, boys,\" Tom cried. \"Yer'll need it presently.\"  They sat down, the father lit his pipe and told the Boy the story of a great fight he had witnessed on such a creek bank once before in his life.  Day was dawning and the eastern sky reddening.  The Boy stamped on the solid ground and couldn't believe it possible that any dog could smell game through six feet of earth.  He lifted Boney's long nose and looked at it curiously. His wonderful nostrils were widely distended and though he lay quite still in the sand on the edge of the hole his muscles were quivering with excitement and his wistful hound eyes had in them now the red glare of coming battle.  It was quick work when Dennis arrived to throw the sand and soft earth away and open a hole five feet in depth and of sufficient width to allow all the dogs to get foothold inside.  Suddenly the spade crashed through an opening below and the rasp of sharp desperate teeth and claws rang against its polished surface.  \"Did you hear that?\" Tom laughed.  Another spadeful out and they could be plainly seen. How many it was impossible to tell, but three pairs of glowing bloodshot eyes in the shadows showed plainly.  Tom straightened his massive figure and gave a shout to the dogs. They all danced around the upper rim of the hole and barked with fierce boastful yelps, but not one would venture his nose within two feet of those grim shining eyes.  \"Well, Dennis,\" Tom sighed, \"I reckon I'll have ter shove you down thar an' hold ye by the heels while yer pull one of 'em out!\"  \"I'll be doggoned ef yer do!\" he remarked with emphasis.  Tom laughed. \"You wuz afeared ye wouldn't git here in time ye know.\"  \"Oh, I'm in time all right!\"  The hunter put his hands in his pockets and gazed at the warriors below.  \"Waal, we'll try ter git a dog ter yank one of 'em out an' then they'll all come. But I have my doubts. I don't believe that Godamighty ever yet built a dog that'll stick his nose in that hole. Hit takes three dogs ter kill one coon in a fair fight. Old Boney's the only pup I ever seed do it by hisself. But it's askin' too much o' him ter stick his nose in a place like that with three of 'em lookin' right at him ready ter tear his eyes out. But they ain't nothin' like tryin'----\"  He paused and looked at the old warrior of a hundred bloody fields, pointed at the bottom of the hole and in stern command shouted:  \"Fetch 'em out, Bone!\"  With a deep growl the faithful old soldier sprang to the front. With teeth shining in white gleaming rows he scrambled within a foot of the opening of the den, circled it twice, his eyes fixed on the flashing lights below. They followed his every move. He tried the stratagem of right and left flank movements, but the space was too narrow. He dashed straight toward the opening once with a loud angry cry, hoping to get the flash of a coward's back. He met three double rows of white needle-like teeth daring him to come on.  He squatted flat on his belly and growled with desperate fury, but he wouldn't go closer. The hunter urged in vain.  \"Hit's no use!\" he cried at last. \"Jest ez well axe er dog ter walk into a den er lions. I don't blame him.\"  The Boy's pride was hurt.  \"I can make him bring one out,\" he said.  Tom shook his head:  \"Not much. Less see ye?\"  The Boy stepped down to the dog's side.  \"Look out, ye fool, don't let yer foot slip in thar!\" his father warned.  The Boy knelt beside the dog, patted his back and began to talk to him in low tense tones:  \"Fetch 'im out, Bone! Go after 'm! Sick 'em, boy, sick 'em!\"  Closer and closer the brave old fighter edged his way, only a low mad"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19135"],["title","The Southerner: A Romance of the Real Lincoln (#8)"],["body","answering to the Boy's urging. His eyes were blazing now in the red rays of the rising sun like two balls of fire. With a sudden savage plunge he hurled himself into the den and quick as a flash of lightning his short hairy neck gave a flirt, and a coon as large as one of the hounds whizzed ten feet into the air, and, with his white teeth shining, struck the ground, lighting squarely on his feet. A hound dashed for him and one slap from the long sharp claws sent him howling and bleeding into the canes.  But old Boney had watched him in the air, and, circling the pack that faced the coon, with a quick leap had downed him. Then every dog was with him and the battle was on. Eight dogs to one coon and yet so sharp were his claws, so keen the steel-like points of his teeth, he sometimes had four dogs rolling in agony beside the growling mass of fur and teeth and nails.  The fight had scarcely begun when one of the remaining coons leaped out of the den. Tom's watchful eye had seen him. He pulled three dogs from the first battle group and hurled them on the new fighter. He had scarcely started this struggle when the third sprang to the top of the earthen breastwork, surveyed the field and with sullen deliberation, trotted to the water's edge, jumped in and, placing two paws on a swaying limb, dared any dog to come.  Here was work for the veteran! Boney was the only dog in the pack who would dare accept that challenge. Tom choked him off the first coon, pulled him to the bank and showed him his enemy in the water. He looked just a moment at the snarling, daring mouth and made the plunge.  The boy had followed the dog and watched with bated breath. He circled the coon twice, swimming in swift graceful curves. But his enemy was too shrewd. A flank movement was impossible. The coon's fierce mouth was squarely facing him at every turn and the dog plunged straight on his foe.  To his horror the Boy saw the fangs sink into his friend's head, four sets of sharp claws circle his neck, a tense grey ball of fur hanging its dead weight below. The water ran red for a moment as both slowly sank to the bottom.  Eyes wide with anguish he heard his father cry:  \"By the Lord, he'll kill that dog shore--he's a goner!\"  \"No, he won't neither!\" the Boy shouted, leaping into the water where he saw them go down.  Before his father could warn him of the danger his head disappeared in the deep still eddy.  \"Look out for us, Dennis, with a pole I'm goin' ter dive fer 'em!\"  In a moment they came to the surface, the man holding the Boy, the Boy grasping his dog, the coon fastened to the dog's head.  \"Well, don't that beat the devil!\" Tom laughed, as he carried them to a little rocky island in the middle of the creek.  The Boy intent on saving his dog had held his breath and was not even strangled. The dog had buried his nose in the coon's throat and was chewing and choking with savage determination.  Tom stood over them now on the little island with its smooth stone-paved battle arena ringed with the music of laughing waters. He threw both hands above his shaggy head and yelled himself hoarse--the wild cry of the hunter's soul in delirious joy.  \"_Yaaaiih! Yaaaiiih!_\"  A moment's pause, and then the low snarl and growl and clash of tooth and claw! Again the hunter's gnarled hands flew over his head.  \"_Yaaaiih! Yaaaaiiih! Yaaiih! Yaaaaiiiihhh!!_\"  On the shore Dennis stood first over one group of swirling, rolling, snarling brutes, and then over the other, yelling and cheering.  The coon on the island suddenly broke his assailant's death-like grip, and, with a quick leap, reached the water. Boney was on him in a moment and down they went beneath the surface again.  The Boy sprang to the rescue.  His father brushed him roughly aside:  \"Keep out! I'll git 'em!\"  Three times the coon made the dash for deep water and three times Tom carried both dog and coon back to the little island yelling his battle cry anew.  The smooth stones began to show red. Fur and dog hair flew in little tufts and struck the ground, sometimes with the flat splash of red flesh.  The Boy frowned and his lips quivered. At last he could hold in no longer. Through chattering teeth he moaned:  \"He'll kill Boney, Pa!\"  \"Let him alone!\" was the sharp command. \"I never see sich a dog in my life. He'll kill that coon by hisself, I tell ye!\"  Again his enemy broke Boney's grim hold on his throat, sprang back four feet and, to the dog's surprise, made no effort to reach the water. Instead he stood straight and quivering on his hind legs and faced his enemy, his white needle-like fangs gleaming in two rows and his savage fore-claws opening and closing with deadly threat.  The old warrior, taken completely by surprise by this new stratagem of his foe, circled in a vain effort to reach the flank or rear. Each turn only brought them again face to face, and at last he plunged straight on the centre line of attack. With a quick side leap the coon struck the dog's head a blow with his claw that split his ear for three inches as cleanly and evenly as if a surgeon's knife had been used.  With a low growl of rage and pain, Boney wheeled and repeated his assault with the same results for the other ear. He turned in silence and deliberately crept toward his foe. There would be no chance for a side blow. He wouldn't plunge or spring. He might get another bloody gash, but he wouldn't miss again.  This time he found the body, they closed and rolled over and over in close blood-stained grip. For the first time Tom's face showed doubts, and he called to Dennis:  \"Choke off two dogs from that fust coon an' throw 'em in here!\"  They came in a moment and clinched with Boney's enemy. The charge of two new troopers drove the coon to desperation. The sharp claws flew like lightning. The new dogs ran back into the water with howls of pain and scrambled up the bank to their old job.  Boney paid no attention either to the unexpected assault of his friends or their ignoble desertion. Every ounce of his dog-manhood was up now. It was a battle to the death and he had no wish to live if he couldn't whip any coon that ever made a track in his path.  The Boy's pride was roused now and the fighting instinct that slumbers in every human soul flashed through his excited eyes. He drew near and watched with increasing excitement and joined with his father at last in shouts and cheers.  \"Did ye ever see such a dog!\" he cried through his tears.  \"He beats creation!\" was the admiring answer.  The Boy bent low over the squirming pair and his voice was in perfect tune with his dog's low growl:  \"Eat him up, Bone! Eat him alive!\"  \"Don't touch 'em!\" Tom warned. \"Let 'im have a fair fight--ef he don't kill that coon I'll eat 'im raw, hide an' hair!\"  Boney had succeeded at last in fastening his teeth in a firm grip on the coon's throat. He held it without a cry of pain while the claws ripped his ears and gashed his head. Deeper and deeper sank his teeth until at last the razor claws that were cutting relaxed slowly and the long lean body with its beautiful fur lay full length on the red-marked stones.  The dog loosed his hold instantly. His work was done. He scorned to strike a fallen foe. He started to the water's edge to quench his thirst and staggered in a circle. The blood had blinded him.  The Boy sprang to his side, lifted him tenderly in his arms, carried him to the water and bathed his eyes and head.  \"He's cut all to pieces!\" he sobbed at last. \"He'll die--I just know it!\"  \"Na!\" his father answered scornfully. \"Be all right in two or three days.\"  The Boy went back and looked at the slim body of the dead coon with wonder.  \"Why did this one fight so much harder than the ones on the bank?\" he asked thoughtfully.  \"'Cause she's their mother,\" Tom said casually, \"an' them's her two children.\"  Something hurt deep down in the Boy's soul as he looked at the graceful nose and the red-stained fur at her throat. He saw his mother's straight neck and head outlined again against the starlit sky the night she stood before him rifle in hand and shot at that midnight prowler.  His mouth closed firmly and he spoke with bitter decision:  \"I don't like coon hunting. I'm not coming any more.\"  \"Good Lord, Boy, we got ter have skins h'ain't we?\" was the hearty answer.  \"I reckon so,\" he sorrowfully admitted. But all the way home he walked in brooding silence.   X  The following winter brought the event for which the mother had planned and about which she had dreamed since her boy was born--a school!  The men gathered on the appointed day, cut the logs and split the boards for the house. Another day and it was raised and the roof in place.  Tom volunteered to make the teacher's table and chair and benches for the scholars. He had the best set of tools in the county and he wished to do it because he knew it would please his wife. There was no money in it but his life was swiftly passing in that sort of work. He was too big-hearted and generous to complain. Besides the world in which he lived--the world of field and wood, of dog and gun, of game and the open road was too beautiful and interesting to complain about it. He was glad to be alive and tried to make his neighbors think as he did about it.  When the great day dawned the young mother eagerly prepared breakfast for her children. She wouldn't allow Sarah to help this morning. It must be a perfect day in her life. She washed the Boy's face and hands with scrupulous care when the breakfast things were cleared away, and her grey eyes were shining with a joy he had never seen before. He caught her excitement and the spirit of it took possession of his imagination.  \"What'll school be like, Ma?\" he asked in a tense whisper.  \"Oh, this one won't be very exciting; maybe in a little room built of logs. But it's the beginning, Boy, of greater things. Just spelling, reading, writing and arithmetic now--but you're starting on the way that leads out of these silent, lonely woods into the"]]]
