Accordingly on hearing Theo's plea he packed his tackle, and with a gentle word of caution to the invalid to be careful during his absence, set forth with Mr. Croyden to fish Elk River.  It was no easy thing for Theo to play an unselfish part and see them start off. How he wished that he, too, were going! But for his own folly he might have gone. Well, he had no one to blame but himself, that was certain. Therefore he put as brave a front on the matter as he could, resolving to make the best of it and be cheerful.  It was not, however, much fun to be lying there in bed during those fine spring days. From his window he could see the blue waters of the lake between the aisles of straight pines. It was a glorious world if one could only be abroad in it. Even the glimpse he had of it from his bed was beautiful. But to lie still and look out upon this alluring scene was not a satisfying rôle for an active boy. In spite of the wood-carving, the books, the writing; even despite the time Franz could spare to entertain him the hours dragged pitifully. Furthermore, now that the severed bone had begun to knit he felt restless and uncomfortable.  Hence when on the afternoon of the third day he awoke from an uneasy doze to find his father standing beside him it was a joyful surprise.  \"Father!\" he cried.  \"Right here,\" came gruffly from the Doctor. \"Glad to have your old dad home again?\"  \"Glad? Well, I guess!\"  \"I am glad to see you again too, son. I've thought of you a hundred times. How did you get on?\"  \"All right, sir. Franz took fine care of me, and I found lots of things to do,\" answered Theo bravely. \"But it is much nicer when you are here than when you're not.\"  His father smiled.  \"You are a plucky youngster,\" he said huskily. \"No matter how silly and childish your accident was you certainly have shown yourself a man since. Look! Here comes Mr. Croyden to see you. He has brought you a fine four-pounder, the record trout of the catch.\"  Theo beamed.  During the time the fishermen had been gone he had sadly missed the delicacy of fresh fish.  \"Eating this trout will be the next best thing to pulling it in, Theo,\" said Mr. Croyden. \"I only wish you might have had that pleasure, too.\"  \"I shall be pretty glad to eat the trout, sir,\" Theo declared promptly.  \"We shall let Franz get to work cooking it then, right away, so to have it ready for your dinner,\" Dr. Swift said, passing out with the fish in his hand.  After the Doctor had gone Theo looked up into Mr. Croyden's face.  \"I suppose you are dreadfully tired after your tramp,\" he remarked.  \"I? Oh, no,\" was the instant answer. \"Why?\"  \"I--I--don't know,\" faltered Theo. \"I just wondered.\"  \"Wondered what?\"  \"Whether after dinner you would be too tired to come in and talk to me a little while?\"  \"No, indeed. I'd be glad to come,\" responded Mr. Croyden. \"I'll come and tell you all about our trip.\"  \"If you don't mind I'd rather you'd leave that to Dad, and instead tell me some more about china-making,\" Theo said naively.  Mr. Croyden seemed vastly amused at the remark.  \"Bless my soul! What a boy you are,\" he said. \"Of course I am perfectly willing to talk to you on anything you like. Would you rather hear about china than anything else?\"  \"Yes, sir, just now I should,\" came vigorously from Theo.  \"All righty, china it shall be, then! But I am surprised that you should be so much interested in it. How came you to be so eager to learn about pottery and porcelain?\"  \"I guess because you make it all so much like a story book,\" answered Theo frankly. \"How did you happen to know so much about it, Mr. Croyden?\"  \"Why, it chances to be my business, son,\" Mr. Croyden replied. \"In Trenton, New Jersey, where I live, we make quantities of earthenware and porcelain; more of it than anywhere else in the United States. That is the way I earn my money to come on fishing trips.\"  \"Oh, I see! Then of course it is no wonder that you know all about it!\" cried Theo.  \"I know some things, but not all,\" was Mr. Croyden's answer. \"However, since you like to hear about it I am ready and glad to tell you what I can. We will have a session on French pottery to-night, if you say so; there are some things I want you to know before we take up the making of the English wares.\"  \"Whatever you say!\" exclaimed Theo.  \"Very well. I'll be back after dinner, and unless your father wants you for something else we'll have a nice evening together before your bedtime.\"  Mr. Croyden was as good as his word.  Theo had just finished his share of the big trout when into his room came the china merchant.  \"Your father and Manuel are busy icing some fish to ship home, so here I am,\" he affirmed.  After dragging a steamer chair up to Theo's bedside and stretching himself comfortably in it the elder man began:  \"Most of the pottery of the seventeenth century was an outgrowth of the Italian Renaissance when all the arts such as painting, wood-carving, sculpture, literature, glass and pottery-making were revived. In France the attempt to imitate Italian Faenza ware gave rise to the word _faience_, a term applied to French porcelains made both from hard and soft paste. French potters at Nevers, spurred on by Dutch and Chinese products, began to turn out a type of pottery not unlike Delft, except that the method of coloring it was reversed, and instead of having blue figures on a white ground it had white figures on a background of blue. This innovation, however, was not an entirely new variety of pottery. It still remained for France to invent its own peculiar kind of ware, and this it soon did. Nevertheless you must not make the mistake of thinking that these first attempts were very far reaching, for on the contrary they were very limited. They are significant only because they are the beginnings of that wonderful art of porcelain-making which later the French carried to an amazing degree of perfection.\"  There was a moment's delay in the story while Mr. Croyden rearranged more comfortably the pillows behind Theo's head.  \"Is that better?\" he asked of the boy.  \"Lots better, thank you,\" said Theo gratefully.  \"All right, son. Then we'll go on. Two of the most important of these beginnings are the Henri Deux ware, as it is called; and the enamel work of Bernard Palissy.\"  \"We read about Palissy in school,\" put in Theo.  \"I am glad to hear that, for he was one of the three men whose names have come down to us as being most vitally connected with pottery and porcelain-making. But before we talk of him I am going to tell you just a little about the Henri Deux ware, sometimes known as Faience d'Orion. Very few pieces of it now remain; but for perfection of workmanship and beauty of quality it has never been approached. Just who made it we do not know; nor do we know anything of the conditions under which it was manufactured. Only about fifty pieces of it are in existence--half of them in England and half in France; and it is from these, and from vague historic hints, that we have welded together the rather uncertain tale that I am now to tell you.\"  A smile of anticipation passed over Theo's face.  \"Long ago there lived in France a wealthy woman named Helene d'Hengest, who was deeply interested in all the arts, and who owned a beautiful home known as Château d'Orion. Here she had a library, a rather rare possession in those days, and a librarian called Bernard. Now many persons think that it was this Bernard who was the maker of the now famous Henri Deux ware, or Faience d'Orion.\"  \"Why should they think that?\" questioned Theo.  \"Well, there are several excellent reasons,\" Mr. Croyden replied. \"One is that the ware shows traces of a book-binding tool. Book-binders, you know, use many small instruments to decorate or tool their leather. This faience was a ware of natural cream-colored clay, and upon it was tooled a flat design the hollows of which were filled in with darker clays that were afterward covered with a lead glaze. Infinite care and pains had evidently been expended upon each piece of the ware, such pains that it must have taken much time to complete even a single article. No manufacturer could have afforded to do this, and therefore the inference had been drawn that the pottery was made purely for pleasure by some one who had an abundance of leisure. Perhaps this very Bernard, the librarian, who may have become interested in the art as a recreation, and done the work in his idle hours.\"  \"What a funny thing to do as a pastime!\" exclaimed Theo.  \"No stranger than that now many persons take up metal work, wood-carving, or other of the so-called arts and crafts for diversion.\"  \"I suppose not,\" admitted Theo thoughtfully.  \"It certainly is possible such a thing might have happened even so long ago as the time when the Henri Deux ware was made. History offers us no aid in solving the puzzle, so we can only find an answer as best we may. The ware, however, is unique, and there is no mistaking it. Some of it bears the monogram of King Henry II, and that accounts for the name by which the product passes. There are authorities that assert the H does not stand for the king's name, but for Helene, mistress of the Château d'Orion; others declare the king's monogram was used merely to fix the date when the pottery was made. Hence you will find some china collectors calling it Henri Deux ware, and others speaking of it as Faience d'Orion; while still others refer to it as Saint Porchaire. When examining it it is interesting to notice how much finer the later pieces are than the earlier ones. Evidently Bernard, if Bernard it was, improved a great deal with practice.\"  It was obvious that Mr. Croyden had no more to say about the elusive Bernard, for he came to an abrupt stop.  Theo waited a second, and then remarked suggestively:  \"And Palissy?\"  \"Palissy? Oh, he was another matter altogether. What did you learn about him when you were"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19423"],["title","The Story of Porcelain (#8)"],["body","school?\"  \"Not much, I'm afraid,\" responded Theo with a shrug. \"At least I do not remember much of it now. The teacher told us that one day Palissy saw an enameled cup of Saracen workmanship and that he was so anxious to discover how the glaze on it was made that he worked years experimenting; he even chopped up all his furniture as fuel for his furnaces.\"  \"This is quite correct,\" smiled Mr. Croyden. \"I see you recall a good deal. What you have told me are the main facts of the story. Palissy did work fifteen years. He used every splinter of wood he could lay hands on as fuel, and indeed burned up every particle of his household furniture, until he had not a chair to sit upon. He spent every cent he had, too, until he was so poor that he could scarcely feed his family, and owed money to all his neighbors.\"  \"In the end did he find out how to make the enamel?\" came breathlessly from Theo.  \"No, not that particular kind of enamel the Moors made in Spain. That is the sad part of the story,\" replied Mr. Croyden. \"He did, however, find out by his experimenting how to get marvelous colored enamels of another kind, and this was a very important discovery. He colored his glazes before putting them over the clay, instead of using a white enamel and then painting it as had previously been done everywhere. So you see after all Palissy did a great deal for pottery-making, since up to this time no one had ever thought of coloring the glaze itself. He made many vases, platters, and covered dishes adorned with designs in this colored enamel, often putting on the cover of a dish a fruit or vegetable in relief, tinted in its natural colors. Much of this work now can be seen in the museums of France; but it never became a distinctive type of art. What we chiefly remember of Palissy is his introduction into china-making of these hitherto unknown colored enamels.\"  [Illustration: BURNED HIS CHAIRS \"HE USED EVERY SPLINTER OF WOOD\"]  \"What became of him?\" inquired Theo at last. \"Did he ever get any more money?\"  \"He had a strange life,\" mused Mr. Croyden. \"He was a Huguenot, and at that time the Catholic party was in power, and an edict went forth that all Huguenots should be killed. Many of them fled into other countries and thus escaped death. But Palissy refused to flee, and because he was a man skilled in pottery-making, one of the things France was eager to perfect, the king wanted to retain him in his kingdom. Therefore he took Palissy under his protection, and for a long time allowed him to work unmolested in a little building in the grounds of the Tuileries. But by and by the Catholic adherents of the king became too strong even for their royal master's control, and so insistently did they clamor for Palissy's death that the king was forced to send for the potter and beg him to renounce his Protestant faith. Now by this time Palissy was a white-haired man of eighty. Nevertheless when the king told him he must either recant or lose his life he did not flinch. Fearlessly he clung to his religion.\"  \"Did they kill him?\"  \"No. Perhaps it was because the people did not dare displease the king,\" answered Mr. Croyden. \"They did, however, imprison the old man in the Bastille and there, after years of confinement, he wasted away and died. It was probably only the influence of his royal patron that prevented him from being murdered in the first place. Both the Henri Deux ware and Palissy's colored enamels brought fame to France. In 1800 at Nevers, where the blue and white ware similar to Delft was made, there were twelve factories. Then there was a quaint pottery made at Beauvais with the coats of arms of France and Brittany upon it. At Rouen, too, an extensive pottery industry sprang up, and it was to these factories that in 1713 Louis XIV, when forced to pay his war debts, sent his silver service to be melted up and replaced by a less expensive earthenware dinner set. Some pieces marked with the fleur-de-lis, and probably remnants of this set, are to be found in French museums. There were various other small potteries in different parts of France: some at Marseilles, others at Moustiers and Nancy. There were a number in Paris itself. All of these were making a more or less fine variety of earthenware. But the time was not ripe for France's greatest contribution to china-making. Of that you shall hear some other day. Now have I not told you quite a long story?\"  \"A long one and a very good one,\" said Theo. \"I hope you'll tell me another very soon.\"  \"Will you never have enough of all this chinaware?\"  Laughingly Theo shook his head.  \"I'd like you to keep right on until----\"  \"Until you are on your feet again,\" interrupted Mr. Croyden teasingly. \"Then I suppose you will promptly run off and forget all about it.\"  \"Not at all, sir!\" contradicted Theo. \"I was going to say I wished you would keep on telling me about it until I got well and could go to see some of these potteries and porcelains made.\"  \"Oh-ho! So you want to come to Trenton and steal my business away from me, do you, you young rascal? We'll see about that.\"  With a broad smile Mr. Croyden rose and shaking his fist playfully at Theo sauntered out the door.     [Illustration]     CHAPTER VI  FROM VASES TO DRAIN-PIPES   During the week that followed neither Dr. Swift nor Mr. Croyden took any more long trips away from the camp. They went, to be sure, on short fishing excursions, often being absent an entire morning or afternoon; but they passed no nights away from Theo. The boy suspected that his father's reason for this decision was because for the last few days try as he would he had been unable to conceal how miserable and uncomfortable he felt. Dr. Swift, however, would not own that this was the cause of his loitering at home. He merely declared that when the near-at-hand sport was so good it was foolish to tramp ten miles to waylay some unwary and distant trout. And indeed this logic appeared to be sound, for not once did the anglers return from one of their brief tours that they did not bring with them baskets well lined with yellow perch, trout, or land-loch salmon.  As a consequence the Doctor managed to keep very close watch of his son, and Theo saw a great deal both of his father and Mr. Croyden.  The friendship of the latter for the sick lad was no empty pose.  He sincerely liked Theo--liked his manliness and his intelligence; his brave attempt at unselfishness; his boyish love of fun.  Mr. Croyden was very fond of boys and, in fact, often betrayed the circumstance that in reality he himself had never really grown up.  Accordingly he sought Theo out whenever he had leisure, and many a happy hour did the two spend together.  One day when he chanced to be sitting beside the invalid's couch Theo said:  \"You told me once that there were three famous potters in history, and that Palissy was one of them; who were the others?\"  \"If I should tell you their names and nothing more about them it would be only so much dry sawdust,\" was Mr. Croyden's reply. \"The only reason they were great was because of what they did; and that is a long story.\"  \"Too long to tell?\"  \"Too long to put in a nutshell.\"  \"Wouldn't you have time to tell me some of it now?\"  \"I might have time to tell you about one of the men, but not both; and even were I to tell you about one of them, in order to make you understand how truly great he was I should have to tell you much that happened before he began his pottery-making,\" answered Mr. Croyden slowly.  \"I shouldn't mind that at all,\" laughed Theo. \"The longer your stories are the better I like them.\"  Mr. Croyden smiled.  \"Suppose, then, we begin,\" he said, \"and I will try before luncheon to introduce you to our second great potter. But before I do this we must go back a little that you may recall exactly where we left off. While Holland was turning out its Delft ware; Italy its glazed terra-cotta; and France its Henri Deux and other enameled earthenwares, in the Low Countries and the German States a new variety of pottery with a coarse surface not unlike the porous skin of an orange was being made. This was known as Gres de Flandres, _gres_ meaning earthenware. The unique feature it possessed was not so much its orange-skin surface as the surprising method by which it was glazed. The ware itself was made on a potter's wheel often from the commonplace kinds of clay, such as are employed in making stone china; sometimes this was brown, sometimes gray, sometimes cream-colored. There was nothing original about the material employed. But afterward--then came the amazing thing! When the clay articles were put into the kiln to be fired a quantity of common salt was thrown in with them and this salt created a vapor which when it settled upon the ware fused with it, giving to the clay a coarse, porous-appearing surface.\"  \"How do you suppose anybody ever thought of using salt?\" inquired Theo.  \"I do not know. Probably the discovery, like so many others, was a mere happen-so. At any rate it was a fortunate happening, for immediately this method of glazing earthenware was carried to England, where Doulton of Lambeth began manufacturing some very beautiful gres. For gres can be of exquisite beauty as well as of most ordinary type. Do not forget that. The term serves to cover those opaque earthenwares which are fired until vitrification or an external glassing results. At first all styles of gres were called Gres de Flandres, but later the single term gres was given them. You will hardly be surprised when I tell you that those past masters in the art of every kind of pottery-making, the Chinese and Japanese, have given us our finest specimens of gres, some of them having designs of imitation jewels upon them; and others decorations of beautifully colored enamels. Next to these Oriental varieties Germany has always excelled in the making of gres. There is a great scope for artistic expression in this ware, a far broader range for merit than in many others.\"  "]]]
