Everywhere they turned, Rakkeed was at the bottom of their trouble--just in this case, where Keeluk was one of Rakkeed's followers.  His power seemed to be growing, too. There were rumors that he had been entertained at the palace in Keegark, just as he was usually entertained by the big shipowning nobles here at Konkrook; come to think of it, the last time here, he'd been guest of the Keegarkan ambassador. He went all over Ullr, crusading, traveling coolie-class in disguise on Company ships, according to their best information.  Blount sighed heavily. \"This damned dog business worries me.\"  \"Worries me, too,\" Harrington said. \"I'm fond of that mutt, and God only knows what sort of stuff he's been getting to eat.\"  \"I'm a lot more worried about why Keeluk was hiding him, and why he was willing to murder the only two Terrans on Konkrook who trust him, to prevent our finding out he had Stalin,\" Blount struck in.  Von Schlichten chain-lit another cigarette and stubbed out the old one. \"Maybe Keeluk turned him over to Rakkeed to kill before a congregation of his followers--killing us in effigy. Or maybe they figure we worship Stalin, and getting him would give them power over us. I wish I knew a little more about Ullran psychology.\"  \"One thing,\" Blount said. \"It doesn't take any Ullran psychologist to know about eighty per cent of them hate us poisonously.\"  \"Oh, rubbish!\" Harrington blew the exclamation out around his pipe stem with a gush of smoke. \"A few fanatics hate us, but nine-tenths of them have benefitted enormously from us.\"  \"And hate us more deeply with each new benefit,\" Blount added. \"They resent everything we've done for them.\"  \"Yes, this spaceport proposition of King Orgzild of Keegark looks like it, doesn't it?\" Harrington retorted. \"He hates us so much he's offered us a spaceport at his city....\"  \"At what cost?\" Blount asked. \"He takes the land from some noble he executes for treason and gives it to us--together with forced labor. We furnish everything else. We get a port we don't need, and he gets all the business it'll bring. In fact, considering that Rakkeed is a welcome guest there, I wonder if he isn't fomenting trouble here at Konkrook to make us move our main base to Keegark. He's so sure we'll accept already that he's started building two new power-reactors to handle the additional demand from increased business.\"  \"Where's he getting the plutonium?\" von Schlichten asked, suspiciously.  \"He just bought four tons of it from us, off the _City of Pretoria_,\" Harrington replied.  \"A hell of a lot of plutonium,\" Blount said. \"I wonder if he has any idea of what else plutonium can be used for?\"  \"Oh, God, I hope not!\" Harrington exclaimed. \"Bosh! What about those letters Keeluk gave the Quinton girl?\"  \"All addressed to rabidly anti-Terran Rakkeed disciples,\" von Schlichten replied. \"We couldn't find any indication of a cipher, but the gossip about Keeluk's friends might have had code-meanings. I'll have to advise her to have nothing to do with any of the people Keeluk gave her letters to.\"  \"Think she'll listen to you? These Extraterrestrial Rights Association people are a lot of blasted fanatics, themselves. They think we're a gang of bloody-fisted, flint-hearted imperialists.\"  \"Oh, they're not as bad as all that. Old Mohammed Ferriera's always been decent enough. And the Association's really done a lot of good in other places.\"  A calculating look came into Harrington's eye. \"She was going to Skilk, eh? And you're going there yourself, to investigate some of this Rakkeed worry of Eric's. Why not invite her along, and maybe you can plant a couple of ideas where they'll do the most good. We all know there are a lot of things at the polar mines that would look bad to anybody who didn't understand. And with all this trouble being stirred up now....\"  It was his first admission that there _was_ trouble, but von Schlichten let it pass. \"Her company wouldn't be any heavy cross to bear,\" he replied. \"I won't guarantee anything, of course....\"  The intercom-speaker on the table whistled, and Harrington flipped a switch and spoke into the box. \"Governor,\" a voice replied out of it, \"there's a geek procession just landed from a water-barge in front, coming up the roadway to Company House. A platoon of Jaikark's Household Guards with a royal litter, Spear of State, gift-litter, nobles and such.\"  \"Gurgurk with indemnity for the riot, eh? Let them in, give them an honor guard of Kragans, but keep their own gun-toters outside. Take them to Reception Hall until I signal from Audience Hall, then herd them in.\" He flipped back the switch and turned back. \"We'll have to let them wait or they'll think we're worried. But you see--everything's going along normal lines.\"  Blount nodded, but his face showed disbelief. And von Schlichten grumbled unhappily to himself, without knowing why, until they finally went out to the big Audience Hall to meet the delegation.  Governor-General Sidney Harrington, on the comfortably-upholstered bench on the dais of the Audience Hall, didn't look particularly regal. But then, to a Terran, any of the kings of Ullr would have looked like a freak birth in a lizard-house at a zoo; it was hard to guess what impression Harrington would make on the Ullran psychology.  He took the false palate and tongue-clicker, officially designated as an \"enunciator, Ullran\" and, colloquially, as a geek-speaker, out of his coat pocket and shoved it into his mouth. Von Schlichten and Blount put in theirs, and Harrington pressed the floor-button with his toe. After a brief interval, the wide doors at the other end of the hall slid open, and the Konkrookan notables, attended by a dozen Company native-officers and a guard of Kragan Rifles, entered. The honor-guard advanced in two columns; between them marched an unclad and heavily armed native carrying an ornate spear with a three-foot blade upright in front of him with all four hands. It was the Konkrookan Spear of State; it represented the proxy-presence of King Jaikark. Behind it stalked Gurgurk, the Konkrookan equivalent of Prime Minister or Grand Vizier; he wore a gold helmet and a thing like a string-vest made of gold wire, and carried a long sword with a two-hand grip, a pair of Terran automatics built for a hand with six-four-knuckled fingers, and a pair of matched daggers. He was considerably past the Ullran prime of life--seventy or eighty, to judge from the worn appearance of his opal teeth, the color of his skin, and the predominantly reddish tint of his quartz-speckles. The retinue of nobles behind Gurgurk ran through the whole spectrum, from a princeling who was almost oyster-gray to the Keegarkan Ambassador, who was even blacker and more red-speckled than Gurgurk.  Four slaves brought up in the rear, carrying an ornately inlaid box on poles. When the spear-bearer reached the exact middle of the hall, he halted and grounded his regalia-weapon with a thump. Gurgurk came up and halted a couple of paces behind and to the left of the spear, and most of the other nobles drew up in two curved lines some ten paces to the rear; the ambassador and another noble came up and planted themselves beside Gurgurk.         *       *       *       *       *  The Governor-General rose slowly and descended from the dais, advancing to within ten paces of the Spear, von Schlichten and Blount accompanying him.  \"Welcome, Gurgurk,\" Harrington gibbered through his false palate. \"The Company is honored by this visit.\"  \"I come in the name of my royal master, His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty, Jaikark the Seventeenth, King of Konkrook and of all the lands of the Konk Isthmus,\" Gurgurk squeaked and clicked. \"I have the honor to bring with me the Lord Ambassador of King Orgzild of Keegark to the court of my royal master.\"  \"And I,\" the ambassador said, after being suitably welcomed, \"am honored to be accompanied by Prince Gorkrink, special envoy from my master, His Royal and Imperial Majesty King Orgzild, who is in your city to receive the shipment of power-metal my royal master has been honored to be permitted to purchase from the Company.\"  More protocol about welcoming Gorkrink. Then Gurgurk cleared his throat with a series of barking sounds.  \"My royal master, His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty, is prostrated with grief,\" he stated solemnly. \"Were his sorrow not so overwhelming, he would have come in His Own Sacred Person to express the pain and shame which he feels that people of the Company should be set upon and endangered in the streets of the royal city.\"  \"The soldiers of His Sublime and Ineffable Majesty came most promptly to the aid of the troops of the Company, did they not, General von Schlichten?\" Harrington asked, solemn-faced.  \"Within minutes, Your Excellency,\" von Schlichten replied gravely. \"Their promptness, valor and efficiency were most exemplary.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Gurgurk spoke at length, expressing himself as delighted, on behalf of his royal master, at hearing such high praise from so distinguished a soldier. Eric Blount contributed a short speech, beseeching the gods that the deep and beautiful friendship existing between the Chartered Ullr Company and His Sublime etcetera would continue unimpaired. The Keegarkan Ambassador spoke his piece, expressing on behalf of King Orgzild the deepest regret that the people of the Company should be so molested, and managing to hint that things like that simply didn't happen at Keegark.  The Prince Gorkrink then spoke briefly, in sympathy. Von Schlichten noticed that a few of his more recent quartz-specks were slightly greenish in tinge, a sure sign that he had, not long ago, been exposed to the fluorine-tainted air which men and geeks alike breathed on Niflheim. When a geek prince hired out as a laborer for a year on Niflheim, he did so for only one purpose--to learn Terran technologies.  Gurgurk then announced that so enormous a crime against the friends of His"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19370"],["title","Ullr Uprising (#4)"],["body","etcetera had not been allowed to go unpunished, signalling behind him with one of his lower hands for the box to be brought forward. The slaves carried it to the front, set it down, and opened it, taking from it a rug which they spread on the floor. On this, from the box, they placed twenty-four newly severed opal-grinning heads, in four neat rows. They had all been freshly scrubbed and polished, but they still smelled like crushed cockroaches.  The three Terrans looked at them gravely. A double-dozen heads was standard payment for an attack in which no Terran had been killed. Ostensibly, they were the heads of the ringleaders; in practice, they were usually lopped from the first two-dozen prisoners or overage slaves at hand, without regard for whether the victims had ever heard of the crime they were expiating.  There was another long speech from Gurgurk, with the nobles behind him murmuring antiphonal agreement--standard procedure, for which there was a standard pun, geek chorus--and a speech of response from Sid Harrington. Standing stiffly through the whole rigamarole, von Schlichten waited for it to end, as, finally, it did.  They walked back from the door, whence they had escorted the delegation, and stood looking down at the saurian heads on the rug. Harrington raised his voice and called to a Kragan sergeant whose chevrons were painted on all four arms.  \"Take this carrion out and stuff it in the incinerator,\" he ordered.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Wait a minute,\" von Schlichten told the sergeant. Then he disgorged and pouched his geek-speaker. \"See that head, there?\" he asked, rolling it over with his toe. \"I killed that geek, myself, with my pistol. And Hid O'Leary stuck a knife in that one.\" He walked around the rug, turning heads over with his foot. \"This was a cut-rate head-payment; they just slashed off two-dozen heads at the scene of the riot. Six months ago, Gurgurk wouldn't have tried to pull anything like this. Now he's laughing up his non-existent sleeve at us.\"  \"That's what I've been preaching, all along,\" Eric Blount took up after him. \"These geeks need having the fear of Terra thrown into them.\"  \"Oh, nonsense, Eric; you're just as bad as Carlos, here!\" Harrington tut-tuted. \"Next, you'll be saying that we ought to depose Jaikark and take control ourselves.\"  \"Well, what's wrong with that, for an idea?\" von Schlichten demanded.  \"My God!\" Harrington exploded. \"Don't let me hear that kind of talk again! We're not _conquistadores_: we're employees of a business concern, here to make money honestly, by exchanging goods and services with these people....\"         *       *       *       *       *  He turned and walked away, out of the Audience Hall, leaving von Schlichten and Blount to watch the removal of the geek-heads.  \"You know, I went a little too far,\" von Schlichten confessed. \"Or too fast, rather.\"  \"We can't go too slowly, though,\" Blount replied.  Von Schlichten nodded seriously. \"Did you notice the green specks in the hide of that Prince Gorkrink?\" he asked. \"He's just come back from Niflheim. Probably on the _Canberra_, three months ago.\"  \"And he's here to get that plutonium, and ship it to Keegark on the _Oom Paul Kruger_,\" Blount considered. \"I wonder just what he learned, on Niflheim.\"  \"I wonder just what's going on at Keegark,\" von Schlichten said. \"Orgzild's pulled down a regular First-Century-model iron curtain. You know, four of our best native Intelligence operatives have been murdered in Keegark in the last three months, and six more have just vanished there.\"  \"Well, I'm going there in a few days, myself, to talk to Orgzild about this spaceport deal,\" Blount said. \"I'll have a talk with Hendrik Lemoyne and Colonel MacKinnon. And I'll see what I can find out for myself.\"  \"Well, let's go have a drink,\" von Schlichten suggested.  But he kept remembering the falsehood of Gurgurk's indemnity. When the Ullrans started making a mockery of such things, it was no time for Harrington's trusting policies. The smell of trouble was suddenly stronger in his nostrils.     IV   Von Schlichten and Blount entered the bar together. Going to a bartending machine, von Schlichten dialed the cocktail they had decided upon and inserted his key to charge the drinks to his account, filling a four-portion jug.  As they turned away, they almost collided with Hideyoshi O'Leary and Paula Quinton. The girl wore a long-sleeved gown to conceal a bandage on her right wrist, and her face was rather heavily powdered in spots; otherwise she looked none the worse for recent experiences. Von Schlichten invited her and her escort to join him and Blount. Colonel O'Leary was carrying a cocktail jug and a couple of glasses; finding a table out of the worst of the noise, they all sat down together.  \"I suppose you think it's a joke, our being nearly murdered by the people we came to help,\" Paula began, a trifle defensively.  \"Not a very funny joke,\" von Schlichten told her. \"It's been played on us till it's lost its humor.\"  \"Yes, geek ingratitude's an old story to all of us,\" Blount agreed. \"You stay on this planet very long and you'll see what I mean.\"  \"You call them that, too?\" she asked, as though disappointed in him. \"Maybe if you stopped calling them geeks, they wouldn't resent you the way they do. You know, that's a nasty name; in the First Century Pre-Atomic, it designated a degraded person who performed some sort of revolting public exhibition....\"  \"As far as that goes, you know what the geek name for a Terran is?\" Blount asked. \"_Suddabit_.\"  She looked puzzled for a moment, then slipped in her enunciator. Even in the absence of any native, she used her handkerchief to mask the act.  \"Suddabit,\" she said, distinctly. \"Sud-da-a-_bit_.\" Taking out the geek-speaker, she put it away. \"Why, that's exactly how they'd pronounce it!\"  \"And don't tell me you haven't heard it before,\" O'Leary said. \"The geeks were screaming it at you, over on Seventy-second Street, this afternoon. _Znidd suddabit_; kill the Terrans. That's Rakkeed the Prophet's whole gospel.\"  \"So you see,\" Eric Blount rammed home the moral, \"this is just another case of nobody with any right to call anybody else's kettle black.... Cigarette?\"         *       *       *       *       *  \"Thank you.\" She leaned toward the lighter-flame O'Leary had snapped into being. \"I suspect that of being a principle you'd like me to bear in mind at the Polar mines, when I see, let's say, some laborer being beaten by a couple of overseers with three foot lengths of three-quarter-inch steel cable.\"  \"If you think the natives who work at the mines feel themselves ill-treated, you might propose closing them down entirely and see what the native reaction would be,\" von Schlichten told her. \"Independently-hired free workers can make themselves rich, by native standards, in a couple of seasons; many of the serfs pick up enough money from us in incentive-pay to buy their freedom after one season.\"  \"Well, if the Company's doing so much good on this planet, how is it that this native, Rakkeed, the one you call the Mad Prophet, is able to find such a following?\" Paula demanded. \"There must be something wrong somewhere.\"  \"That's a fair question,\" Blount replied, inverting a cocktail jug over his glass to extract the last few drops. \"When we came to Ullr, we found a culture roughly like that of Europe during the Seventh Century Pre-Atomic. We initiated a technological and economic revolution here, and such revolutions have their casualties, too. A number of classes and groups got squeezed pretty badly, like the horse-breeders and harness-manufacturers on Terra by the invention of the automobile, or the coal and hydroelectric interests when direct conversion of nuclear energy to electric current was developed, or the railroads and steamship lines at the time of the discovery of the contragravity-field. Naturally, there's a lot of ill-feeling on the part of merchants and artisans who weren't able or willing to adapt themselves to changing conditions; they're all backing Rakkeed and yelling '_Znidd suddabit!_' now. But it is a fact, which not even Rakkeed can successfully deny, that we've raised the general living standard of this planet by about two hundred per cent.\"         *       *       *       *       *  Both jugs were empty. Colonel O'Leary, as befitted his junior rank, picked them up; after a good-natured wrangled with von Schlichten, Blount handed the colonel his credit-key.  \"The merchants in the North don't like us; beside spoiling the caravan-trade, we're spoiling their local business, because the landowning barons, who used to deal with them, are now dealing directly with us. At Skilk, King Firkked's afraid his feudal nobility is going to force a Runnymede on him, so he's been currying favor with the urban merchants; that makes him as pro-Rakkeed and as anti-Terran as they are. At Krink, King Jonkvank has the support of his barons, but he's afraid of his urban bourgeoisie, and we pay him a handsome subsidy, so he's pro-Terran and anti-Rakkeed. At Skilk, Rakkeed comes and goes openly; at Krink he has a price on his head.\"  \"Jonkvank is not one of the assets we boast about too loudly,\" Hideyoshi O'Leary said, pausing on his way from the table. \"He's as bloody-minded an old murderer as you'd care not to meet in a dark alley.\"  \"We can turn our backs on him and not expect a knife between our shoulders, anyhow,\" von Schlichten said. \"And we can believe, oh, up to eighty per cent of what he tells us, and that's sixty per cent better than any of the other native princes, except King Kankad, of course. The Kragans are the only real friends we have on this planet.\" He thought for a moment. \"Miss Quinton, are you doing sociographic research-work here, in addition to your Ex-Rights work?\" he asked. \"Well, let me advise you to pay some attention to the Kragans.\"  \"Oh, but they're just a parasite-race on the Terrans,\" Dr. Paula Quinton"]]]
