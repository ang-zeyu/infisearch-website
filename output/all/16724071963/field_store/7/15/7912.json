In Fig. 1 is shown an herbalist preparing a mixture.    [Illustration: Fig. 1.--Herbalist preparing medicine and treating   patient.]  The origin of the Midē´wiwin or Midē´ Society, commonly, though erroneously, termed Grand Medicine Society, is buried in obscurity. In the Jesuit Relations, as early as 1642, frequent reference is made to sorcerers, jugglers, and persons whose faith, influence, and practices are dependent upon the assistance of “Manitous,” or mysterious spirits; though, as there is no discrimination made between these different professors of magic, it is difficult positively to determine which of the several classes were met with at that early day. It is probable that the Jĕs´sakkīd´, or juggler, and the Midē´, or Shaman, were referred to.  The Midē´, in the true sense of the word, is a Shaman, though he has by various authors been termed powwow, medicine man, priest, seer, prophet, etc. Among the Ojibwa the office is not hereditary; but among the Menomoni a curious custom exists, by which some one is selected to fill the vacancy one year after the death of a Shaman. Whether a similar practice prevailed among other tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock can be ascertained only by similar research among the tribes constituting that stock.  Among the Ojibwa, however, a substitute is sometimes taken to fill the place of one who has been prepared to receive the first degree of the Midē´wiwin, or Society of the Midē´, but who is removed by death before the proper initiation has been conferred. This occurs when a young man dies, in which case his father or mother may be accepted as a substitute. This will be explained in more detail under the caption of Dzhibai´ Midē´wigân or “Ghost Lodge,” a collateral branch of the Midē´wiwin.  As I shall have occasion to refer to the work of the late Mr. W. W. Warren, a few words respecting him will not be inappropriate. Mr. Warren was an Ojibwa mixed blood, of good education, and later a member of the legislature of Minnesota. His work, entiled “History of the Ojibwa Nation,” was published in Vol. V of the Collections of the Minnesota Historical Society, St. Paul, 1885, and edited by Dr. E. D. Neill. Mr. Warren’s work is the result of the labor of a lifetime among his own people, and, had he lived, he would undoubtedly have added much to the historical material of which the printed volume chiefly consists. His manuscript was completed about the year 1852, and he died the following year. In speaking of the Society of the Midē´,[8] he says:    The grand rite of Me-da-we-win (or, as we have learned to term it,   “Grand Medicine,”) and the beliefs incorporated therein, are not yet   fully understood by the whites. This important custom is still   shrouded in mystery even to my own eyes, though I have taken much   pains to inquire and made use of every advantage possessed by speaking   their language perfectly, being related to them, possessing their   friendship and intimate confidence has given me, and yet I frankly   acknowledge that I stand as yet, as it were, on the threshold of the   Me-da-we lodge. I believe, however, that I have obtained full as much   and more general and true information on this matter than any other   person who has written on the subject, not excepting a great and   standard author, who, to the surprise of many who know the Ojibways   well, has boldly asserted in one of his works that he has been   regularly initiated into the mysteries of this rite, and is a member   of the Me-da-we Society. This is certainly an assertion hard to   believe in the Indian country; and when the old initiators or Indian   priests are told of it they shake their heads in incredulity that a   white man should ever have been allowed _in truth_ to become a member   of their Me-da-we lodge.    An entrance into the lodge itself, while the ceremonies are being   enacted, has sometimes been granted through courtesy; though this does   not initiate a person into the mysteries of the creed, nor does it   make him a member of the Society.      [Footnote 8: Op. cit., pp. 65, 66.]  These remarks pertaining to the pretensions of “a great and standard authority” have reference to Mr. Schoolcraft, who among numerous other assertions makes the following, in the first volume of his Information Respecting the Indian Tribes of the United States, Philadelphia, 1851, p. 361, viz:    I had observed the exhibitions of the Medawin, and the exactness and   studious ceremony with which its rites were performed in 1820 in the   region of Lake Superior; and determined to avail myself of the   advantages of my official position, in 1822, when I returned as a   Government agent for the tribes, to make further inquiries into its   principles and mode of proceeding. And for this purpose I had its   ceremonies repeated in my office, under the secrecy of closed doors,   with every means of both correct interpretation and of recording the   result. Prior to this transaction I had observed in the hands of an   Indian of the Odjibwa tribe one of those symbolic tablets of pictorial   notation which have been sometimes called “music boards,” from the   fact of their devices being sung off by the initiated of the Meda   Society. This constituted the object of the explanations, which, in   accordance with the positive requisitions of the leader of the society   and three other initiates, was thus ceremoniously made.  This statement is followed by another,[9] in which Mr. Schoolcraft, in a foot-note, affirms:    Having in 1823 been myself admitted to the class of a Meda by the   Chippewas, and taken the initiatory step of a _Sagima_ and   _Jesukaid_in each of the other fraternities, and studied their   pictographic system with great care and good helps, I may speak with   the more decision on the subject.      [Footnote 9: Op. cit., vol. 5, p, 71.]  Mr. Schoolcraft presents a superficial outline of the initiatory ceremonies as conducted during his time, but as the description is meager, notwithstanding that there is every evidence that the ceremonies were conducted with more completeness and elaborate dramatization nearly three-quarters of a century ago than at the present day, I shall not burden this paper with useless repetition, but present the subject as conducted within the last three years.  Mr. Warren truly says:    In the Me-da-we rite is incorporated most that is ancient amongst   them--songs and traditions that have descended not orally, but in   hieroglyphs, for at least a long time of generations. In this rite is   also perpetuated the purest and most ancient idioms of their language,   which differs somewhat from that of the common everyday use.  As the ritual of the Midē´wiwin is based to a considerable extent upon traditions pertaining to the cosmogony and genesis and to the thoughtful consideration by the Good Spirit for the Indian, it is looked upon by them as “their religion,” as they themselves designate it.  In referring to the rapid changes occurring among many of the Western tribes of Indians, and the gradual discontinuance of aboriginal ceremonies and customs, Mr. Warren remarks[10] in reference to the Ojibwa:    Even among these a change is so rapidly taking place, caused by a   close contact with the white race, that ten years hence it will be too   late to save the traditions of their forefathers from total oblivion.   And even now it is with great difficulty that genuine information can   be obtained of them. Their aged men are fast falling into their   graves, and they carry with them the records of the past history of   their people; they are the initiators of the grand rite of religious   belief which they believe the Great Spirit has granted to his red   children to secure them long life on earth and life hereafter; and in   the bosoms of these old men are locked up the original secrets of this   their most ancient belief.  *  *  *    They fully believe, and it forms part of their religion, that the   world has once been covered by a deluge, and that we are now living on   what they term the “new earth.” This idea is fully accounted for by   their vague traditions; and in their Me-da-we-win or religion,   hieroglyphs are used to denote this second earth.      [Footnote 10: Op. cit., p. 25.]  Furthermore,    They fully believe that the red man mortally angered the Great Spirit   which caused the deluge, and at the commencement of the new earth it   was only through the medium and intercession of a powerful being, whom   they denominate Manab-o-sho, that they were allowed to exist, and   means were given them whereby to subsist and support life; and a code   of religion was more lately bestowed on them, whereby they could   commune with the offended Great Spirit, and ward off the approach and   ravages of death.  It may be appropriate in this connection to present the description given by Rev. Peter Jones of the Midē´ priests and priestesses. Mr. Jones was an educated Ojibwa Episcopal clergyman, and a member of the Missasauga--i.e., the Eagle totemic division of that tribe of Indians living in Canada. In his work[11] he states:    Each tribe has its medicine men and women--an order of priesthood   consulted and employed in all times of sickness. These powwows are   persons who are believed to have performed extraordinary cures, either   by the application of roots and herbs or by incantations. When an   Indian wishes to be initiated into the order of a powwow, in the first   place he pays a large fee to the faculty. He is then taken into the   woods, where he is taught the names and virtues of the various useful   plants; next he is instructed how to chant the medicine song, and how   to pray, which prayer is a vain repetition offered up to the Master of   Life, or to some munedoo whom the afflicted imagine they have   offended.    The powwows are held in high veneration by their deluded brethren; not   so "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],["title","The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#5)"],["body","for their knowledge of medicine as for the magical power which   they are supposed to possess. It is for their interest to lead these   credulous people to believe that they can at pleasure hold intercourse   with the munedoos, who are ever ready to give them whatever   information they require.      [Footnote 11: History of the Ojebway Indians, London [1843(?)],     pp. 143,144.]  The Ojibwa believe in a multiplicity of spirits, or man´idōs, which inhabit all space and every conspicuous object in nature. These man´idōs, in turn, are subservient to superior ones, either of a charitable and benevolent character or those which are malignant and aggressive. The chief or superior man´idō is termed Ki´tshi Man´idō--Great Spirit--approaching to a great extent the idea of the God of the Christian religion; the second in their estimation is Dzhe Man´idō, a benign being upon whom they look as the guardian spirit of the Midē´wiwin and through whose divine provision the sacred rites of the Midē´wiwin were granted to man. The Ani´miki or Thunder God is, if not the supreme, at least one of the greatest of the malignant man´idōs, and it is from him that the Jĕs´sakkīd´ are believed to obtain their powers of evil doing. There is one other, to whom special reference will be made, who abides in and rules the “place of shadows,” the hereafter; he is known as Dzhibai´ Man´idō--Shadow Spirit, or more commonly Ghost Spirit. The name of Ki´tshi Man´idō is never mentioned but with reverence, and thus only in connection with the rite of Midē´wiwin, or a sacred feast, and always after making an offering of tobacco.  The first important event in the life of an Ojibwa youth is his first fast. For this purpose he will leave his home for some secluded spot in the forest where he will continue to fast for an indefinite number of days; when reduced by abstinence from food he enters a hysterical or ecstatic state in which he may have visions and hallucinations. The spirits which the Ojibwa most desire to see in these dreams are those of mammals and birds, though any object, whether animate or inanimate, is considered a good omen. The object which first appears is adopted as the personal mystery, guardian spirit, or tutelary daimon of the entranced, and is never mentioned by him without first making a sacrifice. A small effigy of this man´idō is made, or its outline drawn upon a small piece of birch bark, which is carried suspended by a string around the neck, or if the wearer be a Midē´ he carries it in his “medicine bag” or pinji´gosân. The future course of life of the faster is governed by his dream; and it sometimes occurs that because of giving an imaginary importance to the occurrence, such as beholding, during the trance some powerful man´idō or other object held in great reverence by the members of the Midē´ Society, the faster first becomes impressed with the idea of becoming a Midē´. Thereupon he makes application to a prominent Midē´ priest, and seeks his advice as to the necessary course to be pursued to attain his desire. If the Midē´ priest considers with favor the application, he consults with his confrères and action is taken, and the questions of the requisite preliminary instructions, fees, and presents, etc., are formally discussed. If the Midē´ priests are in accord with the desires of the applicant an instructor or preceptor is designated, to whom he must present himself and make an agreement as to the amount of preparatory information to be acquired and the fees and other presents to be given in return. These fees have nothing whatever to do with the presents which must be presented to the Midē´ priests previous to his initiation as a member of the society, the latter being collected during the time that is devoted to preliminary instruction, which period usually extends over several years. Thus ample time is found for hunting, as skins and peltries, of which those not required as presents may be exchanged for blankets, tobacco, kettles, guns, etc., obtainable from the trader. Sometimes a number of years are spent in preparation for the first degree of the Midē´wiwin, and there are many who have impoverished themselves in the payment of fees and the preparation for the feast to which all visiting priests are also invited.  Should an Indian who is not prompted by a dream wish to join the society he expresses to the four chief officiating priests a desire to purchase a mī´gis, which is the sacred symbol of the society and consists of a small white shell, to which reference will be made further on. His application follows the same course as in the preceding instance, and the same course is pursued also when a Jĕs´sakkīd´ or a Wâbĕnō´ wishes to become a Midē´.   MIDĒ´WIWIN.  The Midē´wiwin--Society of the Midē´ or Shamans--consists of an indefinite number of Midē´ of both sexes. The society is graded into four separate and distinct degrees, although there is a general impression prevailing even among certain members that any degree beyond the first is practically a mere repetition. The greater power attained by one in making advancement depends upon the fact of his having submitted to “being shot at with the medicine sacks” in the hands of the officiating priests. This may be the case at this late day in certain localities, but from personal experience it has been learned that there is considerable variation in the dramatization of the ritual. One circumstance presents itself forcibly to the careful observer, and that is that the greater number of repetitions of the phrases chanted by the Midē´ the greater is felt to be the amount of inspiration and power of the performance. This is true also of some of the lectures in which reiteration and prolongation in time of delivery aids very much in forcibly impressing the candidate and other observers with the importance and sacredness of the ceremony.  It has always been customary for the Midē´ priests to preserve birch-bark records, bearing delicate incised lines to represent pictorially the ground plan of the number of degrees to which the owner is entitled. Such records or charts are sacred and are never exposed to the public view, being brought forward for inspection only when an accepted candidate has paid his fee, and then only after necessary preparation by fasting and offerings of tobacco.  During the year 1887, while at Red Lake, Minnesota, I had the good fortune to discover the existence of an old birch-bark chart, which, according to the assurances of the chief and assistant Midē´ priests, had never before been exhibited to a white man, nor even to an Indian unless he had become a regular candidate. This chart measures 7 feet 1½ inches in length and 18 inches in width, and is made of five pieces of birch bark neatly and securely stitched together by means of thin, flat strands of bass wood. At each end are two thin strips of wood, secured transversely by wrapping and stitching with thin strands of bark, so as to prevent splitting and fraying of the ends of the record. Pl. III A, is a reproduction of the design referred to.  It had been in the keeping of Skwēkŏ´mĭk, to whom it was intrusted at the death of his father-in-law, the latter, in turn, having received it in 1825 from Badâ´san, the Grand Shaman and chief of the Winnibē´goshish Ojibwa.  It is affirmed that Badâ´san had received the original from the Grand Midē´ priest at La Pointe, Wisconsin, where, it is said, the Midē´wiwin was at that time held annually and the ceremonies conducted in strict accordance with ancient and traditional usage.  The present owner of this record has for many years used it in the preliminary instruction of candidates. Its value in this respect is very great, as it presents to the Indian a pictorial résumé of the traditional history of the origin of the Midē´wiwin, the positions occupied by the various guardian man´idos in the several degrees, and the order of procedure in study and progress of the candidate. On account of the isolation of the Red Lake Indians and their long continued, independent ceremonial observances, changes have gradually occurred so that there is considerable variation, both in the pictorial representation and the initiation, as compared with the records and ceremonials preserved at other reservations. The reason of this has already been given.  A detailed description of the above mentioned record, will be presented further on in connection with two interesting variants which were subsequently obtained at White Earth, Minnesota. On account of the widely separated location of many of the different bands of the Ojibwa, and the establishment of independent Midē´ societies, portions of the ritual which have been forgotten by one set may be found to survive at some other locality, though at the expense of some other fragments of tradition or ceremonial. No satisfactory account of the tradition of the origin of the Indians has been obtained, but such information as it was possible to procure will be submitted.  In all of their traditions pertaining to the early history of the tribe these people are termed A-nish´-in-â´-bēg--original people--a term surviving also among the Ottawa, Patawatomi, and Menomoni, indicating that the tradition of their westward migration was extant prior to the final separation of these tribes, which is supposed to have occurred at Sault Ste. Marie.  Mi´nabō´zho (Great Rabbit), whose name occurs in connection with most of the sacred rites, was the servant of Dzhe Man´idō, the Good Spirit, and acted in the capacity of intercessor and mediator. It is generally supposed that it was to his good offices that the Indian owes life and the good things necessary to his health and subsistence.  The tradition of Mi´nabō´zho and the origin of the Midē´wiwin, as given in connection with the birch-bark record obtained at Red Lake (Pl. III A), is as follows:  When Mi´nabō´zho, the servant of Dzhe Man´idō, looked down upon the earth he beheld human beings,"]]]
