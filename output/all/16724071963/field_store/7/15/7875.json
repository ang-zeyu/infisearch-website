In the words of the Saviour, \"salvation is of the Jews.\"[4]--The _second_ thing to remember is this: that the psychological type of the Galilean is still to be recognized, but it was only in its most degenerate form (which is at once maimed and overladen with foreign features) that it could serve in the manner in which it has been used: as a type of the _Saviour_ of mankind.--  [4] John iv, 22.  The Jews are the most remarkable people in the history of the world, for when they were confronted with the question, to be or not to be, they chose, with perfectly unearthly deliberation, to be _at any price_: this price involved a radical _falsification_ of all nature, of all naturalness, of all reality, of the whole inner world, as well as of the outer. They put themselves _against_ all those conditions under which, hitherto, a people had been able to live, or had even been _permitted_ to live; out of themselves they evolved an idea which stood in direct opposition to _natural_ conditions--one by one they distorted religion, civilization, morality, history and psychology until each became a _contradiction_ of its _natural significance_. We meet with the same phenomenon later on, in an incalculably exaggerated form, but only as a copy: the Christian church, put beside the \"people of God,\" shows a complete lack of any claim to originality. Precisely for this reason the Jews are the most _fateful_ people in the history of the world: their influence has so falsified the reasoning of mankind in this matter that today the Christian can cherish anti-Semitism without realizing that it is no more than the _final consequence of Judaism_.  In my \"Genealogy of Morals\" I give the first psychological explanation of the concepts underlying those two antithetical things, a _noble_ morality and a _ressentiment_ morality, the second of which is a mere product of the denial of the former. The Judaeo-Christian moral system belongs to the second division, and in every detail. In order to be able to say Nay to everything representing an _ascending_ evolution of life--that is, to well-being, to power, to beauty, to self-approval--the instincts of _ressentiment_, here become downright genius, had to invent an _other_ world in which the _acceptance of life_ appeared as the most evil and abominable thing imaginable. Psychologically, the Jews are a people gifted with the very strongest vitality, so much so that when they found themselves facing impossible conditions of life they chose voluntarily, and with a profound talent for self-preservation, the side of all those instincts which make for _décadence_--_not_ as if mastered by them, but as if detecting in them a power by which \"the world\" could be _defied_. The Jews are the very opposite of _décadents_: they have simply been forced into _appearing_ in that guise, and with a degree of skill approaching the _non plus ultra_ of histrionic genius they have managed to put themselves at the head of all _décadent_ movements (--for example, the Christianity of Paul--), and so make of them something stronger than any party frankly saying _Yes_ to life. To the sort of men who reach out for power under Judaism and Christianity,--that is to say, to the _priestly_ class--_décadence_ is no more than a means to an end. Men of this sort have a vital interest in making mankind sick, and in confusing the values of \"good\" and \"bad,\" \"true\" and \"false\" in a manner that is not only dangerous to life, but also slanders it.   25.  The history of Israel is invaluable as a typical history of an attempt to _denaturize_ all natural values: I point to five facts which bear this out. Originally, and above all in the time of the monarchy, Israel maintained the _right_ attitude of things, which is to say, the natural attitude. Its Jahveh was an expression of its consciousness of power, its joy in itself, its hopes for itself: to him the Jews looked for victory and salvation and through him they expected nature to give them whatever was necessary to their existence--above all, rain. Jahveh is the god of Israel, and _consequently_ the god of justice: this is the logic of every race that has power in its hands and a good conscience in the use of it. In the religious ceremonial of the Jews both aspects of this self-approval stand revealed. The nation is grateful for the high destiny that has enabled it to obtain dominion; it is grateful for the benign procession of the seasons, and for the good fortune attending its herds and its crops.--This view of things remained an ideal for a long while, even after it had been robbed of validity by tragic blows: anarchy within and the Assyrian without. But the people still retained, as a projection of their highest yearnings, that vision of a king who was at once a gallant warrior and an upright judge--a vision best visualized in the typical prophet (_i. e._, critic and satirist of the moment), Isaiah.--But every hope remained unfulfilled. The old god no longer _could_ do what he used to do. He ought to have been abandoned. But what actually happened? Simply this: the conception of him was _changed_--the conception of him was _denaturized_; this was the price that had to be paid for keeping him.--Jahveh, the god of \"justice\"--he is in accord with Israel _no more_, he no longer vizualizes the national egoism; he is now a god only conditionally.... The public notion of this god now becomes merely a weapon in the hands of clerical agitators, who interpret all happiness as a reward and all unhappiness as a punishment for obedience or disobedience to him, for \"sin\": that most fraudulent of all imaginable interpretations, whereby a \"moral order of the world\" is set up, and the fundamental concepts, \"cause\" and \"effect,\" are stood on their heads. Once natural causation has been swept out of the world by doctrines of reward and punishment some sort of _un_-natural causation becomes necessary: and all other varieties of the denial of nature follow it. A god who _demands_--in place of a god who helps, who gives counsel, who is at bottom merely a name for every happy inspiration of courage and self-reliance.... _Morality_ is no longer a reflection of the conditions which make for the sound life and development of the people; it is no longer the primary life-instinct; instead it has become abstract and in opposition to life--a fundamental perversion of the fancy, an \"evil eye\" on all things. _What_ is Jewish, _what_ is Christian morality? Chance robbed of its innocence; unhappiness polluted with the idea of \"sin\"; well-being represented as a danger, as a \"temptation\"; a physiological disorder produced by the canker worm of conscience....   26.  The concept of god falsified; the concept of morality falsified;--but even here Jewish priest-craft did not stop. The whole history of Israel ceased to be of any value: out with it!--These priests accomplished that miracle of falsification of which a great part of the Bible is the documentary evidence; with a degree of contempt unparalleled, and in the face of all tradition and all historical reality, they translated the past of their people into _religious_ terms, which is to say, they converted it into an idiotic mechanism of salvation, whereby all offences against Jahveh were punished and all devotion to him was rewarded. We would regard this act of historical falsification as something far more shameful if familiarity with the _ecclesiastical_ interpretation of history for thousands of years had not blunted our inclinations for uprightness _in historicis_. And the philosophers support the church: the _lie_ about a \"moral order of the world\" runs through the whole of philosophy, even the newest. What is the meaning of a \"moral order of the world\"? That there is a thing called the will of God which, once and for all time, determines what man ought to do and what he ought not to do; that the worth of a people, or of an individual thereof, is to be measured by the extent to which they or he obey this will of God; that the destinies of a people or of an individual are _controlled_ by this will of God, which rewards or punishes according to the degree of obedience manifested.--In place of all that pitiable lie _reality_ has this to say: the _priest_, a parasitical variety of man who can exist only at the cost of every sound view of life, takes the name of God in vain: he calls that state of human society in which he himself determines the value of all things \"the kingdom of God\"; he calls the means whereby that state of affairs is attained \"the will of God\"; with cold-blooded cynicism he estimates all peoples, all ages and all individuals by the extent of their subservience or opposition to the power of the priestly order. One observes him at work: under the hand of the Jewish priesthood the _great_ age of Israel became an age of decline; the Exile, with its long series of misfortunes, was transformed into a _punishment_ for that great age--during which priests had not yet come into existence. Out of the powerful and _wholly free_ heroes of Israel's history they fashioned, according to their changing needs, either wretched bigots and hypocrites or men entirely \"godless.\" They reduced every great event to the idiotic formula: \"obedient _or_ disobedient to God.\"--They went a step further: the \"will of God\" (in other words some means necessary for preserving the power of the priests) had to be _determined_--and to this end they had to have a \"revelation.\" In plain English, a gigantic literary fraud had to be perpetrated, and \"holy scriptures\" had to be concocted--and so, with the utmost hierarchical pomp, and days of penance and much lamentation over the long days of \"sin\" now ended, they were duly published. The \"will of God,\" it appears, had long stood like a rock; the trouble was that mankind had neglected the \"holy scriptures\".... But the \"will of God\" had already been revealed to Moses...."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19331"],["title","Ceremonial of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians (#0)"],["body","of Hasjelti Dailjis and Mythical Sand Painting of the Navajo Indians   by James Stevenson     Edition 1, (September 2006)      CONTENTS   INTRODUCTION.

During my visit to the Southwest, in the summer of 1885, it was my good fortune to arrive at the Navajo Reservation a few days before the commencement of a Navajo healing ceremonial. Learning of the preparation for this, I decided to remain and observe the ceremony, which was to continue nine days and nights. The occasion drew to the place some 1,200 Navajos. The scene of the assemblage was an extensive plateau near the margin of Keam’s Canyon, Arizona.  A variety of singular and interesting occurrences attended this great event—mythologic rites, gambling, horse and foot racing, general merriment, and curing the sick, the latter being the prime cause of the gathering. A man of distinction in the tribe was threatened with loss of vision from inflammation of the eyes, having looked upon certain masks with an irreligious heart. He was rich and had many wealthy relations, hence the elaborateness of the ceremony of healing. A celebrated theurgist was solicited to officiate, but much anxiety was felt when it was learned that his wife was pregnant. A superstition prevails among the Navajo that a man must not look upon a sand painting when his wife is in a state of gestation, as it would result in the loss of the life of the child. This medicine man, however, came, feeling that he possessed ample power within himself to avert such calamity by administering to the child immediately after its birth a mixture in water of all the sands used in the painting. As I have given but little time to the study of Navajo mythology, I can but briefly mention such events as I witnessed, and record the myths only so far as I was able to collect them hastily. I will first describe the ceremony of Yebitchai and give then the myths (some complete and others incomplete) explanatory of the gods and genii figuring in the Hasjelti Dailjis (dance of Hasjelti) and in the nine days’ ceremonial, and then others independent of these. The ceremony is familiarly called among the tribe, \"Yebitchai,\" the word meaning the giant’s uncle. The name was originally given to the ceremonial to awe the children who, on the eighth day of the ceremony, are initiated into some of its mysteries and then for the first time are informed that the characters appearing in the ceremony are not real gods, but only their representatives. There is good reason for believing that their ideas in regard to the sand paintings were obtained from the Pueblo tribes, who in the past had elaborated sand paintings and whose work at present in connection with most of their medicine ceremonies is of no mean order. The Mission Indians of southern California also regard sand paintings as among the important features in their medicine practices. While the figures of the mythical beings represented by the Navajo are no doubt of their own conception, yet I discovered that all their medicine tubes and offerings were similar to those in use by the Zuñi. Their presence among the Navajo can be readily explained by the well known fact that it was the custom among Indians of different tribes to barter and exchange medicine songs, ceremonies, and the paraphernalia accompanying them. The Zuñi and Tusayan claim that the Navajo obtained the secrets of the Pueblo medicine by intruding upon their ceremonials or capturing a pueblo, and that they appropriated whatever suited their fancy.                          [Illustration: Figure 115]                          FIG. 115. Exterior lodge.   My explanation of the ceremonial described is by authority of the priest doctor who managed the whole affair and who remained with me five days after the ceremonial for this special purpose. Much persuasion was required to induce him to stay, though he was most anxious that we should make no mistake. He said:       My wife may suffer and I should be near her; a father’s eyes     should be the first to look upon his child; it is like sunshine in     the father’s heart; the father also watches his little one to see     the first signs of understanding, and observes the first steps of     his child, that too is a bright light in the father’s heart, but     when the little one falls, it strikes the father’s heart hard.   The features of this ceremonial which most surprise the white spectator are its great elaborateness, the number of its participants and its prolongation through many days for the purpose of restoring health to a single member of the tribe.      CONSTRUCTION OF THE MEDICINE LODGE.   A rectangular parallelogram was marked off on the ground, and at each corner was firmly planted a forked post extending 10 feet above the surface, and on these were laid 4 horizontal beams, against which rested poles thickly set at an angle of about 20°, while other poles were placed horizontally across the beams forming a support for the covering. The poles around the sides were planted more in an oval than a circle and formed an interior space of about 35 by 30 feet in diameter. On the east side of the lodge was an entrance supported by stakes and closed with a buffalo robe, and the whole structure was then thickly covered first with boughs, then with sand, giving it the appearance of a small earth mound.                          [Illustration: Figure 116]                          FIG. 116. Interior lodge.      FIRST DAY.     PERSONATORS OF THE GODS.   The theurgist or song-priest arrived at noon on the 12th of October, 1885. Almost immediately after his arrival we boldly entered the medicine lodge, accompanied by our interpreter, Navajo John, and pleaded our cause. The stipulation of the medicine man was that we should make no mistakes and thereby offend the gods, and to avoid mistakes we must hear all of his songs and see all of his medicines, and he at once ordered some youths to prepare a place for our tent near the lodge. During the afternoon of the 12th those who were to take part in the ceremonial received orders and instructions from the song-priest. One man went to collect twigs with which to make twelve rings, each 6 inches in diameter. These rings represented gaming rings, which are not only used by the Navajo, but are thought highly of by the genii of the rocks. (See Fig. 117.) Another man gathered willows with which to make the emblem of the concentration of the four winds. The square was made by dressed willows crossed and left projecting at the corners each one inch beyond the next. The corners were tied together with white cotton cord, and each corner was ornamented with the under tail feather of the eagle. These articles were laid in a niche behind the theurgist, whose permanent seat was on the west side of the lodge facing east. The night ceremony commenced shortly after dark. All those who were to participate were immediate friends and relatives of the invalid excepting the theurgist or song-priest, he being the only one who received direct compensation for his professional services. The cost of such a ceremony is no inconsiderable item. Not only the exorbitant fee of the theurgist must be paid, but the entire assemblage must be fed during the nine days’ ceremonial at the expense of the invalid, assisted by his near relatives.                        [Illustration: Figure 117]                          FIG. 117. Gaming ring.   A bright fire burned in the lodge, and shortly after dark the invalid appeared and sat upon a blanket, which was placed in front of the song-priest. Previously, however, three men had prepared themselves to personate the gods—Hasjelti, Hostjoghon, and Hostjobokon—and one to personate the goddess, Hostjoboard. They left the lodge, carrying their masks in their hands, went a short distance away and put on their masks. Then Hasjelti and Hostjoghon returned to the lodge, and Hasjelti, amid hoots, \"hu-hoo-hu-huh!\" placed the square which he carried over the invalid’s head, and Hostjoghon shook two eagle wands, one in each hand, on each side of the invalid’s head and body, then over his head, meanwhile hooting in his peculiar way, \"hu-u-u-u-uh!\" He then followed Hasjelti out of the lodge.
