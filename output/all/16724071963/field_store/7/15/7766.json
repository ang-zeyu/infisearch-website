I will continue to pray for you, for your son-in-law and for your dear and promising son for whose future work in the Cause I cherish the brightest hopes. I will also remember in my prayers the friends in far-away Australia and New Zealand and will supplicate for them all the Master’s richest blessings and unfailing guidance._  _Shoghi_     (23) April 29th, 1933   Dear Bahá’í Sister:  Shoghi Effendi wishes me to thank you[+E8] for your kind letter of March 16th 1933, as well as the enclosed article which has been translated by Mr. Paul into the Maori language.  The Guardian has already written Mr. Paul and expressed to him his deep appreciation for the service he has rendered to the Faith, but especially to his own people who through the means of such literature will be acquainted with the teachings and will receive the light of guidance brought to the world by Bahá’u’lláh.  I believe the Guardian has already intimated his approval of this pamphlet and the desire that the friends in Australia publish and circulate it among the Maoris.  As regards the passages in the sacred writings indicating the wrath of God; Shoghi Effendi says that the Divinity has many attributes: He is loving and merciful but also just. Just as reward and punishment, according to Bahá’u’lláh, are the pillars upon which society rests, so mercy and justice may be considered as their counterpart in the world to come. Should we disobey God and work against His commands He will view our acts in the light of justice and punish us for it. That punishment may not be in the form of fire, as some believe, but in the form of spiritual deprivation and degradation. This is why we read so often in the prayers statements such as “God do not deal with us with justice, but rather through thy infinite mercy.” The wrath of God is in the administration of His justice, both in this world and in the world to come. A God that is only loving or only just is not a perfect God. The divinity has to possess both of these aspects as every father ought to express both in his attitude towards his children. If we ponder a while, we will see that our welfare can be insured only when both of these divine attributes are equally emphasised and practiced.  In closing may I express the Guardian’s loving greetings and best wishes for the progress of your work in serving the Cause.  Yours ever sincerely, Ruhi Afnan  [From the Guardian:]  _May the Almighty bless your efforts, deepen your understanding of the essentials and distinguishing features of His Faith, guide your steps, and aid and assist you to extend the range of your activities and services._  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (24) September 1st, 1933   Dear Bahá’í Friend,  Shoghi Effendi has directed me to address you these few lines, acknowledging the receipt of your welcome letter of July 20th, 33, which he has read with deepest interest. He was gratified to learn that you have newly embraced the Cause and that you are earnestly endeavouring to spread it through every possible means. It is on young and active Bahá’ís, like you, that the Guardian centers all his hopes for the future progress and expansion of the Cause and it is on their shoulders that he lays all the responsibility for the upkeep of the spirit of selfless service among their fellow-believers. Without that spirit, no work can be successfully achieved. With it triumph, though hardly-won, is but inevitable. You should, therefore, try all your best to carry aflame within you the torch of faith, for through it you will surely find guidance, strength and eventual success.  The Guardian is fully conscious of the difficulties that impede the progress of the Faith in your community. Chief among these, you mention the lack of courage and of initiative on the part of the believers, and a feeling of inferiority complex which prevents them from addressing the public. It is precisely these weaknesses that he wishes the friends to overcome, for these do not only paralyze their efforts but actually serve to quench the flame of faith in their hearts. Not until all the friends come to realize that every one of them is able, in his own measure, to deliver the Message, can they ever hope to reach the goal that has been set before them by a loving and wise Master. It is no use waiting for some able and eloquent teacher to take all the responsibility for the spread of the Cause. For such a thing is not only contrary to the spirit of the Teachings but to the explicit text of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, both of whom place the obligation of teaching not on any particular class, as in former ecclesiastical organizations, but on every faithful and loyal follower of the Cause. The teaching of the Word is thus made universal and compulsory. How long then shall we wait to carry out this command, the full wisdom of which only future generations will be able to appreciate? We have no special teachers in the Cause. Everyone is a potential teacher. He has only to use what God has given him and thus prove that he is faithful to his trust.  Visiting teachers, who are, at least in a general way, supposed to be more competent and able than the rest, are undoubtedly of a great help. But these can never replace the mass of individual believers and fulfil what must be inevitably accomplished through the collective effort and wisdom of the community at large. What visiting teachers are supposed to do is to give the final touch to the work that has been done, to consolidate rather than supplement individual efforts and thereby direct them in a constructive and suitable channel. Their task is to encourage and inspire individual believers, and to broaden and deepen their vision of the task that is to be done. And this, not by virtue of any inherent spiritual right, but in the spirit of simple and whole-hearted cooperation.  It is in this light that Shoghi Effendi views the whole problem of teaching not only in New Zealand but in all the Bahá’í world. He would, therefore, encourage you to take a leading part in the carrying out of his wishes on this point, to take yourself an active interest in teaching, not only private but also public, and in this way stimulate the friends to follow your example. It is then, and only then, that there can be a need for a qualified and competent visiting teacher in order to bring to full fruition individual teaching efforts.  Assuring you of our Guardian’s fervent prayers on your behalf, so that you may be increasingly blessed in your efforts for the spread of the Message.  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _May the Beloved guide your steps, cheer your heart, deepen your understanding of the distinguishing features of His Faith and enable you to render the sacred Threshold unique and inestimable services,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_      PART III LETTERS TO INDIVIDUALS, MAY 1934–1957.   The first National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of New Zealand was formed in 1957.     (25) June 13th, 1934   Dear Bahá’í Brother,  The Guardian has duly received and deeply enjoyed reading your letters dated November 30th, December 27th, 1933 and February 4th, 1934. He is sorry that unforeseen circumstances have caused such a long delay in acknowledging their receipt. He hopes, however, that the matters you have submitted for his consideration have not suffered as a result.  Since your last letter to him, he has heard of the gratifying news of the formation of your N.S.A.(3) This historic step in the development of the Administration in Australia and New Zealand is, he feels, bound to react favourably on the further expansion and consolidation of the Faith in these far-off lands. He is fervently supplicating Bahá’u’lláh that the newly-elected members of the N.S.A.,(4) upon whom has been placed such a tremendous responsibility, be assisted in the discharge of their sacred obligations and duties to the Faith.  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Dear and valued co-worker:_  _The splendid reports you have sent me have been incorporated in the manuscript and sent to the Bahá’í World Committee in America. The formation of the national assembly of Australia and New Zealand will no doubt furnish you with new and refreshing material for your next report in 1936. I will pray for your success and deeply value the manifold and constant services you are rendering the Cause of God._  _Your true and grateful brother, Shoghi_     (26) December 22nd, 1934   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  The Guardian was profoundly grieved to learn of the passing away of your dear mother, and has directed me to convey to you and to the bereaved members of your family, his heartfelt condolences and sympathy for this severe loss which you have sustained.  Mrs Blundell’s departure is, indeed, a loss not only to her family, but also to the community of her fellow-believers in New Zealand. For in her they have come to lose one of their oldest and most distinguished co-workers.  The Guardian well remembers her pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and has always cherished the hope that she would once more be enabled to visit the shrines. But alas, her departed soul has taken its flight from this world, leaving her friends and relatives in a state of profoundest grief. Their only consolation now is the realization that through her painstaking and sustained labours for the Cause in Auckland Mrs Blundell has left an abiding monument to her memory, and one which will continue for many years to come to inspire and strengthen them all in their collective endeavours for the establishment of the Faith in New Zealand.  Shoghi Effendi is fervently praying for the soul of our departed sister, and is entreating Bahá’u’lláh to give her her full share of divine blessings in the other world.  May I also assure you of his ardent supplications for you, and for all the friends in Auckland.  Yours in His Service, H."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],["title","Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#6)"],["body","(27) January 21st, 1935   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  Shoghi Effendi has just been in receipt of your kind letter of the fourteenth of December last, and has read its contents with deep interest and gratification. It made him so happy, indeed, to learn that you are pursuing your activities for the Faith with such steadfastness and self-sacrifice, and also that through your beautiful and loving spirit those members of your family who have not yet embraced the Faith are being gradually attracted to it. He is ardently entreating Bahá’u’lláh that through your inspiration and guidance their interest in the Teachings may wax stronger and lead them to eventually espouse His Cause.  With reference to the suggestion made by Mr Alexander(5) for taking a record of the Guardian’s voice, he wishes me to inform you that although he fully appreciates the spirit in which this and similar suggestions are made to him he is, nevertheless, extremely reluctant that the believers should give any prominence to his writings, specially in the meetings which, he is firmly convinced, should be chiefly devoted to the reading and study of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh and the Master.  In closing will you kindly convey his greetings and appreciation to all the friends in Auckland, and particularly to the members of your family who, he hopes, will be assisted and sustained in their labours for the spread of the Message.  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Dear and valued co-worker:_  _I am deeply grateful for the services you are so devotedly rendering and the efforts you are so diligently exerting for the promotion of our beloved Faith. I will continue to pray for you and your dear co-workers from the depths of my heart._  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (28) February 5th, 1935   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  The Guardian has just received your kind message of the second of January last, and wishes me to thank you for it.  It comforted him greatly to learn that, despite the severe loss which you have sustained through the passing away of your mother, you are still engaged as actively as before in the work which you have set your heart to accomplish for the Cause in Auckland. The agonies of her earthly separation from you, difficult though they may be to bear, will assuredly be transmuted through the blessings of Bahá’u’lláh into a peaceful and abiding joy. In serving a Cause for which your mother sacrificed so much you will no doubt come to find the very purpose of your life, and the true secret of happiness in this, as well as in the next world.  The Guardian is fervently praying for you and for your brother, that you both may be strengthened and guided in your services to the Cause, and in this way continue and enrich still further the noble heritage which your mother has left for the Faith in New-Zealand.  With loving Bahá’í greetings to you and to all the friends in Auckland.  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Dear co-worker:_  _I wish to assure you in person of my heartfelt sympathy in the loss you have sustained, and of my loving and ardent prayers for the departed soul. The work with which her name will for ever be associated will confer upon her imperishable glory, and her example will serve to stimulate the rising generation to follow in her footsteps, and carry on the work she has so nobly initiated._  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (29) May 20th, 1936   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  Many thanks indeed from the Guardian for your welcome message of April 17th just received. He would certainly be delighted to meet you in Haifa next year, and hopes that your visit to the Holy Shrines will give you a fresh vigour and a renewed determination to carry on your work for the Cause. He specially cherishes the hope that your trip to England will be of great benefit to you, and also to our English believers. They will be only too happy to welcome you in their midst, and will thoroughly appreciate any assistance which you may give them during your sojourn in England.  The Guardian has learned with deep gratification of the news of the teaching work carried on by the Auckland believers. He wishes you to kindly assure them all of his best wishes and fervent prayers for the success of their labours. May Bahá’u’lláh bless, guide and strengthen them in every step they are taking for the spread of His Faith and the consolidation of its institutions in this far-off land.  Assuring you too of his special prayers on your behalf at the Holy Shrines, and with warmest greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Assuring you of a most hearty welcome, and wishing you good-health, happiness and success,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (30) September 30th, 1936   Beloved Bahá’í Sister,  Your welcome letter dated August 17th has been received and read with deepest appreciation by the Guardian.  May I again express his sincere hope that your long-cherished desire to visit the Holy Shrines may be fulfilled very soon, and that through this pilgrimage you may attain a renewed zeal and vigour, as well as a new vision of the task you are called upon to accomplish for the Faith in New-Zealand.  In closing let me assure you and your fellow-workers in Auckland of his profound appreciation of your determination to press forward the work in the teaching field. He is ardently praying for the guidance and success of your labours.  With warmest greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _May the Beloved fulfil your heart’s desire, and enable you to promote effectively the sacred and manifold interests of our beloved and glorious Faith,_  _Your true and grateful brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (31) December 7th, 1936   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of the fifth November, and exceedingly regrets that, owing to certain family difficulties, you have found it necessary to cancel your trip to the Holy Land. He is specially grieved to learn of the many cares and sorrows with which your daughter has been so sadly afflicted of late, and wishes me to hasten to convey to you his most loving sympathy, as well as the assurance of his prayers for the removal of the family troubles with which you are beset. He fervently hopes that these afflictive trials confronting you and your beloved daughter will all serve to quicken your spiritual energies, and that the outcome of it all will be to open before you new horizons of service, and fresh fields for teaching the Message. May Bahá’u’lláh give you patience to courageously withstand these tests, and full guidance to use them as a means to more active, concentrated and selfless service to His Cause. Do assure, therefore, your daughter not to feel disheartened, but to confidently endeavour to overcome her domestic sorrows and cares.  In closing may I express the Guardian’s hope that, as soon as your family problems are solved, you may be able to undertake your long-cherished pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines. He is ardently praying for the materialization of your hopes and plans in this connection.  It is a pleasure to learn of the successful visit of Mr Schopflocher(6) to Auckland, and of the warm welcome he has been accorded by you and the friends. This is a true evidence of the strong ties of fellowship so closely uniting the friends throughout the world, and of the deep affection which the believers in New-Zealand cherish for their fellow-believers in every region and clime.  With renewed and warmest greetings to you and to the friends in Auckland,  Yours in the Guardian’s Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Assuring you of my loving and ardent prayers for the removal of every obstacle from your path, and for the speedy realization of your dearest hopes,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (32) November 8th, 1937   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  Many thanks for your letter of September 16th addressed to our beloved Guardian. He is most pleased indeed to hear of Miss Holloway’s interest in the Cause and appreciates keenly your efforts for bringing about her full confirmation in the Faith. He is, at your suggestion, writing her directly and giving her the addresses of some individuals and centers in South Africa. He hopes that through contact with the friends her interest in the Teachings will be considerably increased and she will be stimulated to help in spreading their knowledge throughout South Africa.  The Guardian wishes you to keep in closest touch with her through correspondence, and to send her suitable literature on the Cause, and to endeavour to make her join actively the Faith.  Again with many thanks for introducing this lady who indeed seems to be a most promising worker, and with loving greetings to all the friends in Auckland.  Yours ever in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _May the Beloved bless you and aid you to surmount all obstacles that may stand in your path, and aid you to lend a fresh impetus to the work that has been so splendidly initiated._  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (33) May 17th, 1938   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  The Guardian is in receipt of your letter of the 19th ins., and is indeed pleased to know that your visit to Cairo has been so happy and successful, and that the friends have extended to you such a warm hospitality all through your stay.[+E9]  He hopes this letter will find you well, and enjoying your visit to your relatives and fellow-believers in England.  With loving remembrances, and renewed thanks for your message,  Yours in His Service, H.
