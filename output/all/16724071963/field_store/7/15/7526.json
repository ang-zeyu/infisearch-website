DATES OF THE PUBLICATION Of CHARLES DARWIN'S BOOKS AND OF THE PRINCIPAL EVENTS IN HIS LIFE  1809:  Charles Darwin born at Shrewsbury, February 12.  1817:  \"At 8 1/2 years old I went to Mr Case's school.\" (A day-school at Shrewsbury kept by the Rev G. Case, Minister of the Unitarian Chapel.)  1818:  \"I was at school at Shrewsbury under a great scholar, Dr Butler; I learnt absolutely nothing, except by amusing myself by reading and experimenting in Chemistry.\"  1825:  \"As I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a rather earlier age than usual, and sent me (Oct. 1825) to Edinburgh University with my brother, where I stayed for two years.\"  1828:  Began residence at Christ's College, Cambridge.  \"I went to Cambridge early in the year 1828, and soon became acquainted with Professor Henslow...Nothing could be more simple, cordial and unpretending than the encouragement which he afforded to all young naturalists.\"  \"During the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted, as far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at Edinburgh and at school.\"  \"In order to pass the B.A. Examination, it was...necessary to get up Paley's 'Evidences of Christianity,' and his 'Moral Philosophy'... The careful study of these works, without attempting to learn any part by rote, was the only part of the academical course which...was of the least use to me in the education of my mind.\"  1831:  Passed the examination for the B.A. degree in January and kept the following terms.  \"I gained a good place among the oi polloi or crowd of men who do not go in for honours.\"  \"I am very busy,...and see a great deal of Henslow, whom I do not know whether I love or respect most.\"  Dec. 27. \"Sailed from England on our circumnavigation,\" in H.M.S. \"Beagle\", a barque of 235 tons carrying 6 guns, under Capt. FitzRoy.  \"There is indeed a tide in the affairs of men.\"  1836:  Oct. 4. \"Reached Shrewsbury after absence of 5 years and 2 days.\"  \"You cannot imagine how gloriously delightful my first visit was at home; it was worth the banishment.\"  Dec. 13. Went to live at Cambridge (Fitzwilliam Street).  \"The only evil I found in Cambridge was its being too pleasant.\"  1837:  \"On my return home (in the 'Beagle') in the autumn of 1836 I immediately began to prepare my journal for publication, and then saw how many facts indicated the common descent of species... In July (1837) I opened my first note-book for facts in relation to the Origin of Species, about which I had long reflected, and never ceased working for the next twenty years... Had been greatly struck from about the month of previous March on character of South American fossils, and species on Galapagos Archipelago. These facts (especially latter), origin of all my views.\"  \"On March 7, 1837 I took lodgings in (36) Great Marlborough Street in London, and remained there for nearly two years, until I was married.\"  1838:  \"In October, that is fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,' and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work; but I was so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not for some time to write even the briefest sketch of it.\"  1839:  Married at Maer (Staffordshire) to his first cousin Emma Wedgwood, daughter of Josiah Wedgwood.  \"I marvel at my good fortune that she, so infinitely my superior in every single moral quality, consented to be my wife. She has been my wise adviser and cheerful comforter throughout life, which without her would have been during a very long period a miserable one from ill-health. She has earned the love of every soul near her\" (Autobiography).  Dec. 31. \"Entered 12 Upper Gower street\" (now 110 Gower street, London). \"There never was so good a house for me, and I devoutly trust you (his future wife) will approve of it equally. The little garden is worth its weight in gold.\"  Published \"Journal and Researches\", being Vol. III. of the \"Narrative of the Surveying Voyage of H.M.S. 'Adventure' and 'Beagle'\"...

Waterhouse, with a \"Notice of their habits and ranges\", by Charles Darwin.  1840:  Contributed Geological Introduction to Part I. (\"Fossil Mammalia\") of the \"Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. 'Beagle'\" by Richard Owen.  1842:  \"In June 1842 I first allowed myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my (species) theory in pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of 1844 into one of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and still (1876) possess.\" (The first draft of \"The Origin of Species\", edited by Mr Francis Darwin, will be published this year (1909) by the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press.)

'Beagle'\"; being Part II. of the \"Geology of the Voyage of the 'Beagle'\".  \"I think much more highly of my book on Volcanic Islands since Mr Judd, by far the best judge on the subject in England, has, as I hear, learnt much from it.\" (Autobiography, 1876.)  1845:  Publication of the \"Journal of Researches\" as a separate book.  1846:  Publication of \"Geological Observations on South America\"; being Part III. of the \"Geology of the Voyage of the 'Beagle'\".  1851:  Publication of a \"Monograph of the Fossil Lepadidae\" and of a \"Monograph of the sub-class Cirripedia\".  \"I fear the study of the Cirripedia will ever remain 'wholly unapplied,' and yet I feel that such study is better than castle-building.\"  1854:  Publication of Monographs of the Balanidae and Verrucidae.  \"I worked steadily on this subject for...eight years, and ultimately published two thick volumes, describing all the known living species, and two thin quartos on the extinct species... My work was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the \"Origin of Species\" the principles of a natural classification. Nevertheless, I doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so much time.\"  \"From September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile of notes, to observing, and to experimenting in relation to the transmutation of species.\"  1856:  \"Early in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and I began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as that which was afterwards followed in my 'Origin of Species'.\"  1858:  Joint paper by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace \"On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection,\" communicated to the Linnean Society by Sir Charles Lyell and Sir Joseph Hooker.  \"I was at first very unwilling to consent (to the communication of his MS. to the Society) as I thought Mr Wallace might consider my doing so unjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his disposition.\"  \"July 20 to Aug. 12 at Sandown (Isle of Wight) began abstract of Species book.\"  1859:  Nov. 24.

Dear Professor Seward,  The publication of a Series of Essays in Commemoration of the century of the birth of Charles Darwin and of the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of \"The Origin of Species\" is assuredly welcome and is a subject of congratulation to all students of Science.  These Essays on the progress of Science and Philosophy as affected by Darwin's labours have been written by men known for their ability to discuss the problems which he so successfully worked to solve. They cannot but prove to be of enduring value, whether for the information of the general reader or as guides to investigators occupied with problems similar to those which engaged the attention of Darwin.  The essayists have been fortunate in having for reference the five published volumes of Charles Darwin's Life and Correspondence. For there is set forth in his own words the inception in his mind of the problems, geological, zoological and botanical, hypothetical and theoretical, which he set himself to solve and the steps by which he proceeded to investigate them with the view of correlating the phenomena of life with the evolution of living things. In his letters he expressed himself in language so lucid and so little burthened with technical terms that they may be regarded as models for those who were asked to address themselves primarily to the educated reader rather than to the expert.  I may add that by no one can the perusal of the Essays be more vividly appreciated than by the writer of these lines. It was my privilege for forty years to possess the intimate friendship of Charles Darwin and to be his companion during many of his working hours in Study, Laboratory, and Garden. I was the recipient of letters from him, relating mainly to the progress of his researches, the copies of which (the originals are now in the possession of his family) cover upwards of a thousand pages of foolscap, each page containing, on an average, three hundred words.  That the editorship of these Essays has been entrusted to a Cambridge Professor of Botany must be gratifying to all concerned in their production and in their perusal, recalling as it does the fact that Charles Darwin's instructor in scientific methods was his lifelong friend the late Rev. J.S. Henslow at that time Professor of Botany in the University. It was owing to his recommendation that his pupil was appointed Naturalist to H.M.S. \"Beagle\", a service which Darwin himself regarded as marking the dawn of his scientific career.  Very sincerely yours,  J.D. HOOKER.     II. DARWIN'S PREDECESSORS. By J. Arthur Thomson.  Professor of Natural History in the University of Aberdeen.   In seeking to discover Darwin's relation to his predecessors it is useful to distinguish the various services which he rendered to the theory of organic evolution.  (I) As everyone knows, the general idea of the Doctrine of Descent is that the plants and animals of the present-day are the lineal descendants of ancestors on the whole somewhat simpler, that these again are descended from yet simpler forms, and so on backwards towards the literal \"Protozoa\" and \"Protophyta\" about which we unfortunately know nothing. Now no one supposes that Darwin originated this idea, which in rudiment at least is as old as Aristotle. What Darwin did was to make it current intellectual coin. He gave it a form that commended itself to the scientific and public intelligence of the day, and he won wide-spread conviction by showing with consummate skill that it was an effective formula to work with, a key which no lock refused. In a scholarly, critical, and pre-eminently fair-minded way, admitting difficulties and removing them, foreseeing objections and forestalling them, he showed that the doctrine of descent supplied a modal interpretation of how our present-day fauna and flora have come to be.  (II) In the second place, Darwin applied the evolution-idea to particular problems, such as the descent of man, and showed what a powerful organon it is, introducing order into masses of uncorrelated facts, interpreting enigmas both of structure and function, both bodily and mental, and, best of all, stimulating and guiding further investigation. But here again it cannot be claimed that Darwin was original. The problem of the descent or ascent of man, and other particular cases of evolution, had attracted not a few naturalists before Darwin's day, though no one (except Herbert Spencer in the psychological domain (1855)) had come near him in precision and thoroughness of inquiry.  (III) In the third place, Darwin contributed largely to a knowledge of the factors in the evolution-process, especially by his analysis of what occurs in the case of domestic animals and cultivated plants, and by his elaboration of the theory of Natural Selection, which Alfred Russel Wallace independently stated at the same time, and of which there had been a few previous suggestions of a more or less vague description. It was here that Darwin's originality was greatest, for he revealed to naturalists the many different forms--often very subtle--which natural selection takes, and with the insight of a disciplined scientific imagination he realised what a mighty engine of progress it has been and is.  (IV) As an epoch-marking contribution, not only to Aetiology but to Natural History in the widest sense, we rank the picture which Darwin gave to the world of the web of life, that is to say, of the inter-relations and linkages in Nature. For the Biology of the individual--if that be not a contradiction in terms--no idea is more fundamental than that of the correlation of organs, but Darwin's most characteristic contribution was not less fundamental,--it was the idea of the correlation of"]]]
