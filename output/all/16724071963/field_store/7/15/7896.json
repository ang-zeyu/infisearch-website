(3) That in almost every case the effect of absolute cessation is softened by marking the rhythm of the cadence-measure; in no case is the rhythm permitted to pause (not even in Ex. 19, where the accompaniment, not shown, is carried along in unbroken 8th-notes).   In some part or other, by some means or other, the cadence-measure is kept alive; either by continuing the accompaniment, as in Exs. 18 and 20, or by quickly picking up a new rhythm, as in Exs. 27 and 28.  Conspicuous exceptions to this rule will be found, it is true, in hymn-tunes and the like; though occasionally even there, as the student may recall, the rhythm, in some cadence-measures, is carried along by one or more of the inner voices; for example, in the hymn-tune \"Lead, Kindly Light,\" of J. B. Dykes.  (See also Ex. 29.)   SPECIES OF CADENCE.--In text-books and musical dictionaries several varieties of the cadence are distinguished, but they are chiefly distinctions without any more than one essential point of difference, namely, difference in force or weight.  It is therefore feasible to reduce all these varieties to two,--the heavy cadence and the light cadence.  The former is represented by the so-called Perfect cadence, the latter by the many grades of Semicadence.   PERFECT CADENCE.--There is one method of checking the current of the melodic phrase with such emphasis and determination as to convey the impression of finality; either absolute finality, as we observe it at the very end of a composition, or such relative finality as is necessary for the completion of some independent section of the piece,--conclusive as far as that section is concerned, though not precluding the addition of other sections to this, after the desired degree of repose has been felt.  This is known as the perfect cadence, or full stop.  It is always made upon the _tonic harmony_ of some key as cadence-chord, with the _keynote itself in both outer parts_, and--when desired in its strongest form (without such disguising as we have seen)--upon an _accented_ beat, and of somewhat longer duration than its fellow tones.  For illustration:--  [Illustration: Example 29.  Fragment of Schubert.]  At the end of this four-measure phrase there is a perfect cadence, exhibited in its strongest, most conclusive form.  It is practically undisguised, though the cadence-chord is reduced to three beats (from the four to which it is entitled) to make room for the preliminary beat of the next phrase (calculated to correspond to the one at the beginning of this phrase).  The cadence-chord is the tonic harmony of C minor; upon the primary accent of the 4th measure; it is considerably longer than any other tone in the phrase; and the keynote _c_ is placed both at the top and at the bottom of the harmonic body.  See also Ex. 15; the cadence is perfect, because the cadence-chord, on the accent of the 4th measure, is the tonic harmony of G major, with the keynote as highest and as lowest tone.  It is abbreviated by rests, which very slightly diminish its weight.  Ex. 17, No. 2, closes with a perfect cadence; it is the tonic harmony of C major, on an accent, and with the keynote in the two extreme parts.  See also Ex. 20.  In the following:  [Illustration: Example 30.  Fragment of Schumann.]  the cadence-chord stands upon the secondary accent (3d beat) of the final measure.  This method of shifting the cadence forward is generally adopted in large species of measure (6-8, 9-8, and the like), and has been defined among the devices employed in disguising or _lightening_ the cadence.  In Ex. 22, No. 5, the cadence-chord is shifted to the last beat (unaccented) of the final measure; this lightens the cadence very materially, but it does not affect any of its essential properties as perfect cadence.  The following is similar:--  [Illustration: Example 31.  Fragment of Schumann.]   The cadence-chord occupies the unaccented (2d) beat, and is no longer than any other chord in the phrase.  Despite its striking brevity, it is nevertheless a perfect cadence, disguised; it is the tonic chord of C major, with the keynote at top and bottom.  See also Ex. 23, No. 1.  The following illustrations come under the head of the disguised cadences seen in Ex. 24:--  [Illustration: Example 32.  Fragments of Mendelssohn and Schubert.]  In No. 1 the cadence is perfect, for it is the tonic chord of G major, keynote _g_ at top and bottom, and on the primary accent of the fourth measure; but the uninterrupted continuation of the movement of 16ths, in the right hand, shortens the uppermost keynote to a single 16th-note, and would entirely conceal the cadence, were it not for the distinct evidence of repose in the lower part.  In No. 2 the movement in the upper part appears to shatter the cadence; the keynote does not appear on the accent, and its announcement at the end of the first triplet is very brief.  For all that, it is an unmistakable perfect cadence; the chord thus shattered (or \"broken,\" technically speaking) is the tonic harmony of the key, and the keynote _does_ appear as uppermost (and therefore most prominent) tone, in the same order of percussion as that given to each of the preceding melody tones.        *      *      *      *      *      *  At the end of an entire piece of music, or of some larger section of the piece, the cadence-chord, on the other hand, is often lengthened considerably, for the sake of the greater weight and decision of cadential interruption required at that place.  Thus:--  [Illustration: Example 33.  Fragment of Schubert.]   The last two measures are merely the prolongation of the final cadence-chord.  See also, Mendelssohn, Songs Without Words, No. 4, last five measures; No. 8, last eight measures; and others.  Another peculiarity of the final cadence is, that sometimes the _uppermost_ tone is the 3d or 5th of the tonic chord, instead of the keynote,--a significant device to counteract the dead weight of the cadence-chord, especially when prolonged as just seen.  See No. 10 of the Songs Without Words, last six measures; it is the tonic chord of B minor, but the tone _d_ (the 3d) is placed at the top, instead of _b_. Also No. 16, last chord; No. 38, last chord; No. 6, last three measures (the 5th of the tonic chord as uppermost tone).  At any other point in the piece this default of the keynote would, as we shall presently see, almost certainly reduce the weight of the cadence from \"perfect\" to \"semicadence\"; at the very end, however, it cannot mislead, because it does not affect the condition of actual finality.   SEMICADENCE.--Any deviation from the formula of the perfect cadence--either in the choice of some other than the tonic chord, or in the omission of the keynote in either (or both) of the outer parts--weakens the force of the interruption, and transforms the cadence into a lighter, more transient, point of repose, for which the term semicadence (or half-stop) is used.  The semicadence indicates plainly enough the end of its phrase, but does not completely sever it from that which follows.  It is these lighter, transient forms of cadence to which a number of different names are given; for the student of analysis (and the composer, also, for that matter) the one general term \"semicadence,\" or half-cadence, is sufficient, and we shall use no other.  If, then, a cadence is final in its effect, it is a perfect one; if not, it is a semicadence.  The harmony most commonly chosen as the resting-place of a semicadence is the chord of the _dominant_,--the fifth step of the momentary key,--that being the harmony next in importance to that of the tonic (the one invariably used for the perfect cadence).  The following example illustrates the dominant semicadence:--  [Illustration: Example 34.  Fragment of Brahms.]   The cadence-chord is the dominant harmony (root _e_) in the key of A minor; neither of the two upper tones on the first and second beats is the root of the chord; it is quite sufficient that the root appears as lowermost tone, and even this is not necessary.  The \"point of repose\" is shifted to the second beat, in the manner so amply illustrated in the examples of the disguised cadence; the methods we have seen may be applied to _any_ kind of cadence.  See also Ex. 18; the key, and therefore the chord, at the semicadence is the same as that of the above example (simply major instead of minor).  Also Ex. 23, No. 4; the semicadence chord is the dominant harmony of E-flat major; it is skillfully disguised.  Ex. 25, dominant harmony of A major.  Ex. 26, last four measures; the semicadence is made upon the dominant of C minor.  In the following:  [Illustration: Example 35.  Fragment of Schumann.]  the semicadence in the fourth measure is made with the dominant harmony of C major (the tones _g-b-d-f_); it is so disguised as to remove all signs of interruption; but the chord _prevails_ throughout the measure, and (as may be seen by reference to the original, op. 68, No. 3) the next measure--the fifth--exactly corresponds to the first; this indicates another \"beginning,\" and proves our \"ending.\"  But though the dominant is thus generally employed at the semicadence, it is by no means the only available chord.  It must be remembered that every cadence which does not fulfil the definite conditions of the perfect cadence, is a semicadence.  Examine each of the following, and determine why the point of repose is each time a semicadence:--Ex. 1; Ex. 9, No. 3; Ex. 14, No. 2, fourth measure; Ex. 14, No. 3, fourth measure; Ex. 19; Ex. 22, Nos. 3 and 4; Ex. 23, No. 2, fourth measure.  The distinction between the two species of cadence becomes most subtle when the _tonic harmony_ is chosen for the semicadence, _but with some other part of the chord than the keynote as uppermost (or lowermost) tone_.  This might appear to lighten the perfect cadence too immaterially to"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1936"],["title","Letters from England, 1846-1849 (#0)"],["body","from the 1904 Smith, Elder and Co. edition by Jane Duff and proofed by David Price, email ccx074@pglaf.org   [Picture: Elizabeth Davis Bancroft.

S. A.     PREFACE   ELIZABETH DAVIS BANCROFT, the writer of these letters, was the youngest child and only daughter of William and Rebecca Morton Davis, and was born at Plymouth, Mass., in October, 1803.  She often spoke in later times of what a good preparation for her life abroad were the years she spent at Miss Cushing’s school at Hingham, and of her visits to her uncles, Judge Davis and Mr. I. P. Davis of Boston.  In 1825 she married Alexander Bliss, a brilliant young lawyer and a junior partner of Daniel Webster. On his death a few years later, her father having died, her mother and brother formed a household with her and her two sons in Winthrop Place, Boston.  As a young girl in Plymouth she became a great friend of the future Mrs. Emerson and later of Mr. Emerson and of Mr. and Mrs. Ripley, and through them was much interested in Brook Farm.  In 1838 she married George Bancroft, the historian and statesman, who was then Collector of the Port of Boston and a widower with three children. They continued to live in Winthrop Place till 1845, when for one year Mr. Bancroft was Secretary of the Navy in Polk’s cabinet.  While he was in that position the Naval Academy at Annapolis was established; and he played an important part in the earlier stages of the Mexican War.  In the fall of 1846 he became Minister to England.  It was then that the letters were written from which these extracts have been taken.  A number of passages not of general interest have been omitted, without any indications of such omission in the text, but in no case has any change in a sentence been made.  Most of the letters are in the form of a diary and were addressed to immediate relatives, and none of them were written for publication; but owing to the standing of Mr. Bancroft as a man of letters, as well as his official station, the writer saw London life under an unusual variety of interesting aspects.  In 1849 Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft returned to this country, and Mr. Bancroft occupied himself with his history until 1868, when he was for seven years Minister to Prussia and the German Empire.  At the expiration of that time they took up their residence in Washington, where they lived during the remainder of their lives.

MY DEAR SONS: Thank God with me that we are once more on _terra firma_. We arrived yesterday morning at ten o’clock, after a very rough voyage and after riding all night in the Channel in a tremendous gale, so bad that no pilot could reach us to bring us in on Saturday evening.  A record of a sea voyage will be only interesting to you who love me, but I must give it to you that you may know what to expect if you ever undertake it; but first, I must sum it all up by saying that of all horrors, of all physical miseries, tortures, and distresses, a sea voyage is the greatest . . . The Liverpool paper this morning, after announcing our arrival says: “The _Great Western_, notwithstanding she encountered throughout a series of most severe gales, accomplished the passage in sixteen days and twelve hours.”  To begin at the moment I left New York: I was so absorbed by the pain of parting from you that I was in a state of complete apathy with regard to all about me.  I did not sentimentalize about “the receding shores of my country;” I hardly looked at them, indeed.  Friday I was awoke in the middle of the night by the roaring of the wind and sea and _such_ motion of the vessel.  The gale lasted all Saturday and Sunday, strong from the North, and as we were in the region where the waters of the Bay of Fundy run out and meet those of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, afterwards we had a strong cross sea. May you never experience a “cross sea.” . . . Oh how I wished it had pleased God to plant some little islands as resting-places in the great waste of waters, some resting station.  But no, we must keep on, on, with everything in motion that your eye could rest on.  Everything tumbling about . . . We lived through it, however, and the sun of Sunday morn rose clear and bright.  A pilot got on board about seven and at ten we were in Liverpool.  We are at the Adelphi.  Before I had taken off my bonnet Mr. Richard Rathbone, one of the wealthiest merchants here, called to invite us to dine the next day . . . Mrs. Richard Rathbone has written that beautiful “Diary of Lady Willoughby,” and, what is more, they say it is a perfect reflect of her own lovely life and character.  When she published the book no one knew of it but her husband, not even her brothers and sisters, and, of course, she constantly heard speculations as to the authenticity of the book, and was often appealed to for her opinion.  She is very unpretending and sweet in her manners; talks little, and seems not at all like a literary lady.  I like these people in Liverpool.  They seem to me to think less of fashion and more of substantial excellence than our wealthy people.  I am not sure but the existence of a higher class above them has a favorable effect, by limiting them in some ways.  There is much less show of furniture in the houses than with us, though their servants and equipages are in much better keeping.  I am not sorry to be detained here for a few days by my illness to become acquainted"]]]
