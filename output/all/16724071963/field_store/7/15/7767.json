As you must have surely read in the newspapers, however, the general situation in Palestine is at present so gravely disturbed as to make it quite impossible for you to undertake this trip in the next few months, and in view of this the Guardian would advise that you postpone your visit until the November of next year, by which time, it is hoped, the situation throughout the country will have sufficiently improved to permit you to undertake this long-cherished pilgrimage. The Guardian, needless to say, would be also most delighted to meet you, and to hear from you directly of the news of the Cause in New-Zealand, and to discuss certain matters which the N.S.A.(7) has asked you to present to him for his instructions.  Regarding your question whether there is any special ceremony which the believers should perform when they wish to “name” a baby; the Teachings do not provide for any ceremony whatever on such occasions. We have no “baptismal service” in the Cause, such as the Christians have. There would be no objection, however, for the friends to come together on such happy occasions, provided they do not hold an official public ceremony, and provided also they strictly avoid uniformity and rigidity in all such practices. No rule whatsoever that would tend to be rigid and uniform should be allowed in such secondary matters, particularly as there are no specific instructions in the Teachings regarding them.  With the warmest good wishes of the Guardian to you and to the friends, and assuring you again of his hearty welcome to visit the Holy Shrines during next autumn, and with greetings,  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Dear and valued co-worker:_  _I shall indeed grieve if the situation in Palestine should prevent our meeting and prevent your pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines. I pray that this may not be the case. I am so eager to meet you, and express in person my deep and abiding sense of appreciation of the splendid and historic services you have rendered. I will continue to pray for you from the depths of my heart._  _Your true and grateful brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (35) March 20th, 1939   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  I am directed by our beloved Guardian to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated February 25th, informing him of the date of your departure from England, and your inability to defer your visit to Haifa till next November. He regrets indeed that you should find it impossible to extend your stay in Europe and come to Palestine in autumn, as the situation here is now so tense and dangerous that there seems very little hope of any real amelioration in security conditions to take place by next May. General conditions throughout the country are, at present, even worse than a month ago, and the tension is daily increasing.  In case, however, security is reestablished by the time you reach Port-Said, you would be welcome to visit the Shrines, but the Guardian would be still away.  Wishing you again a successful and happy return home, and with the renewed assurance of the Guardian’s prayers for your welfare, protection and guidance,  Yours most sincerely, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Dear and valued co-worker:_  _I deeply regret that the situation in Palestine has not yet improved as I realize how eager you are to visit the Holy Shrines. If however when you reach Port-Said it will at all be possible for you to visit the Shrine, you will be most welcome, I assure you. May the Almighty fulfil the dearest hope of your heart,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (36) August 3rd, 1941   Dear Bahá’í Sister:  Shoghi Effendi has instructed me to answer your letter to him of May 10th, which just came.  He was, as already expressed in the cable he sent you, greatly impressed by the statement in the Quarterly on the true Bahá’í attitude at the present time. It displayed a correctness of viewpoint, a courage, and a loyalty to Bahá’u’lláh which has led him to disseminate it far and wide: in the American News Letter, in the two Haifa News Letters, English and Persian, etc. It was indeed a timely and most noble contribution to the Faith.  The friends in both Australia and New Zealand seem to have developed a most outstanding soundness in their relation to the teachings. This leads Shoghi Effendi to believe that they will make great contributions to the unfoldment of the world-wide aspects of the Faith.  His prayers are always with you, and he most deeply appreciates the splendid services you are rendering the Cause, and will pray that the way will open for you to do even greater work and in an ever widening field.  Please assure all the dear friends of Auckland of his loving remembrance and his prayers for their work.  With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Dear and valued co-worker:_  _I cannot refrain from adding a few words in person to assure you of my lively appreciation of your constancy and of the distinctive services you are so ably and devotedly rendering our beloved Faith. That you may be able to extend their range is my fervent and constant prayer. Persevere, and be confident and happy._  _Your true and grateful brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (37) December 19th, 1947   Dear Bahá’í Brother:  Your letter to our beloved Guardian, dated Dec. 12th has been received, and he has instructed me to answer it on his behalf. The previous letter you mention cannot have reached him, as he always replies to letters from the friends.  Your book[+E10] touches on a very important subject, and he regrets that he cannot read it himself. His work is so pressing and multiplying so fast that he invariably refuses to go over the manuscripts the friends send him as he simply cannot attend to such things as well as all his other work. You should send it to the Reviewing Com. in the U.S.A. and ask their advice. Perhaps an outside publisher would be interested in it? The Bahá’í funds have such heavy demands made on them at present that even essential literature must often wait to be published, unfortunately.  He fully appreciates the fact that the believers locally, in different parts of the world, often feel that their political party is in many ways striving to accomplish ideals akin to our Bahá’í aims--but the fact remains that the only way for the Bahá’ís to preserve their international character, their unity and integrity, is for them individually to sacrifice these desired political affiliations for the universal good and protection of the Faith. There is no political party in existence with whose platform we wholly agree, and we must abstain from membership in such parties. Likewise people who join the Faith must have the courage and conviction to leave their political affiliations behind.  There is no reason why this should cause enmity as they are not joining another party, but a universal Faith striving for the advancement of the entire human race. He thinks there is very little possibility of any politician joining the Faith. The sacrifice of such individuals’ personal ambitions is too great a one for them to make. The condition of the world today is such that it is obvious no political solution to its problems is going to be found. We Bahá’ís must therefore concentrate on Bahá’u’lláh’s World Order--the true solution.  He assures you he will pray your teaching labours may be very successful. He will also pray for your dear mother’s welfare.  With warmest greetings, R. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Assuring you of my loving prayers for your welfare and success in the service of our beloved Faith,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (38) November 23rd, 1949   Dear Bahá’í Sister:  Your letter of October 28 has been received, and our beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  First, let me say how very deeply he appreciates the services you have been rendering our glorious Faith in Australia, and particularly Perth, during the past two years. Your trip has been of real assistance to the teaching work, and it pleased him greatly.  Regarding Mr. ...: it was with the approval of the Guardian that his name was removed from the voting list. It is very bad for the Cause to have a member of the Community, actively, in the public eye, teaching the Faith, and at the same time showing dishonest characteristics. We cannot possibly say that because a person also has many virtues, faults as grave as lying and dishonourable conduct regarding money, can be overlooked! This means that we tolerate as representatives of our Faith people who flagrantly disobey its laws and fundamental teachings. This does not mean there is no hope for Mr. ...; let him change his conduct, if he really loves the Cause, and then a way will be opened for him to again be active. But the change must be real and obvious; mere protestations will serve no purpose.  He urges you to continue your services in the teaching field in New Zealand, and also to write to the friends in Australia who are disturbed about Mr. ..., and strengthen their faith and determination.  With warmest greetings, R. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _May the Almighty, Whose Cause you serve with such zeal and devotion, reward you for your labours, and graciously assist you to win great victories for His Faith and its institutions,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (39) December 18th, 1949   Dear Bahá’í Brother:  Your letter of November 1st was received, and, although our beloved Guardian is so busy at present on the Shrine work here that his mail is piling up alarmingly, he does want to send you a word of appreciation for your fine, constructive spirit and the services you are rendering the Faith.  Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity. But its root is lack of faith in the system of Bahá’u’lláh (i.e. the administrative order) and lack of obedience to Him--for He has forbidden it. If the Bahá’ís would follow the Bahá’í laws in voting, in electing, in serving,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19251"],["title","Arohanui: Letters from Shoghi Effendi to New Zealand (#8)"],["body"," and in abiding by assembly decisions, all this waste of strength thru criticizing others could be diverted into cooperation and achieving the Plan. Keep on trying to point this out to them!  With Bahá’í love, R. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Assuring you of my loving prayers for the success of every effort you exert for the promotion of our beloved Faith, and the realization of every desire you cherish for its progress,_  _Your true and grateful brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (40) June 11th, 1952   Dear Bahá’í Sister:  Your two letters of May 25th have been received, and the beloved Guardian thanks you for them, and for the loving sympathy which you express.  He hopes that you will make every effort to attend the New Delhi Conference, as it will be a very historic occasion, and the more Bahá’ís from Australia and New Zealand that are present, the better.  You should get in touch with the Indian National Spiritual Assembly as regards accommodation etc.  This has been a very tiring winter for the beloved Guardian. He has had so many pilgrims, and so many problems locally, and an ever-increasing amount of work, so I will make this letter brief.  He assures you your services are deeply appreciated, and that he will remember you in his prayers.  With warm Bahá’í greetings, R. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _May the Beloved bless, guide and sustain you, and enable you to promote the best interests of His Faith,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (41) January 6th, 1955   Dear Bahá’í Sister:  Your letter of December 21st with enclosure has been received by the beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his behalf.  He is happy to know that the New Zealand Hazíratu’l-Quds is being made attractive for the many activities that will take place in this Center, and he hopes it will become the means of the greatest unity and loving cooperation among the friends.  He assures all the friends in New Zealand of his deep appreciation of their devoted services.  With warm Bahá’í greetings, R. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _May the Beloved bless, guide and sustain you, and enable you to promote, at all times, the vital interests of His Faith,_  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_      PART IV LETTERS TO BAHÁ’Í INSTITUTIONS.   These letters are presented chronologically and show the development of the institutions--Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Auckland, the National Spiritual Assembly, the Regional Teaching Committee.     (42) March 31st, 1926   Dear Spiritual Sister:  Shoghi Effendi wishes me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated Feb. 18th 1926. He well appreciates the whole-hearted contributions the friends, the world over, have made to safeguard the neighbourhood of the shrines. We all hope that this spirit of quick response and action will permeate all the different activities of the Cause.  Shoghi Effendi as well as the other members of the family send you, and through you, the Australian and New Zealand friends their best love and greetings. They all await the good news of the progress of the Movement in Australasia.  With loving greetings I remain, Yours very sincerely, Ruhi Afnan  [From the Guardian:]  _My dear fellow-worker,_  _I fully appreciate the self-sacrificing efforts of the New-Zealand Bahá’ís and am glad to inform them that the surroundings of the Shrines on Mt Carmel are secure. May the Beloved reward them a hundredfold! Convey my love and gratitude to them all._  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (43) May 14th, 1926   My dear Bahá’í sister,  I thank you on behalf of Shoghi Effendi for your letter of Mar. 8th and for the second copy of the draft that you had sent enclosed.  He has already received and cashed the first draft and has sent you the receipt for it.  He appreciates very much indeed the help of the New Zealand friends and I am sure they would all be very glad to know that the surroundings of the holy Shrines on Mt Carmel have already been safeguarded. This is such a relief to Shoghi Effendi and all the friends who feared lest the approaches should fall into the hands of speculators and interested men.  With heartfelt greetings to the friends in New Zealand. I am  Yours ever in His Service, Soheil Afnan  [From the Guardian:]  _Dear fellow-worker:_  _I wish to reassure you in person of my continued prayers for you as well as for those friends who in the distant city of Auckland are labouring for the advancement of the Cause in New Zealand. Please convey to them my brotherly greetings and very best wishes. I can never forget them and they are ever near to me._  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (44) January 7th, 1935   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  The Guardian has duly received your beautiful message of 2nd of December, and he wishes me to thank you for it, as well as for the enclosed copy of the Auckland Assembly’s circular letter which he has delivered to the spiritual assembly of Haifa for their perusal.  He also wishes me to ask you to kindly inform Mrs Blundell of the receipt of the twenty five copies of the Maori pamphlet which she had lately mailed to him. These, together with those she had sent previously, have all been placed in his own library, and a few copies have also been placed in the Mansion of Bahá’u’lláh at Bahjí for the information of the general public.  In closing the Guardian wishes me to renew to you the expressions of his abiding and genuine appreciation of your labours for the Cause in Auckland, and particularly in connection with your duties as secretary of the local assembly. He is praying from the very depths of his heart for your progress and success in this important field of Bahá’í service.  With heartiest greetings to you and all the friends.  Yours in His Service, H. Rabbani  [From the Guardian:]  _Dearly beloved co-worker:_  _I wish to assure you of my deepest appreciation of your constant and manifold services to the Faith, and particularly of the share you have had in consolidating its administrative institutions in both Australia and New Zealand, whether local or national. My prayers will continue to be offered from the bottom of my heart for you and for your dear co-workers. Persevere and never feel disheartened._  _Your true brother, _ _ Shoghi_     (45) September 26th, 1935   Beloved Bahá’í co-worker,  ...In connection with the N.S.A.’s(8) decision regarding the appointment of Mrs. Axford and Mr. Inman to keep records of Australian and New-Zealand activities for the “Bahá’í World”; the Guardian wishes you to assure your fellow-members in the assembly that he fully endorses their choice. He also wishes you to impress the newly-appointed correspondents with the vital importance of their task, and to urge them to acquit themselves of it with thoroughness, efficiency and vigour....       (Extract from “Letters from the Guardian to Australia and New     Zealand 1923–1957”. p. 10. Published by The National Spiritual     Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Australia Incorporated, 1970.)     (46) April 26th, 1936   Beloved Bahá’í Sister,  I am directed by the Guardian to thank you for your letter of the 30th March informing him of the date of Miss Kitty Carpenter’s arrival in Port-Said. You can be sure that the friends will be most delighted to meet her, and to render her journey to Haifa as safe and comfortable as possible.  The Guardian himself is eagerly looking forward to the pleasure of meeting her, and cherishes the hope that through this pilgrimage she may receive a renewed stimulus to better work for the promotion of the Faith upon her return home....  (Extract, ibid., p. 13)     (47) June 10th, 1936   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  ...The Guardian would also advise that the local assemblies take a similar step, and obtain official recognition from the authorities. In case the Auckland assembly has been registered in the government, will you be so kind as to send him photostatic reproductions of any registration papers or documents that the Auckland friends may have obtained from the authorities, as he wishes to have them published in the next “Bahá’í World”....  (Extract, ibid., p. 14)     (48) November 17th, 1936   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  On behalf of the Guardian I acknowledge with deepest thanks the receipt of your letter of the 17th October, and wish also to thank your Assembly for forwarding to him the photostatic reproduction of the registration certificate of the Assembly of Auckland....  (Extract, ibid., p. 18)     (49) January 31st, 1938   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  The Guardian wishes me to express his loving thanks for your letter of the third instant, enclosing the half-yearly reports of the Perth and Auckland Spiritual Assemblies, all of which he has been delighted to read.  He wishes you to write the Auckland Assembly assuring them of his approval of the request they have made on behalf of Miss Kitty Carpenter for permission to visit Haifa. He has every hope that through this pilgrimage she will be greatly refreshed and strengthened spiritually, and will upon her return home impart to the friends in New-Zealand some measure of the inspiration she will gain through close contact with the Holy Shrines....  (Extract, ibid., p. 24)     (50) November 2nd, 1938   Dear Bahá’í Sister,  ...The Guardian wishes me to express his gratification at the news of the enrolment of three new members in the Sydney Bahá’í group, and of two others in the Auckland community. He will pray that these new believers may continue deepening in their faith, and in their understanding of the Teachings, and that each of them may arise and lend every assistance in his power to the further expansion and firmer consolidation of the Faith in that far-off continent....  (Extract, ibid., p. 28)     (51) March 22nd, 1939   Dear Bahá’í Brothers and Sisters,  The Guardian wishes me to gratefully acknowledge the receipt of your card conveying to him your Assembly’s greetings for Naw-Rúz, and to assure you how deeply he feels appreciative of the renewed expressions of love which you had felt"]]]
