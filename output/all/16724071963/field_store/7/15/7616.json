Another came running from the direction of the half-demolished Cathedral of Learning, a third from the baseball field that had served as Altamont's point of reference the afternoon before.  The fourth, Murray Hughes, was running in from the ruins of the old Carnegie Tech buildings, and Birdy Edwards sped up the main road from Schenley Park. Once, twice, as he ran, Murray Hughes paused, turned, and fired behind him.  Then his pursuers came into sight!  They ran erect, they wore a few rags of skin garments, and they carried spears and hatchets and clubs, so they were probably classifiable as men. But their hair was long and unkempt, and their bodies were almost black with dirt and from the sun. A few of them were yelling, but most of them ran silently. They ran more swiftly than the boy they were pursuing: the distance between them narrowed every moment. There were at least fifty of them.  Verner Hughes' rifle barked, one of them dropped. As cooly as though he were shooting squirrels instead of his son's pursuers, he dropped the butt of the rifle to the ground, poured a charge of powder, patched a ball and rammed it home, replaced the ramrod. Tenant Jones fired then, and Birdy Edwards joined them, beginning to shoot with the telescope-sighted rifle.  The young man who had been north of the Cathedral of Learning had one of the auto-carbines; luckily, Altamont had providently set the control for semi-auto before giving it to him. He dropped to one knee and began to empty the clip, shooting slowly and deliberately, picking off the runners who were in the lead.  The boy who had started to climb down off the Library halted, fired his flintlock, and began reloading it.  Altamont, sitting down and propping his elbows on his knees, took both hands to the automatic which was his only weapon, emptying the magazine and replacing it. The last three savages he shot in the back: they had had enough and were running for their lives.  So far, everybody was safe. The boy in the Library came down through a place where the wall had fallen. Murray Hughes stopped running and came slowly toward the bunker, putting a fresh clip into his rifle. The others came drifting in.         *       *       *       *       *  \"Altamont, calling Loudons,\" the scientist from Fort Ridgeway was saying into the radio. \"Monty to Jim: can you hear me?\"  Silence.  \"We'd better get ready for another attack,\" Birdy Edwards said. \"There's another gang coming from down that way. I never saw so many Scowrers!\"  \"Maybe there's a reason, Birdy,\" Tenant Jones said. \"The Enemy is after big game, this time.\"  \"Jim, where the devil are you?\" Altamont fairly yelled into the radio; and as he did, he knew the answer. Loudons was in the village, away from the helicopter, gathering tools and workers.  Nothing to do but keep on trying!  \"Here they come!\" Reader Rawson warned.  \"How far can these rifles be depended on?\" Birdy Edwards wanted to know.  Altamont straightened, saw the second band of savages approaching about four hundred yards away.  \"Start shooting now,\" he said. \"Aim for the upper part of their bodies.\"  The two auto-loading rifles began to crack. After the first few shots, the savages took cover. Evidently they understood the capabilities and limitations of the villagers' flintlocks, but this was a terrifying surprise to them.  \"Jim!\"--Altamont was almost praying into the radio--\"Come in, Jim!\"  \"What is it, Monty? I was outside.\"  Altamont told him.  \"Those fellows you had up with you yesterday, think they could be trusted to handle the guns? A couple of them are here with me,\" Loudons inquired.  \"Take a chance on it! It won't cost anything but my life, and that's not worth much at the present.\"  \"All right, hold on. We'll be there in a few minutes.\"  \"Loudons is bringing the helicopter,\" Altamont told the others. \"All we have to do is to hold on, here, until he comes.\"  A naked savage raised his head from behind what might, two hundred years ago, have been a cement park-bench and he was only a hundred yards away. Reader Rawson promptly killed him and began reloading.  \"I think you're right, Tenant,\" he said. \"The Scowrers have never attacked in bands like this before. They must have a powerful reason and I can think of only one.\"  \"That's what I'm beginning to think, too,\" Verner Hughes agreed. \"At least, we've eliminated the third of your possibilities, Tenant. And I think probably the second, as well.\"  Altamont wondered what they were double-talking about. There wasn't any particular mystery about the mass attack of the wild men to him.  Debased as they were, they still possessed speech and the ability to transmit experiences. No matter how beclouded in superstition, they still remembered that aircraft dropped bombs, and bombs killed people, and where people had been killed, they would find fresh meat. They had seen the helicopter circling about, and had heard the blasting: everyone in the area had been drawn to the scene as soon as Loudons had gone down the river.  But they seemed to have forgotten that aircraft carried guns, although they did spring to their feet and start to run at the return of the helicopter.  However, most of them did not run far.     IX   Altamont and Loudons shook hands many times in front of the Aitch-Cue House, and listened to many good wishes, and repeated their promise to return. Most of the microfilmed books were to be stored in the old church. They were taking with them only the catalogue and a few of the most important works. Finally, they entered the helicopter. The crowd shouted farewell as they rose.  Altamont, at the controls, waited until they had gained five thousand feet, then turned on a compass-course for Colony Three.  \"I can't wait until we're in radio range of the Fort, Jim. This is one report that I really want to make,\" he said.  \"Of all the wonderful luck!\" he went on. \"And I don't know which is the more important: finding those books, or finding those people. In a few years, when we can get them supplied with modern equipment and instructed in its use--  \"What's the matter, Jim? You should be even more excited than I am.\"  \"I'm not very happy about this, Monty,\" Loudons confessed. \"I keep thinking about what's going to happen to them.\"  \"Why, nothing's going to happen to them. They're going to be given the means of producing more food, keeping more of them alive, giving them more leisure to develop themselves in--\"  \"Monty, I saw the Sacred Books.\"  \"The deuce! What were they?\"  \"It. One volume. A collection of works. We have it at the Fort and I've read it. How I ever missed all those clues--\"  \"You see, Monty, what I'm worried about is what's going to happen to those people when they find out that we're not really Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson....\"         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19164"],["title","Lectures on Art, Delivered Before the University of Oxford in Hilary Term, 1870 (#0)"],["body","[Transcriber's note:  Transliteration of Greek words appears between + signs.]             Library Edition  THE COMPLETE WORKS OF JOHN RUSKIN          CROWN OF WILD OLIVE           TIME AND TIDE          QUEEN OF THE AIR    LECTURES ON ART AND LANDSCAPE           ARATRA PENTELICI        NATIONAL LIBRARY ASSOCIATION           NEW YORK CHICAGO                 ***            LECTURES ON ART.

The following lectures were the most important piece of my literary work done with unabated power, best motive, and happiest concurrence of circumstance. They were written and delivered while my mother yet lived, and had vividest sympathy in all I was attempting;--while also my friends put unbroken trust in me, and the course of study I had followed seemed to fit me for the acceptance of noble tasks and graver responsibilities than those only of a curious traveler, or casual teacher.  Men of the present world may smile at the sanguine utterances of the first four lectures: but it has not been wholly my own fault that they have remained unfulfilled; nor do I retract one word of hope for the success of other masters, nor a single promise made to the sincerity of the student's labor, on the lines here indicated. It would have been necessary to my success, that I should have accepted permanent residence in Oxford, and scattered none of my energy in other tasks. But I chose to spend half my time at Coniston Waterhead; and to use half my force in attempts to form a new social organization,--the St. George's Guild,--which made all my Oxford colleagues distrustful of me, and many of my Oxford hearers contemptuous. My mother's death in 1871, and that of a dear friend in 1875, took away the personal joy I had in anything I wrote or designed: and in 1876, feeling unable for Oxford duty, I obtained a year's leave of rest, and, by the kind and wise counsel of Prince Leopold, went to Venice, to reconsider the form into which I had cast her history in the abstract of it given in the \"Stones of Venice.\"  The more true and close view of that history, begun in \"St. Mark's Rest,\" and the fresh architectural drawings made under the stimulus of it, led me forward into new fields of thought, inconsistent with the daily attendance needed by my Oxford classes; and in my discontent with the state I saw them in, and my inability to return to their guidance without abandonment of all my designs of Venetian and Italian history, began the series of vexations which ended in the very nearly mortal illness of 1878.  Since, therefore, the period of my effective action in Oxford was only from 1870 to 1875, it can scarcely be matter of surprise or reproof that I could not in that time obtain general trust in a system of teaching which, though founded on that of Da Vinci and Reynolds, was at variance with the practice of all recent European academy schools; nor establish--on the unassisted resources of the Slade Professorship--the schools of Sculpture, Architecture, Metal-work, and manuscript Illumination, of which the design is confidently traced in the four inaugural lectures.  In revising the book, I have indicated as in the last edition of the \"Seven Lamps,\" passages which the student will find generally applicable, and in all their bearings useful, as distinguished from those regarding only their immediate subject. The relative importance of these broader statements, I again indicate by the use of capitals or italics; and if the reader will index the sentences he finds useful for his own work, in the blank pages left for that purpose at the close of the volume, he will certainly get more good of them than if they had been grouped for him according to the author's notion of their contents.  SANDGATE, _10th January, 1888_.     LECTURES ON ART     LECTURE I  INAUGURAL   1. The duty which is to-day laid on me, of introducing, among the elements of education appointed in this great University, one not only new, but such as to involve in its possible results some modification of the rest, is, as you well feel, so grave, that no man could undertake it without laying himself open to the imputation of a kind of insolence; and no man could undertake it rightly, without being in danger of having his hands shortened by dread of his task, and mistrust of himself.  And it has chanced to me, of late, to be so little acquainted either with pride or hope, that I can scarcely recover so much as I now need, of the one for strength, and of the other for foresight, except by remembering that noble persons, and friends of the high temper that judges most clearly where it loves best, have desired that this trust should be given me: and by resting also in the conviction that the goodly tree whose roots, by God's help, we set in earth to-day, will not fail of its height because the planting of it is under poor auspices, or the first shoots of it enfeebled by ill gardening.   2. The munificence of the English gentleman to whom we owe the founding of this Professorship at once in our three great Universities, has accomplished the first great group of a series of changes now taking gradual effect in our system of public education, which, as you well know, are the sign of a vital change in the national mind, respecting both the principles on which that education should be conducted, and the ranks of society to which it should extend. For, whereas it was formerly thought that the discipline necessary to form the character of youth was best given in the study of abstract branches of literature and philosophy, it is now thought that the same, or a better, discipline may be given by informing men in early years of the things it will be of chief practical advantage to them afterwards to know; and by permitting to them the choice of any field of study which they may feel to be best adapted to their personal dispositions. I have always used what poor influence I possessed in advancing this change; nor can any one rejoice more than I in its practical results. But the completion--I will not venture to say, correction--of a system established by the highest wisdom of noble ancestors, cannot be too reverently undertaken: and it is necessary for the English people, who are sometimes violent in change in proportion to the reluctance with which they admit its necessity, to be now, oftener than at other times, reminded that the object of instruction here is not primarily attainment, but discipline; and that a youth is sent to our Universities, not (hitherto at least) to be apprenticed to a trade, nor even always to be advanced in a profession; but, always, to be made a gentleman and a scholar.   3. To be made these,--if there is in him the making of either. The populaces of civilised countries have lately been under a feverish impression that it is possible for all men to be both; and that having once become, by passing through certain mechanical processes of instruction, gentle and learned, they are sure to attain in the sequel the consummate beatitude of being rich.  Rich, in the way and measure in which it is well for them to be so, they may, without doubt, _all_ become. There is indeed a land of Havilah open to them, of which the wonderful sentence is literally true--\"The gold of _that_ land is good.\" But they must first understand, that education, in its deepest sense, is not the equaliser, but the discerner, of men;[1] and that, so far from being instruments for the collection of riches, the first lesson of wisdom is to disdain them, and of gentleness, to diffuse.  [Footnote 1: The full meaning of this sentence, and of that which closes the paragraph, can only be understood by reference to my more developed statements on the subject of Education in \"Modern Painters\" and in \"Time and Tide.\" The following fourth paragraph is the most pregnant summary of my political and social principles I have ever been able to give.]  It is not therefore, as far as we can judge, yet possible for all men to be gentlemen and scholars. Even under the best training some will remain too selfish to refuse wealth, and some too dull to desire leisure. But many more might be so than are now; nay, perhaps all men in England might one day be so, if England truly desired her supremacy among the nations to be in kindness and in learning. To which good end, it will indeed contribute that we add some practice of the lower arts to our scheme of University education; but the thing which is vitally necessary is, that we should extend the spirit of University education to the practice of the lower arts.   4. And, above all, it is needful that we do this by redeeming them from their present pain of self-contempt, and by giving them _rest_. It has been too long boasted as the pride of England, that out of a vast multitude of men, confessed to be in evil case, it was possible for individuals, by strenuous effort, and rare good fortune, occasionally to emerge into the light, and look back with self-gratulatory scorn upon the occupations of their parents, and the circumstances of their infancy. Ought we not rather to aim at an ideal of national life, when, of the employments of Englishmen, though each shall be distinct, none shall be unhappy or ignoble; when mechanical operations, acknowledged to be debasing in their tendency,[2] shall be deputed to less fortunate and more covetous "]]]
