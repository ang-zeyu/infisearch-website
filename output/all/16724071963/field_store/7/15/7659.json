At last the voice of the Levite called upon all to be      silent.       “‘The Roshe-Bate-Aboth of the twelve tribes have uttered words of      wisdom. These words will be as pillars for the times to come, if      the son of him “who has not rest” will write these words upon his      memory and spread the seeds among the nation of Israel in order      that it may grow to be a mighty tree. They will be the sword with      which Israel will strike down his enemies. Our posterity must share      among themselves happiness, wealth and power as it shared      misfortune and dangers. They must help one another. Wherever one of      them places his foot, he must drag another—his brother—along with      him. If one of them is unfortunate, others must help him, if he but      lives according to the law of our nation.       “‘He who was in prison for ten years, may become a rich man to whom      princes will bow, if only our people will not forsake him. Where      everybody is against us, all will be for us. After forty years of      wandering in the desert, the hand of Jehovah brought us to power in      the land of Canaan; the same hand will lead us after forty-five      times forty years from our misfortune and miseries to rule over      lands which are forty-five times vaster than Canaan. If Israel      shall obey the decision here adopted by the Sanhedrin of the      Caballah, our grandchildren, coming a hundred years hence to the      grave of the founder of our union, will announce to him that they      have indeed become the princes of the world and that the promise      made to the nation of Israel has been fulfilled. Other nations will      become his slaves! Renew our oath, sons of the golden calf, and go      to all lands of the world.’       “The blue flame flared up brightly upon the grave of the Rabbi;      each of the thirteen threw upon the tomb a stone which each carried      under his cloak.       “It seemed to the doctor that on the top of the tombstone, in the      bluish flame, there appeared a monstrous golden figure of an      animal.       “Then he heard the same metallic sound that he had heard when the      light first appeared. Then impenetrable darkness covered the      cemetery.       “The white figures again slipped by among the tombstones. The gates      creaked softly.       “The clock in the tower struck two past midnight. The last of the      mysterious visitors knocked at the window and a hoarse voice said      (as though the speaker knew that the watchman was not asleep):       “‘Close the house of life, watchman of those who are awaiting the      resurrection, and may your lips be sealed with the seal of Solomon      for a hundred years.’       “The scholar still lay motionless; he was afraid to stir; all he      had heard had made upon him such a dreadful impression.       “A noise near him indicated that his companion was rising.       “‘To concentrate in their hands all the capital of the nations of      all lands; to secure possession of all the land, railroads, mines,      houses; to be at the head of all organizations, to occupy the      highest governmental posts, to paralyze commerce and industry      everywhere, to seize the press, to direct legislation, public      opinion and national movements—and all for the purpose of      subjugating all nations on earth to their power! No! I shall      struggle against the golden calf and shall smash it to pieces as      Moses smashed it in the desert.’       “‘What we heard is a threat against all society. Here is my hand, I      will be your comrade in this struggle against the power of gold.’       “The Italian shook his head, but accepted the extended hand. ‘No,’      he said, ‘I want to act alone. There is a force which, if properly      directed, is not weaker than gold. That force is poverty and her      companion, labor. I shall call them out and lead them into battle.      Proud Israel! Beware! I shall put against you the _Artel_ (union)      and Labor.’       “‘And I,’ said the scholar, with animation, ‘all that is lofty and      noble,—science, idealism, faith—I shall lead these against this      materialism.’       “His comrade laughed:       “‘Your ideals will crumble as clay striking against metal. Only the      forces of poverty and hunger can be the fighters that will defeat      the golden calf. Our ways part here; you will go one way, and I      another. My promise is fulfilled; but remember your vow—be silent      as to all that you have heard and seen here!’”  This is the weird, fantastic “thriller” from which sprang the Protocols. It is the first stage. According to this story not only were there present at a secret meeting in the Prague Cemetery, the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel, ten of which totally disappeared nearly twenty-five centuries ago, but also the son of “the accursed one,” the Devil, was there, making side-remarks from time to time. His assigned function was that of spreading the decisions of the Wise Men of Zion among the Jews in order that they conquer the world.  Dr. Herman L. Strack, professor of theology at the University of Berlin, one of the foremost Christian authorities on theological and religious literature, commenting on this Goedsche-Retcliffe concoction, says that this tale of the ghostly convocation in the Jewish cemetery at Prague, discloses no real knowledge of Judaism, that the reference to mixed marriages indicates gross ignorance of actual Jewish thought, and that the Hebrew words supposed to have been employed by the spokesmen for the various tribes appear to have been borrowed from a dictionary. He also points to Goedsche-Retcliffe’s story and the “Rabbi’s Speech” about to be mentioned as the sources of the Protocols.     CHAPTER THREE  FICTION FORGED INTO “FACT”  The Lie in its Second Stage—The Tale Becomes “Fact”—The “Rabbi’s” Speech—Its Authenticity Vouched for by “Retcliffe”—An Illuminating Footnote—A Dedication to the Russian “Black Hundreds”—The Imaginary “Speech” Bears Witness to Authenticity of “Protocols,” Themselves Based on “Speech”—Three Stages of the Lie.   A number of years after this Russian translation of the Goedsche-Retcliffe story appeared, Sir John Retcliffe, alias Goedsche, deeming it important for his purpose of adding fuel to the flame of anti-semitism that had been lighted in Germany, undertook to convert this work of fiction, this offspring of his imagination, into a statement of fact. This led him to adopt the simple device of consolidating into one continuous speech the dialogue contained in his shilling shocker, and putting the speech into the mouth of an imaginary Rabbi in such a way as to make it appear to be an address delivered by him to a secret convocation of Jews. And the very man who had invented the speeches set down in his work of fiction twenty years before, now vouched for the authenticity of the obviously fabricated speech which he attributed to a Rabbi who had his birth in the contorted mind of this notorious forger.  A translation from the Russian of the apocryphal “Rabbi’s Speech,” with the introductory note as published in Russia by G. Butmi, in 1907, in a book entitled “The Enemy of the Human Race,” dedicated by the author to the Black Hundreds, will now be laid before the reader. A comparison of it, with the scene in the cemetery, will at once demonstrate the identity of authorship.

(Toward the end of the last century there appeared a book in London by Retcliffe entitled “A Review of Political and Historical Events During the Past Ten Years.” This work was translated into French. The French periodical press, without waiting for the complete translation of the book, reproduced certain parts of it because they were of special interest. Thus the French newspapers and magazines published translations from the English of an intensely interesting speech, most edifying for Russia (from the Hebrew), delivered by one of the Rabbis, THE AUTHENTICITY OF WHICH SPEECH IS VOUCHED FOR BY THE ABOVE-MENTIONED AUTHOR. This inimitable gem must in the eyes of Russians assume all the more importance since it is brought out by that “highly civilized” humane and practical country, England, which has given protection to the Russian Jews against the unsuccessfully invented persecutions on the part of the Russian government and people. This monstrous document was sent at the time in printed form, in the French language, to the editorial office of the Odessa newspaper “Novorosisk Telegraph” for those who might want to examine the accuracy of the translation published in No. 4996 of that newspaper, dated January 15, 1891, and reprinted in No. 21 of the Petersburg newspaper “Znamya,” dated January 22, 1904.

Les Protocols des Sages de Zion,” by Jouin, Paris, 1920.]       “Our fathers ordained the chosen ones in Israel to gather, without      fail, once every century, at the grave of our great Master Caleb,      the sainted Rabbi Simeon Ben Judah, whose great knowledge is      imparted to the elect of each generation to gain the power over the      whole world and authority over all the descendants of Israel....            “It is already eighteen centuries that the war of Israel is           being waged with the power which had been promised to Abraham           but which had been snatched away from him by the _Cross_.           Trampled under foot, humiliated by his enemies, ceaselessly           under threats of death, of persecution, of rapine and violence           of every sort, Israel has not succumbed; and if he is           dispersed over the whole world it is because the whole world           should belong to him.       “It has been for a few [eighteen] centuries now that our learned      men have been fighting against the Cross with courage and      persistence which nothing can break. Our people is rising gradually      and, with each day, its forces are growing. _It is to us that this      God of the day belongs, which was erected by Aaron in the      wilderness, this golden calf, this universal deity of the epoch._       “When we become, at last, the sole possessors of all the gold to be      found on earth, the true power will practically be transferred to      our hands, and the promises made to Abraham will be fulfilled.      _Gold—is the greatest power on earth; it is might, reward, the      instrument of every authority, it is all man, both fears and      desires. This is the sole mystery, the most profound science of      that spirit with the aid of which the entire world is ruled._ This      is what the future holds in store. Eighteen centuries have belonged      to our enemies; this century and the following must belong to us,      the People of Israel, and will be ours, without fail. Here, for the      tenth time during a thousand years of cruel and incessant struggle      with our enemies, have assembled at this cemetery; at the grave of      the great Master, Caleb, the sainted Rabbi Simeon Ben Judah, the      elect of each of the tribes of the Israelite people, in order to      discuss and agree upon, the means of making use, in the interests      of our cause, of all the tremendous mistakes and errors, which our      enemies—the Christians—have not ceased to commit. Every time the      new Sanhedrin (assembly) proclaimed and preached merciless warfare      against our enemies, but not once during the past centuries did our      forefathers succeed in concentrating in our hands such an enormous      quantity of gold [_and consequently of power_] as the nineteenth      century has given us. We are therefore able, without any senseless      illusions, to flatter ourselves with the hope of attaining our goal      before long, and we can look forward with assurance into the very      eyes of the future.       “Persecutions and insults,—these sombre and tortuous times, which      the people of Israel bore with heroic patience,—have fortunately      come to an end, owing to the progress of civilization among the      Christians, and this progress is the best shield under which we can      hide and scheme, in order that we may cover quickly and decisively      the last leg of that distance which divides us from our supreme      aim. Let us cast a cursory glance at the economic situation of      Europe and analyze the resources which fell to the Israelites from      the beginning of the present century, owing to the concentration in      their hands of the tremendous capital which is in their possession      at the present time. It turns out that in Paris, London, Vienna,      Berlin, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Rome, Naples, etc. [_and in all      lands—the Rothschilds_], that everywhere, the Israelites are the      masters of the financial situation, being as they are possessors of      many billions, not to mention localities of the second and third      class where all the financial funds are in their hands and not      mentioning that, without their direct influence, no financial      operation, no work of any importance, could be carried out anywhere      at any time. At present, all the emperors, kings and ruling princes      are burdened with tremendous debts incurred in order to be able to      maintain numerous standing armies [_to sustain their tottering      thrones_]. The Bourse quotes and regulates these moneys, and we are      the full masters of the Bourse in all the centres of the globe. The      problem before us now is to facilitate even to a greater extent the      means of contracting these loans and thus to become the sole      managers of all valuables, after which the exploitation of all      their railroads, mines, forests, large factories and industrial      plants, as well as of all other (real property) including duties      and taxes, will fall into our hands, as a security for the capital      lent by us to the various States.       “Agriculture will forever remain the principal source of a      country’s wealth. The possession of large plots of land will pave      for us even a broader way to honors and will strengthen our      influence (over the highest officials of the country). From this      follows, that our efforts will be directed towards inducing our      brethren in Israel to make large agricultural purchases. We must,      therefore, do our utmost to break up large estates into small      parcels, in order to be able to purchase them in the easiest and      quickest way. Under the pretext of trying to help the working      classes, it is necessary to oppress the large landowners with      taxation in all its severity. When these possessions will thus      gradually be transferred into our hands, the whole labor of the      Christian proletariat will become for us a new source of tremendous      profits. _Since the Christian Church is one of our most dangerous      enemies, we must work tirelessly to weaken its influence, and in      order to accomplish this, it is necessary to use all our efforts to      implant in the Christian intellectual class ideas of atheism,      scepticism, dissension and to call forth religious disputes among      the newly-formed groups and sects of Christendom._            “Logically, we must begin by depreciating the ministers of           this religion. Let us declare open war on them, let us provoke           suspicions on their devotion, on their private conduct, and by           ridicule and persiflage we shall be right in the consideration           attached to the state and the costume of the priest.       “Every war, every revolution, every political and religious      upheaval brings nearer the moment when we shall attain the great      end for which we have been striving so long. Commerce and      speculation—these branches, most plentiful in their fruits,—must      never be suffered to slip out of the hands of the Israelites.            “... and once these branches have become identified with us,           we shall, through the flattery and perspicacity of our           executives, know how to penetrate to the prime source of true           influence and power. It is understood that we are concerned           only with those pursuits that entail honors, power or           privileges, for all those that require knowledge, labor or           disagreeable conditions, these can and should be left to the           Christians. The magistrature is an institution of prime           importance for us. The legal profession develops most the           faculty of civilization and initiates one furthest in the           affairs of our natural enemies, the Christians, and it is           through it that we can subject them to our mercy. Why should           not the Jews become Ministers of Instruction when they have so           often been Ministers of Finance? The Jews must also aspire to           the rank of legislators with the object of abrogating the laws           made by the Goim, faithless sinners, against the sons of           Israel, the true believers, in their invariable attachment to           the holy laws of Abraham.            “Moreover, on this point, our plan is nearing the most           complete realization, for progress has nearly everywhere           recognized and accorded to us the same civic rights as to           Christians, but that which it is of importance to obtain, that           which must be the object of our ceaseless efforts, is a law           less severe on bankruptcy. We shall make of it a gold mine           more rich than were ever the mines of California.            “With this object in view the people of Israel must direct its           ambition towards those high offices of authority which have           the power to distribute honors and esteem. The most assured           way of attaining such offices is to have weight and importance           in the various industrial enterprises, financial and           commercial operations, and to be on guard for all pitfalls and           temptations which may lead to the prosecution of the sons of           Israel in the country’s courts.            “Our people, in deciding upon one operation or another, must           be guided by wisdom and tact, which are the distinguishing           traits of its natural gifts. We must not remain passive to           anything that may aid us in gaining a place of honor in           society; philosophy, medicine, law, political economy—in other           words, all branches of science, art, literature—represent a           wide field where even our smallest successes, developing our     "]]]
