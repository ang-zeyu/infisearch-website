[Illustration: \"YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HER FOR CERTAIN.\"]  \"You did right to tell me this, my child,\" said she; \"but I wish you to say nothing about it to any one else: will you remember?\"  \"Yes'm,\" replied Dotty, trying to read her grandmother's face, and feeling a little alarmed by its solemnity. \"What you going to do, grandma? Not put Jennie in the lockup--are you? 'Cause if you do--O, don't you! She said 'twas her sharp eyes, and she didn't mean to steal, and 'twasn't your pockets, and she promised she'd give me half--yes, she truly did, grandma.\"  \"Go, dear, and bring me my bonnet from the band-box in my bed-room closet.\"  Then Mrs. Parlin folded the sheet she was making, put on her best shawl and bonnet, and kid gloves, and taking her sun umbrella, set out for a walk. There was a look in her face which made her little granddaughter think it would not be proper to ask any questions.  Mrs. Parlin met Jennie Vance coming in at the gate.  \"O, dear,\" thought Dotty, \"I don't want to see her. Grandma says I've done right, but Jennie'll call me a tell-tale. I'll go out in the barn and hide.\"  The guilty secret had lain heavy at Jennie's heart all day. As soon as her dress-maker could spare her, and a troublesome little cousin had left, she asked permission to go to Mrs. Parlin's.  \"Dotty thinks I meant to keep it,\" she thought. \"I never did see such a girl. You can't say the least little thing but she takes it sober earnest, and says she'll tell her grandmother.\"  Jennie stole round by the back door, and timidly asked for Miss Dimple.  \"I'm sure I don't know where she is,\" answered Ruthie, with a pleasant smile; \"nor Flyaway either. I have been living in peace for half an hour.\"  Ruthie made you think of lemon candy; she was sweet and tart too.  While Jennie, with the kind assistance of Prudy, was hunting for Dotty, Mrs. Parlin was in Judge Vance's parlor, talking with Jennie's step-mother. Mrs. Vance was shocked to hear of her daughter's conduct, for she loved her and wished her to do right.  \"My poor Jennie,\" said she; \"from her little babyhood until she was six years old, there was no one to take care of her but a hired nurse, who neglected her sadly.\"  \"I know just what sort of training Jennie has had from Serena Pond,\" said Mrs. Parlin; \"it was most unfortunate. But you are so faithful with her, my dear Mrs. Vance, that I do believe she will outgrow all those early influences.\"  \"I keep hoping so,\" said Mrs. Vance, repressing a sigh; \"I take it very kindly of you, Mrs. Parlin, that you should come to me with this affair. I shall not allow Jennie to go to your house very often. You do not like to wound my feelings, but I am sure you cannot wish to have your little granddaughter very intimate with a child who is sly and untruthful.\"  \"My dear lady,\" said grandma Parlin, taking Mrs. Vance's hand, and pressing it warmly; \"since we are talking so freely together, and I know you are too generous to be offended, I will confess to you that if Jennie persists in concealing this money, I would prefer not to have Dotty play with her very much; at least while her mother is not here to have the care of her.\" It was hard for Mrs. Parlin to say this, and she added presently,--  \"Please let Jennie spend the night at our house. She may wish to talk with me; we will give her the opportunity.\"  Mrs. Vance gladly consented. She had observed that Jennie seemed unhappy, and was very anxious to see Dotty again. She hoped she had gone to return the money of her own free will.  When Mrs. Parlin opened the nursery door at home, she found Jennie building block houses, to Flyaway's great delight, while at the other end of the room sat Dotty Dimple, resolutely sewing patchwork.  \"O, grandma,\" spoke up Flyaway, \"Jennie came to see me; she didn't come to see Dotty, 'cause Dotty don't want to talk. There, now, Jennie, make a rat to put in the cupboard. R goes first to rat.\"  Innocent little Flyaway! She had long ago forgotten her pique against Jennie for being \"so easy fretted,\" and jumping her down from the table.  Wretched little Jennie! The new blue and white frock, just finished by her dress-maker, covered a heart filled with mortification. Dotty Dimple would not talk to her. It seemed as if Dotty had climbed to the top of a high mountain, and was looking down, down upon her.  Dotty did feel very exalted to-day; but there was another reason why she would not talk with Jennie: she might have to confess that grandma knew about the money; and then what a scene there would be! So Dotty set her lips together, and sewed as if she was afraid somebody would freeze to death before she could finish her patchwork quilt.  Mrs. Clifford, who did not understand the cause of Dotty's lofty mood, took pity on Jennie, and tried to amuse her. After a while, Dotty came softly along, and sat down close to her aunt Maria, ready to listen to the story of the \"Pappoose,\" though she had heard it fifty times before.  She did not see Jennie alone for one moment. Grandma Parlin did. \"Jennie,\" said she, taking her into the parlor to show her a new shell, \"are you going with our little girls, to-morrow, to sell rags?\"  \"I don't know, ma'am, I'm sure,\" replied Jennie, looking hard at the sofa. She longed to make an open confession, and get rid of the troublesome money, but had not the courage to do it without some help from Dotty.  \"O, dear,\" thought she, \"I feel just as wicked with that money in my bosom! Seems as if she could hear it crumple. If Dotty would only let me talk to her first!\"  But Dotty continued as unapproachable as the Pope of Rome. Eight o'clock came, and the two unhappy little girls went slowly up stairs to bed. Dotty, in her lofty pride, tried to make her little friend feel herself a sinner; while Jennie, ready to hide herself in the potato-bin for shame, was, at the same time, very angry with the self-satisfied Miss Dimple. She was awed by her superior goodness, but did not love her any the better for it. Why should she? Dotty's goodness lacked       \"_Humility_, that low, sweet root,       From which all heavenly virtues shoot.\"  \"Here, Miss Parlin,\" said Jennie, angrily, as she took off her dress; \"here it is, right in my neck. I should have gone and given it to your grandmother, ever so long ago, if you hadn't acted so!\"  Dotty pulled off her stockings.  \"I 'spose you thought I was going to keep it. Here, take your old money!\"  \"You did mean to keep it, Jane Sidney Vance,\" retorted Dotty, as fierce as a thistle; and finished undressing at the top of her speed.  The money lay on the floor, and neither of the proud girls would pick it up. Jennie, who always prayed at her mother's knee, forgot her prayer to-night, and climbed into bed without it. But Dotty, feeling more than ever how much better she was than her little friend, knelt beside a chair, and prayed in a loud voice. First, she repeated the \"Lord's Prayer,\" then \"Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,\" and \"Now I lay me down to sleep.\" She was not talking to her heavenly Father, but to Jennie, and ended her petitions thus:--  \"O God, forgive me if I have done anything naughty to-day; and please forgive _Jennie Vance, the wickedest girl in this town_.\"  Then the little Pharisee got into bed.     CHAPTER VIII.  \"WHEELBARROWING.\"   \"The wickedest girl in this town!\" Jennie's eyes flashed in the dark like a couple of fireflies. At first she was too angry to speak; and when words did come, they were too weak. She wanted words that were so strong, and bitter, and fierce, that they would make Dotty quail. But all she could say was,--  \"O, dreadful good you are, Miss Parlin! Good's the minister! Ah! guess I'll get out and sleep on the floor!\"  Dotty made no reply, but rolled over to the front of the bed, and Jennie pushed herself to the back of it. There the little creatures lay in silence, each on an edge of the bedstead, and a whole mattress between. Sleep did not come at once.  \"She's left that money on the floor,\" thought Dotty; \"what if a mouse should creep down the chimney, and gnaw it all up? But she must take care of it herself. _I_ shan't!\"  And Jennie thought, wrathfully, \"Dotty says such long prayers she can't stop to pick up that scrip! If she expects me to get out of bed, she's made a mistake; I won't touch her old money.\"  About nine o'clock grandma Parlin came quietly into the room with a lamp. A smile crept round the corners of her mouth, as she saw the little girls sleeping so widely apart, their faces turned away from each other.  \"How is this?\" said she, as the two bills caught her eye. \"Of all the foolish children! Dropping money about the room like waste paper!\"  The light awoke Jennie, who had only just fallen asleep. \"Now is the time,\" said she to herself; and without waiting for a second thought, which would have been a worse one, she sprang out of bed, and caught Mrs. Parlin by the skirts.  \"That money is yours, Mrs. Parlin,\" said she, bravely. \"Yours; I found it in the rag-bag. Something naughty came into me this morning, and made me want to keep it; but I'm ever so sorry, and never'll do it again. Will you forgive me?\"  Then grandma Parlin seated herself in a rocking-chair, took Jennie right into her lap, and talked to her a long while in the sweetest way. Jennie curled her head into the good woman's neck, and sobbed out all her wretchedness.  \"She knew she was real bad, and people didn't like to have her play with their little girls, and Dotty Dimple thought she was awful; but _was_ she the wickedest girl in this town?\"  \"No; O, no!\"  \"Wasn't Dotty some bad, too?\"  \"Yes, Dotty often did wrong.\"  Then Jenny wept afresh.  \"She knew she _was_ worse than Dotty, though. She wished,--O, dear, as true as she lived,--she wished she was dead and buried, and drowned in the Red Sea, and the grass over her grave, and shut up in jail, and everything else.\"  Then Mrs. Parlin soothed her with kind words, but told the truth with every one.  \"No 'm,\" Jennie said; \"it"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19247"],["title","Dotty Dimple's Flyaway (#8)"],["body","'t right to take fruit-cake without leave, or tell wrong stories either; she wouldn't any more. Yes'm, she would try to be good--she never had tried much.--Yes 'm, she would ask God to help her. Should you suppose He would do it?  \"Yes 'm, she would ask Him not to let her have much temptation. She did believe she would rather be a good girl--a real good girl, like Prudy, _not like Dotty_!--than to have a velvet dress with spangles all over it.\"  All this while Dotty did not waken. In the morning she was surprised to see her little bedfellow looking so cheerful.  \"I've told your grandmother all about it,\" said Jennie with a smile. \"I knew I did wrong, but I don't believe I should have meant to if you hadn't acted so your _own_ self--now that's a fact.\"  \"You haven't seen my grandmother,\" returned Dotty, not noticing the last clause of her friend's remark. \"You dreamed it.\"  \"No, she came in here and forgave me. She's the best woman in this world. What do you think she said about you, Dotty Dimple? She said there were other little girls full as good as you are. There!\"  \"O!\"  \"Said you 'often did wrong,' that's _just_ what,\" added Jennie, correcting herself, and making sure of the \"white truth.\"  Step by step Dotty came down from the mountain-top, and, before breakfast was ready, had led her visitor through the morning dew to the playhouse under the trees, chatting all the way as if nothing had happened.  It proved that the money belonged to Abner. He had missed it several weeks before, and ever since that had been suspecting old Daniel McQuilken, a day laborer, of stealing it.  \"I'm ashamed of it now,\" said Abner to Ruth, \"though I didn't tell anybody but you. I wish you'd mix a pitcher of sweetened water, and let me take it out to the field to old Daniel. I feel as if I wanted to make it up to him some way.\"  Ruth laughed; and when Abner came into the house at ten o'clock, she had a pitcher of molasses and water ready for him, also a plate of cherry turnovers. Flyaway insisted upon toddling over the ground with one of the turnovers in her apron.  \"Man,\" said she, when they reached the field, and she saw the Irishman with his funny red and white hair, \"what's your name, man?\"  He wiped his face with his checked shirt-sleeve, and took a turnover from her hand, bowing very low as he did so.  \"Thank ee, my little lady; sense you're plazed to ask me,--my name's Dannul.\"  \"O, are you?\" said Flyaway, looking up in surprise at the large and oddly-dressed stranger. \"Are you Daniel? My mamma's just been reading about you. You was in the lions' den--_wasn't_ you, Daniel?\"  Mr. McQuilken smiled at bareheaded, flossy-haired little Katie, and replied, with a wink at Abner,--  \"Fath, little lady, and I suppose I'm that same Dannul; but 'twas so long ago I've clane forgot aboot it entirely.\"  \"O, did you? Well, you _was_ in the lions' den, Daniel, but they didn't bite you, you know, 'cause you prayed so long and so loud, with your winners up; and then God wouldn't let 'em bite.\"  Old Daniel laid both his huge hands on Katie's head.  \"Swate little chirrub,\" said he, \"don't she look saintish?\"  Katie moved away; she did not like to have her hair pulled, and Daniel was unconsciously drawing it through the big cracks in his fingers, as if he was waxing silk.  \"I guess I'll go home now,\" said she, with a timid glance at the man whom the lions did not bite; \"they'll be spectin' me.\"  Abner and Daniel both watched the tiny figure across the fields till Ruth came out to meet it, and it fluttered into the east door of the house.  \"There, she's safe,\" said Abner; \"she needs as much looking after as a young turkey.\"  \"She runs like a little sperrit, bliss her swate eyes,\" said Daniel. \"I had one as pooty as her, but she's at Mary's fate, Hivven rist her sowl!\"  The moment Flyaway reached the house, she rushed into the parlor to tell her mother the news.  \"The man you readed about in the book, mamma, he's out there! Daniel, that the lions didn't bite, mamma, 'cause he prayed so long and so loud with his winners up; he's out there--got a hat on.\"  \"O, no, my child; it is thousands of years since Daniel was in the lions' den; he died long and long ago.\"  \"But he said he did, mamma; he told me so. I _fought_ he was dead, mamma, but he said he wasn't.\"  Mrs. Clifford shook her head. \"I dare say his name is Daniel, but he was never in a lion's den.\"  Flyaway opened and closed her eyes in the slowest and most impressive manner. \"Mamma,\" said she, solemnly, \"does--folks--tell--lies?\"  It was an entirely now idea to the innocent child: it stamped itself upon her mind like a motto on warm sealing-wax, \"Folks--does--tell--lies.\"  Mrs. Clifford was sorry to see the look of distrust on the young face.  \"Listen to me, little Flyaway. I think the man was in sport; he was only playing with you, as Horace does sometimes, when he calls himself your horse.\"  Flyaway said no more, but she pressed her eyelids together again, and felt that she had been trifled with. Half an hour afterwards Prudy heard her repeating, slowly, to herself, \"Folks--does--tell--lies.\"  \"Why, here she is,\" called Dotty from the piazza; \"come, Fly; we're going wheel-barrowing.\"  \"Wait a minute, cousin Dotty,\" said Mrs. Clifford; \"Flyaway must put on a clean frock; she is not coming home with you, but you are to leave her at aunt Martha's. I shall meet her there at dinner time.\"  \"O, mamma, may I? I love you a hundred rooms full. Let me go bring my _buttoner bootner_ quick's a minute.\"  Flyaway was not long in getting ready. She was never long about anything.  \"You said we might have all the money, we three--didn't you, grandma?\" asked Dotty again, at the last moment, thinking how glad she was Jennie had gone home, and would not claim a share.  \"Yes,\" replied patient grandma for the fifth time; \"you may do anything you like with it, except to buy colored candy.\"  As they were trundling the wheelbarrow out of the yard, Horace came up from the garden.  \"Prudy,\" said he, with rather a shame-faced glance at his favorite cousin, \"you girls will cut a pretty figure, parading through the streets like a gang of pedlers. Come, let me be the driver.\"  \"O, we thought you couldn't leave your flower-beds, sir,\" replied Prudy, sweeping a courtesy.  \"Well, the weeds _are_ pretty tough, ma'am; roots 'way down in China, and the Emperor objects to parting with 'em; but--\"  \"Poh! we don't need any boys,\" cried the self-sustained Miss Dimple; \"if your hands are too soft, Prudy, you mustn't push. Wait and see what Dotty Dimple can do.\"  \"O, then, if you spurn me and my offer, good by. I suppose my little Topknot goes for _surplusage_,\" said Horace, who liked now and then to puzzle Dotty with a new word. He meant that Flyaway was of no use, but rather in the way.  \"No, she needn't do any such thing,\" returned Dotty. \"Jump in, Fly, and sit on the bag.\" And off moved the gay little party, \"the middle-aged sister\" laughing so she could hardly push, Flyaway dancing up and down on the rag-bag, like a humming-bird balancing itself on a twig; Grace and Susy looking down from the \"green chamber\" window, and saying to each other, with wounded family pride, \"_Should_ you think grandma would allow it?\" Out in the street the young rag-merchants were greeted by a cow lowing dismally. Flyaway, in her rustic carriage, felt as secure as the fabled \"kid on the roof of a house;\" so she called out, \"Don't cry, old cow; I 'shamed o' you.\"  At this Prudy and Dotty laughed harder than ever.  \"'Sh right up, old cow,\" said Flyaway, standing on her \"tipsy-toes,\" and making a threatening gesture with her little arms; \"'Sh right up!--O, why don't that cow mind in a minute?\"  In her earnestness the little girl pushed the bag to one side, and Prudy and Dotty, shaking with laughter, tipped over the wheelbarrow. No harm was done except to give Flyaway a dust-bath in her nice clean frock. Just as they were struggling with the bag, to get it in again, they were overtaken by a droll-looking equipage. It was a long house on wheels, and instantly reminded Dotty of Noah's ark.  \"O, a house a-ridin'! a house a-ridin'!\" exclaimed Flyaway, gazing after it with the greatest astonishment.  Dotty thought the world was going topsy-turvy. She looked at the trees to see if they stood fast in the ground. But Prudy explained it as soon as she could stop laughing.  \"Only a photograph saloon,\" said she. \"Didn't you ever see one before? We don't have them in the city going round so, but things are different in the country. Let's watch and see where it stops.\"  \"O, dear me,\" said Dotty; \"I shouldn't want to live in a house that couldn't stand still! Stove tipping over, and the gingerbread falling out of the oven! There, I declare!\"  The look of wonder on Dotty's face was so amusing that Prudy was obliged to hold on to her sides.  \"There, look!\" said she; \"it has stopped down by the corner. Now the man can bake his gingerbread if he wants to, and the stove won't tip over. Jump in, Flyaway, and finish your ride.\"  \"No-o,\" said Flyaway, wavering between her fear of the cow, some yards ahead, and her fear of the rocking, unsteady wheelbarrow. \"Guess I won't get in no more, Prudy; it wearies me.\"  \"Wearies you?\"  \"Yes: don't you know what 'wearies' means, Prudy? It means it makes me a--a--little--scared!\"  And in her \"weariness\" Flyaway nestled between her two cousins, and kept fast hold of their skirts till the cow was safely passed and the red store reached.  \"Bravo!\" exclaimed Mr. Bradley, the merchant, as he came out and dragged the rag-bag into the store; \"so you've taken the business into your own hands, my little women? Ah, this is a progressive age! Walk in--walk in.\"  Prudy blushed, Dotty smiled, and Flyaway took off her hat, as she usually did when she did not know what else to do.  \"Take some seats, young ladies,\" said Mr. Bradley, placing three chairs in a row, and bowing as if to the most distinguished visitors.
