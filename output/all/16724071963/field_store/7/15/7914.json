[Illustration: Plate V.   Origin of Âni´shinâ´bēg.]    This family went away in the autum to hunt, and during the winter this   woman’s son died. The parents were so much distressed that they   decided to return to the village and bury the body there; so they made   preparations to return, and as they traveled along, they would each   evening erect several poles upon which the body was placed to prevent   the wild beasts from devouring it. When the dead boy was thus hanging   upon the poles, the adopted child--who was the Sun Spirit--would play   about the camp and amuse himself, and finally told his adopted father   he pitied him, and his mother, for their sorrow. The adopted son said   he could bring his dead brother to life, whereupon the parents   expressed great surprise and desired to know how that could be   accomplished.    The adopted boy then had the party hasten to the village, when he   said, “Get the women to make a wig´iwam of bark (No. 16), put the dead   boy in a covering of birch bark and place the body on the ground in   the middle of the wig´iwam.” On the next morning after this had been   done, the family and friends went into this lodge and seated   themselves around the corpse.    When they had all been sitting quietly for some time, they saw through   the doorway the approach of a bear (No. 17) which gradually came   towards the wig´iwam, entered it, and placed itself before the dead   body and said hŭ, hŭ, hŭ, hŭ, when he passed around it towards the   left side, with a trembling motion, and as he did so, the body began   quivering, and the quivering increased as the bear continued until he   had passed around four times, when the body came to life again and   stood up. Then the bear called to the father, who was sitting in the   distant right-hand corner of the wig´iwam, and addressed to him the   following words:    Nōs        ka-wī´-na  ni´-shi-na´-bi  wis-sī´  a´-ya-wī´-an  man´-i-dō   My father  is not     an Indian       not      you are       a spirit    nin-gī´-sis.  Be-mai´-a-mī´-nik  ni´-dzhĭ  man´-i-dō  mī-a-zhĭ´-gwa   son.          Insomuch           my fellow spirit     now    tshí-gĭ-a´-we-ân´.  Nōs        a-zhĭ´-gwa  a-sē´-ma  tshi´-a-tō´-yēk.   as you are.         My father  now         tobacco   you shall put.    A´-mĭ-kŭn´-dem  mi-ē´-ta  â´-wi-dink´  dzhi-gŏsh´-kwi-tōt´   He speaks of    only      once         to be able to do it    wen´-dzhi-bi-mâ´-di-zid´-o-ma´  a-gâ´-wa  bi-mâ-dĭ-zĭd´-mi-o-ma´;   why he shall live here          now       that he scarcely lives;    ni-dzhĭ    man´-i-dō  mí-a-zhĭ´-gwa   tshí-gĭ-wĕ´-ân.   my fellow  spirit     now I shall go  home.    The little bear boy (No. 17) was the one who did this. He then   remained among the Indians (No. 18) and taught them the mysteries of   the Grand Medicine (No. 19); and, after he had finished, he told his   adopted father that as his mission had been fulfilled he was to return   to his kindred spirits, for the Indians would have no need to fear   sickness as they now possessed the Grand Medicine which would enable   them to live. He also said that his spirit could bring a body to life   but once, and he would now return to the sun from which they would   feel his influence.  This is called Kwí-wĭ-sĕns´ wĕ-dī´-shĭ-tshī gē-wī-nĭp-- “Little-boy-his-work.”  From subsequent information it was learned that the line No. 22 denotes the earth, and that, being considered as one step in the course of initiation into the Midē´wiwin, three others must be taken before a candidate can be admitted. These steps, or rests, as they are denominated (Nos. 23, 24, and 25), are typified by four distinct gifts of goods, which must be remitted to the Midē´ priests before the ceremony can take place.  Nos. 18 and 19 are repetitions of the figures alluded to in the tradition (Nos. 16 and 17) to signify that the candidate must personate the Makwa´ Man´idō--Bear Spirit--when entering the Midē´wiwin (No. 19). No. 20 is the Midē´ Man´idō as Ki´tshi Man´idō is termed by the Midē´ priests. The presence of horns attached to the head is a common symbol of superior power found in connection with the figures of human and divine forms in many Midē´ songs and other mnemonic records. No. 21 represents the earth’s surface, similar to that designated at No. 22.  Upon comparing the preceding tradition of the creation of the Indians with the following, which pertains to the descent to earth of Mi´nabō´zho, there appears to be some discrepancy, which could not be explained by Sikas´sigĕ, because he had forgotten the exact sequence of events; but from information derived from other Midē´ it is evident that there have been joined together two myths, the intervening circumstances being part of the tradition given below in connection with the narrative relating to the chart on Pl. III A.  This chart, which was in possession of the Mille Lacs chief Baiē´dzhĕk, was copied by him from that belonging to his preceptor at La Pointe about the year 1800, and although the traditions given by Sikas´sigĕ is similar to the one surviving at Red Lake, the diagram is an interesting variant for the reason that there is a greater amount of detail in the delineation of objects mentioned in the tradition.  By referring to Pl. IV it will be noted that the circle, No. 1, resembles the corresponding circle at the beginning of the record on Pl. III, A, with this difference, that the four quarters of the globe inhabited by the Ani´shinâ´bēg are not designated between the cardinal points at which the Otter appeared, and also that the central island, only alluded to there (Pl. III A), is here inserted.  The correct manner of arranging the two pictorial records, Pls. III A and IV, is by placing the outline of the earth’s surface (Pl. V, No. 21) upon the island indicated in Pl. IV, No. 6, so that the former stands vertically and at right angles to the latter; for the reason that the first half of the tradition pertains to the consultation held between Ki´tshi Man´idō and the four lesser spirits which is believed to have occurred above the earth’s surface. According to Sikas´sigĕ the two charts should be joined as suggested in the accompanying illustration, Fig. 2.    [Illustration: Fig. 2.--Sikas´sigĕ’s combined charts, showing descent   of Min´abō´zho.]    [Illustration: Plate VI.   Ojibwa Facial Decoration.]  Sikas´sigĕ’s explanation of the Mille Lacs chart (Pl. IV) is substantially as follows:    [Illustration: Fig. 3.--Origin of Ginseng.]    When Mi´nabō´zho descended to the earth to give to the Ani´shinâ´bēg   the Midē´wiwin, he left with them this chart, Midē´wigwas´. Ki´tshi   Man´idō saw that his people on earth were without the means of   protecting themselves against disease and death, so he sent   Mi´nabō´zho to give to them the sacred gift. Mi´nabō´zho appeared over   the waters and while reflecting in what manner he should be able to   communicate with the people, he heard something laugh, just as an   otter sometimes cries out. He saw something black appear upon the   waters in the west (No. 2) which immediately disappeared beneath the   surface again. Then it came up at the northern horizon (No. 3), which   pleased Mi´nabō´zho, as he thought he now had some one through whom he   might convey the information with which he had been charged by Ki´tshi   Man´idō. When the black object disappeared beneath the waters at the   north to reappear in the east (No. 4), Mi´nabō´zho desired it would   come to him in the middle of the waters, but it disappeared to make   its reappearance in the south (No. 5), where it again sank out of   sight to reappear in the west (No. 2), when Mi´nabō´zho asked it to   approach the center where there was an island (No. 6), which it did.   This did Ni´gĭk, the Otter, and for this reason he is given charge of   the first degree of the Midē´wiwin (Nos. 35 and 36) where his spirit   always abides during initiation and when healing the sick.    Then Ni´gĭk asked Mi´nabō´zho, “Why do you come to this place?” When   the latter said, “I have pity on the Ani´shinâ´bēg and wish to give   them life; Ki´tshi Man´idō gave me the power to confer upon them the   means of protecting themselves against sickness and death, and through   you I will give them the Midē´wiwin, and teach them the sacred rites.”    Then Mi´nabō´zho built a Midē´wigân in which he instructed the Otter   in all the mysteries of the Midē´wiwin. The Otter sat before the door   of the Midē´wigân four days (Nos. 7, 8, 9, and 10), sunning himself,   after which time he approached the entrance (No. 14), where his   progress was arrested (No. 11) by seeing two bad spirits (Nos. 12 and   13) guarding it. Through the powers possessed by Mi´nabō´zho he was   enabled to pass these; when he entered the sacred lodge (No. 15), the   first object he beheld being the sacred stone (No. 16) against which   those who were sick were to be seated, or laid, when undergoing the   ceremonial of restoring them to health. He next saw a post (No. 17)   painted red with a green band around the top. A sick man would also   have to pray to the stone and to the post, when he is within the   Midē´wigân, because within them would be the Midē´ spirits whose help   he invoked. The Otter was then taken to the middle of the Midē´wigân   where he picked up the mī´gis (No. 18) from among a heap of sacred   objects which form part of the gifts given by Ki´tshi Man´idō. The   eight man´idōs around the midē´wigân (Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,   and 26) were also sent by Ki´tshi Man´idō to guard the lodge against   the entrance of bad spirits.  A life is represented by the line No. 27, the signification of the short lines (Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 31) denoting that the course of human progress is beset by temptations and trials which may be the cause of one’s departure from such course of conduct as is deemed proper, and the "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19369"],["title","The Triumphs of Eugène Valmont (#0)"],["body","Distributed Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net                                   Transcriber's Note:      The Attribution and the Table of Contents are not part of the     original book.                               _The Triumphs of                             Eugène Valmont_                                     By                                Robert Barr         *       *       *       *       *     CONTENTS   1.  _The Mystery of the Five Hundred Diamonds_  2.  _The Siamese Twin of a Bomb-Thrower_  3.  _The Clue of the Silver Spoons_  4.  _Lord Chizelrigg's Missing Fortune_  5.  _The Absent-Minded Coterie_  6.  _The Ghost with the Club-Foot_  7.  _The Liberation of Wyoming Ed_  8.  _Lady Alicia's Emeralds_   APPENDIX: TWO SHERLOCK HOLMES PARODIES  1.

My occupation is that of private detective in London, but if you ask any policeman in Paris who Valmont was he will likely be able to tell you, unless he is a recent recruit. If you ask him where Valmont is now, he may not know, yet I have a good deal to do with the Parisian police.  For a period of seven years I was chief detective to the Government of France, and if I am unable to prove myself a great crime hunter, it is because the record of my career is in the secret archives of Paris.  I may admit at the outset that I have no grievances to air. The French Government considered itself justified in dismissing me, and it did so. In this action it was quite within its right, and I should be the last to dispute that right; but, on the other hand, I consider myself justified in publishing the following account of what actually occurred, especially as so many false rumours have been put abroad concerning the case. However, as I said at the beginning, I hold no grievance, because my worldly affairs are now much more prosperous than they were in Paris, my intimate knowledge of that city and the country of which it is the capital bringing to me many cases with which I have dealt more or less successfully since I established myself in London.  Without further preliminary I shall at once plunge into an account of the case which riveted the attention of the whole world a little more than a decade ago.  The year 1893 was a prosperous twelve months for France. The weather was good, the harvest excellent, and the wine of that vintage is celebrated to this day. Everyone was well off and reasonably happy, a marked contrast to the state of things a few years later, when dissension over the Dreyfus case rent the country in twain.  Newspaper readers may remember that in 1893 the Government of France fell heir to an unexpected treasure which set the civilised world agog, especially those inhabitants of it who are interested in historical relics. This was the finding of the diamond necklace in the Château de Chaumont, where it had rested undiscovered for a century in a rubbish heap of an attic. I believe it has not been questioned that this was the veritable necklace which the court jeweller, Boehmer, hoped to sell to Marie Antoinette, although how it came to be in the Château de Chaumont no one has been able to form even a conjecture. For a hundred years it was supposed that the necklace had been broken up in London, and its half a thousand stones, great and small, sold separately. It has always seemed strange to me that the Countess de Lamotte-Valois, who was thought to have profited by the sale of these jewels, should not have abandoned France if she possessed money to leave that country, for exposure was inevitable if she remained. Indeed, the unfortunate woman was branded and imprisoned, and afterwards was dashed to death from the third storey of a London house, when, in the direst poverty, she sought escape from the consequences of the debts she had incurred.  I am not superstitious in the least, yet this celebrated piece of treasure-trove seems actually to have exerted a malign influence over everyone who had the misfortune to be connected with it. Indeed, in a small way, I who write these words suffered dismissal and disgrace, though I caught but one glimpse of this dazzling scintillation of jewels. The jeweller who made the necklace met financial ruin; the Queen for whom it was constructed was beheaded; that high-born Prince Louis René Edouard, Cardinal de Rohan, who purchased it, was flung into prison; the unfortunate Countess, who said she acted as go-between until the transfer was concluded, clung for five awful minutes to a London window-sill before dropping to her death to the flags below; and now, a hundred and eight years later, up comes this devil's display of fireworks to the light again!  Droulliard, the working man who found the ancient box, seems to have prised it open, and ignorant though he was--he had probably never seen a diamond in his life before--realised that a fortune was in his grasp. The baleful glitter from the combination must have sent madness into his brain, working havoc therein as though the shafts of brightness were those mysterious rays which scientists have recently discovered. He might quite easily have walked through the main gate of the Château unsuspected and unquestioned with the diamonds concealed about his person, but instead of this he crept from the attic window on to the steep roof, slipped to the eaves, fell to the ground, and lay dead with a broken neck, while the necklace, intact, shimmered in the sunlight beside his body. No matter where these jewels had been found the Government would have insisted that they belonged to the Treasury of the Republic; but as the Château de Chaumont was a historical monument, and the property of France, there could be no question regarding the ownership of the necklace. The Government at once claimed it, and ordered it to be sent by a trustworthy military man to Paris. It was carried safely and delivered promptly to the authorities by Alfred Dreyfus, a young captain of artillery, to whom its custody had been entrusted.  In spite of its fall from the tall tower neither case nor jewels were perceptibly damaged. The lock of the box had apparently been forced by Droulliard's hatchet, or perhaps by the clasp knife found on his body. On reaching the ground the lid had flown open, and the necklace was thrown out.  I believe there was some discussion in the Cabinet regarding the fate of this ill-omened trophy, one section wishing it to be placed in a museum on account of its historical interest, another advocating the breaking up of the necklace and the selling of the diamonds for what they would fetch. But a third party maintained that the method to get the most money into the coffers of the country was to sell the necklace as it stood, for as the world now contains so many rich amateurs who collect undoubted rarities, regardless of expense, the historic associations of the jewelled collar would enhance the intrinsic value of the stones; and, this view prevailing, it was announced that the necklace would be sold by auction a month later in the rooms of Meyer, Renault and Co., in the Boulevard des Italiens, near the Bank of the Crédit-Lyonnais.  This announcement elicited much comment from the newspapers of all countries, and it seemed that, from a financial point of view at least, the decision of the Government had been wise, for it speedily became evident that a notable coterie of wealthy buyers would be congregated in Paris on the thirteenth (unlucky day for me!) when the sale was to take place. But we of the inner circle were made aware of another result somewhat more disquieting, which was that the most expert criminals in the world were also gathering like vultures upon the fair city. The honour of France was at stake. Whoever bought that necklace must be assured of a safe conduct out of the country. We might view with equanimity whatever happened afterwards, but while he was a resident of France his life and property must not be endangered. Thus it came about that I was given full authority to ensure that neither murder nor theft nor both combined should be committed while the purchaser of the necklace remained within our boundaries, and for this purpose the police resources of France were placed unreservedly at my disposal. If I failed there should be no one to blame but myself; consequently, as I have remarked before, I do not complain of my dismissal by the Government.  The broken lock of the jewel-case had been very deftly repaired by an expert locksmith, who in executing his task was so unfortunate as to scratch a finger on the broken metal, whereupon blood poisoning set in, and although his life was saved, he was dismissed from the hospital with his right arm gone and his usefulness destroyed.  When the jeweller Boehmer made the necklace he asked a hundred and sixty thousand pounds for it, but after years of disappointment he was content to sell it to Cardinal de Rohan for sixty-four thousand pounds, to be liquidated in three instalments, not one of which was ever paid. This latter amount was probably somewhere near the value of the five hundred and sixteen separate stones, one of which was of tremendous size, a very monarch of diamonds, holding its court among seventeen brilliants each as large as a filbert. This iridescent concentration of wealth was, as one might say, placed in my care, and I had to see to it that no harm came to the necklace or to its prospective owner until they were safely across the boundaries of France.  The four weeks previous to the thirteenth proved a busy and anxious time for me. Thousands, most of whom were actuated by mere curiosity, wished to view the diamonds. We were compelled to discriminate, and sometimes discriminated against the wrong person, which caused unpleasantness."]]]
