The radish should be freshly grated, and added to the cream after it is beaten.   =Dressing for Cole-Slaw.=  Beat the yolks of three eggs with half a teaspoonful of made mustard, a dash of pepper and one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt; add one-third a cup of vinegar and two tablespoonfuls of butter, and cook over hot water until slightly thickened. Set aside to become cold before using.   =Bacon Sauce.=  Heat five tablespoonfuls of bacon fat; cook in it two tablespoonfuls of flour and a dash of paprica; add five tablespoonfuls of vinegar and half a cup of water; stir until boiling; then beat in the beaten yolks of two eggs, and a little salt if necessary. Do not allow the sauce to boil after the eggs are added. Add to salad after it has become thoroughly cold. Good with dandelion, endive, chicory, corn salad or lettuce.   =Hollandaise Sauce.=  Beat half a cup of butter to a cream; add the yolks of four eggs, one at a time, beating in each thoroughly; add one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of paprica or cayenne, and half a cup of boiling water. Cook over hot water until thick, adding gradually the juice of half a lemon. Chill before using. This is good, especially for a fish salad, in the place of mayonnaise.   =Bernaise Sauce.=  Use tarragon instead of plain vinegar, omit the water, with the exception of one tablespoonful, and the hollandaise becomes bernaise sauce. Oil may be used in the place of butter. The sauce resembles a firm mayonnaise, and, as it keeps its shape well, is particularly adapted for garnishing with pastry bag and tube.  [Illustration: Cucumber Salad for Fish Course.  (See page 36)]  [Illustration: Cooked Vegetable Salad  (See page 37)]     VEGETABLE SALADS SERVED WITH FRENCH DRESSING.            \"Bestrewed with lettuce and cool salad herbs.\"   =Lettuce Salad.=  Wash and drain the lettuce leaves; toss lightly, so as to remove every drop of water. Sprinkle them with oil, a few drops at a time, tossing the leaves about with spoon and fork after each addition. When each leaf glistens with oil (there should be no oil in the bottom of the bowl) shake over them a few drops of vinegar, then dust with salt and freshly ground pepper. The cutting of lettuce is considered a culinary sin; but, when the straight-leaved lettuce, or the Romaine, is to be used, better effects, at least as far as appearance is concerned, will be produced, if the lettuce be cut into ribbons. To do this, wash the lettuce carefully, without removing the leaves from the stem; fold together across the centre, and with a sharp, thin knife cut into ribbons _less_ than half an inch in width.   =Endive Salad.=  Prepare as lettuce salad, first rubbing over the bowl with a clove of garlic cut in halves. A few sprigs of chives, chopped fine, are exceedingly palatable, sprinkled over a lettuce, endive, string-bean, or other bean salad.   =A Few Combinations.=  Dress each vegetable separately with the dressing; then arrange upon the serving-dish. Or, have the salad arranged upon the serving-dish and pour the dressing over all; then toss together and serve. About three tablespoonfuls of oil, with other ingredients in accordance, will be needed for one pint of vegetable.  1. Lettuce, tomatoes cut in halves, sprinkled with powdered tarragon, and parsley or chives.  2. Lettuce, moulded spinach and fine-chopped beets.  3. Lettuce, Boston baked beans and chives.  4. Lettuce and peppergrass.  5. Lettuce, shredded sweet peppers or pimentos, and sliced pecan nuts or almonds.  6. Lettuce, tomatoes stuffed with peas or string beans cut small, and chives chopped fine.  7. Lettuce, asparagus tips and sliced radishes. Arrange the lettuce at the edge of dish, inside a ring of radishes sliced thin, without removing the red skins; centre of asparagus tips, with radish cut to resemble a flower.  8. Lettuce, shredded tomatoes and shredded green peppers.  9. Shredded lettuce, English walnuts, and almonds or cooked chestnuts, sliced.  10. Lettuce, Neufchatel cheese in slices and shredded pimentos.  11. Lettuce, cauliflower, string beans and shredded pimentos.  12. Lettuce or cress, artichoke slices and powdered tarragon.  13. Shredded cabbage and shredded green peppers.  14. Cauliflower broken into flowerets, string beans cut into small pieces, and beets cut in fancy shapes or chopped. Arrange each vegetable in a mass by itself; surround with lettuce.  15. Cucumbers and new onions, sliced.  16. Watercress, diced boiled beets, and olives in centre.  17. Lettuce, Brussels sprouts and chopped pepper.   =Lentil Salad.=  Soak the lentils over night; wash and rinse thoroughly, then cook until tender, adding hot water as needed. Drain, and when cold mix with each pint of lentils about five tablespoonfuls of oil, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar and one teaspoonful, each, of capers, parsley, chives and cucumber pickles, all, save the capers, chopped fine. Serve in a mound, on a bed of lettuce leaves. Garnish with heart leaves of lettuce at the top and sections of tomato, or diamonds of tomato jelly, at the base.   =White-Bean Salad.=  Toss one pint of white beans, cooked, with one tablespoonful of vinegar and three tablespoonfuls of oil, a little salt and a dash of cayenne or paprica. Arrange in a mound on a bed of shredded lettuce, and sprinkle with chives, parsley and pimentos, all finely chopped. Finish the top of the salad with a large pim-ola.   =Potato Salad.=  (MISS COHEN.)  INGREDIENTS.            3 cups of cold boiled potatoes, cut in cubes.           1 cup of pecan nuts, broken in pieces.           5 tablespoonfuls of oil.           1 tablespoonful of salt.           1/2 a teaspoonful of onion juice.           A dash of cayenne.           2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.           Watercress.  _Method._--Mix the potatoes and nuts, add the oil and mix again; add the other seasonings, and, when well mixed, set aside in a cool place an hour or more. Remove the coarse stalks from two bunches of watercress that have been well washed and dried. Season with French dressing and arrange in a wreath about the edge of the salad.  [Illustration: Potato Balls, Pecan Meats, and Cress Salad.]   [Illustration: Potato-and-Nasturtium Salad.  (See page 34)]   =Potato Salad.=  (CARRIE M. DEARBORN.)  INGREDIENTS.            12 cold boiled potatoes.           4 cooked eggs.           2 small Bermuda onions.           Chopped parsley.           1 saltspoonful of white pepper.           2 teaspoonfuls of salt.           6 tablespoonfuls, each, of oil and vinegar.           1/2 a teaspoonful of powdered sugar.  _Method._--Cut the potatoes into dice and chop the eggs fine. Chop the onions, or slice them very thin. Sprinkle the potatoes, eggs and onions with the salt and pepper, and mix thoroughly. Pour the oil gradually over the mixture, stirring and tossing continually; lastly, mix with the other ingredients the vinegar, in which the sugar has been dissolved. Sprinkle chopped parsley over the top.   =Potato Salad.=  INGREDIENTS.            1 quart of cubes of cold boiled potatoes.           1-1/2 teaspoonfuls of salt.           1/4 a teaspoonful of paprica.           3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.           4 tablespoonfuls of oil.           Capers, beets, whites and yolks of eggs, and lettuce.  _Method._--To the potato cubes add the salt, pepper and oil, and mix thoroughly; add the vinegar and mix again. Pile the cubes in a mound in the salad-bowl. Mark out the surface of the mound into quarters with capers; fill in two opposite sections with chopped beet; use chopped whites of eggs in a third, and sifted yolks of eggs in the fourth section. Finish with a border of parsley.   =Potato-and-Nasturtium Salad.=  (E. J. MCKENZIE.)  INGREDIENTS.            1 quart of potatoes, cut in cubes.           1/2 a cup of chopped gherkins.           1 cup of tender nasturtium shoots, cut in bits.           2 tablespoonfuls of pickled nasturtium seeds.           Onion juice or garlic.           6 tablespoonfuls of oil.           5 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.           Salt and pepper.           Chopped parsley.  _Method._--Mix the potatoes, gherkins, nasturtium shoots and seeds in a bowl rubbed over with garlic; add the oil, vinegar and seasonings, and mix again. Pile in a mound on a serving-dish, dust with chopped parsley, and garnish with a wreath of nasturtium blossoms and leaves.   =Stuffed Beets.=  Boil new beets, of even size, until tender. Set aside for some hours, or over night, covered with vinegar. When ready to serve, rub off the skin, scoop out the centre of each to form a cup, and arrange the cups on lettuce leaves. For each five cups chop fine a cucumber. Make a French dressing of two tablespoonfuls of oil, half a tablespoonful (scant) of vinegar, one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of paprica and salt. Stir the dressing into the cucumber and fill the beets with the mixture. Of the beet removed to form the cups, cut slices and stamp out from these stars or other fanciful shapes, and use to decorate the top of each cup.  Chopped radish, cress, olives or celery are all admissible for a filling.   =Salad of Brussels Sprouts and Beets.=  Soak the sprouts in salted water; then drain and cook in salted boiling water about fifteen minutes, or until tender; drain and cool. Dress with French dressing and pile in a mound. Finish the top with a fanciful-shaped figure cut from a slice of pickled beet, and place a wreath of cooked beet, chopped and seasoned with French dressing, about the whole.   =Macedoine Salad.=  Cut pieces of carrot and turnip one inch long and half an inch thick. Put over the fire in boiling water and bring quickly to the boiling-point; drain, cover with fresh water, and cook until tender; score the top of each piece and insert an asparagus point. Dip the pieces in a little melted gelatine and set alternately in a circle on the serving-dish. Have carrots cut in small cubes or straws,"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19077"],["title","Salads, Sandwiches and Chafing-Dish Dainties (#5)"],["body","and beet root the same, green string beans cut in small pieces, asparagus and peas, all cooked separately until tender. Mix with French dressing and dispose inside the circle. Each vegetable may be massed by itself, or all may be mixed together. Finish the top with half a dozen short stalks of asparagus.   =Tomato-and-Onion Salad.=  Peel and shred four tomatoes; slice thinly a very mild onion and separate into rings; dress freely with oil and tarragon vinegar, and season with salt and pepper. Serve on lettuce leaves, sprinkling the whole with fine-chopped parsley and green peppers.   =Endive,-Tomato-and-Green-String-Bean Salad.=  Dress the well-blanched stalks of a head of endive, three tomatoes, peeled, cut in halves and chilled, and a cup of cold cooked string beans, separately, with French dressing, using in the dressing tarragon vinegar and a few drops of onion juice; then arrange on a serving-dish.  [Illustration: Endive, Tomato, and Green String Bean Salad.]  [Illustration: Stuffed Beets.  (See page 34)]   =Cucumber Salad.=  (_German style._)  Pare large cucumbers and cut them into thin slices; cut each slice round and round so as to form a long, narrow curling strip. Let these strips stand two hours in salted ice water, drain, and dry in a soft cloth. Serve with French dressing. Toss first in the oil, then add the condiments, and lastly the vinegar. Americans would prefer to omit the salt from the ice water, as it softens the cucumber.   =Cucumber Salad for Fish Course.=  With a handy slicer remove the outside rind from the cucumbers, cut in thin slices, and let stand in ice-water to chill. Wipe dry, and arrange the slices in the salad bowl in the form of a Greek cross. Make a French dressing, in the proportion of three tablespoonfuls of cider vinegar to six tablespoonfuls of oil, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of paprica. Rub the inside of the salad bowl with the cut side of an onion before the salad is disposed in it.   =Cooked Vegetable Salad.=  Dress cooked kidney beans, peas, and balls cut from potatoes, each separately with French dressing, to which a few drops of onion juice have been added. Dispose upon a serving-dish and let stand in a cool place an hour or more. Garnish at serving with heart leaves of lettuce.   =Potato Salad.=  (_German Style._)  INGREDIENTS.            1 quart of potato slices or cubes.           About 1/2 a cup of beef broth.           1 teaspoonful of salt.           1/2 a teaspoonful of paprica.           8 tablespoonfuls of oil.           1 tablespoonful of grated onion.           2 hard boiled eggs.           4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar.           1 teaspoonful of mustard.           1 teaspoonful of sugar.           Fine chopped parsley.           (1 cup of mushrooms.)  _Method._--Boil the potatoes without paring. German potatoes, which are waxy rather than mealy, may be procured in large cities especially for salads. Peel the potatoes and cut them while hot into slices or cubes; pour over them as much beef broth as they will readily absorb and sprinkle with the salt and pepper, the oil and onion; mix lightly and set aside for some hours. Then add the whites of the eggs chopped fine, the yolks passed through a sieve, and mix with the rest of the oil, stirred with the vinegar into the mustard and sugar. After disposing in the dish, sprinkle with the parsley. If mushrooms be at hand, simmer ten or fifteen minutes in broth, break in pieces, and add to the salad with the egg.     SALADS, LARGELY VEGETABLE, SERVED WITH MAYONNAISE, CREAM OR BOILED DRESSING.   =Cauliflower Salad.=  Soak the cauliflower in salted water an hour; cook in boiling salted water until tender; drain and chill, then sprinkle with French dressing and set aside for half an hour. Sever the flowerets partly from the stalk, but so as not to change their relative positions, and place on a serving-dish; put heart leaves of lettuce between the flowerets and about the base of the vegetable; pour a cup of mayonnaise dressing over the whole, and sprinkle with pimentos or fine-chopped parsley. In serving, separate the flowerets with a sharp knife.   =Tomatoes Stuffed with Nuts and Celery.=  Peel the tomatoes; cut out a circular piece at the stem end of each and scoop out the flesh so as to form cups. Chill thoroughly, then fill with English walnut or pecan meats, broken into pieces, and celery, cut into small pieces and mixed with mayonnaise. Serve on lettuce leaves.   =Stuffed-Tomato Salad.=  INGREDIENTS.            6 smooth, small-sized tomatoes.           6 tablespoonfuls of chicken, veal or tongue, cut fine.           6 tablespoonfuls of peas.           3 olives, chopped fine.           3 gherkins, chopped fine.           2 tablespoonfuls of capers.           Salt and pepper.           Mayonnaise dressing.  _Method._--Remove a round piece from the stem end of the tomatoes and scoop out the seeds and centre. Chill thoroughly. When ready to serve, mix together the solid part removed from the tomatoes, cut fine, and the other ingredients; season to taste with salt and pepper, adding also mayonnaise to hold the mixture together. With this fill the tomatoes, put them in nests of lettuce or cress, and force a star of mayonnaise on the top of each tomato.   =Tomato Salad, Horseradish Dressing.=  Plunge the tomatoes, placed in a wire basket, into a kettle of hot water; remove at once and rub off the skin; chill thoroughly and cut in halves. Serve on lettuce leaves with a star of cream dressing, seasoned with grated horseradish, on the top of each slice.   =Tomato-and-Sweetbread Salad.=  Cook two sweetbreads as directed on another page, or braise with vegetables. Cool between two plates bearing a weight. When cold cut into slices and stamp into rounds of suitable size to use with slices of tomato. Cover the slices of sweetbread with chaud-froid sauce and decorate with fine-chopped parsley or sifted yolk of egg; pour over a little melted aspic. When the aspic is set, trim neatly, and arrange each round of sweetbread on a slice of chilled tomato. Serve inside a border of lettuce around a salad made of the trimmings of the sweetbreads and a cucumber cut in cubes and dressed with mayonnaise.  [Illustration: Cress, Cucumber, and Tomato Salad.  (See page 41)]  [Illustration: Tomato Jelly with Celery and Nuts.  (See page 43)]   =Cress,-Cucumber-and-Tomato Salad.=  Wash the cress and shake dry; arrange as a bed on a serving-dish, discarding the coarse stems; above this make a smaller bed of cucumbers, cut in slices or dice and dressed with French dressing, using three tablespoonfuls of oil and one of vinegar or lemon juice to a pint of cucumber. Arrange peeled tomatoes, chilled and cut in pieces, upon the cucumbers. Serve with French, cream or mayonnaise dressing.   =Tomatoes Stuffed with Cucumber.=  Peel five tomatoes, cut off the stem ends and scoop out the pulp, thus forming cups; set, turned upside down, in a cool place. Chop fine the solid pulp from the tomatoes and one cucumber, chilled before chopping; stir into a cup of cream dressing and fill the tomatoes with the mixture. Salt and pepper will be needed in addition to that in the dressing. If at hand, a pimento may be chopped with the other ingredients, or two tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish may be used. Serve at once on lettuce leaves.   =Tomatoes Stuffed with Jelly.=  Chop one sweetbread and one cucumber fine. To each cup (solid and liquid) add one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of salt and paprica, a few drops of onion juice and a tablespoonful of capers; add also half a tablespoonful of granulated gelatine, soaked in two or three tablespoonfuls of cold water and melted over hot water. Stir until the mixture begins to congeal, then fill into tomatoes prepared as above. Set aside on the ice for half an hour, at least; then serve on lettuce leaves with either mayonnaise, boiled or cream dressing. Calf's brains, chicken, veal, tongue or ham may be substituted for the sweetbread.   =Tomatoes Farces à l'Aspic.=  INGREDIENTS.            6 even-sized ripe tomatoes.           1 pint of aspic jelly.           1/2 a cup of lobster meat, chopped fine.           1 tablespoonful of capers.           2 yolks of hard-boiled eggs.           Mayonnaise, parsley, lettuce.  _Method._--Scoop out the centres of the tomatoes, after removing the skin, and chill thoroughly. Pass the yolks through a sieve, add to the lobster, with the capers, half a cup of mayonnaise and half a cup of chicken aspic, thick and cold, but not set; stir these in a dish standing in ice water until nearly set; then fill the cavities in the tomatoes with the mixture. Brush over the outside of the tomatoes with half-set aspic; when the aspic is set, repeat twice, then set aside on ice for some time before serving. Serve on a bed of lettuce seasoned with French dressing. Garnish each tomato with a sprig of parsley and the salad-dish with blocks of aspic. Anchovies or any cooked fish may be substituted for the lobster. Serve with mayonnaise.   =Tomato Jelly.=  Soak three-fourths a box of gelatine in half a cup of cold water. Cook a can of tomatoes, half an onion, a stalk of celery, a bay leaf, two cloves, a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of paprica ten minutes. Add two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar and the gelatine, stir till dissolved, strain, and mould in a ring mould. When cold turn from the mould and fill the centre with   =CELERY-AND-NUT SALAD.=  Cut fine tender stalks of celery and English walnuts and mix with French dressing. Garnish the centre of the salad and the border of the jelly with tender leaves of lettuce and bits of curled celery.   =Tomato-Jelly Salad, No. 2.=  Make the jelly and mould as before. Fill in the centre of the ring with shredded cabbage, pimentos and pecan nuts, mixed with boiled dressing.   =Tomato Jelly with String Beans.=  Cook tiny string beans until tender in boiling salted water; season while hot with onion juice, salt, pepper and tarragon vinegar.
