Then he saw the bearskin bundle under Raud's arm. \"You brought it with you? But didn't you believe that we were coming?\"  \"Are you going to let us have it?\" Salvadro was asking.  \"Yes; I will sell it to you, for the price you offered. I am not fit to be Keeper any longer. I lost it. It was stolen from me, the day after I saw you, and I have only yesterday gotten it back. Both my dogs were killed, too. I can no longer keep it safe. Better that you take it with you to Dremna, away from this world where it was made. I have thought, before, that this world and I are both old and good for nothing any more.\"  \"This world may be old, Keeper,\" Dranigo said, \"but it is the Mother-World, Terra, the world that sent Man to the Stars. And you--when you lost the Crown, you recovered it again.\"  \"The next time, I won't be able to. Too many people will know that the Crown is worth stealing, and the next time, they'll kill me first.\"  \"Well, we said we'd give you twenty thousand trade-tokens for it,\" Salvadro said. \"We'll have them for you as soon as we can draw them from the Government bank, here. Or give you a check and let you draw them as you want them.\" Raud didn't understand that, and Salvadro didn't try to explain. \"And then we'll fly you home.\"  He shook his head. \"No, I have no home. The place where you saw me is Keeper's House, and I am not the Keeper any more. I will stay here and find a place to live, and pay somebody to take care of me....\"  With twenty thousand trade-tokens, he could do that. It would buy a house in which he could live, and he could find some woman who had lost her man, who would do his work for him. But he must be careful of the money. Dig a crypt in the corner of his house for it. He wondered if he could find a pair of good dogs and train them to guard it for him....         *       *       *       *       *"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19347"],["title","The Myths of the New World (#0)"],["body","was produced from images generously made available by the Canadian Institute for Historical Microreproductions (www.canadiana.org))      Transcriber's Note  A number of typographical errors and inconsistencies have been maintained in this version of this book.

I have written this work more for the thoughtful general reader than the antiquary. It is a study of an obscure portion of the intellectual history of our species as exemplified in one of its varieties.  What are man's earliest ideas of a soul and a God, and of his own origin and destiny? Why do we find certain myths, such as of a creation, a flood, an after-world; certain symbols, as the bird, the serpent, the cross; certain numbers, as the three, the four, the seven--intimately associated with these ideas by every race? What are the laws of growth of natural religions? How do they acquire such an influence, and is this influence for good or evil? Such are some of the universally interesting questions which I attempt to solve by an analysis of the simple faiths of a savage race.  If in so doing I succeed in investing with a more general interest the fruitful theme of American ethnology, my objects will have been accomplished.    PHILADELPHIA,   April, 1868.     CONTENTS.   CHAPTER I.  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS OF THE RED RACE.                                                                      PAGE Natural religions the unaided attempts of man to find out God, modified by peculiarities of race and nation.--The peculiarities of the red race: 1. Its languages unfriendly to abstract ideas. Native modes of writing by means of pictures, symbols, objects, and phonetic signs. These various methods compared in their influence on the intellectual faculties. 2.

An intuition common to the species.--Words expressing it in American languages derived either from ideas of above in space, or of life manifested by breath.--Examples.--No conscious monotheism, and but little idea of immateriality discoverable.--Still less any moral dualism of deities, the Great Good Spirit and the Great Bad Spirit being alike terms and notions of foreign importation                   43   CHAPTER III.  THE SACRED NUMBER, ITS ORIGIN AND APPLICATIONS.  The number Four sacred in all American religions, and the key to their symbolism.--Derived from the CARDINAL POINTS.--Appears constantly in government, arts, rites, and myths.--The Cardinal Points identified with the Four Winds, who in myths are the four ancestors of the human race, and the four celestial rivers watering the terrestrial Paradise.--Associations grouped around each Cardinal Point.--From the number four was derived the symbolic value of the number _Forty_ and the _Sign of the Cross_                                                66   CHAPTER IV.  THE SYMBOLS OF THE BIRD AND THE SERPENT.  Relations of man to the lower animals.--Two of these, the BIRD and the SERPENT, chosen as symbols beyond all others.--The Bird throughout America the symbol of the Clouds and Winds.--Meaning of certain species.--The symbolic meaning of the Serpent derived from its mode of locomotion, its poisonous bite, and its power of charming.--Usually the symbol of the lightning and the Waters.--The Rattlesnake the symbolic species in America.--The war charm.--The Cross of Palenque.--The god of riches.--Both symbols devoid of moral significance                                                           99   CHAPTER V.

THE SUPREME GODS OF THE RED RACE.  Analysis of American culture myths.--The Manibozho or Michabo of the Algonkins shown to be an impersonation of LIGHT, a hero of the Dawn, and their highest deity.--The myths of Ioskeha of the Iroquois, Viracocha of the Peruvians, and Quetzalcoatl of the Toltecs essentially the same as that of Michabo.--Other examples.--Ante-Columbian prophecies of the advent of a white race from the east as conquerors.--Rise of later culture myths under similar forms                                                         159   CHAPTER VII.  THE MYTHS OF THE CREATION, THE DELUGE, THE EPOCHS OF NATURE, AND THE LAST DAY.  Cosmogonies usually portray the action of the SPIRIT on the WATERS.--Those of the Muscogees, Athapascas, Quichés, Mixtecs, Iroquois, Algonkins, and others.--The Flood-Myth an unconscious attempt to reconcile a creation in time with the eternity of matter.--Proof of this from American mythology.--Characteristics of American Flood-Myths.--The person saved usually the first man.--The number seven.--Their Ararats.--The rôle of birds.--The confusion of tongues.--The Aztec, Quiché, Algonkin, Tupi, and earliest Sanscrit flood-myths.--The belief in Epochs of Nature a further result of this attempt at reconciliation.--Its forms among Peruvians, Mayas, and Aztecs.--The expectation of the End of the World a corollary of this belief.--Views of various nations                                     193   CHAPTER VIII.  THE ORIGIN OF MAN.  Usually man is the EARTH-BORN, both in language and myths.--Illustrations from the legends of the Caribs, Apalachians, Iroquois, Quichuas, Aztecs, and others.--The under-world.--Man the product of one of the primal creative powers, the Spirit, or the Water, in the myths of the Athapascas, Eskimos, Moxos, and others--Never literally derived from an inferior species              222   CHAPTER IX.  THE SOUL AND ITS DESTINY.  Universality of the belief in a soul and a future state shown by the aboriginal tongues, by expressed opinions, and by sepulchral rites. The future world never a place of rewards and punishments.--The house of the Son the heaven of the red man.--The terrestrial paradise and the under-world.--Çupay.--Xibalba.--Mictlan.--Metempsychosis?--Belief in a resurrection of the dead almost universal                        233   CHAPTER X.  THE NATIVE PRIESTHOOD.  Their titles.--Practitioners of the healing art by supernatural means.--Their power derived from natural magic and the exercise of the clairvoyant and mesmeric faculties.--Examples.--Epidemic hysteria.--Their social position.--Their duties as religious functionaries.--Terms of admission to the Priesthood.--Inner organization in various nations.--Their esoteric language and secret societies                                                             263   CHAPTER XI.  THE INFLUENCE OF THE NATIVE RELIGIONS ON THE MORAL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE RACE.  Natural religions hitherto considered of Evil rather than of Good.--Distinctions to be drawn.--Morality not derived from religion.--The positive side of natural religions in incarnations of divinity.--Examples.--Prayers as indices of religious progress.--Religion and social advancement.--Conclusion               287     THE MYTHS OF THE NEW WORLD.
