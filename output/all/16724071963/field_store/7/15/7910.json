The Ojibwa is one of the largest tribes of the United States, and it is scattered over a considerable area, from the Province of Ontario, on the east, to the Red River of the North, on the west, and from Manitoba southward through the States of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. This tribe is, strictly speaking, a timber people, and in its westward migration or dispersion has never passed beyond the limit of the timber growth which so remarkably divides the State of Minnesota into two parts possessing distinct physical features. The western portion of this State is a gently undulating prairie which sweeps away to the Rocky Mountains, while the eastern portion is heavily timbered. The dividing line, at or near the meridian of 95° 50' west longitude, extends due north and south, and at a point about 75 miles south of the northern boundary the timber line trends toward the northwest, crossing the State line, 49° north latitude, at about 97° 10' west longitude.  Minnesota contains many thousand lakes of various sizes, some of which are connected by fine water courses, while others are entirely isolated. The wooded country is undulating, the elevated portions being covered chiefly with pine, fir, spruce, and other coniferous trees, and the lowest depressions being occupied by lakes, ponds, or marshes, around which occur the tamarack, willow, and other trees which thrive in moist ground, while the regions between these extremes are covered with oak, poplar, ash, birch, maple, and many other varieties of trees and shrubs.  Wild fowl, game, and fish are still abundant, and until recently have furnished to the Indians the chief source of subsistence.  Tribal organization according to the totemic system is practically broken up, as the Indians are generally located upon or near the several reservations set apart for them by the General Government, where they have been under more or less restraint by the United States Indian agents and the missionaries. Representatives of various totems or gentes may therefore be found upon a single reservation, where they continue to adhere to traditional customs and beliefs, thus presenting an interesting field for ethnologic research.  The present distribution of the Ojibwa in Minnesota and Wisconsin is indicated upon the accompanying map, Pl. II. In the southern portion many of these people have adopted civilized pursuits, but throughout the northern and northwestern part many bands continue to adhere to their primitive methods and are commonly designated “wild Indians.” The habitations of many of the latter are rude and primitive. The bands on the northeast shore of Red Lake, as well as a few others farther east, have occupied these isolated sites for an uninterrupted period of about three centuries, as is affirmed by the chief men of the several villages and corroborated by other traditional evidence.  Father Claude Alloüez, upon his arrival in 1666 at Shagawaumikong, or La Pointe, found the Ojibwa preparing to attack the Sioux. The settlement at this point was an extensive one, and in traditions pertaining to the “Grand Medicine Society” frequent allusion is made to the"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19368"],["title","The Mide'wiwin or \"Grand Medicine Society\" of the Ojibwa (#1)"],["body"," that at this place the rites were practiced in their greatest purity.  Mr. Warren, in his History of the Ojibwa Indians,[1] bases his belief upon traditional evidence that the Ojibwa first had knowledge of the whites in 1612. Early in the seventeenth century the French missionaries met with various tribes of the Algonkian linguistic stock, as well as with bands or subtribes of the Ojibwa Indians. One of the latter, inhabiting the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie, is frequently mentioned in the Jesuit Relations as the Saulteurs. This term was applied to all those people who lived at the Falls, but from other statements it is clear that the Ojibwa formed the most important body in that vicinity. La Hontan speaks of the “Outchepoues, alias Sauteurs,” as good warriors. The name Saulteur survives at this day and is applied to a division of the tribe.      [Footnote 1: Coll. Minn. Hist. Soc., 1885, vol. 5, p. 130.]  According to statements made by numerous Ojibwa chiefs of importance the tribe began its westward dispersion from La Pointe and Fond du Lac at least two hundred and fifty years ago, some of the bands penetrating the swampy country of northern Minnesota, while others went westward and southwestward. According to a statement[2] of the location of the tribes of Lake Superior, made at Mackinaw in 1736, the Sioux then occupied the southern and northern extremities of that lake. It is possible, however, that the northern bands of the Ojibwa may have penetrated the region adjacent to the Pigeon River and passed west to near their present location, thus avoiding their enemies who occupied the lake shore south of them.      [Footnote 2: Reproduced from the ninth volume of the New York     Colonial Documents, pp. 1054, 1055.]    [Illustration: Plate II.   Ojibwa Indian Reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

XV Grand Portage.]  From recent investigations among a number of tribes of the Algonkian linguistic division it is found that the traditions and practices pertaining to the Midē´wiwin, Society of the Midē´ or Shamans, popularly designated as the “Grand Medicine Society,” prevailed generally, and the rites are still practiced at irregular intervals, though in slightly different forms in various localities.  In the reports of early travelers and missionaries no special mention is made of the Midē´, the Jes´sakkīd´, or the Wâbĕnō´, but the term sorcerer or juggler is generally employed to designate that class of persons who professed the power of prophecy, and who practiced incantation and administered medicinal preparations. Constant reference is made to the opposition of these personages to the introduction of Christianity. In the light of recent investigation the cause of this antagonism is seen to lie in the fact that the traditions of Indian genesis and cosmogony and the ritual of initiation into the Society of the Midē´ constitute what is to them a religion, even more powerful and impressive than the Christian religion is to the average civilized man. This opposition still exists among the leading classes of a number of the Algonkian tribes, and especially among the Ojibwa, many bands of whom have been more or less isolated and beyond convenient reach of the Church. The purposes of the society are twofold; first, to preserve the traditions just mentioned, and second, to give a certain class of ambitious men and women sufficient influence through their acknowledged power of exorcism and necromancy to lead a comfortable life at the expense of the credulous. The persons admitted into the society are firmly believed to possess the power of communing with various supernatural beings--manidos--and in order that certain desires may be realized they are sought after and consulted. The purpose of the present paper is to give an account of this society and of the ceremony of initiation as studied and observed at White Earth, Minnesota, in 1889. Before proceeding to this, however, it may be of interest to consider a few statements made by early travelers respecting the “sorcerers or jugglers” and the methods of medication.  In referring to the practices of the Algonkian tribes of the Northwest, La Hontan[3] says:    When they are sick, they only drink Broth, and eat sparingly; and if   they have the good luck to fall asleep, they think themselves cur’d:   They have told me frequently, that sleeping and sweating would cure   the most stubborn Diseases in the World. When they are so weak that   they cannot get out of Bed, their Relations come and dance and make   merry before ’em, in order to divert ’em. To conclude, when they are   ill, they are always visited by a sort of Quacks, (_Jongleurs_); of   whom ’t will now be proper to subjoin two or three Words by the bye.    A _Jongleur_ is a sort of _Physician_, or rather a _Quack_, who being   once cur’d of some dangerous Distemper, has the Presumption and Folly   to fancy that he is immortal, and possessed of the Power of curing all   Diseases, by speaking to the Good and Evil Spirits. Now though every   Body rallies upon these Fellows when they are absent, and looks upon   ’em as Fools that have lost their Senses by some violent Distemper,   yet they allow ’em to visit the Sick; whether it be to divert ’em with   their Idle Stories, or to have an Opportunity of seeing them rave,   skip about, cry, houl, and make Grimaces and Wry Faces, as if they   were possess’d. When all the Bustle is over, they demand a Feast of a   Stag and some large Trouts for the Company, who are thus regal’d at   once with Diversion and Good Cheer.    When the Quack comes to visit the Patient, he examines him very   carefully; _If the Evil Spirit be here_, says he, _we shall quickly   dislodge him._ This said, he withdraws by himself to a little Tent   made on purpose, where he dances, and sings houling like an Owl;   (which gives the Jesuits Occasion to say, _That the Devil converses   with ’em_.) After he has made an end of this Quack Jargon, he comes   and rubs the Patient in some part of his Body, and pulling some little   Bones out of his Mouth, acquaints the Patient, _That these very Bones   came out of his Body; that he ought to pluck up a good heart, in   regard that his Distemper is but a Trifle; and in fine, that in order   to accelerate the Cure, ’t will be convenient to send his own and his   Relations Slaves to shoot Elks, Deer, &c., to the end they may all eat   of that sort of Meat, upon which his Cure does absolutely depend._    Commonly these Quacks bring ’em some Juices of Plants, which are a   sort of Purges, and are called _Maskikik_.      [Footnote 3: New Voyages to North America, London, 1703, vol. 2,     pp. 47, 48.]  Hennepin, in “A Continuation of the New Discovery,” etc.,[4] speaks of the religion and sorcerers of the tribes of the St. Lawrence and those living about the Great Lakes as follows:    We have been all too sadly convinced, that almost all the Salvages in   general have no notion of a God, and that they are not able to   comprehend the most ordinary Arguments on that Subject; others will   have a Spirit that commands, say they, in the Air. Some among ’em look   upon the Skie as a kind of Divinity; others as an _Otkon_ or   _Manitou_, either Good or Evil.    These People admit of some sort of Genius in all things; they all   believe there is a Master of Life, as they call him, but hereof they   make various applications; some of them have a lean Raven, which they   carry always along with them, and which they say is the Master of   their Life; others have an Owl, and some again a Bone, a Sea-Shell,   or some such thing;    There is no Nation among ’em which has not a sort of Juglers or   Conjuerers, which some look upon to be Wizards, but in my Opinion   there is no Great reason to believe ’em such, or to think that their   Practice favours any thing of a Communication with the Devil.    These Impostors cause themselves to be reverenced as Prophets which   fore-tell Futurity. They will needs be look’d upon to have an   unlimited Power. They boast of being able to make it Wet or Dry; to   cause a Calm or a Storm; to render Land Fruitful or Barren; and, in a   Word to make Hunters Fortunate or Unfortunate. They also pretend to   Physick, and to apply Medicines, but which are such, for the most part   as have little Virtue at all in ’em, especially to Cure that Distemper   which they pretend to.    It is impossible to imagine, the horrible Howlings and strange   Contortions that those Jugglers make of their Bodies, when they are   disposing themselves to Conjure, or raise their Enchantments.      [Footnote 4: London, 1689, p. 59, et. seq.]  Marquette, who visited the Miami, Mascontin and Kickapoo Indians in 1673, after referring to the Indian herbalist, mentions also the ceremony of the “calumet dance,” as follows:    They have Physicians amongst them, towards whom they are very liberal   when they are sick, thinking that the Operation of the Remedies they   take, is proportional to the Presents they make unto those who have   prescrib’d them.  In connection with this, reference is made by Marquette to a certain class of individuals among the Illinois and Dakota, who were compelled to wear women’s clothes, and who were debarred many privileges, but were permitted to “assist at all the Superstitions of their _Juglers_, and their solemn Dances in honor of the _Calumet_, in which they may sing, but it is not lawful for them to dance. They are call’d to their Councils, and nothing is determin’d without their Advice; for, because of their extraordinary way of Living, they are look’d upon as _Manitous_, or at least for great and incomparable Genius’s.”  That the calumet was brought into requisition upon all occasions of interest"]]]
