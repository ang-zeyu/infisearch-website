At the smaller dinners and _soirées_ at this season I cannot, of course, receive a full impression of English society, but certainly those persons now in town are charming people.  Their manners are perfectly simple and I entirely forget, except when their historic names fall upon my ear, that I am with the proud aristocracy of England.  All the persons whose names I have mentioned to you give one a decided impression not only of ability and agreeable manners, but of excellence and the domestic virtues.  The furniture and houses, too, are less splendid and ostentatious, than those of our large cities, though [they] have more plate, and liveried servants.  The forms of society and the standard of dress, too, are very like ours, except that a duchess or a countess has more hereditary point lace and diamonds.  The general style of dress, perhaps, is not so tasteful, so simply elegant as ours.  Upon the whole I think more highly of our own country (I mean from a social point of view alone) than before I came abroad.  There is less superiority over us in manners and all the social arts than I could have believed possible in a country where a large and wealthy class have been set apart from time immemorial to create, as it were, a social standard of high refinement. The chief difference that I perceive is this: In our country the position of everybody is undefined and rests altogether upon public opinion.  This leads sometimes to a little assumption and pretension of manner, which the highest class here, whose claims are always allowed by all about them, are never tempted to put on.  From this results an extreme simplicity of manner, like that of a family circle among us.  What I have said, however, applies less to the South than to the large cities of the North, with which I am most familiar at home.  I hope our memory will not be completely effaced in Washington, for we cling to our friends there with strong interest.  Present my respectful regards to the President, and my love to Mrs. Walker and Miss Rucker.  To the Masons also, and our old colleagues all, and pray lay your royal commands upon somebody to write me.  I long to know what is going on in Washington. The Pleasantons promised to do so, and Annie Payne, to whom and to Mrs. Madison give also my best love.  Believe me yours with the highest regard.                                                             E. D. BANCROFT.                                                                 2 December.  Yesterday we dined at the Prussian Minister’s, Chevalier Bunsen’s.  He met your father in Rome twenty years since, and has received us with great enthusiasm.  Yesterday at dinner he actually rose in his seat and made quite a speech welcoming him to England as historian, old friend, etc., and ended by offering his health, which your father replied to shortly, in a few words.  Imagine such an outbreak upon routine at a dinner in England!  Nobody could have done it but one of German blood, but I dare say the Everetts, who know him, could imagine it all.    _To W. D. B. and A. B._                                                   LONDON, December 19, 1846.  MY DEAR SONS: . . . Yesterday we dined at Macready’s and met quite a new, and to us, a most agreeable circle.  There was Carlyle, who talked all dinner-time in his broad Scotch, in the most inimitable way.  He is full of wit, and happened to get upon James I., upon which topic he was superb.  Then there was Babbage, the great mathematician, Fonblanc, the editor of the _Examiner_, etc., etc.  The day before we dined at Mr. Frederick Elliott’s with a small party of eight, of which Lady Morgan was one, and also a brother of Lord Normanby’s, whom I liked very much.  Lady Morgan, who had not hitherto much pleased me, came out in this small circle with all her Irish wit and humor, and gave me quite new notions of her talent.  She made me laugh till I cried.  On Saturday we dined at Sir Roderick Murchison’s, the President of the Geological Society, very great in the scientific way.     [Picture: George Bancroft.  From the painting by C. C. Ingham in the                     possession of William J. A. Bliss]  We have struck up a great friendship with Miss Murray, the Queen’s Maid of Honor, who paid me a visit of three hours to-day, in the midst of which came in Colonel Estcourt, whom I was delighted to see, as you may suppose.  Miss Murray is to me a very interesting person, though a great talker; a convenient fault to a stranger.  She is connected with half the noble families in England, is the grand-daughter of the Duchess of Athol, who governed the Isle of Man as a queen, and the descendant of Scott’s Countess of Derby.  Though sprung of such Tory blood, and a maid of honor, she thinks freely upon all subjects.  Religion, politics, and persons, she decides upon for herself, and has as many benevolent schemes as old Madam Jackson.  I returned the visit of Mr. and Mrs. Leslie, the painter, this week, and saw the picture he is now painting for the Vice-Chancellor.  It is a sketch of children, a boy driving his two little sisters as horses.  One of the little girls is very like Susie, {37} her size, hair, and complexion.  How I longed to be rich enough to order a copy, but his pictures cost a fortune.  I paid also a visit this week to the Duchess of Inverness, whom I found in the prettiest, cosiest morning boudoir looking onto the gardens of the Palace.  In short, I do, or see, every hour, something that if I were a traveller only, I could make quite a story of.    _To W. D. B. and A. B._                                                     LONDON, January 1, 1847.  MY DEAR SONS: . . .  I wrote my last sheet on the 19th and your father went on that day to Cambridge to be present at the tri-centennial celebration of Trinity College . . . He went also the day after the anniversary, which was on our 22nd December, to Ely, with Peacock, the great mathematician, who is Dean of Ely, to see the great cathedral there . . . While he was at Cambridge I passed the evening of the 22nd at Lady Morgan’s, who happened to have a most agreeable set . . . Lady Morgan’s reunions are entertaining to me because they are collections of lions, but they are not strictly and exclusively fashionable.  They remind me in their composition from various circles of Mrs. Otis’s parties in Boston. We have in this respect an advantage over the English themselves, as in our position we see a great variety of cliques.  For instance, last evening, the 31st, I took Louisa, at half-past seven, to the house of Mr. Hawes, an under Secretary of State, to see a beautiful children’s masque.  It was an impersonation of the “Old Year” dressed a little like _Lear_ with snowy hair and draperies.  _Old Year_ played his part inimitably, at times with great pathos, and then introducing witty hits at all the doings of his reign, such as exploding cotton, the new planet, a subject which he put at rest as “_far beyond our reach_,” etc., etc.  He then introduced one by one the children of all ages as “Days” of the coming year.  There was _Twelfth Day_, crowned as Queen with her cake in her hands; there was _Christmas_, covered with holly and mistletoe; there was _April Fool’s Day_, dressed as Harlequin; there was, above all, _Shrove Tuesday_, with her frying-pan of pancakes, dressed as a little cook; there was a charming boy of fourteen or fifteen, as _St. Valentine’s Day_ with his packet of valentines addressed to the young ladies present; there was the _5th of November_, full of wit and fun, etc.; the longest day, an elder brother, of William’s height, with a cap of three or four feet high; and his little sister of five, as the shortest day.  This was all arranged to music and each made little speeches, introducing themselves.  The _Old Year_, after introducing his successors, and after much pathos, is “going, going—gone,” and falls covered with his drapery, upon removing which, instead of the lifeless body of the _Old Year_, is discovered a sweet little flower-crowned girl of five or six, as the _New Year_.  It was charming, and I was so pleased that, instead of taking Louisa away at nine o’clock as I intended, I left her to see “Sir Roger de Coverly,” in the dress of his time.  [Picture: Elizabeth Davis Bancroft.  From the painting by C. C. Ingham in                   the possession of William J. A. Bliss]  Last night at Mr. Putnam’s, I met William and Mary Howitt, and some of the lesser lights.  I have put down my pen to answer a note, just brought in, to dine next Thursday with the Dowager Countess of Charleville, where we were last week, in the evening.  She is eighty-four (tell this to Grandmamma) and likes still to surround herself with _beaux_ and _belles esprits_, and as her son and daughter reside with her, this is still easy . . . The old lady talks French as fast as possible, and troubles me somewhat by talking it to me, forgetting that a foreign minister’s wife can talk English . . . Your father likes to be here.  He has copying going on in the State Paper Office and British Museum, and his heart is full of manuscripts.  It is the first thought, I believe, whoever he sees, what papers are in their family.  He makes great interest with even the ladies sometimes for this purpose.  Upon the whole, I love my own country better than ever, but whether I shall not miss, upon my return, some things to which I am gradually getting accustomed, I have yet to learn.  The gratification of mixing constantly with those foremost in the world for rank, science, literature, or all which adorns society is great, but there is a certain yearning toward those whose habits, education, and modes of thought are the same as our own, which I never can get over.  In the full tide of conversation I often stop and think, “I may unconsciously be jarring the prejudices or preconceived "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1936"],["title","Letters from England, 1846-1849 (#4)"],["body","of these people upon a thousand points; for how differently have I been trained from these women of high rank, and men, too, with whom I am now thrown.”  Upon all topics we are accustomed to think, perhaps, with more latitude, religion, politics, morals, everything.  I like the English extremely, even more than I expected, and yet happy am I to think that our own best portions of society can bear a comparison with theirs.  When I see you I can explain to you the differences, but I think we need not be ashamed of ourselves.    _To I. P. D._                                                     LONDON, January 2, 1847.  MY DEAR UNCLE: . . . I refer you to my letters to my boys, for all the new persons and places we may have seen lately, while I give you for Aunty’s amusement a minute account of my visit into the country at Mr. Bates’s, where things are managed in a scrupulously English manner, so that it will give her the same idea of country life here, as if it were a nobleman’s castle.  Our invitation was to arrive on Thursday, the day before Christmas, to dine, and to remain until the following Tuesday morning.  His place is at East _Sheen_, which receives its name from the Anglo-Saxon word for _beauty_.  It adjoins Richmond Park, beyond which is the celebrated Richmond Hill, Twickenham, Kew, etc., etc. . . . We arrived at East Sheen at half-past five; but I ought first to mention the _preparations_ for a country excursion.  Our own carriage has, of course, no dickey for my maid, or conveniences for luggage, so we take a travelling carriage.  The imperials (which are large, flat boxes, covering the whole top of the carriage, _capital_ for velvet dresses, and smaller ones fitting into all the seats _in_ the carriage, and _before_ and _behind_) are brought to you the day before.  I am merely asked what dresses I wish taken, and that is all I know of the matter, so thoroughly does an English maid understand her business.  We were shown on our arrival into a charming room, semi-library.  In a few minutes a servant came to show me to my apartment, which was very superb, with a comfortable dressing-room and fire for Mr. Bancroft, where the faithful Keats unpacked his dressing materials, while I was in a few moments seated at the toilet to undergo my hair-dressing, surrounded by all my apparatus, and a blazing fire to welcome me with a hissing tea-kettle of hot water and every comfort.  How well the English understand it, I learn more and more every day.  My maid had a large room above me, also with a fire; indeed, a “lady’s” maid is a _very great_ character _indeed_, and would be much more unwilling to take her tea with, or speak familiarly to, a footman or a housemaid than I should.  My greatest mistakes in England have been committed toward those high dignitaries, my own maid and the butler, whose grandeur I entirely misappreciated and invaded, as in my ignorance I placed them, as we do, on the same level with other servants.  She has her fire made for her, and _loaf_ sugar in her tea, which she and Cates sip in solitary majesty. However, she is most conscientious and worthy, as well as dignified, and thoroughly accomplished in her business.  As all these things are pictures of English life, I mention them to amuse Aunty, who likes to know how these matters are managed.  After I am dressed, I join the circle in the library, where I am introduced to Mr. and Madam Van de Weyer, and Louis Buonaparte, the son of Louis, the ex-King of Holland, and of Hortense, Josephine’s daughter. He was a long time imprisoned in the fortress of Ham, and has not long been free.  There was also Napoleon, son of Jerome Buonaparte, and the Princess of Wurtemberg.  They were most agreeable, intelligent, and amiable young men, and I was glad to meet them.  Lord and Lady Langdale (who have a place in the neighborhood) were invited to dine with us.  He is Master of the Rolls and was elevated to the peerage from great distinction at the bar.  Lady Langdale is a sensible and excellent person.  At dinner I sat between Mr. Bates and Lord Langdale, whom I liked very much.  The next morning we assembled at ten for breakfast, which was at a round table, with a sort of circular tray, which turns at the least touch in the centre, leaving only a rim round the table for plates and cups.  This was covered also with a white cloth and on it were placed all the breakfast viands, with butter, sugar, cream, bread, toast-rack and preserves.  You need no servants, but turn it round and help yourself.  I believe the Van de Weyers introduced it, from a visit in Wales.  Tea and coffee are served from a side-table always, here.  Let me tell Aunty that our simple breakfast _dress_ is unknown in England.  You come down in the morning dressed for the day, until six or seven in the evening, when your dress is low neck and short sleeves for dinner.  At this season the morning dress is a rich silk or velvet, high body quite close in the throat with handsome collar and cuffs, and _always_ a cap.  Madam Van de Weyer wore every day a different dress, all very rich, but I adhered to a black watered silk with the same simple cap I wore at home.  I took a drive through Richmond Park (where Henry the Eighth watched to see a signal on the Tower when Anne Boleyn’s head fell, and galloped off to marry Jane Seymour) to Richmond Terrace, which is ravishingly beautiful even at this season. . . . The next day the gentleman all went to town, and Madam Van de Weyer and I passed the day _tête-à-tête_, very pleasantly, as her experience in diplomatic life is very useful to me. . . . Her manners are very pleasing and entirely unaffected.  She has great tact and quickness of perception, great intelligence and amiability and is altogether extremely well-fitted for the _rôle_ she plays in life. Her husband is charming. . . . They have three children, very lovely. The eldest, Victor, a fine boy of seven years old, Victoria, a girl of four, for whom the Queen was sponsor, and Albert, to whom Prince Albert performed the same office.  This was, of course, voluntary in the royal parties, as it was not a favor to be asked. . . .  Madam Van de Weyer is not spoiled, certainly, by the prominent part she was called to play in this great centre of the world at so early an age, and makes an excellent courtier.  I could not help pitying her, however, for looking forward to going through, year after year, the same round of ceremonies, forms, and society.  For us, it is a new study, and invaluable for a short time; but I could not bear it for life, as these European diplomatists.  Besides, we Americans really enjoy a kind of society, and a much nearer intercourse than other foreigners, in the literary, scientific, and even social circles.  On Saturday evening Lord William Fitzroy and daughter joined our party with Sir William Hooker and Lady Hooker. . . . Sir William Hooker is one of the most interesting persons I have seen in England.  He is a great naturalist and has the charge of the great Botanical Gardens at Kew.  He devoted a morning to us there, and it was the most delightful one I have passed.  There are twenty-eight different conservatories filled with the vegetable wonders of the whole world.  Length of time and regal wealth have conspired to make the Kew gardens beyond our conceptions entirely. . . . Sir William pointed out to us all that was very rare or curious, which added much to my pleasure. . . . He showed us a drawing of the largest _flower_ ever known on earth, which Sir Stamford Raffles discovered in Sumatra.  It was a parasite without leaves or stem, and the flower weighed fifteen pounds.  Lady Raffles furnished him the materials for the drawing.  I dined in company with her not long ago, and regret now that I did not make her tell me about the wonders of that region.  At the same dinner you may meet so many people, each having their peculiar gift, that one cannot avail oneself of the opportunity of extracting from each what is precious.  I always wish I could sit by everybody at the same time, and I could often employ a dozen heads, if I had them, instead of my poor, miserable one.  From Sir William Hooker _I_ learned as much about the _vegetable_ world, as Mr. Bancroft did from the Dean of Ely on _architecture_, when he expounded to him the cathedral of Ely; pointing out the successive styles of the Gothic, and the different periods in which the different parts were built.  Books are dull teachers compared with these gifted men giving you a lecture upon subjects before your eyes.  On Sunday we dined with out own party; on Monday some diplomatic people, the Lisboas and one of Mr. Bates’s partners, and on Tuesday we came home. I must not omit a visit while we were there from Mr. Taylor (Van Artevelde), who is son-in-law of Lord Monteagle, and lives in the neighborhood.  He has a fine countenance and still finer voice, and is altogether one of those literary persons who do not disappoint you, but whose whole being is equal to their works.  I hope to see more of him, as they spoke of “_cultivating_” us, and Mr. Taylor was quite a _protégé_ of our kind and dear friend, Dr. Holland, and dedicated his last poem to him.  This expression, “I shall _cultivate_ you,” we hear constantly, and it strikes me as oddly as our Western “_being raised_.”  Indeed, I hear improper Anglicisms constantly, and they have nearly as many as we have. The upper classes, here, however, do _speak_ English so roundly and fully, giving every _letter_ its due, that it pleases my ear amazingly.  On Wednesday I go for the first time to Westminster Abbey, on Epiphany, to hear the Athanasian Creed chanted.  I have as yet had no time for sight-seeing, as the days are so short that necessary visits take all my time.  No one goes out in a carriage till after two, as the servants dine at one, and in the morning early the footman is employed in the house.  A coachman never leaves his box here, and a footman is"]]]
