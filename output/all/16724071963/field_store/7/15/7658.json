After that all returned to their former      places. ‘Brethren,’ said the Levite, ‘our fathers formed a union      which compels all those chosen as representatives of the tribes to      gather every hundred years at the grave of the great teacher of      Caballah whose doctrines give the chosen ones power on earth and      supremacy over all the descendants of Ishmael. Eighteen hundred      years the struggle has been conducted by the nation of Israel for      supremacy which was promised to Abraham and which was taken away      from us by the Cross. Trampled under foot by our enemies, under the      terror of death and all kinds of humiliation and violence, the      nation of Israel, nevertheless, has not abandoned this struggle,      and as they are scattered all over the earth, the whole earth must      belong to them! Our learned men are conducting this struggle for      hundreds of years; the nation is gradually rising from its fall;      its power is growing and spreading. To us belongs the earthly god,      which was made for us with such sorrow by Aaron in the desert ...      the Golden Calf which the backsliders are worshipping!’       “‘We hear!’ they whispered on all sides.       “‘When all the gold on earth will be ours, the power will go over      to us. Then will be fulfilled the promise made to Abraham. Gold is      the ruler of the earth. Gold is power, reward, pleasure ... all      that human beings fear and desire. This is the mystery of the      Caballa ... the teachings concerning the spirit which rules the      world, and about the future! Eighteen centuries we have belonged to      our enemies. The future belongs to us. For the fifth time in the      course of the thousand-year-old struggle to which we have      consecrated ourselves, those who know of the existence of the      secret union have gathered here to take counsel as to the means      which are afforded us by the sins of our enemies, and each time,      for five hundreds years, a new Sanhedrim, ordered the fiercest      struggle. But, excepting Russia, not a single century has been      crowned with such success as this one. Therefore we may think that      the time for which we are striving is near, and we may say, “The      Future is ours!”’       “‘Yes, if persecutions against the Jews will not take place in the      meantime!’ pointed out one of the men with a bitter smile.       “‘The dark days of such a danger are passed. The success of      so-called civilization among the Christian nations may serve as the      best protection for our endeavors. Before listening to the      individual opinions, let us examine the material means, the pure      capital possessed by the nation of Israel....’       “‘But against the three and a half million Jews with their money      there are 265 million enemies in Europe, or rather 500 million      fists,’ remarked one of these present.       “‘The head will protect us against the fists, as in the past. Labor      is the slave of speculation, and violence is the slave of wisdom.      Who will deny that cunning is the distinctive trait of our nation?       “‘Our nation is ostentatious and greedy, arrogant and      pleasure-loving.       “‘Where there is light there is also shadow. It is not in vain that      Adonai our God gave his chosen people the tenacity of a snake, the      cunning of a fox, the look of a falcon, the memory of a dog, the      diligence of an ant, and the sociability of a beaver. We were in      captivity on the rivers of Babylon, and have become powerful! Our      temple was destroyed, but we have built a thousand new temples! For      eighteen hundreds years we were slaves; now we have grown head and      shoulders above all other nations.’       “All the twelve pronounced the concluding words—       “‘Brethren,’ said the Levite, ‘the time has come when, in      accordance with the laws of the founder of our union, we must      determine ways and means by which the Jews shall attain their goal      as soon as possible; our experience of a hundred years will help us      in this. We who know must direct and guide the masses which are      blind. We, the builders, will combine the dead stones into a pillar      which must reach the sky.’       “‘The Tower of Babel was destroyed by the hand of Him whose name I      dare not pronounce,’ said the sceptic.       “‘Our structure rests upon the foundation of the promise made to      Abraham. It is your turn to speak, representative of the tribe of      Reuben! By what means will the Jewish nation achieve power and      supremacy over all other nations on earth?’       “A shrill, unpleasant voice then spoke:       “‘All the princes and the lands of Europe are at present in debt.      The stock exchange regulates these debts. But such things are done      only by movable capital; therefore all the movable capital must go      over to the hands of the Jews. The foundation for this is already      laid, judging from what we have heard here. If we will be supreme      in the stock exchange, we will attain the same supremacy in the      governments. Therefore it is necessary to facilitate loans in order      to get them into our hands all the more. Wherever possible, we must      take in exchange for capital, mortgages on railroads, taxes, mines,      regalia and domains. Furthermore, the stock exchange is a means for      the transfer of the belongings of the small people to the hands of      the capitalists, by drawing them into stock gambling. Transactions      in securities are a splendid invention of our nation. Although the      stock exchange members cheat one another sometimes, it is the      outsider who always pays in the end.’       “The voice which resounded on the Paris Bourse became silent.       “‘Do the _zekenim_ agree with the opinion of our brother?’ asked      the Levite.       “A whisper of approbation was the answer to this question.       “‘Representative of the tribe of Simeon, it is your turn now!’       “A serious, dull voice resounded after this order. Each word was      pronounced slowly and thoughtfully:       “‘Ownership of land is always the iron-clad, everlasting possession      of every country. This in itself gives power, respect and      influence. Therefore, the Jews should secure the possibility of      acquiring real estate. It will not be hard to accomplish this, if      we acquire movable capital. Therefore it is necessary to facilitate      loans on land. Under the fear of scandal we will destroy land      wealth and minimize its importance. Ownership of land should be      mobilized, if lands are sold as other commodities. The more we help      in the breaking up of estates, the more easily will they fall into      our hands. Under the pretext of relieving the poor classes, it is      necessary to levy all taxes of states and communities on the land      owners. When the land is in our hands, the labor of the Christian      workers and farmers will give us a tenfold income.’       “He who did not belong to any tribe laughed sneeringly.       “‘This advice is good, but not new. Ask in Paris and in Vienna, who      owns the houses there?’       “A whisper of approbation was heard again.       “‘Tribe of Judah, your turn!’       “The voice that resounded was marked with conviction and reminded      one of the sound of the Thaller.       “‘Industry, the power of the burgher, which hinders the Jewish      nation, must be paralyzed even as agriculture. The manufacturer      should be no better than an ordinary worker. The means to      accomplish this may be the unlimited freedom of trade. The      manufacturer will take the place of the artisan as he does not have      to work, only to speculate. The children of Israel can adapt      themselves to all branches of work. Their capital and dexterity      will be the substitute for right. Transforming the artisans into      our factory workers, we will be in a position to direct the masses      for our political purposes. Whoever resists this system will be      destroyed by competition. The senseless and ungrateful masses will      not support the artisans in this struggle, if commodities are      reduced in price to a certain extent.       “A noisy approbation of the new Sanhedrin showed that the soundness      of this advice had long been appreciated and even applied in      practice.       “‘Now it is my turn,’ said the representative of Levi—‘I speak in      the name of the tribe of Aaron. The natural enemy of the Jews is      the Christian church. Therefore we must try to humiliate it, we      must instill into it free-thinking, scepticism, and conflicts.      Therefore we will, first of all, start a war on the clergy, we will      try to arouse suspicion against it and ridicule it. The main pillar      of the church is the school. Therefore we must gain influence over      the young. Under the guise of progress and the equal rights of all      religions, we will destroy the study of religion in Christian      schools. Then the Jews may become teachers in all schools; then      religion will be taught at home. And as there is little time left      for that, the spirit of religion will gradually decline, and      eventually it will be destroyed altogether. Agitation for the      appropriation of property belonging to the churches and schools,      the transfer of church property to the state, or (what is the same)      into the hands of the Jews, will be our reward!’       “Again approbation followed the words of the man who had spoken.      Nobody contradicted him and he announced:       “‘Representative of the tribe of Isaachar, it is your turn!’       “Now an old, trembling voice spoke:       “‘Let our brethren strive for the abolition of armed force. The      coarse military art is not for the sons of Israel. Not everyone can      be a Gideon! The army is for the defense of the throne "]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19200"],["title","The History of a Lie: \"The Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion\" (#6)"],["body","the      school of narrow patriotism. Not the sword, but reason and money      must rule. Therefore at every opportune instance, it is necessary      to help the downfall of the military class, to arouse suspicion in      the masses against it, and to incite animosity against one another.      It is enough for the soldiers to do police duty and to protect the      wealthy from those who have nothing.’       “‘The Lion of Judah has spoken,’ said the stranger angrily. ‘David      conquered Goliath. The nations will soon wear long coats instead of      military armour. A slap on the bourse will be equivalent to a lost      battle.’       “It looked as though a storm was rising against this arrogant      sarcasm, but one word from the eldest restored them all to calm.       “‘This is the son of Baal! He may say whatever he pleases. But he      will do whatever is decided by the council of the tribes.’       “‘The tribe of Zebulun may speak!’       “A dull voice, like a storm in the distance, said as follows:       “‘Our nation is conservative to its very root, and clings fast to      what is old. But our interest demands that we participate, or,      rather, direct the movements of nations. It is indisputable that      ours is a time of many reforms, whose main purpose is the      amelioration of the material condition of the needy classes. But      for this the propertied classes must sacrifice their capitals.      Capital is in the hands of the Jews. Therefore they must outwardly      take part in the movement and try to divert it from social and      political reforms. The masses themselves are blind and foolish, and      permit the shouters to rule over them. Who shouts more loudly and      more shrewdly than the Jews? Therefore our nation has been the      first on the platform, in the press, and in all Christian      communities! The more communities and meetings, the more      dissatisfaction and idleness. From this it follows inevitably that      the people grow poorer, that they become subjected to those who      have money, leading to the enrichment of the latter. Besides, every      movement makes us richer, for the smaller people are ruined and are      contracting debts. The unstability of the foundation increases our      power and our influence. Therefore the support of every kind of      dissatisfaction, every revolution, increases our capital and brings      us nearer to our goal.’       “This terrible speech was followed by prolonged silence. Every      member of this secret Sanhedrim seemed to be thinking of its      terrible meaning. The son of Baal again laughed hoarsely.       “‘Are you afraid of blood? It isn’t yours.’       “Then one member of the gathering expressed his approval, and all      others followed his example.       “‘Son of the tribe of Dan, your turn!’       “The answer bore the stamp of a Jew of the lower order:       “‘Every business in which there is speculation and profit must be      in our hands. That is our natural right. First of all, we must get      control of the traffic in liquor, butter, wool, and bread. Then we      shall have in our hands agriculture, farming. We can prepare bread      everywhere, and if dissatisfaction and want should arise, we can      easily throw the blame on the government. Petty wares, which give a      great deal of trouble and yield very little profit, we can leave in      the hands of the Christians. Let them work hard and suffer as the      chosen people suffered for several centuries.’       “This speech scarcely needed approval. The Levite called on the      next one.       “‘Tribe of Naphtali?’       “The following words rang out shrilly and with assurance:       “‘All governmental positions should be open to us. Once this      principle is established, the cunning and flattery of the Jewish      employees will help them to penetrate even there, and they will      have real influence. I am speaking only of the posts which bring      honor, power, and pre-eminence. Positions which require work and      knowledge may remain for the Christians. Therefore the Jews may      neglect positions of secondary importance. Justice is very      important for us, the law is a great step forward. This occupation      is suited to the cunning and skill of our people and gives us      influence and power against our natural enemies. Why can’t a Jew be      Minister of Education as he has already been more than once      Minister of Finance?’       “‘Remember the scaffold of Haman, the fate of Shushan and Leopold!’      said a warning voice.       “‘Why does the raven croak about the past which is so distant and      almost forgotten? More than one of our people has been a Minister      in France and respected by the King himself.’       “Approval was expressed in a tone of satisfied pride; then the      orator continued:       “‘Our people must be among the legislators of the governments. The      laws of the goyim against the children of Israel must be abolished.      We will maintain the laws of our Fathers. We need no longer any      laws that would protect us. No. We must concern ourselves about      laws that will give us privileges. A mild law respecting      bankruptcy, promulgated in the interests of humanity, would be a      golden mountain in our hands. First of all we must see to it that      the law regarding usury is abolished in all countries under the      pretext that money would thereby become cheaper. Money is just such      a commodity as others, and the law should give us the right to      regulate its price according to our desire.’       “‘Now is the turn for the tribe of Benjamin.’       “‘What can I add to the counsel of such wise men? The Jew should      also make use of honors, and should be at the head of all      organizations that may give him honor without risks, and he should      engage in science and the arts which are more adapted to the      character of our people and which we can master more easily. We can      become good actors and philosophers, because there is room for      speculation in these domains. In the arts our people will look      after the reception and will burn incense to ourselves. In science      we will take up medicine and philosophy. These afford opportunities      for theories and speculation. A physician penetrates the secrets of      families and holds their lives in his hands.’       “‘Tribe of Asher, your turn!’       “‘We must demand free marriage between Jews and Christians. Israel      will only be the gainer, even though there be an admixture of      impure blood to a certain degree. Our sons and daughters will marry      into renowned and powerful Christian families. We give money and      thus have influence. The Christian relationship cannot have a bad      influence on us, while we can exert a strong influence over them.      That is one thing. Another thing is that we respect the Jewish      woman and we enjoy the forbidden pleasure with the women of our      enemies. We have money, and for money we can get everything. A Jew      must never make a daughter of his own race his mistress. If he      should desire to sin against the Seventh Commandment he should      content himself with Christian girls.’       “‘What is the use of employing the beautiful girls of the goyim in      our stores if not for this?’ angrily interposed the representative      of the evil spirit. ‘Whoever will not want to satisfy our desire      will get no work, consequently no bread. Go to the large cities and      you will see that they are not waiting for your wise men’s orders.      Substitute a contract for sacrament in the marriage of Christians      and their wives and daughters will come to you still more readily.’       “The terrible cynicism of these words, touching such a delicate      subject, must have produced a profound impression, especially since      the views of the ancient doctrines were so strict on the topic of      moral purity.       “‘What does the law say?’ asked one of the twelve.       “‘For adultery with a woman of our own people—death; for seducing a      girl—a fine, if she was not betrothed; if she was betrothed—death.      But the law is not so rigorous with regard to one who lives with a      slave—her body belongs to her master.’       “‘Are the goyim better than our slaves?’       “This explanation was followed by a whisper of approval.       “‘The tribe of Manasseh may speak now!’       “The last of the orators lifted his hand and during his speech he      raised and lowered it, as if desiring thus to make a stronger      impression by his words. His voice was hoarse and unpleasant, but      he spoke skilfully and with assurance.       “‘If gold is the first power in the world, the press is the second.      Of what value are all the opinions and advice given here without      the aid of the press? We will attain our aim only when the press is      in our hands. Our people must direct the daily publications. We are      cunning, shrewd, and we possess money which we know how to utilize      for our purposes. We need great political newspapers which mold      public opinion—criticism, the literature of the streets and the      stage. In this way we will crowd out the Christians step by step,      and will dictate to the world what it should believe in, what it      should respect, and what it should curse. We will repeat the      sorrowful cry of Israel and the complaints against the persecutions      which are directed against us. Then, even though each individual      may be against us, the masses, in their stupidity, will always be      for us. With the press in our hands, we can turn wrong into right,      dishonesty into honesty. We can shake all foundations, and separate      families. We can destroy faith in all that our enemies, until now,      have believed. We can ruin credits and arouse passions. We can      declare war; we can award fame or disgrace. We "]]]
