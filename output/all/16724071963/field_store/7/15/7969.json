I'm not ready to agree that he ought to be permitted to pitch, for I hate the very sight of him; but I have put that by, and will catch for you. It will be catching for you, you see, Merry, and not for him. I ought to have looked at it that way before, but I could not.\"  \"I have got Jack Ready for catcher!\"  Bart gasped, while his dark face seemed to get redder and hotter.  \"Why, he can't catch!\"  \"Much better than you think. He is a pretty fair catcher.\"  \"And if he falls down?\"  \"I'll put some one else in. I have two or three in mind, and have spoken to two of them.\"  Hodge seemed stunned.  \"I'm willing to catch!\" he said.  \"You may, Bart, if I see that Ready can't do the work. If the game seems about to be lost I'll go into the pitcher's box and you behind the bat, and we'll pull the nine out of the hole! Eh?\"  Hodge's eyes brightened strangely.  \"We can do it, Merry! I'll be as steady as a clock. Only I'm sorry things went the way they did and that I showed how mean I can be. I only proved what my enemies say of me. It's too late now, but I'm ready to do what I can to make it right.\"  Merriwell came over and put a hand on Bart's shoulder.  \"I understand you, Bart, and few do. I know that your friendship for me is true blue, and that your heart is where it should be, even if your head runs away with you. Now we'll get to bed. To-morrow we play ball, and I want to be in condition.\"  But Bart Hodge was not in condition to play ball, nor in condition for anything the next day. When morning came he had a high fever, and the doctor whom Merriwell summoned looked grave.  \"He has lost sleep and been exposing himself and caught cold,\" he said. \"It looks like a case of pneumonia. Better send him to the hospital.\"  \"Will he be better off at the hospital than here, if there is some one here to take care of him?\"  \"No, I don't know that he will. And I was going to say that it is really too bad to move him in his condition.\"  \"Then he will stay right here. I'll get the best nurse to be had, and look after him all I can myself!\"  And Hodge, under the best of care, remained in his room, while Merriwell's nine, with Jack Ready as catcher and Badger as pitcher, went out to meet the team from Hartford that forenoon.  A big crowd of rooters had come over from Hartford to whoop things up for Abernathy's men. They were enthusiastic fellows, and they made a great deal of noise. Some of them were betting men, and they flourished their money with as much confidence as if the game were already won and they were certain of raking in their winnings.  But Yale had turned out a big crowd, too, for Merriwell was immensely popular, and, of course, the Yale and New Haven crowd would naturally be the larger on the home grounds.  \"We'll have a warm time this forenoon!\" Frank observed to Jack Ready.  \"Torrid as the equator!\" Ready answered.  \"How is your nerve, old man?\"  Ready dropped a finger to his pulse and seemed to be counting.  \"Steady as a clock, Merry!\"  \"Keep it that way. There is Badger coming over for a talk with you. We'll begin as soon as we get a little warming up.\"  He looked at his watch and began to talk with Browning, while Ready and Badger drew aside to confer. Merriwell could see that Badger was a bit nervous when the game was called. There was a flush in his face and a glitter in his eyes that told of excitement, but this seemed to disappear as he took the clean new Spalding ball in his hands and entered the box.  In the grand stand Frank saw Inza, Elsie, and Winnie, and he lifted his hat to them again, though he had enjoyed a long talk with them not many minutes before. Winnie was smilingly happy. She waved her handkerchief to Badger, and the Kansan's white teeth showed in a grim smile of determination.  \"If only you and Bodge were the hattery--I mean if only you and Hodge were the battery!\" Rattleton groaned in Frank's ear.  \"Don't worry, Rattles! Just do your duty on third!\" Merry answered. \"We are all right!\"  Thus encouraged, Harry went away happy and confident. Browning was on first, with Diamond on second. Danny Griswold was short-stop; while Dismal had the right field, Bink Stubbs center, and Joe Gamp the left. The game opened with Merriwell's men in the field.  The Westerner surveyed the ground and his surroundings carefully. Then planted his toe on the rubber plate and shot in a \"twister.\" It curved inward as it neared the batter, and cut the heart of the plate. The batter had been fooled and did not swing at it.  \"One strike!\" called the umpire.  The batter, who was looking out for an out curve next, swung at it, and fanned the air. The Yale men, and especially the sophomores, began to shout.  Badger thought it time to change to an out curve, and sent one in hot as a Mauser bullet. But the batter was looking for out curves. He reached for it. Crack!--away it sailed into the right field.  \"Go, long legs!\" was screamed at Dismal Jones, who sprinted for it with all his might.  The next man of the Hartfords at the bat was the pitcher, Pink Wilson, a fellow almost as tall and lank as Dismal Jones, with a hatchet face and a corkscrew nose. His admirers said he got that twisted nose from watching his own curves in delivering. He came up confident, thinking he understood the tricks of the Kansan pretty well, and that he would be easy. But almost before he knew it the umpire called \"one strike.\"  \"That ball must have passed this side of the plate,\" he declared. \"It was an in, and I had to jump to get out of the way.\"  \"Don't jump at shadows!\" shouted a Yale sophomore. \"That ball was all right.\"  The umpire promptly informed Wilson that he was talking too much with his mouth.  \"I'll get him the next time!\" thought the lank pitcher of the Hartfords. \"He fooled me that time, but he can't do it again!\"  But Badger did it again. Again the sophomores began to yell. Jack Ready tossed the ball back.  Badger began to look and to feel confident, a thing that Merriwell, who was closely watching him, did not like. This time the Westerner, after almost bending himself double, gave his arm an eccentric movement and shot in another curve. Wilson struck at it desperately, and fanned out.  \"He can't keep it up!\" yelled a Hartford man, who had been wildly hunting for bets a short time before, and who felt the need of whistling to keep his courage up.  Barrows, the center-fielder, came to the bat next. He went after the very first one, and got it Crack! and away the ball flew again into the right field, while the Hartford lads opened up with great vigor.  It was a hit, for everybody saw that Dismal, even though he was doing his best, could not possibly get it. Barrows raced to first, while Tillinghast, the base-runner, took second, without trouble, but stumbled and fell, so that it was impossible for him to make another bag on the hit.  Badger next tried his highest speed, and the batter fanned, but Ready dropped and fumbled the ball, being unable to hold it, and came very near letting both runners advance, although he did get the sphere down to third in time to drive them back.  Watching closely, Frank had discovered that something about Badger's delivery bothered Ready. Badger himself saw this, and he tried a change of pace, but the batter caught it on the handle of his \"wagon-tongue,\" and drove out a \"scratch hit\" that filled the bases.  Oleson, a Swede, almost as large as Browning, came up to the plate.  \"And there were giants in those days,\" droned Jones, from his position in the field.  \"How's that for the giant?\" cried Oleson, as he slashed yet another down into Dismal's territory, bringing in the first score and causing the Hartford rooters to \"open up.\"  Jones made a beautiful throw home, which sent Barrows scrambling back to third, which he reached barely in time to save himself, for Ready had lined it down to that bag in short order.  Frank was beginning to wonder if all the Hartford men were right-field hitters, or was there something in Badger's pitching that caused them to put the balls into that field? Unable to keep still, he walked down toward first, and Browning found an opportunity to say:  \"We ought to have Hodge behind the bat. Badger can't use his speed, for Ready can't hold him. Are you going to let those fellows lose this game in the first inning, Merriwell? If you do, I'll kick myself for a week for being chump enough to get out here and swear for nothing.\"  \"It's a handicap not to have Hodge,\" admitted Frank.  Browning felt like saying it was a handicap not to have Frank in the box, but, fancying he had said enough in that line, he kept still. Badger's face took on a hard look. He motioned for Ready to come down and advanced to meet him. A few words passed between them, while the Hartford \"fans\" guyed them.  This little talk seemed to bear good fruit, for the Westerner fooled the next batter with two drops, getting two strikes called. Then he tried \"coaxers\" till three balls were called on him, and again, with every runner taking all the \"lead\" he dared, the excitement was at a high pitch.  Frank feared for the result.  \"Oh, for Hodge!\" he thought. \"I see now that our handicap means disaster unless the wind changes.\" Ready was crouching under the bat, nervous, but determined. Badger took his time, but put terrible speed into the next ball, which he sent over the inner corner of the plate. The batter struck at it, but missed clean.  Plunk! the ball struck in Ready's hand. Thud! it dropped to the ground. But the bases were filled, and the batter was out, for all that Jack had not held the ball. He recovered it so that there was no possibility for the man on third to get home.  Now two men were out, but the bags were filled, and a long, safe hit meant more scores for the visitors. Fleetwood, the Hartford third-baseman, took his turn at the stick. He was a good waiter, and he found just what he wanted, sending it safe over the short-stop, so that two more scores came in."]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19402"],["title","Frank Merriwell's Reward (#7)"],["body"," was pale round the mouth when the next hitter stepped up to the plate. He did not spare Ready. Jack missed the first two balls, being unable to hold them, although he did not let them get past him. Both were strikes, and again Badger tried to \"work\" the batter, though he did not slacken his speed. Frank was anxious, for he expected to see the freshman catcher let one of those hot ones pass him. Nothing of the kind happened, and, after trying two balls, Buck used a sharp rise and struck the man out.  The college men on the bleachers rose up and howled, but Frank Merriwell was gloomy at heart, though his lips smiled.  \"Badger is doing well,\" he told himself; \"but Ready cannot hold him. I'm afraid the handicap is too great. Oh, for Bart Hodge just now!\"  The first half of the first inning was over, but Hartford had made three runs.     CHAPTER VI.  READY STEADY.   Merriwell saw that Ready could not catch for Buck Badger. There was such an utter absence of anything like team-work that there seemed to be little hope that the game could be won by Merriwell's nine if the battery was not changed. Badger could pitch like a wonder at times, but he rattled Ready, who, as a rule, and in regard to other matters, was as steady as a clock. Ready simply could not do himself justice with Badger in the box. He felt it as well as Merriwell, but he doggedly continued, determined at all events to do his best. Ready was a fellow of infinite pluck, and usually a fellow of infinite confidence. He would have had confidence now, but there was not a thing to build his confidence on.  Merriwell's nine scored four times before it was forced again into the field. Frank sent Badger into the box again, after talking with him awhile.  \"You rattle Ready, some way!\" Frank told him. \"Throw those in curves more, and work in your dropped balls when you can. They get your out curves.\"  Then, before playing again, he had a few words with Ready.  The first man at the bat got a hit, while the next man took first on balls. The next man at the bat knocked a fly into the hands of Danny Griswold, who was playing short-stop, and the base-runners came back to their places.  Then the men on bases tried to make a double steal, which was partially successful. The fellow on second reached third, but the runner behind him was cut off at second by a throw from Ready. Jack should have thrown to third, but he did not. He threw low to second, and Diamond got it on the bound, touching the runner as that individual was making a desperate slide.  Two men were out, and Frank hoped that Badger would keep the visitors from scoring. Buck might have done so, but somehow he \"crossed signals\" with Jack, the result being a passed ball that let in a score.  \"I'm hot stuff,\" chirped Ready, as he found Frank back at the bench of the home team. \"When I don't fail, I succeed.\"  \"I see you do,\" answered Frank dryly. \"You succeeded in letting in that run.\"  \"Our wires got crossed. Badge gave me an in when I was looking for an out. If you'll put in a pitcher who can throw a curve, I'll surprise you.\"  \"Does Badger rattle you?\"  \"Refuse me! I think I rattle him.\"  There was no time for further talk, and the game went on. Buck was nervous, and Frank pitied him, for he could see that the Westerner might do well with a good catcher behind the bat. Just then Merry did not know of a man to put in Ready's place, for he could see that the Westerner's great speed and queer delivery might be too much for any green catcher who was not used to him.  \"Yes,\" muttered Frank, \"the loss of Hodge is the handicap that will cause us to lose the game--if we lose it.\"  The next man got first on balls, and then the following batter lifted a high foul. Ready got under it, and the Hartfords were retired at last.  \"We're done up, Merry,\" said Rattleton, as the men came in.  \"Not yet, old man,\" declared Frank cheerfully. \"I think I'll go behind the bat myself next inning.\"  \"Don't do it!\" exclaimed Harry. \"I know you can play any old position, Merry, but your place is in the box. With you there, every man on the team will play like a streak. Won't you go in?\"  \"Badger----\"  \"Can see that he is bound to lose the game if this keeps on. He's got sense. He won't want to make such a bad record for himself.\"  \"Ready will not be able to judge the double-shoot. I can't use that.\"  \"You won't have to. You can win this game without it.\"  \"I don't know.\"  \"I do! Try it.\"  Frank was in doubt, and he permitted Badger to pitch one more inning. The Westerner worked hard, but it was plain he had lost confidence, and he was not at his best. Great beads of perspiration stood out on his face. Two men scored, despite him, and the visitors had the lead again.  \"I believe I'll try it in the box,\" Frank mentally decided. \"Perhaps I may hold Ready steady. It looks like the only show to win out.\"  When Merriwell finally went into the box, seeing that it must be done, Badger retired with as good grace as he could, though his dark face was flushed.  \"There would be no trouble if it wasn't for Jack Ready!\" he asserted. \"I can pitch all right, but the pitcher isn't the whole battery!\"  \"Your delivery bothers him,\" Merriwell explained. \"I believe that you two together are capable of good work, but it will take a lot more practise, and just now we haven't time for practise. You can pitch, Badger, and your best is excellent; but you are irregular. But you'll come round all right. I was talking with Dunstan Kirk about you awhile ago, and he agrees with me. He has been closely watching you all through the game.\"  \"I know it,\" Badger growled. \"I've known it only too well! It has helped to make my pitching wild at times. If he had stayed away, I think I could have done all right all the time. But you'll find that Ready will worry you. He'd worry anybody. The fellow simply can't catch.\"  \"But he can!\" Merriwell insisted. \"We'll win this game yet!\"  The change that came over Jack Ready's work shortly after Merriwell went into the pitcher's box was little short of marvelous. Frank seemed to know how to favor Ready's weak points. And this kept Ready's head steady for other work, so that he made not another wild throw to bases.  Merriwell's nine began to feel their courage rise. It put life into them just to see Frank in the box. Stolen bases on the part of the Hartfords stopped. The swiftness with which Merriwell struck out three batters made the spectators gasp.  From that on Ready was steady, and he and Frank worked together like a battery team of long experience. Frank Merriwell won, in spite of his handicap! And so the Yale rooters, and especially Merriwell's friends and admirers, who were a host in themselves, were roaring wild as they returned from the ball-ground. Merriwell joined Inza and Elsie, while Badger took a car with Winnie.  \"I knew that everything was all right, as soon as you went into the box!\" Inza declared. \"But up to that minute I was nervous. I was wanting to shake you all the time for not taking Badger's place sooner.\"  \"I felt sorry for Badger,\" said Elsie. \"And I felt sorry for Winnie. She got as red as a beet when Badger left the box, but I know she didn't blame you, Frank. She saw just how it was, and she knew you ought to have gone in sooner, but of course she felt it.\"  \"I was afraid Ready might begin to doubt his own abilities--though probably there is not any danger that he will ever do that! He was just what I expected of him, though, when I pitched. And if Badger and Bart were friends and could, or would, work together, they would make a good battery.\"  \"You will have to coach Badger some,\" Inza suggested.  \"Yes. The captain of the ball-team wants me to. He thinks there is good stuff in both of them, if it can only be properly developed.\"  The three got out at a transfer station, and waited for another car.  \"Dere she comes!\" yelled an excited youngster.  The \"she\" he referred to was not the expected car, but the head of a circus procession, which was parading the principal streets as an advertisement of the performances to be given in the big tents in the suburbs that afternoon and night.  Merriwell and the girls looked in the direction indicated. The crowd at the corner seemed to become thicker. People began to swarm out of the doorways and stream out into the middle of the street.  \"And this is scholarly New Haven!\" exclaimed Inza. \"Wild over a circus parade!\"  \"We're not in the scholarly part of New Haven!\" laughed Frank. \"I confess that I like to see a circus parade myself!\"  Inza showed evidences that she liked the same thing, for she craned her handsome neck and stood on tiptoe to catch the first glimpse. The nodding plumes on the heads of the horses drawing the gilded band-wagon came into view, and at the same moment the band began to crash forth its resonant music. Children danced and capered, heads were popped out of second-story windows, and the pushing crowd grew denser.  The band-wagon came slowly down the street in the bright spring sunshine, followed by the performers, mounted on well-groomed horses, some of which were beautifully mottled. There were other horses, many of them--a few drawing chariots, driven by Amazons. Then came the funny clown, in his little cart, with his jokes and grimaces for the children.  There was another band-wagon, as gorgeous as the first, at the head of the procession of wild-beast cages. Its music was more deafening than that of the other. The street-cars seemed to have stopped running, owing to the packed crowds, and Frank and his girl friends remained on the corner curiously watching the scene.  Suddenly a fractious horse jerked away from the man who had been standing at its head holding it, and whirling short about, half-overturned the wagon to which it was hitched and raced wildly down the street. People scattered in every direction, several being knocked down in the stampeding rush.  The horse climbed to the sidewalk, with wheels bumping the curbing, trying to get"]]]
