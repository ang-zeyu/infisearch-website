Fresnoy’s face meanwhile wore the amused smile of one who comprehended my motives, but felt sufficiently sure of his position and influence with his followers to be indifferent to my proceedings. I presently showed him, however, that I had not yet done with him. Our table was laid in obedience to my orders at such a distance from the men that they could not overhear our talk, and by-and-by I leant over to him.  ‘M. Fresnoy,’ I said, ‘you are in danger of forgetting one thing, I fancy, which it behoves you to remember.’  ‘What?’ he muttered, scarcely deigning to look up at me.  ‘That you have to do with Gaston de Marsac,’ I answered quietly. ‘I am making, as I told you this morning, a last attempt to recruit my fortunes, and I will let no man--no man, do you understand, M. Fresnoy?--thwart me and go harmless.’  ‘Who wishes to thwart you?’ he asked impudently.  ‘You,’ I answered unmoved, helping myself, as I spoke, from the roll of black bread which lay beside me. ‘You robbed me this afternoon; I passed it over. You encouraged those men to be insolent; I passed it over. But let me tell you this. If you fail me to-night, on the honour of a gentleman, M. Fresnoy, I will run you through as I would spit a lark.’  ‘Will you? But two can play at that game,’ he cried, rising nimbly from his stool. ‘Still better six! Don’t you think, M. de Marsac, you had better have waited--?’  ‘I think you had better hear one word more,’ I answered coolly, keeping my seat, ‘before you appeal to your fellows there.’  ‘Well,’ he said, still standing, ‘what is it?’  ‘Nay,’ I replied, after once more pointing to his stool in vain, ‘if you prefer to take my orders standing, well and good.’  ‘Your orders?’ he shrieked, growing suddenly excited.  ‘Yes, my orders!’ I retorted, rising as suddenly to my feet and hitching forward my sword. ‘My orders, sir,’ I repeated fiercely, ‘or, if you dispute my right to command as well as to pay this party, let us decide the question here and now--you and I, foot to foot, M. Fresnoy.’  The quarrel flashed up so suddenly, though I had been preparing it all along, that no one moved. The woman indeed, fell back to her children, but the rest looked on open-mouthed. Had they stirred, or had a moment’s hurly-burly heated his blood, I doubt not Fresnoy would have taken up my challenge, for he did not lack hardihood. But as it was, face to face with me in the silence, his courage failed him. He paused, glowering at me uncertainly, and did not speak.  ‘Well,’ I said, ‘don’t you think that if I pay I ought to give orders, sir?’  ‘Who wishes to oppose your orders?’ he muttered, drinking off a bumper, and sitting down with an air of impudent bravado, assumed to hide his discomfiture.  ‘If you don’t, no one else does,’ I answered. So that is settled. Landlord, some more wine.’  He was very sulky with me for a while, fingering his glass in silence and scowling at the table. He had enough gentility to feel the humiliation to which he had exposed himself, and a sufficiency of wit to understand that that moment’s hesitation had cost him the allegiance of his fellow-ruffians. I hastened, therefore, to set him at his ease by explaining my plans for the night, and presently succeeded beyond my hopes; for when he heard who the lady was whom I proposed to carry off, and that she was lying that evening at the Chateau de Chize, his surprise swept away the last trace of resentment. He stared at me, as at a maniac.  ‘Mon Dieu!’ he exclaimed. ‘Do you know what you are doing, Sieur?’  ‘I think so,’ I answered.  ‘Do you know to whom the chateau belongs?’  ‘To the Vicomte de Turenne.’  ‘And that Mademoiselle de la Vire is his relation?’  ‘Yes,’ I said.  ‘Mon Dieu!’ he exclaimed again. And he looked at me open-mouthed.  ‘What is the matter?’ I asked, though I had an uneasy consciousness that I knew--that I knew very well.  ‘Man, he will crush you as I crush this hat!’ he answered in great excitement. ‘As easily. Who do you think will protect you from him in a private quarrel of this kind? Navarre? France? our good man? Not one of them. You had better steal the king’s crown jewels--he is weak; or Guise’s last plot--he is generous at times, or Navarre’s last sweetheart--he is as easy as an old shoe. You had better have to do with all these together, I tell you, than touch Turenne’s ewe-lambs, unless your aim be to be broken on the wheel! Mon Dieu, yes!’  ‘I am much obliged to you for your advice,’ I said stiffly, ‘but the die is cast. My mind is made up. On the other hand, if you are afraid, M. Fresnoy--’  ‘I am afraid; very much afraid,’ he answered frankly.  ‘Still your name need not be brought into the matter,’ I replied, ‘I will take the responsibility. I will let them know my name here at the inn, where, doubtless, inquiries will be made.’  ‘To be sure, that is something,’ he answered thoughtfully. ‘Well, it is an ugly business, but I am in for it. You want me to go with you a little after two, do you? and the others to be in the saddle at three? Is that it?’  I assented, pleased to find him so far acquiescent; and in this way, talking the details over more than once, we settled our course, arranging to fly by way of Poitiers and Tours. Of course I did not tell him why I selected Blois as our refuge, nor what was my purpose there; though he pressed me more than once on the point, and grew thoughtful and somewhat gloomy when I continually evaded it. A little after eight we retired to the loft to sleep; our men remaining below round the fire and snoring so merrily as almost to shake the crazy old building. The host was charged to sit up and call us as soon as the moon rose, but, as it turned out, I might as well have taken this office on myself, for between excitement and distrust I slept little, and was wide awake when I heard his step on the ladder and knew it was time to rise.  I was up in a moment, and Fresnoy was little behind me; so that, losing no time in talk, we were mounted and on the road, each with a spare horse at his knee, before the moon was well above the trees. Once in the Chase we found it necessary to proceed on foot, but, the distance being short, we presently emerged without misadventure and stood opposite to the chateau, the upper part of which shone cold and white in the moon’s rays.  There was something so solemn in the aspect of the place, the night being fine and the sky without a cloud, that I stood for a minute awed and impressed, the sense of the responsibility I was here to accept strong upon me. In that short space of time all the dangers before me, as well the common risks of the road as the vengeance of Turenne and the turbulence of my own men, presented themselves to my mind, and made a last appeal to me to turn back from an enterprise so foolhardy. The blood in a man’s veins runs low and slow at that hour, and mine was chilled by lack of sleep and the wintry air. It needed the remembrance of my solitary condition, of my past spent in straits and failure, of the grey hairs which swept my cheek, of the sword which I had long used honourably, if with little profit to myself; it needed the thought of all these things to restore me to courage and myself.  I judged at a later period that my companion was affected in somewhat the same way; for, as I stooped to press home the pegs which I had brought to tether the horses, he laid his hand on my arm. Glancing up to see what he wanted, I was struck by the wild look in his face (which the moonlight invested with a peculiar mottled pallor), and particularly in his eyes, which glittered like a madman’s. He tried to speak, but seemed to find a difficulty in doing so; and I had to question him roughly before he found his tongue. When he did speak, it was only to implore me in an odd, excited manner to give up the expedition and return.  ‘What, now?’ I said, surprised. ‘Now we are here, Fresnoy?’  ‘Ay, give it up!’ he cried, shaking me almost fiercely by the arm. ‘Give it up, man! It will end badly, I tell you! In God’s name, give it up, and go home before worse comes of it.’  ‘Whatever comes of it,’ I answered coldly, shaking his grasp from my arm, and wondering much at this sudden fit of cowardice, ‘I go on. You, M. Fresnoy, may do as you please!’  He started and drew back from me; but he did not reply, nor did he speak again. When I presently went off to fetch a ladder, of the position of which I had made a note during the afternoon, he accompanied me, and followed me back in the same dull silence to the walk below the balcony. I had looked more than once and eagerly at mademoiselle’s window without any light or movement in that quarter rewarding my vigilance; but, undeterred by this, which might mean either that my plot was known, or that Mademoiselle de la Vire distrusted me, I set the ladder softly against the balcony, which was in deep shadow, and paused only to give Fresnoy his last instructions. These were simply to stand on guard at the foot of the ladder and defend it in case of surprise; so that, whatever happened inside the chateau, my retreat by the window might not be cut off.  Then I went cautiously up the ladder, and, with my sheathed sword in my left hand, stepped over the balustrade. Taking one pace forward, with fingers outstretched, I felt the leaded panes of the window and tapped softly.  As softly the casement gave way, and I followed it. A hand which I could see but not feel was laid on mine. All was darkness in the room, and before me, but the hand guided me two paces forward, then by a sudden pressure bade me stand. I heard the sound of a curtain being drawn behind me, and the next moment the cover of a"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19393"],["title","Plays of Near & Far (#0)"],["body","Team      Plays of Near & Far  _By_  LORD DUNSANY   G.

A successful production also has been sometimes a moral support to me when some critic has said, as for instance of \"A Night at an Inn,\" that though it reads passably it could never act.  But in this book I have made an exception to this good rule (as it seems to me), and that exception is \"The Flight of the Queen.\" I know too little of managers and theatres to know what to do with it, and have a feeling that it will be long before it is ever acted, and am too fond of this play to leave it in obscurity. This beautiful story has been lying about the world for countless centuries, without ever having been dramatized. It is the story of a royal court, which I have merely adapted to the stage. The date that I have given is accurate; it happened in June; and happens every June; perhaps in some corner of the reader's garden. It is the story of the bees.  As for \"The Compromise of the King of the Golden Isles,\" it is just the sort of play through which those that hunt for allegories might hunt merrily, unless I mention that there are no allegories in any of my plays.  An allegory I take to be a dig at something local and limited, such as politics, while outwardly appearing to tell of things on some higher plane. But, far from being the _chef d'œuvre_ of some ponderously profound thinker, I look on the allegory, if I have rightly defined it, as being the one form of art that is narrowly limited in its application to life. When the man whose cause it championed has been elected alderman, when the esplanade has been widened, or the town better lighted or drained, the allegory's work must necessarily be over; but the truth of all other works of art is manifold and should be eternal.  Though there is no such land as the Golden Isles and was never any such king as Hamaran, yet all that we write with sincerity is true, for we can reflect nothing that we have not seen, and this we interpret with our idiosyncracies when we attempt any form of art.  I set some store by the way in which the three lines about Zarabardes are recited, though it is hard to explain in writing a matter of rhythm. But the heartlessness of it can be indicated by a clear pronunciation of the syllables, as though the people that utter these words had long been drilled in a formula.  The third play, \"Cheezo,\" tells of one of those rare occasions when it is permissible for an artist, and may be a duty, to leave his wider art in order to attack a definite evil. And the invention of \"great new foods\" is often a huge evil.  \"Cheezo\" is a play of Right and Wrong, and Wrong triumphs. Were not this particular Wrong triumphing at this particular date I should not have thought it a duty to attack it, and were it easily defeated it would not have been worth attacking.  I have seen it acted with a Stage Curate, rather weak and a little comic; obviously such a man could be no match for Sladder. Hippanthigh should be of stronger stuff than that: he is defeated because that particular evil is, as I have said, defeating its enemies at present. Nor could there be any drama in a contest between the brutal Sladder and a Stage Curate; for the spark that we call humour, by whose light we see much of life, comes as it were of two flints, and not of a flint and cheese.  The three little plays that follow I will leave to speak for themselves, as ultimately all plays have to do.

THE KING'S POLITICIAN: A man has fled from the Emperor, and has taken refuge in your Majesty's Court in that part of it called holy.  THE KING: We must give him up to the Emperor.  POLITICIAN: To-day a spearsman came running from Eng-Bathai seeking the man who fled. He carries the barbed spear of one of the Emperor's seekers.  KING: We must give him up.  POLITICIAN: Moreover he has an edict from the Emperor demanding that the head of the man who fled be sent back to Eng-Bathai.  KING: Let it be sent.  POLITICIAN: Yet your Majesty is no vassal of the Emperor, who dwells at Eng-Bathai.  KING: We may not disobey the Imperial edict.  POLITICIAN: Yet----  KING: None hath dared to do it.  POLITICIAN: It is so long since any dared to do it that the Emperor mocks at kings. If your Majesty disobeyed him the Emperor would tremble.  KING: Ah.  POLITICIAN: The Emperor would say, \"There is a great king. He defies me.\" And he would tremble strangely.  KING: Yet--if----  POLITICIAN: The Emperor would fear you.  KING: I would fain be a great king--yet----  POLITICIAN: You would win honour in his eyes.  KING: Yet is the Emperor terrible in his wrath. He was terrible in his wrath in the olden time.  POLITICIAN: The Emperor is old.  KING: This is a great affront that he places upon a king, to demand a man who has come to sanctuary in that part of my Court called holy.  POLITICIAN: It is a great affront.  [_Enter the_ SEEKER. _He abases himself._  SEEKER: O King, I have come with my spear, seeking for one that fled the Emperor and has found sanctuary in your Court in that part called holy.  KING: It has not been the wont of the kings of my line to turn men from our sanctuary.  SEEKER: It is the Emperor's will.  KING: It is not _my_ will.  SEEKER: Behold the Emperor's edict.  [_The_ KING _takes it. The_ SEEKER _goes towards the door._  SEEKER: I go to sit with my spear by the door of the place called holy.  [_Exit_ SEEKER.  KING: The edict, the edict. We must obey the edict.  POLITICIAN: The Emperor is old.  KING: True, we will defy him.  POLITICIAN: He will do nothing.  KING: And yet the edict.  POLITICIAN: It is of no importance.  KING: Hark. I will not disobey the Emperor. Yet will I not permit him to abuse the sanctuary of my Court. We will banish the man who fled from Eng-Bathai. [_To his_ DOOM-BEARER.] Hither, the Doom-Bearer; take the black ivory spear, the wand of banishment, that lies on the left of my throne, and point it at the man that shelters in the holy place of my Court. Then show him the privy door behind the horns of the altar, so that he go safely hence and meet not the Emperor's seeker.  [_The_ DOOM-BEARER _bows and takes the spear on the flat of both his hands. The shaft is all black, but the head is of white ivory. It is blunt and clearly ceremonial. Exit._]  [_To_ POLITICIAN.  Thus we shall be safe from the wrath of the Emperor, and the holy place of my Court will not be violate.  POLITICIAN: Had your Majesty scorned the Emperor it were better. He is old and durst not take vengeance.  KING: I have decided, and the man is banished.  [_A_ HERALD _marches in and blows his trumpet._  HERALD: The Ambassador of the Emperor.  [_Enter the_ AMBASSADOR. _He bows to the King from his place near the door._  KING: For what purpose to my Court from Eng-Bathai comes thus the Ambassador of the Emperor?  AMBASSADOR: I bring to the King's Majesty a gift from the great Emperor, [AMBASSADOR _and his men bow_] who reigns in Eng-Bathai, the reward of obedience to his edict, a goblet of inestimable wine.  [_He signs and there enters a page bearing a goblet of glass. He has a pretty complexion and yellow hair falling as low as his chin and curling inwards. He wears a cerise belt round his tunic exactly matching the wine in the goblet he carries._  He prays you drink it, and to know that it was made by vintners whose skill is lost, and stored in secret cellars over a hundred years; and that the vineyards whence it came have been long since whelmed by war, and only live now in legend and this wine.  KING: A gift, you say, for obedience.  AMBASSADOR: A gift from the old wine-gardens of the sun.  KING: How knew the Emperor that I had thus obeyed him?  AMBASSADOR: It has not been men's wont to disobey the Emperor.  KING: Yet if I have sheltered this man in the holy place of my Court?  AMBASSADOR: If that be so the Emperor bids you drink out of this golden goblet. [_He signs and it is brought on by a bent and ugly dwarf_] and wishes you farewell.  KING: Farewell, you say?  AMBASSADOR: Farewell.  KING: What have you in the goblet?  AMBASSADOR: It is no common poison, but a thing so strange and deadly that the serpents of Lebutharna go in fear of it. Yea travellers there hold high a goblet of this poison, at arm's length as they go. The serpents hide their heads for fear of it. Even so the travellers pass the desert safely, and come to Eng-Bathai.  KING: I have not sheltered this man.  AMBASSADOR: There is no need then for"]]]
