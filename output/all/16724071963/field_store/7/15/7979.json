REGISTRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY, AND   FORMERLY FELLOW OF TRINITY COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.     CAMBRIDGE:   MACMILLAN AND BOWES.   1894         _The lecture was illustrated by lantern-slides. A brief notice     of each of these is printed in the text in Italics at the     place in the lecture where the slide was exhibited._     LIBRARIES.   A library may be considered from two very different points of view: as a workshop, or as a Museum.  The former commends itself to the practical turn of mind characteristic of the present day; common sense urges that mechanical ingenuity, which has done so much in other directions, should be employed in making the acquisition of knowledge less cumbrous and less tedious; that as we travel by steam, so we should also read by steam, and be helped in our studies by the varied resources of modern invention. There lies on my table at this present moment a _Handbook of Library Appliances_, in which fifty-three closely printed pages are devoted to this interesting subject, with illustrations of various contrivances by which the working of a large library is to be facilitated and brought up to date. In fact, from this point of view a library may be described as a gigantic mincing-machine, into which the labours of the past are flung, to be turned out again in a slightly altered form as the literature of the present.  If, on the other hand, a library be regarded as a Museum--and I use the word in its original sense as a temple or haunt of the Muses--very different ideas are evoked. Such a place is as useful as the other--every facility for study is given--but what I may call the personal element as affecting the treasures there assembled is brought prominently forward. The development of printing, as the result of individual effort; the art of bookbinding, as practised by different persons in different countries; the history of the books themselves, the libraries in which they have found a home, the hands that have turned their pages, are there taken note of. Modern literature is fully represented, but the men of past days are not thrust out of sight; their footsteps seem to linger in the rooms where once they walked--their shades seem to protect the books they once handled. What Browning felt about frescoes may be applied--_mutatis mutandis_--to books in such an asylum as I am trying to portray:      Wherever a fresco peels and drops,       Wherever an outline weakens and wanes     Till the latest life in the painting stops,       Stands One whom each fainter pulse-tick pains:     One, wishful each scrap should clutch the brick,       Each tinge not wholly escape the plaster,     A lion who dies of an ass's kick,       The wronged great soul of an ancient Master.  It may be safely asserted that at no time has a love of reading, a desire to be fairly well-informed on all sorts of subjects, been so widely diffused as at the present day. As a necessary consequence of this the 'workshop' view of a library has been very generally accepted. I have no wish to undervalue it; I only plead for the recognition of another sentiment which may at times be overlaid by the pressure of daily avocations. In Cambridge, at least, there is no fear that it should ever be obliterated altogether, for we have effected a happy alliance between the present and the past, by which neither is neglected, neither is unduly prominent. This being the case, it has occurred to me that I may be so fortunate as to interest a Cambridge audience while I set before them some of the results at which I have arrived in investigating the position, the arrangement, and the fittings of libraries in the medieval and renaissance periods. It will, of course, be impossible to attempt more than a sketch of so extensive a subject, and I fear that I must omit the contents of the bookcases altogether; but I shall hope, by a selection of typical illustrations, to make you realise what some of the libraries, monastic, public, or private, that fall within my period were like.  I must begin with a few words about Roman libraries, because their methods influenced the Middle Ages, and are, in fact, the precursors of those in fashion in our own times. The Romans preserved their books in two ways: either in a small room or closet, for reading elsewhere; or in a large apartment, fitted up with greater or less splendour, according to the taste or the means of the possessor, in which the books were doubtless studied as in a modern library. An instructive example of the former class was one of the first discoveries at Herculaneum in 1754. It was a very small room, so small in fact that a man who stood with his arms extended in the centre of it could almost touch the walls on either side, yet 1700 rolls were found in it. These were kept in wooden presses (_armaria_) which stood against the walls like a modern bookcase. Besides these a rectangular case occupied the central space, with only a narrow passage to the right and left between it and the wall-cases. These cases were about a man's height, and had been numbered. It may be concluded from this that a catalogue of the books had once existed. In larger libraries the books were kept in similar presses, but they were ornamented with the busts or pictures of illustrious men, under each of which was a suitable inscription, usually in verse.  No ancient figure of one of these book-presses has been preserved, so far as I have been able to ascertain; but, as furniture is apt to retain its original forms with but little variation for a very long period, a representation of a press containing the four Gospels, which occurs among the mosaics in the Mausoleum of the Empress Galla Placidia at Ravenna, though it could not have been executed before the middle of the fifth century, may be taken as a fairly accurate picture of the book-presses of an earlier age. It is unnecessary to describe it, for it is exactly like a still later example which I am about to shew you. This picture occurs at the beginning of the MS. of the Vulgate called the _Codex Amiatinus_, which is now proved to have been written in England, at Wearmouth or Jarrow, but probably by an Italian scribe, shortly before 716. The seated figure represents Ezra writing the Law.   _Bookcase in the Codex Amiatinus: from Garrucci, \"Storia dell' arte Cristiana,\"_ iii. pl. 126.  To get an idea of one of the larger Roman libraries in ancient times we cannot do better than turn to that of the Vatican at the present day. It was fitted up as we see it now--with presses, busts, and antique vases, by Pope Sixtus V., in 1588. It is therefore, at best, only a modern antique; but arranged so skilfully that an ancient Roman, if he could come to life again, might imagine himself in his own library.   _Interior of part of the Vatican Library._   The library-era, as we may call it, of the Christian world, began with the publication of the Rule of S. Benedict, early in the sixth century. But, just as that Rule emphasized and arranged on the lines of an ordered system observances which had long been practised by isolated congregations or individuals living in solitude--so the part of it which deals with study was evidently no new thing. S. Benedict did not invent literature or libraries; he only lent the sanction of his name to the study of the one and the formation of the other. That libraries existed before his period is proved by allusions to them in the Fathers and other early writers; but, as those allusions are general, and say nothing from which either their size or their arrangement can be inferred, I shall dismiss them in very few sentences. The earliest is said to have been the collection got together at Jerusalem, by Bishop Alexander, at the beginning of the third century. Another was founded about fifty years later at CÃ¦sarea by Origen. This is described as not only extensive, but remarkable for the importance of the manuscripts it contained. Others are recorded at Hippo, at Cirta, at Constantinople, and at Rome, where both S. Peter's and the Lateran had their special collections of books. I suspect that all these libraries were in connexion with churches, possibly actually within their walls. At Cirta, for example, it is recorded that during the persecution of 303-304 the officers \"went to the church where the Christians used to assemble, and spoiled it of chalices, lamps, etc., but when they came into the library (_bibliothecam_), the presses (_armaria_) there were found empty.\" This language seems to imply that the sacred vessels and the books were in different parts of the same building. The instructions, again, of the dying Augustine, who bequeathed his library to the church at Hippo, lead to the same conclusion. The library of S. Peter's at Rome, though added to the basilica erected by Constantine, long after its primitive foundation, was on the ground-floor in the angle between the nave and the north limb of the transept, a position which may perhaps have been selected in accordance with early usage.  I now pass to the treatment of books in the libraries of the monastic orders. These either adopted the Rule of S. Benedict, or based their own Rule upon its provisions. It will therefore be desirable to examine what he said on the subject of study, and I will translate a few lines from the 48th chapter of his Rule, _Of daily manual labour_.      Idleness is the enemy of the soul; hence brethren ought, at     certain seasons, to occupy themselves with manual labour, and     again, at certain hours, with holy reading....      Between Easter and the calends of October let them apply     themselves to reading from the fourth hour till near the sixth     hour. After the sixth hour, when they rise"]],[["link","http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/19415"],["title","Libraries in the Medieval and Renaissance Periods (#1)"],["body","table, let     them rest on their beds in complete silence; or, if any one     should wish to read to himself, let him do so in such a way as     not to disturb any one else....      From the calends of October to the beginning of Lent let them     apply themselves to reading until the second hour.... During     Lent, let them apply themselves to reading from morning until     the end of the third hour ... and, in these days of Lent, let     them receive a book apiece from the library, and read it     straight through. These books are to be given out at the     beginning of Lent. It is important that one or two seniors     should be appointed to go round the monastery at the hours     when brethren are engaged in reading, in case some     ill-conditioned brother should be giving himself up to sloth     or idle talk, instead of reading steadily; so that not only is     he useless to himself, but incites others to do wrong.  \"Behold! how great a matter a little fire kindleth!\" These simple words, uttered by one who in power of far-reaching influence has had no equal, gave an impulse to study in the ages it once was the fashion to call dark which grew with the growth of the Order--till wherever a Benedictine house arose--or a monastery of any one of the Orders which were but off-shoots from the Benedictine tree--books were multiplied, and a library came into being, small indeed at first, but increasing year by year, till the wealthier houses had gathered together a collection of books that would do credit to a modern University.  It is very interesting to notice, as Order after Order was founded, a steady development of feeling with regard to books, and an ever increasing care for their safe-keeping. S. Benedict had contented himself with general directions for study; the Cluniacs prescribe the selection of a special officer to take charge of the books, with an annual audit of them, and the assignment of a single volume to each brother; the Carthusians and the Cistercians provide for the loan of books to extraneous persons under certain conditions--a provision which the Benedictines in their turn adopted. Further, by the time that the Cluniac Customs were drawn up in the form in which they have come down to us, it is evident that the number of books exceeded the number of brethren; for both in them, and in the statutes which Lanfranc promulgated for the use of the English Benedictines in 1070, the keeper of the books is directed to bring all the books of the House into Chapter, after which the brethren, one by one, are to bring in the books they had borrowed on the same day in the previous year. Some of the former class of books were probably service-books, but, after this deduction has been made, we may fairly conclude that by the end of the eleventh century Benedictine Houses possessed two sets of books: (1) those which were distributed among the brethren; (2) those which were kept in some safe place, probably the church, as part of the valuables of the House: or, to adopt modern phrases, they had a lending library and a library of reference. The Augustinians go a step farther than the Benedictines and the Orders derived from them, for they prescribe the kind of press in which the books are to be kept. Both they and the Premonstratensians permit their books to be lent on the receipt of a pledge of sufficient value. Lastly, the Friars, though they were established on the principle of holding no possessions of any kind, soon found that books were indispensable; that, in the words of a Norman Bishop, _Claustrum sine armario, castrum sine armamentario_. So, by a strange irony, it came to pass that their libraries excelled those of most other Orders, as Richard de Bury testifies in the _Philobiblon_.      Whenever we turned aside to the cities and places where the     Mendicants had their convents ... we found heaped up amidst     the utmost poverty the utmost riches of wisdom....      These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the summer,     and ingenious bees continually fabricating cells of honey....     And to pay due regard to truth, although they lately at the     eleventh hour have entered the Lord's vineyard ..., they have     added more in this brief hour to the stock of the sacred books     than all the other vine-dressers; following in the footsteps     of Paul, the last to be called but the first in preaching, who     spread the gospel of Christ more widely than all others.  It might have been expected, from the use of the word _library_ in the Rule of S. Benedict, that a special room assigned to books would have been one of the primitive component parts of every Benedictine House. This, however, is not the case. Such a room does usually occur in these Houses, but it will be found, on examination, that it was added to some previously existing structure in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. Its absence from the primitive plan brings out two points very clearly: (1) how few books even a wealthy community could afford to possess for several centuries after the foundation of the Order; (2) how strictly the Order adhered to prescribed arrangements in laying out its Houses, for even those built, or rebuilt, after books had become plentiful, do not admit a Library as an indispensable item in their ground-plan.  How then did they bestow their books after they had become too numerous to be kept in the church? The answer to this question is a very curious one, when we consider what our climate is, and indeed what the climate of the whole of Europe is, during the winter months. The centre of the monastic life was the cloister. Brethren were not allowed to congregate in any other part of the conventual buildings, except when they went into the frater, or dining-hall, for their meals, or at certain hours in certain seasons into the warming-house (_calefactorium_). In the cloister accordingly they kept their books; and there they sat and studied, or conducted the schooling of the novices and choir-boys in winter and in summer alike.  Such a locality as this could not have been very favourable to the preservation of the books themselves. They, however, had a certain amount of protection which was denied to their readers, for they were shut up in presses. The word used for these, _armarium_, is the same as that which was applied by the Romans to their bookcases; and probably the idea of such a piece of furniture was due to a far-off echo of ancient usage. The official who had charge of the books did not derive his name from them, as in modern times, but from the presses which contained them--for he was uniformly styled _armarius_.  As time went on, greater comfort was introduced. The windows of the walk of the cloister where the presses stood, usually the walk next the Church, were glazed--and sometimes not merely with white glass, but with mottoes alluding to the authors whose works were near at hand; while in some monasteries the elder monks were provided with small wooden studies, called \"carrells.\" A description of the whole system has been preserved for us in that curious book _The Rites of Durham_; but it must be remembered that this represents the customs of the convent just before the suppression, and therefore gives no idea of the rigour of an earlier time.   _Part of the north walk of the cloister, Durham._       In the north syde of the Cloister, from the corner over     against the Church dour to the corner over againste the Dorter     dour, was all fynely glased from the hight to the sole within     a litle of the grownd into the Cloister garth. And in every     wyndowe iij Pewes or Carrells, where every one of the old     Monks had his carrell, severall by himselfe, that, when they     had dyned, they dyd resort to that place of Cloister, and     there studyed upon there books, every one in his carrell, all     the after nonne, unto evensong tyme. This was there exercise     every daie.      All there pewes or carrells was all fynely wainscotted and     verie close, all but the forepart, which had carved wourke     that gave light in at ther carrell doures of wainscott. And in     every carrell was a deske to lye there bookes on. And the     carrells was no greater then from one stanchell of the wyndowe     to another.      And over against the carrells against the church wall did     stande certaine great almeries [or cupbords] of waynscott all     full of bookes [with great store of ancient manuscripts to     help them in their study], wherein did lye as well the old     auncyent written Doctors of the Church as other prophane     authors with dyverse other holie mens wourks, so that every     one dyd studye what Doctor pleased them best, havinge the     Librarie at all tymes to goe studie in besydes there carrells.  No example of an English monastic book-press has survived, so far as I have been able to discover; but it would be rash to say that none exists. Meanwhile I will shew you a French example of a press, from the sacristy of the Cathedral at Bayeux, but I cannot be sure that it was originally intended to hold books. M. Viollet-Le-Duc, from whom I borrow it, decides that it was probably made early in the thirteenth century.   _Cupboard from sacristy of Bayeux Cathedral._   The Durham _Rites_ speak only of book-presses standing in the cloister against the walls; but it was not unusual to have recesses in the wall itself, fitted with shelves, and probably closed by a door. Two such are to be seen at Worcester, immediately to the north of the chapter-house door. Each is about ten feet wide by two feet deep.   _Book-recess, east walk of the cloister, Worcester._   A similar receptacle for books seems to have been contemplated in Augustinian Houses, for in the Customs of the Augustinian Priory of Barnwell, written towards the end of the thirteenth century, the following passage occurs:      The press in which the books are kept ought to be lined inside     with wood, that the damp of"]]]
